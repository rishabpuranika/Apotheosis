<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As he helplessly watched Luo Zheng escape from his binding force, Chance's face was shadowed with a small trace of anger.</p>

  <p>He had no idea about the red light in Luo Zheng's right eye, but he had felt the horror brought by it, even though it had lasted for one tiny, ephemeral moment.</p>

  <p>"Crooked way!"</p>

  <p>Chance bellowed, trying to settle the fear he felt inside. He waved his blood-red sword into the air again, and hundreds of beams of sword radiance shot out!</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Seeing how aggressive the sword radiances were getting now, Luo Zheng was sure that he would be defeated sooner or later if he kept on dodging. He had to put an end to this fight.</p>

  <p>Seeing the sword radiance rush toward him, Luo Zheng waved his Snow Sword, hacking at nine different points.</p>

  <p>"Nine-Flash Light-splitting Swordsmanship!" he roared.</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish! Swish!</p>

  <p>Nine rays of bright and pearly white colored sword radiance chopped the air and rushed toward Chance's sword radiance at an incredible speed.</p>

  <p>But Chance's sword radiance was much more stable and strong since it contained greater Other Shore Power than Luo Zheng's. The latter's was remarkably fast, but regretfully, lacked quite a bit in power. When the two sword radiances collided, Luo Zheng's nine rays were smashed into nothingness as if they were made of paper or dry weeds.</p>

  <p>Apparently, Luo Zheng couldn't block the sword radiance Chance was throwing at him. All he could do was to retreat and dodge again and again. He was in a precarious situation now.</p>

  <p>"Huh! Now you see it! It's not that easy to make up for such a huge gap between cultivation levels," Chance remarked casually, staring at Luo Zheng with a scornful gaze. He began to approach Luo Zheng impassively with his sword in hand.</p>

  <p>The direct descendants of the palace nodded subconsciously when they heard this. Chance's words made sense. How could Luo Zheng confront such a strong warrior at the Chaotic Source Realm, especially when he was comparatively much weaker?</p>

  <p>However, unknown to them, Chance was still a bit puzzled by the red light in Luo Zheng's right eye.</p>

  <p>He didn't know what it was, but could sense that it was quite a rare Other Shore Token since it could disturb even his mind. He guessed it could be a mysterious type and would not contain much Other Shore Power.</p>

  <p>Even the mysterious Other Shore Tokens of Stage Fourteen could unleash no more than 300 Jun of force.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng had unleashed almost a thousand Jun of force just now. Was it possible that he had two Other Shore Tokens?</p>

  <p>Pondering over the possibilities, Chances waved his blood-red sword.</p>

  <p>"Annihilation World!"</p>

  <p>The sword radiance that rushed out this time contained an overwhelming intent of annihilation. Even if someone was just grazed by it, they would sustain serious injuries.</p>

  <p>Faced with such an offensive attack, Luo Zheng was forced to dodge again.</p>

  <p>He was being forced to retreat continuously by Chance's attacks. Very soon, he completely withdrew from the Heavenly Cultivation Palace.</p>

  <p>Seeing the ongoing fight, the palace maids and servants were frightened to the core and fled away. Guards of the Phoenix Palace recognized Chance, so they did not dare stop him.</p>

  <p>Xun, Nelly, and Liusu were merely following the fight closely. Luo Zheng was moving towards a disadvantage now, and they looked worried. They were nervously watching him dodge the sword light again and again. If he wasn't careful enough, he might die. That was not something they wanted to see.</p>

  <p>'It looks like I will have to use the Civilization Artifact... Fine then.'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had told almost everything he had come across in the Dark Region to Flamine and Athemar. But he had concealed the Civilization Artifact from them.</p>

  <p>Previously, Flamine had wanted to seal the Memory Flame of Teague, but Teague had managed to find a way to dispel it at the last moment.</p>

  <p>Therefore, it was impossible for her to learn the secrets of the Regal Jade Civilization and the Civilization Artifact.</p>

  <p>But once Feng Ge recovered, she would tell Flamine, who was her mother, about these sooner or later. It wasn't like it could be kept a secret forever!</p>

  <p>While he thought about this, an idea flashed in his mind. A virtual shadow of the Civilization Artifact suddenly appeared in his inner world. And in the outside world, with a sweep of his hand, a jade sculpture appeared in front of him.</p>

  <p>A sculpture of the Regal Jade Beast, merely a single foot tall!</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade Beast sculpture stood still like any ordinary jade sculpture would do.</p>

  <p>Chance had been forcing Luo Zheng backwards step by step, but seeing this, his eye twitched and his face revealed a strange expression. The corners of his mouth slightly curled into a smile. "Huh! This is your Other Shore Token?</p>

  <p>A descending type?"</p>

  <p>There was a sarcastic tone to the question. As soon as he finished his words, he wielded his blood-red sword in the hope of smashing it in a single strike.</p>

  <p>A beam of sword radiance shot straight towards the Regal Jade Beast sculpture.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The sword radiance hit the surface of the Regal Jade Beast sculpture with a crisp sound. But unlike what Chance had expected, it merely left a deep sword mark instead of breaking it down.</p>

  <p>"Hmm... This Other Shore Token is remarkably solid, but how many strikes can it withstand?" Chance sneered contemptuously.</p>

  <p>He again waved his sword three times in a row, hacking at the sculpture repeatedly. Hit again and again by his Annihilation World which contained enormous amounts of annihilation intent, the Regal Jade Beast sculpture suddenly broke into a thousand emerald green pieces which gradually disappeared.</p>

  <p>As a descending type of Other Shore Token, the sculpture was quite vulnerable to damage. And once it was damaged, it would need a large amount of divine crystals to be repaired.</p>

  <p>Seeing the sculpture break into pieces, Ahmad and the direct descendants burst into laughter.</p>

  <p>"What a weak descending type of Other Shore Token! Was that a joke?"</p>

  <p>"That was the weakest Other Shore Token I've ever seen."</p>

  <p>"Hang on! The Other Shore Tokens of descending type are supposed to be powerful since they can help a warrior break through the limits of corporeal body. But why was this one so weak?"</p>

  <p>The corporeal body that hadn't gone through the Chaotic Source Reinforcement could not withstand a thousand Jun of force.</p>

  <p>But a token of the descending type didn't need the corporeal body to bear it.</p>

  <p>Instead it could help the warrior break through that limit and exert an even greater force. For example, Feng Ge's Warrior of the Stone Hill could burst out more than a thousand Jun of force by itself.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's sculpture seemed immovable and fragile, which was truly incredible.</p>

  <p>It was reasonable that they mocked him.</p>

  <p>But just as Chance had smashed this Other Shore Token, Luo Zheng's hand waved lightly in the air again.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Another Other Shore Token appeared right next to him; yet another Regal Jade Beast sculpture was standing impassively!</p>

  <p>"What's this?" Chance was a little stunned.</p>

  <p>Ahmad and the others were confused as well.</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade Beast sculpture had been cut into smithereens by Chance.</p>

  <p>He hadn't seen Luo Zheng use any divine crystals to repair it. Furthermore, even if Luo Zheng did use divine crystals, a broken Other Shore Token could not be repaired within such a short period of time.</p>

  <p>Was it possible that they were wrong?</p>

  <p>Was it because this particular Other Shore Token wasn't a descending type?</p>

  <p>What was the use of the Regal Jade Beast he had summoned then?</p>

  <p>Chance was getting a little impatient now. He didn't know what Luo Zheng was playing at. He flew up, raised his blood-red sword with his left hand, and hit the second sculpture directly.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The second sculpture was smashed into pieces by a single strike this time.</p>

  <p>As soon as he smashed this sculpture, Chance began to chase after Luo Zheng once again.</p>

  <p>He didn't care what the use of these Regal Jade sculptures was. All he wanted was to kill Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>With Chance in hot pursuit, Luo Zheng acted very calmly.</p>

  <p>Since he was unable to fight against Chance head-on, he merely kept dodging and retreating. And while retreating, he kept on releasing Regal Jade Beast sculptures one after another.</p>

  <p>Chance was hot headed. But if he had been cautious enough, then he would have instantly noticed that these sculptures were gradually growing in size.</p>

  <p>Each one was bigger and taller than the previous one!</p>

  <p>Chance finally noticed this after smashing a few of them.</p>

  <p>'There's something strange about his sculptures.'</p>

  <p>Out of fighting instinct, Chance didn't let go of any sculpture even after realizing that. He cut through all the tokens that Luo Zheng was releasing into pieces along the way.</p>

  <p>Forced to repeatedly destroy these sculptures, Chance had to slow down.</p>

  <p>They were proving to be quite a nuisance.</p>

  <p>Just as Chance cut the tenth sculpture, he was faced with yet another problem.</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade Beast sculpture had now grown as tall as a man. Previously, he had been able to stab through the sculptures in a single strike, but now, he could only leave a few cracks on it with one strike. These Regal Jade sculptures were becoming bigger and stronger.</p>
