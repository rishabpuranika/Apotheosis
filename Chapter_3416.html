<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Facing the Evil God in a chaotic war was definitely not the wisest choice.</p>

  <p>He was able to slaughter his way across the Chaotic Source World after all, and not just because he depended on the Ways-blending Energy According to the man from the Separate Abyss race, the Evil God had the ability to descend a world but hadn't used such a powerful trump card yet.</p>

  <p>The giant eye released its overwhelming power of fear, which was a threat to everyone. Eliminating this threat was the most urgent at the moment.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng was determined to get the arc light in the Evil God's hand.</p>

  <p>The giant eye felt extremely depressed.</p>

  <p>It let out the force of fear in order to help the Chaotic Source Spirits. On the other hand, this, coupled with the giant sword created from the Evil God's Ways-blending Energy, would no doubt help in getting rid of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Since there was no way it could take their physical bodies, the giant eye focused on self-preservation instead.</p>

  <p>Yan's alertness and willingness to protect Luo Zheng came as a complete shock along with the explosion of Evil God's sword strike. Just what in the world was going on?</p>

  <p>Without any idea what to do and with its hope running out fast, the giant eye turned around and entered the main peak.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Luo Zheng promptly changed his direction and threw a punch towards the outer wall of the main peak, creating a big hole from which he and Yan entered.</p>

  <p>The place where the giant eye and Luo Zheng entered was in the upper part of the main peak.</p>

  <p>Multiple traps had been set here previously by the giant eye, along with the engraved sculptures that littered the walls.</p>

  <p>As soon as Luo Zheng and Yan entered, all of the sculptures' eyes flashed dark red and the giant eye's force of fear surged, enveloping them almost instantly.</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...</p>

  <p>All around them were glinting, dark red eyes that threatened to subdue them.</p>

  <p>"Go mad!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng understood the giant eye's actions. It was no doubt getting desperate.</p>

  <p>When the force of fear was amped up to maximum, it had the ability to drown its opponent's mind and disorder their Memory Flame. It could wash away all memories and leave behind a singular emotion: fear. A man who only knew fear was doomed to live in constant, paralyzing paranoia.</p>

  <p>The amount of fear that was headed towards their way made Luo Zheng pale.</p>

  <p>Yan scoffed at this scene. She gently pulled Luo Zheng closer as a burst of cyan light from the silk cloth enveloped them, turning into a huge cloak that protected the two.</p>

  <p>This silk cloth would protect them no matter what.</p>

  <p>"Let me help you," she whispered to her brother's ear.</p>

  <p>Staying underneath the silk protection would be inconvenient.</p>

  <p>They had to move fast, owing largely to the fact that the Evil God remained a threat over their heads. It would be best to finish this fight with the giant eye as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded in understanding. "Okay."</p>

  <p>Rays of cyan light appeared on the silk surface as soft Braveness Rain started to pour. Yan pulled the silk cloth off them and let the drops of Braveness Rain wash over them.</p>

  <p>With this blessed protection, Luo Zheng was able to move fast. He flew in midair and rushed towards the giant eye in breakneck speed!</p>

  <p>"Stay away from me!" the giant eye warned through a streak of consciousness. As Luo Zheng got closer, it let out a beam of red light that hit him directly.</p>

  <p>Despite its attack, Luo Zheng remained unharmed due to the protection of Yan's Braveness Rain.</p>

  <p>Wasting no time at all, he drew his sword and slammed down.</p>

  <p>"Bang!" There was a reverberating sound as his sword hit the giant eye smack at the pupil.</p>

  <p>Eyes were the most vulnerable part of any creature, and the Dreaded Eye Demons were no exception.</p>

  <p>The only reason they could rule the chaos for a period of time in the past was that no creature dared to look at these Dreaded Eye Demons, or they would risk spending their lives in endless fear.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng managed to pierce his sword right into the creature's pupil.</p>

  <p>As his sword split its pupil, it scattered, tainting the white of the eye and painting a rather horrible picture to look at.</p>

  <p>"Ouch!"</p>

  <p>The pain was great and the giant eye simply wanted to roll away to seek refuge into the depths of the main peak.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng wasn't going to give it that chance! He raised his sword a second time and white sword radiance flickered on the surface of the blade.</p>

  <p>Thinking fast, the eye shot a ray of white light towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately for the giant eye, it did nothing to immobilize the man.</p>

  <p>"Nine-Flash Light-splitting!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's sword radiance flashed as he began to strike hard and fast, cutting the eye multiple times in a span of a short time.</p>

  <p>Cuts littered every square inch of the eye's surface.</p>

  <p>These cuts healed rapidly but a new one always replaced the ones that closed.</p>

  <p>For a while, only the sound of Luo Zheng's fury could be heard as he continued this tirade of attacks.</p>

  <p>Faced with the reality that it could no longer fight back, the giant eye ceased struggling and stood still, allowing Luo Zheng to litter it with cuts.</p>

  <p>When he realized that the giant eye no longer fought back, Luo Zheng stopped.</p>

  <p>He had no idea what kind of existence this giant eye was. If the Eye of Will was a creature from the Other Shore, then the only way it could appear in the Chaotic Source World was if it was an Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>However, if it was an Other Shore Token, who was its bearer?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng approached the giant eye cautiously and a flash of blood-red light burst out from it all over again. Despite the protection of the Braveness Rain, Luo Zheng felt the frightening power of this red beam.</p>

  <p>"Is it burning itself?"</p>

  <p>An Other Shore Token had the ability to produce a terrifyingly powerful flame.</p>

  <p>This powerful flame had its consequences though. It could cause the bearer to die and there was no way an Other Shore Token would do it willingly unless it found no more hope to its situation.</p>

  <p>Just as the eye began to burn, the cyan silk cloth from Yan flew and wrapped itself tightly around it.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't notice Yan arrive beside him. She picked up the cyan silk cloth and flicked her fingers. "Seal!" With her command, the cyan silk cloth completely sealed the troublesome giant eye.</p>

  <p>"I'll give this to the Li Shan mountain," she told Luo Zheng who nodded in understanding.</p>

  <p>Yan stretched out a dainty finger and tapped her space ring, sucking the sealed giant eye into it.</p>

  <p>One of her established tasks had been to deal with the Dreaded Eye Demon and she had now accomplished it.</p>

  <p>The Li Shan mountain was greatly interested in the eye and Yan will be delivering it to Fuxi.</p>

  <p>Had it been anyone else, Luo Zheng would never allow them to take this giant eye, but Yan was different. He couldn't refuse her.</p>

  <p>With the eye dealt with, they turned their attention back to the deafening roars from outside. The two of them exchanged a nod. "Let's go!"</p>

  <p>The bloody lines the giant eye had drawn were now completely gone and everyone could move freely.</p>

  <p>Some Chaotic Source Spirits relentlessly hunted down the Ear Mice who, when they could no longer defend themselves, sought refuge in the arrays.</p>

  <p>The Chaotic Source Spirits could do nothing as the Ear Mice hid from them.</p>

  <p>Several large Chaotic Source Spirits had also broken down, bursting in piles of amber-colored crystals that were immediately grabbed by multiple hands from various races.</p>
