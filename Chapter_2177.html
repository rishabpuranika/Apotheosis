<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2177 Short Halberds (Part One) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Malloy also understood in his heart that the power that Zheng had just released was too scary. The others who also saw Zheng's power were also mystified. It had simply exceeded the limit of what a proving godly warrior should possess. To be able to shatter the White Jade Token with just a single throw, it was enough to prove his ability…</p>

  <p>For someone who had reached such a level, there was no need to rank him. Zheng was clearly at a different level compared to the other participants. Malloy could even make an exception and directly recruit Zheng into the Heavenly Han House.</p>

  <p>However, he needed an excuse to find out Zheng's strength!</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Han House was also under great pressure. For the past thousand years, the Holy Emperor of the Han Clan had only accepted one disciple. Furthermore, that disciple did not originate from the Heavenly Han House but was a direct descendant from the Floating Island of Han Clan. As such, they still hadn't produced anyone worthy to be a disciple of the Holy Emperor of the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>In these thousand years, the Heavenly Han House had already nurtured quite a lot of elites and talents. However, after those talents advanced to become True Gods, their performances were very mediocre. Even the warriors who were recommended by the Heavenly Han House to go to the Floating Island hadn't done anything very impressive. It seemed that the potential of the recruits they had was not that great.</p>

  <p>The Han Clan on the Floating Island had already spread the word that if the Heavenly Han House failed to recommend an eligible disciple for the Holy Emperor within the next thousand years, they would distribute the qualifications of recommending warriors to the thirty-six regions. At that time, all the proving godly houses in the thirty-six regions could recommend warriors to the Floating Island of Han Clan! The influence of the Heavenly Han House would greatly decrease!</p>

  <p>The Holy Emperor of the Han Clan was the one who chose his disciples.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Han House could only recommend warriors. However, It was difficult to find the right people.</p>

  <p>Malloy wished that he could become a disciple of the Holy Emperor, but it was a pity that he didn't have the qualifications. With disappointment in his heart, he could only accept his fate…</p>

  <p>The sub-branches of the Han Clan had relied on the main Han Clan on the Floating Island to flourish in the Six-Burden Divine City. The main Han Clan had granted the recommendation rights to the Heavenly Han House. As such, the proving godly warriors in the 36 regions had no choice but to gather in the Six-Burden Divine City to participate in the test. That contract had made the Heavenly Han House flourish.</p>

  <p>Although the Six-Burden Region was the Han Clan's ancestral land, the main Han Clan had already moved to the Floating Island. Additionally, the people in the sub-branches of the Han Clan were only relatives of the main Han Clan. Some of them even had no relation to the Han Clan by blood. As such, it was quite generous for the main Han Clan to give such a privilege to them.</p>

  <p>If the Han Clan on the Floating Island gave the right of recommendation to other proving godly houses, then the status of the sub-branches of Han Clan would be greatly weakened. Additionally, the other godly houses might also use that opportunity to gain more influence and power.</p>

  <p>However, it was too difficult to find a disciple that could satisfy the requirements of the Holy Emperor. Such talent was rare even in the bigger clans. Ever since Malloy had taken up his post, he had not seen such a genius who was qualified...</p>

  <p>At the thought that he had to shoulder the responsibility to secure the position of the sub-branches of Han Clan, Malloy's heart felt heavy. He didn't want the sub-branches of the Han Clan to fail.</p>

  <p>With the cultivation of a proving godly warrior, Zheng was able to shake a part of the space. A never-before-seen talent had finally arrived in the Heavenly Han House. Malloy's curiosity towards Zheng grew more intense.</p>

  <p>As he saw Zheng's skills, the fire of hope in Malloy's heart had ignited!</p>

  <p>If there was really a sliver of a chance for Zheng to be chosen by the Holy Emperor of the Han Clan, then Heavenly Han House's position would be saved. Thus, Malloy had mercilessly reprimanded Zane after he previously provoked Tianxing. Malloy had indeed placed his hopes in Zheng.</p>

  <p>When Zheng heard the suggestion from Malloy, he immediately nodded his head in agreement.</p>

  <p>Malloy then took out an object from his space ring. It was a pair of black short halberds. As he grabbed the halberds, Malloy approached Zheng. He smiled and said to Zheng, "This pair of short halberds are supreme primordial weapons without any rank. I know you're a sword cultivator, but the value of this pair of short halberds is also about a hundred divine might coins. Now, I give them to you and you can use one of them to throw again."</p>

  <p>When Malloy handed the pair of short halberds to Zheng, the envy in Zane's eyes grew even stronger. A deep hatred towards Zheng seethed in Zane's heart.</p>

  <p>For the test of the Heavenly Han House, the five descendants of the Han Clan sub-branches had all participated. Due to their great potential, they all had a high opinion of each other's strengths. Originally, all five of them wanted to take over the top five rankings. Additionally, Malloy promised that he would give the pair of short halberds to whoever got the top spot!</p>

  <p>The weapon that Zane usually used was a short halberd. Although this particular pair of short halberds were not of high quality, they were still supreme primordial weapons. He didn't expect that his uncle would just give them to Zheng like that. It was too unfair. Jealousy and disbelief crept into his heart.</p>

  <p>The eyes of the five descendants of the Han Clan sub-branches were all focused on Zheng. They had different thoughts in their minds. When Seth saw Zane's indignant expression, he lightly patted him on the shoulder and consoled him, "Uncle Malloy is also doing this for the consideration of our Han Clan sub-branches. This Tianxing really has such a terrifying strength and talent, so we shouldn't offend him. Don't say anything you shouldn't say. Uncle Malloy might want you to apologize…"</p>

  <p>"Why should I apologize!" Zane roared angrily in a low voice. He didn't want Malloy to hear him.</p>
