  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Maybe you don't belong here," said Clarence.</p>

  <p>"I don't belong here? I was indeed born in this world, and so was the Evil God," Zheng said in confusion. He did not understand why Clarence said such a thing.</p>

  <p>Zheng was a human being who was born in the third-grade world, the chaos, and the Evil God was a human being born in Zheng's inner world. Both of them did not come from distinct backgrounds, and what they experienced was a coincidence at most. Elder Xue, who had gone to the Deep Space, had created this coincidence.</p>

  <p>However, Clarence suddenly said those words, which surprised Zheng. He had no idea how Clarence came to such a conclusion.</p>

  <p>"I can't explain," Clarence said with a shake of his head.</p>

  <p>All the way from the thirteenth-grade world to the third-grade one, Clarence had seen all sorts of strange civilizations.</p>

  <p>There was a civilization of pure energy bodies, creatures of pure consciousness, and races in the shape of stone tablets like the Sacred Spirit race.</p>

  <p>Yet, no matter how they changed, those creatures, races, and civilizations followed the most basic rules.</p>

  <p>There were no exceptions!</p>

  <p>That was also why Clarence did not want to help Zheng. He believed that the latter's struggle was meaningless.</p>

  <p>But the method that the Evil God had used violated all those basic rules, which gave Clarence a new perspective.</p>

  <p>Indeed, the Evil God broke the rules!</p>

  <p>Clarence had thought about this issue, which was why he had asked Zheng to give it a try. The result was what Clarence had expected, and that was Zheng had the same ability as the Evil God.</p>

  <p>"From the high-grade worlds to the low-grade worlds, they are all under your control. Why is there anything that you can't explain?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>In general, he could only be omniscient in his primitive land, unlike Clarence, who owned the perfect land. Clarence controlled all the materials and energy, but now he had encountered something that he could not explain.</p>

  <p>Clarence burst into laughter at Zheng's question and said, "The truth is that there are many questions that I cannot answer. I don't know where I came from. I don't know who created the perfect land, nor do I know what exists outside the perfect land..."</p>

  <p>All the creatures of every world considered Clarence as the supreme creator, who had all kinds of abilities and was the core of all the rules.</p>

  <p>In turn, all the creatures he trusted could find any answers from him, and they took him as their guide.</p>

  <p>But who could lead the way for Clarence?</p>

  <p>He clearly understood that downgrade felt like a devastating blow to him, but it was impossible to predict what would happen in the first-grade world. Even the downgrader was also confused, and he did not know what would happen if the world got downgraded to the first grade. However, since his mission seemed to be engraved to his bones, it drove him to do such a thing.</p>

  <p>Clarence continued, "I spent countless years looking for an answer. I have tried many times, and even subdued Mastema in the eighth-grade world. I consumed ninety-nine percent of the energy in the eighth-grade world and launched a powerful energy attack."</p>

  <p>"That force must be immensely powerful..." Zheng said in a shaky voice.</p>

  <p>"What's the point of being powerful? The world still moves within the rules, and I am just a prisoner in it," Clarence muttered.</p>

  <p>"Then now..."</p>

  <p>"Now I see that you have broken the rules, which gave me hope. There seems to be a gap in the cage of rules," Clarence said in a slightly joyful tone.</p>

  <p>At first, he was quite indifferent to Zheng. For him, Zheng was just a new host, but now he had shown a great deal of patience.</p>

  <p>"Can breaking the rules stop the downgrading?" Zheng asked. A flame of hope flickered in his heart.</p>

  <p>"Maybe, or maybe not," Clarence answered.</p>

  <p>Before, he was quite sure that it was impossible to stop the process of downgrading, but now he felt optimistic.</p>

  <p>"What should I do?" Zheng asked again.</p>

  <p>"Devour the Evil God," suggested Clarence.</p>

  <p>When Zheng heard those words, his jaw dropped in shock.</p>

  <p>"The Evil God has taken away something that should have belonged to you. If you can take it back, then I might be able to find a way to stop the downgrading," said Clarence.</p>

  <p>Still, Zheng looked a bit hesitant. "We have the same power now. I'm afraid it won't be easy to devour him," he said.</p>

  <p>"He is inexperienced in using those energies at advanced levels, but I can give my experiences to you," Clarence said with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>Zheng previously had the same power as the downgrader, which was the Extreme Form energies. However, he was at a disadvantage because the downgrader was much more experienced.</p>

  <p>If Clarence gave his experiences to Zheng, then Zheng would have a higher chance of winning against the Evil God.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng did not say anything. Instead, he activated the power of omniscience.</p>

  <p>As for the Evil God, he did not pay attention to the fairy palace at all.</p>

  <p>After all, he exerted all his effort on stopping the downgrading.</p>

  <p>He had ordered two billion brains to think of a solution. In turn, the brains thought that when the Evil God won, they would live and escape from being controlled. They hoped that the Evil God would give them new bodies and even freedom. Unfortunately, they heard that the world began to downgrade. It made them quite furious, and in order to survive, they had no choice but try their best to help the Evil God.</p>

  <p>Although they actively helped out, this was an unsolvable problem. No matter how many of them were there, they couldn't change the situation.</p>

  <p>Their original plan was to let the Evil God seal the Wall World.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the Evil God went to the downgraded area and released a flood of the Cold Phase. Alas, it was useless. Only crystal clear snowflakes remained in the Wall World that had expanded multiple times.</p>

  <p>Then, the brains asked the Evil God to fill the Wall World with materials.</p>

  <p>The Evil God tried again. He created a thousand mountains and threw them in. Those mountains became crushed into thin, grayish-brown pieces and sank into the Wall World.</p>

  <p>Without another word, the Evil God even created tens of millions of mountains.</p>

  <p>It was not hard for him as he possessed an infinite amount of energy and materials.</p>

  <p>Despite that, the downgrading power could also devour everything indefinitely. It meant that even filling the Wall World with materials was not an effective method.</p>

  <p>One method...</p>

  <p>Two methods...</p>

  <p>Three methods...</p>

  <p>Some time had passed, and the Evil God had tried more than twenty methods in a row.</p>

  <p>The downgrading continued, while the Wall World's speed of expansion further increased. It was not long before it had grown to the size of a province in the Source World.</p>

  <p>Just as the Evil God looked at the rapidly expanding Wall World, he suddenly heard a mocking laugh from the black light in the center of the Wall World. Then the black light said, "You can break some rules, but you can't stop the downgrading. Even Clarence can't stop it, not to mention a nobody like you."</p>

  <p>"Clarence? Who is he?" the Evil God asked.</p>

  <p>"He is my creator, but he is also against me. He is omniscient, but he still can't do anything about the downgrading," the downgrader answered.</p>

  <p>The Evil God's eyes lit up. "Where is he?" he asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>"He is hiding within Zheng's body, of course. Ha-ha..." the downgrader sneered, in a deliberate attempt to provoke the Evil God.</p>

  <p>After a few moments of silence, the Evil God suddenly stretched out his hand, and a ring of energy appeared in his palm.</p>

  <p>He then grasped the ring of energy, and his body quickly disappeared.</p>

  <p>In the next second, he appeared in the fairy palace. The energy ring in his hand immediately flew towards Zheng and was about to wrap around his head.</p>

  <p>Even though the Evil God's attack was quite abrupt, Zheng was not slow to react. He swiftly reached out and gently pinched the edge of the energy ring, which caused it to break.</p>
