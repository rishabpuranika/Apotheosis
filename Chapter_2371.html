<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2371 Removing Three Seconds </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>With a resounding crack, the blood-red bird pierced through the black bead that was in the middle of the shadow.</p>

  <p>The shadow disappeared almost immediately after the bead shattered.</p>

  <p>The bird then circled around with soft whooshing sounds, and returned to Rachelle's hand.</p>

  <p>A smile took its place on her face, but when she saw flashes of figures trying to run away, the expression on her face shifted. "Want to run away?" she shouted.</p>

  <p>The number of these shadows was diminishing by the minute. Some of the consummate True Gods could not hold back and rushed over.</p>

  <p>With a tap of her toe, Rachelle turned into a red light and shot along the pillar.</p>

  <p>As she went deeper and deeper, a bronze wall appeared before her, Nelly and Zheng at the foot of the wall.</p>

  <p>"Nelly!"</p>

  <p>Rachelle exclaimed, delighted.</p>

  <p>After all, Nelly was her younger sister and Rachelle was happy to see her safe.</p>

  <p>But as her gaze shifted to Zheng, she noticed the jade seal in Zheng's hand and was startled.</p>

  <p>"The jade seal!"</p>

  <p>Zheng sat upright on the ground, his eyes closed. It was obvious that he was refining the jade seal.</p>

  <p>Like Rachelle, the other consummate True Gods looked at the jade seal greedily.</p>

  <p>They had turned the Time Sea Forbidden Land upside down to get this jade seal. They had searched and searched for a long time.</p>

  <p>And now that the jade seal was right in front of them, everyone was eager to get their hands on it.</p>

  <p>Nelly had pulled out two short swords and was standing before Zheng to protect him. Her round eyes were sharp and she didn't cower even if she had to fight the numerous consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>"It's so strange that the girl from the Mu Clan is helping an outsider," said a consummate True God with a sneer on his face, and then looked at Rachelle.</p>

  <p>Rachelle's face darkened. Her sister had been behaving unnaturally ever since she had come in contact with Zheng. Rachelle didn't know what had happened to Nelly, and now that the latter was standing in front of Zheng, it made her feel even stranger about her.</p>

  <p>"What the hell do you want?" Rachelle shouted at Nelly.</p>

  <p>Nelly pulled one short sword forward and held the other behind her, like a mantis ready to attack.</p>

  <p>The swordsmanship, the martial arts, and the Godly Way she had cultivated were all arts she had learned from Rachelle.</p>

  <p>When she saw what her sister was doing, the only thought that passed through Rachelle's mind was that Nelly was being childish. She shook her head and said, "Nelly, get out of the way. You're not supposed to get involved in this."</p>

  <p>"I..."</p>

  <p>Nelly hesitated, her voice trembling.</p>

  <p>It was not that she was afraid of these consummate True Gods. She was just not used to offending her tough sister, which was why she really wanted to control herself from retorting.</p>

  <p>Nelly managed to calm down and said with difficulty, "Whatever I want to do, you don't have to arrange for me."</p>

  <p>"Y-you!" Rachelle sputtered. There was a gleam of anger in her eyes. It was hard for her to imagine and accept that Nelly would say something like that to her.</p>

  <p>"No matter what Rachelle does, if you don't get out of the way, don't blame me for being rude to you," a consummate True God said with a weird laugh, the hook in his hand flashing a silver light. He looked ready to pounce on Nelly.</p>

  <p>The goal of these consummate True Gods was to obtain the jade seal.</p>

  <p>Whoever blocked them would be eliminated.</p>

  <p>Nelly was merely a low-rank True God. They would not have shown mercy to her even if she were a consummate True God.</p>

  <p>"No way!"</p>

  <p>A metallic clang sounded.</p>

  <p>Rachelle had waved her short sword and stopped the consummate True God.</p>

  <p>"Rachelle, control your sister. Don't mess with me," the consummate True God yelled angrily, dissatisfied with how Rachelle had stopped him. He then brandished the silver hook in his hand again.</p>

  <p>Rachelle couldn't watch Nelly being killed in front of her without doing anything. So how could she let this consummate True God attack Nelly?</p>

  <p>But she could only entangle one consummate True God.</p>

  <p>The other consummate True Gods took this opportunity to rush to attack Nelly.</p>

  <p>"Hoo--"</p>

  <p>"Pew!"</p>

  <p>A long sword, a golden hammer, and a large saber came to Nelly, all supreme primordial weapons.</p>

  <p>Three consummate True Gods attacked Nelly at the same time. They were strong enough together that they could tear through her.</p>

  <p>Nelly held the two swords on either side of her, trying to block the attack of the three consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>Although she knew that it was all in vain, an inexplicably great courage emerged from her heart, and this allowed her to stand strong before Zheng.</p>

  <p>A series of fierce attacks from Rachelle forced back the consummate True God using the silver hook. When she turned around and saw that Nelly was cornered, her expression shifted. But it was too late to save her. She gritted her teeth angrily.</p>

  <p>It was at this moment that Zheng opened his eyes.</p>

  <p>His expression didn't change when he saw Nelly blocking the attack from three consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>"Puff!" "Puff!" "Puff!"</p>

  <p>All three of these attackers had nine stars each in their bodies. Even if they couldn't use the Godly Way, their attacks couldn't be ignored.</p>

  <p>Nelly's resistance was like an egg striking a stone.</p>

  <p>The two short swords in Nelly's hands broke easily as the large saber and the long sword cut into her body.</p>

  <p>The heavy hammer was the last to strike her.</p>

  <p>Nelly's vigorous body had turned into a horrifying sight in a matter of moments.</p>

  <p>"Nelly!"</p>

  <p>Rachelle stretched out her hands in Nelly's direction, her eyes wide open in shock.</p>

  <p>Although she had become a consummate True God, she still had deep affection for her younger sister, Nelly.</p>

  <p>If it were for the greater good, she could choose to sacrifice Nelly's life, even her own. But watching Nelly being butchered right in front of her was hard to accept. Her eyes brimmed with heartbroken tears.</p>

  <p>When Zheng opened his eyes and saw what was happening, he still remained calm.</p>

  <p>He slightly turned the jade seal in his hand and an idea popped into the seal.</p>

  <p>Driven by his thought, all the giant bugs in the desert, the canyons, and the sea of bugs began to panic and search for food in a craze.</p>

  <p>But they couldn't find the food they needed, which only fed their anxiety.</p>

  <p>But as they went deeper into the cave of the sea of bugs, all the originally motionless giant bugs in the other broad space suddenly started to surge.</p>

  <p>They began to devour the light of the whole world.</p>

  <p>"Devouring three seconds is enough." Zheng's thought spread to the minds of the countless giant bugs.</p>

  <p>Once the thought was spread out, strange things began to be found all over the divine land.</p>

  <p>A True God had just killed a monster, but in the blink of an eye, it had returned to an unharmed state.</p>

  <p>In a battle ring, a proving godly warrior used his most powerful skill to punch his opponent and cause him to spit out blood. But all the blood disappeared in a flash.</p>

  <p>In a tavern, someone had eaten a dish in one swallow, and there was still some flavor left in his mouth. But in a trice, the dish was still on the table, unmoved.</p>

  <p>Such strange things occurred all over the divine land. Even the Holy Beings were unable to avoid it.</p>

  <p>And all these happened at the moment Nelly was killed.</p>

  <p>But Nelly was now standing right there before Zheng, without any injuries.</p>

  <p>The three consummate True Gods looked at each other, their weapons dangling limply in their hands.</p>

  <p>Rachelle's eyes widened in surprise. This was completely beyond her comprehension.</p>

  <p>Nelly looked at herself, confused. She didn't know what had happened.</p>

  <p>She could feel the cold weapons cutting into her body. Why was she restored to her previous condition in the blink of an eye?</p>

  <p>'Have we gone back in time?'</p>

  <p>But Nelly rejected this thought almost immediately.</p>

  <p>Time backtracking could only be used on the martial artist who activated it. And people couldn't use the Godly Way in this world. Moreover, she hadn't felt any internal momentum.</p>
