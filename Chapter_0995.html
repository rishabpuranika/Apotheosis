<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 995 Yudie Survived </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Yudie slightly squinted her eyes. She felt a throbbing headache and her vision was blurry.</p>

  <p>This happened every time one's soul had been injured. It was as if one was drunk and prone to hallucinations.</p>

  <p>She could see Zheng.</p>

  <p>He was special to her and she missed him like never before. She realized she was hallucinating. She felt weak and like she was on the verge of death.</p>

  <p>Yudie felt disappointed and regretted feeling so overconfident. She thought she could survive this life-and-death tribulation, but now it seemed that she wouldn't be able to do so. How could she be so stupid?</p>

  <p>She wished she could see Zheng again. The illusion of him made her feel warm and gave her a bit of strength.</p>

  <p>After her being attacked by countless nightmares, illusions had formed in her mind. Those petals looked normal to others, but to her they were all strange beasts with various shapes and sizes. Zheng was now in one of those nightmares.</p>

  <p>Zheng's figure appeared and quickly approached her.</p>

  <p>Yudie extended her arms and hugged him.</p>

  <p>Yudie had always thought highly of herself. She occupied a high status, much higher than Zheng's. After all she was the master and owner of the Cloud Hall. However, even though she was at a higher level, she had always liked Zheng since they were on the Cloud Road.</p>

  <p>Right now she couldn't even bare to think about it. It was just the illusion of Zheng. It was not the real him.</p>

  <p>Zheng was tall but not sturdy. With his training, he had grown one or two inches taller over the past two years, and surpassed Yudie by a full head.</p>

  <p>All she wanted was to embrace Zheng. As she reached for the illusion of him, a tragic and miserable smile appeared on her face. She would think of Zheng as death came to her. His image comforted her even though she felt like she had done nothing good. The illusion of Zheng was better than no Zheng at all.</p>

  <p>Zheng saw that Yudie couldn't hold on any longer. As the fear of losing her came over him, he flew to her holding the Heavenly Fragment in his hand. As soon as he got to her, Yudie hugged him affectionately, leaving Zheng awestruck.</p>

  <p>Zheng held Yudie in his arms and activated the Heavenly Fragment using the method that Xun taught him.</p>

  <p>She told him that this Heavenly Fragment was very special and had very unique features. It could absorb an enormous amount of life vitality. She also warned him against causing a large fluctuation. All he needed to do was apply enough life vitality for it to work.</p>

  <p>As Zheng injected a bit of life vitality into the Heavenly Fragment, it started to absorb those petals as greedily as a giant whale.</p>

  <p>Xun had also told Zheng that the Heavenly Tribulation was induced by the Nature and that it could be easily absorbed by the Heavenly Fragment. The two opposing heavenly forces mutually reinforced and neutralized each other.</p>

  <p>It worked almost immediately and much better than what Zheng expected.</p>

  <p>The petals were gone in the blink of an eye. Luckily, there was no other threat falling down from the sky. The life-and-death tribulation was finally over.</p>

  <p>Yudie leaned on Zheng's chest with her eyes closed. She looked pale and pained but with a faint smile on her face. From time to time she would shake her head as if disappointed.</p>

  <p>Zheng landed on the ground of the Ice Palace and sat down cross-legged.</p>

  <p>He placed Yudie on his lap, quickly took out an emerald green pill and stuffed it into Yudie's mouth. He also took some soul-healing pills that would help Yudie recover. When he left the Sea God Continent, Miguel and the others gave him pills and other potent drugs as presents.</p>

  <p>This was one of those pills from the Sea God Continent and you couldn't tell which level it belonged to by simply looking at it. It was said that this pill was made according to a prescription found inside the Dark Nether Cave and that it was more potent than any of the drugs made in the Central Region.</p>

  <p>When Zheng stuffed the pill into Yudie's mouth, she frowned disapprovingly. She tried to spit out the pill but Zheng forced her to swallow it. Then, with some hesitation he patted her stomach gently with the palm of his hand.</p>

  <p>These kinds of pills needed the help of life vitality to dissolve completely and take effect.</p>

  <p>Yudie, who was in a semi-coma, couldn't use her life vitality to dissolve the pill. Zheng had no other option but to help her.</p>

  <p>So he rested his hand on Yudie's flat belly, touching her smooth and soft skin. Then, he released his life vitality. Yudie didn't resist. She was too weak to put up a fight even though her power was strong enough to prevent Zheng's life vitality from entering her body.</p>

  <p>As Zheng poured his life vitality into Yudie's body, the pill began to dissolve and take effect. A faint fragrance was coming out of her body.</p>

  <p>Yudie rested her head on Zheng's chest and fell asleep.</p>

  <p>Zheng was worried that Yudie's soul had been damaged and couldn't recover. She seemed fine, though. He trusted that Xun knew the right time she had chosen for him to rescue Yudie.</p>

  <p>As soon as Yudie fell asleep, three people barged into the Ice Palace.</p>

  <p>It was Morphens who was taking two elders of the Cloud Hall to investigate what happened inside the Ice Palace.</p>

  <p>The life-and-death tribulation had ended and they desperately wanted to find out whether Yudie had survived or not. Yudie's safety would determine the Could Hall's fate.</p>

  <p>While Yudie was challenging the life-and-death tribulation, she gave an order out to forbid anyone from entering the Ice Palace. Morphens had tried to stop Zheng from going inside. It was too dangerous.</p>

  <p>And he didn't want anything or anyone to distract Yudie.</p>

  <p>Now that the life-and-death tribulation had been over, they wanted to make sure Yudie was alive and well. They needed to see her safe.</p>

  <p>As Morphens and the two elders entered the room, they saw Yudie resting her head on Zheng's chest and sleeping. They couldn't hide the shocked expressions on their faces. Now they realized that rumors going around about the love affair between Zheng and Yudie might be real.</p>

  <p>Yudie's personal life and love affairs were none of their business. They were her subjects and weren't in the right position to give an order to Yudie, less so to tell her what was right or wrong.</p>

  <p>Before Morphens could open his mouth and say anything, Zheng held up a finger to silence him.</p>

  <p>The three of them understood what Zheng meant. They nodded their heads and exited the hall quietly.</p>

  <p>After what happened, Yudie had passed the life-and-death tribulation.</p>

  <p>She had ascended and now she was a warrior of the Life and Death Realm.</p>

  <p>Even though Yudie had only survived one life-and-death tribulation, her cultivation method was very special. When she was only in the early stage of Virtual Tribulation Realm, she was almost as powerful as Morphens. Now, after entering the Life and Death Realm, even though she was still at its lower level, Zheng believed that she would be formidable. She could be a match to most of the Life and Death Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>Yudie was sound asleep in his arms. Her soft body felt like it weighed nothing. She weighted less than a feather.</p>

  <p>As the first rays of dawn lit up the sky, Yudie's thick eyelashes trembled slightly, and her brows were once again locked in a deep frown. She woke up with the rising of a new day.</p>

  <p>Her mind once foggy, had become clearer. She felt awake and as she moved she felt there was someone next to her. She reached out and her fingers grasped someone's clothes. She was struck with confusion.</p>

  <p>"Am I still alive?" she thought to herself.</p>

  <p>She took a deep breath as if to make sure she could breathe. She opened her beautiful eyes abruptly and that was when she saw Zheng's handsome face. She felt a rush coming over her and her whole body trembled.</p>

  <p>Zheng opened his eyes and saw her awake. He was sitting there and cultivating his martial arts. When he saw Yudie staring at him he felt relieved. He smiled and said, "You're awake!"</p>

  <p>Yudie pursed her lips. She still couldn't believe what she was seeing.</p>

  <p>She was afraid Zheng was still an illusion, and that him sitting beside her was not real.</p>

  <p>She did not loathe illusions because at least illusions made her happy.</p>

  <p>She hoped that she could reach for him, even though it was just an illusion that she was staring at. Illusions lasted only for a moment and she wouldn't want to make him disappear.</p>

  <p>"Say something." Zheng said with a strange and worried expression on his face. Could it be that her soul had been damaged and her brain injured?</p>

  <p>Yudie looked up at the enormous hole overhead. The clouds above were drifting slowly, sending dazzling rays of light. The morning air was mixed with a wild and chaotic energy from both Heaven and Earth.</p>

  <p>It wasn't an illusion.</p>

  <p>It was Zheng. He had come back to her.</p>

  <p>As she realized this, the corners of her mouth curled up. Her heart was filled with joy. She wanted to laugh loudly but her eyes suddenly turned red and she started crying compulsively.</p>

  <p>Zheng was confused. Why was she crying? She was alive. The life-and-death tribulation had ended and she survived it. She had grown even more powerful than before. Why was she crying? 'Is it possible that her brain was severely damaged?' he thought worriedly. Now she was laughing and crying at the same time. 'What the hell is wrong with her?'</p>
