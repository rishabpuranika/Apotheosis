  <p>
</p>

  <p>Except for Geoffrey, Luo Zheng hadn't seen anyone else who could read Sanskrit so well, not even his own mother.</p>

  <p>Of course, Luo Zheng couldn't either.</p>

  <p>He had no knowledge of Sanskrit whatsoever, and the golden Sanskrit words were incomprehensible to him.</p>

  <p>While Luo Zheng was puzzling over the text, the speed at which the golden Sanskrit words spun became faster and faster. Soon they spun so fast that they resembled a rotating bowl of golden juice, splashing around and forming strange images in the air.</p>

  <p>These images only existed for a moment before they disappeared without a trace, like mirages.</p>

  <p>About hundreds of images had appeared and disappeared in the course of three seconds.</p>

  <p>"What are these images?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stared at the changing images, trying to understand.</p>

  <p>This time, No. 9527 just kept silent.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng hadn't been chosen by the master for nothing. Surely, he must have extraordinary abilities. So No. 9527 knew to keep its thoughts to itself and let Luo Zheng take the lead.</p>

  <p>And if Luo Zheng couldn't comprehend the images, it would only prove that the master had chosen wrong.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng furrowed his eyebrows as he stared at the constantly changing images in front of him. He was lost in deep thought.</p>

  <p>Although this No. 9527 fellow's origin was suspicious, Luo Zheng did not think it was a liar. He believed that the bloodline theurgy No. 9527 had mentioned could be found in these images.</p>

  <p>How much insight he could get all depended on his ability to decode the images.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Zheng had reached the True God Realm, his understanding of the various theurgies and cultivation methods had improved significantly.</p>

  <p>He had discovered that even the three thousand Divine Dao were just different kinds of energy that could be expressed by various different methods.</p>

  <p>The Wild God Power, too, was just another form of energy. What made it different, however, was that it depended more on inheritance, because the power of Wild Gods came not from themselves, but from the energy that had been extracted from the countless wild bones, which was known as the Wild God Power.</p>

  <p>After a moment of silence, a ray of light appeared in Luo Zheng's eyes.</p>

  <p>"These images are instructions! They show me how to use energy!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng concluded.</p>

  <p>Hearing Luo Zheng's conclusion, No. 9527 felt relieved and impressed. 'This guy...' it thought, smiling to itself. 'It took him no time to figure that out!' it gushed in his mind.</p>

  <p>Despite being only a small brain unit, No. 9527 acted like a vessel for the memory of its master. It had little authority, but that did not reflect its value. It, after all, had been chosen to represent the Chaos Ancient God.</p>

  <p>Truth was the most basic component of chaos, and it was not easy to grasp it.</p>

  <p>Even if one managed to learn what they perceived to be the truth, what they had actually understood was but a tiny fraction of the entire truth.</p>

  <p>And yet, they would still benefit greatly from it.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng had realized what these images meant, his mind suddenly became clear. Now he knew the direction in which he should think, instead of being lost in the middle of a four-way street, not knowing which path to choose.</p>

  <p>Soon, he descended completely into meditation.</p>

  <p>Inside the cave, Luo Zheng's huge body lay motionless on the ground.</p>

  <p>Adele floated above Luo Zheng's head. Her eyes flashed with a faint glow, and her nervous expression gradually calmed down as she observed him.</p>

  <p>He looked as if he had fallen into the deep sleep of a meditation state.</p>

  <p>Adele naturally couldn't figure out why he was in such a state, but as long as he was safe, it didn't matter.</p>

  <p>However, Adele hadn't thought that Luo Zheng would remain lying there for over ten days.</p>

  <p>In fact, he remained there for over half a month.</p>

  <p>With the new moon, Luo Zheng's huge body suddenly trembled, and the light ball surrounding his soul suddenly shattered into smithereens. A dark green light constantly flickered from his chest, emitting an intimidating aura.</p>

  <p>The aura was so strong that even the airtight bone tower couldn't resist. It shook violently.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the depths of the Sky Spirit Bone Tower, Timotheus, Ramzi, and many other exiles all opened their eyes simultaneously, disbelief all over their faces.</p>

  <p>This was the second time Luo Zheng had endured the Body Tribulations, so they knew it wouldn't be a challenge for him. Naturally, they did not deem the situation worthy of their attention. However, they had not expected Luo Zheng to change so drastically after becoming a top-rank Wild God.</p>

  <p>"What happened?"</p>

  <p>"Even I must admit...I am afraid of this aura!"</p>

  <p>"Is it some kind of Truth of Godly Way?"</p>

  <p>The exiles had relied on the boat of the truth to reach the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>Their understanding of energy, and how to use it to their advantage, had reached a new level, far beyond that of ordinary creatures.</p>

  <p>Honestly speaking, the energy Luo Zheng gave out was not so powerful itself, far from enough to frighten them. The only thing that could explain their reaction was that the energy was of a nature they had, hitherto, never seen. And the unknown can be, at times, much more frightening than the powerful.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh..."</p>

  <p>Several exiles appeared before Luo Zheng in a synchronized fashion.</p>

  <p>Staring at Luo Zheng below them, their expressions were hard to decipher.</p>

  <p>"What kind of energy is that?" Ramzi asked, staring at the green light radiating from Luo Zheng's chest.</p>

  <p>Timotheus shook his head. "I don't know," he said pensively. "But I am sure this energy is not the bloodline theurgy of our Nine Li race..."</p>

  <p>Then, something occurred to him. "Could it be..."</p>

  <p>He trailed off into silence, but Ramzi, Leopold and the others knew what he was thinking. Their expressions looked lost, buried deep in thought.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng hadn't displayed this ability before, but now, after he had just gone through the Body Tribulations another time and become a top-rank Wild God, he was able to finally display it. Luo Zheng had, furthermore, absorbed the bloodline of the Chaos Ancient God.</p>

  <p>The most likely explanation was clear to them. Luo Zheng had activated the bloodline theurgy of the Chaos Ancient God.</p>

  <p>"Timotheus, have you heard of anyone who has managed to gain the Chaos Ancient God's bloodline theurgy?" Ramzi asked through his life vitality.</p>

  <p>Timotheus shook his head. "No..."</p>

  <p>Among those in the Source World, the Chaos Ancient God was an existence that all races looked up to.</p>

  <p>Although there had been countless talents that had appeared in the Source World throughout the years, they had still been unable to reach the level of the Chaos Ancient God, mostly due to the limitations of times.</p>

  <p>Of course, it might have well been because the level of the exiles had not been high enough, or because the top figures in the Source World were not like what they had imagined.</p>

  <p>While the exiles pondered over these questions, Luo Zheng suddenly opened his eyes.</p>

  <p>Exhaling deeply, he rolled over to get onto his feet. Although he tried to keep himself calm, the excitement in his eyes was obvious.</p>

  <p>"Master Timotheus, Master Ramzi, Master Leopold..." he whispered fervently.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng spread his arms, making the Wild God Power dissipate. After shrinking back into his normal size, he flew up to them, cupping his hands.</p>

  <p>"Congratulations on breaking through again. It seems like you have gained a lot. I'm curious, what was that energy just now, the one coming from your chest?" Timotheus said with a smile.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did not have any reservations concerning Timotheus and the others.</p>

  <p>After all, they were of the same race as him, and they had known each other for so long. He knew they could be trusted.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stretched out his hand towards Timotheus and opened his palm. An emerald green light lit up like a flame, dancing in the palm of his hand. It circled around, and formed a small emerald green block. "Is this the energy that you asked about?"</p>
