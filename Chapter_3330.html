  <p>
</p>

  <p>While Ajay flew backward, Luo Zheng followed him, and timed his next punch just right.</p>

  <p>Ajay tried to regain his footing, so he could stop himself after being knocked back. But Luo Zheng's punch stopped him from doing that. He tried to catch Luo Zheng's fist, but Luo Zheng altered his fist's trajectory and hit him in the face.</p>

  <p>If it were any other creature, this punch would have shattered its skull.</p>

  <p>However, Ajay's bone structure was dense. He was fairly powerful, so Luo Zheng kept hammering away with his fists.</p>

  <p>"Dong!"</p>

  <p>"Dong!"</p>

  <p>"Dong!"</p>

  <p>With three strong punches, Luo Zheng smashed Ajay into the big pit at the precipice of the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>But the Golden Body race was indeed tough. Even though he'd taken a lot of damage, Ajay's breath control was unaffected. But, no matter. They knew who had won this time. Ajay said dejectedly, "I admit defeat."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked down at him in the pit and said, "You're not worth the trouble it would take to slay you? I'll spare your life, this time."</p>

  <p>A serious look suddenly appeared on Ajay's face. He said, "You are a brave man to defeat me. Makes me sorry I have to do this. I respect you, but I promised the Bearing race you would die."</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, a golden bone appeared in his hand. It looked like a rib. Then, without another word, he plunged it into his chest.</p>

  <p>"Howl!" A dazzling golden light burst from Ajay's eyes, and his momentum soared once more!</p>

  <p>So engrossed in what was going on, the members of the Golden Body race took a bit to notice something strange. The six members also held golden bones. They stabbed these bones into their chests and roared. Their momentum went sky high as well.</p>

  <p>The Golden Body race was one of the strongest races of Stage Thirteen. Not only did they have the golden hammer, they also had 22 Golden Battle Bones.</p>

  <p>Before the chaos where they lived was destroyed, the hammer transformed them, so they all possessed a golden body. The hammer was certain it couldn't escape the disaster, so it disintegrated its body. After that, it sent its arm and leg bones and ribs to the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Once the Golden Body race stabbed themselves with the Golden Battle Bone, it would give them great power almost instantly, but only for five minutes. When the power boost wore off, they would die.</p>

  <p>Ajay would honor his vow, even if it killed him. He had promised to kill Luo Zheng, so he used the Golden Battle Bone to achieve this goal.</p>

  <p>This time, though, he had backup. He made a deal with some other members. If he couldn't handle Luo Zheng, he would use the Golden Battle Bone.</p>

  <p>And the six who followed him would do the same, and gang up on Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Surely he couldn't handle them all!</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Ajay only had five minutes to live. No matter what, he would kill Luo Zheng in this period of time. He jumped up and tried to hit his opponent at an astonishing speed.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes widened in surprise, but he still dodged to the side almost reflexively. Ajay's punch only grazed him, but left ugly, bleeding slashes where it screamed past him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng narrowly evaded Ajay's attack, but the other six members of the Golden Body race had already surrounded him.</p>

  <p>These six were weaker than Ajay, but with the support of the Golden Battle Bones, they could not be underestimated. They could strike with the force of one thousand Jun without breaking a sweat.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng used the Shade Stone liquid, he might be able to survive this. But he didn't have it on his corporeal body on the Other Shore. That was why he was noticeably weaker. If one of them landed a blow, he might be gravely wounded. And he faced seven foes. Things were looking grim.</p>

  <p>"Haha... Looks like that guy will finally die!"</p>

  <p>"We can't fail now! The Golden Body race is indeed trustworthy!"</p>

  <p>"I think Ajay can take him now, especially with six of his buddies."</p>

  <p>When they saw Ajay lose to Luo Zheng, the members of the Bearing race were depressed. If the Golden Body race couldn't take this guy out, then maybe no one on Stage Thirteen could. Was he invincible?</p>

  <p>They didn't expect things would change in the blink of an eye. And they were happy to see it. Once Luo Zheng was killed, they would be able to leave the Other Shore and report this good news to their elders.</p>

  <p>In the Dark Region, Ling Shuang was filled with anxiety.</p>

  <p>She wanted to leave the Dark Region and rush to his aid. But Feng Ge wouldn't let her. She was trapped there by her circle of light, and Feng Ge refused to budge.</p>

  <p>"So how do we fix this? Luo Zheng may not be able to beat them!" Ling Shuang said anxiously.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge blinked. "But he said he could handle it on his own!"</p>

  <p>Ling Shuang glared at her. She had a feeling Feng Ge was not in her right mind.</p>

  <p>Certainly she was different from how she used to be. And now Ling Shuang had a sinking feeling she was correct in her assessment. Anyone could see that Luo Zheng was in danger.</p>

  <p>"How? Seven on one? He's going to die!" Ling Shuang shouted angrily.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge finally understood what she meant. She raised her eyebrows and repeated, "Going to die..."</p>

  <p>This aroused worry for Luo Zheng in her heart, and she started walking to the edge of the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>"Hey! Take me with you!" Ling Shuang yelled hurriedly.</p>

  <p>"Take you with me? Why? You seem pretty useless." Feng Ge took one last look at Ling Shuang and rushed out.</p>

  <p>Ling Shuang was in the form of a Soul of Light. She couldn't help Luo Zheng in that form. She was no match for any member of the Golden Body race, much less any who had thrust the Golden Battle Bone into their chests.</p>

  <p>Members of the Bearing race, the Divine Farmer race, and the Jin Wu? all Souls of Light themselves? were cheering from a safe distance.</p>

  <p>The remaining members of the Golden Body race wore a sad expression.</p>

  <p>Seven members of their race were going to die, no matter whether they beat Luo Zheng or not.</p>

  <p>Just then, they saw a figure walking out of the Dark Region. This person was not the Soul of Light who had previously entered the Dark Region, but another woman.</p>

  <p>"Who is she?"</p>

  <p>"Is she from the Other Shore? Or the Dark Region? She's a human!"</p>

  <p>"What a stunning woman! She's the hottest girl I've ever seen!"</p>

  <p>Feng Ge was clad in clothes woven of light, her long legs bare. Her delicate features had a touch of innocence. Everyone could feel her aura, an aura of a unique and extraordinary charm.</p>

  <p>She drew everyone's gaze. From the Bearing race to the Divine Farmer race. But she was about to stun everyone with what she said next.</p>

  <p>Her voice was loud and clear as she addressed Luo Zheng. "I'm here to help you!"</p>

  <p>When the warriors who were busy surrounding Luo Zheng saw Feng Ge, their faces darkened. Was this woman a denizen of the Other Shore? Or did she come from the Dark Region? None of those combatants were happy.</p>

  <p>Then, everyone saw Feng Ge gently wave her finger, and an ethereal voice rang in their ears, saying, "Great Sanskrit Light!"</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>A thin light column spread to engulf everything, and the environment turned incandescent. Everyone was blinded by this. Their surroundings, and everything in their vision was a bright white.</p>

  <p>When the light dissipated, their vision returned to normal.</p>

  <p>The Souls of Light from the Bearing race, the Divine Farmer race and the Jin Wu were still shivering, while those from the Golden Body race looked confused.</p>

  <p>The bright light was indeed astonishing, but it did not harm anyone.</p>

  <p>That woman shone her light on others.</p>

  <p>What kind of token was she using?</p>
