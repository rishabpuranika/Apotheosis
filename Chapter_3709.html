<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>These mice were gigantic. Their faces looked ferocious, and their bean-sized eyes were fixated on them.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing the unfriendly gazes of these giant mice, Luo Zheng said, "Doyle, I don't think the Ear Mouse race is here."</p>

  <p>The Ear Mouse race had entered the Other Shore in the form of Souls of Light, and Luo Zheng had been on good terms with them.</p>

  <p>Now that he couldn't see any Ear Mouse here, Luo Zheng felt something was amiss.</p>

  <p>"Most Souls of Light don't stay in Stage Twenty-eight of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>The Ear Mouse race will also choose to stay in the Constant Glory Stage to pass the test of the Soul City. If it weren't for you and Princess Feng Ge, I wouldn't have come either," answered Doyle.</p>

  <p>"But these giant mice..." Luo Zheng said hesitantly.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry, Luo Zheng. These are members of the Twilight Mouse race. They take orders from the Ear Mouse race, so there is no problem," said Doyle, who then took the lead and entered the cave ahead of Luo Zheng and Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge glanced at Luo Zheng and smiled faintly. "Don't be suspicious. Let's go in too!" she said.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stood still on the spot for a moment. It was as if he was communicating with someone. Before long, the deep creases in his brows smoothened, and he raised his legs and strode forward to catch up with Feng Ge. His steps were now firm.</p>

  <p>Mice were good at digging holes underground. The Twilight Mouse race had been living in Stage Twenty-eight of the Other Shore for several chaotic eras.</p>

  <p>The underground world of Stage Twenty-eight of the Other Shore was even more complicated than the Forbidden Rain City, but the Twilight Mouse race had obviously become the hegemony here.</p>

  <p>After the three of them entered the cave, a Twilight Mouse reached out and gently pressed the wall of the cave.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>With a series of reverberating booming noises, a huge rock rolled down at a slow speed and fell right at the entrance, sealing the entrance tightly.</p>

  <p>The moment the entrance of the cave was sealed, the inside of the cave immediately darkened.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>As soon as the cave fell into darkness, several dots of flames appeared at their sights.</p>

  <p>Several Twilight Mice were holding torches in their hands, illuminating the surroundings with ease.</p>

  <p>"Princess Feng Ge, Luo Zheng, please," said Doyle, stretching out his hand and making a "please gesture" towards the cave.</p>

  <p>The cave near the surface of the mountain was very spacious. The Twilight Mouse race seemed to have even leveled the ground inside the cave, because the road ahead looked quite flat.</p>

  <p>After about dozens of miles, however, the cave became increasingly narrow.</p>

  <p>In some places, only one person could pass at one time.</p>

  <p>Although the bodies of the Twilight Mice were huge, it didn't affect their agility. They could pass these narrow areas in a flash, while Luo Zheng and Feng Ge had to spend more time doing the same.</p>

  <p>Half a day later, they had traveled more than a hundred miles underground.</p>

  <p>After walking in the narrow cave for so long, Feng Ge finally asked impatiently, "Why haven't we arrived at the destination, Doyle?"</p>

  <p>"Princess Feng Ge, the Forbidden Rain City is very large. We have to cross more than half of the city to go to the northwest corner, so it will take some time," replied Doyle.</p>

  <p>"Squeak! Don't worry, we'll arrive soon. Why are you this anxious?" one member of the Twilight Mouse race said coldly.</p>

  <p>Doyle turned around and gave the Twilight Mouse a fierce glare. The Twilight Mouse lowered its head and fell silent.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge blinked her eyes and looked at Luo Zheng quietly. No matter how obtuse she was, she could sense that something was wrong at this moment.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng secretly winked at her, signaling her to keep silent.</p>

  <p>Doyle was a member of the Taiyi Heaven Palace. If he betrayed the Taiyi Heaven Palace, he definitely wouldn't be able to leave alive, so he wouldn't do such a thing.</p>

  <p>Therefore, there were only two possibilities. One was that the Doyle in front of Luo Zheng and Feng Ge was a fake, and the other was that Doyle's Soul of Light was controlled by someone else.</p>

  <p>As for these Twilight Mice, they most likely had nothing to do with the Ear Mouse race.</p>

  <p>"Primeval Lord of Heaven, now, I'm afraid there's really something wrong with this," Luo Zheng said in his mind.</p>

  <p>In fact, he had already felt that something was amiss when they were outside the Forbidden Rain City. At that time, he had wanted to remind Feng Ge and refuse Doyle's request, but the Primeval Lord of Heaven told Luo Zheng in his mind that he shouldn't take any action right away.</p>

  <p>Now that they had spent such a long time traveling underground, they were most likely heading to trouble, so Luo Zheng naturally hoped that the Primeval Lord of Heaven would show up and solve the problem.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said calmly. "It's only Stage Twenty-eight of the Other Shore. I can handle it."</p>

  <p>In the Creation Myth Temple, the Primeval Lord of Heaven had only used one finger to kill those Moon Fire Slaves.</p>

  <p>At that time, the strength of the Moon Fire Slaves was indeed suppressed, but so was the Primeval Lord of Heaven's. As long as he didn't encounter any genuinely powerful warrior of the Element Spirit race, he still had some ways to cope.</p>

  <p>"Don't listen to the nonsense of these mice. After all, they are just animals.</p>

  <p>Haha," Doyle explained and then continued to lead the way.</p>

  <p>After passing through those narrow parts, the road ahead gradually became wide again.</p>

  <p>Soon afterward, the three of them and the Twilight Mice arrived at a circular cave. The walls of the cave had been carefully carved. Instead of a cave, the place where they were now looked more like a magnificent palace.</p>

  <p>As soon as Luo Zheng and Feng Ge entered the cave, Doyle said, "We are under the star rings."</p>

  <p>"We can enter our star ring after we go up?" asked Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>"Yes, you're right," Doyle said, nodding his head. "But it's a pity that you won't have the chance to go up alive..."</p>

  <p>"Dong dong dong..."</p>

  <p>There were six passages around the circular cave. The sounds of heavy footsteps echoed from those passages, and green light also spread from inside them. Very soon, Moon Fire Slaves with green flames burning on their bodies flooded out of the passages.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge took a step back and leaned against Luo Zheng. She frowned and glared at Doyle. "Doyle, what do you mean by this?"</p>

  <p>With a smirk, Doyle said, "Nothing serious. Someone wants to take your lives, and I just brought you here as required."</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, those Moon Fire Slaves entered the cave.</p>

  <p>The temperature in the whole cave continued to rise.</p>

  <p>"Are you really Doyle?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's calmness made Doyle somewhat flustered and even a little apprehensive. In an impatient tone, he said, "Whether I'm Doyle or not, what does it have to do with you?"</p>

  <p>"I'm just curious. Doyle's still a member of the Taiyi Heaven Palace. If he betrays the Taiyi Heaven Palace, he won't be able to survive. This being the case, you're most likely not Doyle," Luo Zheng said in a flat tone.</p>

  <p>"Haha! I'm not him? so?"</p>

  <p>The shape of Doyle's Soul of Light gradually changed, and his voice also turned sharper. Although his face couldn't be seen clearly, it was obvious that he had changed into another person.</p>

  <p>As it turned out, someone else's Soul of Light had been disguising as Doyle.</p>

  <p>"If you're Doyle, I can show you some mercy. But since you're not, you're doomed to death," Luo Zheng replied indifferently.</p>

  <p>"Really? Haha... Then you'd better see if you can survive first!" The man took a step back while pointing at Luo Zheng and Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>The Moon Fire Slaves, who had been approaching them slowly, now rushed over from different directions.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, we have no other choice but to fight!" Feng Ge squinted and said.</p>

  <p>Just as she was about to rush towards one of the passages, Luo Zheng stretched his hand, grabbed her wrist, and pulled it gently. At the same time, a shadow appeared on his forehead.</p>
