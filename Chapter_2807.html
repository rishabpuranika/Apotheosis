<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Stop!" the girl shouted as she chased after Jeremiah.</p>

  <p>Jeremiah heard the childish voice and felt annoyed.</p>

  <p>He wondered why the girl had chosen to go after him among so many people.</p>

  <p>It was indeed fortunate that she only had very little wisdom. Otherwise, with her ability, she could kill everyone in an instant.</p>

  <p>At this moment, he was feeling frustrated. The girl kept chasing him. She wanted his life.</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh...</p>

  <p>The girl was much faster than him. The distance between them quickly closed.</p>

  <p>"Everyone, please help!"</p>

  <p>Jeremiah cried out as he circled in the void. He then rushed towards the alliance of the rich and powerful clans.</p>

  <p>The other warriors heard him, but they were all aware of the girl's strength.</p>

  <p>They were all eager to avoid being attacked.</p>

  <p>How would they possibly help him?</p>

  <p>The red-eyed girl was persistent and continued to go after Jeremiah, not minding where the chase had led them.</p>

  <p>She lifted her little hand and gently waved, and then red lotuses constantly bloomed behind Jeremiah as he fled.</p>

  <p>Although the red lotuses didn't burn Jeremiah, the temperature they gave off was so unbearable that even the body of a Holy Being could not stand it.</p>

  <p>Jeremiah was having a hard time to deal with them as his mind was troubled to find an escape.</p>

  <p>"Jeremiah, come to me!" Nicholas urged.</p>

  <p>Jeremiah was desperate for help at the moment, and as soon as he heard Nicholas' voice, he felt excited and rushed to him directly!</p>

  <p>Nicholas then slightly clapped his hands.</p>

  <p>His left hand turned into thin threads of white silk, and his right hand turned into thin threads of black silk.</p>

  <p>This action indicated that he had already completely infused the Truth of Dark and Light Chaos into his own internal momentum.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>The filaments looked frail, but there was an indescribable mystery in them.</p>

  <p>"I will trap the girl, and meanwhile, the other warriors can give it another try to attack her! This time, she might be subdued," Nicholas suggested.</p>

  <p>The red light ball and the blue light ball were complementary to each other, and that was why they were so strong.</p>

  <p>However, there was a limit to the energy within the light balls.</p>

  <p>He had been looking for a way to defeat the girl for a while but was unsuccessful in the end. There seemed to be no means to subdue the girl's power.</p>

  <p>He would have to adopt the previous method then!</p>

  <p>The woman's eyes suddenly lit up at Nicholas' suggestion. She asked with a slight doubt in her eyes, "But can you trap the girl?"</p>

  <p>She was still in doubt since they had clearly seen and witnessed what the girl could do. Just a moment ago, Clark was burnt to ashes just by a touch of the girl's body.</p>

  <p>The woman assumed nothing in the divine land could stop the girl.</p>

  <p>"How do you know if I don't give it a try?" Nicholas sounded determined.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>In a swift motion, Jeremiah was already on Nicholas' side.</p>

  <p>The girl focused all her attention on Jeremiah. She didn't even hear Nicholas and the others talking about how to deal with her.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Nicholas. We count on you now!"</p>

  <p>Jeremiah passed by Nicholas and heaved a deep sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>Nicholas' face hardened slightly. The white and black threads extended quickly and intertwined to form a huge net of Eight Diagrams.</p>

  <p>"Invisible energy, solid colors, dark and light mingling..." he mumbled.</p>

  <p>In the Source World, the Truth of Dark and Light Chaos was a very powerful Truth of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>As the girl approached, hot energy spread out and attacked the big Eight Diagrams net.</p>

  <p>The Truth of Dark and Light Chaos had one characteristic similar to the two girls.</p>

  <p>It was already known that the two girls were complementary to each other, as were the black threads and the white threads Nicholas created.</p>

  <p>"Trap!"</p>

  <p>He gave a shout.</p>

  <p>The big net suddenly turned and encircled the girl with red eyes.</p>

  <p>Just as the red-eyed girl was yet to be completely trapped, flames came out of the big net of Eight Diagrams and turned into red lotuses.</p>

  <p>However, hardly had the red lotuses formed than they were drawn into the large net and quickly dissipated!</p>

  <p>"Everybody, take action! I can't trap her for a long time!" Nicholas urged in a hurry.</p>

  <p>The others had already been waiting and prepared for a long time. As soon as Nicholas gave the order, they shot their attacks on the trapped girl in the Eight Diagrams net.</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...</p>

  <p>Rumble...</p>

  <p>Strong rays of light were cast down towards the girl, and she was instantly submerged by everyone's attacks.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>As the attacks went on, a blue line streaked through space and reached the blue-eyed girl, who was floating in the air.</p>

  <p>She and the red-eyed girl seemed to have two completely different personalities.</p>

  <p>She had been gazing at the crowd with indifference, making no noise at all.</p>

  <p>As the red-eyed girl was attacked, energy was being transferred and transmitted into the blue-eyed girl.</p>

  <p>Coldness had grown in her blue eyes.</p>

  <p>That woman's judgment was correct.</p>

  <p>Just like the energy of the two light balls, the energy of the two girls could also move.</p>

  <p>If one girl's energy was accumulated to a certain extent, it could also crush the girl.</p>

  <p>Yet there was a precondition that the other girl did not know how to release energy.</p>

  <p>It obviously wasn't going to happen here since the True Demon Body had acquired intelligence. Thus, when the chilly air in the blue-eyed girl's body was accumulated to a certain extent, she would instinctively vent it out.</p>

  <p>She looked around with her blue eyes.</p>

  <p>"The people there!"</p>

  <p>The girl with blue eyes spoke, as she raised her hand slightly, traces of pure and extreme energy circling around her fingers.</p>

  <p>The energy had been transformed from the attacks of the Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>After being transmitted to the body of the blue-eyed girl, it was enhanced, and the temperature was lowered to the extreme.</p>

  <p>Wisps of chilling aura could be detected from the energy.</p>

  <p>"Go away, all of you!"</p>

  <p>The blue-eyed girl was raging at the moment. She didn't have the concept of "death" yet, and she just subconsciously wanted to vent her energy on them.</p>

  <p>The freezing aura around her turned into ice flowers and spread out in the void at an incredible speed, producing clear and melodious sounds.</p>

  <p>But her words were not heard as most of the people were focused on the girl with red eyes.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't involve himself. He did not participate in attacking the red-eyed girl since so many people were already making a move. His action was not necessary at the moment.</p>
