  <p>
</p>

  <p>"En?"</p>

  <p>Edmond threw an indifferent glance at Luo Zheng who was floating like a leaf, surprise written all over his face. "What a wonderful bodily movement skill! It's interesting how he can use the momentum in such a way."</p>

  <p>In terms of bodily movement skill alone, the Eight Smoky Melodies was nothing in the divine land.</p>

  <p>It wasn't a token of the Divine Dao, after all.</p>

  <p>But when it was infused with the Truth of Divine Dao, it was a whole new game? Edmond was shocked.</p>

  <p>While in his eyes, the top-rank True Gods were rather insignificant, one of them had managed to wiggle his way out from under his feet.</p>

  <p>"Huh!"</p>

  <p>At the thought, Edmond's lips curled into a faint smile.</p>

  <p>Then, he rose up, his huge body towering his surroundings.</p>

  <p>His leap was somehow mountainous as he slammed his fist right at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Even if Luo Zheng fled extremely quickly, he still couldn't get rid of the giant on his tail.</p>

  <p>Looking at the huge figure above his head, Luo Zheng smiled bitterly? all he could do was to use the Eight Smoky Melodies again.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>With a giant, mountain-like body taking heavy steps, the whole debate venue shook.</p>

  <p>Even the bottom of the Sunrest Tree trembled slightly.</p>

  <p>The fiend's body came down with a loud sound and a hurricane swept over the mist, turning it into a mess.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was like a mosquito, flying wildly around the hurricane.</p>

  <p>From the way things looked, Edmond wasn't going all out in this fight against Luo Zheng. Instead, he was somehow mocking the man, trying to catch Luo Zheng with his bare hands like he would a bug.</p>

  <p>When Yan saw her brother in trouble, she spun and flew towards him without hesitation.</p>

  <p>"Run!"</p>

  <p>"No one is a match for him!"</p>

  <p>"We should've already left this place long ago!"</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The top-rank True Gods present, regardless of the disciples of the wealthy clans or the grassroots, were all frightened and they ran away in all directions.</p>

  <p>The True Gods of the alliance of wealthy clans started to hate the Dongfang Clan more? how could they be willing to risk their lives to help them? In the end, they scattered.</p>

  <p>"What should we do?"</p>

  <p>Solomon was anxious as he asked, seeing Luo Zheng in a life and death situation.</p>

  <p>The disciples of the wealthy clans were all gone.</p>

  <p>Even the grassroots True Gods had already run away.</p>

  <p>Now, only the Sword Clan's disciples, Yan, and the guy with soybean-like eyes remained.</p>

  <p>But there was another one? Enoch's stay took them by surprise.</p>

  <p>All the while, he had seemed like nothing more than a coward, but he showed no signs of running away.</p>

  <p>"Err... Shall we leave now?" whispered one of the disciples of the Sword Clan.</p>

  <p>"I think so. He's a real fiend! We cannot fight him on equal ground," another Sword Clan disciple said in resignation.</p>

  <p>It would've been a lie to say that they held no fear in their hearts? after becoming a True God, everyone cherished their lives dearly.</p>

  <p>Hearing that, Reinhard looked around indifferently as he said, "As members of the Sword Clan, you should know more about the meaning of the Calamity Sword like I do!"</p>

  <p>...</p>

  <p>In the Sword Clan, the Calamity Sword was known to all as a forbidden weapon.</p>

  <p>Although it was an extremely rare and powerful sword, no one there wanted to claim it.</p>

  <p>For its use, one had to pay with their own life? such was the price of this weapon.</p>

  <p>Once a member of the Sword Clan wielded this sword, they were marked as the sacrificed man.</p>

  <p>"For countless divine eras, anyone of our Sword Clan to receive the Calamity Sword has ended up dead." "Now that Luo Zheng has engraved his name on the top of the stone tablet," Reinhard said calmly. "Are you planning to go back like this with the Calamity Sword?"</p>

  <p>Compared to the other wealthy clans on the Floating Islands, the Sword Clan's rules were not particularly strict.</p>

  <p>No harsh restrictions were placed upon their disciples.</p>

  <p>So even if they fled with the Calamity Sword, they probably wouldn't have received much punishment? perhaps, they wouldn't have even been punished at all.</p>

  <p>But the Sword Clan put great importance to reputation and some of their disciples were more likely to die than to taint their names.</p>

  <p>Reinhard's words shocked all the members of the clan.</p>

  <p>"If you want to go, you may leave now," Reinhard said as a matter of fact.</p>

  <p>To that, everyone remained silent, and no one took a move.</p>

  <p>"In that case," Reinhard waved his hand forward. A red blood sword then appeared in his hand? it lashed on the ground with a swishing sound.</p>

  <p>"Do you have the courage to follow me?"</p>

  <p>The Calamity Sword was rather similar to the Blood Cursing Sword formed by Duke's blood essence.</p>

  <p>But the Blood Cursing Sword was employed by one's own blood essence? although it would be harmful to one's own body, it would only burn up to a certain limit and stop before it could become detrimental to one's life.</p>

  <p>But such was not the case with the Calamity Sword. Taking it out meant sacrificing oneself.</p>

  <p>Whizzing! Whizzing! Whizzing!</p>

  <p>With Reinhard taking the lead, Solomon and the other disciples drew their Calamity Swords.</p>

  <p>For a moment, Reinhard looked at the sword in his hand with a feeling of loneliness. Finally, he made up his mind and the Calamity Sword began ringing.</p>

  <p>"Ah! Ah!!!"</p>

  <p>It sounded like a baby's scream? it was terrifying.</p>

  <p>Reinhard's white and delicate face flushed with excitement? his skin grew with strange lines of blood as a wicked aura filled his eyes.</p>

  <p>Solomon and the other disciples started looking the same.</p>

  <p>"Soaring Sky Sword Array! Ready! Go!"</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Reinhard was the first to rush toward Edmond.</p>

  <p id="top_9">The others of the Sword Clan also rushed to the fiend in formation.</p>

  <p>Only two people were left at the bottom of the stone tablet, Enoch and the soybean-eyed guy.</p>

  <p>Looking into the distance indifferently, the soybean-eyed guy took out a small square package from his space ring that held two rough double-edged swords. He asked Enoch, "Why haven't you left?"</p>

  <p>Almost all the True Gods left immediately. The soybean-eyed guy was still surprised to see that Enoch had stayed.</p>

  <p>His face turned pale? he was clearly terrified. But in spite of his fear, he said in a low voice, "There is more than one enemy in the debate venue.</p>

  <p>I'm afraid running away rashly will lead me to a dead end."</p>

  <p>With one hand grasping a double-edged sword, the soybean-eyed guy smiled. "Staying here is also a dead end."</p>

  <p>But Enoch shook his head. "Not necessarily."</p>

  <p>The enemy before them was truly terrifying? Enoch had already heard all sorts of inconceivable rumors about the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>But he had a hunch that staying there gave him a purpose that was yet to be revealed.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'd like to think so."</p>

  <p>With a gentle smile, the soybean-eyed guy floated away showing no trace of fear in his expression.</p>

  <p>"Let's see how you escape this time!"</p>

  <p>A series of rough curses came from Edmond's throat.</p>

  <p>Having failed to land a hit to Luo Zheng for quite a while, Edmond had finally lost his patience.</p>

  <p>Blood-red lightning burst from his hand. It formed a whirlpool, completely restricting Luo Zheng within.</p>

  <p>He saw no window of escape as he watched Edmond's giant hand come towards him.</p>

  <p>"Damn!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng narrowed his eyes at the hand. He had nowhere to hide and all he could do now was withstand the blow.</p>

  <p>But right at this moment, a dazzling purple light suddenly flashed behind him.</p>

  <p>Yan's eyes were full of determination. When she crossed her hands, a purple shadow surrounded her.</p>
