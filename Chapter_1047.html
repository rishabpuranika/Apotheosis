</p>

  <p>And so he made a plan. When he entered Oracle City, he found a few, secret places and hid the remaining seven pieces of ancient jade in seven different locations. Only he knew where they were. No one else would be able to find and use them except him.</p>

  <p>However, he was now facing a dilemma. He did not expect Luo Luo Zheng to see through his plans so quickly. He fidgeted as he thought of the best way to answer his question. Luo Luo Zheng was quick to notice the beggar's hesitation, and he knew immediately that his speculation was right on the mark. He asked the question again, this time more sternly. "How many pieces of ancient jade are left? Where are they?"</p>

  <p>"I...I..." Hanson Li stuttered. He originally wanted Luo Luo Zheng to swear on his warrior spirit that he would live up to his promise. That way, he would have a guarantee that he would get what he wanted, even if he had to give up the seven pieces of the ancient jade. However, under Luo Zheng's severe expression, his tongue kept on trembling.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was getting more and more ticked off at the beggar's seeming refusal to answer. "The things that I have promised will definitely be fulfilled!" he assured him. "In the future, you will be a member of the Cloud Hall and you will be under its protection. Now answer my questions," he demanded.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did not want to waste a single more second bargaining. He needed to know how many more pieces of ancient jade the man had.</p>

  <p>"Seven! I still have seven pieces of ancient jade. I buried them all outside Oracle City." The words poured out quickly from Hanson Li's mouth.</p>

  <p>'Seven...'</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng felt the heavy weight of disappointment drop on him; the number was too small.</p>

  <p>He looked at Ning Yudie as she lay with her eyes closed. There had only been a small sliver of life energy in the piece of ancient jade. Only seven more would not be able to restore all of Yudie's life energy.</p>

  <p>However, it was better than nothing. If seven pieces of ancient jade were all that Hanson Li had, he would make sure to get all of them. He turned to the beggar and grabbed him by the shoulders. "Take me to them!" he said.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng flew at an unbelievable speed out of Oracle City. Under Hanson Li's guidance, he quickly dug out the seven pieces of ancient jade one by one, and then made his way back to the Heavenly Stellar Palace.</p>

  <p>He went straight to Ning Yudie and crushed the pieces of ancient jade as he did earlier, and life energy from them flowed into Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>He watched as her body took in the life energy. 'Still too little, ' he thought anxiously.</p>

  <p>He waited for a while. Ning Yudie still did not make a single move. Not a flutter of an eyelid, not a twitch of a finger. She lay motionless, sleeping like a child.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng merely stood there in a daze before he let out a faint sigh. "Not enough..." His voice trembled.</p>

  <p>At his words, Hanson Li tensed up. He understood that the pieces of ancient jade did not have much of an effect. His position in Cloud Hall was in danger. "You...you will keep your promise, won't you?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"The World Commercial Alliance will pay you 1, 000 supreme life vitality crystals," Luo Luo Zheng said absently. "But your jade didn't wake Tia up. I can't give you a low-grade sacred weapon."</p>

  <p>Hanson Li's faces lit up with joy at his answer.</p>

  <p>Even the Li Clan wouldn't be able to take out 1, 000 supreme life vitality crystals at its peak. Any third-grade clan, not counting those with ties to the Cloud Hall and the World Commercial Alliance, would not have many of these crystals in their possession.</p>

  <p>The sum of 1, 000 supreme life vitality crystals was enough to make him a nouveau riche. For Hanson Li, a warrior at nature level, it was more than enough for a reward. He would not dare ask for a low-grade sacred weapon anymore. He was already beyond satisfied with just the supreme life vitality crystals. Aside from this, a low-grade sacred weapon in his hands would only bring about a fatal disaster. He had really only been interested in the crystals since the very beginning.</p>

  <p>"But before you get them, there is one more thing you have to tell me.</p>

  <p>Where did these pieces of ancient jade come from?" Luo Luo Zheng asked and looked Hanson Li in the eye. Right now, this was his greatest concern.</p>

  <p>He had laid eyes on countless rare treasures in the Central Region.</p>

  <p>However, this was the first time that he had seen a piece of ancient jade that contained life energy. If Hanson Li could give him any clue, he was determined to go and find these pieces of ancient jade at all costs. He wouldn't just sit still and watch as Yudie's life energy dwindled.</p>

  <p>"Tell me," Luo Luo Zheng repeated when the man did not answer. "Tell me everything you know about these jades, and 1, 000 supreme life vitality crystals will be yours. You will also become an elite disciple of Cloud Hall."</p>

  <p>Now that the Heavenly Evil Sect and the Ethereal Spirit Sect had been annihilated, the Cloud Hall was the largest sect in the Central Region apart from the World Commercial Alliance. Even when the Cloud Hall was only a fourth-grade sect, warriors from the Central Region had all been rushing in like a flock of birds, and competition had only escalated from then.</p>

  <p>As a nature creature with a mediocre talent in martial arts cultivation, Hanson Li could never hope to enter Cloud Hall. However, right in front of him was an opportunity to change his fate. How could he let this chance go by?</p>
