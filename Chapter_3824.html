<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3824 One Opportunity </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Now that the sclerites were blocking her, the fox girl used her bloody hand to punch Zheng in the stomach again.</p>

  <p>Zheng had expected this and twisted his body to avoid the blow.</p>

  <p>A smile appeared at the corners of the fox girl's mouth. She had thought that Zheng's struggle would be in vain. But this time, Zheng also kicked at the ground, causing his whole body to be sent flying upwards.</p>

  <p>The moment he bounced upwards, the tired Chaotic Source Spirits in his body were instantly repaired.</p>

  <p>With a tell-tale swish, a cyan feather appeared above Zheng's head. The feather was from the Civilization Artifact of the Regal Jade Civilization.</p>

  <p>The moment this feather appeared, Zheng's agility increased by leaps and bounds.</p>

  <p>But this was far from enough.</p>

  <p>"Primeval Lord of Heaven!"</p>

  <p>The pages of the human race's blue book began to flip through and then it suddenly stopped, causing the green light somewhere in Zheng's inner world to flash.</p>

  <p>This was a pool built in the sky called the Phoenix Pool.</p>

  <p>After the Primeval Lord of Heaven had occupied Zheng's inner world, he had assigned many tasks to the humans. The Phoenix Pool was one of these tasks.</p>

  <p>The energy souls of the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the real Snake Goddess that remained were very weak. They had to make use of the Civilization Artifact of the human race.</p>

  <p>The light of the book began to suddenly shimmer, green ripples appearing on the Phoenix Pool. Streaks of green light rushed out of Zheng's inner world, blooming from the surface of Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>With the support of the two Civilization Artifacts, Zheng's speed suddenly increased multi-fold.</p>

  <p>The fox girl still wasn't taking Zheng seriously. She wanted to grab him and dismember him, which, in her opinion, would take her less than fifteen seconds.</p>

  <p>But the moment she made to grasp him, Zheng, like a slippery eel, slipped out of her way.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>He grabbed the fox girl from behind and threw her to the wall.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The fox girl's body was about to hit the wall when she bent her legs so that she ended up looking like she was striding across the wall. She stood there, horizontal and surprised, and said, "So your speed has increased! But it's still of no use. You can't hurt me with your strength. Your attack is just like a mere itch for me!"</p>

  <p>She kicked off the wall and turned her body upside down, aiming at Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>If this kick were to hit him, it would become very difficult for Zheng to escape or survive.</p>

  <p>But thanks to his increased speed, Zheng only had to tilt his shoulder slightly to dodge the powerful kick that contained over one hundred thousand divine megatons of power. The fox girl's attack spiraled out of control and landed on a different creature of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>The room of the hexagram array was not large enough for the Other Shore creature to escape the attack. And by the time he had realized the danger he was in, it was too late.</p>

  <p>Pop!</p>

  <p>The back of the fox girl's foot swept across the head of the Other Shore creature, causing it to explode into bubbles of blood. The Other Shore creature was now a headless corpse that shook violently for a while before falling to the ground. Blood flowed from the gaping hole in his neck.</p>

  <p>The other creatures of the Other Shore trembled like rabbits coming face to face with a wolf. They didn't dare resist, only praying that Zheng would kill this monster.</p>

  <p>They couldn't react and move fast enough. Even if they remained curled up in the corner, they would be injured or killed during the battle if they didn't pay attention. This was worse than risking their lives and fighting the battle.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, two Other Shore creatures had used their unique methods. One of them had turned his body into a grayish brown poisonous mist. He did not think his poisonous mist could defeat the fox girl, and had only used it to protect himself.</p>

  <p>The other one curled up in a corner the size of a fist, which made him a much more difficult target to attack.</p>

  <p>Zheng finally got a chance to breathe after his speed increased.</p>

  <p>Before the Chaotic Source Spirits recovered, he hadn't wanted to take on the fox girl. He had just relied on his nimble body to dodge her. But he had begun to do his own analyses during this time.</p>

  <p>The fox girl's strength had increased almost every time she had attacked.</p>

  <p>And now, her strength was close to two hundred thousand divine megatons!</p>

  <p>This meant that she could withstand a power of two hundred thousand divine megatons with her physical body.</p>

  <p>The limit of the explosive strength from Zheng's physical body was only two hundred thousand divine megatons. He was afraid that he wouldn't be able to shatter the fox girl's glazed body.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Zheng's body floated, narrowly avoiding the fox girl's attacks. Her strength had now increased to two hundred and twenty thousand divine megatons.</p>

  <p>Perhaps it was because of her incomparably strong body that the fox girl's attacks became more and more formidable with every strike.</p>

  <p>"It's no use dodging this way." The fox girl sighed as she chased after him.</p>

  <p>"Even if I gave you the chance to fight back, what could you do? The limit of power that my physical body can bear is far beyond your imagination."</p>

  <p>She was of the opinion that even if she stood there and let Zheng attack her at his full power, Zheng probably wouldn't be able to injure her.</p>

  <p>After the Chaotic Source Spirits had recovered, Zheng had seized the opportunity and landed quite a few punches on the fox girl. His strength was controlled, at about ninety thousand divine megatons, and his attack could not cause any harm to her.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Zheng moved behind her and kicked her back again. The kick contained nearly one hundred thousand divine megatons of power but she blocked it quite easily.</p>

  <p>Egan and the others looked on in despair.</p>

  <p>If Zheng had displayed his full strength, they would be doomed this time.</p>

  <p>After all, Zheng could not hurt his opponent.</p>

  <p>And in this narrow room, Zheng would fail sooner or later, and one failure meant death.</p>

  <p>"You should be able to control more than one hundred thousand divine megatons of power. Why don't you use it?"</p>

  <p>The fox girl blocked Zheng's attack and smiled as she turned around to grab him. But Zheng had already floated away, avoiding the attack by inches.</p>

  <p>Zheng seemed abnormally calm in this battle.</p>

  <p>There was still a chance as he could use the Celestial Spear.</p>

  <p>When he had been in Stage Thirty-one of the Other Shore, Zheng had let Libby keep the Celestial Spear that he had obtained. Before entering the Eternal Scroll Painting, Zheng returned in the form of the Soul of Light and took it back from Libby.</p>

  <p>With the Three Purities Stone, he fused his soul with his body. He could thus also use the Sumeru Space owned by his Soul of Light.</p>

  <p>"Or do you think you have a trump card that will help you fight back and defeat me?"</p>

  <p>The fox girl was suddenly reluctant to kill Zheng.</p>

  <p>She had hunted many low-level creatures in the Eternal Scroll Painting that were weak and vulnerable in her eyes.</p>

  <p>But the human being before her was the only one who had fought her for so long.</p>

  <p>He had probably been able to hold on for so long because they were fighting in the room of hexagram array.</p>

  <p>But he was still outstanding for holding his own while fighting her.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>"If you have any powerful skills, use them quickly, or you won't stand a chance!"</p>

  <p>The fox girl jumped a hundred feet as she spoke, and then, with a sudden kick of her legs, swooped down on Zheng.</p>

  <p>She used her own body as a weapon.</p>

  <p>She had used this method a number of times before and every time, her attack had been formidable and threatening. Zheng had had no choice but to escape.</p>

  <p>But Zheng stayed put this time. He merely took a step back before an azure square appeared in his hand. He had barely pulled the Celestial Spear from the square when a hysterical voice rang out from his throat and echoed across the room. "I'll do what you want!"</p>
