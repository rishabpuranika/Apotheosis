<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>No one responded to Lachlan.</p>

  <p>Trish and her stepmother also looked around the courtyard with puzzled looks.</p>

  <p>"Who are you? How dare you cause me trouble in the Yan-Zhao City?"</p>

  <p>Lachlan continued, raising his voice. "You must have a death wish!"</p>

  <p>The whole Yan-Zhao City was under the rule of the Zhao Clan. Everyone, no matter how influential they were, had to show their respect to the Zhao Clan if they passed by the city. This would explain why Lachlan was so indignant.</p>

  <p>"Show your..." Before he could finish his words, Trish let out a panicked scream.</p>

  <p>Lachlan whipped his head around in time to see her rushing towards him at an inhuman speed. It was as though her entire body was enveloped in some invisible force. Before he had the time to react, Trish raised her hand and slapped him full in the face.</p>

  <p>"How dare you!"</p>

  <p>Slap!</p>

  <p>Slap!</p>

  <p>Slap!</p>

  <p>Trish couldn't stop her hands from slapping Lachlan's face.</p>

  <p>With a grunt, her final slap sent him flying, crashing into a small room in the courtyard.</p>

  <p>"Trish, are you crazy?!" her stepmother shouted hysterically.</p>

  <p>Trish turned to face her. She raised her hand, about to slap her stepmother.</p>

  <p>Her stepmother's eyes widened in fear and she immediately covered her face with her hands. She dared not say another word.</p>

  <p>At this moment, two figures emerged.</p>

  <p>Gingerly, they touched the enchanted barrier set up by the Zhao Clan.</p>

  <p>Immediately, a ray of blood light shot at them.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>With a flick of his hand, a light flashed from one of the figures, slicing through the blood light. In doing so, the barrier broke apart.</p>

  <p>"Who, who are you? How dare you break into our house without permission?" Trish's stepmother said in a shaky voice, unable to contain her horror.</p>

  <p>Lachlan climbed out of the ruins and his face changed when he saw the two people in the air.</p>

  <p>Trish's face was full of joy and surprise as she walked up and bowed to Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Luo, I'm so sorry. I failed to return to the Su Clan today, because..."</p>

  <p>"I know." Zheng gently raised his hand to stop Trish from speaking any further. Turning to face her stepmother, Zheng said coldly, "Trish is my maid, and I am taking her away today. Do you dare to defy this?"</p>

  <p>Trish's stepmother was aware that she served a disciple from the Flow Sword Sect. Back when the Yan Clan was still influential, the Flow Sword Sect was unpopular and known to be weak. However, now, she trembled slightly at Zheng's words.</p>

  <p>"I don't dare!" she replied hastily. "It wasn't my idea to keep Trish here. It was the Zhao Clan's idea!" The woman immediately pointed a finger at Lachlan.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't want to argue further with her, so he turned to look at Lachlan.</p>

  <p>Lachlan was a mess. His face was red and swollen from the slaps, his clothes covered in rubble and dust. Yet, there was still a fierce look in his eyes. "She's right. Trish is mine. What do you want?"</p>

  <p>Lachlan had also gone to the Ripple Pavilion with his clan members earlier that day, but he had no interest in the competition. Instead, as the giant drums gathered to form the battle ring, he decided to spend the afternoon with a whore. He hadn't heard about what happened till the competition came to an abrupt end.</p>

  <p>"What do I want?" Zheng blinked. "I want Trish. She's coming with me."</p>

  <p>"Do you really think you can leave this city?" Lachlan said unflinchingly.</p>

  <p>Then, he pulled out a jade pendant that hung from his waist. Without any hesitation, he crushed it in his hand.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>From the broken shards of the jade pendant, a green light flashed.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Trish's eyes widened in fear. "Mr. Luo, we'd better get going. If the people from Zhao Clan come over, I'm afraid you'll be in trouble."</p>

  <p>Trish knew that Zheng, an outstanding disciple of the Flow Sword Sect, might not be afraid of the Zhao Clan.</p>

  <p>But this wasn't the Oneness Sky Palace. There were some notably strong people in the Zhao Clan. If Zheng insisted on staying, she was afraid he'd get hurt, which was the last thing she wanted to see.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter," Zheng said indifferently.</p>

  <p>Lachlan sneered at Zheng's calm face.</p>

  <p>The Zhao Clan had been doing business by the Clear Lake for many years.</p>

  <p>Every year, they offered a lot of magic pills to the Oneness Sky Palace and had a very good relationship with the palace. Lachlan, in his haughtiness, thought he could punish any disciple of the palace without much consequence.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>In a matter of seconds, a dozen figures swept across the sky above the Yan Clan's house. In the blink of an eye, they landed in the small courtyard, each figure equally menacing.</p>

  <p>One of the figures stood out among the rest. It was the leader of the Zhao Clan.</p>

  <p>"Father!"</p>

  <p>Lachlan beamed at the sight of his father, and he confidently glared at Zheng.</p>

  <p>"This brat has made trouble here," he said arrogantly. "He doesn't take our clan seriously!"</p>

  <p>The master of the Zhao Clan strode forward, surveying the damage: the fallen servants and the destroyed walls. But when his eyes landed on Zheng, he gasped in shock.</p>

  <p>He immediately recognized that Zheng was the one who ruined the competition at the Ripple Pavilion.</p>

  <p>Moreover, this was the guy who had killed a direct descendant of the Vastness Mountain effortlessly.</p>

  <p>With a shake of his head, he wondered inwardly, 'What did Lachlan do to piss this man off?'</p>

  <p>"Father," Lachlan echoed. "What're you waiting for? Arrest this guy and punish him severely. Otherwise the other people may think we're weak and incompetent..."</p>

  <p>Slap!</p>

  <p>The master of the Zhao Clan slapped his son's face, much harder than Trish had.</p>

  <p>Lachlan rubbed his temples as his thoughts swirled dizzily. Once he came back to his senses, his mouth fell in shock. His father was bowing deeply to Zheng in respect!</p>

  <p>That was the highest honor.</p>

  <p>Only grandsons would bow to their grandfathers in this way.</p>

  <p>But this was Lachlan's father, the lord of the Yan-Zhao City and the master of the Zhao Clan!</p>

  <p>How could he do this to a mere disciple of the Oneness Sky Palace?</p>

  <p>Lachlan was totally confused.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry that I didn't teach my son well," the master said cautiously. "Mr.</p>

  <p>Luo, please forgive him."</p>

  <p>The master of the Zhao Clan was well aware that Zheng had just defeated notable warriors earlier that day; if he stirred conflict now, it might ruin the reputation of the Zhao Clan.</p>

  <p>Moreover, he also knew his third son well. He knew that Lachlan was in the wrong without having to ask what happened.</p>

  <p>Zheng cast a cold glance at the master of the Zhao Clan. "I don't want to get involved in the affairs between the Yan Clan and the Zhao Clan. This is your son's fault; he should never have offended Trish."</p>

  <p>"Lachlan!" the master cried angrily. "Come here! Kneel down!"</p>

  <p>Lachlan turned livid with rage. His father had never been so strict with him.</p>

  <p>He walked over reluctantly, but refused to kneel. Mumbling, he said, "She's just a maid! A maid..."</p>

  <p>"I said kneel down!" The master of the Zhao Clan raised his voice.</p>

  <p>Lachlan finally flopped down on his knees in front of Zheng. The master of the Zhao Clan said, "Mr. Luo, my good-for-nothing son is at your disposal!"</p>

  <p>Zheng waved his hand indifferently. "Break his legs and arms. Don't treat him in a year."</p>

  <p>Without any hesitation, the master of the Zhao Clan flicked his wrist violently. Instantly, invisible forces rushed at Lachlan.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>With a terrible shriek, Lachlan collapsed to the floor, his arms and legs horribly disfigured.</p>

  <p>"Let's go," Zheng said expressionlessly. Before he turned to leave with Trish and Gant, he suddenly said, "Trish is my maid." Narrowing his eyes, he continued ominously, "I don't want her family to decline."</p>

  <p>The master of the Zhao Clan broke out in a cold sweat, a chill running down his spine.</p>
