  <p>
</p>

  <p>This was really lively!</p>

  <p>Shaking his head, Luo Luo Zheng pulled out the Lucky Light from his token and slowly began to refine it.</p>

  <p>Boris and Cheryl were the strongest among the level ten war generals. Both of them hadn't lost any of their previous battles, so there was an awful lot of Lucky Light stored in their tokens.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng drew out the Lucky Light, the blazing white light was unimaginably thick.</p>

  <p>'With so much Lucky Light, I should be able to make a breakthrough!'</p>

  <p>When he thought of this, the life vitality within his body suddenly revolved and traces of life vitality continuously refined the Lucky Light, pouring it into his body.</p>

  <p>Three days later, Luo Luo Zheng left the training chamber. Cheryl, who was standing in front of the training chamber, gave him a broad smile.</p>

  <p>The Demon Night members were waiting for Luo Luo Zheng to come out.</p>

  <p>Of course, what they wanted to see wasn't Luo Luo Zheng himself but the sword spirit in his body, which was also their queen Xun.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded and said to Cheryl, "We can set off now."</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng was short on time, he had to take Xun to the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place since he had already agreed to it.</p>

  <p>Moreover, there was still quite a bit of time before the Dark Nether Cave would open. Even if Luo Luo Zheng wanted to return to the Central Region, he would have to wait until he entered the Dark Nether Cave and obtained the inheritance inside it. So, he still had plenty of time.</p>

  <p>Under Cheryl's lead, Luo Luo Zheng returned to the first floor of the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>After waiting at the entrance for a while, Esther, the strongest of the seat owners, brought two top-level war lords over.</p>

  <p>They all left the Tower of Sin together and headed south of the Cursed Land.</p>

  <p>Flying was forbidden within the Cursed Land. Whoever tried to fly would be pressed down to the ground by a horrible force. Luo Luo Zheng had experienced this before when he first entered the Cursed Land. So, everyone could only travel on foot.</p>

  <p>Still, with their speed, they covered quite a distance within just a few hours.</p>

  <p>Soon, a large transmission array appeared in front of them.</p>

  <p>Cheryl rushed forward first and took out several life vitality crystals from her pocket. Then, she placed them on the transmission array. Once the life vitality crystals were placed, the entire transmission array erupted with light.</p>

  <p>"Go in." Esther nodded at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng immediately stepped into the transmission array, knowing that it would lead to the Demon Night's Heavenly Feather Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>Soon after, a blue light enveloped them and they all traveled through the transmission channel. After about five minutes, the transmission channel came to an end. When the light dissipated, Luo Luo Zheng could smell the faint fragrance of flowers.</p>

  <p>This was very different from the scenery of the Cursed Land.</p>

  <p>Apart from the various races in the Cursed Land, there was no sign of life there. But here, there was an emerald green jungle. There were all sorts of lush vegetation and colorful flowers bloomed all around. It was like a paradise on earth.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng raised his head, he saw that there was an incomparably large tree in the distance.</p>

  <p>"That big tree is...?" Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"It is the holy tree of our sacred place. Every sacred place of the Demon Night has a holy tree," Cheryl explained with a smile.</p>

  <p>The Demon Night's method of reproduction was completely different from what Luo Luo Zheng had imagined. When a baby was born, the baby would be kept within the holy tree where it would absorb the natural energy. Because of this, the physical quality of the members of the Demon Night was much better than the physical quality of the other races. In addition, from the moment they were born, there would be no impurities within their bodies.</p>

  <p>They were born nature creatures.</p>

  <p>This was the reason why the members of the Demon Night were so much more powerful than the other races.</p>

  <p>However, the world was fair. The Demon Night was strong but their ability to reproduce was very weak. Even though the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place was known as a seventh-grade sacred place, the entire sacred place only had around a million members.</p>

  <p>As for the humans' Purple Heart Sacred Place, its population was a hundred times larger than the Demon Night's even though it was only a mere sixth-grade sacred place.</p>

  <p>At this time, the red light around Luo Luo Zheng flashed, and little rays of light slowly condensed and formed into a figure? Xun.</p>

  <p>Cheryl, Esther, and the others reflexively knelt toward Xun as soon as she appeared.</p>

  <p>Seeing this scene, Luo Luo Zheng was speechless. It turned out that the members of the Demon Night respected their queen very much.</p>

  <p>Xun didn't look at them at all. Instead, she looked at the holy tree in the distance and said, "Stand up." Then, she turned to Luo Luo Zheng. "We're going there."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng leaped into the air and sped away with Xun.</p>

  <p>Esther, Cheryl, and the rest followed behind him.</p>

  <p>During the flight, Luo Luo Zheng moved close to Xun. "You... Why do you know Yolande?"</p>

  <p>"Because I know her," Xun replied nonchalantly.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng rolled his eyes. "I've met a Yolande in the Eastern Region who looks exactly the same as her. What's going on? Are they the same person?"</p>

  <p>"Yes." Xun nodded. "They are one person."</p>

  <p>"But..." Luo Luo Zheng was about to say something, but Xun interrupted him.</p>

  <p>"The Upper World has many cultivation methods. Some cultivation methods may seem unfathomable to you. The fact is, there's more than one Yolande. If you search carefully in the Lower World, you might be able to find one million Yolandes."</p>

  <p>"One million Yolandes?" Luo Zheng's jaw dropped.</p>

  <p>Xun nodded. "Perhaps even more, and they're all indeed the same person."</p>

  <p>"How can that be?" Luo Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"It's very simple. Yolande used a special method to split her soul into a million pieces. Then, she sent the pieces to many different worlds to cultivate and gain combat experience. At some point, she will recollect all the pieces of her soul and merge them into one. At that time, her cultivation will grow to a terrifying level!"</p>

  <p>These words once again silenced Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He understood now.</p>

  <p>Back when he had met Yolande in White Emperor City of the Eastern Region, she had been training and killing demons nonstop to gain experience.</p>

  <p>And within the Tower of Sin, Yolande had been constantly fighting in the arena. Even though she'd had a lot of Lucky Light, she'd never attempted to refine it and always remained a war general. It had been as if she would never improve herself.</p>

  <p>He hadn't expected the Yolandes he had seen to be just clones.</p>

  <p>With so many clones cultivating separately and then being recollected together, how terrifying would Yolande become?</p>

  <p>It was hard for Luo Luo Zheng to imagine. He could only marvel at the wonders of the world. There were simply too many talents in the Upper World to think of such an incredible method of cultivation.</p>

  <p>The speed of their travel was naturally many times higher now that they were flying rather than walking. Although the holy tree looked very far, everyone was able to reach it within five minutes.</p>

  <p>The members of the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place had received news of their queen's arrival in advance. Many of them were waiting on top of the huge holy tree.</p>

  <p>A crimson carpet was laid out along the thick trunk of the tree. At the end of the carpet stood a woman dressed in purple.</p>

  <p>Even though Luo Luo Zheng and the woman were tens of thousands of feet apart, Luo Luo Zheng could still feel the Mu Ning that she was emitting.</p>

  <p>The Mu Ning wasn't overbearing but it gave off an incomparably heavy feeling, even much stronger than those of the ogre war sages and Eddie, who was at the Life and Death Realm.</p>

  <p>Staring at the woman's figure, Luo Luo Zheng had already guessed her identity. This woman was the leader of the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place. She was also one of the powerful warriors at the Soul Sea Realm. She was none other than Amber. Luo Luo Zheng had seen her name on the Talent Tablet.</p>
