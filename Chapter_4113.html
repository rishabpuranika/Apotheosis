<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord acquired all the necessary information about the Four Spirits Sect and the main world from the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>But regarding what he said about the Snake Spirit King's strength, it was merely a rough estimate. The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord was not thoroughly certain about it.</p>

  <p>Moreover, he was not entirely sure if the Snake Spirit King still had all those ten Other Shore Tokens in his possession.</p>

  <p>If the Snake Spirit King was still able to use his full strength until now, he would have already managed to defeat the Bird Spirit King long ago.</p>

  <p>These two races had been warring with each other for over hundreds of chaotic eras. One could say that they were mortal enemies.</p>

  <p>"If that's the case, then I will destroy all of his Other Shore Tokens..."</p>

  <p>Geoffrey had already acknowledged the Snake Spirit King as his father's greatest enemy after the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord explained everything.</p>

  <p>He knew that these Other Shore Tokens could be destroyed. All he needed to do was to pull them out.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey had succeeded to do that lots of times before. He accomplished this while he was climbing the pillar.</p>

  <p>If the person who owned the Other Shore Token seemed wicked, he would immediately pull out the black stone and throw it away.</p>

  <p>He was also the one who threw away the black stones of those Other Shore Tokens belonging to the Element Spirit Civilization.</p>

  <p>However, he was eager to reach the top as soon as possible. He realized that there were too many black stones on the pillar. It would take him a couple of years to pull them all out. Therefore, he left it entirely up to his mood whether or not he would pull out certain stones.</p>

  <p>It meant that during this period of time, all sorts of strange things had been happening on the Other Shore. Every now and then, some people found that their Other Shore Tokens had suddenly stopped working.</p>

  <p>Even though Geoffrey's proposal to pull out the Snake Spirit King's Other Shore Tokens sounded a little childish, it was actually very straightforward and effective.</p>

  <p>It would be best if he succeeded in pulling them out and was able to destroy the ten Other Shore Tokens as well.</p>

  <p>"You are welcome to try but you have to be extremely careful," replied the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord. He was obviously concerned about Geoffrey's safety.</p>

  <p>At this moment, he felt full of regret.</p>

  <p>He should have learned more about the Four Spirits Sect in the past. That way, he could have been of greater help to Geoffrey. Alas! He had already missed his chance.</p>

  <p>"Okay! Here I go!"</p>

  <p>Geoffrey said as soon as the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord expressed his agreement. Very carefully, he climbed onto the tenth step.</p>

  <p>Based on his previous experience, he pointed at the black light in the middle of the step.</p>

  <p>It was actually a risky move but he had no other choice now. Entering the Abstruse Energy World was a kind of adventure in its own way.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>As soon as Geoffrey's fingertip came into contact with the black light, the scene he saw through it exploded and expanded around him.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, he noticed a brown cloud floating slowly and steadily in the distance.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, it had entered his field of vision. Up close, Geoffrey observed that the brown cloud was spiral shaped.</p>

  <p>"Huh? A chaos cloud?"</p>

  <p>Geoffrey scratched his head as he had no idea what just happened.</p>

  <p>He originally thought that all the Other Shore Tokens should have been on the Other Shore. He didn't expect that the Snake Spirit King's tenth Other Shore Token would be in the chaos.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey adjusted his visual range and saw a black bead. Much to his surprise, he found that the bead was embedded into a wall.</p>

  <p>The chaos was supposed to be empty. How could there be a wall here?</p>

  <p>Thoroughly confused, Geoffrey adjusted his line of vision once more. He tried to figure out where the wall ended.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the surroundings were filled with chaotic energy. All he could see was a small portion of the wall.</p>

  <p>Just as Geoffrey was adjusting his line of sight, he suddenly discovered some bulges protruding below the bead. He focused his vision closely and carefully looked at it. He was utterly shocked after he figured out what it was!</p>

  <p>It was a woman that had been embedded into the wall! The bumps were actually some parts of her body sticking out of the wall.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey pondered about how long the woman had been in there. Her face, chest, legs, and stretched arms were the only parts floating serenely outside the wall.</p>

  <p>Astonishingly, Geoffrey realized that this woman was still alive despite of her current condition.</p>

  <p>Her skin remained snow-white and full of vitality even if it had already been exposed for an indefinite amount of time. It was as though there was an abundant life force emanating from her body.</p>

  <p>Upon closer inspection, he saw that the woman's eyes were different. Her pupils were slits instead of the normal round ones. They were almost like thin crescent moons. They were not human eyes but a pair of snake eyes!</p>

  <p>This woman had remained in this restrained position for countless years.</p>

  <p>All this time, all she could do was gaze into the distance.</p>

  <p>Her state of mind had remained the same for over a thousand chaotic eras.</p>

  <p>If she could struggle against her bonds, she would definitely break free of them. Then, she would be able to end her life as quickly as possible.</p>

  <p>Sadly, she couldn't...</p>

  <p>Aside from that, she had to stay embedded in the wall and continuously sacrifice herself for the snake.</p>

  <p>And because everything was already settled a long time ago, her struggle would be futile.</p>

  <p>Her heart had already become numb. She couldn't feel anything else in this silent void.</p>

  <p>However, she immediately felt it when Geoffrey looked at her. How could she not? She hadn't felt any other presence for such a long time. Naturally, she would notice if something changed.</p>

  <p>There was a sparkle of light in her somber gray eyes. Her crescent-shaped pupils flickered with a faint golden glow.</p>

  <p>'Is there someone out there? Someone is spying on me...</p>

  <p>...in order to humiliate me?</p>

  <p>Oh no! I can feel its presence!</p>

  <p>Someone is undoubtedly spying on me through the Evil Bead!</p>

  <p>Someone managed to climb up the pillar!'</p>

  <p>There was a sudden change in the features of her beautiful face. The face that was once immutable for billions of billions of years looked different.</p>

  <p>There was something unusual about her facial expression.</p>

  <p>Clearly, the muscles on her face hadn't moved for a very long time, so it became almost harder than steel. Therefore, cracking sounds could be heard when she tried to put on a stunned expression.</p>

  <p>She started coughing as she struggled to speak out.</p>

  <p>It sounded like her throat was full of sand.</p>

  <p>It took her some time before she finally spoke through gritted teeth, "Who is it? Who is spying on me?"</p>

  <p>Her voice did not seem like it came from a woman. At the very least, it did not match her beautiful face. It sounded hoarse and husky.</p>

  <p>When Geoffrey heard her talk, he became extremely curious.</p>

  <p>Where was this woman located in the vast chaos?</p>

  <p>Why had she been embedded in that wall?</p>

  <p>Most importantly, who was she?</p>

  <p>However, he could only ask these questions in his mind.</p>

  <p>By using special means, Geoffrey had been able to communicate with the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord earlier. He tried using the same method to reach out to the woman. He began to pluck the black light.</p>

  <p>Every time he would pluck the black light, his head felt as if it would explode like a firecracker.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, he gritted his teeth and held on.</p>

  <p>'This woman must have an extraordinary origin, ' he thought. This would be the only opportunity he had to find out who that woman was.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the woman merely stared obliviously at the Evil Bead above. She was utterly confused.</p>

  <p>She couldn't understand the way he communicated. Instead, she just said,</p>

  <p>"The holy pillars... Have they become so unstable? It seems that they would collapse at any moment."</p>

  <p>"Then it's fine. If the holy pillars collapse, then these grudges among the four sects would easily be solved..."</p>

  <p>Actually, Geoffrey's flickering gaze had misled the woman. She thought there wasn't someone observing her, but there was something wrong with the holy pillars.</p>

  <p>When Geoffrey realized the woman didn't get it, he became a little anxious and plucked the black light faster.</p>

  <p>However, the woman still couldn't understand what he wanted to say.</p>

  <p>Communicating with her this way proved to be rather pointless.</p>

  <p>After trying for a while, Geoffrey felt a sharp pain in his head. It was as though it had been split open. Finally, he gave up.</p>

  <p>The woman discovered that the gaze on the Evil Bead had disappeared.</p>

  <p>Once again, her expression became stiff and impassive. She remained motionless and assumed her previous state of being.</p>

  <p>The chaos cloud that enveloped her became a little thinner. Gradually, more parts of the wall that bound her were revealed. It appears that the wall extended out of the chaos cloud and stretched endlessly towards the far distance.</p>

  <p>After leaving the black light, Geoffrey headed back and returned to the eleventh step. He immediately told the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord what he had seen.</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord frowned when he heard what he just said.</p>

  <p>He didn't expect that there was a wall in the chaos. Moreover, there was a beautiful woman with snake eyes embedded in it.</p>

  <p>He couldn't quite understand why such a bizarre thing existed in the chaos.</p>

  <p>Needless to say, Geoffrey didn't get an answer from the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord. Then without saying anything, he stood on the ninth step and touched the black light.</p>

  <p>This time, Geoffrey's gaze landed directly on the Heavenly Square City.</p>

  <p>There was an irregularly-shaped piece of metal floating in the middle of a small room.</p>

  <p>The moment Geoffrey laid his eyes on the metal piece, the whole Heavenly Square City trembled violently.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King suddenly opened his eyes and growled, "My Holy Item! Who dares spy on my Holy Item?"</p>
