<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Has anything happened on the Floating Islands after their rankings were determined?"</p>

  <p>Lange echoed the girl's question as he was stunned after hearing it.</p>

  <p>Almost everyone who was able to enter the Everest Spirit Mountain was a True God from one of the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>However, it seemed that this girl didn't know much about the Floating Islands, which meant that she must have been staying in the Everest Spirit Mountain for a long time.</p>

  <p>And those who had been staying in the Everest Spirit Mountain for a long time could only be... The answer was clear in Lange's mind.</p>

  <p>Right now, the Everest Spirit Mountain was under Harold's control. In other words, this girl was on Harold's side.</p>

  <p>The girl noticed the change in Lange's expression and immediately knew what was on his mind.</p>

  <p>Standing on the back of the Brutal Bull, she said in a cold voice, "Don't try to guess my identity. Just answer me!"</p>

  <p>"Something big did happen not long ago!" Lange answered immediately as he couldn't afford to offend her. "It's related to the Luo Clan!"</p>

  <p>Lange knew that this girl was a member of the Luo Clan, so he understood what she was asking. Besides, there was only one big thing that had happened on the Floating Islands recently. In fact, he felt a bit relieved because it was not hard to guess what the girl wanted to know.</p>

  <p>There was no enmity between the Bai Clan and the Luo Clan. As long as they honestly answered the girl's questions, their lives would likely be spared.</p>

  <p>"The Luo Clan?"</p>

  <p>Just as he had expected, a tinge of anxiety appeared in the girl's eyes. It seemed that she really cared about the Luo Clan.</p>

  <p>"People say that a son of Mike was smuggled into the divine land from the universe and that he infiltrated the Han Clan's Floating Island. Then, he turned into an anonymous man and set terrifying records in the Arena of Legends," Lange explained.</p>

  <p>After the Astronomical Transit Day celebration, the True Gods had spread this news to the public, so it was not a secret anymore.</p>

  <p>At this, the girl's face was full of undisguised concern.</p>

  <p>She had been waiting for her brother all this time.</p>

  <p>She had even asked Harold to pass on a message to Zheng, hoping that he could come to the Everest Spirit Mountain.</p>

  <p>According to the rules, Zheng should have been able to enter the Cloud Dragon Ravine after the rankings of the Floating Islands were determined. However, nearly a month had passed after the rankings were determined, and yet he still hadn't arrived!</p>

  <p>She had the feeling that something must have gone wrong.</p>

  <p>But as she had been staying away from the Floating Islands, she had had no way of knowing what was happening there.</p>

  <p>She had only been able to speculate the possible outcomes on her own.</p>

  <p>For example, if Zheng's identity had been exposed to the public, he might have been secretly killed by a big clan like the Mu Clan or the Dongfang Clan. Ordinary True Gods wouldn't even know about such a matter if it happened.</p>

  <p>After days of constantly worrying about her brother, she had finally decided to trap a few True Gods of the Bai Clan here.</p>

  <p>However, she had never expected that a True God of the Bai Clan would willingly spit out everything she wanted to know.</p>

  <p>"What happened then?" she asked cautiously.</p>

  <p>"After that, he was invited to attend the Astronomical Transit Day celebration, where he was almost killed by Rachelle Mu," said Lange.</p>

  <p>The girl's heart skipped a beat at his words.</p>

  <p>"It's said that the consummate True God of the Dongfang Clan stopped Rachelle from killing him. Then, he managed to snatch a precious treasure from a group of consummate True Gods before leaving the Time Sea Forbidden Land," Lange continued with a puzzled look on his face.</p>

  <p>The truth was, many True Gods from the Floating Islands had found this rumor downright ridiculous.</p>

  <p>It was simply unbelievable for a low-rank True God to have snatched a treasure from a group of consummate True Gods. As for what had happened in the jade seal, only the consummate True Gods knew the truth, but they could never spread that information. As a result, the ordinary True Gods didn't know anything about it.</p>

  <p>"And then?" the girl asked again.</p>

  <p>She had always known what would happen to her brother if his true identity had been exposed.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings of the powerful clans on the Floating Islands would never let go of him.</p>

  <p>"Then, Estelle Shi, the controller of the Soul Wilderness, exerted her great skill to help him. The Demi-holy Being from the Han Clan helped him escape the hands of the Holy Emperor of the Dongfang Clan by taking him through space," said Lange with a shrug.</p>

  <p>Many people had seen this particular scene, so that was one thing they had no doubt about.</p>

  <p>"So he has escaped."</p>

  <p>Hearing the news, the girl finally calmed down. She took a deep breath, and a peaceful smile appeared on her face.</p>

  <p>"Can you let us go now?" asked Lange.</p>

  <p>The girl nodded. Then, three Brutal Bulls slowly walked toward the three True Gods.</p>

  <p>The mid-rank True Gods of the Bai Clan became nervous when they saw the three Brutal Bulls. They were afraid that the girl wanted to kill them to prevent them from divulging her identity.</p>

  <p>However, the girl said in a soft voice, "These Brutal Bulls will take you to the entrance."</p>

  <p>As soon as she finished speaking, she jumped in the air like a fairy and danced in a circle before falling into the canyon behind the three True Gods. Her clothes fluttered around her as she fell.</p>

  <p>When she was just a hundred feet away from the surface of the water at the bottom of the canyon, she suddenly stopped falling.</p>

  <p>Then, she flew in the direction of the Everest Spirit Mountain like a nightingale.</p>

  <p>In the south of the Everest Spirit Mountain were many wide stone houses.</p>

  <p>The number of these stone houses had gradually increased until they had formed a small village in the forbidden land.</p>

  <p>When the girl reached the village, she gently set her feet down onto the ground.</p>

  <p>"Yan! You're back!" shouted a three-year-old boy from the village.</p>

  <p>The other kids all became excited too. "Yan is back!"</p>

  <p>Yan smiled and greeted them before hurrying to the largest stone house.</p>

  <p>"Harold!"</p>

  <p>When she opened the door, she realized that there were other people in the stone house. After a split-second of hesitation, she stood straight with her hands clasped behind her back and greeted respectfully, "Uncle Bryson, Uncle Ken."</p>

  <p>"Yan, you are back!"</p>

  <p>"How dare Harold send you to inquire about the news alone! I was going to look for you!"</p>

  <p>Yan's uncles said, looking flustered.</p>

  <p>Their appearances were exactly the same as those of her uncles back in C County of the Eastern Region of the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>So naturally, when Harold had brought Yan to the Everest Spirit Mountain for the first time, she had been frightened upon seeing her two uncles. She had been cold toward them for a long time because they had been bad to her and Zheng in the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>However, she had later gotten to know that her father had just created clones of her two uncles when he had set up the Eastern Region and even given them the same names.</p>

  <p>Of course, her two uncles in the Everest Spirit Mountain had no idea what had happened in the Luo Clan of the Eastern Region.</p>

  <p>It could be said that the two of them had been made to be bad guys by their elder brother Mike. When they had first met their young niece, they had been puzzled about her looming hostility toward them. After Yan had explained the situation, they couldn't help but laugh. After all, it was typical of Mike to be so unkind.</p>

  <p>"Yan is as talented and capable as Zheng. The only thing she lacks is experience," said Harold in an indifferent tone. "It's better for her to do something by herself."</p>

  <p>"Yes!" Yan said unhappily to her two uncles. "You can't worry too much about me. Otherwise, I will never grow up!"</p>

  <p>Bryson and Ken could do nothing but shake their heads with a smile.</p>

  <p>Then Bryson asked, "What about the information you went to inquire?"</p>

  <p>"Something happened to my brother," Yan said calmly. "Rachelle Mu figured out his identity."</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"How is he now?"</p>

  <p>The facial expressions of Bryson and Ken changed.</p>

  <p>At the same time, a trace of concern also appeared on Harold's face.</p>

  <p>However, Yan didn't look upset, so he knew that Zheng's condition couldn't be too bad.</p>

  <p>"He was rescued by Joy Han," Yan replied.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, they were all relieved.</p>

  <p>Then, Yan told them about everything she had heard.</p>

  <p>With a worried expression, she added, "I wonder where my brother is now."</p>

  <p>Her wish to be reunited with her brother had been so close to coming true. She had never expected that things would go wrong, so she naturally felt rather disappointed now.</p>
