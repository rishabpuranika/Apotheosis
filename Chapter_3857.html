<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3857 Combat Dragon Absorb </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>After Divine Farmer had destroyed the Combat Dragon Pillar with the ruler, he slashed at the brass man once more.</p>

  <p>Just as his second strike was about to land on the brass man, a bandage suddenly wrapped around his arm.</p>

  <p>At the other end of the bandage was the "bamboo pole".</p>

  <p>The "bamboo pole" glowed with colorful light after the bandage unwrapped. In the Black Ship, the "bamboo pole" was the most proficient in using poison. Back then, when the first Usman appeared, he also relied on his fast-spreading "Flash Insect Poison" to make thousands of the provinces in the Source World turn red.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The "bamboo pole" then pulled the bandage and passed by the brass man and rushed towards Divine Farmer.</p>

  <p>His whole body shone brightly and had turned into a semi-liquid state.</p>

  <p>Under his skin was not flesh, but water.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the ruler slashed down and sank into the body of the "bamboo pole." In turn, the "bamboo pole" immediately softened and turned into a mass of sticky venom that spread out on Divine Farmer's arms!</p>

  <p>"Sizzle..."</p>

  <p>As soon as the venom came into contact with Divine Farmer, his arms became pitch black. The black spread at an alarming speed, and in no time, it reached his forearms.</p>

  <p>"You used poison on me? How naive of you!"</p>

  <p>The Divine Farmer Ruler he held emitted a green light that rolled towards him. The light mildly surrounded his arms and turned them back to normal.</p>

  <p>Then, the remaining green light followed the spreading venom.</p>

  <p>In reality, the venom was the real body of the "bamboo pole". It was his trump card. It liquefied his form and turned it into a toxic liquid that he used to attack.</p>

  <p>Although the "bamboo pole" hadn't reached the Eternal Realm, he was a much-experienced warrior in the Black Ship. He was ranked third on the Black Ship in terms of age.</p>

  <p>He had liquefied himself into poison three times in the past. It took him a long time to recover every time he was liquefied, and the recovery process was painful. However, he was always successful in killing opponents who were very difficult to deal with, including a warrior at the Eternal Realm.</p>

  <p>This time, however, his opponent was Divine Farmer!</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the ball of green light Divine Farmer used was fatal to him.</p>

  <p>He immediately felt chills when he saw the green light. He wanted to escape, but it was too late. The green light had already entangled with the venom, then the venom neutralized and disappeared.</p>

  <p>"Bane!"</p>

  <p>"Damn it!"</p>

  <p>When the real body of the "bamboo pole" got destroyed, two more warriors charged towards Divine Farmer from both sides.</p>

  <p>The person on the left carried a huge saber, and his name was Alonzo, and the person on the right was Shera.</p>

  <p>The two of them had a good relationship with the "bamboo pole", whose name was Bane. There was no way they weren't going to do anything when the green light from the Divine Farmer Ruler melted him!</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>At that moment, a strange dark mark appeared on the surface of the great saber on Alonzo's back. Then, he lifted the saber and swung it at Divine Farmer's head.</p>

  <p>The black saber radiance cut towards Divine Farmer with an irresistible and overpowering force.</p>

  <p>Aside from the captain, the strongest one among the thirteen members of the Black Ship was probably Alonzo.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the Eternal Realm was far too stronger than the Holy Soul Realm, especially when the warrior of the Eternal Realm was Divine Farmer, who had a powerful lifeblood weapon.</p>

  <p>Alonzo's strike, which seemed to be able to chop the heaven and earth, only made a muffled sound when it touched the Divine Farmer Ruler. The black saber radiance disappeared. The strange mark on the great saber disintegrated, and so did the whole saber itself.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>After Divine Farmer blocked the attack, he slapped Alonzo with his ruler.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The strike landed squarely on Alonzo's head. Although he had Chaotic Source Spirits to protect him, even a single strike from a warrior like Divine Farmer contained over one hundred thousand Jun of force.</p>

  <p>Thus, Alonzo's Chaotic Source Spirits quickly became exhausted, and at the same time, his head turned into a mass of blood.</p>

  <p>Then, he turned into a headless corpse and fell.</p>

  <p>"Alonzo!"</p>

  <p>Shera's eyes turned dark red as she stretched out her hand and tried to grab Divine Farmer's head.</p>

  <p>On the other and, Divine Farmer didn't even look at her. Instead, he raised his ruler.</p>

  <p>"Da!"</p>

  <p>However, Shera had grabbed the Divine Farmer Ruler!</p>

  <p>Divine Farmer didn't expect that the woman who reeked of corpses could resist his strike. In turn, he immediately tried to pull the ruler out of her hand.</p>

  <p>Even then, Shera's white jade-like hand still tightly held on to the ruler like a pincer.</p>

  <p>Divine Farmer was utterly shocked. "How could your hand have such power?" he asked in disbelief.</p>

  <p>Ordinary people didn't smell Shera's stench. Or, maybe she didn't stink like that at first, but because she was always around the dead, she eventually smelled like them.</p>

  <p>She was a mere cultivator at the Holy Soul Realm who strengthened her body to the point that she could fight a warrior in the Eternal Realm. It was indeed something that surprised Divine Farmer.</p>

  <p>Just as Shera had bought more time, three more members of the Black Ship came over.</p>

  <p>Of course, they wouldn't let such a fleeting opportunity pass by.</p>

  <p>Then again, they were far too different when it came to strength. Moreover, the remaining members became chaotic and couldn't cooperate well anymore due to the deaths of Bane and Alonzo.</p>

  <p>While that happened, Divine Farmer tapped Shera's head with his other hand to force her to retreat.</p>

  <p>As Shera retreated, Divine Farmer had already pulled out the ruler, and the ruler whirled around his back.</p>

  <p>Puff! Puff! Puff!</p>

  <p>One of the three members of the Black Ship was cut into two at the waist, and the other two lost their arms.</p>

  <p>Although they wouldn't die, they couldn't fight in a short time.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>When Divine Farmer had taken down several members of the Black Ship in a row, he flew towards the Invisible Ship.</p>

  <p>Inside the Invisible Ship was Edith, who was visibly anxious. No matter where she went, the Divine Farmer followed closely behind. What made it worse was that the other members of the Black Ship couldn't defeat him.</p>

  <p>When panic was about to overtake her, the brass man appeared in the Invisible Ship again.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing?" she asked. She didn't know why the brass man returned.</p>

  <p>The brass man did not answer and only stared fiercely at Luo Zheng's red crystal.</p>

  <p>Then, he stretched both of his hands and put it on his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Combat Dragon Absorb!"</p>

  <p>He roared, then his hands released a faint mist and fused him with the red crystal.</p>

  <p>It turned out that the Combat Dragon Pillar that Divine Farmer had just broken was not an Other Shore Token, but a weapon that the captain of the Black Ship had made for him.</p>

  <p>The brass man's Other Shore Token could combine his weapon and his body into one. He had always used the Combat Dragon Pillar to fight, and now Divine Farmer had destroyed it. Of course, it was hard to find a suitable weapon in a short time. Suddenly, he thought of the red crystal. So he placed it on his shoulder and merged it with his body.</p>

  <p>Right after that, he left the Invisible Ship and rushed towards Divine Farmer!</p>

  <p>Now, the reason Divine Farmer had chased the Invisible Ship for so long was because of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The second he saw the brass man rush towards him, his face became unreadable.</p>

  <p>The red crystal was undoubtedly a good material to use, but wouldn't that be giving him what he wanted by using Luo Zheng as a weapon and coming to him?</p>

  <p>Therefore, he didn't dodge and instead charged forward as well.</p>

  <p>Once again, he used the Divine Farmer Ruler to slash through the air and swung it at the red crystal!</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>The first strike failed to shatter the red crystal, but the second strike finally broke it.</p>

  <p>"Combat Dragon Absorb!"</p>

  <p>White mist burst out from the brass man's hands.</p>

  <p>Since the red crystal was damaged, he could no longer use it as a weapon.</p>

  <p>Thus, he made up his mind. He took Luo Zheng's body inside the red crystal and merged with it.</p>
