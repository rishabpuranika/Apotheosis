<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Shatter!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't care how thick the black crystal shields were. He was only aware that time was running tight.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>After several punches, the black crystal shields and the white spot below shattered into pieces.</p>

  <p>"The last one!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng gritted his teeth. Looking down, he saw that the countless four-legged black snakes had coiled around one another to form an incredibly massive black crystal shield. The interior of this translucent crystal shield presented a complex pattern.</p>

  <p>Narrowing his eyes, he willed the wings on his back to launch himself towards the black crystal shield, arcing gracefully in the air.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>With a violent collision, cracks appeared on the Green Jade Crystals on the surface of Luo Zheng's body. However, the black crystal shield remained unscathed.</p>

  <p>"Again!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng jumped high and dashed down toward the black crystal shield once more.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>An ear-piercing crash sounded, but to Luo Zheng's frustration, the black crystal shield still stood firm.</p>

  <p>By burning the world, the Evil God had gathered more energy than Luo Zheng did.</p>

  <p>The black crystal shield he had conjured was made from an unimaginable amount of energy, rendering it practically unbreakable.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng took a deep breath. He knew that if he wanted to destroy this shield, he'd have to burn the Green Jade World.</p>

  <p>But there was no way the Green Jade Spirit would allow it, and even Luo Zheng wasn't willing to do it. He was nowhere near as crazy as the Evil God, who burned an entire civilization that had supported him.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng jumped high again and kept striking the black crystal shield, over and over again.</p>

  <p>As he crashed into the shield, huge black meteorites fell down, one after another.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, these black meteorites fell relatively slowly-- which gave enough time for those below to dodge. However, upon impact with the ground, they'd release a tidal wave of energy.</p>

  <p>If anyone was hit by the wave of energy, they would definitely be smashed into pieces.</p>

  <p>Screams pierced the air as unfortunate creatures were unable to avoid the waves of energy.</p>

  <p>As another meteorite crash landed, several members from the Separate Abyss race were caught in the wave of energy. Among them was Hamzah, a core member of the Separate Abyss race.</p>

  <p>Even though Hamzah had activated the Mighty Golden Body, he still didn't stand a chance against the black energy. Instantly, he was ripped to shreds; there was nothing left of him after being sucked into the black energy.</p>

  <p>"This way!"</p>

  <p>Yan led the disciples from the Li Shan mountain and the Taiyi Heaven Palace as they tried to evade the falling black meteorites.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>Just then, three massive meteorites crashed in front of them, effectively blocking their way. Everyone felt hopeless.</p>

  <p>"We're trapped!" Chaim frowned.</p>

  <p>"Left!"</p>

  <p>"We can't get out!"</p>

  <p>Panic welled within them. This was a matter of life and death, and there was no time to stop and think!</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Yan's eyes flashed with determination. Raising her hands towards the sky, she spat out one word, "Slow!"</p>

  <p>She had tried to employ the Truth of Holy Words. However, in this situation, it was like a mantis trying to stop a chariot.</p>

  <p>The massive black meteorites continued to fall from the sky, unbothered by Yan's feeble attempt to slow them down. Meanwhile, the tides of energy from behind the group were like black, ominous waves. With each second that passed, the black energy was growing stronger and stronger, overwhelming the crowd in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>Yan's lips bled from her biting them, and her eyes shed bloody tears. Cyan scales appeared on her raised arms.</p>

  <p>"The bloodline transformation?"</p>

  <p>Natalie cried, stunned.</p>

  <p>All the human women who had stayed in the Li Shan mountain had the bloodline of the Snake Goddess race, but they didn't have the physique of the race.</p>

  <p>Similarly, although Feng Ge had the bloodline of the Jin Wu, she couldn't materialize two wings like the demon women of the Divine Liar.</p>

  <p>Yan's slender legs were surrounded by a glimmer of light and completely disappeared, turning into a cyan green snake tail. She had completely transformed into a Snake Goddess girl!</p>

  <p>Then, a hairline crack appeared on Yan's forehead, and a tiny shaft emerged from the crack.</p>

  <p>The shaft looked ordinary, but it seemed to contain a strange force.</p>

  <p>Fuxi stood outside the world, expressionless as he watched Yan transform.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Mount's jaw dropped in shock. Even when the Evil God and Luo Zheng had summoned their worlds, he had remained calm. However, at the sight of the small shaft that emerged from Yan's forehead, he was stunned, eyes filled with disbelief.</p>

  <p>"Is that... the Energy Shaft?" Mount asked with uncertainty.</p>

  <p>Fuxi cast a cold glance at him. "It's just a prototype. It's the only one that has been cultivated successfully, but... Should I just kill you?"</p>

  <p>Fuxi didn't even try to hide his antagonism towards Mount and the Chaos Ancient God behind him. Naturally, he refused to disclose any useful information to him.</p>

  <p>"It's useless to kill me, because I'm not the only one who sees it." Mount smiled. "Unless you kill all those leaders outside..."</p>

  <p>Fuxi didn't reply. Instead, he fixed his gaze on Yan.</p>

  <p>She was a talented and powerful girl, considered the best of her generation from the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>But no matter how talented she was, she wasn't worth so much attention from Fuxi.</p>

  <p>The only reason he was mildly interested in her was the Energy Shaft within her body.</p>

  <p>Previously, some had guessed that the entire chaos was not what it seemed.</p>

  <p>Time, space, and energy-- these were all concepts perceived by people.</p>

  <p>The more perceptive a person was, the better they gripped these.</p>

  <p>Space could be folded, space channels could be constructed, and people could move instantaneously via Grand Teleportation in the space.</p>

  <p>Time could be compressed, and even be traced back.</p>

  <p>As for energy, it could be transformed.</p>

  <p>There were always creatures who would painstakingly devote their entire lives to studying these things.</p>

  <p>Once, someone had even discovered a unique civilization on the Other Shore. It was known as the Calculation Civilization.</p>

  <p>This civilization could hardly be ranked in the top 1, 000 among all civilizations. It was only considered as a secondary ruling force. In that round of chaos where the Calculation Civilization emerged, there was also another powerful ruling force.</p>

  <p>The Calculation Civilization was actually considered extremely weak in terms of strength. Hence, not long after they had entered the Other Shore, they had grown extinct.</p>

  <p>However, it was this very civilization that had managed to almost complete the Finale Way!</p>

  <p>The methods they had used were quite different from other civilizations'.</p>

  <p>They didn't focus all their energy on the Other Shore, and concluded that they wouldn't be able to complete the Finale Way by merely relying on the Other Shore's strength.</p>

  <p>In order to complete the Finale Way, one had to understand the nature of the whole chaos. Consequently, one needed to grasp the three essential natures of the chaos: space, time, and energy.</p>

  <p>This civilization had inferred that time and space were transformation forms of the energy in the flowing process, hence, the essence was energy. As long as the energy flow was affected on a higher level, it could rebuild or even destroy everything.</p>

  <p>And the key to achieve this was exactly the Energy Shaft.</p>
