<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was in an anonymous state, so his face was distorted into a constant blur and Hardy couldn't discern the difference in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Now, after absorbing the Destruction Godly Way into his Infinity Ruler, Luo Zheng put more distance between Hardy and himself.</p>

  <p>He paused for about five seconds, and then with a gentle wave of his hand, he slowly emitted a bright white light from his palm.</p>

  <p>As the light condensed, it turned into a broad blade radiance.</p>

  <p>The most powerful way of using a Godly Way was to activate it with the momentum; a Godly Way had to be matched with one's Godly Tile.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng didn't have a Godly Tile, the internal momentum of the Destruction Godly Way that he released using the chaotic energy seemed to be purer and shinier than the blade radiance that Hardy had released.</p>

  <p>"How...how is it possible?" Hardy stammered in bewilderment. He was stunned to see the large blade radiance in Zheng's hand. "You've cultivated the Destruction Godly Way too?"</p>

  <p>The Destruction Godly Way was not like the Five Elements Godly Way.</p>

  <p>There was almost no threshold to practice the Five Elements Godly Way, so the vast majority of warriors could cultivate the Five Elements Godly Way.</p>

  <p>There were many other extremely powerful Godly Ways in the divine land, but the thresholds of cultivating these Godly Ways were very high.</p>

  <p>When Hardy said that he was a little talented in cultivating the Destruction Godly Way, he was actually being modest. A warrior who cultivated the Destruction Godly Way to a certain degree would be unstoppable, but there weren't many people who were capable of doing it.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, Hardy saw Luo Zheng use the skill of the Destruction Godly Way and, overwhelmed with astonishment, wondered if Luo Zheng had just learned the Destruction Godly Way from him.</p>

  <p>But that was impossible!</p>

  <p>He had met a lot of talents in his life, including a few elders of the Qin Clan, who were all outstanding talents not only among the clan members but also among all the warriors from the Floating Islands. And yet, none of them were as talented as the warrior standing in front of Hardy now.</p>

  <p>Who else would be able to understand and comprehend the Godly Way of their opponent while battling them?</p>

  <p>If Hardy breathed so much as a word about this when the battle was over, no one would believe him.</p>

  <p>"The Destruction Godly Way is focused on destroying everything.</p>

  <p>Among hundreds of thousands of weapons, only the powerful but precise force of a blade can wield it. It is indeed the right choice to condense the light into a blade," Luo Zheng said with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>When Hardy heard these words, all his suspicions were confirmed. It was obvious that Luo Zheng had indeed just mastered the Destruction Godly Way during their battle.</p>

  <p>But it was still too unbelievable for him to accept.</p>

  <p>"You...you must have already tried to cultivate the Destruction Godly Way and encountered some bottleneck. Then, while battling me, you saw me using it and overcame that bottleneck. Am I right?" Hardy asked, desperation creeping into his voice as he tried to reach for a plausible explanation of what he had just encountered.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stirred his finger gently, causing the crescent-shaped blade radiance to begin rotating along his elbow. At the same time, he let out a faint laugh. "I'm sorry, but I can't answer you. Let's fight!"</p>

  <p>With that, a small crater appeared under Zheng's feet once again.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>As the ground trembled underneath him, Luo Zheng sprang forward. The blade radiance transformed into a bright silver arc in the air as it shot toward Hardy's head.</p>

  <p>Seeing Zheng's unstoppable momentum, Hardy swallowed hard and unwillingly released the strength in his body. The blade radiance in his hand surged again, and he had to bite the bullet to counterattack.</p>

  <p>Bitterness engulfed him. He had recently proved the Godly Way, but lost the first battle after stepping into the Arena of Legends. When he had met Luo Zheng, he had thought that he had gotten a great advantage. In fact, he had even been a little guilty. After all, it wasn't fair for him, a True God, to challenge a proving godly warrior. However, for the sake of points, he had decided to risk everything.</p>

  <p>But never had it crossed his mind that he might be the loser in this battle.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>A sharp, crisp sound resounded around them when the two rays of shiny white blade radiance collided with each other.</p>

  <p>Countless rays of blade radiance shot out of both Hardy and Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>These rays of blade radiance splashed in all directions like flying blades in the air, leaving almost no space to dodge them.</p>

  <p>As the rays of blade radiance splashed on Zheng's body, they left loud sounds, but there seemed to be no impact. If the rays of blade radiance were aimed at Zheng's skin, they would leave fine marks on his skin. And if they cut on his Redemption Armor, there would be nothing left.</p>

  <p>It seemed that Luo Zheng could resist these rays of blade radiance with his physical body alone. Hardy, on the other hand, couldn't. When the rays of blade radiance made contact with his skin, they didn't stop there. They penetrated all the way through, slicing through his bones and snapping his meridians into pieces.</p>

  <p>Cling! Cling!</p>

  <p>With just one slash, thousands of rays of blade radiance entered Hardy's body and cut off his life vitality. For a moment, he stood motionless, rooted to the spot.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng slowly retrieved his blade and stared at Hardy with an indifferent expression on his face.</p>

  <p>The first battle was much simpler than he had expected but with exemplary results.</p>

  <p>Plop!</p>

  <p>Hardy's body suddenly dropped to the ground and started to disperse. At the same time, the entire illusory world spread out in all directions, like the ripples in a pond. Slowly, everything around them disappeared and they both returned to their own rooms.</p>

  <p>On the wall of Zheng's room, new information about him appeared. His name was still a blur, but he could clearly see his points and the number of times he had won.</p>

  <p>"I only got 75 points after defeating Hardy," Luo Zheng murmured with disappointment as he looked at the change in his points.</p>

  <p>After winning a row of fights with the proving godly warriors, he had gotten an extra 200 points in each battle. In comparison, 75 points was a small amount.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng understood that, according to the rules, his number of consecutive wins had been reset to zero after he'd begun to challenge True Gods, which meant that he wouldn't get extra points for this battle.</p>

  <p>Anyway, when a low-rank True God challenged another low-rank True God, the winner would only gain 15 points if it was their first non-consecutive win.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, on the other hand, had been able to obtain five times that amount of points, because he was merely a proving godly warrior while his opponent was a low-rank True God. The extra 60 points he had gotten was his reward for winning a battle against an opponent who was at a higher cultivation level than him.</p>

  <p>In order to gain millions of points, Luo Zheng had to challenge warriors whose cultivation levels were higher than his and had to win consecutively without losing even once. This was Joy's plan, and she had faith in Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Outside the Hall of True Gods, the low-rank True Gods were waiting in front of Zheng's door.</p>

  <p>"What the hell is Hardy doing? It's taking him such a long time to defeat a proving godly warrior!"</p>

  <p>"Maybe that anonymous man has good strength. After all, a proving godly warrior who dares to challenge a low-rank True God must be a powerful warrior."</p>

  <p>"No, most of the proving godly warriors who challenge low-rank True Gods are just arrogant and are usually taught a good lesson. Hahaha!"</p>

  <p>There had been very few proving godly warriors who had been able to defeat low-rank True Gods in the history of the Arena of Legends, so it was natural for these low-rank True Gods to look down on the anonymous opponent that Hardy was facing.</p>

  <p>While they were discussing the battle, the door of Zheng's room suddenly flashed. Then, it turned into a blue ray of light and quickly shot upward from the side of the Hall of True Gods.</p>

  <p>"Huh? His door...is moving up!"</p>

  <p>"The rank of the anonymous man has risen!"</p>

  <p>"He actually defeated Hardy..."</p>

  <p>The low-rank True Gods who had been waiting for the anonymous man to emerge could do nothing but look at his door in awe and surprise as it moved up. They hadn't expected at all that Hardy would lose this battle.</p>

  <p>The rankings of these doors in the Hall of True Gods represented the warriors' rankings.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had never been ranked so far, so his name would not be displayed on the Jade Wall of Legends. However, the position of his door would still change.</p>

  <p>Now that Luo Zheng had won the match with Hardy, his rank and his door rose up sixteen spots.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>The mobile blue light quickly transformed into the shape of a door frame before fading.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the door of Hardy's room swung two spots downward.</p>

  <p>He had already reached the bottom floor, so he couldn't lose much. It was impossible for him to fall to the level of proving godly warriors.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>While the low-rank True Gods were discussing the outcome of the battle with disbelief on their faces, Hardy walked out of his room with a gloomy expression.</p>

  <p>"Hardy, were you really defeated by that anonymous man?"</p>

  <p>"Did you lose to him on purpose? Or because of your carelessness?"</p>

  <p>"Or is it because that guy is really capable?"</p>

  <p>When Hardy heard these anxious questions, his disappointment was replaced by annoyance. He had always been a fair person, and had thought that it was unfair to fight with the anonymous man whose cultivation level was lower than his. And yet, Hardy had lost to him. It had come as a heavy blow to him.</p>

  <p>A wicked thought emerged from his irritated mood. With a sly expression on his face, he said to them, "That guy's strength is ordinary. I was just too careless. Otherwise, I wouldn't have lost to him!"</p>
