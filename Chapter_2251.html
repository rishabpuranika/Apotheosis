  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was in an anonymous state, so his face was distorted into a constant blur and Hardy couldn't discern the difference in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Now, after absorbing the Destruction Divine Dao into his Infinity Ruler, Luo Luo Zheng put more distance between Hardy and himself.</p>

  <p>He paused for about five seconds, and then with a gentle wave of his hand, he slowly emitted a bright white light from his palm.</p>

  <p>As the light condensed, it turned into a broad blade radiance.</p>

  <p>The most powerful way of using a Divine Dao was to activate it with the momentum; a Divine Dao had to be matched with one's Godly Tile.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng didn't have a Godly Tile, the internal momentum of the Destruction Divine Dao that he released using the chaotic energy seemed to be purer and shinier than the blade radiance that Hardy had released.</p>

  <p>"How...how is it possible?" Hardy stammered in bewilderment. He was stunned to see the large blade radiance in Luo Zheng's hand. "You've cultivated the Destruction Divine Dao too?"</p>

  <p>The Destruction Divine Dao was not like the Five Elements Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>There was almost no threshold to practice the Five Elements Divine Dao, so the vast majority of warriors could cultivate the Five Elements Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>There were many other extremely powerful Divine Dao in the divine land, but the thresholds of cultivating these Divine Dao were very high.</p>

  <p>When Hardy said that he was a little talented in cultivating the Destruction Divine Dao, he was actually being modest. A warrior who cultivated the Destruction Divine Dao to a certain degree would be unstoppable, but there weren't many people who were capable of doing it.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, Hardy saw Luo Luo Zheng use the skill of the Destruction Divine Dao and, overwhelmed with astonishment, wondered if Luo Luo Zheng had just learned the Destruction Divine Dao from him.</p>

  <p>But that was impossible!</p>

  <p>He had met a lot of talents in his life, including a few elders of the Qin Clan, who were all outstanding talents not only among the clan members but also among all the warriors from the Floating Islands. And yet, none of them were as talented as the warrior standing in front of Hardy now.</p>

  <p>Who else would be able to understand and comprehend the Divine Dao of their opponent while battling them?</p>

  <p>If Hardy breathed so much as a word about this when the battle was over, no one would believe him.</p>

  <p>"The Destruction Divine Dao is focused on destroying everything.</p>

  <p>Among hundreds of thousands of weapons, only the powerful but precise force of a blade can wield it. It is indeed the right choice to condense the light into a blade," Luo Luo Zheng said with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>When Hardy heard these words, all his suspicions were confirmed. It was obvious that Luo Luo Zheng had indeed just mastered the Destruction Divine Dao during their battle.</p>

  <p>But it was still too unbelievable for him to accept.</p>

  <p>"You...you must have already tried to cultivate the Destruction Divine Dao and encountered some bottleneck. Then, while battling me, you saw me using it and overcame that bottleneck. Am I right?" Hardy asked, desperation creeping into his voice as he tried to reach for a plausible explanation of what he had just encountered.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stirred his finger gently, causing the crescent-shaped blade radiance to begin rotating along his elbow. At the same time, he let out a faint laugh. "I'm sorry, but I can't answer you. Let's fight!"</p>

  <p>With that, a small crater appeared under Luo Zheng's feet once again.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>As the ground trembled underneath him, Luo Luo Zheng sprang forward. The blade radiance transformed into a bright silver arc in the air as it shot toward Hardy's head.</p>

  <p>Seeing Luo Zheng's unstoppable momentum, Hardy swallowed hard and unwillingly released the strength in his body. The blade radiance in his hand surged again, and he had to bite the bullet to counterattack.</p>

  <p>Bitterness engulfed him. He had recently proved the Divine Dao, but lost the first battle after stepping into the Arena of Legends. When he had met Luo Luo Zheng, he had thought that he had gotten a great advantage. In fact, he had even been a little guilty. After all, it wasn't fair for him, a True God, to challenge a proving godly warrior. However, for the sake of points, he had decided to risk everything.</p>

  <p>But never had it crossed his mind that he might be the loser in this battle.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>A sharp, crisp sound resounded around them when the two rays of shiny white blade radiance collided with each other.</p>

  <p>Countless rays of blade radiance shot out of both Hardy and Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>These rays of blade radiance splashed in all directions like flying blades in the air, leaving almost no space to dodge them.</p>

  <p>As the rays of blade radiance splashed on Luo Zheng's body, they left loud sounds, but there seemed to be no impact. If the rays of blade radiance were aimed at Luo Zheng's skin, they would leave fine marks on his skin. And if they cut on his Redemption Armor, there would be nothing left.</p>

  <p>It seemed that Luo Luo Zheng could resist these rays of blade radiance with his physical body alone. Hardy, on the other hand, couldn't. When the rays of blade radiance made contact with his skin, they didn't stop there. They penetrated all the way through, slicing through his bones and snapping his meridians into pieces.</p>

  <p>Cling! Cling!</p>

  <p>With just one slash, thousands of rays of blade radiance entered Hardy's body and cut off his life vitality. For a moment, he stood motionless, rooted to the spot.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng slowly retrieved his blade and stared at Hardy with an indifferent expression on his face.</p>

  <p>The first battle was much simpler than he had expected but with exemplary results.</p>

  <p>Plop!</p>

  <p>Hardy's body suddenly dropped to the ground and started to disperse. At the same time, the entire illusory world spread out in all directions, like the ripples in a pond. Slowly, everything around them disappeared and they both returned to their own rooms.</p>

  <p>On the wall of Luo Zheng's room, new information about him appeared. His name was still a blur, but he could clearly see his points and the number of times he had won.</p>

  <p>"I only got 75 points after defeating Hardy," Luo Luo Zheng murmured with disappointment as he looked at the change in his points.</p>

  <p>After winning a row of fights with the proving godly warriors, he had gotten an extra 200 points in each battle. In comparison, 75 points was a small amount.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng understood that, according to the rules, his number of consecutive wins had been reset to zero after he'd begun to challenge True Gods, which meant that he wouldn't get extra points for this battle.</p>

  <p>Anyway, when a low-rank True God challenged another low-rank True God, the winner would only gain 15 points if it was their first non-consecutive win.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, on the other hand, had been able to obtain five times that amount of points, because he was merely a proving godly warrior while his opponent was a low-rank True God. The extra 60 points he had gotten was his reward for winning a battle against an opponent who was at a higher cultivation level than him.</p>

  <p>In order to gain millions of points, Luo Luo Zheng had to challenge warriors whose cultivation levels were higher than his and had to win consecutively without losing even once. This was Joy's plan, and she had faith in Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Outside the Hall of True Gods, the low-rank True Gods were waiting in front of Luo Zheng's door.</p>

  <p>"What the hell is Hardy doing? It's taking him such a long time to defeat a proving godly warrior!"</p>

  <p>"Maybe that anonymous man has good strength. After all, a proving godly warrior who dares to challenge a low-rank True God must be a powerful warrior."</p>

  <p>"No, most of the proving godly warriors who challenge low-rank True Gods are just arrogant and are usually taught a good lesson. Hahaha!"</p>

  <p>There had been very few proving godly warriors who had been able to defeat low-rank True Gods in the history of the Arena of Legends, so it was natural for these low-rank True Gods to look down on the anonymous opponent that Hardy was facing.</p>

  <p>While they were discussing the battle, the door of Luo Zheng's room suddenly flashed. Then, it turned into a blue ray of light and quickly shot upward from the side of the Hall of True Gods.</p>

  <p>"Huh? His door...is moving up!"</p>

  <p>"The rank of the anonymous man has risen!"</p>

  <p>"He actually defeated Hardy..."</p>

  <p>The low-rank True Gods who had been waiting for the anonymous man to emerge could do nothing but look at his door in awe and surprise as it moved up. They hadn't expected at all that Hardy would lose this battle.</p>

  <p>The rankings of these doors in the Hall of True Gods represented the warriors' rankings.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had never been ranked so far, so his name would not be displayed on the Jade Wall of Legends. However, the position of his door would still change.</p>

  <p>Now that Luo Luo Zheng had won the match with Hardy, his rank and his door rose up sixteen spots.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>The mobile blue light quickly transformed into the shape of a door frame before fading.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the door of Hardy's room swung two spots downward.</p>

  <p>He had already reached the bottom floor, so he couldn't lose much. It was impossible for him to fall to the level of proving godly warriors.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>While the low-rank True Gods were discussing the outcome of the battle with disbelief on their faces, Hardy walked out of his room with a gloomy expression.</p>

  <p>"Hardy, were you really defeated by that anonymous man?"</p>

  <p>"Did you lose to him on purpose? Or because of your carelessness?"</p>

  <p>"Or is it because that guy is really capable?"</p>

  <p>When Hardy heard these anxious questions, his disappointment was replaced by annoyance. He had always been a fair person, and had thought that it was unfair to fight with the anonymous man whose cultivation level was lower than his. And yet, Hardy had lost to him. It had come as a heavy blow to him.</p>

  <p>A wicked thought emerged from his irritated mood. With a sly expression on his face, he said to them, "That guy's strength is ordinary. I was just too careless. Otherwise, I wouldn't have lost to him!"</p>
