</p>

  <p>Drawing up a sect-protecting array was far more complicated as opposed to the enchanted barrier which Luo Luo Zheng had drawn on the stage last time.</p>

  <p>Before anything else, a sect-protecting array needed the existence of an enchanted barrier that would keep the entire sect safe. By comparison, even the residence of a small sect was still significantly larger than a battle arena.</p>

  <p>One could look at the Cloud Sect as an example. Its full location was close to being just as big as the Burning Sky Empire.</p>

  <p>That being said, Cloud Hall was a bit of an irregularity.</p>

  <p>Beyond everything else, it was hovering up in the clouds.</p>

  <p>In spite of the fact that it had a giant floating stone as its foundation, as a fourth-grade sect, Cloud Hall wasn't actually that big.</p>

  <p>Apart from the protective enchanted barrier, one more thing it truly needed was attacking capability. There was no way a sect-protecting array could be put up just to defend and without being able to retaliate at all.</p>

  <p>Upon exiting the Ice Palace, Felix delivered Cloud Hall's exact dimensions.</p>

  <p>Immediately following that, Luo Luo Zheng floated to the point where Cloud Hall was just beneath him and got a bird's-eye view of his surroundings before carefully going back down.</p>

  <p>"Do you have any idea just how many divine textures this sect-protecting array would necessitate?" he asked the cyan dragon.</p>

  <p>"If you're planning to use a nine-star divine texture, just a single one would be adequate," the cyan dragon answered right away.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng rolled his eyes at his response. One of those nine-star divine textures would be more than enough to lay waste to the entire Central Region.</p>

  <p>The fact was that the cyan dragon was currently incapable of drawing a nine-star divine texture. Let's just say that he could, Luo Luo Zheng still wouldn't be able to provide the materials in such a short span of time.</p>

  <p>"But the Cloud Hall isn't such a huge place. From the way I see it, it would take roughly around 4, 900 three-star and four-star divine textures in all, as well as three five-star divine textures on top of that. But above all, you would need to find sufficient materials," the cyan dragon answered straight up.</p>

  <p>Nodding his head along, Luo Luo Zheng said, "The necessary materials should be the first problem to get worked out."</p>

  <p>After receiving an approximation, Luo Luo Zheng wanted to make a list of all the materials they would be needing. He found a table and began to jot it all down. With that, he listed everything the cyan dragon recommended one by one.</p>

  <p>"Twenty rhinoceros horns."</p>

  <p>"Four rosewood logs."</p>

  <p>"One kilogram of eaglewood."</p>

  <p>"Elm..."</p>

  <p>Felix was surprised at how long the list was turning out to be. It just kept going on and on.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie had made it quite clear that Felix was simply lending Luo Luo Zheng a hand in constructing the sect-protecting array.</p>

  <p>However, each of those essential materials was actually going to be a bit too costly, and would also prove to be hard to procure.</p>

  <p>If he was really planning to secure those items as soon as he possibly could, he might end up having to cough up more than two or possibly even three times their original price.</p>

  <p>When he noticed that Felix was holding the list of materials and seemed to be completely astounded, Luo Luo Zheng walked over toward him and asked out of concern, "Is there a problem?"</p>

  <p>"These... These items?" Felix stumbled over his words as he pointed at the components written on the list.</p>

  <p>"Would you be able to gather them?" Luo Luo Zheng straightforwardly asked, wanting to confirm it. It was due to the fact that he was just a bit concerned that a few of those materials could be much too hard to obtain.</p>

  <p>"I can find them, you don't have to worry about that. But the thing is... they are going to be ridiculously expensive." Based on Felix's rough estimate, the items on the list would cost them a great deal of supreme life vitality crystals. "These materials would probably use up about half of Cloud Hall's savings, probably even more than that!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng simply smiled at him and gave him two scenarios. "Tell me, between shelling out half of the life vitality crystals and having your sect razed to the ground, which would you prefer?"</p>

  <p>"That's a foolish question! You're well aware which I would choose." Felix blurted out.</p>

  <p>"Then just go ahead and gather these materials as soon as you can, whatever it may cost. If push comes to shove, you'll have to steal them as a last resort," Luo Luo Zheng stated with a stern look on his face.</p>

  <p>Given that Luo Luo Zheng had already made himself clear, Felix promptly dispatched the numerous stewards of Cloud Hall to procure the materials.</p>

  <p>One could go on and say that the productivity and orderliness of Cloud Hall were still considerably high.</p>

  <p>Close to a third of the materials could be found directly inside Cloud Hall, and another third was spread throughout Cloudy City and the five great sects directly attached to Cloud Hall. As soon as Felix had given the order, the five great sects started delivering the materials into Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>But as for the last third of the essential materials, Felix had no choice but to purchase the components from World Commercial Alliance themselves.</p>

  <p>Every single time a material arrived, Luo Luo Zheng would check an item on the list using his thick ink brush. And slowly but surely, more and more materials were getting ticked off.</p>

  <p>By the third day, from the moment they started, all the items written on the list had already gotten checked, meaning they were able to procure everything they needed.</p>

  <p>As soon as all of the materials had been collected, Luo Luo Zheng would have to make use of Felix's space for a while.</p>

  <p>Much like Nate, who owned Runic Tower, runic experts needed certain conditions to be met for the area they would be working on. Felix's place was located on the side of Cloud Hall. If one were to glance outside from the empty hall, they could look at the rolling sea clouds, making it the best place in the hall to draw up the runes.</p>

  <p>There was a crowd of people gathering in the hall. A handful of those were Felix's underlings who were responsible for taking care of the materials as well as producing ink. Not wanting to risk messing things up due to lack of manpower, Felix decided to call a couple of other stewards to come over and give them some assistance.</p>
