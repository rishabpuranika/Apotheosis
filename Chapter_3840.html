<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>When the bronze monkey was halfway to Zheng, the bronze human on the other side caught hold of him and pulled him back.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom...</p>

  <p>The footsteps thundered loudly on the bronze square.</p>

  <p>Incensed, the bronze monkey asked, "Why did you stop me?"</p>

  <p>"This era no longer belongs to us. This place has been abandoned since ages ago and there's no need for us to guard it anymore," the bronze human said.</p>

  <p>The bronze bird and snake stopped short at these words. What was the point of them following the old rules?</p>

  <p>"I don't care. All I know is that outsiders are not allowed to step in here!"</p>

  <p>The bronze monkey's flexible body allowed him to shake off the bronze human's grip and break free. He charged towards Zheng but skidded to a halt at the bronze human's next words.</p>

  <p>"What if he is not an outsider?</p>

  <p>This place is sealed by the Time Lock. It would be impossible for any outsider to enter the Eternal Divine Courtyard.</p>

  <p>Do you think he has the ability to break the Time Lock and force his way in?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not sure," the bronze monkey said hesitantly.</p>

  <p>"We can first check if he is qualified. Even if he isn't, we can let him try," the bronze human said.</p>

  <p>They knew that this place was abandoned but were still faithfully fulfilling their duties.</p>

  <p>A vast majority of the people who entered the Eternal Divine Courtyard could only obtain the source-level bloodlines that were at the bottom, while a few could obtain the root-level bloodlines. Very few could take away one of the four origin-level bloodlines.</p>

  <p>The warriors who could enter this bronze square were all top existences in their respective worlds.</p>

  <p>But even they often failed. It was considered lucky even if two out of ten people could succeed.</p>

  <p>There were hardly any people who could obtain the ancestry-level bloodline. People from these worlds were not qualified, which was why they took it for granted that this human who had suddenly appeared wasn't qualified either.</p>

  <p>The bronze monkey hesitated for a moment and then gathered his wits before saying, "Are you out of your mind? Who else is qualified aside from them? Killing him is the right thing!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's attention snapped back into vigilance as the bronze monkey spoke.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Obsession Civilization hadn't translated the words of these statues at the beginning. But Zheng heard them clearly, now that the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization had been activated.</p>

  <p>They thought he was not qualified enough, which was why they were planning to kill him.</p>

  <p>However, the bronze human smiled. "Let him in since he's already here. If he doesn't have the qualifications, he can't escape death. It will save you the energy of killing him. Don't you think you should give him a chance?"</p>

  <p>There would be a price to pay if one failed to acquire the origin-level bloodline. For example, the trees in the Myriad Birth and Destruction, and the permanent imprisonment by the cubes of the Infinite Time and Space were the ends that some warriors had met when they had failed.</p>

  <p>The ancestry-level bloodline was stricter, and Zheng would die if he failed.</p>

  <p>The bronze monkey was still hesitant. He felt that giving Zheng a chance was an act irreverent to the Eternal Divine Courtyard. But the snake and bird beside him agreed unanimously with the bronze human.</p>

  <p>"Giving him a chance is not such a big deal."</p>

  <p>"Let him choose his manner of death, since he is going to die anyway."</p>

  <p>The bronze snake and the bronze bird were saying thus only because they had been in here for far too long, devoid of any entertainment. They just wanted to see something new.</p>

  <p>They didn't care if Zheng could obtain the ancestry-level bloodline or not, or whether or not he would die.</p>

  <p>Since everyone else thought the same, the bronze monkey realized that it was meaningless to insist. He scoffed impatiently and retreated a couple of steps, still staring at Zheng with hostility.</p>

  <p>Clump! Clump...</p>

  <p>The bronze human walked up to Zheng and asked, "Can you understand me?"</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded, and at the same time, a chorus sounded from his inner world as if to reply, "Yes."</p>

  <p>"It's a strange way of communication," the bronze human remarked, looking curiously at Zheng. "It's good that we can communicate. And since you understand what we were just talking, there's only one way out for you."</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The bronze human stomped his feet, and the bronze square began to shine.</p>

  <p>The bronze wine cup at the center of the square began to emit a brilliant light that formed a bright road that stretched all the way up to Zheng's feet.</p>

  <p>"You can survive only if you can merge with the bloodline. You will die otherwise. I helped you get this chance only because I am of your kind. You have to depend on yourself from now on," the bronze human said as he walked towards his pillar.</p>

  <p>"Sir?"</p>

  <p>Zheng had a number of doubts.</p>

  <p>These bronze statues, however, were not "sirs". They were just a group of bronze puppets with memories and emotions.</p>

  <p>They wouldn't heed Zheng's other requests.</p>

  <p>The four giant statues quickly returned to the pillars. The light in their eyes dimmed and they turned into real statues.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyebrows shot up as he looked at the shiny road under his feet. "It looks like there's no way back."</p>

  <p>Zheng had clearly heard the conversation between the statues.</p>

  <p>Inheriting the ancestry-level bloodline wasn't dependent on perseverance, talent, or strength. Instead, it needed some specific qualifications.</p>

  <p>Judging from the monkey's attitude, it was obvious that he wasn't qualified.</p>

  <p>Did this mean that he would most definitely die, since he was not qualified?</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid you won't get a chance to go back." The Primeval Lord of Heaven's voice sounded in Zheng's mind, a bitter smile lacing through it.</p>

  <p>Zheng heaved a sigh. "It looks like the spider man trapped in the lower layer didn't know all this. All I can do is try my best."</p>

  <p>Zheng had been confident when he had been in the big vortex.</p>

  <p>After all, the fox girl had given him a unique ability, enabling him to walk freely within the Eternal Scroll Painting.</p>

  <p>But he did not have anything special to rely on here, especially since obtaining the ancestry-level bloodline was more than the fox girl had expected of him. He was unsure about whether or not he could succeed.</p>

  <p>Zheng followed this path and came upon the huge cup.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>As Zheng approached the cup, the lights rose inch by inch and formed a staircase that finally reached the rim of the cup.</p>

  <p>Zheng walked up the stairs and as he reached the peak, he saw everything that was in the cup.</p>

  <p>The cup was filled with a thick, crimson liquid that seemed to be in a constant state of motion.</p>

  <p>As the liquid flowed, deep cracks, irregular like the teeth of a monster, appeared from time to time.</p>

  <p>The liquid in this cup began to react the moment Zheng stepped on the stairs.</p>

  <p>A chasm seemed to appear at the center of the liquid, expanding rapidly and turning into a monster with its large mouth wide open.</p>

  <p>Zheng hesitated as he stood on the steps before walking forward into the big bloody mouth.</p>

  <p>The thick blood wrapped around Zheng the moment it touched his body. From the outside, it looked like he was wearing a well-fitting blood robe. .</p>

  <p>A few seconds later, countless tiny bubbles appeared on the surface of the blood robe, making it look like the blood was boiling.</p>

  <p>The blood robe began to shrink rapidly, a large amount of thick blood beginning to merge with Zheng in the process.</p>
