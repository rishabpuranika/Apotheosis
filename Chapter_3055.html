<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Valued at just one and a half million divine crystals, the Godly Ways Blending Swordsmanship was considered as the most affordable item amongst the supreme swordsmanship manuals.</p>

  <p>But this was an incomplete manual. Plus, this theurgy didn't involve any Truth of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>The uncertainty that if Zheng could afford such an expense lingered in Monica's mind. Still, even if he could, logic hindered him from draining so many divine crystals.</p>

  <p>Without a shadow of a doubt, Zheng stated with conviction, "I want the Godly Ways Blending Swordsmanship."</p>

  <p>"Huh?"</p>

  <p>The guardian of Truth Library raised his eyebrows questioningly, stumped with his words.</p>

  <p>It was Eastern Emperor Taiyi who invented the Godly Ways Blending Swordsmanship, so the strength it held was indeed powerful and impressive. But this manual was an incomplete one, and it was common sense that blending Godly Ways wouldn't work. So it really came as a surprise to the guardian that Zheng decided to buy the manual.</p>

  <p>"Have you blended the Godly Ways before?" the voice asked.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded his consent. "Yes, I have. So, the Godly Ways Blending Swordsmanship is suited for someone with experience like me."</p>

  <p>"Very well, young man. I'm fascinated to know of your familiarity with blending the Godly Ways at a very tender age. And I wonder how many Godly Ways have you blended? Three? Perhaps five? If the number was insignificant, heed my advice and give it up. The most basic figure estimated for the Godly Ways Blending Swordsmanship to be fully cultivated is five hundred."</p>

  <p>The Godly Ways Blending Swordsmanship was very powerful. Even if one used the Godly Ways' internal momenta to carry out the swordsmanship, they could fight against Other Shore Realm warriors. If anybody excelled in using this swordsmanship, they could attain supremacy.</p>

  <p>But the time and trouble spent in blending so many Godly Ways could prove worthless to any person. They opted to venture and set sail towards the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Absorbing all the information from the voice, Zheng lifted his right hand close to the chest, palm facing up.</p>

  <p>As the internal momenta of different Godly Ways in his inner world continuously merged, the synthesized energy surfaced in Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>"Isn't it sufficient to blend five hundred Godly Ways?" Zheng consulted.</p>

  <p>The energy in his hand emanated from the cohesion of five hundred Godly Ways. Since the voice said five hundred was enough, Zheng didn't even bother to blend one more.</p>

  <p>The truth was witnesses found it difficult to calculate how many Godly Ways Zheng had blended. But as they followed the unstable energy in his hand flickering like a candle even when there was no discernible breeze, they became believers of his words.</p>

  <p>A polite smile surfaced on Monica's face. The energy of blended Godly Ways Zheng manifested the other day showed more complexity and power than it did now. She became curious and thought to herself, 'How many Godly Ways had this young man studied?'</p>

  <p>Surprised with what he just witnessed, the voice blurted, "Well, that would be enough. If you intend to acquire the Godly Ways Blending Swordsmanship, you can have it."</p>

  <p>Zheng pursed his lips, his face revealing a smile of bemused satisfaction as he gawked at the swordsmanship manual in the light column.</p>

  <p>Then he made his way to the last light column.</p>

  <p>Once he reached the light column, he saw a sheet of yellow paper instead of a swordsmanship manual.</p>

  <p>"What is this?" Zheng stared at the thin sheet.</p>

  <p>He squinted at the texts written on the paper, his vision blinded by the fluorescent light from the column. He found it impossible for a swordsmanship manual to be recorded in a measly palm-sized note.</p>

  <p>The voice proclaimed, "That is the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent."</p>

  <p>Zheng and Monica felt stunned, rooted to where they stood.</p>

  <p>The Truths of Godly Ways hardly existed in the divine land, but they were common in the Source World. Zheng pondered how a sheet of paper that recorded the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent appeared here.</p>

  <p>"In the middle ages, a vast majority of living creatures adhered to the Truth of Cultivation Nature. Eastern Emperor Taiyi formed a division of Truth of Eternal Sword Intent and passed through the Sea of Truth with it. His venture laid the foundation for the Oneness Sky Palace which has become another great human sect. The Sanskrit words inscribed in this sheet of yellow paper originated from the Other Shore," the voice added.</p>

  <p>"So the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent never originated from Eastern Emperor Taiyi," Monica murmured under her breath.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha, the thirteen Truths of Godly Ways were all created by those unforeseen creatures. How could we have such wisdom? The outside world acknowledged Eastern Emperor Taiyi as the creator of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, but all those rumors are baseless and misleading. It was him, though, who brought the Truth of Godly Way back from the Other Shore," the voice said with a chuckle.</p>

  <p>'The unforeseen creatures? Did he mean the creatures from the Other Shore?' Zheng pondered to himself.</p>

  <p>When he was in the divine land, he envisioned that all the creatures from the chaos and the Source World were extraordinary creatures. Now, it seemed that his judgment at that time was wrong.</p>

  <p>The real extraordinary creatures belonged to the civilization who invented Sanskrit words and stayed in the depths of the Other Shore. However, it seemed that the majority of the population was oblivious to the existence of the extraordinary creatures. Even if they heard of them, they knew next to nothing about them.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 was definitely aware of the extraordinary creatures, but it declined to impart its wisdom with Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Then why did you put this yellow paper here?" Zheng quizzed, rubbing his chin.</p>

  <p>"For ten million divine crystals, you can borrow the paper for a day," the voice offered.</p>

  <p>'He must be crazy!' Monica inaudibly scoffed to herself, bothered with the unfair proposal. Veins could be seen pulsating in her neck.</p>

  <p>Even if this sheet of paper carried the original text of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, what could it really do? Its copies could be bought easily at a much lower price in the Source World. Its significance proved worthless if the cost of borrowing alone amounted to ten million divine crystals. Who in their right mind would pay that amount in just one day?</p>

  <p>Zheng looked startled when he heard this proposition, but he wasn't as surprised as Monica. Now that the other party offered such a price, something remarkable must be in it.</p>

  <p>"Haha! Although Eastern Emperor Taiyi previously unraveled the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, some valuable information was left there on the yellow paper. If someone could decipher it, a hundred million divine crystals would be worth the struggle, let alone ten million," countered the voice.</p>

  <p>Monica asked with bated breath, "But nobody cracked it for so many years, and even Eastern Emperor Taiyi himself failed to do it. Are you expecting others to decode the information in it? How's that possible?"</p>

  <p>"Anything is possible. Eastern Emperor Taiyi laid the yellow paper here, hoping someone would decode it one day," the voice asserted.</p>

  <p>Zheng studied the yellow paper with deep interest. But then again, even Eastern Emperor Taiyi himself strived to get to the bottom of this and failed. Could Geoffrey do it?</p>

  <p>Ten million divine crystals!</p>

  <p>If Geoffrey attempted to solve it but failed, then these ten million divine crystals would be in vain. Besides, the information inscribed on the yellow paper could be worthless as well.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng kept plenty of wealth and ten million divine crystals seemed insignificant to him, he was confronted with a complicated task ahead. He needed to assess every circumstance before he could start allotting divine crystals at will.</p>

  <p>Just then, a figure formed at the door of the strange place and yelled from a distance, "Zheng, are you here?"</p>

  <p>Overhearing Dorothy's familiar voice, Zheng spun around and noticed her.</p>

  <p>"Why did you come to the third floor of the Truth Library? The high-priced supreme swordsmanship manuals here should be treated with caution. If you need one of them, I can ask Aunt Felicity to furnish you with a copy.</p>

  <p>Which one do you like?" Dorothy pointed out.</p>

  <p>Monica felt her heart flutter with shock. She wondered how this young woman's aunt could provide a copy of any of the supreme swordsmanship manuals here. Who was this young girl? Monica hoped to learn her identity.</p>

  <p>The guardian of the Truth Library got furious when he heard that. Sensing that his business was about to be disrupted, he exploded, "Who dared to trespass into the Truth Library?"</p>

  <p>Dorothy walked cautiously along the patterns on the wooden floor. As she approached Zheng, a funny grin stretching from ear to ear covered her face.</p>

  <p>Her childlike and energetic face remained naturally beautiful. She said to the void, "Come on, Uncle Wilfred, you forgot me already? It's me, Dora."</p>
