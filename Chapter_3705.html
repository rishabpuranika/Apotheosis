  <p>
</p>

  <p>Silence hung in the air as the Primeval Lord of Heaven, the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and the others stared at Luo Zheng and waited for his decision.</p>

  <p>There were many reasons Luo Nian should stay and help Ziya, such as to help the human race and for the Finale Way.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Nian was still Luo Zheng's son, and it was normal for a father to worry about his son's safety.</p>

  <p>Finally, Luo Zheng came to a decision. "I will tell your mother that you are here to learn martial arts," he said.</p>

  <p>When Luo Nian heard those words, excitement quickly replaced his previously upset expression.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shook his head at the instant change in his son's attitude, but he still reminded him, "Although I allow you to enter the Abstruse Energy World, you have to know that this is not my inner world.</p>

  <p>Only you can save yourself once you are in danger..."</p>

  <p>It wasn't a problem for Luo Nian to turn the world upside down within his inner world, but of course, the real world was much harsher. "I know,"</p>

  <p>Luo Nian said affectionately. He was touched as he felt his father's deep love for him.</p>

  <p>But he was no longer young, and he had the burden of living under his father's glory before. It was time for him to march alone.</p>

  <p>He had grown up listening to all the legends of Luo Zheng back when he was in the Cloud Hall. Later on, he went to the divine land and met many powerful warriors like Yu Shengfeng, Joy and the others? but his father seemed to be far too stronger than them.</p>

  <p>Then, he arrived at the Source World and was kept in his father's inner world for quite some time.</p>

  <p>During that time, it seemed that his father only contacted him when he needed to decipher Sanskrit words. It looked like Luo Zheng forgot about him most of the time.</p>

  <p>Still, he understood that his father had been very busy and hadn't stopped a bit for over a hundred years.</p>

  <p>But the busier he was, the more Luo Nian wanted to prove that he was very useful!</p>

  <p>It was probably impossible to catch up with his father in terms of cultivation, but travelling in the Abstruse Energy World was his strong point.</p>

  <p>Besides, these great warriors who seemed to be mightier than his father all placed great importance on the Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>Most importantly, he also liked the feeling of staying in the Abstruse Energy World. He wanted to continue exploring that world!</p>

  <p>A while later, Ziya invited Luo Zheng, the Primeval Lord of Heaven, and the others to move within the palace.</p>

  <p>He had already shown the Abstruse Energy World to everyone, but aside from that, he also needed to consult the Primeval Lord of Heaven on how to transform the Deleting Space.</p>

  <p>In the last countless years, he worked hard alone in this space. Now that more people with ideas came along, he truly felt less pressured.</p>

  <p>After more than half a day in the palace, they suddenly heard a violent roar that came from somewhere in the Deleting Space. At the same time, a bright blue flash of light appeared.</p>

  <p>Everyone was confused when they heard the strange sound. They all turned to Ziya, as if to ask him about what happened.</p>

  <p>In turn, Ziya looked to the north of the Deleting Space and said, "It started again. Recently, that Chaos Ancient God seems to be very active."</p>

  <p>He gently waved his hand as he spoke.</p>

  <p>The space above him turned into a mirror-like object and projected the current scene in the north.</p>

  <p>In the north was a floating blob of red lava. .</p>

  <p>Bubbles constantly appeared on its surface and emitted a scorching hot energy. "How could Othniel delete such a large space?" Luo Zheng asked as his eyes widened in awe.</p>

  <p>"It has been like this recently," Ziya nodded. "Is there any fierce battle going on in the Source World?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shook his head in confusion.</p>

  <p>Although the Source World was not peaceful currently, the Chaos Ancient Gods weren't involved in the battles. He didn't know why Othniel kept deleting spaces.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, something began to brew in the Dust Blood Province.</p>

  <p>A bright beam of light burst out and illuminated the area.</p>

  <p>Flames combusted from the Minimum Space and spread at an alarmingly fast rate.</p>

  <p>It wasn't long before the whole Dust Blood Province was covered in flames.</p>

  <p>There was no emotion on Divine Farmer's face as he watched the flames spread. Then, he turned around and left.</p>

  <p>The flames would kill most of the creatures in the Dust Blood Province, but Divine Farmer was already numb to such a slaughter. After all, he had witnessed so much.</p>

  <p>A few moments later, he showed up in another province. With a flick of his finger, a dot of fire bloomed once again.</p>

  <p>Trillions of creatures in every province he set fire on perished!</p>

  <p>There had been countless fights and disputes in the Source World ever since its birth. Needless to say, the number of creatures that died in several past major battles was no less than horrifying.</p>

  <p>Among the many battles that broke out by the end of the middle ages, the melee between several races was the most tragic. Almost all the races had been involved in that war, leading to extremely large casualties!</p>

  <p>Usman was born after the melee among the various races.</p>

  <p>He was transformed from the negative emotions of the Source World and quickly rose in a short period of time. When he was at his peak, he had even surpassed the captain of the Black Ship and became someone who all forces feared.</p>

  <p>Later on, as Usman defected, the captain of the Black Ship had no choice but to join hands with other super forces to kill him.</p>

  <p>Many years passed since Usman had died but those who had gone through that battle knew his strength like the back of their hands.</p>

  <p>He was a fiend who lurked in the Source World. He was everywhere, waiting for someone to wake him up.</p>

  <p>If the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race wanted to start a war that would affect the entire Source World, they might also wake that fiend up.</p>

  <p>And to set fire on provinces with the flames from the Minimum Spaces was undoubtedly the most economical method.</p>

  <p>Five minutes later, Divine Farmer appeared in the White Seal Province.</p>

  <p>Just as he was about to take out the Minimum Space, a giant eagle shadow appeared in front of him.</p>

  <p>It was from the Gale Eagle race in the White Seal Province.</p>

  <p>The Gale Eagle race wasn't very famous in the Source World, but they had a quite strong leader.</p>

  <p>Although he didn't become an Eternal Warrior at the Eternal Realm, he had been in Stage Thirty-two for a long time.</p>

  <p>Back then, the leader of the Gale Eagle race had once helped the Divine Farmer race on the Other Shore. "Why did you set fire everywhere and burn down trillions of innocent creatures?" the Gale Eagle asked.</p>

  <p>"Mission," Divine Farmer answered briefly.</p>

  <p>"Can you let go of the White Seal Province?" the Gale Eagle asked again.</p>

  <p>"No," said Divine Farmer, a hint of pity in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"But you can lead the Gale Eagle race to leave," he added.</p>

  <p>The Gale Eagle was clearly disappointed. He shouted, "The White Seal Province is the ancestral home of our race, so how can we easily give it up?</p>

  <p>You'll burn it over my dead body!"</p>

  <p>Since Divine Farmer was an Eternal Warrior, he was far stronger than the Gale Eagle. The Gale Eagle naturally knew that resistance was futile and he would be like a mantis trying to stop a chariot. Thus, he was ready to die.</p>

  <p>"You once helped us before. Please don't make things difficult for me," said Divine Farmer.</p>

  <p>However, the Gale Eagle turned a deaf ear to his plea. At that moment, an Other Shore Token spun above his head. Then, he spread his wings and attacked Divine Farmer.</p>

  <p>A few minutes later, the eagle with broken wings fell from the sky and plunged into the ground. Along with him was the Minimum Space with a dot of flame.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, the provinces burned to ashes one by one. Restlessness and misery hung like a thick blanket throughout the Source World.</p>

  <p>When there was a slight conflict between creatures and races, they would pull out their weapons and attack each other. It happened so much that there were endless conflicts amongst races!</p>

  <p>Not long after, the negativity in the Source World escalated to the extreme, then suddenly vanished without a trace.</p>

  <p>While all of those happened, a new creature was born in one corner of the Source World. This creature emitted an intense aura of evilness.</p>
