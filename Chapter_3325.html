<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The creatures of the Dark Region were all in a cold sweat after seeing how the black monkeys and one-eyed monsters ended up.</p>

  <p>They had planned to risk everything to rush into the Green Jade City.</p>

  <p>But these creatures were not as powerful as the black monkeys or the one-eyed monsters. They couldn't just head inside, knowing how defenseless they were. All they could do now was to watch Luo Zheng and Feng Ge leave.</p>

  <p>A single purified being was enough to defeat them, so they didn't dare chase after the two.</p>

  <p>The Dark Region covered most of the Stage Thirteen area, with the extremely vast inner space.</p>

  <p>Initially, Luo Zheng thought about heading back along the mountain stream.</p>

  <p>But when Luo Zheng and Feng Ge were chased by the black monkeys, they ran in a panic. After Feng Ge destroyed a part of the mountain stream, they couldn't find the path they followed earlier.</p>

  <p>As a purified being, Feng Ge could travel through the Dark Region safely. So long as she moved in one direction throughout, she would find her way out of there.</p>

  <p>After climbing over a small hill, Luo Zheng felt the darkness around him growing heavier. The Darkness Fruit's effect was about to wear off.</p>

  <p>"Feng Ge, give me a Darkness Fruit," Luo Zheng called out to her.</p>

  <p>Instead of doing so, Feng Ge waved her hand, making a ray of light envelop his head. With a smile, she said, "You won't need any more of that fruit with this."</p>

  <p>The area the light covered was equal to the outside of the Dark Region. As it turned out, it was true that he didn't need to take the Darkness Fruit.</p>

  <p>"Is it convenient?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>To be on the safe side, it was still better to take the Darkness Fruit.</p>

  <p>But Feng Ge snorted and uttered, "If you don't want it, just leave by yourself!"</p>

  <p>He gave her a helpless look in response to her childish outburst.</p>

  <p>Although Feng Ge was clearly a little mad, she was still less aloof than she used to be. She was even rather cute.</p>

  <p>The two rays of light slowly moved in the Dark Region. Wherever they went, they enveloped anything under them, looking like sharp knives forcefully digging ditches into the ground.</p>

  <p>The plants in the Dark Region disappeared instantly under the light.</p>

  <p>The creatures of the Dark Region were shocked at the scene, so they hid themselves carefully and didn't dare breathe.</p>

  <p>They didn't dare bother Luo Zheng and Feng Ge. If they did, they would surely be killed once the light touched them.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng couldn't tell what kind of road they had chosen. After walking for over four hours, all he could see around him were uneven hills and mountains.</p>

  <p>When they came across the higher mountains, Feng Ge didn't bother climbing over them. Instead, she let the light pierce right through the mountains, creating a cave at their foot. Hence, their journey went smoothly.</p>

  <p>The area grew more desolate as the two moved forward. Finally, they reached a great mountain standing at the boundary between the Other Shore and the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>Perhaps because of having stayed in the Dark Region for long, Luo Zheng felt that the light from outside seemed all too dazzling, even under the cover of Feng Ge's light.</p>

  <p>"Eh? Is it... the Grand Sky Temple?" Standing atop the mountain, Luo Zheng saw something...</p>

  <p>It was the facade to the Grand Sky Temple!</p>

  <p>Having reached that point meant that they had traveled such a long way and ended up coming out from the other side of the Dark Region. Even after all the wrong turns they made, they finally found their way out.</p>

  <p>But right before leaving the Dark Region, Luo Zheng felt somewhat conflicted.</p>

  <p>Everything there was afraid of light as they were incompatible with it? they couldn't dream of existing in the light.</p>

  <p>Even the strong Green Jade would melt like ice and snow in summer if it had to stay in the light. But because the Green Jade was tougher and more solid than the rest, it melted relatively slowly? Feng Ge had left many traces in the Green Jade City.</p>

  <p>Although the Civilization Artifact could withstand the light Feng Ge had released, it would perish under the light outside the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>Stopping for a moment, Luo Zheng took out the Civilization Artifact and expressed his confusion to the Green Jade Spirit.</p>

  <p>In response, the Green Jade Spirit uttered a single word, "Candle."</p>

  <p>The creatures of the Dark Region were hoping to obtain candles. On the one hand, they still wanted the light, and on the other, the candle served as the bridge between the Dark Region and the outside world.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng wanted to fuse with the Civilization Artifact, his soul needed to enter the Dark Region with the lighted candle? fusing with the Other Shore Tokens of the Dark Region required a dark environment.</p>

  <p>"But... If I fuse with the Other Shore Token of the Dark Region and put it in my inner world, won't my inner world's light make it vanish without a trace?" Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>The Green Jade Spirit smiled faintly in response. "Light is a form of energy.</p>

  <p>Even the light of the Source World isn't at the high energy level or powerful enough to eliminate the Other Shore Token of the Dark Region, let alone your inner world's light."</p>

  <p>"So that's it..." Luo Zheng nodded, a realization coming to him.</p>

  <p>It was not the first time he had heard of the energy level. In the divine land, the energy he had released with the Truth Crystal had broken Nicholas' fatal strike, ending up in his defeat. The Truth Crystal's energy level was way too high.</p>

  <p>In front of the Grand Sky Temple's main gate, a large crowd of Souls of Light were gathered.</p>

  <p>The last time the Ear Mice explored the Grand Sky Temple, they had lost quite a lot. Now, they didn't even bother holding the auction.</p>

  <p>This time, the members of the Bearing race intended to open the Grand Sky Temple.</p>

  <p>During the last conflict between Luo Zheng and the Bearing race, the latter lost several elites. They also lost the qualifications to enter the Grand Sky Temple. In the end, it turned out they escaped the dangers along with the Jin Wu, the Divine Farmer race and the New Moon race.</p>

  <p>Now, it was time for them to stage a comeback.</p>

  <p>"Apart from the Souls of Light of the Bearing race, the Divine Farmer race, the New Moon race and the Jin Wu, everyone must leave, now!</p>

  <p>Hurry up!" one of the members of the Bearing race shouted. dozens of people laid the Soul Binding Threads on the ground nearby.</p>

  <p>The Soul Binding Threads covered the ground, looking like shiny blue grass.</p>

  <p>This time, there weren't many super forces taking part in the opening of the Grand Sky Temple. The Separate Abyss race suffered great losses along with other powerful forces last time. Even though the ferocious Grand Sky Temple was tempting, not just anyone could explore it.</p>

  <p>Most of those gathered at the main gate of the Grand Sky Temple were the Souls of Light from small races.</p>

  <p>On the hillside opposite the Grand Sky Temple sat Dorothy, looking at the gate.</p>

  <p>She had waited like this for a long time.</p>

  <p>There were moments she saw Luo Zheng emerging from the temple, but she knew she was only imagining it as the door remained closed.</p>

  <p>This time, the Bearing race managed to obtain the Other Shore Key of the Grand Sky Temple. If they opened the door, would Luo Zheng jump out from the temple?</p>
