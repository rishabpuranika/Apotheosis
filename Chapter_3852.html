  <p>
</p>

  <p>According to the Divine Farmer's plan, he must leave with the red crystal as quickly as possible. He must do this without any delay.</p>

  <p>He thought that if the captain of the Black Ship tried to stop him, he would immediately release a space snake.</p>

  <p>It was known that the space snakes were almost extinct within the Three Purities Stage. They naturally lived in the void. However, there were only three of them left now, one of which was in the possession of the Divine Farmer.</p>

  <p>The space snake was given to the Divine Farmer as a gift. He received it from the Element Spirit race.</p>

  <p>The space snake had a rare and useful ability. It could temporarily change the shape of the space channel. This was extremely helpful in times when the user wanted to make sure that no one else could enter the space channel.</p>

  <p>The Divine Farmer figured that he would be able to escape with Zheng as long as the captain of the Black Ship didn't break his space channel.</p>

  <p>However, a problem occurred before he could even drag Zheng into the space channel. The red crystal had already been contaminated by the Filthy Smoke. The expression on the Divine Farmer's face was indescribable. It looked frightening.</p>

  <p>His strength was comparable to that of the Yellow Thearch. However, he preferred not getting into fights. He rarely fought whenever he was in the Source World.</p>

  <p>"How dare you stop me?" Anger began to show in the Divine Farmer's eyes. He grabbed the red crystal with his left hand. Meanwhile, he held the Divine Farmer Ruler on his right. With that, he charged fearlessly towards Tomos.</p>

  <p>Even though it was now facing an Eternal Realm master, Tomos maintained its composure.</p>

  <p>As it saw the Divine Farmer approaching it at breakneck speed, Tomos immediately smoked its pipe.</p>

  <p>Bang! A loud noise echoed through the space.</p>

  <p>Before Tomos could blow the smoke out of its pipe, the Divine Farmer had already hacked at its head with the ruler.</p>

  <p>A direct attack from an Eternal Realm master was more than enough to kill a Holy Soul Realm warrior.</p>

  <p>As soon as the Divine Farmer slashed, he easily cracked and split Tomos' skull wide open. Its body appeared as though it had been seared by the scorching sun. In addition to that, it had no shape. There was only some sort of gray smoke under its skin.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>As the gray smoke started to dissipate, it quickly formed a cage and effectively trapped the Divine Farmer inside it.</p>

  <p>"You are truly extraordinary as an Eternal Realm master. I must admit that I have always admired you. However, I may have to offend you today."</p>

  <p>The members of the Black Ship were a little different from other forces. It was in the sense that all of them were desperadoes. The moment they decided to join the Black Ship, they had already abandoned everything else.</p>

  <p>They didn't care whether they lived or died.</p>

  <p>They didn't care about how powerful their opponents were. No matter what happened, they refused to give up without a fight.</p>

  <p>Just then, three Ear Mice that looked exactly like Tomos appeared inside the cage. It was apparent that they were made out of the smoke.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid it would be very unwise of you to provoke me!"</p>

  <p>The Divine Farmer slowly raised the green ruler in his hand. As he did this, he lightly stepped into the air.</p>

  <p>A string of bright and colorful lights began to encircle him. A profound space law flitted upon his body as though it was dancing.</p>

  <p>He brandished his ruler then slashed at the Ear Mice. With graceful ease, he had split the three smoke incarnations apart.</p>

  <p>However, three more smoke incarnations instantly appeared not far away from him.</p>

  <p>He took a slight step forward and seemed like he was about to charge towards them. But all of a sudden, he turned around and stabbed.</p>

  <p>Puff! It sounded like something popped.</p>

  <p>The Divine Farmer Ruler had pierced into the void. Then, blood started to fill the space where the Divine Farmer had stabbed.</p>

  <p>At once, Tomos materialized and its body began to rapidly dissipate. It immediately turned into traces of green that gathered around the Divine Farmer Ruler.</p>

  <p>"Do you think this pathetic little trick can deceive me?" the Divine Farmer asked with a cold and hard expression on his face.</p>

  <p>Tomos' face didn't quite express any pain. In fact, it even revealed a sly smile. "Perhaps..."</p>

  <p>As soon as it said this, its body quickly rotted and turned into a horrible-looking corpse. It seemed like this was still not its real body.</p>

  <p>While watching this scene unfold before him, the Divine Farmer noticed a white and weightless bandage had materialized on the red crystal in his hand. The moment the bandage touched the red crystal, it had spread out and covered the red crystal in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>The bandage had tightly wrapped itself around the red crystal. Suddenly, there was an awfully strong pulling force coming from the bandage.</p>

  <p>Without any warning, it dragged the red crystal towards the sky.</p>

  <p>The Divine Farmer was caught off guard by this abrupt move and the red crystal slipped out of his grasp.</p>

  <p>However, he reacted very quickly. When he saw the red crystal being pulled away by the bandage, he instantly went after it and swiftly grabbed it in his hand.</p>

  <p>But then, the Divine Farmer felt a powerful force pulling at the other end of the bandage. It was so strong that it also dragged him away. This force was utterly formidable.</p>

  <p>"Well then, we will see who is stronger!"</p>

  <p>As he said this, the Divine Farmer's face darkened. The power within his body suddenly erupted.</p>

  <p>It was well-known that there was a huge gap between the Eternal Realm and the Holy Soul Realm warriors. They had huge differences in terms of physical strength, real strength, speed, and soul.</p>

  <p>The moment the Divine Farmer's power had erupted, the bandage could no longer be pulled away from him. It couldn't budge for even a millimeter.</p>

  <p>"Break!"</p>

  <p>With a wave of the long ruler in his hand, he instantly severed the bandage off.</p>

  <p>However, he frowned as he grasped the red crystal with his other hand. It didn't feel as heavy as it used to be. He felt a bad sense of foreboding.</p>

  <p>He tore off the bandage in a hurry, only to find a big black stone inside it!</p>

  <p>"This can't be..."</p>

  <p>The red crystal that contained Zheng inside had actually been replaced!</p>

  <p>"My apologies."</p>

  <p>Once again, Tomos appeared a short distance from the Divine Farmer. It bowed to him then turned into gray smoke and instantly dissipated.</p>

  <p>The warriors at the Eternal Realm considered those at the Holy Soul Realm as weak beings.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, the number of warriors at the Holy Soul Realm in the Divine Farmer race was ten times bigger than that of the Black Ship.</p>

  <p>The Divine Farmer thought that it didn't matter even if they had Other Shore Tokens from the Three Purities Stage. Their number was too small. It was not enough to fight against him because the gap in strength was just too huge.</p>

  <p>But obviously, the members of the Black Ship were far stronger than the ordinary warriors at the Holy Soul Realm. With their cunning tricks and teamwork, they had actually managed to take away Zheng from the Divine Farmer's hands!</p>

  <p>The Divine Farmer felt he was fooled. He had walked right into their trap.</p>

  <p>This was extremely humiliating! He couldn't accept that he had fallen for their cheap tricks.</p>

  <p>"How dare you play tricks on me? You will pay for this!"</p>

  <p>The cultivated Divine Farmer finally showed a terrifyingly ferocious expression on his face.</p>

  <p>A thin crack appeared on his forehead. It began to open slowly and revealed an eyeball. A triangular frame appeared on the surface of the eyeball.</p>

  <p>Afterwards, there was a sudden flash of brilliant light.</p>

  <p>After being punched by Fuxi, Usman had remained lying on the ground and gasping for breath. At this very moment, a triangular frame suddenly appeared in his eyes. At once, his body seemed like it was being controlled by his eyes. His eyeballs bulged and lifted his upper body with force. At the same time, his head spun in a strange angle.</p>

  <p>Cracking sounds could be heard as his head spun around. Obviously, his neck was broken.</p>

  <p>However, he didn't feel any pain. He closed his eyes and fell to the ground once more. He quickly had regained his consciousness.</p>

  <p>When he woke up, he had no idea what had happened. But the severe pain from his neck made him wince and curse.</p>

  <p>He looked around him and a strange and different sight was transmitted to the Divine Farmer's mind.</p>

  <p>At that moment, he appeared as though he was looking down at the whole Separate Amber Province. He was able to see everything within the province very clearly. He continued to scan through the horizon. Soon enough, he noticed something a hundred miles away from him.</p>

  <p>He saw a space ship floating alone in the void. The members of the Black Ship were either sitting or leaning inside it. The red crystal that contained Zheng was dragged by a bandage into the space ship.</p>

  <p>All these times, the Divine Farmer thought that his opponent must be the captain of the Black Ship.</p>

  <p>He wouldn't be so angry if it was the captain of the Black Ship that was able to take Zheng away. But now that he knew it was merely a group of warriors at the Holy Soul Realm who managed to easily abduct Zheng, he was utterly infuriated.</p>

  <p>"You will pay for this with your lives!"</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, the Divine Farmer's figure became huge. With this, the Divine Farmer Ruler also grew in length and size.</p>

  <p>He took a mere step forward and was able to cross a hundred miles. The Divine Farmer Ruler in his hand slashed towards the void.</p>

  <p>With the slash, the void collapsed. The space ship couldn't remain intact.</p>
