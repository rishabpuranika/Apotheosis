<br/><br/>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng let go of his sword without any hesitation.</p>

  <p>The Great Weighty Sword flew off from his hand, whirling in the air, and piercing through the wall. From there, it continued its trajectory before smashing heavily into the open space outside.</p>

  <p>Two low-rank True Gods outside the hall could only stare in shock as the large sword stuck itself into the ground.</p>

  <p>They knew there were some important people inside the hall but they didn't know that there was also a fight so they were quite surprised by the sudden appearance of the Great Weighty Sword.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Luo Zheng, having let go of his sword, contracted his body and rolled to the side.</p>

  <p>His opponent was such a top strongman that he couldn't capture his figure at all. Both his eyesight and spiritual sense were unusable to him.</p>

  <p>His decisions from henceforth were all based on mere instinct.</p>

  <p>As he rolled to the side, a faint figure flashed through where he had been.</p>

  <p>That figure launched three crimson claw prints.</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish! Swish!</p>

  <p>The three claw prints did not catch Luo Luo Zheng but were strangely in the air for quite a long time.</p>

  <p>Langston stood with a trace of surprise in his eyes. Behind his back was his hand that flashed a faint, cold light. Luo Luo Zheng couldn't have dodged his blow but it seemed that Luo Luo Zheng had a god's support and managed to avoid him.</p>

  <p>"Interesting," Langston exclaimed before a cold smile broke through his face. "Let's see you avoid me this time."</p>

  <p>He then took a step forward and his figure immediately became a blur.</p>

  <p>He couldn't fly as a mid-rank True God but his extreme speed made up for it.</p>

  <p>Luck had helped Luo Luo Zheng avoid Langston's grasp just now but how long would it last? Just as Luo Luo Zheng watched Langston disappear, he gritted his teeth and rolled away again.</p>

  <p>However, Langston was prepared this time. Before he jumped, he already predicted the direction Luo Luo Zheng would try to escape to and thus was able to make his way there and wait for him. He still stood with one hand behind him, as if it was a great insult for him to fight against a proving godly warrior with both his hands.</p>

  <p>He was about to grab Luo Luo Zheng but his expression suddenly changed.</p>

  <p>Langston suddenly raised his entire body and turned his head backward, as if he had been pulled out of the desert. Only then did he stand firmly on the ground as a rough wound appeared on his forehead.</p>

  <p>Despite their difference in level, Luo Luo Zheng would never sit still and wait for death.</p>

  <p>Holy Beings disdained the use of Cross-world token as a tool to activate the strength source but, right now, it was the only means Luo Luo Zheng could use to resist his opponent.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had managed to figure out Langston's plan so after rolling over, he extracted eighty percent of his strength source and turned it into a powerful spear.</p>

  <p>Langston's mistake was that he didn't take Luo Luo Zheng seriously. The young man was only a proving godly warrior after all and his pride did not allow him to waste that much power on him. Thus, Langston's attack methods remained the same: jumping up high and then rushing down from the sky like a hawk. As he rushed down, a long spear flew out and hit him on the forehead.</p>

  <p>At the moment of impact, Luo Luo Zheng abruptly pushed the spear up. Fortunately for Langston, he was faster and managed to dodge the attack. The spear merely grazed his skin as he stepped back.</p>

  <p>The fact remained though that a proving godly warrior like Luo Luo Zheng managed to land a hit on Langston and injure him.</p>

  <p>"Langston Leng... is hurt?!"</p>

  <p>"A supreme mid-rank True God was hurt by a proving godly warrior?"</p>

  <p>"It's... How could it be possible?"</p>

  <p>The people still hadn't recovered their shock from Sheridan's death and Langston's injury was a tad bit overwhelming for them.</p>

  <p>Was it all truly just luck? They deemed Luo Luo Zheng to be lucky enough to have killed Sheridan but it seemed the young man's strength was also quite formidable.</p>

  <p>However, Sheridan was only a low-rank True God. Despite the rarity of such an event, it wasn't impossible for a proving godly warrior to defeat a low-rank True God.</p>

  <p>Back when the Holy Emperor of the Leng Clan was only a proving godly warrior, he managed to defeat twelve low-rank True Gods.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng proved that he was extremely talented and powerful by killing Sheridan.</p>

  <p>But Langston was a different story. The people just knew that once that guy fought Luo Luo Zheng, the latter would be doomed.</p>

  <p>Langston wasn't just one of the mid-rank True Gods, he was also one of the strongest.</p>

  <p>However, the scene in front of them was a contradiction of everything they had ever known. Langston was injured and, from the looks of it, his head would've been pierced if he was a second too slow.</p>

  <p>The noble son of the Leng Clan stared up at his opponent firmly. The calm in his face had completely disappeared and there were two cyclones that raged in his eyes. What was most telling of his rage was that his other hand was now held down.</p>

  <p>It was extremely shameful for Langston to have been injured by a mere proving godly warrior.</p>

  <p>He never expected this at all.</p>

  <p>"It seems that I must make your death a bit more painful," Langston muttered just as his figure disappeared.</p>

  <p>Rip!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng didn't have any time to react as he felt a sudden, stabbing pain from the side of his body. He looked down and saw three distinct claw prints on his waist.</p>

  <p>Langston wanted to cut Luo Luo Zheng in half, however, he found the young man's seemingly ordinary robe impenetrable.</p>

  <p>The audience was baffled!</p>

  <p>"Lang, you're choosing to be merciful to him again?"</p>

  <p>"He even didn't tear that guy's clothes."</p>

  <p>"He's obviously angry though. Is there something wrong with that guy's clothes?"</p>

  <p>It was all thanks to the Redemption Armor that Luo Zheng's body was still whole, however, Langston's claw prints still managed to penetrate a portion of power onto Luo Zheng's body. As the power was released, Luo Luo Zheng felt it rampage inside him.</p>

  <p>"Humph!" Langston huffed, surprised at Luo Zheng's protective clothing but nonetheless determined to attack the young man again.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>He rushed over towards Luo Luo Zheng and waved his hand casually. Claw prints once again appeared in the air and strangely did not dissipate. The moment Langston approached Luo Luo Zheng, the claw prints he had left in the air stretched out and rushed towards Luo Luo Zheng as a streak of light.</p>

  <p>Scratching! Scratching! Scratching!</p>

  <p>This time, ten claw prints came and scratched Luo Zheng's body continuously.</p>

  <p>These claw prints penetrated through Luo Zheng's Redemption Armor while the forces inside his body continued to rampage and destroy his internal organs.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng spat out blood but continued to roll to the other side. As he rolled, he left behind a streak of golden blood on the ground. The strength hidden in Langston's strange claw prints was too special and his body couldn't bear its power.</p>

  <p>Seeing his opponent down, Langston now walked freely and had a contemptuous look on his face. He was just careless before and was accidentally hit by Luo Zheng's spear earlier. The graze didn't mean that the young man was more powerful than him. Just as he was about to end Luo Zheng's life, a graceful figure suddenly floated over and shielded Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>It was Han Liusu. "Let him go," she ordered Langston in a cold voice.</p>

  <p>"He killed Sheridan, so he must die. You know this. Even if I let him go, he will still die," Langston reasoned. He stared at Han Liusu with a sneer.</p>

  <p>Even if he didn't have deep feelings for her, she was still his fiancee so he still had to listen to whatever she said.</p>

  <p>"Be that as it may, you do not have the authority to execute him," she said.</p>

  <p>Langston tilted his head and smiled coldly. "What if I insist on killing him?"</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>A little blue flame rose between Liusu's browns and swiftly ignited her hair. At the same time, blue flames burst forth and spiraled around her arm. She was entirely enveloped in blue flame as she stood against Langston determinedly. "If you want to kill him, you'll have to go through me first!"</p>
