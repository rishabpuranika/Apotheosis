<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Evil God's eyes lit up with excitement as the spear struck Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Without any resistance, the spear formed from the Annihilation Coke pierced through Luo Zheng's head and slid cleanly into his body.</p>

  <p>Even as he killed Luo Zheng, the Evil God released the Creation Coke. It formed a star-shaped cage around Luo Zheng's corpse.</p>

  <p>Of course, he had no interest in Luo Zheng's corpse. He wanted to trap Clarence inside it.</p>

  <p>A spot on Luo Zheng's body began to glow from within.</p>

  <p>There was a slight crackling sound as a bright sphere emerged from Luo Zheng's corpse.</p>

  <p>The glowing sphere flew up, colliding with the star-shaped cage. The sphere bounced back. It bumped into the cage again, as though trying to escape, but the cage created by the Creation Coke was virtually indestructible. No matter how hard he tried, Clarence couldn't break free.</p>

  <p>The Evil God slowly descended to the side of the cage. There was a look of great satisfaction on his face as he gazed at the mysterious sphere.</p>

  <p>"Although the energy of the twelfth-grade world consists only of the Creation Coke and the Annihilation Coke, they can change constantly.</p>

  <p>This cage is the result of a theurgy designed by my two billion brothers, and it's more than strong enough to trap you," said the Evil God.</p>

  <p>The sound of Clarence's voice came from the glowing sphere. "You have just mastered the energy of the Creation Coke, but you have already comprehended it and invented ways to maximize and improve it. This star-shaped cage fully displays the advantages of the Creation Coke. It's incredible!"</p>

  <p>The Evil God smiled. With evident pride, he said, "My talent is beyond your imagination. You won't regret being devoured by me. Contribute everything you have!"</p>

  <p>The tone of amazement vanished from Clarence's voice, replaced by indignation. "Never!"</p>

  <p>Once more, the sphere began to try to escape, colliding over and over again with the star-shaped cage.</p>

  <p>But Clarence's efforts were useless. The star-shaped cage did not budge even an inch.</p>

  <p>"It's useless," said the Evil God calmly.</p>

  <p>He lifted his hand, and the star-shaped cage began to shrink. The space left for Clarence became smaller and smaller. Finally, he was tightly enclosed by the cage, with no room to move.</p>

  <p>"I heard that you are the one who created the downgrader, and also the ruler of the highest level. It's too stupid for you to go into such a situation with such a strong power. It's a waste for you to keep such power," the Evil God said, stretching out his hand.</p>

  <p>His fingers elongated until they resembled slender threads. Although his fingers were no thicker than noodles, they were powerful. They slid into the cage and began drilling into the sphere.</p>

  <p>"You will regret this!</p>

  <p>No one can devour me!</p>

  <p>You are digging your own grave!"</p>

  <p>Clarence roared, sounding furious and aggrieved.</p>

  <p>The Evil God laughed. "Both you and the downgrader are so arrogant.</p>

  <p>Worse, you are weak!"</p>

  <p>With that, the Evil God closed his eyes and began absorbing the sphere through his fingers.</p>

  <p>The sphere dimmed and shrank at an astonishing speed.</p>

  <p>Clarence's voice became weaker, and then there was silence as he stopped speaking completely.</p>

  <p>After absorbing Clarence, the Evil God slowly opened his eyes. On his face was a look of wild, undisguised joy. He moved and arrived almost instantly at the center of the chaos, where he stood on a high spot, surveying the darkness of the black light beneath him.</p>

  <p>Because the world was being downgraded, there was an extremely strong traction force above and below the Wall World. However, it had no pull upon the Evil God.</p>

  <p>"You have failed twenty-six times. Do you want to fail the twenty-seventh time?" the downgrader asked sullenly.</p>

  <p>He had already broken free from the Cold Phase imposed by the Evil God, but he knew that he was no match for him. So he simply hid within the black light and waited for the world to be completely downgraded.</p>

  <p>"We won't know until I give it a try," the Evil God said casually.</p>

  <p>"Once the world is downgraded, there is no possibility of reversal," the downgrader sneered. He emitted a bark of sharp laughter, enveloped in the black light.</p>

  <p>The Evil God was in a good mood, so he ignored the mocking tone of the downgrader. He said, "I don't need to reverse the downgrading. All I need to do is stop it!"</p>

  <p>There was a rush of air as the Evil God suddenly raised his hand.</p>

  <p>Immediately, the whole world began turning into ice and snow.</p>

  <p>A massive wave of huge ice crystals swarmed into the atmosphere.</p>

  <p>At first, the Wall World devoured these ice crystals easily. However, the barrage of ice crystals kept coming, until the world could no longer resist.</p>

  <p>Slowly, everything stopped, and the world froze over.</p>

  <p>"How is this possible?" the downgrader exclaimed, unable to hide his shock.</p>

  <p>He shook his head in denial. "It's impossible!"</p>

  <p>With that, deep within the black light, the downgrader burst out the Flame Extreme Form.</p>

  <p>He tried to use the energy to melt the frozen Wall World. But even as he made his move, he felt a blast of cold air pouring into the black light. The Evil God was suppressing him again.</p>

  <p>"It's over," said the Evil God.</p>

  <p>He stared down at the black light and saw that the Wall World was no longer expanding. Instead of satisfaction, for some reason he felt a stirring of uneasiness.</p>

  <p>Everything was going so smoothly that it seemed too good to be true.</p>

  <p>He moved again, and arrived in a flash above the fairy palace. Most of the black ship was already destroyed, since Luo Zheng had earlier pulled it over and crashed it into the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>But the black ship was not so easy to destroy. After the ship was repaired by the former captain, it floated in the air again.</p>

  <p>Neither the fairy palace nor the black ship made a move. They only maintained a certain distance between them, each seeing the vigilance of the other.</p>

  <p>Without warning, the Evil God appeared on the deck of the black ship.</p>

  <p>Edna, Shera, the Grandmaster of Heaven, and Duran let out sighs of relief.</p>

  <p>Those in the fairy palace had the opposite reaction. The faces of the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and their companions darkened.</p>

  <p>"What has happened to Luo Zheng?" the Snake Goddess shouted.</p>

  <p>"You know the answer to that. Only one of us could live in the end," said the Evil God, laughing softly. He clasped his hands behind his back.</p>

  <p>At those words, many of those in the fairy palace bowed their heads with grief. Some wanted to rush to the black ship and attack, but even the slightest glance from the Evil God was enough to incapacitate them.</p>

  <p>When he stared at them, they collapsed to the ground, unable to move.</p>

  <p>Right now, the Evil God was the absolute ruler of the fairy palace. Not even the downgrader could resist him, let alone the humans in the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>The Evil God's smile disappeared, and he gazed grimly at those in the fairy palace. "Go to hell!" he cried, raising his hand, prepared to crush everyone.</p>

  <p>But Edna stepped forward, stopping him. "Dear, this world has become far too desolate. Please don't kill anyone else."</p>

  <p>There was nothing now in the whole chaos, only an endless void. Edna didn't like this kind of world very much.</p>

  <p>The Evil God paused, then turned to give her a faint smile. "Since you intercede, I'll leave them alive. As you said, this world is indeed too desolate. Let me see what I can do..."</p>

  <p>He stretched out his hands and moved them through the air, as though he was drawing something.</p>

  <p>The sky above them lightened to a soothing azure.</p>

  <p>The earth extended around them. Mountains, rivers, canyons and basins appeared one after another.</p>

  <p>Tall walls, pavilions, and streets were created instantly, sprinkled across the landscape.</p>

  <p>"Now, people!" declared the Evil God.</p>

  <p>He waved his hands in the air again.</p>

  <p>Instantly, the empty world changed. It was now entirely populated, filled with people who moved and looked around them with wide eyes.</p>

  <p>"Come with me!" said the Evil God, taking Edna by the hand. He pulled her into his embrace, and together, the two of them soared into the air above the city.</p>

  <p>When the people below saw the two beings floating above them, they all dropped to the ground, prostrating themselves before these seeming gods.</p>

  <p>The Evil God had seen this scene before, when he was very young. The people had worshipped Luo Zheng as their creator.</p>

  <p>He felt a surge of pleasure as he realized that with Luo Zheng dead, he now held that position.</p>

  <p>"Where is our home?" Edna asked, safely enclosed in the arms of the Evil God.</p>

  <p>"There," the Evil God replied, looking ahead.</p>

  <p>A broad, elegant courtyard was sprawled on top of a majestic snowy mountain.</p>

  <p>The Evil God led Edna into the courtyard, and they landed gently on the ground. A peaceful mood had come over the Evil God now that his victory was complete. He felt utterly relaxed, content to stay here without moving.</p>

  <p>"You deserve some rest. Go to sleep," said Edna gently, touching his face.</p>

  <p>Her soft voice was hypnotic, and soon, the Evil God found himself lying on a bed. He settled down and let his eyes close.</p>

  <p>However, almost as soon as he closed his eyes, they snapped back open.</p>

  <p>His face was full of anger. A sudden chill ran down his head to the base of his back, leaving a trail of iciness all along his spine.</p>
