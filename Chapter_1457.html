<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1457 Human Pyramid (Part Two) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>However, this time, just as the two diamond-shaped ice crystals appeared, two crisp sounds also rang out. A green light and a purple light shot towards the diamond-shaped ice crystals at the same time. The accuracy was unmistakable.</p>

  <p>"Clank! Clank!"</p>

  <p>Following the two crisp sounds, the two diamond-shaped ice crystals instantly exploded and shattered outward into streaks of cold air before disappearing from everyone's sight.</p>

  <p>The archers were now two women of the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>Although the many warriors were competitors in this abyss, everyone could only go further by working together. When faced with the threat of the diamond-shaped ice crystals, enemies had to become friends, and fight for a common goal - survival.</p>

  <p>As they were continuing to fall, all the warriors had now understood this principle. Facing those diamond-shaped ice crystals, they didn't hold back their strength anymore. Every one of the warriors was now accepting the responsibility for destroying the dangerous diamond-shaped ice crystals.</p>

  <p>Whenever the diamond-shaped ice crystals flew over, someone would always take the initiative to smash them into pieces. The ones who contributed the most were not humans, but those from the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>Although the warriors of the Demon Night were good at different kinds of weapons, the most common weapon they used was a bow and arrows.</p>

  <p>Almost everyone of their warriors was equipped with a longbow. Hence, they had a reputation for proficiency in shooting which was unmatched among their human and ogre counterparts.</p>

  <p>At the beginning, there was only one or two diamond-shaped ice crystals, but soon, the number of these dangerous hazards began to increase exponentially. Surviving the gauntlet of the rising diamond-shaped ice crystals was becoming even more dangerous now.</p>

  <p>Three, four? six, seven...</p>

  <p>At the same time, more and more diamond-shaped ice crystals appeared and the pressure became greater and greater. More people began to work together. The sounds of explosions echoed throughout the abyss for a time as the diamond-shaped ice crystals were exploded through archery and teamwork.</p>

  <p>This situation continued for almost an hour, and the expressions of the warriors became more and more serious. At the same time, the number of diamond-shaped ice crystals that shot up had already reached twenty, and if there was even the slightest mistake, someone would be killed. If the number of diamond-shaped ice crystals reached a certain point, the result wouldn't be hard to guess. Everyone in the abyss would be faced with an inevitably disastrous consequence.</p>

  <p>"Buzzzzz?"</p>

  <p>Some warriors had already foreseen this. They shattered the purple specks of light and activated the divine texture, choosing to withdraw and return to the entrance of the underground palace.</p>

  <p>It would be too late to withdraw by the time that the warriors found it was beyond their ability to handle. The opportunities and treasures in the abyss were indeed attractive, but their lives were still the most important aspect of consideration.</p>

  <p>The fewer people there were, the greater the pressure would be. After all, there were still so many diamond-shaped ice crystals to deal with; and with fewer archers to take out the diamond-shaped ice crystals, the task was becoming impossible.</p>

  <p>When the first person chose to retreat, the other warriors' minds immediately wavered. Very soon, the second and third warriors also activated their divine textures, transforming into a beam of purple light as they shot upwards. The tide of abandonment increased as more warriors chose to leave the fight.</p>

  <p>However, many warriors still chose to stay.</p>

  <p>Some chose to fight with all their might, while others chose to protect themselves. There was no right or wrong decision to be made. This was about survival.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng understood, however, that he could not give up. The competition in the Upper World was certainly more brutal than that in the Lower World and the path he chose to walk on was far more difficult than that of an ordinary warrior. If he gave up on this small challenge, how could he continue on his tough path. Besides, he was doing it not only for himself but also for Xun. There would be too much to be lost, if he abandoned the task now.</p>

  <p>"Freya, adjust your position and try to maintain a straight line with me,"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng instructed.</p>

  <p>Freya nodded. She, of course, clearly understood Luo Zheng's arrangement.</p>

  <p>Now everyone was falling. She then adjusted her position and kept herself above Luo Zheng's head. It was as if Luo Luo Zheng was standing in front of her, shielding her from harm.</p>

  <p>When the other warriors saw Luo Zheng's arrangement, they saw the wisdom of this move and their minds changed as they followed suit. Therefore, a rather comical scene appeared. Almost all of the warriors began to adjust their positions and moved towards Freya's position. They were all trying to shelter themselves behind Luo Luo Zheng now.</p>

  <p>Not only the human warriors, but also the ones of the Demon Night and the ogres, were also coming, one after the other. They formed a straight line, as if they were a living pyramid, during the rapid descent.</p>

  <p>Looking at the neatly arranged pyramid above his head, a helpless smile appeared on Luo Zheng's face. He couldn't blame these guys for taking advantage of the situation. Arranged like this, they would indeed avoid a lot of trouble. There was safety to be secured in this pattern. All Luo Luo Zheng needed to do was to break the diamond-shaped ice crystals that had shot up from the bottom.</p>

  <p>Therefore, with Luo Luo Zheng as the leader and apex, this pyramid formed by humans, ogres and Demon Night members continued plummeting downwards at top speed.</p>

  <p>After about an hour, the number of diamond-shaped ice crystals began to decrease. Although the surrounding cold energy was still high and copious, the temperature had also increased by quite a bit. Things were definitely looking up for them.</p>

  <p>It seemed that they had passed through this round of trial. However, just as everyone's mood was slightly released and tensions faded, a soft laughter suddenly rang out.</p>
