<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3797 The Violet Cloud Race </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>After all these races in Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore had shown up, Luo Zheng realized there were a lot more here than he had originally thought.</p>

  <p>After all, the ruling civilizations usually built their own temples in Stage Thirty-two in the past.</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade Civilization had once developed and grown in Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore, but they were unable to cope with the relentless chase and pestering of the Nihility race. They were left no choice but to enter a lower space and hide in the Dark Region of Stage Thirteen of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>The humans had been in a similar situation. The human beings, led by the Primeval Lord of Heaven, were unable to contend with the Element Spirit race and were forced to flee into Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore. As for the other humans, they hid in the Creation Myth Temple of Stage Seventeen of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...</p>

  <p>In the distance, black cubes glided along the bronze ground like flying carpets.</p>

  <p>From the black cubes jumped many creatures as slender as bamboo sticks.</p>

  <p>They were tall and strong, with skin of cyan-purple. Their faces were long, like that of horse, and they looked very arrogant. They lined up in a row and three more warriors stepped down from the black cubes.</p>

  <p>Their aura was extraordinary as they were all Eternal Realm masters.</p>

  <p>"What race are they? They actually have three warriors at the Eternal Realm..." Luo Zheng asked curiously and astounded.</p>

  <p>"That's the Violet Cloud race. They used to be one of the top five ruling civilizations," Pearce said in a low voice. "But now they have pledged allegiance to the Element Spirit race."</p>

  <p>"Even one of the top five ruling civilizations has pledged loyalty to the Element Spirit race..." Luo Zheng said disgustedly, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>He had learned from the Primeval Lord of Heaven that in Stage Thirty-two, all the races, except for the Three Eyes race and few others that followed the Finale Way and remained neutral, had joined the Element Spirit race or the Nihility race. Even with this knowledge, he couldn't help but sigh in disappointment when he saw it with his own eyes.</p>

  <p>"The entire Violet Cloud race is pitiful and ungrateful. They have joined the Element Spirit race but they aren't in an important position. It's been so many years and they still haven't progressed their strength and development," said the Primeval Lord of Heaven, his voice rife with contempt.</p>

  <p>"Does the Violet Cloud race hold a grudge against the human race?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"After our human race entered Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore, under the leadership of our human ancestor, we were able to stand up to the Element Spirit race. Many Other Shore races and civilizations then joined us. The Violet Cloud race is the 62nd civilization, even older than us, and was once the most solid ally of our human race," the Primeval Lord of Heaven mused, lost in thought of the past.</p>

  <p>Back then the Grand Plain Stage was not as lifeless as it was now. Many ruling civilizations sprung up there and developed into powerful and prosperous races.</p>

  <p>The human race continued upholding the Finale Way. Even if the 77th chaos had failed, the human race and the other civilizations on the Other Shore still continued firmly supporting the Finale Way...</p>

  <p>At the human race's peak in the Grand Plain Stage, there was even a hint of a possibility they might be able to defeat the Element Spirit race. It was at this most critical moment that they were betrayed by several ruling civilizations, including the Violet Cloud race.</p>

  <p>After the human race failed, the Finale Way was gradually neglected by others.</p>

  <p>Now, any forces that once supported the Finale Way had either disappeared or chosen to side with the Element Spirit race or the Nihility race. Either that or they had chosen an existence like that of the Three Eyes race, which remained neutral, and achieved nothing.</p>

  <p>"The Violet Cloud race once had such a relationship with our race..." Luo Zheng muttered.</p>

  <p>Too much had happened during a thousand chaotic eras.</p>

  <p>Just then, the Violet Cloud race suddenly began making moves on both sides, enveloping an area of Three Purities Stones. As they did so, one of their Eternal Realm warriors yelled, "All souls and physical bodies sitting on the Three Purities Stones in this area, should be removed!"</p>

  <p>Several warriors had already hung their souls and physical bodies on the Three Purities Stones before the Violet Cloud race had gotten there, including Luo Zheng, Li Bianxue, and three members of the Three Eyes race.</p>

  <p>When the Eternal Realm warrior suddenly roared for them to remove their souls and physical bodies, everyone was confused.</p>

  <p>The leader of the Three Eyes race glared at the Eternal Realm warrior in displeasure and said, "You only need one of the Three Purities Stones to enter the Eternal Scroll Painting, and it doesn't matter which is used. Why do you ask us to remove the souls and physical bodies?"</p>

  <p>The Eternal Realm warrior of the Violet Cloud race put his hands behind his back and with a sinister smile, said, "It doesn't matter which Three Purities Stone is used to enter the Eternal Scroll Painting, but the Eternal Realm warriors of our race have all chosen this area to keep our souls and bodies.</p>

  <p>No one else is allowed here!"</p>

  <p>The sculptures around the Three Purities Stones on the ground did indeed have slender and long figures. There was no doubt they belonged to the Violet Cloud race.</p>

  <p>Even so, their behaviors were petty and unreasonable.</p>

  <p>It did not matter whether they were the Element Spirit race or the Nihility race or anyone else, they had to choose a Three Purities Stone at random.</p>

  <p>But the Violet Cloud warriors were domineering and even though the others had already hung their souls and bodies on the stones, they still asked them to remove them.</p>

  <p>"What if we don't remove them?" The leader of Three Eyes race asked with anger flaring in his eyes.</p>

  <p id="top_28">The three-eyed boy named Egan and the other members of the Three Eyes race were all furious.</p>

  <p>Another Eternal Realm warrior of the Violet Cloud race chuckled, "I seem to recall that the Three Eyes race doesn't do well with torture. If you do not want to remove them, you may try your luck and see what happens to you!"</p>

  <p>The Three Eyes race could protect themselves within the Grand Plain Stage.</p>

  <p>But if the Violet Cloud race attacked them with all their might, they would have a tough time dealing with it.</p>

  <p>This threat left most the members of the Three Eyes race feeling indignant, while Egan seemed understanding and even suggested, "Grandpa, we'd better remove our souls and bodies. We'd lose nothing by switching Three Purities Stones."</p>

  <p>Under Egan's persuasion, their leader could only agree. Egan and the other two members of the Three Eyes race returned to the inner space of the second volume and took back the bodies hanging there.</p>

  <p>The Three Eyes race had chosen submission and the other small races couldn't afford to offend the Violet Cloud race as well, and so obediently followed suit. Only Luo Zheng and Li Bianxue were left. One of them had placed the soul on the stone, and the other had put the body there.</p>

  <p>The Eternal Realm warrior of the Violet Cloud race glanced at the two Three Purities Stones and saw this. He turned around, stared at Pearce and ordered ferociously, "Why are the humans here? Remove them now!"</p>

  <p>Both Pearce and Auden were unsure how to deal with this. They didn't want to offend these Other Shore races when Eastern Emperor Taiyi was not here.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng on the other hand took the opportunity to stand up. "What if I don't remove it?"</p>

  <p>The people of the Violet Cloud race had never imagined the weak human race would refuse, especially in this round of chaos where the humans couldn't even enter the Other Shore with their physical bodies. All they could do was to put their souls into the stones. They were quite simply just unimportant characters.</p>

  <p>That was why when Luo Zheng spoke, it drew the eyes of all the Violet Cloud warriors. Several Eternal Realm warriors looked at Luo Zheng strangely when they noticed his physical body.</p>
