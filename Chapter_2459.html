  <p>
</p>

  <p>After launching that sword attack, Luo Zheng gasped for breath.</p>

  <p>The Ways-blending Energy was very thick, and forcing it out with the Emotion Closing Divine Dao had taken a huge toll on all his meridians.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the Godly Tile in his body dimmed down.</p>

  <p>Every time Luo Zheng had used the Ways-blending Strike in the Immortal Mansion, he had needed to rest for a period of time.</p>

  <p>Moreover, he had always restricted himself, never daring to release the full energy of the Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>But when Luo Zheng had seen the consummate True God take his sister away, he had been ready to risk everything.</p>

  <p>He had swung his sword without hesitation, pushing himself to the limit.</p>

  <p>Now, even the smallest movement made him feel like his meridians were on fire. The pain came in waves; every time he thought that the worst was over, he felt another jolt of unbearable pain.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, his attack had been enough to startle the consummate True God, who quickly retreated.</p>

  <p>Despite the pain he was in, Luo Zheng gritted his teeth and rushed to Yan.</p>

  <p>Every inch of the consummate True God's body was covered by thunder; a single touch would turn a person into ashes.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't know whether Yan had gotten injured while being held by the consummate True God, so he was very worried about her.</p>

  <p>When he finally reached her, he felt a little relieved after seeing the Sky and Thunder Breaking Necklace hanging on Yan's chest. Electric current crackled on the surface of the necklace, but it didn't touch Yan at all.</p>

  <p>He had forgotten that this necklace Yan wore could resist all kinds of thunder attacks.</p>

  <p>However, he was still a little worried. He put his hand on Yan's forehead and released a wisp of spiritual sense so that he could check Yan's soul, which could have been damaged by thunder despite the necklace she was wearing.</p>

  <p>But just as his spiritual sense was about to invade Yan's brain, a powerful force burst out from Yan's brain and blocked his spiritual sense.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>A puzzled expression appeared on Luo Zheng's face, but then he smiled.</p>

  <p>It seemed that Harold had prepared Yan well for the debate. He had not only given Yan a necklace that protected her from thunder attacks, but he had also given her a treasure to protect her soul.</p>

  <p>After a while, Yan opened her eyes. When she saw Luo Zheng, a trace of apology appeared on her face. "Luo Zheng, I was careless just now..."</p>

  <p>"Your opponent was a consummate True God. It was not your fault," Luo Zheng said as he stared into her eyes.</p>

  <p>"If I'd been careful, even a consummate True God wouldn't have been able to do anything to me," Yan said, pouting her lips.</p>

  <p>The consummate True God had turned himself into thunder all of a sudden and shot toward her, giving her no time to react. As a result, she had fainted.</p>

  <p>At this moment...</p>

  <p>Rumble...</p>

  <p>The Multiple Antennae Snake in the distance began to move again.</p>

  <p>Just now, the snake had been continuously releasing red lights in all directions, but it had stopped after the consummate True God had descended. Perhaps it had needed a break.</p>

  <p>But now, another red Sanskrit word flashed in one of its eyes. It was about to launch the next wave of attack.</p>

  <p>"Get out of here first!" Reinhard urged, noticing the snake.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded and lifted Yan onto his back.</p>

  <p>Then, he ran toward the distance along with Reinhard and the guy with soybean-like eyes.</p>

  <p>To ensure their safety, each of them manipulated their avatars to protect them from behind.</p>

  <p>Although the Multiple Antennae Snake was powerful, its huge body slowed it down. Therefore, it was not difficult for them to dodge its red lights.</p>

  <p>Moreover, their avatars gave them additional protection, ensuring a smooth retreat.</p>

  <p>As Reinhard ran, he still kept stealing glances at Luo Zheng. He regretted that he hadn't planted the seed of the Eye of Perception just now.</p>

  <p>If Marsh and the others had seen what had happened just now, they might have been able to figure out the origin of Luo Zheng's sword strike.</p>

  <p>After a while, Reinhard decided to directly ask him what was on his mind.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, the sword attack you just used contained the Emotion Closing Divine Dao, right?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was shocked to hear that.</p>

  <p>He had been careful not to use the Emotion Closing Divine Dao even in the Time Sea, because it was forbidden in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Although he had never learned why it was forbidden, he had always been worried about using it. However, he had no choice just now.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Is there a problem?" Luo Zheng casually raised an eyebrow.</p>

  <p>With a bitter smile, Reinhard answered, "No. I'm just a little envious."</p>

  <p>"Why do you envy me?" Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Reinhard looked at the thick mist in front of him as a sharp look flashed in his eyes. "Everyone in the Sword Clan knows that even though the sword skill can be combined with any Divine Dao, there is no Divine Dao that is more compatible with it than the Emotion Closing Divine Dao. But since the Emotion Closing Divine Dao is forbidden, it's a great disadvantage for the Sword Clan."</p>

  <p>"The Sword Clan is not allowed to practice the Emotion Closing Divine Dao?" Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Even so, someone practiced it before," Reinhard murmured.</p>

  <p>"What happened to that person?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"He was expelled from the Sword Clan and chased away by other wealthy clans." Reinhard's face turned red with rage as he spoke.</p>

  <p>"The Sword Clan has to follow the rules set by all the wealthy clans on the Floating Islands," the soybean-eyed guy suddenly interjected. Then, he looked at Luo Zheng, and said, "Perhaps you can change that rule."</p>

  <p>Without a doubt, the Sword Clan didn't want to expel that warrior from their clan at all, nor did they bear to see that he was chased by other wealthy clans.</p>

  <p>However, just as the soybean-eyed guy said, the Sword Clan had no choice in the matter.</p>

  <p>"Well, why did those wealthy clans set this strange rule? The Emotion Closing Divine Dao is not a ruthless, evil way. Why is it forbidden?" Luo Zheng wondered aloud.</p>

  <p>After a few moments of silence, Reinhard answered, "That's an agreement among the Holy Beings. How could I know?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know much about it either. I just heard that the Emotion Closing Divine Dao is related to the Mountain of Holy Beings. Later on, the Holy Beings prohibited the cultivation of the Emotion Closing Divine Dao," the soybean-eyed guy said.</p>

  <p>"It's related to the Mountain of Holy Beings?" Luo Zheng's eyes narrowed.</p>

  <p>He didn't care about the ban now.</p>

  <p>Anyway, he was just a stowaway in the divine land and his identity had already been exposed. He didn't have anything holding him back.</p>

  <p>"I don't know the specific reason, though." The soybean-eyed guy shuddered, poker-faced. Then he looked up at the sky and said, "It's coming!"</p>

  <p>As a red light descended from the sky, they quickly flashed to the other side to avoid it.</p>

  <p>After they traveled some distance in the mist, a human wall suddenly appeared in front of them.</p>

  <p>They were stunned for a moment, but then they all burst into laughter.</p>

  <p>The red lights shot out by the Multiple Antennae Snake extended to almost every corner of the debate venue. This place was no exception.</p>

  <p>In order to resist the red lights, all the True Gods had summoned their avatars and made them link arms and climb on top of one another to form an indestructible wall.</p>

  <p>This was a very practical method indeed. As long as this wall of avatars was placed here, the red lights wouldn't be able to hurt the True Gods at all, no matter how powerful they were.</p>
