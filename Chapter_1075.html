<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Whoever can control the Ancestral Dragon shall have the power to control the Genuine Dragon race. As the most powerful super legendary beast, there is no way we are ever handing over the Ancestral Dragon egg to the human race," the red dragon said.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng listened close, not even saying a word as the red dragon spoke.</p>

  <p>The red dragon continued, "The war in the Divine Kingdom Continent was actually a war between the human race and the Genuine Dragon race in the Lower World. Unfortunately, the human race never expected that after my eldest brother was summoned out by the blood sacrifice, he destroyed three divine kingdoms. In the instant of space collapse, he used a secret method to destroy the ascending passage of this world.</p>

  <p>Therefore, none of the living beings in this world can fly to the Upper World anymore."</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes flashed as he heard such words.</p>

  <p>Being unable to fly to the Upper World had always been a problem for this world.</p>

  <p>After reaching the Soul Sea Realm, warriors originally could step into the path of the immortals.</p>

  <p>The likes of Miguel, Amber, and the Soul Sea Realm masters of the four divine kingdoms had been stuck within this boundless world and unable to fly to the Upper World.</p>

  <p>Other than the Dragon Soar Arenas, there were no other known methods to ascend.</p>

  <p>All living beings knew that there were problems in the world. However, not a single solution had come. Some questions remained unanswered.</p>

  <p>In the end, all of the Soul Sea Realm masters who could have ascended were trapped in this world until they just died. After the Five Aging Processes, they weren't able to do anything more and got swallowed whole by depression.</p>

  <p>It was the last thing Luo Luo Zheng had expected. It was the cyan dragon's eldest brother who had destroyed the flying passage of his world.</p>

  <p>"Why did your brother destroy the flying passage in the first place?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon sighed before answering, "It was because of the Ancestral Dragon, of course. The egg was born in this great world, so my clan took care of it and let it hatch slowly under their wing. However, that had become known to humans, hence the war."</p>

  <p>"So that's how it is," Luo Luo Zheng said after a moment of silence. "In other words, the reason why you asked me to enter the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land is to obtain the egg and hand it to the Genuine Dragon race?"</p>

  <p>"The Genuine Dragon race? Huh!"</p>

  <p>The red dragon snorted with a trace of disdain. His tone was evident with anger.</p>

  <p>"Brother?" The red dragon had something more to say, but the cyan dragon stopped him. "That's right, Luo Luo Zheng. I want you to get the egg, but it must not be returned to the Genuine Dragon race," the cyan dragon said.</p>

  <p>The longer their conversation went, the more Luo Luo Zheng got confused. It seemed like both the cyan dragon and the red dragon had some sort of conflict with the Genuine Dragon race. The last time Luo Luo Zheng had entered the Genuine Dragon World, he had already noticed some problems but didn't say anything because he was an outsider.</p>

  <p>Even so, he was going to try his best to help as much as he could. After all, the two dragons had contributed greatly to his accomplishments.</p>

  <p>Naturally, he also had his own doubts regarding the situation. "Even if the egg is in the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land, those Soul Sea Realm masters are unable to get their hands on it. With my current strength, I'm not sure I would succeed."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng knew so little about the relationship between the four secret lands.</p>

  <p>But since they were located within the Feather Holy Sea which was surrounded by the four divine kingdoms, he assumed that the Soul Sea Realm masters would have entered in search for the egg if they could.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon smiled and said, "The Heavenly Stellar Secret Land is different from the other three ones. It is impossible for them to obtain the egg, but I believe you may stand a chance."</p>

  <p>What the cyan dragon said gave Luo Luo Zheng a boost of confidence that he never knew he needed. He nodded and said softly, "If that's the case, then I'll do my best."</p>

  <p>Although he wasn't entirely sure that he could successfully help the two dragons obtain the egg they wanted, he was willing to give it his best shot. The first thing he had to do was to enter the Feather Emperor Secret Land and look for the life stones hidden inside it.</p>

  <p>Whether or not he succeeded depended on how the things could go next.</p>

  <p>Instead of leaving his house for other things, Luo Luo Zheng focused on his training every day. Without his order, Francis stayed close to the door, too.</p>

  <p>Three days later, Luo Luo Zheng suddenly heard faint footsteps coming from behind the door, followed by a high-pitched voice. "Here comes the crown prince! People without fixed duties, stay out of the way!"</p>

  <p>"The crown prince is here?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's brows rucked slightly.</p>

  <p>Soon after, he heard Francis' voice from outside. "Master, the crown prince of Harlen Divine Kingdom is here!"</p>

  <p>"Mm," Luo Luo Zheng acknowledged before he got up and left the room. A small smile hung on his lips, but he felt somewhat strange. What did the crown prince want from him?</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng walked out of the house, he saw the grand scene outside. dozens of Life and Death Realm masters wearing golden, embroidered gowns, with silver blades hanging on their waists, lined up by the door.</p>

  <p>He swept his gaze across them and saw that their blades were all at least low-grade sacred weapons. Somehow, they all looked the same.</p>

  <p>It was no secret that the Harlen Divine Kingdom boasted the technique of forging sacred weapons.</p>

  <p>In front of those Life and Death Realm guards was a young man on a wheelchair. He looked very sick, but his eyes beamed a strange light.</p>

  <p>When he caught Luo Zheng's gaze, he smiled.</p>

  <p>One of the eunuchs spoke up in a shrill voice, "Kneel down at once and greet the crown prince properly!"</p>

  <p>How could Luo Luo Zheng kneel before him? Glancing coldly at the eunuch, he thought to himself, 'You come to my door for no particular reason and then ask me to kneel? What kind of logic is that?'</p>

  <p>Then, the crown prince reproached, "Don't be rude. The man in front of you is a top talent in our kingdom. Men have backbone. What makes you think he'd just kneel down upon your order?"</p>

  <p>"But, Your Highness, you are this kingdom's crown prince! In the future, you will?"</p>

  <p>The eunuch's voice shook as he tried to explain.</p>

  <p>"Silence!" The crown prince criticized him severely, and then smiled at Luo Luo Zheng. "I'm sorry about that. He has always been rude. Please don't take it to heart."</p>

  <p>It was a petty drama that was unfolding before Luo Luo Zheng. He could tell by one look that both the crown prince and the eunuch were only putting an act to make him believe that the crown prince thought highly of him. That was the first time they ever met. That little trick he pulled caused Luo Luo Zheng to grow wary of him. He was scheming.</p>

  <p>Deep down, he had developed a strong aversion towards the crown prince.</p>

  <p>After he came to the Harlen Divine Kingdom, Luo Luo Zheng didn't want to attract any attention on him. However, Randy gave him problems during the examination, and now the crown prince had come to his house personally. The more he didn't want to be noticed, the more all these people knocked on his door.</p>

  <p>Now that he stayed in their kingdom, he couldn't just ignore or kick those people out. He had more important things to focus on.</p>

  <p>"Your Highness, what brings you here?" he asked nonchalantly.</p>

  <p>With a smile on his face, the crown prince replied, "I heard that you passed the examination of the Jade Martial House as an independent warrior, so I wanted to meet you personally. You do have an impressive appearance with great talent. It really shows!"</p>

  <p>"I'm very flattered. The truth is, I'm nothing but a boor!" Luo Luo Zheng responded after thinking for a moment.</p>

  <p>With the same smile, the crown prince said, "Come on. Let's not stand on politesse. There's a banquet at my house today. I would appreciate your attendance." Right after he spoke, he shot a look at the eunuch.</p>

  <p>A smile had crept on the eunuch's face as well. He took out a shiny golden card and handed it over to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>As he looked at the card in the eunuch's hands, Luo Luo Zheng was a bit hesitant.</p>

  <p>Did he really want to be there?</p>

  <p>At that moment, he had figured out the purpose of that visit. Most likely, the crown prince wanted to draw him over to his side like Randy, but he was more polite.</p>

  <p>It was the way of the world. Those who showed you courtesy weren't necessarily your friends.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng was contemplating whether or not he should attend the party, another voice from not too far away had reached their ears. "Brother!</p>

  <p>Why didn't you come to see me after you arrived at the city?"</p>

  <p>It was Randy.</p>

  <p>Surprisingly, he was alone and didn't have any attendants with him.</p>

  <p>The green robe he was wearing swayed as he strolled over towards them.</p>

  <p>He looked at the crown prince and then smiled at Luo Luo Zheng. "Tianxing, how have you been?"</p>

  <p>Feeling even more baffled than he already was, Luo Luo Zheng only nodded slightly.</p>

  <p>What did Randy and his brother really want?</p>
