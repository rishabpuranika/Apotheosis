<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>



  <p>
</p>

  <p>The lightning dragons circled around in the air and then slowly descended from the sky as if they were real. They effused blood-curling steam that engulfed the entire Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>After the internal conflict that happened, all of the warriors within the Cloud Hall were terror-stricken. The imposing momentum that they were experiencing at that moment gave the impression that the entire world was in a state of chaos.</p>

  <p>"Our leader's life and death crisis is coming!"</p>

  <p>"I wonder whether she can pull through!"</p>

  <p>"If she is able to break through to the Life and Death Realm, it would be a celebration for our Cloud Hall!"</p>

  <p>Those who had reached the Life and Death Realm were the most powerful masters among all the warriors, as the Life and Death Realm was the boundary between the strong masters and the ordinary warriors in the entire Central Region.</p>

  <p>There were many Virtual Tribulation Realm warriors in the Central Region that guarded a handful of third-grade sects. However, there was almost no Life and Death Realm warrior in sight.</p>

  <p>As long as a clan or sect was handled by a Life and Death Realm master, it could definitely enter the ranks of the fourth-grade sects. But there were only a few fourth-grade sects in the Central Region, such as the Cloud Hall, the Bloodwood Cliff, and the Mysterious Luna Hall.</p>

  <p>The Bloodwood Cliff had a Life and Death Realm master back then, but he died while passing through the tribulation. Now, it became a struggle for the sect to cultivate a new Life and Death Realm master.</p>

  <p>Life and Death Realm masters always had a great influence on their respective sects.</p>

  <p>Ultimately, the grade of a sect was to be measured based on its overall strength and background. The strong warriors of that particular sect were regarded as the most straightforward excellence.</p>

  <p>Raising his head, Luo Zheng looked at the white lightning dragons as they slowly flew down. He had a grave look on his face and so many thoughts ran through his head. Seeing as those dragons were quite terrifying, he wondered if Ning Yudie stood a chance.</p>

  <p>While Luo Zheng was worried about the situation, Xun was not bothered.</p>

  <p>After all, she was used to that kind of scene. Glancing at Zheng's hardened face, she smiled. "Don't worry about it too much. It is her decision to undergo the tribulation, so she must have prepared well for it."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng just nodded in response and then allowed his gaze to fall back on Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>In the presence of the enormous dragons, Yudie's petite figure looked even smaller.</p>

  <p>When the lightning dragons were only ten feet away from her head, Ning Yudie suddenly stretched out her white hands, and a small jade card appeared in one of them.</p>

  <p>As she gently flipped her jade card, countless ice phoenixes shot out from it. Suddenly, the cold light started to increase in intensity, and then spiraled upwards.</p>

  <p>"What a pure Law Power!"</p>

  <p>A flash of light reflected on Zheng's eyes as he followed the movement of the ice phoenixes.</p>

  <p>The ice phoenixes that Ning Yudie produced contained the pure power of the Ice Law, However, Luo Zheng was unfamiliar with the Ice Law that was contained in the Law Power. It seemed that the Ice Law had two layers.</p>

  <p>When those ice phoenixes rose and swirled in the air, they collided against the lightning dragons.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>As the two types of laws banged into one another, rays of light so bright erupted.</p>

  <p>Another dazzling light appeared in the sky above the Cloudy City which stretched about thirty miles away. Those who weren't in the area of the ongoing tribulation could only guess that a huge star had emerged from the sky.</p>

  <p>Only a very small number of warriors understood that this was the phenomenon caused by the Cloud Hall leader while she underwent the life and death crisis.</p>

  <p>They also knew that once Ning Yudie succeeded, the situation in the Cloudy City could be settled once and for all.</p>

  <p>It wasn't the Cloud Hall that was most affected by this internal strife within, but the Cloudy City itself.</p>

  <p>The majority of the warriors in the Cloud Hall were neutral, but almost everyone who chose to rebel was from the various clans in the Cloud City.</p>

  <p>They knew Yudie's personality very well. At first glance, she seemed like a delicate little girl. She wasn't at all tall and looked like she always needed help, but in reality, she was exceptionally powerful and tough.</p>

  <p>Also, she might not really remove all of the aristocratic clans from the city.</p>

  <p>After all, these great clans had a special relationship with the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>If Ning Yudie got rid of them all, it could greatly affect the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>As for the traitors, Ning Yudie was sure to wipe them all out. There was no traitor's life she planned to spare, nor was she planning to show any mercy to any sect leader.</p>

  <p>It was because of the special connections between the Cloud Hall and these third-grade clans that some of them were unable to escape even if they wanted to. Furthermore, the Central Region was in turmoil now, and it was better for them to just obediently pay for their mistakes than put up a useless fight. At the very least, these clans could still be under the protection of the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>Violent explosions rang out one after the other. Hearing the loud sound, Luo Zheng still looked calm and his expression did not change at all. His entire focus was on Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>Those lightning dragons were very formidable, but as Xun had said, Ning Yudie had prepared well, and the cold light emitted by her small jade card had already managed to weaken the dragons' power.</p>

  <p>Every time a layer of cold light leaked out, it interweaved with one lightning dragon. The ice phoenix and the lightning dragon simultaneously released two different kinds of Law Power which melted into each other.</p>

  <p>There were just as many ice phoenixes as the lightning dragons. When a dragon descended, an ice phoenix quickly rose up to crash into it.</p>

  <p>Not once did a dragon successfully land on Yudie's body. They were all offset by the ice phoenixes.</p>

  <p>Five minutes passed and the number of lightning dragons in the sky had drastically decreased. After several of the remaining lightning dragons were gone, Luo Zheng asked, "Is it over?"</p>

  <p>Shaking her head, Xun said, "I'm not so sure about that. There are all kinds of Heavenly Tribulations with different power. Generally, the Heavenly Tribulations that they encounter vary for each warrior. Some even face more than one. However, there is one unbreakable rule. The stronger the warrior is, the stronger the Heavenly Tribulation he or she faces."</p>

  <p>Rumor had it that the Heavenly Tribulation was a punishment from the Nature, but it was dismissed for absurdity.</p>

  <p>In truth, the Heavenly Tribulation was just one of the resisting methods of the Nature.</p>

  <p>As long as the Life and Death Realm masters appeared in the world, they could attract the attention of the Nature, because the Life and Death Realm was one of the boundaries of cultivation. After the warriors broke through and reached the Life and Death Realm, and even the Soul Sea Realm, they could have the capability to threaten the Nature Law.</p>

  <p>As for the Heavenly Tribulation, it came down as soon as the Nature Law sensed the threat and intended to eliminate the threat as early as possible.</p>

  <p>The Nature Law was very keen on threats and could sense one easily.</p>

  <p>Warriors who had extraordinary skills encountered equally extraordinary Heavenly Tribulations. For those warriors who were with average talents and didn't cause much threat, the tribulations sent down upon them were also less strong.</p>

  <p>In Xun's opinion, even if the Sutra of Empyrean Goddess that Ning Yudie cultivated was indeed compelling, it could cause a huge hindrance.</p>

  <p>Thus, the difficulty level of her Heavenly Tribulation was much greater than that of other warriors.</p>

  <p>That was one of the main reasons why there weren't many warriors in the Upper World who chose to practice powerful cultivation methods like the Sutra of Empyrean Goddess.</p>

  <p>Surely enough, after Ning Yudie had killed all those lightning dragons, a new surge of power and momentum began to spread throughout the sky.</p>

  <p>The dark clouds slowly changed color, turning from black to crimson red. It was as if an incomparably massive flame was rolling and burning within the clouds.</p>

  <p>Upon the appearance of that bright red cloud, a heat wave enveloped the vicinity. All of the warriors in the Cloud Hall felt it, and the heat wave caused a stir among them. They were all very alarmed.</p>

  <p>"Will the descending flames burn the entire Cloud Hall?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think our leader should undergo the tribulation in the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>This Heavenly Tribulation is too powerful. I'm afraid that after she passes through it, the entire Cloud Hall will be destroyed!"</p>

  <p>"If she doesn't do it in the Cloud Hall, where else can she do such a thing?" The warriors outside watched closely like tigers eyeing their prey. If Ning Yudie was to be targeted by the warriors from the Heavenly Evil Sect, then she could easily fail to break through the tribulation. Those little warriors could get so distracting.</p>

  <p>Everyone in the Cloud Hall activated their life vitality, forming a thin layer of it to block the heat coming from the sky. They all took precaution.</p>

  <p>The vigor of the fire cloud was immense and all of it was aimed at Ning Yudie. The heat wave's effect on the Cloud Hall was only a segment of it.</p>

  <p>This time, Luo Zheng did not say anything. What Xun said was right, and he had indeed underestimated Ning Yudie. After all, he had left Ning Yudie for two years, so how could Luo Zheng know what had happened to Ning Yudie in the past two years?</p>

  <p>At that same time, the red cloud rolled downwards and dropped itself towards Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>The expression on Yudie's face remained unchanged. She slightly flipped her finger, which not only prompted the activation of her jade card, but engaged her life vitality. When she gently pointed her finger upwards, the entire Ice Palace began to shake.</p>
