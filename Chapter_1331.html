<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1331 Different Types Of Law Power </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Fenton was probably the first talent Luo Luo Zheng had fought since ascending to the Upper World.</p>

  <p>Victory or defeat in this battle had no effect on Luo Luo Zheng. Moreover, death in the Illusion Space was nothing too serious. However, it had a crucial guiding role in Luo Zheng's judgment.</p>

  <p>Facing Fenton's third sword attack, Luo Luo Zheng was naturally wary.</p>

  <p>Huff, huff ?</p>

  <p>In the endless Illusion Space, countless violent gales appeared out of the blue and circled around Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Soon after, the formless gales began to squeeze together, creating a strong spiral tornado in front of Luo Luo Zheng, a layer of golden light covering it.</p>

  <p>"The Metal Law..." Luo Zheng's eyebrows twitched. "Is this the perfect fusion of the two types of Law Power?"</p>

  <p>Fenton's figure materialized once again next to the increasing number of gales that still fused together unceasingly. He no longer needed to hide his own figure.</p>

  <p>Just now, Luo Luo Zheng had easily deflected Fenton's second sword attack, which surprised the latter.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng's strength was reasonable and to be expected.</p>

  <p>Fenton didn't treat Luo Luo Zheng as any other ordinary warrior from the Lower World. Although he detested the foresight of the members of the thirteen palaces, he believed that they had an eye for outstanding warriors. Luo Luo Zheng indeed had some remarkable skills.</p>

  <p>However, his evaluation of Luo Luo Zheng so far was only limited to these certain 'skills'. An opponent of this level did not need to face Fenton's full strength to be defeated. Thus, he believed that Luo Luo Zheng would fail to block his third sword attack.</p>

  <p>When the gust of wind and the golden light merged together, Fenton stabbed his jade sword in the tornado.</p>

  <p>His jade sword was a secondary third-rank divine weapon, but being made of jade, it was extremely soft. As it pierced the winds, it instantly turned to dust.</p>

  <p>However, as the jade sword broke into pieces, Fenton kept his hold on the sword hilt and smiled at Luo Luo Zheng. "I think we should talk outside of the Illusion Space..."</p>

  <p>Once Luo Zheng's physical body within the Illusion Space was destroyed, his reflection would disappear, which implied that he would certainly 'die' under the sword strike.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Without waiting for Luo Zheng's reply, Fenton lifted the sword hilt easily. The mass of wind suddenly changed shapes; turning into the blade of his jade sword from the rotating circle it had initially formed. Fenton extended two of his fingers toward the 'blade', swinging the sword with his other hand with all his strength.</p>

  <p>Huff, huff ?</p>

  <p>A wind blade, flickering with golden light, charged straight at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"The golden wind blade!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was shocked to see it.</p>

  <p>He had seen this kind of golden wind blade before. In the middle of the Chaotic Ocean of Stars were a large number of golden wind blades.</p>

  <p>These seemed to possess some intelligence.</p>

  <p>They were far more powerful than the black wind blades and the two-colored wind blades. Luo Luo Zheng could try to transfer the power from those wind blades to other places, but he never dared approach the golden wind blades...</p>

  <p>As per his judgment, the power of the Wind Law contained within the golden wind blades was on an unimaginable level.</p>

  <p>'That's not right!'</p>

  <p>With a quick thought, Luo Luo Zheng denied his own conclusion. This particular golden wind blade had a similar shape, but the power contained in it should be inferior to that in the golden wind blades of the Chaotic Ocean of Stars.</p>

  <p>Fenton was undoubtedly the topmost talent in the tenth-grade sacred place.</p>

  <p>However, all warriors of the Celestial Position were great talents.</p>

  <p>At the time, it was very difficult for the several Spirit Supreme Realm warriors of the Celestial Position to tolerate the black wind blades, not to mention the two-colored wind blades and the golden wind blades.</p>

  <p>It was impossible for Fenton to have such formidable strength. It didn't make any sense at all.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng thought of this, the pressure in his heart suddenly dissipated and the chaotic energy within his body began to surge increasingly.</p>

  <p>He had learned the other Original Laws in the Immortal Mansion. His affinity toward the various Laws was high, and so, comprehending them was not too difficult. Before entering the Upper World, he had naturally prepared himself for all obstacles.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng swung his long sword, a wind blade suddenly appeared attached to its surface. This green wind blade revolved wildly around the sword.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng wanted to use the Wind Law to combat Fenton's attack.</p>

  <p>When Fenton noticed the Wind Law that Luo Luo Zheng employed, a trace of disdain flashed in his eyes.</p>

  <p>He was a warrior who mainly focused on cultivating the Wind Law. The Metal Law was his second choice. Thus, his cultivation method was also compatible to the Wind Law. As he saw Luo Luo Zheng perform the Wind Law, he thought Luo Luo Zheng was too overconfident and reckless to show off his meagre skills.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng seemed to be using the Wind Law that only had three layers. How could such a low level of strength block Fenton's sword strike?</p>

  <p>"I overestimated you," Fenton said in a whisper.</p>

  <p>As for the warriors of the Myriad Spiritual Force House, they were happy to witness the scene inside the Dragon Tiger Hall.</p>

  <p>"He is showing off his incompetence before a superior master! He is just asking to be humiliated!"</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha, this boy is a warrior who has only just ascended to the Upper World. Being able to practice the third layer of the Wind Law already is not bad!"</p>

  <p>"Let him struggle in despair for some time. When he comes out of the Illusion Space, we will make him eat the humble pie!"</p>

  <p>The warriors laughed out loud.</p>

  <p>As more and more warriors rushed back from outside, the spacious Dragon Tiger Hall got crowded. At least six or seven thousand warriors occupied the hall, perhaps even more. The other warriors who had not yet returned were in the process of practicing an important cultivation method in the secret chamber and were unable to come out.</p>

  <p>What these warriors did not know was that at the moment, even the Saint Lord and the elders of the Spiritual Force Sacred Place were silently watching the spectacle occurring in the Illusion Space.</p>

  <p>However, they wore puzzled expressions on their faces and their reactions were different from those of the warriors.</p>

  <p>"Elder Gong, what do you think of this?" The Saint Lord asked as he stared at the wind blade that Luo Luo Zheng had created in the Illusion Space.</p>

  <p>Elder Gong, who was also one of the founding members of the Spiritual Force Sacred Place, said with a serious face, "It's unusual... He is indeed performing the Wind Law, but this Wind Law just has three layers. He is far inferior to Fenton! I can see that the wind blade is completely different from any other ordinary one, however. It's so strange."</p>

  <p>The Saint Lord nodded. "I thought earlier that I was the only one who had this illusion. Luo Luo Zheng hasn't used any secret technique or cultivation method. He has only used his life vitality to condense the Law Power.</p>

  <p>How did he create it?"</p>

  <p>With their keen senses, the Saint Lord and the elders noticed the abnormality the moment Luo Luo Zheng created the wind blade.</p>

  <p>However, they were confused by this occurrence and did not know what it meant.</p>

  <p>There were only three layers to Luo Zheng's Wind Law, and the number of layers was a key factor for its strength. The quality of one's cultivation determined the power of the wind blade.</p>

  <p>The problem was that they could not tell what kind of technique Luo Luo Zheng had used. At most, it was only an exquisite and strange sword technique...</p>

  <p>However, the Saint Lord and the elders were rigid in their thinking, and it rendered them unable to see the clues hidden within Luo Zheng's technique.</p>

  <p>They didn't know that Luo Luo Zheng didn't use the life vitality in this instance and that there was in fact someone in this universe who could use chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>Indeed, he did not use any other cultivation methods, for the chaotic energy circulating in his body was a kind of cultivation method in itself that none of them had heard of before.</p>

  <p>When warriors absorbed the vitality between heaven and earth, they could transform it into life vitality to be used by themselves, which meant that they could utilize what was created by nature. After following the rules of using the life vitality, they could make it release great power.</p>

  <p>Chaos, on the other hand, was a purer substance. It was the very source of the world that was the cause of all formations, from a blade of grass or a tree to the mountains and rivers. The Law Power that erupted out of chaos was different from that of life vitality.</p>

  <p>The trials and tribulations that Luo Luo Zheng had endured in order to cultivate the Primal Chaos Technique were something that ordinary people could not imagine undergoing. However, the rewards that he would reap in the future were also beyond his imagination.</p>

  <p>Fenton's sword attack was powerful and seemed to overturn the entire continent. If his cultivation method had been performed somewhere else in the Myriad Spiritual Force House instead of the Illusion Space, it would have destroyed the place.</p>

  <p>In contrast, Luo Zheng's sword strike seemed less powerful. As he swung the sword, a green wind blade condensed in the middle of the sword light.</p>

  <p>The wind blade formed by the third-layer Wind Law was far from enough to withstand Fenton's strike. Many disciples of the Dragon Tiger Hall watched the battle with a mocking expression on their faces. They believed that the wind blade would be swallowed up by Fenton's sword attack very soon, along with Luo Zheng's body being engulfed and torn to shreds. They couldn't wait to see Luo Zheng's dejection upon leaving the Illusion Space.</p>
