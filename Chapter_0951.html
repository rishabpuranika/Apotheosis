<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Back when Luo Zheng rescued Craig and his tribe from the ogres' pasture, he had taken them with him and handed them over to one of the forces of the human race. The ordinary herdsmen were able to assimilate into this group easily.</p>

  <p>And now, Craig had also become a martial artist. He had also, surprisingly, reached the bone refining level.</p>

  <p>The tribe had not forgotten Luo Zheng, though they now understood that he was a warrior rather than a god. After some interaction with other people of their race, the herdsmen no longer confined to themselves and had come to know the martial art world and the situation of the entire Sea God Continent.</p>

  <p>But, even after opening their eyes to the reality outside of the pasture, they still regarded Luo Zheng as a kind of god or miraculous warrior sent by the heavens to save them.</p>

  <p>If it wasn't for him, they would still be living in that pasture, kept as food for the ogres.</p>

  <p>"Where is he? Tell me quickly!"</p>

  <p>Craig asked earnestly as he shook the little girl's shoulder. The other herdsmen had also gotten out of their tents and gathered together after hearing what the little girl said.</p>

  <p>However, Craig was already a martial artist at the bone refining level and his hands already contained great strength. The little girl's face immediately turned red with Craig shaking her violently.</p>

  <p>"Craig, stop!" one of the herdsmen scolded. "She won't be able to speak if you shake her like that!"</p>

  <p>Craig realized the sense in his fellow herdsman's words. He realized he was too excited and immediately released the little girl from his grip.</p>

  <p>The little girl rubbed her shoulder and glared at Craig, She huffed before pointing towards a certain direction in the sky, "Over there! I saw him head towards there!"</p>

  <p>The direction she pointed at was the exact same place that Luo Zheng had first appeared on this land which wasn't far from the pasture they had first come from. Although the entire Heavenly Eagle Prairie now belonged to the human race, the tribe still avoided that pasture because of all the bad memories.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>The moment she pointed where she had seen him, Craig immediately shot out like an arrow. Since he had reached the bone refining level, he now had absolute control over his bones and could cross great distances with absolute agility.</p>

  <p>The other herdsmen were also excited. They hadn't gotten the chance to thank Luo Zheng back then when he saved their lives.</p>

  <p>These pastures belonged to the Purple Heart Sacred Place and everyone on the Sea God Continent knew of Zheng's name. There was news of him every now and then but the herdsmen understood that, given the difference between their status, it would be extremely difficult for them to see Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>They knew very well that, try as they might, they would never be able to set foot in the legendary Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>Even someone like Craig did not have the slightest possibility of ever entering that tower. The Tower of Sin, after all, was a place where all the Sea God Continent's talents gathered. Even human-level talents were considered the lowest ranked warriors there. And many warriors couldn't even be counted as talents. There was really no way they could ever hope of getting inside.</p>

  <p>This was the only chance for them to see Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Amber landed softly on the ground, her purple robe billowing against the wind. Her aloof and detached eyes swept across the prairie as if looking for something. As a powerful master at the Soul Sea Realm, she had an acute sense of perception. After a few seconds, her eyes immediately widened.</p>

  <p>She had managed to effortlessly pinpoint the giant transmission array hidden under the prairie.</p>

  <p>She pointed towards the distance. "The transmission array is there."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked to where she was pointing at and his gaze landed on a large crater nearby. It was the place where he had first fallen into this continent.</p>

  <p>The damage caused by the impact of his landing was still very apparent despite the crater having already been covered by weeds.</p>

  <p>"Right here?" Miguel, the leader of the Purple Heart Sacred Place, had also landed on the prairie. The silk ribbon that was tied to his robe made him look like an immortal as it fluttered in the wind.</p>

  <p>After confirming the location of the transmission array, Miguel suddenly raised his hands and slammed them down the ground with an earth-shaking force.</p>

  <p>"Pa!"</p>

  <p>The turf around Miguel began to roll up as if a layer of skin was being lifted from the earth. Underneath the turf was a massive transmission array!</p>

  <p>The powerful masters from the Purple Heart Sacred Place and the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place slowly descended.</p>

  <p>A lot of masters came. Except for those at the Soul Sea Realm, numerous war sages and human warriors came along with Esther, Olivia, and Yolande.</p>

  <p>Today was the day Luo Zheng returned to the Heavenly Eagle Prairie. Today he returned to the Heavenly Eagle Prairie and it was the day he left this continent.</p>

  <p>The leaders of the two great sacred places had come to see him off. In the entire Sea God Continent, only Luo Zheng was entitled to such treatment.</p>

  <p>Everything was settled in the Tower of Sin. The Demon Night and the human race each had two top-level war lords in the Tower of Sin. Fabian from the human race and Elder Mei from the Demon Night had both become war sages. Both races were also planning to explore the Dark Nether Cave once again.</p>

  <p>Fabian had tried his very best to convince Luo Zheng to stay, at least until after the exploration of the Dark Nether Cave. However, Luo Zheng was pressed for time.</p>

  <p>Through his intensive cultivation, Luo Zheng had made a lot of breakthroughs and was now a fully-fledged war lord.</p>

  <p>Given enough time, it wouldn't be difficult for him to become a top-level war lord, but he just did not have that kind of luxury.</p>

  <p>When he left the Central Region, Luo Zheng had been aware that he did not have much time left to save Yan. He consistently worried every day about his sister. No one knew when the next Purple Power Body would appear and there was no telling when Eddie would manage to find one. Luo Zheng only hoped that Eddie would not find the next Purple Power Body so soon.</p>

  <p>"All good things must come to an end," Miguel sighed as he cupped his hands together in front of Luo Zheng. "Mr. Luo, today, we can only send you here."</p>

  <p>Who knew that Zheng's sudden appearance in the Sea God Continent would entail so much change for the entire human race? The Purple Heart Sacred Place that Miguel led was no doubt the top beneficiary of his arrival. He was extremely grateful to Luo Zheng but knew he could not force him to say. All he could do was travel the long-distance and see him off with good graces and hopeful wishes. It should be noted that war sages and warriors above the war sage level in the Sea God Continent did not use transmission arrays so he truly did travel long and far.</p>

  <p>Amber and the other Demon Night warriors suddenly bent their knee. "My queen," Amber said, addressing Xun who stood beside Luo Zheng. "I hope you return to the throne as soon as possible! If you encounter any danger, no matter where you are, our Heavenly Feather Sacred Place will rally forth in full strength and support you!"</p>

  <p>Amber did not say this out of courtesy. After finding out that Luo Zheng was about to leave, the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place had created a message rune that they had placed upon both Zheng's hand and Xun's statue.</p>

  <p>If Xun ever needed the help of the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place, all she needed to do was ask and their warriors would immediately drop everything and come to her aid.</p>

  <p>Xun nodded with a calm expression. "I see," she replied.</p>

  <p>Yolande's colorful skirt fluttered in the air, "I hope your choice is correct," she said to Luo Zheng in a faint voice. "We will meet again one day!"</p>

  <p>Until now, Yolande was still conflicted with her choice of handing over the Heavenly Fragment over to Luo Zheng. Although her stand was different from that of Mist, she understood that handing the fragment over to someone fated to lead the world of chaos was the best choice. However, serious disputes still existed among several lords in the Upper World. She was worried if Luo Zheng would one day stand on the opposite side against her.</p>

  <p>Yolande's Soul Split Spell divided her soul all over the continent. Her main body had reached the peak of the Upper World. As long as Luo Zheng remained on the path of martial arts, he would meet with her again sooner or later.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded at her words.</p>

  <p>Then, the two top-level war lords took out supreme life vitality crystals and began to place them onto the massive transmission array. The transmission array consumed a large amount of supreme life vitality crystals but the Purple Heart Sacred Place had no problem bearing the cost.</p>

  <p>At that moment, a figure appeared at the edge of the prairie and seemed to be running towards Luo Zheng at an extremely fast rate. It looked like the figure was a young man from the human race and over a hundred herdsmen followed behind him.</p>

  <p>Esther calmly gazed at the approaching herd, "Hmm?" she remarked, dropping her guard once she realized that the human warrior was only at the bone refining level.</p>

  <p>"Stop them," Miguel ordered. They weren't going to let a handful of herdsmen disturb them at such a crucial moment.</p>

  <p>A few of top-level war lords were preparing to stop them. However, Luo Zheng waved his hand, "No, let them come to me."</p>
