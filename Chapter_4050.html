  <p>
</p>

  <p>Under the command of their leader, the members of the Wooden Leaf race retreated to both sides. Then, Zheng and his group left and walked along the mountain road.</p>

  <p>Relief washed over Graham and Decker as they watched them depart.</p>

  <p>The fight between different races in Night View Island had been cruel. If Zheng and his group were another race that fought against them, their Wooden Leaf race would probably face extinction.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng and his group had only planted parasites in their bodies and even spared them.</p>

  <p>"These humans are quite merciful," Graham sighed.</p>

  <p>"They did let us go, but the Evil Tiger race is still watching us..." Decker muttered and shook his head.</p>

  <p>The Evil Tiger race expanded rapidly after they moved to the west of the mountain. Moreover, they also acquired the "Arcana" much faster than the Wooden Leaf race did, so they got to merge with stronger Treacherous Beings.</p>

  <p>With the current speed of their growth, it would not take long before the Evil Tiger race did something. The Wooden Leaf race surely could not fight against them, and it was easy to predict the outcome.</p>

  <p>Of course, Decker refused to accept such fate. That was also why he took the risk to lure the humans to this place.</p>

  <p>"It's all fate," Graham sighed again. "Once, only five people remained in our Wooden Leaf race. Our race got slaughtered, but we managed to pull through anyway. If we can't escape from this disaster, it means that our race is destined to end here," he said.</p>

  <p>"I don't believe in fate," Decker said in a firm tone.</p>

  <p>Then, he took a step forward.</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do?" Graham asked nervously.</p>

  <p>Yet, Decker turned a deaf ear to him and quickly caught up with Zheng and his group. At the same time, he shouted, "Masters, please wait for a moment!"</p>

  <p>Zheng, the Snake Goddess, and the others turned around and looked at Decker strangely.</p>

  <p>Decker continued, "Masters, it's not easy to go to the Ghost Mountain. I'm afraid you cannot enter the Ghost Mountain even if you reach it, especially if you have many people. You need to obtain a good amount of Arcana!"</p>

  <p>At that moment, his eyes flashed with excitement and he declared, "I can help you!"</p>

  <p>"We can find sacrifices by ourselves," the Snake Goddess said indifferently.</p>

  <p>Decker laughed and said, "Of course you can. But every creature from different races in Night View Island hunts for the prey to get more sacrifices. How many prey do you think are left on the island?"</p>

  <p>"Then we'll catch the creatures from the many races," Pearson said coldly.</p>

  <p>"There are creatures from different races that are sacrificed like prey every day. Although you are powerful, those creatures that have merged with the Treacherous Beings are something else entirely. I'm afraid it won't be easy to defeat them," Decker explained.</p>

  <p>Pearson frowned and didn't say anything. He thought what Decker said made sense.</p>

  <p>Zheng asked, "What's your suggestion?"</p>

  <p>"I know about every race on Night View Island. I can help you plan to seize their Arcana," Decker answered.</p>

  <p>Honestly, it was a good idea.</p>

  <p>Besides, it would take a long time if they collected the 'Arcana' bit by bit.</p>

  <p>Everything would be faster if they directly looted the Arcana from the others.</p>

  <p>"Why should we trust you?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi asked.</p>

  <p>In turn, Decker pointed at his body and said, "Don't forget that she has planted a parasite in me."</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess glanced at him and said, "Okay, we can trust you."</p>

  <p>Finally, he joined Zheng's group.</p>

  <p>The Wooden Leaf race's gathering place was at the south of the mountain.</p>

  <p>The west side was originally an open space, but the Evil Tiger race occupied it later on.</p>

  <p>"During this period of time, the Evil Tiger race have accumulated quite a lot of 'Arcana'. They are like fat sheep," Decker commented.</p>

  <p>He was responsible for guiding these humans to steal the "Arcana." As the biggest threat to the Wooden Leaf race, the Evil Tiger race naturally became their first target.</p>

  <p>"Who keeps the Arcana in their race?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"The leader of the race usually keeps the Arcana. That cave is where their leader lives," Decker answered without hesitation.</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he pointed at a triangular cave in the center.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Fuxi brought out the Heavenly Eye Vine from the spirit beast bag, which extended a thin vine towards Decker's forehead.</p>

  <p>When the vine touched his skin, he saw the scene in the triangular cave through the heavenly eye.</p>

  <p>"Their leader did not go out to hunt today. He's just in the cave," Decker's eyes lit up as he talked.</p>

  <p>"So do we charge in straight?" asked Fuxi. "No." Decker shook his head.</p>

  <p>"The Treacherous Beings that the Evil Tiger race like to merge with are called the Wind Ghosts. They are immensely swift, and the warriors of the Evil Tiger race are also quite agile themselves. If we alerted them, we would surely fail to catch their leader, and instead, they would surround us," he explained.</p>

  <p>Afterward, Sawyer quietly took out a few pieces of Magic Camouflage Skin and said, "So, we will use our old way."</p>

  <p>The Magic Camouflage Skin hid their bodies so they could get close to their target without notice.</p>

  <p>Zheng covered himself in the Magic Camouflage Skin and quickly descended from the top of the mountain.</p>

  <p>The leader of the Evil Tiger race had very sharp senses, especially his sense of smell. His nose could detect any change in the aura around him.</p>

  <p>When Zheng and the others slid to the cave's entrance, he immediately sensed that something was wrong.</p>

  <p>Just as he was sniffing the air, however, a loop of silver spider thread wrapped around his neck.</p>

  <p>He choked repeatedly and wanted to escape, but a young human suddenly appeared above his head. The young man stretched out his hand and pressed him down to the ground with a strong force, so he could not move.</p>

  <p>"Puff!"</p>

  <p>On the other side, a handsome, middle-aged man thrust his sword and stabbed his shoulder. Blood flowed out from the wound.</p>

  <p>After that, a beautiful woman swept down and flicked her finger, where a wriggling crimson worm emerged.</p>

  <p>She gently patted his shoulder then the energy parasite entered his body.</p>

  <p>Their cooperation was flawless. The leader of the Evil Tiger race did not have the chance to use his own bloodline power, nor did he have the time to use the Treacherous Being he had merged with.</p>

  <p>But even if he had reacted quickly, Zheng and the others still had a way to deal with him. They had even prepared much stronger methods to counter his attacks.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing?" the leader of the Evil Tiger race shouted.</p>

  <p>"Hand over the Arcana and we will spare your life," Zheng demanded.</p>

  <p>"No way!" the leader of the Evil Tiger race yelled with rage-filled eyes.</p>

  <p>The Arcana were the foundation of peace for the lives of the creatures from the various races like them, and also the only way for them to become stronger. Therefore, how could he be willing to hand them over?</p>

  <p>Furthermore, they had intruded the base of the Evil Tiger race. He felt that these people would not really dare to make a move.</p>

  <p>"Then go to hell..."</p>

  <p>A faint killing intent flashed in Zheng's eyes as if he was looking at a dead and cold corpse.</p>

  <p>When the leader of the Evil Tiger race realized that he would die, his expression suddenly changed. "The Arcana you want are here, here… I'll give them all to you!" he said hurriedly.</p>

  <p>Right after he spoke, a wooden box appeared in his hand. He opened it and revealed more than two hundred glazed crystals. It was a lot of Arcana!</p>

  <p>In return, Zheng casually counted them, put them away for safekeeping, turned around, and left.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess stretched out her hand and guided the worm to swim around his chest. A small bulge moved visibly through his skin.</p>

  <p>"This worm won't disappear for three months. I hope you won't do anything within that time."</p>

  <p>At the same time, she patted the leader's shoulder. Together with Pearson, and the others, they covered themselves with the Magic Camouflage Skin and quickly disappeared before the eyes of the leader of the Evil Tiger race.</p>

  <p>The group of people came and went like ghosts, then left the leader who stood numbly in the cave, still in a daze.</p>
