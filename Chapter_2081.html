<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Do I look funny to you?"</p>

  <p>Wayne snarled, his ugly face crumpling in malevolence.</p>

  <p>Since he was not human, it was natural for his appearance to be a bit odd. Unfortunately, he had an incredible amount of pride, so any sort of offense against him was intolerable.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," Zheng apologized as he tried to suppress his smile.</p>

  <p>Even if he was successful in forcing these people to swear the inner demon oath, they were still supreme elders of the divine land. It wouldn't be good for Zheng to be rude.</p>

  <p>Believing the sincerity of Zheng's apology, Big Mouth found himself surprised at how easy it was to talk to this young man.</p>

  <p>After taking such a serious inner demon oath, he could now be considered enslaved by this young man. There was no need for him to have apologized to him.</p>

  <p>In the divine land, both he and Master Evil were outlaws that were hunted by all forces. All the friends they'd made were naturally vicious and he often had to fight other people that made fun of his appearance.</p>

  <p>Of course, almost all True Gods that made fun of him were very swiftly eaten by him. This was because Big Mouth cultivated the extremely powerful Heaven Devouring Technique. After devouring a True God, he did not destroy their cinnabar field, rather he was able to merge his prey's inner world with his own. The more True Gods he consumed, the stronger and more terrifying his inner world became.</p>

  <p>His current strength was only a notch below Master Evil but the rate at which he improved was definitely faster. As long as he kept devouring True Gods, then achieving the consummation of True God's level and becoming a Holy Being wasn't that far off. To do that though, he needed to devour an unimaginable number of True Gods. It was after having devoured thousands that Bromley caught him.</p>

  <p>"Alas, I'm used to this," he muttered with an uncaring wave. "Set me free. Quickly!"</p>

  <p>If one treated others with respect then he or she too would be treated the same way.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded before using the token of heaven to help free this Big Mouth.</p>

  <p>As soon as he was set free, he quickly scrambled and ran out of the dungeon.</p>

  <p>Zheng was left in the dust. He turned his gaze and looked deeper into the dungeon once again.</p>

  <p>There was a big dog in the backyard and then Blayd who was locked out of the dungeon. On the first floor were Master Evil and Big Mouth, Wayne. Zheng also remembered hearing another voice, the one that told him he was requiring too much.</p>

  <p>At the end of the dungeon was a passageway that led downwards.</p>

  <p>The passageway was largely covered with moss. It was also only large enough for one person to pass through at any given time.</p>

  <p>A trace of hesitation quickly flashed through Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>There was already a True God in the Evolutionary Universe and that was Wynn. He only needed another two True Gods to fight with him. He could let two of Blayd, Master Evil and Big Mouth fight. There was no need for him to release so many people.</p>

  <p>Moreover, despite being imprisoned in this dungeon, the prisoners seemed to have a few useful abilities such as clearing away the dungeon moss.</p>

  <p>Zheng waited until both Master Evil and Big Mouth swore their inner demon oaths before entering the dungeon. If this fellow on the second floor was not as willing then he naturally wouldn't go in.</p>

  <p>This person seemed to be unwilling to speak with him and Zheng really had no initiative to compel a senior to do so. Since he didn't want to cause trouble, he simply turned around and prepared to leave.</p>

  <p>Just as he took a step, however, a soft voice broke through the darkness.</p>

  <p>"Young man, I cannot swear the inner demon oath."</p>

  <p>The young man stopped in his tracks. "Sir, I'm not going to force you but it's just that my strength is too low to face against you. I have to do this, for the sake of my own safety."</p>

  <p>"Alas," the voice signed faintly. "I understand."</p>

  <p>If Zheng let any of them out without any precautions, then he basically just signed his own death sentence.</p>

  <p>The second floor was once again plunged into silence for a moment before the voice spoke once again. "Young man, for some reason, I cannot swear the inner demon oath but there is another way to make you feel at ease."</p>

  <p>Even if this person was stronger than Master Evil and Big Mouth, anyone would desire freedom.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>A green ray of light suddenly shot out from the second floor. This light shot over and landed at Zheng's feet. "This is an Enslaving Token. I'll let you use it on me for the time being. Is this enough?"</p>

  <p>"Enslaving Token?" Zheng murmured in astonishment.</p>

  <p>Compared to the inner demon oath, an Enslaving Token was much more powerful.</p>

  <p>The oath only served as a restriction and Zheng could only use it to order them simple, non-life threatening stuff.</p>

  <p>However, the oath would fail to hold if the one who made it was forced to do something that was life-threatening. This also meant that they would suffer strong inner demon backlash which greatly increased their probability of dying. But either way, they would die. If Master Evil or Blayd was facing that state, in their anger, they might really kill Zheng first before they died.</p>

  <p>The Enslaving Token guaranteed full obedience to the bearer. If Zheng used it, he would be this mysterious person's absolute master. He even had the power to change this warrior's mood, erase this warrior's memories, or even turn this warrior into a puppet.</p>

  <p>To be willing to be enslaved like this made Zheng even more confused of this person's motives.</p>

  <p>"If you do not believe that this Enslaving Token is real then you can let the fairy palace's servant check it. Saul has followed Bromley for many years and should be able to recognize this token," the voice said.</p>

  <p>Zheng carefully picked up the green token and walked out of the dungeon.</p>

  <p>Outside, he quickly handed it over to Saul.</p>

  <p>The sight of the token rendered Saul speechless. "This is an Enslaving Token, the highest amongst its kind. Anyone, except the Holy Beings, can be enslaved by this token. The prisoner on the second floor gave you this?"</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded in reply.</p>

  <p>Saul tutted and then smiled. "Cunning."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"There was a period of time when the Enslaving Token was all the rage in the divine land. In the end, so many creatures grew to hate this thing.</p>

  <p>They would rather die than be enslaved," Saul narrated. "That prisoner who focuses on the cultivation methods regarding the soul cannot swear an oath with the inner demon because that would cause a huge blow to the Godly Way that prisoner cultivates. Hence, being enslaved by you seems a better option."</p>

  <p>The prisoner on the second floor had secretly observed Zheng. Confident that the young man was neither despicable nor dark, that prisoner willingly handed over the Enslaving Token in a desperation to attain freedom.</p>

  <p>That prisoner truly was cunning, as Saul had said.</p>

  <p>With his suspicions confirmed, Zheng took the token back and returned to the dungeon. Under the mysterious prisoner's guidance, Zheng sent a thread of his soul force into the token.</p>

  <p>The moment he linked the token with himself, Zheng immediately felt a cold feeling invade his mind as he sensed an unfamiliar, yet powerful soul. It seemed that he could read any thought or memory that this soul had.</p>

  <p>Zheng possessed the will of worlds which allowed him to read the lives of countless creatures, however, he was reading them as a bystander. Right now, Zheng had an absolute and unfettered view of this soul's secrets as well as its understanding of cultivation methods and life. There was no resistance and Zheng could even erase any memory if he wanted.</p>

  <p>In short, Zheng was now the master of this soul.</p>

  <p>"Can you release me now?" the prisoner's faint voice called out once again.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded. In a flash, he rushed through the narrow moss passageway towards the second floor. The moment he entered, the mossy walls suddenly wrapped around him.</p>

  <p>"Humph!"</p>

  <p>Zheng snorted as he began to fight his way forward.</p>

  <p>According to Master Evil, the moss in the Swirl Forest could swallow even a True God, but to Zheng, this was nothing once he activated the power of the nine stars. So Zheng began his fight against the growth of the thick moss.</p>
