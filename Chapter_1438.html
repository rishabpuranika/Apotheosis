<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>If one intended to get to the Dark Underground Palace, there was no other choice but to go through the Dark and Light Nine-turn Passage, and all of those nine turns had to be chosen correctly. If they so much as made a mistake along the way, then entering the underground palace would be out of the question, and one could only aimlessly go through the endless maze of passages.</p>

  <p>The level of difficulty of making it through the Dark and Light Nine-turn Passage might not appear to be too high at first glance. One would have to accurately choose between two different passages nine times. If one were to pin their hope solely on luck, the probability of getting through and choosing all the correct passages was only one in 1, 028.</p>

  <p>In any case, it wasn't really that big of a secret in the Dark World whether one should take the light or the dark passage. One could find that out without difficulty by simply asking around in this supreme world.</p>

  <p>However, at this moment, the three great races were all hoping that Lincoln's group had not learned of this secret from asking around in the Dark World, but from other supreme worlds. Only then would they be able to have hopes of opening the underground palace.</p>

  <p>The things that the Supreme Lord from remote ages had left behind were exceedingly tempting to any tenth-grade sacred place. For that reason, it shouldn't come as a surprise that everyone, be it ogres or Demon Night members, would have their attentions completely focused on every single person who had stepped foot into the place.</p>

  <p>After a couple of hours of walking along the dimly-lit passage, Lincoln suddenly stopped once again. Then, he proceeded to open up a light passage that didn't seem to contain any dark energy.</p>

  <p>What they had to do next was travel back and forth between two entirely distinct passages with Lincoln leading the way.</p>

  <p>Going through each passage would take a couple of hours. Upon making their way through the sixth and seventh passages, they opted to take some time to rest before going on their way.</p>

  <p>Finally, after two days and two nights of seemingly endless walking, they were now done pacing through this inconceivably long passage.</p>

  <p>Turning his head around to gaze upon the passage which they had just walked through, Coy blurted out, with fear apparently still remaining in his heart, "Just how long is this passage? We should probably be a long way away from Auspice City by this time, right?"</p>

  <p>"It's not that far away," answered Adrian, who had been staying on the tail end of the group, pointing with his finger. "It is indeed true that every single one of these passages is of quite a considerable length, but all of these passages had been designed in a way that we have only been walking in two big circles around Auspice City. At this point, we should have already made our way back to the bottom part of the city."</p>

  <p>"Are we actually right below Auspice City?" Finn Hou cried out, seemingly so dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>Nodding his head, Lincoln answered apathetically, "What Adrian said is correct. We are currently at the bottom of Auspice City. All of you, follow me!"</p>

  <p>After telling them that, Lincoln led the way and was the first to exit the passage. Hearing his words, the group immediately followed him.</p>

  <p>The moment they got out of the passage, the area surrounding them turned bright in an instant. And right in front of everyone was a colossal statue of a Nine-head Snake that was about the size of a mountain.</p>

  <p>"Five heads of the Nine-head Snake have already been cut off!" exclaimed Freya all of a sudden, who was standing behind Luo Zheng, with her eyes wide open.</p>

  <p>There were a total of nine massive snake heads protruding on top of the huge statue. Every single one of them had their fangs exposed, giving them the appearance like they could swallow the warriors at any second.</p>

  <p>Apart from that, the statue had quite a lifelike appearance. However, five out of the nine snake heads were severed just around the neck area, leaving behind only four snake heads still intact.</p>

  <p>Lincoln sized up the snake heads before he flew up and headed straight toward the seventh head of the Nine-head Snake statue.</p>

  <p>"The seventh head of the snake statue? Is that how he's going to open the seventh passage? Ha-ha, it seems like we're gonna need to get our disciples ready to go on an exploration of the underground palace. If the underground palace really were to get opened, it's going to take a lot of effort to fight for it and take everything inside!" Meanwhile, in the Dark Asura Sacred Place of the Dark World, a mountain-like ogre warrior had his gaze fixated on the scene that was happening in front of him and let out a blaring laugh, appearing as though he had great confidence in Lincoln's following actions.</p>

  <p>There was a total of nine ways to open the underground palace created by the Supreme Lord from remote ages, and those nine ways had been carefully passed down from generation to generation in great secrecy.</p>

  <p>None of the methods which could be used to open the underground palace were alike, so it was almost impossible to work those things out.</p>

  <p>And above all else, the Supreme Lord had placed quite a troublesome enchanted barrier inside the underground palace for undisclosed reasons.</p>

  <p>For a Soul Sea Realm or Spirit Supreme Realm warrior, this enchanted barrier could be considered as an overwhelming experience. Be that as it might, to a lot of world lords and Supreme Lords, it wasn't really something particularly worth mentioning.</p>

  <p>The main problem was that as long as the enchanted barrier received any sort of damage, everything in the underground palace would be destroyed instantly. For that very reason, not a single mighty warrior could force their way in.</p>
