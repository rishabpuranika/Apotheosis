<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Just now, the Three Eyes race was also shocked to see those blood-red balls rushing towards them.</p>

  <p>Except for the races that had submitted to the Nihility race, almost none of the other races on the Other Shore were willing to have anything to do with the Nihility race.</p>

  <p>The Three Eyes race had been thoroughly petrified, but they could do nothing aside from tensely watching the movements of the blood-red balls.</p>

  <p>When the blood-red balls stopped in front of Zheng, the members of the Three Eyes race instinctively sighed with relief.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, the confusion Egan and the leader of the Three Eyes race had in their hearts grew even heavier.</p>

  <p>Even though the opening of the Eternal Scroll Painting was a big day, the Element Spirit race and the Nihility race usually didn't show up.</p>

  <p>Now, the Nihility race suddenly appeared, and they actually came for Zheng?</p>

  <p>"Are you Zheng?"</p>

  <p>Samantha's cold voice came out of the blood-red ball before him. The silhouette of a graceful woman could be vaguely seen in the red ball.</p>

  <p>Zheng frowned. "Yes, I am. Is something the matter?"</p>

  <p>The last time he was in the Creation Myth Temple, Zheng suffered a lot in the hands of the Nihility race. The experience didn't leave any good impression of them on his mind, so he naturally wouldn't bother to be courteous with them.</p>

  <p>Because they had come straight to him, he knew that their question was just to confirm his identity. They already knew who he was and was just trying to be certain, so Zheng just admitted his identity outright.</p>

  <p>"Someone wants to see you."</p>

  <p>After Samantha finished speaking, her blood-red ball floated to the side.</p>

  <p>The blood-red ball behind Samantha's slowly floated forward and stopped in front of Zheng. There was vaguely a human silhouette inside the red ball.</p>

  <p>Before long, a black-haired man came out of the blood-red ball.</p>

  <p>The black-haired man stood with a wicked smile on his face but soon laughed out loud. "Have you ever thought of seeing me here?"</p>

  <p>Upon getting a clear look, Zheng found that the man was surprisingly the Evil God.</p>

  <p>The moment the Evil God appeared, many of the Oneness Sky Palace's Holy Soul Realm warriors standing behind Zheng looked like they got hacked by thunders.</p>

  <p>Most of them, like Athemar for example, had seen the Evil God before, so they naturally recognized him.</p>

  <p>This fellow had been swallowed by Zheng, but why was he still alive?</p>

  <p>Furthermore, how could he become a member of the Nihility race?</p>

  <p>What baffled them the most was his form. The Evil God's form was different from Zheng's when Zheng entered the Other Shore with his physical body. His entire features and even the details of his physical body could be seen clearly - he was actually an Other Shore creature!</p>

  <p>Zheng was also baffled. The Evil God's appearance here didn't surprise him.</p>

  <p>The Evil God's form, on the other hand, came as a baffling shock for him.</p>

  <p>"I've thought that you might become a member of the Nihility race, but I've never expected that you'd have a physical body on the Other Shore..."</p>

  <p>"Hahaha..."</p>

  <p>The Evil God burst into laughter again.</p>

  <p>He gently stroked his body with both hands, looking utterly satisfied. "It's more than having a physical body. I've completely become an Other Shore creature!"</p>

  <p>"What?" Zheng raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>He thought that the Evil God, just like Feng Ge, obtained a new body by chance. If that was indeed the case, his new body was just like an armor that couldn't leave the Other Shore and had nothing to do with his body in the chaos.</p>

  <p>However, what the Evil God just said completely shocked him and broke his conjecture.</p>

  <p>"If you've become an Other Shore creature, what about your physical body in the Source World?" Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Logically, after becoming a pure Other Shore creature, one couldn't have another body in the Source World.</p>

  <p>If the two bodies existed at the same time, wouldn't there be two Evil Gods when the Evil God of the Other Shore descended to the Source World?</p>

  <p>"I burned it."</p>

  <p>The Evil God calmly said, "I've burned down the Evil God you created. The Evil God standing before you now has gone through a rebirth!"</p>

  <p>A few months ago...</p>

  <p>Led by Sienna, the Evil God went to a place exclusive for the Nihility race— the Chilling Bone Land.</p>

  <p>The Chilling Bone Land was a very strange area. Before the Evil God went in, Sienna warned him that once he entered the Chilling Bone Land, he would transform into another creature and that he wouldn't be able to return to the Source World.</p>

  <p>This way, not only could the Evil God get rid of the restraints of the role of Inner-world Generating Avatar, but he would also have an extremely powerful body.</p>

  <p>The disadvantage was obvious— he wouldn't be able to return to the Source World unless the Nihility race found a method for him to go there.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, the Evil God agreed without the slightest hesitation.</p>

  <p>Whatever the price was, he was willing to pay as long as he could get free from Zheng's control.</p>

  <p>Before entering the Land of Bone Tribulation, the Evil God decided to return to the Source World for one last time.</p>

  <p>In the Source World, he dug a small tomb for himself, sat upright inside it, and then buried himself with his own hands.</p>

  <p>Not long after the Evil God returned to the Other Shore, a wave of violent energy surged in the North Unicorn Province.</p>

  <p>If the North Unicorn Province was still in its heyday, many people would be alerted by this phenomenon.</p>

  <p>However, after a round of Nine-Sun World Destruction activated in the North Unicorn Province, the entire province had been destroyed and left in ruin. That was why, despite such a terrifying force of truth being released, it completely didn't attract anyone's attention.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>That wave of energy flashed past and went straight towards the tomb dug by the Evil God. When the energy reached the tomb, the Evil God's body inside it suddenly combusted. The green flames burned fiercely and quickly turned his body into ashes. However, the flames seemed to be restricted to his body, so the tomb was completely undamaged.</p>

  <p>The way the Evil God became an Other Shore creature was completely different from what happened to Feng Ge. In her case, she obtained a physical body, which would act as armor for her Soul of Light in special circumstances, so she didn't trigger the Punishment of Truth. What the Chilling Bone Land of the Nihility race did to Evil God, on the other hand, was against the truth. Since it was something forbidden, it would naturally invite punishment from the truth.</p>

  <p>Zheng stared at the Evil God for a long while before he suddenly shook his head. "You haven't become another person. You're the same Evil God as before."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" The Evil God frowned.</p>

  <p>"Nothing has changed in my inner world," Zheng replied shortly.</p>

  <p>The Evil God was the incarnation of negative emotions in Zheng's inner world. If he had really broken away from Zheng and his real body had perished, the negative emotions would definitely return to Zheng's inner world.</p>

  <p>"So what?" The Evil God shrugged. "At least, I'm free from your control!"</p>

  <p>"Only for the time being," retorted Zheng.</p>

  <p>"You... You are talking nonsense!"</p>

  <p>The blue veins on the Evil God's forehead bulged and looked like they were going to explode.</p>

  <p>The memories of the past left too deep of an impact on the Evil God. Every time he fought against Zheng, he always ended up defeated, something completely unacceptable for the extremely arrogant Evil God.</p>

  <p>Realizing that he was losing his composure, he quickly focused himself. He said calmly, "No one knows what will happen in the future. Maybe there will be a way for us to coexist someday!"</p>

  <p>Once again, surprise emerged in Zheng's gaze.</p>

  <p>During the time the Evil God spent with the Nihility race, his personality seemed to have undergone a great change. At least, he was no longer eager to kill Zheng the moment he laid eyes on him like before.</p>

  <p>"So? What do you want to say to me? You can't be coming all the way here just to tell me about your current situation, right?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"On behalf of the Nihility race, I want to invite you to join us," said the Evil God.</p>

  <p>The Evil God's request caused an uproar among the crowd.</p>

  <p>On the one hand, these races of the Other Shore were afraid of the Nihility race. On the other hand, they envied the Other Shore creatures which were favored by the Nihility race.</p>

  <p>Since the Nihility race could become another great force that had the power to contend against the Element Spirit Civilization, they naturally had their own unique advantages. For example, they possessed the Chilling Bone Land, which could transform the creatures of the Source World to the Other Shore creatures at any time— something that even the Element Spirit Civilization couldn't achieve.</p>
