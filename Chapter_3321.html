<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>In the old days, many ruling civilizations existed in the chaos.</p>

  <p>The Dreaded Eye Demons and the Grand Sky race were two of those ruling civilizations that reigned over the entire chaos.</p>

  <p>"There are seven hundred forty nine ruling civilizations?" Luo Zheng smiled as he was told about this incredible piece of information. "It seems that the number of ruling civilizations is a lot more than I originally thought," he said.</p>

  <p>"Indeed. There are many ruling civilizations," the voice replied confidently.</p>

  <p>"However, only some of them are strong. At the very least, our Green Jade Civilization is among the top ten."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't respond to this bold statement. Meanwhile, No. 9527 seemed unconvinced. "Really? The top ten?" asked the silent spectator.</p>

  <p>"Why? What's wrong?" Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"Humph, the Green Jade Spirit is only exaggerating," No. 9527 sneered.</p>

  <p>The moment the Green Jade Bugs and Green Jade Beasts appeared, No. 9527 already distinguished them as the civilization that once existed in the chaos.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, the history of every civilization and creature that ever lived on the Other Shore could be traced. Their movements could be located in the past chaos. As such, No. 9527 didn't find much importance in the Green Jade Civilization.</p>

  <p>"What are you trying to say?" Luo Zheng seemed a little bit intrigued.</p>

  <p>"The top ten civilizations have all been recorded. Nonetheless, there isn't any record of the Green Jade Civilization being one of them. They remain in Stage Thirteen, which shows that they are not that strong. If they are really one of the top ten, then they should be within Stage Thirty Two, at least!" answered No. 9527 with much skepticism.</p>

  <p>After listening to what No. 9527 said, Luo Zheng questioned the Green Jade Spirit,</p>

  <p>"Well, since you claim to be one of the top ten ruling civilizations, why do you stay in Stage Thirteen?"</p>

  <p>The voice kept silent for a while. There was no point in keeping secrets about the Green Jade Civilization anymore. With that, it replied, "It's because the 748th civilization is hunting us down."</p>

  <p>"Hmm, the 748th civilization? What kind of civilization is it?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Once more, his curiosity was piqued.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, No. 9527 was baffled. Even though it had a significant portion of its master's memory, it didn't have much information about the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>"It's the Nihility race. They are the ruling civilization above us," the voice replied gloomily. It seemed to remember how awful they were.</p>

  <p>"The Nihility race? The one that believes in the Nihility Way?" Luo Zheng frowned.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 once told him that a group of lunatics intentionally aspired to destroy everything in the chaos. They were convinced of the Nihility Way and attempted to drive the chaos into oblivion.</p>

  <p>"The Nihility race ranks seventh among the top ten civilizations," said No. 9527 gravely. It began to believe the Green Jade Spirit's claim. "If what the Green Jade Spirit said is true, the Green Jade Civilization truly won't have a foothold in any upper stage of the Other Shore since the Nihility race is set upon killing them."</p>

  <p>"In order to preserve the remaining glimmer of hope for our civilization, we have hidden our last hometown in Stage Thirteen. The Nihility race is not able to return to the Lust World. Even if they do come, they do not have the ability to kill us here," replied the Green Jade Spirit firmly.</p>

  <p>"The chaos in which the Nihility race resided was destroyed and then you rose to power. Why did they chase after you?" Luo Zheng asked the voice once more.</p>

  <p>The past chaos contained too many secrets. The more Luo Zheng knew about it, the more he felt like there were lots more he had not uncovered yet.</p>

  <p>"It's very simple. During the era of the Green Jade Civilization, the Nihility race had almost destroyed the entire chaos. However, we put a stop to all of it," the Green Jade Spirit answered proudly.</p>

  <p>There were many other civilizations that followed after the Green Jade Civilization.</p>

  <p>If it weren't for their interference during that time, the new civilizations would not have existed anymore. The chaos would have been empty by now.</p>

  <p>"In addition to that, we found a way to change the fate of the chaos," the Green Jade Spirit continued. It seemed very eager to talk about their civilization.</p>

  <p>"A way to change the fate of the chaos?" As he heard this, Luo Zheng became excited and asked, "Are you talking about the Finale Way?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," confirmed the Green Jade Spirit. "We have found some clues. You can find them all in the Civilization Artifact."</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng was talking to the Green Jade Spirit, a dot of green light appeared in the illusion. It meant the birth of a new world.</p>

  <p>After countless cycles of annihilation and rebirth within the past hundreds of millions of years, several kinds of extraordinary lives were born in the chaos. The Green Jade Civilization was the most peculiar one among all of them.</p>

  <p>The members of the Green Jade Civilization didn't possess a body. The substance they were made of was jade.</p>

  <p>The dot of green light was the Source World during the era of the Green Jade Civilization. It was also an incredibly large piece of jade.</p>

  <p>The images presented before Luo Zheng's eyes were rapidly changing.</p>

  <p>The jade world continued to expand as the chaotic energy continued to gather within that magnificent large piece of jade. In this world, there were a variety of creatures that were made up of jade.</p>

  <p>In contrast with the other civilizations, all the creatures in the Green Jade Civilization were united and cooperative. Wars within the same race were almost non-existent and development was remarkably fast.</p>

  <p>With a flash of green light, a jade creature appeared before Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The creature was a bird. Even though it was only as big as a fist, Luo Zheng recognized it at once. "It's the enormous bird that is sealed in the Green Jade City!" he said enthusiastically.</p>

  <p>"It's the Wing King. It's the first powerhouse in the Green Jade Civilization to reach the Other Shore and the king of our civilization." There were certain courteousness and reverence in the way the Green Jade Spirit uttered these words.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng finally understood what he saw before.</p>

  <p>He was extremely shocked to see a gigantic bird sealed under the jade ground.</p>

  <p>Apparently, that giant bird was the king of a civilization!</p>

  <p>In Luo Zheng's era, even the strongest warriors of the super forces were of no match for the Wing King. These warriors included those from the Snake Goddess race, the Divine Farmer race, the Bearing race, and the Separate Abyss race.</p>

  <p>In an instant, the Wing King grew before Luo Zheng's eyes. From the size of a fist, it transformed into a gigantic bird. Simultaneously, the entire jade world became even larger and more prosperous.</p>

  <p>The birth, beginning, resurgence, and destruction of the Green Jade Civilization were all recorded in the Civilization Artifact, just as the Green Jade Spirit said.</p>

  <p>In spite of this, a rebellion broke out during the most prosperous stage of the Green Jade Civilization.</p>

  <p>The entire jade world split into two groups. It started to collapse into the chaos of the battle that lasted for several years.</p>

  <p>"The rebels were controlled by the people of the Nihility race on the Other Shore. They were the ones who truly incited the rebellion. The Green Jade Civilization almost fell into ruin," revealed the Green Jade Spirit despairingly.</p>

  <p>"Hence, the Wing King also chose the Finale Way but failed?" Luo Zheng asked inquisitively.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he failed." The Green Jade Spirit sounded a little regretful. "He had been successful in finding the clues left behind by the first ruling civilization. He had also been able to find the way to realize the Divine Dao Great Unity. Ultimately, He still failed."</p>

  <p>"Hmm, the way to realize the Divine Dao Great Unity?" pondered Luo Zheng. As soon as he heard this, Luo Zheng became interested even more. The final solution to the Finale Way turned out to be the Divine Dao Great Unity.</p>
