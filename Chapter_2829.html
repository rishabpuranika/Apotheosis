  <p>
</p>

  <p>Tianming was feeling slightly uneasy.</p>

  <p>He replied, "We are in different positions."</p>

  <p>"What did you say? Different positions?" Nicholas' eyes were full of disappointment. "I treated you so well!"</p>

  <p>Tianming had entered the Floating Island of the Dongfang Clan and received the resources and training of the clan. He had smoothly explored those forbidden lands with their help. And his marriage was granted by Nicholas himself.</p>

  <p>Tianming shook his head and said, "I'm not Lowell. My name is Hua Tianming, and I am from the Evolutionary Universe."</p>

  <p>Hearing his answer, Nicholas was slightly stunned. The expression in his eyes suddenly became fierce. At the same time, a self-mocking smile appeared on his face. "Evolutionary Universe! Were you also trained by Mike?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Tianming answered firmly.</p>

  <p>"Hahaha."</p>

  <p>Nicholas' laughter grew louder and louder and more sinister.</p>

  <p>He was hugely frustrated. The reason for his distress was not Zheng or Tianming, but Mike.</p>

  <p>"Mike was really a cunning man. He died a long time ago, but he still managed to get back at me," muttered Nicholas.</p>

  <p>His eyes flashed.</p>

  <p>The Dark and Light Destruction Sword in his hand suddenly grew three feet longer and flew towards Tianming at an incredible speed.</p>

  <p>"Watch out!"</p>

  <p>Zheng was taken aback. A flash of the fire lingered on the Shadow Bearing Sword and he also wielded his sword.</p>

  <p>However, Tianming was very close to Nicholas. The latter's sneak attack gave no time to Zheng to help Tianming out.</p>

  <p>Tianming still maintained his calmness. A unique light flashed in his eyes, and an irresistible aura emitted from his body.</p>

  <p>Under the aura's influence, no one was allowed to make a move on him.</p>

  <p>If it was someone else, they wouldn't be able to stab Tianming.</p>

  <p>However, Nicholas was not an ordinary person after all. His Soul of Light was very close to the Other Shore. It was far stronger than the ordinary Souls of Light.</p>

  <p>The aura emanating from Tianming's body merely made Nicholas' movements a little slower, but the Dark and Light Destruction Sword continued to advance forward.</p>

  <p>Thankfully, this slow pace gave Tianming enough time to react.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>"Soaring Snake Sword!"</p>

  <p>Ice flowers fluttered on the Soaring Snake Sword, and at the same time, some strange streaks of lightning burst forth.</p>

  <p>Back in the universe, Tianming had not been able to unleash the full power of the Soaring Snake Sword.</p>

  <p>However, now he had become stronger than before.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>When the Dark and Light Destruction Sword collided with the Soaring Snake Sword, Nicholas felt a chill emanating from his hand, as if he was being frozen.</p>

  <p>Not only that, the beams of lightning rushed towards Nicholas. They were like the tusks of a giant beast that wanted to devour Nicholas.</p>

  <p>"This is the punishment lightning of the Ruling Slate!"</p>

  <p>When Nicholas' eyes fell on the lightning, it looked as if he had seen a ghost.</p>

  <p>He was the one who had revised the largest number of rules among all the Holy Beings. Therefore, he was familiar with the punishment lightning of the Ruling Slate. No one could deflect it.</p>

  <p>In the past, some Holy Beings had racked their brains to find a way to avoid the punishment lightning of the Ruling Slate, but no one had succeeded so far. Therefore, once the Ruling Slate summoned the punishment lightning, many Holy Beings had no option but to surrender.</p>

  <p>Maybe the power of the punishment lightning unleashed by Tianming was not as powerful as that of the Ruling Slate, but the momentum was pretty much the same.</p>

  <p>Left with no choice, Nicholas was forced to make a hasty retreat.</p>

  <p>However, as soon as he retreated to the other side, Zheng followed him closely.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>Zheng's sword struck him hard.</p>

  <p>Nicholas couldn't avoid it and had to raise his sword to block the attack.</p>

  <p>Clang!</p>

  <p>When the two swords collided, the light of the Dark and Light Destruction Sword was dimmed again to some extent. Nicholas continued to fall, in the process, distancing himself from Zheng.</p>

  <p>But Tianming had gone around the circle and once again tried to stab Nicholas with his sword from the other side.</p>

  <p>Already Nicholas was finding it quite difficult to deal with Zheng and now with Tianming joining the fight, he was under tremendous pressure.</p>

  <p>Bang, bang, bang!</p>

  <p>He fought with the two men with all his strength.</p>

  <p>In terms of swordsmanship alone, Nicholas was much stronger than Zheng and Tianming. After all, he had spent a lot of time practicing it and his lifespan was much longer than Zheng's and Tianming's. Moreover, he had encountered all kinds of dangerous situations before. So he also had experience on his side.</p>

  <p>But Zheng and Tianming had extraordinary theurgies, and they had combined the abilities of the two girls. Now their power was so great that ordinary Holy Beings would be no match for them.</p>

  <p>Nicholas could see the future but due to Zheng's ability to read memories, it was difficult for him to use his skill.</p>

  <p>Nicholas was in great danger right now.</p>

  <p>The members of the alliance of powerful clans were very worried.</p>

  <p>After all, they were trapped there, and their only hope was Nicholas. Now even he was in danger. How would they escape?</p>

  <p>"Humph!"</p>

  <p>Nicholas blocked Zheng's sword which was coming at him. Suddenly a black light appeared in his palm and the next moment it zoomed to Tianming.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The black light lashed out and knocked Tianming out.</p>

  <p>Nicholas took the opportunity to retreat quickly. This was the only trick he could use to get rid of these two formidable foes.</p>

  <p>But when he was a little far away, he suddenly sensed a force of space sweeping across and enveloping him.</p>

  <p>The scene in front of him changed. Zheng's sword was already poised to slash his head.</p>

  <p>"Samuel! You!"</p>

  <p>Nicholas was furious at this point.</p>

  <p>He finally managed to distance himself from Zheng and Tianming, but Samuel created a space channel and pushed him right back to Zheng once again.</p>

  <p>Samuel, on the other hand, was very proud of himself and was smiling triumphantly.</p>

  <p>His goal was the True Demon Body too, but at this critical moment, he was more willing to hinder Nicholas.</p>

  <p>The woman's eyes lit up when she saw what Samuel had done.</p>

  <p>She couldn't join the battle with the trio now, but she could also use the Spear of Supreme Harmony to help Zheng.</p>

  <p>Crack, crack, crack!</p>

  <p>Nicholas' Dark and Light Destruction Sword was getting dimmer and dimmer by the minute.</p>

  <p>Zheng's unrelenting and fierce attack caused the long black-and-white sword to finally disintegrate into black-and-white fragments that gathered in the huge Eight Diagrams disk above.</p>

  <p>Zheng's long sword was pointed at Nicholas, and Tianming was blocking his escape route.</p>

  <p>"It's over," said Zheng lightly.</p>

  <p>Today he finally had the thrilling opportunity to kill his enemy but he was abnormally calm.</p>

  <p>Nicholas stared at Zheng. Although Zheng was still a young man, he vaguely saw Mike's shadow in Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Is it over?" Nicholas heaved a sigh of relief quietly. It seemed that he had made up his mind. Suddenly, he laughed manically and said, "Good. It should be over!"</p>

  <p>He waved his hands upward.</p>

  <p>The Eight Diagrams disk above the void began to rotate once more.</p>

  <p>"The heaven and earth form a furnace, and Dark and Light energies are charcoal. Everything is copper!" Nicholas folded his hands all of a sudden and shouted loudly, "I'm the craftsman! Refine!"</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>The aura within the void suddenly became ten times stronger than before.</p>

  <p>As the huge Eight Diagrams disk rotated like a millstone, it seemed as if it was going to refine everything within the void.</p>
