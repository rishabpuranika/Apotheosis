<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng had already managed to come back to his senses, but the heavy sword he was wielding in his hand was still trapped in the illusion of the humanoid creature.</p>

  <p>It was not easy for the spirit inside the sword to regain its senses. Thus, under its control, Zheng just continued to slay the black bugs rushing towards him.</p>

  <p>At the same time, once a black bug was killed, a white light would appear from it.</p>

  <p>Some of the white lights would enter Zheng's body, while the rest penetrated the heavy sword.</p>

  <p>"What is this? What's going on?"</p>

  <p>Zheng couldn't prevent the white lights from invading his body. As the lights reached his mind, he felt a sensation that his thoughts were being manipulated.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the ancestry-level bloodline was on high alert. As soon as the white lights entered Zheng's mind, it would immediately take action and purge them.</p>

  <p>"Can you also destroy these white lights inside the sword?" Zheng asked the ancestry-level bloodline. If the white lights continued to infest the heavy sword, he would also be greatly affected.</p>

  <p>"I can give it a try," the ancestry-level bloodline replied briefly.</p>

  <p>Without Zheng telling it, it could sense that he was being controlled by the sword in his hand.</p>

  <p>Thus, the ancestry-level bloodline quickly released a brown aura, making it flow through Zheng's body and spread along his arms in order to permeate the heavy sword.</p>

  <p>The instant that the brown aura penetrated the sword, beams of white lights swarmed towards it.</p>

  <p>The white lights were like an automatic defense mechanism that attacked any foreign entity that probed into their territory.</p>

  <p>In their clash, the ancestry-level bloodline didn't care about spending as much energy as it could because it was basically powered by infinite energy.</p>

  <p>It was pretty confident that it could prevail and remove all the white lights inside the sword, though it might take a little while.</p>

  <p>However, the sword responded immediately as the ancestry-level bloodline launched a soul attack.</p>

  <p>Currently, the spirit of the sword got carried away in slaying the black bugs. But when it noticed the soul attack coming from the ancestry-level bloodline, it immediately shifted its focus and fought without hesitation.</p>

  <p>Then, wisps of green energy came out of the sword's spirit which looked like a ball of red light.</p>

  <p>As the green energy was released, the sword was able to successfully resist the soul attack of the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>"This is troublesome…"</p>

  <p>The ancestry-level bloodline was rendered speechless by the turn of events.</p>

  <p>It definitely intended to save the sword's spirit, but the latter saw the ancestry-level bloodline as an enemy and fought back.</p>

  <p>The white lights continued to confuse and control the spirit of the sword, but it had no way to realize it.</p>

  <p>"So, how did it go?" Zheng inquired as he gripped tightly on the heavy sword.</p>

  <p>"I failed. This approach doesn't seem to work. The spirit of the sword noticed my soul attack and immediately fought back. The white lights inside are manipulating it into thinking that I am an enemy," the ancestry-level bloodline replied in a frustrated tone.</p>

  <p>Zheng was a bit surprised at the ancestry-level bloodline's response. He tried to calm down and thought of a feasible solution before he said, "We can keep it from acquiring the energy it needs."</p>

  <p>Originally, the heavy sword was only left with a little energy. That was why the sword was not very powerful when it was still in Kincaid's possession.</p>

  <p>Then, all of the energy that accumulated on the altar for so many years was consumed by Zheng.</p>

  <p>The sword was constantly attacking with its full might and even activated the Probability Extreme Form and the Flame Extreme Form earlier. But once the ancestry-level bloodline stopped providing it with energy coming from Zheng, the spirit of the sword would eventually run out of energy soon enough.</p>

  <p>When that happened, the ancestry-level bloodline could take the opportunity and remove the white lights inside the sword.</p>

  <p>"Excellent idea. I'm on it!" The ancestry-level bloodline quickly grasped what Zheng was planning, so it didn't waste any time and initiated their move.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the blood-colored sky in the primitive land instantly calmed down.</p>

  <p>When the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and the others noticed the silence in the sky, they all thought that the fight between Zheng and the humanoid being was finally over.</p>

  <p>Under the control of the sword's spirit, Zheng had been constantly using and brandishing the heavy sword to kill the bugs.</p>

  <p>However, the ancestry-level bloodline had already stopped providing it with additional energy, thus the energy stored inside the sword eventually ran out. In turn, the lights that it emitted also grew dimmer.</p>

  <p>Although the spirit of the sword was still eager and frantic to slaughter the black bugs, it was unable to do so because it was already lacking with energy.</p>

  <p>"Huh? What's going on?"</p>

  <p>The humanoid creature immediately sensed that something wrong was going on with the sword in Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>However, as his six pairs of compound eyes flashed, he instantly figured out what Zheng had been up to.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! You insolent brat! Do you think you can outsmart me with your petty tricks?"</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, the humanoid creature stretched out his hand and a black cloud instantly emerged above Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>Since Zheng couldn't use the heavy sword that had run out of energy, the humanoid creature tried to take the upper hand and bring Zheng down using the Probability Extreme Form.</p>

  <p>At Zheng's current state, he wouldn't be able to utilize the Probability Extreme Form to counter the attack of the humanoid creature. "He's going to use the Probability Extreme Form again!" he said as his eyes widened in shock and anger upon sensing the hint of energy coming out from the humanoid being.</p>

  <p>The moment Zheng finished speaking, he suddenly felt that a massive fist smashed against his chest.</p>

  <p>He was caught off guard and didn't even have the time to react.</p>

  <p>Although his body was astonishingly tough, the punch was still able to make a hole in his chest.</p>

  <p>In the Probability Extreme Form, the humanoid creature was able to throw tens of thousands of punches within two seconds. The heavy sword was rendered useless and had no way to protect Zheng.</p>

  <p>Crash! Bang!</p>

  <p>The humanoid creature's fists continuously landed on Zheng's body at lightning speed.</p>

  <p>Almost every part of Zheng's body was hit by his dreadful punches.</p>

  <p>Fist marks were soon imprinted on Zheng's body after it was beaten at the same spots countless times.</p>

  <p>Then, the people on the altar saw that Zheng's body was floating in the sky.</p>

  <p>An invisible creature seemed to be cruelly pounding him as if he was a mere sandbag.</p>

  <p>"What the hell's happening?"</p>

  <p>"Is that really Zheng?"</p>

  <p>"Why isn't he fighting back?"</p>

  <p>Several people got confused and worried at the sight of him being beaten continuously.</p>

  <p>However, they couldn't do anything but entrust this to Zheng. After all, it was a battle that they didn't even understand, not to mention get involved with it.</p>

  <p>Even the powerful Monkey Masters and Bird Masters couldn't do anything except watch and wait for the outcome of this battle.</p>

  <p>As Zheng was being thoroughly beaten down, the ancestry-level bloodline was left with no choice.</p>

  <p>It couldn't let Zheng be defeated like this, so it provided the heavy sword with energy again.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the sword emitted bright lights again, thus allowing Zheng to activate the Probability Extreme Form and Flame Extreme Form.</p>

  <p>Zheng swiftly moved along the thick black cloud and repeatedly slashed it using the sword, producing green clouds of fire. These flaming clouds instantly burned the black cloud and turned it into nothing.</p>

  <p>However, the humanoid creature still had no intention of fighting Zheng head-on. Just before the black cloud was vanquished, he quickly retreated and hid a place where the dark cloud didn't cover. He then stretched out his hand, and fist-sized bugs came rushing out from the back hole on his palm.</p>

  <p>Upon sensing the black bugs, the sword immediately manipulated Zheng again to kill them. The sword started wreaking havoc once more as if it had gone insane.</p>

  <p>"It's so annoying! This guy doesn't give me a chance to take a break at all!" Zheng shouted as he narrowed his eyes towards the humanoid creature.</p>

  <p>The humanoid being perceived Zheng's vexation and laughed grimly. "You can't fool me with your little tricks. Swear your loyalty to me before I completely pollute that sword's spirit. What do you think?" he offered.</p>

  <p>He obviously wanted to deal with the sword using his Soul Extreme Form.</p>

  <p>Once he succeeded, he would be able to keep the spirit of the sword under his absolute control.</p>

  <p>"You think I would agree to that nonsense? No way!" Zheng yelled coldly.</p>

  <p>"Well, you wasted your last chance, stupid human," the humanoid creature said in a disgruntled tone.</p>

  <p>As he stretched out his hand, more and more black bugs appeared and flew towards Zheng. All of them were slaughtered by the sword, mistaking them for the humanoid beings as it was still greatly affected by the Soul Extreme Form.</p>

  <p>Consequently, more and more white lights invaded the sword, making the sword's spirit break and lose its mind.</p>

  <p>As the humanoid creature witnessed this, his eyes flashed with thrill.</p>

  <p>"It's almost done. Soul Storm!" he declared in a booming voice.</p>

  <p>As the humanoid creature issued the order, a massive number of white lights immediately gathered and entered the sword.</p>
