<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't even bother to check his ranking.</p>

  <p>Not because he didn't want to fight for a good ranking in the Illusion Battlefield, but because the battle itself had just begun.</p>

  <p>He actually planned to get the best results. However, looking at the ranking this early wasn't something he would be anxious about.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng absorbed the Illusion Points, his gaze fell on the cave which was guarded by three Celestial Mice. He didn't know what was hidden inside the cave.</p>

  <p>He was already walking towards the cave's entrance when a light beam slowly formed before him and blocked his path.</p>

  <p>At the same time, some words flashed through Zheng's mind:</p>

  <p>"To enter the Evil Wind Cave, one has to pay three hundred thousand Illusion Points!"</p>

  <p>'Three hundred thousand Illusion Points!' Luo Zheng bitterly smiled at that thought.</p>

  <p>He had only collected less than four thousand Illusion Points so far.</p>

  <p>Thus, he needed to get more points for him to enter the cave.</p>

  <p>It was depressing for him that he couldn't enter it even after spending so much time and efforts fighting those mice. However, he had borne this place mentally as he couldn't help but wonder what was inside it. Not only was it guarded by three legendary beasts but it was also asking for three hundred thousand Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>Making up his mind, Luo Zheng didn't stay in that place any longer. He turned around and flew into the air, quickly returning along his original route.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh."</p>

  <p>After five minutes, the main city appeared once again in front of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>An ogre in silver armor was shrouded in a bloody Mu Ning right now. In his hands were a pair of massive bloody axes that were crazily brandished by him.</p>

  <p>This ogre warrior was Ezra, the same warrior that Luo Zheng encountered in the city before.</p>

  <p>Ezra had a privileged and wealthy background. Although he was not considered a core disciple of a tenth-grade sacred place, he was born in a wealthy, famous clan that was comparable to a tenth-grade sacred place.</p>

  <p>He had obtained his clan's most valuable treasure when the Illusion Battlefield opened.</p>

  <p>Not only did he put on the holy ogre armor, but he even took a pair of secondary first-rank divine weapons, the Ogre Blood Axes!</p>

  <p>He had spent the last few hours organizing a group of ogre warriors for killing all the other warriors from other races. He alone had slaughtered six hundred human warriors and about four hundred warriors from other races.</p>

  <p>In the first round alone, he had earned more than fifty thousand Illusion Points and his ranking in the Illusion Battlefield immediately soared to the top!</p>

  <p>He kept slaughtering the same warriors after they revived in the second round. The Illusion Points in a warrior's body were reduced by half whenever they died. With Ezra killing those warriors the second time, he obtained about twenty thousand points. Thus, he got a total of about seventy thousand points in just two rounds of massacre.</p>

  <p>Being a greedy warrior, Ezra initially wanted to slaughter those warriors for the third time but he could not get many points this way.</p>

  <p>Although the warriors in the Illusion Battlefield had understood the rules, they had never experienced it themselves. Thus, they didn't understand the rules too well.</p>

  <p>However, no one was a fool. After being killed once or twice, everyone finally understood what the battlefield rules were about. They, of course, would not be willing to be at the mercy of others.</p>

  <p>Death was nothing more than losing some Illusion Points. And those warriors didn't want others to keep on killing them like that. Besides, it was safe for them to just stay in the city. In this way, they could avoid giving Ezra another chance of killing them again.</p>

  <p>Not only the warriors who had been killed but also those ogre warriors who had helped Ezra began to come up with this thought.</p>

  <p>The warriors entered the Illusion Battlefield, either to fight for the ranking or to gain experience. Ezra might be very powerful and overbearing outside but it would be impossible for him to order others in the Illusion Battlefield. Even though some warriors and Ezra were from the same race, they should be enemies when standing in the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>Ezra could only look for his target by himself as of now, hoping to gain more Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>He was born in a prestigious clan and the clan's elders had high expectations on him. Naturally, he hoped to obtain a good result!</p>

  <p>However, he never expected himself as a target to several ogre warriors as soon as he stepped back in the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, Ezra took advantage of the fact that no one understood the rules and earned so many Illusion Points. Naturally, some people were jealous and wanted to kill Ezra to obtain about forty thousand Illusion Points at once.</p>

  <p>However, Ezra was powerful and his talent was great enough to become one of the core disciples of some sacred places!</p>

  <p>Moreover, he had great treasures in hand. Not only had he not been killed yet, but he had also killed five or six warriors more. He had earned a lot of points.</p>

  <p>"Roar... Look at you. Such a bunch of disgraceful warriors! I can cut down and kill all of you!" At this moment, Ezra had also activated his bloodline power, the Bronze Blood!</p>

  <p>The Bronze Blood was similar to the Berserk Blood of ogres. It could make a warrior forget his pain in a short period and double his strength.</p>

  <p>The warrior could become even more excited and brave! Nevertheless, the Bronze Blood was stronger than the Berserk Blood and had less damage to the warrior's body.</p>

  <p>Since the three ogre warriors dared to besiege Ezra, they were the aggressive warriors with evil intentions.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, the three of them could still suppress Ezra, but after Ezra's Bronze Blood was activated, he became more and more valiant.</p>

  <p>The three warriors began to retreat.</p>

  <p>"Puff!"</p>

  <p>The bloody axe hacked down onto one of the ogre warriors by chance, and directly split that warrior into two pieces!</p>

  <p>After the ogre warrior fell, he turned into a red dot of light that returned to the main city to revive. His Illusion Points were then naturally absorbed by Ezra.</p>

  <p>After seeing how Ezra killed one of them, the remaining two ogre warriors were suddenly eaten by fear. One of them even turned around to flee, wanting to return to the main city!</p>

  <p>However, with the activation of the Bronze Blood, Ezra would never let these two warriors escape.</p>

  <p>He howled and the mysterious marks appeared above the two bloody axes in his hands. After that, he threw the bloody axes towards the two ogre warriors.</p>

  <p>"Huff, huff, huff..."</p>

  <p>The two ogre warriors heard the sound of heavy objects flying behind them. Before they had the chance to turn around and look, the bloody axes had already turned into four, and eventually into countless bloody axes floating in the air!</p>

  <p>"I'll cut you into pieces!"</p>

  <p>With a roar from Ezra, the bloody axes rushed towards the two ogres at once.</p>

  <p>The bloody axes began hacking down the two ogre warriors as if countless people were holding them. The two ogre warriors were directly chopped into pieces by these axes.</p>

  <p>"Huff, huff, huff..."</p>

  <p>The bloody axes continued to merge, finally turning into two bloody axes and returning into Ezra's hands.</p>

  <p>The bloody axes in Ezra's hands were indeed regarded as the secondary first-rank divine weapons. Many warriors who were watching from above the city wall turned silent by their shocks.</p>

  <p>"The bloody axes... I thought they were just illusions!"</p>

  <p>"Humph, the strength of Ezra is quite average. He only relies on his clan's Bronze Blood and those two divine weapons!"</p>

  <p>"Since he has these two divine weapons in hand, his attacks are unmatched. Besides, he is invulnerable to swords and spears!"</p>

  <p>The strength displayed by Ezra was so formidable that the warriors inside the city didn't dare to leave the city.</p>

  <p>Ezra held two bloody axes and knocked the blunt part of it against his armored chest. Under the stimulation of the Bronze Blood, he roared towards the many warriors in the main city, "Idiots! Come out quickly and let me kill you! Other than contributing your Illusion Points, what else can you do?"</p>

  <p>It had to be said that Ezra was one of the smarter ones among the ogres.</p>

  <p>When he first entered the Illusion Battlefield, he was able to persuade the warriors from the same race to help him accumulate Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>However, he was still defiant even after accumulating enough points as he tried to provoke others. His provocation targets were not limited to the warriors from other races. In fact, all of those that he killed now were ogres!</p>

  <p>"Boaz! Go and challenge him!"</p>

  <p>"Damn it. I have helped him tie up so many human warriors before. How could he intend to kill me?"</p>

  <p>"Alas, this is the Illusion Battlefield and all of us have to take everyone as the opponent, regardless of race. We were so stupid to help him in the beginning!"</p>

  <p>"Bang, bang, bang..."</p>

  <p>Ezra's two bloody axes repeatedly smashed against his chest armor with a deafening sound. His eyes were dark red, but a trace of cyan gleam could be seen within. This was the effect of the Bronze Blood.</p>

  <p>Just as Ezra was provoking the other warriors excitedly, Zheng's figure suddenly appeared behind him.</p>
