<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Beneath the ripples lurked many grey scaled crocodiles.</p>

  <p>They were called Scaled Orange Teeth Crocodile. Their skin could be used to construct spiritual weapons. However, not a lot of warriors were willing to hunt and kill them.</p>

  <p>The reason behind it was that the Orange Teeth Crocodiles were too ferocious and their defensive power was immense. Even the warriors at the Internal Elixir Realm found it hard to kill them. Moreover, the reward for killing those creatures was only the skin that they had. That wasn't much for the warriors, so risking their lives couldn't have been worth it.</p>

  <p>At that moment, over a hundred Orange Teeth Crocodiles stealthily approached Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>To avoid getting discovered, he withdrew his life vitality and didn't even dare reveal his perception. That way, he wasn't able to take notice of the crocodiles as well.</p>

  <p>Both Luo Zheng and Mu Ning moved toward the flowing water, but the faint ripples got closer to them by the minute.</p>

  <p>"Crash!"</p>

  <p>An Orange Teeth Crocodile emerged from the water and went to Margaret's direction, opening its large mouth in an attempt to bite her.</p>

  <p>Those creatures were brilliant in camouflaging. If one didn't pay close attention, he could mistake it for a rotten wood floating on the water.</p>

  <p>What was worse was they could move very fast.</p>

  <p>Hearing the sudden splashing in the water from behind her, Mu Ning turned around and was welcomed by an enormous crocodile mouth. She stopped dead in her tracks. The crocodile near her had two rows of sharp, orange teeth that could leave marks even on an iron.</p>

  <p>Normally, the ordinary Internal Elixir Realm warriors weren't afraid of the Orange Teeth Crocodiles. However, Mu Ning was an exception as she didn't have any experience in training. She had no idea how to deal with this particular creature should she encounter one.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Zheng's figure appeared, lightly tapping on the surface of the water. Using his strength, he jumped over and directly stomped on the crocodile's lower jaw. The crocodile quickly moved its upper jaw to try to bite into Zheng's leg.</p>

  <p>With no hesitation, Luo Zheng punched the crocodile in its upper jaw.</p>

  <p>"Bam!"</p>

  <p>The forceful punch Luo Zheng threw tore the crocodile's mouth in an instant.</p>

  <p>Bright red blood spurted out and mixed right into the waters. Suffering from significant pain, the Orange Teeth Crocodile squirmed, causing waves of water everywhere.</p>

  <p>"Ah!"</p>

  <p>Mu Ning screamed. Six Orange Teeth Crocodiles appeared right beside her. Those creatures all seemed to agree that Mu Ning could make a sumptuous meal.</p>

  <p>Knitting his eyebrows, Luo Zheng couldn't help but be pissed about the situation.</p>

  <p>Those crocodiles didn't scare Luo Zheng at all. If they tried to eat him up as he just stood there, they couldn't swallow him whole. However, killing all six of them at the same time would take some strategizing. If he employed his life vitality, he could instantly kill the crocodiles, but he was also worried that Eddie might sense his life vitality waves then.</p>

  <p>In addition, fighting against these creatures could cause loud noises. The Dreamy Swampland was as tranquil as a cemetery. Even the slightest sound could spread into a distance.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no. We are probably in trouble!"</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng floated past, the life vitality within his body began to revolve slowly. Dragging Mu Ning who was very scared, Luo Zheng sprinted forward on the surface of the water.</p>

  <p>Naturally, the Orange Teeth Crocodiles weren't able to fly, so they weren't able to catch up with Luo Zheng and Mu Ning. When they reached the edge of the lagoon, Luo Zheng quickly withdrew his life vitality and then pushed Mu Ning to the side and said, "Leave this place right now!"</p>

  <p>At the same time, Simon, who was quietly floating in the air, smiled slyly and then said, "Very good. I've found you! Now Luo Zheng should be near the crocodile pond in the southeast region. Be careful of the crocodiles in the water!"</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!</p>

  <p>Upon hearing Simon's words, several warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm in the air immediately turned into a few beams of light and flew towards the southeast. They did not have any qualms as Luo Zheng and Mu Ning did, so they moved at great speed without trouble.</p>

  <p>With his growing intentions of killing both Luo Zheng and Mu Ning, Simon also dashed forward to the southeast pretty quickly.</p>

  <p>His goal at that time was to rush up to Luo Zheng earlier than others, especially Eddie.</p>

  <p>In less than five minutes, the Virtual Tribulation Realm warriors had already arrived at the lagoon where Luo Zheng and Mu Ning had just passed by.</p>

  <p>They found a dead Orange Teeth Crocodile floating on the water with its mouth split open.</p>

  <p>"Go after Luo Zheng! He might have just passed by this place!"</p>

  <p>"Killing Luo Zheng would be your greatest achievement and you shall be magnanimously rewarded by the Lord!"</p>

  <p>There were reasons why those independent warriors were so determined to follow and obey Eddie. One of the main reasons was the probability that Eddie's rewards were very generous, and when they all teamed up, there was at least the sense of belonging. No matter what happened, the divine kingdom could help them settle it.</p>

  <p>"Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh!"</p>

  <p>The several light beams scattered in several directions, searching the crevices of the place inch by inch for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>At that time, Luo Zheng and Mu Ning had already continued to advance deeper into the Dreamy Swampland. Suddenly, Luo Zheng felt waves of life vitality behind him. Then, a faint light flashed through the fog.</p>

  <p>"Get down!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shouted at Mu Ning, pulling her to hide in the grass.</p>

  <p>The beam of light was moving at an extremely high speed, and it swept past Zheng's head in just a blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>'He is a Virtual Tribulation Realm warrior, ' Luo Zheng thought. He guessed that Eddie had sent his men to hunt him down, which meant that there were more warriors in the Dreamy Swampland at that moment. In order to track him down, Eddie even stopped attacking the Ethereal Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng thought that Eddie indeed took him as a very powerful enemy.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng and Mu Ning lurked in the grass, the Virtual Tribulation Realm warrior didn't take notice of them. Luo Zheng had planned to leave with Mu Ning after the warrior had already gone away. Suddenly, a small spider quietly crawled along the grass towards Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>A ghost face could be seen on the spider's back. Encountering the ghost-faced spiders on the Cloud Road before, Luo Zheng knew that they weren't considered as threatening monsters.</p>

  <p>However, as the ghost-faced spider sprung up, it directly jumped onto Margaret's arm.</p>

  <p>Sensing that there was something on her arm, she raised it to look and was immediately shocked. Although she perfectly knew that she should not make any movements at that time, she was still unable to keep herself from letting out a sharp cry.</p>

  <p>"Ah!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's expression changed as he covered Margaret's mouth. The ghost-faced spider was crushed under Zheng's palm as he crushed it hard.</p>

  <p>The two of them tried to stay still in the grass.</p>

  <p>In all honesty, Luo Zheng wasn't threatened by the Virtual Tribulation Realm warrior. But he believed that when he took any action, his location could be revealed to the others, and Eddie could reach him sooner than later.</p>

  <p>The Virtual Tribulation Realm warrior left in rapid speed.</p>

  <p>He had already traveled over a mile after he flew past Zheng's head and when Mu Ning cried.</p>

  <p>A woman's shriek took him by surprise.</p>

  <p>A strange expression appeared on the Virtual Tribulation Realm warrior's face. After he thought for a moment while floating in the air, he changed his direction and flew back to where Luo Zheng and Mu Ning were.</p>

  <p>The warrior thought that the voice he was hearing was particularly sharp, resembling a woman's scream. A sound like that could easily ring throughout the swamp. The sound didn't last very long, so it made the warrior feel suspicious.</p>

  <p>It confused him whether it was a woman's voice or it was a bird's.</p>

  <p>Carefully, he decided to search around the area one more time.</p>

  <p>The Virtual Tribulation Realm warrior slowly floated in the air. He used his perception to check the ground bit by bit. After he rigorously searched through the swamp, he decided to check the grass again. At that time, he was getting closer and closer to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng stared at the approaching warrior floating in the air, he pressed Mu Ning firmly into him. His calm eyes showed a trace of pressure. If the warrior continued to be that meticulous, they could surely be discovered by him.</p>

  <p>'I hope you're lucky enough to fail to discover me here. Otherwise, you will be in great trouble, ' Luo Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>If the Virtual Tribulation Realm warrior discovered Luo Zheng, he had no other plans but to kill him.</p>

  <p>The warrior didn't have the slightest idea that approaching Luo Zheng meant approaching his death. In his eyes, Luo Zheng was only at the early stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm staying together with Mu Ning who was just an early-stage Internal Elixir Realm warrior. In that situation, the Virtual Tribulation Realm warrior believed that dealing with them both was a breeze. If he could catch Luo Zheng, it could be regarded as his most considerable contribution.</p>

  <p>Just like the sect, there was also competition among the divine kingdom's warriors. Being able to stand out among the other Virtual Tribulation Realm warriors gave more benefits especially when Eddie's divine kingdom became more powerful and influential.</p>

  <p>Five hundred feet...</p>

  <p>Three hundred feet...</p>

  <p>Two hundred feet...</p>

  <p>One hundred feet...</p>

  <p>The muscles all over Zheng's body tightened. At that specific distance, he didn't intend to use his life vitality. He knew that he could take down the enemy at once using his forceful energy.</p>
