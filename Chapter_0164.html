<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Although Zheng had read many books over the years and was familiar with the famous mountains and large rivers in Burning Sky Empire, he didn't know everything.</p>

  <p>These two places were strange to Zheng. He'd never heard of them.</p>

  <p>After meditating on it for a time, Zheng cautiously set the snow satin back in Weapon Refining Principle and then placed it in the space ring.</p>

  <p>There must be an invaluable treasure in the book, but if he wanted it, he would have to wait for a later date to find it.</p>

  <p>Right now, Zheng needed to continue preparing for the task of chopping demons.</p>

  <p>Zheng knocked a demon to pieces today, but since it was bounded and sealed, it had no strength to hit back.</p>

  <p>So, it only tested Zheng's courage.</p>

  <p>However, after descending the mountain, they would face real demons.</p>

  <p>Lately, Zheng worked hard to concentrate his strength and refine his vitality.</p>

  <p>Several days passed, and Aura listed the five outer disciples. Zheng was one of them.</p>

  <p>On the list, there were three outer disciples, Zheng, Henry, and Gury who was the third-ranked while the other two were hardly considered as outer disciples, who were a half-step in the nature level.</p>

  <p>After deciding which disciples, Aura wanted them to have several days to prepare.</p>

  <p>A few days later, five outer disciples and five inner disciples from Drizzle Peak met at the Bluesky Parking Ground.</p>

  <p>That day the Bluesky Parking Ground was crowded.</p>

  <p>Half were inner disciples dressed in black robes, and half were outer disciples wearing white robes.</p>

  <p>The ones able to pass the test of getting close to a demon might not be counted as the most powerful inner or outer disciples from each peak, but, it was sure they were the bravest who could control and even defeat their fear.</p>

  <p>In the middle of the Bluesky Parking Ground, a master was declaring the rules, giving the dos and don'ts for abolishing demons.</p>

  <p>Neither the outer nor the inner disciples could go to the Shura Battlefield to face the big demons on their own. With their current strengths, if they did, the disciples would be swallowed.</p>

  <p>On the other side of Shura Battlefield, there was a forest that bordered the empire called Sky Forest.</p>

  <p>The demon often sent demon scouts into the empire to scrutinize enemy status. Three hundred and thirty disciples total, from the thirty-three peaks of the Cloud Sect, were gathered to enter the Sky Forest and destroy the demon scouts.</p>

  <p>As the master finished, a giant flying chariot slowly landed.</p>

  <p>"Alright, everyone, this is it," said the master as he stepped to one side.</p>

  <p>Disciples began filing into the giant flying chariot one after another.</p>

  <p>Every action was prearranged, including the order with which they entered the flying chariot. They came single file according to their rank at Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>The first disciples to enter were from the Skytop Peak, the top-ranked peak of the thirty-three peaks at Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>Then, the disciples from the second-ranked peak, Blackrock entered...</p>

  <p>Followed by the disciples from the peak ranked third...</p>

  <p>...</p>

  <p>Drizzle Peak held the lowest rank, thirty-three, so, the disciples from there were the last to board.</p>

  <p>After the five inner disciples, Zheng, Henry, and others climbed into the giant flying chariot.</p>

  <p>Over three hundred disciples from the Cloud Sect were on the chariot.</p>

  <p>They glanced at each other, cautiously, with an indistinct look in their eyes.</p>

  <p>Zheng sat in a corner and closing his eyes, showed no interest in the rest of the recruits.</p>

  <p>His purpose for joining this trip was to face the trial and chop the demon.</p>

  <p>He didn't want any trouble.</p>

  <p>Zheng might not have wanted trouble, but, most of the time people were helpless to their situation, and someone planned to fix his wagon.</p>

  <p>After the giant flying chariot slowly rose into the sky and steadily set out, someone stepped onto the deck and approached Zheng.</p>

  <p>That person was dressed in a black robe. It was a man who wore his hair in many braids with a sharp dart dangling at the end of each little braid.</p>

  <p>"Say, aren't you Zheng?" asked the man who stood in front of Zheng.</p>

  <p>Everyone in the cabin turned, knowing they would more than likely see some sort of drama unfold.</p>

  <p>Zheng opened his eyes and blinked, slowly. He stared up at the man and asked, "Yes, what's up?"</p>

  <p>"My name is Yale Zhuge, and Fren is my elder brother. A few days ago, you insulted him. Today, I will take your life," stated the man casually, as if discussing the weather.</p>

  <p>An impatient expression spread across Zheng's face and he coldly asked,</p>

  <p>"Why didn't Fren come himself?"</p>

  <p>"You don't deserve to fight him," responded Yale Zhuge.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Zheng stood up laughing loudly. His laughter carried to every corner of the giant flying chariot.</p>

  <p>These were the bravest disciples from each of the Cloud Sect's peaks on the trip to chop the demon, so everyone was restrained.</p>

  <p>Although there was some interest among them, it was obscure. They didn't want to show off. After all, once they entered the Sky Forest, they had to cope with the demon, and it would be big trouble if they were bothered by others from another peak.</p>

  <p>However, here was Zheng, laughing recklessly and making the inner disciples frown.</p>

  <p>Henry wasn't far away and was thrilled as he thought, 'Zheng, this is the price for being arrogant. You have enemies everywhere. I think it will be hard for you to stay alive in Sky Forest.'</p>

  <p>Yale shouted angrily, "Why are you laughing? I'll slay you as easily as blinking! You are only a half-step into the nature level while I have the strength of grade-five nature level. You will die."</p>

  <p>"I'm laughing at the famous third young master of your family. Fren is a coward. Several times, he's asked others to get me in trouble, but as a result, there is no difference. He seeks death!" Zheng stressed coldly, "No more crap. You are just one of many people who want to kill me. It's better if more people join you first. I will deal with all of you at once to save trouble!"</p>

  <p>When Zheng laughed loudly, the disciples thought at first that he didn't know how to restrain himself.</p>

  <p>Now, they realized there was nothing to laugh at and this outer disciple, a half-step into the nature level, must be wildly arrogant.</p>

  <p>All the disciples from Cloud Sect had heard of Fren. He had the nickname, Fren the loony, but, he had the reputation of possessing powerful strength. What was more, even though he was wise, Fren was inconstant, and known as a cunning foe.</p>

  <p>It was unexpected to hear Zheng refer to him as a coward!</p>

  <p>Even though Fren wasn't there, Yale's strength wasn't lacking.</p>

  <p>At the grade-five nature level, Yale stood out amongst other inner disciples.</p>

  <p>His power was more than enough for him to deal with a disciple who was refining at a half-step into nature level.</p>

  <p>Yet, Zheng was fearless and so reckless that he dared to reproach Yale to his face while denouncing Fren...</p>

  <p>These people passed the test to get close to the demon and were the bravest, but they weren't on the same level as Zheng.</p>

  <p>Yale wasn't as eloquent as Fren and Zheng's words left him speechless. But his life vitality boiled, throughout his body. He stretched his hand out and pointed at Zheng, demanding, "How dare you, insult my brother? Are you courting death?"</p>

  <p>"Am I courting death? Haha, if I'm not courting death, will your family leave me alone? Will your brother stop harassing me? Since I'm courting death anyway, what does it matter if I curse him?" Zheng replied coldly.</p>

  <p>"Um...." trailed Yale, as his face turned scarlet that he apparently, wanted to fight on the giant flying chariot.</p>

  <p>Zheng calmly moved two steps, and his look of indifference changed to a sneer, and he stated, "If you want a fight, I'll accommodate you!"</p>

  <p>Just then, two other inner disciples walked up to Yale and put their hands on his shoulders while one said, "Fighting isn't permitted in here. If you destroy the flying chariot, you'll have big trouble. Kill him any way you like, as long as it's after we reach Sky Forest!"</p>

  <p>With the two disciples stepping in, Yale snorted at Zheng, calm enough now before heading back to his seat.</p>

  <p>Zheng influenced the demonic life energy in his body, forcing it back down into his lower torso.</p>

  <p>It would be an absolute lie to say he didn't feel the pressure when facing Yale, a powerful nature creature.</p>

  <p>Although it appeared Zheng feared nothing, in fact, he was in the state of vigilance. As long as Yale had the intention of killing him, Zheng would be ready to immediately strike back, even while they were in the giant flying chariot.</p>

  <p>Zheng had lit more than 100 dragon scales now and grasped the methods of the Heavenly Ogre Fist. His strength was at the peak, and so, now, he wanted to know what his limits were.</p>

  <p>After retaking his seat, Zheng closed his eyes and enjoyed the last hour of leisure flying.</p>

  <p>He knew as soon as they reached the Sky Forest, a bloody battle would begin.</p>
