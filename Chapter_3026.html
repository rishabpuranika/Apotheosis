<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>After drawing an arc in the sky, Zheng descended into the crowd and stood in front of a baby.</p>

  <p>The crowd rushed forward, bumping into Zheng. However, Zheng remained unmoved as he was as firm as a solid rock.</p>

  <p>Rumble!</p>

  <p>Just then, the ground below their feet suddenly trembled and collapsed while the huge vines emerged and rushed along the street. At that moment, hundreds of people were unfortunate enough to be crushed by the huge vines, turning them into a bloody mist.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, there was a blood bath on both sides of the street.</p>

  <p>Many of the divine citizens were not prepared for the sudden attack, leaving them with no time to run away from the threat. As a result, they were swallowed whole by the Man-eating Demon Flowers that were released by the vines.</p>

  <p>The corner of Zheng's eyes twitched at the sight of the chaos in front of him.</p>

  <p>Holding the baby he found in the street, he felt helpless as he could not do anything much to help the people at that moment.</p>

  <p>Just as the giant vines approached him, Zheng performed the Grand Teleportation. In an instant, a space wave flashed in front of him, making him disappear from his current position.</p>

  <p>The next minute, he found himself up in the sky just above the Seven-Star City, still carrying the baby in his arms.</p>

  <p>Soon after, he saw dozens of people clad in cyan appear in the sky above the city.</p>

  <p>These people emitting extraordinary auras were all powerful warriors at the Other Shore Realm led by no other than Laura and Ingram.</p>

  <p>Just after they appeared, they instantly turned into cyan lights and charged towards the six evil giant vines.</p>

  <p>"They must be the Stinger Guards."</p>

  <p>Shaking his head, Zheng thought that the guards should have acted sooner, and not now when most of the Seven-Star City had already been destroyed.</p>

  <p>Shortly after, Zheng went directly to the top of the mountain where Faegan, Jago, and the others were. Most of the disciples of the cultivation palaces gathered on the platforms opposite to the Lofty Sword.</p>

  <p>When Zheng and the baby landed on the platform, he immediately asked,</p>

  <p>"What happened? How were the Man-eating Demon Flowers from the Gracious Province able to invade this place?"</p>

  <p>Upon hearing Zheng's question, Faegan and the rest turned pale. In fact, very few monsters dared to enter and terrorize the Seven-Star Province under the Lofty Sword's protection. The monsters only braved to make trouble on the edge of the province.</p>

  <p>However, despite the Lofty Sword's protection, trouble still found the city.</p>

  <p>In fact, this was the first time for the disciples to see such a cruel scene in front of them. Even some of those who had reached the consummation of True God Realm trembled in nervousness.</p>

  <p>"It seems like someone has tampered with the Lofty Sword! It's not able to sense the invasion! What's worse is that it...it can't be activated now!"</p>

  <p>Faegan stammered in anxiety.</p>

  <p>The disciples were not aware of what was happening. All they knew was that the Qiu Clan and the Yuebai Clan were in big trouble.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Zheng took a glance at the Lofty Sword. Floating in the air, the officiant created a huge sword-like image from under his feet. "Why is this not working?" exclaimed the officiant as sweat formed on his forehead.</p>

  <p>It seemed that he was making the Lofty Sword work, but kept on failing after many attempts.</p>

  <p>"Who could be helping these monsters?" Zheng asked, frowning.</p>

  <p>"Well, who knows? Those nonhuman monsters are unpredictable," Faegan said sadly as if he had already lost all hope.</p>

  <p>Understanding the fact that the Man-eating Demon Flowers were hidden dangers in the Gracious Province, the Sword Light Palace had sent people to kill the demonic plants many times, but did not succeed for the demonic plants were too wise. Every time they were attacked, they would hide underground.</p>

  <p>In fact, the Sword Light Palace had exhausted their efforts in killing them, but somehow they never managed to wipe them out entirely. Fortunately, they had never gone too far, so the Sword Light Palace became laid-back with its efforts. After hiding for so many years, it was a surprise that the king of the Man-eating Demon Flowers had greatly improved its strength.</p>

  <p>And as of today, it was causing havoc and wreckage in the entire Seven-Star City.</p>

  <p>The attacks were quite strange. In fact, it seemed like an obvious premeditated plan. Why did the Man-eating Demon Flowers launch an attack when the Lofty Sword was tampered?</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, a loud voice echoed from above. "Officiant, forget the damn Lofty Sword! Let's work together and directly kill the king of Man-eating Demon Flowers! Although it has become stronger, we couldn't just let go without a fight. We still have a chance to defeat it with the help of the three elders!" spoke a man in cyan who was in his middle age. He had a square face with a chiseled jaw which gave off an awe-inspiring aura. As the voice trailed off, three more people flew over from a distance.</p>

  <p>They stood behind the middle-aged man.</p>

  <p>Observing the middle-aged man, Zheng could not help but size him up as he looked at him from head to toe. While Zheng's heart skipped a beat, he said,</p>

  <p>"Wow, they are so strong."</p>

  <p>The Sword Light Palace was a place with quite a few strong warriors at the Other Shore Realm. But up until now, Laura and the officiant were regarded as the two most powerful. Even though Ingram was recognized as a five-star Stinger Guard, he was still much weaker than Leopold.</p>

  <p>The middle-aged man in cyan, along with the other three elders, had the similar majestic aura as Leyton.</p>

  <p>"Father!"</p>

  <p>Faegan greeted the man in cyan. It was his father, Reynald Qiu, the current leader of the Sword Light Palace.</p>

  <p>But at that critical moment, Reynald only cast a quick glance at his son, Faegan, and then ignored him.</p>

  <p>Turning a deaf ear to Reynald's words, the officiant waved his hands. Soon, numerous little swords materialized and rushed into the Lofty Sword's body.</p>

  <p>Shortly after, a ray of light aroused from the bottom of the Lofty Sword with lines rushing up along its edge. At this moment, it seemed that the sword had finally come back to life.</p>

  <p>"Not to worry. After repairing the Lofty Sword, I will definitely chop these damn demonic plants into shreds!" The officiant smiled from ear to ear.</p>

  <p>However, Reynald was not so happy about it as he frowned slightly.</p>

  <p>Flying behind the officiant, he said, "That's impressive. You have repaired the Lofty Sword in such a short time."</p>

  <p>Nodding, the officiant replied cautiously, "It's likely that someone has quietly placed some bugs in the Lofty Sword. They destroyed several of its magic arrays. But not to worry for I've already restored the arrays. The Lofty Sword is heavily guarded, so I think the person who placed the bugs is probably one of us. There must be a mole in the Sword Light Palace."</p>

  <p>"A mole? How could that be?" Reynald smiled as he repeated the question in a peculiar voice.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the officiant sensed that there was something wrong about Reynald. Turning around, he saw Reynald's eyes. Taken aback, the officiant exclaimed, "Master Reynald, you..."</p>

  <p>But before the officiant could react, a long red sword had already pierced through his chest.</p>

  <p>Soon, a blood-red evil fire emerged from where he was pierced and instantly swallowed him whole. In a flash, his body had been completely burnt to ashes.</p>

  <p>"Reynald!"</p>

  <p>"What on earth are you doing, Master Reynald?"</p>

  <p>Up in the air, two old men could not help but cover their mouths in shock.</p>

  <p>Never had they thought that Reynald would kill the officiant.</p>

  <p>"Haha! Ibrahim, let's start!" After killing the officiant, it seemed that Reynald had already taken care of his problem.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the third old man let out a loud and hideous laugh. Soon, his skin quickly cracked, revealing a muscular body.</p>
