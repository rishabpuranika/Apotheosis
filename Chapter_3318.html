  <p>
</p>

  <p>When the black monkey finished its words, the other two also wore cautious expressions on their faces.</p>

  <p>No matter how ruthless the purified being was, he wouldn't have killed his own race. It made no sense and caused an uneasy feeling in their hearts.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps the purified being... is not a pig-faced monster after all..." another black monkey spoke and voiced its speculations out loud.</p>

  <p>"I can't say for sure though," the black monkey shook its head in an attempt to diffuse the suspicions.</p>

  <p>"It seems we were right to come here to have a look for ourselves!"</p>

  <p>Just as the three black monkeys were immersed in their discussion, several thousand feet away from them, a few red dots of light appeared. Several one-eyed monsters perched atop another mountain scanned the area ahead of them.</p>

  <p>"Buzz, buzz..."</p>

  <p>Obviously, the several one-eyed creatures had noticed the presence of the black monkeys as well. Their eyes gleamed with a particular frequency that indicated friendliness.</p>

  <p>These one-eyed creatures belonged to a different force and had never encountered the black monkeys before. Apparently, they were also enchanted by the frightening light column.</p>

  <p>As a sign of friendship, the black monkeys waved gently at the one-eyed monsters. Then, they moved down from the peak of the mountain.</p>

  <p>Besides the black monkeys and the one-eyed monsters, other creatures were lurking nearby in the Dark Region. They were all sneaking up to the area inhabited by the pig-faced monsters.</p>

  <p>Even though the entire valley now stood destroyed, Zheng was still able to tell the right direction.</p>

  <p>As long as they followed the mountain stream, they should be able to retrace their steps. They had to climb the back wall of the Grand Sky Temple at the end of the stream to leave the Dark Region safely.</p>

  <p>Now with Feng Ge's strength, those black monkeys wouldn't dare to make trouble for them.</p>

  <p>"Before we leave the Dark Region, I'll store this in your space ring." Zheng glanced at Feng Ge as he pointed at the small Regal Jade Beast.</p>

  <p>"Space ring? I don't understand what you mean..." Feng Ge asked while peering over at Zheng with curious eyes.</p>

  <p>Due to the fact that her memory had almost been wiped clean, she had aged back a few years mentally. She now resembled a child at the age of seven. It made her look innocent and adorable.</p>

  <p>"Try to remember what it is yourself," Zheng said impatiently.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge thought long and hard as she blinked at him. Then, she raised her hand and asked, "Is this what you are talking about?"</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>As a white square formed in response to her gesture, a space ring emerged in her hand.</p>

  <p>Clatter...</p>

  <p>Before Zheng could react, Darkness Fruits, candles, soul pills, and a pile of Other Shore Tokens came pouring out from her space ring.</p>

  <p>"Wow! So many things to play with!"</p>

  <p>Overjoyed by the innumerable objects, Feng Ge began to clap her hands in excitement. She grabbed a handful of soul pills and started to play with them.</p>

  <p>Zheng pursed his lips before he grabbed her hand and stuffed everything back in the space ring. Then, he turned to her and said in a stern voice, "We do not have time for this! You can play to your heart's content after we leave the Dark Region."</p>

  <p>"Okay, I'm sorry…" Feng Ge nodded obediently but wore a pouty expression when she turned her face away.</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng proceeded to store the little Regal Jade Beast into the space ring, Feng Ge glanced at it, and her expression suddenly switched. Strange darkness hovered over her eyes before she said, "I can't leave the Dark Region."</p>

  <p>Hearing her unexpected confession, Zheng felt slightly stunned. He raised his brows and asked, "What do you mean you can't leave?"</p>

  <p>"I have something very important that I must do…" After she finished her words, she turned in the opposite direction and ran at a surprisingly fast speed.</p>

  <p>'What does she mean by that? What could be so important for her to leave like this?' Zheng muttered to himself as he gazed at her receding figure.</p>

  <p>But now, when Feng Ge was in a state where she could not remember anything clearly, Zheng had no other choice but to go after her.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Feng Ge was dressed in a robe woven by light. It made it easy for him to keep track of her in the dark.</p>

  <p>Due to her eye-catching robe, she was easy to be spotted by the creatures lurking in the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>The three black monkeys were stationed in some secluded area in the darkness. The yellow pieces of paper on their bodies emitted a distinct aura.</p>

  <p>This aura could keep their figures hidden, making them hard to be detected through the naked eye.</p>

  <p>"That's a purified being!"</p>

  <p>"It's a...hu...human?"</p>

  <p>"How is that possible..."</p>

  <p>The three black monkeys felt collectively puzzled at this sight.</p>

  <p>Instinctively, they had pinned the purified being to be Teague. But when they saw it was Feng Ge, the human girl, they were in a state of shock.</p>

  <p>Aside from the black monkeys, other creatures scattered in other places also shared the same puzzled expression. God knew what had happened to the pig-faced monsters.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Feng Ge continued to advance with quick steps. She was moving so fast that Zheng struggled to keep up with her pace. Fortunately, she did not go too far and abruptly stopped in place. She just stood there and stared blankly ahead into space.</p>

  <p>When Zheng walked over to her side, he found out that Feng Ge was standing in front of the black pool!</p>

  <p>"It's the black pool..."</p>

  <p>Zheng stared at the black quagmire and felt his heart sink as he recalled his past experience here. Although the Regal Jade Bugs didn't take his life, that horrible scene alone was enough for him to remember for a lifetime.</p>

  <p>After Feng Ge unleashed the light column, the surrounding mountains were reduced to the ground. However, the black pool remained intact.</p>

  <p>'Feng Ge doesn't know about the existence of the black pool. She has been muttering about something important that she needs to do. Since she came here, the recollection about the black pool might not be hers, but Teague's.'</p>

  <p>Zheng concluded as he studied Feng Ge's figure.</p>

  <p>The important thing Feng Ge mentioned must be concerned with Teague, and that was why it was engraved in her mind.</p>

  <p>It soon became clear the black pool was by no means just a place to provide the octopuses with food. There was more to it than met the eye...</p>

  <p>"Feng Ge, what is it that is so important to you?" Zheng inquired as he glanced in her direction.</p>

  <p>As if possessed, Feng Ge kept her gaze steady at the black pool and replied,</p>

  <p>"I must go in..."</p>

  <p>"Look, don't rush into things. There is a kind of deadly poisonous bug in the black pool. If you go in blindly, I'm worried that..."</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng tried to persuade her out of doing this, she jumped down into the black pool with a plop. Without a hint of hesitation, she had dived down towards the bottom.</p>

  <p>"Elvina, wait!"</p>

  <p>Although Feng Ge's physical body was not to be underestimated, it still wouldn't be able to withstand the poison of the Regal Jade Bugs. Left with no other choice, Zheng dived in the black pool to follow after her.</p>

  <p>After Zheng jumped, he struggled to make sense of his surroundings. The mud was so thick that it became hard for him to move further down.</p>

  <p>In a moment of desperation, he grabbed onto Feng Ge's feet and was dragged down by her.</p>

  <p>One hundred feet....</p>

  <p>Three hundred feet...</p>

  <p>One thousand feet...</p>

  <p>Previously when the octopuses threw Zheng into the black pool, he had only covered a distance of a few hundred feet. At that time, Zheng was convinced he had reached the bottom of the black pool.</p>

  <p>But now, dragged by Feng Ge, he had gone further down, and she still didn't stop. It seemed the black pool was much deeper than he had thought.</p>

  <p>Along the way, Zheng had been worried that they would encounter the Regal Jade Bugs or the Regal Jade Beasts. But none of them showed up.</p>

  <p>After diving for more than ten thousand feet, Feng Ge suddenly stopped. Zheng reached out his hand to touch the bottom of the black pool. The bottom was abnormally chilling and smooth. The feeling resembled when he felt the Regal Jade Beast.</p>

  <p>"What the hell is this? Damn it, I can't see anything..."</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng tried to figure it out, a ball of white blinding light appeared beside him. The moment the light shone, it completely wiped off the black mud stationed at the bottom.</p>

  <p>However, when the black mud at the bottom of the pool had vanished, the residue floating above naturally settled back down. Since Feng Ge had relied on her ability to continuously release rays of light, she forcefully created a temporary space at the bottom of the black pool.</p>
