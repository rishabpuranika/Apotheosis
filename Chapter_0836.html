<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Actually, the easiest way for Luo Luo Zheng to proceed right now was to open the door and walk out.</p>

  <p>Although in the dark, warriors were often assassinated even in the safe zone, on the surface, no race would dare to do such a thing.</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng was able to leave the practice room, the ogres would not be able to protect this assassin. In fact, the assassin's mission should already have been completed at this time. And it didn't matter whether he succeeded in assassinating Luo Luo Zheng or not, because he was already a dead man.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you afraid?" Luo Luo Zheng suddenly asked.</p>

  <p>"Afraid of what?" The Night Group assassin's shrill voice sounded.</p>

  <p>"I am pretty sure you know that with your current strength level, you won't be able to assassinate me. What's more, in this narrow space, you are an even weaker match for me and will surely lose," Luo Luo Zheng replied with a faint smile playing on his lips.</p>

  <p>The assassin's face darkened. A trace of despair flashed across his small eyes. "If what you said is true, and since I am an expendable soldier they have trained, then it means that whether I succeed or not, I will die."</p>

  <p>"They? Are you referring to the ogres?" Luo Luo Zheng asked with a smile, gently turning his body to face the assassin.</p>

  <p>The assassin didn't reply. In the kind of situation he was facing right now, it was meaningless for him to admit who his employers were. He didn't give up though. Instead, he prepared his strongest attack. The bone blade started to shine in his hand with a bewitching red light.</p>

  <p>Any counterattack brewed from life essence was extremely powerful. The assassin had already wasted a perfect opportunity to assassinate Luo Luo Zheng, so he would have to use his life for a second chance.</p>

  <p>Seeing that the assassin was keeping silent, Luo Luo Zheng continued, "I think we can make a deal."</p>

  <p>"What kind of deal?" The assassin asked in a curious voice.</p>

  <p>"Teach me your secret hiding technique, and I will let you go." The technique that the Night Group employed for hiding was very special. Not only did it prevent others from sensing the presence of the user, but it also allowed one to become temporarily invisible. Luo Luo Zheng was deeply interested in it and wanted to learn how.</p>

  <p>The assassin's eyes seemed to reveal an excited look for a moment.</p>

  <p>After all, he was a mere expendable soldier. Ever since he became an assassin, he had been constantly instilled with the idea of sacrificing his life for the Night Group. However, the desire to survive was very deeply imprinted in the bones of quite a lot of creatures, and some of them would obviously go to extreme lengths to survive. Even expendable soldiers were known to often cower before their death. However, such hesitation usually came too late for them to have a choice of continued life.</p>

  <p>It would have been an entirely different case if the assassin had been killed by Luo Luo Zheng in one hit after he failed to complete his mission, but Luo Luo Zheng was giving him a chance to live. It was like a drowning man had caught on to a lifeboat.</p>

  <p>"Teach me the technique you guys employ for hiding and I'll spare your life.</p>

  <p>What do you think?" Luo Luo Zheng asked again.</p>

  <p>The assassin's eyes flashed. It was a secret technique that only the Night Group possessed. Until now, not a single other race had managed to grasp it. The assassin's expression changed.</p>

  <p>He slowly came away from the wall and calmly asked, "Are you really willing to let me go?"</p>

  <p>"Killing you won't do me any good," Luo Luo Zheng answered faintly.</p>

  <p>The assassin pondered for a moment before he slowly walked towards Luo Luo Zheng and replied, "I really want to agree to your request. Unfortunately, other than the Night Group, there is no one can grasp that technique. So you have to die."</p>

  <p>As soon as his voice was lost to its echoes, the assassin once again launched an attack.</p>

  <p>Thick black smoke suddenly erupted from his body, and ten shadows came out from that illusion. As soon as these ten shadows appeared, they charged towards Luo Luo Zheng from several directions.</p>

  <p>A sneer appeared on Luo Zheng's face as a green light flashed in his eyes. After the sap from the divine tree had washed his eyes, he was able to see through most common illusions. The flash in his eyes was actually a way for him to sense where the real assassin was standing.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng took a single step forward, and somehow, his body traveled several feet through space to appear beside the assassin. "I offered you one chance.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, you did not take it!"</p>

  <p>With that, Luo Luo Zheng punched out and a strange flush appeared on the assassin's face. It looked like he wanted to say something, but before he could open his mouth, Luo Zheng's fist had already pierced through his chest.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>The assassin spat out an enormous amount of blood. He had been hit by a blow from Luo Luo Zheng and was thrown on the wall of the room. The scarlet blood he spat out painted an abstract picture on the wall as his eyes got filled with an unwilling expression.</p>

  <p>Actually, the assassin had really wanted to agree to Luo Zheng's request.</p>

  <p>However, he was an expendable soldier, and his entire clansmen were in the hands of the ogres, who were his master. If he retreated from his job today, his clansmen were going to face the ogre's wrath and be killed.</p>

  <p>This was the cruel world of martial artists. Some paths, once chosen, left no room for retreat.</p>

  <p>Looking at the bloodstains on the wall, Luo Luo Zheng shook his head and sighed. He might not have been able to figure out the reason, but he understood that the ogres had something really big on the assassin, which was why he had not agreed to his proposal.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng found nothing from the assassin's body, so he left it there in the room.</p>

  <p>Before long, it would be slowly devoured by the Tower of Sin, and not a trace of it would be left in this world.</p>

  <p>An ogre was hiding in a corner, staring at the room that Luo Luo Zheng had rented.</p>

  <p>A long time had passed, but for some unknown reason, its door was still closed.</p>

  <p>Judging by the Night Group assassins' skills, it would have taken only five minutes to assassinate a human war fighter. But several hours had already passed. Why was the door still closed?</p>

  <p>Had the assassin failed?</p>

  <p>The ogre did not dare to leave. He kept staring at the door firmly.</p>

  <p>Several hours later, the door to the room finally opened. A figure rushed out like a ghost, but soon disappeared into the distance right in front of the ogre.</p>

  <p>"Huh?" While the ogre was puzzled, a voice suddenly sounded from behind him.</p>

  <p>"Still waiting for someone?" Luo Luo Zheng looked at the ogre with a meaningful smile.</p>

  <p>The ogre turned towards him, completely at a loss for words. After quite a long time, he stammered, "You, you... I don't know you!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng wore a smile as he shook his head at the ogre. "Of course you don't know me. But I want you to pass on a message to your superiors and friends. Tell them, you ogres are cowardly. There are plenty of opportunities to kill me on the arena, but you chose this way?"</p>

  <p>"We are not cowards!" The ogres always took pride in their bravery, and this particular warrior had not expected to hear such an insult from a lowly human.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng waved his hand. A slight smile appeared on his face as he turned around and left. Indeed, he did not have much to say to this stupid race.</p>

  <p>It took Luo Luo Zheng only three days to advance to the third floor. After that, he didn't encounter any obstacles on the fourth and fifth floors either. Other than a reckless giant who challenged him and died miserably, no one dared to challenge him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng advanced smoothly in this way. After passing the fifth floor, there were no more war fighters on the sixth floor, and almost all his opponents were war generals.</p>

  <p>However, the war generals on the sixth floor were low in cultivation.</p>

  <p>Almost all of them were first and second level war generals. Only very few lever three war generals were present.</p>

  <p>The Tower of Sin was a microcosm of the whole Sea God Continent. The higher one's cultivation was, the higher his position would be. Every floor of the tower worked day and night according to the rules. If one was strong enough to obtain the Lucky Light, then his cultivation would quickly increase. The weaker ones would either stay stagnant at a certain floor and make no progress, or become stepping stones for other warriors.</p>

  <p>From the sixth floor onwards, more and more war generals dared to challenge Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Although many living creatures had come to know that Luo Zheng's strength was not ordinary, most war generals were unconvinced when they found out Luo Zheng's cultivation level and his race. How could a human war fighter reach the sixth floor?</p>

  <p>Some radical war generals walked onto the arena.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng used his fist to tell them what he had relied on to get to the sixth floor.</p>

  <p>There were many opponents who chose to challenge Luo Luo Zheng, so it became increasingly difficult for him to obtain a default victory. He fought a total of seven matches and killed six creatures on the sixth floor, letting a human war fighter go. Seven days later, the creatures that had just become war generals finally understood that they could not stop Luo Luo Zheng. In the next three days, Luo Luo Zheng won the three required default victories, so he advanced to the seventh floor smoothly.</p>

  <p>Ever since he had reached the sixth floor, he had gained more and more Lucky Light. After reaching the seventh floor, he once again entered the practice room to improve his cultivation level. He had accumulated quite a lot of Lucky Light this time. After refining the Lucky Light, Luo Luo Zheng was able to enhance his cultivation directly from the 8th level to the 10th level!</p>

  <p>He was now only one step away from becoming a war general!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was looking forward to becoming a war general. If his cultivation reached the war general level, then he would be able to fight against the new war lords with his physical body. He was eager to show off his Transcendent Divine Might and Stellar Body.</p>
