<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 680 Ning Yudie‘s Little Secret (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Do you know the cultivation levels of the others who attend it?" Ning Yudie asked him again.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng thought for a moment before shaking his head. "I really don't."</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie gave him a bitter smile, also shaking her head. "You don't even know how the others are situated, yet you plan on attending the Martial Arts Contest? The warriors who take part in the contest could be at any level below the late stage of the Internal Elixir Realm. They are elite disciples cultivated by old geezers of level four or five sects! Are you certain you can fight them? With you being at the third level of the Illuminating Soul Realm?</p>

  <p>You are not strong like Blake, Benson, and some other disciples of Cloud Hall. You're not even in the running.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the candidates attending the contest have already been chosen. If you wish to attend it, you have to attend it as an independent warrior and get the qualification by yourself.</p>

  <p>If you like the idea of getting yourself killed in the process, I won't stop you," Ning Yudie spouted out, her words a firm warning. Luo Zheng grew silent.</p>

  <p>"I must attend the Martial Arts Contest," he said as she looked at him coldly. "I must obtain the Dragon Soar Arena, and Marilyn must die!"</p>

  <p>Making this announcement, Luo Zheng turned around and left without bidding them goodbye.</p>

  <p>"You!" Ning Yudie had previously planned to warn Luo Zheng not to attend the Martial Arts Contest, because she knew he would probably die otherwise. But Zheng's short speech had not given her any leeway to fully convince him.</p>

  <p>However, the old lady, Yudie's master, smiled appreciatively. She had lived for long and was very experienced. She had been angry that Luo Zheng blamed Ning Yudie. Being a warrior, Luo Zheng must know when to admit to his responsibilities.</p>

  <p>"You are not allowed to leave!" Ning Yudie outstretched her hand as she rebuilt the enchanted barrier. She had been back at the beginning level of the Virtual Tribulation Realm. It was easy for her to stop Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>But at the same time, Zheng's body started to shake. He looked like a ghost; like a rippling figure under water. As he shook, he got past the enhanced barrier that Ning Yudie had made with no scruples, as if it did not exist at all!</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie and the old lady could not believe their eyes. It seemed incredible!</p>

  <p>They wondered if there was something wrong with their visions. What just happened?</p>

  <p>One couldn't deny Yudie's cultivation base. She was at the beginning level of the Virtual Tribulation Realm!</p>

  <p>Besides, she had sacrificed her cultivation strength nine times now, and her power was far greater compared to ordinary warriors who were at the beginning level of the same realm. Her enchanted barrier was exceptionally strong, but just now Luo Zheng passed it so smoothly, as if it wasn't present before him at all. What on earth did he just do to surpass that?</p>

  <p>"If my eyes serve me correctly, Luo Zheng seemed to utilize the strength of the Space Law. Also... he seems to have learned that Law quite well. Even Saint Morphens, is not able to perform as well as Luo Zheng," the old lady said, recovering first. She shook her head disbelievingly.</p>

  <p>Morphens had learned the Space Rules like few others could. However, he could use his Mystical Pace in the weak space, which was entirely different from what Luo Zheng did. Luo Zheng passed Tia's enchanted barrier with ease. It seemed that Luo Zheng didn't do anything fancy, but his moving skills themselves contained a profound understanding of the Space Rule.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie wanted to catch up to Luo Zheng. But the old lady, her mentor, was still here. She hesitated, trying to hold herself back.</p>

  <p>"That young boy... is unusual. If he insists on attending the Martial Arts Contest, just let him go," the old lady said calmly. She threw Ning Yudie a meaningful look. "Which brings me to my next question. Tell me, why did you stop him from attending the Martial Arts Contest? I'm curious."</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie blinked, answering, "No matter what Luo Zheng has done, he is a disciple of Cloud Hall. I would feel tremendously guilty if he is killed!"</p>

  <p>"Is that right? If so, then what about the others? Aren't Blake, Benson, and the others disciples of our Cloud Hall too? If he feared death, he shouldn't have started to cultivate the martial arts in the beginning." A smile lingered in the old lay's opalescent eyes as she finished her words.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you mean, master," Ning Yudie spluttered, still acting the naive little girl.</p>

  <p>The old lady sighed, her expression becoming grave. She had lived for so long. How could she not see what was blooming between Ning Yudie and Luo Zheng?</p>

  <p>The way Ning Yudie talked to Luo Zheng was so different from how she reacted to others. She did not behave like she was the rightful head of the Cloud Hall at all! How could her master not put two and two together then? She knew the secret Ning Yudie was harboring.</p>

  <p>The old lady knew that Ning Yudie and Luo Zheng had gone through something together at the Cloud Road, however, she did not know exactly what had occurred. It did not matter, in any case. As long as Luo Zheng continued to have breakthroughs and could be powerful enough, she wouldn't mind marrying Tia off to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>As per her point of view, Luo Zheng truly was a rare genius. His potential was as great as Tia's. For the sake of his cultivation, using up all the resources at Cloud Hall would be worth it.</p>

  <p>It was a pity that Luo Zheng was too weak right now. Not all geniuses got the chance to grow without a spanner in the works. Luo Zheng expected to kill Marilyn and declared a war against Eddie Cui in the process. It wasn't certain that Luo Zheng would survive the Martial Arts Contest at all.</p>
