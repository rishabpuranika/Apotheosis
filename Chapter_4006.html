<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Upon seeing that the colorful bolts of lightning were coming down to envelop him, Luo Zheng suddenly stopped on his tracks and evaded the lightning cage. Then, he leaped and landed on the transparent sphere.</p>

  <p>Through Luo Zheng's eyes, the Treacherous Being intently looked inside the transparent sphere.</p>

  <p>Les, who was inside, clearly saw Luo Zheng's face on the surface of the sphere.</p>

  <p>The sight was quite strange to him as he saw Luo Zheng stared at him with only the white of his eyes.</p>

  <p>It was kind of creepy since Luo Zheng's face didn't contain any shred of emotion as he stared and tried to pry inside Les's mind.</p>

  <p>A sense of discomfort quickly rose from Les's heart, which was caused by the unique aura of the Treacherous Being. However, at this moment, Les still didn't know that Luo Zheng's body was being possessed.</p>

  <p>"Fuck off, you creepy bastard!"</p>

  <p>Les immediately stretched out his hand and gathered his energy on the surface of the sphere.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>A bolt of lightning burst out from the spot where Luo Zheng was attached. The power of the lightning was enough to pierce through him and send him into the air.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng's body was extremely agile, like a nimble monkey. He easily dodged the lightning and leaped to the other side of the sphere. He landed and clung to the surface with both his hands and feet, and started staring at Les again with his white eyes.</p>

  <p>At this point, Luo Zheng knew that the Treacherous Being seemed to be very interested in Les.</p>

  <p>"I said fuck off!"</p>

  <p>Les stretched out his hand again and released another streak of lightning on the surface of the sphere.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng still avoided his attack with ease and flew back.</p>

  <p>Crack! Boom!</p>

  <p>Les tried to drive Luo Zheng off several times, but he failed miserably.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>Finally, he got totally impatient so he wrapped the entire transparent sphere with the colorful lightning. With this, Luo Zheng would have no choice but to separate himself from the sphere.</p>

  <p>However, the Treacherous Being still manipulated Luo Zheng's body to cling onto the sphere.</p>

  <p>The moment Luo Zheng's hands and feet landed on the sphere, the colorful lightning enveloping it immediately burned them.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's current physical body had been strengthened by the ancestry-level bloodline, thus ordinary methods could not easily hurt him. However, Les's skills were superb and couldn't be underestimated.</p>

  <p>The Treacherous Being looked at the burnt hands and feet of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>As it realized that the body it was possessing was injured, it decided to use its own body to wrap around the injured parts.</p>

  <p>However, even before the Treacherous Being could make its move, round blisters suddenly appeared on the surface of Luo Zheng's burnt hands and feet.</p>

  <p>After the blisters were broken, a green liquid flowed out from them. Then, the liquid entered through the burnt parts and quickly healed them. As they fully recovered, Luo Zheng's hands and feet revealed a faint metallic color.</p>

  <p>The colorful lightning hit Luo Zheng's metal hands and feet again, but this time, it could no longer damage him.</p>

  <p>For the first time, Luo Zheng's manipulated body revealed a strange expression in his white eyes.</p>

  <p>The Treacherous Being inside his body was just acting according it subconscious.</p>

  <p>It meant that all this time, its consciousness had not been completely awakened.</p>

  <p>With just its instinct, the Treacherous Being knew where it needed to go. It also discerned that it had to repel all the creatures that would try to hinder it. However, it still couldn't remember who it really was and what its true goal and purpose were.</p>

  <p>But now that the Treacherous Being had begun to show its expressions, the Primeval Lord of Heaven and Luo Zheng were surprised.</p>

  <p>Previously, the ancestry-level bloodline stopped working as if it was dead.</p>

  <p>It was also unwilling to drive the Treacherous Being out of Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>However, when his body suffered fatal damages, it immediately repaired them.</p>

  <p>"I've been thinking about this for a while now. It seems that the Treacherous Being is very interested in Les," Luo Zheng told the Primeval Lord of Heaven.</p>

  <p>"Indeed. I noticed that too," the Primeval Lord of Heaven replied.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the Treacherous Being still controlled Luo Zheng's body to cling onto the surface of the transparent sphere, and no one knew what it was really up to.</p>

  <p>Now, the Treacherous Being had grown impatient. It thought that just spying wasn't enough to quench its interest for Les. Thus, it quickly controlled Luo Zheng's body and threw a punch on the sphere.</p>

  <p>If it wanted to kill Les, it had to break the transparent sphere first to get to him.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The strength of the punch was massive. However, the sphere was only slightly shaken and was able to easily repel his punch.</p>

  <p>Crash!</p>

  <p>With that, the Treacherous Being threw another massive punch.</p>

  <p>This time, the punch came directly from above, like meteor that crashed from the sky. The impact didn't destroy the sphere, but it was strong enough to instantly embed it into the ground.</p>

  <p>As Les found that he was stuck on the ground, his face was quickly filled with rage. He did not expect that a mere human could do this to him.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's body seemed to have gone insane. He wreaked havoc by continuously throwing massive punches towards the transparent sphere of light.</p>

  <p>Inside the sphere, there was a cubic gray stone, the size of a thumb, hanging just beside Les's body. Every time Luo Zheng smashed the sphere, the gray stone would flash a faint luster.</p>

  <p>Apparently, the energy of the transparent sphere came from this stone. Once all the energy of the stone was exhausted, the sphere would also collapse.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Claire and Slade had been quietly watching this scene.</p>

  <p>Slade was constantly shaking his head since he saw that Les couldn't even hit Luo Zheng with his lightning. But now that Luo Zheng seemed to have been overpowering Les, he had enough.</p>

  <p>"This is ridiculous. Les has underestimated the enemy," said Slade.</p>

  <p>"Well, I already expected this. He's always like this, so full of himself,"</p>

  <p>Claire said with a subtle smile on her face.</p>

  <p>"His enemy is just a mere human. How could he be overwhelmed like that?</p>

  <p>What a loser! I want to replace him," Slade demanded.</p>

  <p>Before, whenever Slade would speak, there would be no emotion involved because there were many members of the Element Spirit race that dwelled within his body. Every word that he would say was agreed upon by the collective consciousness of the members of the Element Spirit race.</p>

  <p>But now, his way of speaking had totally changed. Obviously, there was a lone member of the Element Spirit race that was speaking these words.</p>

  <p>"Is that you, Gavyn?" Claire smiled as she noticed it immediately.</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately, you can't just replace him. The Eye Spirit won't let you out unless Les is killed." Claire added.</p>

  <p>The strength of the members of the Element Spirit race inside Slade greatly varied. There were weak ones, which were the average members, but there were also powerful ones, which included Gavyn.</p>

  <p>"Tch. Then I hope that happens for real," Gavyn said through Slade's body.</p>

  <p>However, although they were seeing that Les was in a bad situation, they didn't think that he would actually lose, let alone die.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had already thrown more than twenty massive punches in rapid succession. The cubic stone hanging beside Les had started dimming, and a thin crack appeared on its surface. Soon after, the transparent sphere burst into pieces with a loud bang.</p>

  <p>However, Les was just actually waiting for that exact moment to launch his counterattack.</p>

  <p>He suddenly stretched out his hand and grabbed Luo Zheng's neck. "I must congratulate you for breaking through my protective shield. Now, have a taste of my true strength!</p>

  <p>Thunder Crack!"</p>

  <p>Crash! Boom!</p>

  <p>Suddenly, countless thunderbolts poured from the sky.</p>

  <p>Several bolts of lightning struck the top of the mountains, forming circles of lightning.</p>

  <p>Each pagoda mountain had a circle of lightning on the top and there were probably millions of them that were simultaneously formed in the Myriad Pagoda Mountains.</p>

  <p>Then, the circular lightning bolts connected to each other, forming a huge Thunder Array.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>The Thunder Array continued to descend, destroying the surface of the mountains. Soon, the mountains revealed a kind of metallic color.</p>

  <p>"Watch out!"</p>

  <p>"Avoid the bolts of lightning!"</p>

  <p>"Stay away from the mountains!"</p>

  <p>The Wing King and the others on his back, together with the men in black robes closely behind, began to disperse and dodge the horrendous bolts of lightning surging down from the sky.</p>

  <p>The two groups met again at such an unfavorable situation. They maintained a certain distance and closely watched at the developing scene.</p>

  <p>"Array Hold!" Les mightily roared as he soared in the sky.</p>

  <p>Right at that moment, all the bolts of lightning contained in the humongous Thunder Array began to gather in Les's right hand.</p>
