<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Corpse Spirit Jin Wu now followed Luo Zheng's every command.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng was fighting with Phoenix, all the Corpse Spirit Jin Wu scattered around had closed in on them.</p>

  <p>Before the beasts had the chance to burn them with their blue flames, Phoenix quickly moved towards Luo Zheng and thrust her spear into him.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, her attack failed to kill him and the blue flames burst from the beasts' beaks and swept over them.</p>

  <p>It would be impossible for her to survive the attack even with her exceptional ability to control fire.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, on the other hand, could easily withstand the flames.</p>

  <p>As she flapped her wings, Phoenix's extremely slim body began to float back in the air. It was as if she was as weightless as a piece of paper. She passed safely through one of the gaps in the blue flames while Luo Zheng accepted the baptism of fire with ease.</p>

  <p>Phoenix originally planned to find another way of taking him down once she was at a safe distance away from the roaring blaze.</p>

  <p>However, it was obvious that Luo Zheng had no intention of letting her escape so easily!</p>

  <p>Just as she passed through the hot inferno, three Corpse Spirit Jin Wu had already surrounded her. Their wings were similar to sharp blades.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Their wings sang as they sliced through the air.</p>

  <p>A casual strike from one of these crows contained twenty thousand Jun of force. It would be difficult for Phoenix to defend herself from such powerful strikes. Her body still floated in the air and her wings flapped constantly to dodge the attacks.</p>

  <p>Just as she managed to escape the three Corpse Spirit Jin Wu, a dozen more Corpse Spirit Jin Wu rushed towards her!</p>

  <p>Sizzle! Sizzle! Sizzle!</p>

  <p>Aside from those Corpse Spirit Jin Wu that attacked her in close combat, more Corpse Spirit Jin Wu also began to spew blue flames in her direction.</p>

  <p>Just as Phoenix spun over the back of one of these crows, several more of the vicious beasts began to claw at her head.</p>

  <p>Now, over a hundred of them took their turns to try and attack Phoenix!</p>

  <p>"Get away!"</p>

  <p>From her delicate and tender outstretched hands burst an unexpected and unimaginable power. She grabbed two of the Corpse Spirit Jin Wu and began to swing them around.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The two Corpse Spirit Jin Wu she spun around encircled her like a windmill, sweeping all of the other Corpse Spirit Jin Wu away.</p>

  <p>During this attack, another figure silently approached.</p>

  <p>It was none other than Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>Quickly, he morphed into a sharp arrow and struck down from high above with his sword and aimed at Phoenix's back.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's strike failed to hurt Phoenix due to the Chaotic Source Spirits protecting her. To her surprise, his casual strike turned out to contain ten thousand Jun of force!</p>

  <p>A few more strikes from him and her Chaotic Source Spirits would surely be exhausted.</p>

  <p>'Is he strong enough to kill me?'</p>

  <p>The terrifying thought emerged in her mind.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Phoenix flapped her wings, trying to make Luo Zheng stay. But as soon as he struck his first blow, he ran as quick as a cheetah and disappeared behind the flock of Corpse Spirit Jin Wu in the blink of an eye. Unfortunately for her, the monstrous birds surrounded her again.</p>

  <p>Ever since he had gained control of the Corpse Spirit Jin Wu, Luo Zheng began to wonder how to best use them to his advantage.</p>

  <p>They were impervious to water, fire, swords, and spears. However, one disadvantage was that they were rather slow due to their huge size. They could only rely on their numbers to defeat someone as powerful as Phoenix.</p>

  <p>It would be challenging to trap a warrior as strong as her.</p>

  <p>But without warning, Phoenix jumped straight into Luo Zheng's trap using Grand Teleportation. She was right where he wanted her to be.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was worried she'd use the same power to escape again. Judging by the current situation, she wouldn't be able to use that power when she was alone.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>Phoenix managed to smash one more crow, but even more of them arrived and enveloped her.</p>

  <p>They just kept piling on, layer by layer.</p>

  <p>Once she managed to pass through two of them, Luo Zheng appeared again, undetected like a ghost.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>Another strike from Luo Zheng's sword slashed her back. Luckily, the Chaotic Source Spirits prevented her wings from being cut off.</p>

  <p>As Phoenix turned to try and catch Luo Zheng, the Corpse Spirit Jin Wu that were hard to defeat wasted no time in attacking her.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng and Phoenix were locked in combat, others from the Jin Wu and the Taiyi Heaven Palace were locked in their own battles too.</p>

  <p>Springer's plan worked wonderfully. The powerful masters of the seven mountains didn't expect that the Jin Wu would charge into their arrays.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the Bright Array, the Golden Array, and the Ivory Array were destroyed by the Jin Wu.</p>

  <p>But the powerful masters of the seven mountains weren't weak.</p>

  <p>Even without the help of the arrays, they were still strong enough to defend themselves and attack.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>A blood-red light burst as the leader of the Bright Mountain shook his long sword.</p>

  <p>Soon, the world around them was tinged in red as vibrant as blood. Even in the middle of the battle, the leader had managed to directly summon an entire world!</p>

  <p>The Civilization Artifact of the Green Jade Civilization which Luo Zheng had obtained and the Civilization Artifact of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization which the Evil God had obtained were limited to Stage Thirteen and Stage Eleven. Although the power of the Civilization Artifacts was terrifying, due to the pressure from the Other Shore, neither Luo Zheng nor Evil God had reached their full potential and power yet.</p>

  <p>The Civilization Artifact the leader of the Bright Mountain held came from Stage Thirty. The power the Other Shore Tokens from the Desire World burst out was unlike any of the Lust World's Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>"Bloody Descent!"</p>

  <p>The blood-red light spread out and covered a radius of a million miles!</p>

  <p>The entire area now appeared to be bathed in blood.</p>

  <p>All everyone could see was tinged with a vibrant crimson.</p>

  <p>"The leader of the Bright Mountain summoned the blood-red world!"</p>

  <p>"He's bent the rules in this area!"</p>

  <p>"It is said that the blood-red world can suppress all others' bloodline powers to increase his own bloodline power!"</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>With a long sword in his hand, the leader of the Bright Mountain turned into a ray of blood radiance and pierced through a member of the Jin Wu.</p>

  <p>"You think you're the only one who can summon a world?"</p>

  <p>In the distance, Springer let out a sinister laugh. He spread out his black wings and black feathers began to float in the air.</p>

  <p>These feathers spread out quickly, like drops of black ink on white paper.</p>

  <p>Soon, another world was summoned and it covered the blood-red world!</p>

  <p>Now, black masses floated everywhere. They were like ferocious ghosts that pounced in various directions.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A Taiyi Guard hardly had time to dodge when a black mass invaded his body and turned his flesh black almost instantly.</p>

  <p>He looked at his hands and feet. His face was full of fear.</p>

  <p>But this fear was short-lived.</p>

  <p>Black spikes began to jut out of his back one by one. His eyes sank into the sockets and his body began to broaden. He turned and twisted until he became an unrecognizable monster.</p>

  <p>"Come out, Fickle Demons! Ha-ha!" Springer laughed and commanded.</p>

  <p>The Civilization Artifact he carried was used to summon demons. Once it was used, everything in the world would become sacrificial offerings.</p>

  <p>The more sacrifices, the more powerful the Fickle Demons would become!</p>

  <p>If there were enough sacrificial offerings, they could even produce Fickle Demons that could surpass powerful masters like Emperor Di Jun and Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>
