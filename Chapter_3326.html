<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3326 She Was Spotted </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Although Dorothy knew that her wish was unrealistic and that there was a great possibility that she was waiting for nothing, she still chose to wait.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, members of the Bearing race continuously arranged the Soul Binding Threads, and soon they reached the hillside.</p>

  <p>One of them glanced at Dorothy and remarked, "You have no business here!</p>

  <p>You should leave right now. If you get stuck to the Soul Binding Threads, we won't help you!"</p>

  <p>Dorothy looked up at him and faintly replied, "It's just to open the door of the Grand Sky Temple. What's the big deal? Even the Ear Mice didn't take precautions like that."</p>

  <p>Previously, when the Ear Mouse race opened the Grand Sky Temple's door, they only sprayed some Soul Interdicting Water and then arranged a few restrictions. But now, the Bearing race was making a mountain out of a molehill.</p>

  <p>"Humph! Enough nonsense! Leave now, or we won't be so kind!" A man from the Bearing race warned her moodily.</p>

  <p>It would be troublesome too if she got stuck to the Soul Binding Threads, as that would make it difficult for her to leave the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Dorothy's heart was filled with resentment, but she couldn't do anything because they outnumbered her. She was too wise to confront them where she would obviously lose, so she reluctantly stood up and prepared to leave.</p>

  <p>This time, Dorothy chose to make a concession. Usually, Souls of Light would go their ways and would avoid interfering with others. After all, it was difficult to identify Souls of Light on the Other Shore, as they were all blurred in appearances.</p>

  <p>But one man from the Bearing race had been observing Dorothy from head to toe. And when their eyes met, a glimmer of light flashed across his eyes.</p>

  <p>The day that the Ear Mice opened the door of the Grand Sky Temple, that man had also been present. He had seen Dorothy, as she fought with Haider and spent most of her time with Zheng.</p>

  <p>Although he hadn't seen Dorothy's appearance before, he was sure that it was her, as she had the same figure, soul aura, and voice!</p>

  <p>In the battle outside the Grand Sky Temple, the Bearing race had fought with the Oneness Sky Palace, and even before that, they had already fought against each other several times on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>When the Bearing race noticed the strong corporeal body of Zheng, they began to make plans to end his life.</p>

  <p>They were confident that although Zheng's body seemed invincible, and even if he had an upper hand against the Souls of Light, they could still find a way to deal with him.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng never came back after he entered the Dark Region. And so, the Bearing race had no choice but to sit tight and wait for their chance.</p>

  <p>Of course, it would be great if Zheng had died in the Dark Region, but in case he returned from the Grand Sky Temple, the Bearing race was well-prepared for him. They were confident that the second he came back, would be the second he would die.</p>

  <p>Of course, the man from the Bearing race had noticed that this woman in front of him was always following Zheng's physical body.</p>

  <p>So now, when he saw that she was about to leave, he called out impulsively.</p>

  <p>"Wait!"</p>

  <p>Dorothy stopped short and turned to him curiously. "What's up?" she asked.</p>

  <p>As Zheng had been trapped in the Dark Region, Dorothy had been dazed. She didn't notice that the man had realized who she was.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>Dorothy had barely finished speaking when a handful of blue Soul Binding Threads engulfed her until she was completely covered.</p>

  <p>She looked down in alarm and saw the Soul Binding Threads that were stuck to her body. Her face immediately contorted in anger, and she screamed, "What do you mean by this?"</p>

  <p>On the Other Shore, the acts of throwing things like the Soul Restraining Sand, the Soul Interdicting Water, and the Soul Binding Thread to others were seen as a declaration of war. She racked her brains for reasons why this man was going after her, wondering if she had offended any member of the Bearing race.</p>

  <p>But even the rest of the Bearing race had no idea what was going on, so they were also standing around, shocked and confused. As far as they were concerned, their companion shouldn't be stirring trouble, as they were at the crucial moment before the door of the Grand Sky Temple opened.</p>

  <p>The man suddenly shouted, "She is from the Oneness Sky Palace! The one that always followed the corporeal body! Hurry and catch her!" All the people around them turned to look at Dorothy, who stared back at them, eyes wide in shock and horror.</p>

  <p>The Bearing race was already planning to deal with the corporeal body, so when the members heard their companion's shout, they immediately understood what they should do.</p>

  <p>It didn't matter that it was difficult to determine who she was on the Other Shore. Their companion was much more trustworthy than a woman they didn't know.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Dorothy was also shocked that she was recognized by that unremarkable Soul of Light.</p>

  <p>In a panic, she took a few steps backward and stuttered, "I...I'm not from the Oneness Sky Palace... "</p>

  <p>Her hesitant answer and obvious intention to run away aroused more suspicion from the other members of the Bearing race. They immediately surrounded her, which effectively blocked all her escape routes.</p>

  <p>"If you're not from the Oneness Sky Palace, you could just explain. Why are you trying to escape?" the man from the Bearing race asked ominously.</p>

  <p>Whoosh...</p>

  <p>The people from the Bearing race suddenly joined hands and formed a huge soul net, enough to cover Dorothy's head.</p>

  <p>Dorothy knew that it would be more troublesome if she was caught by these people.</p>

  <p>She stepped back slowly, subtly trying to retreat, but the huge soul net was dashing to her. She gritted her teeth in distress, and the Necklace of Mystic Soul that had been hidden under her clothes suddenly appeared.</p>

  <p>It vibrated strongly, and a small soul sword slashed straight toward the soul net and cut through it with a swish of air. At the same time, Dorothy's Soul of Light twisted and punched out from the crack.</p>

  <p>"That's the soul sword!"</p>

  <p>"She used it to deal with Haider!"</p>

  <p>"Don't let her run away! She has been bound by my Soul Binding Thread!"</p>

  <p>As soon as she pulled out the sword, several people of the Bearing race shouted in alarm and recognition. They chased her with renewed vigor, and at that moment, she thought that she could never escape.</p>

  <p>They would never give up and let her go, and that thought discouraged her greatly.</p>

  <p>She cursed her luck quietly. She just wanted to wait for Zheng there, but the Bearing race recognized her. What bad luck!</p>

  <p>However, Dorothy had the Necklace of Mystic Soul. It was an extremely powerful weapon that could aid in her escape, so as she fled, she activated her soul sword to counterattack.</p>

  <p>This sword contained astonishingly sharp energy. And the Souls of Light of the Bearing race were well-aware of its terrifying strength, so they kept their distance from it warily.</p>

  <p>Dorothy ran west and all the way down the hill, while more and more members of the Bearing race chased after her. There were even members of the Sun Crow race, the Divine Farmer race, and the New Moon race that were following her.</p>

  <p>These Souls of Light had all reached the thirteenth stage of the Other Shore Realm, so their cultivation was not much inferior to Dorothy's. They chased after her wherever she went, without the slightest intention of giving up.</p>

  <p>Dorothy cursed once again in her mind. At this rate, she would be caught sooner or later.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter who you are, just surrender! Don't waste our time!"</p>

  <p>"We just want the body! If you help us catch the guy, we will let you go!"</p>

  <p>"You know you can't escape. Why don't you make this easier for yourself and surrender?"</p>

  <p>Dorothy snorted at all the voices, then she taunted them confidently, "Let's see if you can catch me!"</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Three small soul swords shot out from her Necklace of Mystic Soul, and they flew towards the Souls of Light at an incredible speed, leaving white trails in the air.</p>

  <p>The two Souls of Light of the Bearing race who had been talking to her were right on her heels. And because they were so close, they had no time to dodge the soul swords. Before they could scream, the small soul swords pierced them, and they were severely injured.</p>

  <p>"She is so strong!"</p>

  <p>"Be careful!"</p>

  <p>The scene shocked the other members of the Bearing race so greatly that some of them couldn't even talk.</p>

  <p>Instead, soundless gasps escaped their mouths, as they witnessed their members getting hurt.</p>

  <p>They were right to be surprised, as Dorothy's Soul of Light had already surpassed her peers. She had been able to compete with the top Souls of Light in the thirteenth stage with the help of the Necklace of Mystic Soul.</p>

  <p>But although they were frightened by her power, none of them retreated.</p>

  <p>They stood their ground, confident that they were stronger because they outnumbered her. Thus, they persevered and trailed her.</p>
