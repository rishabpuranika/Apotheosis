<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi stared at Zheng, a smile cracking through his serious face.</p>

  <p>He was always a gravely serious man; Zheng didn't know how rare this smile was.</p>

  <p>He stretched a finger towards Zheng as he smiled.</p>

  <p>The finger released the powerful, sharp radiance like a sword. This was a technique that could be performed by any ordinary swordsman.</p>

  <p>Naturally, however, as it was Eastern Emperor Taiyi employing the finger strike, it was incredibly powerful.</p>

  <p>Zheng felt that the finger strike contained the aura of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent's Truth Enlightenment.</p>

  <p>Seeing the finger strike heading straight for him, Zheng too stretched out a finger. A white spiral burst from his finger's radiance and he began making use of the Truth Enlightenment as well.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>"Swish..."</p>

  <p>Zheng launched an attack with his finger and Eastern Emperor Taiyi moved slightly and avoided it, responding with a horizontal chop of his own.</p>

  <p>Zheng reacted by gently moving his finger upward, and with a flip of his hand, he instantly stopped the chop coming at him.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, they had exchanged more than ten moves.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi restrained his strength to a very low level, only fighting Zheng with the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent.</p>

  <p>Zheng had comprehended more content of the Truth Enlightenment than he had. His finger radiance was sharper and more formidable than Eastern Emperor Taiyi's, suppressing Eastern Emperor Taiyi's every attack and forcing him to give up over and over.</p>

  <p>"I was on the Other Shore for quite a while this time, leaving only a soul fragment here. When anything important happened in the Oneness Sky Palace, Athemar and the others would report it to my soul fragment. After I came back and fused with the soul fragment, I was very surprised by you," said Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>

  <p>Zheng pretended not to understand and asked innocently, "Why? What is it that has shocked you?"</p>

  <p>"I have been studying the Truth Enlightenment for many years, too many. I once contemplated giving it up. Altogether I've only deciphered about 100 words. But you, only around 100 years old, have already surpassed me in deciphering the Sanskrit words. That is what has me shocked," Eastern Emperor Taiyi said earnestly.</p>

  <p>He was the man responsible for the construction of the orthodox human force. His goal was to achieve the ultimate level in all respects, such as deciphering the Sanskrit words, and cultivating the swordsmanship.</p>

  <p>The Truth Enlightenment had hindered him for too long. He hadn't achieved anything until only recently.</p>

  <p>However, after comprehending about a hundred words, the difficulty once again ramped up massively. There was no telling when he would completely decipher the two Sanskrit words.</p>

  <p>"I'm flattered," Zheng responded courteously.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi shook his head and said, "Our Oneness Sky Palace is very lucky that Athemar led you in. May I ask you a question? Do you believe you can decipher the entire Truth Enlightenment?"</p>

  <p>In truth, Geoffrey had already deciphered it all.</p>

  <p>But Zheng would not tell him that.</p>

  <p>Instead, his face saddened and he said, "The structures of the Sanskrit words of the Truth Enlightenment are extremely special. It's indeed very difficult to find a correct answer and decipher them, but I've found a method I think could make it possible."</p>

  <p>He actually had no idea how to decipher the Sanskrit words.</p>

  <p>He had just heard these words from Geoffrey and decided to vomit them out now.</p>

  <p>When he met Athemar, Zheng knew that sooner or later he would meet Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>

  <p>He hoped to rebuild the Nine Li race and the Oneness Sky Palace was the best ally he could have in his mission, especially considering they were against the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race.</p>

  <p>With this in mind, Zheng knew he should agree to a favor asked of him by Eastern Emperor Taiyi. But telling him deciphering the Sanskrit words was a piece of cake for Geoffrey was just not possible.</p>

  <p>"You have found a method? What kind of method?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi asked, brimming with curiosity.</p>

  <p>Deciphering the Truth Enlightenment was important work, and Eastern Emperor Taiyi was particularly interested in getting it done. After all, he had spent too much time and energy on deciphering the two Sanskrit words.</p>

  <p>"The..." Zheng hesitated before saying, "The method is difficult to explain.</p>

  <p>The process relies heavily on inspiration and guesses."</p>

  <p>Deciphering the Sanskrit words was something that was both mysterious and rigid. It was impossible for Zheng to accurately describe it, because it was far from an easy task. Otherwise, all of the Sanskrit words in the world would be deciphered effortlessly.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi was eager to examine Zheng's memory, but since doing so was quite rude, he opted against it.</p>

  <p>"All right." Eastern Emperor Taiyi waved his hand. "Last time Athemar told me that you have deciphered and comprehended 150 words of the Truth Enlightenment. Have you made any progress since?"</p>

  <p>"I've been cultivating on the Other Shore since then. I haven't had much time, but I've deciphered more than 200 words," Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi's eyes lit up once more.</p>

  <p>According to Zheng, it might be possible to decipher all the content of the Truth Enlightenment, but it could take from ten to over ten thousand years...</p>

  <p>If Zheng had deciphered 50 more words in his spare time, Eastern Emperor Taiyi believed that at this speed, it wouldn't be long till he deciphered all of it.</p>

  <p>"May I have a look?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi asked, his voice trembling with eagerness.</p>

  <p>Zheng obliged happily.</p>

  <p>He had intended to help him anyway, and he still had to tell him about the matter of the Nine Li race. As he saw it, he would exchange the Truth Enlightenment for his help. He just needed to see if Eastern Emperor Taiyi had the resolve and courage to assist him.</p>

  <p>Zheng took out a pen and a paper and began writing.</p>

  <p>In a matter of moments, he had written the translation of the Truth Enlightenment.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi took the paper and examined the words. He recited the words silently to himself, a strong sense of admiration washing over him.</p>

  <p>He then carefully folded the paper and said, "Chiyou is lucky to have you as his grandson, but unfortunately..."</p>

  <p>When the Nine Li race was destroyed, the Oneness Sky Palace was overtaken by tension and shock because of what happened. Eastern Emperor Taiyi felt sorry for them and that feeling had always lived in his heart.</p>

  <p>After the Nine Li race was destroyed, there were only three of the four great orthodox human forces left.</p>

  <p>It was obvious that the Oneness Sky Palace did not support the Bearing race, and it seemed they would attack the Oneness Sky Palace sooner or later.</p>

  <p>Emperor Charm, who once had a good relationship with Eastern Emperor Taiyi, had turned his back on him. This was all part of the Bearing race's plot.</p>

  <p>Hearing the sigh of Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Zheng stood silently.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi suddenly asked.</p>

  <p>All swordsmen could benefit greatly from the Truth Enlightenment.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi did not think Zheng would give over the translation without asking for something in return.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi had also just alluded to the Nine Li race, which must mean he had seen through Zheng's thoughts and known what was coming.</p>

  <p>Since Eastern Emperor Taiyi had asked him directly, Zheng answered him directly, "I want to rebuild the Nine Li race and I wish for the Oneness Sky Palace to assist me."</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi was not surprised at all. He waved his hand and said,</p>

  <p>"I can help you. The whole Oneness Sky Palace will help you, but not yet."</p>

  <p>"Then, when will you help me?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"When the war between them fully begins," answered Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>

  <p>Most people would probably not know who "them" referred to.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng had explored the Dark Region and he had inherited the Civilization Artifact. He also understood that those super forces in the Source World were basically the spokespersons of certain civilizations.</p>

  <p>"Does 'them' you just talked about refer to the previous civilizations?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"You know of this?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi was truly taken aback this time.</p>

  <p>He thought Zheng, who had just reached Stage Thirteen, didn't even know the layout of the Other Shore. How could he know the existence of those civilizations?</p>

  <p>Several Oneness Governors would from time to time report important information to Eastern Emperor Taiyi's soul fragment.</p>

  <p>But he still had no knowledge of the fact that Zheng had stepped into the Dark Region, and that Feng Ge had become a purified being.</p>
