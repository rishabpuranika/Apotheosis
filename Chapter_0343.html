<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 343 The Magnetic Aurora (Part Two) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Follow me!" the black?robe disciple said as he held his sword in hand.</p>

  <p>They approached the two crystal balls. "See the name inside?" he pointed to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng fixed his eyes on the balls and saw that their names were carved inside. One of the crystal balls showed "Luo Luo Zheng Luo", while the other crystal ball showed "Zachary Zhao". Luo Luo Zheng presumed that Zachary Zhao was the black robe disciple's name.</p>

  <p>"This crystal ball belongs to you. The moment the magic array on the Seven Star Sword Light Platform is activated, those polar magic stones will release Magnetic Aurora! The Magnetic Aurora will come in all directions, and you must split them with a sword! The power of Magnetic Aurora increases with difficulties. If you hold a common sword, I'm afraid a Magnetic Aurora will destroy your sword," Zachary Zhao explained patiently. He lightly touched his sword with fingertips.</p>

  <p>From Luo Zheng's perspective, he must have used the sword to deal with Magnetic Aurora many times.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng soon realized that the trial on the Seven Star Sword Light Platform? was to guard the crystal ball. If the crystal ball was broken, the cultivation would be over. The swordsmen were sharpening their sword intents with the continuous Magnetic Aurora.</p>

  <p>"Rumble..."</p>

  <p>Suddenly there was a clap of thunder from the sky.</p>

  <p>"It's time to draw your sword! Quickly! Magnetic Aurora will soon come here! Each crystal ball can only bear three attacks and after that, it will be broken. And you will be out of the game. Be careful!" Zachary Zhao reminded.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded and then took out his Streamer Sword from the space ring.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..." came a clear, melodious sound of a sword as he drew his sword.</p>

  <p>This was the moment that Zachary Zhao was waiting for. He wanted to see what kind of sword Luo Luo Zheng would pull out.</p>

  <p>When Zachary Zhao looked at the Streamer Sword?in Luo Zheng's hand, he was totally surprised.</p>

  <p>From the appearance, Luo Zheng's Streamer Sword was not as powerful as Zachary Zhao's Candle Dragon. Its shape was just like an ordinary long sword, but when one looked at the silver luster on its body, one could be thrilled.</p>

  <p>Zachary Zhao didn't know how to feel when he saw a faint fairy texture on the sword. He paused for a second and stuttered, "It's... It's a fairy weapon!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng lightly shook the Streamer Sword, the sword radiance spread? continually like an old dragon absorbing water. Then he turned to Zachary Zhao and said with a smile, "I think so."</p>

  <p>He thought so?</p>

  <p>Zachary Zhao felt bitter about meeting that grade two of nature level guy who was carrying a fairy weapon.</p>

  <p>From Zachary Zhao's understanding, even a consummation of the nature level was not qualified to bring out the power of the fairy weapon and yield it. However, some consummations of the nature level were born noble and they might have the chances to be awarded fairy weapons from their elders.</p>

  <p>But?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng?was just an?outer disciple, and his actual strength was at the second grade of nature level. It was impossible for him to have a fairy weapon either way.</p>

  <p>However, Zachary Zhao didn't expect that the fairy weapon was not granted by others but condensed by Luo Luo Zheng himself. And if ever Luo Luo Zheng got this from someone, that must be the same woman who gave?him this semi-finished product at the Weapon Pavilion.</p>

  <p>While Zachary Zhao was still in a daze from seeing Luo Zheng's fairy weapon, two bunches of Aurora were approaching them at a slow pace. They were translucent and thick as bowls, with flashing blue light.</p>

  <p>"Is this the Magnetic Aurora?" Luo Luo Zheng stared at the approaching Magnetic Aurora with the Streamer Sword in his hand. He raised it gently, readying himself to fight.</p>

  <p>Zachary thought it was unfair that a grade two of nature level could hold a fairy weapon. 'What is going on in this world? Why is the world wasting such a magnificent weapon in Luo Zheng's hands? What can he do with that powerful weapon? How can it be any difference if he's holding the fairy weapon but could not maximize its power? It's no better than a wooden sword!' Zachary Zhao complained in his mind.</p>

  <p>Furious, Zachary Zhao jumped up and waved his Candle Dragon in his hand towards one bunch of Magnetic Aurora. He wanted?to imply to Luo Luo Zheng that it was not about the sword, but the person who used it. Even if he yielded a middle-grade spiritual weapon, the power it sent out was still far more powerful than Luo Zheng's!</p>

  <p>"Dragon Roar Sword!" roared Zachary Zhao as he swung the sword towards the Magnetic Aurora.</p>

  <p>"Roar!"</p>

  <p>Dragon Roar Sword was an overbearing and powerful sword method. As he swung the sword, a dragon roar would be heard. It was an amazing scene.</p>

  <p>A dragon shape sword energy was instantly formed, sending out a roar. It then rushed towards the Magnetic Aurora and garroted it.</p>

  <p>The Magnetic Aurora contained sharp energy, which could be used to hone the sword intent. If the sword intent was sharp enough, then the speed of cutting the Magnetic Aurora would be faster. On the contrary, if the sword intent was not sharp enough, it would be difficult to break the Magnetic Aurora.</p>

  <p>When Zachary Zhao's sword energy?hit the Magnetic Aurora, the Magnetic Aurora was crunched and then decomposed. Soon the Magnetic Aurora was torn into pieces by dragon?shape sword energy.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing the decomposed Magnetic Aurora, a smile of satisfaction crossed Zachary Zhao's face. Apparently, his sword intent had improved into a higher level and became faster. This time, he could stay on?the eighth level for another half an hour.</p>

  <p>After solving the Magnetic Aurora on his side, Zachary Zhao turned to?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng. He was eager to see how Luo Luo Zheng could exert the power of that fairy weapon.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng hadn't moved and didn't even say a word as he waited for the Magnetic Aurora to approach. After it was close enough, he suddenly moved, and his Streamer Sword cut through the Magnetic Aurora. Still, it was a simple chop.</p>

  <p>"A simple chop?" murmured Zachary Zhao with an awkward expression on his face.</p>

  <p>As a swordsman, he was very familiar with the basic swordsmanship.</p>

  <p>'Didn't Luo Luo Zheng practice other swordsmanship? Does he only know the basic swordsmanship? Performing the basic swordsmanship with a fairy weapon?</p>

  <p>Oh my god...' Zachary Zhao was confused. He felt a little crazy at that time.</p>

  <p>"Chuu!"</p>

  <p>Because of this simple chopping, a half-moon-shaped silver light was formed instantly. It was dazzling. Along the direction of Luo Zheng's sword, the sword radiance cut through the Magnetic Aurora.</p>

  <p>Unlike Zachary Zhao's dragon-shaped sword energy, Luo Zheng's sword radiance didn't make a sound when it staggered the Magnetic Aurora.</p>

  <p>The sword radiance cut through the thick Magnetic Aurora and then the Magnetic Aurora disappeared without a trace.</p>
