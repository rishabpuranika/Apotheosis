<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2697 Yellow Emperor Magatama </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>In the northern side of the divine land...</p>

  <p>After passing through the Dark Rise Mountain and crossing the north boundary, one would reach the North Star Region.</p>

  <p>Once a very prosperous and big region, the North Star Region produced many strong warriors. It was a place with many outstanding talents.</p>

  <p>But in the recent several divine eras, it had become a dead zone.</p>

  <p>The death aura emitted by the Lofty Tree killed all the living beings in the North Star Region. Due to its lack of use and maintenance, it slowly collapsed.</p>

  <p>In the midst of the surging death aura, Hamish quietly descended.</p>

  <p>As soon as he landed, the death aura gathered from all directions like a hyena that just found its meal.</p>

  <p>"Hmph!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Hamish's body shook slightly, and an invisible force spread out from his body. The deathly aura that had gathered together then began to disperse.</p>

  <p>He then looked into the distance. The Lofty Tree, which was as high as three hundred and thirty thousand miles was partly visible from where he stood.</p>

  <p>After locating the tree's position, Hamish activated the Grand Teleportation and moved towards it.</p>

  <p>After a while…</p>

  <p>Hamish appeared on the biggest branch right at the center of the Lofty Tree.</p>

  <p>Countless dark red silk threads spread throughout that branch and wrapped four giant crimson spheres.</p>

  <p>Inside each sphere was a faint shadow of a person.</p>

  <p>"Hamish, has something happened in the divine land recently?" a cold voice from one of the spheres said.</p>

  <p>Hamish gently cupped his hands towards each sphere and replied, "This time, we are certainly in trouble."</p>

  <p>"Trouble? That Harper has been cursed and is trapped in the Sunset Tree.</p>

  <p>That woman named Lorena is on the verge of dying. She only has a head left. What kind of trouble can't you solve in the divine land?" A daunting voice came from another sphere.</p>

  <p>"Yes, you're the only Other Shore Realm warrior left in this vast divine land. You manage the entire divine land by yourself. And still, you caused us trouble? You're such a waste!" A scornful speech was heard from another sphere.</p>

  <p>The red spheres were the Mixed Element Seals that Harper had cast.</p>

  <p>All the Mixed Element Seals relied on the Lofty Tree. They needed the life force they got from the tree to maintain the spell of the seals.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the Mixed Element Seals were difficult to break. They had managed to seal the Yellow Emperor Guards to this day.</p>

  <p>The three people who spoke were Zavier Pu, Salim Hou, and Lorcan Zha. They all were two-star Yellow Emperor Guards, and their strength was higher than that of Hamish.</p>

  <p>Back then, because Hamish was still slightly weaker, the Mixed Element Seal that bound him was also weaker, which made him possible to break the seal and escape.</p>

  <p>Those three Yellow Emperor Guards had been trapped there for so many divine eras. It went without saying that they were very miserable.</p>

  <p>Every time they saw Hamish, they always felt jealous. They could only mock him and wished that they could switch place with him.</p>

  <p>Hamish only ignored them. Instead, he cupped his hands towards the biggest sphere and said, "Leyton…"</p>

  <p>"Just say it. What happened in the divine land?" A calm voice was heard from the largest sphere.</p>

  <p>The Yellow Emperor Guard who was sealed in that specific sphere was Leyton Pang. He was the leader of the group of Yellow Emperor Guards, and also the only three-star Yellow Emperor Guard.</p>

  <p>"Some people from the outside are coming," Hamish replied with caution.</p>

  <p>"People from the outside?" Astonishment was evident in Leyton Pang's voice.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zavier Pu, Salim Hou, and Lorcan Zha couldn't keep their calm upon hearing Hamish's words.</p>

  <p>"People from the outside, huh? How strong are they?"</p>

  <p>"Where are they from?"</p>

  <p>"How many are there? Have you checked them out yourself?"</p>

  <p>If it was just another kind of crisis that broke out in the divine land, then it wouldn't be a big problem.</p>

  <p>With their strength, they could solve it. But if strong warriors from the outside got involved, it was a different story.</p>

  <p>"All of you, shut up!" Leyton Pang reproached.</p>

  <p>The other three Yellow Emperor Guards immediately fell silent. The silence in the surroundings was deafening.</p>

  <p>"Hamish, you can go on," said Leyton Pang.</p>

  <p>"There's more than a dozen people and one of them is a five-star Nine Li Guard," Hamish said flatly.</p>

  <p>That revelation caused the Other Shore Realm warriors within the four spheres to stay quiet.</p>

  <p>After a long while, Leyton Pang spoke again, "How did this happen?"</p>

  <p>Hamish looked distressed. "According to your plan, the simplest way is to let the divine land crash so that these Mixed Element Seals are destroyed once and for all. But it was stopped by Lorena's son. He has been gone for ten years, and now, he has returned and brought a group of Other Shore Realm warriors from the outside!"</p>

  <p>"The outside? The world of chaos is vast! How could he have possibly met other warriors at the Other Shore Realm? And a Nine Li Guard?</p>

  <p>Such bad luck!" muttered Zavier Pu.</p>

  <p>"What a coincidence!" Hamish shook his head. "And these people are trying to open a space channel."</p>

  <p>Leyton Pang said with a bitter smile, "We did the same thing back then.</p>

  <p>It seems like they will be able to enter the divine land in a few years' time."</p>

  <p>"What should we do now?" Salim Hou couldn't help but ask.</p>

  <p>The four of them were powerful masters at the Other Shore Realm, but a Nine Li Guard also wasn't someone to be underestimated.</p>

  <p>The divine land originally belonged to Chiyou. Once those people from the outside barged in, the Yellow Emperor Guards could only imagine how bad they would all end.</p>

  <p>"I've already told them to prepare a backup plan," Hamish said blandly.</p>

  <p>The first plan was to destroy the divine land. Once it had crashed, the Mixed Element Seals could not rely on the Lofty Tree anymore, and they would eventually collapse.</p>

  <p>The second plan was to find a way to take control of the Abyss Demon Region and forcefully tear up the Mixed Element Seals using the power of that region.</p>

  <p>That plan was rather complicated. After all, a forbidden area like the Abyss Demon Region wasn't that easy to be controlled.</p>

  <p>"Take control of the Abyss Demon Region… Do those Holy Beings have the confidence to accomplish this task?" asked Leyton Pang.</p>

  <p>Hamish thought for a while before he answered, "Right now, Nicholas has almost ruled the Time Sea. With so many Holy Beings doing the job together, the chances of success are high."</p>

  <p>Zavier Pu heaved a deep sigh and said, "Even if the seals are removed, I'm afraid that it will not help. We don't stand a chance against the five-star Nine Li Guard."</p>

  <p>Hearing his words, everyone fell silent, even including Leyton Pang.</p>

  <p>Indeed, even if the Mixed Element Seals were removed, the five Yellow Emperor Guards wouldn't be able to do anything but escape.</p>

  <p>Even the strongest among them, Leyton Pang, was only a three-star Yellow Emperor Guard. The gap in terms of strength was a stretch.</p>

  <p>After a while, Leyton Pang stated flatly, "We still have a chance."</p>

  <p>"How?" Hamish asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"Use my Yellow Emperor Magatama to turn to chaos for help. We can gather the nearest Yellow Emperor Guards to come and help," he replied.</p>

  <p>A strange expression crept on Hamish's face upon hearing Leyton Pang's suggestion.</p>

  <p>The Yellow Emperor Magatama was a necessary token for all of the Yellow Emperor Guards. Through its power, they could summon each other in times of need.</p>

  <p>However, it only usually happened in the Source World.</p>

  <p>Using the Yellow Emperor Magatama to gather the other Yellow Emperor Guards in the vast chaos?</p>

  <p>The possibility of its success was so little that it was practically insignificant in the matter.</p>
