<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Again!"</p>

  <p>Zheng roared, and over a thousand avatars appeared at his command again.</p>

  <p>The avatars formed a circle while overlapping with each other and violently slashed the downgrader.</p>

  <p>Ten thousand sword strikes.</p>

  <p>Thirty thousand sword strikes.</p>

  <p>One hundred thousand sword strikes!</p>

  <p>Despite their all-out attack, the downgrader still emerged unharmed.</p>

  <p>"I might have overestimated you," he sneered. "After all, you are not even a member of the Cinnabar race or the Fostering race in the fifth-grade world. You don't have that many chances to use the Extreme Form energies," he commented with a sly smile as if nothing happened.</p>

  <p>After he finished speaking, he suddenly raised his hand and the irregular heavy sword emitted a blinding orange light.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>An orange ring of light then started to spread out from the irregular heavy sword.</p>

  <p>When the orange ring of light passed through Zheng's avatars who surrounded the downgrader, they instantly evaporated into beams of light and disappeared without a trace. Only the real Zheng was left.</p>

  <p>"You may not be convinced, but I can easily kill you even without using the infinite energy!"</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The irregular heavy sword flashed with different colors this time. In an instant, massive amounts of Extreme Form energies were unleashed from each of its cracks.</p>

  <p>When Zheng saw the irregular heavy sword flashing, he became distracted.</p>

  <p>"The Soul Extreme Form!"</p>

  <p>Zheng uttered as he recognized it.</p>

  <p>However, the downgrader did not intend to use the Soul Extreme Form to create an illusion and control Zheng. He only wanted to divert Zheng's attention. Taking advantage of this opportunity, he rushed towards Zheng as he dragged the irregular heavy sword. He pulled it up afterward, creating huge sword radiance.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Without hesitation, Zheng swung his purple sword at the irregular heavy sword.</p>

  <p>He had immediately blocked himself from the attack of the heavy irregular sword.</p>

  <p>However, an invisible force passed through Zheng, splitting the cloud in half, which forced Zheng to withdraw from the Probability Extreme Form.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>Zheng's heart skipped a beat. With a gentle pinch of his hand, he bolted away from the downgrader through the Hyperspace Extreme Form.</p>

  <p>However, the downgrader didn't let Zheng get away. He went after him with a much faster speed.</p>

  <p>Before Zheng could leave, the irregular heavy sword cut through the distorted space and drew an arc in the air, slitting down towards his head.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>The irregular heavy sword sheared down Zheng's head, mimicking a sound of rotten wood being chopped down.</p>

  <p>Zheng's entire body began to twist, transforming into a strange kind of wood. The wood grew rapidly and entangled the downgrader. At this point, the downgrader was unable to break free as he was firmly planted in place. The light in his six pairs of compound eyes then dissipated, while the Extreme Form energies that flickered in the cracks of the irregular heavy sword gradually faded out.</p>

  <p>"It is... The Energy-devouring Wood..."</p>

  <p>A part of the downgrader's mouth had been shut by coiled branches. It was a bit difficult for him to speak or even mutter a few words.</p>

  <p>The Energy-devouring Wood was a product of the combination of the Life Extreme Form and another extreme form. It had once been popular in the Deep Space. The Cinnabar race had even created a forest full of Energy-devouring Wood to impede the attacks of the Fostering race.</p>

  <p>The downgrader didn't expect Zheng to employ the Energy-devouring Wood at all. He had accidentally been trapped by the Energy-devouring Wood which absorbed all the Extreme Form energies from his body.</p>

  <p>"I don't even know what kind of wood it is. I only know that it can trap and kill you!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes flared with a mix of colors.</p>

  <p>By the looks of it, two kinds of Extreme Form energies had been heavily accumulating.</p>

  <p>The purple color was the Destruction Extreme Form.</p>

  <p>The white one was the Doubling Extreme Form.</p>

  <p>The Destruction Extreme Form turned into a huge arrow that dragged a blazing purple flame behind.</p>

  <p>While the Doubling Extreme Form formed both large and small white rings of light that extended from Zheng all the way to the downgrader.</p>

  <p>The Destruction Extreme Form was the most destructive of the one hundred and forty kinds of Extreme Form energies, and its power was multiplied by the Doubling Extreme Form.</p>

  <p>The long arrow traveled fiercely across the small and large rings of light and shot the body of the downgrader.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>The sky suddenly lit up with what appeared as a huge firework.</p>

  <p>The purple flame was, in fact, more than ten thousand miles long.</p>

  <p>Any target that was hit would undoubtedly die, yet no trace of joy reflected on Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>The downgrader had changed the infinite energy into a limited one, which gave Zheng a chance to counterattack.</p>

  <p>However, he didn't think that he would kill the downgrader just like that.</p>

  <p>His trump card could at most save him some pride.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>A round of applause came from behind.</p>

  <p>As expected, the downgrader reappeared.</p>

  <p>"You have already figured out these methods not long after you brought back the Heavenly Ring Staff. I underestimated you.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, you still don't stand a chance.</p>

  <p>Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>The downgrader reached out his hand and swept towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>His energy was boosting to infinity again.</p>

  <p>Infinity meant that he was absolutely powerful and unparalleled, and no one could resist him.</p>

  <p>But Zheng suddenly disappeared.</p>

  <p>He was still the master of the Burial Land after all. He didn't need to use the Hyperspace Extreme Form, the Grand Teleportation, or construct a space channel to appear anywhere. The reason he activated the Hyperspace Extreme Form now was to trick the downgrader.</p>

  <p>Seeing Zheng disappear without warning, the downgrader said indifferently,</p>

  <p>"Playing hide and seek is useless. This world is too small, and you have nowhere to escape. The Probability Extreme Form..."</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>A thick black cloud then started to disperse.</p>

  <p>The downgrader created a huge cloud that could fill the entire Burial Land. It was made up of countless smaller clouds.</p>

  <p>As he stood beneath the huge cloud, Zheng reacted quickly and turned into a thousand avatars who scattered in all directions. It was hard for the downgrader to find the real Zheng now.</p>

  <p>But after a few moments, Zheng became desperate as he was struck with a realization.</p>

  <p>Since there were one thousand avatars in a cloud, countless avatars should also appear in countless clouds. In Zheng's eyes, numerous downgraders filled every corner of the Burial Land as well.</p>

  <p>There was no way for over a thousand avatars of Zheng to escape. All of them were instantly killed by the downgrader.</p>

  <p>"This is your primitive land, and you can safely revive even if you die.</p>

  <p>But how many times are you able to do so?" the downgrader asked condescendingly.</p>

  <p>He didn't withdraw the clouds or his avatars and quietly waited for Zheng to come back to life.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, countless fragments of different sizes scattered from the broken Source World.</p>

  <p>There was a body embedded in the crack of a rock with a diameter of three hundred miles.</p>

  <p>It was a huge hyena.</p>

  <p>When the Source World was destroyed by the needle, it was feasting on its prey. An unimaginable force swept down from above and split its head from its body.</p>

  <p>It was expected to die shortly as it had been beheaded.</p>

  <p>Compared to the creatures that had been sacrificed in the Source World and didn't even have traces of their corpses left, this hyena was already lucky.</p>

  <p>What was luckier was it was still breathing.</p>

  <p>With unexpected consciousness, it saw the neat cut on its neck after its head was severed from its body. It could even give an order to its body and get it out of that crack.</p>

  <p>Two hours later, it was still alive.</p>

  <p>Four hours later, it was still alive.</p>

  <p>Ten hours later, it felt a little hungry as its stomach began to rumble.</p>

  <p>Its head controlled its body to grab the dead roe deer nearby. It then directed it to stuff the deer into its mouth, and then gobbled it ravenously with its sharp teeth.</p>

  <p>Although the hyena wasn't very intelligent, it had a feeling that this was the strangest way of eating.</p>

  <p>It continued to chew and swallow the flesh it devoured until it felt its stomach becoming full.</p>

  <p>This was what confused it the most. It seemed that its head and body remained intact in a very incomprehensible way.</p>
