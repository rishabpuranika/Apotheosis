<br/><br/>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>In Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore, a row of transparent jars, each filled with soul crystal, sat in the inner hall of the City Guard House.</p>

  <p>Zheng was sitting upright in the form of his Soul of Light, continuously absorbing the soul crystal.</p>

  <p>The situation in Stage Fourteen had been stable for a while now.</p>

  <p>The Guide Weasel race and the Giant race controlled the two large cities, and these two races were Zheng's subjects.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't have to do anything. All the resources belonging to Stage Fourteen would be automatically, continuously sent to him.</p>

  <p>But it was impossible for Zheng to stay in Stage Fourteen. He needed to climb up to the upper stages and for this purpose, he had to strengthen his Soul of Light.</p>

  <p>Zheng's soul was absorbing the soul crystal and slowly turning it into a part of his soul. From afar, his Indigo Soul looked to be a shade of deep purple.</p>

  <p>The purple light on the surface of Zheng's soul thickened as Zheng absorbed more and more of the soul crystal.</p>

  <p>After all the soul crystal from the jars had been absorbed completely, Zheng looked up and asked the Giants to bring him more soul crystal.</p>

  <p>Several Giants entered the inner hall, jars in their hands. They put them in a neat order and then retreated respectfully.</p>

  <p>Zheng pointed to the jars, turning the soul crystal in them into a thin line, which then began to fuse with his body.</p>

  <p>Once Zheng had absorbed the soul crystal from three jars, it felt to him like he had hit a wall. The purple light on the surface of his body seemed to have reached its limit.</p>

  <p>Zheng frowned and tried harder to absorb the soul crystal. But a sense of rejection washed over him.</p>

  <p>"What is going on?" Zheng muttered curiously.</p>

  <p>Warriors needed to continuously devour the soul crystal. As long as they got enough soul crystal, their soul cultivation would increase rapidly.</p>

  <p>Dorothy had told him this in Stage One when Zheng had first laid eyes on the soul crystal.</p>

  <p>But now he was unable to absorb it. Why?</p>

  <p>Zheng was still confused when No. 9527 said, "You have reached the ultimate level of the Indigo Soul. You can't improve it any further."</p>

  <p>"The ultimate level of the Indigo Soul?"</p>

  <p>Zheng stretched out a hand and looked at the surface of his palm, which was shining, bathed in a strong purple light.</p>

  <p>"Yes. The soul crystal cannot infinitely improve your soul. It will reach its limit after absorbing enough soul crystal. This limit is called the ultimate level of the Indigo Soul," No. 9527 explained.</p>

  <p>Zheng thought for a while before asking, "If this is the ultimate level of the Indigo Soul, have Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Master Athemar, and Lady Flamine all reached this level?"</p>

  <p>Zheng still couldn't believe what No. 9527 had said.</p>

  <p>Zheng had felt a lot of pressure while facing strong masters like Elizabeth and Athemar. He had known then that the auras their souls were emitting were much stronger than his.</p>

  <p>"It's true, theoretically speaking," No. 9527 said. "But there are still other ways to strengthen your soul after you reach the ultimate level of the Indigo Soul. Once you make it to Stage Twenty Nine, also known as the Constant Glory Stage, you will enter the Soul City, transform your soul into Colorless Soul, and step into a new level."</p>

  <p>"Colorless Soul?" It was the first time that Zheng had heard of it.</p>

  <p>"That's right," No. 9527 said, nodding. "By then, your soul will no longer be ordinary. The Colorless Soul is much stronger than the ordinary soul.</p>

  <p>You will be strong enough to fight against the bodies."</p>

  <p>The Souls of Light had always been depressed on the Other Shore. No matter which stage they were in, they had been suppressed by any and every Other Shore creature without being able to resist them.</p>

  <p>But if they were to achieve a Colorless Soul in Stage Twenty Nine, things would drastically change for them.</p>

  <p>The physical bodies were undoubtedly powerful. But they would have the power to counterattack once their souls transformed into a new form. Some of the more outstanding souls even had the strength to kill Other Shore creatures.</p>

  <p>"Besides, I want to correct your notion," No. 9527 continued. "Lady Flamine, Elizabeth, and Athemar have all been to the Soul City and cultivated the Colorless Soul. But Eastern Emperor Taiyi is different. He has entered Stage Thirty Three, the Three Purities Stage, which is why his soul level is higher. It is stronger than the Colorless Soul."</p>

  <p>"There's another level above the Colorless Soul?" Zheng asked, his eyes flashing.</p>

  <p>"More than one level," No. 9527 said, smiling.</p>

  <p>"More than one level?" Zheng exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Yes. The Three Purities Stage is the core of the Other Shore. Every section provides its own opportunities. Both physical bodies and souls are suffering, yet becoming stronger. Those who step into it are extraordinary.</p>

  <p>Until now, no one has entered the depths of the Three Purities Stage. No one knows what level the soul can reach and how strong the physical body can become there. You can ask the Regal Jade Spirit," No. 9527 said.</p>

  <p>"No. 9527, you have explained everything in detail. You must have stepped into the Three Purities Stage before," the Regal Jade Spirit said.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 hesitated before saying, "I don't have any memories of my master going into the Three Purities Stage. But as far as I know, he must have reached the Grand Pure Realm."</p>

  <p>The Three Purities Stage was divided into three realms. The outermost realm was the Grand Pure Realm, the middle realm was the Supreme Pure Realm, and the innermost one was the Jade Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade Spirit let out a sudden sigh. This conversation seemed to remind him of something from the past. He said, "Back in the day, the Wing King led us to explore the Three Purities Stage. We had covered three million miles of the Grand Pure Realm by then and it was said that we would see the edge of the Supreme Pure Realm if we traversed one million miles more. But we weren't lucky enough to step into it."</p>

  <p>"Is the Three Purities Stage that dangerous? You couldn't even get through it with your physical bodies?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Physical bodies?" The Regal Jade Spirit shook his head and smiled. "In the age of the Regal Jade Civilization, the Truth of Powerful Holy Body was not forbidden on the Other Shore. The Wing King boasted of a strong physical body at the time, but it had still been difficult for him to move even a single step in the Three Purities Stage."</p>

  <p>All creatures of the Regal Jade Civilization had extremely powerful physical bodies.</p>

  <p>"As far as I know, no one was able to even enter the Supreme Pure Realm before our era. The Jade Pure Realm, which is considered the core, remains a dream," the Regal Jade Spirit continued.</p>

  <p>Many civilizations had explored the Other Shore for many chaotic eras. But they had only wandered around the periphery of the Three Purities Stage for a long time.</p>

  <p>At the Regal Jade Spirit's words, Zheng's eyes lit up. He was very obviously interested in the upper stages on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Since he had devoured enough soul crystal and reached the ultimate level of the Indigo Soul, he was going to break through to the upper stages.</p>

  <p>And although Zheng was still quite some distance from the Constant Glory Stage, he had reached the ultimate level of the Indigo Soul and would probably traverse the distance with ease. But then again, he still had an Other Shore Key from Stage Seventeen in his hand.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore Key had been obtained from the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed. It was likely to be related to the secrets of the human race on the Other Shore. He had no choice but to investigate it.</p>
