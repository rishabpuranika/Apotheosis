<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Failing to capture Hans, Zheng activated the Civilization Artifact in his body, and then a cyan feather suddenly sprouted from his body.</p>

  <p>He felt his body become extraordinarily light. He reached out his hand again and this time, successfully grabbed Hans' tail though he moved swiftly via Illusory Transformation!</p>

  <p>"Aoo!"</p>

  <p>Hans howled in frustration. He flapped his wings wildly, stirring up strong winds that buffeted Zheng.</p>

  <p>Now that he had been caught by Zheng, how would he be able to escape?</p>

  <p>Feng Ge who stood on the city wall, focused her eyes on the scene that had unfolded in midair. It was not exciting for her; she even felt a bit bored.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Raul and Clyde gasped in shock as their eyes widened in awe.</p>

  <p>"Isn't that Hans, the leader of the Star Falcon race? This is incredible!"</p>

  <p>Clyde exclaimed.</p>

  <p>As the leader of the Guide Weasel race, Clyde had already encountered Hans in the past.</p>

  <p>That powerful Star Falcon had shown true arrogance in front of the Guide Weasel race. Clyde was already the leader of the Guide Weasel race but he still felt inferior in front of Hans.</p>

  <p>It was hard to believe that Hans was seized by Zheng so easily, and he looked extremely miserable, "I have wanted to smash that face myself for so long!"</p>

  <p>Raul grunted as he looked at his own metal club in Feng Ge's hand.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge held it with one hand casually.</p>

  <p>The metal club was thick and extremely heavy. It took Raul a lot of effort to carry it. However, the thin human girl had been able to hold it easily in just one hand. Seeing her toughness and strength made Raul doubt the talents of the Giants.</p>

  <p>"If Zheng really defeats Hans, that's one less problem for us," Clyde mused with a chuckle.</p>

  <p>The Star Falcon race had taken advantage of their tremendous strength to put the Sky Water City under their control.</p>

  <p>When their strength waned and people noticed it, a rebellion would probably take place to overthrow their power in the Sky Water City.</p>

  <p>In the past, the Dark Bear race had used their strength to forcibly take over the City Guard House. Unexpectedly, it was not Zheng who made the first move to control the City Guard House but the Guide Weasel race and the Giants. Zheng's role was only to kill the strongest one, and that was all they would have required of him.</p>

  <p>Hans tried his best to shake Zheng off. He dragged Zheng up and down while the other Star Falcons followed closely behind them. Fear and panic were visible in their eyes. They needed to think of a way to rescue their leader from Zheng's clutches, fast.</p>

  <p>"Kill him!" Hans ordered in a commanding voice.</p>

  <p>The moment they heard his order, all of the Star Falcons raised their wings in response, forming starry rings.</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish! Swish!</p>

  <p>Starry swords shot straight towards Zheng from all directions, looking like sparkling golden streaks.</p>

  <p>However, as Zheng had grasped Hans by his tail, the other Star Falcons hesitated in attacking in fear of injuring their leader. As a result, they weren't able to shoot at Zheng accurately.</p>

  <p>Moreover, it seemed like Zheng was protected by invisible rules after he had activated the feather of the Wing King. Even if there was a stray starry sword that luckily managed to get within striking distance from Zheng, he would have easily dodged it by shaking his body slightly.</p>

  <p>Therefore, even a synchronized attack from such a multitude of Star Falcons wasn't enough to put even the tiniest scratch on Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng slowly made his way up Hans' body by grabbing his tail bit by bit until he eventually reached Hans' back. Suddenly, he leaped to grab Hans' neck and whispered coldly, "If you still want to live, go down!"</p>

  <p>It was extremely easy for Zheng to kill the Star Falcon right then and there, but it would produce a better reaction if he controlled him in the Myriad Spirits City!</p>

  <p>"Do you want the Star Falcon race to surrender? Over our dead bodies!"</p>

  <p>Hans lifted his head proudly.</p>

  <p>"You think you have a choice?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Breaking the giant Star Falcon's neck was just like snapping a twig for Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Of course I have! Star Stasis!"</p>

  <p>Hans trilled once again. In response, the gem embedded in his chest began to glow brightly, scintillating with a brilliant starry light.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>A huge starry ring rapidly spread out along his wings and formed a sphere, totally engulfing his body together with Zheng.</p>

  <p>The scant space within the sphere was just enough to contain Hans' bird body and Zheng's own. His large wings still extended beyond the boundaries of the sphere.</p>

  <p>As the sphere enveloped Zheng, it also exerted a resistance force. Zheng suddenly felt his strength being sapped, as if he had fallen into quicksand, the resistance weighing his body down at a great extent.</p>

  <p>Aside from losing his strength, he also felt that the flow of blood and air, as well as the transmission of sound, were extremely slowed down.</p>

  <p>"What... Is... This... Strength..." Even Zheng's speech became slurred. An expression of surprise came over his features.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter what type of strength it is; I'm taking you down with me!"</p>

  <p>Hans sneered.</p>

  <p>A slight tilt of Hans' wings outside the sphere made both of them glide in the sky and turn towards the east of the Myriad Spirits City.</p>

  <p>Clyde, who had been standing on the city wall, was shocked when he saw what happened. "Oh no! It looks like Hans wants to bring Zheng into the Dark Region!"</p>

  <p>"The Dark Region?" Feng Ge blinked her eyes in shock, refusing to believe what she had just heard.</p>

  <p>"Yes! East of the Myriad Spirits City, and beyond the Heavenly Dark Mountain and the Earthly Dark Mountain, there is a corner of the Dark Region. That must be where they are headed!" Clyde explained, a tinge of worry in his voice.</p>

  <p>"Zheng will be doomed," Raul said with a horrified expression.</p>

  <p>Both Raul and Clyde were creatures from the Other Shore. They had always stayed in the Light Region as it was ingrained in them that the Dark Region was a dangerous place. All the creatures in the Light Region were taught to be cautious of the Dark Region from the moment that they were born.</p>

  <p>"He has..."</p>

  <p>Feng Ge stopped in the middle of her sentence. She had wanted to reassure them that Zheng had Darkness Fruits and candles that were enough to enable him to stay in the Dark Region, but she belatedly realized that Zheng had not been carrying a space ring on his body. All of the Darkness Fruits and candles were in her possession!</p>

  <p>"Gosh! Take me to the Dark Region!"</p>

  <p>Feng Ge threw Raul's metal club forcefully. The club tumbled in the air for more than ten times then embedded into the city wall with a metallic clang.</p>

  <p>As she launched herself into the air, she straightened her legs together tightly. Her whole body resembled an arrow that had just been shot from a bow, heading directly east!</p>

  <p>Clyde and Raul followed closely on her heels.</p>

  <p>Raul's body was immense, and every step he took would have spanned about three hundred feet. Clyde's extreme speed was one of his advantages over other creatures. Both of them had not been able to catch up to Feng Ge, but they weren't far behind her.</p>

  <p>They could not help themselves from worrying.</p>

  <p>If Zheng met his fateful end here, it wouldn't end well for them, either!</p>

  <p>On the other hand, they wouldn't achieve anything good by going there!</p>

  <p>No one was able to prevent Hans from bringing Zheng with him into the Dark Region!</p>

  <p>Although Zheng had been engulfed by the Star Stasis, dying had been far from his mind. He knew that with his current body, those starry swords would be harmless to him.</p>

  <p>But when Hans took Zheng and leapt through two mountains, a dark area was revealed in front of their eyes!</p>

  <p>"The Dark Region!</p>

  <p>You want to drag me into the Dark Region?!" Zheng's expression rapidly changed into a dire one.</p>

  <p>Without the Darkness Fruits and candles, no one who had entered the Dark Region had ever survived. Zheng didn't think that he was an exception.</p>

  <p>He probably knew far more about the Dark Region than Hans, who had been a creature of the Light Region!</p>

  <p>"My starry gem has already begun to burn, and there is no chance for me to live. You should feel honored that I'm taking you to die with me!" Hans shrieked.</p>

  <p>The starry gem was a gemstone embedded in the chest of the Star Falcons.</p>

  <p>The Star Stasis with the greatest resistance could only be activated by burning the starry gem.</p>

  <p>Once the starry gem was fully consumed and burnt out, it would also be the end of Hans' life.</p>
