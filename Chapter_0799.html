<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 799 The Third Owner Of The Fairy Palace </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stared at the crack on the crystal ball, and heard Immortal Mist's increasingly weak voice, before saying worriedly, "I do have a token. Your crystal ball is broken. Are you all right?"</p>

  <p>"Don't worry about that! Show me your token! Quick!" Immortal Mist said anxiously.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had no doubt about what he should do. He took out the token from his space ring; the current fairy palace was of no use to him at all. The token with the word "wind" carved on it could only be a pass.</p>

  <p>The crystal ball floated before Luo Zheng and Immortal Mist stared at the token in Zheng's hand, sighing, "So that's how it is. You've become the new owner of the fairy palace."</p>

  <p>"So, you�" Luo Zheng was shocked and at a loss for words.</p>

  <p>Immortal Mist laughed, and the crystal ball started spinning towards a wall not too far away. A grinding sound emanated from within the wall, and it soon opened up. "Go and take out what's behind the wall."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was curious as he walked up to the side of the wall. He extracted two tokens from behind it, one of them exactly the same as his, complete with the inscription of the word "wind" on it.</p>

  <p>But the other token had the word "thunder" on it.</p>

  <p>The shape and style of the tokens were almost exactly the same as Zheng's. It was likely that all of the three tokens were from the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>Seeing the change in Zheng's expression, Immortal Mist said calmly, "I am the third owner of the fairy palace."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng took a deep breath. When he'd been in the fairy palace, he knew that it had had several owners before him. He had passed the test and become the new owner of the fairy palace. He hadn't expected that he would run into its third owner in this celestial tomb.</p>

  <p>"Then this token�" Luo Zheng trailed off, looking quizzically at the token with the word "thunder" on it and wondering what its purpose was.</p>

  <p>Immortal Mist smiled and said, "The token with the word 'thunder' is a token to the 'True Path.' The 'True Path' is also a cultivation path within the fairy palace, and even I have only activated a True Path."</p>

  <p>"Where did the fairy palace come from? Why did the first owner leave such a palace behind?" Luo Zheng asked again.</p>

  <p>"This fairy palace does not have a name. Since the first owner did not leave one, no one in this world is qualified to give it a name anymore. Not you, not me, not the second owner, not even one in all the one hundred thousand great worlds," Immortal Mist said.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng blinked, stunned.</p>

  <p>There were a hundred thousand great worlds in the Upper World, and even the famous Genuine Dragon World could only be considered one in a hundred thousand. But no one in so many great worlds had the qualification to name this fairy palace? Unbelievable!</p>

  <p>"Since you were able to become the owner of the fairy palace, I'll give you the token with the word 'thunder' as a gift. You can't enter the True Path now, but you can, once you reach the Life and Death Realm. I can't tell you too much about the origins of this fairy palace. I can only remind you that it is much bigger than you've imagined." Immortal Mist continued speaking.</p>

  <p>"Since you have become a temporary owner, you should have obtained the Contemplation Picture. Which one did you get?"</p>

  <p>"Contemplation Picture?" Luo Zheng thought for a moment, nodded, and then said,</p>

  <p>"It's the Sun Moon Stars Picture."</p>

  <p>The crystal ball trembled and fell heavily to the ground, producing a crisp "crack" sound. Another crack blossomed on the other side of the crystal ball.</p>

  <p>"Are you alright?" Luo Zheng asked worriedly as he saw the two cracks on the crystal ball.</p>

  <p>The crystal ball slowly floated up and lightly said, as if to brush it off, "It's nothing. Are you sure you have the Sun Moon Stars Picture?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded, and released a stream of demonic life vitality from his hand that emitted starlight.</p>

  <p>"The starlight from the Sun Moon Stars Picture! Nice! You actually obtained the last Contemplation Picture! This is unbelievable! This picture was one that the first owner of the fairy palace observed and studied. He was such a tyrant with such supreme power," Immortal Mist muttered to himself.</p>

  <p>"Who was the first owner of the fairy palace?" Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>No one in the hundred thousand worlds had the right to name the fairy palace. This meant that the first owner of the fairy palace had a status that transcended that of anyone in a hundred thousand worlds. He was obviously so far above them.</p>

  <p>How could Luo Zheng not be curious about such an identity?</p>

  <p>"That's not something you can figure out right now and you don't need to know," Immortal Mist said. "Moreover, if I'm not mistaken, you are cultivating the ogre's cultivation method. The Heavenly Ogre Fist is indeed powerful and can devour other things, but it is still not the right path. We are human beings. Why did you cultivate another race's cultivation method?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng rolled his eyes in disagreement at Immortal Mist's words.</p>

  <p>If it weren't for the fact that the Heavenly Ogre Fist had shown its might at the most crucial moments, Luo Zheng would have died countless times over. He thought it was easy for Immortal Mist to ask such questions. But Luo Zheng actually wanted to practice one of the top cultivation methods of the human race. The problem, however, was that he didn't know whether or not the Central Region had it. Even if it did exist, it would not be Zheng's turn to cultivate it.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng was a disciple of the Cloud Hall, the truth was that apart from the Heavenly Ogre Fist he had obtained from the Cloud Sect by accident, Luo Zheng had obtained all other resources by himself. The Cloud Sect and the Cloud Hall hadn't spent many resources on him. He was like an independent warrior, achieving everything all by himself.</p>

  <p>Zheng's expression told Immortal Mist that he had said something wrong. So Immortal Mist backtracked and said, "Never mind. I'm just a dead man. I can't even enter the path of reincarnation. How funny I was to lecture you on your cultivation method!"</p>

  <p>For some reason, those words made Immortal Mist look rather pitiful in Zheng's eyes.</p>

  <p>What was it that had made him cut off his own soul and wait here for two thousand years in bitterness? Why did he willingly give up the right of reincarnation? What exactly was the secret?</p>

  <p>"Immortal Mist, the cultivation methods I cultivate are a mess and not how they are supposed to be. But conditions were limited back then and I had no choice," Luo Zheng explained. He had practiced many cultivation methods that weren't exactly bad. A warrior who practiced any one of these cultivation methods could become a strong warrior and earn his name in the Central Region. But perhaps Immortal Mist thought them all average. Luo Zheng asked again, "Immortal Mist, you still haven't told me why you wanted to test my luck."</p>

  <p>"I just realized I've delayed this too much because of you having a token to the fairy palace. Stand back. I still want to test your luck," Immortal Mist said, deflecting Zheng's question.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng stepped back, the words on the Purple Star Grand Palace began to shine again.</p>

  <p>"The sun�"</p>

  <p>"Shade Star�"</p>

  <p>"Seven Red�"</p>

  <p>"Eight White..."</p>

  <p>"Four Green..."</p>

  <p>Bits of golden light flashed, and more golden threads shot out by the second. Each golden thread grazed past Zheng's body. They were so densely packed that they could easily drown him. Instead, they kept a safe distance from his body.</p>

  <p>There were many types of fates in the Purple Star Astrology.</p>

  <p>It was rather complicated; outsiders could barely understand it.</p>

  <p>Immortal Mist kept muttering to himself as he began to calculate Zheng's luck.</p>

  <p>His words were vague, causing Luo Zheng to strain to hear him clearly.</p>

  <p>After about fifteen minutes, Immortal Mist's words finally became clearer.</p>

  <p>"Two Black and Five Yellow. This is... No, no. The sun and the moon. This is... No. It's still not right!</p>

  <p>Ah! I know now! You will lead the world of chaos!"</p>

  <p>Before Immortal Mist could finish speaking, the crystal ball trembled once more and fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Cracks had already appeared at the top and bottom of the crystal ball, and a spider web of cracks now appeared on the middle. Luo Zheng did not know whether or not Immortal Mist used his "eyes" to look. If he did look, the cracks would have blocked his view.</p>

  <p>"Immortal Mist, are you alright?"</p>

  <p>The crystal ball had dropped to the ground thrice in such a short time.</p>

  <p>After the crystal ball had rolled on the ground for a full circle, it slowly floated up, and a desolate laugh rang out.</p>

  <p>'Could his brain have become damaged?' Luo Zheng thought to himself. But this was just one fragment of Immortal Mist's soul; he technically shouldn't have a brain!</p>
