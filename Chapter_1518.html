<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Compared to the other ogre members, these three ogre martial artists were shorter and their armors were very special.</p>

  <p>Their armors might be black at first glance but they reflected different colors whenever hit by sunlight.</p>

  <p>These armors were made from "Light Accumulation Iron". After activating them, they would change colors according to the surrounding environment. Combined with some divine textures, they could enable their users to disappear. Most warriors would not feel them around even if they were close to them.</p>

  <p>This method was useful to ordinary warriors at the Soul Sea Realm, but not to Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng's current perception was far stronger than that of an ordinary martial artist. Thus, he could easily detect them even though they were concealing their presence.</p>

  <p>These three ogre warriors had developed an intention to kill Zheng since they saw his extraordinary strength at the city gates. Truth be told, they planned to execute him upon seeing him leave the city by himself.</p>

  <p>The three of them were not weaklings. They were so powerful when they worked together. They had already killed a Spirit Supreme Realm master before. And now, they were silently tailing Zheng.</p>

  <p>A trace of boredom appeared on Zheng's face. He had been silent for years but he was ready now. He was just like a butterfly that had emerged from his cocoon. His mind had also quietly changed. He now needed to fight for a spiritual baptism of his own.</p>

  <p>He looked down at the three ogres below him and muttered, "Since you're interested, then come on. Let's fight."</p>

  <p>The three looked at each other while sneering. Amid their laughter, they all quietly vanished from Zheng's sight.</p>

  <p>This method of concealment was indeed very effective.</p>

  <p>The method wasn't only covering their voices and auras. It was also making them invisible!</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled as he watched the three of them quickly disappear.</p>

  <p>He had originally wanted to wait for the grasses and sheep to grow, and then he could finally participate in the fight. Before that, he would just relax in this wilderness. However, these three fellows came to him and he wouldn't mind a little fun.</p>

  <p>Zheng had also dabbled in the three cultivation methods recommended by Gus in the past five years.</p>

  <p>Zheng had never stepped out of the fairy palace for five years and no one had been able to fight with him. Xun was not suitable to fight with him since she was a sword spirit. Plus, the difference between his and Freya's strengths was just too great. Although Freya had also made great progress during these five years, she was still not qualified to spar with Zheng.</p>

  <p>After the three ogres had hidden, they used the technique of restraining their breathing and rushed towards Zheng from several directions. Their figures were completely concealed from him to the point that he couldn't even see their shadows.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng closed his eyes gently and a strand of perception spread out from within his mind!</p>

  <p>The surrounding environment formed in his mind under the perception's depiction.</p>

  <p>There were three empty spaces on the picture, and these three empty spaces were rapidly approaching him.</p>

  <p>"They are really fast but it's a pity..."</p>

  <p>Within Zheng's inner world, the seedling of the World Tree was gently swaying. Following that, a stream of chaotic energy quietly rose from the seedling and was sucked into his body.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, a faint smoke appeared on Zheng's hands!</p>

  <p>"Eight Smoky Melodies!"</p>

  <p>Although Zheng didn't think much of this senior fellow disciple, his insight was indeed quite unique!</p>

  <p>The three cultivation methods that he had selected were not conspicuous in the library. However, after looking through them, Zheng found that each one of these cultivation methods was extremely suitable for him.</p>

  <p>Even if there was a little problem with Gus, it wasn't strange that he had this kind of vision after thinking carefully. He was someone who had surpassed the heavens after all and in his eyes, Zheng was like a transparent person who was easy to understand.</p>

  <p>This Eight Smoky Melodies was an extremely unique movement technique!</p>

  <p>The vast majority of the escape techniques in the universe were all crafted from Original Laws.</p>

  <p>For example, wind travelling skill naturally used the Wind Law. Earth travelling skill, on the other hand, used the Earth Law. Although the cultivation methods highlighted different things and used various Law Powers, they all led them towards the same destination in the eyes of experts.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, the Eight Smoky Melodies was different from all others. In reality, this cultivation method was somewhat similar to the Lower World's cultivation methods.</p>

  <p>The smoke in Zheng's hands was formed from his visualization, but it did not contain the Law Power!</p>

  <p>Logically speaking, the higher the cultivation method, the higher the Law Power it had. In this universe, the Transcendent Divine Might was also what the Supreme Lord comprehended from his own powerful Law of Causality.</p>

  <p>The Eight Smoky Melodies was a reversal of these principles!</p>

  <p>There was a drawing on the first page of the ancient book.</p>

  <p>It was a ball with eight holes, and within the pattern, there was a thin line that pierced through the eight holes.</p>

  <p>Zheng still hadn't figured what this was until now, but the first step in practicing the Eight Smoky Melodies was to visualize this diagram!</p>

  <p>The more he visualized it, the more mysterious Zheng felt!</p>

  <p>The distribution of the eight holes and the path that the thin line had cut through vaguely reminded Zheng of something. The pattern seemed to be struggling with words and even Zheng felt strange about it!</p>

  <p>This was a feeling that Zheng had only experienced once in the past few years!</p>

  <p>The first time this happened to him was back in the Divine Kingdom Continent where he crossed his tribulation for the first time.</p>

  <p>In the final moment of Zheng's tribulation, a black light that was enough to destroy the universe appeared. This black light was dragging a thin line through the air, spiraling continuously, interweaving, and slowly descending towards Zheng!</p>

  <p>From the looks of it, the black light's line was randomly drawn, as though it was moving through the air at will. However, its trajectory seemed to be in tune with some sort of terrifying rules!</p>

  <p>Although Zheng could vaguely understand this sort of rules, he still couldn't say anything about it. He couldn't even describe it!</p>

  <p>The line that was in the Eight Smoky Melodies might not be as complicated as the black streak, but the feeling it gave Zheng was the same.</p>

  <p>Even if this martial skill wasn't considered a Transcendent Divine Might, and it didn't contain the Original Law, Zheng still cultivated it without hesitation!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The faint smoke spread down from Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>At the same time, a black machete cut through the air and silently appeared behind him!</p>

  <p>Two other weapons appeared from two different directions as well.</p>

  <p>"Kill!"</p>

  <p>"Imperial Slash!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's expression didn't change at all while facing sudden attacks.</p>

  <p>He lightly swayed in the air and familiarized himself with the pattern inside his mind. His body was completely relaxed. He no longer had any killing intent, more so, any thoughts of counterattack. As if he was waiting to die, his hands folded. Nonetheless, he was very oblivious to everything going around him. He began to synchronized his mind along with this cultivation method.</p>

  <p>The three powerful techniques used together created ripples of energy!</p>

  <p>Especially the machete-wielding warrior whose slash sounded of whistling wind.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng was like a wisp of cyan smoke at that time, wandering about in this world.</p>

  <p>The machete broke through space and reached Zheng's back. This machete was as fast as lightning. An ordinary person would not be able to clearly see the machete's shadow.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, Zheng's body moved with the machete just when it was about three inches from his back.</p>

  <p>It wasn't Zheng who was moving, but rather the machete was 'pushing' him away!</p>

  <p>When the slash didn't hit him, the machete-wielding martial artist didn't hesitate at all and slashed the second time!</p>

  <p>Zheng still maintained a distance of three inches away from him and the warrior still failed to slash Zheng!</p>

  <p>The third slash!</p>

  <p>Still three inches!</p>

  <p>The ogre martial artist was stunned upon seeing what was happening.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, he didn't slow down from attacking amid his shock.</p>

  <p>'What was this movement technique?'</p>

  <p>He had never seen such a strange movement technique!</p>

  <p>Zheng's body seemed weightless. As long as he swung his machete, it would push Zheng away from a certain distance. He would continue slashing but the machete continued pushing him!</p>

  <p>He would never be able to slash Zheng this way!</p>

  <p>He had always maintained a distance of three inches from Zheng. These three inches were like an insurmountable natural moat!</p>

  <p>The Imperial Slash was a remarkable swordsmanship. It had the seven slashes that an ogre emperor thought to be the most powerful. It contained an extremely blade intent that was sealed within the seven slashes.</p>

  <p>However, this Imperial Slash could not even touch Zheng's clothes and he did not resist at all.</p>
