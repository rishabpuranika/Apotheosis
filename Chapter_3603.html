<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng and Feng Ge stood vigilant, facing the approaching Nihility Spirit.</p>

  <p>The Nihility Way they followed was strange and made them difficult to predict.</p>

  <p>The red ball floated towards Zheng and slowly came to a stop. Seeing it this close up, he saw that it was filled with bright red blood.</p>

  <p>A shadow in the shape of human became visible in the blood, and it slowly began floating out, stretching an arm through first.</p>

  <p>Zheng and Feng Ge looked closer to find a piece of white bone.</p>

  <p>As the bone left the ball, the blood in it seemed to boil and gather on the bone, turning into meridians and flesh.</p>

  <p>One moment the flesh was red and the next it turned white and tender.</p>

  <p>Then the skull, neck, chest and ribs emerged from the red ball as well. The blood began turning into the internal organs, eyes, ears, nose and mouth. In no time at all, a woman no less beautiful than Feng Ge had materialized.</p>

  <p>"I admire your courage very much. You were actually capable of luring the Moon Fire Slaves here. Do you have the Other Shore Key to the temple?" asked the newly formed human woman. As she spoke, her gaze shifted to Zheng's hands. Noticing the lines on his right hand, her eyes flashed as she reached out to grab it.</p>

  <p>Zheng withdrew his hand lightning fast, remaining wary of this thing before him.</p>

  <p>The woman didn't seem bothered. She smiled and said, "There is no need for such caution. We are of the same race."</p>

  <p>"We are not of the same race as you!" Feng Ge retorted angrily. "You grew from bones!"</p>

  <p>The woman froze at these words. She then smiled again and replied, "I may have grown from bones, but I'm still more human than a pig-faced monster."</p>

  <p>"You little..." Feng Ge burned with rage; she had gained her body from a pig-faced monster.</p>

  <p>The human woman ignored Feng Ge and got right to the point. "I'll give you two choices. The first is to submit to us and join the Nihility race. Then I'll escort you to the temple," she said to Zheng.</p>

  <p>She was wise and experienced. She knew they were both purified beings, but they were obviously different from the rest. People like them bared the qualities necessary to join the Nihility race.</p>

  <p>"What's the second choice?" Zheng asked blankly.</p>

  <p>Grinning, she replied, "I'll kill you and destroy you, leaving only your right hand."</p>

  <p>Zheng's hand held the key to opening the temple. She had saved him and Feng Ge for the sake of that hand.</p>

  <p>"Few have the chance to join the Nihility race. Being one of us will allow you to see the truth of this world more clearly. What do you think?"</p>

  <p>Below her waist were not legs, but a snake tail covered in scales.</p>

  <p>Could it be she was of the Snake Goddess race?</p>

  <p>Zheng's heart skipped a beat as he contemplated the relationship between this woman, the human race and the Snake Goddess race.</p>

  <p>Seeing how close the woman was to him, Zheng suddenly smiled and replied,</p>

  <p>"I refuse!"</p>

  <p>Immediately, he wildly unleashed the power within his body.</p>

  <p>He held nothing back and punched her with all his strength.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The punch sent a vibration spreading through her bones, turning her flesh into powder.</p>

  <p>But to his surprise, her bones were tough enough to take the blow and none was broken.</p>

  <p>"Let's go!"</p>

  <p>The force of the punch sent Zheng flying backwards, and he quickly darted into the thick white mist.</p>

  <p>The woman's bones returned to the red ball and became nothing more than a blurry figure. A piercing voice erupted from within the ball. "You're dancing with death now!"</p>

  <p>The voice was so sharp and powerful that it reached Zheng's ears quite clearly.</p>

  <p>"What if she catches up?" asked Feng Ge worriedly, her eyes wide.</p>

  <p>"Do not fear her," Zheng replied comfortingly.</p>

  <p>Since the woman had descended from an upper stage, her strength had been suppressed as well. It was possible she might not be able to defeat him.</p>

  <p>She had defeated the figures in the white mist with ease. But that didn't mean she was strong. All it meant was that she was familiar with this area and had been well prepared.</p>

  <p>Moreover, once the figures in the white mist were defeated, they didn't appear again. Zheng was not afraid.</p>

  <p>As for joining the Nihility race, that was never going to happen.</p>

  <p>"The second area is called the Mist Killing Array. I have helped you remove the danger, but you'll have a hard time finding your way out.</p>

  <p>It's a great honor to be chosen by our Nihility race.</p>

  <p>Why are you refusing me?"</p>

  <p>The woman's voice was sultry and hypnotizing.</p>

  <p>The souls at Stage Seventeen would certainly be unable to resist.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng and Feng Ge were immune to it; they had absorbed a large amount of soul crystal and had reached the ultimate level of the Indigo Soul.</p>

  <p>"That woman's voice is so annoying," Feng Ge complained.</p>

  <p>"Our top priority is to find a way out. We seem to be moving in circles,"</p>

  <p>Zheng said, frowning.</p>

  <p>There were no reference points in the white mist, so getting lost and losing a sense of direction were easy.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge pursed her lips and considered their options. Right now, their resources on the Other Shore were very limited.</p>

  <p>"This is not the Dark Region. Your advantages as purified beings are completely useless against us. If you fall into the hands of the Moon Fire Slaves, your end will be much more miserable."</p>

  <p>The woman's voice came through the mist.</p>

  <p>'The light!'</p>

  <p>A thought flashed through Feng Ge's mind. Quickly, she said, "Light is straight. We can go along the light!"</p>

  <p>This area was not large. If they found the right direction, they'd be able to pass through in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>As Feng Ge finished speaking, she pinched her hand and flicked forward. A slender and long beam of light shot forward. Even in the vast white mist, the white light was a dazzling substance.</p>

  <p>Zheng blinked his eyes, a hint of joy on his face. "I didn't think of that. It's worth a try!"</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>He flapped the thunder wings on his back, turning into a flash of lightning and flying along the straight light.</p>

  <p>Not far away, the light was reflected in space, and a part of it deflected and shot in another direction.</p>

  <p>It seemed clear that Zheng had gotten lost because something was wrong with this space.</p>

  <p>But this time he wouldn't follow the deflected light and instead flew forward in a straight line.</p>
