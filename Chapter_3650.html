<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Whiz!</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, a sword radiance was aimed right at Elizabeth's back.</p>

  <p>However, just as the sword slashed down, Elizabeth already prepared for the attack. She spun around and broke Zheng's long sword into two clean pieces. After that, she swung her spear right at Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>Looking at Elizabeth who grew more and more angry by the second, Zheng was surprisingly calm.</p>

  <p>As if by chance, his head tilted enough and avoided the spear completely.</p>

  <p>Right after he recovered, he sat steadily on the back of the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow.</p>

  <p>Though Elizabeth wanted to chase after him, the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows piled up and blocked her way.</p>

  <p>These crows resembled a moving forest, so dense and hard to navigate through. This made Zheng a hunter lurking, and Elizabeth, the beast.</p>

  <p>Zheng would stab Elizabeth with his sword whenever he had the chance.</p>

  <p>A stab would not hurt Elizabeth, but it could consume a small amount of Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>Hopefully a number of strikes could kill her, too.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth never would have guessed that she'd be on the losing end. It seemed that these Corpse Spirit Sun Crows were so agile that no matter which direction she fled to, they would follow right after her and block her way.</p>

  <p>She was always too proud to ask for help from the other members of her race, but this time was different.</p>

  <p>After being slashed several times, she felt a sense of urgency and desperation.</p>

  <p>If she didn't escape, she would be as good as dead.</p>

  <p>On top of that, the fact that Zheng was a junior frustrated her.</p>

  <p>Eventually, Elizabeth decided to summon for help. However, no one came to her rescue or even responded to her. It seemed that the other members of the Sun Crow race were all preoccupied, and no one could salvage her.</p>

  <p>Whoosh...</p>

  <p>Just as she dodged the attack from a Corpse Spirit Sun Crow's wings, Elizabeth gritted her teeth and spread her wings wide. They flashed and glowed with a magic luster, prepared for her next move.</p>

  <p>"Hundred Phoenixes Dance!"</p>

  <p>Just like that, Elizabeth's body emitted a blue light as her bloodline power was awakened. This made her incomparably agile now.</p>

  <p>She then flapped her wings so powerfully, that she turned into a hundred fierce phantoms.</p>

  <p>As long as a small gap was maintained before her, the phantoms could go out.</p>

  <p>Even from a distance, one could see many phantoms of Elizabeth, some big and some small!</p>

  <p>All she wanted to do was get rid of Zheng. She had no choice but activate her bloodline power and use her bodily movement skill to save her life.</p>

  <p>It was notable, because this form of bodily movement skill was so complex and strange that even warriors with higher levels of cultivation, like the leaders of the mountains, were unable to locate her in a short period of time.</p>

  <p>Among others, Zheng was the most surprised to see the Elizabeths of different sizes. At one point, he was dazzled by what he saw.</p>

  <p>If it was Zheng who controlled the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows, he wouldn't be able to stop her.</p>

  <p>However, the real opponent Elizabeth had to face was not Zheng anymore - it was Emperor Charm.</p>

  <p>Emperor Charm had a smile across his face.</p>

  <p>The Hundred Phoenixes Dance proved to be a unique bodily movement skill of the Sun Crow race, and in fact, it was a theurgy he'd created.</p>

  <p>So even though Elizabeth was extremely agile and created phantoms to set people off, Emperor Charm could see right through her.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh...</p>

  <p>The Corpse Spirit Sun Crows from the outermost layer circled around once, only to be followed by the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows from the middle layer, and finished off with the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows of the innermost layer.</p>

  <p>As the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows moved in this motion, Elizabeth's avatars were destroyed one by one. This sent her speeding towards a narrow passageway, just in her hope to break through.</p>

  <p>From the passage, she could already see the blue sky outside.</p>

  <p>Just as Elizabeth thought she could escape, two Corpse Spirit Sun Crows came at her at the same time.</p>

  <p>"Crack! Crack!"</p>

  <p>But before she could even pass through the passage, four huge claws of the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows cornered from both sides and she could no longer move.</p>

  <p>With a look of pure shock, her eyes widened as she watched Zheng emerge from under a Corpse Spirit Sun Crow. She turned pale and cold, as if she had just seen a ghost.</p>

  <p>Zheng approached her slowly, looking calm and stern at the same time.</p>

  <p>Because Elizabeth had broken Zheng's sword, he held the Soaring Snake Sword tightly in his hand right now.</p>

  <p>At this point, Elizabeth already lost more than half of her Chaotic Source Spirits. She probably wouldn't stand a chance against a slash from the Soaring Snake Sword.</p>

  <p>It was right then and there that she realized she had already been defeated.</p>

  <p>She remembered that two years ago, she could have destroyed him with just a flick of her finger.</p>

  <p>"Why can you break my bodily movement skill?" Elizabeth asked.</p>

  <p>She sounded calm, as if she'd accepted the death that awaited her.</p>

  <p>However, she still felt it unbelievable that Zheng had seen through the Hundred Phoenixes Dance at first sight.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't strike her with the sword. "I didn't see through your bodily movement technique," he answered.</p>

  <p>"Then how..." Elizabeth trailed off, more confused than ever.</p>

  <p>"It was someone else who saw through your bodily movement skill," said Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Who is it?"</p>

  <p>Elizabeth knew that only Emperor Charm could see through it at a glance, but it was impossible that he would be here, much less that he would help Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng didn't acknowledge her question. Just then, a shadow appeared above his head; it was none other than Emperor Charm himself.</p>

  <p>With a gasp and wide eyes, Elizabeth couldn't believe what was before her.</p>

  <p>Numerous guesses of what might have happened crossed her mind. "You are..."</p>

  <p>She even thought for a second that before her was only a soul fragment of Emperor Charm, but the aura didn't match completely. However, her instinct told her that this was most definitely Emperor Charm himself.</p>

  <p>"I am Emperor Charm," answered Emperor Charm, completing her sentence.</p>

  <p>As Elizabeth absorbed what she saw, she couldn't help but fall to her knees.</p>

  <p>Emperor Charm exuded an aura of unmatched authority. It was so powerful that his presence alone was enough to make any one of the Sun Crow race surrender.</p>

  <p>"But you are not..."</p>

  <p>She still had doubts, no matter how real he was right in front of her.</p>

  <p>"I'm not the Emperor Charm you know," he said. "I'm the real Emperor Charm, the first Sun Crow ever. The Emperor Charm you know of is a seed I sowed in the Source World. He's my avatar."</p>

  <p>Of course, the Emperor Charm in the Source World knew about his origin, but he had never exposed anything about the 77th civilization to the public.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth's eyes widened once again.</p>

  <p>Over the years, the Sun Crow race was a super force that was highly submissive to Emperor Charm. But according to this man, the Emperor Charm in the Source World was only his avatar?</p>

  <p>"I... I don't believe it!" she gasped again, looking befuddled.</p>

  <p>She was the type of person to be firm in her belief, and that was what kept her always energetic and full of fight. Her belief was Emperor Charm who she obeyed unconditionally. But because of this man, her belief had been gone. To Elizabeth, this was worse than dying.</p>

  <p>"Zheng," said Emperor Charm.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, as he was watching the event unfold, Zheng held the sword and struck it outwards into the air. The sharp Soaring Snake Sword burst out with a strong force that was aimed towards her shoulder.</p>

  <p>However, the toughness of Elizabeth's body surprised Zheng.</p>

  <p>Seeing that she was not affected with the strike, he struck her three times in a row.</p>

  <p>Eventually, Elizabeth's Chaotic Source Spirits grew tired, and the sword finally pierced through her shoulder.</p>

  <p>As blood gushed out of her, Emperor Charm's eyes flickered with a golden light, and just like that, Elizabeth's blood floated into the air, forming a thin red line.</p>

  <p>"My avatar gave you the Dream Blood Theurgy, which can stimulate your potential. However, he indirectly controls you this way," Emperor Charm explained patiently. "I created the Dream Blood Theurgy when I was young.</p>

  <p>It had a flaw before, but I solved that later."</p>

  <p>Emperor Charm had lived through over 1000 chaotic eras on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Because of this, he had enough time to think and rethink cultivation methods, theurgies, and ideas that he had created before. This had allowed him to perfect each and every one of his creations.</p>
