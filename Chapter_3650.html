  <p>
</p>

  <p>Whiz!</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, a sword radiance was aimed right at Phoenix's back.</p>

  <p>However, just as the sword slashed down, Phoenix already prepared for the attack. She spun around and broke Luo Zheng's long sword into two clean pieces. After that, she swung her spear right at Luo Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>Looking at Phoenix who grew more and more angry by the second, Luo Zheng was surprisingly calm.</p>

  <p>As if by chance, his head tilted enough and avoided the spear completely.</p>

  <p>Right after he recovered, he sat steadily on the back of the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow.</p>

  <p>Though Phoenix wanted to chase after him, the Corpse Spirit Jin Wu piled up and blocked her way.</p>

  <p>These crows resembled a moving forest, so dense and hard to navigate through. This made Luo Zheng a hunter lurking, and Phoenix, the beast.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng would stab Phoenix with his sword whenever he had the chance.</p>

  <p>A stab would not hurt Phoenix, but it could consume a small amount of Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>Hopefully a number of strikes could kill her, too.</p>

  <p>Phoenix never would have guessed that she'd be on the losing end. It seemed that these Corpse Spirit Jin Wu were so agile that no matter which direction she fled to, they would follow right after her and block her way.</p>

  <p>She was always too proud to ask for help from the other members of her race, but this time was different.</p>

  <p>After being slashed several times, she felt a sense of urgency and desperation.</p>

  <p>If she didn't escape, she would be as good as dead.</p>

  <p>On top of that, the fact that Luo Zheng was a junior frustrated her.</p>

  <p>Eventually, Phoenix decided to summon for help. However, no one came to her rescue or even responded to her. It seemed that the other members of the Jin Wu were all preoccupied, and no one could salvage her.</p>

  <p>Whoosh...</p>

  <p>Just as she dodged the attack from a Corpse Spirit Sun Crow's wings, Phoenix gritted her teeth and spread her wings wide. They flashed and glowed with a magic luster, prepared for her next move.</p>

  <p>"Hundred Phoenixes Dance!"</p>

  <p>Just like that, Phoenix's body emitted a blue light as her bloodline power was awakened. This made her incomparably agile now.</p>

  <p>She then flapped her wings so powerfully, that she turned into a hundred fierce phantoms.</p>

  <p>As long as a small gap was maintained before her, the phantoms could go out.</p>

  <p>Even from a distance, one could see many phantoms of Phoenix, some big and some small!</p>

  <p>All she wanted to do was get rid of Luo Zheng. She had no choice but activate her bloodline power and use her bodily movement skill to save her life.</p>

  <p>It was notable, because this form of bodily movement skill was so complex and strange that even warriors with higher levels of cultivation, like the leaders of the mountains, were unable to locate her in a short period of time.</p>

  <p>Among others, Luo Zheng was the most surprised to see the Phoenixs of different sizes. At one point, he was dazzled by what he saw.</p>

  <p>If it was Luo Zheng who controlled the Corpse Spirit Jin Wu, he wouldn't be able to stop her.</p>

  <p>However, the real opponent Phoenix had to face was not Luo Zheng anymore - it was Emperor Di Jun.</p>

  <p>Emperor Di Jun had a smile across his face.</p>

  <p>The Hundred Phoenixes Dance proved to be a unique bodily movement skill of the Jin Wu, and in fact, it was a token he'd created.</p>

  <p>So even though Phoenix was extremely agile and created phantoms to set people off, Emperor Di Jun could see right through her.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh...</p>

  <p>The Corpse Spirit Jin Wu from the outermost layer circled around once, only to be followed by the Corpse Spirit Jin Wu from the middle layer, and finished off with the Corpse Spirit Jin Wu of the innermost layer.</p>

  <p>As the Corpse Spirit Jin Wu moved in this motion, Phoenix's avatars were destroyed one by one. This sent her speeding towards a narrow passageway, just in her hope to break through.</p>

  <p>From the passage, she could already see the blue sky outside.</p>

  <p>Just as Phoenix thought she could escape, two Corpse Spirit Jin Wu came at her at the same time.</p>

  <p>"Crack! Crack!"</p>

  <p>But before she could even pass through the passage, four huge claws of the Corpse Spirit Jin Wu cornered from both sides and she could no longer move.</p>

  <p>With a look of pure shock, her eyes widened as she watched Luo Zheng emerge from under a Corpse Spirit Sun Crow. She turned pale and cold, as if she had just seen a ghost.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng approached her slowly, looking calm and stern at the same time.</p>

  <p>Because Phoenix had broken Luo Zheng's sword, he held the Soaring Snake Sword tightly in his hand right now.</p>

  <p>At this point, Phoenix already lost more than half of her Chaotic Source Spirits. She probably wouldn't stand a chance against a slash from the Soaring Snake Sword.</p>

  <p>It was right then and there that she realized she had already been defeated.</p>

  <p>She remembered that two years ago, she could have destroyed him with just a flick of her finger.</p>

  <p>"Why can you break my bodily movement skill?" Phoenix asked.</p>

  <p>She sounded calm, as if she'd accepted the death that awaited her.</p>

  <p>However, she still felt it unbelievable that Luo Zheng had seen through the Hundred Phoenixes Dance at first sight.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't strike her with the sword. "I didn't see through your bodily movement technique," he answered.</p>

  <p>"Then how..." Phoenix trailed off, more confused than ever.</p>

  <p>"It was someone else who saw through your bodily movement skill," said Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Who is it?"</p>

  <p>Phoenix knew that only Emperor Di Jun could see through it at a glance, but it was impossible that he would be here, much less that he would help Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng didn't acknowledge her question. Just then, a shadow appeared above his head; it was none other than Emperor Di Jun himself.</p>

  <p>With a gasp and wide eyes, Phoenix couldn't believe what was before her.</p>

  <p>Numerous guesses of what might have happened crossed her mind. "You are..."</p>

  <p>She even thought for a second that before her was only a soul fragment of Emperor Di Jun, but the aura didn't match completely. However, her instinct told her that this was most definitely Emperor Di Jun himself.</p>

  <p>"I am Emperor Di Jun," answered Emperor Di Jun, completing her sentence.</p>

  <p>As Phoenix absorbed what she saw, she couldn't help but fall to her knees.</p>

  <p>Emperor Di Jun exuded an aura of unmatched authority. It was so powerful that his presence alone was enough to make any one of the Jin Wu surrender.</p>

  <p>"But you are not..."</p>

  <p>She still had doubts, no matter how real he was right in front of her.</p>

  <p>"I'm not the Emperor Di Jun you know," he said. "I'm the real Emperor Di Jun, the first Sun Crow ever. The Emperor Di Jun you know of is a seed I sowed in the Source World. He's my avatar."</p>

  <p>Of course, the Emperor Di Jun in the Source World knew about his origin, but he had never exposed anything about the 77th civilization to the public.</p>

  <p>Phoenix's eyes widened once again.</p>

  <p>Over the years, the Jin Wu was a super force that was highly submissive to Emperor Di Jun. But according to this man, the Emperor Di Jun in the Source World was only his avatar?</p>

  <p>"I... I don't believe it!" she gasped again, looking befuddled.</p>

  <p>She was the type of person to be firm in her belief, and that was what kept her always energetic and full of fight. Her belief was Emperor Di Jun who she obeyed unconditionally. But because of this man, her belief had been gone. To Phoenix, this was worse than dying.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng," said Emperor Di Jun.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, as he was watching the event unfold, Luo Zheng held the sword and struck it outwards into the air. The sharp Soaring Snake Sword burst out with a strong force that was aimed towards her shoulder.</p>

  <p>However, the toughness of Phoenix's body surprised Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Seeing that she was not affected with the strike, he struck her three times in a row.</p>

  <p>Eventually, Phoenix's Chaotic Source Spirits grew tired, and the sword finally pierced through her shoulder.</p>

  <p>As blood gushed out of her, Emperor Di Jun's eyes flickered with a golden light, and just like that, Phoenix's blood floated into the air, forming a thin red line.</p>

  <p>"My avatar gave you the Dream Blood token, which can stimulate your potential. However, he indirectly controls you this way," Emperor Di Jun explained patiently. "I created the Dream Blood token when I was young.</p>

  <p>It had a flaw before, but I solved that later."</p>

  <p>Emperor Di Jun had lived through over 1000 chaotic eras on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Because of this, he had enough time to think and rethink cultivation methods, theurgies, and ideas that he had created before. This had allowed him to perfect each and every one of his creations.</p>
