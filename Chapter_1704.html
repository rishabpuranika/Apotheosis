<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1704 Luo Luo Zheng Won </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Shania was indeed the most powerful opponent Luo Luo Zheng had faced yet.</p>

  <p>Her comprehension of the laws far surpassed that of ordinary warriors of the same level.</p>

  <p>It was true that her cultivation level was her biggest limitation, but her ability in creation alone made her an opponent that could not be ignored.</p>

  <p>Perhaps there was something wrong with the strength of Luo Zheng's clones that she had created. Besides, she couldn't control them as freely as she wanted, and could only give the clones simple commands, like "kill."</p>

  <p>But that was enough!</p>

  <p>The simultaneous usage of the Gods-intimidating Strike by ten of Luo Zheng's clones presented a huge challenge for even Luo Luo Zheng himself!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Accompanied by the sharp ringing of metal, those ten sharply keen sword intents transformed into ten rays of sword radiance that dominated the air as they charged straight at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>'The power of their strike? is only sixty percent of mine!'</p>

  <p>It was only in that instant that Luo Luo Zheng had made his judgment. Meanwhile, he was a little confused.</p>

  <p>There was no physical difference between him and his clones when it came to the technique or the comprehension of the Gods-intimidating Strike. So why was there such a huge difference in terms of the power of their strike?</p>

  <p>This thought lingered in his mind, but he could not figure it out.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the golden light that Luo Luo Zheng had slashed out intersected with the ten rays of sword radiance.</p>

  <p>In theory, each of Luo Zheng's clones displayed sixty percent of the power of Luo Zheng's Gods-intimidating Strike. In other words, the power of the strikes of ten clones should then be six times stronger than that of Luo Zheng's strike.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng's sword strike was deceiving in appearance, for he had not simply transformed the chaotic energy into sword intent.</p>

  <p>Previously, Luo Luo Zheng had not developed the special characteristic of chaotic energy and had simply used it in the same way as warriors used their life vitality. Chaotic energy was much more condensed than life vitality. No matter how much he used it, the chaotic sea in his belly never decreased in size or depth.</p>

  <p>But it had to be said that using his chaotic energy like this had seemed an enormous waste.</p>

  <p>However, after he encountered Lone, Luo Luo Zheng had developed a completely new understanding on the ways of using chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>His Chaotic Gods-intimidating Strike could no longer be described in the same breath as the previous version.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng was only at the Soul Sea Realm, the strength he now displayed was something akin to that of the supreme chaotic weapons in the divine land. It was the strength that all True Gods could only dream of!</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>The air above the Heaven Earth Board became electric with potential and began to vibrate violently.</p>

  <p>That golden radiance which Luo Luo Zheng had launched was like a tide, beautiful, quiet, and potent.</p>

  <p>The Gods-intimidating Strikes that the ten clones had initiated were like ten ravenous sharks moving against the tide, intent on crossing the "water" line to kill Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Even Lawson and Lone were astounded by the magnitude of this confrontation.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's sword strike aside, the Gods-intimidating Strikes that his clones had displayed were already terrifying in the extreme. Even if Lawson or Lone wanted to deal with one strike, it would be extremely difficult, let alone face the combined might of ten strikes together.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Luo Zheng's own sword attack was beyond terrifying and mind-numbing in its power.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng doesn't count as a Godly Genius. He hasn't fully stepped into the Godly Way yet!" Lawson murmured. A complicated look appeared on his face. Once a warrior entered the Godly Way, they would have a strong form of internal momentum to power them, allowing them to suppress others without even attacking. Just as Nathan had done; using the internal momentum was enough to suppress the might of others.</p>

  <p>"But his skill has already surpassed that of a Godly Genius, right?"</p>

  <p>Lucille asked. She felt somewhat depressed. In the past, her impression of Luo Luo Zheng had been that of a storyteller. However, now she realized that even if she stepped into the Five Elements Godly Way right now, she still wouldn't be a match for him.</p>

  <p>"This guy really knows how to use chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>Lone, if you have the chance, would you mind paying a visit to him, personally?</p>

  <p>I'd be willing to exchange my greatest secret with him.</p>

  <p>I must know how he can use chaotic energy like that, at all costs!" the broken sword demanded.</p>

  <p>That broken sword was still very confused by the fact that Luo Luo Zheng had used chaotic energy in the Gods-intimidating Strike.</p>

  <p>Since the broken sword was from the divine land, it was well aware of the terrors of chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>It hadn't been many years since the first supreme chaotic weapon had been crudely fashioned, but now the supreme chaotic weapons were on par with the supreme primordial weapons. In fact, the supreme chaotic weapons even seemed to fractionally surpass the supreme primordial weapons in their sophistication.</p>

  <p>If the broken sword could use Luo Zheng's chaotic energy to repair itself, its goal could be advanced by countless years.</p>

  <p>Lone nodded silently.</p>

  <p>He had once thought that he was the luckiest person in the universe.</p>

  <p>In fact, he had even, due to his over-inflated ego, looked down upon the ace talents and Godly Geniuses of the four great clans.</p>

  <p>Now it seemed that the universe was highly competitive. Every opponent he met had as many lucky chances as him.</p>

  <p>"I... I still need to work hard!"</p>

  <p>With a shock, Lone came to a realization and suddenly understood that he should have guarded against arrogance and rashness.</p>

  <p>In the end, however, he was still in the top ten. There were still many opportunities for him in the future.</p>

  <p>Those shark-like Gods-intimidating Strikes continued to roll and break through the tide of the golden light as the latter spread out.</p>

  <p>Occasionally, a gap would appear, but it would be filled in an instant by the golden light. These ten 'sharks' were unable to break through this water line of golden light!</p>

  <p>After about half a minute, the ten sword strikes were finally annihilated by Luo Zheng's sword strike.</p>

  <p>However, the power of Luo Zheng's Chaotic Gods-intimidating Strike had been reduced to ten percent, and it hadn't dealt much damage to Shania or the ten clones beside her.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng smiled faintly and raised his Thunder Wind Divine Sword once again.</p>

  <p>His second sword strike was already in the process of accumulating power.</p>

  <p>The Chaotic Gods-intimidating Strike consumed quite a bit of the chaotic energy. However, one strike only accounted for ten percent of Luo Zheng's chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng raised his sword, radiating brilliant light as if a new god had appeared.</p>

  <p>As Shania gave an order to the clones, they raised their swords in unison, preparing to attack again. At this moment, she could do nothing except to ask the clones to fight against Luo Luo Zheng once again with the Gods-intimidating Strike.</p>

  <p>But, mysteriously, the ten clones didn't have any sword intents appearing before them.</p>

  <p>"What is going on?" Shania frowned slightly in confusion.</p>

  <p>This scene, on the other hand, solved the puzzle in Luo Zheng's heart instantly.</p>

  <p>Shania could replicate Luo Zheng's body. With her power of creation, her Life Law had already loosened its shackles. However, though this method was marvelous, she was still not the Creator.</p>

  <p>She could make Luo Zheng's clones, but they were not exactly the same as him.</p>

  <p>They were reconstructed creatures that couldn't obtain the dragon scales' power or the chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>These clones were using life vitality instead of chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>The consumption of life vitality required for the Gods-intimidating Strike was extremely high, and now their life vitality was depleted.</p>

  <p>Usually, Luo Luo Zheng would use chaotic energy to drive the Gods-intimidating Strike, and each sword strike would have a hundred percent power.</p>

  <p>However, the clones' life vitality was far from enough to activate the Gods-intimidating Strikes. Therefore, the Gods-intimidating Strikes that Luo Zheng's clones had created were only a mere sixty percent of its original power.</p>

  <p>And those Gods-intimidating Strikes, despite being only sixty percent of its original power, had already drained all of the clones' life vitality.</p>

  <p>Given that they had used up all of their life vitality, how were they to use the Gods-intimidating Strike again?</p>

  <p>"It's over."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's sword strike raced ahead once again.</p>

  <p>The golden sword intent, like a flood tide, moved along the Heaven Earth Board and rushed directly towards Shania. It flooded the clones, immediately submerging them and rending them to pieces.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Shania gave up all resistance.</p>

  <p>With her comprehension of the Life Law, she could still deal with this unstoppable sword strike. But what would be the point?</p>

  <p>Besides, she had already achieved her goal.</p>

  <p>She believed that those Supreme Lords had already reached a decision.</p>

  <p>The golden afterglow of the Thunder Wind Divine Sword dissipated, restoring the sword's blue body again. Calmly, Luo Luo Zheng placed it into his space ring.</p>

  <p>He had won this battle!</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! The fact that Luo Luo Zheng is using my sword can be considered a kind of honor." Within the Mist Palace, Kyron's face revealed a trace of deep satisfaction.</p>

  <p>The gap between Layla and Luo Luo Zheng had just become too huge. Even Kyron had personally trained her for six years, yet the gap between them had grown bigger and bigger. The fact that Layla had been eliminated early in the Illusion Battlefield had not pleased Kyron at all.</p>

  <p>However, when he witnessed Luo Luo Zheng display such power with the Thunder Wind Divine Sword in his hand, Kyron also began to console himself.</p>

  <p>Earlier, everyone had thought Shania to be invincible.</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng had so convincingly defeated her, the other warriors began their own analysis and debate.</p>

  <p>"In the end, what Shania has cultivated is the Life Law. The Life Law itself isn't all that strong."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense! You don't think she's powerful? So how could she have defeated those ace talents and Godly Geniuses then?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't mean it that way."</p>

  <p>In theory, the Life Law didn't offer an advantage in battle.</p>

  <p>However, the power of Shania's creation talent couldn't be underestimated.</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng had not so fully comprehended the Chaotic Gods-intimidating Strike, he would definitely have fallen to the combined efforts of the ten clones.</p>

  <p>According to the rules of this round-robin tournament, Luo Zheng's opponents now only numbered two people.</p>

  <p>Nathan, Tianming, and Kurt were still waiting on the side.</p>

  <p>The strength of these three warriors was well-hidden. Of the three, two of them would fight first, and the winner would challenge Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was naturally unaware as to which one he was going to face.</p>
