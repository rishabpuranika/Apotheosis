<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2538 Conflict Between The Tribes </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Every centimeter of the Immemorial Wilderness was considered a vast gold mine.</p>

  <p>Of course, these gold mines were reigned by the strong warriors.</p>

  <p>A few of the big clans with noble bloodlines occupied many sections of Immemorial Wilderness with their powerful strength. By means of the numerous wild bones of the Immemorial Wilderness, they raised their own children here in order to make their clans the strongest and most prosperous.</p>

  <p>And that was how the world developed.</p>

  <p>As for the Immemorial Wilderness located beneath the Sky South Bone Tower, due to both the Nine Li race and the Yellow Emperor race, no part had been capable of claiming it.</p>

  <p>Up until now, the two clans had been fighting in that part of the Immemorial Wilderness incessantly.</p>

  <p>However, after so many years of constant combat, the two clans felt that the struggle had become meaningless. Still though, neither of them were willing to give up the Immemorial Wilderness territory.</p>

  <p>For this reason, the two great clans created plenty of 'Admission Tokens' in order to attract a few outsiders. The objective was to have them enter the place and collect the wild bones.</p>

  <p>In the process of collecting wild bones, it could only be expected that violent conflicts would naturally erupt!</p>

  <p>Countless Wild Gods had died during such ferocious conflicts.</p>

  <p>However, they all knew that the greater the risk was, the greater the profit would be. Their reward was worth putting their lives on the line.</p>

  <p>Many people were clear on the fact that obtaining an Admission Token such as this was easy. It was actually entering it that requested them to risk their lives.</p>

  <p>The old man at the auction house had just recently set the floor price of the Admission Token at five thousand wild bones. His reasoning was obvious.</p>

  <p>"One token only costs five thousand wild bones. Is anyone going to bid?" asked the old man, as casually as he could.</p>

  <p>No one responded. The room fell silent.</p>

  <p>The Admission Token costs five thousand wild bones, and it wasn't necessarily expensive, but the Wild Gods were hesitant about risking their lives just to enter that part of the Immemorial Wilderness.</p>

  <p>Of course, if they could survive, they'd benefit from a huge profit. That said, the Wild Gods present just didn't have the courage and guts needed to take that kind of risk.</p>

  <p>"Five thousand wild bones, calling twice. Do we have an offer yet?" the old man asked anew. Disappointment was starting to spread across his face.</p>

  <p>"Five thousand wild bones, for the third time..." He cleared his throat.</p>

  <p>If no one was willing to bid on it, the Immemorial Wilderness Admission Token would be considered an abortive auction item.</p>

  <p>Right at that moment, a voice slowly came from the corner, "I'll spend the five thousand wild bones buying the token."</p>

  <p>Everyone turned around and saw Zheng very clearly, even though the corner where he was staying was a little dark.</p>

  <p>"That guy..."</p>

  <p>"Apparently, he just cultivated to be the Wild God not long ago!"</p>

  <p>"With such little strength, how dare he accept the Admission Token..."</p>

  <p>The onlookers had strange expressions on their faces.</p>

  <p>Even that old man handling the auction was a little surprised. Out of kindness, he couldn't help but remind Zheng kindly. "Young man, do you even know where this Admission Token will lead you?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded confidently. "Yes, I do," he replied.</p>

  <p>The old man nodded slightly. "In that case, you can buy it for five thousand wild bones."</p>

  <p>Zheng had earlier learned from his mother that the Nine Li people in fact owned the Chiyou bloodline.</p>

  <p>Although he wasn't yet clear on the relationship between the people at the bottom of the chaos and the Source World, according to the information he had recently obtained, he was already capable of starting to analyze the latter.</p>

  <p>The Nine Li race must have had a grudge against the Yellow Emperor race. Otherwise, they simply wouldn't fight against them; there had to be a reason.</p>

  <p>Although everyone said that the Admission Token was very dangerous and everyone appeared eager to avoid it, it was also Zheng's only chance to get anywhere close to that large clan. Thus, he had no choice but to jump on this opportunity and go!</p>

  <p>The old man had several more treasures to auction, but Zheng didn't bother to stay.</p>

  <p>After leaving the auction site, Zheng paid the price for the auction item under the fair skinned woman's leadership. He handed over the five thousand wild bones. His original blood wild bone had been sold at the price of eighteen thousand wild bones, so he clearly had enough to purchase the Admission Token. In the end, he still had thirteen thousand wild bones left for himself.</p>

  <p>Zheng had to give five hundred wild bones to the auction house as a reward, and another five hundred wild bones were to be taken directly over to the Falcon Caravan.</p>

  <p>In other words, Zheng would actually be left with twelve thousand wild bones and an Admission Token.</p>

  <p>With such a large sum of money, Zheng became even more cautious. He knew he had to be careful and watch his back.</p>

  <p>Zheng had purposely stayed in the Sand Core City for a whole day, wanting to observe whether or not anyone was following him. He had even changed his appearance several times.</p>

  <p>He stayed there for an entire day before leaving the Sand Core City.</p>

  <p>After regaining his own appearance, he began his journey back to the Iron Tribe.</p>

  <p>He didn't immediately go to the Sky South Bone Tower.</p>

  <p>After all, he still had so many wild bones to be absorbed. Instead, he decided to prepare well before he set out on his next adventure.</p>

  <p>He had no friends or relatives in this world. Therefore, the only people he could trust were Zelda and Luther, and he still had to be on guard.</p>

  <p>He spent one full day on his journey, and he once again was back in the Iron Tribe.</p>

  <p>Once he was only a few dozen miles away from the tribe though, he suddenly saw several huge figures flashing in it.</p>

  <p>As he noticed the scene, Zheng felt somewhat confused.</p>

  <p>Even though Zheng was a few dozen miles away, he could still clearly see that Zelda had activated the Wild God Power. It was as if she was fighting against several giants! Was she in danger?</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Zheng sped up and flew over to her.</p>

  <p>Bang, bang, bang!</p>

  <p>Zelda, who was over two hundred feet tall, was still a very agile warrior.</p>

  <p>That said, she was the only one in a fight against the three Wild Gods.</p>

  <p>She clearly needed help.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>One of the Wild Gods hit her head extremely hard. The sound resonated throughout the space. She stepped back a few steps and turned over.</p>

  <p>After she steadied herself, two more Wild Gods rushed over to her, not giving her any chance to react.</p>

  <p>"Zelda!"</p>

  <p>Luther screamed as his face contorted with anxiety.</p>

  <p>Luther, on his behalf, had only cultivated the True God system for a few days, and the soul sea in his body hadn't even been opened. He wasn't qualified to participate in a battle of such level.</p>

  <p>"Just give up, Zelda. You have nothing to lose, even if the tribe is ultimately destroyed. You can take your brother to our Macon Tribe, instead," the Wild God in the lead shouted loudly.</p>

  <p>The Macon Tribe was located to the south of the Iron Tribe. It was also a very simple and backward tribe. The tribe members also lived in the edge of the Immemorial Wilderness for the search of wild bones.</p>

  <p>The two tribes were extremely poor. Despite that, their only mission was to fight for the remaining wild bones.</p>

  <p>The Macon Tribe was slightly stronger than the Iron Tribe. Had it not been for Zelda, in fact, the Iron Tribe might have actually been conquered by the Macon Tribe.</p>

  <p>Zelda didn't expect the Macon Tribe to hire two more powerful warriors to fight against her, forcing her out of the Iron Tribe.</p>

  <p>Zelda and Luther had been living in seclusion in the Iron Tribe for quite some time now. If they were to leave at their own will, they would very likely be exposed. It was only normal that they weren't really willing to leave.</p>

  <p>During the battle, it was Zelda who was at a clear disadvantage.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Before Zelda could stand firm on her own two feet again, the two Wild Gods were already right in front of her, and one of them kicked her straight in the abdomen.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Zelda stumbled and fell backwards. Her tall body, which reached high into the sky, smashed into the Iron Tribe, destroying a large area of the thatched hut.</p>

  <p>"You are so stubborn and stupid. It seems that my only choice is to kill both of you!" the Wild God in the lead said, as he stepped onto Zelda's chest.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, he raised his right hand. In his palm, one could see Zelda's brother, Luther, struggling desperately.</p>

  <p>As she saw what was going on, Zelda's heart quickly filled with despair.</p>
