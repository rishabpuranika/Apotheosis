  <p>
</p>

  <p>The flocks of Sun Crows approached from all sides. They surrounded Blue Cloud City like a vast, dark colored tide.</p>

  <p>The few buildings in the city stood like rocks visible on the surface of the sea. They crumbled as the enemy flew over them, submerged in the tide of Sun Crows.</p>

  <p>"They are coming!"</p>

  <p>Zheng said, holding his sword ready. Everyone was tense, waiting for the battle to start.</p>

  <p>The various Other Shore Tokens released all kinds of energy, which vibrated and hummed in the air.</p>

  <p>The first to fall to the Sun Crows were the people who stood in the outermost layer.</p>

  <p>Some among these people were True Gods and Other Shore Realm warriors. Yet their strength was below that of the soldiers in the inner circle, and they were soon outmatched by the sheer numbers of the Sun Crows.</p>

  <p>They put up only a brief resistance before they were overwhelmed.</p>

  <p>The sharp, acrid smell of blood filled the air. The sounds of screams, cries, and calls for help echoed all around them, punctuated by the quacks and squawks of the crows.</p>

  <p>Some of the soldiers were upset, and wanted to spread out to try to help the people under attack. But their orders were clear.</p>

  <p>"Everyone, stay put!"</p>

  <p>The strongest guards had already gathered in the central region and formed an array, their strongest line of resistance against the Sun Crows. If any soldier left without permission, the array would be broken.</p>

  <p>And so no one moved an inch, although their fists clenched and their hearts wept at the tragedy unfolding around them.</p>

  <p>These were battle-hardened soldiers. They were used to seeing death and destruction. Yet it was a terrible tragedy to see their own kind being torn into pieces by a different race.</p>

  <p>The crows were brutal and vicious in their attack. They slaughtered the people in their path by ripping them to shreds, and eating the torn pieces of their victims. Inexorably, the legions of crows drew closer and closer to the central region.</p>

  <p>When the crows were within striking range, a voice shouted from the high wall. "Attack!"</p>

  <p>There was a loud swish as soldiers swung their swords in unison.</p>

  <p>Countless rows of long swords shone, emitting waves of light and energy.</p>

  <p>It was finally time for the warriors to unleash their theurgies.</p>

  <p>The colorful radiance of the swords radiated brightly, spreading outwards towards the crows.</p>

  <p>The power emanating from everyone was incomparable. The huge gathering of people of the Other Shore Realm meant that all their various powers had been centralized into one massive, unstoppable force.</p>

  <p>As the light reached the first wave of Sun Crows, the crows were killed and torn apart. Every crow that rushed forward to take the place of the fallen met with the same fate.</p>

  <p>The sight of the dead crows raised everyone's morale, and they continued their attack.</p>

  <p>It seemed that through concerted and unified effort, they could overcome the crows even though they were surrounded on all sides.</p>

  <p>However, how long could they keep up this level of energy? The number of the Sun Crows was even larger today than on the previous day. There seemed to be no end to the waves of crows flying forward, closing in around them like a dark and deadly net.</p>

  <p>They launched the same attack at another line of Sun Crows.</p>

  <p>Like the first group, the crows collapsed under the power of their strike.</p>

  <p>They attacked the third group with similar results. So far, none of the soldiers guarding the Blue Cloud City had died.</p>

  <p>But there was something different about the fourth wave of the crows.</p>

  <p>Golden light glinted in their ranks.</p>

  <p>The soldiers saw the gold and froze. Rupert and the others knew instantly what it meant: the Sharp-winged Sun Crows were coming.</p>

  <p>The speed of this kind of crows was surprisingly fast, and they were not something an ordinary Other Shore Realm warrior could withstand.</p>

  <p>"Look out! The Oneness Guards will take care of the Sharp-winged Sun Crows! "</p>

  <p>As the fourth wave of crows pressed in, the Oneness Guards launched their own counterattack.</p>

  <p>Their swords swished in the air.</p>

  <p>The Sharp-winged Sun Crows were incredibly fast and powerful, and several of the crows were flying directly towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng watched the crows coming closer and raised his long sword.</p>

  <p>Before he could attack, an aura of power emanated from behind him.</p>

  <p>Rays of white light shot over his head, and struck the Sharp-winged Sun Crows. The crows that had been hit froze in midair, solidified into ice; they dropped to the ground and splintered into pieces.</p>

  <p>Zheng turned and saw Maxim behind him. He had launched the attacks.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry, I won't let the crows hurt you," Maxim said reassuringly.</p>

  <p>Together, the counterattacks of the Oneness Guards managed to weaken the threat of the Sharp-winged Sun Crows.</p>

  <p>But although they were holding their own against the Sharp-winged Sun Crows, this time, there were also many casualties in the ranks of the soldiers.</p>

  <p>The Sharp-winged Sun Crows that managed to pierce through their defenses had attacked some of the soldiers, stabbing many of them to death.</p>

  <p>As the battle continued, to their horror, they realized that the ranks of the Sharp-winged Sun Crows seemed to be swelling. More and more crows were coming in as reinforcements. Their numbers were growing increasingly difficult to fend off, even for the Oneness Guards.</p>

  <p>"Frost spiritual sword!" Maxim shouted.</p>

  <p>Maxim had brought out his ultimate weapon, a powerful, transparent long sword.</p>

  <p>The sword radiated a brilliant white energy. As he swung the weapon, rays of white light hit the attacking crows with unerring accuracy.</p>

  <p>The crows were intelligent, and soon discerned that Maxim was the primary threat to their attacks. Squawking at each other, the Sharp-winged Sun Crows seemed to come to an agreement. In a moment, many of them had circled around Maxim, and rushed to attack him.</p>

  <p>Maxim saw the impending strike and felt his blood run cold.</p>

  <p>He instantly recognized the danger he was in. There were too many of the Sharp-winged Sun Crows targeting him. He turned in a circle, swinging his sword.</p>

  <p>Energy radiated from his weapon.</p>

  <p>It was a full-strength attack that resulted in the death of around ten of the crows, but there was still an equal number of crows that had survived. They squawked and dove towards him. He had no time for a second attack.</p>

  <p>There were no other Oneness Guards nearby, and even if there were, they were too busy fending off other crows to come to his aid.</p>

  <p>A thought flashed through Maxim's mind in the last moment before the crows reached him. He thought, "Well, so this is it."</p>

  <p>His lips curved into a small, wry smile.</p>

  <p>Although he knew he might die one day after he became a Oneness Guard, he was lucky to have fought with them for so many years. But was his life coming to an end today?</p>

  <p>Even as Maxim accepted his fate, he felt the energy of another person's sword radiance rushing in his direction.</p>

  <p>He was completely astonished.</p>

  <p>Confused, he even wondered for a moment if he was the target. Was the sword radiance going to kill him?</p>

  <p>In a second, the attacks had swept past him, some brushing so close that they almost slashed his clothes. He heard a series of hits and thuds, and looked around.</p>

  <p>The bursts of sword radiance had hit all of the Sharp-winged Sun Crows surrounding him, and they fell dead to the ground.</p>

  <p>Bright golden feathers fluttered in the air around him. Maxim almost fell to his knees. He was still in shock.</p>

  <p>He turned and found Zheng stood there, holding a long sword, wearing a faint smile on his face.</p>

  <p>"Zheng?" In his incredulity, Maxim forgot that there was still a fierce battle going on around him. He asked, "Zheng, was that you? Did you kill the crows attacking me?"</p>

  <p>"You can't fight them off alone. Better if we work together," Zheng said.</p>

  <p>"That's not what I mean. I mean..."</p>

  <p>Maxim trailed off, unsure of what to say. He simply couldn't believe that a young man in the first stage of the Other Shore Realm had just managed to kill several Sharp-winged Sun Crows with seeming ease. Even Maxim himself had a hard time dealing with the crows right now.</p>

  <p>Unbidden, he recalled the strange events of yesterday.</p>

  <p>During the last attack of the Sun Crow army, many people and guards had been killed.</p>

  <p>But of the people he had brought here from the Grand River Fortress, none had died. He had considered that there might be one or two powerful people among that group.</p>

  <p>Until now, the possibility that it might be Zheng had never occurred to Maxim. Zheng had the lowest cultivation base. He couldn't have developed such abilities in such a brief period of time.</p>

  <p>"Maybe you can ask your questions later," Zheng said, interrupting Maxim's thoughts. The two of them looked up at the endless flocks of crows still flooding into the sky over the city.</p>

  <p>Zheng had been adjusting his style of attack to be more efficient against these unusual enemies. These Sun Crows were strong and fast, but they were also unarmored, and could be stopped by a well-aimed strike. So Zheng compressed his powers and lowered the range of his attacks while increasing their strength and accuracy. He killed virtually every crow he targeted.</p>
