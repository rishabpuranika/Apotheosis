<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3803 Luo Zheng's Choice </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's mouth corners curved up slightly into a wry smile. "You've engaged in so much trickery. What conclusion have you reached from all your observations?"</p>

  <p>"The conclusion is plain as day." The smile on Claire's face slid off her lips, and she became serious in her countenance. "Joining our Element Spirit race is the only path forward for you. I will ensure that you rank above the big ten in standing. Only six members have ever held this level of authority in our Element Spirit race."</p>

  <p>Claire's offer shocked the Other Shore creatures present into silence.</p>

  <p>The Element Spirit race had always been an enigma, and their governing structures and divisions of power had always remained unknown to outsiders.</p>

  <p>Even the Primeval Lord of Heaven, who had led the human race against the Element Spirit race for many years, only knew that the leader of the Element Spirit race was called the Eye Spirit.</p>

  <p>However, the creatures of Stage Thirty-two were well aware of the big ten of the Element Spirit race. After all, all their dealings in the Grand Plain Stage were usually handled by the big ten.</p>

  <p>Would they really grant Luo Zheng a standing above the big ten if he were to join the Element Spirit race?</p>

  <p>This was an impossible thing to consider, and shock echoed in the hearts of many Other Shore creatures.</p>

  <p>Some of the weaker Other Shore races rarely had the opportunity to witness one of the big ten even if they joined the Element Spirit race.</p>

  <p>In local terms, only the Eternal Realm masters of the major forces were qualified to attend the Blood Assembly. It was not hard to envision the true power and status of the big ten then.</p>

  <p>'Is she speaking nonsense?'</p>

  <p>'What qualifies this human to be so valued?'</p>

  <p>'She must be kidding...'</p>

  <p>Most of these Other Shore creatures were considering these and other thoughts in their minds.</p>

  <p>Although they disbelieved Claire's offer, they only dared to think so and would not risk speaking it aloud.</p>

  <p>"After the Purge Way is successfully concluded, I will give you three hundred places among the survivors. If you desire more, you are welcome to ask for more," added Claire.</p>

  <p>It was the plan of the Element Spirit race to delay the end of this round of chaos indefinitely.</p>

  <p>However, the only way to delay the end was to restrict the expansion of the chaos.</p>

  <p>To put it plainly, the plan was to purge all but ten thousand living creatures from the chaos, while destroying the rest.</p>

  <p>Therefore, each of the ten thousand places for the survivors would be precious and highly sought after.</p>

  <p>If the Purge Way were really carried out, the value of three hundred places among the survivors was priceless.</p>

  <p>With that knowledge, Claire still promised Luo Zheng three hundred places among the survivors without hesitation and might even give him more if he wanted. This was a sign of her sincerity.</p>

  <p>"Three hundred places among the survivors..." Luo Zheng momentarily considered and gently shook his head. "That's not sufficient for me."</p>

  <p>"How many do you demand then?" Claire asked as her eyes widened slightly in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Nothing less than ten billion will suffice, I think," Luo Zheng replied, shrugging his shoulders. He wanted everyone in the divine land to survive. Ten billion was probably still not enough.</p>

  <p>"Wait, ten billion is an impossible number because the degree of chaos will exceed our control," Claire answered earnestly as she pondered over Luo Zheng's demand. On second thoughts, she realized that Luo Zheng was pulling the wool over her eyes, and she immediately became enraged. "You!"</p>

  <p>"I won't be joining any of you. I don't approve of the paths you have chosen," Luo Zheng said nonchalantly as he stared at Claire's angry face impassively. "During my early days in the Source World, Master Athemar had disclosed the three paths of the future to me!"</p>

  <p>He suddenly raised his chin and announced in a thunderous voice, "The Purge Way is nothing more than a cowardly compromise. What is bound to come will inevitably come. You will murder everyone else in order to survive. What's the point of this?</p>

  <p>The Nihility Way smacks even more of a madman's balderdash. Those guys only want to drag everyone else to hell with them!" Luo Zheng continued, "I don't know why the needle would descend to end the chaos, but just because it exists, we have no reason to stop fighting against it! I know that there are many other ruling civilizations present who have fought for the Finale Way, and I believe that this is the true and just cause. As for the Purge Way and the Nihility Way, those are nothing but the paths of evil!"</p>

  <p>"You are a shameless upstart to dare make such remarks! You haven't even reached the Eternal Realm. What gives you the right to run your mouth like that here?" Elder Howe of the Violet Cloud race snarled at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Howe was highly offended by the tempting offer that Claire had tried to seduce Luo Zheng with, and he was even more shocked that Luo Zheng had refused her without hesitation. It was simply inconceivable!</p>

  <p>He denounced Luo Zheng at this moment because he believed it was an opportunity to curry favor with Claire.</p>

  <p>"Great speech, young human! If the Element Spirit race hadn't interfered with our efforts over the years, the Finale Way would have already succeeded. The Element Spirit race is to be blamed for the repeated failure of the Finale Way! They sabotaged our efforts!"</p>

  <p>Following Howe, another Other Shore creature also stepped forward to speak his piece and take a stand.</p>

  <p>This thin creature was from the Swallow Victory race. Like the Three Eyes race, the Swallow Victory race was not a mighty race, but they were well enough equipped to protect themselves at least.</p>

  <p>There were actually several Other Shore races like them in Stage Thirty-two. They had all failed dismally at any attempt to complete the Finale Way.</p>

  <p>"Young man, you are bold and courageous. Perhaps you will be the one who achieves the Finale Way!" The leader of the Three Eyes race also spoke up for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"We won't yield as long as even the last shred of hope still remains..."</p>

  <p>"I agree..."</p>

  <p>The Other Shore races who had supported the Finale Way in the past all now elected to back Luo Zheng's play. Emboldened, they were even prepared to face down Claire and the Grandmaster of Heaven, and they didn't hesitate to declare their support for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The faces of Claire and the Grandmaster of Heaven both darkened as the scene unfolded.</p>

  <p>With the fall of the human civilization, these Other Shore races had also disintegrated. By necessity, the independent races like the Three Eyes race and the Swallow Victory race had all been forced to maintain low profiles because they lacked the ability to oppose the Nihility race and the Element Spirit race!</p>

  <p>However, if they were to unite under one banner, they would become such a powerful force that it could not be underestimated!</p>

  <p>Pearce and Auden were astounded by this sudden turn of events. They had never expected that Luo Zheng's words would actually manage to illicit support from so many Other Shore races. This sort of thing was simply unfathomable to them.</p>

  <p>"All of you, shut up!"</p>

  <p>Claire abruptly roared in anger.</p>

  <p>Her voice was so loud that it almost flashed like lightning through the air of the entire Grand Plain Stage. The power contained within the sound wave spread out in all directions like a living entity, flowing uninterrupted as if it was water. Her formidable strength was obvious.</p>

  <p>"That's a terrifying energy flow!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's expression changed slightly when he witnessed the surging energy.</p>

  <p>If not for the protection mechanism of the Grand Plain Stage, the roar alone would have crushed a vast majority of the creatures present into powder.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore creatures were all shocked by this display of energy, and they immediately tumbled into silence. However, despite this the Grandmaster of Heaven still appeared calm.</p>

  <p>Claire's anger was momentary, and a smile quickly appeared on her face again as she turned back to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>She would stay on her determined course of action, and besides that, she had already reached consensus with the Eye Spirit.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's refusal had humiliated her, but she still wouldn't relent.</p>

  <p>"That's fine," said Claire, taking two steps back with her hands behind her back. "I won't try to twist your arm in persuasion, but, in the end, I believe you will change your mind."</p>
