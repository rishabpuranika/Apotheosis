<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1326 Fenton Sima </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng didn't plan to stay for long in the Spiritual Force Sacred Place, and he was not particularly interested in the Myriad Spiritual Force House.</p>

  <p>But since the others had intended well, he naturally wouldn't refuse.</p>

  <p>Once Luo Luo Zheng had left, the Saint Lord of the Spiritual Force Sacred Place clapped his hands. Two old men walked over from the side of the hall.</p>

  <p>"Saint Lord, what can I do for you?" one of them asked.</p>

  <p>The Saint Lord said, "Inform Fenton and have him challenge this young man to test out his strength."</p>

  <p>A strange expression appeared on the faces of the two old men, and one of them asked curiously, "Saint Lord, you want Fenton Sima to challenge  Luo Luo Zheng Luo?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid  Luo Luo Zheng Luo is not qualified to fight Fenton," the other said disdainfully.</p>

  <p>The Saint Lord, however, nodded and said, "Fenton has already passed through the nine small Heavenly Tribulations. But it's hard to say if he will go through the tenth one. Luo Luo Zheng, however, has only passed through five small Heavenly Tribulations. He is inferior to Fenton when it comes to cultivation level. But there must have been a reason that the alliance has chosen Luo Luo Zheng. If Fenton can defeat him, I can send him into the alliance."</p>

  <p>The two old men looked on in disbelief at the Saint Lord's words. "Saint Lord, are you saying that the alliance has chosen this guy?"</p>

  <p>The Saint Lord nodded, perplexed. "Luo Luo Zheng is special, sure, but the alliance's attention on him just because of that is unusual. I don't understand this either. But the alliance will send people to pick him up, and before that happens, I want Fenton to challenge him so that I can introduce him to the alliance. If Fenton joins the alliance, there will be great benefits for him."</p>

  <p>The two old men nodded appreciatively. "You are so wise, Saint Lord!" they said in unison.</p>

  <p>Fenton Sima was the most outstanding talent of the younger generation in the Spiritual Force Sacred Place. He was the hope that sustained the whole sacred place.</p>

  <p>He hadn't reached the Soul Sea Realm yet, but had already passed the ninth small Heavenly Tribulation.</p>

  <p>Most Life and Death Realm warriors in the universe would make a breakthrough and reach the Soul Sea Realm during the fifth or sixth small Heavenly Tribulation. Some outstanding warriors even had to experience seven small Heavenly Tribulations, while other talented warriors went through eight ones. The number of warriors going through nine small Heavenly Tribulations was quite small.</p>

  <p>The more small Heavenly Tribulations one overcame, the greater their potential would be in the future.</p>

  <p>Fenton Sima had already passed through nine small Heavenly Tribulations, but he still hadn't reached the Soul Sea Realm. It was quite possible that he would attract the legendary tenth small Heavenly Tribulation.</p>

  <p>What was more, the Lotus Flower had already bloomed when Fenton Sima had experienced his first small Heavenly Tribulation. It had sprouted seven petals during his ninth small Heavenly Tribulation.</p>

  <p>This was also why the Saint Lord placed such importance on him.</p>

  <p>The alliance controlled 3000 supreme worlds. Fenton Sima was the core of the Spiritual Force Sacred Place, but with so many supreme worlds competing against each other, it would be difficult for the Saint Lord to send him into the alliance.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, in comparison, was a mere warrior who had ascended from the Lower World. But the alliance had selected him not long after he had ascended, causing the Saint Lord to look at Luo Luo Zheng dubiously.</p>

  <p>The Saint Lord was stoic before Luo Luo Zheng, but he had already made his plan, which was why he was willing to make an exception and allow Luo Luo Zheng to enter the Myriad Spiritual Force House.</p>

  <p>The Myriad Spiritual Force House was the place that all warriors in the Spiritual Force Sacred Place yearned for.</p>

  <p>But it was impossible for ordinary warriors to join the Myriad Spiritual Force House. There were probably more than one billion warriors in the entire Spiritual Force Sacred Place. However, only 9, 000 of them were able to enter the Myriad Spiritual Force House. The rule was that for a warrior to enter the Myriad Spiritual Force House, another warrior had to be expelled.</p>

  <p>Even the sixth-grade and seventh-grade clans tried all means to send their clansmen to join the Myriad Spiritual Force House. After all, entering the Myriad Spiritual Force House meant that their future would be limitless.</p>

  <p>But an exception had been made by the Myriad Spiritual Force House today. Now that they had accepted Luo Luo Zheng, there was one person more in the Myriad Spiritual Force House than the prescribed 9, 000 members. There were 9, 001 of them in there.</p>

  <p>And the extra guy was a warrior from the Lower World!</p>

  <p>This news spread at a lightning speed throughout the Holy City, making a lot of warriors green with envy.</p>

  <p>Once a seventh-grade clan, which was the richest clan in the sacred place and controlled over 2, 000 of the 4, 800 mines of the Spiritual Force Sacred Place, had spent millions of life vitality jades to send a talent from their clan to the Myriad Spiritual Force House.</p>

  <p>One could only imagine what the warriors had felt when the Saint Lord had made an exception for a warrior from the Lower World.</p>

  <p>Despite everyone being unhappy about this, they didn't dare speak up once they had heard that it was the Saint Lord's personal command.</p>

  <p>There were various kinds of cultivation methods in the Myriad Spiritual Force House. There was also the Spiritual Energy Gathering Array set up by the Saint Lord himself. The degree of purity of the life vitality provided by the array was nothing short of amazing.</p>

  <p>In addition to all these, there were countless benefits. Some warriors were stubborn enough to think that training in the Myriad Spiritual Force House would allow them to cultivate in a highly efficient way.</p>

  <p>This was indeed a legendary sacred place for cultivation.</p>

  <p>So Luo Luo Zheng was destined to attract envy the moment he stepped into the Myriad Spiritual Force House.</p>

  <p>Many clans were secretly paying attention to him, wondering if they should try drawing him to their sides. After all, the other 9, 000 talents in the Myriad Spiritual Force House all had their own origins. They were either from large clans or direct descendants of the elders of the Spiritual Force Sacred Place. Luo Luo Zheng, on the other hand, was someone who had emerged out of nowhere.</p>

  <p>However, when Luo Luo Zheng stepped into the Myriad Spiritual Force House, he did something that was quite unbelievable.</p>

  <p>The Myriad Spiritual Force House was grand. As a sacred place for cultivation in the Upper World, it was much better than the Central Region and the Divine Kingdom Continent. The vitality between heaven and earth that spread throughout the sacred place was much richer and purer, but it wouldn't be of much benefit to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had embarked on a very different path of body refinement from the very beginning, using his own body as a weapon to cultivate.</p>

  <p>After he cultivated the Primal Chaos Technique he had gotten from the fairy palace, the life vitality in his belly was completely replaced with the chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>Ordinary training methods were almost completely useless to him.</p>

  <p>He couldn't reject the Saint Lord of the Spiritual Force Sacred Place, and since the Saint Lord had asked him to wait in the Myriad Spiritual Force House, all he could do was obey.</p>

  <p>So once he had entered the Myriad Spiritual Force House, Luo Luo Zheng found a corner and sat down cross-legged. He then closed his eyes and began to meditate.</p>

  <p>Master He and Master Shen, who had led Luo Luo Zheng into the Myriad Spiritual Force House, were flabbergasted at his behavior. Both had boasted about the various benefits of the Myriad Spiritual Force House. But it looked like he was not interested in any of this. What a weirdo!</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, the cultivation places of the Myriad Spiritual Force House are extremely useful for Life and Death realm warriors," Master He couldn't help but remind him.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng merely smiled and said, "Master He, I appreciate your intentions. However, I have my own plans for the path of cultivation."</p>

  <p>The two masters knew they could not persuade Luo Luo Zheng. Now that they had brought him to the Myriad Spiritual Force House, their mission was complete. They had nothing to do with everything else that was going on. So they bade their farewells and left.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng sat in the corner and cultivated by himself, while the others glared at him, as if he was an eyesore.</p>

  <p>"This guy is probably just pretending! Do you think he is willing to leave empty-handed after entering a mountain of treasures? I don't believe it.</p>

  <p>He'll be anxiously requesting for the right to use the cultivation places in less than a day!"</p>

  <p>"That's right. Our Saint Lord is willing to make an exception for such a mere warrior from the Lower World. This is a huge favor, but he dares to put on airs!"</p>

  <p>"I really want to teach this guy a lesson!"</p>

  <p>What Luo Luo Zheng didn't know was that he had infuriated a lot of people by just sitting there.</p>

  <p>No one bothered with his training. There weren't many warriors in the Myriad Spiritual Force House. Most of them only glanced at him before leaving in a hurry.</p>

  <p>Three days passed.</p>

  <p>Those who had thought that Luo Luo Zheng was putting on airs understood that he didn't really need to train in the Myriad Spiritual Force House.</p>
