<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3078 Demonic Eyes </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Although most of Luo Zheng's questions had been explained briefly by No. 9527, he was still a little confused.</p>

  <p>"Did the Dreaded Eye Demons show up in the chaos once?" Luo Zheng asked, intrigued by this information.</p>

  <p>"Yes, you can say that. The Dreaded Eye Demons were a huge race that once occupied a region," No. 9527 answered him truthfully.</p>

  <p>"Can all kinds of races in the chaos establish temples here on the Other Shore? Are they considered as extraordinary creatures?" Luo Zheng asked again.</p>

  <p>He wanted to learn more about these creatures as much as he could.</p>

  <p>"As for the extraordinary creatures in your eyes..." No. 9527 paused for a second, making Luo Zheng do the guessing. "Strictly speaking, only those two demonic eyes of all the Dreaded Eye Demons could be described as extraordinary creatures, so what you encountered just now were only their descendants. What's more, they were very weak. With your current strength, you can't defeat a mature Dreaded Eye Demon yet."</p>

  <p>At that moment, Dorothy, who had been watching him, suddenly asked,</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, why are you standing there in a daze?"</p>

  <p>Dorothy didn't have any idea that Luo Zheng was actually communicating with No. 9527, so she thought he was standing there daydreaming.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng was finally back to the present, he decided to absorb the soul crystal with Dorothy.</p>

  <p>They would have to stay on and explore the Other Shore for a long time. No one would give up the opportunity to strengthen their souls.</p>

  <p>The two of them sat in a corner and started concentrating. It didn't take long before they both released their spiritual senses into the soul crystal.</p>

  <p>Absorbing the soul crystal gave them the same feeling as the fusion of souls. To a certain extent, they were devouring the Souls of Light of another group of people. It was just that these Souls of Light had already been purified and readied for them to use.</p>

  <p>As the two continued to absorb the soul crystal without pause, the white ball shrank at a visible speed.</p>

  <p>The auras that the two Souls of Light released were greatly enhanced.</p>

  <p>Three minutes had passed quickly.</p>

  <p>Dorothy had already withdrawn her spiritual sense. The soul crystal had already shrunk by half its original size.</p>

  <p>She and Luo Zheng had discovered the soul crystal together, so she was certainly qualified to share the soul crystal with him. However, in consideration that she still had other opportunities to strengthen her soul, she gave up the idea of continuing absorbing the soul crystal. For a moment, she just stared at Luo Zheng, who silently took in the remaining soul crystal.</p>

  <p>Ten minutes later, Luo Zheng finally absorbed the last wisps of the soul crystal.</p>

  <p>When he opened his eyes, he immediately felt the strange abundance of power cursing through his body.</p>

  <p>"This soul crystal really has an extraordinary effect!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had practiced hard day and night on the Sea of Truth for several months, and his soul power had only increased a little after all that hardship.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, after absorbing the soul crystal, he felt that his soul power had increased by at least three times. It was unbelievable.</p>

  <p>"Of course, it does!" Dorothy smiled. "You've even integrated the Souls of Light of over a hundred people."</p>

  <p>In fact, during the process where the Souls of Light were turned into the soul crystal by the Soul-melting Light, a big part of the Souls of Light were lost, so Dorothy was exaggerating when she said that, but the effects were still obvious now.</p>

  <p>After the soul crystal was totally absorbed by the two of them, they turned to look at the red glazed eyes.</p>

  <p id="top_15">"Do we take them as our Other Shore Tokens?" Luo Zheng asked. He had not forgotten that his true reason for entering the temple was to find a suitable Other Shore Token for himself.</p>

  <p>The two glazed eyes in front of him also contained extraordinary power and he could feel it.</p>

  <p>Dorothy tilted her head and looked at the eyes closely. Even though she was knowledgeable, she had no idea what they truly were. "No matter what they are, we can try and fuse them with ourselves. As long as they are not living creatures, they will not resist."</p>

  <p>"Living creatures?" Luo Zheng asked as he thought of the dead Heavenly Spider.</p>

  <p>As much as he could remember, the Heavenly Spider should have been dead for a long time now. It had been used as a puppet by the Dreaded Eye Demons. "Can I take the dead Heavenly Spider as my Other Shore Token?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, you can. Anything on the Other Shore can be taken as your token, but fusing with a dead creature isn't a wise choice. In that case, it's better to fuse with the Heavenly Cobweb it had produced," Dorothy replied.</p>

  <p>Now, since there were two glazed eyes here, she didn't need to fuse with the Heavenly Cobweb. She and Luo Zheng could have one eye each to use.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng walked towards the glazed eyes and stood in front of them. He reached out his hand to touch them for a while, and then said, "I don't know how to fuse with the Other Shore Token."</p>

  <p>Dorothy responded with a chuckle.</p>

  <p>She had always thought that Luo Zheng was a little strange. He knew a lot of things that many people wouldn't normally know, but he didn't have an inkling about the general knowledge in the Source World.</p>

  <p>"Let me teach you how to do it. It won't be too difficult to fuse with the Other Shore Token, especially such a dead thing. It won't resist you. You only need to use the Truth of Godly Way to fuse with it."</p>

  <p>As Dorothy spoke, she held up the Other Shore Token to show Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Wisps of Truth of Eternal Sword Intent emerged from her body and covered the surface of the glazed eye. But when she tried to draw it into her Soul of Light, there was suddenly a repulsive force from the glazed eye.</p>

  <p>She looked at the Other Shore Token in disbelief? she was unable to fuse with the glazed eye!</p>

  <p>"What?" Dorothy exclaimed in shock, still holding the glazed eye.</p>

  <p>"What happened?" Luo Zheng asked in confusion.</p>

  <p>"This Other Shore Token does not match the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent," Dorothy explained with her pouted lips.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean? An Other Shore Token will choose the Truth of Godly Way?" Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Dorothy exhaled and said, "It's rare. I heard that only very powerful Other Shore Tokens could choose the Truths of Divine Dao. I didn't expect this glazed eye would be one of them!"</p>

  <p>The situation proved that the glazed eye was something extraordinary and definitely powerful. It was a pity that Dorothy couldn't fuse with it.</p>

  <p>"Let me have a try!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng grabbed the glazed eye and copied Dorothy's method, activating the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent.</p>

  <p>However, just like what happened with Dorothy, when Luo Zheng tried to draw it inside his soul, the glazed eye refused to fuse with it.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng pondered over it for a while. Then he decided to stop using the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent and activated the Truth of Cultivation Nature instead.</p>

  <p>This time, the glazed eye didn't resist and easily went into Luo Zheng's soul.</p>

  <p>"It's the perfect match for the Truth of Cultivation Nature!" Dorothy blurted out in surprise.</p>

  <p>This was the advantage of cultivating two Truths of Divine Dao. Since the glazed eye did not accept one of the two Truths of Divine Dao, Luo Zheng could just use the other Truth of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>However, different people had different compatibility with each kind of Truth of Godly Way. Once a person had chosen one Truth of Godly Way to cultivate, they usually wouldn't cultivate a second Truth of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng absorbed the glazed eye into his soul, he could clearly perceive its existence in it.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng tried to manipulate the glazed eye, it rose in his Soul of Light and slowly moved into one of his own eyes.</p>

  <p>Dorothy saw that a scarlet light flashed out of Luo Zheng's blurred face.</p>

  <p>Just one glance, she let out a scream and retreated, extremely terrified.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng closed his eyes, and the demonic red light disappeared just as quickly.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng apologized, he was only trying to use the glazed eye, but he didn't expect Dorothy to have such a reaction.</p>

  <p>With the glazed eye, Luo Zheng could use the same skill that the Dreaded Eye Demons had used. It could be useful during crucial moments.</p>

  <p>Dorothy explained she didn't mind, and said, "Wow, you can stir up the fear in one's mind. It is very rare to see such an Other Shore Token in Stage One of the Other Shore. I wonder how many divine megatons the force unleashed by this eye can be."</p>

  <p>The special ability of the Other Shore Token was very important, but its own energy was just as significant. However, there was no way to test the glazed eye's ability on the Other Shore. He had to return to the Dragon City first.</p>
