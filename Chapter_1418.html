<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Although she told Zheng that she was in great trouble, she was equivocal about it and wouldn't divulge much information about the nature of her problem.</p>

  <p>He had no choice but to keep following her directions. He arrived at the appointed place and saw a residence with a pretty good environment. To his astonishment, there were four Soul Sea Realm warriors guarding the residence. He also sensed several divine textures around the house, as well as the presence of hidden auras of powerful warriors inside the building.</p>

  <p>Seeing this scene, Zheng immediately understood what was going on.</p>

  <p>Freya was imprisoned here by someone!</p>

  <p>"What are you doing here?" yelled one of the guarding warriors when he noticed Zheng.</p>

  <p>Admittedly, these warriors were not as smart as the soldiers guarding the trans-border channel. The soldiers guarding the trans-border channel had seen many warriors from different places every day. Thanks to their occupation, they had a clear understanding of mounts, which was why they were able to recognize the Heavenly Phoenix Horse at a single glance.</p>

  <p>These warriors were under the city lord's order to guard this place.</p>

  <p>Although they sensed that Zheng's horse was not an ordinary beast, they weren't afraid of offending him.</p>

  <p>Zheng frowned at their bad attitude. He raised an eyebrow and answered honestly, "I'm looking for Freya."</p>

  <p>The warriors exchanged glances with each other. They knew that Freya had just ascended from the Lower World not long ago. They couldn't figure out how Zheng knew her.</p>

  <p>"We don't know anyone by this name. Now get out of here!" The same warrior replied impatiently.</p>

  <p>But Zheng pointed towards the residence and said, "I know she's inside the building. She just sent me a message using her life vitality."</p>

  <p>Since Zheng had exposed their lies, the warriors had to give up their act.</p>

  <p>They stared at him with cold eyes and threatened, "Mind your own business! Otherwise, you'll regret coming here!"</p>

  <p>Hearing their threat, the corners of Zheng's mouth lifted to flash a contemptuous smile. "I wonder what kind of trouble it will be."</p>

  <p>"The woman inside was chosen by our city lord. She will be offered to an important figure of the Spiritual Force Sacred Place as a gift. But she is disobedient, so she has been imprisoned here! Are we clear now, you brat? Can you afford to offend the city lord?" said another arrogant warrior with narrowed eyes.</p>

  <p>They bothered to give Zheng an explanation only because he had come with his Heavenly Phoenix Horse. Although they couldn't recognize the horse, they knew that it was a strong beast. Plus, although Zheng was just at the Soul Sea Realm, his aura was extraordinary and overwhelming.</p>

  <p>If it was an ordinary warrior, they would have attacked him straightaway!</p>

  <p>"Oh, I see,"</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded. No wonder Freya had asked for his help but hadn't given any details to him.</p>

  <p>The City Lord of this Bright Sky City was Freya's uncle! Zheng couldn't understand why he wanted to sacrifice his niece after she had ascended to the Upper World.</p>

  <p>"Get out of here now! If you take too long, you won't be able to escape when we change our mind!" When the warrior saw Zheng deep in thought, he assumed that his words had the desired effect on him and a trace of pride appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Freya appeared inside the residence. Her cultivation base did not seem to have improved. Instead, there was a trace of weariness on her face.</p>

  <p>"Zheng! You have already reached the Soul Sea Realm?" Freya noticed the change in Zheng, and a bitter smile appeared on her face.</p>

  <p>In fact, she wasn't sure that Zheng would be able to rescue her.</p>

  <p>Although his performance in the mining cave had been extraordinary, he still wasn't strong enough to fight in the Upper World.</p>

  <p>However, she had made great efforts to ascend to the Upper World before turning to her uncle for shelter, only to be sacrificed by him as a human cauldron to an important figure. She had her own dreams and ambitions. How could she agree to submit to such an unfair fate?</p>

  <p>But she was only at the primary level of the Soul Sea Realm, so she didn't have the power to fight her uncle!</p>

  <p>Finally, she had been imprisoned here and wasn't even allowed to go out.</p>

  <p>What was worse, the divine textures around the residence were able to cut off all the vitality between heaven and earth. She couldn't even cultivate here!</p>

  <p>Freya was filled with remorse. If she had known this earlier, she would have continued mining with Zheng in the mines. Once she had accumulated 200 life vitality jades, she could have exchanged them for an independent warrior's identity. Although she couldn't get support from her uncle, at least she would live in this supreme world freely without being imprisoned or becoming a human cauldron.</p>

  <p>She was feeling miserable when she saw Zheng again.</p>

  <p>Never would she have imagined that their experiences in the Upper World would be so different.</p>

  <p>In a last-ditch attempt, she had asked Zheng for help through the message rune even though she knew that with his current strength, it was almost impossible for him to save her.</p>

  <p>Her uncle was the city lord and his cultivation base was at the late stage of the Spirit Supreme Realm, while Zheng was just an ordinary warrior who had ascended from the Lower World.</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled faintly at her and said, "No wonder you asked me for help. I didn't expect your uncle to imprison you!"</p>

  <p>"I used the message rune because I didn't have any other choice. But you should leave, Zheng. I don't want to get you into trouble," Freya said, shaking her head. She calmed down a little after she saw Zheng, and resigned to her ugly fate. Finding her uncle had been her own choice, while Zheng was just a friend who she met in the mines. There was no reason for him to risk everything and save her.</p>

  <p>Besides, even if Zheng wanted to save her, he probably wouldn't be able to do so.</p>

  <p>But to her surprise, he extended his hand towards her and said firmly,</p>

  <p>"Come with me. It's all right."</p>

  <p>Hearing his words, the guarding warriors' faces immediately darkened.</p>
