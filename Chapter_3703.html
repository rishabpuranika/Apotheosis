<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Click, click, click..." They were rooted to the spot as they heard a strange sound echoing inside the narrow cave.</p>

  <p>Soon after, they saw a ball rolling in circles on the ground. Finally, it stopped when it touched the wall of the cave.</p>

  <p>The ball's surface was covered all over with bronze hollow patterns. There was a red dot of light inside. Somehow, it looked like it was beating.</p>

  <p>Plop! Plop! Plop! They heard a curious sound coming from it.</p>

  <p>It seemed as though the light dot was beating like an actual heart. It contracted and relaxed with each heartbeat.</p>

  <p>Ziya was absolutely stunned when he saw Geoffrey return all by himself.</p>

  <p>As his eyes settled upon the ball on the ground, his expression seemed blank.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the expressions of the Primeval Lord of Heaven, the Snake Goddess, and the others changed drastically. They were standing on the other side of the cave and were utterly bewildered when they saw the ball.</p>

  <p>"I-is that the Heart of Limit?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked tentatively.</p>

  <p>"No, it can't be that Heart of Limit!" The Snake Goddess couldn't believe it either.</p>

  <p>"The Element Spirit race has already destroyed that one, remember? Where does it come from?" The other beings whispered among each other.</p>

  <p>They couldn't quite contain their excitement and it showed in their curious faces.</p>

  <p>The Heart of Limit was an Other Shore Token. It was well-known that the human race possessed this artifact before.</p>

  <p>Long ago, the human ancestor bore the Heart of Limit. Afterwards, he used it as his own heart.</p>

  <p>During that time, the most powerful Other Shore Tokens had been in the possession of the human race. It could even be said that the human race itself was the strongest weapon that existed in the chaos.</p>

  <p>Even though the human race had failed to complete the Finale Way, they were actually very close to attaining success.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the tremendous efforts of the human race had attracted the unwanted attention of the Element Spirit race. Later, both the Heart of Limit and the Overdraft Stone were destroyed.</p>

  <p>Judging from the reaction of the Element Spirit race, the Primeval Lord of Heaven deduced that the human race had made the right choice, but something was missing. Unfortunately, they didn't find new substitutes after the Heart of Limit and the Overdraft Stone were destroyed.</p>

  <p>This meant that the once perfect plan of the human race could no longer be fulfilled. No one would be able to complete the Finale Way.</p>

  <p>But to everyone's surprise, Geoffrey had successfully brought back a Heart of Limit from outside the chaos! Clearly, they weren't expecting to see it once again.</p>

  <p>Even Luo Zheng expressed his concern as he gazed at the ball. He was completely taken aback by this turn of event as well.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey couldn't help but feel a little uncomfortable being stared at by these powerful warriors. He could feel their truly overwhelming and terrifying auras around him. He felt a bit scared so he stepped back cautiously. Then, he asked, "Why are you all staring at me like this?"</p>

  <p>As he said this, the powerful warriors regained their senses. The Primeval Lord of Heaven squeezed through the narrow cave and picked up the Heart of Limit. With a serious look, he turned to Geoffrey and asked, "Where did you get this Heart of Limit?"</p>

  <p>Geoffrey pursed his lips. "Well, I just went to the star, oh wait, I mean the Abstruse Energy World. Then, I just picked it up there," he answered nonchalantly.</p>

  <p>"Wait, what? You are able to pick up the things there?" Ziya asked him sharply. He turned to Geoffrey with such a piercing look.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey looked at Ziya confusedly. "Uh, yes. It's fairly easy for me," he replied.</p>

  <p>"Did you untie the rope by yourself?" Ziya asked, getting more and more bewildered.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Geoffrey answered simply and shrugged.</p>

  <p>With that, Ziya was rendered utterly speechless.</p>

  <p>Being able to move freely within the Abstruse Energy World was an absolutely complicated matter for the creatures in the chaos. Therefore, what Geoffrey did was an incredible feat.</p>

  <p>The moment people entered the Abstruse Energy World, it became extremely difficult for them to think straight. Thus, it was much more difficult to move freely.</p>

  <p>For instance, Luo Zheng and the others were unable to distinguish space and time.</p>

  <p>If it wasn't for their keen observation of the light dots, they wouldn't know.</p>

  <p>They could not tell their exact position, distance, or even how long they had been staying in the Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>Ziya instantly regarded the Snake Goddess as a highly talented being due to her ability to see the mountain from the very first time she entered the Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>Being able to enter the mountain, touch it, and even dig out what was inside required countless years of adaptation and repeated practice. Even Ziya himself was unable to do this smoothly and without much thought.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Luo Zheng's son was able to untie the rope right after he went in. He could also pick up a Heart of Limit without a hitch. Ziya felt like he was dreaming because this kind of thing seemed a little unreal. It was truly extraordinary.</p>

  <p>However, he quickly calmed himself down and gathered his senses.</p>

  <p>"Geoffrey, where does this Heart of Limit come from? Did you find it in the mountain?" He asked with unabated curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Mountain, huh? There is nothing but a pile of mud in the place of that so-called mountain," Geoffrey said with obvious disdain.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>Ziya was rendered speechless once more. It took a while before he continued, "Well, did you cross that mountain?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I did. And there seems to be a river behind it..."</p>

  <p>Ziya, who had already calmed down, interjected loudly once again before Geoffrey could even finish his sentence, "River? You saw a river?" This whole thing sounded really incredulous to Ziya.</p>

  <p>"I did," Geoffrey answered affirmatively.</p>

  <p>Ziya took a deep breath and ran his hand through his forehead.</p>

  <p>Indeed, there were many light dots flowing behind the mountain. Ziya had even made several assumptions about what those light dots were and made a plan to cross them.</p>

  <p>However, the speed at which the light dots changed was too fast for him. He could neither decipher them nor cross them at all!</p>

  <p>What he didn't expect was that it was actually a flowing river!</p>

  <p>It had been extremely difficult for Ziya to decipher the light dots. On the other hand, Geoffrey was immediately knew what they were with just a single glance. He was certainly remarkable.</p>

  <p>Seeing that everyone was still staring at him, Geoffrey explained everything to them at one go, "After crossing the river, I realized that the rope was too short. So I untied it and found this on a platform in the depths of the grassland."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he gestured at the Heart of Limit.</p>

  <p>He actually didn't know what the Heart of Limit was used for. Nonetheless, he still brought it back by himself.</p>

  <p>If they wanted to take it, he would agree. As long as they gave him some good things in exchange for it, he had no problem giving it away.</p>

  <p>Ziya had no idea what Geoffrey was thinking. He just smiled at Luo Zheng and said, "I didn't expect that you have such a highly talented son. This is astonishing."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had anchored his great hope upon his son. After all, he knew that Geoffrey was highly talented in deciphering Sanskrit words.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, he hadn't anticipated that Geoffrey would be this outstanding.</p>

  <p>It was his first time to enter the Abstruse Energy World. And already, he was able to bring back a Heart of Limit!</p>

  <p>It was from Ziya that Luo Zheng heard about the origin of the Heart of Limit before. It was a very important Other Shore Token even in Stage Thirty-three.</p>

  <p>"Well, my son seems to..."</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng was about to praise Geoffrey, a dense stream of radiant starlight suddenly surged towards them from the Abstruse Energy World outside the cave.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>With so much starlight pouring in, it meant that something was hurtling towards the cave.</p>

  <p>As Ziya saw the stream of dazzling starlight, his expression suddenly changed.</p>

  <p>As it poured in from the Abstruse Energy World, it immediately turned into grayish brown tentacles and directly swept towards the people inside the cave.</p>

  <p>"Let's go! Now!"</p>

  <p>Ziya shouted as he lifted his hand instantaneously.</p>

  <p>A powerful airflow instantly exploded inside the narrow cave. The airflow pushed everyone backwards and into the Deleting Space.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! The grayish brown tentacles kept on pursuing them and sweeping the area.</p>

  <p>As those tentacles broke through the cave, they rapidly expanded and extended. Then, they followed the people towards the Deleting Space.</p>

  <p>"Take this!"</p>

  <p>Ziya stretched out his fingers and made a cut in the air.</p>

  <p>There were invisible forces that intertwined constantly and pierced the space.</p>

  <p>It seemed like Ziya had summoned an invisible cutter.</p>

  <p>The invisible cutter continued to slice at the tentacles that were now frenziedly pouring out of the cave into pieces.</p>
