<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Over a million people crawled through the area, tirelessly offering their Faith Energy. Even after spending a year, they were only able to form a sliver of it.</p>

  <p>Only a third of the sphere was filled with the Faith Energy, which was offered by millions of people praying day and night.</p>

  <p>The Ancestral Dragon was now hidden behind the stone pillar, moving upward.</p>

  <p>After some time, it arrived at the top of the pillar where a convenient, spherical-shaped container held the Faith Energy.</p>

  <p>It was a unique divine weapon that could contain Faith Energy, but that was nothing to the Ancestral Dragon. It simply opened its mouth wide and bit into it.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>A crisp sound resounded from the middle of the plaza.</p>

  <p>The Ancestral Dragon bit into the bottom of the container, leaving a hole in the surface. The green Faith Energy easily poured into its mouth.</p>

  <p>All the creatures on the plaza raised their heads, stunned speechless.</p>

  <p>All of them were kowtowing with sincerity, completely ignoring the outside world. When Luo Luo Zheng had fought the golden-armored warriors, no one was even curious enough to take a look at them. In their eyes, any distraction would mean them desecrating their god.</p>

  <p>But now, their god embryo was broken.</p>

  <p>All the believers were stunned in silence.</p>

  <p>Their god represented everything to them.</p>

  <p>How could their god embryo possibly be broken?</p>

  <p>Soon after, everyone heard the sound of huge gulps of water being swallowed, the Faith Energy in the container visibly decreasing.</p>

  <p>"What is that?"</p>

  <p>"Someone is stealing our Faith Energy!"</p>

  <p>"Just what is that thing?"</p>

  <p>All the corners on the square were thrown into a mess.</p>

  <p>To all the believers, the outside world was of no importance? only their own faith mattered. The green liquid in the sphere was proof of that faith. Over a million people spent years in there to form the liquid, and it almost hurt how easily it was swallowed up in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>It wasn't only the believers. The other powerful warriors within the shrine were also startled speechless. Several white-robed warriors flew out from the depths of the shrine and took a look at the container before their expressions filled with exasperation.</p>

  <p>The Faith Energy they had painstakingly accumulated for years upon years just disappeared in an instant.</p>

  <p>In truth, the Luster Force Secret Sect wasn't particularly heavily guarded.</p>

  <p>Although the Faith Energy was a precious resource, no warrior would try to steal it? it was essentially useless to regular warriors.</p>

  <p>Soon, the believers began to chase after a strangely-shaped creature.</p>

  <p>Various kinds of Law Powers rumbled inside, but even the Spirit Supreme Realm warriors couldn't do anything about it. They couldn't even cause the slightest harm to the Ancestral Dragon. As this tiny dragon circled around, its face revealed a trace of satisfaction. Of course, the creature was utterly satisfied after swallowing up all the Faith Energy.</p>

  <p>"What's going on?" Freya asked Luo Luo Zheng after hearing the huge commotion.</p>

  <p>With a smile, Luo Luo Zheng shrugged. "Maybe someone went crazy. I wonder if the god they believe in will give them comfort."</p>

  <p>The uproar lasted for quite a while before gradually coming to a halt.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a small crack surfaced under Luo Zheng's feet before the small body of the Ancestral Dragon slithered back up and leaped into Luo Zheng's embrace.</p>

  <p>"Caw?caw?"</p>

  <p>After devouring the Faith Energy, the Ancestral Dragon seemed to be in a pleasant mood.</p>

  <p>News about the stolen Faith Energy in the Luster Force Secret Sect had spread like wildfire.</p>

  <p>There were many secret sects in Auspice City as the human race had already assigned different sects to take in believers of different sorts and accumulate Faith Energy.</p>

  <p>While the Faith Energy was useless to ordinary warriors, after a certain amount of Faith Energy was accumulated, it could be made to refine peerless weapons. Because of this, apart from the Demon Night, other races used all sorts of methods to gather Faith Energy. When the other secret sects heard the news, they easily took pleasure in the Luster Force Secret Sect's misfortune. But in the next moment, all the Faith Energy in Auspice City was robbed by the Ancestral Dragon.</p>

  <p>In order to deal with the creature, two of the secret sects hid their Faith Energy in an especially remote place, sending dozens of Spirit Supreme Realm warriors to watch over the Faith Energy. But they still couldn't avoid the Ancestral Dragon's uniquely strong sense of smell.</p>

  <p>During this period, Luo Luo Zheng spent some supreme life vitality crystals to purchase a mansion in the city and stayed there for some time.</p>

  <p>After the Ancestral Dragon devoured a satisfying amount of Faith Energy, the little guy easily fell back into a deep sleep. No matter what Luo Luo Zheng did, the creature didn't budge? it was as limp as a snake in hibernation.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon told Luo Luo Zheng that after the Ancestral Dragon accumulated enough Faith Energy, it could complete its first evolution, after which, it should look more like a fully-fledged dragon instead of its current seahorse-like shape.</p>

  <p>After a few days, Freya returned from her travel.</p>

  <p>She had spent the past few days helping Luo Luo Zheng gather information about the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>There weren't many Demon Night members in Auspice City. After all, the race wasn't good at dealing with other kinds. But if one race wanted to survive in a supreme world, it was inevitable to trade with other races.</p>

  <p>"In the Dark World, there's a tenth-grade sacred place belonging to the Demon Night called the Purple Bamboo Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>But it has less than a hundred thousand Demon Night members dispatched to Auspice City.</p>

  <p>Most of them stay in the north of the city," Freya explained.</p>

  <p>Of course, it was Luo Luo Zheng who had asked Freya to collect information. He had promised Xun he would help her return to the throne, after all.</p>

  <p>Xun's plan consisted of investing a large amount of resources on Luo Luo Zheng to help him cultivate and gathering her previous subordinates.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng had a special Roaring Token. In the past, so long as Xun used the token to gather her previous subordinates, the Demon Night members in the entire universe would have listened to her. Even now, although the number of Demon Night members willing to follow Xun wasn't large by any means, it was still not too small either. But it would still be difficult to gather them openly through the Roaring Token? doing it in private was their best choice for the time being.</p>

  <p>After analyzing the information Freya had provided, Luo Luo Zheng left her to take care of the mansion and rushed to the northern part of Auspice City by himself.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng headed north, the number of Demon Night members along his way increased. The surrounding architecture seemed to shift into something else entirely different from the rest of Auspice City.</p>

  <p>The places where ogres lived were rather rough? they liked using blood-red iron flame rocks to construct buildings. Inside the black bricks, faint red flames seemed to flow, giving onlookers a feeling of vigor.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, humans' architecture stood very neat, horizontal and vertical, and well-organized.</p>

  <p>But the north of the city, the gathering place of many Demon Night members, was made up of massive forests. The roads narrowed into the ground, and even the roots of plants could easily make one stumble over them.</p>

  <p>If any other race were to enter the place, it would probably be deemed troublesome. But for Demon Night members who lived on the holy trees since birth, it was no issue.</p>

  <p>But the other races wouldn't simply rashly barge into the Demon Night's gathering place. Naturally, Luo Zheng's sudden arrival earned many surprised gazes from the Demon Night members.</p>

  <p>It was a rather good thing that Luo Luo Zheng had Xun as a guide. Under her instruction, he found the central area of the settlement. It was a huge tree with a height of a thousand feet.</p>

  <p>The area was not a sacred place of the Demon Night, so it was naturally impossible for a holy tree to have been settled there. But the appearance of such a massive tree in Auspice City made people rack their brains for an explanation.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Luo Zheng approached, two Demon Night members stood in his way.</p>

  <p>One of them gripped a long spear in her hand as she pointed it at his chest. "Halt, human!"</p>

  <p>"What brought you here? Is there someone you are looking for?" the other woman asked.</p>

  <p>Only a few number of humans had visited the Demon Night's gathering area. And when they did, it was only for business. The Demon Night had a specific group of warriors responsible for dealing with the other races.</p>
