<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1726 The Bane Of Nathan's Life </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Nathan was not the one who was most surprised at the moment.</p>

  <p>It was Lucille and the entire Ji Clan who were staring in shock.</p>

  <p>Lucille had transmitted the Ji Clan's secret technique of extracting magnetic power to Luo Zheng in exchange for Zheng's Blood Refinement Technique to refine the Magnetic Sacred Mountain.</p>

  <p>Lucille thought this was a great deal.</p>

  <p>She had given the jade slip that recorded the secret technique to Luo Zheng fairly recently. But Luo Zheng had already mastered it!</p>

  <p>His speed was astonishing.</p>

  <p>The members of the Ji Clan were shocked to see Luo Zheng had refined the Magnetic Sacred Mountain. It seemed like their surprises weren't yet over.</p>

  <p>The Ji Clan also had a Magnetic Sacred Mountain. They had never heard of anyone throughout the universe who could refine the mountain.</p>

  <p>The patriarch of the Ji Clan stared at Zheng's Magnetic Sacred Mountain and then looked at the cyan light in his hand before he said flatly,</p>

  <p>"Lucille taught Luo Zheng the secret technique that I created."</p>

  <p>"What?" The expression on the clan leader's face shifted.</p>

  <p>It would be a felony if the secret technique of the Ji Clan spread out.</p>

  <p>Why was Lucille so stupid? He wanted to plead for Lucille right away.</p>

  <p>Lucille might be the most outstanding ace talent of the Ji Clan. But if she had really taught Luo Zheng the secret technique, even the patriarch would not forgive her.</p>

  <p>The patriarch shook his head and continued, "Lucille is intelligent. If she was willing to give Luo Zheng the secret technique, she must have a reason for doing so."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he continued to stare at the Magnetic Sacred Mountain beneath Zheng's feet, as if absorbed in thought.</p>

  <p>Thoughts swirled inside the Ji Clan leader's head. At the patriarch's words, he naturally understood what was going on.</p>

  <p>It was impossible for Lucille to spread the secret technique at will.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Magnetic Sacred Mountains were extremely rare. There were only ten of them or so in the entire universe. It was close to impossible for an ordinary person to practice this technique without a Magnetic Sacred Mountain.</p>

  <p>And here, Luo Zheng had refined a Magnetic Sacred Mountain, and Lucille had taught him the secret technique.</p>

  <p>The most obvious possibility was that Lucille and Luo Zheng had finished an exchange.</p>

  <p>The laws in the Magnetic Sacred Mountain were a mess, and it was impervious to everything. What kind of technique was needed to refine it? If Lucille had really gotten the technique in exchange, it would have profited the Ji Clan.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng is indeed a genius. He was able to extract the magnetic power in such a short period of time. Nathan will probably be in trouble. He can see through the laws of all things. But I'm afraid he won't be able to see through the magnetic power," the leader of the Ji Clan said calmly.</p>

  <p>Just as he predicted, Nathan saw the ball of magnetic power in Zheng's hand and frowned.</p>

  <p>After he had comprehended the Truth Godly Way, Supreme Lord of Original Sin had told him that the Truth Godly Way was a rule-making technique that also possessed the power to break rules. However, the Five Elements Godly Way that the girl from the Ji Clan cultivated could easily restrain him.</p>

  <p>The Five Elements Godly Way was inseparable. If he were to meet an opponent who also cultivated the Five Elements Godly Way, he probably wouldn't be able to see through the flaws in it.</p>

  <p>Right now, to Nathan, the Magnetic Sacred Mountain was a whole entity, with a single bright white speck of light. It was the same with the magnetic power in Zheng's hand. There was not the slightest flaw.</p>

  <p>"How could this fellow possess the Ji Clan's technique?" As he gritted his teeth, his gaze shifted and landed on Lucille.</p>

  <p>When Lucille saw Nathan's gaze shift over, she waved a hand helplessly.</p>

  <p>She had not expected Luo Zheng to enter the final battle and face off against Nathan. If she had known this, she would have waited until the Illusion Battlefield was over before she brought up the exchange with Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>And then, Luo Zheng moved.</p>

  <p>Nathan's spear light could destroy almost everything. Even though Luo Zheng had used the power of the Thunderbolt Annihilation to gain some advantage, Nathan had still broken it pretty easily.</p>

  <p>Since the Magnetic Sacred Mountain could restrain Nathan, it was time for Luo Zheng to launch a counterattack.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng flipped backwards on the mountain top and floated in the air. The Magnetic Sacred Mountain then slid down along the Heaven Earth Board for a distance before the huge mountain shot out and pressed down directly on Nathan.</p>

  <p>A whirring sound could be heard.</p>

  <p>It wouldn't have been a big deal if it had been an ordinary mountain.</p>

  <p>Nathan could destroy ten ordinary mountains with a single spear strike.</p>

  <p>But the Magnetic Sacred Mountain didn't have any flaws. All he could do as it drew nearer was run.</p>

  <p>He ran quickly, and in a burst of shadows, his body disappeared from where he stood.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>A loud sound echoed and the entire Heaven Earth Board was crushed to pieces.</p>

  <p>Nathan succeeded in avoiding the crush and appeared on the other side of the Magnetic Sacred Mountain.</p>

  <p>"There you are. Let's end the battle now!"</p>

  <p>The ball of cyan light in Zheng's hand had condensed a long time ago. The moment Nathan appeared, he waved his hand and the ball of light turned into a thin line that shot straight towards Nathan.</p>

  <p>The sword light full of sharp magnetic power was unbelievably fast as it made its way to Nathan.</p>

  <p>Just as Nathan steadied himself, he sensed an impending crisis and suddenly rolled aside.</p>

  <p>The magnetic power pierced through his face, blood spurting out in all directions.</p>

  <p>It left a gaping, bloody mark on his face.</p>

  <p>There was no change in Zheng's expression.</p>

  <p>If Nathan had wanted to reverse the situation, just one spear would have worked. Luo Zheng would not have been able to block his terrifying spear, so he had to suppress him, giving him no chance to fight back.</p>

  <p>The Magnetic Sacred Mountain behind Luo Zheng rose up and he stood on top of it, once again pushing down fiercely towards Nathan.</p>

  <p>All the while, Luo Zheng kept drawing out the magnetic power.</p>

  <p>But Nathan had suffered once and had no intention of making a second mistake.</p>

  <p>So this time, he rushed towards the Magnetic Sacred Mountain like a lithe bat. Before the mountain could come crashing onto the board, he charged from the other side of the mountain to circle above it.</p>

  <p>Once he had confirmed Zheng's location on the mountain, he sent his long spear shooting straight at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Nathan hadn't thought that he would be at such a disadvantage against Luo Zheng. And right now, he was ready to risk everything.</p>

  <p>The tip of his spear was shining with a purple light.</p>

  <p>"Law Spear Strike! Die!"</p>

  <p>Illusory purple spears shot out in three directions like three long snakes.</p>

  <p>They crawled down towards the ground, turned ninety degrees, and shot explosively towards Luo Zheng from three different directions.</p>

  <p>Any spear could hit Luo Zheng and destroy him.</p>

  <p>If Nathan had one chance, he would be able to grab a complete victory.</p>

  <p>This was the technique of the Truth Godly Way.</p>

  <p>Nathan and his three spear shadows quickly grew larger in Zheng's eyes.</p>

  <p>His body didn't pause even for a moment.</p>

  <p>He knew how powerful these spear shadows were.</p>

  <p>He climbed upwards along the Magnetic Sacred Mountain, the three purple spears following close behind.</p>

  <p>The two of them followed each other as they continued to circle the mountain. It was beginning to become too much for the others to take it all in.</p>

  <p>"In the end, who has the advantage?"</p>

  <p>"I can't say for sure. Luo Zheng seems to be afraid of Nathan's spear skills, but his mountain seems invincible."</p>

  <p>"I can't see their figures clearly anymore."</p>

  <p>While Nathan was chasing after Luo Zheng, the first purple spear shadow took the shortest way to block Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>As the spear came to block Luo Zheng, the cyan magnetic power in Zheng's hand suddenly changed, transforming into a crystal shield the size of a palm, protecting Luo Zheng. With this shield before him, Luo Zheng charged ahead, regardless of the spear.</p>

  <p>Nathan smirked as he watched Luo Zheng court death and not dodge the spear.</p>

  <p>The thought had just sprouted in his mind when he saw Luo Zheng shatter the purple spear shadow. He was shocked. How was this possible?</p>

  <p>This caused Nathan to hesitate, his usually rock-like confidence wavering. Luo Zheng had used his own body to withstand his Law Spear Strike!</p>

  <p>He began to realize that he was playing a losing game.</p>

  <p>And when Luo Zheng turned around, he saw a small cyan crystal shield in Zheng's hand. He couldn't help but curse, 'This guy is really the bane of my life!'</p>
