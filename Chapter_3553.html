<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>When Yan and Natalie saw the true face of the so-called stage ruler, they frowned. It was unsettling.</p>

  <p>There must be some sort of reason as to why these black monkeys brought them to their stage ruler.</p>

  <p>It was not for the first time that the Chief Flag Monkey had encountered the stage ruler. He knew that the Dark Nether Bugs were a kind of food that the stage ruler would not refuse, but it was a well-known fact that the Dark Nether Bugs were very difficult to capture.</p>

  <p>The candles that were used to capture Dark Nether Bugs by the Insect Master race, or any other race for that matter, were all supplied by the Royal Monkeys.</p>

  <p>He had been doing this for so many years, in order to make use of this stage ruler in case of a tricky situation.</p>

  <p>"Stage ruler, I have worked hard to collect these Dark Nether Bugs. Please accept them," the Chief Flag Monkey said, bowing deeply.</p>

  <p>"Well, tell me, what's your purpose? And why did you bring two Souls of Light?" The stage ruler's eyes fell on Natalie and Yan. As a purified being, he could instantly perceive that the two girls came from the Light Region.</p>

  <p>Glancing indifferently at the two girls, the Chief Flag Monkey answered,</p>

  <p>"These two are also an offering from the Royal Monkey race."</p>

  <p>The stage ruler sneered. "You want me to devour the Souls of Light? Well, it's better than nothing..."</p>

  <p>When he finished speaking, he stuck his tongue out towards Yan and Natalie. The two girls shut their eyes tight, awaiting their deaths. They knew they were no match for such a powerful being.</p>

  <p>Just as the stage ruler was about to devour the two girls, the Chief Flag Monkey suddenly cried out, "Please wait!"</p>

  <p>"What?" A dangerous light flashed in the stage ruler's eyes. It peeved him whenever anyone stopped him from eating his food. The only thing keeping this insolent monkey alive was the fact that he had offered him Dark Nether Bugs for many times in the past.</p>

  <p>"I offer these two Souls of Light to you, not for you to eat," the Chief Flag Monkey explained carefully.</p>

  <p>Looking at the monkey in confusion, the stage ruler asked, "Then, what do you want to do?"</p>

  <p>"These two are just bait. They will lure another purified being who is lurking around the Dark Region. I believe that you will be more interested in this purified being," the Chief Flag Monkey continued.</p>

  <p>"Another purified being..."</p>

  <p>Since he was one himself, the stage ruler of course knew the rules of purified beings very well.</p>

  <p>Once he became a purified being, he was bound to this stage of the Other Shore. There shouldn't have been another purified being in Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>"You know the price you would have to pay if you're lying to me," the stage ruler said, curling up the tongue in his mouth. The killing intent in his eyes was like a solid mist thickening.</p>

  <p>As the commander of the Royal Monkey race, the Chief Flag Monkey knew that he had to keep calm. Confidently, he answered, "I dare not lie to you.</p>

  <p>That purified being came from Stage Thirteen of the Other Shore. We don't know how she entered the Desire World. But just a few days ago, that purified being used the Great Sanskrit Light to erode everything within a radius of a hundred miles!"</p>

  <p>The stage ruler fixed his eyes on the Chief Flag Monkey and looked somewhat curious when he saw the monkey seemed quite sure of what he had said. At the same time, he said slowly, "You are so foxy. You can't contend with that purified being, so you want me to fight for you, right?"</p>

  <p>Although the stage ruler seldom went outside, he was not stupid after all.</p>

  <p>Obviously, the Royal Monkeys wanted to make use of his strength to kill that purified being.</p>

  <p>Unflinchingly, the Chief Flag Monkey answered calmly, "I thought you would be interested in another purified being, and... it is true, we are not strong enough to defeat her." With eyes narrowing slightly, he continued,</p>

  <p>"Stage ruler, if you are unwilling to face that purified being, I will take these two Souls of Light away..."</p>

  <p>The Chief Flag Monkey was, however, very certain that the stage ruler wouldn't turn away from this opportunity.</p>

  <p>"You've already brought them here, so just let them stay," the stage ruler said hastily.</p>

  <p>The Chief Flag Monkey could not help but internally sneer at the stage ruler. He was acting the exact way he had expected him to. Turning to his followers, the Chief Flag Monkey barked, "Send the two human Souls of Light here under escort! And Seal them here!"</p>

  <p>After putting down the Dark Nether Bugs, several Royal Monkeys stepped forward and escorted Yan and Natalie down. Another Royal Monkey drew a trap array on the ground. Then Yan and Natalie were pushed into the trap array by the Royal Monkeys.</p>

  <p>"Stage ruler, please enjoy the food." The Chief Flag Monkey bowed with a courteous smile on his face. Then, he hurriedly led the other Royal Monkeys away.</p>

  <p>The Chief Flag Monkey didn't care which purified being would win and which would lose. He was only afraid that when the two purified beings fought, the heaven and earth would be destroyed as a result, so he didn't want to stay here to find out.</p>

  <p>Sitting inside the trap array, Yan and Natalie exchanged silent glances.</p>

  <p>Judging from the Royal Monkey's words, they were nothing but disposable bait to lure another purified being here.</p>

  <p>"Who on earth is that purified being?" Natalie asked in a low voice.</p>

  <p>Yan shook her head, also at a loss.</p>

  <p>It had been kept a secret that Feng Ge was a purified being. The warriors from the Li Shan mountain had no idea about this, which was why Yan and Natalie were so confused.</p>

  <p>Besides, it never crossed Yan's mind that Feng Ge would enter the Dark Region to rescue her.</p>

  <p>"Will it be your elder brother?" Natalie suddenly asked, eyes flashing excitedly.</p>

  <p>Yan thought for a moment. It wouldn't be a surprise, in a sense, since Luo Zheng was always going on adventures and things always seemed to happen to him.</p>

  <p>Moreover, it made sense that if Yan was kidnapped, Luo Zheng wouldn't hesitate to rescue her.</p>

  <p>"No way..." Yan whispered.</p>

  <p>Even though she was in grave danger, she didn't want her brother to get into trouble in the Dark Region because of her.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the stage ruler's long tongue shot out like lightning and curled around a Dark Nether Bug that lay next to the two girls. In the blink of an eye, the stage ruler had sucked it into his mouth. After chewing it thoughtfully, he swallowed it and smiled in satisfaction.</p>

  <p>Both Natalie and Yan watched in horror, but there was nothing they could do since they were trapped in the array.</p>

  <p>In a matter of seconds, the stage ruler devoured all the Dark Nether Bugs.</p>

  <p>Seeing he had eaten all the food, he sat down on the side of the swamp, eyeing the two girls curiously. "The Darkness Fruits in your bodies could only last for around six hours." Then, he smiled mischievously. "It seems the monkeys were under the impression that the other purified being would come by then."</p>

  <p>"I don't know about that," Natalie replied coldly.</p>

  <p>The stage ruler just smiled. No longer asking any other question, he waited patiently by the side of the swamp.</p>

  <p>Three hours passed by.</p>

  <p>The stage ruler's eyes rolled around in a bored fashion, then suddenly, he sat up vigilantly. Looking towards the distance, he let a smile creep on his face.</p>

  <p>Without any warning, he opened his mouth and his tongue shot out into the darkness.</p>

  <p>Yan and Natalie craned their necks to turn around to look at where the stage ruler was sticking out his tongue, but they couldn't see anything.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The tongue stuck out then retracted, and once again stuck out, retracted...</p>

  <p>This went on for a while. However, it was fruitless. On the contrary, bloodstains appeared on his tongue, which had obviously been cut by a sharp weapon.</p>

  <p>Yan and Natalie exchanged confused glances.</p>

  <p>They wondered who the stage ruler was fighting with. The newcomer seemed so powerful that even the ruler of a stage of the Other Shore couldn't seem to do anything about it, and was instead wounded!</p>
