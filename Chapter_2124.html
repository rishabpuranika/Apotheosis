<br/><br/>

  

  <p>An intense passion was reflected in Thomson's black eyes. It almost seemed that a wildfire had lit up in his pupils.</p>

  <p>As he looked at Thomson's resolute gaze, Zheng's heart was moved.</p>

  <p>Thomson was like him in his early years, firm and decisive. Such a dedicated character was very respectable.</p>

  <p>Whether it was the warrior spirit or the Godly Way, in truth, it was a path of continuous growth. Zheng himself didn't know whether there was an end to that path either. However, once warriors set foot in the path of martial arts, they must try hard to make progress. The improvement of their strength and cultivation was an integral part of their lives.</p>

  <p>If Thomson only wanted to protect Misty Mountain Village, there was no need for him to acknowledge Zheng as his master. It would be enough for Thomson to diligently practice by himself.</p>

  <p>"Sorry. You are very passionate. I commend you for that. However, for now, I can't take you as my disciple," Zheng said with a regretful smile.</p>

  <p>"Not now, but when?" Thomson asked, his eyes flashed with glee. He was surprised that Zheng didn't refuse him directly.</p>

  <p>Zheng took a deep breath and looked up at the sky above the Vast Sky Region. A brilliant sun shone across the sky and emitted an intense light.</p>

  <p>That was a true sun, and also the only sun in the divine land.</p>

  <p>After some thought, Zheng looked deeply at Thomson's passionate eyes.</p>

  <p>He then replied with a kind voice, "If one day you hear my name in the Vast Sky Region, come look for me."</p>

  <p>Zheng had come for revenge, so the probability of his death was very high.</p>

  <p>The enemies he wanted to defeat and might encounter were dangerously strong.</p>

  <p>If he could one day defend himself against Murphy, then he would have the qualifications to establish his own sect within the divine land. He would be able to protect his family by then.</p>

  <p>"Is that the day when you become famous in the Vast Sky Region?"</p>

  <p>Thomson laughed as he gave a playful remark. However, deep in his heart, he believed Zheng could achieve something as incredible as that.</p>

  <p>"That is way too difficult." Woolley twitched his mouth. He felt that although proving godly warriors were powerful, they were not True Gods yet. Although the Vast Sky Region was not that big, there were still a lot of True Gods within it. Even if Zheng actually became a True God, it would be still difficult for him to become famous in the Vast Sky Region.</p>

  <p>Woolley didn't know that what Zheng wanted was not just to become famous in a certain region, but to gain a foothold in the divine land, on the Floating Islands of the Time Sea and in the Hall of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>Zheng's ambition was not just to achieve prestige but to gain and develop his own territory and influence.</p>

  <p>"It's alright. I can wait! Master, I believe that you can do that!" Thomson was full of confidence in Zheng. The expression on Thomson's face was full of admiration.</p>

  <p>Thomson's heartfelt remark made Zheng slightly smile. Zheng was about to speak when he suddenly heard a miserable scream from the village entrance. "Ah..."</p>

  <p>As the horrendous scream echoed through the village, it immediately alarmed all the people in Misty Mountain Village.</p>

  <p>"Help!"</p>

  <p>"The Sun Moon Village has arrived!"</p>

  <p>"Many people are killed!"</p>

  <p>These divine citizens were not warriors. As they witnessed the death of people around them, they immediately panicked like ants on a hot pan.</p>

  <p>The villagers of Misty Mountain Village also wailed in grief as they fled.</p>

  <p>Panic invaded their minds as they covered their faces with their hands and ran helplessly.</p>

  <p>Let alone the ordinary divine citizens, even Woolley, who was at the Spirit Transformation Realm, had a face full of panic. His eyes reflected his fear. With a scared voice, he said, "They have really come."</p>

  <p>The only one who remained calm was Zheng. Due to his significant experience in combat and war, his battle instincts were well developed.</p>

  <p>He slightly furrowed his brows and rushed to the top of the house. On his way, he gently lifted the wooden sword on the ground to the air with the tip of his foot. Afterward, Zheng leaped up to the top of the house with the wooden sword in his hand.</p>

  <p>Zheng was like a grasshopper as he quickly jumped up to the top of the house. With his high set of skills, his speed was unparalleled. He was as nimble as a cat and didn't make the slightest sound.</p>

  <p>In a few seconds, he had already reached the village entrance. With a quick glance, he was able to assess the situation of the village. A trace of fury immediately surged out from within his eyes as he saw the village's predicament.</p>

  <p>At the entrance of Misty Mountain Village, a group of seven warriors with large cyan sabers blocked the road in unison. Under their feet were two divine citizens from Misty Mountain Village. With further inspection, the two citizens were already mutilated corpses. One of them had his neck cut off, while the other was directly cut in half. The sight was too horrible to look at.</p>

  <p>"Humph! Our leader gave you three months to leave Misty Mountain Village. He was already kind enough to give you a chance to escape.</p>

  <p>Since you refuse to leave, you will be punished. Don't blame us for being cruel!" The one in the lead waved the large cyan saber in his hand and laughed sinisterly. An arrogant expression painted his ugly face. He ruthlessly killed the two divine citizens to intimidate and drive away all the people of Misty Mountain Village.</p>

  <p>"Since you are unwilling to depart, then there is no need to leave anymore. The chief has already said that the sabers in our hands won't become sharper unless we kill continuously. You imbeciles will be the perfect sacrifices for our strength. Guys, other than women, kill everyone else. The elderly and children are no exception!" The warrior waved his long saber and led the other six warriors to rush in. With a barbaric howl, the warriors infiltrated the village.</p>
