<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng finished up his slaughter, there weren't many Golden Shell Turtles left in the valley.</p>

  <p>Soon after he had killed the last Golden Shell Turtle, the four swords became weaker and disappeared completely.</p>

  <p>Without the Golden Shell Turtles' cooperation, Luo Zheng simply couldn't copy such large swords.</p>

  <p>As he finished, he immediately returned to the Goddess Statue.</p>

  <p>"Tianxing ..." muttered Liusu, who obviously felt very guilty toward Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Just as Rachelle had said not too long ago, name wasn't the key factor here.</p>

  <p>In fact, only three members of the Mu Clan knew of Luo Zheng's name, namely Marko, Mateo and Pranav, but they had previously died in the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>"It's okay." Luo Zheng smiled gently at Liusu. He simply didn't take this matter to heart.</p>

  <p>Aleyna and Kelsey kept silent, holding their lips tightly shut in a straight line.</p>

  <p>Kelsey still didn't know what was going on. She even thought that Rachelle was deliberately making trouble for Luo Zheng, and she thus offered her comfort, "Well, it doesn't matter. I believe that the Holy Emperors can ultimately tell right from wrong!"</p>

  <p>As Kelsey spoke, both Liusu and Aleyna couldn't help but sign interiorly to themselves.</p>

  <p>If the Holy Beings were to investigate this matter, Luo Zheng would probably be unable to hide anything much longer.</p>

  <p>As for the other True Gods, they didn't have much of an opinion on him.</p>

  <p>Most of them only cared about the upcoming attack from the next group of monsters.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, they had to go through eight rounds of attacks in order to protect the Goddess Statue, among which the seventh and eighth rounds were the most difficult. It was also these two final rounds that offered the most rewards; however, the rewards were only divine might coins.</p>

  <p>This time, there was something wrong in the Time Sea Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>It could only be expected that the situation would be different.</p>

  <p>The Golden Shell Turtles had appeared in the sixth round. Who knew what would happen next? The True Gods could only stand around and wait anxiously.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, there were many consummate True Gods guarding the valley now. Even if the fierce beasts were very strong, they would be capable of coping with them.</p>

  <p>Rumble!</p>

  <p>A few moments later, a loud rumble could be heard throughout the entire valley. It was so intense that everyone thought the seventh wave of fierce beasts appeared!</p>

  <p>All of the True Gods present immediately rested their eyes on the surrounding entrances.</p>

  <p>However, no beasts came from the south, the west or the north.</p>

  <p>"The east! They're coming from the east!" a True God roared as he watched the entrance at the east of the valley.</p>

  <p>All the other True Gods diverted their attention to the east. Even Luo Zheng was no exception.</p>

  <p>"No, that can't be true. Even if the difficulty of guarding the Goddess Statue has greatly increased, it's just impossible for such a thing to appear!" exclaimed a True God. Even top-rank True Gods like Reginald and Soren couldn't help but radiate a strong sense of fear.</p>

  <p>"Rachelle... What is that?" asked Nelly in a trembling, terrified voice.</p>

  <p>The three Han Clan girls hid themselves behind Alfredo. Kelsey had already turned ghastly pale and the other two seemed to be following suit.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, a dark brown monster appeared at the entrance in the east.</p>

  <p>The monster was as tall as a small palace. On its back were a pair of unique, never-before-seen wings. Now, the wings were spread out, and everyone could clearly see the colorful power of time that flew through their bone membrane.</p>

  <p>This monster's head was like that of a peeled sheep, but its face was more ferocious and terrifying. Its eyes were dark and looked as sharp as knives.</p>

  <p>"The claw..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng murmured as his eyes narrowed and stopped on the monster's claw.</p>

  <p>The claw had three toes, which was exactly the same as that he had seen coming through the Star Door.</p>

  <p>"That's not a part of this stage. It seems that the Goddess Statue stage has come to an end ahead of time." Rachelle stood up briskly, a short sword and a short machete appearing in her hands at once. "That's a sixth-grade Time Elk that we personally lured from the third stage of the Time Sea Forbidden Land."</p>

  <p>The monsters' grades corresponded to those of the forbidden lands in the divine land.</p>

  <p>The Time Sea Forbidden Land was a sixth grade forbidden land, and this Time Elk was the most powerful beast that existed.</p>

  <p>It was possible that even more powerful beasts existed on the fourth and fifth stages of the Time Sea Forbidden Land; however no one could enter those places. Of course, these beasts were far beyond any warriors' consideration.</p>

  <p>The consummate True Gods had worked hard to lead the Time Elk from the third stage to the first. Under the siege, the elk had gone mad, and the True Gods found themselves with no other choice but to enter the Star Door in order to hide temporarily. By doing so, they had equally gained a little time for a rest.</p>

  <p>Initially, they had thought that they had the time to rest longer. After all, the trials of the Goddess Statue were usually composed of eight kinds of fierce beasts, occasionally nine or even ten kinds. There was no way they could have expected the trials to end in advance this time around.</p>

  <p>Once the light curtain isolating the valley lifted and disappeared, the Time Elk that had been wondering just outside for a long time rushed in immediately.</p>

  <p>The elk exuded an intimidating aura, and the warriors, who were mentally unstable, had no courage to fight back. The True Gods in the valley might be the talents of the powerful clans on the Floating Islands, but due to such, many of them didn't have much experience. More importantly, they clearly didn't have the sufficient mental practice, which was obviously lacking here.</p>

  <p>When faced with the elk, it was only expected that the True Gods would become fearful.</p>

  <p>On the contrary though, Luo Zheng felt calm, much like the other consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>"See, my decision was right. The elk's madness can only last for about ten to fifteen minutes," Rachelle emphasized. At that, she turned her head and looked at Walton who wasn't far off, and asked, "What exactly are you thinking about? Or better yet, tell me, what are you waiting for?"</p>

  <p>On Walton's shoulder sat a purple machete. The blade of the machete was extremely wide and thick, like a flat hammer that emanated an intimidating aura.</p>

  <p>"I see," Walton replied unwillingly, and then rudely roared to the True Gods, "Don't just stand there in a daze, unless you want to die! Head to the other side of the valley. No one can guarantee your absolute safety.</p>

  <p>Watch your backs and be clever!"</p>

  <p>Many of the True Gods had been deeply seized by the elk's astonishing aura. As Walton's words broke their dazed state, their hearts began to pound hard in their chests and they quickly left the Goddess Statue. They all ran to the west of the valley at an incredibly fast speed.</p>

  <p>The aftermath of a battle between two consummate True Gods was extremely terrifying. If ordinary True Gods were involved, they would all die without exception. No one could even imagine the results to come from the fight between dozens of consummate True Gods and the elk.</p>

  <p>"Damn it! I would have run away had I known this earlier!"</p>

  <p>"Even when facing the Time Ghosts, we still had a chance to live. Alas...</p>

  <p>I don't think so anymore."</p>

  <p>"But now, we have nowhere to run anymore!"</p>

  <p>Many True Gods complained one after the next as they helplessly retreated.</p>

  <p>At first, a few of them noticed the consummate True Gods entering the valley and thought they were saviors.</p>

  <p>However, the so-called saviors had attracted an even more horrible existence. The True Gods were immediately seized with remorse.</p>

  <p>Howl!</p>

  <p>The Time Elk suddenly raised its pointy head and roared toward the sky.</p>

  <p>The whole valley began to shake violently. So much so that the space gave off a faint sign of collapsing.</p>

  <p>Both space and time were slightly disordered and altered, but in the moment, that was rather difficult to perceive.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>In a flash, Walton disappeared and quickly reappeared directly in front of the Time Elk. He was literally no more than a few inches away.</p>

  <p>Fearlessly and exuding braveness, Walton held onto his machete with an indifferent expression etched on his face. His foot stepped onto the ground.</p>

  <p>Thump!</p>

  <p>With a muffled sound, the earthy yellow internal momentum quickly spread throughout, and Walton found himself integrated as one with the entire valley.</p>

  <p>It was obvious now that he also cultivated the Earth Divine Dao, just like Nathaniel.</p>

  <p>He, on the other hand, had reached the consummation level.</p>
