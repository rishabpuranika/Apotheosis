<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3027 Escape From The Seven-Star City </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>The figure that emerged from the old man was as tall as twenty feet and his skin was dark. Everything about his appearance was brimming with hostility.</p>

  <p>There were three horns at the top of his head and his face was long and thin.</p>

  <p>The arms of the unusual figure were as long as an ape's. He flaunted his sparse sharp teeth when he opened his mouth. Every feature of his body contributed to making him look terrifying.</p>

  <p>The baby in Zheng's arms had just stopped crying. When its eyes met the deformed figure who suddenly appeared, it began to cry loudly again.</p>

  <p>Traumatized by what it saw, it embraced Zheng tightly.</p>

  <p id="top_12">When the two elders of the Sword Light Palace saw this scene, their faces turned extremely sullen.</p>

  <p>"It's a member of the Black Armor race! You were actually hiding in Elder Theon's body!"</p>

  <p>The elders were fuming with anger. They turned to the leader of the Sword Light Palace and exclaimed. "Reynald! You're the leader of the Sword Light Palace! How could you bring a monster to invade it! What is your purpose?"</p>

  <p>The Black Armor race resided in the Bayrock Province which was situated west of the Seven-Star Province. The members of the race resembled humans in features. However, their unforgiving brutality and violent tendencies set them apart from human beings.</p>

  <p>Under the steady protection of the Lofty Sword, the Sword Light Palace flourished over the years. During that time, the Stinger Guards had repeatedly entered Bayrock Province to kill off many Black Armor members.</p>

  <p>If the Sword Light Palace continued to prosper, it would continue to grow its roots further to the Bayrock Province and drive the Black Armor race away. Both the Black Armor race and Sword Light Palace were as incompatible as fire and water.</p>

  <p>No one of the Black Armor race dared to enter the Seven-Star Province with malicious intentions fearing the power of the Lofty Sword. However, now they had broken the Lofty Sword and killed off the officiant. With nothing protecting the Seven-Star City, they colluded with the king of the Man-eating Demon Flowers to attack it.</p>

  <p>And the ringleader behind all this was no one but the head of the Sword Light Palace, Reynald.</p>

  <p>Reynald returned the cold stare of the elder who questioned him. A venomous smile appeared on his face as he spoke, "You old bastard, now you finally call me the leader of the palace? Caspian has been dead for five hundred years, and I haven't seen you treat me as the leader of the palace even once since then! And that bitch still tries to take my place! Since you didn't treat me well, you have no right to blame me for doing this!"</p>

  <p>Since Caspian's death, Reynald had taken over the Sword Light Palace. But in name, he was only the acting leader and never had any authority over ruling it.</p>

  <p>Once Caspian's tomb was found, the Sword Light Palace would have a new leader.</p>

  <p>Reynald had tried his best to act as a leader over the years, but his efforts were never recognized. He had devoted himself completely for the prosperity of the Sword Light Palace but he always felt underappreciated.</p>

  <p>The fear of losing his position in the future forced him to form alliances with the enemy. His plans included colluding with the Black Armor race to kill Theon and using the "Bone Skin Secret Skill" to let Ibrahim hide into Theon's body. On the sidelines, he teamed up with the king of the Demon-eating Flowers from the Sand Country to cause chaos in the Seven-Star City.</p>

  <p>"What a vile man you are! You will just destroy the Sword Light Palace when you can't be the leader?"</p>

  <p>"Our Sword Light Palace inherited the good tradition of the Oneness Sky Palace. We only choose virtuous people to be the leader. You are a despicable man and you will be despised by the world!"</p>

  <p>The two elders had never imagined Reynald would turn so bitter as to overturn the Sword Light Palace because of this.</p>

  <p>The elders began to prepare themselves for a fight. As they chanted words, a strong aura started to surround them. Limitless spots of light sprung out from their bodies and began converging into two bright golden swords. The power surging from the swords was frighteningly strong.</p>

  <p>The Lofty Sword and the three elders were like two pillars holding up the Sword Light Palace. Both of them contributed to the protection of it. Now with the Lofty Sword broken, it was up to the elders to serve their lives in guarding the Seven-Star City. Their power was not to be underestimated.</p>

  <p>"Haha... I've been hiding in this body for more than half a year, and it was killing me." Ibrahim of the Black Armor race grinned wickedly. Thin lines of blood appeared on his black body, and a tyrannical aura gushed out from his presence.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, both sides charged at each other as a devastating battle took place in the air. The two elders fought with Ibrahim and Reynald with all their might.</p>

  <p>Streaks of energy spread out in the sky as the two great sides faced off against each other. When they exchanged blows, their energy flowed violently. The overwhelming sight made the disciples below stare with their mouths agape.</p>

  <p>Faegan was pale at the sight. He opened his mouth slightly and murmured under his breath. "Dad, Dad... What's going on?" His hands trembled in shock.</p>

  <p>Although he was a playboy in the Qiu Clan, he had always taken pride in his clan.</p>

  <p>He never expected his father to betray the clan and the Sword Light Palace.</p>

  <p>Conflicting emotions filled his existence as his body shook nervously.</p>

  <p>"You two old bastards are really strong! Now explode!"</p>

  <p>Ibrahim was surrounded by hundreds of golden swords. As he roared, several black veils of mist began to explode. The black mists made huge noises and shattered the golden swords into pieces.</p>

  <p>The explosions produced massive shock waves that rushed in all directions.</p>

  <p>The disciples directly underneath them felt dizzy under the impact.</p>

  <p>Instinctively, they covered their ears with their hands and felt blood gush out from the tip of their fingers.</p>

  <p>Zheng was able to withstand the shock waves and protected the baby in his arms. He stared up at the battle in the sky with a worried expression.</p>

  <p>As the battle raged on between these powerful warriors at the Other Shore Realm, Zheng realized he was not qualified to interfere yet. The wise choice would be to retreat from Seven-Star City as quickly as possible.</p>

  <p>However, once the nonhuman monsters had invaded the Seven-Star City, no other place in the entire province was safe.</p>

  <p>Never did he ever expect to encounter such a situation when he first entered the Sword Light Palace.</p>

  <p>The Stinger Guards worked together to hold off the six huge vines on the mountainside of the Seven-Star Mountain. Their efforts were in vain as the huge body of the king of the Man-eating Demon Flower was buried deep underground. It was useless to try and cut its vines.</p>

  <p>Ingram managed to cut off a large vine. He immediately rushed to Laura's side and said. "We must ask Elder Perceval and the others to work together to go underground and shatter the real body of the king of the Man-eating Demon Flowers!"</p>

  <p>Laura directed her gaze up at the sky, and a weak smile appeared on her face. "I'm afraid they don't have the time."</p>

  <p>Ingram also raised his head and looked up at the sky. His face changed color as he exclaimed, "The Black Armor race? Why is Reynald attacking the elders?"</p>

  <p>"Look over there..." Laura said as she pointed at the sky.</p>

  <p>Ingram looked in the direction where her finger pointed and saw dozens of black lights now flying towards the Seven-Star City from the west.</p>

  <p>Reinforcements of the Black Armor race were arriving in heavy numbers.</p>

  <p>At the frightening sight, Ingram trembled as he felt the will to fight leave his body.</p>

  <p>Even with the Lofty Sword destroyed, the Sword Light Palace was confident about guarding the Seven-Star City and killing the crazy king of the Demon-eating Flowers. However, with the Black Armor race involved, the situation was now out of their control.</p>

  <p>"What should we do?" Ingram said while panicking. With desperate eyes he looked at Laura for instructions.</p>

  <p>Laura gently bit her lip, her pale face drained of all its color. She took a deep breath and made a decision. "Order the Stinger Guards to abandon the Seven-Star City... You go and get the flying ship... We'll take the disciples of the palaces and leave!"</p>

  <p>Ingram stared at her in bewilderment. The Sword Light Palace had stood strong for so many years and they had put in so many efforts to manage the place. How could they give up and flee like this?</p>

  <p>But after careful consideration, he realized they didn't have much choice.</p>

  <p>They had to leave for now.</p>

  <p>"Let's go!"</p>

  <p>They nodded to each other agreeably. Laura took a step forward on her tiptoes and ascended to the air. In a flash, she appeared in the sky above the Sword Light Palace.</p>

  <p>"Master Laura!"</p>

  <p>"What should we do, Master Laura?"</p>

  <p>The disciples were all in dismay. As soon as they saw Laura, they eyed her up as if she was their savior.</p>

  <p>Laura looked around and noticed Zheng's expressions. Compared to the other disciples, he looked the calmest. She snapped her fingers and an illusory sword shadow hovered above their heads to protect them.</p>

  <p>The disciples of the Sword Light Palace felt relieved under Laura's protection.</p>

  <p>Soon after, a big flying ship appeared before them. There stood Ingram looking over at the disciples from the ship.</p>

  <p>"All of you, board the ship. We're leaving..." Laura said flatly, signaling the disciples.</p>

  <p>"But as members of the Yuebai Clan, how can we abandon the Seven-Star City?" Beldene frowned and protested.</p>

  <p>"If you wish to die, by all means, stay here," Laura said curtly. Then she moved her body and boarded the flying ship.</p>

  <p>The disciples gulped down their hesitation and jumped aboard the ship without a second thought.</p>

  <p>Several disciples of the Yuebai Clan and Qiu Clan debated for a while.</p>

  <p>Finally, they realized that their lives were above everything. They quickly followed the others and got on the flying ship.</p>
