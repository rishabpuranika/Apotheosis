<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1761 Leader Of Nine Dragons </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords grew serious.</p>

  <p>They hadn't expected the center area of the Celestial Position race to be attacked by the sorcerer race.</p>

  <p>Master Feng looked stern. This was an unforgivable omission.</p>

  <p>The beast was black, with cracks all over its body and was more than a hundred feet long.</p>

  <p>It was fierce and though Master Feng had pulled it out of the space crack, it was still frantically struggling on the ground. It was obviously targeting the remaining nine Godly Geniuses.</p>

  <p>But even though it was powerful, it couldn't break free from Master Feng.</p>

  <p>After it had struggled a while, the huge body unexpectedly started to tremble, and before anybody could react, countless tiny black dots shot out of the cracks on its body.</p>

  <p>These black dots were actually poisonous insects.</p>

  <p>"Watch out!"</p>

  <p>"It's the Venomous Stinkbug!"</p>

  <p>"Let me take care of them."</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords had watched from the top of the stairs but hadn't acted before since Supreme Lord of Oracle, Master Feng, and Supreme Lord of Original Sin had taken care of everything.</p>

  <p>The flying Venomous Stinkbugs couldn't harm the Supreme Lords, but could easily poison the juniors.</p>

  <p>These creatures that lived on the other side of the world were most proficient in spells, curses, and poison.</p>

  <p>The sorcerer race's attacks were very closely linked to each other this time.</p>

  <p>There were many of these Venomous Stinkbugs and several Supreme Lords working together. How could one possibly escape?</p>

  <p>With a light flick of Supreme Lord Amritpal's finger, small balls of fire exploded inside the bodies of the Venomous Stinkbugs, turning them into ashes that scattered onto the ground.</p>

  <p>The poisonous insects had barely been cleaned up before the space beside them cracked up once again. The Supreme Lord of Original Sin had leaped out, a black object in his hands.</p>

  <p>They could barely make out what it was, but from this distance, it appeared to be a human figure.</p>

  <p>This 'person' had a dark body and limbs as thin as hemp. His hands were surprisingly large and held a skeleton staff. His eyes were so black, the whites were barely visible. His face was like that of a devil.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord of Original Sin tossed this 'person' casually on the ground, unworried of him running away. It was a fact that no one could escape from Supreme Lord of Original Sin.</p>

  <p>"There's only one member of the sorcerer race?" Supreme Lord of Oracle asked.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord of Original Sin nodded and said, "This fellow attacked this place while riding an Angel of Death." His gaze landed on Karl's dead body that looked like a crushed sack. He frowned. He had been hoping for the universe to count on these Godly Geniuses, but one of them had just died! This was not a good sign, even though Karl was not a member of the four great clans. "Can he be revived?" he asked.</p>

  <p>These Supreme Lords could save one's life using their methods no matter how serious the injuries were and no matter the extent to which one was poisoned.</p>

  <p>But Karl's entire body had been crushed. He was as dead as could be, and they could only use the method of revival to bring him back to life.</p>

  <p>"I'll have Lester come over now!" Master Feng said gloomily. It was rare to see him like this and it seemed like he was really, truly angry.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Lester was a very important Supreme Lord of the Celestial Position race. He was also the only Supreme Lord in the universe who had carried the Heavenly Destiny of Revival. He had the means to revive people from the dead.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord of Original Sin nodded as his gaze landed on the black figure.</p>

  <p>The figure curled up into a ball, and when he saw that everyone was looking at him, a strange smile appeared on his face. His sharp white teeth were in stark contrast with his dark skin. An unpleasant sound emanated from his throat, as if countless metals were gathered together and grating against each other. "Hahahahaha! Stop struggling! We of the sorcerer race will eventually get rid of the curse of God. You are the vermin of this universe, and we will eventually get rid of all of you!"</p>

  <p>"Scum from the back of the world!" Supreme Lord Mathias raised his hand, wanting to shatter this martial artist with a single punch.</p>

  <p>However, Master Feng stopped him.</p>

  <p>Master Feng was serious as he stared at the warrior coldly and said,</p>

  <p>"Your sorcerer race cannot control this round of the universe even if the entire universe is destroyed!"</p>

  <p>"Is that so?" He began laughing uncontrollably, to the point where he began to sound crazy. "Let's not talk about whether it's our turn to control it. At least we can get God's forgiveness and dispel the curse on our bodies! Ha-ha! You all are still hoping that this bunch of brats will save you? Ridiculous!" he said as he pointed at Luo Zheng and the others.</p>

  <p>The sorcerer race used to be a human race too.</p>

  <p>It was said that a long time ago, the sorcerer race had offended God and had been cursed by Him, which was why they had begun to look so evil and horrible.</p>

  <p>There was no way to verify if the legend was true or not. The real reason was probably only recorded within the sorcerer race.</p>

  <p>"Well, I haven't used soul searching in a long time," Master Feng said, without a trace of emotion.</p>

  <p>This sorcerer had ridden an Angel of Death and made a surprise attack.</p>

  <p>He was already prepared to sacrifice himself by killing someone inside the Celestial Position race in the presence of so many Supreme Lords. It was impossible for him to retreat and he was actually ready to die.</p>

  <p>But when he realized that Master Feng would search his soul, his face betrayed his fear.</p>

  <p>Death was fine, but no one wanted a messed up soul.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Almost instinctively, he wanted to escape.</p>

  <p>But just a glance from Master Feng rendered him motionless, freezing him in place.</p>

  <p>This person was a grand sorcerer of the sorcerer race, and a grand sorcerer was akin to a world lord in the universe. There was no way for him to escape.</p>

  <p>Master Feng walked up to the grand sorcerer, a cold expression etched on his face. The sorcerer glanced at him, circles of milky white light appearing suddenly in his black eyes. His eyes became vacant, just as they would when one's soul was searched.</p>

  <p>The moment Master Feng searched his soul, a strange smile appeared on the grand sorcerer's blank face.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>An invisible power struck the grand sorcerer's chest as Master Feng grew angrier by the minute.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords couldn't understand why Master Feng had killed the sorcerer while searching his soul.</p>

  <p>Master Feng stretched out his hand and pressed it to his forehead. With a light tap of his finger, a black snake emerged from his forehead. The snake hovered around in Master Feng's hand as it hissed.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords were stunned as they saw the small black snake.</p>

  <p>"Crying Soul Snake?!" This was one of the most vicious methods that the sorcerer race employed. The Crying Soul Snake was normally attached to the soul of a grand sorcerer and was not of much use. But if someone searched their soul or used the soul attack, it would trigger the Crying Soul Snake's attack.</p>

  <p>The Crying Soul Snake's poison specifically targeted the soul. The poison was not strong but it could not be expelled once it was immersed in the soul. It would accumulate year after year, until one day, it erupted.</p>

  <p>This grand sorcerer knew that it would be hard for him to escape death and that Master Feng would search his soul. He had acted scared and Master Feng had almost fallen in his trap.</p>

  <p>But Master Feng's soul form was very special. Any other Supreme Lord would probably have been miserable.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Mathias turned purple with rage as he saw this.</p>

  <p>He had previously just been afraid of the so-called True Gods and hadn't even considered the sorcerer race strong. But he was realizing that the sorcerer race would not be easy to deal with.</p>

  <p>Master Feng sighed and ordered the scene to be cleaned up. Once the Angel of Death had been taken away, his eyes fell on Luo Zheng as he said,</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng should be the target of this grand sorcerer."</p>

  <p>This grand sorcerer should have been hiding behind space for a long time. When he had urged the Angel of Death to attack, his first target had been Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He hadn't expected Luo Zheng to react so quickly. Luo Zheng had taken Mu Ning with him and dodged the attack. Unfortunately, Karl was the one who had been killed.</p>

  <p>"You have something they fear." Master Feng continued to stare at Luo Zheng and said, "No matter what it is, we need to talk about the dragon right now!"</p>

  <p>"You mean the Ancestral Dragon?" Luo Zheng, however, remembered that he had left the Ancestral Dragon in the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>Master Feng shook his head, saying, "No, there are other uses for the Ancestral Dragon. It will be best if you can nurture it yourself."</p>

  <p>With that, Master Feng turned towards the depths of the cave. His lips moved as if he was sending a message to someone using his life vitality.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, someone had carried purple crystal coffins towards them.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked within them and discovered that there were a number of things moving about within the crystal coffins.</p>

  <p>"These are the soul essences of various legendary beasts." Master Feng continued, "It's time to awaken the Five-clawed Golden Dragon in your body."</p>

  <p>The Five-clawed Golden Dragon was the leader of the nine dragons, and also the big brother that Josh had mentioned.</p>
