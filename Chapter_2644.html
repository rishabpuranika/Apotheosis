<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2644 Abandon </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zelda looked up at the black figure perching on the city wall. Her pretty face remained calm, but the hatred in her eyes was obvious.</p>

  <p>She and Luther had suffered too much. Luther was young at the time, and she had had to take on most of the difficulties.</p>

  <p>She had been devastated to lose her parents.</p>

  <p>She could do nothing but watch her uncle and his family being crushed by the huge millstone.</p>

  <p>The three brothers who had saved her were shot down by arrows.</p>

  <p>And the past flashed before her eyes again with the swiftness of a viper.</p>

  <p>She had her reasons to want revenge but she had to try to suppress the hatred that filled her heart.</p>

  <p>She had become excited at having found the right person - Luo Zheng, which resulted in her trying every possible means to ask him to help her.</p>

  <p>Zelda knew that Luo Zheng was a person of integrity, or she would have considered offering him everything she had, including her own body.</p>

  <p>As she waited, fear overcame her. She was afraid that Luo Zheng would go back on his word.</p>

  <p>She hadn't expected everything to go so smoothly.</p>

  <p>So step by step, she stepped into this space, and finally returned to her hometown. Now it was time for her to exact her revenge.</p>

  <p>"Aunt Sandy! You weren't expecting us to meet again like this, were you?" Zelda smiled, thoroughly enjoying herself.</p>

  <p>The Warden race wasn't too big. Even if the free faction and the conservative faction had become enemies, they could still build up a kind of seniority with each other. That was why Zelda addressed the dark figure as Aunt Sandy.</p>

  <p>But that didn't mean Zelda regarded her as a respected elder.</p>

  <p>Sandy stared at Zelda for a while before muttering, "I wasn't expecting this. I never thought that your free faction would go this far and choose to lure these outsiders in to kill our race."</p>

  <p>Zelda made to retort, but Luther's voice interrupted her from behind.</p>

  <p>"You think we have gone too far?" Luther walked up to Zelda as he spoke to Sandy, "I don't know what gave you that idea. I only know that you killed my parents. So we have no choice. We are going to avenge them!"</p>

  <p>Ever since he could remember, he had had no sense of belonging to the Warden race. Instead, he harbored bitter hatred towards the race. So whatever he did, he never felt that he had gone too far.</p>

  <p>Sandy looked at Luther. He was more important than Zelda, since he had the ability to cut off the Curse Chains.</p>

  <p>"Just for revenge? You are the chain breaker of the Warden race but don't even know your own mission! How do you even know what hatred is?"</p>

  <p>Sandy said, her voice full of pity.</p>

  <p>"Your so-called mission is only the will of the Chaos Ancient God. We, on the other hand, always yearn for freedom. There is no need to argue thus," Zelda said.</p>

  <p>There were many disputes between the free faction and the conservative faction. So it didn't really matter who was to blame right now.</p>

  <p>"You are right. It is unnecessary," Sandy said. But no longer had she agreed than she let out another screeching order. "Kill the man called Luther!"</p>

  <p>Spark waved a hand and at his signal, the men on the city wall took out black crossbows, aimed at Luther, and released the arrows.</p>

  <p>The distance between them wasn't huge, which was why they were employing the crossbows - to ensure that power and precision were at their peaks.</p>

  <p>Sandy knew how important Luther was to them. So did Emily and the others.</p>

  <p>They also knew that Spark was cunning and that they had to constantly be on guard against him.</p>

  <p>"Get out of the way!"</p>

  <p>Emily grabbed Luther and pushed him to the ground, falling with him.</p>

  <p>The clicking sounds grew closer.</p>

  <p>The sharp arrows fell with multiple clinks behind them.</p>

  <p>"You think only you can shoot?" Timotheus sneered.</p>

  <p>The men behind him braced themselves.</p>

  <p>Each of them had a black crossbow in their hands.</p>

  <p>With a collective twang, they let go of their bowstrings.</p>

  <p>The radiance of more than twenty black arrows turned into black raindrops and shot towards the city wall.</p>

  <p>The two men beside Spark couldn't escape the attack.</p>

  <p>They let out strangled screams and fell off the wall.</p>

  <p>Spark watched in horror as he hid behind the city wall. He had managed to dodge the attack but threw himself to the floor of the parapet.</p>

  <p>Sandy, however, stood still, letting the arrows rain down on her cloak.</p>

  <p>No one knew what her cloak was made of.</p>

  <p>The arrows couldn't penetrate it and began to fall off it.</p>

  <p>Sandy sneered.</p>

  <p>"What should we do now?" Spark asked.</p>

  <p>"Take your people to the outside of the city wall and stop them," Sandy said coldly.</p>

  <p>"My people? I don't have many followers,"</p>

  <p>Spark said with a bitter smile.</p>

  <p>Many of the exiles who had followed him had died. And two more had been killed just now.</p>

  <p>He now had only two exiles of the Yellow Emperor race left with him.</p>

  <p>How could they stop the hundreds of people that Emily was leading against them? Moreover, under the effect of the Strength Equalizing token, their strength was almost the same. Even Spark didn't have the confidence to deal with those Wild Gods.</p>

  <p>"Then go to hell. You are good-for-nothings anyway. I had originally wanted you to fight against each other but it looks like you are completely useless. They are easily torturing you one by one," Sandy said savagely and retreated.</p>

  <p>Spark stood still, his heart sinking.</p>

  <p>It was at this moment that he realized that the Warden race had completely used him.</p>

  <p>He was usually very smart, making it difficult for others to use him like this. But at the moment, he had been eager to leave this world, and had thought of obstructing the Nine Li race and the Snake Goddess race.</p>

  <p>That was why he had willingly agreed to work with the Warden race.</p>

  <p>He hadn't expected to be abandoned so easily.</p>

  <p>"You!"</p>

  <p>As he looked at Sandy's retreating back, his eyes filled with resentment.</p>

  <p>"Spark, what should we do now? Stop them outside?" one of the exiles of the Yellow Emperor race asked him.</p>

  <p>They had followed Spark all the way here, but they had never thought they would find themselves in such a situation.</p>

  <p>"Forget it! Let's go!"</p>

  <p>There was a gleam in Spark's eyes.</p>

  <p>He had led the Yellow Emperor race for so many years, which obviously meant that he was a remarkable man.</p>

  <p>And now that he had been abandoned, how could he continue to work for the Warden race? So he made a prompt decision and led his two clansmen to the other side. But he vowed that he would not let the Warden race go so easily.</p>
