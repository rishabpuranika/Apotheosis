<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1580 Trying To Break The Small Skulls </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>After the four walls collapsed, they immediately disappeared. The ceiling above their heads also vanished in a flash.</p>

  <p>Before them appeared a majestic mountain.</p>

  <p>This massive mountain was submerged in thick white clouds and surrounded by mist. It looked like something straight out of a fairyland.</p>

  <p>The ten warriors, including Zheng, stood on a platform at the foot of the mountain.</p>

  <p>"The iron ticket only mentioned the Hall of Causality. Why is there a giant mountain before us?" Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>The others had no reply to Zheng's query. After all, it was the first time that most of them had entered this place, so they could not answer his question.</p>

  <p>"Once we go up the mountain, we will understand what the Hall of Causality is," the woman in white said with a smile. "All the restrictions will be dismissed after we leave this platform," she added, "but I do not want you all to fight each other."</p>

  <p>"And why should we follow your orders?" A sinister voice floated over them. It belonged to one of the warriors.</p>

  <p>Some martial artists had well thought-out plans of making their moves.</p>

  <p>Since everyone present could afford to spend five million Illusion Points to enter the Hall of Causality, they most definitely had plenty of Illusion Points left.</p>

  <p>The white-clothed woman kept smiling. "The Illusion Points you can get at the Hall of Causality will be more than tens of millions. If you have good fortune, you may even be able to get your hands on some supreme divine weapons that are yet to appear. So if you people want to waste your time and strength engaging in fights over here, go ahead!"</p>

  <p>Hearing this, realization dawned on the warriors.</p>

  <p>Since the warriors could get into the Hall of Causality, they obviously possessed a good number of Illusion Points. Even after paying up five million Illusion Points, they must have several more left with them.</p>

  <p>Illusion Points were accumulated bit by bit, from the numerous battles they all had participated in.</p>

  <p>But now they had the opportunity to acquire over ten million Illusion Points in the Hall of Causality.</p>

  <p>Moreover, they might be able to acquire supreme divine weapons.</p>

  <p>Considering this, the warriors who had previously planned to fight the others now hesitated.</p>

  <p>The woman in white no longer needed to worry about this issue. She nodded at Zheng. "Let's go!"</p>

  <p>She was the first to step down the platform and onto the stairs of the mountain.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes twinkled. From what the woman in white said, it seemed that he could obtain a large number of Illusion Points here.</p>

  <p>That number could even be over ten million.</p>

  <p>No wonder his ranking had dropped instead of rising!</p>

  <p>Most of the warriors ranked before him had probably entered the Hall of Causality already.</p>

  <p>Compared to the way he had plundered his Illusion Points, it was indeed hard for him to keep up with the speed of gaining points at the Hall of Causality.</p>

  <p>He refrained from thinking too much of it. Following the woman in white, he stepped onto the stairs as well.</p>

  <p>However, an unexpected thing happened.</p>

  <p>The moment Zheng stepped on the stairs, a bad premonition rose in his heart. He raised his head and heard a series of familiar sounds. "Crank!</p>

  <p>Crank!"</p>

  <p>Those damned skulls had appeared again!</p>

  <p>It had been some time since Zheng got rid of the skulls. He had not expected them to follow him again the moment he left the room.</p>

  <p>Previously, when Zheng had used the Teleportation Token to travel from a main city to another, the skulls had caught up to him unbelievably quickly.</p>

  <p>Zheng had used the iron ticket to enter the Hall of Causality. He did not know how far he was from where he had been before, but the skulls still followed him.</p>

  <p>Zheng shook his head. Could it be that after leaving the Illusion Battlefield, they would be able to follow him inside the fairy palace as well?</p>

  <p>In the Illusion Battlefield, everything was only a verisimilar projection.</p>

  <p>He did not truly mind being followed by the skulls here. However, it would be the most troubling if the skulls managed to chase him into the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>As for the other nine martial artists, they were utterly startled by the scene.</p>

  <p>Even the woman in white, who was leading the way, was stunned to see the approaching skulls. "What... what is this?"</p>

  <p>Zheng, on the other hand, remained placid. He had almost gotten used to it.</p>

  <p>"I got myself into this trouble at a secret place."</p>

  <p>"Is that so? These little skulls cannot be chased away?"</p>

  <p>As the woman in white asked this, she walked over to Zheng's side and picked up a small skull from behind his back. She carefully observed it for a moment before releasing a thin streak of lightning from her slender fingers.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>As the lightning shot out, it wrapped itself around the skull.</p>

  <p>Although this bolt of lightning was considerably tiny, Zheng was secretly surprised at the power contained within it.</p>

  <p>The power inside the bolt of lightning was indeed astonishing, and the light it emitted was dazzling. However, it turned out to be useless.</p>

  <p>After the lightning dissipated, the skull remained undamaged.</p>

  <p>As these small skulls couldn't be dealt with, the Law of Causality they contained could be as tyrannical as the law of the heavens. But if the skulls had been so easy to destroy, then the Supreme Lord who had besieged Zheng that day would not have had those many small skulls hanging behind his back. Even a Supreme Lord could do nothing about it, so how could a Soul Sea Realm warrior possibly disperse them?</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! Let me try!"</p>

  <p>The one who said this was the ogre who had been provoking the others previously. In that room, he had seemed to want to fight everyone. But now, he was being rather civil.</p>

  <p>The ogre took hold of a skull.</p>

  <p>"I'll give it a try too!"</p>

  <p>"This skull is in fact a divine weapon. I wonder if I can destroy it."</p>

  <p>"Give me one please!"</p>

  <p>"There are so many skulls behind the boy. You can go get one yourself!"</p>

  <p>The other warriors gathered around Zheng and studied the skulls on his back.</p>

  <p>Zheng, who stood rooted to the spot, rolled his eyes.</p>

  <p>'Aren't we here to get inside the Hall of Causality? Why is everyone so interested in the skulls behind me?'</p>

  <p>Seeing the expression on Zheng's face, the woman in white covered her mouth to suppress a smile. She loosened her grip on the skull and it flew to Zheng at once, biting his back. She said, "If I'm not wrong, these skulls come from some kind of curse!"</p>

  <p>"You are right." Zheng shrugged lightly.</p>

  <p>"The legend says that there is an ancient sorcerer race that secretly merged with the laws of the heavens, using curses to steal a Heavenly Destiny. It is said that their spells are extremely powerful and there is almost no way to break them," the woman said.</p>

  <p>"Steal a Heavenly Destiny?"</p>

  <p>Zheng repeated the words, slightly surprised.</p>

  <p>The woman smiled, "I don't really understand it either. There are only a hundred and twenty-eight Heavenly Destinies. If one used an unorthodox method to obtain one, then they would certainly be punished by the heavens!"</p>

  <p>A Heavenly Destiny was the supreme Law of Causality in the universe.</p>

  <p>There were a hundred and twenty-eight Heavenly Destinies all together.</p>

  <p>When a Supreme Lord died, a Heavenly Destiny dissipated and a new Crown of Destiny was born.</p>

  <p>However, there was no mention in the legend as to what method the ancient sorcerer race had used. The power of their spell even surpassed the Law of Causality. Such spells had already crossed the limits of the heavens, so the heavens could not stand them.</p>

  <p>Warriors today assumed that it was the reason why the ancient sorcerer race vanished from the universe in one night alone.</p>

  <p>However, more than a billion years had passed since the disappearance of the ancient sorcerer race. It had long ago become a story sealed away by time, and the speculations that went about were not one hundred percent true.</p>

  <p>"Let's go. I forgot to mention that flying is prohibited in the Hall of Causality, so we can only climb the stairs step by step," the white-robed woman said and continued climbing up the winding stairs without pause.</p>

  <p>Zheng followed behind her.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the eight warriors behind Zheng continuously tried out their own methods to try and break the tiny skulls.</p>

  <p>"Ah! Ah! Ah! I can't split it! My Dark Demon Saber has been damaged by the skull!"</p>

  <p>The ogre held a black saber in his hand, his face full of sorrow. His saber was also a first rank divine weapon, but the small skull remained undamaged with its cut. A half-moon crack appeared on his saber.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the weapons used in the Illusion Battlefield were still safe and sound in the outside world. Otherwise, the ogre would have undeniably been pissed.</p>

  <p>Now his saber was damaged, and there were many battles ahead of him.</p>

  <p>Without his first rank divine weapon, it would be tough for him to continue fighting.</p>

  <p>Hearing the ogre's words, the other seven warriors stared at him as if he was an idiot.</p>

  <p>They had only been curious about the little skulls so they picked up some from behind Zheng. Was there really a need to work so hard with it?</p>

  <p>Of course, no one could break through a single small skull, so they had given up. The small skulls flew back to Zheng, their small white teeth tightly biting his back. The other eight warriors followed Zheng and ascended the stairs.</p>
