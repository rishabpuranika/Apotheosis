<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Most of the creatures from the chaos believed that the Instant Civilization created the chaos upon their existence.</p>

  <p>However, as it was always a mystery of the Instant Civilization's existence, it left few clues behind.</p>

  <p>Even there was some, they had been completely concealed by the Element Spirit Civilization when they first appeared in the chaos.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing about the so-called Four Spirits Sect, Ziya was surprised,</p>

  <p>"What's the story of the human spirit? Tell me. I want all the details."</p>

  <p>Ziya's sudden intrigue startled the little creature. "I... I don't know much, but I can say that the strongest Celestial Warriors in the Dream World would be favored by the Four Spirits Sect because they were quite outstanding and more than qualified to merge with stronger bloodlines..."</p>

  <p>"Stronger bloodlines..." Ziya murmured to himself as he thought for a moment. "Had the Celestial Warriors you mentioned entered the Eternal Scroll Painting too?"</p>

  <p>As he heard this, Geoffrey already understood that the Celestial Warrior should be corresponding to no other than the Eternal Warrior at the Eternal Realm.</p>

  <p>"Eternal Scroll Painting?" the creature said as he shook his head. "I'm not sure what that is, but in order to become a Celestial Warrior, one has to enter the Celestial Painting. Only the most powerful Celestial Warrior can meet those from the Four Spirits Sect through the Celestial Painting. If I'm not mistaken, the four spirits of the Four Spirits Sect are human spirit, monkey spirit, snake spirit and bird spirit."</p>

  <p>To become a Celestial Warrior had always been the creature's dream, so he was very knowledgeable about these things from continuous research and dedication.</p>

  <p>"Master Ziya, the Four Spirits Sect is likely to be the Instant Civilization, right?" Geoffrey asked from where he stood.</p>

  <p>Ziya nodded in response. "Yes, but it seems that this world is a little different from our chaos. Why did the Four Spirits Sect choose to meet the creatures of this world but continuously hid themselves from the creatures of the chaos?"</p>

  <p>Geoffrey was very intelligent. Even if he had never been to the Other Shore, he could understand things through mere explanation. "There are two possibilities. It can be that the passage from the Abstruse Energy World to the chaos was broken, so the people of the Four Spirits Sect couldn't come.</p>

  <p>It could also be that the world of poisonous mist existed much earlier than the chaos, and later the people of the Four Spirits Sect died, disappeared, or left, so the people in the chaos had never met them!"</p>

  <p>Ziya looked at Geoffrey and gave him a light smile of satisfaction.</p>

  <p>Although Geoffrey had some flaws, he was smart and Ziya admired this.</p>

  <p>From the time they met up until this very moment, Ziya treated Geoffrey as his own son.</p>

  <p>"Do you know how many years this world of poisonous mist has lasted?"</p>

  <p>Ziya asked the little creature again.</p>

  <p>The creature shook his head, "I don't remember. I only know it has lasted for a long time..."</p>

  <p>Considering how long ago it was born, it was impossible at this point to determine exactly how many years. He didn't keep a record, so he couldn't give them a good answer. However, Ziya expected this and did not hesitate to ask some more, "Was the Celestial Painting also destroyed?"</p>

  <p>The creature shook his head once more.</p>

  <p>Before the Dream World was destroyed, he did not have enough abilities to go to the second ring, so he had not seen the so-called Celestial Painting either.</p>

  <p>Ziya stopped asking. Before leaving, he assisted the Dark Fiend race to get rid of all the poisonous animals within the radius of a hundred miles. If there was any trouble that awaited them in the future, the Dark Fiend race would have to solve it by themselves.</p>

  <p>Ziya was unsure whether the Dark Fiend race, the last offspring of the world of poisonous mist, would flourish despite these.</p>

  <p>Afterwards, Ziya continuously travelled around the Dream World with Geoffrey by his side. He wanted to discover the traces of the Celestial Painting, but no matter where he looked, he couldn't seem to find it.</p>

  <p>As he searched, a few islands caught his eye. He soared down to check them out, only to find out that they were empty and did nothing for his harvest.</p>

  <p>"Master Ziya, that creature from the Dark Fiend race mentioned that one can only see the people of the Four Spirits Sect through the Celestial Painting. Doesn't that mean the Celestial Painting is a passage? And if so, what about the Eternal Scroll Painting?" Geoffrey asked.</p>

  <p>Ziya looked at Geoffrey and replied, "This speculation existed a long time ago. The Eternal Scroll Painting itself may be a passage to the Abstruse Energy World."</p>

  <p>"Have you been to the end of this passage? Or has anyone in the chaos ever successfully travelled there?" Geoffrey asked again.</p>

  <p>"The end? No. Is it possible?"</p>

  <p>Ziya's eyes narrowed slightly. What he had previously obtained was only a bloodline from an inner circle. He hadn't stepped into the innermost circle.</p>

  <p>However, he recalled that the center of the big vortex was still covered by a black mist!</p>

  <p>"It seems that people from the chaos can't do that," Geoffrey pointed out as he shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>Ziya smiled helplessly. He knew exactly what Geoffrey meant.</p>

  <p>In order to meet the people of the Four Spirits Sect, one must enter the center to obtain qualification first. Regretfully, Ziya, the Primeval Lord of Heaven and Eye Spirit hadn't entered the center, so they were not qualified enough.</p>

  <p>After they had exited the world of poisonous mist, Geoffrey sent Ziya back to the Deleting Space.</p>

  <p>Although Ziya didn't ask Geoffrey to do anything, Geoffrey still set a goal for himself: to discover a window to another world.</p>

  <p>He had a gut feeling that there were more than two such worlds that existed within the Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>There existed a small and remote province in the western part of the Source World: the Separate Amber Province.</p>

  <p>This place was very primitive and it was filled with numerous savage creatures. Normally, few intelligent creatures would find their way into this province.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Just then, a violent wind pressure descended from the sky and blew the dense forest into a messy, disheveled area.</p>

  <p>One by one, the black-faced monkeys in the dense forest began squealing in fright. They mistook the pressure for a Wind Snake that regularly hunted them down.</p>

  <p>As they panicked, seven huge black shadows suddenly appeared in the sky.</p>

  <p>They were seven giant flying ships!</p>

  <p>The seven giant flying ships hovered at a very low height to avoid any attention. However, no matter their efforts, they failed to go unnoticed due to their large size and fast speed. They produced a strong wind pressure, as if they had plowed the ground where they passed.</p>

  <p>"Master Pearce, would it be too cautious for us to make a detour?" one of the masters from the Oneness Mountain asked.</p>

  <p>They would reach the Pear Hill soon if they headed west directly. As long as they entered the Pear Hill, they would be safe there.</p>

  <p>In the Source World, it was known that if any super force attempted to hurt the Pear Hill, they had to be one hundred percent sure of the consequences.</p>

  <p>However, Pearce decided to change their route and make a detour, which prolonged their journey to the Pear Hill.</p>

  <p>"We have to be cautious," Pearce replied.</p>

  <p>During these days, Pearce had always been tense and restless.</p>

  <p>In fact, he had reacted very quickly. The moment the Eternal Scroll Painting closed, he summoned the masters of seven mountains to start the migration.</p>

  <p>He also remembered to inform the Pear Hill and make a detour on the way...</p>

  <p>For some unknown reasons, he couldn't help but still be worried. His nerves had reached almost their limit.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>"Master Pearce, we have successfully arrived at the boundary wall of the Separate Amber Province," a member reported.</p>

  <p>There were always unshakeable boundary walls in between provinces. In order to enter them, one had to use the Sanskrit word that matched the one on the boundary wall to open the passageway.</p>

  <p>"Just pass it. Why are you even reporting this?" Pearce asked with a frown.</p>

  <p>"The Sanskrit words can't match, so the passageway cannot be opened. We cannot pass through," the man responded hastily.</p>
