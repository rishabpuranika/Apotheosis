  <p>
</p>

  <p>Fiery anger burned in Yudie's eyes as she glared at Luo Nian and scolded, "Luo Nian, I've told you countless times! You can't be impolite to others, most especially your father!"</p>

  <p>"Well, since he's my father and he hasn't seen me in a long time, then he should give me a gift," Luo Nian retorted with a smile.</p>

  <p>His face twisted into a serious expression for about nine seconds, before it lapsed into a lazy grimace.</p>

  <p>"That's right. A father is always generous to his son. Luo Zheng's harvest was definitely abundant this time, so he must have something good to give his little man," a voice suddenly interjected. There in the distance was Augustus, who walked forward and winked at Luo Nian.</p>

  <p>However, a frown stretched upon Yudie's lips. "Gus, don't mess around!" she said in annoyance.</p>

  <p>Over the years, Augustus and Luo Nian had gotten on well with each other.</p>

  <p>Augustus, however, wasn't as smart as Luo Nian, as the latter had taken many of his treasures by using various tricks.</p>

  <p>One of those treasures was even handed down from Bromley. That treasure was extremely important to Augustus, but Luo Nian had taken it away.</p>

  <p>When Hallet knew about the issue, he reprimanded Augustus and took the treasure back from Luo Nian.</p>

  <p>That incident was still embedded in Augustus' mind, and it made him immensely upset. Yet just now, he helped Luo Nian ask Luo Zheng for a gift!</p>

  <p>"Luo Nian is picky. He doesn't like common things, so Luo Zheng, you can't give him something ordinary," he added.</p>

  <p>"Father, don't listen to Uncle Augustus' nonsense. I'll accept whatever you will give me," Luo Nian shot back with another smile.</p>

  <p>Although he said so, everybody understood what he meant.</p>

  <p>Yudie couldn't help but sigh at his words.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Luo Zheng didn't mind as he knew very well what Luo Nian was like. "Indeed, I shouldn't be so stingy," he answered with a grin.</p>

  <p>Once he was done speaking, he pointed with his finger, and his space ring glowed faintly. Moments later, a golden snake swam out of it.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the other people in the hall watched as Luo Nian asked his father for a gift, curious about what Luo Zheng would take out.</p>

  <p>As soon as the little golden snake appeared, everyone's eyes were immediately glued onto it.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, what kind of treasure is that?" asked Joy in surprise. On the contrary, Augustus suddenly felt a chill that ran down his spine.</p>

  <p>His eyes stared directly at the snake, not once leaving it.</p>

  <p>It was true that he was extremely talented, but he would probably be considered inferior to Hallet if he ever left the Swirl Forest.</p>

  <p>It was because he had wasted a great deal of his time and talent on some unorthodox skills, such as the puppet manipulating techniques.</p>

  <p>In addition, he had also been forced to give Luo Nian numerous puppets in the past few years.</p>

  <p>That was why he felt a powerful attraction towards the snake the moment he saw it!</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng! That is a puppet snake!" he exclaimed excitedly.</p>

  <p>Everyone was surprised when he lay prone on the ground out of the blue and stared intently at the puppet snake.</p>

  <p>In terms of craftsmanship, it was a rather ordinary puppet snake.</p>

  <p>Even Augustus himself could make a puppet that looked similar to a real person.</p>

  <p>Yet judging from the aura contained in the small, golden snake's body, it was safe to say that it was something that was beyond his knowledge and understanding.</p>

  <p>"This is a puppet," Luo Zheng said and nodded.</p>

  <p>Augustus carefully touched the little golden snake and muttered, "This is not the gold with a cold light, nor jade gold. I've never seen this kind of material before, and it shouldn't exist in the divine land. What's more, this little snake's eyes are so strange... Where did you get this little golden snake?"</p>

  <p>"It's true that this small snake is not from the divine land. It was given to me by a master outside of it," Luo Zheng answered with a small smile.</p>

  <p>Before Luo Zheng came back to the divine land, Ramzi, Timotheus, and the others had been worried about him. Thus, they gave him some weapons which could help him in times of need.</p>

  <p>Ramzi gave Luo Zheng three thunder talismans, Leopold gave him a pill, and Timotheus gave him the golden snake.</p>

  <p>"It's beautiful! How powerful is this little thing?" Augustus asked again.</p>

  <p>To that, Luo Zheng blinked and shook his head. "I haven't tried it yet, but I think it can deal with a consummate True God."</p>

  <p>After all, it was a life-saving object Timotheus had given to him. He had never used it and perhaps, it could be more powerful than he had imagined. Now he thought that it was a good idea to give it to Luo Nian as a protective weapon.</p>

  <p>When Yudie heard his words, her expression quickly changed and she said, "You should keep such a treasure for defense. You don't have to give it to Luo Nian. It's too..."</p>

  <p>Before she could even finish, Augustus began to bargain with Luo Nian and did not pay her words any attention.</p>

  <p>"Luo Nian, can you give this little golden snake to me? I'll give you ten puppets in exchange!"</p>

  <p>"No way!"</p>

  <p>"Twenty puppets!"</p>

  <p>"No!"</p>

  <p>"I can also help you make whatever you want. I can help you make..."</p>

  <p>"No!"</p>

  <p>"Can you lend me the snake to study?</p>

  <p>Just for two days!"</p>

  <p>As for Luo Zheng, he could only smile helplessly as the two bargained with each other.</p>

  <p>Just then, his lips curved down into a frown. His consciousness entered the space ring, in which there was a mouse corpse whose fur emitted a faint glow.</p>

  <p>The mouse corpse belonged to the Stone Mouse that Luo Zheng had encountered back when he had just entered the divine land.</p>

  <p>Master Evil had kept the Stone Mouse, but the creature had unexpectedly swallowed him and as a result, he had lost his body.</p>

  <p>After that, the Stone Mouse tried to devour Luo Zheng's cinnabar field, only to be poisoned to death after it swallowed the chaotic energy in Luo Zheng's inner world.</p>

  <p>According to Master Evil, this one-of-a-kind true spirit once helped a True God to become a Holy Being and could be reincarnated. With the help of the mouse corpse, one could find the reincarnation of the Stone Mouse. The Stone Mouse was valuable, even if it was dead.</p>

  <p>Then again, Luo Zheng had gotten many divine might coins later on, so he hadn't sold the mouse corpse.</p>

  <p>What he didn't expect was that the mouse corpse had some changes today. It meant that the new Stone Mouse was just born somewhere in the divine land.</p>

  <p>With that thought, he awakened Master Evil deep in his mind.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong, Luo Zheng? Have you found a body for me?"</p>

  <p>Master Evil had been sealed for a long time, so he was still in a daze after he woke up.</p>

  <p>"No," Luo Zheng replied. It was true that he did not have a chance to find a body suitable for Master Evil at the bottom of the chaos over the years.</p>

  <p>"But there is something strange about the mouse corpse," he continued.</p>

  <p>"That Stone Mouse? Has it been reincarnated?" Master Evil was slightly stunned, and his eyes were immediately filled with excitement.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded in response. Then, he raised his hand, and the grey Stone Mouse's corpse fell out of the space ring.</p>

  <p>Opposite of him were Augustus and Luo Nian, the former still pleading for the golden snake. When he saw the mouse corpse, however, he asked,</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, what's that?"</p>
