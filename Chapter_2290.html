<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Joy finally put a stop to the ongoing drama between Luo Zheng and Han Liusu.</p>

  <p>In the end, Luo Zheng hadn't promised Han Liusu a thing.</p>

  <p>In Zheng's opinion, Mu Ning, Tianming, Ning Yudie and the others in the fairy palace were all creatures born in the Evolutionary Universe and had been closely related to the life and death of the latter.</p>

  <p>Han Liusu, on the other hand, was different. Judging from the overall situation, she was just an outsider. It was unwise for her to get involved in what Luo Zheng was facing, and he simply wasn't willing to do so.</p>

  <p>Ultimately, Han Liusu ended up leaving bitterly, with disappointment in her eyes. As he looked at her retreating figure, Luo Zheng couldn't help but feel at a loss.</p>

  <p>Joy didn't mention anything about the dispute between the two. She had a faint feeling that she'd be faced with a choice; the Floating Islands and even the entire divine land would be faced with a choice.</p>

  <p>Ever since the Floating Islands and the Hall of Holy Beings had been established, the divine land had lasted for countless divine eras.</p>

  <p>For ordinary mortals, this was considered an eternal existence.</p>

  <p>To the True Gods who were immortal, on the other hand, they had lived longer, and thus, they could see many crises.</p>

  <p>There was a saying that the divine land was falling and was about to be destroyed, and another one that said the Time Sea was expanding. They were also trapped in the endless debate concerning the Godly Ways, and up until now, there still hadn't been a complete conclusion.</p>

  <p>In the endless time, these paradoxes were ultimately hard to prove. These caused the True Gods and even the Holy Beings to feel even more confused.</p>

  <p>A few hours had passed.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was in one of the best practice rooms of the Purple Soul Hall.</p>

  <p>The warriors who were capable of using these practice rooms were mostly the top-rank True Gods in the Purple Soul Hall.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng sat up straight and turned his hand over. In the blink of an eye, the Golden Beast Statue appeared before him.</p>

  <p>The Golden Beast Statue was a special kind of beast that looked neither like a lion nor a tiger. Luo Zheng didn't know what the beast was exactly.</p>

  <p>Since the Han Clan was willing to pull the treasure out and treat it like a reward, it clearly had to be a valuable treasure in and of itself. Due to such, Luo Zheng made the decision to take some time to refine it.</p>

  <p>After observing the Golden Beast Statue for a short while, he noticed a small round divine texture on its back side.</p>

  <p>Upon noticing the divine texture, Luo Zheng touched it with his finger and injected it with a hint of chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>Hiss! Hiss!</p>

  <p>The chaotic energy surged down the divine texture, and the latter began to spin. Then, it slowly rose, forming a small funnel. It was an amazing sight to watch.</p>

  <p>'Do I need to put a drop of my blood into it so that I'll become its master?' he wondered.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng narrowed his eyes slightly. With a flick of his fingertip, a drop of golden blood quietly flew toward the divine texture.</p>

  <p>Once the golden blood began flowing down the small funnel, he somehow felt like there was a kind of connection between him and the statue.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, the Golden Beast Statue seemed to come to life, and countless glimmers of golden light began to emit from its surface.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, under Zheng's control, the beast began to walk around the practice room.</p>

  <p>'This Golden Beast Statue is mighty powerful and can change its shape at will. The material seems to be...' Luo Zheng thought to himself. A second later, his face changed into a strange expression.</p>

  <p>Back in the Evolutionary Universe, the bodies created by the Celestial Position race for the nine Genuine Dragons were in fact heavenly bodies.</p>

  <p>A heavenly body could change its shape freely, but it wasn't really that solid. Its advantage was obvious: it could form itself a new body after being destroyed.</p>

  <p>The Golden Beast Statue in front of him was also made from heavenly essence. This one was unique though, and several complicated materials seemed to have been added in order to make it abnormally solid.</p>

  <p>'Can the statue take on a human figure?' he wondered to himself once again.</p>

  <p>As this thought came to Luo Zheng, the statue slowly stood up straight like a human, and its golden fur gradually fused into its body. Its beast head also progressively transformed into a human's head. At the end of it all, the Golden Beast Statue had transformed into a human figure that was as tall as Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Master Evil!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng removed Master Evil's soul seal in his mind and called out his name.</p>

  <p>After entering the Floating Island, Luo Zheng had faced too many strong warriors. In order to avoid being discovered, Master Evil had sealed himself in Zheng's mind. Now that Luo Zheng had freed his seal, Master Evil looked around and quickly noticed the golden figure in the practice room.</p>

  <p>"What's this?" Master Evil asked, taking an even closer look at the figure, curiosity taking over him.</p>

  <p>"This is the Golden Beast Statue, and it can change its shape freely. For that reason, I asked it to transform into a human figure, and it can be your body, right?" Luo Zheng said with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Hmm...Can the Golden Beast Statue transform into whatever you want?" Master Evil's expression began to morph, and excitement sparkled deep in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng hadn't yet replied a single word, Master Evil could easily guess his arrangement.</p>

  <p>Master Evil's physical body was completely destroyed, and he was really having difficulties finding another suitable one. After all, this Golden Beast Statue seemed to be a supreme primordial weapon. If it could change its shape freely, then Master Evil figured he just might be capable of using the statue as his body. It was better than hiding in Zheng's mind and sleeping.</p>

  <p>At that, Master Evil floated out from Zheng's mind and floated into the Golden Beast Statue. Once Luo Zheng transferred the right of controlling the statue to Master Evil, the statue morphed once more and soon changed into Master Evil's exact appearance. The only difference was that the body was still glistening.</p>

  <p>"But I'm afraid it isn't too convenient for me to walk around the Han Clan's Floating Island with my current appearance." Just as Master Evil finished speaking, he quickly transformed into a lion. He looked like golden lightning, streaking around the large practice room. After a while, he transformed into a long snake, wriggling continuously along the floor.</p>

  <p>This appearance made him very excited.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng no longer cared about Master Evil, and he fixed his eyes on the plate that previously held the statue.</p>

  <p>He had fought so hard in the Arena of Legends for such a long time, in order to obtain this plate. He strongly hoped that the mud used to build this plate would help him break through the bottleneck.</p>

  <p>Why had the Golden Beast Statue been placed on such a plate? What a pity it was that confirming the Golden Beast Statue's origin was so difficult! If such hadn't been the case, perhaps Luo Zheng would have been more successful in finding this kind of mud.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>A crack suddenly appeared on the mud plate, just as Luo Zheng gently pressed it with his hand. As he gently twisted it, a sixth of the mud broke off. His inner world was already brimming with hunger and thirst, constantly urging him to feed it with the mud.</p>

  <p>Without a moment's hesitation, he threw the mud into his inner world.</p>

  <p>Plop!</p>

  <p>Once the mud plopped down into Zheng's chaotic sea, there was actually no movement to be seen at all.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng could only observe this scene nervously. The mud couldn't have lost its effect just because it had been dug too long ago, could it?</p>

  <p>He reflected on the possibility carefully. The first mud he absorbed had been really slow to react. It had been dug out by the Tie Clan for a long time, while the fresh mud he had obtained from the cave had really reacted very quickly.</p>

  <p>The mud used to make the plate to hold the Golden Beast Statue had been dug out for a longer period of time. He estimated that the reaction time could be longer.</p>

  <p>That said though, the waiting process was a sufferance. If the mud really was useless after being dug out for so long, then Luo Zheng would have to delay the moment he'd form his Godly Tile.</p>

  <p>It took about an hour, but felt much, much longer.</p>

  <p>A single bubble floated out from the bottom of the chaotic sea. Soon after, more and more bubbles began to emerge.</p>

  <p>As he watched the scene play out before him, Luo Zheng sighed with relief. It seemed that there was no reason for him to worry, after all.</p>

  <p>As the bubbles constantly emerged, a small cloud formed in the sky above the chaotic sea. As the cloud spread, Luo Zheng integrated his internal momentum directly into it. Not long after, a huge sword cloud appeared.</p>

  <p>The mud that Luo Zheng had just thrown in was a lot larger than both previous times, and the sword cloud was naturally even larger. As soon as the sword cloud was condensed, it floated toward the Godly Plate in the center of his inner world.</p>

  <p>With his previous successful experiences, Luo Zheng didn't need to stare at the sword cloud to condense the Godly Tile. Instead, this time, he continued to crush the mud and throw it into his inner world, piece by piece.</p>

  <p>It didn't take long before a large number of sword clouds slowly floated in the air in Zheng's inner world, and the crystal in the Godly Plate became bigger and bigger.</p>
