<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It was true that Zheng's requirements were too much, but what could they do?</p>

  <p>He had cut off Chuck's and Ford's hands easily just now, and the masters were powerless against him.</p>

  <p>Not to mention that Zheng asked them to return the properties three times, even if he asked for thirty times, they still had no other choices.</p>

  <p>The masters felt ridiculous now. They had guessed how strong Zheng was before and planned to fight him by organizing a group.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng broke in right in front of them and subdued all of them with his much stronger power.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Chuck kept silent, even though Zheng had killed his son.</p>

  <p>He was a wise man as he had put the Huang Clan at the front lines of C County, but he knew that they couldn't defeat Zheng since he was too strong.</p>

  <p>Although Chuck had more plots and strategies, they would only look foolish in a battle against Zheng, a man with such huge strength. Zheng had defeated the strongest of C County, so who else could stop him?</p>

  <p>The room remained dead silent as all of them had no other choices and mentally felt so weak.</p>

  <p>The property that took them great efforts to obtain should be returned intact to the Luo clan, and they were even asked to compensate three times its value. The masters found it so hard to accept, so they all kept quiet.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng fiddled with the delicate teacup in his hand. The water slowly swirled inside as it was affected by Zheng's aura, and none of them knew how he did it.</p>

  <p>The masters felt the water wave around because of Zheng's aura, no doubt.</p>

  <p>The force Zheng gave off gradually increased. It not only contained Zheng's strong soul power, but also a bit of malicious aura.</p>

  <p>The paper-thin window lattices couldn't bear the force and cracked little by little, the sound audible enough for all the people to hear.</p>

  <p>The malicious aura grew even stronger. They all felt their throats run dry, and their breaths fell short. It was impossible for them to just calmly sit down.</p>

  <p>"If you can't decide in ten seconds, I'll make it four times," Zheng said slowly. The water in his teacup seemed to boil as the little drips continuously jumped up and down.</p>

  <p>"I agree!</p>

  <p>The Zhang Clan are willing to return the property of the Luo Clan! On top of that, we will also give you three times of it as compensation," the master of the Zhang Clan exclaimed. He was the first one who couldn't bear it anymore and gave in.</p>

  <p>"We also consent and we will compensate!</p>

  <p>We will return the mines and gambling business to the Luo Clan!" the master of the He clan said with gritted teeth. In truth, these masters couldn't tolerate it any longer, but they tried their best to not speak it out.</p>

  <p>Now that one of them gave in, the rest felt disheartened and did the same as well.</p>

  <p>In the end, Chuck also nodded his head and said, "Our Huang Clan also agrees to pay the loss of the Luo Clan."</p>

  <p>"Okay. You've made the right choice," Zheng said with a slight smile on his face. Then his eyes turned to Ford. Although Ford had said yes to him, he had other problems with Ford. "Ford Qi, where is my father's sword, the Green Wind Rider Sword?" Zheng stared sharply at him and asked in a low voice.</p>

  <p>Ford's heart sank. Since he had lost an arm already, he internally hoped that Zheng would let him go if he compensated for the Luo Clan. However, that seemed to be just a dream now.</p>

  <p>The other masters looked at him pitifully. Years ago, he, Bryson, and Ken plotted to kill Zheng's father. The masters had heard about it more or less.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, please. I can return you your father's sword. But since so many years have passed, can you just let it go? We, the Clan of Qi, can compensate for it five times its value! No, we offer six times!" Ford said hastily.</p>

  <p>Ford couldn't almost speak as he realized he was close to death.</p>

  <p>"You're asking me to let it go?" Zheng asked coldly. "In your eyes, my father's death should not be mentioned, like a gasp of the wind.</p>

  <p>You're the master of the Qi Clan. Don't you feel ridiculous saying that?</p>

  <p>I don't want my father's sword anymore, or your compensation either— but I ask for your life!"</p>

  <p>The immense pressure Ford felt made his legs feel as heavy as lead.</p>

  <p>However, he still tried his best to run outside.</p>

  <p>When Zheng saw Ford escape, he didn't go after him. However, when Ford opened the door, he saw a girl who stood outside. She had long legs and a beautiful face. She was so pretty that people's hearts beat fast at seeing her— but her eyes held a strong killing intent. Moreover, she held a sword in her hand.</p>

  <p>Ford felt that the blood-red sword seemed to have consumed countless amounts of people's blood. It was as if it could also absorb his own blood.</p>

  <p>"Who, who are you..."</p>

  <p>The girl didn't respond. She simply turned around and changed into a storm of malicious aura, then charged at Ford.</p>

  <p>The malicious storm could break Patrick Pei's Acalanatha's shadow. Ford could not bear it at all. He was cut into pieces in a second! Yet, the girl didn't seem to have a real body. Her snow-white skin and strange clothes didn't get stained by Ford's blood at all.</p>

  <p>When the masters saw the girl at the door, they all became numb with fright. Chuck even forgot to apply pressure to the wound of his broken arm, so he bled profusely.</p>

  <p>The girl seemed to be more frightening than Zheng!</p>

  <p>How come they never heard of her? Was she Zheng's sister, Yan?</p>

  <p>However, she seemed not. Although she looked pretty as a girl, her eyes were thin and she wasn't human at all. Why would such a strong, nonhuman being follow Zheng?</p>

  <p>Zheng felt satisfied when he saw the scared looks on the masters' faces. He came today not only to ask for the property the Luo Clan had lost, but also to build his presence in C County.</p>

  <p>He would go to a bigger world and wasn't sure when he would come back. Yan would do the same as well.</p>

  <p>These masters weren't strong, but they had great ambitions. If he and Yan left, these people would probably seek out the property of the Luo Clan, and there was no one strong enough to protect his clan.</p>

  <p>That was why Zheng had done it himself!</p>

  <p>He wanted to let them know that he could easily destroy their clans.</p>

  <p>Now, he seemed to have gotten what he wanted. If the masters were wise enough, they shouldn't cause any troubles for the Luo Clan anymore.</p>

  <p>After that whole fiasco, a great number of people recently visited Luo clan.</p>

  <p>The first group were the fifty representatives from the government of C County. They brought plenty of treasures and came to show their gratitude under the lead of C County's highest official. The treasures they brought were the reward for killing the Blood Prisoner. The government previously announced that anyone who found the Blood Prisoner would be rewarded greatly. However, there should be more rewards for Zheng as he killed the Blood Prisoner by himself.</p>

  <p>As for the fact that Bryson had hidden the Blood Prisoner in the Luo Clan, the official seemed to have forgotten it even though the Luo clan should be condemned for that. The official thought he should try his best to please Zheng, so of course he didn't dare mention that.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the deeds of the houses, mines, gambling businesses, and markets from the top five clans all went to the Luo Clan. Any piece from the deeds could make an ordinary family wealthy— and now they piled up in front of the Luo Clan like a small mountain.</p>

  <p>The members of Luo Clan all looked different now. Everyone of them felt happy and ecstatic. Who knew that Zheng could change the fate of the Luo Clan in just a few days? No one could've done it, including Bryson and even Zheng's father, Mike. Zheng was the only one who had done it in the many generations of the Luo Clan.</p>

  <p>One fine morning three days later, the servant who cleaned the gate area of the Luo Clan got up early. He fixed himself and after that, grabbed his broom and started to clean the area around the gate.</p>

  <p>There were too many visitors during these days and he cleaned it every day to keep the gate area neat. In his eyes, the gate was like the face of the Luo Clan.</p>

  <p>He cleaned the area carefully and didn't feel tired at all. He felt energetic, even.</p>

  <p>As someone who had worked for the Luo Clan for dozens of years, he was really glad to see the changes in the Luo Clan happen. Besides, the new housekeeper had offered to give all the servants a salary raise. All of their salaries had been tripled!</p>

  <p>So, why didn't he feel excited about it?</p>

  <p>All of this was brought about by Zheng.</p>

  <p>The servant carefully swept the ground and made this area as clean as possible.</p>

  <p>At that moment, a young man walked out of the gate with a girl after him.</p>

  <p>The young man was handsome. He greeted the servant with a 'good morning, ' then the girl after him smiled and nodded at him. The girl was so pretty that it stunned the servant.</p>

  <p>The servant realized that he forgot to greet them when they had disappeared at the corner of the street.</p>

  <p>'The master of the Luo Clan has left in this way...' the servant thought with a last wistful glance.</p>

  <p>C Country's problems had almost been solved. Even if Zheng wasn't at home, the Luo Clan could develop well. The Luo Clan had become the top clan of C County, except that its members weren't the strongest.</p>

  <p>The compensation the five clans gave was equal to sixty percent of C County.</p>

  <p>Now, Zheng didn't have much to do there and he had more business to do outside the county. That was more important to him.</p>

  <p>Zheng still remembered that Aura Su hadn't appeared until the end of the All Peaks Competition.</p>

  <p>The public knew that the princes were vying for the throne of Burning Sky Empire. Except for the Cloud Sect that didn't bother to show their preference, the top seven noble clans and many other small ones had chosen the prince they supported, in hopes of getting great benefits after their chosen prince would ascend to the throne. The whole Imperial Capital had become quite tense.</p>

  <p>Aura Su was Kane Su's first daughter. As the Sky Princess, she was destined to be involved in this battle.</p>

  <p>The world of political struggle was cruel, so Zheng was highly worried for the proud princess. Was the dignified and noble royal safe?</p>
