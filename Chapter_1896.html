<br/><br/>

  

  <p>They had traveled about 100, 000 miles when the cold flames below their feet began to blaze and the azure light reflected off them continuously, making it hard to look straight at them.</p>

  <p>It was as if everyone was standing on a sea of fire, but the azure flames weren't making them feel warm.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a member of the Divinity Hunt Squad of the Collapsing Mountain race fell towards the cold flames below.</p>

  <p>Kaydan was quick to react. He spread his wings, turned into a streak of light, and took off into the air, circling below the Collapsing Mountain member and saving him from falling.</p>

  <p>"No one can save you if you fall into the cold flames. So if you can't hold on any longer, don't be a hero," reminded Kaydan.</p>

  <p>The upper echelons of the three races were also prepared to compete with each other. None of the members of the Collapsing Mountain race's Divinity Hunt Squad had eaten any Gold Sun Fruit. As pure body refiners, it was impossible for them to understand the meaning of the Ice Law.</p>

  <p>Extreme cold was a means of body refining, but there was no need to take such a huge risk.</p>

  <p>"Avery! Eat it!" ordered Chapman.</p>

  <p>The warrior called Avery nodded and swallowed the Gold Sun Fruit in one gulp.</p>

  <p>In addition to him, another member of the Skyland race had also given up forcing himself. He too swallowed the Gold Sun Fruit, and Kaydan continued to lead the way while the rest followed behind.</p>

  <p>As the cold flame poison that had wafted into Zheng's inner world increased and condensed, the snow in that world grew heavier and heavier.</p>

  <p>The creatures in the inner world were currently experiencing an unprecedented winter.</p>

  <p>Although the chaotic sea was not frozen, its temperature had dropped considerably.</p>

  <p>If the temperature continued to drop, the creatures in his inner world would most likely face death on a massive scale.</p>

  <p>Losing some of those creatures wouldn't have much of an impact on Zheng.</p>

  <p>After all, he wasn't reliant on the Faith Energy of those people right now.</p>

  <p>But he still didn't want the people he had created to die.</p>

  <p>As Zheng pondered this, his thoughts rippled and moved.</p>

  <p>Countless schools of fish suddenly appeared from within the chaotic sea.</p>

  <p>They leapt out of the water, spread their wings, and flew into the sky.</p>

  <p>The fishermen in the inner world witnessed this scene and there were people who recorded it. They would pass it down for years to come.</p>

  <p>Legend would have it that the fish had turned into big birds to save people from the heavy snow.</p>

  <p>They didn't know that this was just an idea of Zheng's.</p>

  <p>Once the fish took off into the air, they charged towards the pieces of cold flame poison, turned into chaotic energy the minute they got into contact, and devoured the pieces of the poison.</p>

  <p>Zheng tried his best to keep the cold flame poison in midair. At the same time, the nine stars in the sky began to move unceasingly.</p>

  <p>"Nine shining stars!"</p>

  <p>Zheng did not draw out the energy within the stars. Instead, he allowed the nine stars to move about with their own strength.</p>

  <p>Drilling wood was a method to make fire, in which matter could produce heat while moving at high speeds. Only then could flames emerge from the wooden board. Heat is generated during the movement.</p>

  <p>The hotter a star was, the more intense its internal activities would be.</p>

  <p>Even Zheng was horrified at the powerful energy created by the nine stars.</p>

  <p>If these forces were to be mobilized, the heat emitted would be beyond imagination.</p>

  <p>As a result, the temperature that had dropped slowly began to rise under the illumination of the nine stars.</p>

  <p>Even after he had settled his inner world down, Zheng was still unhurried and followed the rest of the group.</p>

  <p>By the time they had traveled one hundred and twenty thousand miles, there were only two people in the Divinity Hunt Squad who hadn't eaten the Gold Sun Fruit.</p>

  <p>Skyland race had done better. As cultivators, their comprehension and adaptability towards the laws were usually much better than the Collapsing Mountain race's. But the Collapsing Mountain members relied on their physical bodies to resist this. So there wasn't any single, simple standard to measure which race was stronger.</p>

  <p>By now, the Harmony race had only one warrior left: their leader, Tilton.</p>

  <p>People from the Harmony race were peaceful. Some of them could have made it this far, but they did not like to fight and knew that there was no need for them to show off. So many of them had retreated and swallowed the Gold Sun Fruit.</p>

  <p>Even the three leaders, Chapman, Tilton, and Kaydan, looked more and more exhausted as they resisted the erosion of the raging cold flame.</p>

  <p>They had become more and more focused in their quest to resist the cold flame poison. At the beginning, they had paid attention to Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>But then they could only focus on moving forward, using all the energy in their bodies to protect themselves.</p>

  <p>All other warriors were paying attention to Zheng.</p>

  <p>When Holy Jay had stepped into the Holy Realm, he was conferred the title of one of the three newly promoted Holy Beings; but he never accepted a disciple.</p>

  <p>Convention dictates that once a Holy Being gains a new understanding of the profound meaning of the laws in the divine land, they would turn their own comprehension of the laws into monolith inscriptions and spread it throughout the world. After all, at their level, they have mastered all the laws. And the space in which new profound mysteries of the laws are being explored in the divine land is growing smaller and smaller.</p>

  <p>But Holy Jay had broken the rules and refused to pass down the inscriptions. Instead, he sealed the profound meaning of the Ice Soul Flame, attracting countless talents to enter this place to comprehend it.</p>

  <p>None of them had succeeded.</p>

  <p>It is said that a Holy Being once questioned Holy Jay about it. But Holy Jay had just nodded with a smile and hadn't said anything."</p>

  <p>A martial artist wearing a purple hat was leisurely talking on a flying shuttle.</p>

  <p>What he said wasn't unfamiliar to the martial artists in the divine land.</p>

  <p>They had heard about it several times already. But some of the secondary creatures that came from the universe were listening with rapt attention.</p>

  <p>The difference between a secondary creature and a divine land martial artist wasn't just a matter of resources and birth, but also of information.</p>

  <p>This meant that, including Zheng, all the secondary creatures were very careful and would do their best to gather information about the divine land.</p>

  <p>The purple-hatted warrior was happy to show off when he saw the other warriors focusing their attention. "Actually, according to my speculations, if you want to comprehend the Ice Soul Flame, you need to rely on your own strength, instead of using the Gold Sun Fruit to cross the cold flame field. It's a pity that no one has succeeded so far! Even Pascal only lasted 130, 000 miles. But he had also been defeated in the end. He was so close!"</p>

  <p>At these words, Liusu and Aleyna looked at each other. Kennan responded from the sideline, "Someone had raised this idea a long time ago. Now you're claiming that it is your own. So shameless! My young master was indeed defeated and had been close, but how far did you travel?"</p>

  <p>The purple-hatted warrior was embarrassed at Kennan's words.</p>

  <p>After all, it was an achievement for Pascal to have reached 130, 000 miles. The important thing was that he hadn't even been a world lord yet at the time. He had only been at the Spirit Transformation Realm.</p>

  <p>And once he had become a world lord, he had no longer been willing to come.</p>

  <p>The profound meaning of the Ice Soul Flame was strong, but Pascal, who had cultivated both body and life vitality, was a young prince after all.</p>

  <p>He hadn't taken it too seriously.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng had paid part of his attention to resisting the cold flame poison, his eyes and ears had also been focused on the martial artist in the purple hat.</p>

  <p>'To walk to the end of the cold flame field?'</p>

  <p>He had already walked over 120, 000 miles, and had only 20, 000 miles to go.</p>

  <p>What would happen to him if he reached the end by himself? Would he be able to comprehend the Ice Soul Flame?</p>

  <p>Zheng had no idea how powerful this martial art was. But he did know that since it was a skill inherited from a Holy Being, it wasn't a weak one.</p>

  <p>Zheng's interest was piqued at this thought. He had been considering whether it was necessary to continue on like this. If it was just a pure test without any rewards, then there was no need to force it. He was not a masochist.</p>

  <p>Now it seemed that it was necessary to give it a try.</p>

  <p>It was not long before everyone finally broke through the 130, 000 miles.</p>

  <p>The second they had reached that mark, something unexpected happened.</p>

  <p>Tilton of the Harmony race gave up and swallowed a Gold Sun Fruit.</p>

  <p>Chapman was the only one of the Collapsing Mountain race that persisted. There were only two people left from the Skyland race: Kaydan and an elder named Fraine.</p>

  <p>And at this moment, Fraine fell downward without a word.</p>

  <p>Zheng had been focused on resisting the cold flame poison. He didn't have the time to be distracted. And by the time he discovered the problem, the elder had already fallen.</p>

  <p>"Fraine!"</p>

  <p>"Elder Fraine!"</p>

  <p>Some warriors screamed and rushed towards the elder, but they couldn't get there in time.</p>

  <p>The crowd watched as Elder Fraine was struck by the cold flames below and turned into a lump of ice, falling hard towards the ground.</p>

  <p>Fraine tried to save himself.</p>

  <p>As he fell, his entire body was still emitting raging flames. He wanted to resist the ice flames, but the bright yellow flames were only formed from life vitality. So how could they fight the power of the ice flames?</p>

  <p>The raging flames then disappeared from everyone's sight and then, cracking sounds could be heard, like glass hitting the ground. It was the sound of Fraine's body shattering.</p>

  <p>A deep fear took root within everyone, reflecting in their eyes. Many of them subconsciously raised themselves up. Although they all knew how terrifying this cold flame was, witnessing the death of that elder with their own eyes truly brought the horror home.</p>
