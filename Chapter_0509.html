<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Luo Zheng was already thinking of how to utilize the malicious Mu Ning in these blood-colored crystals. Since he had already accumulated some malicious Mu Ning and he would keep accumulating more and more malicious Mu Ning in the future, it would be best if he chose and learned a cultivation method that would help him make good use of it. But for now, he would have to resolve the leftover issues of the Luo Clan and clean up its disloyal troublemakers.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng turned to face the members of the Luo Clan, announcing loudly but solemnly, "Bryson Luo has now been executed. Ken Luo remains to be sentenced. Ken was the secondary conspirator in my father's death. He doesn't deserve a death sentence for his crime, so I leave you all to decide how to punish him. Tomorrow, I'd like to pay my respects to Luo's ancestral graves. I will personally visit and pray at the tombs of our ancestors for a prosperous future of the Luo Clan." After his announcement, Luo Zheng handed over the entire business of the Martial Arts Hall to his other uncles and the other elders of the Luo Clan. Having executed the troublesome Bryson Luo, Zheng's job here was done. He trusted that after taking control of the Luo Clan, the elders would tackle the rest of the issues better than he would.</p>

  <p>After hearing Zheng's announcement, Ken's pale face finally regained a bit of color. He had thought himself doomed to die. The idea that Luo Zheng would keep him alive never occurred to him. As he watched Luo Zheng turn around and leave— his strong, broad back coming into view— Ken's eyes glazed over with awe for his nephew. Luo Zheng was no longer a small boy. He had grown up to become a man who could well handle the affairs of the Luo Clan. Even in heaven, Ken's brother, Mike Luo, would be happy to see his son lead the clan into a new flourishing era.</p>

  <p>The Dragon Garden was where the eldest branch of the Luo Clan had lived before.</p>

  <p>But since the death of Mike Luo, the eldest branch had declined. The Dragon Garden had been sealed up, becoming a forbidden place for anyone in the Luo Clan to enter.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, people walked past the Dragon Garden to take a quick glimpse at it, but seldom did anybody step inside.</p>

  <p>Due to neglect, the estate saw many weeds cropping up here and there, as high as an adult person. The walls of the garden had thick layers of dust atop of them.</p>

  <p>Today, dozens of Luo Clan servants rushed to the Dragon Garden to tidy it up. They swept the ground, removed the weeds, and pruned the bonsais. So dedicated were they that the place was as good as new in no time. It was transformed from a cold and desolated place into one that radiated joy and liveliness, all in half a day. This renewed Dragon Garden had been the reminiscent of the olden days for everyone in the Luo Clan. They all missed those golden days when the Luo Clan had still been the strongest clan in C County.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng and Yan finished their meals and walked into the Dragon Garden, they were stunned at the scenery before them.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't give any orders to the servants to clean up the Dragon Garden, but there were some thoughtful ones in the family who always did more than they were asked to.</p>

  <p>As Yan stepped inside, a wide smile across her lips, she made her way to a swing in the corner. When she had been a toddler, this had been her favorite place to play. So much time had passed. In all these years, the original ropes of the swing had decayed. She saw that they were replaced with a pair of new ropes that the servants probably tied up earlier today.</p>

  <p>Sitting on the swing, she swayed back and forth as it moved in the wind.</p>

  <p>Her long slender legs hung in the air. It reminded her of freedom. She might be physically restrained because of the existence of that evil man, but at this moment, she didn't care. Her mind was free as her eyes roamed across the beautiful sky. She had her wonderful, loving brother at her side and nothing else could make her happier. Seeing the heartfelt smile on Yan's beautiful face, Luo Zheng smiled too. This was the first time he saw her smile so freely since their reunion with each other. To Luo Zheng, it felt like his happiest moment after so many years of separation from his sister.</p>

  <p>Yan was still a little girl. She was just forced to take a lot of brunt on her small shoulders, all because of her special physical constitution and her extraordinary talent.</p>

  <p>Even now, she couldn't escape those restraints.</p>

  <p>Although Kenneth had agreed to let Yan come home with Luo Zheng this time, he had warned Luo Zheng not to try to help her run away, for it would be in vain.</p>

  <p>The evil man had already imprinted a mark on Yan. Wherever she escaped, no matter how far, he would find her. Revolting against such a powerful man so blatantly and publicly would not be a good idea, at least not at the moment. If that man found out about Zheng's defiance, things could only get worse for them.</p>

  <p>At first, Luo Zheng had wanted to take Yan into the fairy palace, which was so mysterious and astonishing that even Luo Zheng found it indecipherable.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng was only the temporary owner of the fairy palace. There were so many things that he was not authorized to do there. He couldn't be sure the palace would be safe enough for Yan to stay in.</p>

  <p>Yan was still on the swing. The sun was setting. As the last rays of sunlight glimmered on Yan, she looked as beautiful as a painting, beyond description in words.</p>
