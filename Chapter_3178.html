<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3178 The First Place </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>At that moment, no one cared who would win first place in the Seven Mountains Meeting.</p>

  <p>They all stared upward, only wanting to know who would win the fight? Zheng or Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>Each of the giant stones could only be lifted by the force of two hundred divine megatons, and they were moving at such speed. Anyone on those stones would surely be severely injured after that collision.</p>

  <p>Even Tacy and the others from the Land of Sword Grief were shocked by what was occurring.</p>

  <p>"I feel quite small now after seeing their performance."</p>

  <p>"I too participated in the Seven Mountains Meeting once, but I was far inferior to them!" Everyone chimed in their words of praise and amazement.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The two huge stones collided head on in the air. The elite warriors behind Feng Ge were thrown off and hit the distant mountain wall, all of them seriously injured on impact.</p>

  <p>When they saw this, Mekhi and the others from the Flow Sword Sect understood why Zheng had asked them to leave. He had saved them from devastating pain.</p>

  <p>Only Zheng and Feng Ge remained fixed to their stones.</p>

  <p>As the huge stones bounced back, they both moved to stand on the runes that would activate the enchanted barrier. They had both realized that after a collision like that, the best thing to do was activate the enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>Rumble...</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the stones wrapped by enchanted barriers had crashed into the walls of the cave, leaving two massive craters.</p>

  <p>The cave walls shook, causing rubble to crumble down and leave a layer of dust floating and obscuring everyone's view.</p>

  <p>They looked up and around, trying to see something, but no giant stone flew out. No movement could be seen at all.</p>

  <p>Tacy then released her spiritual sense to pass through the dust.</p>

  <p>Her eyes brightened and she raised her hand and said, "Princess Feng Ge is out!"</p>

  <p>"Wow..."</p>

  <p>A round of heated discussion broke out among the spectators.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge had performed so well that she seemed to be invincible, and yet she was out in the end!</p>

  <p>Konnor and the others from the Flow Sword Sect looked at Tacy with nervous and hopeful eyes.</p>

  <p>If Tacy were to announce that the Flow Sword Sect was out as well, then everything Zheng had done would be in vain.</p>

  <p>Dorothy studied the side of the mountain too, just as worried as Konnor and the others.</p>

  <p>'Would Zheng be able to withstand such a violent collision?' she thought to herself.</p>

  <p>Jermain and Whitlock waited with bated breath. If Zheng was out, all their competition was gone. Then either the Origin Mountain or the Ivory Mountain would claim the first place.</p>

  <p>Dorothy stared in Zheng's direction frowning, showing all the concern she bore in her heart.</p>

  <p>She waited still to find out if Zheng had been eliminated, and the dust began gradually thinning.</p>

  <p>From the pit in the cave wall, a layer of enchanted barrier spread from the surface of the giant stone. Zheng was between the stone and the wall with his hands still on the rune on the stone.</p>

  <p>The two stones had hit the walls so heavily that the enchanted barriers were unable to withstand the impact. If Zheng had not put himself on the line, he would have been out just like Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>Perhaps Feng Ge did not care enough about the rewards of the Seven Mountains Meeting, but they were still very important to Zheng, especially the Other Shore Treasure made of the Shade Stone.</p>

  <p>In the end, he chose to take an extraordinary amount of the impact with his own body. He had indeed held nothing back and put it all on the line.</p>

  <p>He had reacted similarly to Konnor.</p>

  <p>Konnor had left the stone in his sacrifice, though.</p>

  <p>Zheng did no such thing; he was still pressing the rune of the enchanted barrier with his hands, only his feet on the wall of the cave.</p>

  <p>Tacy was faced with a difficult decision. She didn't know whether to declare Zheng out or not. Eventually, she decided to seek help from the masters staying at the top of the cave.</p>

  <p>She soon got the answer. "The Flow Sword Sect is still in!"</p>

  <p>"Wow!"</p>

  <p>The onlookers caused another uproar, and the walls of the cave rang with excitement.</p>

  <p>Konnor and the others from the Flow Sword Sect all jumped up with joy, and triumphant looks painted on their faces.</p>

  <p>The disciples of the Killing Sword Sect and the Unique Array Sword Sect, on the other hand, lowered their heads, desperate and depleted.</p>

  <p>They felt that the Flow Sword Sect had been extremely lucky.</p>

  <p>They tried their best to stop the Flow Sword Sect's stone, and even Feng Ge, who they saw as the most powerful among them, was still unable to stop them from winning.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>On the opposite cave wall, the giant stone was kicked off by Feng Ge and rolled to the bottom of the cave.</p>

  <p>She emerged through the dust, somehow her clothes as immaculate as ever.</p>

  <p>Her face was once again deadpan, but her eyes gave away her emotions.</p>

  <p>"In that decisive moment, he used his own body to block the giant stone. He has such confidence in his body," Feng Ge murmured to herself, defeated and amazed.</p>

  <p>She had thought of this as she was hurtling towards the cave wall.</p>

  <p>However, the momentum of the giant stone was too terrifying. She decided against it, feeling she'd be gravely injured or possibly even die. Zheng appeared unharmed. He must have known he could take it.</p>

  <p>Zheng dragged the stone and slowly floated towards the metal mountain.</p>

  <p>All other competitors could do nothing but watch helplessly as he flew to the weight rune.</p>

  <p>"Can Zheng lift the stone up all by himself after gaining the second weight rune? He needs to use the force of four hundred divine megatons!" Jermain and the others looked on doubtful.</p>

  <p>Once fused with the second weight rune, the stone's weight would double again. Usually, more than ten warriors were needed to lift the stone to the top of the metal mountain.</p>

  <p>"If only he could not lift up the stone! Hahaha!" Those from the Ivory Mountain were eager to see Zheng fail.</p>

  <p>Zheng merged the stone with the second weight rune and the giant stone fell sharply again. Before it reached the ground, he managed to lift it up once more.</p>

  <p>"What? Unbelievable!"</p>

  <p>"His power is terrifying!"</p>

  <p>"Does he have some Other Shore Token of the strengthening type?" All onlookers had questions of some kind.</p>

  <p>Zheng was carrying the huge stone all by himself. Jermain and Whitlock would be able to compete with him now with the stress he was under.</p>

  <p>But they did not move. They knew they would be condemned for trying to take him on after what he had just endured, but more to it, they weren't sure they could win, even now. Thus neither of them took any action.</p>

  <p>Under everyone's gaze, Zheng flew to the top of the metal mountain, threw the giant stone onto the top plate, and raised his arms in triumph.</p>

  <p>"Woo hoo!"</p>

  <p>Konnor and the other elite members of the Flow Sword Sect raised their hands and roared, filled with pride and excitement.</p>

  <p>Others also began to applaud as the air of joy and amazement continued to flow around everyone.</p>

  <p>Jermain cast a challenging glance at Whitlock and asked, "Do we still need to compete for the second place?"</p>

  <p>The biggest prize was for the number one in the Seven Mountains Meeting.</p>

  <p>The gap between the prizes for second and third places was small enough to not even matter. Whitlock was a cunning man. Even if he had a half chance to win second place, it was not worth the risk of getting eliminated. He'd rather win the third place than neither.</p>

  <p>"Jermain, after you," said Whitlock, cupping his hands.</p>

  <p>Jermain fused the stone with the second weight rune and put the Origin Mountain's stone onto the second plate on the metal mountain. The Ivory Mountain did the same for third place.</p>

  <p>No one left, and they all looked up to the top of the cave.</p>

  <p>After a while, the four figures including Athemar, Winchell and Goran floated out from the top of the cave and slowly landed beside Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Nice to meet you all!" Zheng said, bowing with cupped hands. He had already met them all before.</p>

  <p>The only thing that surprised him was that the old man who was responsible for distributing the flags in the Dragon City was here as well.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! Athemar didn't believe you would win first place. Zheng, you'd better quit the Flow Sword Sect and join the Origin Mountain. We are a hundred times more confident in you!" Winchell joked, grinning widely.</p>
