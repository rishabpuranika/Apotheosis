<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1494 Showing Their Special Skills </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Such was a rare phenomenon, that it could almost be considered a miracle: a star over 80, 000 miles in diameter was forcefully refined just like that! No one else but a Supreme Lord could accomplish such a feat.</p>

  <p>They were so powerful that even a grain of sand couldn't escape a Supreme Lord's heightened senses. When they discovered this particular grain of sand, however, they couldn't help but be surprised.</p>

  <p>When the Supreme Lords saw the little fairy palace back then, they didn't think much about it. It didn't matter to them as it was just a space treasure.</p>

  <p>Now that they had a closer look at this grain of sand, they realized that it wasn't just an ordinary treasure…</p>

  <p>Because that grain of sand had undergone tempering of Supreme Lord Amritpal's fire!</p>

  <p>However, the Supreme Lords couldn't see the mysteries inside the grain of sand. Then again, it was the only thing left unrefined from everything that Supreme Lord Amritpal's fire had burned. Thus, it could be said that the grain of sand was the embodiment of the little fairy palace.</p>

  <p>It floated about in the air for a while, and then it shot towards the north!</p>

  <p>One Supreme Lord wore a cold smirk, before he stretched out one hand and tore apart a vast space. The grain of sand was sucked into the shattered space. Then the surrounding spaces folded together and used their power to easily bind the grain of sand inside it.</p>

  <p>"Such a powerful space treasure is truly unheard of," a Supreme Lord said with a shake of his head.</p>

  <p>There were only a select few treasures that could cause a Supreme Lord to have such thoughts. It was difficult to tempt them— they wouldn't budge even if a supreme divine weapon appeared in front of their faces.</p>

  <p>However, this fairy palace had so many changes that even the Supreme Lords present couldn't see through it. It had even withstood Supreme Lord Amritpal's fire.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the Supreme Lords naturally wanted such a space treasure.</p>

  <p>Before, they only wanted the Crown of Destiny and the Roaring Token, and destroy this space treasure. Now, they sang a different song. This space treasure was definitely a rare treasure.</p>

  <p>"Your name is Zheng, right?" one Supreme Lord, who remembered Zheng's name, said. "You can come out. Although we Saya people are not a big race, we can ensure your survival if you offer this space treasure and the Crown of Destiny with both hands!"</p>

  <p>"Survival? Ha-ha! Kid, although you are only at the Soul Sea Realm, I can make an exception and accept you as my disciple. The price would be your Crown of Destiny and this ever-changing fairy palace," Supreme Lord Ranell of the ogres casually said.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Yao's blood ran cold upon hearing the two Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>These old freaks were only there to steal the Crown of Destiny and the other treasures, but Yao's real goal was to kill Xun.</p>

  <p>It would be quite troublesome for her if Zheng accepted any deal with this group of Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>It was true that the Demon Night was powerful. However, only Supreme Lord Gunter, out of all the Supreme Lords, supported Yao. There really wasn't much that she could do against these old monsters.</p>

  <p>Although she was infuriated, she remained silent. She hadn't expected the situation to escalate to this point.</p>

  <p>'Damn it. So many Supreme Lords came because of Zheng, ' she thought.</p>

  <p>After a while, Zheng's voice once again rang throughout the universe.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha, I am truly honored. Thank you all for your kind intentions, but I have another use for this Crown of Destiny! If you want me to offer it to you with both hands, you are dreaming!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's words made the light in the Supreme Lords' eyes turn frigid.</p>

  <p>How could the Crown of Destiny be of use to a mere Soul Sea Realm martial artist like him? Moreover, how did the boy think he would survive with so many Supreme Lords around him?</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Addison couldn't help but say, "There's no point talking to this boy. Let me break apart this space treasure!"</p>

  <p>Once he finished his words, the black smoke behind him exploded and he rushed to grab the grain of sand!</p>

  <p>"It's only shattering the space treasure. I can do it too. I don't need you to help me out!" said the Supreme Lord who previously bound the grain of sand. He then stretched out his hand and placed the grain of sand between his index finger and thumb.</p>

  <p>At that exact moment, the space around the grain of sand cracked. It continued until it reached the grain of sand.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>This Supreme Lord was an expert in a type of profound mystery of the Space Law, which was the Heavenly Destiny recorded in the Crown of Destiny. Thus, anything held between this Supreme Lord's fingers would be torn apart by space!</p>

  <p>Other than a few supreme divine weapons like the Saint Sky Armor, there was nothing in the universe that could stop this shattering force!</p>

  <p>This Supreme Lord's lips twisted into a cold grin as the crack extended and quickly passed by the grain of sand. He was sure that this space treasure would definitely be destroyed.</p>

  <p>He withdrew his hands after a while and looked at the grain of sand.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, his eyes looked astonished.</p>

  <p>He hadn't had such a look in his eyes in more than ten thousand years ever since he'd been a Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>The grain of sand that should have been shattered was still intact and quietly floated in the distance. His Law of Causality of shattering seemed to have no effect on it.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha, you failed," another Supreme Lord said as he shook his head.</p>

  <p>Then he stepped forward with two divine weapons in his hands: the Golden Demon Awl, and the Pure Light Hammer which were ranked fifty-second on the Universe Spirit Tablet.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lord suddenly pointed the Golden Demon Awl at the grain of sand.</p>

  <p>Then, he swung the Pure Light Hammer and smashed it heavily at the end of the Golden Demon Awl!</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>The crispiest hissing sound anyone had ever heard echoed out.</p>

  <p>While the sound wasn't too loud, it was heard through nearly half of the starry sky. Even some martial artists from other supreme worlds had clearly heard it!</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords present were perfectly fine. However, the martial artists who were far away and cultivating within the stars felt as if their hearts were struck by a heavy blow. Their eyes dimmed and they spat out a mouthful of blood.</p>

  <p>The other martial artists who were weaker had their hearts broken apart.</p>

  <p>The collision between the two divine weapons was so strong that millions of lives even from far away places were dead.</p>

  <p>There were very few martial artists in space, and only a handful of them lived on the stars. If the collision had taken place in a supreme world, trillions of living beings would've died!</p>

  <p>The sound the martial artists on the stars had heard was only the last bit of strength of the collision, but it was already immensely powerful. How much of a terrifying attack would this grain of sand in front of the Golden Demon Owl withstand?</p>

  <p>A finger-sized spark shot out from the top of the Golden Demon Awl.</p>

  <p>When the spark had dispersed, the grain of sand was still intact.</p>

  <p>All the Supreme Lords present were stunned.</p>

  <p>It was known that the Supreme Lords were the most powerful in the universe, even though there were countless incredible mysteries and many dangerous lands as well.</p>

  <p>They were all nothing in a Supreme Lord's eyes. Since they had lived for a hundred million years and counting, it was hard for them to find anything that could surprise them.</p>

  <p>However, this grain of sand was out of their imagination. To add to that, they were also more interested in Zheng's space treasure too!</p>

  <p>"Let me do it!" Supreme Lord Ranell said and stepped forward. Since he was a mid-rank Supreme Lord, he was far more powerful than the Supreme Lords who had previously tried.</p>

  <p>He already had a saber in his hands— the Imperial Mysterious Saber.</p>

  <p>This saber was refined from the last Mysterious Bone Demon of the universe, and it was ranked 27th on the Universal Spirit Tablet!</p>

  <p>The Mysterious Bone Demon had a special talent. It could disrupt the vitality between heaven and earth, and could even absorb an unlimited amount of it. It was because of this ability that the Mysterious Bone Demons had been exterminated. Their race consumed far too much vitality between heaven and earth. It was something that the heavens couldn't tolerate!</p>

  <p>The last living Mysterious Bone Demon had been captured by the ogres' weapon refiner, who had then created the Imperial Mysterious Saber out of it.</p>

  <p>The saber suddenly slashed out, and a crescent-shaped saber light appeared in the sky. As a result, the vitality between the heaven and earth in the sky was disrupted. It spread out everywhere in insanely fluctuating amounts!</p>

  <p>It was all too much to take— the vitality between heaven and earth contained in this saber light was far beyond the imagination of an ordinary martial artist.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>At that moment, the beam of saber light shot towards the grain of sand!</p>
