  <p>
</p>

  <p>In the very center of the Phoenix Palace was the magnificent Supreme Dragon Hall.</p>

  <p>If there was an important guest, or any important event to be held, this was where Eastern Emperor Taiyi would be.</p>

  <p>In front of the hall, two rows of warriors clad in golden armor stood straight, looking steadily forward, and exuding some kind of solemnity.</p>

  <p>Standing before the hall, Zheng felt the solemn aura and put a grave expression on his face.</p>

  <p>The last time he met Eastern Emperor Taiyi was in his resting place? that couldn't be regarded as an official meeting.</p>

  <p>But to think that he was summoned to such a great hall? what were they planning? Feng Ge had also kept everything to herself.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a loud voice resounded from within. "Princess of Spirit Peace,  Zheng Luo, enter the hall!"</p>

  <p>"Princess of Spirit Peace?" Zheng blinked in confusion.</p>

  <p>"It's my title," Feng Ge merely said. "Let's go inside!"</p>

  <p>With a nod, Zheng entered the hall alongside Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>Over twenty people were standing on either side.</p>

  <p>The golden armored warriors outside were merely Oneness Guards, but the people inside were different? almost every one of them emitted an outstandingly strong aura. Zheng even spotted Athemar and Goran standing among them.</p>

  <p>"These people..."</p>

  <p>Zheng observed his periphery and was rather shocked at what he found.</p>

  <p>The people were arranged from front to back according to their strength levels.</p>

  <p>As Oneness Governors, both Athemar and Goran could only be ranked at about the tenth place. The two in the back emitted a deep, unpredictable aura, not much weaker than that of Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>

  <p>These were probably the pillars of the Oneness Mountain or even the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>Quietly, Zheng observed them from the corner of his eyes? they were staring at Zheng with a burning gaze.</p>

  <p>All of them had heard of Zheng, but apart from Athemar and some others, it was the first time they had met him in person. Legends of Zheng on the Other Shore piqued their curiosity.</p>

  <p>After walking along the hall, Zheng bowed before Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>

  <p>The latter smiled and asked, "Zheng, you've been in the Land of Sword Grief for almost two months. You must have made rapid progress. I heard that you are ranked first on the first floor now?"</p>

  <p>Hearing the emperor's words had all the strong warriors on both sides of the hall widen their eyes in shock.</p>

  <p>Only two months after entering the Land of Sword Grief, Zheng was already ranked first on the first floor.</p>

  <p>Such rapid improvement was unheard of.</p>

  <p>Zheng was clearly no ordinary talent.</p>

  <p>"Father, Zheng has ranked first on the first day he entered the Land of Sword Grief. Today, he has already defeated Rocco and now ranks first on the second floor," Feng Ge said indifferently, as though the news wasn't insanely shocking.</p>

  <p>The news of Zheng defeating Rocco hadn't yet spread within the Oneness Sky Palace. Surely, Eastern Emperor Taiyi and his high-ranking officials hadn't heard of it.</p>

  <p>"You defeated Rocco?" An old man next to Athemar looked at Zheng in disbelief.</p>

  <p>The latter merely nodded.</p>

  <p>Smiling, Athemar said, "I heard your nephew was trying to break through to the third floor? but Zheng defeated him. How unexpected."</p>

  <p>The old man smiled bitterly and shook his head. "My nephew is arrogant, but he was defeated by someone who entered the Chaotic Source Realm just a little over three months ago. I'm afraid it will be difficult for him to accept the fact."</p>

  <p>The fact that Zheng ranked first on the first floor within two months was already highly shocking to these high-ranking officials.</p>

  <p>But to think that Zheng had become first on the second floor as well...his progress was amazing.</p>

  <p>It was simply unheard of in the Land of Sword Grief. Even if Zheng had obtained another powerful Other Shore Token, he still had to follow the rules of the Land of Sword Grief.</p>

  <p>In the Land of Sword Grief, people were forbidden to use the abilities of Other Shore Tokens. Instead, they could only use the Other Shore Power to fight against each other. Because the Land of Sword Grief merely tested their Other Shore Power and Chaotic Source Spirits, no special tricks were allowed on the battleground.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi was stunned upon hearing Feng Ge's words. "Zheng, are you really ranked first on the second floor?" he asked Zheng.</p>

  <p>"It's absolutely true. If you don't believe it, you can go check the Ranking Stone yourself," Feng Ge continued.</p>

  <p>She wasn't surprised that he was still in disbelief, not having seen the rankings with his own eyes.</p>

  <p>But Feng Ge's look was so serious that no one present believed she could be lying.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi nodded and said, "I do believe it. But it's just too incredible."</p>

  <p>Gracefully, he shifted the subject. "Zheng, you've been in the Land of Sword Grief for some time. Have you deciphered more of the Truth Enlightenment?"</p>

  <p>At the mention of the Truth Enlightenment, all the high-ranking officials had their ears perk up.</p>

  <p>The Truth Enlightenment that Zheng had handed over was first passed down among the hands of these people. While there were only two hundred words, they had benefited a great deal, drastically increasing their strength.</p>

  <p>If they could cultivate the complete Truth Enlightenment, they'd definitely undergo qualitative changes.</p>

  <p>'As expected...'</p>

  <p>Zheng murmured inwardly.</p>

  <p>That confirmed that Eastern Emperor Taiyi was indeed targeting the Truth Enlightenment.</p>

  <p>Since he had planned to expose the Truth Enlightenment to the public, it wasn't really difficult for him to tell them about it.</p>

  <p>But Zheng still felt that something was wrong? if Eastern Emperor Taiyi only wanted the Truth Enlightenment, there was no need for him to summon so many of them.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Zheng said, ignoring his lingering confusion. "I've deciphered the Truth Enlightenment to five hundred words. Shall I hand it to you later or write it down here?"</p>

  <p>The high-ranking officials there could obtain the Truth Enlightenment no matter how Zheng offered it. The difference lay in whether it was handed over to them by Zheng or by Eastern Emperor Taiyi himself.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi invitingly gestured at Zheng and said, "These old officials are all old friends of mine. There's no need to hide anything from them, Zheng. You can write it down here and they can observe as they like."</p>

  <p>"Okay."</p>

  <p>Nodding in agreement, Zheng gently pressed the space ring on his finger. A single sheet of paper appeared in the air, along with a brush, which he promptly grabbed.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>"For warriors and soldiers, they build their bodies with clarity of mind and comprehension of the heart?"</p>

  <p>Zheng's words vigorously appeared on the sheet of paper.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the high-ranking officials stared hard at the sheet, afraid of missing a single detail.</p>

  <p>But after a while of staring, they all felt dizziness come over them. A middle-aged man of lower strength even fainted.</p>

  <p>That had Zheng pause for a moment. "Masters, comprehending this Truth Enlightenment cannot be accomplished overnight. If you cultivate it forcefully, I'm afraid it will hurt your souls."</p>

  <p>Cultivating the Truth Enlightenment was much more difficult than cultivating the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent. Even for both Zheng and Eastern Emperor Taiyi, it was difficult to speed up their cultivation. In fact, it was also difficult for them to read it.</p>

  <p>The high-ranking officials were all well aware of this, even more so than Zheng, but they didn't want to waste a single moment of this opportunity. As they tried to comprehend it rapidly, their Souls of Light naturally took some damage.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, all the high-ranking officials were powerful people. After a few seconds, the man who had just fainted woke right back up. He got up from the ground on his own, bowed before Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and retreated to the side.</p>
