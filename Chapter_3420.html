<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Ever since the disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace had entered the Chaotic Source World, several large races like the Bearing race, Divine Farmer race, and the Jin Wu had been constantly hostile towards them.</p>

  <p>These races had offended Luo Zheng many times, but now they just wanted to end the matter so easily.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" Mount stared at him and calmly asked. "Leave the lives of these three to us.</p>

  <p>Or, take out an equivalent amount of Chaotic Source Spirits," Luo Zheng answered.</p>

  <p>After the huge Chaotic Source Spirit had been killed, they gained a total of more than two thousand Chaotic Source Spirits--which was enough for ten people to receive Chaotic Source Reinforcement.</p>

  <p>What Luo Zheng had meant was to ask the Divine Farmer race to take out another more than two thousand Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>The three warriors were baffled upon hearing Luo Zheng's request. Paying an extra amount of more than two thousand Chaotic Source Spirits was even more painful than killing them!</p>

  <p>"This is way too much!"</p>

  <p>"You want us to pay so many Chaotic Source Spirits as a compensation?</p>

  <p>Isn't this robbery?"</p>

  <p>"No way!" the three warriors said indignantly.</p>

  <p>Even Mount, who was calm before, now scowled at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The warriors of the Divine Farmer race had previously worked together to kill a Chaotic Source Spirit, and it was true that they obtained more than two thousand crystals from it. All of the crystals were in Mount's hands. He indeed had the ability to pay the compensation Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>The Divine Farmer race, however, also had many members. If he gave their Chaotic Source Spirits to Luo Zheng, then there would be ten people in their race who would lose the chance to receive Chaotic Source Reinforcement. It was a big loss for them.</p>

  <p>Still, Luo Zheng's expression did not change at all.</p>

  <p>Everyone was currently seizing the chance to kill the Chaotic Source Spirits, and no one would want to waste time.</p>

  <p>Then again, what had been said was like water that had been spilled. If the Divine Farmer race didn't want to pay, then Luo Zheng would show no mercy.</p>

  <p>Although Yan didn't say anything, she stood beside Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Her brother's enemy would also be her enemy, and she represented the Snake Goddess race.</p>

  <p>If Mount fought here, then the Li Shan mountain would also be automatically involved.</p>

  <p>Mount was not an indecisive person. Within about ten seconds, he had already weighed the pros and cons and knew what to do.</p>

  <p>Since it wasn't the right time to think about the matter too much, he made a decision on the spot. With a flip of his hand, the light of his space ring flashed, and the Chaotic Source Spirits in the space ring spilled out and piled up on the ground.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't have time to check the number carefully, but he found that the size of the pile was about the same as the pile of crystals the three warriors had returned.</p>

  <p>"Let's go," said Mount.</p>

  <p>The three warriors were devastated when they saw the pile of Chaotic Source Spirits on the ground, but they could do nothing about it. They could only send death glares across Luo Zheng before they finally left.</p>

  <p>"This man is a decisive person?" Chaim said in a low voice as he watched Mount's receding figure.</p>

  <p>Although Chaim was a disciple of the Taiyi Heaven Palace, he clearly knew that they were at a disadvantage when faced against the members of the Bearing race, the Divine Farmer race, and the Jin Wu. He had a hunch that if Mount didn't pay the compensation, he would be in great trouble.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stepped forward and gently stretched out his hand. An invisible force stuck to all the Chaotic Source Spirits. With a light flick of his finger, all the crystals went into his space ring.</p>

  <p>"I will distribute these Chaotic Source Spirits later," he said.</p>

  <p>He had intended to let Sally, Hutton and the other Nine Li members enter the arrays first. After all, they were the only outstanding descendants of the Nine Li race left. However, when he thought of the other disciples from the Taiyi Heaven Palace who might have complaints, he decided to distribute the Chaotic Source Spirits later.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, they heard an ear-piercing scream that came from not far away.</p>

  <p>Apparently, a Chaotic Source Spirit jumped up and caged two members of the Celestial Wolf race under its feet. Eventually, it pushed itself down and crushed the two warriors into a meaty paste.</p>

  <p>In the past, the Chaotic Source World had always been friendly to some small races.</p>

  <p>Even if they only wandered around the periphery of the Chaotic Source World, they could dig up a few Chaotic Source Spirits and receive the Chaotic Source Reinforcement.</p>

  <p>But this time, all the Chaotic Source Spirits gathered at the main peak, and the cruel side of the game was revealed to everyone.</p>

  <p>A Chaotic Source Spirit of that size was prey to a super force like the Taiyi Heaven Palace. Small races, however, weren't strong enough to kill it.</p>

  <p>If they were not careful enough, they would quickly die.</p>

  <p>"Let's go and kill it!" Feng Ge exclaimed. She took the initiative and immediately flew over to the Chaotic Source Spirit.</p>

  <p>The disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace were thrilled when they saw the Chaotic Source Spirit. The way they saw it, it was like about three thousand Chaotic Source Spirits were waving at them.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's and Yan's figures flashed swiftly across the field as they too, charged towards the Chaotic Source Spirit.</p>

  <p>Chaotic Source Spirits were tough and had powerful strength, but their speed was their biggest setback--and so, they couldn't resist attacks that came from various kinds of abilities.</p>

  <p>If only they were inside the main peak, with the huge eye's help, then no one could probably defeat them. But now that the joint forces of all the warriors had destroyed the main peak and sealed off the giant eye, the Chaotic Source Spirits were far less frightening than they were before.</p>

  <p>The Chaotic Source Spirit roared and struggled continuously, but it couldn't hurt any Taiyi Heaven Palace disciple. It was like a powerful beast that was trapped and cornered to an invisible space by everyone, and the power of many crystals in its body was weakened little by little.</p>

  <p>In a span of a minute, the Chaotic Source Spirit let out an ear-splitting roar, then its four limbs flailed in the air before it fell to the ground with a loud thud. Feng Ge and Dorothy went forward first. They released two rays of sword radiance that sliced the Chaotic Source Spirit's abdomen, then all the crystals in its body flowed out.</p>

  <p>Many of the large races had ganged up on those Chaotic Source Spirits that were about thirty feet tall. Therefore, each race had harvested and accumulated a great amount of crystals.</p>

  <p>Despite that, the amount of the Chaotic Source Spirits was still limited after all. Once they couldn't find another one to kill, they all turned to look at the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>The mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits was over ten thousand feet tall.</p>

  <p>She was just like a mountain!</p>

  <p>It was not hard to imagine the number of crystals that were hidden inside her body.</p>

  <p>It wasn't long before hundreds of warriors from the Separate Abyss race, Jin Wu, Divine Farmer race, Snake Goddess race, and so on were all fighting with this mother.</p>

  <p>The Jin Wu turned into golden flames and circled around the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits. From time to time, golden sparks flashed on the mother's body.</p>

  <p>Yet even though so many warriors surrounded and attacked the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits, she didn't show any signs of fatigue. In fact, she was still ferocious as ever!</p>

  <p>After all, she had rested for many years and thus, her strength had grown into a terrifying level.</p>

  <p>"All of you! Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>Her eyes were full of hatred. How she wished she could swallow all these damn creatures!</p>

  <p>Although these creatures were weak and very small in size, they were cunning as mosquitoes as they flew around. The mother chased after them relentlessly, but the warriors flexibly dodged all of her attacks.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng had led the Taiyi Heaven Palace disciples to kill two Chaotic Source Spirits in a row, he shifted his attention to the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>Of course, they were determined to get a share of the crystals inside the body of the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>Just then, the dark smog in the sky loomed over them once more. "The hurricane is coming again?" Luo Zheng muttered, and his gaze froze.</p>

  <p>Everyone else were also filled with dread when they saw the surging black smog.</p>

  <p>No one knew where they would be blown to when the hurricane came.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits was not afraid of the hurricane.</p>

  <p>As for the warriors, they would definitely die if they hid underground.</p>

  <p>Someone still kept a level head and shouted, "Hide in the arrays!"</p>

  <p>Like a trail of disturbed ants, everyone scattered and scurried towards the arrays.</p>
