<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The method the Snake Goddess had discovered to exceedingly increase one's physical strength was called the Chaotic Source Reinforcement.</p>

  <p>When the body refining in the Wild God System no longer worked to enable warriors to cross the Sea of Truth and reach the Other Shore, it slowly declined in the Source World.</p>

  <p>However, some barbarian races still preferred that technique. But it could only give them limited power, which in most cases, was incomparable to the Other Shore Power.</p>

  <p>Both the Snake Goddess, and the other super forces in the Source World faced difficulties in tackling this issue. They had spent a long time trying and finding a way to strengthen their bodies.</p>

  <p>At that time, the Snake Goddess had successfully reached Stage Twenty-Two. Over there, she came across an unusual Other Shore Token, and it was called the Chaotic Source Spirit.</p>

  <p>It was an auxiliary type of Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>Its mechanisms were simple: when one activated it, it would become one with the cultivator's body and merge with it. By doing so, it would assist them and increase their physical strength by a fair amount.</p>

  <p>The Chaotic Source Spirit was no extraordinary Other Shore Token. In fact, it was quite common to be found on Stage Twenty-two. The Other Shore Power contained in it was about average, and it didn't give the warriors who used it much of a power boost. Therefore, it wasn't an invaluable find.</p>

  <p>However, the Snake Goddess had stumbled upon a distinctive property of the Chaotic Source Spirit and tapped into its hidden power.</p>

  <p>It turned out that the Chaotic Source Spirit was actually a living being!</p>

  <p>Coming across living creatures on the Other Shore was rather rare.</p>

  <p>However, it was nothing impressive for someone like the Snake Goddess, who had already reached a high level of cultivation.</p>

  <p>Even so, the Chaotic Source Spirit had some distinctive properties to its name that set it apart from other living beings. Although it was an auxiliary type of Other Shore Token, it also shared the qualities with descending type of Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>Having learned such a thing, the Snake Goddess planned on testing her new theory out.</p>

  <p>Without wasting a second, she asked Fuxi to catch one Chaotic Source Spirit on the Other Shore and then summon it at the same time when she did.</p>

  <p>Once they were activated, the two Chaotic Source Spirits familiarized themselves with each other and began communicating in their own language. It was discovered that they were interdependent creatures and were capable of reproducing, which explained how descending type of Other Shore Tokens remained in the Source World for that long.</p>

  <p>Once they began to reproduce, the Snake Goddess observed an inconceivable phenomenon.</p>

  <p>The new Chaotic Source Spirits made from their breeding did not return to the Other Shore but remained in the Source World.</p>

  <p>What was more interesting was the fact that they were born owner-less!</p>

  <p>Both the Snake Goddess and Fuxi stood dumbfounded at this sight. They couldn't figure out the mystery behind the Chaotic Source Spirits. Just what were they? Were they beings of the Source World? Or were they Other Shore Tokens from the Other Shore? They could have been both or neither of the two...</p>

  <p>One Chaotic Source Spirit held the capability of strengthening the physical prowess of the warrior who activated it, but what if they used more than one at once?</p>

  <p>Once she thought of this method, the Snake Goddess felt excitement fill her existence.</p>

  <p>Quickly, they used their acquired Chaotic Source Spirits and caused them to reproduce until they multiplied to a significant degree.</p>

  <p>When their population reached just over a hundred, the Snake Goddess made Fuxi absorb all of them to test out her theory.</p>

  <p>One after the other, each of them merged with Fuxi's body and made his physical prowess rise steadily. They kept being absorbed into his body until his physical power reached a notably high level. Thus, Fuxi was the first one to undergo the Chaotic Source Reinforcement.</p>

  <p>The news that the Li Shan mountain was nurturing the Chaotic Source Spirits quickly spread like wildfire.</p>

  <p>As a result, their value increased, and they became notably popular on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Every super force out there began their frantic search for Chaotic Source Spirits. As a result, the Chaotic Source Spirits that once lay in high numbers on Stage Twenty-Two were almost depleted.</p>

  <p>Following in the footsteps of the Snake Goddess, the masters of the super forces bred these Chaotic Source Spirits and multiplied their quantity to their desired number. They began viewing these unusual creatures as a gateway to attaining overwhelming power for themselves.</p>

  <p>The emergence of the Chaotic Source Spirits meant that those strengthening type of Other Shore Tokens and the mysterious type of Other Shore Tokens, which had various incredible abilities, would become more practical. At least after the warriors had enough Chaotic Source Spirits, they could exceed their limits and further build up their physical strength.</p>

  <p>However, this fortunate find didn't stay relevant for long. Soon they were stuck on this path.</p>

  <p>When the Snake Goddess bred the Chaotic Source Spirits, everything went on smoothly. She nurtured about several thousand of the Chaotic Source Spirits within a year. However, when the super forces began to do the same, they found that the reproduction ability of the Chaotic Source Spirits was limited and had considerably declined.</p>

  <p>Some super forces had worked hard for several years, but only managed to obtain a few hundred Chaotic Source Spirits. And in more unfortunate events, they got nothing, as the Chaotic Source Spirits refused to breed.</p>

  <p>Confused and frustrated, the super forces scavenged the temples for an explanation and a conclusion to the issue.</p>

  <p>It soon came to light that the Chaotic Source Spirits had a limitation of a certain number to exist at one time, which was two hundred thousand.</p>

  <p>Once they capped two hundred thousand, they would discontinue reproducing themselves.</p>

  <p>The only condition for a new one to be born was if an existing one was refined.</p>

  <p>Since the Snake Goddess was the first one to discover this property, she had already gathered a hundred thousand of them before the super forces could follow after her. This left close to nothing for the rest of the aspirants. In the best cases, they managed to nurture over ten thousand Chaotic Source Spirits. But for some others, they only got a few hundred, how unfortunate!</p>

  <p>Moreover, after the Chaotic Source Spirits those super forces caught gave birth to new ones, there was a high probability that they would be born in the Li Shan mountain. After all, Li Shan mountain had the largest population of them.</p>

  <p>As this continued, the number of Chaotic Source Spirits of the Li Shan mountain had reached as many as one hundred and fifty thousand, while the other forces had less.</p>

  <p>This unfair distribution of these Chaotic Source Spirits made many super forces jealous. Soon after, they gathered in one place and stood united to force Li Shan mountain to hand over the Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>Coming under pressure from the confrontation, the Snake Goddess gave in and reached a compromise with them. Together, with the super forces, she created the Chaotic Source World and stored all their Chaotic Source Spirits in there.</p>

  <p>As per the estimation, every ten years, the number of Chaotic Source Spirits would reach its limit of two hundred thousand from reproducing. Only then would the members of different races come to absorb them. And the amount of Chaotic Source Spirits one would be able to absorb to complete the Chaotic Source Reinforcement all depended on luck.</p>

  <p>However, the Chaotic Source World was not accessible to everyone. They required tickets to enter, which were always scarce in the Source World.</p>

  <p>One ticket almost meant an opportunity to become a warrior at the Chaotic Source Realm. There were so many talents in the seven mountains of the Taiyi Heaven Palace, and all of them had their lustful eyes on the tickets.</p>

  <p>Now that Flamine offered to give Luo Zheng many of these in one go, it seemed like the unthinkable!</p>

  <p>Feeling frustrated, Ying poked her cane into the ground as she hissed at Flamine with enraged eyes. "What's the use of having many tickets?"</p>

  <p>Flamine didn't bother to argue with her. She barely gave her a second glance. Instead, she smiled sweetly at Luo Zheng and gestured with kind words.</p>

  <p>"Since the Heart Flow Sect is very close to our Phoenix Palace and I've given you the token of our palace, you must come to visit us someday."</p>

  <p>With that, she turned around without looking at anyone else and made her way out.</p>

  <p>Watching her receding figure Yinge spat in her direction dejectedly then walked away towards the gate of the Mighty Sword Hall.</p>

  <p>Dorothy switched her gaze between her grandmother and Luo Zheng to read their expressions. After a long pause, she spoke to break the silence, "Luo Zheng, why did you go to the Phoenix Palace?"</p>

  <p>Flamine's attitude differed from that of usual. It made Dorothy suspicious of whether something had happened between Luo Zheng and Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>"I offended Feng Ge at the Seven Mountains Meeting last time," Luo Zheng said in an indifferent tone.</p>

  <p>Dorothy crossed her arms and nodded as she recalled the events. "Oh, I remember that I reminded you to be cautious of Feng Ge's revenge because she was very angry at that time."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shrugged his shoulders and said, "She did take her revenge. She kidnapped my families to Phoenix Palace. I had no choice but to go there and have a battle with her."</p>

  <p>Qiu Yinhe, Goran, Winchell, and Master Hai were treading along slowly behind Ying. They were all famous strong warriors, but they were also interested to know a lot of things. Overhearing what Luo Zheng had to say, they couldn't help but wonder to themselves.</p>

  <p>How did Luo Zheng manage to gain such favor from Flamine after just a fight with Feng Ge? It seemed too good to be true.</p>

  <p>"If you really battled with Feng Ge, why was Flamine so nice to you just now?" Dorothy asked innocently while blinking her big beautiful eyes that were filled with curiosity.</p>
