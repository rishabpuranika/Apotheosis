<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1184 Soul Purifying Light </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Now that everyone's soul had been made bare, their strength was heavily reduced, with Luo Luo Zheng being the obvious exception to this problem.</p>

  <p>The reason behind this was that his soul was already several times stronger than his peers'. Although it hadn't stepped into the Jasper Fighting Soul Realm yet, once a soul had merged with the world's will, even a Soul Sea Realm master's soul couldn't compete with it.</p>

  <p>The lamp hanging in front of the cemetery was what the cultivators called a cemetery-guarding lamp.</p>

  <p>It was supposed to injure all of the ghosts, but at the moment, it might be dangerous to them too, since they were in a soul state, which wasn't exactly human. This was exactly why the Soul Sea Realm master had stopped Fiona and the other young warriors. He was afraid that they would be eliminated by the cemetery-guarding lamp too.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stood still without the slightest signs of movement. He was trying to communicate with the cyan dragon in his mind. The Ancestral Dragon's egg had been in the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land for generations after generations. These kings and warriors had tried all they could to fetch it for so many years, but all their efforts had been in vain. If Luo Luo Zheng wanted to get his hands on it, he definitely needed help from the cyan dragon.</p>

  <p>The Dragon Lineage Human and the cyan dragon belonged to the Genuine Dragon. Since they shared a common ancestor, Luo Luo Zheng was sure the cyan dragon could help.</p>

  <p>He soon received a response from the cyan dragon. It seemed like there wouldn't be much of a problem. This put Luo Zheng's mind at ease.</p>

  <p>"You guys wait a moment. Once this lamp is extinguished, you can go in.</p>

  <p>Not before that," the Soul Sea Realm master told Luo Luo Zheng and his companions. There was a hint of warning in his voice.</p>

  <p>Very soon, Luo Luo Zheng saw a black shadow rushing into the cemetery at an incredible speed.</p>

  <p>At the very instant the black shadow touched the periphery of the cemetery, the lamp suddenly exploded into a dazzling light and viciously shot towards the shadow.</p>

  <p>'This light is also a type of soul attack!' Luo Luo Zheng remarked inwardly as his eyebrows suddenly twitched. There were quite a few miraculous things that the Dragon Lineage Humans had conjured up.</p>

  <p>However, that black shadow was the soul of a Soul Sea Realm master.</p>

  <p>When the light from the lamp shot towards the soul, a part of the soul suddenly changed shape and turned into a shield. He had a way to defend himself!</p>

  <p>'The man actually turned his soul into a shield. Interesting!' A smile appeared on Luo Zheng's face when he saw this scene.</p>

  <p>The warrior who was trying to enter the cemetery was at the Soul Sea Realm, but his soul was only at the Fighting Soul Realm. Therefore, he couldn't just withstand the lamp's attacks directly. It was necessary for him to block it.</p>

  <p>However, considering the current level of Luo Zheng's soul, he should be able to directly walk through without suffering too much damage from the lamp.</p>

  <p>Soon after they witnessed the soul of the Soul Sea Realm master enter the cemetery, the lamp suddenly flickered and then slowly dimmed down.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the Soul Sea Realm masters entered the cemetery one after another as the time was ripe. Luo Luo Zheng and the other young warriors followed after.</p>

  <p>What greeted their eyes was astounding. The massive cemetery they were in seemed to occupy the entire Divine Emperor Island. Exquisite tombstones stood erect on both sides of the road, and the ground was covered in thick dust.</p>

  <p>It was unknown just how many years it had been since an actual human had set foot in here. Even the people of the four divine kingdoms had only used their soul forms to enter this place.</p>

  <p>"Fiona. I reckon that over a million corpses of the Dragon Lineage Humans are stored here. After all these years, they would have already turned into bones and dust, right?" Luo Luo Zheng used his life vitality to communicate with Fiona. However, she had qualms of her own.</p>

  <p>What Fiona was thinking of was totally beyond Luo Zheng's imagination. She was completely oblivious to everyone else's thoughts and was a little worried about something else. "Isn't it considered disrespectful to take over others' corpses?"</p>

  <p>Among the younger warriors, only Randy was able to answer Luo Zheng's question. He told Luo Luo Zheng, "As far as I know, the corpses that we are going to take over are not close by. They lie in the depths of this cemetery. The corpses that are buried under these tombstones are all ordinary people, and their corpses never underwent any special treatment. I don't think that there are any remains left underneath the ground we walk on. After so many years, even their bones would have been turned into ashes."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded his head. What Randy had said made sense. Without the special method that prevented decay, a corpse wouldn't be able to withstand thousands or tens of thousands of years of time.</p>

  <p>The Soul Sea Realm masters were leading the way in their soul forms, and the juniors were following them.</p>

  <p>Although it was dark and gloomy wherever they looked, they had not encountered anything dangerous till now.</p>

  <p>After they covered some distance, a series of stairs appeared in front of them. On both sides of the stairs were numerous platforms which were arranged like terraces, like the stairs were made for some special appearance.</p>

  <p>There were huts on these platforms, only about the height of an average person, and even the huts were filled with coffins.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng raised his head and counted the number of the platforms. These terraced platforms were layered across thirteen floors. The number of platforms on the first floor itself was the highest. There were about a thousand of them, and each platform supported three huts. On the second floor, there were two huts on each platform. As he looked up, Luo Luo Zheng saw that the number of platforms and coffins became fewer and fewer with floor.</p>

  <p>Many souls arrived at the bottom of the stairs and looked at the platforms.</p>

  <p>At that moment, a Soul Sea Realm master told the young warriors, "The corpses on these platforms are arranged according to their level of strength and social status when they were alive. Of course even social status was determined by their strength. The higher the floor, the stronger the corpse. We have brought you here this time just to train you. It's okay if you fail to take over powerful corpses. You just need to be careful of the 'Soul Purifying Light' that appears on the stairs. The light can instantly eliminate your souls and you will enter a soulless, limbo state and die. With the current strength of your souls, there's no room for resistance! You must be careful. We'll climb up in a while. If the Soul Purifying Light begins to shine, you guys should enter the platforms on both sides and then you'll be safe. Do you understand?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng and Fiona didn't quite understand what was going on, but they still nodded their heads.</p>

  <p>Of course, these powerful warriors at the Soul Sea Realm didn't expect this group of juniors to be able to do anything. But since they had obtained so many Soul Cores, the emperors of the four divine kingdoms suddenly felt like they were extremely rich, which was why they had brought these young warriors in here. They wanted them to learn through experience.</p>

  <p>However, every trial was marked by accidents. That was why there was a special warrior accompanying them whose job was to remind them to pay attention to these things within the Divine Emperor Secret Land.</p>

  <p>As soon as the Soul Sea Realm master finished speaking, a ray of light came down from the top of the stairs.</p>

  <p>The light lit up the floors one by one until it reached the bottom floor.</p>

  <p>Under its bright radiance that ranged from the very top to the very bottom of the stairs, the tens of thousands of steps started to shine brightly as if there was a staircase of light in front of them.</p>

  <p>The Soul Sea Realm masters were unfazed by this sight. This was not the first time they had entered the cemetery. When Callan, Fiona, Randy and the others saw the light coming down the stairs, they were filled with imminent fear.</p>

  <p>The light lasted for about half a minute, and then it dimmed down. Just as the light dimmed, War King Wind, who was standing right in front, ordered quickly, "Everyone, let's move!"</p>

  <p>All the souls quietly shot up the stairs when they heard the order, moving in an orderly, yet quick fashion.</p>

  <p>Randy, Fiona and the others followed closely behind Luo Luo Zheng, who had shot up hastily.</p>

  <p>Everyone's soul rapidly climbed the stairs, but not even the slightest trace of sound was heard from the company. The soul itself would be unable to make any sound, and could only communicate through one's life vitality. Even if there was any sound, no one else would be able to hear it.</p>

  <p>For about thirty seconds, they climbed in complete silence. After that, a beam of light suddenly emerged from the top of the stairs and began to spread downwards at an extremely fast pace.</p>

  <p>"Hold on! Get on the platforms!" War King Wind ordered, and in an instant, everyone charged towards the platforms on either side. No one was caught in the hasty movement and they all climbed up safely.</p>

  <p>War King Wind stood on a platform towards the left side of the stairs, and his gaze was locked onto Fiona and Callan. Among all his children, he was most concerned about them. Naturally, he feared that they wouldn't be able to get on the platforms in time and be killed by the Soul Purifying Light.</p>

  <p>By the time the wave of Soul Purifying Light had spread out all the way down, everyone had already jumped onto the platforms on either side, and no one got into trouble.</p>

  <p>They had only managed to climb up to the second floor, and the platforms came one after the other. Luo Luo Zheng took a look at a coffin that lay in one of the two huts on the platform that he was standing on.</p>

  <p>'Is the corpse in this coffin intact?' He wondered and decided to use his perception to explore the insides of the coffin. Unfortunately, his perception was blocked by the coffin the moment it was released.</p>

  <p>The coffin seemed to be immune to his power, the same as the spirit shrine. It looked like the same material was used to construct both of those things, and it was able to completely isolate all perceptions from the outside world.</p>

  <p>Seeing that scene, Randy smiled and told him, "The corpses on the second floor are too weak. They are around the level of an Internal Elixir Realm warrior. They have no value at all. We need to choose the corpses on the upper floors."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled and nodded. He was well aware of the importance of using powerful corpses if they needed to enter the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land. A corpse that was too weak would be difficult to walk even a single inch in that place. Therefore, whether they would risk it or not, choosing powerful corpses was a necessity, if not a compulsion.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's gaze shifted towards the top. He had no idea just how strong the corpses on the top floor were. Were they corpses of mighty warriors at the Soul Sea Realm?</p>
