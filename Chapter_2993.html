<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>With blood flowing down along its edge, the quaint cyan sword started glowing once again. The sword released a sharp aura.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng saw this, his eyelids twitched as fear gripped his heart. He felt afraid that the cyan sword would cut him in half.</p>

  <p>'This is the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent contained in the cyan sword, ' Luo Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>In order to get the sword from inside the cave, Luo Zheng had risked his life fighting for it. He even got injured before he successfully got a hold of the sword.</p>

  <p>Since this sword was activated by this pale faced woman, the power of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent might have increased by a hundred times.</p>

  <p>Approaching it recklessly would probably have Luo Zheng cut into pieces by the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent alone.</p>

  <p>He wondered how powerful the owner of the cyan sword was.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>After it absorbed the woman's blood, a blood line was left on its blade. As the blood line gathered on its blade, dots of blood red light started to glow one by one gradually.</p>

  <p>Looking at the dots of blood on the glowing sword, Kenelm and the lord of the Excellence City were surprised, their eyes wide open.</p>

  <p>The standard sword in the Sword Light Palace was the Blood Kill Sword.</p>

  <p>Every Stinger Guard possessed this type of sword, and a dot of blood red light on it meant that its owner was a one-star Stinger Guard. It was also a secret known to most of the people in the Excellence City, even in the Gracious Province.</p>

  <p>"One, two, three, four, five!" As Kenelm counted the number of blood light dots on the sword, his mouth couldn't help twitching.</p>

  <p>Even the city lord's heart thumped wildly in his chest.</p>

  <p>If a five-star Stinger Guard's tomb was excavated, and their personal effects were handed over to the Sword Light Palace, the excavator could get five places in the Sword Light Palace.</p>

  <p>It was rare for anyone to get so many places at one time. Even the lord of the Excellence City could not ignore such a chance to earn a place.</p>

  <p>"It's actually a five-star Stinger Guard!" Kenelm felt completely flabbergasted. His face reflected an indescribable expression.</p>

  <p>Previously, he thought a one-star Stinger Guard would bring him satisfaction. At least, he could enter the Sword Light Palace. Never in his wildest dream did he expect what he had found was a five-star Stinger Guard's tomb.</p>

  <p>The lord of the Excellence City couldn't help but step forward before he bowed to the woman. "Master Laura, is this a five-star Stinger Guard's sword?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Staring at the cyan sword, the pale-faced woman shook her head and replied, "No. This is not a five-star Stinger Guard."</p>

  <p>Both Kenelm and the city lord who heard her were slightly stunned.</p>

  <p>With a gleam flashing in Luo Zheng's eyes, he suddenly thought of the ghost in the tomb.</p>

  <p>After getting along with No. 9527 for a long time, Luo Zheng realized that it gradually became lazy. It rarely came out to help him, unless he really encountered a life and death situation.</p>

  <p>That ghost continuously grew under the siege of the young master of the Qi Clan and his group, but Luo Zheng wasn't sure on the extent of its growth. So before it could grow any further, No. 9527 had destroyed the obsession of the Stinger Guard and made it possible for Luo Zheng to obtain the cyan sword.</p>

  <p>This feat was mostly attributed to No. 9527, not Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>If it wasn't for No. 9527, no one would know what the ghost would grow into in the end.</p>

  <p>The pale-faced woman couldn't hide her sad expression as she said, "It's the former leader of our Sword Light Palace, Caspian Qiu."</p>

  <p>The lord of the Excellence City trembled upon hearing her statement.</p>

  <p>Stammering, he said, "It's been so many years since Master Caspian disappeared. I didn't expect that he actually died in our Gracious Province."</p>

  <p>The Sword Light Palace was a powerful force that was very famous in the whole province. Its leader, Caspian Qiu, certainly enjoyed a high status.</p>

  <p>However, more than five hundred years ago, Caspian Qiu suddenly disappeared. Over the years, his position remained vacant and the vice leader served as the acting leader. The lord of the Excellence City never expected that the leader of the Sword Light Palace had died in the Gracious Province.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Kenelm remained astonished by the fact that he found the tomb of the leader of the Sword Light Palace. He felt like he was in cloud nine. At the same time, a spark of hope started to warm his heart as he wondered what reward awaited for him in the Sword Light Palace.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's heart also skipped a beat.</p>

  <p>In addition to the cyan sword, a few other effects were also left in Caspian Qiu's tomb. There was a cyan suit, a pair of boots, a hat, and the octagonal copper sheet.</p>

  <p>He hadn't asked Luo Nian to identify the copper sheet yet, but it seemed that he needed to hurry up to proceed the matter.</p>

  <p>Although the map in the copper sheet still remained to be a puzzle for him, he knew that there was something special about it. Otherwise, why would a leader of a powerful force keep it?</p>

  <p>Putting away the cyan sword, the pale-faced woman stared at Kenelm and said in a weak voice, "Our Sword Light Palace indeed have a rule that anyone who can get back the effects of a Stinger Guard? will be qualified to join our Sword Light Palace. Finding the effects of a five-star Stinger Guard could get you five tickets. You brought back the effects of the owner of this sword... We'll give you ten tickets."</p>

  <p>Although she spoke intermittently, every word sounded crystal clear to Kenelm.</p>

  <p>However, he felt a little disappointed. He only needed one ticket. Counting in Luo Zheng and his three friends, he would only need five. So where could he use the other five more tickets?</p>

  <p>"Moreover? Five hundred years ago? We offered anyone who could find the leader a reward. You can claim it," the woman continued.</p>

  <p>Shortly after the woman finished talking, Kenelm's heart thumped wildly. It felt like a heavy hammer hit it ceaselessly. Stammering, he asked, "Excuse me, what's the reward?"</p>

  <p>The woman looked at him and then calmly replied, "A wealth probably equivalent to fifty times the wealth of the Excellence City."</p>

  <p>Hearing her words, the guards of the Qi Clan all gasped in astonishment.</p>

  <p>Pausing in the air, they couldn't decide if they would stay or go. The lord of the Excellence City was also flabbergasted.</p>

  <p>The Excellence City was indeed a small city in the Gracious Province.</p>

  <p>However, being nearest to the Wild Goose Pass, and having the East Port, the flow of people and scale of trade were not small. Therefore, the overall wealth of all the people in the area was definitely not a small amount.</p>

  <p>Just the mere thought of fifty times the wealth of the Excellence City would make anyone feel dizzy. Kenelm was afraid that he would faint as he set his mind on it.</p>

  <p>Shifting her attention to Luo Zheng, the pale-faced woman stared at him with a strange expression. Through her sad eyes, she asked, "You seem to have? no... psychological fluctuation?"</p>

  <p>Of course, Luo Zheng did not have much psychological fluctuation and his expression remained very serene.</p>

  <p>The Sword Light Palace was, after all, a big force. The reward offered for finding the former leader was quite high and promising. However, the divine crystals that Luo Zheng received were the heritage of the entire Nine Li race. Although he only took half of it, it was still an astronomical amount.</p>

  <p>So hearing this now from the lady, Luo Zheng was not shocked at all.</p>

  <p>On another hand, Luo Zheng was busy analyzing the turn of events. Knowing that Kenelm was not powerful enough and his talent was far from enough to attract the attention of the Sword Light Palace, Luo Zheng assumed that getting such a great fortune might not be advantageous on his end. Instead, it would be a disaster.</p>

  <p>Rich as Luo Zheng was, only a few people like Emily and Leopold knew it. If Kenelm went to the Sword Light Palace to claim his reward, he would be killed in less than two hours after leaving the Sword Light Palace. What was more, it was very likely that the person who would do that was from the Sword Light Palace.</p>
