  <p>
</p>

  <p>Master Feng's wrinkled face snarled as he attacked with an uppercut move, which Luo Zheng barely dodged.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha Luo Zheng, come again!" he exclaimed with a toothy smile. He dashed forward again as his hand moved faster and faster, while the streams of mighty strength became increasingly denser.</p>

  <p>The powerful strength he displayed had a unique origin. It was known as the Divine Mighty Strength, and it was one of the Transcendent Divine Might of the Celestial Position. It exhibited a fearsome capacity even though he was just casually using it.</p>

  <p>Master Feng's beady eyes were serious. The streams of mighty strength were incomparably sharp under the claw of his hand. At that moment, a violent, wind-like ear-splitting sound erupted in the air.</p>

  <p>"Hiss, hiss, hiss..."</p>

  <p>The long, tendril-like streams of mighty strength slithered like numerous black snakes towards Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>"80% of his strength?" Meanwhile, Supreme Lord Sky froze at the sight of the snake-like formation of the mighty strength.</p>

  <p>"It's one hundred percent! Master Feng has already gone all out. If Luo Zheng really can take it, then that would be too outrageous…" On the other hand, Supreme Lord Mirage shook his head in disbelief. He thought that Master Feng had gone too far!</p>

  <p>Everyone clearly knew how strong Master Feng was: he was an existence who was on the same level as Supreme Lord of Original Sin, Supreme Lord of Oracle, and Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment.</p>

  <p>Hell, he might be even more powerful than them!</p>

  <p>However, what set the Supreme Lords apart were the Heavenly Destinies they carried.</p>

  <p>Master Feng currently skipped using his own Heavenly Destiny. Then again, he still possessed an immense strength even with only his own martial art skills. Even if it was an ordinary Supreme Lord who had fought him, they would've had to go all out.</p>

  <p>And Luo Zheng, who stood opposite of Master Feng, had just become a world lord not too long ago. Would he really be able to take it?</p>

  <p>The air tensed as the mighty strength pounced ferociously towards Luo Zheng like heavy but stealthy black snakes.</p>

  <p>In turn, Zheng's gaze flickered as the nine stars in his cinnabar field began to rotate slowly.</p>

  <p>In reality, Master Feng's strength was nothing to Luo Zheng. In terms of pure strength, he should be on par with Chapman in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land--even if he was a Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng still activated the power of the nine stars just to be safe.</p>

  <p>When the cluster of small snakes formed from the mighty strength neared Luo Zheng, he still stretched out his right hand, his right index finger protruded forward and his thumb raised slightly.</p>

  <p>Just when the small snake at the helm charged towards Luo Zheng, he shook his hand slightly and precisely caught the small snake's head in his hand.</p>

  <p>Then, he gave it a light pinch.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The small, formerly swift snake was now broken into pieces!</p>

  <p>Right after the snake was gone, Zheng's hand transformed into a series of shadows which constantly moved in front of him. Although there were numerous densely-packed snakes, only Zheng's touch was needed for them to die in an instant.</p>

  <p>"Crack! Crack! Crack…"</p>

  <p>Cracking sounds continuously filled the air like an endless line of dominoes.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords who saw Zheng's technique thought this was ingenious. It was perfect in all aspects, whether it was speed, strength, or even the angle.</p>

  <p>However, Ning Yudie and Freya barely saw the movements. To them, it was all too fast.</p>

  <p>The only thing they got to see was a black gale that appeared to float in front of Luo Zheng, while his hand reached into the mass of wind and kept swinging. He continued the motion as if he wanted to disperse the strong torrent of wind with his own limbs.</p>

  <p>As Zheng's palm moved faster and faster, the color of the wind gradually became fainter. It slowly turned from an inky black to a darker grey, then it completely disappeared in front of the two women's eyes.</p>

  <p>What they didn't see was that during that entire process, Zheng's right hand had crushed thousands of small black snakes!</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng had extinguished the last of the small black snakes formed from the mighty strength, he took two steps back and cupped his hands towards Master Feng. His lips curved up into a small smile.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Master Feng looked extremely amazed. He released a deep sigh after a while and said, "The information I comprehended from my bloodline has told me that the master of the Evolutionary Universe wants me to train the ten Godly Geniuses, and send them to Divine Refinement Forbidden Land…</p>

  <p>It is known that only these ten Godly Geniuses are qualified to save this round of the universe." Master Feng breathed deeply and continued,</p>

  <p>"Although I won't go against the will of the master of the universe, I thought that the master's idea was a bit naive. It would take a while before the young Godly Geniuses to grow up. How can we fight the Sacred race?"</p>

  <p>The purpose of the Celestial Position was to protect the entire universe from the invaders of the Sacred race.</p>

  <p>It was one of the ways that Mike could protect himself. The real key to his plans lay in Luo Zheng and the other nine Godly Geniuses.</p>

  <p>Master Feng naturally understood this, but he also knew that it was simply unrealistic for him to pin all his hopes on the Godly Geniuses.</p>

  <p>Therefore, when the Sacred race began to attack the entire universe in the last few years, the Celestial Position had two different ideas.</p>

  <p>More than half of the martial artists wanted to actively prepare for battle; they didn't want to rely on those Godly Geniuses.</p>

  <p>Before the Godly Geniuses entered the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, they were only at the Spirit Supreme Realm. How could the people hope for them to return to the universe and save all living things in three short years?</p>

  <p>Despite the case, there was still a group of people who believed in Master Feng's scheme. After all, it was the plan of the master of the Evolutionary Universe--the Holy Being who had built the universe himself.</p>

  <p>Of course, his strategies weren't something that ordinary people could understand.</p>

  <p>Yet while Master Feng had clearly showed his support for the master of the Evolutionary Universe, he too was worried. Fortunately, Wynn stood by his side and helped him to carry out Mike's plan.</p>

  <p>Not many people sided with him, but all of those who supported him were top-level warriors in the Celestial Position. Therefore, the Celestial Position managed to stay put no matter how fast the Sacred race occupied the universe.</p>

  <p>Now, Master Feng finally understood that Mike's scheme was flawless.</p>

  <p>The others were simply narrow-minded. They never thought about how terrifyingly powerful a Holy Being was, or how immense his inheritance would be.</p>

  <p>Master Feng was well aware of these facts now.</p>

  <p>In fact, he already saw that Luo Zheng had undergone a tremendous change after he cultivated in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>Still, Luo Zheng hadn't fully displayed his true strength in the test just now!</p>

  <p>The said test for the Godly Geniuses had been arranged before they had returned.</p>

  <p>This was because the Celestial Position needed to understand the level of powers, souls, and life vitality of the Godly Geniuses after their return.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had showed his unfathomable strength in the first test. He passed Master Feng's assessment, or it could be said that Luo Zheng had beaten him.</p>

  <p>"The gaze of the master of the Evolutionary Universe has already fallen to a place that we can't see." Master Feng smiled. "Actually, my test was already over. Now it's Supreme Lord Mirage's turn to carry out the test, but I still want to give it a try!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was slightly stunned. He did not know what Master Feng wanted to do.</p>

  <p>Several Supreme Lords were surprised as well, but they didn't say anything.</p>

  <p>Just then, a golden light flashed from the spot between Master Feng's brows as a mysterious Law Power emerged from the top of his head.</p>

  <p>There were a hundred and twenty-eight Heavenly Destinies in the universe in total, and all of them usually contained exceedingly strange rules.</p>

  <p>These rules varied from weak to strong.</p>

  <p>For instance, Supreme Lord Lester from the Celestial Position wasn't considered very strong. His combat strength was only equal to that of an ordinary low-rank Supreme Lord. Some of the best grand world lords could even hold him to a draw!</p>

  <p>In terms of combat strength, he was on par with a weak Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>However, Supreme Lord Lester was ranked highly among the Supreme Lords. He was ranked just behind four other Supreme Lords: Master Feng, Supreme Lord of Original Sin, Supreme Lord of Oracle, and Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment.</p>

  <p>Such was the case because he carried an extremely powerful Heavenly Destiny!</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Lester could revive any martial artist who was seriously injured, even those who were already dead.</p>

  <p>This one Heavenly Destiny of Revival controlled the lives of all living beings. It was also because of Supreme Lord Lester that the Celestial Position had been able to obtain several satisfying Crowns of Destiny.</p>

  <p>For example, Master Feng became a top-rank Supreme Lord because Supreme Lord Lester had killed and revived him 13 times. After he had selected a Heavenly Destiny from all of the Heavenly Destinies, he had finally obtained the strongest one among all of them in the entire universe--the supreme Law of Causality!</p>

  <p>"Supreme Lord Sky, take the two girls away," Master Feng said. Then, the auras around him began to surge and the entire space was plunged into chaos. It was as if an extremely powerful technique was being brewed--thus, he had Supreme Lord Sky take the two girls behind Luo Zheng away, in fear that the auras might affect them.</p>

  <p>"Master Feng, are you planning to…" Supreme Lord Mirage's jaw dropped in shock.</p>

  <p>The fact that they couldn't test the limits of Zheng's power made them rather upset.</p>

  <p>However, it was still a good thing because the stronger Luo Zheng was, the more he would be able to help in their future plans.</p>

  <p>It was just that what Luo Zheng had performed could not merely be described strong, but unfathomable. He possessed a power that even Supreme Lords could not describe; it was indeed a bit outrageous.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, Master Feng didn't seem too convinced and was determined to find out the limits of Zheng's strength.</p>
