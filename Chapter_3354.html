<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3354 Chance's Mother </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>There was a gentle tapping sound as Zheng put his fingers on three pieces on the chessboard once again.</p>

  <p>He instantly activated the 15th, 16th, and 17th Regal Jade Beast statues, which ran towards Chance.</p>

  <p>Every time one more Regal Jade Beast was summoned and appeared, its strength and body grew significantly.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, the power of the three Regal Jade Beasts was comparable to that of the ordinary Chaotic Source Realm warrior, but they were slightly weaker when it came to physical strength.</p>

  <p>Although Chance was a powerful warrior of the Chaotic Source Realm, it was difficult for him to fight against them. After all, he was outnumbered.</p>

  <p>He bit his teeth and extracted the blood of his body. The blood red sword which seemed to contain endless amounts of power turned into a big bell, and then moved towards the Regal Jade Beasts to attack them.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>Chance had easily killed the 15th Regal Jade Beast.</p>

  <p>The 16th Regal Jade Beast, however, actually managed to withstand the Bell of Eastern Emperor's attack, but countless cracks burst on the surface of its body. The beast didn't break into pieces until Chance attacked it for the second time.</p>

  <p>The 17th Regal Jade Beast was an exception. When the 17th Regal Jade Beast was hit by the Bell of Eastern Emperor, only one crack appeared on its body. It seemed that its physical body was terribly strong!</p>

  <p>The guards who watched the battle from the distance all gasped at the scene.</p>

  <p>"How terrifying this jade statue is!"</p>

  <p>"Even though Chance has made use of the Other Shore Token and the bloodline theurgy, he still can't destroy it..."</p>

  <p>"Can that man really make these jade statues become stronger and stronger?"</p>

  <p>Speculations filled the air as such a crazy method was unheard of and totally out of the others' imaginations.</p>

  <p>Even the disciples of the Phoenix Palace were amazed. Their faces darkened as they watched the shocking scene.</p>

  <p>For them, Chance had always been invincible, but now he couldn't even touch Zheng's sleeve and was completely tired of dealing with the statues.</p>

  <p>This result was completely beyond their expectation, and it made them upset.</p>

  <p>As for Chance, all the color was drained from his face and he became speechless.</p>

  <p>He was also confused.</p>

  <p>How could an Other Shore Realm warrior be so powerful to deal with?</p>

  <p>There was no doubt that he'd become everyone's laughing stock if Zheng defeated him today.</p>

  <p>Outraged, Chance madly squeezed his Other Shore Token and blood power.</p>

  <p>After he used the Bells of Eastern Emperor to attack the 17th Regal Jade Beast statue seven times, he finally smashed it into pieces.</p>

  <p>"He is such a powerful Chaotic Source Realm warrior," Zheng said flatly. The power Chance had released reached 2, 000 divine megatons.</p>

  <p>With the help of the shadows of the Bells of Eastern Emperor, the power had increased by more than tenfold.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Zheng also had something he was thankful for: if it wasn't for the Civilization Artifact, he would never defeat Chance.</p>

  <p>It was no wonder the Chaotic Source Realm was known as the Chaotic Source Reinforcement. After one had successfully reached the Chaotic Source Realm, their body would be reinforced and possess an unparalleled strength.</p>

  <p>And so, Zheng had the slightest hint of expectation for the Chaotic Source World in his heart.</p>

  <p>"But, the 18th and 19th Regal Jade Beasts should be able to defeat you..." he muttered.</p>

  <p>Then, he put his finger on the chessboard and pushed out two more pieces.</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade Spirit had told Zheng that this Regal Jade chessboard was just a small one and could only accommodate 81 chess pieces. Zheng was able to summon a limit of 81 Regal Jade creatures. Unfortunately, too many Regal Jade creatures would consume a great number of divine crystals.</p>

  <p>If the Regal Jade Civilization reached the Desire World and got rid of the Lust World's suppression, it would be able to give Zheng a bigger chessboard.</p>

  <p>There were 19 horizontal lines and 19 vertical lines on the chessboard, so there would be a total of 361 Regal Jade creatures that he could summon!</p>

  <p>"Clang, clang, clang..."</p>

  <p>Two Regal Jade Beasts of nearly ten feet tall ran quickly on the cyan stone path of the Phoenix Palace.</p>

  <p>It took Chance a lot of Other Shore Power to destroy the three Regal Jade Beasts earlier. He looked exhausted at this point.</p>

  <p>Now, Chance tried his best to hold on as he didn't want to disgrace Eastern Emperor Taiyi, especially since he was the emperor's direct descendant!</p>

  <p>However, he no longer hoped to defeat Zheng. He faced the Regal Jade Beasts that went straight for him, and then absorbed the divine crystals like mad to replenish the power of his Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>It was known that the Other Shore Power of the Other Shore Token could be replenished with the divine crystals, but the blood power could not.</p>

  <p>Thus, the only way for him to defeat the two Regal Jade Beasts was to extract his own blood power to the extreme.</p>

  <p>"Shatter..."</p>

  <p>Chance roared as he rushed headlong towards the two Regal Jade Beasts.</p>

  <p>Shadows of the Bells of Eastern Emperor descended along his blood red sword blade as he unleashed terrifying power.</p>

  <p>The path in the Phoenix Palace was an absolute wreck, but the two Regal Jade Beasts seemed to be made of fine iron. Only a mere crack surfaced on each of their bodies after the shadows of the Bells of Eastern Emperor had hit them. In other words, they weren't seriously affected.</p>

  <p>Just as Chance attacked once more, one of the Regal Jade Beasts suddenly bolted forward and grabbed at him.</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade Beast didn't have a special theurgy and only relied on its own strength and physical body.</p>

  <p>Chance had dodged several attacks from the Regal Jade Beasts before, but the beasts' strength had been greatly enhanced. He had failed to dodge when the beast grasped him!</p>

  <p>"Swish! Bang!"</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade Beast lifted Chance up in the air, and then smashed him onto the ground.</p>

  <p>The impact of the huge force caused the surrounding ground to tremble, and the walls on both sides of the palace were shattered. Liusu, Nelly, Xun, and the direct descendants also lost their balance and fell down.</p>

  <p>The physical body of the Chaotic Source Realm warrior was extremely solid. On the other hand, an ordinary Other Shore Realm warrior who was under a similar attack would have been smashed to pieces.</p>

  <p>However, Chance managed to withstand the attack.</p>

  <p>"You..."</p>

  <p>He still wanted to fight back, but when he was about to turn over, another Regal Jade Beast waved its thick palm and slapped him.</p>

  <p>"Boom! Boom! Boom..."</p>

  <p>Despite the continuous attacks of the two Regal Jade Beasts, Chance still managed to endure them because his body had undergone the Chaotic Source Reinforcement!</p>

  <p>"What a strong body..." Zheng scowled and smacked his lips.</p>

  <p>Even if he himself used the Shade Stone liquid to protect his body, he still couldn't resist the violent attacks from the two Regal Jade Beasts!</p>

  <p>At this moment, Chance began to groan inwardly.</p>

  <p>Chance's physical body, though fortified by the Chaotic Source Reinforcement, was now extremely fatigued. If he suffered a few more attacks, his physical body's strength would decline greatly and the Regal Jade Beasts would end up smashing him into a bloody pulp!</p>

  <p>But what could he do? Give up? Beg for mercy?</p>

  <p>As a direct descendant of the Phoenix Palace and the talent of the Land of Sword Grief, would he admit defeat to a disciple from the Oneness Sky Palace?</p>

  <p>Driven by his strong self-esteem, Chance wasn't willing to do that.</p>

  <p>While Chance was in despair, two ice crystals suddenly appeared beside him.</p>

  <p>As soon as the two ice crystals emerged, they pummeled into the bodies of the two Regal Jade Beasts.</p>

  <p>As a result, the emerald Regal Jade Beasts turned into two stiff, icy sculptures.</p>

  <p>After that, a woman in a white gauze dress quietly appeared beside Chance.</p>

  <p>The moment she showed up, the temperature in the entire Phoenix Palace dropped by several degrees.</p>

  <p>She stretched out her slender white fingers and gently stroked the two ice sculptures.</p>

  <p>"Crash!"</p>

  <p>The two ice sculptures shattered into pieces on the ground.</p>

  <p>Chance groaned in pain, and then slowly adjusted his body. "Mother..." he called out and looked at the woman.</p>

  <p>A few seconds later, another shout ripped through the cold air. "Mother!"</p>

  <p>Ahmad yelled and ran over from the distance.</p>

  <p>"Who are you from? How dare you act wildly and atrociously in our Phoenix Palace?" the woman hissed.</p>

  <p>She had quite an aloof face. She glared at Zheng who stood not far away, her voice filled with rage.</p>
