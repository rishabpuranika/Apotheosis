  <p>
</p>

  <p>Elder Jing's greatest worry was the ogres.</p>

  <p>As soon as Luo Luo Zheng entered the Tower of Sin, he had become the target of a grudge of the ogres. Even then, the ogres would have let him go had Luo Zheng's performance not been so outstanding.</p>

  <p>At least they wouldn't break the rules of the Tower of Sin just to kill Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Although the ogres had many seats at the moment, they were still only a quarter of the hundred or so. Breaking the rules of the tower would have to come at a great price for the ogres.</p>

  <p>But now, the situation was different.</p>

  <p>They already had the lesson of Amber before, who had helped the Demon Night rise up rather rapidly. With that in mind, the ogres could not just sit and watch as Luo Luo Zheng helped the humans rise up too.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Luo Zheng's name had already surpassed Amber's, and was already sitting neatly in the first row. Once a person like him matured, he would be able to wipe out the two sacred places of the ogres from the Sea God Continent.</p>

  <p>This was a big problem and any race was going to be severely worried in face of such imminent danger. Although the ogres were really strong, they were no exception to such fear, and when faced with this level of threat, they were not going to care about any rules. They wouldn't give a damn about the so-called "safe area" and would kill Luo Luo Zheng at any price, including turning themselves against all the other races.</p>

  <p>Not only were more ogre war lords entering the tenth floor, the number of Demon Night war lords was also increasing now.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a bold laughter came from somewhere close by. Following that sound, a sense of great pressure came over everyone present there. All the creatures in the room, who were originally staring at the names on the wall, turned their heads.</p>

  <p>Another level ten ogre war lord was walking towards them.</p>

  <p>Elder Jing, Olivia and the other humans felt a chill in their hearts.</p>

  <p>"Malcom! One of the seat owners!"</p>

  <p>There were two methods to determine the strength of a race on the Sea God Continent. The first was to check the strength of the warriors of their sacred places, and the second was the strength of their seat owners in the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>The ogres had the highest number of seats and their seat owners were usually level ten war lords.</p>

  <p>And this ogre in front of them called Malcom was a seat owner too.</p>

  <p>Malcom strode forwards arrogantly, surrounded by a group of war lords.</p>

  <p>The other races' creatures all gave way under his domineering Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>As for Boris and the other ogre war generals, when they saw Malcom, they went over to him and raised their fists, placing them on their own chests.</p>

  <p>This was a unique etiquette of the ogres they followed to greet their members.</p>

  <p>Malcom's bell-like eyes stared at the wall. When he saw Luo Zheng's name floating high in the first row, he let out a cold laugh. "Luo Luo Zheng Luo! His talent is so terrifying. Hmm! He must die. When he steps out of the Talent Tablet, I am going to take his life!"</p>

  <p>As soon as these words left his mouth, every single creature in the room immediately stopped murmuring and speaking. There was intense silence in the room. The seat owners were the creators of rules of the Tower of Sin, so it was impossible that Malcolm did not know that this was a safe area. This meant that the upper echelons of the ogres had reached an agreement to pay any price to kill Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Olivia's expression changed drastically as she bit her lips. Her face was filled with anxiety.</p>

  <p>Elder Jing's expression was even more unnatural. He pondered for a moment and suddenly asked, "Malcom, if you do this, I'm afraid it won't be in accordance with the rules, right?"</p>

  <p>Malcom glared at Elder Jing and sneered, "Who are you? What qualifications do you have to speak to me?"</p>

  <p>Although Elder Jing was one of the strongest human warriors in the Tower of Sin, he was not a seat owner. He was indeed not qualified.</p>

  <p>Elder Jing's expression changed. In the end, he chose to shut his mouth.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the surrounding creatures were all whispering to each other.</p>

  <p>"Alas, Luo Luo Zheng is dead meat."</p>

  <p>"It isn't easy for humans to find someone as talented as him, but he is going to be killed by the ogres. What a pity!"</p>

  <p>"There's no other way. If I were an ogre, I would do the same. Who would let such a threat grow?"</p>

  <p>Amidst these discussions, a light voice was suddenly heard.</p>

  <p>"Malcom, your words seem to be a little too domineering. Do you really not need to follow the rules of the Tower of Sin?"</p>

  <p>As the voice faded away, a gust of cold wind blew from a corner of the room. Out of nowhere, a white and blurry figure appeared not far away, with its shadow constantly flashing. All the creatures in the room had to wipe their eyes repeatedly before they could finally see that it was a human war lord clad completely in white. A level ten war lord!</p>

  <p>Today, the tenth floor of the Tower of Sin was a really lively sight.</p>

  <p>As soon as they saw that person, Elder Jing, Olivia, Dylon, and the other humans immediately went up to him and greeted him politely.</p>

  <p>Malcom merely glared at this suddenly-appeared person and sneered,</p>

  <p>"Fabian Zhao? What? You're out alone today? Where is Jarrod Zhou? Don't you two always appear at the same time?"</p>

  <p>The humans had four seats at the top of the Tower of Sin, and two of them were owned by Fabian Zhao and Jarrod Zhou.</p>

  <p>The two of them were highly adept at using their swords. With their swords combined, they could even contend against a level one war sage.</p>

  <p>"I'm here," a soft voice came from another direction. The speaker was dressed in all black, and if he hadn't uttered these words just now, no one would have noticed him.</p>

  <p>After the appearance of the two human seat owners, the confidence levels of Elder Jing, Olivia, and the other humans slightly increased.</p>

  <p>However, they knew that the situation was still very dire indeed.</p>

  <p>In the Tower of Sin, the humans couldn't fight against ogres at all. After all, the human race only had four seat owners, but the ogres had more than twenty. This was only a glimpse of just how strong the ogres were. How could the humans compete with them? The reason why the ogres had not sent too many of their seat owners down was that they felt that Malcom alone was enough to deal with the humans.</p>

  <p>Only a weak race would reveal all of its trump cards in a single breath.</p>

  <p>Ogres obviously did not need to do that.</p>

  <p>Fabian Zhao strode over, his gaze falling on Luo Zheng's name and his face revealing a look of satisfaction. He then turned towards the ogres and coldly remarked, "Malcom, you can't lay a finger on him. Ogres can't just trample on the rules set by so many races as they please. If you were to break rules just like that, then that would imply that the ogres are going to kill talents from the other races as well."</p>

  <p>The other races deeply agreed with Fabian's words.</p>

  <p>No one was willing to be subservient to the ogres. Many races had sent their talents into the Tower of Sin to cultivate because they hoped that these cultivators could grow and help improve the status of their races.</p>

  <p>If the ogres killed a human talent today, then it stood to reason that they would kill talents of the other races as well in the future.</p>

  <p>Fabian Zhao was smart enough to involve the other races in this debate.</p>

  <p>When the creatures of the other races heard this, they felt the same way.</p>

  <p>"That's right. What the ogres plan to do is against the rules!"</p>

  <p>"They can defeat Luo Luo Zheng in the arena, but killing him in the safe area is totally illegal. The Tower of Sin is everyone's, and it does not belong only to the ogres."</p>

  <p>"Ogres are used to being tyrannical. If they do kill Luo Luo Zheng, then the other races will need to analyze and think carefully about whether or not there's a need to start an interracial war and flatten the two sacred places of the ogres to the ground."</p>

  <p>The two sacred places the ogres had were the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>Most of the races were indeed not a match for the ogres inside the Tower of Sin. But if every single one of the fourteen big races on the continent were to join forces, then with the help of the Demon Night's Amber, trampling over the two sacred places of the ogres was going to be very much possible.</p>

  <p>This was also the reason why the ogres had given up more than half of their seats in the Tower of Sin earlier on.</p>

  <p>Malcom let out a cold snort, looked around at the creatures, and revealed a cold smile. "Rules? Ha-ha, rules have always been set by strong warriors.</p>

  <p>We, the ogres, plan to temporarily abolish the rules of the safe area. What do you say to that?"</p>

  <p>"That's a bit unreasonable, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>Just as Malcom had finished speaking, another tall figure appeared.</p>

  <p>From the very start of this conversation, Malcom hadn't had the slightest trace of fear in his heart. Even while facing Fabian Zhao and Jarrod Zhou combined, he wasn't afraid at all. The four human seat owners were but a small problem to the ogres.</p>

  <p>However, his face revealed a fearful expression at this new voice. He asked in a cold voice, "What? The Demon Night wants to intervene in this matter?"</p>

  <p>Whether it was the Tower of Sin or the Sea God Continent, only the Demon Night was able to fight evenly with the ogres. If the Demon Night were going to side with the other races, the situation was going to become extremely troublesome for the ogres.</p>

  <p>This was the reason why Malcom was so afraid.</p>
