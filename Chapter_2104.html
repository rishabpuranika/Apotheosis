<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Each Holy Being had their own style of raising the contractual beasts.</p>

  <p>For instance, Holy Jay had thrown the Black Weasel into his inner world and made it sleep. Then, he used the Cross-world Theurgy to summon it whenever he needed its help.</p>

  <p>However, different creatures grow in different ways.</p>

  <p>There was the Genuine Dragon that belonged to a large race, which was completely different from the Black Weasel that grew up free on its own.</p>

  <p>It was why Mike had created a place that served as a resting space for the Genuine Dragons when he constructed his inner world. In addition, he also used the place as the spirit beast bag.</p>

  <p>From the Genuine Dragon race, many other related races had emerged as well, such as the Dragon Lineage Human race.</p>

  <p>The Genuine Dragon was considered a kind of super legendary beast, but the strongest individuals were true spirits. A fully-grown, adult Ancestral Dragon could be considered a true spirit.</p>

  <p>Now, the powerful warriors of the Evolutionary Universe had entered the Genuine Dragon World along with Luo Zheng, which quickly caused a huge uproar.</p>

  <p>The mystery of the nine dragons at that time was a huge mystery to ordinary living beings, but the Genuine Dragons were already aware of the conspiracy. That conspiracy had been arranged by a Five-clawed Black Dragon from the Genuine Dragon World.</p>

  <p>Back then, it was thanks to Murphy's help that the Five-clawed Black Dragon had managed to kill the Five-clawed Golden Dragon and his eight brothers.</p>

  <p>However, the Genuine Dragon World didn't directly intervene in the war between the two universes and instead, simply paid close attention to whoever won or lost. Of course, the Five-clawed Black Dragon hoped that the Sacred race would win. The Genuine Dragons were just the contractual beasts of the Holy Being, and they weren't born in the universe. Thus, the contracts that had been signed in the past would lose their effectivity when the Evolutionary Universe was destroyed and Mike died. The Five-clawed Black Dragon became free and was then able to travel to the divine land.</p>

  <p>The Five-clawed Black Dragon thought that it was a pity that the final outcome of the war was way worse than he had expected. When he learned that the Sacred race had been defeated, he realized that the real trouble was yet to come.</p>

  <p>But since he was a contractual beast, he couldn't leave the Genuine Dragon World without Mike's permission. There was nowhere to flee, so the dragon could only gather other race members to guard the area with their lives on the line.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon had created the most powerful array in the Genuine Dragon World. Moreover, there were even three top-rank Supreme Lords including Supreme Lord of Oracle, Supreme Lord of Original Sin, and the head of the Celestial Position race among the dozen or so Supreme Lords who went with them. Furthermore, they were also accompanied by the newly advanced True God, Tianming, and the Ancestral Dragon.</p>

  <p>It was no doubt that such a powerful force was capable enough to start a universal war.</p>

  <p>Therefore, it came as no surprise when the Genuine Dragon race was swiftly defeated and not all of the forty Genuine Dragons were on the Five-clawed Black Dragon's side. Back then when the Five-clawed Black Dragon attacked, many of the Genuine Dragons did not know the internal causes and by the time that they had regained their senses, nine of the dragons had already died. Although the Genuine Dragons were displeased by the Five-clawed Black Dragon's actions, there was nothing they could do. It wasn't long before they got defeated, and nearly twenty Genuine Dragons gave up on resisting.</p>

  <p>After the group of warriors entered the Genuine Dragon World, it just took them seven days to kill the Five-clawed Black Dragon.</p>

  <p>They even had four days out of those seven days to rest.</p>

  <p>It was also Tianming's first time to showcase his strength in that battle. He had only used one sword attack to kill the Five-clawed Black Dragon in the battle in the Genuine Dragon World.</p>

  <p>Only after the rebellion of the Genuine Dragon World had been pacified, did the Evolutionary Universe finally become peaceful.</p>

  <p>However, this was only the beginning for Godly Geniuses like Luo Zheng and Tianming.</p>

  <p>After returning to the Evolutionary Universe, Wynn once again summoned Tianming.</p>

  <p>Back in the war between two universes, Wynn had only his head left.</p>

  <p>After the body self-detonated, the inner world in his belly was completely destroyed.</p>

  <p>Although Wynn had once again condensed a body and looked no different from an ordinary person, he had already lost his Godly Tile and the cultivation base of a True God. Though his soul was still powerful, it was destined that he would never be able to achieve anything in the future. Thus he could only lead a mediocre life in the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>Tianming said his goodbyes to Luo Zheng after his talk with Wynn. Half a month later, he followed Wynn's instructions and ascended into the divine land.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng was confused at Tianming's slightly ambiguous words when they had parted.</p>

  <p>What Luo Zheng didn't know was that Tianming's mission was even greater than his. Thus, they would probably never meet again after his trip to the divine land.</p>

  <p>Many years later, a major event had transpired.</p>

  <p>The one hundred and twenty-eight Heavenly Destinies had all appeared.</p>

  <p>Many races also re-divided their forces and perhaps as the compensation to the Humanity Alliance, their force had thirteen Supreme Lords. With just the number of Supreme Lords alone, the Humanity Alliance could be considered the strongest power in the entire universe.</p>

  <p>As for Yolande, she had obtained an extremely powerful Heavenly Destiny and became the fourth top-rank Supreme Lord in the Evolutionary Universe. The other three top-rank Supreme Lords included Supreme Lord of Oracle, Supreme Lord of Original Sin, and the head of the Celestial Position race.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Demon Night race and the ogre race also received generous rewards!</p>

  <p>On the contrary, the Blessed Buddha Land was slowly on the decline.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the four great clans of the Thoughtless Minds were bestowed with inheritances left behind by the disciples of the Holy Being. Their goal was to help the Evolutionary Universe, and now that the threats of the Sacred race were gone, they no longer needed to expand. Thus, they did not fight for the Crown of Destiny but instead, even gave others several Crowns of Destiny.</p>

  <p>In that period of time, Luo Zheng spent his hours cultivating in seclusion and enjoyed a peaceful life with his girls.</p>

  <p>The time flow rate in the divine land was different from that in the Evolutionary Universe. Luo Zheng actually knew that once he stepped into the divine land, he had to spend a lot of time there before he could return to the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>It was known that after having cultivated to reach the level of True Gods, time would be in a limitless state.</p>

  <p>The length of time such as a thousand years, ten thousand years, millions of years, or even billions of years did not matter to a True God because they never aged.</p>

  <p>However, Ning Yudie, Mu Ning, and even Geoffrey were different from Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Their lifespan was limited.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng decided to go to the divine land and stay there for a long period of time, he would only be greeted by the piled bones of his loved ones.</p>

  <p>The strongest enemy of all creatures inferior to the True God was time.</p>

  <p>Not even Supreme Lords could escape its clutches.</p>

  <p>However, not long after, Luo Zheng found a method to resolve this problem in the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>Four years after Tianming had left the Evolutionary Universe, Luo Zheng swallowed the Emotion Closing Pill he had obtained from the fairy palace. Even though Saul had warned him that he could not consume the pill unless it was absolutely necessary, he still swallowed it.</p>

  <p>Now, Luo Zheng lagged behind other Godly Geniuses.</p>

  <p>Except for Lone who was not that talented, the Lotus Flowers of Xenia, Nathan, Lucille, and the other Godly Geniuses had all bloomed fully.</p>

  <p>Moreover, half a year ago, a bolt of lightning was charged out from the secluded cultivation place that Xenia stayed in and had created a miraculous view.</p>

  <p>Even though Xenia had yet to condense the Godly Tile, she had probably made a considerable breakthrough. Perhaps she would be the second Godly Genius to become a True God, only second to Tianming.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng was not truly a Godly Genius as his Lotus Flower had yet to fully bloom.</p>

  <p>It wasn't that Luo Zheng was inferior to the other Godly Geniuses because he didn't have great talents and a solid foundation. The reason he couldn't make a breakthrough was most likely related to his inner world.</p>

  <p>After all, the other Godly Geniuses all cultivated life vitality, and Zheng's chaotic energy was fundamentally different from the life vitality.</p>

  <p>Therefore, no one could guide him in his path of cultivation— he could only rely on his own comprehension.</p>

  <p>Helpless, Luo Zheng could only use the Emotion Closing Pill to break through the Godly Genius' shackles.</p>

  <p>The moment Luo Zheng had swallowed the Emotion Closing Pill, he immediately felt a strong presence rush into his mind!</p>

  <p>The facts proved that Saul's warning was right. Since the Emotion Closing Pill was a seven times refined pill, it was a spiritual object itself.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng had got it a few years ago, it had actually quietly condensed its own consciousness.</p>

  <p>What happened was, the pill actually wanted to possess Zheng's body shell!</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Zheng's Gold Fighting Soul was extremely tough and with the Emperor Soul Imprint in his soul, he was able to release a strong soul pressure to gradually suppress the Emotion Closing Pill's consciousness.</p>

  <p>Then again, the dangers of the soul battle weren't any less than the dangers he had faced before.</p>

  <p>It was because of that very battle that Luo Zheng had been unconscious for nearly half a month and had only woken up again slowly with the help of the Celestial Position race.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng had just regained his consciousness, his soul was still quite weak. However, he discovered that his soul had more imprints. Upon closer look, he saw that there were small, pale golden swords in the center of the Emperor Soul Imprints!</p>
