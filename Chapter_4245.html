<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The green lines on the huge square zigzagged, like a huge rune array.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian cautiously followed Elder Xue on the path as wide as his shoulders.</p>

  <p>If he so much as crossed this green line, he'd instantly die. Luo Nian took every step with care, vigilantly eyeing the green lines before him.</p>

  <p>The chimney was located in the center of the huge square. It was roughly around ten thousand feet away, but because of the zigzagging path, it was as though they'd walked hundreds of thousands of feet.</p>

  <p>The other races also sent out their representatives at the same time, so there were more than ten people walking on the huge square. Sometimes, when they got close to each other, Luo Nian could feel a hint of hostility in their eyes.</p>

  <p>After all, this was a competition of sorts. It was only natural that the six great races were hostile to each other. It was just because of the special nature of the region that they were not allowed to fight each other head on.</p>

  <p>Ten minutes later, Luo Nian and his group finally arrived at the foot of the chimney.</p>

  <p>Although Elder Xue had been here for countless years, it was the first time for him to observe the chimney up close.</p>

  <p>From afar, the chimney looked like a looming black monster, but now as he observed it closely, he saw it differently.</p>

  <p>Squinting, he realized the chimney was made of pure black metal, glistening under the sun.</p>

  <p>Elder Xue walked towards the outer wall of the chimney and pressed his hand against it gently.</p>

  <p>He had been thinking about the mysteries of the chimney for so long.</p>

  <p>Now that he was finally in front of it, he had mixed feelings.</p>

  <p>Just then, he heard someone chuckling from behind him.</p>

  <p>Three black apes approached from another path. The black ape in the lead said with a smile, "The Elemental race is usually so cautious, but they sent five people this time. Four members of their race already died a few days ago. So, is it only Elder Xue remaining in their camp now?"</p>

  <p>"There is a human spirit among them. Is he the helper that Elder Xue found?"</p>

  <p>"Last time, one of us saw this human spirit."</p>

  <p>These black apes who were talking amongst themselves were from the Cold Ape race.</p>

  <p>Among the six great races in the Deep Space, the Elemental race was the weakest. The only reason why they were able to rise to prominence was that Elder Xue had taken action before the intelligence of other five races was fully developed. And that was also the reason why the other races had always looked down upon the Elemental race.</p>

  <p>In the past, several races had sent killers to assassinate Elder Xue, but the members of the Elemental race had risked their lives to protect him.</p>

  <p>"Elder Xue doesn't stay in the camp. I'm Elder Xue," replied Elder Xue calmly.</p>

  <p>The three Cold Apes were obviously stunned for a moment, and the one in the lead showed a puzzled expression. "Everyone knows that you are the greatest help to the Elemental race," he said slowly. "Why are you risking your life today? Have you found a way to crack the Levitation Tower?"</p>

  <p>Elder Xue wasn't surprised at their reaction. It was a well-known fact that he was extremely important to the Elemental race, so it didn't make sense for him to go out in the field like this.</p>

  <p>The Elemental race would do everything in their power to protect Elder Xue, even at the cost of their leader's life.</p>

  <p>"No," answered Elder Xue honestly.</p>

  <p>"Then why do you come here?" the Cold Ape asked, his confusion intensifying.</p>

  <p>Once they entered the huge square, there was no turning around. Elder Xue would definitely not be able to make it back.</p>

  <p>Elder Xue just smiled and ignored the Cold Ape's question.</p>

  <p>Just then, another race came in from the other side of the chimney. It was the Wrona race.</p>

  <p>The Cold Ape race and the Wrona race were allies. They had always been on good terms. Seeing their allies enter the chimney, the Cold Ape immediately announced, "Look, Elder Xue of the Elemental race has come personally!"</p>

  <p>This was indeed no small matter.</p>

  <p>The Elemental race had always been ahead of the other five races on the chimney, and that was all thanks to Elder Xue.</p>

  <p>The other five races had all pressured the Elemental race, offering them gifts and benefits in the hopes that Elder Xue would help them. But in the end, he had refused all of them.</p>

  <p>Thus, the other five races decided to join forces against the Elemental race. Only then were they able to force Elder Xue to share some information with them.</p>

  <p>"Elder Xue?"</p>

  <p>"Are you sure you will be able to pass the Levitation Tower?"</p>

  <p>"Entering the tower rashly is a suicide mission! Aren't you afraid of death!?"</p>

  <p>The several members of the Wrona race were stunned. They had the same idea as the Cold Ape race. Since Elder Xue dared to come in person, this must've meant he had come up with a solution!</p>

  <p>Two of the members of the Wrona race glared at Elder Xue murderously.</p>

  <p>Naturally, they didn't want him to succeed.</p>

  <p>However, the Fostering race had imposed powerful restrictions on the whole square, and no one was able to break these rules. Even if they wanted to, they couldn't stop the Elemental race.</p>

  <p>As the members of the Wrona race stared at the Elemental race with puzzlement and worry, the other three races arrived, one after the other.</p>

  <p>Every time the Rippling Water Day came, the six great races would scramble to enter the chimney. But today, they entered calmly, seemingly in no rush. Everyone wanted to see what Elder Xue was going to do.</p>

  <p>Paying no attention to them, Elder Xue said to his group, "Let's go!"</p>

  <p>The three members of the Elemental race took the lead in entering the gate to the chimney, followed by Elder Xue and Luo Nian.</p>

  <p>The door at the foot of the chimney was only as tall as a person. When the five of them approached, it automatically began to shrink.</p>

  <p>Upon entering the gate, Luo Nian took a glance at his surroundings. He found that the interior of the chimney was an extremely wide, metal hall.</p>

  <p>The floor and walls of the hall were all made of black metal, similar to the chimney's exterior. On the surface of the metal were countless engraved golden rings. Some of the rings were independent of each other, while some were connected to each other. Overall, it looked like a haphazard mess.</p>

  <p>"What are these rings?" Luo Nian asked, pointing at the golden rings.</p>

  <p>"Ring patterns," Elder Xue answered immediately. "It's exactly what I thought. At the bottom of the chimney, there are the ring patterns left behind by the Fostering race. Anyway, we're not in a hurry to go up. Wait for me to decipher them."</p>

  <p>The ring patterns were actually the written words of the Fostering race and the Cinnabar race.</p>

  <p>The creatures of the chaos were very interested in Sanskrit words. Masters like the Wing King and the Primeval Lord of Heaven had spent their entire lives deciphering Sanskrit words.</p>

  <p>The Four Spirits Sect in the main world, on the other hand, were addicted to ring patterns. Kincaid, Sheehan, and Cornelius each had great attainments in the ring patterns.</p>

  <p>Elder Xue's attainments in the ring patterns were not as great as theirs in the past, but by now, he not only stayed in the Deep Space for a long time, but also had the body of the Elemental race. His attainments in the ring patterns far surpassed those of anyone else in the Four Spirits Sect.</p>

  <p>After saying that, Elder Xue gently leaned against the wall and began deciphering the ring patterns.</p>

  <p>"The Levitation Tower is the root of our race," he deciphered slowly. "It is..."</p>

  <p>The structure of the ring patterns might have been very simple, but it was difficult to decipher them one by one. After all, they were connected to each other, and the line space was quite narrow, so it was difficult to read them. Even if Elder Xue had stayed in the Deep Space for a long time, it was still difficult even for him to decipher them.</p>

  <p>"It is also an opportunity for us to start all over again. After we were defeated by the Cinnabar race, we took it as fate dictated by nirvana.</p>

  <p>Everyone who enters the tower comes for this opportunity..." Luo Nian read aloud.</p>

  <p>Elder Xue froze. Turning around abruptly, he stared at Luo Nian in disbelief.</p>

  <p>Embarrassed, Luo Nian rubbed his hands shyly. "I... I seem to be able to read these words..."</p>
