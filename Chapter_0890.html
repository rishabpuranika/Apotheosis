<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 890 The Situation (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Purple Heart Sacred Place sprouted from the Purple Heart Sect.</p>

  <p>As for the words 'Purple Heart', it was derived from the name of a spring water in the Sun Mountain. Its name was Purple Heart Spring.</p>

  <p>As this incomparably clean spring water flowed through the Sun Mountain, it would fuse with a very special type of mineral resource that was unique to the area. As a result of that, the spring water would have a distinctive purple glow. It was said that anyone who drank the water from the Purple Heart Spring would live healthily and strongly their whole life and would not get sick, even once.</p>

  <p>At that time, the Purple Heart Sect was also a small second-grade sect.</p>

  <p>However, under the pressure from the other races, the Purple Heart Sect had been forced to continuously merge with other human sects, until they finally grew into a larger sect, effectively becoming the most important refuge for humans.</p>

  <p>The Purple Heart Spring had now become the sacred spring water of the Purple Heart Sacred Place. Although this spring water didn't have much effect on warriors, the numerous humans of the Purple Heart Sacred Place were still honored and proud to be able to drink from the Purple Heart Spring!</p>

  <p>Three human men stood beside the Purple Heart Spring.</p>

  <p>One of the three men wore a purple crown, and he looked very handsome and attractive. No one could tell how high his cultivation base was. His name was Miguel Situ, and he was the current leader of the Purple Heart Sacred Place. He had already reached the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>The other two were elderly men. Although they looked weathered and old, their eyes were sharp like lightning and they looked energetic.</p>

  <p>These two old men were also the masters of the Soul Sea Realm. They had a long lifespan? some warriors of the Soul Sea Realm who had lived for a long time could even live up to nine thousand years or even over ten thousand years and become eternal. Those were the ancient masters.</p>

  <p>"Right now, the people in the sacred place are all panic-stricken. If the ogres still do not let their troops retreat and move away, I'm afraid our sacred place would fall into unprecedented chaos..." Miguel Situ bent down, and drank water from the spring.</p>

  <p>"They wouldn't dare attack," one of the old men said affirmatively.</p>

  <p>"If they really want to do it, they would have done it already." With a deep sigh and a glint of defeat in his eyes, he continued, "If our Purple Heart Sacred Place is thrown into disarray just because we are all scared by the ogres, it will just be very ridiculous and we will be laughed at by other races!" His defeated demeanor quickly turned into rage.</p>

  <p>Miguel Situ shook his head and said, "There's nothing we can do about it.</p>

  <p>The human race has been weak for so many years. Now that we're suddenly facing the threat of the ogres, we cannot just say that we are not scared or worried. That would be a total lie." Miguel Situ got up and looked directly at the two old men. "The ogres are going to come over here to try and fight with us. That's what would happen. The thing is that the number of warriors in the Tower of Sin is small. Do you think others would believe that the ogres can win against the Purple Heart Sacred Place or they would just trust Luo Luo Zheng who doesn't come from the Purple Heart Sacred Place?"</p>

  <p>At that period of time, the Purple Heart Sacred Place had been sending people to the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Fabian and Jarrod had also shuttled back and forth between the Tower of Sin and the Purple Heart Sacred Place's transmission gate.</p>

  <p>Fabian was so confident that he swore that the ogres would not dare attack the Purple Heart Sacred Place, and that the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place would definitely take action against the ogres.</p>

  <p>At the beginning, Miguel Situ was still a bit hesitant. After all, rather than trusting Luo Luo Zheng, who he had never met and who was just a first-level war general in the Tower of Sin, he believed in his own skills and strengths more!</p>

  <p>But no matter how strong Miguel Situ was, he still wouldn't be able to fight against the numerous Soul Sea Realm masters of the two sacred places of the ogre.</p>

  <p>Just as the Purple Heart Sacred Place was preparing for battle, some warriors of the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place were sent to help the Purple Heart Sacred Place and to share some strategies.</p>

  <p>Because of that, when the two ogre sacred places made their move, the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place also took action...</p>

  <p>When that happened, Miguel Situ finally understood that regardless of whether he was willing or not, the fate of the Purple Heart Sacred Place had already been tied to the mysterious guy from the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>From Miguel's point of view, the Purple Heart Sacred Place currently held a considerable advantage. The ogres were only putting on an act, and up until now, other than destroying a second-grade sect on the outer perimeter of the Purple Heart Sacred Place, they hadn't taken any other action. The ogres had not dared to take a step closer to the Purple Heart Sacred Place, mainly because Amber was bringing her warriors into the range of the two ogre sacred places.</p>

  <p>Despite Miguel Situ not being worried, the humans of the Purple Heart Sacred Place were still worried.</p>

  <p>Majority of those people were still unwilling to tie their fate to Luo Luo Zheng who was just a first-level war general!</p>

  <p>The warriors with the lowest ranks in the Purple Heart Sacred Place and even some strong war sages couldn't trust Luo Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>This was considering that Miguel Situ had already spread the news of what had happened in the Tower of Sin. When people heard of that, instead of being comforted and excited for the future of human race, many chose not to believe it and called Luo Luo Zheng a fraud. Many war lords and war sages even began evacuating their families away from the Purple Heart Sacred Place!</p>

  <p>That made Miguel Situ very upset, but there wasn't much that he could do.</p>

  <p>He couldn't enter the Cursed Land, and it was even more impossible for him to go against an ogre master of the Soul Sea Realm. The only thing he could do at that time was to wait.</p>
