  <p>
</p>

  <p>Every time new Holy Beings were born, it was customary for the existing Holy Beings to welcome them in the Hall of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>This was a ceremony of accepting new members into this circle, even though it consisted of only a dozen people.</p>

  <p>However, this time, the situation was different. Too many things had happened in the divine land in recent days.</p>

  <p>The alliance of the powerful clans had actually been established by the Yellow Emperor Guards. Before this, they had used every method they could to counter Luo Zheng. But now that Luo Zheng had defeated all the Yellow Emperor Guards on his own, no one in the entire divine land dared to go against him.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the scene of Luo Zheng mercilessly killing Samuel had left a deep impression on the Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>It seemed that Luo Zheng wasn't restricted by the Ruling Slate and could easily destroy his opponent's universe. It could be said that the fate of the Holy Beings was now in Luo Zheng's hands, which put them all in a terrible predicament.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng really wanted to punish the Holy Beings of the alliance, what could they do?</p>

  <p>"Revise all the rules? Is he being serious?"</p>

  <p>"It's extremely difficult to revise every rule on the Ruling Slate. Does he really think he can do as he wishes?"</p>

  <p>"Anyway, we'd better go to him now." The Holy Beings quickly talked among themselves and came to a decision.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, inside the Hall of Holy Beings stood Cade and the other new Holy Beings, all completely unaware of the events that had occurred after they had entered the Mountain of Holy Beings. They couldn't help but stare at Luo Zheng with an incredulous expression on their faces when they heard him summoning all the Holy Beings to him. 'Who does Luo Zheng think he is?' they wondered.</p>

  <p>They were all aware that Luo Zheng was a great talent, but they didn't think that he was strong enough to command all the Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>They didn't believe that Jeremiah, Clark, Murphy, and the others would obey Luo Zheng's words.</p>

  <p>So naturally, what happened next came as an enormous shock to all of them.</p>

  <p>All of the old Holy Beings began showing up one after another. As they appeared, they even greeted Luo Zheng with cupped hands.</p>

  <p>'How did Luo Zheng make the Holy Beings submit to him?' Cade wondered in awe.</p>

  <p>Once all the Holy Beings appeared, they all stared at Luo Zheng with an awkward expression.</p>

  <p>They had not wanted to come to the Hall of Holy Beings to see Luo Zheng at all, but they had no choice.</p>

  <p>All of them had caused Luo Zheng great trouble in the past. Now, if Luo Zheng wanted to settle the score with them, they would not be able to escape his wrath.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's gaze swept past each of the faces of these Holy Beings before he finally said in an indifferent tone, "One of you is missing. Where is Murphy?"</p>

  <p>"Murphy? It's been a few days since I last saw him," Clark said with a frown.</p>

  <p>Over the past few days, the Holy Beings of the alliance of the powerful clans had often gathered together to discuss countermeasures, but none of them had seen Murphy.</p>

  <p>As soon as Clark finished his words, however, a figure appeared out of thin air, outlined by a fluctuation of space. It was none other than Murphy.</p>

  <p>When Murphy's eyes met Luo Zheng's, he braced himself and said, "Luo Zheng, I found something in the Murphy Universe that I think will be of great use to you."</p>

  <p>Then, he took out a flying ship from his space ring. It was the Trumpet Flying Ship that the Yellow Emperor Guards had used.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled knowingly. "Is a flying ship so complicated that you had to spend so many days studying it? Or did you consider using it to escape?"</p>

  <p>When Murphy heard this, a hint of anxiety crossed his face. He immediately said, "The divine land is the basis for us Holy Beings. I don't have the slightest intention of fleeing!"</p>

  <p>"It's a pity that you are a Holy Being, isn't it? Your inner world is integrated with the divine land, so you can't escape at all. If you were a consummate True God or a Demi-holy Being, I'm afraid that you would have already escaped. Isn't that right?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Murphy gritted his teeth, but he did not dare to argue with Luo Zheng. After all, Luo Zheng was completely correct.</p>

  <p>When Murphy had discovered the flying ship, he had indeed thought of escaping with it. The idea of using the Trumpet Flying Ship to flee to the Source World would have been a great one... if he hadn't been a Holy Being. His Rebirth Land, the Murphy Universe, endowed him with great power but also restricted him from leaving. After all, he couldn't just leave his universe at the mercy of Luo Zheng and others in the divine land.</p>

  <p>After careful consideration, he had finally chosen to hand over the flying ship to Luo Zheng, hoping that this act could help him win Luo Zheng's favor at least.</p>

  <p>What he did not know was that everything in the divine land was under Luo Zheng's control and that Luo Zheng already knew everything.</p>

  <p>In the sky above the Time Sea, bursts of lightning appeared from time to time and shot out in all directions.</p>

  <p>Whether they were hiding high up in the air or deep underground, nobody could escape the punishment of the Ruling Slate.</p>

  <p>Three of the five Yellow Emperor Guards who had fled had already died.</p>

  <p>Only Clement and another one of the guards were still alive. The latter cast a strong enchanted barrier and struggled to survive, while Clement went into the depths of the ground and hid in the Lethal Fire Magma.</p>

  <p>Anyway, both of them were at the end of their strength under the baptism of the lightning. In less than five days, they would definitely be killed by the lightning.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng knew each and every move of these Yellow Emperor Guards no matter where they were. So naturally, he also knew about the existence of the flying ship.</p>

  <p>In fact, even if Murphy had decided to escape with the flying ship, Luo Zheng would have easily been able to stop him. It was lucky for Murphy that he had decided to come here instead.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did not pursue this matter further. Instead, he said to all the Holy Beings, "Today, I've summoned all of you here because I want to revise the rules of the divine land."</p>

  <p>"Revise the rules?"</p>

  <p>"How can you change the rules on the Ruling Slate at will?"</p>

  <p>"Are you sure?"</p>

  <p>Filled with endless doubts, the Holy Beings burst into a heated discussion.</p>

  <p>The rules not only restricted the power of the Holy Beings but also prevented them from killing each other.</p>

  <p>"I've already erased all the rules on the Ruling Slate," Luo Zheng replied nonchalantly.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing this, the Holy Beings widened their eyes in disbelief.</p>

  <p>Cade and the other new Holy Beings were also stunned into silence.</p>

  <p>The Ruling Slate was like a holy book of law for the Holy Beings. The rules on it could never be violated. How was it possible that Luo Zheng had erased all the rules?</p>

  <p>"There won't be any powerful clans on the Floating Islands in the future.</p>

  <p>From now on, the only ones who can live on the Time Sea are the members of the Nine Li race," Luo Zheng announced.</p>

  <p>His words didn't make sense to the Holy Beings at all.</p>

  <p>They had heard about the legends of the Sacred race, of course.</p>

  <p>But hadn't it been completely massacred in the past?</p>

  <p>Ignoring their expressions of confusion, Luo Zheng continued, "I'm doing this so that the divine land can be returned to the people that it originally belonged to."</p>

  <p>Lorena's biggest dream was to revive all the members of the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>Although countless years had passed since the deaths of the members of the Nine Li race, their Memory Flames still existed. Lorena knew that she could find all of them once she had complete control of the Reincarnation Soul Weapon.</p>

  <p>The only remaining problem was the matter of the bloodline. After reincarnation, the members of the Nine Li race would have their past memories, but their bloodlines would no longer exist.</p>

  <p>Of course, this problem could be solved by Timotheus and his companions.</p>

  <p>In addition, Lorena had come up with a rather radical idea. As far as she was concerned, everything in the divine land belonged to the Nine Li race, including the divine citizens and the True Gods.</p>

  <p>As such, she wanted to directly revive all the members of the Nine Li race by forcefully stuffing their Memory Flames into the minds of living people.</p>

  <p>After all, these people were reincarnations of the members of the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng, Mike, and the others were all dead against that idea.</p>

  <p>Following Lorena's plan would be equivalent to killing all the living people in the divine land as their Memory Flames would be completely wiped out.</p>

  <p>Finally, they had come up with another plan: to let the new-born lives in the divine land carry the old memories of the members of the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>Although this was a slow way to recover the Nine Li race's glory, the Nine Li race would be completely revived in a few hundred years or so without affecting the existing people in the divine land.</p>
