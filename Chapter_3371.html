<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3371 Sea Dragon Race </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Each speck of dust was a small individual that contributed to the black smog area in the Chaotic Source World. The area had the diameter of millions of miles.</p>

  <p>The smog was so dense and heavy that it was difficult for all living beings to move, let alone the wind.</p>

  <p>Naturally, the wind of the Chaotic Source World required more strength than they could have imagined.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng found himself being carried by the wind, he now understood how Feng Ge travelled tens of thousands of miles into the Chaotic Source World in such a short amount of time.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge did not make it on her own! She rode along the strong wind to get there.</p>

  <p>But if that was the case, then perhaps Yan had also been transported by the wind.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng moved in the air at an increasingly high speed.</p>

  <p>'Before I came to the Chaotic Source World, I had never heard of such a strong wind. Has the Chaotic Source World changed?' he thought.</p>

  <p>Besides, the woman from the Snake Goddess race had dropped a hint that Yan was waiting for him there.</p>

  <p>It seemed the woman was unaware of any change that had occurred.</p>

  <p>Five minutes had passed and the strong wind finally began to subside.</p>

  <p>As the wind calmed down, Luo Zheng steadily descended and landed on a firm, brown rock.</p>

  <p>Using the soul mark, he found that Feng Ge was now around sixty thousand miles away from him.</p>

  <p>It was a far distance, and he knew he couldn't get there so quickly.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng was not in a hurry. After all, everyone had just arrived at the Chaotic Source World. It would take them time to adjust and get used to the place, so there shouldn't be any threats soon.</p>

  <p>He stood on the tall rock and looked around. The place was lifeless, quiet, and deserted. He didn't even spot greenery from where he was standing.</p>

  <p>The black smog might have just been too heavy, making the environment too harsh for ordinary beings. Perhaps nothing could thrive here except for the Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>'Before we set out, Dorothy mentioned that the Chaotic Source Spirits like hiding underground and in the rocks, ' Luo Zheng thought to himself. 'Maybe I can search for them in the rocks.'</p>

  <p>He then lifted his foot and stomped down hard against the rock he stood on.</p>

  <p>"Clatter..."</p>

  <p>With a crisp sound, cracks began to appear across the surface. The formation suddenly collapsed and disintegrated into countless, rocky pieces.</p>

  <p>Dorothy also mentioned that there was no Chaotic Source Spirit in weak rocks. If they were to dwell in one, it would have to be extremely solid.</p>

  <p>Even so, Luo Zheng still continued to search among the rock fragments, having no success in finding a Chaotic Source Spirit.</p>

  <p>He jumped to another rock and stomped hard on the surface.</p>

  <p>"Clatter..."</p>

  <p>Like the first one, the rock cracked and eventually shattered.</p>

  <p>This time, Luo Zheng didn't rummage through the broken pieces, but he made his way to another rock and jumped.</p>

  <p>He repeated this on 20 more rocks, jumping and shattering them into little pieces. Of course, he ended up with no finds.</p>

  <p>This did not discourage him.</p>

  <p>He was only along the edge of the Chaotic Source World. Moreover, obtaining the Chaotic Source Spirit was never going to be easy.</p>

  <p>With all his determination, Luo Zheng jumped on rock after rock in the hopes of finding a solid one. After he landed on the 28th rock, to his surprise, it did not break into pieces. It let out an odd, muffled sound.</p>

  <p>He stomped on it some more, each step having more power than the last.</p>

  <p>However, the rock wouldn't budge, and it did not crack at all.</p>

  <p>His eyes lit up and the corners of his lips lifted. He thought, 'Could this rock have the Chaotic Source Spirit?</p>

  <p>What luck!'</p>

  <p>After fighting Ahmad, Luo Zheng learned a lot about the Chaotic Source Realm.</p>

  <p>He knew that the Chaotic Source Reinforcement didn't make one's physical body stronger.</p>

  <p>Essentially, the Chaotic Source Reinforcement was to fuse the Chaotic Source Spirit with the body. After this, the attacks received by a warrior would be borne by the Chaotic Source Spirit.</p>

  <p>However, the Chaotic Source Spirit's ability to bear power had a limit.</p>

  <p>When the power exceeded the amount that the Chaotic Source Spirit could bear, it would fall into a state of fatigue, unable to bear any more. When this happened, the body that had undergone the Chaotic Source Reinforcement would collapse and weaken.</p>

  <p>If a Chaotic Source Spirit was in the rock, it could help the rock bear outside forces and attacks. That was why the rock seemed indestructible. It was the Chaotic Source Spirit that was strong, not the rock itself.</p>

  <p>"Let's see just how much power you can bear..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smirked and jumped up abruptly, circling up in the air before pounding his fists downwards.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>He exerted the power in his arms, which was around 500 Jun.</p>

  <p>The huge rock trembled, but didn't budge. It withstood Luo Zheng's punches.</p>

  <p>"Interesting!"</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>Undisturbed by the rock's resilience, he continued to punch down as hard as he could.</p>

  <p>And after eight solid punches, a minuscule crack appeared right down the middle of the rock.</p>

  <p>"Argh!"</p>

  <p>A grayish brown ball-like thing squeezed out from the small crack, and bounced away to the side.</p>

  <p>Even though it was Luo Zheng's first encounter with the thing, he was quite certain that this was the Chaotic Source Spirit.</p>

  <p>It seemed that Luo Zheng's strong blows made the Chaotic Source Spirit jump out of the rock and escape.</p>

  <p>"You want to escape? I don't think so!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng leapt into the sky and chased after the Chaotic Source Spirit, like a vicious hawk on the hunt for its prey.</p>

  <p>However, the black smog slowed Luo Zheng down. It was a good thing that the Chaotic Source Spirit didn't move quickly. Otherwise, Luo Zheng would have lost it by now.</p>

  <p>The Chaotic Source Spirit grew exhausted after bearing Luo Zheng's attacks. As it ran away, it became slower and slower.</p>

  <p>This worked to Luo Zheng's advantage! But as he got closer to the little thing, three figures suddenly appeared in front of him. One of them leaned in and grabbed the Chaotic Source Spirit.</p>

  <p>These three figures had red skin, and their bodies were covered with a thick layer of scales. They had long, thick tails behind them, which only meant one thing? they were from the Sea Dragon race.</p>

  <p>"Wow! I didn't expect to find a Chaotic Source Spirit minutes after entering the Chaotic Source World!" One of them was overjoyed to find the Chaotic Source Spirit, holding it firmly in his hand as it struggled to get out.</p>

  <p>He couldn't let it out of his sight. After all, there were only 200, 000 Chaotic Source Spirits. So many people fought over them because they were so rare.</p>

  <p>Thanks to Luo Zheng, this particular man was happy to have found one so easily.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng was not too happy about this. His face darkened slightly. "I found this Chaotic Source Spirit from the rock and dug it out myself." He looked at them fiercely and added, "Could you please return it to me?"</p>

  <p>The three had no clue that Luo Zheng was there in the first place, so they were shocked to see him.</p>

  <p>They knew that Luo Zheng's identity was unusual, but the Chaotic Source World was different from the outside world.</p>

  <p>This was a rule set by the Snake Goddess, who they feared and respected very much. If they really killed Luo Zheng, no one would punish them, so perhaps now was a good moment to kill Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Hey, are you out of your mind?" one of the Sea Dragon members uttered.</p>

  <p>"No one owns a Chaotic Source Spirit until they get a hold of it." The man smiled, taunting Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The group of three were not afraid of Luo Zheng, because no matter how powerful he was, Luo Zheng stood alone against three.</p>

  <p>To them, Luo Zheng was on a losing end.</p>
