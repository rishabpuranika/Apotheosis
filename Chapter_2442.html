  <p>
</p>

  <p>Multiple clouds of dark green miasmas floated around the twisted ghosts.</p>

  <p>The miasmas flashed with phosphorescence and were highly toxic.</p>

  <p>"This is the Soul Corroding Ganoderma, one of the most dangerous things ever. Even a consummate True God couldn't pick it. Are you sure you want to?" Reinhard asked.</p>

  <p>The warriors' faces turned pale at the sight of the ferocious monsters and at Reinhard's words.</p>

  <p>"The poisonous miasmas are about to float over. Stay here if you want to die," Reinhard said and led the Sword Clan disciples forward.</p>

  <p>The other True Gods followed them as soon as they left.</p>

  <p>Duke and his friends also looked sullen when they saw the Soul Corroding Ganodermas.</p>

  <p>All the wealthy clans on the Floating Islands had gathered some information about the debate venue. But they were not as familiar with it as the Sword Clan was.</p>

  <p>If they weren't careful enough in such a dangerous place, they would most likely be killed. And if Reinhard wanted to do something bad to them, it would be difficult for them to defend themselves against him.</p>

  <p>"There is a fork in the road. We need to go right!"</p>

  <p>A massive root loomed ahead of the crowd, dividing the path into two. To the right was a narrow cave.</p>

  <p>The moment Reinhard finished speaking, he swooped into this cave.</p>

  <p>The others had no choice but to follow him in. Zheng and Yan also squeezed into the cave.</p>

  <p>They traveled through this cave for a while before they came upon an open space.</p>

  <p>Their surrounding environment now changed drastically.</p>

  <p>The wet, soft ground turned into a mottled stone road. There were still a lot of huge roots around them, through which they could indistinctly see some walls. But these walls were riddled with holes, having been unable to withstand the erosion that the tree roots were causing.</p>

  <p>They walked along the mottled stone road for a while, and with time, the road became wider and wider. A faint layer of mist prevented all the True Gods from looking ahead.</p>

  <p>'The bottom of the Sunrest Tree is so wide!'</p>

  <p>Zheng thought to himself. He hadn't expected the debate venue to be so vast.</p>

  <p>But the top of the Sunrest Tree was so huge that he couldn't see its edges.</p>

  <p>So it wasn't surprising that its trunk was so wide and the bottom covered such a huge space.</p>

  <p>After they had walked a few miles, an arc appeared on the stone path. It extended from end to end, blocking the path of the True Gods.</p>

  <p>Reinhard turned his head to look at the crowd and said, "This line is one of the most powerful restrictions in the debate venue. And it depends on your comprehension about the Truth of Godly Way. How far you can go and whether you can live or not depend on your own ability. You can wait here if you don't comprehend any Truth of Godly Way."</p>

  <p>'The comprehension of Truth of Godly Way!'</p>

  <p>Zheng thought, his eyes flashing.</p>

  <p>Since the Sword Clan regarded this place as the debate venue, it was impossible for warriors to conquer it with their own strength, just like they had done in the forbidden areas.</p>

  <p>Did one have to rely on the comprehension of Truth of Godly Way in the end?</p>

  <p>But there were different ways of using the Truth of Godly Way. For example, the Truth of Cultivation Nature was completely different from the Truth of Dark and Light Chaos.</p>

  <p>And the Truth of Goodwill and Malice was yet another.</p>

  <p>Zheng wondered why the skeleton had set up the debate venue like this.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, please wait here," Yan said, blinking her eyes. "I will go ahead on the remaining path."</p>

  <p>Harold had already shared some news with Yan before she came to the Sword Clan. It was obvious that she thought her brother wasn't qualified enough to continue to fight in the debate venue.</p>

  <p>"Why can't I go in?" Zheng asked with an amused smile.</p>

  <p>Yan thought for a while and then whispered, "Because we need a very deep understanding of Truth of Godly Way. Or you could get hurt easily."</p>

  <p>"A very deep understanding? How deeply will I need to understand the Truth of Godly Way?" Zheng asked again.</p>

  <p>"Um..."</p>

  <p>Yan was at a loss for words.</p>

  <p>No one had obtained the skeleton's inheritance in the debate venue.</p>

  <p>All those who had previously entered the place had failed.</p>

  <p>Even Yan did not have enough confidence. What if the skeleton demanded a warrior having a complete comprehension of a Truth of Godly Way?</p>

  <p>"I've learned a lot about the Truth of Godly Way in the fairy palace," Zheng said suddenly, smiling at Yan. "Maybe my comprehension of Truth of Godly Way is not as deep as yours, but I don't think there should be a problem for me to enter it."</p>

  <p>He was pretty confident as he spoke, but he was still curious.</p>

  <p>There was more than one Truth of Godly Way. If one mastered a Truth of Godly Way, could they be recognized by another Truth of Godly Way? Zheng didn't think so.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, have you also cultivated a Truth of Godly Way?" Yan looked at Zheng, doubt marring her face.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded and said, "Don't worry. I won't be reckless."</p>

  <p>Seeing that Zheng was determined to enter this place, Yan knew that she couldn't stop him now.</p>

  <p>She could do nothing but sigh. "Stick close by me. I will try my best to protect you," she said to Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Yes!" Zheng nodded with a smile.</p>

  <p>Reinhard and the other True Gods had already crossed the line.</p>

  <p>Zheng and Yan also moved forward to cross the line.</p>

  <p>The moment he crossed the threshold, Zheng immediately felt a complex aura surround him.</p>

  <p>A strong rhythm hummed within it, as if two different auras had come together and intertwined.</p>

  <p>'A combination of the Truth of Goodwill and the Truth of Malice is suddenly so beautiful!' Zheng thought, slightly stunned.</p>

  <p>The Truth of Malice was causing Zheng's killing intent to surge. In the next moment, the Truth of Goodwill destroyed all malicious intentions.</p>

  <p>It was a wonderfully complex feeling when these two different aspects of the Truth of Godly Way were repeating this process.</p>

  <p>At the beginning, nobody was used to seeing this. Some True Gods had become so uncomfortable that they were beginning to turn red at the effort of keeping it together. They were being greatly influenced by the Truth of Goodwill and Malice, suffering severe headaches and violent mood swings.</p>

  <p>And if they didn't get used to it quickly, their willpower would be destroyed beyond repair.</p>

  <p>Yan was the first one to get used to it.</p>

  <p>And that was because she didn't need time to get used to it.</p>

  <p>When the Truth of Malice came at her, the purple light in her eyes bloomed.</p>

  <p>As the Truth of Goodwill came to her, the purple light in her eyes began to dissipate.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, can you get used to it?" Yan turned to look at Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng closed his eyes and felt the intense fluctuation in his mind.</p>

  <p>'Truth of Cultivation Nature...</p>

  <p>All the Godly Ways originated from nature...'</p>

  <p>The Truth of Goodwill and Malice would allow one to turn their idea into the Truth of Goodwill and the Truth of Malice.</p>

  <p>Faced with the constantly changing Truth of Goodwill and Truth of Malice that affected his state of mind, Zheng also activated the Truth of Cultivation Nature.</p>

  <p>He did not resist this. Instead, he acted according to his will, and obeyed it as it came.</p>

  <p>By the time he opened his eyes again, he had returned to normalcy.</p>

  <p>"How did you get used to it so soon?" Yan asked, astonished. Her eyes were shimmering with curiosity.</p>

  <p>It wasn't easy to adapt once the Truth of Goodwill and the Truth of Malice had come together. She hadn't expected her brother to follow her so easily.</p>
