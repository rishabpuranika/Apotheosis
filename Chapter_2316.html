  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng continued to stare at the mass of chaotic energy that was spinning slowly for a long time.</p>

  <p>As the energy continuously spun, the Secret Time Room's light, that was earlier flickering faintly, slowly became brighter. But apart from that, everything else around was still gray.</p>

  <p>"Is this really the beginning of the divine land?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was also very curious about the origin of the divine land. He had limited understanding about its source.</p>

  <p>To be honest, there were many True Gods, who did not even give a slight thought on the origin of the divine land. Maybe because they rarely paid attention to things outside of the divine land.</p>

  <p>However, after Luo Zheng created a mini divine land that was extremely similar to the actual divine land, his mind was full of questions. He kept wondering whether the divine land had been created by some powerful master or even by an extraordinary creature, earlier mentioned by Holy Jay.</p>

  <p>Under Luo Zheng's non-stop gaze, the chaotic energy became denser and was spinning even faster. At the same time, the chaotic energy was condensing towards the center to form a core.</p>

  <p>Just then, an indistinct shape of axe appeared.</p>

  <p>"Axe?" Luo Zheng's eyes narrowed.</p>

  <p>It was said that the Creating Axe was used to hack through the divine land. But this so called myth had appeared at the opening of the divine land, and the Creating Axe had been disseminated into pieces a few days after the divine land had been cut open. That was why there were numerous doubts about the existence of the Creating Axe.</p>

  <p>"Hooo..."</p>

  <p>A hand appeared from the darkness.</p>

  <p>The white hand looked delicate and smooth. And it was devoid of any sort of any wrinkles, right from the palm to the finger tips.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the hand grabbed the Creating Axe and started cutting towards the "core" rapidly.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>With a loud bang, a blazing light shot out. The light was so bright that Luo Zheng was unable to open his eyes. His ears were buzzing, and his heart was thumping quickly.</p>

  <p>In the Secret Time Room, what he saw was only the past, but it still shook him to see the sight. He could only imagine how terrifying it would have been, when the Creating Axe split the core.</p>

  <p>When the light dimmed, Luo Zheng looked over again, only to find that the core was not cut in half. Instead, there was only a small crack on the surface of it. He couldn't believe that the axe hadn't even split the core into two parts!</p>

  <p>The delicate hand once again heaved the Creating Axe and smashed the core with more intensity.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>It was not until the Creating Axe smashed for the third time that a muffled crack sound was heard. The core finally cracked and split.</p>

  <p>Suddenly there was flashing of lightning and clapping of the thunder.</p>

  <p>All the raindrops which were earlier formed from the chaotic energy, went rampant across the world, turning it into an extremely broad world.</p>

  <p>Looking at this vast world, Luo Zheng was sure that this was the creation of the divine land.</p>

  <p>But what use was this picture in the Secret Time Room?</p>

  <p>When others entered the Secret Time Room, they would see a history that could either make them have an epiphany about the constraint on the cultivation method, or the bottleneck in the cultivation base. A certain period of history would always give the epiphany to the True Gods who entered the Time Secret Room.</p>

  <p>However, the scene in front of Luo Zheng's eyes did not cause an epiphany on him. He did not undergo any kind of emotional turmoil.</p>

  <p>After the world unfolded, everything developed in front of Luo Zheng at a rapid speed.</p>

  <p>The heavy rain continued to pour down for a long time and eventually the sea was formed. Then continents and mountains appeared on top of the sea. Within the mountains, green hues transformed into a forest.</p>

  <p>However, the evolution was not much different from that of Luo Zheng's inner world.</p>

  <p>When the world reached a certain extent, everything stopped evolving.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the chaotic sea started to boil.</p>

  <p>When the boiling reached its peak, all the chaotic sea water rose up and turned into huge clouds.</p>

  <p>Soon, a bright and golden sun appeared and quickly rose high.</p>

  <p>The appearance of the clouds gave a familiar feeling to Luo Zheng. The clouds were similar to the Internal Momentum Clouds which formed after he had devoured the mud, but the scene in his inner world was not so spectacular.</p>

  <p>"These are not the Internal Momentum Clouds." Luo Zheng exclaimed. "They are the Boundary Clouds! But how could they be Boundary Clouds?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng narrowed his eyes as he tried to gauge them.</p>

  <p>The cloud spreading in front of his eyes was very similar to the Boundary Cloud that had been formed when he had become a world Lord. So he was even more confused when he saw the similar scene.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng became the world lord in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, Holy Jay had told him that the Boundary Cloud he had condensed contained the aura of the Divine Dao Guide. At that time, Luo Zheng didn't understand what he was talking about. And he had no clue about the Divine Dao Guide.</p>

  <p>However, he had engraved the situation as well as the aura of the Boundary Cloud, firmly in his mind. Hence he had a familiar experience when he saw the clouds forming in front of him.</p>

  <p>Just as he stood there, puzzling over the clouds, a huge tower shadow suddenly reflected from the clouds. At the top of the tower shadow, there loomed a figure along with a dragon shadow.</p>

  <p>"Howl!"</p>

  <p>As the figure pulled out a sword, the dragon shadow got infused into the sword.</p>

  <p>The figure brandished the long sword into the clouds, and it shot out dazzling light in all the directions of the divine land.</p>

  <p>"The Beginning Swordsmanship?" Luo Zheng raised his eyebrows slightly.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng and Tianming fought in the Illusion Battlefield, Tianming's Beginning Swordsmanship had left a deep impression on him. By then, Luo Zheng had already comprehended the essence of it. But the Beginning Swordsmanship was only a pure swordsmanship and it didn't really match with Gods-intimidating Strike. It was because the Emotion Closing Divine Dao pursued the most formidable power, and only one strike could defeat the opponent.</p>

  <p>But the figure's Beginning Swordsmanship was different from that of Tianming's. In other words, the Beginning Swordsmanship played only a small part of the swordsmanship that the figure employed.</p>

  <p>There was tremendous power, every time the figure struck the sword.</p>

  <p>The aura contained in the power was that from the clouds.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>A lone ray of sword light flew out, traveling over thousands of miles and arriving at the edge of the divine land. The edge of the divine land was easily cut open as if it was mere cloth.</p>

  <p>The world began to expand.</p>

  <p>One sword strike...</p>

  <p>One hundred sword strikes...</p>

  <p>Ten thousand sword strikes...</p>

  <p>One hundred thousand sword strikes...</p>

  <p>As the sword continued to strike, the divine land continued to expand endlessly. Luo Zheng watched the whole scene transform from beginning to end.</p>

  <p>Splash...</p>

  <p>Soon after, the rain poured down from the Boundary Clouds. This time, the raindrops were not brown, but pure and crystal clear. There was no true chaotic energy in the divine land after all, and this was different from Luo Zheng's inner world.</p>

  <p>The creatures in Luo Zheng's inner world were not afraid of the chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>In fact, the chaotic sea had never experienced such a process of transformation.</p>

  <p>As the figure slowly dissipated, Luo Zheng closed his eyes, remembering every detail of the figure's swordsmanship.</p>

  <p>The figure had slashed out one hundred thousand sword strikes.</p>

  <p>But there were only thirteen sword moves in total.</p>

  <p>'Every move of the thirteen is so effortlessly powerful. No one in the divine land would be able to display such amazing moves. The aura contained in the sword moves is very complicated, but I can somehow comprehend it. It is actually a mix of the hundreds of Divine Dao' internal momentum!</p>

  <p>The so-called Divine Dao Guide is the combination of three thousand Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>It turns out that my father gave me the Infinity Ruler, only because it can help me absorb three thousand Divine Dao. It is the most convenient and simplest method. But even so, it's very difficult to collect all of the three thousand Divine Dao!' Luo Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>After figuring out the use of the Infinity Ruler, Luo Zheng had more or less understood the working of it. However, he wasn't sure what would happen after the Infinity Ruler sucked in all of the Divine Dao. But after he saw the scene in the Secret Time Room, he understood the whole meaning of it.</p>
