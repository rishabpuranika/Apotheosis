  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Evil God had become the captain but he didn't care about the members of the Black Ship departing.</p>

  <p>Finally, there were only two people left in the Black Ship.</p>

  <p>One was the former captain of the Black Ship, and the other was Shera.</p>

  <p>Shera opened the door of the cabin, her gaze falling on the Evil God, who was sitting at the stern. She walked over to him with a smile on her face.</p>

  <p>She wrapped her pale, slender arms around the Evil God's neck. "I have brought you a gift from the Other Shore."</p>

  <p>"Let me have a look," said the Evil God.</p>

  <p>Shera began to take out the Other Shore Token, which was in the form of an exquisite pot.</p>

  <p>This was a good Other Shore Token, but it wasn't suited to Shera.</p>

  <p>"What's the use of this Other Shore Token?" the Evil God asked.</p>

  <p>Nobody could figure out the functions of many Other Shore Tokens in a single glance. But those with a rich experience could tell the functions according to the aura.</p>

  <p>A few Other Shore Tokens of the mysterious type had uniquely powerful abilities, while some Other Shore Tokens of the strengthening type emitted a formidable power.</p>

  <p>"It is used to store things," Shera replied.</p>

  <p>It was now the Evil God's turn to be surprised.</p>

  <p>"Is it really just a pot?" the Evil God asked, his eyebrows raising.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Shera, smiling in amusement.</p>

  <p>The pot was strictly a spatial Other Shore Token, but it wasn't considered to be powerful.</p>

  <p>Shera had obtained and kept the pot just to help the Grandmaster of Heaven transmit what was within it. Under normal circumstances, it would be impossible for her to fuse with this Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>"What's in the pot?" the Evil God asked again.</p>

  <p>Shera opened the mouth of the pot, and a pale yellow energy emerged from it.</p>

  <p>The Evil God observed the pale yellow energy, his eyes widening with every second. "The Godly Way energy?" he exclaimed in disbelief.</p>

  <p>He was sensitive to the Godly Way energy and could, in a matter of seconds, tell that this pale yellow energy was the Godly Way energy.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it's the energy of the Godly Way that was isolated from the others by the Element Spirit Civilization. It doesn't have a name yet. You can give it one," Shera suggested.</p>

  <p>"I'm not interested."</p>

  <p>The Evil God's eyes were fixed on the Godly Way energy that was floating in the air. He took a deep breath, causing the Godly Way energy to enter his body through his nose. He then pushed Shera away.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to cultivate in seclusion. Don't disturb me during this time," said the Evil God.</p>

  <p>Shera looked displeased, but she held herself back as she said, "The Grandmaster of Heaven also asked me to pass on a message to you."</p>

  <p>"What is it?" the Evil God said impatiently.</p>

  <p>Neither Shera nor the previous captain was worth a mention, according to the Evil God.</p>

  <p>But the Grandmaster of Heaven was still useful to him.</p>

  <p>"After fusing with this Godly Way, drive the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race out of the Source World," Shera said.</p>

  <p>The Evil God's eyes narrowed. "Is that an order or a request?"</p>

  <p>Shera was silent for a moment. "It is a request."</p>

  <p>"Okay."</p>

  <p>Shera turned and left, sighing inwardly as she returned to her cabin.</p>

  <p>The former captain's calm face appeared on an old board in the cabin.</p>

  <p>"You should have expected this from the first day, right?" the captain said.</p>

  <p>Shera shook her head. "No."</p>

  <p>"There's no need to lie to yourself. The Grandmaster of Heaven, his disciples, you, and me-all of us knew this." The captain looked up at the deck and added, "The Evil God himself knows it too."</p>

  <p>It was true. The Evil God didn't have any feelings or emotions. He would be patient only when he found something that would be useful to him.</p>

  <p>In fact, the Evil God was not interested in being the captain of the Black Ship. The reason why he had stayed in the Black Ship was because of the Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>"But we need him more. He is almost a perfect man," the captain said. "We will try our best to help him and even sacrifice ourselves if need be."</p>

  <p>The Black Ship was a force that was supported by the Nihility race in the chaos, and the Evil God was their hope.</p>

  <p>The Evil God had become happy when he had obtained the last Godly Way.</p>

  <p>The moment Shera left, his figure disappeared in a flash and appeared in a cabin on the black ship.</p>

  <p>He looked up at the wall from where a pair of eyes was staring at him.</p>

  <p>"Go on. Gaze at me if that's what you like!" he sneered, laughing disdainfully.</p>

  <p>He knew that the former captain was observing him all the time.</p>

  <p>And then, wisps of Godly Way energy surged out and began to gather together.</p>

  <p>The three thousand Godly Ways began to merge, one after the other. It was obviously difficult for them to not reject each other and to arrange themselves in a regular, stable manner.</p>

  <p>But the energy of these Godly Ways seemed to have souls, coming to life in the hands of the Evil God.</p>

  <p>Every Godly Way could quickly find a suitable object to fuse with.</p>

  <p>The Evil God had practiced this fusion process a number of times before.</p>

  <p>Every extra energy was a test to the Evil God. When the 3, 001st Godly Way had merged with the others last time, it had brought great difficulty upon the Evil God.</p>

  <p>And now, fusing the last Godly Way was a new challenge for the Evil God.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>A colorful ball of energy floated before him.</p>

  <p>The 3, 001 Godly Ways formed this energy ball. The energy of all the Godly Ways clung to each other and connected together, forming a subtle balance that allowed them to float.</p>

  <p>If any Godly Way was added to or removed from this, the balance would be broken and the ball would instantly collapse.</p>

  <p>The Evil God observed the ball carefully, trying to find a gap in it. But he had spent a lot of effort to fuse the 3, 001 Godly Ways. How could there be a gap in the ball of the Ways-blending Energy?</p>

  <p>He thought for a long time.</p>

  <p>A thought seemed to suddenly occur to him and he pulled out a Godly Way from the Ways-blending Energy.</p>

  <p>The Evil God had drawn out the Five Elements Godly Way.</p>

  <p>As the most extensive and common Godly Way, the Five Elements Godly Way was the foundation of the Ways-blending Energy.</p>

  <p>Once the Five Elements Godly Way was extracted, the entire Ways-blending Energy would have to be reconstructed.</p>

  <p>The Evil God had incomparable talent in terms of the Ways-blending Energy. He could come to a conclusion and make a judgment only after he observed this ball for a while.</p>

  <p>He knew he must do that!</p>

  <p>After he had extracted the Five Elements Godly Way, the 3, 000 Godly Ways were pushed into disorder, and a strong aura of energy began to spread out.</p>

  <p>Seeing that the Ways-blending Energy was about to explode, the Evil God reached out a hand and began to extract the energy. The Godly Way energy turned into thin threads and wove together continuously. In the end, the Evil God had forcefully covered the aura of the energy.</p>

  <p>The former captain watched the scene from the wall.</p>

  <p>He couldn't help but sigh.</p>

  <p>This kind of talent and method of controlling energy was terrifyingly powerful. The experienced captain was forced to look on in admiration.</p>

  <p>Once the Evil God had stabilized the Ways-blending Energy, he put the Five Elements Godly Way back again.</p>

  <p>From its appearance, there was no change in the Ways-blending Energy, but the overall structure had, in fact, undergone a tremendous change.</p>

  <p>And now, there was a gap in the ball.</p>

  <p>This gap was left for the energy of the last Godly Way.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The Evil God once again released the Godly Way energy and slowly inserted it into the gap.</p>

  <p>The Godly Way energy and the Ways-blending Energy were now almost perfectly matched.</p>

  <p>The Evil God had just begun to smile when the Ways-blending Energy suddenly turned into a snow-white ball.</p>

  <p>The light ball covered the ship with the light in the blink of an eye and began to flash on the surface of the lake.</p>

  <p>The ball's light was so brilliant that the whole world seemed dark as night before it.</p>
