<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng pulled Abby back, there was a fresh bloody wound on her forehead and her face was deathly pale.</p>

  <p>If it wasn't for Luo Luo Zheng pulling her, her head would've already been separated from her body.</p>

  <p>The Demon Night members present looked at each other in absolute dismay. The person hiding inside had to be Supreme Lord Leroy.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Leroy, on the other hand, was very vigilant, and therefore, they couldn't even get close to him.</p>

  <p>"What should we do?" Abby wiped the wound on her forehead before tying a ribbon to it, in order to stop the bleeding.</p>

  <p>Minutes before, she had made the effort to identify herself, but Supreme Lord Leroy had still attacked her. Would he allow anyone to get close?</p>

  <p>"Let me deal with him," Luo Luo Zheng said flatly.</p>

  <p>"But it's too dangerous."</p>

  <p>Abby thought that her cultivation level was higher than Luo Zheng's, and so was her strength. If even she was almost killed by the Scorching Sun Arrow, then there was no way Luo Luo Zheng would survive. He would certainly place himself in great danger if he chose to fight.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled noncommittally and headed toward the corner.</p>

  <p>The Demon Night members in the rear all opened their eyes wide as they watched Luo Luo Zheng, greatly worried about him. They had chosen to follow Luo Luo Zheng and had ultimately found Supreme Lord Leroy, but Luo Luo Zheng didn't deserve to be killed by him. Not right now, at least.</p>

  <p>Only Amber's gaze remained as calm as usual. She was confident in Luo Luo Zheng, because she knew what kind of person he was. He would never act rashly. If he had decided to make a move, then he must know what he was doing.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng slowly approached the corner. The moment he neared it, his footsteps suddenly quickened and his speed increased explosively.</p>

  <p>His physical strength now reached a point where it was much more powerful than before. Moreover, he was also wearing the Redemption Armor made from the source of the Godly Tile. It wouldn't be too difficult for him to block the Scorching Sun Arrow.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Accompanied by a giant gust of wind, a golden light flashed across Luo Zheng's eyes.</p>

  <p>The speed of the arrow was simply too fast. Even Luo Luo Zheng couldn't react in time. Through instinct, he protected his head, which was the only thing he managed to do.</p>

  <p>After all, his entire body was wrapped in the Redemption Armor, and only his head was exposed. He didn't want his head to be hit by the Scorching Sun Arrow!</p>

  <p>Clap!</p>

  <p>While Luo Luo Zheng held both arms up in order to protect his head, a heavy blow suddenly came for his body. It was as if a sludge hammer had struck him, and his entire body heavily crashed into the side of the cave.</p>

  <p>The arrow was aimed straight at his chest!</p>

  <p>Luckily though, just as Holy Drew had said, the Redemption Armor couldn't be destroyed as it was forged with the source of the Godly Tile.</p>

  <p>The terrifying power contained within the arrow only sent Luo Luo Zheng flying a few hundred feet away.</p>

  <p>With a roll, Luo Luo Zheng stood back up, and set his feet firmly on the ground.</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>A puzzled voice came from somewhere in the darkness.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, now standing, wanted to open his mouth to speak, but he saw two golden lights flash in the distance once again.</p>

  <p>"Supreme..."</p>

  <p>Clap! Clap!</p>

  <p>Another two crisp sounds could be heard echoing through the cave.</p>

  <p>Two Scorching Sun Arrows flashed with golden lights and hit Luo Zheng's Redemption Armor. The golden arrowheads then shattered to pieces. The huge force pushed Luo Luo Zheng back another hundred feet away. As he ferociously hit the wall of the cave, everything began to shake and crumble.</p>

  <p>These arrows had been shot before he even had the chance to utter a sound. And now, he couldn't help but feel the burning sensation overwhelming his heart.</p>

  <p>Just as he broke free from the cave wall, a sword miraculously appeared in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Great Weighty Sword!"</p>

  <p>"Break!"</p>

  <p>He brandished his Great Weighty Sword. This heavy sword, comparable to a great world, felt abnormally light in Luo Zheng's hands.</p>

  <p>After the Great Weighty Sword drew an arc in the air, the sword's glow accurately and perfectly intersected with the two golden lights.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>With two crisp sounds, Luo Luo Zheng actually succeeded in shattering the two Scorching Sun Arrows.</p>

  <p>"What the hell?!"</p>

  <p>Another surprised voice came from the darkness.</p>

  <p>The Demon Night members hiding on the other side had expressions of disbelief etched on their faces, their eyes wide with awe.</p>

  <p>Abby, the grand world lord, also had her eyes open wide with surprise.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng waved the Great Weighty Sword in his hand. When he noticed the Demon Night members' expressions, his lips curled up with disapproval.</p>

  <p>He had just shattered two Scorching Sun Arrows. Why were they so surprised about that?</p>

  <p>The truth was, Luo Luo Zheng didn't know that Supreme Lord Leroy had gained popularity through his fearsome arrows.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords in the universe all had different weapons, but Supreme Lord Leroy was the only one who used arrows as his main weapons.</p>

  <p>The arrows couldn't unleash martial artists' full strength, so even if certain world lords or Supreme Lords were proficient in archery, they only used arrows as their support.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Destiny that Supreme Lord Leroy bore was called the Fixed Vision token. This kind of token contained a type of extremely powerful Law of Causality. With the Law of Causality, the arrows he shot wouldn't follow the Space Law. As long as the targets were within his range of vision, the arrows were guaranteed to hit them.</p>

  <p>If Supreme Lord Leroy was capable of seeing all the way to the other side of the universe, then the arrows he shot would be able to cross the infinite distance and hit his target exactly where he planned to. Clearly, this explained why the Fixed Vision token was terrifying.</p>

  <p>Throughout the entire Evolutionary Universe, no one could stop his arrows, not even the human top-rank Supreme Lords!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng and Abby had dodged the first and second arrows because they had hidden themselves in the corner and had escaped from Supreme Lord Leroy's sight. But now, Luo Luo Zheng was in his plain view.</p>

  <p>With a single wave of his sword, Luo Luo Zheng was capable of shattering two of Supreme Lord Leroy's Scorching Sun Arrows. This was simply unimaginable.</p>

  <p>In a certain way, it was possible to say that Luo Luo Zheng had broken the Law of Causality contained in the Fixed Vision token. Or rather, he had broken the Law of Causality of this universe.</p>

  <p>He held his Great Weighty Sword horizontally in front of his chest and shouted into the darkness, "Supreme Lord Leroy, I'm  Luo Luo Zheng Luo. I... Shit!"</p>

  <p>Seeing two golden lights flashing in front of him, Luo Luo Zheng turned around and pulled the Great Weighty Sword he held in his hand. The long sword danced in the air and once again, accurately shattered the two Scorching Sun Arrows sent by Leroy.</p>

  <p>Now, Luo Luo Zheng was starting to get impatient. Supreme Lord Leroy was hiding in the darkness for no reason, and just kept shooting arrows at him.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>With the Great Weighty Sword in his hand, Luo Zheng's figure began rapidly charging forward into the darkness.</p>

  <p>Whenever a golden light flashed out from his pitch-black surroundings, Luo Zheng's Great Weighty Sword was capable of instantly capturing its trajectory and hack it into multiple pieces.</p>

  <p>Finally, Luo Luo Zheng sprinted forward one last time, his Great Weighty Sword slicing through the air and pressing down on Supreme Lord Leroy's neck.</p>

  <p>"Supreme Lord Leroy, I didn't mean to offend you. I am..."</p>

  <p>"You're  Luo Luo Zheng Luo. I know you," an old voice sounded from the darkness.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the light gradually brightened, revealing a lonely and rather thin old man.</p>

  <p>The old man sat on a stone bed and held a longbow in his hand. He looked like someone who was playing a zither, but his eyes were abnormally calm.</p>

  <p>Although he appeared very old, his eyes were very clear, and he had a set of determined eagle eyes.</p>

  <p>"Since you know who I am, why did you..." Luo Luo Zheng trailed off.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Leroy smiled and placed his longbow to the side. Luo Luo Zheng also placed his Great Weighty Sword back into its scabbard. After all, the heavy weight of the weapon in his hand was a burden to him.</p>

  <p>"I'm very curious. How did you shatter my arrows?" Supreme Lord Leroy asked, as he looked at Luo Luo Zheng questioningly.</p>

  <p>Ever since he bore the Heavenly Destiny, no one had been able to avoid his arrows, at least not as far as his eyes could reach. Because of the Law of Causality, when he looked directly at his opponents, it became impossible for them to dodge his attack. Of course, this reality was one of the reasons why the Law of Causality was so frightening. Nothing could happen without a cause.</p>

  <p>Although the Scorching Sun Arrow wasn't Supreme Lord Leroy's strongest archery skill, the Law of Causality couldn't be violated.</p>

  <p>Therefore, he was surprised to see Luo Luo Zheng smash his arrows to pieces.</p>

  <p>Hearing the conversation between Luo Luo Zheng and Supreme Lord Leroy, the Demon Night members hiding in the far corner began creeping out of the shadows.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Leroy's gaze was focused on Luo Luo Zheng. "Can you tell me how you managed that, please?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng cupped his hands. "I'm afraid I can't because there are a few secrets involved."</p>

  <p>In fact, Luo Luo Zheng hadn't broken the Law of Causality contained within the Fixed Vision token. He used another method to shatter Supreme Lord Leroy's Scorching Sun Arrows, and that was nothing other than the worlds' will and memories.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng knew everything. Before Supreme Lord Leroy had even raised his hand, Luo Luo Zheng had already known when he would shoot his arrow and what the target would be.</p>

  <p>With this kind of magical foresight, he could swing his sword ahead of time and shatter Supreme Lord Leroy's Scorching Sun Arrows as they came for him.</p>
