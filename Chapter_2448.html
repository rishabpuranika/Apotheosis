  <p>No one knew what powerful incarnations of fears were waiting for them, apart from the Multiple Antennae Snake? Enoch's incarnation of fear.</p>

  <p>Although each of the True Gods had used the Truth of Divine Dao to create a powerful avatar, these avatars did little to give them a sense of security.</p>

  <p>"Reinhard, I think we should just quit now, before it's too late," asked one of the disciples of the wealthy clans on the Floating Islands. He was not the only one with that thought; many other True Gods had made up their mind to retreat.</p>

  <p>It was not that these True Gods were cowards. In fact, their resolve had not waivered since the start.</p>

  <p>After all, a True God who was qualified to participate in the debate would be of the top talents of the divine land. This sort of qualification wasn't easy to obtain, and was certainly not for the fearful or timid. No one was willing to give up so easily.</p>

  <p>The one who succeeded in gaining true ownership of the inheritance of the skeleton would be bestowed with a great honor, for themselves and for their clan.</p>

  <p>These True Gods were the hopes of their clans.</p>

  <p>But now, their situation was desperate.</p>

  <p>The Multiple Antennae Snake was a famous ferocious beast in the remote ages and was recorded in many ancient books.</p>

  <p>But there was more. It seemed as though encountering the legendary beast was not the only fear in the hearts of the True Gods. And no one could guess what those fears were.</p>

  <p>Usually, even the chance of winning was one in a million, these True Gods would take that chance and fight for the inheritance.</p>

  <p>Now, however, it seemed that the odds were completely against them. It was as if they knew that defeat was inevitable and certain. That fighting was an exercise in futility.</p>

  <p>Reinhard, however, looked disgusted. He took a long look at the True Gods who had just expressed their desire to quit, and laughed. "You can go back now."</p>

  <p>"Really? Then what are we waiting for?"</p>

  <p>"We'll retreat!"</p>

  <p>"We can go back along the same route. Everybody, as long as we work together? "</p>

  <p>"I haven't finished," said Reinhard. He did not shout, but his deep voice exuded a menacing authority that made everyone fall silent at once. "If you want to quit, you can go back by yourselves, and never show your faces among us again. None of our Sword Clan members will quit. Besides, the incarnations of fears have already been in the mist. I'm afraid you will die a much more miserable death on the way back. As for your choice, it's up to you." With these words, he raised his hand, still grasping the trembling Tribulation Exterminating Sword. It was constantly vibrating in all directions? east, west, south and north. This only meant one thing: the incarnations of fears had surrounded them completely.</p>

  <p>Everyone was silent as they stared at the Tribulation Exterminating Sword in Reinhard's hand.</p>

  <p>Obviously, Reinhard was the backbone of the team. Without him, there was no doubt that they were unlikely to survive for long if they chose to go back by themselves.</p>

  <p>"Let's go. Maybe we will still have a chance of survival if we move forward," Reinhard said. looking at Luo Zheng and Yan. "Our Sword Clan has participated in the debate countless times, but no one has an avatar as powerful as yours, Luo Zheng. The situation is not as bad as you might think."</p>

  <p>Hearing his words, the crowd locked their eyes on Luo Zheng and his avatar again.</p>

  <p>They knew Luo Zheng's avatar was extraordinary, but they couldn't even begin to fathom how powerful it was.</p>

  <p>Reinhard grasped the Tribulation Exterminating Sword firmly in his hand and led the members of the Sword Clan forward.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and Yan followed without a word.</p>

  <p>Enoch kept throwing furtive glances at the True Gods, afraid that they would take their anger out on him and beat him, so he shuffled forward sheepishly, catching up with Luo Zheng and Yan.</p>

  <p>In the team, there was a short True God whose eyes were no larger than two soya beans, black and glistening. He stared at the mist in the distance with his bean-sized eyes. As he observed, a hint of a smile formed at the corners of his lips.</p>

  <p>This True God was rather inconspicuous. No one paid attention to him. If he were to suddenly disappear, no one would even notice.</p>

  <p>When the group had fallen from the top of the Sunrest Tree, he had correctly told the others the number of True Gods who had died because of the explosion of their elixir fields.</p>

  <p>His avatar, too, was very good, only a tad weaker than the one summoned by Reinhard. If this had been a debate like the ones before, he would have surely attracted attention. But this time, he was overshadowed by Yan and Luo Zheng. Nobody noticed him.</p>

  <p>The other True Gods, though very conflicted, knew that death was almost certain if they split from the group and retreated. The only rational choice was to bite the bullet and go ahead.</p>

  <p>Duke took a milky white pill out of his pocket and threw it to Gage. His eyes on Enoch's back, he sneered, "I didn't expect that a Multiple Antennae Snake would appear. The world is so big and full of wonders! But even the Multiple Antennae Snake is nothing compared with that thing that is waiting for them!"</p>

  <p>Even in the midst of the mist, Reinhard still knew the way.</p>

  <p>The debate venue was an open and curved space. The farther they walked in one direction, the narrower it became.</p>

  <p>Although the Tribulation Exterminating Sword in Reinhard's hand was trembling fiercely, the journey went on smoothly, contrary to their expectations.</p>

  <p>However, this lack of obstacles was not calming to the True Gods. They were all experienced warriors, and they knew very well that this kind of calm was abnormal. Could it be a trap?</p>

  <p>After they walked over a hundred miles, the Tribulation Exterminating Sword in Reinhard's hand suddenly pointed straight ahead.</p>

  <p>"Watch out! There must be something in front of us!"</p>

  <p>Reinhard yelled.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Over ten of the True Gods' avatars quickly moved to the front.</p>

  <p>These avatars could not be destroyed, and the Sword Clan disciples were trained sufficiently to be able to manipulate their own avatars to rush forward, obeying them at their first command.</p>

  <p>Roar!</p>

  <p>A tall figure suddenly burst out of the thick mist in front of them.</p>

  <p>It was a giant white rhinoceros!</p>

  <p>The most eye-catching part of the giant rhinoceros was its huge horn.</p>

  <p>Above the horn, the purple lightning turned into numerous concentric thunder rings that continued rotating hypnotically. Each time it took a step, its claw left a lightning footprint on the ground. It was as fast as a thunderbolt.</p>

  <p>No one know where the giant rhinoceros had been hiding before it emerged.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, it rolled out like a landslide, accompanied by the continuous cracking of the thunder rings on its horn.</p>

  <p>"Go away!"</p>

  <p>Reinhard barked.</p>

  <p>In an instant, the Sword Clan disciples in front divided into two groups, standing on either side.</p>

  <p>"It's the Giant Thunder Rhinoceros!"</p>

  <p>"It's a fifth-grade ferocious beast of the Everest Spirit Mountain!"</p>

  <p>"Whose incarnation of fear is this?"</p>

  <p>"I don't care! What does it matter whose incarnation it is? Run! Don't fight this thing head on. If it gets angry, it can pierce a hole in a mountain!"</p>

  <p>As soon as the disciples of the Sword Clan had moved away, the True Gods quickly made way for the Giant Thunder Rhinoceros.</p>

  <p>The Giant Thunder Rhinoceros was indeed fierce.</p>

  <p>However, despite its brute strength and temperament, it was not very intelligent. It was famous for being impulsive and hot-headed. On one occasion, when a True God had provoked a Giant Thunder Rhinoceros, it had run through hundreds of mountains in the Everest Spirit Mountain to chase after that True God.</p>

  <p>"Let's go. Don't fight the rhinoceros head on," Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng also wanted to test the power of his avatar, judging by the size and speed of the Giant Thunder Rhinoceros, he realized it was not the occasion to do so.</p>

  <p>Yan, however, did not follow Luo Zheng. She simply smiled, standing still.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?" Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"Have you forgotten how long I have been in the Everest Spirit Mountain?</p>

  <p>A long time, I tell you. I know how to deal with it. I know the right way,"</p>

  <p>Yan said calmly.</p>

  <p>Although Yan rarely fought with the True Gods or got involved in life or death battles, she had been trained extensively in the Everest Spirit Mountain.</p>

  <p>After Harold had taken control of the Everest Spirit Mountain, Yan was able to move freely in the forbidden area.</p>

  <p>She had no concern for the Black Mountain Ghost Monkey or the Heavenly Eye Snake. She knew their weaknesses well.</p>

  <p>Of course, the Giant Thunder Rhinoceros was no exception.</p>

  <p>Even though the Giant Thunder Rhinoceros was fierce and terrifying, Yan understood that it had a weak spot, just like all the other monsters.</p>

  <p>"Why are you still here? Keep away from it!"</p>

  <p>Reinhard had moved a long distance away by now. But then, he noticed that Luo Zheng and Yan hadn't followed. Not only had they not moved an inch, but they were also standing dangerously close to the Giant Thunder Rhinoceros.</p>

  <p>'Facing a mountain-like Giant Thunder Rhinoceros on her own? Just with her tiny body? Seriously?' he thought.</p>

  <p>By the time his thoughts had trailed off, the Giant Thunder Rhinoceros had already crossed the short distance between itself and Yan. The giant beast and the petite girl now stood face to face.</p>
