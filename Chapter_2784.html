  <p>
</p>

  <p>Sword Chen had wielded the Scorching Gold which emitted a radiant light, so he didn't worry about the unknown creatures that lurked in the black mist.</p>

  <p>The others, on the contrary, weren't as lucky.</p>

  <p>The black mist seeped in from everywhere and obstructed all the light sources. Everyone was enveloped by the darkness.</p>

  <p>"It's so dark that I can't even see my own hand in front of me."</p>

  <p>"What's this?"</p>

  <p>"Something is in the darkness!"</p>

  <p>Fear immediately gripped the consummate True Gods and Demi-holy Beings.</p>

  <p>They all felt that there was something that circled around their group in the darkness. The chill of the ice palace did not help, as it was extreme to the point that their backs were wet with cold sweat.</p>

  <p>"Disperse the black mist!" one of the Demi-holy Beings yelled as a dazzling light flashed from his fingertip.</p>

  <p>The dazzling light had usually blinded ordinary people were they in a place somewhere outside of the ice palace; here, it had no effect at all.</p>

  <p>They only felt the white light flash for a moment before they were engulfed by the darkness again.</p>

  <p>"Fire!" a Holy Being growled.</p>

  <p>This Holy Being was also a master of the Elementary Fire Godly Way. His skills were not as powerful as Clark's, but they were still not something to be trifled with.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh..."</p>

  <p>A torrent of flame shaped like a dragon shot into the air and shone with a bright yellow light.</p>

  <p>Like the previous spell that cast a white light before, the yellow light also disappeared within a few seconds.</p>

  <p>But although they weren't able to see the light, they still heard the sound of the flame as it burned. It meant that the flame had not been extinguished, but something had prevented the light from spreading.</p>

  <p>The Holy Being was frustrated. It was clear that he still controlled the flame and that the flame was just somewhere close by, but why wasn't he able to see it? Not any one of them had figured it out.</p>

  <p>Everyone present were already experienced fighters, but the fear of the unknown unnerved them and affected their sanity bit by bit.</p>

  <p>"They're getting closer and closer!"</p>

  <p>"Kill them!"</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>A piercing scream split the darkness as a glimmer of a sword's blade sliced past. Someone had accidentally hurt one of their companions.</p>

  <p>The group erupted in a state of utter chaos. If they hadn't been able to calm down, it was highly possible that they could have killed each other.</p>

  <p>"Silence!"</p>

  <p>Nicholas' voice suddenly boomed out of nowhere.</p>

  <p>His voice had a trace of irresistible internal momentum, which was an effect of the Great Dominance Technique.</p>

  <p>His natural authority usually gave him control over everything, so it wasn't often that he needed to use this method. But the current situation had spiraled completely out of control, which left him with no choice but to forcefully calm his companions down.</p>

  <p>After his outburst, absolute silence followed.</p>

  <p>The group's impending panic due to fear was suppressed by Nicholas' spiritual power. As their fear was dissipated, they finally calmed down.</p>

  <p>The unknown creatures were still there, and still circled the group quietly in the shadows.</p>

  <p>Nicholas knew that they were there, but he chose to simply ignore them.</p>

  <p>"Follow me, and keep going down!" said Nicholas.</p>

  <p>He was most certain that the woman had some ulterior motive in leading them into this place.</p>

  <p>Even if the darkness of the ice palace was absolute, it was not her style to attack them when they were blinded.</p>

  <p>Further more, they still were able to use their spiritual senses normally.</p>

  <p>Even though their sense of sight had been compromised, they could move freely using their spiritual senses.</p>

  <p>With Nicholas leading them, everyone continued their downward flight.</p>

  <p>When Clark's flame had been blocked by the woman, Nicholas had locked on to her using his spiritual sense.</p>

  <p>His eyes had flashed momentarily with a murderous intent. He silently commanded the others using his life vitality, "If we catch up with the woman, let me capture and restrain her; you can do your worst to her!"</p>

  <p>Actually, Nicholas had also been afraid of the woman and her abilities.</p>

  <p>That didn't mean that he would be scared to go head to head with her in combat.</p>

  <p>As soon as he increased his speed downward, his eyebrows creased in a frown. His spiritual sense detected that the woman was also descending after them.</p>

  <p>Everyone had trouble adjusting their eyes in the dark surroundings.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the woman had been born in the black water. When she had submerged into the darkness, she was as comfortable as a fish in water.</p>

  <p>"Go ahead, kids. I have enough Faith Energy for all of you. Remember their auras and absorb their power."</p>

  <p>After she spoke, she took a deep breath and blew in the darkness.</p>

  <p>A multitude of formless creatures swarmed in the darkness and swam rapidly into the opposite direction.</p>

  <p>These were "the unknown" that Sword Chen had mentioned previously.</p>

  <p>For the longest time, he had wanted to find out the true forms of these unknown creatures. He believed that they could be visible under the right conditions, but he had never really gotten a definite conclusion.</p>

  <p>In truth, the unknown formless creatures really did not have a corporeal form, as their name suggested.</p>

  <p>But given enough time, provided that they were in the black water, they had the ability to clone a complete object.</p>

  <p>What Sword Chen was not aware of was that these formless creatures had already formed clones of him several times in the past, and these clones had been sent to another world in his place.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the formless creatures created complete copies of the things they had cloned, as opposed to creating phantoms. They had the ability to clone any creature in the divine land as long as they had been provided with a large amount of Faith Energy.</p>

  <p>Not too long ago, the woman had "killed" all the fiends and countless fierce beasts in the Abyss Demon Region in order to collect all the Faith Energy they released. She had intended to use the massive amount of Faith Energy for the formless creatures to clone the group of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>The Abyss Demon Region's Faith Energy was negative, even though it had come from divine citizens and True Gods. In theory, the Faith Energy really belonged to Chiyou as the creator of the divine land.</p>

  <p>Using the Faith Energy for cloning was considered as a form of creation from a certain perspective.</p>

  <p>This had been the explanation for the woman's ability to make an exact clone of Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh..."</p>

  <p>Nicholas led the group as they had flown at an incredibly high speed.</p>

  <p>Tens of thousands of feet was a distance that Holy Beings traveled in the blink of an eye. But the woman's speed was not something to underestimate. She had continuously escaped in the ice palace and she had kept almost neck-to-neck with Nicholas' speed.</p>

  <p>As the distance he flew grew, Nicholas had felt increasingly afraid.</p>

  <p>Besides him, everyone had also felt that they were surrounded on all sides by something invisible.</p>

  <p>But when they reached out with their spiritual senses, they found nothing there.</p>

  <p>The fear of the unknown had blossomed subtly from the bottom of their hearts and had threatened to overwhelm them bit by bit.</p>

  <p>"It's just an artificial illusion. Just ignore it!" said Nicholas.</p>

  <p>He had activated the Great Dominance Technique again. Everyone had calmed down as they heard his majestic voice in their minds, their fear suppressed once again.</p>

  <p>During this process, the formless creatures that had been following them simultaneously changed their shapes quickly.</p>

  <p>Only a few paces behind Nicholas, one of the formless creatures had already started to take on a human shape. In such a short period of time, it had cloned a complete face, and gradually cloned clothes, hair...</p>
