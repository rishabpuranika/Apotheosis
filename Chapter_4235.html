  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Deep Space and the main world were completely different in so many aspects. With Geoffrey's current strength, it would be impossible for him to cross between them.</p>

  <p>"Well…" Zheng looked at the Human Spirit King.</p>

  <p>He didn't even know much about the main world, let alone the Deep Space.</p>

  <p>Noticing this, the Human Spirit King immediately said, "There is a transmission array at the top of the Eternal Divine Courtyard. Through this, one can go to the Deep Space."</p>

  <p>The Four Spirits Sect treated the Deep Space with great importance. They believed that this place was like a vast land that was filled with precious treasures.</p>

  <p>Therefore, they had spent a lot of time, effort, and resources building a transmission array in the Eternal Divine Courtyard that would connect them to the Deep Space. This way, they were able to monopolize the resources that could be found there.</p>

  <p>"The Eternal Divine Courtyard? You mean the courtyard that is chained down?" Geoffrey asked out of curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Indeed," Kincaid replied.</p>

  <p>"But wouldn't it be too difficult to activate such a transmission array?"</p>

  <p>Zheng was a bit worried. After all, it was a transmission array that linked two great worlds.</p>

  <p>"In theory, yes. But you don't have to worry. The energy needed to activate the transmission array is provided by the Time Lock. As long as Geoffrey can successfully climb and enter the top of the Eternal Divine Courtyard, there is no doubt that he can activate the transmission array,"</p>

  <p>Kincaid remarked confidently.</p>

  <p>In the main world, there were so many legacies left behind by the Four Spirits Sect that could last forever, unless the entire main world was fully downgraded.</p>

  <p>Right now, Kincaid was being very patient. He knew that he could not solve this crisis by himself, so he needed to trust and depend on Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>Although Geoffrey was a human with relatively weak strength, currently, he was the only hope that the whole world could cling to.</p>

  <p>Then, Kincaid went on to tell Geoffrey in detail everything that he needed to know about the Deep Space, and what might be waiting for him in that place.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing Kincaid elaborating the details about the Deep Space, Zheng and the others couldn't help but feel amused.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of the people from the third-grade world, the main world would appear that it was composed of countless snow-white dots of light.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, if the people from the main world viewed the Deep Space, they would be able to see a lot of circles floating around. It was inevitable for people from a lower-grade world to see a higher-grade world from a different perspective.</p>

  <p>It took Kincaid about four hours to finish explaining to Geoffrey everything that he needed to know. In the end, Geoffrey just nodded repeatedly before he left.</p>

  <p>"I hope that Geoffrey can make it this time," the Snake Goddess said anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Trust him. He will definitely make it!" Kincaid had a huge smile as he confidently said this. He always ignored the possibility of failure when facing such a great crisis. This was the only way that he could maximize his full potential into solving anything.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng stayed silent. He felt a little guilty that Geoffrey was the one who had to take this huge risk and pressure. But at the same time, he was also deeply rooting for him. Right now, the entire chaos didn't have anything but him to count on. There was no other choice.</p>

  <p>Noticing that everyone had been a little depressed about the situation, Kincaid turned to Tianming with a smile and said, "The power of the Sunlight Annihilation Light is exceptional. Let me teach you how to activate its full potential.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Master Kincaid. Please enlighten me," Tianming immediately responded as he cupped his hands.</p>

  <p>Then, Kincaid took the Lone Sword from Tianming. He gently clenched it, and the patterns on the surface of the sword gradually fluctuated and became brighter, eventually turning into endless energy flowers that bloomed successively.</p>

  <p>"It's not actually difficult to control the Sunlight Annihilation Light. When using its energy, you just have to separately release it, and then merge it into one."</p>

  <p>After explaining this, Kincaid lightly tapped the hilt of the sword.</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish!</p>

  <p>Bright light beams the size of fingers suddenly shot out and flickered into a shape of a gourd before converging together.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>The accumulated sword radiance seemed to become viscous, thus reducing its speed by more than half. But soon after, it transformed into a strange form, splitting into hundreds of beams that shot out through the sky. These beams contained a special law that kept soaring, dazzling everyone who saw them.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, as Kincaid was still teaching Tianming, Geoffrey had already arrived at the edge of the pillar and started crawling along the chain.</p>

  <p>He had trod on the chain of the Time Lock several times before, so he had easily adapted to its terrain.</p>

  <p>About two days later, he finally crossed the chain and was able to climb up to the Eternal Divine Courtyard right in the middle of the four pillars.</p>

  <p>"Hmm, the Human Spirit King said there is a magic array on the roof of the Eternal Divine Courtyard, but I didn't find it before."</p>

  <p>Previously, Geoffrey had been thinking about how he could enter the chained courtyard. After searching for a way in and eventually failing, he gave up exploring it. This time, he went straight to the roof.</p>

  <p>The main hall of the Eternal Divine Courtyard was octagonal in shape, with a circle of protruding tiles in the middle of it. Right after passing the tiles, he saw a platform that was about thirty feet long. At the four corners of this platform, four chains of the Time Lock were fixed.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey observed the platform and the chains for a while. Eventually, he discerned that the transmission array mentioned by the Human Spirit King was most likely to be located on the platform.</p>

  <p>With this, Geoffrey immediately jumped towards the platform. The moment he landed and stood on the platform, the four chains began emitting dark blue lights.</p>

  <p>These lights were like water droplets that flowed along the grooves of the platform. The lights coming from the four corners gradually streamed in the middle, intertwining and merging.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Geoffrey witnessed that the dots of blue light began forming a diamond-shaped array on the ground.</p>

  <p>"Is this the transmission array?" He was engrossed as he watched the formation of the array.</p>

  <p>He was the type of person who was easily amused and was curious about everything. Needless to say, he was deeply intrigued by the Deep Space.</p>

  <p>He wanted to see what a higher-grade world would look like.</p>

  <p>Without any hesitation, Geoffrey immediately stepped in the diamond-shaped array.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the transmission array began to glow even more brightly.</p>

  <p>Then, Geoffrey saw that a beam of light was rising from the array. This beam of light instantly drilled through his arm, leaving a hole the size of a thumb. He noticed that his flesh and bones where the hole appeared had completely vanished.</p>

  <p>"Hey, what's happening?" Geoffrey was startled. He wasn't informed about this.</p>

  <p>But he also realized that he didn't feel any pain even after being drilled by the mysterious beam of light.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>A few more rays of light rose and drilled through his body. Two of them pierced through the soles of his feet, and another one bored through his head.</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute. Is the transmission array going to split me into countless pieces before I get transported?" Geoffrey felt a little scared. This process was a little weird for him. There were holes in his body but he didn't feel any pain.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Eventually, more and more beams of lights rose and created countless holes in his body.</p>

  <p>As the number of holes increased, fewer body parts remained intact. After the lights shot through the remaining parts, Geoffrey's entire body disappeared from the array.</p>

  <p>Then, the same beams of light shot upwards. Geoffrey felt that his body and his consciousness were carried within these lights.</p>

  <p>After a while, the beams of light finally arrived at their destination. Then, they turned into flesh and blood that eventually formed Geoffrey's original body.</p>

  <p>When the beams of light had finished restoring Geoffrey's body, he opened his eyes and looked into the distance.</p>

  <p>Then, he remembered Kincaid's warning. He said that if Geoffrey wouldn't be able to understand the Deep Space, he had to walk to the right all the time.</p>

  <p>Currently, more than half of the Deep Space had already been downgraded, and there were many areas of the main world in it. The nearest area was at the end of the right path.</p>

  <p>When Geoffrey started looking around, the corners of his mouth curled up, and a proud expression appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>He could clearly see the circles that formed the Deep Space. He was finally here, and he had to do everything correctly because everyone's survival depended on him.</p>
