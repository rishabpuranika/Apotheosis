<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 252 The Foolish Young Master (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Oh, really? So tell me how you will cut me into pieces? Where will you start? Here? Or there?" Luo Zheng taunted the attendants. He pulled the young master closer to him and placed his broken flying blade on the latter's throat.</p>

  <p>"Are you insane? Let go of the young master now!" The two servants were furious, but they were careful as they moved closer to their young master.</p>

  <p>Just then, the young master of the Li family realized what was happening and cursed out loud. "Bastard! You release me now and kill yourself with your knife to atone for your mistake! Or else, I will have you and the rest of your family killed!</p>

  <p>The young master hardly finished his words as Luo Zheng slapped him hard across the face.</p>

  <p>"Kill me and my family? Do you even know who I am? And what method will you use to kill me?" asked Luo Zheng in a deadly cold voice as he pushed the knife harder on young master's neck, enough to wound him slightly.</p>

  <p>"How dare you slap me? Even my parents have never hurt me! You're dead! I shall –," the young master threatened even with his bleeding mouth. He was extremely arrogant and relentlessly cruel.</p>

  <p>He could not finish his sentence again because of a short loud sound.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had slapped him again, and harder this time.</p>

  <p>The young master looked at him furiously and was about to say something again, but Luo Zheng slapped him one more time.</p>

  <p>Seeing how their young master was being treated, the two servants held their weapons and attacked Luo Zheng. However, Luo Zheng kicked them one by one and they fell back to the ground.</p>

  <p>After he took care of the two servants, Luo Zheng went back to handle the young master.</p>

  <p>He wasn't really looking for trouble and didn't intend to get involved in such fight. He just wanted the horse.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng continued to slap the young master five or six more times. Finally, the arrogant and vicious local tyrant of G Country knew his place.</p>

  <p>"Will you continue to curse?" asked Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"No, I won't," the young master said in a quivering voice.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled and said, "That's good to hear. You're doing the right thing.</p>

  <p>Actually, I didn't come here to scold you. I just needed one thing from you."</p>

  <p>"What is it?" the young master asked in surprise. He then continued, "I don't even know you!"</p>

  <p>"I want that horse, so I came here to make a deal with you," Luo Zheng said as he pointed at the lightning horse beside them.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" The young master was not willing to sell his favorite horse to anyone or for any amount. As a slacker in the family, he never spent time dealing with any family business matters or cared for anyone but himself. But when he found out about the lightning horse, he dedicated his time and effort in acquiring the horse and since that day, he never wanted to depart from it.</p>

  <p>But when he remembered how hard and painful Zheng's slaps were, the young master became scared. He was caught in a dilemma and it had shown in his face.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter? Don't you want to sell it?" Zheng's voice suddenly turned cold.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I do. I'll sell it to you." Sensing the change in Zheng's tone, the young master quickly agreed. However, upon glimpsing the mansion gate, he came around and cursed, "In your dream, fool! Fuck you!"</p>

  <p>The young master quickly turned around and ran. Just as that moment, a crowd walked out of the Li family mansion led by a wealthy looking man. The man walked with two escorts beside him and radiated a threatening Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>Instead of going after the young master instantly, Luo Zheng stood still and stared at the group of people coming out of the mansion.</p>

  <p>The young master ran towards the man and hid behind him. He said with tears, "Father, that bastard slapped me out of nowhere!"</p>

  <p>The cheeks of the young master were swollen and there was blood on his mouth. He looked ragged, far from his usual elegant look. It looked like he was beaten up good by Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The young master's father was the wealthiest man in the G Country and his name was Price Li. The young master was his only son and he had him after so many years of trying. Therefore, he couldn't help but spoil his son and he would do everything to protect him from any harm.</p>

  <p>When he saw his son's severely injured face, his face turned pale. Price comforted his son then walked towards Luo Zheng with his two bodyguards.</p>

  <p>"Who do you think you are? How dare you hit my son?"</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng was in no mood to explain himself and said to Price, "Yes, I beat him. So what?"</p>

  <p>Price Li was a man of real ability. He made successful businesses out of the barren land of G Country. When he talked to Luo Zheng, he could sense that the young man's arrogance was from his strength. But he didn't feel fear.</p>

  <p>"You're just a nature creature. How dare you beat up my son in front of my house? Do you really think that no one in G Country can defeat you?" he said. After saying this to Luo Zheng, Price gestured to his bodyguards and they stepped forward.</p>

  <p>Price's bodyguards were the top of masters in G Country. One of them had reached the seventh grade of nature level, while the other one was at the eighth grade.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was a little surprised about the strength of their martial arts.</p>

  <p>Because in his hometown, the C Country, a master at fifth grade of nature level could dominate the whole county with his supremely strong power.</p>

  <p>'Why do these two masters in G Country work for him as his bodyguards?" Luo Zheng was confused.</p>

  <p>He stopped wondering about it when he couldn't get an answer. If he was still a half-step into the nature level, it would be difficult for him to handle these two masters.</p>

  <p>But now that he reached the nature level, fighting with these two bodyguards would be an easy task.</p>

  <p>After receiving the order from their master, the bodyguards closed in on Luo Zheng but didn't attack just yet.</p>
