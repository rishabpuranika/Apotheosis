<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1539 The City Lord (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>However, in this main city, the nefarious deed of squeezing or nipping others' Illusion Points was done openly and systematically.</p>

  <p>Someone had become the self-proclaimed city lord and more than that, the lord had ordered all the martial artists in the city to submit to his or her will and laws. In fact, handing in half of their Illusion Points was the same as getting killed once by the city lord. The self-proclaimed lord was so brazenly arrogant to demand that term to be met.</p>

  <p>When the warrior saw Zheng's outraged expression, he warned, "I advise you to obey and go register right away, otherwise you may not be able to leave this city ever again!"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean 'unable to leave the city'?" Despite Zheng's cold agitation, his interest was also piqued at the same time.</p>

  <p>If this "city lord" had really been milking all of the warriors in the city for their valuable Illusion Points, then the number of Illusion Points that this individual had amassed must be huge indeed! Luo Zheng could only smile at the juicy target that this had created.</p>

  <p>In confronting this "city lord", it would save Luo Zheng a lot of trouble to secure a prodigious amount of Illusion Points in one fell swoop. Zheng's grin spread even further and he looked like a cat that stole the cream.</p>

  <p>The warrior chuckled. "The city lord has already taken control of this city. If you do not register and hand over your Illusion Points, you will be an easy target for hordes of other warriors who will attack and kill once you leave the city! Under this situation, how do you expect to leave and survive?"</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes flashed faintly. He did love a challenge! The situation the warrior had described was only for ordinary martial artists.</p>

  <p>Since the main city was so big, even if he proved to be no match for the city lord, it wasn't difficult for him to find a random place and escape from here…</p>

  <p>Seeing Zheng's disapproving expression, the warrior said, "I advise you to go register on your own initiative, otherwise you might lose more than half of your Illusion Points. I'm afraid you will lose all of your Illusion Points in the end. In the end, you will have nothing but regret!"</p>

  <p>Somebody had proclaimed himself the city lord, but there were many warriors who had refused to acknowledge this self-promulgated person as their leader or obey him. Those brave warriors tried to leave the city again and again, but only a very small number of them were successful.</p>

  <p>Most of the warriors who left the city were immediately attacked and killed. Then they would get revived in the main city again. These warriors were trapped in an endless cycle which culminated in despair.</p>

  <p>After repeated death, the number of Illusion Points the warriors had accumulated would have rapidly decreased!</p>

  <p>"Where should I register?" Luo Zheng smiled faintly. He had already come up with a devious plan in his mind.</p>

  <p>"Over there!"</p>

  <p>The warrior pointed off into the distance.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng nodded his head, he strolled through the main city, taking in the sights. Not long after, he saw that at the entrance of a building in the main city, there were quite a few martial artists lining up. This was the place where warriors grudgingly registered and reluctantly handed over their Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>Previously, Luo Zheng had handed in three hundred thousand Illusion Points to obtain the Teleportation Token. However, those Illusions Points had then been deducted by the Illusion Battlefield, not some selfish fop who took what was not earned.</p>

  <p>To pay Illusion Points here meant that martial artists had to voluntarily stretch their necks for this so-called city lord to kill them! Death was the only way to transfer Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>If the city lord wanted to kill Luo Zheng, he would have to do it outside the city…</p>

  <p>Thinking of this, Luo Zheng also joined the long line.</p>

  <p>The warriors queuing up all had more or less depressed looks on their faces. After all, no one in their rational mind would be willing to offer up half of their Illusion Points to anyone else. Certainly not without a fight.</p>

  <p>Among the warriors standing dejectedly in the line, some of them had previously refused to pay the Illusion Points, but they later got killed repeatedly by the subordinates of the city lord. In the end, they had no other choice but to come here to pay the Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>As for some warriors, they had initially left the city to explore, but after returning, they had fought against the "city lord" but had been defeated and killed. After reviving, they had wanted to leave the city, but to do that they had to come here to register, so that the "city lord" could kill them once more before they could leave this damned place!</p>

  <p>The most unfortunate ones were the martial artists that had died in the wild. Some martial artists did not land in this city in the first place, but they had accidentally trespassed into the surrounding areas of this city while exploring the wilderness. As a result, they were killed by the many vicious legendary beasts which roamed in this region.</p>

  <p>According to the rules of the Illusion Battlefield, if any warriors died in the wilds, they would be made to revive in the nearest main city. This main city was the closest to them, so after reviving, they would automatically enter this city… Entering this main city meant that they would have to be killed by the city lord again in order to leave here safely.</p>

  <p>The reason why Luo Zheng was queuing here was not to hand over his Illusion Points. Illusion Points were so precious, how could he give them away to others so easily?</p>

  <p>His target was the city lord of this main city!</p>

  <p>After waiting for about five minutes in the long line, it was finally his turn.</p>

  <p>"Name!" The warrior in charge of registrations called coldly.</p>

  <p>"Tianxing Luo," Luo Zheng said faintly.</p>

  <p>"Which force of the human race are you from? Which world? And which sacred place?" the warrior continued to ask, barely looking up at Luo Zheng as he began to scribble with a quill on a parchment.</p>
