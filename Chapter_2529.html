<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng's expression was surprisingly calm. "I don't care who he is. It's none of my business.</p>

  <p>I only know that he was courting death!"</p>

  <p>"How dare you!" spat the girl in the red robe. Not once did she think about meeting a guy who feared nothing and no one.</p>

  <p>"You're the one who's courting death!" shouted one of her guards.</p>

  <p>The Blue Sect was the overlord of this vast Immemorial Wilderness.</p>

  <p>The young man Zheng killed was the most talented disciple in the Blue Sect for nearly a hundred years. Just recently, he had been chosen as a personal disciple by the sect leader, but now he had died on a trip outside.</p>

  <p>Thinking of their leader's cruel and violent nature, the guards worried about how they were going to explain all of this to him.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The two guards' bodies glowed a faint yellow light and their bodies began to grow in size.</p>

  <p>They grew and grew until they were five thousand feet tall.</p>

  <p>The two of them looked at Zheng menacingly.</p>

  <p>"Don't kill him. He killed my dear brother. We'll surely be punished when we return to the sect but if we take him back, my master might vent his anger on him instead of us," the red-clad woman said coldly.</p>

  <p>She was also a personal disciple of the Blue Sect's leader. Like her late fellow disciple, she was very gifted, but her cultivation base was much weaker than his.</p>

  <p>The two guards considered her words before shooting Zheng malicious glares. "You brat! If you know what's best for you, you will surrender without a fuss!"</p>

  <p>They already knew Zheng's swordsmanship was very strange and powerful, however, they also believed that the young man died because he had underestimated Zheng.</p>

  <p>Now, both of them were going all out, leaving Zheng no chance to win.</p>

  <p>"Surrender?" Zheng slightly raised the corner of his mouth and gently lifted the Shadow Bearing Sword in his hand. "Do you think that's possible?"</p>

  <p>"Cut the crap! Just cripple him first," the other guard spat angrily.</p>

  <p>Without hesitation, the two giants came at Zheng like two mountains.</p>

  <p>The girl stared intently at Zheng. From the very beginning up to now, she had not found the slightest trace of panic on Zheng's face. She wondered where his confidence came from. Perhaps he had powerful moves up his sleeve?</p>

  <p>Just as the two guards rushed towards Zheng, the surface of the Shadow Bearing Sword in Zheng's hand suddenly flashed two colors.</p>

  <p>One was cyan, and the other was gray. This was the Truth of Goodwill and Malice!</p>

  <p>Although Zheng hadn't completely mastered the Truth of Goodwill and Malice yet, he had merged with the soul of the Shadow Bearing Sword which was why he was able to use the sword's theurgies.</p>

  <p>"Frenzy of Goodwill and Malice!"</p>

  <p>This was a soul attack using the Shadow Bearing Sword.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The two guards felt as if their heads had been hit by a heavy hammer, and that their goodwill and malice were stimulated at the same time.</p>

  <p>Their thoughts were jumbled and their eyes were filled with confusion.</p>

  <p>In a high-level battle such as this, sudden loss of consciousness was enough to determine the outcome!</p>

  <p>Zheng's body moved like lightning, the long sword in his hand gleaming with cyan light.</p>

  <p>Puff! Puff!</p>

  <p>Two muffled sounds were heard.</p>

  <p>And the next thing they knew, two severed heads lay on the ground.</p>

  <p>It was clear that their eyes were still filled with blankness, and their souls were still in chaos until they died completely.</p>

  <p>Hiss!</p>

  <p>The Wild God Power in their bodies then began to dissipate and their bodies quickly shrank to the size of a normal person.</p>

  <p>The Shadow Bearing Sword still in his hand, Zheng glanced indifferently at the girl in red.</p>

  <p>The girl, still floating in the air, stared blankly at the two guards' corpses.</p>

  <p>In just a short period of time, three people had already been killed.</p>

  <p>And their opponent was only a True God.</p>

  <p>Wasn't everyone who cultivated in the True God Realm very weak?</p>

  <p>At the very least, she knew that very few people chose to cultivate in the True God Realm in the Blue Sect. Only a few talents would try to create an inner world, but that only served as an assisting method.</p>

  <p>How could this man be so powerful?</p>

  <p>Zheng's performance had completely left her dumbfounded!</p>

  <p>Then she understood why Zheng had been so calm.</p>

  <p>A chill ran up her spine. She was the only one left!</p>

  <p>She was the weakest among the four, and she didn't think this man would let her leave unharmed.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Zheng floated over to her, light as a feather. He stopped a few feet from her, and the Shadow Bearing Sword in his hand was pointed at the center of her brows.</p>

  <p>No matter which force these four people came from, he had to kill all of them to avoid any future troubles.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng was not someone who condoned killing. While this woman had been annoyingly sarcastic towards him, she never attacked.</p>

  <p>Zheng frowned. He needed a reason to kill this woman. "Aren't you going to fight back?"</p>

  <p>She trained her eyes on Zheng's indifferent face, her jaw clenched tightly.</p>

  <p>The sharp tip of the Shadow Bearing Sword had cut through the skin on her forehead.</p>

  <p>Watching blood trickle down her beautiful face, Zheng eventually sighed in resignation.</p>

  <p>He withdrew the sword and put it into his space ring. With a flip in the air, he flew towards the other side of the Immemorial Wilderness.</p>

  <p>When Zheng's figure had completely disappeared, she let out a deep breath and slowly descended from the high sky. She fell on her knees, feeling weak and limp. She had just stared death in the face.</p>

  <p>Zheng knew that letting this woman go would bite him back in the future but he just couldn't bring himself to violate his own rules.</p>

  <p>Besides, the Immemorial Wilderness was very vast. No matter how powerful her sect was, there was only a small chance of finding Zheng.</p>

  <p>Back in the tribe, Luther had been studying the cultivation method that Zheng had given him.</p>

  <p>This cultivation method, taken from the library of the fairy palace, was a very special theurgy and Luther had been very unwilling to study it. After all, it was Zelda's idea that he should cultivate in the True God Realm.</p>

  <p>However, with his meridians sealed, he couldn't cultivate to be a Wild God and this was the only option for him. Left with no choice, he began to study it.</p>

  <p>And quite unexpectedly, he was attracted by this cultivation method.</p>

  <p>The cultivation methods in the divine land were all inherited from Chiyou while the True God Realm was popular in the chaos. However, at the bottom of the chaos, due to the existence of the wild bones, the practice in the True God Realm was seen as inferior.</p>

  <p>But this cultivation method that Zheng had given him was created by Bromley himself and was naturally one of the best.</p>

  <p>Luther's talent was extraordinary. And as he carefully read it, he felt as if a whole new world was opening for him.</p>
