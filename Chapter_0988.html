  <p>
</p>

  <p>Tianming's sword attack was originally meant to kill Emanuel and it wasn't going to be hard for him to do that.</p>

  <p>Emanuel was the leader of the rebels, and it was him who had gathered all the third-grade clans in Cloudy City.</p>

  <p>However, for some reason, the moment he made his move, Tianming changed his mind.</p>

  <p>Even if he managed to kill Emanuel, it would not change the current situation too much. If Emanuel was killed, Tianming and his companions would still be unable to win the battle. The rebels could find someone else to replace Emanuel.</p>

  <p>This was why Tianming had chosen to kill three warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm at such a tricky angle. And even after that massacre, the effect on the situation as a whole was negligible.</p>

  <p>Saint Morphens and Emanuel were well matched in strength. The two of them, when engaged in battle, were fierce and swift, but the number of warriors on Emanuel's side was still much higher than those on Saint Morphens' side.</p>

  <p>As for Patrick, Lewis, and all the other warriors at Internal Elixir Realm, they had no way of fighting against cultivators at the Virtual Tribulation Realm, and they lost the battle in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A warrior at the Virtual Tribulation Realm finally broke through the defense line. Holding a large, emerald green saber in his hand, he rushed furiously towards Tianming.</p>

  <p>"Since you killed my brother, you are going to die too!"</p>

  <p>Even before he had finished speaking, his saber had slid across and come down with a great might towards Tianming's neck.</p>

  <p>Tianming lightly slid across the ground and the sword in his hand struck out once more.</p>

  <p>Ding! The sword was easily blocked by Tianming's opponent.</p>

  <p>Tianming's strongest move while practicing swordsmanship was the Heavenly Sword, and it had taken him a long time to accumulate the strength necessary to use it. Without this accumulation of strength, he was not a match for a warrior at the Virtual Tribulation Realm.</p>

  <p>Just as the warrior blocked Tianming's sword, he suddenly turned around and threw a punch straight at Tianming's chest.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The fist landed heavily, and caused the victim's chest to cave in deep. His entire body was thrown backwards and he rolled on the ground for several rounds before slowly coming to a stop. As Tianming gasped for air lying on the ground, stubbornness could be seen in his eyes.</p>

  <p>He had chosen to side with Yudie after discussing it with Patrick and Lewis.</p>

  <p>The main reason why they had chosen that side was mainly because of Zheng.</p>

  <p>They knew the relationship between Zheng and Yudie, and even though, at the beginning, the three of them were slightly hesitant, later on, even the usually timid Lewis had stepped forward to protect Yudie. There was no reason why Tianming and Patrick wouldn't do the same.</p>

  <p>As for whether their choice was right or wrong, Tianming wasn't clear.</p>

  <p>Perhaps sometimes, warriors didn't have to rank their decisions by judging whether it would yield a profit or not. Perhaps somethings were just more important than their own lives.</p>

  <p>"A little brat at the Internal Elixir Realm like you killed three warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm. What a pity! I wonder how far you would have gone in the future!" Tianming's opponent slowly walked towards him as the saber in his hand repeatedly flashed with a cold light that essentially reeked of death.</p>

  <p>At that very moment, an agile figure rushed out of nowhere. It was so fast that it dazzled everyone's eyes and could not be distinguished from the streaks of light it left behind.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Because his speed was too fast, countless clones were formed, surrounding the warrior at the Virtual Tribulation Realm who was about to kill Tianming. This figure was none other than Lewis.</p>

  <p>Such a strange movement skill could be considered outstanding among the warriors at the Internal Elixir Realm, but to a warrior at the Virtual Tribulation Realm, it was nothing. Just as Lewis was constantly moving around Tianming's opponent, the latter suddenly threw out a punch.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>His enemy had accurately identified Lewis from the clones, and with a single punch, he had sent Lewis flying backwards.</p>

  <p>The warrior revealed a scornful smile. "Your movement skill is indeed remarkable. When I was at the Internal Elixir Realm, I was unable to utilize such a wonderful movement skill. Unfortunately, your cultivation level is too low for you to be able to fight me!"</p>

  <p>As soon as his voice faded, a giant hand suddenly appeared above his head. The hand was like a solid substance as it fiercely slapped down.</p>

  <p>"Humph!"</p>

  <p>The warrior didn't even raise his head as he slashed his saber upwards.</p>

  <p>The saber radiance that was produced by his intense life vitality instantly sliced the huge hand into a million tiny pieces.</p>

  <p>Even Patrick's attack was unable to stop this warrior.</p>

  <p>Instantly after that, the warrior arrived in front of Tianming and stepped onto his hand. The large saber in his hand was already at Tianming's neck.</p>

  <p>"It's a pity. If you hadn't chosen to stand by Yudie's side, you would have lived to become a powerful warrior in the future. Since you have chosen a path of death yourself, you cannot blame me for bestowing you with such a deathly gift!"</p>

  <p>Tianming, at his current level of strength, was enough to be ranked among the divine-level talents. Killing him was not a small loss to the Cloud Hall. After all, this group of people was only there for the position of leader of the Cloud Hall and not to destroy the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>However, Tianming could not blame them for killing him as he himself had chosen to stand on Yudie's side.</p>

  <p>A trace of decisiveness appeared on Tianming's face. He was firm and resolute even in the face of such a dangerous moment. Ever since he had made his decision, he had been mentally prepared for failure.</p>

  <p>Tianming closed his eyes as he looked at the rapidly descending large saber.</p>

  <p>But shortly after, the saber didn't fall.</p>

  <p>Tianming frowned and wondered, 'Could it be that this guy wants to mock me before killing me? Does he want a cat and mouse game?'</p>

  <p>However, when Tianming opened his eyes, he saw a hand holding onto the blade of the saber. The saber was only a few inches away from him, but it was unable to go any further.</p>

  <p>'Who is it? Who could possibly catch the saber of a warrior at the Virtual Tribulation Realm with his bare hand?' Tianming wondered.</p>

  <p>He turned around to look who it was, and then a broad smile appeared on his face. He had once imagined that Zheng would return, but he had never expected him to appear at such a crucial moment. "Zheng, you've returned!" Tianming exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded his head and then used a bit of force to grab onto the saber.</p>

  <p>The next moment, the top-grade fairy weapon bent in his hand. The tough surface of the saber was as fragile as a piece of paper in Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>Everyone was still immersed in the slaughter, and therefore, no one had noticed the commotion. Only Lewis had an ecstatic smile on his face, while Patrick let out a long sigh as he thought to himself, 'Tianming, we made the right decision!'</p>

  <p>As for Tianming's opponent, he was completely dumbfounded. He looked blankly at the bent saber in his hand, and then looked blankly at Zheng, seemingly unable to react at all.</p>

  <p>"I am back!" This time, Zheng suddenly roared towards the crowd. With the infusion of life vitality into his voice, Zheng's roar was immediately heard clearly by everyone.</p>

  <p>When the warriors who were fighting heard this fierce roar, they all stopped.</p>

  <p>Even Saint Morphens and Emanuel pushed each other away as their gazes gathered on Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>Of course, the two had completely different expressions. When Saint Morphens saw Zheng, a smile instantly appeared on his face, and he shouted in ecstasy, "Zheng! You've reached the Virtual Tribulation Realm!"</p>

  <p>At the same moment, Emanuel's face was marked by a gloomy expression.</p>

  <p>Just now, Tianming had killed three warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm with a single sword strike, but Emanuel was safe and sound.</p>

  <p>Emanuel was confident that he would surely be the new leader of Cloud Hall. As long as he could stall Saint Morphens and wait for everyone else to clean up the warriors, he would be able to charge into the Ice Palace and kill Yudie.</p>

  <p>If all his plans were being carried out in an orderly manner, the entire Cloud Hall would be his a few days later. With the protection of the Small Circulation Killing Array, even if he faced the Heavenly Evil Sect, he was not afraid. After becoming the leader of the Cloud Hall, he could use the resources of Cloud Hall to make a breakthrough. His future prospects were limitless!</p>

  <p>It just so happened that at this critical moment, that damned Zheng had actually come back!</p>

  <p>Wasn't he supposed to be dead?</p>

  <p>Although most people in the Cloud Hall believed that Zheng wasn't dead, Emanuel was paranoid enough to believe that Zheng would definitely be dead and that there was no possibility of him coming back.</p>

  <p>How could Emanuel not be surprised when he saw Zheng standing not far away and having reached the Virtual Tribulation Realm?</p>

  <p>The expressions of the warriors of the third-grade clans also darkened.</p>

  <p>How were they going to deal with Zheng?</p>

  <p>"Humph, Zheng! So what if you're back? You are only at the early stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm and that's nothing compared to my warriors. You seriously think you can turn the tables all by yourself?</p>

  <p>What a joke! Guys, let's go and kill him!" Emanuel ordered.</p>

  <p>"Yes. He is just a warrior at the Virtual Tribulation Realm. He is no match for us!"</p>

  <p>"Let's kill him together!"</p>

  <p>Emanuel's words were very clever. The number of warriors on Yudie's side was far too small, not to mention that most of them were only at the Internal Elixir Realm. Even with Zheng's help, the tables were not going to be turned.</p>

  <p>Four warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm activated their life vitality at the same time. Their bodies flashed as they instantly surrounded Zheng from four different directions.</p>
