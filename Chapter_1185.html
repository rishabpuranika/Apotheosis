</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng himself was uncertain of what corpse he would be able to take over or its strength, but in the end, the higher the floor was, the stronger the corpse would be.</p>

  <p>The Soul Purifying Light on the stairs lasted for about thirty seconds before it began to dissipate.</p>

  <p>War King Wind wasted no time. As soon as the light died, he used his consciousness to give orders to all the warriors.</p>

  <p>"Move!"</p>

  <p>At his words, all the warriors standing on the platforms on both sides of the stairs charged forward.</p>

  <p>There would be a thirty-second interval before the Soul Purifying Light lit up again. Taking advantage of this gap, everyone climbed up the next floor.</p>

  <p>The warriors hastily went up the flight of steps. With a tell-tale light, the Soul Purifying Light lit up once again. At once, War King Wind commanded, "Retreat! Go to the platforms!"</p>

  <p>Huts lined the platforms on the third floor to a big number. In strength, however, the corpses inside the coffins in these huts were only at the late stage of the Internal Elixir Realm when they were alive.</p>

  <p>The strength of the Dragon Lineage Human was far greater than that of the warriors in all the four divine kingdoms. Even the four divine kingdoms had countless Internal Elixir Realm warriors, so it was only natural that the Internal Elixir Realm warriors from the Dragon Lineage Human would be great in number. However, as Luo Luo Zheng looked around the third floor, there were only around 600 to 700 huts.</p>

  <p>The warriors buried here were undoubtedly among the most important members of the Dragon Lineage Human. They had perished at a young age, and this cemetery served as the resting place for their corpses.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did not give the coffins a second glance. These corpses were far too weak, and they would be of no use to him.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the whole cemetery held its breath as the warriors stood in silence, awaiting War King Wind's next orders. The Soul Purifying Light was a fatal threat to souls, and the actions of over a hundred people had to be in perfect coordination. The slightest hesitation or the split second of untimely movement would cost them their souls, turning them into soulless cadavers.</p>

  <p>"Warriors, keep your guards up! The Soul Purifying Light is spreading from top to bottom. The higher up we go, the shorter the time we have!"</p>

  <p>War King Wind stared at the Soul Purifying Light, watching it dim once again. The moment it disappeared, he gave orders once again. "Go!" he commanded.</p>

  <p>Without hesitating, pausing, or delaying, the warriors once again ascended the stairs in perfect unison.</p>

  <p>"Disperse!"</p>

  <p>War King Wind ordered. Everyone jumped to the platforms on the either side of the stairs.</p>

  <p>When he landed on a platform, War King Wind looked back. His eyes grew wide as his heart sank in his chest. His daughter was still standing on the stairs.</p>

  <p>Fiona had missed her father's orders. Just as everyone was jumping to the platforms, she took a few steps towards the side of the stairs, seemingly observing the words of the Dragon Lineage Human engraved on a coffin.</p>

  <p>She had been so absorbed with it that she lost track of everything around her.</p>

  <p>War King Wind's orders had failed to bring her out of her reverie.</p>

  <p>She was a lone figure left standing on the stairs. Everyone else had already jumped onto a safe place. War King Wind watched in horror as the Soul Purifying Light covered the stairs at a fast pace.</p>

  <p>The Soul Purifying Light was much stronger than the cemetery-guarding lamp at the entrance. Even a mighty warrior at the Soul Sea Realm would be no match for its power.</p>

  <p>War King Wind was rooted to the spot as he watched his daughter in the face of such danger.</p>

  <p>"Fiona!"</p>

  <p>Callan was very anxious. Although he was not that smart, he was always very serious and did not allow the slightest distraction to break his guard.</p>

  <p>After War King Wind gave the orders, Callan also followed the group to the fourth floor.</p>

  <p>But then there was Fiona, standing alone in front of the quickly approaching Soul Purifying Light. Without any hesitation, he rushed out to save her.</p>

  <p>However, before he could leap, a Soul Sea Realm master had reacted quickly and stood in front of him to block his path.</p>

  <p>The Soul Purifying Light had already lit up, slowly going down from the top of the stairs. In just a few seconds, it would reach the fourth floor.</p>

  <p>Even Callan's attempt to save her would be nothing but suicide.</p>

  <p>All the warriors turned to look at Fiona, their eyes widening in fear.</p>

  <p>Fiona was a gifted warrior with much promise. As a descendant of the Genuine Phoenix and with a Genuine Phoenix as her contractual beast, she would not lose even to the top talents of the Upper World after she ascended to the Upper World in the future. She was destined for a greatness that far exceeded any of the Soul Sea Realm masters present.</p>

  <p>She was not meant to die in here today.</p>

  <p>War King Wind felt as if the sky was falling on him as he watched his daughter with great despair and anguish. And yet, there was nothing he could do to help her. Even though his soul was the most powerful among those of the Soul Sea Realm warriors present, he didn't dare to touch the Soul Purifying Light. Therefore, he didn't have enough time to run towards Fiona and save her.</p>

  <p>As the warriors watched, a figure suddenly rushed out.</p>

  <p>"Tianxing Luo?"</p>

  <p>"Come back!"</p>

  <p>"Tianxing! Don't go!" Turner shouted.</p>

  <p>Even if Luo Zheng's soul was stronger than that of any other warrior present, time was his adversary. If the Soul Purifying Light touched him, he would be instantly eliminated.</p>

  <p>Everyone else's soul was dispensable compared to his.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was the hope of all the Soul Sea Realm warriors to restore the path to the Upper World.</p>

  <p>Soon, all of the warriors called out to him, asking him to stay on the platform.</p>

  <p>However, it was as if their pleas had fallen to deaf ears. Luo Luo Zheng did not listen to them. His soul turned into a black shadow as he moved forward.</p>

  <p>The Soul Purifying Light had already spread down the stairs.</p>

  <p>The Soul Purifying Light surged out from the top stairs. Within a few seconds, all the stairs above the fourth floor were completely covered in its blinding light, which was extending to the fourth floor. In just a few moments, the remaining stairs would be filled by its deadly glow.</p>

  <p>At this crucial moment, Luo Luo Zheng simply did not have the time to check how far the Soul Purifying Light was from him. He rushed towards Fiona, grabbed her in his arms, and continued to rush forward.</p>

  <p>Bringing her back to the fourth floor would be impossible in such a short period of time. And so, he used the momentum to rush to the right platform on the third floor.</p>

  <p>It had only been a hair's breadth. The Soul Purifying Light spread under Luo Zheng's feet the moment he leaped. The platform on the third floor shook as Luo Luo Zheng and Fiona landed, propelling them downwards. They landed heavily on the platform on the second floor.</p>

  <p>The moment he fell, Luo Luo Zheng turned around and placed Fiona on top of him, using his own soul as a cushion.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's soul was tenacious, but Fiona's was different. One's soul had the fragility of a newborn baby before entering the Fighting Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>Fiona's soul had undergone training, but it was still delicate.</p>

  <p>Fiona, sitting on top of Luo Luo Zheng absently, was still unable to break off from her daze. She had hesitated earlier, and it had almost cost her soul. In retrospect, even if she had been unable to advance with the others, she could have hidden on a platform on the third floor and waited until the wave of Soul Purifying Light dissipated. Once it had disappeared, she could charge forward once again. However, she had been overcome at the face of her looming death and was petrified.</p>

  <p>A long sigh of relief resounded as the Soul Sea Realm masters watched the pair out of harm's way.</p>

  <p>War King Wind was filled with gratitude. After entering the Soul Sea Realm, he did not have much to worry about, and his attention was mostly on his daughter. Even if he succeeded in exploring the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land, it would be an empty victory if he lost Fiona.</p>

  <p>The other Soul Sea Realm masters were also relieved, though it had been more for Luo Luo Zheng than Fiona. He was their only hope to go to the Upper World. If he died here, all their efforts would have been for nothing. To them, Fiona's life would be a small price to pay if it meant Luo Zheng's safety.</p>

  <p>The staircase continued to flash with the Soul Purifying Light. Fiona stood up from Luo Zheng's body and communicated with him with her consciousness. "Thank you," she said.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled and answered, "It's fine. Let's keep going!"</p>

  <p>War King Wind no longer led the group up the stairs. Instead, he waited for Luo Luo Zheng and Fiona on the fourth floor.</p>
