<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Natalie remembered Yan often talking about how powerful her brother was.</p>

  <p>But she figured that Yan was exaggerating as she bragged— it was natural for young girls to admire their older brothers, after all. But once she met Zheng herself, she realized how wrong she was. Among the Pear Hill warriors of the younger generation, Natalie couldn't think of a single one who could dream of contending against Zheng.</p>

  <p>Now, it seemed as though Yan was even being too modest when she described her brother.</p>

  <p>Forgetting about the younger generation…</p>

  <p>Even the seniors who had already reached the Chaotic Source Realm and the Desire World couldn't fight against him.</p>

  <p>The Evil God gazed at the crystal Zheng as he would gaze at a lover. "Very good… I like it…"</p>

  <p>In the next moment, he had his hands crossed. Black spikes began spreading out of his figure until his entire body spiraled up into a black cyclone.</p>

  <p>Phew!</p>

  <p>The cyclone shook gently.</p>

  <p>It was as though an enormous hand had drawn a black line in the sky, sweeping right past Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>It was such a rapid movement that no one even caught the motion with their bare eyes.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't move an inch, but his crystallized arm was broken in a second.</p>

  <p>A thousand feet behind Zheng, the Evil God halted. He grabbed Zheng's severed hand and gnawed at it. The cyan crystal was hard and crisp, making crackling noises as the Evil God bored his teeth into it. Soon, he had swallowed it completely.</p>

  <p>"Tastes good," the Evil God clasped his hands in satisfaction, and the crystal fragments fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>For a second, Zheng's eyes widened in surprise. The Evil God's speed suddenly erupted, indicating that he hadn't been using his full strength earlier.</p>

  <p>"What an amazing speed…" As Zheng muttered, he could feel his body tremble while a cyan arm grew out of his broken limb.</p>

  <p>"Thank you for your praise! Let me show you once again! This time, it'll be your head."</p>

  <p>The Evil God mocked Zheng menacingly before he turned into another black cyclone.</p>

  <p>Once again, a thin, black line swept across the sky and through Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>No one could see either of the opponents' movements clearly. All they caught was Zheng shaking slightly in the air. When the Evil God stopped and hovered in the sky, his hands were empty— instead of taking Zheng's head, he ended up losing his own leg.</p>

  <p>The leg formed from black energy appeared in Zheng's hand. With a smug smile, he shook the leg and threw it to the ground like a piece of trash.</p>

  <p>The Inheritance of World was an extremely powerful method— it could turn the cultivator into forms of energy in a short period of time.</p>

  <p>Everything in the Regal Jade World was made out of Regal Jade Crystals— even the creatures of the Regal Jade World lived in these crystals. The newly descended Inheritance of World had Zheng entirely crystallized.</p>

  <p>The same went for the strangely-colored world summoned by the Evil God.</p>

  <p>It turned him into a being of black energy— it didn't matter what happened to his body. Any limb Zheng tore off regenerated in a blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>Phew! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Both of them launched an attack once again.</p>

  <p>The Evil God's burst of strength had increased. He activated his speed to a shocking extreme.</p>

  <p>Zheng's movement technique, of course, was ingenious. He avoided the Evil God's attacks with ease, and never did he lack an incredible and immediate counterattack.</p>

  <p>The crowd below watched the fight with their jaws slack.</p>

  <p>"Are they playing some sort of dismembering game?"</p>

  <p>"They're ripping each other's limbs off…they're complete freaks!"</p>

  <p>"I've never seen such a fight before…"</p>

  <p>A fight of this level should have only been possible between spokespersons of large civilizations.</p>

  <p>These spokespersons were all super powerful warriors of the Source World But Zheng and the Evil God were exceptions at the moment— they had each found a Civilization Artifact in Stage Thirteen of the Lust World, triggering such a high-level battle.</p>

  <p>The power of each of their Civilization Artifacts had still been suppressed in the Lust World.</p>

  <p>If these two civilizations could return to the Desire World, or to the higher stages, the pair of Civilization Artifacts would display even more terrifying power.</p>

  <p>Not only the talents in the Chaotic Source World hadn't ever seen a fight of this calibre— even Fuxi, such a powerful being, was flabbergasted.</p>

  <p>For someone as powerful as Fuxi, to summon a world of a civilization and merge with the Inheritance of World wasn't something particularly new. But how could two people who hadn't even stepped into the Chaotic Source Realm, throw fists as they both summoned a world and merged with the Inheritance of World?</p>

  <p>It was too inconceivable.</p>

  <p>If he hadn't seen it with his own eyes, he wouldn't have believed such a thing could even happen.</p>

  <p>No matter how much their bodies were dismembered, Zheng and the Evil God had no trouble restoring their bodies.</p>

  <p>As the cyan and black lines collided further, Zheng gradually gained the upper hand.</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade Civilization supporting him was way more powerful.</p>

  <p>With the pair of wings that originally belonged to the Regal Jade World's Wing King, the bodily movement skill he displayed clearly indicated the Regal Jade Civilization's superiority.</p>

  <p>Once Zheng adapted to the Evil God's speed, he leisurely waited for the latter to attack him.</p>

  <p>Every time the Evil God turned into a black line as he rushed toward Zheng, his cyan wings trembled. Zheng had no trouble avoiding the Evil God's attacks with mere slight movements.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>As the two fought, Zheng tore off one of the Evil God's arms again.</p>

  <p>Initially, he didn't deal with the Evil God's broken limbs— he casually threw them away.</p>

  <p>The severed limbs fell and dissolved into black energy, disappearing from the strangely-colored world.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, the overall energy of the world one summons always remains the same. The Evil God can easily recycle the energy and use it again. But you can seal that energy," the Regal Jade Spirit explained.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes flashed with excitement— he now got to the crux of the matter.</p>

  <p>If he didn't deal with the broken limbs of the Evil God, the latter could easily gain his energy back. That would have made the fight endless.</p>

  <p>When the Evil God tried attacking again, Zheng merely ripped off one of his legs.</p>

  <p>This time, he threw the limb to the ground, where a Regal Jade Crystal suddenly sprouted. The crystal's surface was like chalcedony, wrapping up the Evil God's severed leg.</p>

  <p>The limb couldn't dissipate— it was now like an insect wrapped in amber, sealed forever.</p>

  <p>Seeing that, the Evil God frowned. Without giving it another thought, he charged at Zheng once again.</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…</p>

  <p>As their fight went on, Zheng won more than he lost.</p>

  <p>Crystals were growing everywhere from the ground. Within them, there were the arms, legs and all other parts of the Evil God's body.</p>

  <p>After a moment, over a hundred broken body parts were sealed in crystals.</p>

  <p>It was an extremely strange sight to behold.</p>

  <p>Energy from the severed body parts of the Evil God couldn't be recycled.</p>

  <p>Initially, he was over ten feet high. But after using his energy to regenerate his body parts over and over again, his enormous body began shrinking foot by foot.</p>

  <p>There was no doubt that the Evil God was still extremely ferocious, but he had shrunk down to the size of an ordinary child.</p>
