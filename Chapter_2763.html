<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2763 The Way Of Survival Under Water </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Before, Luo Zheng had been shrouded by thick dark water that had completely blocked Sword Chen from his sight.</p>

  <p>Now, after entering this space, he finally laid eyes on Sword Chen.</p>

  <p>Covered in rags with messy hair and dirty skin, Sword Chen looked like a beggar.</p>

  <p>He looked nothing like the man Luo Zheng had met in the Corridor of Emperor years ago.</p>

  <p>The only thing the person in front of him and the Sword Chen he had met before had in common was the pair of sharp black eyes. They were like two obsidian gemstones shining with dark light.</p>

  <p>"This might not be the first time for you to see me," Sword Chen surmised, turning around.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I once saw you in the Corridor of Emperor in the Illusion Battlefield."</p>

  <p>Sword Chen nodded his head slightly. The person Luo Zheng had encountered in the Corridor of Emperor was nothing more than a soul mark that the original Sword Chen had left there.</p>

  <p>But the soul mark Sword Chen had left there hadn't been as competent as Augustus'. When the soul mark Augustus had left in the Fairy Place was activated, he had immediately learned about Luo Zheng's existence. Sword Chen, on the other hand, had had no knowledge of his encounter with Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Now, staring at Luo Zheng, Sword Chen asked, "What's your relationship with Holy Mike?"</p>

  <p>He already had a guess that he was more or less sure about, but he still wanted to confirm it.</p>

  <p>"Mike is my father," Luo Zheng answered.</p>

  <p>"It is just as I thought! So you didn't become my disciple in the Corridor of Emperor?" he asked calmly.</p>

  <p>"Yes." Luo Zheng nodded. "I already became Holy Bromley's disciple before that."</p>

  <p>"Ah, that makes sense. Among the ten Godly Geniuses, you are the most important one. Holy Bromley's Immortal Mansion had been reserved for you..."</p>

  <p>Sword Chen muttered to himself.</p>

  <p>When Sword Chen had still been a Supreme Lord, he hadn't known about the existence of the Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>By the time he had found out about the plan involving the Godly Geniuses, he had already come to the divine land.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked around the space they were in. It was a small sphere, and its outermost layer was still fluctuating. "So for the past few years, have you been living in the Sea of Meditation?"</p>

  <p>With a bitter smile on his face, Sword Chen said, "To be more precise, I've been living in this small bubble. In the dark water, there are only four such bubbles... Anyone who lingers outside these bubbles will be swallowed up by the unknown sooner or later!"</p>

  <p>"The unknown can't enter this bubble?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Sword Chen nodded. "Not just the unknown; the fiends can't enter this bubble either. This bubble belongs only to me."</p>

  <p>Back then, when Sword Chen had been running away from fierce beasts in the Abyss Demon Region, he had accidentally stumbled into the dark water.</p>

  <p>The beasts that were chasing him were too powerful for him to fight against, so he had decided to continue fleeing by plunging into the dark water.</p>

  <p>What he hadn't known at that time was that even those fierce beasts didn't dare to enter the dark water. In fact, the beasts had been so afraid of the dark water that they had given up on chasing Sword Chen altogether.</p>

  <p>In the dark water, he had soon encountered the fear of the unknown.</p>

  <p>The fear released by the unknown was too overpowering to resist.</p>

  <p>Extreme fear brought out different reactions in different people.</p>

  <p>Some people would be so frightened that they would stay in the same place like an ostrich.</p>

  <p>Some people, like Luo Zheng, would be prepared for an all-out battle in the face of such extreme fear, trying to eliminate the source of the fear.</p>

  <p>Sword Chen, however, had chosen to flee instead.</p>

  <p>He had run about in the thick dark water, until, thanks to pure luck, he had finally escaped from the unknown after entering a bubble? the very bubble that they were in now.</p>

  <p>"Later, I got to know that these bubbles were built by fiends who had put a great deal of effort into this project. They needed to cultivate in the dark water, and without the protection of these bubbles, they would definitely die," Sword Chen elaborated while stretching out his hand and pointing to the edge of the bubble.</p>

  <p>A stream of dark water was dragged into the bubble. Then, with a flick of his finger, he drove the stream of dark water out again. He shook his head and smiled bitterly. "Even after so long, I still don't know how the fiends made these bubbles. Their race is too intelligent..."</p>

  <p>"Didn't any of the fiends come here and trouble you?" Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>In the end, the dark water still belonged to the Abyss Demon Region. How could the fiends watch Sword Chen occupy their bubble and do nothing about it?</p>

  <p>"Of course they did," Sword Chen said, shrugging. "Unfortunately for them, I refined this bubble. They can do nothing but curse me from outside."</p>

  <p>These bubbles were a kind of space treasure with a special form.</p>

  <p>After obtaining such waterproof treasures, the powerful fiends had decided to use the dark water as their cultivation place.</p>

  <p>At that time, they had thought it unlikely for anyone else to enter the dark water, so they had left these bubbles unrefined.</p>

  <p>By chance, Sword Chen had taken advantage of this loophole and made this bubble his own.</p>

  <p>"There was a period of time when I was cursed incessantly, and I got so annoyed that I built a divine texture to resist the spiritual sense outside," said Sword Chen with a helpless smile on his face. "If it wasn't for this bubble that gave me a chance to survive, I'm afraid I would have been reincarnated."</p>

  <p>"Reincarnated?" When Luo Zheng heard this, his eyes suddenly flashed with more curiosity. "You can get reincarnated?"</p>

  <p>Sword Chen nodded, and with a flick of his hand, a streak of green light appeared on his palm.</p>

  <p>It was a green butterfly!</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng had never seen this butterfly before, he called out its name by instinct, "The Jade Scale Butterfly! I never expected that you would have it!"</p>

  <p>"You have been to the Reincarnation Land?" asked Sword Chen.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I entered the Abyss Demon Region through the Reincarnation Land,"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng explained.</p>

  <p>In the Reincarnation Land, there were three altars.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng had first seen them, he had been confused to note that there were no statues on two of the altars. He had wondered where the Jade Scale Butterfly and the Flame Blood Vulture could be in the divine land, but he had never expected that one of those things would be in Sword Chen's hands.</p>

  <p>In this bubble, there were no other cultivation resources available to Sword Chen. However, his cultivation method was similar to Liusu's. For the past few years, he had used the Jade Scale Butterfly to approach the Memory Flames and absorb the cultivation memory of the Memory Flames little by little. In this way, he had improved step by step and become a Demi-holy Being.</p>

  <p>"You entered the Abyss Demon Region through the Reincarnation Land, but why were you hunted by Samuel and his group?" Sword Chen was a little confused.</p>

  <p>Although he had the Jade Scale Butterfly, he could not use it to search the Memory Flames at will like Luo Zheng could do with his Reincarnation Soul Weapon, so he didn't know the recent happenings in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng quickly filled him in about everything that was happening.</p>

  <p>"Nicholas has joined forces with the powerful clans on the Floating Islands to conquer the Abyss Demon Region..." Sword Chen repeated. After thinking for a while, he narrowed his eyes and said with a cold smile, "It seems that the clever Nicholas can also be stupid sometimes. This might be an opportunity for us!"</p>
