<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 682 Pass Or Fail (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>However, even though some practitioners didn't pass the pre-qualifying test, they didn't think that the supreme life vitality crystal went to waste. They took it as a payment for a great opportunity to broaden their horizons. Pass or fail, the practitioners couldn't take back the supreme life vitality crystal.</p>

  <p>When the first practitioner left, another practitioner tried his luck.</p>

  <p>The practitioner had a crew cut and calm eyes. He was carrying a navy-blue machete on his back. He walked up to the old man, carelessly tossed a supreme life vitality crystal on the desk, and then walked towards the pale green stone.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if he can make it!"</p>

  <p>"He has reached the top-grade Illuminating Soul Realm. I think he can make the magnetic stone change its color."</p>

  <p>"I won't be so sure. Earlier, two practitioners has also reached that realm, remember? But they failed anyway."</p>

  <p>The crowd exchanged opinions with each other. As Luo Zheng listened, he finally got to know that it was a magnetic stone. It was quite different from any other ordinary stones that even the practitioners who reached the top-grade Illuminating Soul Realm would have failed to affect it.</p>

  <p>The practitioner with the machete approached the green stone, but he didn't do anything. He just stood slackly and simply waved his hand towards the stone.</p>

  <p>There was nothing at first. Then a sound of wind came.</p>

  <p>Then suddenly, the wind rushed towards the stone and hit it hard.</p>

  <p>'Wow! That's sharp and fierce! He applied a bit of the principle of wind.'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng thought to himself. This man hadn't even reached the Internal Elixir Realm yet, but he had the strength that could not be underestimated. It was quite rare that a practitioner who had only reached the top-grade Illuminating Soul Realm could do that. With the power that this practitioner showcased, Luo Zheng knew that that practitioner was someone he must not ignore.</p>

  <p>Then there was a loud noise! A bang!</p>

  <p>As the stream of air hit the stone, it didn't move an inch. But then, something unexpected happened–its color suddenly changed from green to red.</p>

  <p>The red color only lasted nine seconds, then the magnetic stone turned green again.</p>

  <p>"Wow! Can you believe it? He just did it from a distance, but he made it!</p>

  <p>He's incredible!"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid that even in those fourth-grade sects, only a few practitioners are able to do that. Don't get me started that he has only reached the top-grade Illuminating Soul Realm!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I agree with you. The magnetic stone has remained red for nearly fifteen seconds. For the practitioners of the top-grade Illuminating Soul Realm, I don't think that's an easy task. Perhaps he's the only one who could do that among those who are in the same realm."</p>

  <p>The old man with mustache glanced at the practitioner who had just succeeded and smiled slightly. He then said, "You passed! What's your name?" Then he took the writing brush and a nameplate, ready to write.</p>

  <p>"Owen Ao," said the practitioner.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing his name, the bystanders seemed to have remembered something and then shouted, "So it's him! He's the man who has killed three thousand Shadow Wolf Kings on the Woollen Grassland on his own!"</p>

  <p>"What? Killed three thousand Shadow Wolf Kings all by himself? Why didn't I hear about that?"</p>

  <p>"The Woollen Grassland is far away from the center of the Central Region.</p>

  <p>It's just common that you don't hear about it."</p>

  <p>Owen Ao just stood there and didn't mind the bystanders' chitchat. After he took the nameplate from the old man's hands, he left to sign up for the contest according to the instructions of the World Commercial Alliance.</p>

  <p>The crowd was still discussing Owen Ao when he left the place.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was now ready to take his chance. He walked up to the old man, took out a supreme life vitality crystal from his space ring and put it on the desk.</p>

  <p>"Oh my god, he is at the third grade of Illuminating Soul Realm? I am daydreaming? I can't believe it!"</p>

  <p>"Whoa! He's even richer than he looks! How can he afford a supreme life vitality crystal?"</p>

  <p>"I guess he's a brat from some third-grade family. Maybe he's just here to play and not to compete with others seriously. A supreme life vitality crystal is not cheap. He's just wasting his money!"</p>

  <p>"You bet! He might as well just donate it to the Alliance instead to save him time!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's cultivation level was so low that he created a stir when he showed up here for the pre-qualifying test. The crowd became more excited than when they were discussing about Owen Ao.</p>

  <p>Although practitioners who had reached the Illuminating Soul Realm could take part in the pre-qualifying test, only a few had truly succeeded. The magnetic stone was already a great obstacle and no one knew if there could be another test after that.</p>

  <p>Most of the practitioners who had passed the test were at the top level of the Illuminating Soul Realm and some had even reached the Internal Elixir Realm.</p>

  <p>As of to date, the number of the practitioners of the Illuminating Soul Realm who had passed the test was less than ten. Out of those who passed, most of them were already at the eighth or ninth level of Illuminating Soul Realm. That meant that they were almost the best martial artists among those who were in the same realm.</p>

  <p>But standing before them right now was a practitioner of the third-grade Illuminating Soul Realm who was about to take on the challenge. The bystanders who didn't sign up for the pre-qualifying test were just there for the drama. They wanted to see which one of the challengers would pass and which one would fail. And for them, Luo Zheng was considered rather weak and they were looking forward to seeing him fail and eventually embarrass himself.</p>
