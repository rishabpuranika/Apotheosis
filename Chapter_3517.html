<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3517 Entrusted </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Streaks of dark-red light flickered in the compound eyes of the insect man.</p>

  <p>He shuttled nimbly through the Myriad Spirits City, his heart filled with grief and indignation for his dead companions.</p>

  <p>Because the lowly Souls of Light managed to find a couple of corporeal bodies, they wanted to challenge Master Ghost Scorpion. They were merely courting death.</p>

  <p>Many ferns covered the northern part of the Myriad Spirits City.</p>

  <p>Strange races populated the Other Shore, all of them sorted into classes.</p>

  <p>The Tail Insect race lived up north, where several bug-like creatures resided.</p>

  <p>When the member of the Tail Insect race came to the northern part of the city, he headed straight into a deep cave. Various small pots hung within the cave walls, in which a variety of strange bugs were kept.</p>

  <p>When he reached the very bottom of the cave, a strange fragrance filled the space.</p>

  <p>It was the scent of the Fragrant Butterfly race. Master Ghost Scorpion was particularly fond of this fragrance. He always kept several female members of the race close by.</p>

  <p>Soon, the insect man reached the end of the path.</p>

  <p>A hoarse voice resounded. "Have you collected the Body-strengthening Jade and soul crystal as I asked?"</p>

  <p>From within the darkness, a black scorpion rested his tail on the ground. A small hook at the end of his tail reflected a harsh light, making the insect man swallow down his nerves hard.</p>

  <p>He had seen how Master Ghost Scorpion punished his subordinate before.</p>

  <p>The subordinate's skin was merely scratched by the hook before his entire body turned black. He died in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>The member of the Tail Insect race was feeling anxious about the news he had to bring back. He knew he would undoubtedly piss the Ghost Scorpion off.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied nervously.</p>

  <p>"Haha! I didn't expect the Oneness Sky Palace to endure it." The Ghost Scorpion laughed in the darkness before continuing, "Hand over the jade and soul crystal. I'll have someone else collect them another day."</p>

  <p>The Ghost Scorpion hadn't ever acted against the Oneness Sky Palace. The latter was under the protection of the Myriad Spirits City guards, after all.</p>

  <p>But the Ghost Scorpion was entrusted to continue suppressing the palace.</p>

  <p>He was determined to see how long they could endure.</p>

  <p>"But…" There was a moment of hesitation before the messenger continued,</p>

  <p>"The Oneness Sky Palace has taken back the jade and soul crystal I've collected."</p>

  <p>"What?" The Ghost Scorpion's voice turned deadly-cold. His tail curled up from where he rested on the ground.</p>

  <p>"The Oneness Sky Palace seems to have found two corporeal bodies. A human woman took action and killed my comrades. She left me alive so I could bring you the news. Master Ghost Scorpion, please uphold justice for us!" The insect man seemed grim.</p>

  <p>"Corporeal bodies? How could they have corporeal bodies?" the master asked in confusion.</p>

  <p>Because only Souls of Light were allowed to enter the Other Shore, it had been many years since he had ever seen a corporeal body. The news was truly puzzling.</p>

  <p>"It's true… My comrades wouldn't have died otherwise…" the messenger continued.</p>

  <p>A moment of silence passed before the Ghost Scorpion leaned in from the darkness. "They left you alive so that you could inform me of what happened?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's right."</p>

  <p>"Then your mission has been completed."</p>

  <p>Suddenly, his tail rose and stabbed at the messenger with incredible speed.</p>

  <p>While the sharp hook managed to slice through the messenger's body, it failed to cut his shell, leaving only a thin, invisible wound on the surface.</p>

  <p>All the messenger could see was the Ghost Scorpion wagging his tail.</p>

  <p>Realizing that he was in a highly dangerous situation, he turned around, ready to flee. But before he could even take another step, he suddenly went numb and fell to the ground, losing consciousness in an instant.</p>

  <p>In the darkness, a sturdy creature took slow steps forward.</p>

  <p>A layer of black armor covered the creature, and six pairs of eyes sat on his head. His hateful face looked strong.</p>

  <p>Standing on his feet, he positioned his long tail behind him.</p>

  <p>Two beautiful women of the Fragrant Butterfly race followed him behind.</p>

  <p>They resembled humans with their graceful bodies.</p>

  <p>"Master Ghost Scorpion, are you going to attack the Oneness Sky Palace?"</p>

  <p>The woman's voice was incredibly alluring.</p>

  <p>"Since someone entrusted me to do it, I have no other choice," replied the creature.</p>

  <p>"The Souls of Light of the Oneness Sky Palace can be killed rather easily," the woman continued. "But how should we deal with the two corporeal bodies?"</p>

  <p>The Ghost Scorpion gently flicked his tail and pierced it into the dead messenger's head. Soon after, he obtained his memory, witnessing in his mind everything that had just unfolded.</p>

  <p>The creature's lips curled into a subtle smile. "Take them as two creatures on the Other Shore."</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the stronghold of the Oneness Sky Palace</p>

  <p>Hearing Zheng's words, Abdul didn't feel relieved. Instead, he grew worried.</p>

  <p>"It's easier said than done. The Ghost Scorpion will be coming for us soon.</p>

  <p>Do you know that …"</p>

  <p>As Abdul rambled on, a cold light flashed in Feng Ge's eyes. "If you're afraid, then leave the Other Shore. If you keep talking nonsense, I won't hesitate to kill you as well."</p>

  <p>Feng Ge might not have been much of a match for Abdul in the Land of Sword Grief, but on the Other Shore, Abdul was nothing more than a fly she could squish between her palms.</p>

  <p>Abdul fell into silence, and so did the other senior disciples of the Land of Sword Grief.</p>

  <p>The Oneness Sky Palace belonged to Eastern Emperor Taiyi. Since Feng Ge took Zheng's side, what else could they say?</p>

  <p>But Zheng didn't care much about Abdul's attitude. He merely turned to the other disciples and said, "Everyone, you have reached Stage Fourteen. For safety's sake, you can temporarily withdraw from the Other Shore. I will make further plans once Feng Ge and I explore this place more thoroughly."</p>

  <p>The disciples there were rather discouraged. If they were involved in a fight, they might be trapped by something like the Soul Binding Thread, unable to escape.</p>

  <p>"Well then… Zheng, Princess Feng Ge, be careful!"</p>

  <p>"We must leave now."</p>

  <p>"…"</p>

  <p>And so one after another, the disciples' Souls of Light began to dissipate.</p>

  <p>Before withdrawing from the Other Shore, Abdul threw Zheng a fierce glare.</p>

  <p>At last, only Zheng, Feng Ge, and Dorothy were left.</p>

  <p>"Dorothy?" Zheng called out.</p>

  <p>"I'm here with you," she called back.</p>

  <p>"What?" Feng Ge said with a frown.</p>

  <p>"I didn't say that I wanted to stay with you. I am merely accompanying Zheng," Dorothy explained flatly but firmly. Though she had been rather quiet for a while, she couldn't help but throw back a retort.</p>

  <p>"You're only risking your life by staying here. You'd better leave." Feng Ge was still defiant.</p>

  <p>"Oh, really?" A mocking smile appeared on Dorothy's face. "Do you really think you're stronger than me with this corporeal body?"</p>
