<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 922 Block Malcom's Attack </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"A war sage!"</p>

  <p>Esther's eyes widened in shock. Judging from the Mu Ning emitted from Malcom's body, she figured he had already become a war sage!</p>

  <p>Fabian's and Jarrod's faces darkened immediately.</p>

  <p>Hadn't the ogres already left the Tower of Sin? How had these two ogres appeared here?</p>

  <p>The sudden appearance of these two ogres reminded them of Colin and Neil, who had also suddenly appeared out of nowhere in the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>The ogres had dominated the Tower of Sin for so many years and had grasped some secrets about the tower that no one knew about.</p>

  <p>However, as much as all the warriors were surprised, they didn't show any trace of fear on their faces. On the contrary, their breaths were steady and their auras were calm and unperturbed. Even when they were facing a war sage like Malcom, they were surprisingly composed.</p>

  <p>Ironically, it was Malcom who was slightly puzzled. A doubtful expression appeared on his face and he became alert at once.</p>

  <p>What was wrong with these guys? Why weren't they panicking at all when death was at hand?</p>

  <p>He could understand the nonchalant looks on the faces of the two freaks, Xun and Yolande. Since they were from the Upper World, their dedication to martial arts had taken them to a level that warriors from the Lower World would never be able to measure up to.</p>

  <p>For example, Yolande hadn't even considered entering the Gate of Samsara because the cultivation method in the Gate of Samsara was useless to her.</p>

  <p>She had divided her soul into a million parts so that millions of her avatars could cultivate continuously at the same time. With the experiences she would gain from all these various separate bodies combined, her method of cultivation was countless times more efficient than that of the Gate of Samsara.</p>

  <p>But why would Luo Luo Zheng and Esther be so calm?</p>

  <p>Even the usually timid Fabian and Jarrod, the two top-level war lords of the human race, looked at Malcom with indifferent expressions. What was going on?</p>

  <p>Malcom was a little disappointed and upset. He had hidden in the narrow secret passageway under the Tower of Sin for a few months, waiting for this moment to stun them all. He had expected Luo Luo Zheng and the rest to either flee in panic or kneel down and beg for mercy the moment he showed up. He'd never expected them to stand calmly without the slightest trace of shock or fear.</p>

  <p>After some thought, he sneered. "Do you think you're still in the Tower of Sin? Do you think that Luo Luo Zheng still possesses the omnipotent ability to kill anyone?"</p>

  <p>When Fabian heard Malcom's words, he calmly said, "Of course we aren't as stupid as you think we are. But since you're here, only a calm mind will help us deal with you."</p>

  <p>The thing was, Malcom didn't know that these warriors had just experienced multiple cycles of life and death. They had experienced many different lives in the Gate of Samsara and had gained deep insight on life and death. As a result, they were more strong-willed now. This was the effect of cultivation on the warrior spirit!</p>

  <p>If a person's warrior spirit was excitable, it would bring trouble at a critical moment. He wouldn't even be able to bring out his strength in a fight.</p>

  <p>For example, back when the group was being chased by something horrible, Fabian had been so terrified that he had been on the verge of collapse. He'd even lost his head and forgotten to escape. If it hadn't been for Luo Zheng's Spiritual Thorn which had stunned him for a moment, he would have died.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Yolande had been able to remain calm and think of a solution to the problem. In the end, she had used her demon sealing skill to seal that horrible thing. Thanks to her, everyone had been able to escape.</p>

  <p>The stronger a person's warrior spirit was, the more likely he would be able to remain composed in times of emergency and bring his strength into full play.</p>

  <p>Since everyone present here had cultivated in the Gate of Samsara and strengthened their warrior spirit, they were all able to be exceptionally calm now.</p>

  <p>"Deal with me? Do you think a few top-level war lords can take me on?"</p>

  <p>Malcom laughed sinisterly.</p>

  <p>Esther stared straight at Malcom. "When you were a top-level war lord, you were far from being my match. Do you think that has changed just because you've made a breakthrough and become a war sage? Are you sure you have the ability to challenge me now?"</p>

  <p>Amongst the 128 seat holders, Esther ranked the first. She was the strongest top-level war lord, while Malcom was just ranked in the middle. Even though he'd become a war sage, he was only a level one war sage. Esther still had the potential to enervate him.</p>

  <p>"Huh! Let's fight, then you'll find out whether I have the ability to challenge you or not." Malcom didn't want to waste time talking anymore. The inner circle had undergone a huge change. Even though he was a war sage, it was still very dangerous for him to stay here too long. He had to finish this battle as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>He knew clearly that he had become a daredevil from the moment he had entered the secret passage under the Tower of Sin. Now, his only goal was to kill Luo Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>The moment Luo Luo Zheng died, all the threats the ogre race was facing would be gone. The ogres would regain the power that they had enjoyed in the past.</p>

  <p>Then, the ogres would once again return to the Tower of Sin!</p>

  <p>If Malcom could kill Luo Luo Zheng and safely return to the Tower of Sin, then he would become the hero of the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place. The ogres valued honor above everything, so being the hero of the ogre race would be the supreme glory for him. He would be to the ogre race what Xun was to the Demon Night, a supreme being that no one dared to disobey.</p>

  <p>"Attack!" Malcom gave the order and started to move forward. His massive body suddenly flashed as he charged straight toward Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>As soon as Malcom made a move, Rehaan began to attack. The three top-level war lords of the Night Group also joined them in the attack.</p>

  <p>"Protect Luo Luo Zheng," Fabian said calmly. If he had faced this situation a few days ago, he would have lost his head already. But now, he looked extremely calm. Even though he knew he was no match for Malcom, he still acted in an orderly manner and managed to arrange everything in his control.</p>

  <p>Thanks to the cultivation in the Gate of Samsara, his warrior spirit had become a lot stronger.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I only just stepped into the level of war sage. And it's true that with your strength, you can even kill a common level two war sage! But don't forget that I, Malcom, am also a divine-level talent!" The forceful energy within Malcom's body suddenly burst out as a turbulent Mu Ning erupted forth.</p>

  <p>At the same time, a long saber appeared in his hands.</p>

  <p>"Evil God Slash!"</p>

  <p>Malcom unleashed his strongest attack on the first strike. He was determined to kill Luo Luo Zheng in one blow.</p>

  <p>He had only one goal in his mind and nothing else mattered. All the other people in front of him weren't important. The most important thing was to kill Luo Luo Zheng. If he could manage to kill Luo Luo Zheng, then it would be all over. As long as the ogres could control the secret at the bottom of the Tower of Sin, then with Malcom's strength as a war sage, no one in the Tower of Sin would be able to fight against them.</p>

  <p>Fabian and Jarrod raised their swords at the same time, one from the left and the other from the right. Streams of sword intent began to entangle with each other, forming spirals in the air.</p>

  <p>"Double Jade Sword Energy!"</p>

  <p>"Break!"</p>

  <p>"Kill!"</p>

  <p>"Annihilate!"</p>

  <p>"Tribulate!"</p>

  <p>Jarrod and Fabian worked closely together in an orderly fashion. Streams of profound and mysterious sword intent shot forward to counterattack Malcom's strike.</p>

  <p>However, when their sword intents met Malcom's blade, they instantly shattered into pieces!</p>

  <p>Fabian and Jarrod frowned. Usually, the two of them could deal with ordinary war sages when they worked together. It seemed that Malcom was not an ordinary war sage.</p>

  <p>"Change the moves!" Fabian shouted.</p>

  <p>The two of them continued to block Malcom's attack.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Luo Zheng wasn't just staying idle and watching them fight. Facing Malcom's saber that was coming at him, Luo Luo Zheng quickly retreated. All of a sudden, his eyes flashed and the surface of his body glowed with streaks of starlight.</p>

  <p>When Malcom used his Evil God Slash, it seemed as if there really was a fiendish evil god that was charging straight at Luo Luo Zheng. Even though Fabian and Jarrod had gone all out to block it, they couldn't stop it.</p>

  <p>Seeing that the saber had gotten enough to touch him, Luo Luo Zheng threw a punch.</p>

  <p>"Star shakes the earth!"</p>

  <p>A vortex formed by the starlight instantly engulfed the evil god unleashed by Malcom's strike.</p>

  <p>"Shatter!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng knew the power of his Stellar Body. The force of this punch would be able to kill a war sage who was at the initial level, so it should be enough for him to resist Malcom's saber.</p>

  <p>However, something strange happened. Everybody watched in horror as the fierce-looking evil god split into three just as it was about to get sucked into the vortex. Turning into three separate blade energies, it charged toward Luo Luo Zheng from three different directions.</p>

  <p>"Damn it!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's face darkened. It was obvious that he had underestimated the strength of a war sage. Or perhaps he had underestimated Malcom's strength!</p>

  <p>The ogres must have left Malcom and Rehaan behind as part of a prudent plan when they had left the Tower of Sin. It was true that Malcom had made a breakthrough to become a war sage. But it wasn't as simple as it seemed.</p>

  <p>"Huh! Shatter!"</p>

  <p>At this time, Xun thrust her spear out from the side of Luo Zheng's body, and the tip of the spear stabbed into a piece of blade energy. With a slight twist of her long spear, the blade energy was shredded into pieces.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Yolande started her finger attack, shattering another blade energy.</p>

  <p>As for the last blade energy, it was forcefully blocked by Luo Zheng's sword, a top-grade sacred weapon.</p>

  <p>Malcom was taken aback when he saw that these warriors were able to block his attack. Then, he shook his head. "You're not bad, Luo Luo Zheng. You seem to have improved a lot in the past few months and now I have to look at you with new eyes. Perhaps in another year, I will be far from being your opponent. Unfortunately for you, you're still not anywhere near being able to defeat me now. And you won't have any chance to surpass me in the future, because you're going to die today!"</p>
