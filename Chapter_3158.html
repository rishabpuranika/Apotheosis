<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng was not surprised at this result.</p>

  <p>He had learned about how it worked for the Other Shore Tokens while fusing with the Eye of Will.</p>

  <p>Not many people in the Source World had the Thousand Sanskrit Land.</p>

  <p>Zheng's inner world was strong enough to absorb all kinds of Other Shore Tokens across the thirteen stages.</p>

  <p>He could probably even absorb Other Shore Tokens from higher stages. On the flip side, he had just found out that the Soul of Light could move around freely within the thirteen stages, but couldn't easily enter the next world, which was why Other Shore Tokens from other worlds hadn't shown up in the temple.</p>

  <p>Dorothy was relieved to see that the Earth Sanskrit Plate was fully lit. But she didn't know what was going on in Zheng's inner world.</p>

  <p>She stepped onto the Earth Sanskrit Plate too.</p>

  <p>The Earth Sanskrit Plate didn't usually allow two people at the same time.</p>

  <p>But the purple Soul of Light didn't stop Dorothy as she stepped on to it.</p>

  <p>Zheng passed the green rings of light and made for the center of the Earth Sanskrit Plate.</p>

  <p>The thirteenth loop was the innermost circle of the Earth Sanskrit Plate. The three Other Shore Tokens that had been placed there were from Stage Thirteen.</p>

  <p>A black stone, a golden wine glass, and a small totem.</p>

  <p>As Dorothy looked at the three Other Shore Tokens, she asked the purple Soul of Light, "Could you please introduce them to us?"</p>

  <p>No one else held such a privilege of asking for and getting the tokens introduced to them. Everyone else had to explore the tokens by themselves after fusing with them.</p>

  <p>The purple Soul of Light nodded and replied, "This black stone was obtained from the Dark Fog Forest of Stage Thirteen. It has about 300 divine megatons of Other Shore Power stored in it. The dark mist derived from it can turn into a large quantity of poisonous miasma, which can greatly impact souls and inner worlds. That is why it is a handy auxiliary type of Other Shore Token."</p>

  <p>An Other Shore Token that had a strength of 300 divine megatons was way too powerful for the lower stages, but not for Stage Thirteen. It seemed that the most powerful part of this stone was the poisonous miasma.</p>

  <p>Zheng asked rather too eagerly, "Is it possible to fuse this stone with the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent?"</p>

  <p>The purple Soul of Light nodded. "All the Other Shore Tokens that we have collected can fuse with the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent," he said proudly.</p>

  <p>He paused to let the words sink in, and then continued, "This golden wine glass is a descending type with 100 divine megatons of Other Shore Power."</p>

  <p>"A wine glass of descending type?". Zheng looked at the golden wine glass, confused.</p>

  <p>"It can produce fine, tasty wine that can intoxicate everyone," the purple Soul of Light said, his eyes twinkling. .</p>

  <p>Zheng and Dorothy were rendered speechless by the abilities of the glass.</p>

  <p>"There are different kinds of Other Shore Tokens because we have so many races, each with a different culture. The great chef in the palace has fused with an Other Shore Token that produces a wonderfully unique spice.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, I haven't ever tasted it because I'm not qualified," the purple Soul of Light said with a soft chuckle.</p>

  <p>Dorothy knew that chef. "You mean Devon? The food he makes is outstanding!"</p>

  <p>Everyone had different tastes and wanted to be strong in different ways.</p>

  <p>The purple Soul of Light nodded before pointing to the last token and continuing with his explanation. "And finally, this totem is called the Strength God Totem and was obtained from the Ancient Totem Temple.</p>

  <p>You can tell from its name that it's a strengthening type of token. It contains 1200 divine megatons of Other Shore Power, far greater than all the Other Shore Tokens at Stage Thirteen."</p>

  <p>"1200 divine megatons!" Zheng exclaimed, shocked.</p>

  <p>In the Blue Cloud City, the Divine Lair women that had chased him had a maximum attacking power of 1, 000 divine megatons.</p>

  <p>A strengthening type of Other Shore Token had no special abilities, but the power it contained exceeded that of the other types by a large margin.</p>

  <p>The purple Soul of Light could see that Zheng was tempted by this token. He spoke again, a warning in his voice. "I wouldn't take this token if I were you."</p>

  <p>"Why not?" Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>If Zheng had absorbed this totem before, he could have combined it with the Exhausting Power back in the Blue Cloud City. That would be 6, 000 divine megatons of Other Shore Power - something that was beyond imagination!</p>

  <p>With that kind of power, he could have torn Elizabeth's Illusory Projection apart.</p>

  <p>"Even if you choose this totem, an Other Shore Power of over 1, 000 divine megatons is beyond most people's limits. One must accept the Chaotic Source Reinforcement before using that kind of power," said the purple Soul of Light.</p>

  <p>This token would be too much to bear even for those who were about to enter the Desire World. Their bodies and inner worlds would be destroyed before they could unleash the power of such a token.</p>

  <p>"Chaotic Source Reinforcement?" Zheng had never heard of it before.</p>

  <p>"The first bottleneck that we encounter in the Other Shore Realm is the limit that our body and inner world present to us," Dorothy explained.</p>

  <p>"Only after we break through this limit can we enter the Chaotic Source Realm."</p>

  <p>It wasn't that difficult to advance in the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>Having absorbed the soul crystal, Zheng could easily reach Stage Four. But with his current abilities, even Stage Six or Seven wouldn't be that hard for him, and Stages Eight and Nine were possible options as well.</p>

  <p>After Stage Thirteen, however, going forward into the Desire World was more than difficult.</p>

  <p>That was the bottleneck for the physical body and the inner world.</p>

  <p>The most powerful tokens of Stage Thirteen had a strength of about 1, 000 divine megatons, which was the limit of the physical body and the inner world. A Chaotic Source Reinforcement was needed to absorb such tokens.</p>

  <p>Once this was done, the Soul of Light had to enter the Desire World. Only then had one truly entered the Chaotic Source Realm.</p>

  <p>"One must enter the Chaotic Source Realm to choose this Strength God Totem? Does it mean that no one from the first thirteen stages can use it?"</p>

  <p>Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Some races with extremely powerful bodies can handle it. But there are also some talented people in the palace whose physical bodies are naturally much stronger than ordinary people. They can use up to 80% to 90% of its power," the purple Soul of Light answered him, subconsciously excluding Zheng from the extreme cases.</p>

  <p>Even if there was someone who could fuse with the power from the totem, that someone couldn't be Zheng. He was barely at Stage Four.</p>

  <p>"Let's look at some other options," Dorothy said.</p>

  <p>There were six Other Shore Tokens from Stage Twelve. There must be something suitable for them that they could find!</p>

  <p>But Zheng had made up his mind. "I'm going with the Strength God Totem," he said.</p>

  <p>Zheng already had the Eye of Will that was being carried by the Truth of Goodwill and Malice. He had two more Other Shore Tokens to fuse since he still had the Truth of Cultivation Nature and the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent.</p>

  <p>Using a token of strengthening type to strengthen his power would be a wise choice.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't know how strong a physical body would be after the Chaotic Source Reinforcement. But his body, with the support of the Shade Stone, should be able to use half the power that the Strength God Totem contained.</p>
