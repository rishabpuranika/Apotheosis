<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1537 Getting The Illusion Points Effortlessly </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The sounds of metal weapons clanking against each other were heard.</p>

  <p>The ground shook as about seven ogre martial artists fought against three Celestial Mice.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had killed three Celestial Mice when he had entered the cave before, but three more had appeared after.</p>

  <p>While Luo Zheng had discovered the cave a bit earlier, other martial artists came across it as well.</p>

  <p>A martial artist had probably first discovered the cave, but couldn't defeat the Celestial Mice. Thus, he returned to the main city and asked his companions for help.</p>

  <p>There were currently about seven surviving martial artists left, who all saw the Illusion Points on the ground condense into balls and float in the air. Then, the corpses of the dead martial artists gradually disappeared.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng counted the Illusion Points that turned into balls of light and estimated that there were more than ten of them. He reckoned that the Celestial Mice had killed more than ten martial artists who had been sent back to the main city to be resurrected.</p>

  <p>It was known that martial artists who killed other martial artists could absorb their fallen opponents' Illusion Points for themselves.</p>

  <p>However, the Celestial Mice didn't absorb Illusion Points. The martial artists released half their Illusion Points after they died, so the points in front of Luo Zheng didn't have an owner now.</p>

  <p>He could get these points effortlessly. There was no way he was letting them go!</p>

  <p>He moved towards the first ball of Illusion Points in a flash. He lightly touched them, and then his body easily absorbed the yellow Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the seven ogre martial artists saw what Luo Zheng did.</p>

  <p>"How dare you!" "You're courting death!"</p>

  <p>"If you dare to absorb the Illusion Points of our brothers, we will chase you all the way to the ends of the earth!"</p>

  <p>Their loud and furious shouts resonated throughout the wilderness, but they were still busy dealing with the three Celestial mice.</p>

  <p>The three Celestial Mice were still moving at a weird speed. They used their sharp front teeth to bite the ogres' bodies from time to time. Their teeth which could gnaw through the ogres' armor could be used as divine weapons. Although the ogres had thick and rough skins, they had gotten deep wounds which even revealed some of their bones.</p>

  <p>These ogres knew that treasures were hidden in the cave. However, they had to join forces since the Celestial Mice were just too strong.</p>

  <p>The sky turned a tad darker, and more than ten martial artists had been killed by now.</p>

  <p>Luckily, the Celestial Mice didn't absorb the Illusion Points. The dead martial artists were sent back to the main city by force. Then, they could just rush back to the cave and absorb their Illusion Points after they were revived.</p>

  <p>At that point, these ogres were extremely close and trusted each other.</p>

  <p>Therefore, none of them took the Illusion Points on the ground.</p>

  <p>However, a random martial artist unexpectedly appeared in the cave, and then absorbed the Illusion Points of their dead friends while they were engaged in a fierce battle. How could they endure that?</p>

  <p>"Your brothers?"</p>

  <p>Zheng's lips curled slightly when he heard their angry voices, but he didn't heed their warning. He simply continued to rush towards the clumps of Illusion Points and swiftly absorbed them.</p>

  <p>3, 000 points.</p>

  <p>8, 000 points.</p>

  <p>4, 000 points.</p>

  <p>Although there wasn't an extremely large amount of Illusion Points scattered on the ground, each one of the balls was worth a few thousand.</p>

  <p>Zheng's body continuously absorbed the light spots, and the number of Illusion Points in his body increased rapidly.</p>

  <p>He had already acquired fifty thousand Illusion Points by the time he had absorbed over ten balls of Illusion Points. Combined with his own ten thousand Illusion Points, he now had over sixty thousand.</p>

  <p>"Ahhh!"</p>

  <p>The loud, miserable scream signaled everyone that another ogre martial artist had been killed. He suffered quite a gory death since the Celestial Mice had pierced through his head.</p>

  <p>Red dots of light wrapped around his soul and flew towards the main city. Then, another ball of Illusion Points was released and floated above his body.</p>

  <p>The remaining six ogre martial artists were startled at the scene and instinctively turned to look at Luo Zheng. Was Luo Zheng going to absorb those Illusion Points as well? If he was, it was way too much!</p>

  <p>Just as when they thought about it, Luo Zheng suddenly disappeared from where he stood. He appeared next to the corpse of the dead ogre martial artist in a second, and then absorbed all the Illusion Points his body released.</p>

  <p>Indeed, the remaining six ogre martial artists were livid at the sight of Luo Zheng. They all looked like they wanted to devour Luo Zheng alive.</p>

  <p>"Kill this guy first!"</p>

  <p>"Kill him, and then deal with the Celestial Mice!"</p>

  <p>"Damn it! He's gone too far!"</p>

  <p>The six ogre martial artists abandoned the three Celestial Mice and focused on killing Luo Zheng first.</p>

  <p>Coincidentally, two of the three Celestial Mice charged at Luo Zheng at the same time.</p>

  <p>Despite the chaos, Zheng's face remained stoic. It was common for all martial artists in the Illusion Battlefield to resort to every conceivable means, and no one could blame them.</p>

  <p>After all, they fought hard for their rankings. It was a violent competition, and only the strong would remain standing at the center of the battlefield. This was what made the Illusion Battlefield significant.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, white fog began to form around Luo Zheng as both the ogre martial artists and the Celestial Mice launched combined attacks on him.</p>

  <p>"Eight Smoky Melodies!"</p>

  <p>Once again, Luo Zheng used the Eight Smoky Melodies.</p>

  <p>No one could even touch Luo Zheng when he used the Eight Smoky Melodies, no matter how fierce his opponents were.</p>

  <p>"This guy's technique is so weird!" one ogre martial artist exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Let's surround him!"</p>

  <p>"You go over there. Go behind him!"</p>

  <p>However, an even stranger scene unfolded before their eyes.</p>

  <p>The Celestial Mice were originally quite fast, and Zheng's own speed might be far from it.</p>

  <p>However, the Eight Smoky Melodies transformed Luo Zheng into a wisp of cyan smoke the moment the mice pounced towards him. If the wispy smoke sensed any movement, it would push Luo Zheng aside. The distance between Luo Zheng and the Celestial Mice had always been three inches.</p>

  <p>The ogre martial artists had noticed Zheng's accelerated speed, which was now almost equal to that of the Celestial Mice.</p>

  <p>They couldn't almost see him anymore because his speed was way too fast. How would they surround him?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng continued to display the Eight Smoky Melodies as he directed his chaotic energy to the ground, which formed a ring of mysterious white light.</p>

  <p>Before, he had used the Thunderbolt Annihilation to defeat the Celestial Mice. He did the same thing as well this time since the Celestial Mice had 3, 000 Illusion Points. The only difference now was there were some ogre martial artists involved in this fight.</p>

  <p>Not long after, a terrifying Mu Ning suddenly appeared in the sky, followed by a violent bolt of lightning. Everything within the ring of white light was baptized by the Heavenly Tribulation.</p>

  <p>The six ogre martial artists let out loud unwilling shrieks before they turned into six red specks of light, which rushed towards the main city.</p>

  <p>The three Celestial Mice also exploded and turned into numerous Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>The Illusion Points floated in the air for a moment before they finally flew towards Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>The six ogre martial artists got to make it until the end. They were much stronger than their clansmen who had been killed before, so they had more Illusion Points. Each of them had 10, 000 Illusion Points on average.</p>

  <p>Combined with the three Celestial Mice's Illusion Points, Zheng's Illusion Points had now been restored to 130, 000.</p>

  <p>"I'm pretty lucky," Luo Zheng said with a small smile as he floated gently and gazed into the distance.</p>

  <p>This supreme world contained countless main cities, and the Illusion Battlefield was divided into fifty supreme worlds. Now that he possessed the Teleportation Token, he no longer needed to return to that main city.</p>

  <p>Now was the time for him to frantically plunder the Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>However, he still had to make sure if the Teleportation Token was effective as he expected it to be.</p>

  <p>With that in mind, he took out the Teleportation Token that was forged from white jade. He then extracted a trace of chaotic energy from the chaotic sea and injected it into the token.</p>

  <p>The Teleportation Token released a faint white light the moment it was activated, which was then extinguished.</p>

  <p>A crease formed between Zheng's brow at the strange scene.</p>

  <p>"The Teleportation Token� Is it useless?"</p>

  <p>However, the Teleportation Token in his hand suddenly began to tremble violently within the next second.</p>

  <p>A powerful force was transmitted from within the Teleportation Token, and then Luo Zheng was quickly wrapped in the blazing white light. It was so bright that it was as if a small sun had risen from the wilderness.</p>

  <p>After quite a long while, the incandescent ball of white light dissipated.</p>

  <p>It was gone in a flash, and it took Luo Zheng with it from where he stood.</p>
