  <p>
</p>

  <p>In this environment where everyone could only exist in soul form, what was seen was not the actual strength of a True God...</p>

  <p>Instead, the True God put his internal momentum into the environment, letting the warrior comprehend his Divine Dao by being within this environment; in effect the warrior was within the Divine Dao!</p>

  <p>Only one single warrior guarded the isolated city, yet he was able to fight against an army of tens of thousands of soldiers with a single saber, and he successfully fended them off!</p>

  <p>There was a domineering Mu Ning contained in his ogre warrior's body that made his foes tremble with fear.</p>

  <p>After the attack, not a single soldier from the ogre army was left standing.</p>

  <p>Of course, Luo Luo Zheng was the only one who succeeded in dodging the saber strike, though he had to hurl himself to the ground to avoid the deadly swing.</p>

  <p>But the moment Luo Luo Zheng got up from the ground, the ogre warrior's gaze fell on him!</p>

  <p>Under the scrutiny of this ogre warrior, Luo Luo Zheng felt a tremendous pressure build inside his very soul!</p>

  <p>"Why don't you lie down!"</p>

  <p>Even Luo Zheng's soul trembled uncontrollably when the ogre warrior roared at him in a voice like thunder.</p>

  <p>However, there was a resolute expression in Luo Zheng's eyes as he swallowed heavily and replied coolly, "I didn't lose either of my legs, so naturally I wouldn't lie down."</p>

  <p>"If you don't want to lie down, then you will kneel down!"</p>

  <p>"Swoosh!"</p>

  <p>The ogre warrior swung the long blade in his hand and pointed it at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Then the large saber moved downward with a fearsome sound.</p>

  <p>The saber did not cut into Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng instantly felt a strong pressure building behind his shoulders and trying to force him down!</p>

  <p>Under the oppression of this enormous power, Luo Zheng's knees felt weak and limp. A fierce and domineering Mu Ning was contained within this pressure, and it was as if a mountain was pressing down on Luo Zheng's body. How could he possibly withstand this?</p>

  <p>At this moment, Luo Luo Zheng was in his soul form, and the power of this pressure was not a true physical power. Therefore, he could not use the power of the dragon scales to resist it.</p>

  <p>"Kneel down and submit to me!" the ogre warrior shouted.</p>

  <p>The saber kept on moving downward, and the pressure also increased tremendously. Naturally, the force that Luo Luo Zheng used to bear up against it also increased accordingly!</p>

  <p>In the face of such strength, Luo Luo Zheng still stood firmly on the spot with his legs planted. The pressure mounted, and his feet were being pressed deeper into the illusionary soil as the pressure threatened to overwhelm him. His eyes were fixed intently on the ogre warrior without a hint of compromise on his face. There was no give, no surrender, and no yielding in Luo Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>"I do not kneel to the heavens or to the earth. I have nothing that I should feel guilty about in my life, so how could I kneel in front of you?" Luo Luo Zheng coldly said, gritting his teeth, while still standing upright.</p>

  <p>The ogre warrior sneered. "If you don't kneel down, then you have to die!"</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>The large saber swung out again!</p>

  <p>An incredibly intense blade energy carried the formidable momentum of the weapon as it hacked down towards Luo Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>"Humph!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng retaliated with tit for tat, giving as good as he was getting.</p>

  <p>The huge sword that he had taken from an ogre soldier was too large for him to physically swing, but in this soul level battle, it was firstly a fight based on Mu Ning, and Luo Luo Zheng had a formidable Mu Ning!</p>

  <p>He also launched a sword counter-attack!</p>

  <p>"Zing!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's sword intent lashed out and collided with the thick blade energy of the True God, but it was instantly annihilated. The strengths of the two warriors were obviously not on the same level! Luo Luo Zheng was sorely outmatched!</p>

  <p>When he saw this, Luo Zheng's eyes narrowed and he retreated dozens of feet back.</p>

  <p>The moment he backed away, the expression in his eyes changed. The emotions in his eyes disappeared, and were replaced with extreme coldness!</p>

  <p>"Gods-intimidating Strike!"</p>

  <p>"Swoosh!"</p>

  <p>The Gods-intimidating Strike was originally a sword technique that could be performed by means of a soul level comprehension.</p>

  <p>Now that Luo Luo Zheng was in a soul state, it meant that he could fully ignore his physical body, while wielding the sword strike. The Gods-intimidating Strike had to be executed in a completely emotionless state, and this sword move was even purer!</p>

  <p>"Zwang!"</p>

  <p>When the enormous blade energy collided with Luo Zheng's sword intent, a muffled sound ruptured forth.</p>

  <p>Although this sword intent was small, it was powerful enough to destroy everything. After this collision, a crack appeared which ran along the blade energy.</p>

  <p>When the crack had spread to Luo Zheng's side, he drilled through the crack.</p>

  <p>"Huh?"</p>

  <p>This time, it was the ogre warrior who was surprised.</p>

  <p>Being a True God's mark, he did not have the strength of a True God.</p>

  <p>However, when he had launched the saber attack, the overbearing Mu Ning of the saber had been displayed to the extreme. Yet, it was easily fractured by this junior in front of him!</p>

  <p>"Swish!"</p>

  <p>The ogre warrior lashed down at Luo Luo Zheng once again, and again the weapon's song could be heard in the air.</p>

  <p>It was another potent saber energy attack!</p>

  <p>Facing the oncoming blade energy, Luo Luo Zheng swung the huge sword in his hand once again, chopping at the blade energy!</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng broke the blade energy of the ogre warrior's saber for a second time, the ogre warrior laughed out loud. He sheathed his long saber next to his body and suddenly, taking a step forward, rushed straight towards Luo Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>Seeing the ogre warrior rushing towards him, Luo Luo Zheng still appeared indifferent. His long sword circled in the air with a glittering arc and once again stabbed towards that ogre warrior!</p>

  <p>"Gods-intimidating Strike!"</p>

  <p>Even the mark of the True God was truly invincible and would never be defeated by Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, the Corridor of the Emperor was after all only a test. All that Luo Luo Zheng could do was to display his full strength.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng believed that if he was unable to pass through this Corridor of Emperor, then perhaps no any other warrior could pass through the Illusion Battlefield. Besides when he had passed the first torch, that woman called Hannah did not fight against him. This was ultimately a test of his skills and comprehension related to the Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>"Clang!"</p>

  <p>When the saber and sword clashed together, a crisp sound issued forth.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng abruptly retreated several steps again, and he launched the sword strike with no sign of giving up!</p>

  <p>"Gods-intimidating Strike!"</p>

  <p>The Gods-intimidating Strike only had one sword technique which was a simple but extremely powerful move.</p>

  <p>When abandoning all emotions, the warrior would be able to break ten thousand other moves with this one pure sword strike.</p>

  <p>In the past, Supreme Lord Sword had been able to contend with a True God with the strength of a Supreme Lord. The might of this sword strike was truly formidable and yielded victories that were unparalleled!</p>

  <p>"Clang!"</p>

  <p>"Clang!"</p>

  <p>"Clang!"</p>

  <p>As the sword and saber continuously collided, the surprise in the ogre warrior's eyes intensified.</p>

  <p>Ever since the opening of the Corridor of Emperor, many arrogant young warriors had tried to defeat him and pass through the place which he guarded...</p>

  <p>Making those young warriors kneel down had never been a simple matter for the ogre warrior. Some warriors had possessed skills and talent, though they all submitted after one or two moves.</p>

  <p>However, no one had ever launched so many strikes while fighting against him. Moreover, he discovered that the sword intent that Luo Luo Zheng wielded contained an Mu Ning that was not much weaker than the Mu Ning which his own saber emitted!</p>

  <p>In the eyes of this mark of the True God, this was a miraculous feat.</p>

  <p>After all, his saber contained an overbearing power, on which he had relied to follow the Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>How could a mere Soul Sea Realm warrior offer such resistance with just one sword move?</p>

  <p>"What kind of sword technique have you practiced?" the ogre warrior coldly demanded.</p>

  <p>"Don't you know it?" Luo Luo Zheng smiled slightly, and the long sword in his hand slashed out once again. "If you want to learn this sword strike, I can teach you!"</p>

  <p>"Clang!"</p>

  <p>The ogre warrior's saber and Luo Zheng's sword collided releasing a shower of sparks.</p>

  <p>"Great! You are even crazier and more confident than I was in the past!"</p>

  <p>When he heard Luo Zheng's words, the ogre warrior howled with laughter, instead of getting angry, and a look of admiration appeared in his eyes.</p>

  <p>However, the giant sword in Luo Zheng's hand suddenly shattered upon the next collision.</p>

  <p>The giant sword that Luo Luo Zheng had held was just a mediocre weapon, and it had instantly broken into pieces this time...</p>

  <p>When the ogre warrior impassively watched this scene, he took advantage of it and rushed forward. His goal was not to kill Luo Luo Zheng, though.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, he raised his long saber, and a sword shot towards Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"I don't believe that you can break this move of mine! Take up your sword!"</p>

  <p>As he finished speaking, the ogre warrior suddenly slashed his long saber up towards the sky!</p>

  <p>One slash! Two slashes! Three slashes...</p>

  <p>The thick dark clouds in the sky were all shredded by his saber energy!</p>

  <p>After these last few slashes, the ogre warrior coldly said, "The saber is the overlord, and what I have pursued throughout my life is the domineering momentum of an overlord. I have relied on my saber to reach the Domineering Divine Dao! And I have also acquired the unrivalled Godly Tile! My name is Reggie!"</p>

  <p>After he had finished speaking, the thick clouds were sliced apart and separated. A ray of sunlight pierced through the clouds.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the invisible blade energy descended from the sky, and gathered all over Luo Zheng's body!</p>

  <p>"Buzz, buzz, buzz..."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, on the other hand, pointed his sword at the sky, remaining calm.</p>

  <p>The blade energy was extremely remarkable and potent as it fused with the heaven and earth. However, under this suppression, Luo Luo Zheng remained unmoved.</p>

  <p>Emotion Closing meant to sever all emotions and become nothing!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was actually in a moment of extreme humbleness, and he was insignificant in the face of the blade energy descending from the sky; however, he gave others the feeling that he looked down on all living creatures. Even the strongest pressure was ignored by Luo Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>"Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh..."</p>

  <p>Countless streaks of blade energy descended, surging chaotically around Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The blade energy gushed out like the turbulent current of a river, while Luo Luo Zheng was like a boulder in the middle of the river, standing tall and unmoving. The gushing currents could not make Luo Luo Zheng move even a bit, and they had to split upon him and separate in two directions...</p>

  <p>After a long time, the thick clouds in the sky started to gather together again.</p>

  <p>There was no more blade energy descending from the sky anymore...</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stared at the True God called Reggie. He had finally withdrawn from the state of Emotion Closing, and his eyes looked a bit brighter!</p>

  <p>After Reggie noticed the change in Luo Luo Zheng, he laughed loudly with a note of regret in his voice. "You're not suitable for my Divine Dao! Furthermore, you already have your own Divine Dao; but, the Divine Dao that you seek to cultivate is destined to be a waste of effort!"</p>

  <p>"Why?" Luo Luo Zheng asked in confusion, after hearing Reggie's damning words.</p>
