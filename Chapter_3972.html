<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked at the leader of the Arrow Demons indifferently. Then, he stretched out his right hand in a flash.</p>

  <p>Before the leader could even try to beg for mercy, he was smashed into a cloud of blood.</p>

  <p>The leader might've been dead, but the eye of the Heavenly Eye Vine still floated around.</p>

  <p>"Can you speak?" Luo Zheng asked, staring at the eye.</p>

  <p>The eye just stared back at him blankly, as though it were dead. The vines that had been attacking Luo Zheng now too were motionless.</p>

  <p>"If you are playing dead, then you can go to hell." Luo Zheng then clenched his fists, poised to strike.</p>

  <p>As the eye sensed that it was in grave danger, a purple vine as thick as a finger suddenly extended towards Luo Zheng. When it touched him, a strand of consciousness was transmitted to him. "Yes, I can speak. Please don't hurt me."</p>

  <p>The voice sounded like a human woman's. Moreover, it sounded very weak.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng could sense that the Heavenly Eye Vine had a strong desire to live.</p>

  <p>"You were trying to kill us just now. What makes you think you deserve to live?" Luo Zheng asked harshly.</p>

  <p>The situation in the Three Purities Stage was extremely chaotic. Even the Element Spirit Civilization did not implement any rules here. Although the creatures of different races were intelligent, they followed the law of the jungle: kill, or be killed.</p>

  <p>"It's those damned Arrow Demons that wanted to kill you. They enslaved me. I had no choice but to follow their orders," the Heavenly Eye Vine said to Luo Zheng, trying to disassociate itself from the killing.</p>

  <p>"I see... So, how to enslave you?" Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>The big eye of the Heavenly Eye Vine trembled. Of course, it didn't want to be enslaved by Luo Zheng. It just wanted him to let it go.</p>

  <p>"Tell me," Luo Zheng urged.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Eye Vine realized that it couldn't fool Luo Zheng. A vine grew from its eye. The vine extended towards Luo Zheng to reveal a small tender sprout on its tip.</p>

  <p>"This sprout is my source of life," the Heavenly Eye Vine admitted.</p>

  <p>Although it was a plant, it was good at discerning people. It knew that if it refused to tell Luo Zheng, then Luo Zheng would kill it on the spot.</p>

  <p>In order to survive, how could it dare to hide anything?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng reached out his hand to touch the source of life of the Heavenly Eye Vine, and he could feel its vigorous life energy. He could even read its memories. The Heavenly Eye Vine spoke the truth. This small sprout indeed controlled its life and death.</p>

  <p>Carefully holding the sprout, Luo Zheng immediately left the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>The people in the Li Shan mountain were still a little worried, and Gerald was on standby, just in case Luo Zheng was in need of replenished life energy.</p>

  <p>But as they watched, they could see Luo Zheng was handling things well on his own. So everybody waited quietly.</p>

  <p>Although they knew clearly how powerful Luo Zheng was, the creatures in the Three Purities Stage on the Other Shore had different methods. In addition to sucking Luo Zheng's life energy, there were many other methods. Naturally, they were still a little worried.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Luo Zheng didn't make them wait too long. After a while, he woke up.</p>

  <p>"How's everything going?" Fuxi asked first.</p>

  <p>"I have taken care of them," Luo Zheng replied calmly.</p>

  <p>Everyone looked at him expectantly.</p>

  <p>The Arrow Demons had been guarding the place where they left the Other Shore, and their deadly Jade Bone Arrows were a force to be reckoned with.</p>

  <p>It was likely that Luo Zheng was forcefully pulled to the Other Shore by the Gear race or the other races. It was not easy to eliminate all those creatures.</p>

  <p>"All the creatures have been killed?" the Snake Goddess clarified.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled. "I think so. But there is one thing left. Follow me, and you will know what it is."</p>

  <p>Then, he returned to the Other Shore, closely followed by the Snake Goddess, King Ieuan and the other three Eternal Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>When they saw the winding Heavenly Eye Vine, they eyed it vigilantly, ready to attack if need be. The Heavenly Eye Vine and the Arrow Demons had lived together for quite a long time. Although it was not powerful, it was still quite troublesome to deal with it.</p>

  <p>Splash! Splash!</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Eye Vine's head looped around a bit before it extended towards the Snake Goddess and Fuxi. Then, Luo Zheng popped out from above and said excitedly, "Please, come up!"</p>

  <p>"Come up?" Ying frowned.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess trusted Luo Zheng. She then jumped onto the vine. "I heard that all the Arrow Demons are blind. Their invincible archery technique relies on the eye of the Heavenly Eye Vine. Today is the first time I've seen this eye."</p>

  <p>The Arrow Demons were tyrannical. Normally, few creatures could get close to them, so even the Snake Goddess didn't know that much about them.</p>

  <p>After everyone climbed onto the vine, Luo Zheng used the big eye to look around.</p>

  <p>The eye had good eyesight, and it could see everything within a radius of ten thousand miles.</p>

  <p>On the other side of the Flaming Maple Forest, there was some sort of a commotion. Upon a closer look, Luo Zheng realized many flying snakes with transparent wings were heading straight for him.</p>

  <p>On the southwest side, dozens of tall and sturdy bull-headed men carried golden axes and were steadily making their way over.</p>

  <p>On the northwest side...</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng surveyed his surroundings for a while, his expression grew serious. He even saw the two remaining kings from the Land of Diabolic Demons.</p>

  <p>The creatures in the Grand Pure Realm were not easy to deal with. They each had an extraordinary ability. It had taken Luo Zheng a lot of energy to deal with the Arrow Demons alone. If these creatures were to besiege Luo Zheng and his group, the situation would look dim.</p>

  <p>"Go north!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng ordered the Heavenly Eye Vine.</p>

  <p>Although the Heavenly Eye Vine was only a plant, it moved surprisingly fast.</p>

  <p>Previously, it was over a hundred miles away from Luo Zheng, but it carried a group of Arrow Demons and rushed to him very quickly.</p>

  <p>Splash! Splash!</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Eye Vine didn't dare to disobey Luo Zheng. It sent a message to Luo Zheng, telling him and his group to hold onto it.</p>

  <p>Then the ground began to tremble, and the thick vine drilled into the ground and quickly moved north.</p>

  <p>However, despite the Heavenly Eye Vine's speed, it was still unable to evade the watchers in the sky. Two Shadow Warriors flew in the air, following closely behind them.</p>

  <p>The three members of the Element Spirit race, Claire, Les and Slade, had all seen what had just happened.</p>

  <p>"It's meaningless to have sent those good-for-nothings," Les sneered.</p>

  <p>"That's not necessarily the case," said Claire, shaking her head. "The Arrow Demons are very powerful. If it weren't for the Chaos Ancient God of the life truth, they would have already..."</p>

  <p>At first, she wanted to say that they would have a slim chance of survival, but on second thought, she felt it was inappropriate to say so.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's bloodline was too strange. Every time he was pushed to the limit, something unexpected would happen.</p>

  <p>Staring at Luo Zheng in the ice silently, Slade suddenly said, "Since they keep heading north, they plan to enter the Supreme Pure Realm through the Whining Road."</p>

  <p>He pointed at the ice and a map appeared on it.</p>

  <p>"The Whining Road?"</p>

  <p>"Sounds reasonable."</p>

  <p>Both Les and Claire were very surprised. There were many roads leading to the Supreme Pure Realm, and the Element Spirit Civilization could easily pass through thirteen of them, excluding the Whining Road. It was known to all that this road was not easy to pass.</p>
