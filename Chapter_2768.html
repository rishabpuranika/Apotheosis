  <p>
</p>

  <p>The force of primitive fear hidden in the undercurrents immediately engulfed Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Even if Luo Zheng was unable to detect the unknown creatures with his spiritual sense, he could still feel them rapidly closing in on him.</p>

  <p>Sword Chen had told him that even the most powerful fiends weren't a match for these unknown creatures, and that even a Holy Being would die when faced against them.</p>

  <p>So there was no way that Luo Zheng would be able to fight against them, especially with his current strength!</p>

  <p>As the unknown creatures moved around, a strong force of primitive fear passed along the undercurrents.</p>

  <p>The whole time, Luo Zheng's heart kept beating wildly. He felt as if he had fallen into an ice cellar; it was difficult for him to move even an inch.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Sword Chen was getting farther and farther away from him until the golden light in his hand completely disappeared, leaving Luo Zheng wrapped in endless darkness and fear.</p>

  <p>Just then, when he had almost lost all hope, he remembered something. 'The Scorching Gold!'</p>

  <p>Earlier, Sword Chen had handed a piece of Scorching Gold to Luo Zheng just in case. Now was the time to use it.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng immediately conjured up the triangular golden object in his hand.</p>

  <p>Although his body was as stiff as a statue, he gritted his teeth and forced a strand of internal momentum out of his body and guided it into the Scorching Gold.</p>

  <p>Fizz!</p>

  <p>The moment the Scorching Gold was activated, it had a wonderful reaction with the power of his internal momentum.</p>

  <p>A warm current instantly swept through his body, expelling the terrible force of primitive fear.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>Scared of the golden light, the unknown creatures that had gathered around him rapidly retreated in all directions.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng's intuition was correct, the nearest unknown creature to him had been less than a foot away just now!</p>

  <p>'How dangerous...' he thought to himself as he breathed a sigh of relief, tightening his grip on the Scorching Gold.</p>

  <p>However, the golden light emitted by the Scorching Gold could only stop the unknown creatures from approaching, not drive them away altogether.</p>

  <p>The Devils hiding in the dark water were still lingering around as close as they could.</p>

  <p>Waah!</p>

  <p>With a strange sound that resembled a baby's cry, powerful spiral currents poured down from above him.</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish! Swish!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng jerked his head forward, and a great counterforce pushed him backward.</p>

  <p>At the same time, he unleashed the Water Resisting Technique, and his speed suddenly increased, making him look like a dashing swordfish in the water.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>He successfully retreated before the spiral currents could sweep him away.</p>

  <p>However, this was only a momentary relief; the water was pitch black, and Luo Zheng couldn't find a way out at all.</p>

  <p>"What should I do now?"</p>

  <p>In a moment of desperation, Luo Zheng transmitted his voice through chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>There was not much distance between Luo Zheng and Sword Chen, so Sword Chen could still hear his voice.</p>

  <p>"Move upward! I'll distract the Devils!"</p>

  <p>This was the only instruction that Sword Chen gave to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>At this moment, all he could do was to ask Luo Zheng to leave the depths of the dark water first. He would try to find him later after he escaped from the dangers.</p>

  <p>This was the only option for them. They both had to save themselves for now.</p>

  <p>Even Nicholas, who had been well-prepared, had still been troubled by the Soul Devouring Bugs and the little fiends.</p>

  <p>After all, this was the Abyss Demon Region. And Luo Zheng and Sword Chen were in the Sea of Meditation, no less.</p>

  <p>'Upward?' Luo Zheng thought to himself.</p>

  <p>There were still many narrow spiral currents shooting down from above him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng knew that a Devil was above him. And judging by the direction of the spiral currents, he could even guess the exact location of the Devil.</p>

  <p>But what was the use of that?</p>

  <p>The Devil was a named unknown creature, but it was actually a power of fear. Luo Zheng might be able to fight against other creatures, but he couldn't fight against fear itself.</p>

  <p>"I have to go all out!"</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, Luo Zheng made up his mind.</p>

  <p>The spiral currents were indeed powerful. If they pierced through his body, it was likely that they could even destroy his soul.</p>

  <p>Luckily, he still had a trump card up his sleeve. It was the Latent Theurgy, the Wind Cloud Escape. He believed that this would be enough to save his life even if he was in the jaws of death.</p>

  <p>This was one of the reasons that he dared to go all out.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>With a twist of his body, Luo Zheng rushed upward vertically.</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish! Swish!</p>

  <p>Numerous narrow currents quickly formed and shot down toward him.</p>

  <p>"Gods-intimidating Strike!"</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng moved upward, he swung the Shadow Bearing Sword above his head, and streaks of sword radiance spurted out of the sword.</p>

  <p>After repelling a few spiral currents, Luo Zheng managed to elude the first wave of attacks from the Devil.</p>

  <p>For the first time in a while, he was overjoyed. It seemed that he still had a chance to escape.</p>

  <p>As he swam rapidly, he predicted that the second wave of attacks would come from the parallel direction, or even from below.</p>

  <p>But contrary to his expectations, many spiral currents gathered above his head once again.</p>

  <p>It seemed that the Devil could move at a much faster speed than Luo Zheng had imagined. No matter how fast he was, the creature always remained above him.</p>

  <p>'The second wave of attacks is coming!'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng abruptly twisted his body and launched several more strikes.</p>

  <p>This time, however, he was not that lucky. The spiral currents that shot down were very narrow and dense, perfectly avoiding the sword radiance that Luo Zheng had unleashed.</p>

  <p>Puff! Puff! Puff! dozens of spiral currents instantly hit Luo Zheng's shoulders, arms, and legs.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>Each spiral current directly penetrated his body, breaking all the bones in his limbs.</p>

  <p>'The currents seem to be aiming for my limbs on purpose...'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng noted leisurely.</p>

  <p>He was not that worried as he still had the Latent Theurgy up his sleeve.</p>

  <p>'The Devil doesn't seem to have any intention of killing me...'</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng arrived at this conclusion, he heard the sound of water flowing and splashing above his head.</p>

  <p>This time, a huge current was sweeping down toward him.</p>

  <p>Unlike before, Luo Zheng couldn't just twist his body and escape from the approaching danger? all his limbs were broken. And even though Luo Zheng's physical recovery ability was amazing, it would still take some time for him to recover.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>A few moments later, he found himself caught up in the huge current.</p>

  <p>The current didn't hurt him at all, but it continued to roll down, carrying him deeper into the water.</p>

  <p>'Where is it taking me?' Luo Zheng wondered.</p>

  <p>Gripping the Scorching Gold tightly in his hand, he quickly released his spiritual sense.</p>

  <p>With his spiritual sense, he learned that he was four thousand feet from the bottom of the Sea of Meditation. He was now diving at a very fast speed.</p>

  <p>'It couldn't be planning on letting me crash and die, right?' Luo Zheng was confused.</p>

  <p>However, now that he had calmed down, he really wanted to see what the unknown creatures wanted to do to him.</p>

  <p>At the speed the current was taking him, the distance of four thousand feet passed in almost the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng hit the seabed, he felt something soft on his shoulders. The seabed suddenly collapsed, and a large hole with a diameter of more than a thousand feet appeared!</p>
