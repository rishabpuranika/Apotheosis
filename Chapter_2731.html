</p>

  <p>Once Samuel hid in the space channel, all the Soul Devouring Bugs lost their target almost immediately.</p>

  <p>They crashed into each other, entangled into a thick purple mist, and floated in a frenzy at the entrance of the space channel.</p>

  <p>It took a long time for them to leave.</p>

  <p>"It is just as Lowell predicted."</p>

  <p>"It looks like we can't release any spiritual sense in this place."</p>

  <p>"The purple bugs won't harm us as long as we don't release our spiritual senses."</p>

  <p>People were relieved as they watched the bugs leave.</p>

  <p>Samuel emerged from the space channel after a while.</p>

  <p>By this time, the purple bugs had forgotten who their target was and left him alone.</p>

  <p>It was obvious that these Soul Devouring Bugs were unintelligent and had a pretty useless memory.</p>

  <p>"Thank you so much, Samuel!" said Nicholas gratefully.</p>

  <p>Samuel laughed and nodded. "Don't mention it. We must fight at our best together in the Abyss Demon Region."</p>

  <p>"That's right. We grossly underestimated this forbidden land before. And now, it looks like we can't survive if we don't work together," Zeke echoed.</p>

  <p>Samuel was smiling but his mind was elsewhere.</p>

  <p>Logic dictated that the Soul Devouring Bugs wouldn't appear at the third stage of the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>These strange little bugs usually presented themselves at the core of the fourth stage.</p>

  <p>There was a special kind of moss in the fourth stage called the Death Tundra that contained a kind of strong soul power called the soul moss.</p>

  <p>These Soul Devouring Bugs then ate the soul moss.</p>

  <p>The appearance of such a large number of Soul Devouring Bugs at the third stage meant that there must be people who were unleashing their spiritual senses to attract these bugs.</p>

  <p>Only the fiends in the Abyss Demon Region could probably do this.</p>

  <p>They should have noticed the movement of these Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>The fiends didn't allow anyone else to control the Abyss Demon Region, and they wouldn't sit still and wait for death.</p>

  <p>This was probably the first wave of attacks that they had planned, or perhaps they were merely flying a kite.</p>

  <p>The True Gods were unable to release their spiritual senses. To them, it was like a mortal losing his or her eyes.</p>

  <p>What was more, the entire area was covered in the purple mist, blotting out the sky and covering the sun. It had also blocked the True Gods' ability to see through their spiritual senses.</p>

  <p>"Don't fly too fast and too high. A height of one hundred feet is okay.</p>

  <p>Let's go through the purple mist together," Nicholas shouted a command.</p>

  <p>The others nodded, composed themselves, and flew up to join him in silence.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh..."</p>

  <p>And then, the group of over a hundred people flew forward in silence.</p>

  <p>The warriors from the divine land had reached the third stage of the Abyss Demon Region before and had found that it had been the limit beyond which they couldn't proceed.</p>

  <p>A few Holy Beings had descended here before, but they didn't use the space channel that Tianming mentioned. But the moment they had landed, they had been fiercely attacked, leaving them with no choice but to retreat.</p>

  <p>That was why many consummate True Gods and Demi-holy Beings were feeling uncertain. They were not alone, though. Even a few Holy Beings shared this emotion with them.</p>

  <p>The only thing that could bring any calm to the Holy Beings was that they could revive themselves with the help of their own universes. Even if they died in the Abyss Demon Region, as long as their universes were not destroyed, they could come back. This was why they weren't too worried about coming here with Nicholas.</p>

  <p>They had been flying in the purple mist for more than two hours now.</p>

  <p>Even though they deliberately slowed down, they had still traveled over a hundred thousand miles. But they still hadn't escaped the purple mist.</p>

  <p>"Something seems to be wrong, Nicholas. Why are there so many bugs?"</p>

  <p>Murphy said, worried.</p>

  <p>Nicholas frowned as he looked at the mist and said, "You're right. There really is something wrong."</p>

  <p>No matter how many bugs there were, it should be impossible for them to spread over such a wide area.</p>

  <p>Usually, once the warriors had unleashed their spiritual senses, they could immediately tell where they were and what was around them.</p>

  <p>Now no one could release the spiritual sense and no one could tell where they were. All they could do was fly ahead.</p>

  <p>"I've entered the third stage of the Abyss Demon Region before but have never seen a purple mist as this. Nicholas, do you think the mist is the work of the fiends?" Jeremiah said after he had pondered over everything for a while.</p>

  <p>It was easy for them to understand, given that they were smart Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>They had made such a big move this time in the forbidden land, and the fiends wouldn't just stay calm.</p>

  <p>"I think so," Nicholas said thoughtfully, nodding at Jeremiah's words. He narrowed his eyes dangerously.</p>

  <p>The fiends were powerful, but he would rather face them directly than deal with them in such a tricky array.</p>

  <p>If the purple mist was truly a conspiracy of the fiends, he must find a way to lure them out.</p>

  <p>At this thought, Nicholas said, "We've been flying for a long time. Let's have a rest here."</p>

  <p>"Rest now?"</p>

  <p>"It's too dangerous to rest within the purple mist."</p>

  <p>"Do as Holy Nicholas says. He must have a plan."</p>

  <p>Some consummate True Gods murmured to themselves.</p>

  <p>They had immense reserves of physical strength, so they could fly like this for a few years. But now that Nicholas was suggesting rest, they were quite confused.</p>

  <p>Still, no one dared disobey Nicholas.</p>

  <p>So they descended from midair.</p>

  <p>Rachelle, Troy, and Shahn gathered together, tensed.</p>

  <p>This damned place was beyond their power. If they hadn't been careful enough, they would have been killed first as they were consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>However, the Holy Beings could not control the forbidden lands. It was a great risk, but they were unwilling to give up.</p>

  <p>All they could do was wait. And as long as they didn't release their spiritual senses, they would be safe against the purple bugs.</p>

  <p>Two hours passed.</p>

  <p>Four hours.</p>

  <p>Twenty hours.</p>

  <p>Everyone stood still in their places.</p>

  <p>They were bored after such a long period of meditation. It was a test of patience for these strong warriors.</p>

  <p>On the other side of the Abyss Demon Region...</p>

  <p>A red-skinned creature squatted on a rock in the middle of the surging lava lake.</p>

  <p>He was only half as tall as the average person and had an ugly mouth, not unlike that of a strange monkey.</p>

  <p>Though he didn't look like other fiends that were physically strong, he was a more intelligent fiend.</p>

  <p>"The Soul Devouring Bugs might leave if they don't move for a long time," the fiend said, his eyebrows furrowed.</p>

  <p>Even the fiends could not command the Soul Devouring Bugs.</p>

  <p>It had taken them a lot of effort to get the Soul Devouring Bugs here from the fourth stage.</p>

  <p>If the Soul Devouring Bugs failed to find the soul food for a long time, they would all dissipate and return to the Death Tundra.</p>

  <p>"How cunning they are!" the fiend sighed and raised an arm. "We can't wait any longer. Let's attack!" he said sharply.</p>
