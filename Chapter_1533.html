<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>This great Buddha was rather seemingly lost in thought for a moment.</p>

  <p>In reality, Zheng did not, in any way, utilized the Gods-intimidating Strike at the given circumstance, though after practicing the Gods-intimidating Strike for years, Zheng had become proficient in that sword skill like it was a piece of cake. And with time, his heart gradually discarded a lot of intense emotions.</p>

  <p>But in spite of everything, he couldn't afford still to sever or detach all of his emotions outright. Since this was the case, his execution of the Gods-intimidating Strike was nowhere to be perfect.</p>

  <p>Even though he had never put to use the Gods-intimidating Strike for all these years, there was still a lingering trace of ruthlessness hidden within his sword attacks. This ruthlessness didn't escape the great Buddha's notice. And he even further realized that what Zheng learned and practiced before was the Emotion Closing Godly Way.</p>

  <p>Traces of chaotic energy were forcefully extracted out by Zheng from the chaotic sea.</p>

  <p>The strands of chaotic energy had transformed swiftly into lightning and wind blades that scattered freely in every direction. There were even Nether God Shadows that appeared among them.</p>

  <p>Squarely confronting the four arhats for merely fifteen seconds, Zheng was quick as he charged towards one of the Taming Tiger Arhats as the light in his eyes flickered.</p>

  <p>The four arhats undoubtedly could take the lightning and wind blades from the Thunder Wind Divine Sword by carrying out violent and forceful palm counterattacks. However, having reached their limits now, they were on the verge of losing their edge. Their moves looked finely exquisite, but still, there were flaws discernible in one's naked eye.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes were too sharp to let their flaws go unnoticed. Taking advantage of this, he rushed closer to the arhat in no time.</p>

  <p>He was rushing head-on as fast as lightning.</p>

  <p>Zheng had already positioned his palm fluidly flat on the arhat's chest long before the latter realized what was going on.</p>

  <p>"Break!"</p>

  <p>With Zheng uttering the single word, a loud bang rang out as a distinct handprint appeared on the firm chest of the Taming Tiger Arhat. And within just seconds, the cracks, surrounding the handprint, quickly spread out covering the entire arhat's body.</p>

  <p>Though Zheng launched his attack a bit later than his opponents, his one powerful strike had defeated one of the arhats in a matter of split seconds. The wind blades smashed the arhat, and directly blew away the rubble.</p>

  <p>After successfully shattering the arhat statue in front of him, Zheng did not stop himself for a moment. His deft figure lightly spun around, and the long sword hanging by his side suddenly moved in up thrust motion, sweeping out a dazzling sword light in the air. He then surged towards another Taming Tiger Arhat next to him.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The blazing sword light instantly engulfed the Taming Tiger Arhat wholly.</p>

  <p>The arhat had been throwing several powerful palm shadows towards Zheng, but its movement froze midway. The moment Zheng turned his back to dash towards the next arhat, fine thin cracks had appeared and also spread out instantly on the arhat's body, breaking it into smooth pieces.</p>

  <p>"Pah! Pah!"</p>

  <p>The remaining two Taming Tiger Arhats no longer posed a threat to Zheng, so finishing them off would be so easy, like hitting the nail on the head!</p>

  <p>Soon after, the four arhat statues were all destroyed. But Zheng went forth without a stop as if he got a second wind.</p>

  <p>For him, this was already the seventeenth adytum.</p>

  <p>Passing the tests en route wasn't that particularly dangerous, but it was too consuming in terms of time and strength.</p>

  <p>Currently, Zheng had even stronger expectations. He began wondering what kind of reward he would receive after making it through with this trial. The succeeding adytum was the eighteenth one and should be the final.</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng set his foot on the threshold of the final adytum, a dragon's roar unexpectedly rang out.</p>

  <p>"Taming Dragon Arhats!"</p>

  <p>The light in Zheng's eyes flickered slightly.</p>

  <p>The presence of the four arhats in the four corners of the adytum was as expected. And each of them had a Genuine Dragon around their bodies.</p>

  <p>Zheng had heard that once upon a time, there was a master who succeeded in defeating the Genuine Dragon. And that certain master was an arhat named Mahakassapa. While, he had another well-known title, Taming Dragon Arhat.</p>

  <p>This time, Zheng rejected the notion of waiting!</p>

  <p>He had barged his way through the seventeen adytums in a row and had triumphantly annihilated many statues of the seventeen arhats. These encounters alone gave him useful insights as he positively figured out now the crux of these tests.</p>

  <p>In essence, these arhat statues were not that strong. These statues, to begin with, were not real arhats at all. They only had a trace of the arhats' energy and the power of incense.</p>

  <p>The power of incense was something like the so-called Faith Energy.</p>

  <p>In the Blessed Buddha Land, there were countless worshipers. What they consecrated formed the power of incense. Although the official way to call it was different, this incense was similar to the Faith Energy, which the three queens of the Demon Night had used.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, there was still a difference between them.</p>

  <p>The Demon Night was born in the universe, and only the three queens could exert or summon the Faith Energy and then passed it down to the next three queens.</p>

  <p>But the whole inheritance process of the power of incense in the Blessed Buddha Land, was far more complicated than it seemingly was.</p>

  <p>In this world, there were a lot of heavens and gods. And Buddha was one of these existences whose presence was similar to the True God, but Buddhas and gods were not living in the same heavens.</p>

  <p>It only meant that the legacy in the Blessed Buddha Land was an existence that surpassed the natural law of the heavens.</p>

  <p>If Zheng had to fight against the eighteen arhats, he would likely be killed by them so easily as blinking an eye right now.</p>

  <p>To display such strength with just a tiny sliver of the power of incense was already something Zheng was very wary of about these stone statues.</p>

  <p>But the most crucial thing was that these four arhat statues worked together. Without a doubt, their strength would increase by several times up to the extent that there would be no room for flaws.</p>

  <p>Zheng thought that the strength of the four statues in the last adytum was likely much stronger than the previous ones he conquered. So as a countermeasure to be safe after he crossed the threshold of the adytum, he immediately lunged towards one of the four statues.</p>

  <p>He strongly surmised that the succeeding difficulties would be much easier to deal with if he could only destroy a statue of the Taming Dragon Arhat.</p>

  <p>Zheng could hear an eerie constant cracking at the exterior of the Taming Dragon Arhat located at one corner. Its body was visibly trembling and seemed to be about to move in any minute.</p>

  <p>But Zheng had already gotten close to the Taming Dragon Arhat and in one fluid motion, pointed his finger towards its head. As long as he was successful in touching it with his fingertip, uncontrollable power would surge forth and naturally turn this stone statue to dust.</p>

  <p>Even a towering mountain couldn't withstand Zheng's overwhelming strength. He could shatter the eight feet high statue with a mere flicker of his finger.</p>

  <p>Although this arhat's body didn't move, the Genuine Dragon sculpture around the arhat lithely snaked over the right shoulder, stuck out its horn, and struck out towards Zheng's finger.</p>

  <p>The Genuine Dragon was nothing more than a stone sculpture.</p>

  <p>Zheng did not retreat at all. He was determined to win with this move. For him, he needed to break one statue. Then after that, it would be a whole lot easier for him to destroy the other three. The reward within the cave was something that he had to obtain.</p>

  <p>Never had Zheng thought or imagined that he would feel an immense force being transmitted over to him the second his fingertip slid in contact with the Genuine Dragon's horn.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>His fingertip collided with the horn.</p>

  <p>But still, Zheng took the attack by his finger without a slight hesitation, to which the horn gave off a shattering sound.</p>

  <p>At this instant, the Taming Dragon Arhat had 'awoken' completely. Both palms slammed down heavily on each other, and a dragon's roar rang out as if a Genuine Dragon had awoken within its body.</p>

  <p>And as if on cue, the Genuine Dragon statue on its shoulder began to glow with a jade-green light.</p>

  <p>This was the light of the dragon scales!</p>

  <p>"Aooo!"</p>

  <p>In the next instant, its two palms split apart swiftly as they struck out, aiming towards Zheng's chest.</p>

  <p>Zheng engaged a sneak attack but failed. And he hadn't been able to counterattack in defense when the arhat managed to assault him in a short space of time!</p>

  <p>"What a powerful strength!"</p>

  <p>Zheng quickly felt a sudden surge of overwhelming power gushing towards him.</p>

  <p>His entire body was sent flying backward with a loud thud as his two feet plowed a jagged groove into the ground. Then, he heavily smashed into a wall before landing at last on the other side of the adytum.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>When Zheng collided with such a powerful force, the shock was so nasty and violently forceful!</p>

  <p>In the Lower World, if he hit a mountain like this, not only it would collapse, but also the row of mountains behind it would crash down successively like a domino effect.</p>

  <p>The walls of the adytum quite looked old and dilapidated. It was as if a strong gale could destroy this ruined ancient temple in one blow. But with that kind of force, the walls of the temple sustained resistance and not even budged at all when Zheng's body slammed into it!</p>

  <p>But still and all, here was the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>The city walls here also looked ordinary, but even the most powerful warriors couldn't destroy them. There must be plausible explanations for this. But come to think of it, how could it be possible that the things constructed by the heavens would be so easy to destroy?</p>

  <p>Zheng wasn't in the mood to think about all this. His sole focus was on the Genuine Dragon on the arhat's shoulder!</p>

  <p>Though part of the immense strength possessed by Zheng was from Genuine Dragons as well, he had never thought that this arhat would be able to do the same.</p>

  <p>At the time the arhat had struck out with its palms, the dragon scales on the Genuine Dragon also began to light up one by one, flashing with a jade-green luster.</p>

  <p>This Genuine Dragon was only a stone sculpture, so Zheng could still take it down even though its power was seemingly terrifying after it illuminated all of the scales on its body.</p>

  <p>However, if it were a real dragon, then Zheng would have been long smashed to ashes right after all the scales in its body turned ablaze.</p>
