<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4211 The Third Stone </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>While they were on the altar, the Primeval Lord of Heaven and his companions were struggling to hold out against their enemies.</p>

  <p>Supposedly, eliminating the snake spirits should be a piece of cake, because they had the bird spirits, human spirits, and monkey spirits on their side.</p>

  <p>However, the Snake Spirit King was alive. This was a huge advantage to the snake spirits.</p>

  <p>Sewell's hissing could be heard all throughout the area.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Hagar and Nereus caught sight of Sewell. They rushed towards him at the same time. The former charged from his left side while the latter charged from his right.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the Monkey Spirit King, Manuel, and Tearrag had been cursed. Thus, they were unable to join the battle. Nevertheless, the Monkey Masters didn't feel dejected at all. On the contrary, this made them angrier and more anxious to fight their enemies.</p>

  <p>Hagar and Nereus, the two Monkey Masters, moved extremely fast that Sewell didn't immediately realize what was going on.</p>

  <p>"If anything happens to our king, we will annihilate all of you!" Hagar roared as he was charging at Sewell.</p>

  <p>He stretched out his hands, and a black stick instantly shot out of his right hand.</p>

  <p>Under his careful control, he aimed the black stick at Sewell.</p>

  <p>As Hagar got closer to Sewell, he directed his stick towards his opponent's shoulder.</p>

  <p>The once solid stick suddenly transformed into liquid.</p>

  <p>The black ink splashed all over Sewell's body.</p>

  <p>Hagar was one of the weakest among the Monkey Masters in terms of brute strength. Nonetheless, he was pretty good with sealing things.</p>

  <p>What he unleashed was the Ink Sealing Technique. It was a token devised by the people in the Bold Conjecture House. It was regarded as one of their top theurgies.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, the black ink had covered Sewell. Nereus muttered under his breath, "Perfect! I'm going to cut him into pieces!"</p>

  <p>After Hagar performed the Ink Sealing Technique, Nereus appeared on Sewell's side.</p>

  <p>Colorful fingernails grew on top of Nereus' original ones. These colorful fingernails were actually made from energy. Each one was as sharp as a dagger.</p>

  <p>In an instant, Sewell sustained deep scratches from Nereus' sharp fingernails. When Hagar's ink landed on him, his movements slowed down. He felt like his body suddenly became vulnerable. Hence, Nereus was able to rip his body inch by inch.</p>

  <p>At first, Sewell didn't take the Monkey Masters seriously. He thought that they would surely win this war. However, Hagar and Nereus' combined attacks completely caught him off guard. The worse part of it was he could not even defend himself.</p>

  <p>They already destroyed one-third of Sewell's body. But suddenly, Hagar and Nereus felt a heavy pressure coming from above them. As they were about to get pounded into the ground by the extreme pressure, they attempted to move aside. However, the force converged at them from every direction.</p>

  <p>In just a blink of an eye, the two of them turned into cube-shaped bricks.</p>

  <p>Sewell gathered all his strength and broke the Ink Sealing Technique.</p>

  <p>With a trace of shame all over his face, he said, "Thank you, my king..."</p>

  <p>"These Monkey Masters are very powerful, especially now that they want to avenge their king. They are going all out. You should be more careful," the Snake Spirit King said to him.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir!" Sewell responded with an energetic nod.</p>

  <p>All at once, several bone spikes extruded from Sewell's body. They began to move towards the altar at an even greater speed.</p>

  <p>One by one, the Bird Masters, Monkey Masters, and human spirits left the altar and attacked the snake spirits.</p>

  <p>Every time they did so, the Snake Spirit King would turn them into bricks.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King didn't really kill them. He merely trapped them in a very tight space. This way, they would be unable to move an inch.</p>

  <p>After a while, more human spirits, Bird Masters, and Monkey Masters were turned into bricks.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven, the Snake Goddess, and the others furrowed their brows. There was no way they could win now that the Snake Spirit King kept turning their allies into bricks.</p>

  <p>Even though they once confronted lots of formidable opponents, they were able to hold out against them.</p>

  <p>But as they looked at the gigantic Snake Spirit King, they felt powerless.</p>

  <p>What else could they do now?</p>

  <p>They had never been so frustrated. At this point, they were stumped and had no idea how to defeat such an invincible being.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Masters were trapped in the space blocks one after another.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, they were scattered all around the altar.</p>

  <p>The Bird Masters suffered the same fate.</p>

  <p>Afterward, the human spirits also ended up inside the space blocks.</p>

  <p>In the end, the Primeval Lord of Heaven and his companions were the only ones standing on the altar. They were now backed into a corner.</p>

  <p>Moreover, they had no trump card up their sleeves. This was such a humiliating situation.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King looked down at them. His face revealed a playful smile.</p>

  <p>Zhurong narrowed his eyes and said, "I will fight him to the death." Even at this point, he still had a burning determination to defeat the Snake Spirit King.</p>

  <p>The heat emanated from his body and began to spread.</p>

  <p>In a flash, he burst into flames. Tongues of fire radiated from his body.</p>

  <p>He jumped up and attempted to attack the Snake Spirit King.</p>

  <p>However, he immediately felt a tremendous force coming at him.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, he was condensed into a cube and dropped on the ground. As a result, he couldn't move an inch.</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact, I should thank you," said the Snake Spirit King calmly.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean "thank us? What are you getting at?" The Primeval Lord of Heaven looked at the Snake Spirit King with a somber expression on his face.</p>

  <p>"That human named Luo Zheng got his hands on something that I wasn't able to get," the Snake Spirit King answered.</p>

  <p>He could see what was happening in the altar using the Limited Omnipotent Stone.</p>

  <p>"Did Luo Zheng manage to free the Human Spirit King?" The Primeval Lord of Heaven turned around to look down at the gate.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he did," the Snake Spirit King replied. His eyes lit up in excitement.</p>

  <p>"I know he's your only hope. He's mine as well."</p>

  <p>When they heard this, the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and the Primeval Lord of Heaven were completely bewildered.</p>

  <p>'Did he just say Luo Zheng was his hope?</p>

  <p>What is he talking about?' They all wondered about the same thing.</p>

  <p>At that moment, a buzzing sound came from the inside of alter. It was immediately followed by a burst of cold air.</p>

  <p>They heard a crisp sound of footsteps coming from it.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng emerged from the gate clad in black armor. He walked up the stairs with a heavy sword in his hand.</p>

  <p>As he stood on the top step, he glanced around. When he caught sight of numerous cubes scattered on the ground, he narrowed his eyes. "You were waiting for me," he said as he raised his head and stared at the Snake Spirit King in the sky.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I was," the Snake Spirit King answered.</p>

  <p>"I have been waiting for this moment for far too long. You didn't let me down. Good. Very good," the Snake Spirit King continued. There was a trace of suppressed excitement in his voice.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng remained standing there and kept looking at the Snake Spirit King calmly.</p>

  <p>Without saying anything, Luo Zheng raised his sword.</p>

  <p>Even though it was a heavy sword, he was wielding as though it was as light as a feather.</p>

  <p>As the irregular sword slashed through the air, it made harsh cutting sounds.</p>

  <p>"You went into the altar yourself and failed to beat Master Kincaid. Do you really think you can defeat me now?" Luo Zheng finally spoke.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King flashed him a confident smile. "Of course, I can," the Snake Spirit King responded.</p>

  <p>"What makes you think I am going to lose against you?" Luo Zheng asked once more.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry. You'll see soon enough..."</p>

  <p>Half of the Snake Spirit King's body was inside the coordinates, which were inside the ball.</p>

  <p>Gradually, he went out of the coordinates and returned to his normal figure. There were two stones floating in front of his forehead. One was the diamond-shaped Limited Omnipotent Stone, and the other was the triangular Space Guiding Stone.</p>

  <p>A black round gem began to appear in front of his forehead just as a black light flickered slightly around it. The gem exuded a faint black smoke that seeped into his scales.</p>

  <p>Shortly after, a layer of black scales appeared on the surface of the Snake Spirit King's body.</p>

  <p>"Come up here!" the Snake Spirit King said.</p>

  <p>Just then, a space wall appeared under Luo Zheng's feet and sent him up in the air.</p>

  <p>But suddenly, they heard a light cracking sound.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stepped lightly on the space wall and broke it into pieces. "I can do it myself," he said.</p>
