<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1219 Return To Their Own Bodies </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Although the blue arrows were supposed to be extremely strong, they could not pierce through Delroy's enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>Under its protection, everyone easily passed through the Road of Saints even under the constant barrage of arrows and entered the Divine Emperor Secret Land.</p>

  <p>"So that's it! The Heavenly Stellar Secret Land is connected to a huge cemetery. No wonder you all took over corpses to pass through. These corpses must have come from the cemetery, if I am not mistaken?" Max asked.</p>

  <p>Although as members of the Celestial Position race, they all looked down on the strength of the warriors from the Lower World, the seven people of the company simply had to admire the way they had figured out to avoid being affected by the blood sacrifice.</p>

  <p>"That's correct." Luo Zheng nodded slightly.</p>

  <p>"Then where are your actual bodies?" Max's curiosity was aroused.</p>

  <p>"They are on the other side of the Divine Emperor Island," Luo Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>Normally, when they were returning, the warriors of the four divine kingdoms would place the corpses back in their coffins as they passed through the cemetery. That was what they had been doing every time they had come here.</p>

  <p>After all, there were very few corpses in the cemetery which had been preserved properly. In fact, the corpses of Soul Sea Realm warriors in prime condition were extremely difficult to get, and every time they used corpses, some wear and tear showed up.</p>

  <p>If these corpses were casually thrown away every time they used them, it was likely that there would not be enough corpses for them to use next time.</p>

  <p>This time, however, these Soul Sea Realm masters didn't place the corpses back in their coffins. They controlled the corpses and passed through the cemetery, heading towards the coast of the Divine Emperor Island.</p>

  <p>Several Soul Sea Realm masters were guarding the coast of the Divine Emperor Island. After all, so many people had gone inside, and if their bodies were destroyed while they were in soul forms, things were going to be extremely troublesome. They would be left with no physical existence at all.</p>

  <p>Derek, Marine, and the others had not entered the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land and were also present there.</p>

  <p>Numerous spirit shrines were lined up on the shore, one after the other, and the bodies of the Soul Sea Realm masters who had entered the secret land were sitting on the ground in a meditative posture.</p>

  <p>"They're back! They're back!" shouted a mighty warrior at the Soul Sea Realm who was keeping an eye out while the others guarded the place.</p>

  <p id="top_9">Marine's and Derek's eyes lit up. But then they noticed the corpses and their eyes revealed a strange expression. "What's going on? Why didn't they drop the corpses in the cemetery?" Marine asked in astonishment.</p>

  <p>Derek's gaze was fixed upon a young lady in the front of the group. She seemed to be carrying something. In her arms was a furry little thing.</p>

  <p>Although it looked very strange and didn't look like any animal, the Mu Ning that leaked out from it was very specific. Derek was completely certain that it was a dragon.</p>

  <p>"The Ancestral Dragon! They got it! They've got the Ancestral Dragon!"</p>

  <p>Derek's face lit up with joy. He was about to fly towards the arriving company, but at this moment, he suddenly felt several powerful pressuring auras stopping him in his path.</p>

  <p>A warrior mighty enough to make Derek feel such kind of pressure did not exist in this world.</p>

  <p>Even Luo Zheng himself wasn't able to put so much pressure on him. After all, even though the former had shown great abilities, his cultivation was still only at the Life and Death Realm. As for his strength, aside from the fact that he had fused with the world's will, he was probably no different from an ordinary Soul Sea Realm master.</p>

  <p>"Seven people! All of them are at the Spirit Supreme Realm!" Derek announced with a serious expression as he coldly stared at the seven Celestial Position warriors who accompanied the company.</p>

  <p>After the long trek they had just endured, War King Wind and the others finally returned to the Divine Emperor Island, and their expressions showed relaxation. None of them was too willing to let their souls stay in other people's corpses. That was not a good feeling. However, this clumsy method was the only way for them to avoid the power of the blood sacrifice.</p>

  <p>"Everyone, let's go back to our bodies!" War King Wind and the others had just escaped their deaths. They were tired and could not be the least bit bothered about explaining anything to anyone for the moment. One by one, they withdrew their souls from the corpses and flew into their own bodies.</p>

  <p>After their souls left those corpses, the corpses all fell down to the ground one by one with a thump. The warriors rushed towards their own bodies, unconcerned about the corpses that were falling down with thumps.</p>

  <p>As for Luo Zheng, he wouldn't and couldn't treat Brianna's body in such a manner. She was not dead. If he treated her like that, she would probably go berserk in rage.</p>

  <p>Thus, he found an open space to sit down in before leaving her body and flying back to his own.</p>

  <p>After coming into his own, he slowly opened his eyes. At that moment, he saw the newly born Ancestral Dragon running towards him.</p>

  <p>"Huh?"</p>

  <p>Zheng's face revealed a puzzled expression. The first person the Ancestral Dragon had seen when it had hatched was Brianna. Logically speaking, it should have considered Brianna as its mother. Why was it pouncing towards him?</p>

  <p>The moment his question appeared, the cyan dragon told him in his mind, "The Ancestral Dragons does treat the first person it sees as its mother, but this is not done depending on one's looks. It detects souls.</p>

  <p>The Ancestral Dragon recognizes your soul as its mother. Thank you, Luo Zheng. You've managed to do it!"</p>

  <p>Previously, when Zheng's soul had left his body, it had distanced itself from the cyan dragon. Although there was still a thread of connection between the two, the cyan dragon was unable to observe Zheng's surroundings. This meant that communication was impossible and fruitless. Now that Luo Zheng had returned to his body, the cyan dragon had also appeared.</p>

  <p>He was naturally happy to see Luo Zheng bring the Ancestral Dragon back with him.</p>

  <p>"What? No! This one is a man!"</p>

  <p>Dorothea couldn't help but exclaim in disappointment when she saw that the soul which emerged from Brianna's body flew straight into the body of a handsome man.</p>

  <p>Max, who was standing at her side, stared at Luo Zheng and nodded slightly.</p>

  <p>"He does have the mark of the Celestial Position on him. This guy really has been to the Tower of Crystal."</p>

  <p>"Hang on, now! Even if he has a mark, it doesn't mean that he has obtained a title. Once his talent reached the second row of the Talent Tablet, there would be a mark on his body, regardless of whether or not he won a title." Delroy stated, unconvinced.</p>

  <p>Max nodded and replied, "It doesn't matter anyway. We can continue to verify his words. In any case, he's been to the tower and we need to find it."</p>

  <p>"Man! That is a man..." Dorothea murmured, still very conflicted. As for whether or not Luo Zheng was recognized as a member of their own by the Celestial Position race, she did not care. It was a man!</p>

  <p>The newly born Ancestral Dragon had no sense of estrangement from Luo Zheng as it threw itself into his embrace, constantly licking him with affection. At that moment, Derek walked towards Luo Zheng with a smile on his face and said, "Tianxing, thank you for bringing the Ancestral Dragon out of the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land."</p>

  <p>As he held the Ancestral Dragon in his arms, Luo Zheng looked at Derek coldly.</p>

  <p>He then asked in an icy tone, "Why are you thanking me?"</p>

  <p>Hearing Zheng's words, Derek frowned and replied, "We've been trying to get the Ancestral Dragon's egg for so many years, yet we failed to do so.</p>

  <p>Now that you've helped us obtain the dragon itself, I naturally have to thank you."</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! You don't need to thank him, because the Ancestral Dragon doesn't belong to you." Woody stepped forward with a sarcastic laugh and raised the black saber in his hand, slowly walking over towards Derek.</p>

  <p>Both of them were at the Spirit Supreme Realm, and they had discovered that fact instantly. However, the seven Celestial Position warriors did not take Derek seriously as he was alone. Derek knew that he was too weak against seven people. Furthermore, the Ancestral Dragon was in Zheng's hands, so he did not care about the seven warriors. He tried to flatter Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Derek's face immediately darkened at Woody's words. "Who do you think you are? I work for the Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment..."</p>

  <p>Derek knew that he probably wasn't a match for these seven people.</p>

  <p>Their Mu Ning was astonishing. Fortunately, his backing was well-known throughout the whole universe. Facing these experts of the same cultivation level as him, Derek could only bring out his backing.</p>

  <p>However, just as he was proudly announcing it, the burly man in front of him laughed and said, "Ha-ha! How funny! Are you trying to scare us by mentioning a Supreme Lord? You can use that move to deceive the warriors of the Lower World. But we are from the Upper World. Your trick doesn't work on us."</p>

  <p>"Deceive them?" Derek's eyes narrowed.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Max cut in, "The Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment is the weakest of the three Supreme Lords. But I have to admit that a Supreme Lord is not something we can comment about or take lightly!"</p>

  <p>"It's good that you know that!" Derek replied proudly. It was obvious that the man standing in front of him and wearing a silver mask was the most powerful among them all. He might be able to fight the other six one-on-one, but he had no confidence in facing this foe. Therefore, Derek restrained himself when talking to him.</p>

  <p>"But even though you work for the Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment, the Ancestral Dragon belongs to our Celestial Position race.</p>

  <p>Other races have no possibility of getting their hands on it," Max continued in a cold tone.</p>

  <p>"Celestial Position race?" Derek's face twitched when he heard Max's words.</p>
