<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"What happened?"</p>

  <p>"Did the city wall collapse?"</p>

  <p>"Who was strong enough to destroy the wall?" "Was it the Ghost Sneaking Beast?"</p>

  <p>Creatures in Stage Twelve of the Other Shore were not limited to those from the Abyss Spirit race and the Separate Abyss race.</p>

  <p>It was also home to unique and powerful beasts, one of which was the Ghost Sneaking Beast.</p>

  <p>The Souls of Light in the eleventh stage of the Other Shore Realm were not strong enough to destroy the city wall, but the Ghost Sneaking Beast could.</p>

  <p>As usual, Luo Zheng, too, was an exception. He could easily destroy the city wall, which was why the Separate Abyss race was astounded by his power.</p>

  <p>"What's that?"</p>

  <p>"He seems to be a simple human."</p>

  <p>"He's not in soul form. Unbelievable!"</p>

  <p>Upon seeing Luo Zheng, members of the Separate Abyss race gasped.</p>

  <p>They could not believe what they were seeing.</p>

  <p id="top_26">Luo Zheng squinted as he walked. He remained completely unbothered by their reactions.</p>

  <p>He walked calmly and on his toes towards a huge building. Then he crashed into the pillars of the building.</p>

  <p>As he moved forward, the pillars broke into pieces.</p>

  <p>Members of the Separate Abyss race hastily tried to approach Luo Zheng without considering the risks.</p>

  <p>"No matter which race you come from! You are courting death!"</p>

  <p>"No one has ever dared to go against us, especially not a mere human like you!"</p>

  <p>"Are you from the Bearing race?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't want to waste any more time on them.</p>

  <p>For those who approached him boldly, Luo Zheng simply flicked his arm to smash their Souls of Light.</p>

  <p>He had killed several of their members and the Separate Abyss race was quickly realizing how much of a threat he really was.</p>

  <p>But they did not give up. They did not leave the Other Shore. Despite Luo Zheng's display of strength, they gathered behind him and cursed him. They wanted to stop him but did not dare approach him.</p>

  <p>Then, they heard the sound of a rumble.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had passed through another huge building a moment before its collapse.</p>

  <p>He walked towards the center of the city, triggering the collapse of every building he passed by.</p>

  <p>Nothing could stop him.</p>

  <p>More and more members of the Separate Abyss race followed behind Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Each time a building collapsed, their hearts sank deeper.</p>

  <p>"Hey, human! Stop!"</p>

  <p>"Take what you want!"</p>

  <p>The place grew tense.</p>

  <p>These people were not figures of authority in the city. Luo Zheng had previously asked for a hundred million soul pills, but they refused.</p>

  <p>They had to really see Luo Zheng's power before they bowed to his wishes.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng ignored them profusely.</p>

  <p>He passed a wide road where a magnificent building stood.</p>

  <p>He remembered his reactions to those temples when he newly entered Stage Four. He could not comprehend then how the human race was capable of such wonder.</p>

  <p>The building in front of him put him in even more awe. It was bigger than what he had seen before.</p>

  <p>"What a beautiful building!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng remarked.</p>

  <p>Members of the Separate Abyss race who trailed behind him trembled at his words. They did not want to lose anything to him anymore.</p>

  <p>"What, what do you want to do?" someone of the Separate Abyss race asked.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had already destroyed the buildings in the outer part of the area, but they could not take it if he destroyed the building ahead of them. It was the real temple of the Separate Abyss race.</p>

  <p>"I want to tear it down," Luo Zheng said nonchalantly.</p>

  <p>Then he casually walked towards the building.</p>

  <p>"Stop him!"</p>

  <p>"Don't let him enter the temple!"</p>

  <p>"Nobody can desecrate our temple!"</p>

  <p>Members of the Separate Abyss race furiously rushed towards Luo Zheng in an attempt to stop him.</p>

  <p>However, before they even got close, Luo Zheng shattered them instantly.</p>

  <p>The Separate Abyss race fell into despair. Would the temple really be destroyed by a young man?</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the sound of horns played in the distance.</p>

  <p>"Woo-oo-oo!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly, huge eagles filled the sky. They flew from outside of the city walls carrying giants on their backs.</p>

  <p>The giants bore a close resemblance to those from the Separate Abyss race, but the latter had blurred outlines because they were only Souls of Light.</p>

  <p>However, the giants' appearances were clearly visible.</p>

  <p>They were from the Abyss Spirit race that lived on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>"Great! The knights of the Abyss Spirit race are here!"</p>

  <p>"They're here to save us!"</p>

  <p>"Kill this damn human brat!"</p>

  <p>Excitement stirred the place. The Separate Abyss race grew confident.</p>

  <p>Their backup finally arrived and they could smell victory coming their way.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>The eagles lined up and swooped towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The destruction of buildings was a capital offense both for the Separate Abyss race and the Abyss Spirit race. The Abyss Spirit race were definitely angered by Luo Zheng's disrespect. They were determined to kill him.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>As the Abyss Spirit knights neared Luo Zheng, they revealed white bone spears in their hands.</p>

  <p>Bone spears were known to be even more powerful than soul spears.</p>

  <p>"Kill him!"</p>

  <p>The Abyss Spirit knights shouted with conviction.</p>

  <p>'How strong could these creatures from the Other Shore be?' Luo Zheng squinted his eyes as if inspecting their features.</p>

  <p>He did not know much about the Other Shore even though he was a competent Indigo Soul now.</p>

  <p>In his long stay on the Other Shore, he had only encountered two types of aboriginal creatures. One was the Heavenly Spider's body in the Sacred Mallow Temple, and the other was the Thunder Beast in the temple of Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>For the first time, he encountered two creatures at the same time in the same place. One was the Abyss Spirit race, and the other was the flying eagles that they rode.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>A bone spear flew towards him but Luo Zheng was able to avoid it. He stretched out his hand and easily grabbed the spear.</p>

  <p>"They seem strong.</p>

  <p>Much powerful than Souls of Light.</p>

  <p>But they can't be strong enough to defeat me!" Luo Zheng said scornfully.</p>

  <p>As soon as he grasped the bone spear, Luo Zheng pushed it out with his hand.</p>

  <p>The bone spear lashed in the air. It emitted a whistling sound as it landed directly on the chest of an Abyss Spirit knight.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>Blood spewed out of the body of the Abyss Spirit knight. He lost his balance and fell from the back of the eagle. His bleeding body lay crumpled on the ground. The eagle, disoriented from what happened, followed suit. It flapped its wings to carry itself up but failed.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng grabbed another spear and threw it towards another Abyss Spirit knight rushing towards him.</p>

  <p>"Bang! Bang! Bang!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng kept on throwing spears, each time hitting an Abyss Spirit knight right on the chest. Bodies fell from the sky and crushed on the ground.</p>

  <p>The Abyss Spirit race was indeed stronger than the Souls of Light, but they were only creatures of Stage Eleven. This meant that Luo Zheng was still miles stronger in terms of pure physical strength.</p>

  <p>A total of eight Abyss Spirit knights lay on the ground. The others panicked behind Luo Zheng, trying to force the eagles into flight.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a look of terror dawned on the faces of the Abyss Spirit knights.</p>

  <p>"Does he cultivate Wild God Power?"</p>

  <p>"Are we dealing with a Wild God once more?"</p>

  <p>"No way! Rules have been changed. No Wild God could enter the Other Shore. It has been like that for the past tens of millions of years!"</p>

  <p>The Abyss Spirit knights exchanged frightened murmurs as they shared the memories of the time when they were dominated by Wild Gods.</p>
