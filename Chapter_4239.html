  <p>
</p>

  <p>The little monster acted swiftly and smoothly. He seemed very capable of unlocking the Eight Diagrams Locks.</p>

  <p>Sure enough, he quickly found a knack to do that. After a few minutes, he successfully unlocked the Eight Diagrams Locks. Then, he eyed Luo Nian curiously, as though he wanted to size up his capabilities.</p>

  <p>Because of two prior experiences, Luo Nian was now able to maintain his composure. In fact, he acted as though he was in no rush.</p>

  <p>He even observed the other monsters for a while before reaching out his hands to the Eight Diagrams Lock. He grabbed each side of the Eight Diagrams Lock with both hands and gently twisted it, unlocking it with ease.</p>

  <p>Then he unlocked the second lock, the third, the fourth...</p>

  <p>Once he'd successfully unlocked all six Eight Diagrams Locks, Luo Nian smiled at the little monster in front of him. Then, he began to reconfigure the pieces of the locks.</p>

  <p>He paired the biggest two pieces of Eight Diagrams Locks with the smallest two pieces. Then the middle-sized ones were pieced and paired with them. All in all, a strange shape was formed.</p>

  <p>There were endless permutations to the combinations of the pieces of the Eight Diagrams Locks. As Luo Nian's flexible hands continued to move nimbly, these Eight Diagrams Locks seemed to come to life, changing shape constantly.</p>

  <p>After Luo Nian formed a large structure with all the Eight Diagrams Locks, he put it to the side and gently flicked at it with his finger.</p>

  <p>Immediately, the structure collapsed into small pieces again.</p>

  <p>The little monster looked at Luo Nian's series of movements, his eyes revealing a look of surprise. It never occurred to him that this thing could be toyed with like this.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian gestured towards the little monster and leaned against the side of the cage.</p>

  <p>After their time was up, the other losers in the underground space began to be wiped out again.</p>

  <p>Plop! Plop! Plop...</p>

  <p>A series of sounds rang out, indicating that another batch of monsters had been eliminated. Luo Nian's eyes swept throughout the cages as he did a rough headcount. It seemed only a small number of monsters were left.</p>

  <p>On the third day, a new round of test began. This time, they were asked to unlock an exquisite chain made of one hundred rings.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian had never seen a chain of one hundred rings before.</p>

  <p>Fortunately for him, he was very smart. After studying it for a while, he figured it out. In no time, he had unraveled it easily.</p>

  <p>In comparison, the little monster on the other side scratched his head and ears, as if it was very difficult for him to unfasten this strange chain.</p>

  <p>"You find it difficult, right?" Luo Nian called out to him with a shrug.</p>

  <p>However, while the little monster was not stupid, he was also determined.</p>

  <p>Although the chain of one hundred rings was complicated, he tried again and again. It took him more than an hour to find out the technique of untying the chain, but eventually he separated the rings, one by one.</p>

  <p>When the little monster unfastened the last ring, he let out a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>Then, he turned to eye Luo Nian, intrigued. It seemed that now, he viewed Luo Nian as a worthy opponent.</p>

  <p>Plop! Plop! Plop! Plop...</p>

  <p>Time was over.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian could hear the sound of more and more monsters being eliminated.</p>

  <p>There weren't many monsters that had survived before, and now the sounds were sparser.</p>

  <p>Then, three spiders emerged from the entrance to the underground space.</p>

  <p>One of them opened the cage and plucked Luo Nian out, locking him to its back.</p>

  <p>The little monster was also treated the same way.</p>

  <p>In addition to the two of them left in the underground space, there was a ten-foot-tall black ape, which was also locked on the back of a spider.</p>

  <p>"Are there only three of us left?"</p>

  <p>Sitting on the back of the spider, Luo Nian realized only now that the underground space was very empty. Were all the other creatures eliminated?</p>

  <p>How terrifying!</p>

  <p>Rustle, rustle...</p>

  <p>The three spiders carried them, continuing deeper into the space.</p>

  <p>At the very end of the underground space, there were layers of stairs, on which three spiders were slowly climbing.</p>

  <p>The black ape curled up on the spider's back in silence. The little monster looked around briefly before eventually locking his eyes on Luo Nian. He was very interested in him.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian was also used to the little monster's strange behavior. He just pretended not to notice it and decidedly closed his eyes, deep in thought.</p>

  <p>However, at this moment, he heard a raspy voice. "What's... your name?"</p>

  <p>When Luo Nian heard the little monster's words, his eyes popped open in surprise.</p>

  <p>The little monster was speaking Sanskrit!</p>

  <p>The Sanskrit words of the Four Spirits Sect, nonetheless.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, Ziya, and the others naturally wouldn't have understood if they had heard that. Then again, Luo Zheng could decipher the words with the help of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization.</p>

  <p>But for Luo Nian, he didn't need to decipher the words. He could understand the Sanskrit words the instant he heard or read them.</p>

  <p>However, the Sanskrit words belonged to the Four Spirits Sect. How did the little monster in the Deep Space know it? Could it be that the creatures in the Deep Space also communicated with each other by using the Sanskrit words?</p>

  <p>Impossible!</p>

  <p>Luo Nian had a full understanding of the Sanskrit words already.</p>

  <p>The Sanskrit words were the culture created by the Four Spirits Sect; it was not passed down from the Deep Space.</p>

  <p>"I..."</p>

  <p>Luo Nian squeezed his throat and made a series of guttural sounds.</p>

  <p>The pronunciation of Sanskrit was very complicated. Luo Zheng had even invited a group of people to 'sing' in order to speak in Sanskrit.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Nian knew how to read Sanskrit words, it was too difficult for him to pronounce them all by himself. Thus it took him a while before he was able to utter what he wanted to say. "Can you speak Sanskrit?"</p>

  <p>The little monster nodded and replied in Sanskrit. "And you also can..."</p>

  <p>'This is nonsense!' Luo Nian thought to himself. Aloud, he asked, "Who taught you?"</p>

  <p>The little monster pointed at Luo Nian and gestured with his hands. "A human spirit."</p>

  <p>"A human spirit? Is his surname Xue?" Luo Nian's eyes widened with surprise.</p>

  <p>During those four hours of exchange between Luo Nian and Kincaid, the latter only worried about two things. First, he had no idea whether Elder Xue was really alive or not. Second, he wondered whether Luo Nian would find him.</p>

  <p>Despite the little monster not seeming too fluent in Sanskrit, Luo Nian's heart sparked with hope. It was very likely that Elder Xue taught the little monster how to speak Sanskrit. If that was the case, then his luck had taken a turn for the better!</p>

  <p>The little monster tried his best to understand Luo Nian's words. After a long while, he finally nodded and said, "Yes..."</p>

  <p>Elder Xue was still alive!</p>

  <p>Luo Nian was so excited that he couldn't help but ask urgently, "Where is he? Can you... take me to him?"</p>

  <p>"He's outside." The little monster pointed in a direction. "We can't go out yet."</p>

  <p>"We can't go out?" Luo Nian echoed in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Well, we won't be able to get out...forever," the little monster said with a nod.</p>

  <p>This news disappointed Luo Nian greatly.</p>

  <p>All this time, he had been under the impression that if he'd passed a few more rounds of tests, he could finally obtain his freedom.</p>

  <p>After he heard the little monster's words, his hopes were dashed.</p>

  <p>"Why?" Luo Nian frowned deeply, his expression darkening.</p>

  <p>"Only the most intelligent one here can... turn the situation around. Are you that smart?" the little monster chanted almost playfully.</p>

  <p>'Only the smartest one can reverse the situation?'</p>

  <p>Luo Nian turned these words over in his head.</p>

  <p>Along the way, there were intelligence tests, and it was indeed like they were trying to select the most intelligent being.</p>

  <p>However, this so-called "intelligence" actually had a limit. No matter how smart one was, they wouldn't be able to resist against the one with the strongest power.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian felt that he was smarter than the little monster and the black ape, but in terms of strength, he definitely paled in comparison.</p>

  <p>What on earth had happened in the Sky Wheel City? Why were there tests to select the most intelligent creature?</p>
