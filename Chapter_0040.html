<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Master Su had displeased the masters of the other peaks by disobeying the rules for the benefit of Drizzle Peak.</p>

  <p>However, considering Master Su's background, no one really dared to confront her. The chief examiner was only in charge of the initial exam. He would never have the courage to offend Master Su. What he could do was preach to her, given his seniority. If Master Su did not listen to him, he would not say anything else.</p>

  <p>As for the boy who was being beaten, the chief examiner thought that it was likely that he had practiced some unique refining skills or had some peculiar physique. These were the only explanations to justify how he could be beaten to this extent and not be injured.</p>

  <p>While the chief examiner was surprised to see such a talent, he wasn't entirely shocked. Cloud Sect recruited many gifted people from among the imperial geniuses. This boy was nothing in comparison to the evil geniuses of the empire. Yes, he had passed the initial exam. But the next test was not as simple. Who knew whether or not he would pass the next test.</p>

  <p>Thirty miles away, the four men surrendered to exhaustion. They fell to the ground, gasping for breath. They were so tired that they were no longer able to continue.</p>

  <p>They had also registered for the initial exam. Killing that boy was only an incidental task. But now they were too tired to pass the initial exam, much less kill the boy. There were still about five or six miles away from the stone tablet that denoted their goal. But in their current state, the thought of standing and trying to run the last few miles was too much to bear.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng swung his arms. He felt refreshed and energetic. The beating had refined his body. He could tell how far he had advanced from the impurities that had been washed away from his organs. He wondered if he could reach the peak of the organ refining level if he were punched a few more times by cultivators at the marrow refining level.</p>

  <p>It was a pity that this kind of opportunity didn't come more frequently. Luo Zheng was apparently thrilled with how much his body had been refined.</p>

  <p>Still looking for a fight, Luo Zheng walked up to and squatted next to the scholar-like man who had been glaring at him maliciously. Then Luo Zheng asked, "I just heard you talk about Billy. Were you referring to Billy Wang?"</p>

  <p>The scholar-like man sneered and said coldly, "Since you know that, why don't you just kneel and wait for death? Billy is from a noble family, and you have provoked him. Do you think he will let you live? Even if you enter Cloud Sect and become a disciple, you can't escape death."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded, smiled, and said, "Help me pass a message to Mr. Wang. I have no grievance with him, so he should not get involved in the business between Perrin Luo and me."</p>

  <p>"Haha, are you kidding? Who do you think you are? Why should Mr. Wang listen to you? And what makes you think you are in a position to negotiate with him? Killing you will be a piece of cake for him..." continued the scholar-like man with a sneer.</p>

  <p>"Peng!"</p>

  <p>Halfway through his speech, the scholar-like man felt a sharp pain. Luo Zheng had struck him on the jaw! The force of the attack sent the man flying backward. Then he flipped around and fell to the ground. The impact broke the scholar-like man's teeth and his mouth filled with blood. The man, now unable to make a sound, nursed his injured jaw.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng rubbed his fists and said coldly, "Asking you to pass Mr. Wang a message might not be such a good idea. You keep talking and complaining.</p>

  <p>Do you really think that I don't have a temper? You hit me for so long and didn't manage to injure me. I gave you one punch. Now, look at you. Did you think I was too weak or afraid to fight back?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was telling the truth. The four men had chased Luo Zheng for a long time, and they had been encouraged to run after him by his lack of attack back. Luo Zheng had fled all this way without a single counterattack. So they naively believed that Luo Zheng would not pose a threat to them.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng flattened the scholar-like man with one brutal wallop. His attack had been swift and merciless!</p>

  <p>The other three men instantly realized that this guy was as fierce as a lion!</p>

  <p>Fear enveloped the other three men. They despaired at their situation as they watched  Luo Zheng Luo. The pressure on the path, the long run, and the beating they meted out to Luo Zheng had exhausted them so much that they could barely stand. Even if they wanted to run away, they couldn't. What terrified them more was that they didn't have the power to fight back.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked at the strong man and asked, "Did you hear what I just said? Or would you like me to repeat the message?"</p>

  <p>"No, no," said the strong man. A weak smile grew on his face as he attempted to disguise his trepidation. "I heard you clearly. I will convey your message to Mr. Wang." The strong man was smarter than the scholar-like man. He knew that if he didn't obey Luo Zheng, he would end up as hurt as his companion. He would not ask for trouble.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded contentedly. He stood and continued his journey without another look at the four men.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was the only person on the road now. Although he had succeeded in passing the initial exam, he wanted to see if he could move on.</p>

  <p>When he tried to run for a while, Luo Zheng found that he could advance more miles. He knew that if he continued, he would reach the end of the test for participants at the marrow refining level. He wanted to push his limits.</p>
