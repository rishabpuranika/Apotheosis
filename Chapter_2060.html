<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2060 Broken Arm </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng went all out, vehemently venting his boiling hatred by launching a deadly strike.</p>

  <p>Nearly a third of Luo Zheng's strength source within his inner world had now flowed into his arm.</p>

  <p>His current physical body was extremely tough, nearly unbreakable, but despite that, he was still incapable of carrying such hefty power. Both his veins and bones felt like they were on the verge of collapsing. It was safe to say that the rage had got the best of him; he couldn't think of anything else.</p>

  <p>And in terms of the other seventy percent of his strength source, Luo Luo Zheng had gathered it tightly around his sword by using the Cross-world token.</p>

  <p>As he displayed his strength in this way though, he'd lose a certain amount of power which could easily be interpreted as a weakness of the Cross-world token. Hence, it was clear to Luo Luo Zheng that if he wanted to bring the strength source within his inner world into full play, his only option was to make his physical body much, much stronger.</p>

  <p>As a secondary creature, Luo Luo Zheng had already reached a certain limit in all aspects of his development as a warrior. In many, if not most ways, he had already hit the ceiling and could no longer improve any further. That was, unless he could condense a Godly Tile and control his inner world's momentum. If he could manage that, then he could make a hell of a leap in his development.</p>

  <p>"Gods-intimidating Strike!"</p>

  <p>The Great Weighty Sword began rumbling loudly. The Star Essence Iron was extraordinarily robust, even more so because Luo Luo Zheng had fused one-third of the nine stars' power into it. Despite having done so, there was still too much power for the sword to bear alone.</p>

  <p>True God Pranav had never taken Luo Luo Zheng very seriously. Although the soul pressure Luo Luo Zheng emitted was certainly surprising, in True God Pranav's eyes, he looked like an angry little leopard, running around aimlessly. It was true that he had never expected a secondary creature to fight so extensively, though.</p>

  <p>But no matter how powerful a secondary creature became, the fact remained that it was still a secondary creature. A secondary creature was only condensed by the life vitality of a Holy Being. Before obtaining a Godly Tile, a secondary creature would simply never have the qualifications to fight him. At least, not without the help of Heavenly Destiny.</p>

  <p>Pranav casually reached out his hand in order to simply grab the sword.</p>

  <p>Regardless of speed, strength, or angle of movement, they were all perfect in his eyes. Once this Great Weighty Sword was within his grasp, he knew there was no way he could let it out of his hand. After all, Luo Luo Zheng was just a little lamb, waiting to be slaughtered.</p>

  <p>It only took a split second, once he gripped the Great Weighty Sword, to discover that Luo Zheng's weapon was extraordinarily sturdy!</p>

  <p>A supreme world was as heavy as a thousand great worlds. In other words, this meant that the weight of the Great Weighty Sword was only a thousandth of a supreme world. If Pranav could crush an entire supreme world with nothing but a single stomp, then no matter how heavy this Great Weighty Sword was, never should it have surprised Pranav to such an extent.</p>

  <p>What truly made his face contort was the power that exuded from this Great Weighty Sword.</p>

  <p>"The power?" was all Pranav could utter.</p>

  <p>What radiated from the Great Weighty Sword was a power that he was simply unable to resist.</p>

  <p>The only way he could compare this power was to that of a very few True Gods who specialized in body refining!</p>

  <p>Pranav was wholly confused.</p>

  <p>Pfft!</p>

  <p>Pranav, having originally gripped onto the Great Weighty Sword's blade, now realized the power contained within Luo Zheng's sword was far beyond what he could handle. The Great Weighty Sword quickly broke free from Pranav's fingers and slashed straight toward the fleshy area between his thumb and index finger in an attempt to slash his palm in half.</p>

  <p>Under the Great Weighty Sword's powerful impact, its momentum only continued to increase. It moved upward at what looked like full speed, along Pranav's forearm until it finally sliced his entire arm straight off in a single thrust.</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish! Swish!</p>

  <p>His arm spun violently in the air above his head before hitting the ground a short distance away.</p>

  <p>Pranav, who had been in a total daze up until now, finally reacted. His stern face suddenly flashed with a dark and crazy Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>"Ha! Ha! Ha! To say that I was actually injured by a secondary creature at the world lord level. This is unbelievable! A joke!"</p>

  <p>In the divine land, there was no Heavenly Destiny to be obtained, which meant that once the ordinary creatures had reached the world lord level, they had no other choice but to start breaking through to become True Gods. The gap between a True God and a world lord was like the difference between heaven and earth. So much so that there was a phrase in the divine land that said, "cross the divine gate", which perfectly explained that by crossing the gate, one would become a god. Otherwise, they remained mortal.</p>

  <p>It could easily be said that before becoming a True God, the countless world lords were considered no different than ants on the ground.</p>

  <p>But now the tables had turned! Pranav had just lost an arm due to a world lord! This was absolutely absurd!</p>

  <p>If only Pranav knew the truth, he might have been capable of justifying his situation. After all, Luo Luo Zheng had obtained nearly a third of Holy Jay's strength source. Such strength was indeed not something Pranav could resist.</p>

  <p>It was a pity that Pranav wasn't aware of the facts!</p>

  <p>Once Luo Luo Zheng had succeeded his first strike, he made his next move without a moment's pause. Taking advantage of the fact that his strength source hadn't completely been exhausted, he leaped up into the air. The Great Weighty Sword drew an arc high above before slashing down toward Pranav's head.</p>

  <p>"You've overestimated yourself!"</p>

  <p>Pranav snorted. It was he, though, who had just underestimated his opponent. Of course, this was why Luo Luo Zheng had managed to hurt him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's current abilities in various aspects were rather uneven, not to mention that the gap between him and Pranav was very large.</p>

  <p>Pranav's body wavered in midair for a moment before he flipped his hand and struck Luo Zheng's chest with his palm.</p>

  <p>Although the palm strike was extremely fast and a little unexpected, its power was far from being very great. On the other hand though, the momentum it contained was extremely powerful.</p>

  <p>Pfft!</p>

  <p>Even with the Redemption Armor's protection, Luo Luo Zheng had no way of blocking this power. After the sudden palm strike, five finger marks imprinted themselves into Luo Zheng's chest. His entire body plummeted downward like a shooting star.</p>

  <p>'He didn't die?'</p>

  <p>Pranav thought, as a cold light flashed in his eyes. For that strike alone, he had used at least sixty percent of his strength. He had imagined that this strike would crush Luo Luo Zheng into pieces. He never expected that it would leave nothing but a palm mark on this boy's body!</p>

  <p>This fellow, the one who dared cut off his arm, was definitely unforgivable. Feeling such emotion, Pranav's figure flashed forcefully.</p>

  <p>Prior to launching his next attack, he appeared in the blink of an eye below Luo Luo Zheng. Then, he immediately struck his palm strenuously toward the sky above.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>Again, the power from this palm attack successfully pierced through Luo Zheng's Redemption Armor and came into contact with Luo Zheng's chest. The original palm print on his chest deepened, and a few of his ribs even broke.</p>

  <p>Pfft!</p>

  <p>In the face of Pranav's surprising attack, Luo Luo Zheng simply couldn't muster the power to dodge or resist. He quickly sputtered a mouthful of golden blood before he was sent flying into the air like a rubber ball due to the strike.</p>

  <p>Before Luo Luo Zheng even had the chance to stabilize himself, Pranav appeared at his side once again. This time, he grabbed Luo Zheng's neck with his remaining hand with the intent to rip his head straight off his body!</p>

  <p>The clash between Luo Luo Zheng and Pranav had happened in a split-second. Now, Wynn had jolted out of surprise and was the first to react. He quietly appeared beside Pranav. With a tap of his index finger, a speck of red starlight, barely the size of a mosquito, shot towards Pranav.</p>

  <p>Pranav was originally going to take Luo Zheng's head, but upon noticing the speck of starlight, he immediately frowned, and a slight expression of fear could be read on his face. He let go of Luo Zheng's neck and rolled over, in an attempt to dodge the starlight.</p>

  <p>However, just as he dodged the starlight, Wynn flicked his index finger a second time. A few more dots of red starlight flew out.</p>

  <p>The continuous streams of starlight were causing Pranav to panic. He had no other choice. Now that he had let go of Luo Zheng's neck, he could do nothing but release him completely and retreat. In order to avoid the attack, he dashed backward a good thousand feet.</p>

  <p>Wynn grabbed Luo Luo Zheng and threw him in the opposite direction. He looked at Pranav and coldly said, "You are, after all, a disciple of a Holy Being, a True God! Bullying a world lord is not what a True God should do!"</p>

  <p>Pranav's face was suddenly grim. In his opinion, he could kill Supreme Lords just as he wished, let alone world lords. In this fight though, he had continuously launched several attacks, and yet still failed to kill the boy. In his heart, he was extremely upset.</p>

  <p>Whoosh... Whoosh... Whoosh... Whoosh... Whoosh...</p>

  <p>That was when countless bloody space cracks began appearing directly behind Pranav.</p>

  <p>Within the cracks, one figure after another came into view. The Supreme Lords of the Sacred race had arrived!</p>

  <p>Although Supreme Lords could use the Grand Teleportation to instantly cross several supreme worlds, in comparison to a True God's ability in employing the Grand Teleportation, the distance they traveled didn't hold a candle to what a True God could achieve in the same time span. In other words, it had taken quite some time for the Sacred Supreme Lords to arrive, especially coming from the edge of the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>The Sacred Grand Supreme Lord took a step forward and walked out of the space crack. When he looked at Pranav's broken arm, he was utterly stunned.</p>

  <p>"Sir, your arm... What happened?!"</p>

  <p>As the many Sacred Supreme Lords stepped out one after the next, each of their gazes landed on Pranav. In such a short period of time, Pranav had lost his arm. This was far from being good news for the Sacred race!</p>

  <p>"Shut up!"</p>

  <p>Pranav's face darkened again at the Grand Supreme Lord's question.</p>

  <p>With a shake of his shoulder, the severed arm emitted dots of light. The light quickly condensed itself and formed a new arm. Despite rectifying this, the new arm was far inferior to the previous one.</p>

  <p>As he was condensing his arm, more and more Supreme Lords of the Sacred race arrived at the battle area, each of them with surprise and doubt etched on their faces.</p>

  <p>Above the shattered supreme world, the Supreme Lords of the Evolutionary Universe stood in confrontation with at least one hundred Supreme Lords of the Sacred race. Both sides knew that a fierce battle awaited them. All they could do now was examine one another, looking each other up and down.</p>
