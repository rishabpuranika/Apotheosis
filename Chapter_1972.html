<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>When he noticed Luo Nian looking so excited, Luo Luo Zheng felt rather guilty.</p>

  <p>It was true. He couldn't be considered a dutiful father, and had never even seriously spent any time with his son. However, in his heart, he had made the decision to take time to travel around with him more.</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng had handed the Crown of Destiny over to Wynn, Wynn had told him that something had to be done to the Crown of Destiny and it would take some time.</p>

  <p>Thus, Master Feng had arranged accommodation for Luo Luo Zheng and the others from the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>After dealing with these trivial matters and having everyone settle down, Luo Luo Zheng wasn't in a hurry to discuss the next step. Instead, he took Luo Nian and Ning Yudie out for a trip.</p>

  <p>"If a great world is a unit...</p>

  <p>Then a supreme world is a thousand such units!</p>

  <p>This supreme world is truly vast and endless!"</p>

  <p>Sitting on Luo Zheng's shoulder, Luo Nian let out a cry of surprise in his childish voice.</p>

  <p>The distant mountains that stretched endlessly were like motionless elephants in a deep sleep, emitting a majestic Mu Ning in the heavens and on earth. A single glance at them could make people feel full of power.</p>

  <p>"A supreme world is a thousand great worlds? Who told you that?" Luo Luo Zheng asked, puzzled.</p>

  <p>"It's from the book!" Luo Nian replied with a smile.</p>

  <p>"The book from the library, you mean?" Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes!"</p>

  <p>Luo Nian replied, happily. He then went on to say, "The one million great worlds are the feet. The one hundred thousand supreme worlds are the hands. The stars in the skies above are the internal organs. And as the stars revolve, it's like a living being who begins to breathe, forming a style of its own?"</p>

  <p>"What's the name of this book, Luo Nian?" Although Luo Nian's voice was still young and hadn't begun to change yet, the content of his words was extraordinary. To Luo Luo Zheng, it felt as though he was being enlightened.</p>

  <p>"Summary of Constructing the Universe," answered Luo Nian in an honest, straightforward tone.</p>

  <p>The title wasn't hard to understand. Clearly, this book spoke of what the author had experienced when constructing the universe.</p>

  <p>Constructing an universe was an extremely complex process, and more had to be done to stabilize it on the boundaries of the divine land.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng immediately thought that this book had probably been written by his master Bromley, while he was building his own universe.</p>

  <p>That library was truly a treasure trove. It was a pity that Luo Luo Zheng hadn't taken the time to read through all the ancient books within, and it was thus somewhat of a waste for him to have the library at all.</p>

  <p>Little Luo Nian, on the other hand, who actually enjoyed reading, benefited greatly from the library.</p>

  <p>"As a father, you're too ignorant in front of your son," Ning Yudie said, all while giving a gentle smile. Luo Nian's serious tone when repeating the book's passage made her feel proud. This little guy, who had once given her many headaches, was now beginning to show his true talent and power.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng chuckled. Losing to his son wasn't a big deal. He, too, was proud of Luo Nian.</p>

  <p>Half a day later, after passing through the mountain range, the bustling Strongdell City came creeping into view.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng originally wanted to take Luo Nian to another place to see the magnificent scenery. Luo Nian grabbed Luo Zheng's hand though, pointed at the city beyond and said, "Dad! I want to go to the city!"</p>

  <p>"Sure," Luo Luo Zheng said, immediately agreeing to his son's small request.</p>

  <p>Hence, the couple brought Luo Nian to visit the Strongdell City.</p>

  <p>There were tens of millions of mortals in the city.</p>

  <p>The Sacred race threatened to fight and kill every day, but the vast majority of people still led their day to day lives. They weren't interested in the sounds from the Roaring Tokens continuously ringing in their ears.</p>

  <p>They were only concerned with their daily lives.</p>

  <p>What was more, a large number of them didn't even know about the Celestial Position's existence. They only knew that this place, where they all lived, was called the Strongdell City, and outside of the Strongdell City was the most remote place of the sky. If one wanted to go there, they would have to go through a transmission channel, and 99% of the mortals had never gone through one in their entire lives.</p>

  <p>In other words, to them, the city was their entire world.</p>

  <p>And because their world was small, it was easier for them to be content with what they had.</p>

  <p>Once Luo Luo Zheng and Ning Yudie had successfully concealed their cultivation levels, they slowly walked down the street, hand in hand with Luo Nian.</p>

  <p>Peddlers' cries could be heard as the fragrance of food burst through the air, pouring into their nostrils. The people selling osmanthus cakes, dumplings, wontons and more were all lined up in a row.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing the numerous snacks, Luo Nian couldn't help but become extremely excited.</p>

  <p>The meals he had eaten ever since he was young were personally made by Ning Yudie, and with the help of Imogen, they had gathered various treasures relying on the influence of Cloud Hall in order to make Luo Nian's food. These treasures were definitely capable of helping Luo Nian create a physique that was far superior to that of his peers, but in terms of taste, it wasn't delicious, to say the least.</p>

  <p>The sight and smell of these snacks made Luo Nian drool. He suddenly felt as though this food was probably the best tasting in the world.</p>

  <p>"Dad, I want to eat this, this, and this..." Luo Nian's fingers danced over the snacks, his cheeks flushed. To him, these were delicacies and he couldn't control himself anymore.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng simply nodded his head, "Okay, son, I'll buy them all."</p>

  <p>"It's not good for your health to eat too many of these grains," Ning Yudie said, rather unwilling to let Luo Nian indulge himself in this way.</p>

  <p>When warriors cultivated, they would keep their flesh pure. Therefore, after reaching the nature level, they would have to follow a very strict diet. The grains contained too many impurities and they would precipitate into warriors' bodies after being eaten. Naturally, it would have no effect on Ning Yudie and Luo Luo Zheng if they ate these impurities, but Luo Nian's cultivation was still low, and he had never gone on a fast yet.</p>

  <p>It was simple; too many grains were simply not good for him.</p>

  <p>Seeing Luo Nian pout, Luo Luo Zheng waved his hand and smiled. "Such a little amount of impurity won't be a problem, in my opinion. You've worried far too much, Tia. Luo Nian, you can eat as much as you want today?"</p>

  <p>"No way," Ning Yudie said. She might have pampered Luo Nian a lot in the Cloud Hall, but when it came to the food he ate, she was very strict.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stood in front of Ning Yudie to prevent her from moving forward, all while at the same time giving a little pat on Luo Nian's butt. Luo Nian made a face at Ning Yudie, and then rushed over to the stands like a gust of wind.</p>

  <p>Seeing Luo Luo Zheng spoil Luo Nian so much, Ning Yudie could do nothing but feel helpless, glaring at her husband with grievance.</p>

  <p>When it was time to pay the bill, the hawkers quickly extended their hands toward Luo Luo Zheng. "Sir, eight silver coins, please!"</p>

  <p>"Sir, this apricot cake costs a total of four silver coins..."</p>

  <p>"..."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was slightly startled as he watched these hawkers reach out their hands, asking him to pay money. Immediately, an embarrassed expression appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>Where could he find the money?</p>

  <p>Not only did he not have a single silver coin on him, he didn't have a sliver of gold, either.</p>

  <p>Gold and silver were the most widespread currencies among mortals.</p>

  <p>The currencies used by martial artists were life vitality crystals and life vitality jades.</p>

  <p>The hawkers, now looking at Luo Luo Zheng with palms turned upward also found Luo Zheng's expression to be quite strange.</p>

  <p>Just from Luo Zheng's appearance, who had an impressive physique and remarkable temperament and Yudie's beauty, ordinary mortals could tell at a glance that these were not ordinary people. A mortal would never believe that they could have problems paying such a small sum of money.</p>

  <p>The hawkers didn't dare say anything, though. They simply waited, hands extended, for Luo Luo Zheng to pay the bills. Luo Luo Zheng remained dumbfounded; he truly didn't know what he could use to pay for the food. He couldn't just pull out a life vitality jade. A single life vitality jade, in fact, could probably buy over a hundred streets of this city.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian, who was standing to the side, didn't care about such things and was already engrossed in eating.</p>

  <p>"Tia..." Luo Luo Zheng could only glance at Ning Yudie for help.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie turned her head away with a smile on her face, but didn't respond a single word.</p>

  <p>"Tia," Luo Luo Zheng urged, gently tugging on the corner of her clothes. He was a powerful world lord now, and he wouldn't do such a thing as running away for a few silver coins. This was too shameful. He felt terrible.</p>

  <p>As Ning Yudie saw her husband in such a predicament, her heart softened.</p>

  <p>She rolled her eyes before reaching for her space ring.</p>

  <p>In fact, Ning Yudie didn't usually carry any gold or silver with her either, but she was the kind of woman who always carried plenty of little trinkets along with her. A few of them were made of gold, such as the hairpin she took out from her space ring. She transformed the pin into a number of small golden beads and handed them over to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng saw these gold beads, he let out a sigh of relief. He finally had a way out of this embarrassing situation. However, he didn't expect that when he handed the gold beads to the peddlers, they were all completely overwhelmed.</p>

  <p>"Sir, this is just way too much..."</p>

  <p>"These are pure gold beads, and they are enough to buy my entire shop.</p>

  <p>Besides, I simply don't have enough change to give you?"</p>

  <p>"Eight silver coins is enough, sir. Do you have that amount?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng immediately felt a headache approach as he heard these words. With a flick of his hand and perfect control of his strength, the gold beads fell into the hawkers' pockets. Luo Luo Zheng immediately grabbed Luo Nian by the arm and said, "There's no need for change." He left briskly, leaving no trace behind him.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian tightly grabbed onto the snacks in his hand, completely ignoring the surrounding noises. It was true that this child's greatest ability was to focus.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie leisurely followed behind the two of them. Seeing her husband's actions, squirming beneath the embarrassment, she couldn't help but feel amused. As for the peddlers, they all stood, minds blown, completely dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>Each of them had four to five gold beads in their pockets, which was equivalent to several years of revenue in their business. It wasn't until the immortal-like couple had left far, far away that they finally got back to their senses and realized that they had just made a fortune. They were extremely excited. Although they had guessed at the idea that the couple were not mortals, they were now sure of their guesses. This city was after all a city in the Upper World, and it wasn't at all impossible to encounter rich warriors here!</p>
