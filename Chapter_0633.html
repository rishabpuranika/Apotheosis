<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>But Lasseter's offer was sound and reasonable. After all, these divine textures were not considered as a combat class. They were just the prototypes from Zheng's practice. Even though the efficiency of the runes was better than that of ordinary meditation runes in the Central Region, it was impossible to sell them at an extremely high price. Moreover, Lasseter offered the price because he had never seen such rune pattern in Central Region and thought it was worth studying.</p>

  <p>Felix had bought the first meditation rune for ten supreme crystals out of the sour of the moment. At that time, he wouldn't let Lasseter have it, hence, he instantly bid ten supreme crystals for it. Lasseter was stunned at Felix' offer and decided to just give up. But it turned out, Lasseter got the last laugh.</p>

  <p>Considering what Lasseter had said, Luo Zheng smiled and said, "Deal!"</p>

  <p>Besides, he had nothing to lose. These were just his prototype and five supreme crystals were more than enough.</p>

  <p>"No! I object! That's not fair!" After hearing Luo Zheng agreed with the deal, Felix was pissed off. He had just paid ten supreme crystals for just one meditation rune. But soon after, Luo Zheng had agreed to give Lasseter seven meditation runes for half the amount what he paid for one. He felt scammed. He wouldn't allow Lasseter to get the seven runes for only five supreme crystals.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" Luo Zheng was not the type to hold grudges, but Felix's scornful words echoed in his ears. It was as if Felix intentionally embarrassed him in front of another person, and that was something he wouldn't let go easily.</p>

  <p>"I gave you ten supreme crystals for one rune just now, so how come he can buy all seven runes for five supreme crystals only? That's quite a difference, and it's not fair!" Felix said with bitterness. He felt like he was cheated by Luo Zheng. The happiness of acquiring a rune with Perfect Brushwork was replaced by anger and bitterness towards Luo Zheng and Lasseter. Though it was easy for a runic expert like Felix to make money, the ten supreme crystals were still a great deal of money for him.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Luo Zheng said with a cold smile, "I didn't force you to buy the rune for ten supreme crystals, did I?"</p>

  <p>"No, you didn't," Felix said as he shook his head. "But–,"</p>

  <p>"So, that's it! Our deal is done, so don't ruin this next deal for me!" Luo Zheng said. He sat down on a chair without looking at Felix. He turned to Lasseter and said, "Please settle the account and then give me the painting materials on my list."</p>

  <p>With a triumphant smile, Lasseter carefully sorted out the seven meditation runes while telling his helper to prepare the materials on the list. He felt victorious not only by acquiring the seven runes at a small price, but also being one step ahead of Felix on this deal.</p>

  <p>Felix was pulling a long face now, but he could do nothing. He looked at the rune which cost him ten supreme crystals and told himself he wouldn't be so imprudent in the future. It was a lesson that he learned at a high cost.</p>

  <p>He wanted to get his money back from Luo Zheng by all means. But he suddenly remembered that his main task was to embarrass Luo Zheng. How could he almost forget it?</p>

  <p>Felix thought to himself, 'Wait a minute! Luo Zheng kept on saying that these meditation runes were drawn by himself. Maybe it is true! Otherwise, he couldn't have gotten the eight identical runes. The runic expert must at least achieve master level before acquiring the talent of Perfect Brushwork. Each rune is a priceless item for any runic expert, and they wouldn't let anyone have it unless for a higher price. So, why would a master, even if he is a nameless hermit, give his works to such a young fellow?'</p>

  <p>There was only one way to prove his assumption, and that was to ask Luo Zheng himself. Felix cleared his throat, and asked, "Did you really draw these runes?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was getting irritated, but there was no use to get mad at Felix. He just nodded casually, "I believe I have told you a hundred times already. I don't like repeating myself."</p>

  <p>"But…" Felix wanted his argument to be good as to not let Luo Zheng dodge the question. He stuttered at first, but with his fast thinking, he suddenly came up with a good idea. He took out a runic pen from his space ring and set painting papers and ink on the table. He then said, "To see is to believe. Now, show us what you've got! Prove it right now!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked at the runic pen that Felix was forcefully handing him and winked, "There's no need for me to prove anything to you."</p>

  <p>"You must! If you claim to have written these runes by yourself, then, you must prove it. Otherwise, you're just blabbering and that's bad for business," Felix said hastily. His desperate action to embarrass Luo Zheng didn't do any good to his reputation. As the chief runic expert of Cloud Hall and an elite of the Internal Elixir Realm, he had been looked up to by Luo Zheng. But now, something about his actions made Luo Zheng think twice.</p>

  <p>"Sorry, I'm not interested!" Luo Zheng said. He pushed aside the runic pen and took the five supreme crystals and the painting materials from Lasseter.</p>

  <p>He was about to leave when Felix suddenly headed him off and begged,</p>

  <p>"Come on, please!"</p>

  <p>Lasseter watched how Felix tried to embarrass himself. He just shook his head in disappointment. In the Cloud Hall, Felix was considered more honorable than the Elders. With his status in Cloud Hall, he was respected by everyone. No one imagined that he would be a nibble humble pie in front of an inferior.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stopped. He stared at Felix then turned his eye at the livid runic pen.</p>

  <p>He then suddenly said with a smile, "Fine! Looks like you give me no choice! I will do it in one condition."</p>

  <p>"Name it!" Felix asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>"If I can prove that I drew these runes myself, you will give me your runic pen." Luo Zheng chuckled. He looked at Felix carefully, studying the changes in his facial expression. Deep down, Luo Zheng was enjoying every bit of this deal.</p>

  <p>Felix had dug his own grave by challenging Luo Zheng. If he agreed and Luo Zheng lost, he could gain back not only his reputation but also embarrass Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>But what if he lost and Luo Zheng could prove that he wrote the runes himself?</p>

  <p>He was in a dilemma right now. He couldn't afford to lose his special runic pen to an inferior.</p>
