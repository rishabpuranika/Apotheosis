<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Evil Karma could scorch a person like fire, so the name of Karma Fire was given. That was a purely evil fire, which among other things, was also the name of the fire set in hell by the guilty.</p>

  <p>In Buddhism, there were two kinds of fire that were the most powerful, both equally as strong. One was the Emptiness Fire of the Bodhisattvas and the other was the Karma Fire.</p>

  <p>Known to all were the unimaginable virtuous merits of the Bodhisattvas, and how karma touched all creatures was unfathomable.</p>

  <p>"I believe the green lotus lives in a corrupted, evil world, but it remains unaffected. It yearns to burn everything throughout the world and turn it into hell with endlessly burning fires..."</p>

  <p>The burning Green Lotus Karma Fire that appeared in Patrick's hand, divided into two flames. One was large, and the other was small. The small one had hundreds of lotus blossoms and tried to burn Lily, while the vast Green Lotus Karma Fire in Acalanatha's virtual shadow hand immediately slammed to the ground.</p>

  <p>The power of the Green Lotus Karma Fire was incomprehensible.</p>

  <p id="top_14">After the small Karma Fire lunged at the normally malicious, aggressive Lily, she lost the spirit to fight, unexpectedly.</p>

  <p>Although Lily had much malicious Mu Ning, and she wasn't weak, there was no way she would be able to resist for long. Luo Zheng saw that and got her to retreat with the Steamer Sword.</p>

  <p>Lily transformed into blips of bright light before re-entering Zheng's body, and Luo Zheng quickly placed the Streamer Sword into his space ring.</p>

  <p>Step by step, Luo Zheng fought Patrick, and forcibly made him release the fires.</p>

  <p>The commoners were enraged, and blood splattered all around within five steps. If the emperor was furious, millions of people would die!</p>

  <p>Everything worldwide would burn when the Buddha was seething.</p>

  <p>The Green Lotus Karma Fire spread with an overwhelming momentum making it hard for the Cloud Sect's hundred thousand disciples on the field to breathe. There was screaming and yelling as they panicked, bolting and trampling each other as they scurried for safety.</p>

  <p>Some disciples were smarter.</p>

  <p>They watched the others as though it were a play, even though, if the Green Lotus Karma Fire kept burning, everything would turn into dust.</p>

  <p>Such things had occurred several times before, when battles on the competition field injured spectating disciples, like the time the dragon roared during Zheng's competition against Jacques, which left many disciples at the All Peaks Competition wounded.</p>

  <p>Although the competing disciples at the All Peaks Competition were the top ranked of each peak, there were about a hundred thousand disciples watching them today, and they were much weaker than the ones before.</p>

  <p>If they hadn't run they would be burned to dust now.</p>

  <p>However, the Buddha was able to restrain the Karma Fire and wouldn't let it hurt innocent creatures.</p>

  <p>When the immense Green Lotus Karma Fire that was in the hand of the Acalanatha virtual shadow smashed, suddenly, obscure, mysterious symbols appeared on the ground of the field, imprisoning the massive Green Lotus Karma Fire.</p>

  <p>Around them, the elders noticed Patrick's blow was too powerful, and they prepared to steady the light curtain of the enchanted barrier by joining hands. But, they stopped, standing there staring, as they noticed that the Green Lotus Karma Fire wasn't spreading beyond the field. It was being contained!</p>

  <p>One of the elders shook his head and sighed, "The fire of the Buddha is special. I've never seen a cultivation method able to restrict its power to spread." The elder speaking had such strength and insight that he could launch as powerful an attack as Patrick, but, he wasn't able to limit the power within the competition field precisely.</p>

  <p>"Since the flame can't spread, it is more concentrated on the field, and its power is more focused and more powerful. Luo Zheng must be miserable..." added another elder as he bobbed his head in agreement.</p>

  <p>As the disciples noticed that the horrible Green Lotus Karma Fire wouldn't spread beyond the field, they calmed down. But, the area and Luo Zheng were engulfed in the burning Karma Fires.</p>

  <p>The Karma Fire had a peculiar effect, though. With only a glance, the onlookers would feel their emotions being stirred as their darkest deeds resurfaced within, and left them with the feelings of blame rising, which would incinerate them.</p>

  <p>"Wow! I am merely watching the flames, and my eyes ache! How much more intense this is in the field! I wonder how it will feel being burned in it?"</p>

  <p>"Why not go find out? Since the Karma Fire is from the lowest regions of hell, it will surely make you happy!"</p>

  <p>"I wonder how Luo Zheng will feel in the Karma Fire. Can he resist the Karma Fire's hellish burning?"</p>

  <p>At this juncture, most people weren't worried whether Luo Zheng would win or lose, but they were too concerned about his safety! After all, Patrick's Karma Fire Hell was so dreadful and was a deadly kill.</p>

  <p>They thought it was a mistake earlier, when Luo Zheng kept constantly pushing Patrick, who was Acalanatha's reincarnation. Why would Luo Zheng think anything good would come from harassing Buddha?</p>

  <p>As the Cloud Sect's most talented disciple throughout history, would Luo Zheng have his downfall?</p>

  <p>Nina's face was etched with deep lines of worry. She might be down because Zheng's performance outshone hers, but, that didn't mean she didn't care about him!</p>

  <p>Just then, the onlookers saw a single person trying to walk onto the field.</p>

  <p>It was Yan!</p>

  <p>She didn't know if her elder brother could survive the Karma Fire Hell, and all she knew was that she couldn't stand by, doing nothing, while he was in danger!</p>

  <p>Yan summoned her life vitality into a streamer to get closer to the field quickly. The life vitality formed a circle and flew around her. Instantly, it turned into spikes of flashes of black light. She knew she had to break the enchanted barrier before getting onto the field.</p>

  <p>Just then one of the elders appeared in front of Yan, blocking her.</p>

  <p>"You aren't allowed to enter the field. There hasn't been a declaration of who the winner or loser is," said the elder as he authoritatively floated there with his hands clasped behind him.</p>

  <p>Yan had competed in the All Peaks Competition. How could she not know the rules? Unless one side admitted defeat or became comatose, it wouldn't be decided. But, they couldn't just allow Luo Zheng to be seen burning in the Karma Fire Hell. How could that even be judged?</p>

  <p>"Move Aside!" said Yan, her beautiful, bright eyes shone with a cold fire. From her point of view, the competition rules were nothing in comparison to her brother's safety!</p>

  <p>"The rules of the competition are what they are, and I'm afraid I cannot move aside," said the elder shaking his head.</p>

  <p>Yan stared at the Karma Fire as it burned more and more ferociously, and a fierce killing intention lit up her cold eyes as her body's life vitality emerged, pouring out endlessly, turning into multiple black spikes. Each spike had a gloomy light flashing and they aimed themselves at the elder.</p>

  <p>"Do you want to fight me?" asked the elder in a deep voice. A huge astrolabe emerged from the elder's body, and the great force of a starry sky appeared.</p>

  <p>This left the elder at an unexpected stalemate with Yan.</p>

  <p>Since no one could see what was going on in the burning fire, the dispute outside the field easily drew their attention.</p>

  <p>"Look, down there everyone! It looks like there's about to be a fight!</p>

  <p>Wait! Isn't she the girl in the veil that Luo Zheng greeted earlier?"</p>

  <p>"She's about the same age as us, and yet, she is brazen enough to confront an elder, and her momentum isn't inferior..."</p>

  <p>"Is that his woman? It looks like she's trying to save Luo Zheng. Why are all his women so powerful? It's not fair!"</p>

  <p>There was no doubt that every elder at the Cloud Sect was monstrous, and a hundred years old at least, so they couldn't be weak, but, Yan didn't even think about that.</p>

  <p>Yan and the elder were about to battle, when someone suddenly shouted,</p>

  <p>"WHAT?! Look! Everyone, look! I think I just saw Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>"Really?! Luo Zheng wasn't turned into ashes by the Karma Fire? Huh? Wow!</p>

  <p>And check it out! His body is shining bright like a golden light. Has this guy cultivated the Body of the Diamond-like State?" said another onlooker as he stared over at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Yan turned towards the onlooker, and then, following his stare, she looked out and saw her brother. As expected, Luo Zheng was bathed in a golden light. Enveloped in the flames of the Green Lotus Karma Fire, Luo Zheng was unharmed, and tiny golden whirlpools covering his body seemed to be absorbing the flames touching him?!</p>

  <p>The Karma Fire power was so horrific though, so, how was her brother able to absorb the fires into himself? How could his organs bear the burning of the Karma Fire?</p>

  <p>Yan was puzzled that Luo Zheng wasn't being injured by the Green Lotus Karma Fires, but, she was also relieved to see he was okay. She looked at the elder with a seemingly apologetic look.</p>

  <p>Looking down at the slight frame of the girl, the elder couldn't stay mad, and let it go. He shook his head, believing the girl just cared too much for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Amidst the Karma Fire Hell, Patrick felt as though he'd fallen into an ice house! He couldn't feel the heat of the Karma Fires, and stared blankly at Luo Zheng...</p>

  <p>'This guy isn't even afraid of the Karma Fire? And now he is actually absorbing the fire?' Patrick thought he must be going crazy.</p>
