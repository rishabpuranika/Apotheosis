  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Dark Star was astonishingly heavy.</p>

  <p>At a rather terrifying speed, Wynn had stomped down on the star from the deep sky and proceeded to charge into the channel with terrifying momentum.</p>

  <p>Previously, the Sacred Grand Supreme Lord had taken advantage of the Murphy Universe's momentum in an attempt to move the Dark Star away, but he still failed.</p>

  <p>No one expected the Dark Star to be forcefully blown away by Pranav right then and there.</p>

  <p>Bam!</p>

  <p>In the Evolutionary Universe, the Dark Star was blasted straight out of the channel? it drew a parabola in the sky before crashing directly into the supreme world.</p>

  <p>How could this supreme world bear the weight of the Dark Star?</p>

  <p>The moment it fell to the ground, it seemed to sink until it disappeared without a trace as if it had fallen into water instead of land.</p>

  <p>Then, Pranav walked out from the other end of the channel and sniffed around. When he felt the sealing power of the supreme world, he frowned.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords that followed Pranav into the channel could also feel the strong restraints.</p>

  <p>Although some Supreme Lords tried condensing the Space Law, the moment it was formed, the Law Power collapsed and disappeared without a trace.</p>

  <p>"I don't feel happy about this?" Pranav said flatly.</p>

  <p>Breaking the seal of a supreme world was a rather troublesome task, but Pranav had no intention of doing so.</p>

  <p>Extending one of his legs, he lightly stomped on the ground until a mild Mu Ning spread out from the tip of his foot.</p>

  <p>Rumble, rumble, rumble?</p>

  <p>A faint wavy line spread from Pranav's toes until it grew throughout the entire supreme world. Then, the supreme world began vibrating with the same frequency as the wavy line.</p>

  <p>In this supreme world, there were also many Sacred martial artists that survived, as well as a great number of mortals.</p>

  <p>Just then, they saw countless tiny cracks opening up beneath their feet.</p>

  <p>Such was not an ordinary earthquake as normal ones caused the earth to shake and the mountains to tremble. If it was a normal earthquake, it would have been violent. But this kind of vibration was rather mild with an extremely high frequency.</p>

  <p>It lasted for half a minute before an ear-piercing sound echoed throughout the entire supreme world.</p>

  <p>Crack, crack, crack, crack?</p>

  <p>In an instant, the huge supreme world disintegrated into hundreds of millions of clumps of earth the size of watermelons as they began dispersing downward.</p>

  <p>All the mortals began falling along with the clumps and only a fraction of martial artists who could fly managed to escape the calamity. But, it was impossible for these martial artists with lower cultivation levels to cross a supreme world. Once they exhausted all their life vitality in the air, they fell and got smashed to pieces.</p>

  <p>The Star Sealing Technique was used on the supreme world? once the supreme world was destroyed, the technique would follow suit and collapse.</p>

  <p>When the Sacred Grand Supreme Lord and all the warriors that followed him witnessed the scene, their eyes widened in shock.</p>

  <p>While Supreme Lords had methods to destroy a supreme world, it was difficult for any Supreme Lord to destroy a supreme world to such a degree. What was more terrifying was how Pranav had done it with a single stomp? his power went beyond the comprehension of anyone present.</p>

  <p>"Is that really the power of a True God?"</p>

  <p>"This could be done using the 'momentum.' Why did the Grand Supreme Lord fail to achieve this?"</p>

  <p>"The Grand Supreme Lord does have the Heavens-suppressing Object but in the end, he's merely borrowing it. The momentum doesn't belong to the Grand Supreme Lord himself."</p>

  <p>Having seen a lot of the world, the Sacred Supreme Lords were still shocked and busy discussing the matter in private.</p>

  <p>Raising his head, Pranav looked toward the depths of the Evolutionary Universe. Then, he lightly said, "Everyone, follow me."</p>

  <p>With that, he sped forward, barely causing any energy fluctuations. He was only a dozen feet ahead before turning into a blazing human-shaped silhouette and disappearing before the many Sacred Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>"Follow him!"</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Lord waved his hand, leading the Sacred Supreme Lords in using Grand Teleportation to advance toward the depths of the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, within the shattered Sunflower Water World?</p>

  <p>When Wynn sensed that the Sacred race was somehow breaking the Star Sealing Technique he had arranged, he warned Luo Luo Zheng and the others right away.</p>

  <p>But only after a short while, Wynn got something new through his perception and once again, he warned everyone, "They've already broken the seal?"</p>

  <p>"How could they be so fast?"</p>

  <p>"You set that seal up, Wynn!"</p>

  <p>"Is it true that their True God got involved?"</p>

  <p>Everyone had expected Wynn's technique to hold up for a few months or at the very least, a few days. No one expected it to last for just a while.</p>

  <p>In the battle of the Sunflower Water World, they had killed over 50 Sacred Supreme Lords. The powerful warriors in the Evolutionary Universe didn't even have time to rest before facing an even more brutal battle. The Sacred race had charged with full force, including even a powerful True God.</p>

  <p>Everyone in the Sunflower Water World knew that this was going to be a tough battle.</p>

  <p>"Since we've attacked this time, there's no way to retreat," said Master Feng calmly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, there's no way back. We can only move forward and go all out to fight them," Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment agreed with a nod.</p>

  <p>"There's no point in talking any further. We'll wait for them here?" The beautiful eyes of Supreme Lord of Oracle were filled with determination.</p>

  <p>As she had reached the level of Supreme Lord, she had long seen through life and death and was well aware that it was the moment she died that the true meaning of death would be fulfilled.</p>

  <p>"Arrange the array!" Supreme Lord of Original Sin took action immediately, working with the leaders of the other three great clans and setting up the Star Destroying Array.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Healum summoned Luo Luo Zheng and Xun to his side? he was going to connect them with the Space Lock. As strong as Luo Luo Zheng and Xun were, they were still world lords. Fighting against Supreme Lords would put them at a disadvantage. Only with Supreme Lord Healum's Heavenly Destiny could they display their strongest combat strength.</p>

  <p>But just then?</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh?</p>

  <p>Mu Ning still sat on the huge warship. Previously, she had been at the edge of the Sunflower Water World, controlling the Gods Killing Sword Array. Although the warship wasn't particularly slow, it still wasn't nearly as fast as a Supreme Lord, so she had only just arrived.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>Ever since she entered the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, she had been searching for Luo Luo Zheng, but to no avail. Then, she was taken away by a mysterious individual before receiving the complete inheritance of the Gods Killing Sword Array.</p>

  <p>Many warriors had died in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land but her cultivation journey had fared rather well. Still, she wasn't exactly satisfied? she was expecting to be able to cultivate together with Luo Luo Zheng in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, but after returning to the Evolutionary Universe, she hadn't even seen Luo Luo Zheng once. Now that she saw him again, it was natural for her to hope he could stick close to her.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh! Whoosh?"</p>

  <p>After Mu Ning called out, she leaped down from the warship, clad in a long purple coat. The gauze ribbon trailed behind her. With a swishing sound, she left a trace in the air and threw herself right into Luo Zheng's arms.</p>

  <p>Beside him, Xun had just established a link with Supreme Lord Healum's Space Lock. Upon seeing Luo Zheng's interaction with Mu Ning, her eyes suddenly flashed a deep red, releasing the malicious Mu Ning hidden within the Faith Energy.</p>

  <p>Resting her head on Luo Zheng's chest, Mu Ning talked about her experiences after going to the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land and how she longed for him. But then her gaze went past Luo Zheng's shoulder and landed on Xun.</p>

  <p>Perhaps she had sensed the malicious Mu Ning from Xun's eyes.</p>

  <p>Xi Youqin's own eyes narrowed as she spoke to Xun, sounding surprised, "Xun, you've finally found your body?"</p>

  <p>It was no secret that women were more sensitive when it came to emotions. From the moment Luo Luo Zheng met Mu Ning, Xun had always existed as a soul, so she never considered her as a rival. But now that Xun had a complete physical body, the situation had changed.</p>

  <p>Hearing Xi Youqin's seemingly surprised tone laced with ridicule, Luo Luo Zheng felt a headache coming on. At such a critical time, what on earth was Mu Ning thinking?</p>

  <p>Just as he was about to chime in, Xun snorted coldly and turned around, ignoring Mu Ning completely.</p>

  <p>With a personality far from Yudie's, Xun was a woman of few words. While it was natural that she wasn't fond of Mu Ning, she wasn't going to argue with Mu Ning because of Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Alright, hurry and head back. True God might arrive here at any moment and we need you to take charge of the sword array. Once this battle ends, we'll have time to catch up," Luo Luo Zheng gently patted Xi Youqin's back with comforting yet persuasive words. Reluctantly, she finally let go of Luo Luo Zheng. The thought of Luo Zheng's promise to marry her invaded her thoughts and she gave him a sweet smile before turning around and floating towards the warship.</p>

  <p>But just as she floated away, a blazing human silhouette suddenly appeared in the air.</p>

  <p>After the Space Law on the silhouette dissipated, a young man in black came into view. It was Pranav who rushed there first. Indifferently, he gave Mu Ning an indifferent glance. She assumed that the young man was some Supreme Lord of the human race.</p>

  <p>"Huh..."</p>

  <p>Immediately, Pranav's hand shot out like a bolt of lightning. With little to no effort, he grabbed Xi Youqin's neck. Then, there was a crisp sound before he jerked Xi Youqin's head to the side.</p>

  <p> </p>
