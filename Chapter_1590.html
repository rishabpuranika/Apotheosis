  <p>
</p>

  <p>When the short warrior stepped aside to make way for Luo Luo Zheng, everyone's eyes fell on the latter.</p>

  <p>He was the only one out of the remaining eight warriors who had yet to attack the massive rock.</p>

  <p>Giving Janet a soft smile, he walked toward the square rock.</p>

  <p>All eyes were focused on him as the other warriors wondered what method he would use to attack.</p>

  <p>But when Luo Luo Zheng took his stance, everyone's expression turned disappointed.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng merely took on a horse stance, clenching his right fist as he stared straight ahead at the rock in front of him.</p>

  <p>It seemed as though he was preparing for a normal punch.</p>

  <p>'Doesn't he care about Illusion Points at all?' they wondered.</p>

  <p>Although the short warrior's palm strike just then seemed ordinary, they could tell that it was composed of profound skills? the control he had over his strength was already at such a high level that his attack looked so leisurely from a close distance.</p>

  <p>"Tianxing, are you really going to hit the rock with just your fist? Don't you want to use a weapon?" Janet asked. Janet couldn't help but suggest that he use a weapon, believing it would help him gain more points.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng only shook his head. "There is no need."</p>

  <p>Though he understood Janet's doubt, he couldn't be bothered to explain further.</p>

  <p>After activating all the 40, 000 dragon scales, the strength of his physical body was probably comparable to the might of the Gods-intimidating Strike. But his physical strength had its own limitations? warriors rarely engaged in close combat during a fight, urging him to use the Gods-intimidating Strike and other skills more often.</p>

  <p>After all the power of the dragon scales flowed into his right fist, he threw a rather ordinary punch.</p>

  <p>But no one knew exactly how terrifying the power in this punch was.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng's fist landed on the surface of the square rock, everyone heard a dull thud.</p>

  <p>"Ha! Looks like he's at the bottom of us all!" The ogre warrior grinned and remarked from behind.</p>

  <p>Like Luo Luo Zheng, he attacked the rock with merely an ordinary punch, obtaining only around 400, 000 Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>As an ogre, his natural physical strength was already much stronger than an ordinary human warrior's. Even though he had used less than sixty percent of his full strength, he felt rather confident that his strength still surpassed this human warrior's.</p>

  <p>But after Luo Luo Zheng retracted his fist, several spots of the Illusion Points started to fly out of the rock like before.</p>

  <p>One, two?</p>

  <p>These yellow luminous spots were like fireflies dancing in the air as they radiated from the surface of the rock.</p>

  <p>Everyone stared at these spots, their faces gradually growing in doubt.</p>

  <p>After a few moments, only several hundred Illusion Points were emitted from the rock? it was a much smaller number than anyone had expected.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng didn't look nervous at all and merely stared indifferently at the rock in front of him.</p>

  <p>"Even though you want to be at the bottom, you don't have to do that badly, my friend. This is too miserable!" the ogre warrior snorted and burst out laughing. Clearly, his mood had lifted. Though Luo Luo Zheng attacked the rock in deadly earnest, he obtained only a few hundred Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>Such a number could only be described as miserable.</p>

  <p>But before the ogre was done laughing, several yellow specks of light suddenly flashed out from all directions of the square rock.</p>

  <p>It was as if Luo Luo Zheng poked a hornet's nest? the specks of light swarmed out like hornets, forming a river of light that flowed continuously into Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>While the broad grin remained glued to the ogre warrior's face, complacency quickly disappeared from his eyes. His mouth was still wide open as his expression turned from disdain to surprise.</p>

  <p>"What? Why? This?" So surprised, he couldn't even form a complete sentence.</p>

  <p>The others were also staring blankly at Luo Luo Zheng as they watched the river of Illusion Points flowing toward him. All of them were transfixed with astonishment.</p>

  <p>Janet and the short warrior also found their eyes widening in shock at the scene.</p>

  <p>Their gazes turned to Luo Luo Zheng with solemnity? they were certain that Luo Luo Zheng hadn't used any martial skills just then.</p>

  <p>All he used was a straight jab that any warrior could execute.</p>

  <p>To obtain so many Illusion Points from the rock with a single punch meant only one thing? Luo Zheng's physical strength had already reached an unimaginable degree.</p>

  <p>Swish, swish, swish!</p>

  <p>Countless Illusion Points continued flowing into Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>The other warriors all turned envious of the great flow of points.</p>

  <p>Originally, they were already content obtaining several million Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>But now that Luo Luo Zheng was absorbing such a vast amount of points, the rest grew frustrated. Although they had all faced the same danger in the Hall of Causality, the difference in their rewards was just too great.</p>

  <p>Estimating the number of Illusion Points Luo Luo Zheng earned, it was probably ten times greater than what they had obtained.</p>

  <p>But no one could deny that the opportunity was indeed fair. All had a chance to earn their points. Since they earned so little compared to Luo Luo Zheng, they only had themselves to blame for not attacking the rock harder.</p>

  <p>On another thought, they realized something else.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Luo Zheng had acquired ten times as many Illusion Points as them, did it mean that Luo Zheng's strength was also ten times as strong as theirs?</p>

  <p>They thought it was impossible.</p>

  <p>All of them were core geniuses of their races. How could they actually admit that they were weaker than someone else? The large gap in points hurt their pride.</p>

  <p>Too many factors could affect the outcome of a fight between warriors, after all. It was impossible for the gap between their and Luo Zheng's strength to be that wide.</p>

  <p>But a problem remained? Luo Luo Zheng had only used one punch. Obviously, that wasn't his trump card. As they pondered on this thought, they increasingly felt that Luo Luo Zheng was too unfathomable.</p>

  <p>After absorbing all the Illusion Points, Luo Luo Zheng closed his eyes for a while and checked the number.</p>

  <p>When he opened his eyes again, the ogre warrior anxiously asked,</p>

  <p>"How? how many points did you get?"</p>

  <p>"10.4 million," Luo Luo Zheng replied flatly.</p>

  <p>"What? 10 million!"</p>

  <p>The ogre exclaimed hysterically.</p>

  <p>This number far exceeded anyone's imagination. The number of points the ogre had obtained earlier was merely a tiny fraction of this huge number.</p>

  <p>"I've already used my full strength after employing the Buddhist token.</p>

  <p>Even in the Blessed Buddha Land where geniuses are common, there are very few who could surpass me? But this guy's physical strength alone is three times stronger than mine," uttered the short warrior to himself.</p>

  <p>Upon witnessing the scene, he estimated the gap of strength between him and Luo Luo Zheng from the number of Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>Janet, on the other hand, only remained silent at this moment. Wearing a smile, she looked at Luo Luo Zheng with deep interest.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Luo Zheng had absorbed ten million Illusion Points at once, the total number of Illusion Points in his body rapidly increased.</p>

  <p>After paying five million Illusion Points earlier, his ranking dropped from the upper part of the pyramid.</p>

  <p>But with this flow of points, his rank skyrocketed once again.</p>

  <p>In the entirety of the Illusion Battlefield, he now ranked 9200th among all the warriors.</p>

  <p>In the present supreme world, his ranking had reached up to the top 100.</p>

  <p>With that one move, he managed to earn back the five million points he paid and more.</p>

  <p>Since he was the last attack, cracks suddenly appeared on the surface of the square rock until it became a mere pile of dust.</p>

  <p>Everyone sighed as they looked ahead to their upcoming journey.</p>

  <p>Just at the second Hall of Causality, they had obtained such a large number of Illusion Points. What could possibly happen next?</p>

  <p>Although there was hope there, they also had rather big worries.</p>

  <p>The difficulty of the second Hall of Causality wasn't low by any means? two people had already been killed here. What could happen in the third Hall of Causality?</p>

  <p>After passing through the hall's exit, they once again stepped onto the stairs and continued up the mountain.</p>

  <p>On their way, Janet suddenly broke the silence and offered, "Let's introduce ourselves to each other. We need cooperation to pass through these halls, after all. We should at least know each other's names, right?"</p>

  <p>Through their previous cooperation, they had accepted each other as mere temporary companions. But after everything they had to go through, the trust they had in each other leveled up.</p>

  <p>Hearing Janet's words, the short warrior from the Blessed Buddha Land replied first, "My name is Jeffrey Jin."</p>

  <p>"Jeffrey? Are you that famous monk in the Blessed Buddha Land?"</p>

  <p>Hearing his name, a human warrior behind him inquired, sounding surprised.</p>

  <p>With a smile, Jeffrey offered a nod. "Yes, that's me."</p>

  <p>"I'm Tianxing Luo," Luo Luo Zheng added.</p>

  <p>"I'm Coleman!" The ogre replied loudly.</p>

  <p>The Demon Night woman blinked softly and said, "My name is Hailey."</p>

  <p>?</p>

  <p>After everyone introduced themselves, Janet smiled and said, "You are all very honest. Only Tianxing used a fake name!"</p>
