<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng squeezed himself between the walls of the narrow passageway and found that he was on the second floor of the dungeon.</p>

  <p>However, the scene that unfolded in front of him had left Luo Zheng completely dumbstruck.</p>

  <p>The second floor of the dungeon was vast, and it was about several hundred feet in depth. This was in contrast to the constricted space of the dungeon's first floor. This floor seemed far more spacious.</p>

  <p>Eight silver discs were mounted on the ceiling, floor, and walls of the dungeon. Each of these discs had a Fairy Chain attached to it, which extended to the center of the dungeon. At the end of the Fairy Chains was a person bound in them...</p>

  <p>The Fairy Chains were wrapped tightly around the person like a cocoon.</p>

  <p>There were no discernible features to recognize the person's appearance.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng noticed countless slender hair strands that stretched out from the gaps between the chains and extended further onto the ground.</p>

  <p>'Is it a woman?' Luo Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>Although it was him who enslaved this person by using the Enslaving Token, he didn't try to explore the memories of the person's soul. When he had heard the voice from the second floor, Luo Zheng wasn't able to distinguish if the person who spoke was a man or a woman.</p>

  <p>An alabaster arm was visible from a small gap between the Fairy Chains.</p>

  <p>The arm was pale and slender, as if it was carved out of white jade. It had an elegantly beautiful form. There was a high chance that this hand had thrown the Enslaving Token to Luo Zheng earlier.</p>

  <p>'Is this person's cultivation level too high that it requires so many Fairy Chains to restrain her?' Luo Zheng wondered.</p>

  <p>He advanced towards the cocoon and said, "Let me help you unravel the chains."</p>

  <p>When he finished speaking, he activated the heaven token again. Cracks riddled the Fairy Chains and they crumbled before disintegrating, like silk that was reeled off from a cocoon.</p>

  <p>Little by little, a naked body was revealed in front of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Usually, when a warrior reached a certain level of cultivation, they were expected to have a thorough understanding of physical bodies and how they functioned.</p>

  <p>Soul Sea Realm warriors lived for thousands of years, and they had seen all kinds of beautiful creatures. As for the higher level warriors, and even True Gods, they could live for an even longer period of time. They were no longer amazed by beauty; all creatures were just vessels in their eyes.</p>

  <p>A True God like Wayne, who cared a lot about his looks, was a rare case.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng was only forty years old. He still felt a little awkward when an extremely beautiful woman appeared in front of him stark naked. She radiated a glow that was as bright and clear as the moonlight.</p>

  <p>There seemed to be some kind of enchantment hidden within her body that made it impossible for Luo Zheng to look away.</p>

  <p>But out of respect, Luo Zheng still forced his face to one side.</p>

  <p>After the Fairy Chains were all removed, rays of soft blue light surrounded the woman's body. These rays of soft light formed bands of light that intertwined with each other and covered the private parts of her body. Soon, the light turned into a simple and conservative blue dress.</p>

  <p>She floated down slowly, fluttering her long dress. Her slender and well-proportioned legs were visible underneath the dress, as they bent slightly before the soles of her bare feet touched the ground.</p>

  <p>Only then did Luo Zheng dare raise his head to carefully examine the enchanting woman's features.</p>

  <p>Ever since he had ascended to the Upper World, almost all the women he had seen were beauties. As the warriors in the Upper World cultivated themselves, it became easy for them to change their appearance at will.</p>

  <p>All it took them was a thought to maintain their young looks. What differentiated the beauties in the Upper World were their individual temperaments. For example, Xun was enthusiastic under her aloof facade, and Ning Yudie was graceful with her delicate looks.</p>

  <p>However, the woman in front of Luo Zheng gave off a mysterious Mu Ning that he couldn't exactly figure out.</p>

  <p>Humans were creatures with instinctive curiosity. Oftentimes, mystery represented a strong attraction...</p>

  <p>Saul had mentioned that this woman focused on the cultivation methods regarding the soul. Supposedly, it was because of this that she gave off such a strange Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>"What's your name?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>The woman smiled faintly. Each of her movements seemingly exuded a mysterious charm, which caused Luo Zheng to be attracted to her involuntarily.</p>

  <p>It confused him tremendously. "You are indeed very righteous. You didn't pry into my memories when you enslaved me!"</p>

  <p>After she was enslaved by Luo Zheng, it was equivalent to having exposed everything about herself to him. Luo Zheng only needed to look through her memories to know every single tiny thing that had happened in her life.</p>

  <p>"I said that I didn't need to enslave anyone, and I wouldn't pry into your memories," Luo Zheng replied. "I just need some help and that is what I came here for."</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter." The woman stepped forward, barefoot, and gracefully approached Luo Zheng. Smiling faintly, she extended her slender index finger and caressed Zheng's face. "I won't tell you my name. If you want to know who I am, go find out for yourself..."</p>

  <p>She wiggled her finger at Luo Zheng, and with her thin eyebrows raised slightly, she turned around and walked towards the dungeon's exit. Just a bit earlier, Luo Zheng had forced his way to the second floor by clearing large clumps of moss. But the mosses grew too quickly in such a short time that they had already blocked the exit again.</p>

  <p>When the woman walked towards the clumps of moss, the mosses seemed to be afraid to have contact with her. They scattered all over the area to get out of her way. The mosses on the places on which her feet stepped instantly split to the sides as if they were extremely fearful of touching her. Effortlessly, this woman walked out of this place.</p>

  <p>As for Luo Zheng, he was left standing there in a daze. He only needed to reach her memories with his mind to know her name, but he forcefully refrained from doing so. He felt that it was some sort of a trap for him if he searched her soul. Although it was very tempting, he didn't want to risk it.</p>

  <p>After the woman in blue left, the moss grew again, layers upon layers, and covered the entire passageway to the exit. As he looked at the constantly wriggling moss, Luo Zheng frowned. He could only circulate the strength source within his inner world and use it to forcefully squeeze his way through the thick moss to get out of this place...</p>

  <p>As soon as Luo Zheng made his way out of the dungeon, he heard the sound of a dog barking from outside. Wayne was apparently teasing Blackie from a distance. Bound by the Fairy Chain, Blackie could only bark crazily at Wayne but could not fight back at him. Blackie's barks were able to suppress Zheng's soul greatly, but they had no effect on Wayne.</p>

  <p>When the woman in blue appeared in front of Wayne, it was as if he had seen something extremely terrifying. His sausage-like lips couldn't help but twitch uncontrollably, but they had stopped moving immediately after a moment.</p>

  <p>Blackie also whimpered fearfully and rushed back into the dog house, lying motionlessly on the ground.</p>

  <p>Such a usually ferocious dog was actually looking at the blue-garbed girl with pitiful eyes...</p>

  <p>Both Master Evil and Blayd looked nervous. They didn't expect that Luo Zheng would dare to release this woman.</p>

  <p>"Why are you looking at me like that?" The blue-clothed woman swept her gaze over all of them, and a mysterious smile appeared on her face.</p>

  <p>Her smile was so mesmerizing that Luo Zheng wondered what these people were so afraid of�</p>

  <p>"You, you, please don't kill us!" Master Evil, who had always had a vicious look on his face, pointed at the blue-robed woman. It was an unusual sight to see such a frightened expression on his face.</p>

  <p>The blue-clothed woman chuckled. "We are all on the same boat now.</p>

  <p>There is no need to kill you. But I'm not sure that I will not kill you in the future if we meet again. Right now, I think we should talk about... how to help this young man."</p>

  <p>As they got down to discuss the matter at hand, Zheng's gaze wavered slightly. "Two people. I only need two people to fight with me."</p>

  <p>"Can't we all go together?" Blayd asked immediately.</p>

  <p>"I agree. If all of us go, we could quickly tear them apart and finish the job as soon as possible," Wayne echoed.</p>

  <p>They thought that if the blue-clothed woman stayed in the fairy palace, the others who hadn't been chosen by Luo Zheng would probably be in great trouble. If the four of them went with Luo Zheng, at least this blue-clothed woman wouldn't be able to act rashly. It seemed that their fear of her had already reached its peak.</p>

  <p>"No," Luo Zheng shook his head. "I need you to fight in the universe. The enemy only has three True Gods on their side, and we can only have three on ours. This is a rule."</p>

  <p>"Universe?"</p>

  <p>"Are you talking about an inner world built by a Holy Being?"</p>

  <p>"Isn't there only one True God allowed to stay in a universe?"</p>

  <p>"Who did Murphy wage a war against?"</p>

  <p>The four of them all had surprised looks on their faces. They were imprisoned in the fairy palace so they were sure that this was the Swirl Forest. They didn't expect that Luo Zheng would take them to the universe to fight.</p>

  <p>Before this, they already knew that they would be fighting against warriors who were Murphy's disciples. Since they were going to fight in some universe, Murphy must have launched a new war against another Holy Being...</p>

  <p>"Does the person that Murphy waged a war against have the surname Luo?" a devious smile appeared on the woman's face as she asked.</p>

  <p>With this remark, the few True Gods instantly found the answer.</p>
