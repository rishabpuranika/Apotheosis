  <p>
</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng saw the huge shadow of the bird, he was stunned for a brief moment, but then a look of ecstasy soon appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>"The Three-eyed Dragon Sparrow!"</p>

  <p>It was the highest level treasure of the Star Falcon race. Luo Zheng clearly remembered giving this Other Shore Token to Feng Ge before.</p>

  <p>Concubine Yan continued to grieve as she sat on the ground. A puzzled look was visible on her face as she witnessed the sudden appearance of the huge bird.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Hancock also looked surprised. 'Where did it come from? Am I the one who attracted it?' he thought.</p>

  <p>They knew that it wasn't just any ordinary sparrow. Its aura was extremely strong, which definitely meant that it wasn't an ordinary Other Shore creature.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Before Hancock could react, the Three-eyed Dragon Sparrow already flew towards him and tried to peck his head.</p>

  <p>The sparrow flew back and forth and attacked without ceasing.</p>

  <p>In its first few attacks, Hancock was easily protected by the Chaotic Source Spirits. However, with the sparrow's last peck, the Chaotic Source Spirits were finally exhausted. The sparrow's long beak was able to break through and inflict a deep gash on his chest, which eventually bled profusely.</p>

  <p>The Three-eyed Dragon Sparrow was such a savage creature that it treated Hancock like an earthworm. It was pretty determined to strike him until he became its meal.</p>

  <p>However, Hancock was a pretty strong warrior who had reached Stage Thirty-two. There was no way that he would just stand by and become the sparrow's snack.</p>

  <p>After he came to his senses, his face was quickly filled with anger as he readied for a counterattack. When he drew close enough, he used his blood-red dagger to slash the neck of the Three-eyed Dragon Sparrow.</p>

  <p>Shing! Shing! Shing!</p>

  <p>Though his dagger was very sharp, the defenses of the huge sparrow were not to be underestimated. Ultimately, the dagger only left a few scratches on the sparrow's body.</p>

  <p>"What the hell? Why can't I kill it?" Hancock was so annoyed that the sparrow was giving him a hard time.</p>

  <p>He then changed his approach and attacked it with his fist.</p>

  <p>Crash!</p>

  <p>The Three-eyed Dragon Sparrow was knocked back by the impact of Hancock's massive punch.</p>

  <p>The sparrow was a sixth-grade Other Shore Token from Stage Fourteen, but it didn't contain an endless amount of power like the Civilization Artifact.</p>

  <p>As the top treasure of the Star Falcon race, it could easily deal with ordinary Chaotic Source Realm warriors. Unfortunately, its prowess would fall short in the face of an elite warrior like Hancock.</p>

  <p>After the Three-eyed Dragon Sparrow directly took Hancock's fist, it became more agitated. It suddenly flapped its wings so hard and aggressively flew towards him, intending to swallow him whole.</p>

  <p>Hancock was able to dodge the attack and countered it by letting out a few heavy punches. Once again, the huge sparrow was forced to fly back.</p>

  <p>Concubine Yan's face grew paler by the moment. She didn't dare to look at her daughter's face.</p>

  <p>She was frustrated with the fact that the sparrow appeared after her daughter was already dead. If it was trying to protect her, it should have done sooner.</p>

  <p>While thinking about this, Concubine Yan wasn't able to hold back her tears and began to sob.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stared at the movements of the giant sparrow, and a plan started brewing in his head.</p>

  <p>The Three-eyed Dragon Sparrow could bring Feng Ge back to life.</p>

  <p>There weren't many Other Shore Tokens that possessed such incredible abilities.</p>

  <p>But in order to do that, the Three-eyed Dragon Sparrow had to kill the person who had killed Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>The only problem was that the sparrow alone wouldn't be able to bring down Hancock. In fact, it was already being beaten slowly.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing the sobbing voice of Concubine Yan, Luo Zheng spoke in a soft voice,</p>

  <p>"Lady Concubine Yan, take good care of Eastern Emperor Taiyi. It's not yet too late. We can still bring Feng Ge back."</p>

  <p>Concubine Yan was so surprised when she heard Luo Zheng's words. She would not abandon any shred of hope if there was a chance that they could bring her daughter back to life.</p>

  <p>Immediately, Luo Zheng dropped to the ground on all fours. Then, the structure of his body began to change.</p>

  <p>Sclerites stood up all over his body except the ones on his head. In just a matter of seconds, Luo Zheng's appearance didn't look human any more.</p>

  <p>As the sclerites continued to roll up, a tail formed and appeared behind him.</p>

  <p>Concubine Yan was stunned. She began to have doubts if Luo Zheng was actually a human. 'Was he just disguising himself this whole time? Did the Taiyi Heaven Palace know about this?'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't care about Concubine Yan's thoughts at the moment. He needed to do what he could to save Feng Ge. After activating the blood of the Chaos Ancient God, he crawled on the ground like a beast, and focused his eyes on Hancock.</p>

  <p>The Three-eyed Dragon Sparrow was somewhat similar to the Corpse Weaver of Master Hai. Both of them were used to avenge the dead, but the Corpse Weaver was definitely more powerful as the corpses couldn't be killed at all. Even a powerful warrior like Emperor Di Jun wouldn't be able to destroy them.</p>

  <p>In terms of endurance, the Three-eyed Dragon Sparrow was also inferior.</p>

  <p>After being bombarded by Hancock's attacks for quite a few times, it showed a trace of fatigue, and its power also decreased.</p>

  <p>"I'll smash you to pieces, you damned bird!"</p>

  <p>Crash! Crash! Crash!</p>

  <p>Hancock's fists were soon stained by the blood of the sparrow.</p>

  <p>The weakened sparrow wasn't able to dodge most of his attacks, so it started retreating.</p>

  <p>It lost its earlier aggressiveness and became the one who was on the defensive.</p>

  <p>Not long after, many cracks appeared on the surface of the Three-eyed Dragon Sparrow. This was a sign that it was about to collapse.</p>

  <p>Hancock was about to deliver his final blow. He put his hands together and an ominous red light began to shine brightly.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to finish you off! Go to hell!'</p>

  <p>Just when Hancock was about to attack, Luo Zheng pushed his hands and feet so hard to the ground. Using them as a spring, he bounced off the ground and appeared beside Hancock in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>If Hancock was an ordinary warrior, he wouldn't have enough time to react and dodge Luo Zheng's sudden attack.</p>

  <p>However, Hancock's strength was even comparable to that of Qiu Yinhe and Goran. He reacted so quickly and even managed to maneuver for a counterattack.</p>

  <p>"Are you kidding? You think you could pull off a sneak attack on me? I don't think so!"</p>

  <p>The moment Hancock felt the space fluctuation near him, he retracted back and tried to punch Luo Zheng's chest as hard as he could.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was also able to react quickly. He withdrew his hands to cover his chest with his arms.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>He took a direct hit from Hancock and was sent flying backward.</p>

  <p>When the power of tens of thousands of Jun smashed into his body, Luo Zheng felt his blood surge up that he almost suffocated.</p>

  <p>However, as he flew backward, a smile appeared at the corners of his lips.</p>

  <p>Noticing the weird smile on Luo Zheng's face, Hancock couldn't help but wonder inwardly, 'Is this guy insane? How could he still smile when he is getting a beating? Even if he isn't killed by that strike, I'm sure that he will be at least half-dead.'</p>

  <p>However, there was one thing that Hancock didn't put into consideration.</p>

  <p>He ignored the change in the structure of Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng executed his sneak attack earlier, he quickly placed his tail at Hancock's nape. Before he was blasted off by Hancock, Luo Zheng's tail managed to pierce through his nape.</p>

  <p>Much earlier, the Three-eyed Dragon Sparrow was able to exhaust all of Hancock's Chaotic Source Spirits due to its ceaseless attacks. Therefore, without the safeguarding of the spirits, Luo Zheng was able to penetrate the back of Hancock's neck.</p>

  <p>It was too late when Hancock noticed what Luo Zheng did.</p>

  <p>Immediately after, Hancock's body trembled and his vision became blurry.</p>

  <p>He reached the back of his neck with his wobbly hand and felt a trace of a tiny bloodstain. He looked at Luo Zheng in disbelief as his body continued to lose balance.</p>

  <p>"What poison did you? " Before he could finish his sentence, his body dropped to the ground with a flop.</p>

  <p>The same moment that he fell, the Three-eyed Dragon Sparrow hurriedly swooped down and swallowed him whole. It spread its wings and flew towards Feng Ge.</p>
