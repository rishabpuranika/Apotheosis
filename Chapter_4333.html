  <p>
</p>

  <p>Fuxi, Tianming, Hilario, and the others looked at each other.</p>

  <p>It was hard for them to believe that they were still alive.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess' eyes were full of doubt. She looked into the distance and said with a trembling voice, "Has the Wall World disappeared? No, have all the things in the world disappeared?"</p>

  <p>The space outside the Immortal Mansion was empty. There was nothing left.</p>

  <p>This was not normal. They didn't even think this was possible.</p>

  <p>When downgrading happened, it would destroy everything in the physical realm, but its energy and materials would remain. They would not even be lost in the slightest.</p>

  <p>But now, even the Wall World had disappeared.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess looked around and asked, "Where is Luo Zheng? Is Luo Zheng missing?"</p>

  <p>When the others heard her say this, they all quickly began to search for Luo Zheng. He, however, was nowhere to be found.</p>

  <p>"Wait, is this Luo Zheng's token?"</p>

  <p>"Did he save the Immortal Mansion?"</p>

  <p>"But how could he have done it? That's almost impossible. How could he have stopped the downgrading?"</p>

  <p>"?"</p>

  <p>They all made their guesses on how Luo Zheng disappeared or where Luo Zheng had gone, but at the end of the day, they were dumbfounded. They had no true clue where he was.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>While everyone continued to search for him or speculate on his disappearance, his figure began to condense in the Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>"Dad!"</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>"What happened?"</p>

  <p>"Did you stop the downgrading?"</p>

  <p>Luo Nian, Tianming, the Snake Goddess, Mike, and the others ran to him immediately. They had never heard of or encountered a situation like this before. What was happening was truly incomprehensible to them.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked at them with a trace of warmth flowing from the bottom of his heart. "No, I didn't stop the downgrading. The downgrading has been completed."</p>

  <p>"The downgrading has been completed?" Luo Nian looked puzzled. "But how could it have been completed? We're not dead..."</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess raised her eyebrows and said, "Luo Zheng, have we died already? Have we just managed to come back to life again?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng gave the Snake Goddess a thumbs up. "You're right," he said.</p>

  <p>"Are we in the underworld?" Luo Nian asked, his eyes wide open in shock.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng reached his hand out and gently stroked Luo Nian's body. When he did this, Luo Nian's tall body shrank back to its normal size. He rubbed Luo Nian's head and smiled. "Son, there is no underworld in this world.</p>

  <p>This is a brand new world. I recreated you all with the help of Clarence's memories."</p>

  <p>Luo Nian blinked his eyes in disbelief. He quickly looked down at his body. "I was created with memories. Does that mean I'm fake? Am I not the real Luo Nian anymore, Dad?"</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha..." Luo Zheng laughed, amused by his son's words. The others, however, didn't laugh with him. The truth was they also had the same worry in their hearts. To be fair, Luo Zheng also had this worry in him before. He was also afraid he was just in an illusory world.</p>

  <p>"Everyone, don't worry," Luo Zheng sighed, trying to comfort them. He began to explain it in detail, "When the energy is arranged according to the original pattern, the substance it forms is the same as the past one. This is an absolute reality. If ice melted but condensed back again into ice, wouldn't it still be the ice it was before?"</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess was the first to understand. "Do you mean to say that we did die, but since you have all the memories of the whole world, you were able to restore us using those memories?"</p>

  <p>"Yes!" Luo Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>"But why is it that you could only restore the Immortal Mansion?" the Snake Goddess asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, that's not true. I can restore everything to its original state with the help of the memories, and I'll do it soon,"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng assured them. With a gentle wave of his hand, the black ship, which was not far from the Immortal Mansion, was restored.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven, Shera, the former captain, and Edna were also reborn with it.</p>

  <p>"We... We're alive?"</p>

  <p>"Why? How?"</p>

  <p>"Where is the Evil God?"</p>

  <p>The four people on the black ship were also confused. They were all safe, but they were still a bit worried. The Evil God was nowhere to be found.</p>

  <p>They saw Luo Zheng, but no one dared to ask him.</p>

  <p>Edna, however, summoned up all her courage and flew out. At the entrance of the Immortal Mansion, she timidly asked Luo Zheng, "Creator, where is the Evil God?"</p>

  <p>"The Evil God?" Luo Zheng replied, an undetectable expression on his face.</p>

  <p>"He's dead."</p>

  <p>"What?</p>

  <p>The Evil God's dead?" She tried to clarify. Luo Zheng nodded his head. Her mouth was hung open, and a trace of sadness appeared in her eyes. She spoke to Luo Zheng once again, "But why... Why aren't we dead?"</p>

  <p>"I created you," answered Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>It was difficult for others to understand Luo Zheng's creation of realities, but since Edna was born in his inner world, she was well aware of his omnipotent ability. She thought it was normal for him to directly create her.</p>

  <p>When she heard this, her eyes lit up with hope. "If you created me and the others, can you create the Evil God?"</p>

  <p>"No," Luo Zheng said, shutting down Edna's hope immediately.</p>

  <p>The Evil God had already comprehended infinite energy. If Luo Zheng were to create him, it would bring about endless trouble. Who knew what the Evil God would do? It would be too difficult to deal with him, especially considering he was just as strong as Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng refused her request, Edna's eyelids trembled slightly. She did her best not to cry. Pursing her lips, she nodded and said, "I see. Thank you, Creator."</p>

  <p>She turned around, ready to return to the black ship.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng thought he would be definite with his decision, but when he looked at Edna, an inexplicable emotion rose in his heart. It felt like a mixture of depression and desperation. It was as if something from within him was begging him to change his mind.</p>

  <p>However, even though the emotion came from him, he was not sure if it belonged to him. When the Evil God's consciousness fused with his, their emotions also mixed. The Evil God's emotions could affect Luo Zheng's.</p>

  <p>The Evil God was begging him to bring him back to life.</p>

  <p>Or was he begging himself?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shook his head in disagreement but then began to give in. He called out to Edna, smiling bitterly. "Wait," he said.</p>

  <p>Edna turned around and stared at Luo Zheng in a daze.</p>

  <p>"I will create the Evil God, but not for now," said Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>It wasn't difficult to erase part of the memories of the Evil God and completely restrict him, but Luo Zheng decided to deal with this in the future.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Edna flew into the air and kowtowed three times towards Luo Zheng to show her happiness and thankfulness. She then returned to the black ship.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng gently waved his hand, signaling to the black ship that he was allowing them to follow the Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>When the Immortal Mansion and the black ship passed somewhere, the energy hidden in the void would begin to fluctuate.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng restored the Deep Space's golden ring-shaped sun. Broken tiles floating in the air, huge broken buildings, and the Sky Wheel City were also restored.</p>

  <p>When the Immortal Mansion went down, the huge strata floating in the void had also been restored. The different races living in the Deep Space had also been reborn.</p>

  <p>These uncivilized races were not aware of when they died or when they had been reborn. They didn't even know about the downgrading that happened. Their peaceful lives had not been broken.</p>

  <p>Among them, the only one who knew about what had happened was Elder Xue.</p>

  <p>He calmly waited for his death in the Elemental race's territory and then he was reborn. He was very puzzled by what happened. When he saw the Immortal Mansion coming, he became even more confused. Luo Zheng greeted him with a smile before inviting him to hop on board.</p>

  <p>"Why? And what happened?" Elder Xue wanted an answer.</p>

  <p>"Hilario will give you an answer," Luo Zheng replied shortly.</p>

  <p>There were still many people and places Luo Zheng had to restore. He didn't have the time to explain the situation again and again.</p>

  <p>After restoring the Deep Space, he took the Immortal Mansion and the black ship back to the fourth-grade world.</p>

  <p>In the empty world, the earth, mountains, rivers, the four pillars, the Eternal Divine Courtyard, and the broken secondary worlds were all restored.</p>

  <p>Not long after, the Immortal Mansion and the black ship arrived at the entrance of the chaos. The Human Spirit King Kincaid died there, so he would also be reborn here.</p>

  <p>Kincaid's memory stopped the moment he rushed out of the chaos. When he revived, he had an unreadable expression on his face. He did not know how to react. Like before, Luo Zheng asked Hilario to explain to him what had happened. After that, he drove the Immortal Mansion into the chaos.</p>
