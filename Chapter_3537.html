<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>One could compare the Dark Region to a huge, black beast that spanned the eastern region of Stage Fourteen.</p>

  <p>The area Luo Zheng saw was part of the Dark Region's far end, closest to the Myriad Spirits City.</p>

  <p>Hans had no intention of perishing together with Luo Zheng. He was the mighty leader of the Star Falcon race! He had a lot to live for.</p>

  <p>However, it seemed that death was the only way to go after he discovered Luo Zheng's true power.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>There was a sharp sound as the wings outside the ball flapped and carried Luo Zheng towards the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>"Chief!" one of his followers called out. "There's no need to perish with this human man!"</p>

  <p>"Chief, please! There must be another way!"</p>

  <p>The other Star Falcons continued to plead as they followed behind their leader.</p>

  <p>Only an hour had passed since their attack on the Myriad Spirits City but in that short time period, all elite members of their race had been eliminated.</p>

  <p>Garth, so mighty and strong, also died in Luo Zheng's hands. The only solution Hans could think of in order to subdue Luo Zheng was to bring him into the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>The Star Falcons could only grovel at his feet to persuade him not to go.</p>

  <p>"Get out of the way!" Hans roared, his patience worn thin by his insistent followers.</p>

  <p>He had already made his decision and there was no way he was going to change his mind.</p>

  <p>His roar sent his followers scampering away. There was no stopping their leader anymore. All they could do was stay out of his way and let him head into the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng was struggling within the ball.</p>

  <p>The power released by the Star Stasis was strange. It was a type of sealing power that froze Luo Zheng's entire body.</p>

  <p>He looked on as the ball took him closer to the Dark Region, his expression growing grimmer by the second.</p>

  <p>In between the Heavenly Dark Mountain and the Earthy Dark Mountain was a low mountain ridge.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge rushed to the foot of the ridge and released her full strength, shooting forward like an arrow.</p>

  <p>The force she exerted was enough to shake the earth.</p>

  <p>Clyde and Raul trailing behind her could only look on in shock as cracks appeared on the ground Feng Ge walked on.</p>

  <p>Over time, Feng Ge's speed decreased and she fell on a slope at the side of the mountain.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>A huge crack like a spider web appeared where she stood before she was suddenly off again!</p>

  <p>Feng Ge stopped for two or three times more to get a break. Pretty soon, she saw the Star Falcons and Hans rushing towards the Dark Region at breakneck speed.</p>

  <p>A trace of horror appeared in her eyes. "No..."</p>

  <p>There was no way she could allow Luo Zheng to be brought into the Dark Region like this!</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Clyde and Raul, who had been closely following her this whole time, were shell-shocked at what they saw.</p>

  <p>"He's doomed." Raul muttered hopelessly.</p>

  <p>Clyde shook his head. "The Star Stasis is said to be able to stop the flow of all energy. There's no way he'll be able to resist it."</p>

  <p>Falling into the Dark Region had a multitude of consequences. No matter how strong Luo Zheng was, death was inescapable.</p>

  <p>However, Clyde had a plan.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's death wasn't going to be that big of a deal if Feng Ge was still alive.</p>

  <p>Her strength wasn't any weaker than Luo Zheng's, or that was what Clyde thought since she was undefeatable in Stage Fourteen.</p>

  <p>While the two paused to think about their current situation, Feng Ge began to release a soft aura.</p>

  <p>As she did so, her pupils rolled up so that the only thing visible were the whites of her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Princess Feng Ge..." Raul called out in shock by her appearance.</p>

  <p>Clyde was the same and could only helplessly call out for her, "Princess Feng Ge?"</p>

  <p>She seemed to have lost her consciousness but her body thrummed with power. Feng Ge's hands were raised in front of her with wisps of white light emanating between her fingers.</p>

  <p>Light wasn't something that could be easily controlled.</p>

  <p>Most, if not all, usually scattered and formed a simple line.</p>

  <p>However, the one Feng Ge released was forming several unique shapes.</p>

  <p>"What are those?" Raul asked.</p>

  <p>The sight of these blazing white lights made Clyde's eyes twitch.</p>

  <p>As the leader of the Guide Weasel race, he was privy to the legends that circulated about the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>It was said that purified beings could create lights that had the ability to eliminate all creatures of the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>Could it be as the legends said? Was Feng Ge a purified being?</p>

  <p>There was no way!</p>

  <p>She was from a world outside the Other Shore. There was no way she could be a purified being.</p>

  <p>However, the more Clyde thought about it, the more confused he became. If Feng Ge wasn't a purified being, then what other explanation would be reasonable?</p>

  <p>The moment Feng Ge crossed her hands, the light in her eyes suddenly went out, revealing her pupils once again. Her face was pale with fatigue and she promptly passed out on the ground.</p>

  <p>Just as she fell, Raul reached out and caught her in his huge palm. "Princess Feng Ge!" he cried out, trying to shake her awake. "Oh, my God..." Clyde murmured in disbelief.</p>

  <p>"What the heck happened?" Raul asked with a helpless expression.</p>

  <p>Darkness covered the whole Dark Region.</p>

  <p>However, at that moment, a huge crack suddenly appeared in the sky above the edge of the Dark Region. It emitted a blazing white light that blinded anyone who dared look at it.</p>

  <p>The Star Falcons could do nothing but watch as their leader was swallowed in the darkness and disappeared from view.</p>

  <p>As soon as Hans entered the Dark Region, the energy within it began to erode his corporeal body.</p>

  <p>His hair, his flesh, and even his bones cracked instantly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, who was wrapped in the Star Stasis, was able to resist.</p>

  <p>However, as creatures of the Light Region, it was only a matter of time before they got completely devoured by the darkness.</p>

  <p>Just when Hans thought he had achieved his goal, a crack suddenly appeared in the sky and bright light flooded the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>This bright light completely won over the darkness and illuminated an area with a radius of a hundred miles.</p>

  <p>"What the heck?!"</p>

  <p>Hans exclaimed in disbelief.</p>

  <p>They were in the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>Where in the world did this light come from?</p>

  <p>There was no way that was possible. Hans racked his brains but couldn't figure out an explanation.</p>

  <p>The creatures of the Dark Region were the ones that bore the brunt of this light's sudden appearance. The moment it touched them, they all burned to ashes and died.</p>

  <p>It was in this way that the dark demon plants, which stood ten thousand feet high, and the five-color earthly dragons perished.</p>
