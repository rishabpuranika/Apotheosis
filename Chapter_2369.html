  <p>
</p>

  <p>Once Walton and the other consummate True Gods had fixed the snake head at a place, Nelly was the first one to climb up.</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, as soon as she pulled herself up, she found that her sister's life was on a line. Her sister was going to die! All she could do was to pounce on Luo Zheng and plead for mercy.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stood motionlessly on the snake's back, and his emotion didn't waver at all either.</p>

  <p>'This woman has tried to kill me several times. I have no reason to spare her life!' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>However, as Luo Zheng watched Nelly run up to him like this, he hesitated for a moment.</p>

  <p>He hesitated a moment too long.</p>

  <p>Holding the short sword's hilt, Rachelle took a turn in the air with her flexible body. She somersaulted high above and a blood red long whip zipped toward Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, Luo Zheng was pulled forcefully downward by the long whip.</p>

  <p>"Ah!"</p>

  <p>Nelly screamed. With her subconscious, she dragged Luo Zheng using all her power.</p>

  <p>As the two of them slid downward, Rachelle took the opportunity to pull herself up toward the snake's back.</p>

  <p>As Rachelle Mu and Nelly Mu passed by each other, their sisterly eyes met and clashed together.</p>

  <p>Terror and astonishment were written all over Nelly's face, but Rachelle on the other hand, was extremely calm.</p>

  <p>While Rachelle stood firmly on the snake's back, the blood red whip in her hand rolled down once more. The end of the whip moved at extremely high speeds and before either of them could react, the whip wrapped itself around Nelly's arm. Because Nelly was clinging to Luo Zheng, the whip hung them both in the air.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng glanced at the black insects crawling on the light rays below him with a gloomy expression.</p>

  <p>"Nelly, let him go!" Rachelle said calmly, yet firmly.</p>

  <p>Resting her hands tightly on Luo Zheng's chest, Nelly shook her head and said stubbornly, "No!"</p>

  <p>"Then I'm afraid you're leaving me with no choice but to kill you along with him," said Rachelle threateningly.</p>

  <p>This young sister was used to obeying. Now though, she had been disobedient time and time again, which riled Rachelle.</p>

  <p>Despite her boiling rage, in her heart, she loved her younger sister very much. The words she spoke were really just to threaten Nelly. She would never bury her sister alongside Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Nelly's big round eyes blinked a few times and she lowered her head to look at Luo Zheng, her heart pounding with regret.</p>

  <p>All this time, she had hoped that she'd simply solve the underlying conflict between her sister and Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Although she also knew that her actions were very naive, she had to do what she was determined to do. In the end, she was just like Rachelle.</p>

  <p>One could imagine how guilty she felt when she found that she hadn't resolved the conflict at all, but had instead caused Luo Zheng a life and death type of problem.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, a free and careless smile appeared on her face. Nelly then said to Rachelle, "Alright."</p>

  <p>She wiggled her right arm slightly and pulled it out from Rachelle's whip.</p>

  <p>"Nelly! No!" Rachelle's expression changed dramatically. She raised the whip again, but it was already too late.</p>

  <p>"Wait! What the fuck is going on!?"</p>

  <p>Right now, it was Luo Zheng's turn to feel depressed. He'd imagined that she'd at least try her best to persuade her sister. How could she just let go and give up like that?</p>

  <p>From his current point of view, Luo Zheng could no longer use the force of Space-striking Ring to send himself back on the snake's back. More so, the two of them had just fallen toward the light rays below.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng noticed that they had less than a few seconds before he and Nelly fell directly into the light. His eyes flashed and his last Space-striking Ring was activated.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The Space-striking Ring turned into a huge silver sword and directed itself into a light ray. It became a silver white light and shot into the depths.</p>

  <p>At that very moment, Luo Zheng and Nelly also fell right into that light ray.</p>

  <p>Their bodies were pulled long by the power of time, turning into thin and long lines that rushed immediately downward along with the silver light.</p>

  <p>Dealing with the creepy, black insects was the most troublesome thing.</p>

  <p>More importantly, they were very life threatening.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng's Space-striking Ring was also very powerful. The one shot by Luo Zheng earlier turned into a silver light bar in the path and crushed the nasty black insects directly. Now that Luo Zheng and Nelly were following behind the light, they were led to believe that the insects in front of them would equally be crushed along the way.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the two of them flew toward the depths of the cave. They moved incredibly fast.</p>

  <p>Rachelle stared at the scene, feeling completely numb.</p>

  <p>Clap! Another sound rang through the air.</p>

  <p>She didn't seem to notice that the long whip she was holding in her hand had fallen to the ground.</p>

  <p>The consummate True Gods all rushed over to her.</p>

  <p>At first, Shahn wanted to scold Rachelle. But when he saw the scene up close, he moved his lips without actually saying anything. He was stunned.</p>

  <p>Walton and the others just shook their heads in dismay. They knew well about Rachelle's temperament. She was just too stubborn and didn't know how to change - or when to give up.</p>

  <p>In fact, they all knew that even if they had let Luo Zheng go, there was no way he'd ever survive outside the Time Sea Forbidden Land. Not even for a day. Now that Luo Zheng was eliminated, even Rachelle's sister was involved.</p>

  <p>This business had resulted in big loss.</p>

  <p>"Maybe they won't die," Rachelle said, slowly regaining her spirits.</p>

  <p>"That guy is very cunning. At the very last minute, he threw out a Space-striking Ring. With a Space-striking Ring to break through the path, those insects will also be crushed."</p>

  <p>"Maybe," said Walton, pointing to the front, where several consummate True Gods were running away along the snake's back.</p>

  <p>After they had successfully fixated the Heavenly Wheel Snake's head, its body continued wriggling, but it was no longer a threat to anyone.</p>

  <p>Looking at the consummate True Gods rushing to the front, Rachelle snorted and pulled the chain severed by Luo Zheng out of the snake's body.</p>

  <p>Then, she also ran toward the depths of the cave.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Luo Zheng and Nelly shuttled back and forth in the light, faster than ever before.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng and Nelly couldn't move within the light, they could see the surrounding scene as well as countless black insects inhabiting the other light rays. Fortunately, these black insects were not in the same light ray as they were. Even when the insects noticed Nelly and Luo Zheng, they didn't bother crawling over in order to chase them. They stayed in their own light.</p>

  <p>'I can only hope that the silver light from this Space-striking Ring won't disappear too soon, ' Luo Zheng thought to himself.</p>

  <p>The Space-striking Ring was only a one-time magic weapon. If the silver light dissipated after moving forward for a period of time, he and Nelly would probably have to face the black insects. If that were the case, chances were, they'd be swallowed up whole.</p>

  <p>However, back in the desert, Luo Zheng had also activated another Space-striking Ring, and the power that it exuded out gave him an extra boost of confidence.</p>

  <p>The silver light, which was transferred from the Space-striking Ring, explored in front of them and crushed the black insects. After a short while, Luo Zheng heard a loud bang.</p>

  <p>The silver light turned into a huge silver sword, and it collided into the opposite wall with a loud explosion.</p>

  <p>It wasn't before long that Luo Zheng felt his body become lighter and his originally stretched form began to shrink and recover quickly. He was delighted that they had made it out in such a short period of time.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>And that was when Luo Zheng bumped directly into a very solid wall. His body slammed straight on to it.</p>

  <p>"Ah!"</p>

  <p>With a shriek, Nelly was next out of the light and she slammed into Luo Zheng's chest.</p>

  <p>She straightened her hair and stepped back with a blushing face, as quickly as she possibly could. She whispered, "I'm so sorry. I didn't expect that my sister would..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng waved his hand, in a nonchalant manner. He didn't care about what had just happened, not in the least. He then glanced to his side, his eyebrows twitching nervously.</p>

  <p>He guessed that they must be at the very end of the Heavenly Wheel Temple. A huge bronze wall stood at the end and a few very unique lines were drawn on it. Furthermore, right smack in the middle of all the gathered lines was a small jade seal, emitting a faint light.</p>
