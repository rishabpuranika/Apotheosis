  <p>
</p>

  <p>It was as if the cloudy sky had cleared when everyone became in the mood to study the Divine Time Temple after Reginald was safely brought inside it.</p>

  <p>True to its name, the Divine Time Temple was an incredibly magnificent structure. A strange statue stood in the center of the broad hall. Its monstrous and thorny body looked like a huge bug, but it had a round mouth and rows of sharp teeth with spikes. It looked absolutely ferocious.</p>

  <p>"What kind of monster is this?" Zheng asked curiously. He couldn't think of a reason such a strange and ugly statue stood in the otherwise majestic Divine Time Temple.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, everything in the forbidden area was created by the Faith Energy, the Divine Time Temple included. Thus, the monster in front of them must be something that existed in legends.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, disgust washed over Aleyna's face as she stared at the strange statue. She shook her head. Although she knew something about the Sun Blind race, this was the first time she had entered the Time Sea Forbidden Land. Naturally, she was quite unfamiliar with the forbidden area they were in.</p>

  <p>A smile spread on Reginald's face when he heard Zheng's query. "This is the Time Source Bug. It's said that the passage of time in our world is the way it is now because these bugs devoured the past," he said with a smile.</p>

  <p>"If these bugs devoured the past, does it mean the past doesn't exist anymore?" Zheng asked again. According to what Aleyna had explained, only the leader of the Sun Blind race was qualified to go back to the past in this world, which meant that the past did exist.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, their leader could change the past to a certain extent. For instance, she could kill creatures in the past and it would affect the present.</p>

  <p>Yet, what Zheng had learned and Aleyna's explanation contradicted each other.</p>

  <p>In fact, he was confused at the beginning when Aleyna told him about that ability of the leader of the Sun Blind race.</p>

  <p>In theory, all clues about a Holy Being's past would disappear once the leader of the Sun Blind race returned to the past and killed him. Then, everything related to him would change. For example, his children would disappear, and his partner would not have met him, nor would he even establish the Floating Island, all of which would produce a series of far-reaching shadows in the future.</p>

  <p>Yet according to Aleyna's statements, only the Holy Being disappeared after he was killed. Everything else that he had left still remained, which in theory was not right.</p>

  <p>Anything related to time was too hard to understand, and even Aleyna couldn't explain it. She just told Zheng what she knew.</p>

  <p>"The Time Source Bugs devouring the past is just a legend. The real Time Source Bugs wouldn't devour all of the past. In fact, they live in time and they themselves are the guardians of time. The Time Source Bugs are quite powerful, and even the Holy Beings can't escape from them," Reginald said flatly.</p>

  <p>"Holy Beings will encounter these Time Source Bugs?" Zheng asked. He was even more confused now. He turned to Aleyna and asked again,</p>

  <p>"Didn't you say that the leader of Sun Blind race could go back to the past only because she had obtained the Time Sword of Gods? Since the Time Source Bugs survive within time, how would the Holy Beings encounter them?"</p>

  <p>Aleyna simply shrugged and could not answer his question. Although she had read books about the Time Sea Forbidden Land, she did not know all of its secrets.</p>

  <p>Reginald, however, shook his head and said. "Time cracks are everywhere in the Time Sea. Holy Beings have the ability to find relatively large cracks in it. They can use those time cracks to go back to the past."</p>

  <p>It was known that every wave in the Time Sea was peppered with infinite time cracks, but those time cracks were quite thin and impossible to cross.</p>

  <p>Yet in such a vast Time Sea, there would occasionally be a relatively large and complete time crack. Some of those time cracks were even over a hundred feet wide. Although those huge time cracks usually disappeared within seconds, it was still possible to go through them.</p>

  <p>"I think you must have mistaken the cause and effect," said Reginald.</p>

  <p>"The leader of Sun Blind race is able to return to the past unscathed because she has the sword. Even if the other Holy Beings enter the time cracks, they still wouldn't be able to go to the past because they cannot pass through the Time Guardians' block."</p>

  <p>"I see," Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>Although he still had some doubts and questions, he had sorted out some of them. It turned out that there was a race within time, and the matters that were involved in it were truly much more complicated than he had imagined.</p>

  <p>"Go ahead. This Divine Time Temple is something you can't miss. I've been here once and I learned so much," Reginald beamed.</p>

  <p>Many True Gods had already bypassed the huge statue of the Time Source Bug and entered the passageway in the middle of the hall. Pitch black arched doors flanked both sides of the corridor. The True Gods quickly entered the gates one after another without hesitation. At the same time, different rays of light glowed from within the doors.</p>

  <p>"I know that those are the Secret Time Rooms. It is said that anyone who enters one of them can break their bottleneck," Aleyna quipped.</p>

  <p>"Is it that amazing?" Zheng mumbled with raised brows. Meanwhile, Reginald leaned on to one side. "It is indeed that amazing.</p>

  <p>A Secret Time Room can show you any history of the divine land, and what happened during that specific period of time is what you need. Why don't you go in one of them and try? The Secret Time Room has only one effect on everyone, so I don't need to enter it again," he stated.</p>

  <p>Reginald was only a mid-rank True God when he had first entered the Divine Time Temple, and he had encountered the biggest challenge in his life.</p>

  <p>He had never been able to completely comprehend the Invincible Fighting Intent of the Fighting Godly Way. What actually happened when he entered the Secret Time Room was he had returned to the ancient battlefield and met the first ancient warrior who cultivated the Fighting Godly Way, and saw the warrior launched the Invincible Fighting Intent with his own eyes.</p>

  <p>After that, he left the Divine Time Temple and went back to the War God Hall. Seven days later, he had completely mastered the Invincible Fighting Intent, broken through the shackles of his cultivation, and become a top-rank True God.</p>

  <p>Zheng was even more surprised than he already had been when he heard that story. If it was true that the Secret Time Room would put one in a place where they needed to cultivate and gain more knowledge, then…</p>

  <p>A deep sigh escaped his lips. Such a miraculous place was beyond his comprehension once again. He couldn't guess how the place managed to do that.</p>

  <p>When he saw more and more True Gods enter those arched doors, he finally chose a door and walked in.</p>

  <p>'Where would this Secret Time Room take me?' he wondered.</p>

  <p>Once the others had entered their chosen doors, they seemed to quickly sink into a period of time. Zheng, however, did not have any reaction whatsoever for quite a while. He was still in complete darkness.</p>

  <p>After what seemed to be eons, he noticed that a wisp of dark brown aura slowly filled the dark space.</p>

  <p>"The chaotic energy?" he guessed.</p>

  <p>He was still in a confused daze and his face turned into a strange color.</p>

  <p>What was the meaning of that slowly rotating chaotic energy?</p>

  <p>Was it a piece of history of the divine land?</p>
