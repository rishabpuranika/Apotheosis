<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The power of the Ice Soul Flame was intense and terrifying. It originated from the Ice Law in the divine land and thus was considered a complete Law Power.</p>

  <p>The laws in the universes, however, heavily relied on the comprehension of the Holy Beings, which were often partial and incomplete.</p>

  <p>Zheng balled his hand into a fist and lightly squeezed, causing the ice flame to dissipate in seconds. A small smile crept onto his face. It would seem that the Holy Being's profound mysteries were reliable even during crucial moments.</p>

  <p>But a lingering question stayed in his mind. Just how strong was the ice flame? There was no way to test it, so he had no choice but to wait in front of the mirror.</p>

  <p>Minutes passed as he waited. Zheng was in deep thought before he took out the Gold Sun Fruit and swallowed it in one gulp.</p>

  <p>He was not certain about what the Ice Soul Flame meant or if it was just one of the many deep mysteries of the Ice Law. But after careful considerations, Zheng opted to keep the information to himself.</p>

  <p>If he did not swallow the Gold Sun Fruit, those people would definitely ask about it. He was not in the mood to make up another lie to satisfy their curiosity, so he might as well just swallow the fruit and get it over with.</p>

  <p>Not long after, Kaydan, Chapman, and Tilton finally passed through the cold flame field. After seeing Zheng standing in front of the mirror and sizing him up a bit, Kaydan frowned and asked, "Zheng, did you swallow the Gold Sun Fruit?"</p>

  <p>Zheng turned to him and nodded his head slightly.</p>

  <p>At his confirmation, disappointment flickered on their faces.</p>

  <p>There was no doubt that Zheng was the last person to pass through the cold flame field without the help of the Gold Sun Fruit. Before, when Zheng was running madly like a lunatic, the three of them failed to find any traces of him and thought he had died in the cold flame field.</p>

  <p>They did not expect Zheng to reach the end. Much to their disappointment, he had used the Gold Sun Fruit in the end.</p>

  <p>"When did you eat it?" Kaydan asked with a growing frown.</p>

  <p>Zheng let out a faint smile, saying, "When there were still five thousand miles to go. I couldn't bear it any longer. I think this was a failure."</p>

  <p>Kaydan drew a deep sigh. He was immensely disappointed but he was not sure if it was because he didn't get to see the secret unraveled or if it was because Zheng didn't persevere on his own to the end.</p>

  <p>Unlike Kaydan, Tilton was much calmer and accepting. He said, "That's understandable. It's not easy to endure for 145, 000 miles after all. At the very least, no one's ever traveled this far before. We've already managed a great feat."</p>

  <p>Aside from the martial artists at the Spirit Supreme Realm and Spirit Transformation Realm, there were also many world lords in the divine land who attempted to travel through the cold flame field; however, because of their limited cultivation, some people jumped to the conclusion that no one could pass through the cold flame field with just their own strength unless they were a True God.</p>

  <p>Usually and in normal circumstances, True Gods were not allowed to enter the universes.</p>

  <p>There were no Supreme Lords or True Gods in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. No one could ever travel across the ice flame field with just their own strength alone. It was simply impossible.</p>

  <p>Chapman laughed, his voice filling the air. "If we enter the interior world now, Zheng will be able to raise his cultivation to the Spirit Transformation Realm, and then he can go back and travel across the cold flame field again. There's still hope that he will make it!"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Kaydan agreed with a nod, a flash of glint passing through his eyes.</p>

  <p>It had to be said that when the six great races had been created, they were bestowed with formidable talents by the master of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. They had a nearly perfect body and a unique cultivation land. However, their master did not give them everything as he had deprived them of the right to explore!</p>

  <p>In a complete universe, countless creatures and races competed fiercely against each other to survive and obtain more and deeper knowledge.</p>

  <p>The six great races had no troubles surviving. As the natives of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, their status was naturally higher than the others. Even the martial artists from the divine land were inferior and couldn't hold a candle to their might. But despite their strength, the races never stopped pining for more knowledge.</p>

  <p>Had they been created only to serve the martial artists from the other races? After all, each race was being monitored by a prophet. But if this was the case, then what was the purpose of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land?</p>

  <p>To the wild beasts, these questions were useless and meaningless.</p>

  <p>However, to the intelligent life forms, the mystery and lack of answers were enough to drive them insane.</p>

  <p>Whether or not Zheng obtained the inheritance of this profound mystery of the Ice Law wasn't important. To them, resolving the doubts in their hearts was more important. It would naturally explain why Kaydan and the rest were much more enthusiastic than Zheng himself. . .</p>

  <p>After they had waited for a while, the rest of the team finally caught up.</p>

  <p>Even though they had eaten the Gold Sun Fruit, which had turned into a sun in their elixir field and continuously released heat, crossing the last 10, 000 miles would prove to be extremely challenging and difficult for them.</p>

  <p>In fact, during the last journey, three people succumbed to the ice and froze for eternity due to their weak strength. Two of them were from the other races while the last one was from the Skyland race.</p>

  <p>The stronger warriors looked slightly better, but the weaker warriors were turning pale and cyan from the extreme cold. The Ice Law in that quiet world could freeze the sun itself. It wouldn't be an exaggeration to call that a narrow escape.</p>

  <p>Despite this, venturing into the interior world now was everyone's decision. Whether it was the warriors of the other races or the people from the three major races, they all took careful steps and made their own mental preparations for this arduous journey.</p>

  <p>To the martial artists of the other races, the interior world was a trove of great lucky chances. If they followed these natives, there was a chance they could obtain unimaginable benefits. For the three major races, however, it was different. This was a desperate attempt.</p>

  <p>After everyone had arrived, Kaydan looked at the crowd and said in a booming voice, "This Mirror Lake is the entrance and exit of the interior world. Interior and exterior worlds are two completely different worlds, and inside the interior world, the danger level will increase by several folds. We three major races will do our best. But everybody, please be careful and follow our instructions. It is your own fault if you disobey us and end up losing your life in return."</p>

  <p>The people listened to him and nodded in silence, absorbing his words.</p>

  <p>After that, Kaydan unfurled his wings behind his back, raised his head, and walked toward the lake in careful, deliberate steps.</p>

  <p>In a split second, the layer of "mercury" covered his entire body until he was completely engulfed. Chapman, Tilton, and the rest soon followed and entered the Mirror Lake one after another.</p>

  <p>Finally, it was his turn. Without any hesitations, Zheng turned around and dove straight into the lake.</p>

  <p>At first, the layer of silver material in the lake looked similar to mercury, but after he entered and inspected it closely, Zheng realized it wasn't mercury but a type of Space Law instead.</p>

  <p>He didn't know what level this Holy Jay had reached during his training of the Space Law, but the power of the Space Law didn't dissipate and instead solidified into this silver liquid substance.</p>

  <p>The layer of this material was only 10 feet wide. After taking a few steps, Zheng emerged from the "mercury." As soon as he got out, he swept his gaze around and found himself in an even more bizarre world.</p>

  <p>The interior world of the Mirror Lake was yet another huge cave. To his surprise, however, the scenery of the cave was distorting and never the same. The faint yellow light pouring down from the ceiling drowned everything in the world with a layer of dusk.</p>

  <p>The mountains in the distance were quickly flashing and distorting, as if they were mere illusions, and it gave Zheng an extremely surreal feeling as if he were trapped in a dream.</p>

  <p>After everyone had entered, Kaydan hushed everyone into silence and then pointed a finger toward a row of black hills not far away.</p>

  <p>Because the environment kept on flashing in and out of existence, everyone's visions began to distort as well. They thought something was wrong with their eyes, so instead of focusing on the black hills, they rubbed their eyes and ran their gazes somewhere else.</p>

  <p>However, Kaydan and his group had come to the interior world many times before. They were used to this. When he pointed a finger at the row of black hills, all of the other martial artists paled at what they saw.</p>

  <p>To their shock, those black hills were actually Formless Sky Pythons that were currently in deep slumber.</p>

  <p>The world lords, the martial artists from the other races who were currently at Spirit Supreme Realm, or Spirit Transformation Realm, and even the people from the three major races couldn't help but gulp in nervousness. The pressure was so intense that no one dared to bat an eye or make a sound, fearful that they might alert the pythons of their presence.</p>

  <p>"Liusu. . ." Aleyna said in a quiet voice, her face turning as pale as a ghost.</p>

  <p>Although her voice was soft, the others threw sharp looks at her in frustration. Even Kaydan turned around and glared at her, his eyes blazing with fire and annoyance.</p>

  <p>Liusu quickly covered her sister's mouth with her palm, silencing her.</p>

  <p>There were rumors that there were only three Formless Sky Pythons in the entire Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, but it seemed there were more than a hundred of them in this interior world.</p>

  <p>In the past, when Liusu was aggressively chased by a Formless Sky Python, the Collapsing Mountain race had to dispatch three people from their Divinity Hunt Squad to chase it away. If they made a mistake and woke these giant Formless Sky Pythons up now, then it would definitely mean a sure disaster for all the warriors present.</p>
