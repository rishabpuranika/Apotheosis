<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>When Joy first met Mike, she was just a mid-rank True God. However, she was a key member and warrior of the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>The research on the Purple Mu Ning Godly Way wasn't as advanced then as it was now, and the creation of the Purple Sky Land was an uncertainty as it was no easy task to create a universe in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Except for the formation and control, the Purple Mu Ning Godly Way was much weaker than other Godly Ways on many aspects.</p>

  <p>As time went by, Mike asked Joy to enter his universe to open a world.</p>

  <p>Joy tried to build the Purple Sky Land in the universe. This was how the Purple Power World came into existence.</p>

  <p>Thus, it was quite easier for Joy to build a world in the Evolutionary Universe as compared to doing so in the divine land. Not to mention the fact that she had Mike's backing as well.</p>

  <p>Joy was quite talented. After she created the Purple Power World, she created many great sword arrays, among which the Gods Killing Sword Array was the most powerful one.</p>

  <p>As Joy was fully satisfied with her creation, Mike pointed out that the swords that the most powerful Gods Killing Sword Array was using were not real swords, but they were rather illusory swords. He also drew attention to the fact that the so-called illusory swords were invisible, and were made by the Power Shaping which forced the power out of one's body.</p>

  <p>Joy wasn't a Demi-holy Being at that time, so she quite couldn't exert the Cross-world Theurgy. She was only able to practice the second stage of the Power Shaping and was still unable to do away with the real swords, the Long Vine Sword, the Buddha Emperor Sword, the Grant Sun Sword and the Heavenly Tooth Sword which were given to her by Mike.</p>

  <p>Joy no longer used the four swords now, but she still kept them, as they reminded her of the wonderful time she spent in the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>Mike also had Joy's support when there was trouble on the Luo Clan's Floating Island. However, she was just a top-rank True God at that time, and she couldn't cultivate the illusory swords of the Gods Killing Sword Array. She was willing to help the Luo Clan but was ordered to stay on the Han Clan's Floating Island. The Han Clan went to the extent of assigning a consummate True God to her, who watched her closely thus, she was unable to slip by. Thus, she sat idly by and watched Mike suffer.</p>

  <p>Those were dark days for Joy. She vowed that she would try to help Harold and others, if opportunity arose. She also wondered if Mike would come back, since he and his universe were immortal after all.</p>

  <p>She just waited for the right moment to come by.</p>

  <p>However, Harold didn't like the idea of her helping him as he was quite aggressive towards Joy. She recalled the time when she met Harold on the Everest Spirit Mountain and he actually wanted to kill her.</p>

  <p>Today, as Zheng's true identity surfaced up, she finally understood that this might all have been Mike's brilliant plan.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was just like Mike. They both had the same luck with the women.</p>

  <p>Many years ago, after she left the Evolutionary Universe, the Purple Power World had not been wiped out and she had left her inheritance inside it, especially the Gods Killing Sword Array.</p>

  <p>She made a deal with Mike that if there appeared a first rank Purple Power Body in the Evolutionary Universe, the one would inherit all.</p>

  <p>Mike jokingly told Joy that no one could have the Purple Power Body like she had as she was quite unique. Unless Mike made a Purple Power Body, only then the one with the Purple Power Body would be qualified to inherit Joy's belongings.</p>

  <p>Since the first rank Purple Power Body came into being, Joy thought that she might have been created by Mike. She did not expect that the woman who owned the first rank Purple Power Body and inherited her Gods Killing Sword Array was actually Zheng's wife.</p>

  <p>Joy smiled and asked, "Has she entered the divine land yet?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shook his head and said, "I'm not sure."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng took Ning Yudie and his other families to the fairy palace. But Luo Zheng didn't let Mu Ning enter the fairy palace, much to her protests.</p>

  <p>As one of the ten Godly Geniuses, Mu Ning was destined to have her own path. According to the arrangement of Wynn, she should have been able to come to the divine land as soon as she got her Godly Tile.</p>

  <p>She already went through the process of blood exchange and Harold was still struggling with the Jiang Clan in order to create an opportunity for the Godly Geniuses.</p>

  <p>By the time Luo Zheng left the Evolutionary Universe, Tianming was long gone.</p>

  <p>He always wondered how the other Godly Geniuses were doing and whether they were able to make it to the divine land or not.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Joy spoke, "According to Mike's plan, she should be smuggled to the ancestral land of the Han Clan as well. A warrior like her should be trained by me personally. I'll have some people look for the woman with the Purple Power Body in the regions under the control of the Han Clan. What's her name?" Joy enquired.</p>

  <p>"Mu Ning Xi," Luo Zheng replied. "But it would be quite difficult to find her in the divine land as it is likely that she'd be using a fake name."</p>

  <p>The divine land's length lay no bounds. It was quite enormous.</p>

  <p>The fact that Luo Zheng was able to see Joy was due to a plan that he came up with, and at the same time he relied on his talent to enter the Floating Island, though he became a member of the Purple Soul Hall by accident.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry, it's not a big deal," Joy said, shaking her head. She had made up her mind. She had missed a chance many years ago, and this time she would not be absent anyway. Then she continued, "Let's just talk about the Gods Killing Sword Array.</p>

  <p>Only those who possess the Cross-world Theurgy can do what you have done. What kind of an inner world did you build? How can you use it even without forming the Godly Tile?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng gave a dull smile and said, "That's one of the reasons why I can't form a Godly Tile."</p>

  <p>"Aren't you able to form a Godly Tile?" Joy appeared lost in her thoughts. She knew how important Luo Zheng was to Mike. If Luo Zheng couldn't condense a Godly Tile, it wasn't because Luo Zheng wasn't talented enough, but because the Godly Tile Luo Zheng wanted to condense was special or the inner world he constructed was special.</p>

  <p>Mike and Bromley were the two most creative Holy Beings in the divine land. It was quite normal for them to cultivate someone like Luo Zheng. But if he couldn't form his Godly Tile, it would be a huge trouble. Joy asked Luo Zheng, "Do you need my help with it?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shook his head and said, "I've made a breakthrough. I have found a solution." He didn't want to tell Joy because it was of no use. Even Bromley wasn't able to help him in this problem. But since Luo Zheng had found more mud, he only had to get enough points in the Arena of Legends in order to get the mud and condense the Godly Tile.</p>

  <p>Seeing Zheng's confidence, Joy changed the subject and said, "Since Mu Ning has been able to cultivate the Gods Killing Sword Array, and since she is your wife, you must have seen the Gods Killing Sword Array."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I have. I have also seen the Purple River Sword Array, the Two Modes Sword Array..."</p>

  <p>Before Luo Zheng could finish his sentence, Joy said, "They all used to be my sword arrays back in the day, but I could only use the real swords back then. Although the Gods Killing Sword Array is powerful, it has a huge limit."</p>

  <p>Joy later became the Demi-holy Being and succeeded in using the illusory swords. After she mastered the Power Shaping, she had a new understanding of the Gods Killing Sword Array.</p>

  <p>She was aware that the power of a sword activated by the Cross-word Theurgy would be much more powerful and the change in it would be much more rapid.</p>

  <p>She was also aware that the strength in it would be more than a hundred times stronger.</p>

  <p>As Joy spoke, she calmly waved her hands.</p>

  <p>The calm and peace was interrupted by a swishing sound.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng saw Joy's power transformed into dozens of invisible swords and they flew aimlessly, in all directions.</p>

  <p>Thousands of invisible, colorless long swords pierced through the purple mist, leaving the shadows of the swords.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was soon surrounded by the sword shadows.</p>

  <p>Joy gave Luo Zheng a faint smile and said, "At the beginning, the Gods Killing Sword Array only had the Four Swords Change. Later, I figured out the Thirty-two Swords Change, the Ninety-six Swords Change, and other techniques. You have mastered the Cross-world Theurgy. Moreover, you can cultivate the Grand Purple Mu Ning Technique. It should not be difficult for you to learn it. Today, I'm teaching you the Four Swords Change. The Four Swords Change was personally made for me by your father, and today I'm teaching his son."</p>
