<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Neither Supreme Lord Leroy nor Luo Zheng had expected the queen's order to have such an effect over every member of the Demon Night race.</p>

  <p>Over the years, Xun had long disappeared, and Ying had been reincarnated into Shania, who was obsessed with the study of laws.</p>

  <p>After Yao had controlled the Demon Night race, she went against her clansmen's will and discriminated against those who held different views. The Board of Elders couldn't endure her behavior any longer, but as the Queen of Punishment, she had her own methods of ruling with a heavy hand by suppressing her people's anger and dissatisfaction.</p>

  <p>Despite that though, those strong negative emotions never disappeared.</p>

  <p>Rather, they were accumulated bit by bit, somewhat like a silent volcano, preparing itself for eruption. The pressure building within the race became greater and greater.</p>

  <p>After the Sacred race started to invade the Evolutionary Universe, Yao had brazenly announced that they would join hands with the Sacred race.</p>

  <p>At that point, the entire Demon Night race had already reached the limit of their endurance.</p>

  <p>They considered themselves part of the universe. If this had happened in the past, they would have probably chosen to fight against other races in order to strive for the territory and resources. After all, it was for the sake of their own race. As the Sacred race invaded, all the races rose together in an attempt to expel them, but Yao wanted her race to take their side.</p>

  <p>The Demon Night members had reached the end of their forbearance.</p>

  <p>Most of them thought their queen had gone mad.</p>

  <p>Even so, they still chose to follow their queens' orders. No one took the lead in raising any objections. The Supreme Lords chose to remain silent too, and the Board of Elders didn't utter a single sound. No one was capable of speaking up to their queens.</p>

  <p>Despite their lack of action, they grew more and more disappointed, slowly reaching a tipping point.</p>

  <p>That was why the three generals of the Demon Night race had appealed to Yao, in hopes that she could temporarily withdraw the troops and even stop the war.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Leroy spoke at that very moment, and his order was like a spark thrown into a burning pan of oil. The rage that had been suppressed for so long by the Demon Night members was finally erupting.</p>

  <p>"Let's go! We now have a new option!"</p>

  <p>"We don't need to work for such a brutal queen anymore!"</p>

  <p>"I will follow the Queen of Killings!"</p>

  <p>World lords and martial artists of the Soul Sea Realm, the Spirit Supreme Realm, and the Spirit Transformation Realm shouted at once, all beginning to flee.</p>

  <p>A few of the others tried to stop them.</p>

  <p>Of course, Yao had ruled the Demon Night race for many years and therefore, she had many trusted followers on her side.</p>

  <p>Almost all the commanders in the expeditionary army were her subordinates and also her loyal followers.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The whip snapped through the air so fast that only its shadow could be seen exploding like a firecracker.</p>

  <p>A Demon Night commander had brandished her long whip and reprimanded the escaping soldiers, "Those who escape from this battle will be killed!"</p>

  <p>Punishment for the Demon Night race was extremely severe. If the soldiers led by the commanders ran away, they too would have to bear a great share of the responsibility.</p>

  <p>The situation was getting out of hand though: too many martial artists wanted to flee. Despite the whip strike from the commander, over a hundred of them had already left. It was known to all that the law couldn't be enforced when everyone was considered an offender. How could the commander stop this?</p>

  <p>Seeing that her warning had no effect on her soldiers, the commander raised the whip in her hand once again and lashed it toward a martial artist at the Spirit Transformation Realm.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>A second unbearable snapping sound was heard. The commander was as strong as a world lord, so her whip had extraordinary power. Without being able to defend herself, a small portion of the Spirit Transformation Realm martial artist's body exploded after being hit by the whip, before she fell onto the Bloody Plain.</p>

  <p>The commander was facing a juncture.</p>

  <p>And she had no other choice but to execute one as a warning to the others.</p>

  <p>Despite seeing this cruel scene, the Demon Night warriors who wanted to leave didn't get intimidated. It was a pity that the commander's method required absolute strength. If the commander was a Supreme Lord, then she was probably capable of intimidating the soldiers who wanted to flee by killing that martial artist.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, she was only a world lord herself. Quite a few of the soldiers that fled were also world lords, and a few of them were even grand world lords.</p>

  <p>The moment the madly fleeing soldiers saw their comrade-in-arms lying dead on the plain, an intense emotion immediately displayed itself on their faces. dozens of aggrieved gazes were focused on the commander, too.</p>

  <p>"She is loyal to Yao," someone said.</p>

  <p>"She's the culprit! Let's kill her to avenge our comrade-in-arms!" another soldier agreed.</p>

  <p>"Rip her apart!"</p>

  <p>The soldiers might not have the courage to face Yao, but they didn't fear their commander. At least, far less.</p>

  <p>The long whip wielder's facial expression had also changed drastically within a split second. The soldiers who wanted to run away just moments before had turned into raging devils in the blink of an eye. She could sense their anger pulsating toward her.</p>

  <p>After nervously retreating a few steps backward, the commander turned around with the full intention of escaping the furious mob.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately for her, it was too late. The angry soldiers instantly rushed forward, tearing her to shreds in seconds.</p>

  <p>The other commanders could do nothing but stand to the side and watch the scene. Their faces had all turned dreadfully pale with fright. They didn't dare to stop the fleeing soldiers anymore.</p>

  <p>And as a result, more and more soldiers fled, of course.</p>
