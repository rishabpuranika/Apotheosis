<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2565 An Opportunity To Break Out Of Prison </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The masters who were exiled here wouldn't yield easily.</p>

  <p>Over the years, they had tried every means to leave this place, but they still couldn't get rid of the restraints on their bodies. It felt like they were doomed to just stay and wait for death to come, but they shouldn't be stuck with no choice.</p>

  <p>As soon as Luo Zheng appeared, they saw a ray of light, a little hope to what they were trying to figure out. He was going to tell them a way to escape this world. It was something the exiles naturally thought was inconceivable.</p>

  <p>If it weren't for Luo Zheng's special identity, they would have already driven him out and wouldn't give him the chance to speak. His presence stirred up the place, causing doubts and confusion.</p>

  <p>"When I first entered this world, I encountered two members of the Warden race," Luo Zheng said calmly to the group of exiles.</p>

  <p>Thinking for a moment, the oldest man said, "Though they are the managers of this world, the Warden race rarely appears. Even if they show up, they usually disguise themselves by using the phantom token.</p>

  <p>This way, ordinary people won't notice their existence at all. Are you sure you have met them?"</p>

  <p>The Warden race, as its name suggested, was the warden of the prison, making these exiles their prisoners. They were tasked to watch over and make sure no one would escape.</p>

  <p>These prisoners did everything and would do unimaginable things in order to get out of this prison. If the people of the Warden race randomly appeared, they would be instantly torn into pieces by the exiles.</p>

  <p>In fact, some exiles secretly investigated the lair of the Warden race, hoping this would give them a way out of prison, but got nothing.</p>

  <p>The Warden race usually had regular visits planned. Every hundreds of years, they would secretly inspect the bone towers of each race, disguising as phantoms every time. That way, only the powerful exiles could perceive their arrival, and the rest remained clueless.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'm sure it was them." Luo Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>"How can you prove it?" the oldest man asked, looking at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"They showed me the Curse Chain," Luo Zheng replied. "And I saw it myself," he said in a sure tone.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing this remark from Luo Zheng, all the exiles took a deep breath.</p>

  <p>The biggest constraint in this prison was the Curse Chain. It was what had been holding them locked up in this world. Even the oldest man, who clearly had supreme strength, could not do anything to cut loose from this invisible Curse Chain.</p>

  <p>Feeling confused, Leopold finally stepped up and asked, "I'm curious.</p>

  <p>Why did the Warden race contact you?"</p>

  <p>As the manager of this world, the purpose of the Warden race was to ensure that no one could leave the prison. To date, Leopold had made countless attempts to communicate with them, but they had always been silent and non-responsive.</p>

  <p>Hearing Leopold's doubts, the others were also unable to hide their confusion. They thought Luo Zheng was making up a story. They couldn't believe he would be lucky enough to see two wardens.</p>

  <p>"Because of the disputes within the Warden race, some of them wanted to escape," Luo Zheng replied. "But getting out was never easy. The faction that tried to escape failed, leaving only a girl and her brother."</p>

  <p>Since he mentioned it already, Luo Zheng ended up telling them everything about Zelda and Luther.</p>

  <p>The exiles listened as Luo Zheng relayed all the information that he had gathered so far. After he finished, he looked around and found all of them standing still in silence. They were pondering over what Luo Zheng said, unable to hide its complexity with their own facial expressions.</p>

  <p>At least, Luo Zheng's statement was logical, and it helped them verify something they had theories about in the past.</p>

  <p>For example, Zelda told Luo Zheng that the Warden race was chasing them.</p>

  <p>Within this 1, 000 years, the Warden race frequently visited the bone towers of the different races. In the past, they appeared once every two or three hundred years only, but for some reason, they had appeared more than a hundred times in the recent decades. Why?</p>

  <p>Ramzi, Leopold and other masters had also speculated on the unusual action of the Warden race. They wondered if something had happened in this world. Otherwise, why would the wardens be wasting time doing these unnecessary rounds?</p>

  <p>The masters were left to figure out a reason on their own. The Warden race was not expected to communicate with the exiles at all, so there was no way for them to figure out what had happened.</p>

  <p>Now that Luo Zheng mentioned it, it seemed that the Warden race constantly visited the bone towers to look for this girl and her brother.</p>

  <p>All the exiles wanted was to run away from this world. Some had actually tried everything they could think of, hoping they would succeed.</p>

  <p>However, it was totally impossible for them to escape the prison built by the Chaos Ancient God.</p>

  <p>After a long while, the oldest man opened his mouth to break the silence.</p>

  <p>"If what Luo Zheng said is true, this is probably a great opportunity for us. Also, it is an opportunity we have never known before and never to occur again."</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, you are indeed a descendant of the Grand Chieftain! A real son of heaven! You've met such a great opportunity," Ramzi exclaimed, unable to contain his excitement.</p>

  <p>"Then, shall we bring the girl and her brother into our bone tower first?" one of the exiles suggested anxiously.</p>

  <p>He knew that the siblings were being sought. If the Warden race found and took away Zelda and Luther, this rare opportunity would probably disappear.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng just observed and decided not to say anything. After all, these exiles were more familiar with their world than he was.</p>

  <p>After thinking for a long time, the oldest man finally continued to ask Luo Zheng, "Are the girl and her brother in danger now?"</p>

  <p>"They are staying in a tribe on the edge of the Immemorial Wilderness right now. So for the time being, they are safe," Luo Zheng assured him.</p>

  <p>For many years, Zelda and Luther had stayed in the Iron Tribe, and Luo Zheng had just helped them eliminate the Macon Tribe. Zelda's status was very stable, so as long as there was no accident, they would be safe.</p>

  <p>"That's good. There's still three years left before the Light of Adjudication comes. We still have time. Until the right time comes, let's not act rashly and alert the enemy." The oldest man made a decision. "I'll get in touch with the other races, such as the Snake Goddess race, the Flame race, and the Heavenly Joy race, so we can put our heads together and make the perfect plan."</p>

  <p>He knew that leaving this world was not only the dream of the Nine Li race, but the dream of all the exiles. They would need all the help they could get if they wanted to succeed.</p>

  <p>Once they knew the way out of this world, the Warden race wouldn't be able to stop them.</p>

  <p>Adele, Giacomo, Erik and the others saw Luo Zheng and the masters quietly communicating with each other. Confused as to what important things they were plotting, they couldn't understand why they were talking so secretly and carefully.</p>

  <p>At this moment, a person from the Nine Li race came.</p>

  <p>"Grand Elder, some special envoys from the Yellow Emperor race come to ask for a meeting."</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished with the announcement, he noticed that all of the powerful masters of his race had left the cave and come to the square.</p>

  <p>Stunned, he remained standing there in a daze for a while, not knowing what just happened.</p>

  <p>It was difficult for him to see any one of them in thousands of years. But today, for some strange reason, all of them appeared at the same time.</p>

  <p>Why?</p>

  <p>Looking at the reporter, Adele asked, "They come for the Sky South Bone Tower, right?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, they come to deliver a challenge in writing," the clansman answered.</p>

  <p>"I knew they would not let go of this so easily." Adele's face was covered with a layer of cold air.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing this, Giacomo and Erik also frowned.</p>

  <p>The exiles would not deal with the affairs in the race by themselves. So as the Grand Elder, Adele was in charge of everything.</p>

  <p>However, this time, after agreeing to sign the bet with the Yellow Emperor race, her race had lost two talented warriors and fell into a passive position. It was her mistake and it made her very angry.</p>

  <p>"Let Adele deal with the matters of our race," the oldest man advised, watching her from afar.</p>

  <p>Other than matters concerning their own lives, the exiles wouldn't participate in the fights between the Wild Gods. They naturally chose to avoid getting involved in these things whenever they could.</p>
