  <p>
</p>

  <p>The moment the woman appeared, the atmosphere immediately shifted.</p>

  <p>The inner worlds within the Purple Soul Hall disciples' bodies started to tremble slightly. Everyone's, of course, except for Zheng's.</p>

  <p>Joy had mastered the Purple Aura Godly Way so well that she had reached the level of Purple Sky Land, and thus, she could have a strong impact on the other Purple Power Bodies.</p>

  <p>Once again, though, on everyone except Zheng. His elixir field had no reaction at all.</p>

  <p>Silence befell the platform in a split second.</p>

  <p>A few well-informed female disciples had already received accurate news that forced by Alfredo Han, the Purple Soul Hall had no other choice but to expel most of its disciples.</p>

  <p>For the disciples in the Holy Emperor City, though, this was good news.</p>

  <p>The disciples in the Holy Emperor City had long envied the Purple Soul Hall. And at the same time, they felt the overall situation was truly unfair. How come the women from the Purple Soul Hall had so many more resources despite their weaker strength?</p>

  <p>All afraid of Joy, no one dared say anything, though.</p>

  <p>Now that the head of the clan had ordered Joy to banish eighty percent of the female disciples from the Purple Soul Hall, they were quite content.</p>

  <p>Recently, when these female disciples went to the Holy Emperor City, they were mocked by the disciples there, by a higher or lower degree.</p>

  <p>When they had originally heard the news, no one could believe their own ears. Later, though, they were informed that it was true.</p>

  <p>In fact, their guess had been confirmed just by the expression on Joy's face.</p>

  <p>A few of the women looked as though they were on the verge of tears, their eyes hastily turning red.</p>

  <p>Some of them had already been staying in the Purple Soul Hall for many years. Although their strength hadn't increased much over this period of time, they had deep feelings of attachment to the people in the Purple Soul Hall. How could they ever feel willing to leave?</p>

  <p>Sadness spread throughout the group. It wasn't long before someone cried out loud. Even Mae and the others, who were on the platform, were affected by the scene, their expressions contorted and eyes red.</p>

  <p>"It seems that most of you are already aware," said Joy. "The majority of you have to leave in three months' time."</p>

  <p>The Holy Emperor stipulated a deadline of three months. By the end of the next three months, the jade tokens of most of these disciples would be cancelled on the Floating Island, and all these people would be discharged from the island!</p>

  <p>"All of the proving godly warriors must leave. Eighty percent of warriors at the True God Realm will equally be expelled," Joy continued.</p>

  <p>Zheng had heard of this in the past. He was quite disappointed to hear it again, especially coming from this Demi-holy Being directly.</p>

  <p>He had just entered the Floating Island and had not yet had the chance to show himself. Was he already being driven out?</p>

  <p>Learning that they weren't even going to give him a chance, Zheng was obviously disappointed. If they were expelling the proving godly warriors who ranked in the bottom eighty percent, he would still have a great chance of joining the top twenty percent. However, the Han Clan didn't have a good impression of proving godly warriors, and thus, they got rid of all the proving godly warriors in the Purple Soul Hall without hesitation.</p>

  <p>Beneath the capable and aggressive exterior, Joy was actually a soft woman on the interior. The expelling of the disciples from the Purple Soul Hall wouldn't have much of an impact on her status and interests, but she still felt heartbroken.</p>

  <p>She had already argued with the Holy Emperor about it. The Holy Emperor had a much clearer attitude. He didn't care what she would do, but he made it clear that keeping the Floating Island among the top ten was the only way of keeping the female disciples of the Purple Soul Hall.</p>

  <p>Despite such, doing so was a near-impossible task. How could she possibly enhance the Purple Soul Hall disciples' strength so greatly in such a short period of time?</p>

  <p>Just as everyone was immersed in sorrow, Zheng suddenly took a deep breath and stood up.</p>

  <p>Zheng was only a proving godly warrior. It was obviously inappropriate for him to stand up on such an occasion. Since he didn't have the Purple Power Body, he felt out of place among these people. It took him a great deal of courage to take action.</p>

  <p>"Master, I would like to know how I can help our Purple Soul Hall get through this calamity!" Zheng went all out and exclaimed loudly.</p>

  <p>Madam Moon immediately took a step forward with the intention to scold him, but Joy stretched out her hand and stopped her. She smiled amiably and instead asked, "Are you the person that Mae brought back from Han Clan's ancestral land?"</p>

  <p>Although she couldn't remember his name, she at least remembered that he was from the Purple Soul Hall. Zheng said, "Yes. My name is Tianxing Luo."</p>

  <p>Nodding her head, Joy continued, "Of course, there's a way. I've given it some thought. In your next three months here, each of you will have to win four consecutive battles in the Arena of Legends. Do you think that's possible?"</p>

  <p>If it had been that only one of them had to accomplish such a feat, it would have been possible.</p>

  <p>But it was unimaginable for each of thirty thousand people to win four consecutive battles in the arena. Everyone listening heard their master's words too, and no one could help themselves but sigh heavily. Their hearts felt weighted.</p>

  <p>Right then, Zheng continued to ask, "What if we succeed? Will everyone truly be allowed to stay in the Purple Soul Hall?"</p>

  <p>When Joy heard Zheng's rhetorical question, a bitter smile spread across her face. 'Ignorant people are indeed fearless, ' she thought. 'He has no idea how difficult it will be.' But she still nodded, "Theoretically speaking, yes."</p>

  <p>"If so, why don't we fight for it? There are still three months left." Zheng asked, his eyes shining with excitement, and his aggressive tone made it sound like he was blaming Joy.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng was only a proving godly warrior, everyone felt their hearts beat a little faster as he spoke. He was right. This goal might be elusive, but it didn't mean that they had to give it up now!</p>

  <p>"Let's give it a try!"</p>

  <p>"There's a very small chance, but I'm not willing to give it up!"</p>

  <p>"We... We won't be a drag on the Han Clan!</p>

  <p>There's still time, and we can work hard!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's words quickly aroused resonance, and the women present couldn't help but become restless.</p>

  <p>Originally, everyone present felt trapped in sorrow, but because Zheng had stood up and questioned them, the flames in the female warriors' hearts were ignited anew!</p>

  <p>Watching the hustle and bustle from above, Joy fixed her gaze on Zheng.</p>

  <p>Her enchanting eyes were full of appreciation as she thought to herself,</p>

  <p>'What a powerful little fellow...'</p>

  <p>It wouldn't have been easy for any other ordinary person to encourage them from such low spirits.</p>

  <p>Zheng showed no fear when confronting her.</p>

  <p>Never had a proving godly warrior dared to challenge a Demi-holy Being before on the Floating Island!</p>

  <p>Now that this had just occurred, it might actually be possible for the Purple Soul Hall to raise its rank and for its disciples to reach the same level as the other disciples of Han Clan in three months!</p>

  <p>This effect came directly from Zheng's words!</p>

  <p>'If you can't beat them, join them...' Joy thought to herself. Then she said,</p>

  <p>"I declare that the Purple Soul Hall has entered a special period, and it will give its disciples unlimited support throughout such a time!"</p>

  <p>As expected, Joy's words caused another commotion among the warriors.</p>

  <p>Zheng took his chance and slipped into the crowd. Only Joy could see what was going on in the crowd below. She also noticed Zheng, and a trace of doubt appeared in the depths of her eyes and in her soul.</p>

  <p>Zheng quietly found a Jade Wall of Legends a few days later.</p>

  <p>Hundreds of people sat cross-legged beneath the Jade Wall and their bodies had completely fallen into the Arena of Legends. They were all focused on fighting, hoping to earn the most points in a terribly short period of time.</p>

  <p>Many people were quite disgusted with the Arena of Legends. After completing the three mandatory battles every month, they usually wouldn't set foot anywhere near it.</p>

  <p>But now, in order to stay, the disciples of the Purple Soul Hall had to raise their points and rank like never before in the Arena of Legends!</p>

  <p>Soon, the Jade Wall of Legends in the Purple Soul Hall was overcrowded with people.</p>

  <p>"I won another battle today. That means I now have two consecutive wins!" a woman exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Be careful. Once you've won two wins in a row, the opponent you meet in the next round won't be nearly as weak!" her companion reminded her.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know," the victorious woman replied.</p>

  <p>Within the Arena of Legends, the rules were very fair. If you continued to win, the opponents you would encounter would become more and more powerful.</p>

  <p>Zheng waited for a long moment before someone finally put away their jade token and withdrew from the arena. It was the woman who had just spoken. Her jade token demonstrated that she had won two battles.</p>

  <p>Normally, the person who had won two consecutive rounds would take a good rest before facing the third battle.</p>

  <p>As soon as the woman stepped out, Zheng placed his jade token into the groove. The woman was a low-rank True God, and she was still immersed in the joy of her two consecutive victories. She looked at the Jade Wall with a casual expression on her face. After all, Zheng's cultivation base was a level lower than hers.</p>

  <p>In spite of her mood, when she saw that Tianxing had twenty-six consecutive wins, her mouth fell open so wide, her jaw could have touched the ground.</p>
