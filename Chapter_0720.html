<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>A loud voice rang throughout the area and drew the attention of the audience. "This is the first battle of our Bloodwood Cliff disciples! Crush him, Brody! Show your strength!"</p>

  <p>Cheers and yells erupted from the disciples of Bloodwood Cliff in support.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Lady Poison-blood, who sat at the back of the grandstand, stared coldly at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>This young man called  Luo Zheng Luo had once humiliated her, the leader of Bloodwood Cliff. However, she wouldn't let such a thing spread around.</p>

  <p>After all, she was a dignified leader of a fourth-grade sect and she didn't want to have her good reputation ruined by this unscrupulous young man.</p>

  <p>But that didn't mean she would not do anything to revenge herself.</p>

  <p>"Brody, come over," Lady Poison-blood said in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"Yes, my Lady!"</p>

  <p>Brody Bu heavily walked towards Lady Poison-blood's side.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Lady Poison-blood put her delicate finger into her mouth and gently bit it. Blood oozed from her soft fingertip.</p>

  <p>Brody's eyes twitched slightly when he saw what Lady Poison-blood had done in front of him. "My Lady…" he said in a trembling voice.</p>

  <p>The Bloodwood Cliff wasn't known for their decency, and they were involved with countless acts of sorcery and crooked means. Brody clearly understood what their leader wanted to do.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry, this soul-killing poisoned blood can help you to reach full potential in a short period of time and I will help you make up for the life span you will lose in the process. However, you have to go down there and kill that brat!" Lady Poison-blood laughed viciously. Brody just looked skeptically at her, and tried to deny her plan.</p>

  <p>"My Lady, I don't need that boost to kill that brat!" he said and hurriedly shook his head. However, Lady Poison-blood just giggled, and her beautiful face became even more charming and enchanting.</p>

  <p>"I know, but…</p>

  <p>Just in case that you will need it!"</p>

  <p>With that, she stretched her finger towards Brody's chest and drew a symbol with the blood on her fingertips. The blood symbol flashed and entered Brody's chest.</p>

  <p>At that moment, it was as if Brody had become a completely different person. His eyes turned red as a sinister laugh came out of his mouth.</p>

  <p>"I will destroy him, my Lady!" he said and then leapt into the arena.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Luo Zheng also walked towards the arena.</p>

  <p>"It's that brat who's at the fourth level of the Illuminating Soul Realm. It's his turn to fight again!"</p>

  <p>"He actually defeated Alex in the last round. It seems that we can't call him as a common Illuminating Soul Realm cultivator. His real strength is far beyond that."</p>

  <p>"He merely defeated Alex because he took his opponent by surprise. In terms of real strength, he can't compare to a warrior at the Internal Elixir Realm!"</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng was a disciple from a fourth-grade sect, it was still hard for many of the martial arts practitioners to accept that an Illuminating Soul Realm warrior had defeated an Internal Elixir Realm warrior.</p>

  <p>Not everyone could challenge an opponent who was levels higher than their own. The Central Region had an ironclad rule that one's cultivation level decided his strength. Only a few elite disciples of the fourth-grade sects might easily challenge higher level disciples. However, this group of talented disciples was extremely rare!</p>

  <p>Alex, whom Luo Zheng had defeated was a descendant of the third-grade Gongsun Clan, and also had the rare heaven-level talent!</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Luo Zheng had overcome the great gap between them, and almost beat Alex dead in one strike. That was not what the spectators had expected to see. They were extremely shocked by the turn of the events and thought that the fight was unfair. From a psychological point of view, they hoped very much that Luo Zheng would lose, and lose miserably in this round.</p>

  <p>This time, Luo Zheng faced a disciple from a fourth-grade sect. The spectators all pinned their hopes on Brody.</p>

  <p>Just then, several disciples from the back of the grandstand walked in. They were dressed in white and had the pattern of clouds on their chests. They were the disciples of Cloud Hall, and the two people at the helm were Patrick and Tianming!</p>

  <p>"I never thought that the ticket to the Martial Arts Contest would be so expensive. It cost us a supreme life vitality crystal each." Lewis sulked from behind them.</p>

  <p>"We should feel lucky to be able to get inside. The battle has already begun.</p>

  <p>I wonder how the Cloud Hall disciples are doing in the battles," Tianming turned around and glared at him.</p>

  <p>Several months had passed, and Patrick had already entered the fifth level of the Illuminating Soul Realm while Tianming had improved even more. He had already reached the fourth level of the Illuminating Soul Realm, and had almost caught up to Patrick when it came to cultivation.</p>

  <p>This time, they had carried out a mission that the Cloud Hall had assigned in Black Prosperity Country, which happened to be near the Oracle City.</p>

  <p>They knew that the Martial Arts Contest was about to kick off, and they certainly would not miss this opportunity. Thus, they went directly to the Oracle City after they completed the mission.</p>

  <p>"The one on the stage seems to be a disciple from the Bloodwood Cliff. I wonder who his opponent is," Patrick said indifferently as he glanced at the arena.</p>

  <p>Tianming's sharp eyes swept across the crowd, and one person who slowly walked to the battle stage caught his attention. He felt that this person was a bit familiar. His eyes widened when he realized who he was. "It is...Luo Zheng!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"What? Luo Zheng? Is he here to watch the Martial Arts Contest as well?" Lewis asked. Meanwhile, Patrick looked to the direction where Tianming was staring at, and then his face suddenly hardened.</p>

  <p>"It's really Luo Zheng. He's not here to watch the Martial Arts Contest. He's in the battlefield." He smiled wryly.</p>

  <p>"What!" Lewis was so surprised that he bolted upright. He craned his neck above the crowd to get a better view of the arena, and then his mouth went wide. Lo and behold, it was Luo Zheng. "It's really Luo Zheng. What is he doing up there? Is he trying to get killed?"</p>
