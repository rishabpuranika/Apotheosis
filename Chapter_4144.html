  <p>The chaos was an immensely vast space, so it was naturally hard to find a specific target or location within it.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess tilted her head and thought for a while. After a few moments, she said, "Bring me to Li Shan mountain. I have an Other Shore Token that can determine the location."</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven looked at her curiously. He did not know that she had such an Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>"I have a set of mother-child butterflies?a mother and three children. They can determine each other's positions, no matter how far they are from each other," she explained.</p>

  <p>She had obtained her set of mother-child butterflies quite a long time ago, so the Primeval Lord of Heaven had forgotten about it.</p>

  <p>"Thank you so much," said Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>After he had dissolved his avatar, he woke up in the Night View Island. Meanwhile, the Primeval Lord of Heaven handed the Descending Ring over to the Snake Goddess.</p>

  <p>Then, he chanted the Illusion Breaking Rune. He asked Fuxi, who was in Li Shan mountain, to summon the real Snake Goddess.</p>

  <p>When the real Snake Goddess had descended, she looked at the vast expanse of Li Shan mountain with curiosity. After all, her avatar was the one who created this super force and was also the only fruit left by the many seeds they had sowed.</p>

  <p>As soon as she finished observing, she stretched out her hand and flicked gently. One large and three small butterflies appeared beside her.</p>

  <p>The four beautiful butterflies were all in cyan color, and they danced gingerly around her.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, keep the mother butterfly and put it in Li Shan mountain. Put the other three small butterflies outside your primitive land. This way, they can sense each other," the real Snake Goddess ordered.</p>

  <p>In turn, Luo Zheng did as she directed. After he put the mother butterfly away, he placed the three small ones inside his inner world, and his avatar brought one of them to the edge of the primitive land.</p>

  <p>As for Dale and the Primeval Lord of Heaven, they still waited in the chaos.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng went out, he released one of the small butterflies. The small animal flew around for a bit, then it stopped on the outer wall of the primitive land, and stayed still.</p>

  <p>Dale looked at the butterfly and asked, "Luo Zheng, can you determine the location of the divine land?"</p>

  <p>"The location of the divine land? I don't think I can." Luo Zheng shook his head.</p>

  <p>If the distance was close, then he could sense the location of the divine land.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, he was too far from it. Furthermore, the divine land was a ship that was still moving. Of course, it was quite hard for him to find it.</p>

  <p>"Wait, why did you mention the divine land? You know the divine land?"</p>

  <p>He suddenly felt quite confused. Logically speaking, Dale could not know the existence of the divine land.</p>

  <p>"Give me one of the small butterflies," Dale said as he stretched out his hand towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng gave Dale a strange look, then handed him a small butterfly. "Can you find the divine land with this?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I can find the Ruin Graveyard, and I can let someone in the Ruin Graveyard carry this butterfly as an Other Shore Token," Dale answered with a smile.</p>

  <p>"The Ruin Graveyard? What does it have to do with the divine land?"</p>

  <p>At that point, Luo Zheng felt extremely uneasy.</p>

  <p>He had heard of the Ruin Graveyard when he was passing through the space cave after leaving the divine land. However, he had never left the Source World, so he did not know much about it.</p>

  <p>"Not long after you left, the divine land became part of the Ruin Graveyard. We built the Ruin Graveyard," Dale replied.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes flashed. "You, you built the Ruin Graveyard?" he asked in disbelief.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Dale said with a nod, then added, "If the end has come and you haven't developed the primitive land enough, we will activate the Ruin Graveyard. It will be our last resort. After all, the Ruin Graveyard is not the real primitive land."</p>

  <p>"Is the divine land safe now?" Luo Zheng asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>After he had left for so long, he had thought about everything in the divine land.</p>

  <p>A smile graced Dale's face. "Although the Ruin Graveyard is notorious, it's not what the outside world thinks. It's just that everyone inside cannot come out. Your master, Bromley, has been staying there, so he could not return to the divine land."</p>

  <p>"My master?" Once again, Luo Zheng's eyes widened in surprise.</p>

  <p>Before Luo Xiao, his father, had left the divine land, he asked him to search every place in the divine land to find Bromley.</p>

  <p>He had searched for some time as Luo Xiao had requested but to no avail.</p>

  <p>He did not expect that Bromley was in the Ruin Graveyard!</p>

  <p>Satisfied with the effect of his words, Dale continued, "Many of the consummate True Gods in the divine land have reached the Other Shore Realm. Especially Rocher, who considered you as his opponent, is now at the thirty-second stage of the Other Shore Realm."</p>

  <p>"How is that possible?" Now, Luo Zheng was even more shocked, but he quickly shook his head and looked at Dale suspiciously. "After the change on the Other Shore, how did ordinary people enter Stage Thirty-two? Moreover, why did we not know that the people from the divine land had entered the Other Shore?"</p>

  <p>It was quite hard to reach the Other Shore Realm outside the Source World. Also, it was not easy to cross the energy vortex between the Desire World and the Desire World. Without the Chaotic Source World, they could not reach the Chaotic Source Realm. It would even be harder for them to pass the tests in the Soul City and the Land of Bone Tribulation, so they also could not possibly reach the Eternal Realm.</p>

  <p>"The Other Shore they entered is my master's Mysterious Yellow Tower.</p>

  <p>It's different from your Other Shore," Dale said with a small grin. *</p>

  <p>"I see."</p>

  <p>Finally, Luo Zheng sighed in relief.</p>

  <p>He felt gratified to hear that Rocher had reached the thirty-second stage of the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>Afterward, he asked Dale about the recent situation of his family members.</p>

  <p>As the eldest disciple of the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord, Dale's most important duty was to take charge of the Mysterious Yellow Tower. Of course, he remembered everyone inside it clearly.</p>

  <p>He could even tell everyone from Luo Zheng's descriptions,</p>

  <p>After he had answered Luo Zheng's questions, he suddenly asked, "You asked about your parents and your master, but you didn't ask anything about your son. Don't you want to know where he is?"</p>

  <p>"My son?" Luo Zheng was stunned again. "Luo Nian? Is he also in the Ruin Graveyard?"</p>

  <p>As far as he knew, his son was in the Abstruse Energy World. How could he have anything to do with the Ruin Graveyard?</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven was also confused. Since the Deleting Space had closed, no one knew about Luo Nian's and Ziya's whereabouts until now.</p>

  <p>Did Dale really know where they were? Still, it seemed impossible.</p>

  <p>"Of course, he is not in the Ruin Graveyard. He is in the main world," said Dale.</p>

  <p>"I know he is in the main world, but how did you know?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Previously, Dale had answered "I don't know" to every question, but now he seemed to know everything. There was such a glaring difference that everyone was confused.</p>

  <p>Then, Dale told Luo Zheng what had happened in the Mysterious Yellow Tower.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing that Luo Nian had climbed to the top of the four pillars, he quickly began to worry. He truly never expected that Luo Nian would reach that unimaginable place after he had explored the Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, now that he knew that his son was safe and sound, he could reassure Letitia.</p>

  <p>At that moment, he dissipated his avatar, and Dale and the Primeval Lord of Heaven retrieved their souls from his inner world.</p>

  <p>Then, the crack he had torn apart surged, and the ancestry-level bloodline quickly repaired it.</p>

  <p>"Your primitive land has opened up completely now. As to how to strengthen it and use the ancestry-level bloodline, you have to explore those by yourself. I have completed the task my master assigned to me. Now, it's time to go back," Dale stated.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng cupped his hands and said, "Master Dale, since you came from the Jade Pure Realm, do you know how to go to the center of the Jade Pure Realm?"</p>

  <p>"The center of the Jade Pure Realm?" Dale felt slightly taken aback. He did not know why Luo Zheng was interested in that place.</p>
