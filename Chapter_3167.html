  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was a disciple of the Heart Flow Sect. Konnor and the other Heart Flow Sect disciples had invited him to attend the Seven Mountains Meeting.</p>

  <p>Eventually, Konnor bit the bullet and said, "Young Master Marco, Luo Zheng is an elite disciple of the Heart Flow Sect. He is here to take part in the Seven Mountains Meeting. You have no right to chase him out like this."</p>

  <p>"Cut the crap!"</p>

  <p>Marco did not care to hear any of Konnor's words; he had no time for them.</p>

  <p>He would not only chase Luo Zheng out, but also find a chance to beat him up.</p>

  <p>It might have seemed a rash decision, but Marco was a smart and calculated man.</p>

  <p>Ling Shuang was destined to find a husband, and although the Taiyi Heaven Palace was large and filled with talented disciples, all those worthy of pursuing her were all gathered here.</p>

  <p>Marco was determined to stake his claim today. He would have it known that anyone who dared to woo Ling Shuang would be crossing not only him but the Vastness Mountain too.</p>

  <p>And when his father put pressure on the Origin Mountain again, they would have no choice but to let Ling Shuang marry him.</p>

  <p>"If you had just left yourself, you would not lose face. But since you refused, do not blame me for what happens next."</p>

  <p>The aura gathered within his body suddenly burst forth. His arms reached out with his hands closing in fast on either side of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>His Soul of Light had reached Stage Thirteen of the Desire World. He had also absorbed a powerful Other Shore Token. The force his hands unleashed reached two hundred Jun.</p>

  <p>Marco intended to crush Luo Zheng's arms and toss him down the mountain. The building might not have been on the edge of the mountain, but it wouldn't be difficult for Marco to throw him many miles away.</p>

  <p>"Marco is going to throw that man out!"</p>

  <p>"That guy is probably going to die."</p>

  <p>"He is only in the fourth stage of the Other Shore Realm and not even close to Marco's level. Why is he being so stubborn? He should have just admitted his mistake and left peacefully. How stupid is he?"</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, be careful! Jermain, help him!" Ling Shuang yelled, distress in her tone.</p>

  <p>As the second largest mountain of the Taiyi Heaven Palace, the Origin Mountain naturally had many outstanding disciples. Ling Shuang had called for Jermain Song's help. He too was an elite disciple of the Origin Mountain.</p>

  <p>Jermain Song and the other disciples from the Origin Mountain had been watching the scene closely. They didn't want to provoke Marco either. As long as Marco didn't hurt Ling Shuang, they wouldn't make a move.</p>

  <p>However, now that Ling Shuang had asked him to help, Jermain Song had to act. But it was already too late for him to be able to stop Marco.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>Marco's hands slammed into Luo Zheng's arms, fast as lightning and with a clap of thunder. Immediately, Marco's face changed to a mask of astonishment.</p>

  <p>Things had not gone as he had expected.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's arms were not like flesh and blood at all. They were as solid as an Other Shore Treasure. Marco had no chance of smashing them into pieces.</p>

  <p>In contrast to Marco's astonished face, Luo Zheng wore a confident smile on his face. Marco was confused, not knowing what lay behind that smile.</p>

  <p>The others were just as baffled. It appeared as though Marco was embracing Luo Zheng as a long lost friend.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng then twisted his arms slightly, sliding out of Marco's grips and now grabbed Marco's arms tightly.</p>

  <p>Marco tried his best to resist, but Luo Zheng's strength exceeded all his expectations. He was helpless.</p>

  <p>A foreboding swirled in Marco's stomach. He clenched his teeth hard and warned unconvincingly, "How dare you..."</p>

  <p>Before he could finish his warning, the sky and earth began spinning around. An intense force pushed him as the tables, the chairs, the beams, the eaves, the flying ships, the river, and the peak were all shrinking in the distance. He continued to fly further and further.</p>

  <p>The hall was unusually quiet. It was almost unsettling.</p>

  <p>The girls on the stage had also stopped dancing.</p>

  <p>Everyone looked at Luo Zheng, astounded and befuddled.</p>

  <p>Ignoring their backgrounds, Marco was still much stronger than Luo Zheng. What just happened defied everything they knew. Somehow, Marco had been thrown out instead of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha..."</p>

  <p>Feng Ge, who was sitting in the front, flashed a rare smile. She didn't try to stop the fight, but looked at Luo Zheng with interest.</p>

  <p>The rest remained silent.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng started to move, they all understood that he was not as simple as he looked.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had only reached the fourth stage of the Other Shore Realm, but the Other Shore Token he had fused with must be extraordinary. The power that he had just released was obviously far beyond Marco's.</p>

  <p>However, the power of a warrior at the Other Shore Realm not only depended on their brute strength, but also the theurgies they had cultivated and all the unique and strange abilities of their Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>Marco had underestimated Luo Zheng greatly and paid the price for it.</p>

  <p>He would usually seek revenge for much less than this, and there was no chance he would let Luo Zheng get away with this.</p>

  <p>This conflict between the two had nothing to do with most disciples present.</p>

  <p>So even the disciples from the Killing Sword Sect and the Unique Array Sword Sect of the Taiyi Mountain were taking pleasure in Luo Zheng's misfortune.</p>

  <p>Konnor and Mekhi were very anxious. 'Luo Zheng is much too fearless, ' they thought.</p>

  <p>But Marco had gone too far, and they couldn't blame Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Mekhi, you must help me later." It seemed that Konnor had come to a big decision.</p>

  <p>Mekhi nodded and stood beside Konnor stoutly. They would not let Marco bully Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Jermain Song stood in front of Ling Shuang and Luo Zheng. Ling Shuang was the granddaughter of the Origin Mountain's head, so he would naturally do all he could to protect her.</p>

  <p>"Don't be afraid of him. Our Origin Mountain is no pushover," Ling Shuang said, comforting Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't know whether to laugh or cry on seeing how much she cared about him. He then said, "Everyone, I am grateful for your kindness.</p>

  <p>Marco's target is me and me alone. I will deal with him on my own. You need not confront him."</p>

  <p>With that, he walked past Konnor and Jermain Song and stood in the open space in the hall.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng..."</p>

  <p>Ling Shuang's eyes were slightly red. She saw Luo Zheng as too confident in himself.</p>

  <p>Marco was a direct descendant of the Vastness Mountain's head, and his talent and strength were both incredibly formidable. He was a tough opponent that could not be underestimated.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng was confident and felt he did not need any protection. Ling Shuang didn't dare to force him. She knew there was no changing his mind now.</p>

  <p>Many people shook their heads when they saw that Luo Zheng intended to face Marco alone.</p>

  <p>"Marco was careless; that's the only reason he was caught off guard and thrown out."</p>

  <p>"Does this bloke really think he has the ability to stand up to Marco?"</p>

  <p>"If Marco takes this seriously, this guy will pay with his life."</p>

  <p>Before long, a horrifying aura emerged from outside the building.</p>

  <p>Marco appeared at the gate. He was covered in dust and rubble, looking a real mess. But the expression in his eyes was sharp and murderous and filled with fury.</p>

  <p>He was thrown out by a nobody in public.</p>

  <p>As the son of the leader of the Vastness Mountain, he was humiliated. This could not stand.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>With a crisp sound, Marco drew his sword.</p>

  <p>The green sword shone coldly. Three dots of light began floating out of his head like ghosts. They circled gently several times, like little butterflies, before landing and merging into his sword.</p>
