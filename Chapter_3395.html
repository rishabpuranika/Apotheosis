<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The group made their way north and with the help of the soul mark, they had found Dorothy.</p>

  <p>To their surprise, she was in a naturally formed cave with an underground stream, not a large pit as they had thought.</p>

  <p>A strange look crossed Luo Zheng's face as they neared the entrance to the cave.</p>

  <p>Dorothy should have been able to sense Luo Zheng's presence through the soul mark. If she had, she needn't have stayed in the cave any longer. There was no hurricane, no danger at all. She should have come out to meet him by now.</p>

  <p>But the soul mark showed that Dorothy still remained motionless in the cave. How very unusual.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had a bad feeling about this and charged into the cave as his body tingled in concern.</p>

  <p>As he entered, an unmistakably strong scent of blood rushed to his nose.</p>

  <p>He raised his eyebrows as his concern mounted higher and sped up in his pace through the cave.</p>

  <p>The underground stream ran red with blood and broken limbs, some belonging to humans, some not.</p>

  <p>The stomachs of Chaim and the others following behind Luo Zheng turned at the sight of this wretched scene.</p>

  <p>They had entered into a similar cave before, with a similar scene. Back then, all but one member of the Separate Abyss race were dead.</p>

  <p>The only good news right now was that Dorothy's soul mark still existed.</p>

  <p>She was alive, but how or where she was was still to be discovered.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, like a bat flying in the night, dashed through the incredibly complicated cave with speed and ease.</p>

  <p>'Dorothy, please be safe, '</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng prayed sincerely from the depths of his heart.</p>

  <p>When he had gotten about ten thousand feet deep into the cave, what he saw shocked him even more than before.</p>

  <p>The bodies of more than a dozen disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace and over a hundred nonhuman creatures piled up in a large gruesome mound before him.</p>

  <p>"Konnor..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng saw Konnor, with his eyes open wide, lying on the edge of the pile of corpses.</p>

  <p>His body was stiff and the fear on his face was obvious. He had died miserably.</p>

  <p>"Efrain!"</p>

  <p>Following closely behind Luo Zheng, Chaim had found Efrain's body, lying there lifeless.</p>

  <p>Before Luo Zheng had joined the Taiyi Heaven Palace, Efrain and Chaim were the two most gifted disciples of the younger generation. They had been close and so the sight of Efrain's corpse left Chaim distraught.</p>

  <p>He never would have imagined that with Efrain's considerable strength, he would have died before even entering the core area.</p>

  <p>Sally tried to comfort him but he was inconsolable.</p>

  <p>The six members of the Nine Li race were much luckier than these disciples.</p>

  <p>At the very least, their soul marks hadn't disappeared. They still wandered around the periphery of the Chaotic Source World. Umar was making his way towards them, although he was being slowed by the hurricane.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng gritted his teeth and pulled those corpses out of the pile.</p>

  <p>He violently tossed one corpse after another aside.</p>

  <p>Once they had all been moved, a bloody figure emerged from beneath them.</p>

  <p>It was Dorothy. She sat motionless on the ground, her long hair dyed red with blood and her eyes shut firmly.</p>

  <p>Four-legged snakes coiled around her head.</p>

  <p>"It's the Evil God!" Chaim blurted out when he saw the four-legged snakes.</p>

  <p>They had seen these same four-legged snakes before.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng checked Dorothy's body and a tinge of relief washed over him.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, she was not hurt. She didn't even have any wounds. But the four-legged snakes had formed a barrier around her and had sealed her in.</p>

  <p>"How do we remove these four-legged snakes?" asked Sally frowning.</p>

  <p>When the member of the Separate Abyss race had tried removing them, it had caused him extreme pain. He decided he would rather patiently and slowly clean them off himself than let anyone else help him.</p>

  <p>"Let me have a try," Luo Zheng said cautiously.</p>

  <p>For the member of the Separate Abyss race, the four-legged snakes had lain on his wounds, but Dorothy had none. The misery on her face was, however, unavoidable.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng reached out and grabbed a snake. With a gentle squeeze, the snake was crushed into pieces.</p>

  <p>The circle formed by the black four-legged snakes was broken. Suddenly, they moved, and jumped at Luo Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng reacted quickly and calmly, slapping them to pieces and turning them into energy currents.</p>

  <p>Dorothy's body began trembling as she slowly woke up. She began breathing fast and retreating on her arms, kicking her feet as she slid backwards. "Don't come closer! You can't kill me!" she screamed wildly.</p>

  <p>People like Feng Ge and Dorothy had been given some powerful Latent Theurgies before entering the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>However, the Latent Theurgies would only be triggered at fatal moments.</p>

  <p>Because of this, Dorothy was not afraid of the Evil God. She believed that no matter how powerful he was, he would have no choice but to run away in panic once the Latent token her grandma gave her was activated.</p>

  <p>But she had not anticipated the possibility that he had no intention of killing her.</p>

  <p>He had just sealed her on the spot and covered her in corpses.</p>

  <p>"It's me! Look closely, Dorothy! It's Luo Zheng!" Luo Zheng said loud.</p>

  <p>Dorothy's soul had been sealed for a fair amount of time. Even after being freed, she was still caught in a daze.</p>

  <p>She studied the man in front of her carefully, bit her lips and rushed towards Luo Zheng with tears in her eyes.</p>

  <p>This took Feng Ge by surprise. Dorothy had it much worse than she did.</p>

  <p>"It was the guy from your inner world," Dorothy said pained.</p>

  <p>"I know," Luo Zheng replied nodding.</p>

  <p>After a long while, Dorothy calmed down.</p>

  <p>"The Evil God has killed so many people. Why did he let Dorothy off?"</p>

  <p>Chaim asked confused.</p>

  <p>When the member of the Separate Abyss race had escaped disaster, it was with his own strength and ability, not because the Evil God had shown him mercy.</p>

  <p>Dorothy was confused too.</p>

  <p>She had gone all out in her fight with the Evil God. She had used her Other Shore Token, the Twin Blossoms, and given all she had with the Origin Swordsmanship, but she was still no match for him.</p>

  <p>She never thought she'd make it out alive.</p>

  <p>"It's a provocation," Luo Zheng said as he stared at Dorothy. "He did it on purpose to send a message."</p>

  <p>The Evil God had seen Dorothy standing beside Luo Zheng at the gate of the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>Perhaps this was why he did not kill her and only sealed her beneath the corpses.</p>

  <p>Such an act was nothing but a provocation.</p>

  <p>"He is a freak," said Feng Ge, frowning in disgust.</p>

  <p>The killing intent in the depths of Luo Zheng's eyes grew stronger and stronger. He silently helped Dorothy rub off the blood stains from her body.</p>

  <p>Although he said nothing, all around him felt his intense killing intent.</p>

  <p>In the Chaotic Source World, Luo Zheng and the Evil God were bound to clash.</p>

  <p>But the strength of the Evil God had them all deeply concerned.</p>

  <p>Once the blood stains had been removed, Chaim stored the bodies of Efrain and the other Taiyi Heaven Palace disciples in his space ring. It was an undeserved fate to come face to face with the terrible and unreasonable Evil God.</p>

  <p>With that, the group left the cave.</p>
