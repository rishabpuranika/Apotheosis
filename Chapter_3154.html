<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>


  <p>
</p>

  <p>A sudden thought occurred to Dorothy and she smiled before saying, "We were climbing so fast that I forgot to mention something. Since you've joined the Heart Flow Sect, you need to get the soul mark of the Taiyi Heaven Palace."</p>

  <p>"How do I get it?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"The Heart Flow Sect has sent two beautiful maids to serve you, hasn't it?</p>

  <p>You can go and ask them for it. I'll wait for you here," Dorothy said, still smiling. But her voice had taken on a strange inflection at the mention of the maids.</p>

  <p>"Okay," Luo Zheng said, preparing to leave the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>"Wait," Dorothy called out to stop him. When he turned around, she asked him with a playful smile, "I forgot to ask. How are you doing in the Heart Flow Sect?"</p>

  <p>"I'm happy," Luo Zheng said, almost too immediately.</p>

  <p>But he quickly understood what Dorothy was trying to ask him.</p>

  <p>There were only three sword sects in the Taiyi Mountain, of which the Heart Flow Sect had the most unique cultivation method. Dorothy must have heard about it before, which was probably why her words were dripping with jealousy.</p>

  <p>But she hadn't expected Luo Zheng's wives to be living in the courtyard house along with the two maids.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng chuckled awkwardly before his Soul of Light left, leaving Dorothy gritting her teeth and glaring at him.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng returned to the courtyard house, he asked Trish to get the soul mark.</p>

  <p>Trish was a capable girl. She came back just an hour later and handed a small dark green token to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"The soul mark is used in the same way as the Other Shore Key. The required syllables are engraved on the token," Trish explained.</p>

  <p>Once Trish left, Luo Zheng began to recite the syllables on the small token, the same way as he had used the Other Shore Key. Several lines appeared in his palm.</p>

  <p>But the lines weren't as complex as those of the Other Shore Key.</p>

  <p>More lines had appeared on his palm by the time he returned to the temple.</p>

  <p>It was the soul mark unique to the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>The guards checked the lines on Luo Zheng's palm before they let him in.</p>

  <p>Dorothy waited patiently by the entrance. She didn't ask him about the maids once she saw him enter the temple, a fact that filled Luo Zheng with relief.</p>

  <p>There were many Souls of Light in the temple. Most of them had a profound Truth of Eternal Sword Intent. Their auras filled Luo Zheng with the feeling that he was in the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>Dorothy led the way through the left gate of the temple.</p>

  <p>A bronze wall stretched across the gate. In the middle of the wall was a relief in the shape of a long bronze sword.</p>

  <p>Several disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace were already gathered before the gate.</p>

  <p>One of the disciples ran his hands over the relief. The surface of the long bronze sword emitted a strong soul aura and a small white light spot the size of a rice grain dripped from the sword's tip.</p>

  <p>"It is soul crystal!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng blurted out the moment he saw the white light spot.</p>

  <p>Back in the Sacred Mallow Temple, Dorothy had told Luo Zheng that the soul crystal was rare, and that it was different from the soul pill. It could, on its own, strengthen the Soul of Light.</p>

  <p>But the nugget of soul crystal before them was too small. It was only the size of a rice grain.</p>

  <p>Even so, the disciple who had earlier patted the relief seemed very happy.</p>

  <p>He carefully absorbed the white light spot into his Soul of Light and then sidled out of the crowd, satisfied.</p>

  <p>Following that, several disciples also put their hands on the bronze sword.</p>

  <p>They could also obtain a nugget of soul crystal, but the size was different.</p>

  <p>The nugget of soul crystal that some disciples got was as tiny as a needle's tip and could hardly be identified if one didn't observe it carefully. Some others got a bigger piece of soul crystal.</p>

  <p>"The soul crystal within the temple is distributed according to the disciples' assessment results. If they are Taiyi Guards, the soul crystal will be distributed according to their merit points. The gaps are usually huge,"</p>

  <p>Dorothy explained.</p>

  <p>"How big was the one you obtained?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Dorothy pursed her lips and smiled. She wasn't about to answer this question.</p>

  <p>Dorothy's soul aura had become much stronger after she had returned from Stage Four to Stage One. She must have obtained a big chunk of soul crystal.</p>

  <p>It was a while before it was finally Luo Zheng's turn.</p>

  <p>The disciples who had gotten their hands on the soul crystal were dawdling by the side because they wanted to see the soul crystal Luo Zheng could get.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng reached out a hand and gently patted the long bronze sword. The sword began to gleam and a ray of white light shot through the sword tip.</p>

  <p>It converged into a white light spot that swelled increasingly and finally grew to the size of a fist.</p>

  <p>The disciples were astonished at the size of the soul crystal.</p>

  <p>"So big!"</p>

  <p>"Is he cheating? How did he get such a big one?"</p>

  <p>"Who is this man?".</p>

  <p>The chunk of soul crystal that Luo Zheng had obtained was dozens of times bigger than those of ordinary people.</p>

  <p>"It looks like the Heart Flow Sect is paying great attention to you,"</p>

  <p>Dorothy said, surprised to see the fist-sized chunk of soul crystal.</p>

  <p>She had begged her grandma before she was allowed to get the soul mark.</p>

  <p>Given her grandma's status, the Taiyi Heaven Palace would give her the most resources of all.</p>

  <p>Even so, the size of soul crystal she had obtained from the temple was similar to Luo Zheng's.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng knew why.</p>

  <p>His performance in the Flow Tower was enough to attract attention from the Heart Flow Sect. He wouldn't have been able to receive such a large chunk of soul crystal otherwise.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng and Dorothy had absorbed soul crystal the size of a watermelon in the Sacred Mallow Temple, which was why Luo Zheng was not shocked to see the fist-sized chunk of soul crystal.</p>

  <p>He absorbed the soul crystal under the envious gazes of the disciples.</p>

  <p>Dorothy led Luo Zheng out of the room and into the next room.</p>

  <p>A Soul of Light guarded the room. It was not human, but a huge beast that emitted a strong Truth of Void Destruction.</p>

  <p>"That's a Thunder Beast. Go. It'll make a space ring for you," Dorothy said, pushing Luo Zheng towards the beast.</p>

  <p>Not all races were enemies with the human race. Some of them were small in number, but they had certain kinds of unique talents. They would seek protection from some big races, and this Thunder beast was one of them.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng approached the Thunder Beast, he heard a strange voice saying,</p>

  <p>"Stretch out your middle finger."</p>

  <p>As instructed, Luo Zheng stretched out his middle finger and the Thunder Beast lowered its head, two sharp tentacles extending from it and curling around Luo Zheng's finger.</p>

  <p>Soon, a bright square appeared on Luo Zheng's fingertip.</p>

  <p>This square was the same as Dorothy's. It was a space ring used on the Other Shore. Luo Zheng had been using space rings for many years, and was soon familiar with the new space ring and its way of usage.</p>

  <p>Once they exited the room, Dorothy transferred the soul pills and the metal branch that she had obtained from the Sacred Mallow Temple into Luo Zheng's space ring.</p>

  <p>"No wonder so many people want to join the Taiyi Heaven Palace. I can get so many treasures in Stage Four," Luo Zheng exclaimed as he looked wonderingly at the square on his fingertip.</p>

  <p>Dorothy didn't find these treasures amazing. She replied calmly, "The Taiyi Heaven Palace is always generous, but these are just appetizers.</p>

  <p>What's waiting for us ahead is more important. I haven't gotten it yet. Let's go get it together."</p>
