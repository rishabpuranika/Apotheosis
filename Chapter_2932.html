  <p>
</p>

  <p>Little by little, the thunder punishment started to disappear. It slowly reverted into a small lightning dragon. Ultimately, it returned to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The small dragon incinerated Zavier's body and instantly reduced it to a pile of ash.</p>

  <p>After the onslaught of thunder punishment, the existing huge crater became even bigger. It spanned over tens of thousands feet deeper than before.</p>

  <p>Subsequently, Green Lethal Fire Magma began to overflow out of it.</p>

  <p>As they watched the scene unfold before them, Estelle and Holy Jay were not able to stifle their gasps.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, Luo Zheng's expression remained inscrutable. He simply raised his head. Then, he looked at Salim, who stood on the other side.</p>

  <p>Even after all that, Salim remained perplexed. He wondered how Luo Zheng could have gotten stronger in such a short span of time. He even killed Zavier in the blink of an eye! What in the world was that small but fearsome lightning dragon?</p>

  <p>Salim was utterly stumped as he couldn't find the answers to these questions. As he locked eyes with Luo Zheng, he was overcome with a horrible realization. He would be slain too if he didn't run away now.</p>

  <p>He knew he needed to use the Grand Teleportation in order to escape. But as soon as he did, Luo Zheng blinked.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Salim found himself at the center of an invisible wave. Then, he felt as though his power was immediately sealed. Before he knew it, he was hurtling down from the sky.</p>

  <p>As she saw this happen, Estelle's eyes lit with undeniable awe and exhilaration.</p>

  <p>She was accustomed to using this kind of power. Her Scepter of Gods' Silence manifested the same effect. However, she noticed that Luo Zheng was able to display the same kind of power without using the Scepter of Gods' Silence.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's figure instantly disappeared as soon as he took a step in mid-air.</p>

  <p>Almost at once, he reappeared on the other side.</p>

  <p>At that point, his arm had already become enlarged. The strength source rapidly flowed through his arm and accumulated in his fist.</p>

  <p>Without a doubt, this punch was much more intense than the one Harold had in the Everest Spirit Mountain.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>As Salim hurtled down from the sky, Luo Zheng threw his punch upward. His fist successfully landed on his prey.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Even though his punch only sounded like a heavy thud, it effectively obliterated and vanquished Salim.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's figure slowly vanished from its spot as the scattered remains of flesh and blood began to rain down from the sky. He would not let himself get tainted with that filth. Once again, he reappeared next to Estelle and Holy Jay.</p>

  <p>He looked at them and calmly smiled, "Let's go."</p>

  <p>"Where do we go now?" Estelle inquired.</p>

  <p>"The Mountain of Holy Beings. The divine land needs a little cleansing.</p>

  <p>There are some people who must be wiped out from it," Luo Zheng answered.</p>

  <p>Estelle and Holy Jay caught each other's eyes and grinned. They already knew what he meant by that.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng activated the Grand Teleportation with a light tap of his finger. He proceeded to move towards the Mountain of Holy Beings. Estelle and Holy Jay followed closely behind.</p>

  <p>No matter how far his destination was, Luo Zheng was always able to reach it in a single step. It was due to the fact that he had strongly bound himself to the divine land's will.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had only been gone from the Mountain of Holy Beings for mere half a minute. Now, he was back with Estelle and Holy Jay.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings had absolutely no idea what just occurred. However, Leyton was wearing a rather sour look on his face. It was simply because he ordered Zavier and Salim to hunt down Estelle. So now that she returned safe and sound, he already knew something went wrong. "Where are Zavier and Salim?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Both of them are dead," Luo Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>Hearing his news left the Holy Beings utterly astounded.</p>

  <p>The Yellow Emperor Guards were regarded as invincible beings in the divine land. Hamish, for instance, was known as the weakest of the Yellow Emperor Guards. Yet, he would still be able to decimate everyone in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Be that as it might, Luo Zheng was still capable enough to kill two of the Yellow Emperor Guards in just a short period of time.</p>

  <p>From the Holy Beings' point of view, it seemed that Luo Zheng's strength was now on a whole different level.</p>

  <p>This knowledge opened a door with infinite possibilities for the Holy Beings. A couple of them were even delighted at this new information.</p>

  <p>They found Luo Zheng rather unlikeable. On the other hand, there was no denying that they detested Samuel more than him. It was due to the fact that Samuel did plenty of atrocious and horrendous things to the Holy Beings. He was supported by the Yellow Emperor Guards in his horrible deeds. Because of this, the Holy Beings harbored a deep resentment and anger towards him.</p>

  <p>They thought that through Luo Zheng's extraordinary strength, they could finally hold Samuel accountable for all his misdeeds. This time, they would actually be able to bestow punishment upon him.</p>

  <p>Out of them all, Samuel was the only one who found this a bit worrying.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's arrival had sent a chill down his spine. He immediately thought of the punishment he would receive for his actions after Luo Zheng defeated Leyton and his men.</p>

  <p>Leyton seemed to be concentrating hard. He narrowed his eyes and sighed.</p>

  <p>"I just made a single mistake. I did not imagine that this is how things would turn out."</p>

  <p>"I will give you a short while, an opportunity, to just kill yourselves," Luo Zheng told them in a cool and impassive manner.</p>

  <p>With that said, Leyton suddenly broke into a smile. He seemed confident as he replied, "The Yellow Emperor Guards will never yield. Not in the past, not in the future!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes glinted dangerously at this statement. "Not in the future, huh?</p>

  <p>You are absolutely right. Because the Yellow Emperor Guards have no more future. I will annihilate all of you along with the Yellow Emperor with my own two hands."</p>

  <p>As soon as they heard this, Leyton, Hamish, and Lorcan roared with laughter.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! Don't make us laugh! You really think you are invincible just because you fused with the original will? It's certainly preposterous to think that someone who has not even reached the Other Shore Realm intends to take on all Yellow Emperor Guards." Leyton continued to laugh hysterically.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's strength was not his own. It was a power he only borrowed from the divine land.</p>

  <p>In the divine land, he was like in his inner world. He was definitely invincible here. However, his power and invulnerability were only confined within the divine land.</p>

  <p>He would still be a consummate True God once he stepped outside the divine land. In actuality, his real power was immensely stronger than that of a normal consummate True God.</p>

  <p>Even so, Luo Zheng would face a whole lot of challenges after going to the Source World. But he even threatened to eliminate all of the Yellow Emperor Guards. Because of this, the Yellow Emperor Guards only took his threats as downright foolishness.</p>

  <p>Amidst all of Leyton's mockeries, Luo Zheng's expression remained calm and composed.</p>

  <p>Honestly, it was true that he had not been able to reach the Other Shore Realm yet. In any case, he kept progressing and surpassing even his own expectations. He always worked hard to achieve the goals he had set for himself. He accomplished them all starting from the Eastern Region to the Evolutionary Universe and now, in the divine land. He had no intention of ever stopping. Reigning over the divine land was just the first step in his plans.</p>

  <p>"Nothing stays the same. Change is inevitable," Luo Zheng stated as he smiled gently. "Naturally, you would not expect me, a creature from the universe of a Holy Being who was almost killed by Nicholas, to be able to end your lives."</p>

  <p>"Let me tell you, the Source World you have pictured in your imagination is entirely different from the real one. The Nine Li race that your precious mother defended has already been decimated. The Source World is not the same as the divine land. It doesn't matter whether you reach that place or not. You are of no importance at all. How can you even think you can compete with us?" Leyton announced with such pride.</p>

  <p>From the moment the members of the Bear race joined the Yellow Emperor Guards, they regarded it with high honor until the end of their lives.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had no plans of arguing with Leyton any longer. He merely shook his head and told him, "Unfortunately, you would not live to see that day."</p>

  <p>While he spoke, he lightly flipped the tip of his finger. Instantaneously, the lightning dragon burst forth.</p>

  <p>As soon as they saw that Luo Zheng made his move, Leyton, Hamish, and Lorcan simultaneously released their stunning momentum.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>The mouth of the Sea Cracking Skull opened and closed multiple times.</p>

  <p>Consequently, blood started to gush from the sky.</p>

  <p>Even though Leyton mocked and argued with Luo Zheng, he also considered and planned the different ways in which he could defeat him.</p>

  <p>He knew that even if Luo Zheng had the power of thunder punishment under control, he was still capable of enduring it with all his might.</p>

  <p>"Leave the lightning punishment to me!" Leyton bellowed while blood shadows charged from the Sea Cracking Skull. These blood shadows attempted to trap the thunder punishment within them by taking certain positions and arranging themselves around it.</p>

  <p>Hamish and Lorcan were already flying in the sky. But in the blink of an eye, they appeared beside Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Samuel had no other options left. With the Spear of Supreme Harmony in his hands, he opted to go all out and put his life on the line. He had already acknowledged the fact that Luo Zheng was way more powerful than him. With that, his only choice was to fight him head-on.</p>

  <p>"Outside the divine land, my power might not have that much significance.</p>

  <p>But inside, it is boundless and way beyond what you can fathom,"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng whispered as he bowed his head. He was absolutely ignoring the three men rampaging towards him.</p>
