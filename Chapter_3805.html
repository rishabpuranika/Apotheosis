  <p>
</p>

  <p>While there were many ways to determine the strength of an Eternal Realm master, the Eternal Scroll Painting was the most crucial aspect.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven was so powerful not only because he had obtained a unique bloodline power, but also because of what he obtained in Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>One could say that within the entire Other Shore, the thirty-two stages had many separate spaces, while Stage Thirty-three was a completely different world.</p>

  <p>That was the dome of the entire chaos, and it could even lead to the Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>"The scroll painting has already been unfolded!"</p>

  <p>"Everyone, get ready!"</p>

  <p>"Put your Heavy Stones into the Three Purities Stones."</p>

  <p>The Other Shore creatures that had already put their souls and bodies into the Three Purities Stones all pulled out their Light Stones to create white vortexes on the ground. Through these, they entered their own worlds of Three Purities Stones.</p>

  <p>Zheng followed suit, putting the Heavy Stone into the round hole at the center of the Three Purities Stone.</p>

  <p>After the Heavy Stone was positioned inside, magnificent, complex textures began appearing on the surface of the Three Purities Stone. The textures looked like the red-hot iron, converging toward the Heavy Stone in the middle.</p>

  <p>As the textures gathered, the Heavy Stone was ignited, turning into a bright red ball.</p>

  <p>With that, Zheng sat at the last corner of the Three Purities Stone, waiting quietly for it to help him enter the Eternal Scroll Painting.</p>

  <p>While many other creatures were busy entering the Eternal Scroll Painting, the Swallow Victory race, the Three-eyed race, and the other small Other Shore races all sent people to gather around Pearce.</p>

  <p>"Sir, would you happen to be Elder Pearce from the Oneness Sky Palace?</p>

  <p>And is this Elder Auden?"</p>

  <p>"I'm Florian of the Swallow Victory race."</p>

  <p>"Can you tell me where Eastern Emperor Taiyi of the Oneness Sky Palace is?"</p>

  <p>In the past, the Other Shore races didn't think much of the Souls of Light of Pearce and his companions, but now they managed to pay a visit together and treat him with some reverence.</p>

  <p>Both Pearce and Auden felt rather flattered.</p>

  <p>The purpose of their visit was simple— they wanted to know Zheng's identity.</p>

  <p>To do so, they even revealed their utmost willingness to support him.</p>

  <p>It was something that would have been almost unimaginable in the past.</p>

  <p>Back then, when Eastern Emperor Taiyi, the Snake Goddess, and the others tried uniting with the Other Shore races in Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore, all the races refused them.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore races had once tried their best to complete the Finale Way but to no avail. After they failed in the end, they chose to stay in a small world within Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore, satisfied with managing their small territories.</p>

  <p>It wasn't that they weren't willing to fight back, nor that they were scared.</p>

  <p>Both the bad end of the human race and some Other Shore races had served as a lesson for them.</p>

  <p>But today, the attitudes of the Grandmaster of Heaven and Claire offered them a glimmer of hope. Coupled with Zheng's attitude, these Other Shore races felt they should gain a better understanding of the situation.</p>

  <p>Of course, these Other Shore races didn't make such a big deal out of it.</p>

  <p>Instead of showing up themselves, the leaders of the various races sent their members here.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore races remained under the pressure of the Element Spirit race.</p>

  <p>Pearce, of course, was unwilling to let go of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. While explaining Zheng's origins, he also made some remarks to praise the warrior.</p>

  <p>Many Eternal Realm warriors remained within these Other Shore races. If they could gather, they'd form a great force as well.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh...</p>

  <p>At this moment, a ray of straight golden light suddenly shot out from the Three Purities Stone, shooting rapidly into the painting.</p>

  <p>The first ray of golden light shot out, followed by the second ray, then the third ray...</p>

  <p>The golden light was formed from the Heavy Stone embedded within the Three Purities Stone. The moment the light entered the Eternal Scroll Painting, it sent the Other Shore creature into the painting.</p>

  <p>Zheng was sitting in a corner of the Three Purities Stone. As the Heavy Stone grew brighter, the surrounding space began vibrating.</p>

  <p>A great gravitational force pulled Zheng's body upward.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The moment Zheng entered the Eternal Scroll Painting, it was as though he crashed into a solid wall at high speed. Or rather, he was hit by some sort of irresistible force.</p>

  <p>Regardless of how strong his physical body was, the power was unbearable.</p>

  <p>His entire body was pressed into a thin piece which was then imprinted onto the Eternal Scroll Painting.</p>

  <p>And it was at this moment that Zheng finally understood why the people on the Eternal Scroll Painting were all silhouettes.</p>

  <p>As it turned out, they were also forcibly pressed onto the painting, becoming as thin as paper.</p>

  <p>Normally, this meant anyone's death.</p>

  <p>Even a soul that was squeezed to this extreme would dissipate.</p>

  <p>But in this situation, Zheng's own consciousness and his physical body's perception were complete. His movements, however, were rather strange.</p>

  <p>Whenever he tried moving his hands, his feet moved at the same time, and vice versa.</p>

  <p>His body was then crawling horizontally on the Eternal Scroll Painting like a crab.</p>

  <p>While he could move, Zheng was a little morose.</p>

  <p>He felt as if he had changed into a creature of a completely different form.</p>

  <p>"Primeval Lord of Heaven, is this Eternal Scroll Painting turning us into a picture?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"You should have seen that before you entered the scroll painting." The Primeval Lord of Heaven had long anticipated Zheng's reaction.</p>

  <p>"What's the point of this?"</p>

  <p>Both the Soul City and the Land of Bone Tribulation were built to strengthen the warriors through trainings.</p>

  <p>Was it necessary to turn the warriors into the painting for them to reach the Eternal Realm and become Eternal Warriors?</p>

  <p>"The point?" The Primeval Lord of Heaven took a moment of thought before continuing, "Perhaps this is another way to enter the Abstruse Energy World."</p>

  <p>Apart from the Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore and the cave in the Deleting Space, there was no other way to enter the Abstruse Energy World, let alone the transmission method.</p>

  <p>But if warriors obtained their own bloodline theurgy in the Eternal Scroll Painting, it indicated that they had already left the chaos. It might be a different means of transmission, but the warriors had to be pressed flat beforehand.</p>

  <p>Of course, the Instant Civilization wasn't going to do anything meaningless— the Primeval Lord of Heaven's conjecture was valid.</p>

  <p>After hearing the Primeval Lord of Heaven's words, Zheng attempted to nod when he realized he couldn't complete the movement.</p>

  <p>It took a while to get used to it, and then he managed to move his hands and feet at the same time. He wasn't moving too slowly, but as he crawled along the Eternal Scroll Painting, he saw something slender approaching him from the distance.</p>

  <p>It was like an arrow, rapidly sweeping past Zheng.</p>

  <p>After it was out of sight, Zheng realized it was a member of the Violet Cloud race.</p>

  <p>"That's unfair!"</p>

  <p>Zheng shouted.</p>

  <p>The Violet Cloud members' bodies were suited to moving in this form, so they naturally ended up far faster than Zheng.</p>

  <p>"You haven't seen the members of the Element Spirit race. You're going to find it even more unfair when you do," said the Primeval Lord of Heaven, shrugging his shoulders nonchalantly.</p>

  <p>The bodies of the Element Spirits were ball-like. After being crushed, they remained in the same form, able to move freely within the Eternal Scroll Painting.</p>
