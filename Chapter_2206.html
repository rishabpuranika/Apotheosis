  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng had a longing to throw the piece of mud into his inner world. He was curious to find out as to what might happen to it.</p>

  <p>He let go of the mud, his nerves tingling with excitement.</p>

  <p>Zheng watched with anticipation as the thick, gooey mud fell into the chaotic sea. Vast bust bubbles appeared and a strange brown mist engulfed everything upon the moment of impact.</p>

  <p>Zheng grinned broadly. He noticed that even though the color of this mud was a tad bit different, it had the same effect as the one given by Linn.</p>

  <p>He assumed that the Tie Clan's mud was preserved for far too long; thus it turned brown rather than black.</p>

  <p>Thus, he grabbed hold of the other five pieces of the mud and threw them in the water.</p>

  <p>Much to his astonishment, the water appeared as if a submarine was emerging from it. It looked as if someone had put the sea on a burner.</p>

  <p>His excitement lay no bounds.</p>

  <p>Zheng couldn't quite believe what was happening in his inner world. He was further stunned when a dark brown cloud rose from his inner world and moved towards his Godly Plate.</p>

  <p>At this point, Zheng's comprehension of the Emotion Closing Godly Way was infused into the cloud, paving way for dark sword-like figures which rose from the cloud and started to glow, converging into sword clouds.</p>

  <p>The sky was filled with the whooshing sound of the sword clouds.</p>

  <p>The sword clouds made their way towards Zheng's Godly Plate. They tried to penetrate Zheng's Godly Plate, unsuccessful at first but after a while, they turned solid, into a triangle crystal and attached themselves to the center of Zheng's plate.</p>

  <p>Zheng noticed the difference in the size of both the crystals. He was astonished by how gigantic this crystal was.</p>

  <p>Thus, he came to the conclusion that the larger the pile of mud thrown into the inner world was, the larger the size of cloud would be, thus paving way for a bigger crystal to be formed. All Zheng ever wanted was to condense a Godly Tile in his inner world. He knew that the time was ripe and he had to condense his own Godly Tile. Although, he had some doubts about it.</p>

  <p>A few days ago, when Zheng was running away from that weird cave as quickly as possible, he found another cave adjacent to his. What he saw next turned his blood cold. Although he couldn't quite figure out what they exactly were, he knew he had to get away from those hideous black creatures.</p>

  <p>With Zheng's current level of strength, it wouldn't be a wise choice for him to return to that cave as his life was quite dear to him. He had to wait until his cultivation reached a higher level before going back.</p>

  <p>While staying at the Heavenly Han House, he obediently followed every command and listened to every single word the True Gods had said about the Godly Ways. Although the True Gods were blessed with knowledge, they were not very good fighters. Their sole purpose was to explore the Godly Ways.</p>

  <p>They had a firm grasp on the Godly Ways and knew them inside out.</p>

  <p>They even went to the extent that if a student was having some troubles in understanding the Godly Ways, they would explain them to him in plain simple words.</p>

  <p>Zheng knew he had to learn the Godly Ways. By the help of the Infinity Ruler, he was able to gain the recognition of a great deal of Godly Ways.</p>

  <p>He was also able to absorb the internal momentum of the Godly Way Tablets. The Infinity Ruler enabled him to release some of the power from those Godly Ways, although he quite didn't master the knowledge of the Godly Ways completely.</p>

  <p>Learning about Godly Ways from the True Gods helped Zheng greatly. He estimated that he would have been able to learn much more about the Godly Ways and would have acquired knowledge about the divine land, had he stayed at the Heavenly Han House for just one year. But this became impossible, much to his surprise.</p>

  <p>His stay at The Heavenly Han House lasted for a month.</p>

  <p>A month later, the members of the Han Clan came over.</p>

  <p>The arrival of the members of the Han Clan was a cheerful moment for everyone. News spread like wild fire through the whole Six-Burden Divine City each time a member of the Han Clan visited.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Han House had some disciples from the second-tier and third-tier clans. These clans had high expectations from their young members, hoping that one day they would be able to fulfill their destiny by joining the Han Clan and by entering the Floating Island.</p>

  <p>However, entering the Heavenly Han House was a daunting task and it was even more difficult to enter the Floating Island.</p>

  <p>It was no secret that countless True Gods wanted to get into the Floating Islands of the Han Clan and other rich clans. Mid-rank True Gods, like Master Evil, also demonstrated their desire to get into the Floating Islands. But only the Han Clan and few other clans truly deserved their place on the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>Thus, every year, the Han Clan recruited strong warriors from the Heavenly Han House and sent them to the Floating Island.</p>

  <p>This time, Zheng had the privilege to get recruited by the Han Clan and sent to the Floating Island.</p>

  <p>The news of Zheng being recruited made countless warriors resent him.</p>

  <p>These warriors dedicated their entire lives to the purpose of getting recruited by the Han Clan, thus having an opportunity to enter the Floating Island. But Zheng being recruited solely on the basis of his past performances made them quite jealous of him.</p>

  <p>There were some warriors who were so resentful of Zheng that they cursed him. They made fun of him and the Han Clan. They proclaimed that the mistake of recruiting Zheng might prove quite costly to them.</p>

  <p>In the main hall of the Heavenly Han House sat an old man who had a distinctive white moustache. He was wearing a cloak made of gold and looked impatient.</p>

  <p>"Adam did not live up to his name," the old man fumed. "He was a complete and utter failure at the Floating Island. We can't let that happen again." He addressed the members of the Han Clan gathered in front of him. His booming voice could be heard all over the place.</p>

  <p>The clan members sat there uneasily, their faces white with fear.</p>

  <p>When the old man mentioned Adam, the clan members flinched and wore a serious face. Among them sat a man named Bentley. He appeared quite enraged when Adam was mentioned, although he was quite good at disguising it quickly.</p>

  <p>Adam was the youngest son of Bentley, the leader of the sub-branches of the Han Clan. He was quite diligent and his talent knew no bounds. He didn't let the posh life-style of his fellow clan members get to him and continued to work hard. Even in the Han Clan, he was not inferior to any outstanding warrior.</p>

  <p>Although, the Han Clan didn't recruit warriors then, his father urged the clan members to send Adam directly to the Floating Island, assuring that he was prepared for the task as he became a proving godly warrior.</p>

  <p>However, Adam's stay in the Floating Island didn't last long as he was sent back three years later. Much to everyone's dismay, he had gone mad.</p>

  <p>It was rumored that Adam experienced great torture at the hands of other disciples. He was quite often bullied as well.</p>

  <p>Now Adam lived in his own family. It wasn't hard for the clan to raise a lunatic. Bentley felt partially responsible for Adam's current state. He knew he would never be able to forgive himself. When the old man mentioned Adam, Bentley resisted the urge to scream at the old man.</p>

  <p>"Adam is still one of us," Bentley said in a calm yet affirming tone.</p>

  <p>The other leaders knew how important Adam was to Bentley. And even though they didn't get along well with Bentley, they knew that mentioning Adam was completely immoral and unnecessary.</p>

  <p>The old man laughed sadistically. "I hope the sub-branches would recommend someone sensible this time, not a lunatic like Adam," the old man said without any remorse.</p>

  <p>This infuriated Bentley. He couldn't hide the outrageous expression on his face anymore. He stood up, facing the old man, his eyes flaming with anger. Other leaders had to calm him down as he still mumbled angrily under his breath.</p>

  <p>The old man held an important position in the Floating Island. But so did Bentley, who was the leader of the Han Clan's sub-branches. Although, Bentley's position was not inferior to that of the old man, he could always be overruled by the old man due to his status and his connections in the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>All the warriors that were inducted in the Floating Island were examined by the old man. Due to his position and vast experience, he was respected by all the members of the Han Clan. Bentley tried his best to please the old man, but every time the old man visited, he would bring up the unfortunate incident Bentley's son had, which enraged Bentley.</p>

  <p>Bentley vowed that he wouldn't leave the old man unscathed the next time he mentioned Adam. Had it not been for the leaders, Bentley would have struck down the old man for good.</p>

  <p>Although, the old man realized his arrogance, he felt humiliated by Bentley's actions and did not take them kindly. "Adam's talents were average. He was always proud and arrogant. When he realized he couldn't compete with the rest, he went mad, and the whole bullying story is being used as a scapegoat. How could you be so blind, Bentley?</p>

  <p>Just admit that he failed," he roared.</p>

  <p>Bentley was taken aback. He pointed out the fact that the old man himself tested Adam before he was admitted to the Floating Island.</p>

  <p>Bentley wanted to punch the old man, Yazid. But he knew that doing so would get him trouble and it might end up in him being banished from the clan.</p>

  <p>Yazid knew that Bentley couldn't harm him, even if he wanted to. "I will definitely test the warrior you recommend this time more carefully," he answered, while smiling maliciously.</p>
