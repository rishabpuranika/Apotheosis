<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The journey on the Sea of Truth became more difficult with each line crossed.</p>

  <p>Travelling on the Sea of Truth was a process that would cultivate one's Soul of Light, which meant that the longer one stayed on the Sea of Truth, the stronger their Soul of Light would be.</p>

  <p>This process revealed the advantages of being a member of Dragon City.</p>

  <p>The silver swords entered Zheng's flagpole and were continuously infiltrating the souls of the crowd. The effects were similar to a slew of soul pills swallowed intermittently, only to a much weaker extent.</p>

  <p>Zheng had stayed between the fifth and sixth lines for more than ten days, and his Soul of Light had grown stronger. He and Dorothy decided to try and cross the sixth line.</p>

  <p>It was a heart-stopping and spine-tingling process, but they finally made it.</p>

  <p>After they crossed the sixth line, Zheng discovered that the Sea of Truth held an abundance of whirlpools.</p>

  <p>Three to five whirlpools spun and twisted around them every once in a while.</p>

  <p>No one knew how many people had been trapped in these whirlpools, and these people were unable to escape in their lives.</p>

  <p>When Zheng and Dorothy passed by, they heard people call for help.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately for them, Zheng was not everybody's savior. He would help Winchell save his son, but he didn't intend to take the fourth candle away. If he angered the creatures who put the candles in the sea, he would be in great trouble.</p>

  <p>Zheng crossed the sixth line with his Soul of Light first, and then he used his physical body to cross the sixth line as well.</p>

  <p>The blazing red seawater had a specific effect on body refining, but it didn't have much effect on him. He continued to swim, even as the water around him began to boil like magma.</p>

  <p>It was during this process that Zheng clearly felt the presence of the Truth of Godly Way in his body, and at the back of his mind, he wondered if he could use the Truth of Godly Way in any theurgy.</p>

  <p>In the Source World, only Zheng could swim in the Sea of Truth. And so, he couldn't find any related theurgy, but perhaps in the future, he could figure some out himself.</p>

  <p>When both his soul and body passed the sixth line, Zheng decided that he was ready to stop the great whirlpool and rescue Dorothy's cousin.</p>

  <p>Dorothy had told Zheng earlier that the Lin Clan of the Origin Mountain was looking forward to this. Her cousin, in particular, was as eager for this day as a beaver.</p>

  <p>After the Ear Mouse sent fifteen million divine crystals to Zheng, the Lin Clan was completely convinced of Zheng's ability. Zheng had lit up Evaristus' eyes with a new hope.</p>

  <p>Zheng had asked Beldene and others to sell the Sword-reading Liquid for him for fifteen thousand divine crystals a bottle.</p>

  <p>Zheng thought that it was quite expensive, but Beldene and the others didn't agree. After all, other people could sell the Sword-reading Liquid at twenty thousand divine crystals, so this price was very low compared to others'.</p>

  <p>As Beldene had expected, one hundred and twenty bottles were sold on the first day.</p>

  <p>The remaining eighty bottles were reserved for those who couldn't buy them outright since they didn't have enough money, and they raised money overnight to pay for them the next day.</p>

  <p>Once Beldene had sold the Sword-reading Liquid, he entrusted Kenelm to buy the Heavenly Pure Liquid secretly.</p>

  <p>And he was wise to do so, for they were not the only ones who sold the Sword-reading Liquid, and their actions undoubtedly stole other people's profits and disrupted the market.</p>

  <p>For the time being, he didn't want to publicize the fact that Zheng could make the Sword-reading Liquid.</p>

  <p>Although it was unavoidable that the other sellers would find out, he preferred to keep it low-key to help Zheng earn a lot of divine crystals first.</p>

  <p>And it was a success, as in the past days, he had earned a lot of divine crystals for Zheng.</p>

  <p>Of course, Zheng didn't take all of these divine crystals. He only took a portion for himself, and then he gave the rest to his team.</p>

  <p>Gant was overjoyed when he also received ten thousand divine crystals.</p>

  <p>After he ran away from home and went to Dragon City, it was very difficult for him to take out hundreds of divine crystals.</p>

  <p>It made him appreciate Zheng even more, and he was happier for his decision to follow him. As for his identity as a Flag Master? He didn't plan to be a good Flag Master at all because he was the only one in his team.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng returned to his inner world again before he would remove the whirlpool that trapped Evaristus.</p>

  <p>Zheng created an avatar and kept his women company.</p>

  <p>Time flowed faster in his inner world than in the Source World. Every time he left the floating island his inner world, he would adjust the time flow rate so that the two places had the same time flow rate and his women wouldn't have to wait for him for too long. And when he came back to the floating island, he would turn the time flow rate back so that he could spend more time with the women.</p>

  <p>Zheng was looking forward to telling them all the things that had recently happened.</p>

  <p>Previously, the women were motivated to cultivate because they wanted to get out of the fairy palace. But now that Zheng could always accompany them, and since they were immortal, they had lost their desire to cultivate.</p>

  <p>Of all the women, only Xun remained focused on cultivating the Truth of Cultivation Nature, but her compatibility was very low.</p>

  <p>She had impressed Zheng because of her perseverance, so he intended to send her other Truths of Godly Ways. If her will was strong, she would be able to step into the Sea of Truth as well.</p>

  <p>It was only after Zheng had stayed in the Source World for a while, that he realized that entering the Sea of Truth was not as difficult as he had imagined.</p>

  <p>The reason why the divine land barely had warriors who could enter the Sea of Truth was that the Truths of Godly Ways and the Nine Li race's culture had been lost.</p>

  <p>After a few days on the floating island, Zheng's avatar flashed and arrived at a continent in his inner world.</p>

  <p>On this continent, the Heavenly Annihilation Sect was at the top of the food chain.</p>

  <p>A young man stood at the gate, with his hands behind his back and a long halberd in his hand.</p>

  <p>Thousands of people gathered a few feet away, and they were whispering among each other as they eyed the man up and down.</p>

  <p>"Who the hell is this freak?"</p>

  <p>"Evil God disappeared years ago, and now there is another mighty character!"</p>

  <p>"He's challenging the number one sect on his own!"</p>

  <p>The young man was none other than Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>Time had done him good, and now, he looked nobler and more mature.</p>

  <p>Since time flowed fleetingly outside the floating island, his current age was now about the same as Zheng's.</p>

  <p>He was now a low-rank True God. He fell into odds with the Heavenly Annihilation Sect because of the Flower Dancing Sect, the second sect on this continent.</p>

  <p>The problem could easily be solved— all he needed to do was go back to the floating island and tell his mother about this. Then his father would solve it for him.</p>

  <p>This was his father's inner world, and nobody would be able to stand up to him.</p>

  <p>One look from his father could kill the three strongest warriors of the Heavenly Annihilation Sect.</p>

  <p>But Geoffrey didn't want to take the easy way out; he wanted to solve this by himself!</p>

  <p>He was already competent in terms of skills and talent, and he had a certain understanding of the Truth of Cultivation Nature. He had already defeated seven people from the Heavenly Annihilation Sect in a row.</p>

  <p>These seven people were all contemporary peerless masters in this era, but they were all defeated by Geoffrey's single attack.</p>

  <p>"Heavenly Annihilation Demons! Get out!" Geoffrey shouted with his halberd pointed at the gate.</p>

  <p>Behind his conflict with the Heavenly Annihilation Sect was a gorgeous woman, the holy maiden of the Flower Dancing Sect.</p>

  <p>Different from his father, Geoffrey had only one lover, and he was furious at the Heavenly Annihilation Sect because they dared to antagonize the Flower Dancing Sect.</p>

  <p>As he spoke, a cold voice suddenly came from the Heavenly Annihilation Sect.</p>

  <p>"Humph! Do you think you can just insult everyone in our Heavenly Annihilation Sect? I will teach you to respect, boy!" It was an old man, and his hair flashed red against the sunlight, as he flew towards Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>"Good!" Geoffrey sneered at the old man and held his halberd at the ready.</p>

  <p>Red light blazed from his halberd, and his entire body emitted an extraordinary aura that dazzled those who were gathered around them.</p>

  <p>He was getting ready to attack when Zheng suddenly flew out from nowhere and came to stand behind him.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey paused in surprise, but his face was quickly marred by a frown.</p>

  <p>He asked, "Dad, why are you here? I don't need your help."</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled in amusement at his reaction, then eyed the old man in front of them and said, "I'm not here to help you. Actually, there's something that I need your help with."</p>

  <p>And Zheng was telling the truth. He had come for the two Other Shore Keys, and he wasn't about to fight his son's battles for him.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the red-haired old man, one of the Heavenly Annihilation Demons, was baffled. He could feel that Zheng was only at the Life and Death Realm, so how could this person be Geoffrey's father?</p>
