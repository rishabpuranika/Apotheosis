<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Killing could easily become an addiction. The more lives one took away, the easier it was for the malicious aura to grow deep within.</p>

  <p>The red specks of light were highly concentrated malicious aura— a single speck was the result of slaughtering over a hundred thousand living beings. Because they constantly absorbed these specks of light, the great impact on them was undeniable.</p>

  <p>Freya's chest was heaving. In her gentle, calm eyes, a glimmer of red light then appeared.</p>

  <p>Like the other martial artists, her heart seemed to grow wildly restless.</p>

  <p>The urge to tear apart every single thing in sight was strong within her.</p>

  <p>Even as she did her utmost to restrain herself, she could feel her reason gradually fading away.</p>

  <p>Huff!</p>

  <p>She condensed a stream of cold air.</p>

  <p>Instead of releasing it toward the other martial artists, she made the stream shroud her own body.</p>

  <p>The life vitality wasn't to protect herself— merely releasing the cold air was basically the same as cutting herself. In an instant, she was almost completely frozen solid.</p>

  <p>The invasion of cold air lifted her spirit, allowing her to maintain a clear mind.</p>

  <p>The other martial artists, on the other hand, were already unable to hold themselves back.</p>

  <p>The ogre martial artists were the first to launch their attacks.</p>

  <p>To begin with, they were naturally extremely bloodthirsty, so the malicious aura within their bodies was already much more than that of other martial artists. Such a massive amount of the aura triggered the already restless blood within them to boil even more.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" one of them roared. All his muscles tensed up, his veins bulging like earthworms under his skin. Then, he rammed into a human martial artist beside him.</p>

  <p>Small as he might have been beside the ogre, the human didn't want to let himself be outdone so easily. Instead of cowering in fear, he chose to fight the monster head-on.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>With a reverberating sound, the two of them collided, only to be repelled at the same time, rebounding against the abyss wall.</p>

  <p>Both were severely injured from the collision. Blood flowed from their eyes, ears, noses, and mouths, yet there didn't seem to be a trace of pain on either of their faces. Beating the wall, they attacked each other again with the added force of the impact.</p>

  <p>Earlier, when everyone avoided the malicious aura on the wall, they gathered in the center of the abyss. Now, the aura affected them greatly, forcing them into a state of frenzy, stimulating bloodthirsty fights.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to tear you apart!" another one of the ogre martial artists roared and caught a woman of the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>But this woman wasn't weaker than him— she had the firmness of will.</p>

  <p>Although she was also affected by the malicious aura, she didn't allow herself to lose her reason. She was concentrating on keeping herself stable when the frantic ogre picked her up without giving her a chance to defend herself.</p>

  <p>Compared to the robust and burly ogre, the woman was all too slender— she couldn't escape his grip.</p>

  <p>If the ogre used even the slightest bit of strength, the woman would probably be torn in half.</p>

  <p>Currently, all the martial artists were either in a frenzied state or bitterly supporting themselves. There was no one to save her.</p>

  <p>Just as the ogre was about to use his strength…</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>With a flash of black light, his head seemed to explode into a mere spray of blood, leaving only his strong body.</p>

  <p>From a distance, Zheng drew his longbow, his expression as indifferent as ever.</p>

  <p>The lives and deaths of the martial artists of the three sacred places had nothing to do with Zheng, but the Demon Night martial artists were Xun's subjects. Even without her asking for his help, at the very least, he held a better opinion of the Demon Night as opposed to the ogres.</p>

  <p>While Zheng's mind was still clear, it didn't mean that he was immune to the malicious aura.</p>

  <p>In fact, just as he came in contact with the red specks of light, his heartbeat began speeding up— he started sinking into an indescribable manic state.</p>

  <p>The malicious aura was simply too fierce.</p>

  <p>If only there was one with a genuinely pure heart without the slightest intention to kill. Only such a person's state of mind would be left undisturbed by the red specks of light, no matter how much malicious aura they contained.</p>

  <p>Children, for instance, knew little about life. If they absorbed these specks of light, they wouldn't be affected at all. In their eyes, the world was still pure.</p>

  <p>But martial artists grew up with the normalcy of slaughter.</p>

  <p>Even though Zheng wasn't fond of killing all the way, he still held killing intent in his heart. When the malicious aura entered him, it enlarged the hint of killing intent dramatically. The more malicious aura he absorbed, the fiercer his killing intent became.</p>

  <p>But the effect of the malicious aura on him lasted for a very short time.</p>

  <p>After that, he managed to deposit the aura he absorbed straight into the Killing Sword Mountain.</p>

  <p>When he first entered the Killing Sword Mountain, he stabbed his sword into the mountain, establishing a connection with the place.</p>

  <p>With that, he could store all of the malicious aura into the mountain, or opt to take it away. But because he hadn't fully mastered the killing way of sword skills, he seldom used the malicious aura after returning to the Central Region.</p>

  <p>With such an ability, Zheng didn't fear the endless flow of malicious aura— it would have no real effect on him.</p>

  <p>Still, he wasn't certain how much of the malicious aura the Killing Sword Mountain could contain.</p>

  <p>Since he learned the Gods-intimidating Strike, he began to re-examine the mountain. Until then, he had not been able to fully unleash the strike.</p>

  <p>No matter how hard he tried to learn more about it, it only became clear how something was missing— like a jigsaw puzzle, Zheng couldn't find the last piece to complete the picture.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lord Sword was the master of the Killing Sword Mountain. Perhaps, the most important secret of the strike lay right in the heart of the Killing Sword Mountain.</p>

  <p>Many martial artists grappled at each other as they fell down. From a distance, they looked like moths circling in the sky, constantly colliding into each other without a care.</p>

  <p>In less than five minutes, apart from the ogre martial artist whose head had been blown off by Zheng's arrow, a Demon Night martial artist, along with two human ones, had also been killed.</p>

  <p>Though Freya had bitterly endured the malicious aura accumulating within her body, she hit her breaking point and finally lost herself.</p>

  <p>Her brown pupils turned blood-red. With a wave of her hands, ten thin and long ice blades grew from the tips of her fingers.</p>

  <p>"You… Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>In a frenzied state, martial artists attacked the persons closest to them.</p>

  <p>Since Zheng stayed by Freya's side, he became her first target.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>As Freya's fingers danced like flying shuttles, transparent ice blades flew toward Zheng.</p>

  <p>Facing the attack, Zheng could only smile wryly. Then, with a wave of his fists, streams of fist radiance appeared.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>The first radiance erupted, immediately shattering the ice blades.</p>

  <p>As he countered, he managed to move closer to Freya.</p>

  <p>With her current strength, she couldn't injure Zheng at all. When he got within range, he reached out to grab her.</p>

  <p>As Freya had fallen into a frenzy, her fighting instinct had been stimulated to the extreme by the malicious aura. She struggled, twisting her waist and kicking Zheng's chest as much as she could. In a flip, two ice hairpins appeared in her hands and pierced toward Zheng's ears.</p>

  <p>In some ways, malicious aura was rather beneficial to martial artists. It could stimulate their fighting instinct to the absolute limit. The strength Freya was displaying was at least thirty percent better than usual. Such attacks would be difficult for ordinary martial artists to guard against.</p>

  <p>But Zheng was strong enough to resist. A faint smile still rested on his lips as he tilted his head back to avoid the two ice hairpins Freya had whipped out with the intent to kill him. When she crossed her hands, he grabbed onto her slender arms with a single hand and pulled her toward him.</p>

  <p>Even with her hands restrained, she didn't give up resisting. Instead, she twisted her hands in another attempt to break free from Zheng's grasp.</p>
