<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It was not easy for all of the members of the Oneness Sky Palace to relocate to another place. To do so in only one day was virtually impossible.</p>

  <p>Within this short period of time, only some of the core disciples and royal members could be removed.</p>

  <p>These core disciples were the hope of the Oneness Sky Palace for the future. After all, as long as they survived, hope still remained.</p>

  <p>Several huge flying ships had landed on the sword sects of the seven mountains, and the training rooms were opened by force one by one.</p>

  <p>Those disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace who were still cultivating on the Other Shore were rudely awakened by force. Some disciples who were still in the temple or unable to leave the Other Shore were unceremoniously moved to the flying ships and stacked in rows, like goods to be transported.</p>

  <p>In front of the Phoenix Palace, a huge flying ship had docked, and the disciples of the three sword sects quickly marched onto it, one after another.</p>

  <p>It was not compulsory for the Other Shore Realm disciples to join the migration, but the dire consequences of staying on in the Bloom Divine Province could be imagined. Once the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race invaded the Bloom Divine Province, the chances of anyone surviving would be very small.</p>

  <p>Some of the more stubborn disciples chose to return to the clans of the Clear Lake, and the Oneness Sky Palace did not try to stop them.</p>

  <p>"Disciples of the Land of Sword Grief, step over here," Chaim called, guiding the disciples onto the flying ship.</p>

  <p>Behind Chaim, many disciples, including Feng Ge, were sitting cross-legged.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge was still receiving training in the Soul City, so he couldn't force her to wake up. He had carried her onto the ship and placed her here.</p>

  <p>"I didn't expect to be forced to depart the Oneness Sky Palace so soon..." A disciple of the Land of Sword Grief gazed with reluctant eyes at the river and mountains in the distance.</p>

  <p>The seven mountains were the bed-stone of the Oneness Sky Palace. The Oneness Sky Palace had stood here for countless centuries, but no one had expected they would have to leave it in such a hurried disarray.</p>

  <p>"We will return," another disciple from the Land of Sword Grief muttered.</p>

  <p>"We will return, rest assured."</p>

  <p>They were a part of the high-level reserve forces of the Oneness Sky Palace, and they had faced some real and hair raising situations. The current situation indeed didn't bode well for the Oneness Sky Palace, but as long as they could survive this hard time, they would return sooner or later.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me!"</p>

  <p>Pearce shouted from his midair position, carrying a huge red crystal on his shoulder.</p>

  <p>After the disciples cleared a space for him, Pearce landed on the deck of the flying ship and gently set down the red crystal. A physical body was imbedded in the red crystal, seemingly asleep. It was none other than Eastern Emperor Taiyi!</p>

  <p>This red crystal had an extraordinary history. It had been excavated from the depths of the central rift valley in the Source World. It was known to be one of the hardest materials in the Source World.</p>

  <p>The red crystal could oppose the power of over one hundred thousand divine megatons, which was the equivalent of an all-out attack by an Eternal Realm master.</p>

  <p>After lowering the body of Eastern Emperor Taiyi on the flying ship, Pearce retreated two steps backward and bowed respectfully to Eastern Emperor Taiyi. The red crystal was absorbed into the ship's interior.</p>

  <p>Soon after, another figure appeared in the sky. This was Winchell. He also carried a red crystal and what locked inside the red crystal was the body of Yasamin.</p>

  <p>Just like Pearce, he lowered the red crystal to the deck of the flying ship, and it sank inside the ship.</p>

  <p>Seeing the two strongest warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace being transported here, the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace were muttering among themselves in low voices.</p>

  <p>"Even Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Madam Yasamin have been brought here.</p>

  <p>But where is Zheng?"</p>

  <p>"It is said that Zheng is occupied in the Eternal Scroll Painting and won't be able to return for the time being. Otherwise, we wouldn't have to leave the Bloom Divine Province."</p>

  <p>"Alas, I have an ominous feeling that Zheng will definitely not return."</p>

  <p>Just as these people were discussing this, a woman robed in blue stepped over.</p>

  <p>As she heard their words, her pair of neat eyebrows suddenly twisted, and a fierce light burned in her eyes. "What are you talking about?"</p>

  <p>The woman in blue was none other than Libby, who had returned from the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>The disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace, who were discussing this in low voices, fell silent, and they dared not say anything else.</p>

  <p>Libby had successfully completed her cultivation in the Land of Sword Grief. Due to Eastern Emperor Taiyi's imprisonment on the Other Shore, he couldn't make her the Oneness Governor, but given her strength, she was comparable to the Oneness Sky Palace's Oneness Governors.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, another figure appeared in the sky. It was Athemar who was carrying the last red crystal on his shoulder as he arrived on the flying ship. Zheng was lying inside this red crystal.</p>

  <p>As Libby stared at Zheng inside the red crystal, her eyes darkened.</p>

  <p>She believed without a shadow of doubt that Zheng would definitely wake up.</p>

  <p>However, could the Oneness Sky Palace survive until then?</p>

  <p>After the Oneness Sky Palace reached a decision, they quickly informed the Pear Hill through the Other Shore. The Pear Hill's members also rushed to the Oneness Sky Palace...</p>

  <p>However, due to the attitude of the Nihility race and the Element Spirit race towards Zheng, it was impossible for the two races not to step up and take action.</p>

  <p>They were hard pressed for time. Every second and every minute were of vital importance.</p>

  <p>After placing the three red crystals with their occupants into the flying ship, the seven mountains all sped up.</p>

  <p>After most of the core members of the Oneness Sky Palace had boarded the flying ship, a white light ignited from the bottom of the ship. A long and sharp flute sound reverberated through the ship, and the giant flying ship slowly began to rise into the sky.</p>

  <p>From the other six mountains, other identically huge flying ships also rose ponderously. Soon after, seven giant flying ships gathered into formation and flew towards the west at tremendous speed.</p>

  <p>Inside the Eternal Scroll Painting</p>

  <p>The moment Zheng had stepped into the hexagram array, his form had returned to normal.</p>

  <p>Once he clearly saw everything in front of him, his face suddenly froze. "Is this... the last room?"</p>

  <p>There was no room inside the black mass. The information the fox girl had provided was false!</p>

  <p>All that he could see was a huge and empty space. Zheng was in a corner of this space, standing atop the stone platform of a hexagram array.</p>

  <p>"Primeval Lord of Heaven, are all of the rooms in the big vortex similar to this?" Zheng queried.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven instantly shook his head. "The other rooms are much smaller, but they are similar to what you would expect. Once you enter through the hexagram array, you will find it possible to merge with the bloodline."</p>

  <p>Zheng had also come in through the hexagram array, but he seemed to have entered an unusual place.</p>

  <p>After observing the room from the stone platform of the hexagram array for a while, Zheng finally jumped down.</p>

  <p>The ground was a kind of soft soil, and there was a faintly putrid smell to it.</p>

  <p>Every step he took left a one-inch-deep footprint on it.</p>

  <p>After Zheng had taken a dozen steps forward, a figure only half his height suddenly appeared behind him. It appeared to be a human boy with bangs and a pale face, and he was covered with rotting wounds. He looked as lifeless as a corpse.</p>

  <p>Once he appeared, he walked forward on the footprints Zheng had left. His movements were mechanical and strange. He appeared clumsy when moving his hands and legs. He didn't seem to be human at all when walking and was like a kind of saprophagous animal.</p>

  <p>When Zheng took a step forward, so did he. The two of them moved almost in unison.</p>

  <p>With Zheng's high cultivation base, his spiritual sense was constantly alert, but he couldn't even sense the little boy's movements.</p>

  <p>Zheng walked over a thousand steps, but the small pale-faced boy walked the same amount without showing any strain.</p>

  <p>The little boy's legs were short, but with every step he took, he would float into the air for a short distance, moving ever closer and closer to Zheng.</p>
