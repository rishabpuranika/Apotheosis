<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>In response to such a proposal, Luo Zheng only smiled.</p>

  <p>"Who cares what they say! These trashy people can't spit out anything good!" the cloaked warrior said to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"My fault," said Luo Zheng. Then he said nothing more.</p>

  <p>Ezra's face revealed a trace of sullen anger when he saw the attitude of the two human warriors. He pondered for a moment, then took two steps forward, and approached the two with a sinister smile. "You will regret it!"</p>

  <p>The cloaked warrior immediately raised his hand to cover his nose.</p>

  <p>"Honestly, I'm feeling a little bit regretful now!"</p>

  <p>Ezra looked confused. He then heard the cloaked warrior continue, "Your mouth stinks too much."</p>

  <p>The young ogre lost his composure and now was utterly enraged.</p>

  <p>Standing upright, he roared to his followers, "You guys follow behind these two. As soon as they step out of the city, kill them without mercy!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, young master!"</p>

  <p>After hearing Ezra's order, all of the ogre warriors present immediately surrounded Luo Zheng and the cloaked warrior.</p>

  <p>Two hours quickly passed by.</p>

  <p>Right at this moment, the cyan-colored curtain of light surrounding all the cities of the Illusion Battlefield vanished simultaneously.</p>

  <p>Witnessing this, many warriors rushed out of the cities. What followed then was an endless slaughter!</p>

  <p>"Time's up. Let's go out of the city," the cloaked warrior suggested.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded as the two of them sauntered towards the entrance of the city together.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng stepped forward, he noticed faint red rays of light flying back from the outside of the city.</p>

  <p>These rays of light represented those warriors killed outside the city.</p>

  <p>According to the rules of the Illusion Battlefield, the body of warrior who was dead would return to a city nearby in the form of a stream of light after it dissipated. Soon after, that warrior would be resurrected.</p>

  <p>For most of the young warriors, the Illusion Battlefield was not only a place to compete but also an excellent place to gain experience.</p>

  <p>While Luo Zheng and the cloaked warrior wandered out of the city at their own pace, two squads of ogre warriors were following them behind. They had been ordered by Ezra to kill them the moment they got out of the city.</p>

  <p>However, they didn't know what kind of people these two human warriors were.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to fight with you for the time being," the cloaked warrior told Luo Zheng. The city gates were right in front of them.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter. I can wait," Luo Zheng replied casually.</p>

  <p>"That's good." The cloaked warrior was beaming, very happily.</p>

  <p>Usually, when other warriors dashed out of the city gates, they would either rush towards their targets or quickly leave the city. They were all very alert and would never stay in front of the city gates.</p>

  <p>However, after the two of them stepped outside of the city gates, they still maintained a slow pace as they moved forward.</p>

  <p>The uncaring behavior of these two confused the ogre warriors who were keenly following behind. The ogre warriors originally thought that Luo Zheng and the cloaked warrior would run off in a flash, so they were highly on guard against this move. But the two seemed unmindful of their presence.</p>

  <p>Were they really that confident? Or were they just stupid?</p>

  <p>"Ezra commanded us to kill them. After they come back to life, kill them again! Snatch away all of the Illusion Points from them!" the leader of the ogres said fiercely. As soon as he finished his words, all the ogre warriors scurried towards the two of them.</p>

  <p>At this particular moment, Luo Zheng and the cloaked warrior turned around at the same time. A similar smile appeared on both of their faces. That was the smile of a wolf seeing a sheep.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did not incline to use his sword.</p>

  <p>He merely utilized his chaotic energy to form a wind blade that slowly rotated on his fingertip.</p>

  <p>To these warriors at the Soul Sea Realm, this unremarkable cyan wind blade was like the edge of death.</p>

  <p>Puff! Puff! Puff! Puff!</p>

  <p>To Luo Zheng, the ogre warriors in front of him weren't a flock of sheep, but grasses. They couldn't see Zheng's figure at all, and their lives were swiftly harvested like grasses by him.</p>

  <p>The cloaked warrior put his pipe away. He also didn't use his weapon, only using his bare palms, gently slapping the ogre warriors' heads or chests. Then the sound of bones breaking echoed out. These ogre warriors were like watermelons that were smashed apart by his palms.</p>

  <p>As expected, after an ogre warrior died, his body disintegrated. Soon after, countless yellow light spots and a ray of red light emanated from within his body.</p>

  <p>The ray of red light wrapping around the warrior's soul slowly flew back to the city.</p>

  <p>As those yellow light spots floated away, they slowly gathered around Luo Zheng and the cloaked warrior. These yellow light spots were the Illusion Points of the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>The first stage of the entire Illusion Battlefield test was to rank the warriors by the Illusion Points they gathered.</p>

  <p>When the Illusion Battlefield was in its initial state, everyone had an equal number of Illusion Points, which was only a hundred points.</p>

  <p>The number of one's Illusion Points would be reduced to half after his first death. The initial 100 points would then be reduced to 50.</p>

  <p>If the warrior died again, his remaining 50 points would be reduced to 25 by then. Just like that, his points would continue to be cut in half until not a single bit remained.</p>

  <p>The cloaked warrior had killed five ogres. This was the first time that these five ogres had left the city. And each of the ogres possessed 100 Illusion Points. With their death, the cloaked warrior had gained 250 points.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Zheng had slain six ogres, he naturally gained 300 points. And by adding his own 100 points, he now had 400 Illusion Points in total.</p>

  <p>In unison, a sudden thought cropped up in Zheng's mind telling him his current ranking.</p>

  <p>"Your ranking is the 8, 800, 000, 000th in the whole Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>And within this world, your ranking is 1, 900, 000, 000th." A self-mocking smile swiftly adorned Zheng's face when he heard that. This ranking was too low for him. He never expected that right after the Illusion Battlefield started, the other warriors would go all out like this.</p>

  <p>As for the cloaked warrior, a helpless smile slowly curled up on his lips as soon as he heard his ranking. He was rated lower than Luo Zheng after slaughtering the five ogre warriors.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, the two of them did not care much about this hierarchy.</p>

  <p>The Illusion Battlefield had only just begun anyway.</p>

  <p>The number of Illusion Points contained within these "grasses" was too few, thus making the "sheep" as their next goal.</p>

  <p>They firmly believed that only by eating grasses could a sheep get fat, and only by eating sheep could a wolf get fat.</p>

  <p>While at the same time, all the mighty warriors in the universe were checking the rankings through the pyramids.</p>

  <p>To think that the Illusion Battlefield had only been in effect for less than five minutes.</p>

  <p>Most of the warriors' names were still lying at the bottom of the rankings. But some of the names already were rapidly rising among the list.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and that cloaked warrior stood guard at the city gates after they had killed those ogre warriors.</p>

  <p>Since most of the warriors gathered in the city, the fastest way for Luo Zheng and the cloaked warrior to collect Illusion Points was to guard at the city gates. From here, they could kill outright those who left the city.</p>

  <p>However, the methods they both displayed just now were too ferocious.</p>

  <p>At first, there were a large number of ogre warriors inside the city that were preparing to leave or perhaps still considering whether they should leave or not.</p>

  <p>But in the end, they only witnessed the bloody and intimidating scene outside the city gates.</p>

  <p>This group of ogre warriors that initially flaunted themselves fiercely now looked quite cowardly. With their current strength, they would be slaughtered as soon as they left the city.</p>

  <p>Consequently, all of them were stuck in the city and refused to come out.</p>

  <p>Because the ogre warriors in front were blocking the way, the others behind them were unable to leave the city. As the ogre warriors at the rear end had no idea of what was happening, they began to curse heatedly.</p>

  <p>However, no matter how much the warriors behind them cursed and grew impatient, the warriors in front of them refused to budge. In the end, many of them could only choose to leave through other city gates.</p>

  <p>Observing this scene, Luo Zheng knew that his plan had been foiled. The ogres were no fool. Knowing he and the cloaked warrior were guarding the city gates, they wouldn't recklessly act to let him slaughter them. In the Illusion Battlefield, though their death was not real, they would still suffer by losing part of their Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>As if on cue, the two of them looked at each other helplessly and could only turn away from the city gates. However, the two of them quickly headed in different directions.</p>

  <p>They both knew that there would be a battle between them in the end, but that moment wasn't the right time. They needed to wait for the opponent to accumulate enough Illusion Points before they could set the match.</p>

  <p>The instant Luo Zheng turned his back from the city exit, he had chosen a route that allowed him to advance at a leisurely pace. He was reflecting thoughtfully on how to accumulate Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>It was downright unrealistic to merely stand at the city gates and wait for the warriors to come out. Killing a warrior would only earn him 50 Illusion Points. And by slaying that same warrior for the second time, the Illusion Points that he would only obtain was 25. This was not the appropriate way to accumulate Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>As he mulled over this, Zheng's gaze accidentally landed on a mountain peak a short distance away. After pondering for a few moments, he then leaped onto that mountain peak.</p>

  <p>"I was in too much of a hurry. The sheep have not gotten fat yet, and the wolves have not gotten fat either. I can wait a little longer until the sheep and wolves all get fat," he murmured.</p>
