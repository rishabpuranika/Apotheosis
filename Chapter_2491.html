<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>In a palace of the Heavenly Sword Divine City, Rachelle was relentlessly pacing up and down the steps.</p>

  <p>As someone who practiced the Murdering Godly Way and naturally had a killing intent in her heart, Rachelle often gave off a murderous aura.</p>

  <p>However, after coming to the Sunrest Tree Region, she had been affected by the Truth of Goodwill; her killing intent wasn't able to gather while she was here.</p>

  <p>She despised this feeling and it made her restless.</p>

  <p>"Hey! Can you sit down?"</p>

  <p>Shahn asked impatiently. He was starting to get annoyed after watching Rachelle walk around for such a long time.</p>

  <p>They had sent the True Gods of their respective clans into the debate venue, but they had no way of knowing what was happening there right now.</p>

  <p>They could only wait here for the result, so they were all anxious.</p>

  <p>"I wonder whether Tyrone and the others have succeeded or not. I'm afraid it would still be too difficult to kill Luo Zheng," said Rachelle with a sigh, ignoring Shahn's words and continuing to pace up and down.</p>

  <p>Walton sneered, "Although our warriors entering the debate venue have become smaller by half, they are still the top figures among the top-rank True Gods. Wouldn't it be a piece of cake for them to kill Luo Zheng, a low-rank True God?"</p>

  <p>"Humph, that's so easy to say. It was not that we didn't have a chance to kill Luo Zheng in the Time Sea Forbidden Land. But who killed him? No one!"</p>

  <p>Rachelle said, staring at Walton. "How could you forget the humiliation you suffered within the jade seal so soon?"</p>

  <p>Back when they were in the world inside the jade seal, the lives of so many consummate True Gods had been in Luo Zheng's hands.</p>

  <p>Hearing what Rachelle said, Walton became silent.</p>

  <p>Troy was sitting in a chair with two golden Buddha beads in his metal hand. The two beads were spinning in his hand, and each time they collided, they emitted a faint light.</p>

  <p>Troy slowly said, "Don't worry. The two siblings of the Luo Clan will surely die in the debate venue."</p>

  <p>A trace of doubt appeared on Rachelle's face. Troy had always been calm and collected. If he said that he was sure about something, then he must have a good reason. "How are you so sure?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Shahn, Walton, and the consummate True Gods of the alliance of wealthy clans all looked at Troy.</p>

  <p>"Because Duke will summon the most powerful incarnation of fear in the debate venue," Troy replied with a smile.</p>

  <p>"The most powerful incarnation of fear? What is it?" Rachelle asked anxiously.</p>

  <p>"As you know, Duke wasn't on the Floating Island for a few years. His points in the Arena of Legends have all been cleared up because of this," said Troy flatly.</p>

  <p>Once upon a time, Duke had been well-known in the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>He had ranked first among the top-rank True Gods in the Arena of Legends and had been known as the most qualified talent to become a consummate True God in these years.</p>

  <p>At that time, all eyes had been on him.</p>

  <p>However, a few years ago, he had suddenly vanished, and the Dongfang Clan had announced that he was cultivating in seclusion.</p>

  <p>"Wasn't he cultivating in seclusion? Why wasn't he on the Floating Island?" Rachelle asked in confusion.</p>

  <p>A smile appeared on Troy's face. "He didn't cultivate in seclusion. He entered the Abyss Demon Region instead."</p>

  <p>"He entered the Abyss Demon Region?! Alone?" Shahn was shocked.</p>

  <p>The Abyss Demon Region was a forbidden area. Normally, the Dongfang Clan would invite warriors from the alliance of the wealthy clans to explore the land together.</p>

  <p>Even the first and second stages of the land were very dangerous. And ordinary True Gods could only explore the land in the company of consummate True Gods and top-rank True Gods.</p>

  <p>"No. He was accompanied by several Demi-holy Beings of our Dongfang Clan," said Troy.</p>

  <p>The other consummate True Gods became even more puzzled. Several Demi-holy Beings had accompanied a top-rank True God to enter the Abyss Demon Region? This was unheard of.</p>

  <p>Demi-holy Beings were very powerful, so they could definitely advance to the bottom of the Abyss Demon Region. But it didn't make sense for them to have taken Duke along. At his cultivation base, he would have been nothing but a burden to them.</p>

  <p>But while Walton, Shahn, and the others were staring at Troy in confusion, Rachelle had already figured out what he was saying. With her round eyes wide open, she said angrily, "If that's the case, why did you ask our Mu Clan to send three of our elites to court death?"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Walton was still in a daze.</p>

  <p>Among the consummate True Gods, Walton was the dumbest one.</p>

  <p>"That is to say, Duke will summon an invincible incarnation of fear to kill Luo Zheng," said Shahn calmly.</p>

  <p>"Yeah, it's the fiend named Edmond," Troy said indifferently.</p>

  <p>"A fiend?!"</p>

  <p>When Walton heard this, his face contorted in anger. "Then Gage and Donne aren't coming back, are they?"</p>

  <p>A fiend in the Abyss Demon Region was a monster that even these consummate True Gods couldn't deal with. That meant that everyone who had entered the debate venue would undoubtedly die.</p>

  <p>The rest of the consummate True Gods had equally angry expressions on their faces.</p>

  <p>Only the elites of each powerful clan had been sent to the debate venue.</p>

  <p>These elites were the ones who were supposed to become consummate True Gods in the future. They were the future hope of these clans.</p>

  <p>It was too much to sacrifice their lives like this.</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you tell us about your crazy plan?" a consummate True God complained with dissatisfaction.</p>

  <p>If they had known about the plan before, they would have sent a few scapegoats instead of their elite warriors.</p>

  <p>"If we had sent some scapegoats instead of our elite warriors, do you think the Sword Clan wouldn't have seen right through our plan? We had no other choice but to sacrifice them. Rachelle, your ultimate goal is to kill Luo Zheng, isn't it? That brat will become even more difficult to deal with after two years. You can't even deal with him yourself! You really think Tyrone and the others have a chance of killing him? Don't be naive,"</p>

  <p>Troy explained.</p>

  <p>Rachelle was silent.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was truly a lucky person. She had a strong premonition that it would be impossible for her to kill him.</p>

  <p>In the Time Sea Forbidden Land, she had tried to kill Luo Zheng so many times, but he had narrowly escaped from death each time.</p>

  <p>The Dongfang Clan's plan was probably their best way of ensuring his death.</p>

  <p>"As long as the Luo Clan doesn't get the inheritance in the debate venue this time, we will not have any worries. This sacrifice is worth it," added Troy.</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, a unique aura spread out from the Sunrest Tree.</p>

  <p>The calm expression on Troy's face was replaced by one of surprise and disbelief.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>At this moment, Rachelle felt the invisible binds around her disappear; she was able to gather her killing intent again. "Has the Truth of Godly Way in the Non-combat Zone been removed?"</p>

  <p>"No." Troy shook his head. "The Truth of Godly Way has been diverted.</p>

  <p>The Truth of Goodwill and Malice... The captain of the ship is making a move!"</p>

  <p>"What...what does this mean?" Walton asked with a puzzled look.</p>

  <p>Troy's face darkened. "If no one had succeeded in the debate venue, the captain wouldn't have made a move."</p>

  <p>Troy knew no less about the debate venue than the Sword Clan. He knew that the debate venue was controlled by the Other Shore Realm warrior, but he didn't know how to succeed in the debate venue.</p>

  <p>"You mean someone has gotten the inheritance of the debate venue? Is it one of our people?" Rachelle asked with concern.</p>

  <p>Troy shook his head. "I'm not sure yet. We can only wait for them to come out."</p>

  <p>Even Troy couldn't stand it anymore.</p>

  <p>His goal was simple. He didn't want anyone to obtain the inheritance of the debate venue.</p>

  <p>This result would have a great impact on the Dongfang Clan's next strategy to cope with the situation.</p>

  <p>It had taken the Dongfang Clan a lot of effort to summon a fiend in the debate venue; there was no way things could have turned out this way.</p>

  <p>That was why, so far, he had been absolutely confident that things would go according to the Dongfang Clan's plan. But now, things seemed to be developing in a direction beyond his control.</p>
