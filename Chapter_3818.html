  <p>
</p>

  <p>When the Other Shore creatures went through the horizontal and vertical passageways, they were so focused on the first Evil Orochi that they completely ignored the second one.</p>

  <p>Forgotten by them, the second Evil Orochi changed its direction in a farther distance. Just as the Other Shore creatures turned around the corner of the passageway, they happened to come face to face with the Evil Orochi.</p>

  <p>This sudden meeting stunned some of the creatures.</p>

  <p>"Charge!" Luo Zheng roared with a raised fist.</p>

  <p>He arched his back and used almost all of his strength to charge to the side.</p>

  <p>There was no going back now. The only choice they had was to dash forward.</p>

  <p>It wasn't just Luo Zheng who did that. All the Other Shore creatures were also adamant in fighting their way forward. In the face of death, desperation often gave way to explosive power.</p>

  <p>As soon as they rushed forward, this Evil Orochi dashed towards them!</p>

  <p>It was a silent death attack from the black snake shadow.</p>

  <p>As the two parties were about to collide, the Other Shore creatures couldn't help but look daggers at the Evil Orochi with the hopes that it would at least slow down.</p>

  <p>Egan and Kirk were in the middle of the oncoming group with Luo Zheng following closely after the latter.</p>

  <p>The next moment, Luo Zheng felt a terrifying force hit his body. He was not swallowed up by the Evil Orochi, but he was hit by it. The powerful wave of energy made him spin quickly like a spinning top. It took a long while for him to stop.</p>

  <p>When he stopped, Luo Zheng looked down at his body and was extremely shocked by what he saw.</p>

  <p>The surface of his own painting was covered with cracks, and pain emanated from every single part of his body. There was no denying just how extremely serious his injuries were.</p>

  <p>Because of the wounds he sustained, the Chaotic Source Spirits naturally fell into fatigue. The force of the impact actually exceeded one hundred thousand Jun.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng was still lucky. The same could not be said for the Other Shore creatures behind him.</p>

  <p>Two Other Shore creatures had also been hit.</p>

  <p>These two also cultivated the Myriad Tribulations Body, but they couldn't withstand the terrifying impact and their bodies shattered immediately. All that was left of them were broken limbs strewn all over the ground.</p>

  <p>As paintings in the scroll painting, however, they were not that bloody.</p>

  <p>Those who were even more unfortunate got swallowed up by the Evil Orochi and did not even have time to scream.</p>

  <p>Egan, who stood not that far away from Luo Zheng, quickly checked on him.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng! Are you okay?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng felt the atmosphere grow a bit strange and stifling as everyone's gaze focused on him.</p>

  <p>"I'm slightly injured but I'm fine," he assured Egan.</p>

  <p>Slightly injured? He was slightly injured?</p>

  <p>The Other Shore creatures couldn't help but scoff in disbelief.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore creatures that were able to enter the Eternal Scroll Painting must have cultivated the Myriad Tribulations Body.</p>

  <p>Due to this fact, everyone shared the same threshold in terms of enduring a strike.</p>

  <p>Even though Luo Zheng had obtained a few more Bone Tribulation Imprints than them, and they could only bear eighty thousand Jun of power while he could bear one hundred thousand Jun of power, the gap between them could not possibly be so big.</p>

  <p>The two unfortunate Other Shore creatures behind Luo Zheng earlier were respectively from the Reverse Training race and the Iron Lineage race.</p>

  <p>These two races were famous for their strong bodies. After they obtained the Myriad Tribulations Bodies, their bodies were expected to be much stronger than ordinary Myriad Tribulations Bodies.</p>

  <p>However, they shattered just like that while Luo Zheng remained standing.</p>

  <p>A few cracks littered his body but other than that, he was fine.</p>

  <p>Egan couldn't help but heave a sigh of relief. "That's good then. Let's continue to move upwards."</p>

  <p>The extent of Luo Zheng's strength was a mystery to them and it was Luo Zheng's secret, so Egan naturally did not ask.</p>

  <p>How his physical body remained intact despite that wave of overwhelming force would remain a secret and the Other Shore creatures knew that there was no way Luo Zheng would answer if they asked. Still, that did not mean that it wouldn't be a hot topic amongst them.</p>

  <p>"I heard that absorbing Chaotic Source Spirits is a unique method to strengthen one's physical body in the chaos."</p>

  <p>"I've heard about that too, a long time ago, but it's not really worth mentioning. Those are just creatures from the Chaotic Source Sea in Stage Twenty-two of the Other Shore. Even if they use those creatures to the extreme, they would only be able to withstand ten to twenty thousand Jun of power."</p>

  <p>"Then how was he able to block the Evil Orochi's attack?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. If you want, then why not ask him?"</p>

  <p>Everyone constantly moved and shifted between the horizontal and vertical passageways, slowly moving towards the No-break Maze's exit.</p>

  <p>The space at the exit wasn't very large and everyone grew even more excited as they got closer.</p>

  <p>Nobody had ever passed through the area guarded by the Evil Orochi, so they felt a sense of pride for having accomplished such a feat.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng and several Other Shore creatures remained cautious. There was no way it was going to be so easy, right?</p>

  <p>"Everyone move to the left! The second Evil Orochi is on the other side!"</p>

  <p>The shout came from the Other Shore creature who was half-human and half-fox, guiding everyone towards the next passageway.</p>

  <p>They hadn't noticed the second Evil Orochi earlier and suffered a great loss.</p>

  <p>Since the fox led the way, they naturally followed.</p>

  <p>"Move to the upper right!"</p>

  <p>"Upper left!"</p>

  <p>"Upper right..."</p>

  <p>With the fox's continuous command, everyone quickly traversed the squares as the two Evil Orochis could only slowly twist their heads, unable to speed up.</p>

  <p>"Upper right!"</p>

  <p>"Upper right!"</p>

  <p>"Upper right again!"</p>

  <p>As they listened to the fox's instructions, nobody noticed the corners of her mouth rise and reveal a mocking smile.</p>

  <p>"Eh!" someone remarked when noticing something was wrong.</p>

  <p>"If we keep moving to the upper right, won't we be led farther and farther away from the exit?"</p>

  <p>The exit was located in the middle of the No-break Maze's end. If they kept heading towards the upper right, they would get farther and farther away.</p>

  <p>"How did you lead the way?"</p>

  <p>"Should we change directions?"</p>

  <p>"We should, right?"</p>

  <p>Just as everyone was blaming her, the fox stopped and laughed. "You only noticed now. You're all truly too dull."</p>

  <p>Her words made Luo Zheng and the others frown.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the two Evil Orochis suddenly appeared and blocked their path from both sides. Having bypassed several crisscrossed roads, these two were able to trap the warriors.</p>

  <p>This fox deliberately led them to a dead end.</p>

  <p>Everyone's eyes were heavy with anger as they stared at the fox. "Why did you do that?"</p>

  <p>"Why do you want to harm us?"</p>

  <p>"If you lead us to a dead end, you'll die too!"</p>

  <p>Everyone's faces paled as they stared at the two Evil Orochis that surrounded them. Their fear was also coupled with great puzzlement.</p>

  <p>Why did the fox bring everyone here when she was also an Other Shore creature?</p>

  <p>"In the Grand Plain Stage, is there an Other Shore race whose members are half-human and half-fox?" Luo Zheng asked out of the blue. Silence was the only reply he received.</p>

  <p>Though there were all sorts of Other Shore races in the Grand Plain Stage, there wasn't really any sort of half-human and half-fox race. Could it be that this creature was not an Other Shore creature?</p>
