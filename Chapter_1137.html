  <p>
</p>

  <p>Everyone needed to have a good understanding of the situation in the Feather Holy Sea before they entered it. The divine-level talent had just asked a stupid question by naively thinking that there would be no dangers in the next area.</p>

  <p>All four divine kingdoms had been exploring the Feather Holy Sea for many years, but they still hadn't completely understood it. The biggest hindrance was the many dangers in it.</p>

  <p>However, compared to the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land, the Feather Emperor Secret Land, Mysterious Dream Secret Land and Divine Emperor Secret Land were much easier to explore. Thus, every year the four divine kingdoms explored Feather Holy Sea. They would leave the other three secret lands for their younger generation to explore.</p>

  <p>The powerful masters at Soul Sea Realm and Life and Death Realm wouldn't sit idle once the Feather Holy Sea was opened. They would find a way to enter the most troublesome and most dangerous secret land? the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land!</p>

  <p>Randy said, "The Dragon Lineage Human once used the blood sacrifice to spread the curse, and many of the spirit beasts that were reared in this Spirit Beast Area also suffered the same fate. However, the ghosts of these spirit beasts were still floating in the middle of the area, so everyone must be more careful when entering the Spirit Beast Area."</p>

  <p>Actually, he had already sensed that something was amiss in the Slow Arrow Area. Based on this, he had estimated that the Spirit Beast Area would be more dangerous than before. Even if he was wrong, there was no harm in being extra cautious.</p>

  <p>Everyone nodded and continued to advance forward.</p>

  <p>The Slow Arrow Area was in the chaotic jungle, while the Spirit Beast Area was in a pitch-black grassland. The weeds in the soil were constantly squirming like bugs.</p>

  <p>"Everyone, try to walk at a brisk pace. Don't stop!" commanded Randy as he looked at the wriggling weeds.</p>

  <p>"Why?" It seemed Renzo hadn't learned his lesson. He stepped into the grassland before fully understanding Randy's instructions. The moment he stepped on the grass, the weeds started to wriggle violently, knotting together and forming an obstacle. The weeds were trying to trip Renzo.</p>

  <p>"Is this what Lord Randy is referring to?" Renzo said with a look of disdain. These small weeds actually wanted to trip him? a warrior at the Virtual Tribulation Realm? Warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm were capable of splitting mountains. These were merely some weeds; he ignored them as they were insignificant to him?</p>

  <p>Renzo stomped on the knots, smashing them to pieces.</p>

  <p>However he never expected the weeds to be so tenacious. The thin roots coiled around his legs and tripped him!</p>

  <p>Renzo smiled rather sheepishly. He had indeed underestimated these weeds. But he still believed that they could not do any real harm to him.</p>

  <p>However, just as he was about to get up, the weeds around his fingers wriggled hard and formed many knots that tied his arms to the ground. In the blink of an eye, the weeds had covered his entire body. When seen from a distance it would impossible to find him. Only a small mound was visible. No matter how much he struggled, Renzo was unable to break free from these grassy restraints.</p>

  <p>Randy's figure flashed and a golden red knife appeared in his hand. He moved swiftly through the grassland to get to Renzo. He lightly pressed the sharp knife's edge down and brushed it across Renzo's body.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh?"</p>

  <p>The weeds on Renzo's body snapped into two and he took the opportunity to leap up. Then he brushed the dirt off his body. Now he looked at the weeds fearfully.</p>

  <p>There were many other ways to deal with these weeds. For instance, a martial artist who practiced the Fire Law could activate his life vitality and burn them. Unfortunately, Renzo, Barry and the several others had practiced auxiliary cultivation methods. They were unable to deal with these unremarkable weeds.</p>

  <p>Randy said flatly, "These weeds are called Black Thread Grass, and they are extremely tough! It's not hard to deal with them, however, if we meet the ghosts, we might be in big trouble. Therefore, everyone should try to walk as lightly as possible and not stumble over these things!"</p>

  <p>With that not-so-gentle reminder by Randy, everyone began moving cautiously through the turf.</p>

  <p>There were only a few bare trees on this vast black grassland so one could see far and wide. They gradually left the gloomy Slow Arrow Area behind. They had been chasing the other warriors for a while when they suddenly saw lightning flash and heard the rumble of thunder not too far away.</p>

  <p>"Crack! Boom!"</p>

  <p>Randy's eyes flickered and he commanded, "Let's follow up!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng followed him closely. His eyes were as calm as water when he looked at the violent bolts of lightning.</p>

  <p>When they walked over to take a look, they discovered that the divine-level talents hadn't gone far. At least half of them had stayed there.</p>

  <p>However, these remaining warriors were standing in a circle and it seemed they had surrounded something?</p>

  <p>"This thing is afraid of lightning! All of the martial artists who cultivate the Thunder Law attack it together. Let's kill it!"</p>

  <p>"Strike harder! It won't be able to hold on for very long!"</p>

  <p>"What luck! We found a Ghost Beast just as we entered!"</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng slowly approached the scene, he was able to see more clearly what lay ahead by the light of the lightning.</p>

  <p>It turned out that in the center of the circle was a human-shaped ghost.</p>

  <p>Its arms were stretched out and its movements were extremely slow. It was making strange sounds from its large mouth.</p>

  <p>It was unable to seize a single martial artist around it as it was moving too slow. Those martial artists who were proficient in the Thunder Law kept striking it with the power of Thunder Law.</p>

  <p>Fiona's eyes flashed in anger and she yelled, "Can you stop attacking it?"</p>

  <p>Fredric had accumulated the life vitality in his body, and so a violent purple lightning burst out from his body and shot towards the ghost with a bang. Ghosts feared lightning the most, because it could ward off all evil spirits. As the lighting hit it, the ghost trembled vehemently.</p>

  <p>When Fredric heard Fiona's words, he glanced at her and asked,</p>

  <p>"Princess Fiona, why did you ask us to stop?"</p>

  <p>"This?this ghost looks so vulnerable and weak," she replied.</p>

  <p>"Hahahaha..."</p>

  <p>"Princess Fiona has such a tender heart! She is so adorable!"</p>

  <p>"If I could marry such a woman and make her my imperial concubine, that would be great!"</p>

  <p>The warriors burst out laughing at Fiona's words. There weren't any seniors to supervise them here, so the young men indulged in brash jokes.</p>

  <p>It was during her battle with Luo Luo Zheng that many divine-level talents got to know her personality. She seemed to be full of sympathy for everything.</p>

  <p>It was fine to have sympathy for humans but to feel sorry for the ghost?</p>

  <p>That was unacceptable.</p>

  <p>The martial artists laughed uproariously as they continued to attack the ghost with thunder. Purple, blue and white colored bolts of thunder struck the ghost's body one after another.</p>

  <p>They could obtain many Ghost Beads from the body of the Ghost Beast.</p>

  <p>The Ghost Bead could strengthen the soul and was highly valued even in the Divine Kingdom Continent. How could they give up merely because Fiona asked them to stop?</p>

  <p>"Crack, crack?" The lightning boomed loudly, producing deafening sounds!</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Renzo looked at Randy gloomily. "This Spirit Beast Area isn't as terrifying as you made it sound," he remarked.</p>

  <p>They had suffered a lot in the Slow Arrow Area and almost lost their lives, so when they entered the Spirit Beast Area, everyone's hearts tightened as they recalled Randy's words. But now this ghost, who was being bullied by the martial artists, was completely at a disadvantage, and seemed to be incapable of fighting back.</p>

  <p>Randy smiled helplessly. "The last time we passed through the Slow Arrow Area, it was very easy and smooth, but we had encountered a lot of trouble in the Spirit Beast Area. This time, however, it's the opposite!" he explained.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Fiona was still very unhappy about the ghost being bullied like that, Callan said, "Fiona, you can't stop them. Let's proceed!"</p>

  <p>While Callan was urging Fiona to leave, Renzo, Barry and the several others were reluctant to go, especially Barry, who practiced a particular kind of spirit-related cultivation technique. The Ghost Beads would benefit him a lot. So for a moment, he was in two minds.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the cyan dragon's panicked voice rang in Luo Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>Although the soul of the cyan dragon was a bit dim, he hadn't fallen into deep sleep like Xun's soul. The cyan dragon said, "Luo Luo Zheng! Run! Leave the Spirit Beast Area quickly!"</p>
