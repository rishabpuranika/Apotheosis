<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3185 One Request </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Since Trish knew that Milo was a distinguished guest, she and Carrie had almost immediately busied themselves with the preparations.</p>

  <p>Once everything was ready, Zheng asked Milo and Kate to take their seats.</p>

  <p>Zheng was confused and had no idea what Milo was up to.</p>

  <p>Milo looked anxious as he sat there, fiddling with the green porcelain teacup in his hand.</p>

  <p>Zheng's confusion increased at the hesitation he could read on Milo's face.</p>

  <p>Trish and Carrie also glanced at each other, wondering what this young talent wanted to do.</p>

  <p>It was Kate who broke the deadlock. She knew that Milo was a proud man and it would be hard for him to even ask something of others.</p>

  <p>"We heard you won the first place at the Seven Mountains Meeting. We're here to congratulate you," she said, smiling.</p>

  <p>"Oh," Zheng said, surprised. But he recovered soon enough and said, "Thank you."</p>

  <p>"Besides, there is a rumor that you and Feng Ge have mastered the subsequent chapter of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent," Milo said, his voice solemn yet anxious. "May I have a look at it?"</p>

  <p>Even when seniors like Athemar and Winchell asked Zheng for the Truth Enlightenment, they offered something big in return. The Truth Enlightenment was too important to be given away lightly.</p>

  <p>But Milo was asking Zheng for the chapter as if he had a right to it.</p>

  <p>"Well..." Zheng hesitated for a moment, and then said, "The rumors are baseless. Just wild guesses. As to the subsequent chapter of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, I..."</p>

  <p>Zheng paused, wanting to refuse Milo's request.</p>

  <p>He had already sent out the first one hundred and fifty words. After Athemar and Winchell received them, the announcement would sooner or later be made in the Flow Sword Sect and the Origin Mountain. And then, Milo, who was the most outstanding disciple of the Flow Sword Sect, could get his hands on it immediately.</p>

  <p>But Zheng had barely finished talking when Milo interrupted him, his voice gravelly with emotion, "Please! Please give it to me! I will give you whatever you ask for! Whatever request you make! I know I broke your sword, but I can help you fix it. I'm willing to apologize if I offended you in any way!"</p>

  <p>Trish and Carrie had to cover their mouths to keep from laughing at Milo's display of emotions. They hadn't expected the arrogant Number One talent to beg Zheng for something like this.</p>

  <p>Zheng looked helplessly at Milo.</p>

  <p>"Look, Zheng, if you've really got the chapter, sooner or later you're going to let the public know that, aren't you? We're just asking you to let Milo know about it in advance," Kate said. Zheng could almost hear the shrewdness in her voice.</p>

  <p>Kate had always been well-informed and a good judge of everything. She didn't know whether Zheng had spread the subsequent chapter of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent but she did know that it was very important to the Oneness Sky Palace. Zheng couldn't keep it a secret forever. He would have to make it public sometime.</p>

  <p>Zheng glanced at Kate before turning to Milo. He smiled as he said, "You don't need to apologize for anything. The broken sword has been repaired.</p>

  <p>But I can give you the first one hundred and fifty words of the Truth Enlightenment."</p>

  <p>Milo and Kate were taken aback by Zheng's reply since they had been prepared to be rejected. Not only was Milo not a friend of Zheng, he also had a troubled history with him.</p>

  <p>But Zheng was being generous, something that caused Milo to think that maybe this was a dream.</p>

  <p>"I only have one request," Zheng continued.</p>

  <p>"Please go ahead," said Milo, nodding rather vigorously.</p>

  <p>"Please don't think that you owe me a favor. If we have the chance to stand in a battle ring, please give it all you have. Go all out," Zheng said.</p>

  <p>Milo's eyes lit up. "Of course!" he said excitedly.</p>

  <p>Zheng waved a hand, extracting a piece of white paper from his space ring. He had made ten copies, having anticipated a situation like this beforehand.</p>

  <p>Zheng had a much richer experience than Milo. The two hadn't fought each other openly and officially yet, but Zheng had become much calmer over the years.</p>

  <p>"I have to admit that Milo is still too young. Zheng is much stronger in this regard," Kate muttered to herself after observing the two men for a while.</p>

  <p>She knew nothing about Zheng's background and what he had gone through in his journey to the Source World. On the other hand, Milo had never suffered a blow in his life. He was like a boy, ignorant of the world and worldly affairs.</p>

  <p>Zheng handed Milo the copy and saw the two visitors out. He then told Trish he was going to meet the Su Clan in the Bloom Divine Province. Yudie and the others would have to wait for him here once they returned.</p>

  <p>Trish's eyes lit up at the mention of the Su Clan. She said, "The Su Clan is situated in the Clear Lake in the northern part of the Bloom Divine Province. My hometown is in the Clear Lake. Mr. Luo, I can show you the way to the Su Clan's residence."</p>

  <p>"Show me the way?" Zheng repeated, surprised.</p>

  <p>"Yes. The Clear Lake is a huge place. It will be convenient for you if I can come along. Besides, I want to go home," Trish ended on a whisper.</p>

  <p>Maids of the Flow Sword Sect were not qualified to make requests. But over the past few days, she had observed Zheng and seen that he wasn't rigid with rules. She wasn't scared anymore.</p>

  <p>"Okay," Zheng replied, flashing her a smile.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't need Trish to lead the way because he had decided to take Gant with him. But he didn't have the heart to refuse her, especially since she wanted to go with him.</p>

  <p>And so, Carrie was tasked with informing Yudie and the other women.</p>

  <p>Zheng and Trish went down the mountain together and to the Dragon City.</p>

  <p>They found Gant in the Sword Tower.</p>

  <p>Gant's face filled with joy at the sight of Zheng approaching him. "I hadn't expected you to come down the mountain!"</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled, his eyes twinkling, and said, "I need your help."</p>

  <p>"What is it?" Gant asked, curious as to what could have brought Zheng down the mountain to ask for his help.</p>

  <p>"After the battle in the Blue Cloud City, how have your family been recently?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Gant nodded. "They're fine. I have met my father," he said.</p>

  <p>"Could they activate the Nine Edges Weapon Refining Array again?" Zheng asked, hope lacing his words this time.</p>

  <p>"The Nine Edges Weapon Refining Array is a skill unique to our clan. We can activate it again because we can't and won't abandon it ever," Gant said with certainty.</p>

  <p>"I need their help in refining something, and I'll pay all their costs," said Zheng.</p>

  <p>'What does he want to refine? Why does he need the Nine Edges Weapon Refining Array?' Gant thought, confused. But he could not refuse Zheng's request.</p>

  <p>The Su Clan would not activate the Nine Edges Weapon Refining Array easily, but Zheng was rich enough to be able to pay them, which was why Gant had so readily agreed to it.</p>

  <p>Once they were ready, they headed straight for the giant transmission array at the northern corner of the Dragon City.</p>

  <p>When Zheng and Gant had previously gone to the Mountain Viewing Province for their mission, they had used the transmission array for free. But this time, Zheng had to pay for the use of the transmission array because this was private travel.</p>

  <p>Once the guards were ready with the array, a column of light flashed, and Zheng, Trish, and Gant disappeared from the transmission array.</p>
