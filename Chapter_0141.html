  <p>
</p>

  <p>There were many different life energies in the world which had various functions.</p>

  <p>Some of the energies increased strength efficiently, making a person strong enough to overpower tigers and leopards or tear stone mountains down until they were nothing but rubble.</p>

  <p>Some energies improved speed to the point that allowed a person to run a million miles in just a few seconds.</p>

  <p>Considering the refining method each person practiced was different, the colors, shapes, and functions of each life energy were different as well.</p>

  <p>But the demonic life energy found in Luo Luo Zheng had not only swallowed Luo Zheng's purple life energy, but also unexpectedly tried to swallow Vale's life vitality, as it came up and spread over Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>When one pushed hard enough, working to reach nature level, his life energy changed into life vitality which then could be shaped.</p>

  <p>Vale had achieved the level of the Illuminating Soul Realm, and because he practiced the cultivation method named Lotus Scriptures, his life vitality could be shaped into pink lotuses.</p>

  <p>Although the lotuses were breathtaking to see, they were, in fact, deadly and horrible.</p>

  <p>At the moment, it was shocking to see that the demonic life energy had come from Luo Zheng's body and now, was swallowing the lotuses one by one while Vale was using his life vitality.</p>

  <p>The demonic life energy was so quick that it swallowed the bloom the moment its dark purple life energy sparked. First, a crack appeared on the pure lotus, then the crack spread, multiplying until the lotus was covered with cracks, and then the lotus was consumed leaving no remains.</p>

  <p>Within a short amount of the time, the dense layer of lotuses covering Luo Zheng's body was blended into the demonic life energy.</p>

  <p>Once the lotuses were gone, Luo Zheng's gruesome wounds were exposed to air instantly.</p>

  <p>Seeing cracks on Luo Zheng's body, the cultivators at the Hell Mountain recoiled.</p>

  <p>Never before had they seen wounds like his, and they wondered what could cause the skin to break like this.</p>

  <p>In actuality, wounds like his could be caused by the pressure of Vale's lotuses. As heavy as the lotuses were, they pulverized an ordinary person, but the unique manner of Luo Zheng's body protected him so that his skin merely cracked under the overwhelming pressure.</p>

  <p>Too busy with what he was facing now, Luo Luo Zheng couldn't tend his wounds.</p>

  <p>He balled his right hand into a fist, and his fingers of the other hand splayed on his right arm gently.</p>

  <p>"Ogres Shaking the World! It's the first step of Heavenly Ogre Fist!"</p>

  <p>Until now, Luo Luo Zheng couldn't manage the mighty Heavenly Ogre Fist no matter how many times he practiced since he had no demonic life energy in his body.</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng completed his regular studies daily, he read the rare book named, Heavenly Ogre Fist, carefully, until he could recite it fluently.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng thrust his fist, it brought the demonic life energy out with the Ogres Shaking the World punch, and at the same time, he had an epiphany. In that instance, Luo Luo Zheng understood all of the subtleties found in the tome of the Heavenly Ogre Fist without any questions.</p>

  <p>Streams of demonic life energy gathered on Luo Zheng's hand frenziedly, and then Luo Luo Zheng took a step which shook the earth and shattered the black gravels circled around him into fine powders in an instant.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng drew his fist back, and with his other hand still steadying his arm from possible recoil, struck the air.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng thrust the fist towards Vale.</p>

  <p>A dark purple shadowy fist appeared just ahead of Luo Luo Zheng, hovering in the air. As it formed, it grew larger until it was the size of a man and lunged at Vale.</p>

  <p>Vale's eyes widened, never before had he seen such a huge fist of shadow. He realized he had underestimated Luo Luo Zheng before.</p>

  <p>Even though Luo Luo Zheng employed the soul attack method to disorder Vale's mind firstly and then shot the broken flying knife at Vale's head, which almost killed Vale, Vale hadn't taken Luo Luo Zheng seriously, but now, Vale did.</p>

  <p>After all, before this, as quick and deadly as Luo Zheng's attack style was, it hadn't been one that would cause Vale deadly harm, so, he hadn't bothered to be concerned.</p>

  <p>But now, seeing the dark purple shadowy fist, Vale realized that this young man could reach high levels through inner strength.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng could swallow the lotuses, manifesting them into his life energy, using them to retaliate when he was about to be finished, and all while exuding nothing but a calm and lucid exterior. Vale had to acknowledge, that Luo Luo Zheng did much better than most people in the world!</p>

  <p>What frightened Vale more was the power behind the punch.</p>

  <p>Considering that Luo Luo Zheng was on the level of marrow refining and could only gather life energy, it left one to wonder; what method produced a punch that powerful with only life energy? There was also the realization that once he reached the nature level and controlled life vitality, no one would be able to withstand the power from the punch.</p>

  <p>There wasn't time for Vale to dwell on that now.</p>

  <p>Time and again, Luo Luo Zheng surprised Vale. As young and weak as Vale saw Luo Luo Zheng, he felt tense and ridiculous, but took the attack seriously.</p>

  <p>In a flash, the dazzling white beam became much brighter.</p>

  <p>Although Vale didn't move, he threw a punch the same way Luo Luo Zheng had.</p>

  <p>Sparing no effort, Vale fabricated as powerful a punch as possible.</p>

  <p>Such a powerful punch came from the master of Illuminating Soul Realm!</p>

  <p>In midway, Vale's fist collided into the full force of Luo Zheng's shadowy fist.</p>

  <p>'Crash!' 'Crack!'</p>

  <p>Where the two fists met, a terrifying whirlwind formed, snowballing and scooping black gravel in as it spun, larger and more powerful until it slammed into the mountainside.</p>

  <p>All of Hell Mountain shook slightly, and boulders rolled down from the mountainside splashing into the stream.</p>

  <p>Hell Mountain's cultivators were horrified at sight.</p>

  <p>Some houses built alongside the wall were shattered by the stones, leaving rumble. Fortunately, those who practiced hard mastered extraordinary feats and weren't injured even though their houses were destroyed.</p>

  <p>What confused the cultivators though was how a young man at the level of marrow refining could fight a master at the Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>The match was unexpected.</p>

  <p>On the mountaintop stood Yan, and her eyes were filled with surprise as she said, "The power my brother wields in his fist should be so astonishing that Vale has to fight back!"</p>

  <p>The old man at her side nodded and replied, "But Luo Luo Zheng may have spent all his energy blocking Vale's, leaving Luo Luo Zheng too weak to throw a second punch?.But!? Vale has no chance now! Here comes Mu Ning Su!"</p>

  <p>Not far away was Aura's flying chariot, speeding up the mountainside and getting closer to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Your punch is good," complimented Vale smiling as he said, "Such a punch proves you are a worthy foe for me, however? A punch like that consumes almost all your life energy, and you have no strength to throw the second one. Still, it's a great honor for you to be regarded as a competitor, by me, and to die by my fist."</p>

  <p>The human body was just like a cup.</p>

  <p>The higher the level one practiced at, the bigger the cup and the more life energy it held.</p>

  <p>Only at the nature level could the human body be equipped to hold life vitality.</p>

  <p>At the Illuminating Soul Realm, Vale's corporeal body was like a lake and could hold an immeasurable amount of life vitality.</p>

  <p>Throwing his punch had expended all Luo Zheng's demonic life energy and left him like an empty cup. He was exhausted, his face turned pale, and he was a spent force.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!" Vale smiled and shook his fist which had a pink lotus shadow flowering on it.</p>

  <p>In the face of Vale's fist, Luo Luo Zheng stood stoic, showing no sadness or fear.</p>

  <p>Growing up, he read a large number of books, where he learned that whatever situation a person was in, he could be satisfied if he had done his best.</p>

  <p>To Luo Luo Zheng, Vale was a strong opponent, but not one he could defeat, yet.</p>

  <p>As a second punch from Vale came closer, Luo Luo Zheng calmly closed his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Vale! No! Stop!"</p>

  <p>Mu Ning was rushing to Luo Zheng's rescue, but as she just neared, she could only shout when she saw the scene.</p>

  <p>Vale glanced at the flying chariot and Mu Ning. Admittedly he heard her, but he had no intentions on stopping. Instead, without hestitating, he threw the punch at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Do you want to get your entire clan killed, Vale?" Shouted Mu Ning angrily.</p>

  <p>Now the chill in her voice gave her words an icy threat.</p>

  <p>Did he want his entire clan to be killed?</p>

  <p>Vale was mighty now at the Illuminating Soul Realm at such a young age, so it wasn't difficult to realize that he was very promising.</p>

  <p>However, the Wang clan wasn't one of the top seven noble clans.</p>

  <p>If Mu Ning wanted to exterminate the Wang clan, it would be easy for her alone, and she had the Emperor's Token.</p>

  <p>It mustn't be a lie to intimidate him.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning was merely a girl though and couldn't intimidate Vale at all, because, to Vale, she was nothing more than a princess who was unloved by her parents.</p>

  <p>It was what Mu Ning threatened that frightened Vale.</p>

  <p>The Wang Clan was a noble clan, and well off, so, it would be undeserving to be wiped over such a little thing.</p>

  <p>Inches from Luo Zheng's face, Vale's fist stopped, his serious face completely relaxed, and meanwhile, he casually said to Mu Ning, "Your Royal Highness, I was joking around with Luo Luo Zheng, and we were having a friendly competition, so why would my whole family be killed?"</p>

  <p>Aura's tone was cold as she replied, "I think you'd better stop or your family won't be safe and sound!"</p>

  <p>Mockingly, Vale said to Luo Luo Zheng, "You're terrific, but I have to say, now, you are not even fit to see Yan, not to mention to fight me!"</p>

  <p>"Three years," said Luo Luo Zheng holding up three fingers.</p>

  <p>"What does that mean?" asked Vale frowning slightly.</p>

  <p>"In three years, I'll return, defeat you and take Yan from Hell Mountain!" stated Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Vale guffawed boisterously as if he had never heard anything funnier,</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha-ha! Three years... Great! Okay, that's really courageous. I will give you three years. If you cannot defeat me then, you won't take Yan from Hell Mountain, and I'll kill you!" announced Vale as he pointed at Luo Luo Zheng, before flying away. As Vale retreated, pink lotuses dissolved into scattered life vitality, disappearing under the sky.</p>
