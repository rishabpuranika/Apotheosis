<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The long-haired monster was cautious. All it asked was for Yasamin to be kind to Dorothy and raise her properly.</p>

  <p>Also, it had only revealed that their race was cursed. Though they possessed powerful strength, they still needed Dorothy's help.</p>

  <p>As Dorothy grew up, Yasamin grew more and more disgusted with the door.</p>

  <p>She did not want Dorothy to be in danger, so she tried her best to keep the door a mystery and warned her to never open it.</p>

  <p>"As long as Dorothy doesn't open that door, they won't be able to come out.</p>

  <p>Dorothy must have already entered it," Yasamin said in all confidence.</p>

  <p>"But why did the door appear in the Heavenly Thunder Plain?" asked Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess's eyes shot up. "If Dorothy could really enter the door and order the monsters, what would she do?"</p>

  <p>As they heard what the Snake Goddess said, Zheng, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, King Ieuan, and Fuxi all turned to Yasamin.</p>

  <p>Since Yasamin was the most important person to Dorothy, it would make sense that Dorothy would use any means to save her.</p>

  <p>This way, it would be easy to explain the door's appearance in the Heavenly Thunder Plain. After all, the Heavenly Thunder Plain was right next to the Flaming Maple Forest, and the goal of the monsters would have been to save Yasamin.</p>

  <p>Although these were only speculations, Yasamin believed it one hundred percent. She shook her head as she believed Dorothy was a reckless girl.</p>

  <p>Within the Flaming Maple Forest, two creatures quietly observed Zheng and his companions.</p>

  <p>Though they were afraid of Zheng's capabilities, they couldn't run away just yet. Otherwise, the Element Spirit Civilization wouldn't let them off so easily.</p>

  <p>Moreover, they still had the power to defend themselves if Zheng ever attacked.</p>

  <p>After Zheng eventually left the open space in the forest, the three members of the Misty River race hurriedly left as well. They were led by Larkin.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the other creatures and the Eternal Realm warriors discussed and chattered among themselves.</p>

  <p>"That guy's got balls. He doesn't show any respect to Larkin at all."</p>

  <p>"I have a bad feeling about this. Let's just watch the show."</p>

  <p>"What's wrong? If anything, Hawley will probably appear and kill that guy."</p>

  <p>Though Zheng displayed unimaginable power, no one there thought highly of him because Hawley was invincible to them.</p>

  <p>The Misty River race was located south of the Divine River. All in all, it was the most beautiful area in the Flaming Maple Forest.</p>

  <p>After he rushed back, Larkin headed straight to the village right at the center of their territory.</p>

  <p>As the gate of the village opened, he was greeted by a creature covered in black that lay in a large water tank. This was Wheeler, the current leader of the Misty River race and also Larkin's father.</p>

  <p>All sorts of bones were soaked in the large water tank. These bones were retrieved from the Divine River, and their quality was much better than that of the Gold and Silver Bone.</p>

  <p>Melting bones in water and burning bones with fire were the two known body refining methods of the Misty River race.</p>

  <p>However, no fire could be found in the Flaming Maple Forest. Fire was a released energy, which would attract the attacks of the Flaming Maple Forest.</p>

  <p>The previous leader of the Misty River race wanted to make a breakthrough. In his attempt, he traveled beyond the Flaming Maple Forest to try and burn the bones with fire. However, the moment he stepped out of the forest, he was killed.</p>

  <p>"Father, here came an arrogant guy," said Larkin with a gloomy face.</p>

  <p>As Wheeler leaned against the tank, he tilted his head and looked intently at his son. "If he was only arrogant, you would have already killed him by now."</p>

  <p>If Eternal Realm warriors wanted to flourish in the Flaming Maple Forest, they had to be well aware of their strength. They must make sure not to go against the Misty River race, or they would be doomed.</p>

  <p>Zheng was so nonchalant about the Misty River race that it could be assumed he had tremendous strength to back him up. He was not only arrogant, but also strong, which was why Larkin made no move.</p>

  <p>"You already knew it?" Larkin asked in annoyance.</p>

  <p>"There's no need for us to stand up for the Element Spirit Civilization. We benefited from them in exchange for their freedom in the lower reaches.</p>

  <p>The other things have nothing to do with us," said Wheeler.</p>

  <p>Larkin frowned as he heard this. "But that human brat is so damn arrogant.</p>

  <p>How can we swallow all this humiliation?"</p>

  <p>"If I say I don't have the confidence to win against him, would you endure it?" Wheeler shot back.</p>

  <p>Hearing his father's words, Larkin grew speechless.</p>

  <p>He did not expect his father to ever admit weakness, especially to Zheng.</p>

  <p>"You're telling me you can't defeat him? How is this possible?" Larkin shook his head in disbelief.</p>

  <p>Wheeler's tone deepened. "You know, Norris' power was extraordinary.</p>

  <p>Even if I wanted to kill him, I couldn't do it so quickly. That brat... There is no need for us to provoke such a powerful opponent."</p>

  <p>Hearing this from his father astonished Larkin. It seemed that he couldn't retaliate against what Zheng had done to him today.</p>

  <p>Just as he was about to leave, the door of the village was pushed open another time. Behind the door stood a creature from another race. His body was covered with bark-like scars.</p>

  <p>Larkin knew exactly who this was: Abner, one of Norris' followers. He was the second leader of their group.</p>

  <p>As he entered the village, Abner bowed before Wheeler and Larkin. Before he could say anything, Wheeler cut him off, "If the Eye Spirit wants me to deal with that bloke from the human race, you can show yourself out right now."</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, Abner shook his head in disagreement. "The Eye Spirit doesn't want you to make a move."</p>

  <p>Larkin stared coldly at Abner. "Then what are you doing here?"</p>

  <p>"The Eye Spirit wants Hawley to make a move," Abner continued to explain.</p>

  <p>As soon as Wheeler heard this, a light flashed his eyes. Within a second, Larkin grabbed Abner by the collar and said coldly, "You bastard! Do you know what you are talking about?"</p>

  <p>The most powerful member of the Misty River race was not Wheeler. It was Hawley.</p>

  <p>Though Hawley never led the Misty River race, he was still regarded as a legend. It was because of his existence that the Misty River race in the Flaming Maple Forest was well respected.</p>

  <p>It was said that Hawley accidentally discovered a burnt arm in the Divine River. At that time, he was not so strong, so he tried his luck with the river.</p>

  <p>Not knowing where the arm came from, Hawley swallowed it.</p>

  <p>After that, Hawley's strength increased dramatically. This was also the reason the Misty River race ruled over the Flaming Maple Forest.</p>

  <p>"The Eye Spirit wanting Hawley to make a move is stupid and arrogant,"</p>

  <p>Wheeler said. He waved his hand to calm Larkin down. "What do we get in return?"</p>

  <p>Abner smiled, "The Eye Spirit will permit the Flaming Maple Forest to expand southwest by one hundred thousand miles."</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Just then, the big water tank that Wheeler was soaked in burst with a loud bang and water gushed out from the cracks. Larkin shot a look at Abner in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Really?" Wheeler asked.</p>

  <p>"The Eye Spirit always keeps his promises." Abner nodded.</p>

  <p>The Misty River race had only a handful of members and their strength was considered mediocre in the Grand Pure Realm. Everything they had achieved today relied on the Flaming Maple Forest.</p>

  <p>The expansion of the Flaming Maple Forest meant the expansion of their scope of influence.</p>

  <p>To expand one hundred thousand miles to the southwest would be a huge advantage. Then they would be able to reach the boundary of the second realm of Three Purities Stage, otherwise known as the Supreme Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>This was an offer the Misty River race could not refuse.</p>
