  <p>So now, when she heard Randy call out the name "Tianxing Luo," her gaze immediately landed on that person. Granted that two years had already passed and Luo Zheng's face had become somewhat unfamiliar to her, a person's spirit and Mu Ning could not be changed.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the fellow's surname was also Luo.</p>

  <p>'Tianxing Luo?  Luo Luo Zheng?'</p>

  <p>A cold smile suddenly appeared on Marine Bai's face. She slowly walked to the edge of the platform and floated into the air, staring at Luo Luo Zheng with eyes full of hatred.</p>

  <p>When War Emperor York saw Marine Bai fly out for no reason, a strange expression appeared on his face. "Holy Maiden, what are you doing?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Marine Bai turned to him slowly. With a smile, she replied, "Your Majesty, I've discovered something that is really interesting."</p>

  <p>"Something interesting?" War Emperor York's brows furrowed.</p>

  <p>Confusion was evident on his face.</p>

  <p>"Mmm hmm." Marine Bai just nodded and then once again turned to Luo Luo Zheng. Coldly, she said, "Tianxing Luo? Humph, you should be called  Luo Luo Zheng right?"</p>

  <p>Since Luo Luo Zheng had chosen the path wherein he could be easily recognized, he had naturally anticipated that the Holy Maiden would recognize him.</p>

  <p>With that, he had already come up with a few plans.</p>

  <p>He originally wanted to fly into the enchanted barrier in order to challenge Logan. Logan's face was already filled with contempt as he waited for Luo Luo Zheng to come. His thoughts were pretty much the same as the other warriors? because the Harlen Divine Kingdom really had no other mighty warriors, they found and sent a warrior at the middle stage of Virtual Tribulation Realm to challenge him.</p>

  <p>After Marine Bai opened her mouth and spoke, Luo Luo Zheng looked up at her and mirrored the strange look on her face. He then smiled and said, "My real name is Tianxing Luo. Who is ' Luo Luo Zheng' and why do you call me that?"</p>

  <p>Seriousness was written all over Luo Zheng's face. Marine Bai was confused for a while, wondering if she had made a mistake. After all, it had been two years. She was definitely uncertain. But once she carefully looked at Luo Luo Zheng, her eyes were once again filled with certainty. "Luo Luo Zheng, playing dumb is useless. I have never heard of someone called Tianxing Luo in the Harlen Divine Kingdom! I assume you crossed the Chaotic Ocean of Stars after the storms stopped, right? You are really bold!"</p>

  <p>"Miss Holy Maiden, I am from the Harlen Divine Kingdom. Now, I want to challenge the warrior from your York Divine Kingdom. If you are afraid of me defeating him, you can just admit it. I think slandering me like this is pointless and highly inappropriate, don't you think?" Luo Luo Zheng said as he cunningly smiled.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the four emperors were also looking at each other in dismay. As for Randy, an angry expression had already graced his face.</p>

  <p>'Marine Bai is such a bitch! Tianxing is our only hope. Why would this woman suddenly jump out at such a time? I must do something!' he thought. Randy had always been arrogant, but he had always been restrained in front of his elders. It was Luo Zheng's turn to fight and the glory of the Harlen Divine Kingdom depended on Luo Luo Zheng, so how could he tolerate Marine Bai trying to mess everything up?</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Randy came forwards, and said in a cold voice, "Marine Bai, what nonsense are you saying? Tianxing Luo is a warrior of the Harlen Divine Kingdom. He is from the Jade Martial House. If the York Divine Kingdom is afraid of him, just ask Logan to admit defeat!"</p>

  <p>Just as Marine Bai was about to speak, Logan sneered, "Afraid of him?</p>

  <p>Lord Randy, I, Logan Yun, have never been afraid of anyone. Moreover, this guy is only at the middle stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm. I can kill him just with a single stab. Ha-ha!"</p>

  <p>Randy sneered, "Then, could you ask the Holy Maiden to shut up?"</p>

  <p>At that moment, Turner, the emperor of the Harlen Divine Kingdom, said calmly, "Tianxing Luo is from our Harlen Divine Kingdom. Miss Holy Maiden, are you mistaking him for someone else?"</p>

  <p>The secret sect was connected with the human race in the Upper World, and in this world, Marine Bai was its appointed representative. There were so many followers of the secret sect in the four divine kingdoms that even Turner could not reprimand Marine Bai.</p>

  <p>"Mistake him for someone else? That's impossible!" Marine Bai was at a loss. She was sure that this fellow was without a doubt Luo Luo Zheng, and through Master Wallace, she understood Luo Zheng's strength. He was never to be underestimated, and even if his cultivation was at the mid stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm, he was able to kill a warrior at the fourth-grade of Life and Death Realm.</p>

  <p>Even though Logan was known among the warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm to be someone invincible, he might not be a match for Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Miss Holy Maiden, regardless of whether you are mistaking him for someone else or not, I will kill him," Logan said, a confident smile on his lips.</p>

  <p>Marine Bai's face showed a hint of hesitation as she tilted her head slightly. Suddenly, her eyes lit up as she turned to face War Emperor York. "Your Majesty, I'm sure this guy is  Luo Luo Zheng from the Sky Northern Region. He was the one who killed Daniel! If you do not believe me, you can ask Elder Gong!"</p>

  <p>When they entered the celestial tomb, Daniel Liu had a total of five bodyguards at the Life and Death Realm by his side. After learning about the death of his son, War Emperor York was angered and killed the four bodyguards without hesitation. As for Elder Gong, he had been exempted from death because he had performed deeds of valor in the past.</p>

  <p>At this time, Marine Bai could only ask Elder Gong to identify Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Holy Maiden, are you sure this is the person who killed my child back then?" When he heard Marine Bai's words, War Emperor York's originally gloomy face turned even grimmer.</p>

  <p>Actually, Marine Bai's sudden appearance was a bit rash and rude. But according to War Emperor York's understanding, although her personality was a little off, she wouldn't be talking nonsense in such a situation.</p>
