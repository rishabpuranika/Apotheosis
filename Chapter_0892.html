<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 892 A Delicate Situation (Part One) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>The present situation on the Sea God Continent was extremely delicate. So much so that even the Tower of Sin was in a state of utter chaos, and the warriors were panicking hard.</p>

  <p>Since the Cursed Land was filled with all sorts of races, the tower situated there was almost like a mini version of the Sea God Continent itself. In fact, the information one acquired from the Cursed Land was even more valuable and important. Some people even earned their bread and butter by collecting information from the tower and selling it.</p>

  <p>Now, since the humans and the ogres had declared war on each other, the entire Sea God Continent looked like it had been hit by a massive typhoon.</p>

  <p>The Cursed Land itself seemed to be located in the center of that storm, and the Tower of Sin was the very eye of this cyclone.</p>

  <p>Zheng, who was inside the tower at this delicate moment, was very calm. In fact, he wasn't paying much attention to the events occurring outside the tower.</p>

  <p>However, there was still one small problem that he was facing right now.</p>

  <p>He couldn't stay on the tenth floor anymore.</p>

  <p>The Lucky Light he had accumulated from his numerous battles over the last few days had caused Zheng to advance to a second-level war general. His strength was already tremendous and it had increased now.</p>

  <p>The Tower of Sin really was a mysterious place. The pace at which he had advanced through the numerous cultivation levels was several times faster when done by utilizing the Lucky Light.</p>

  <p>This was also the reason why all the races on the Sea God Continent placed so much importance on the Tower of Sin. As long as their warriors were strong enough, they could advance continuously in the Tower of Sin, and at the same time, get sufficient training and practice through battles.</p>

  <p>At Zheng's current training and advancement speed, perhaps it wasn't going to be long before he became a war lord.</p>

  <p>And ever since he had defeated the level two orc war lord, the war generals on the tenth floor had finally come to their senses and realized they couldn't match Zheng no matter how many stones they turned.</p>

  <p>The divine-level talents from all the races were concentrated on the tenth floor of the tower. Although Zheng had defeated Boris and several other powerful warriors too, there were still numerous cultivators who refused to admit that they could not defeat Zheng. That was understandable since they were at the divine level and weren't willing to be considered inferior to anyone else. Apart from these talents, some cultivators who had just advanced from the ninth floor were there too.</p>

  <p>Though the divine-level talents wanted to defeat him somehow, those who had just advanced from the previous floor knew that they weren't a match for him.</p>

  <p>At Zheng's current cultivation base, his opponent should have been a war lord, not a war general!</p>

  <p>But the divine-level talents were willing to battle with Zheng as they would obtain great honor if they managed to defeat him! For that reason, even though they knew that it was impossible for them to defeat Zheng, they still headed towards the arena where they either gave up their lives, or gave up their Lucky Light.</p>

  <p>Then gradually, the tables turned and no one dared to challenge Zheng anymore. With that, he began to get default victories every day, without receiving any Lucky Light.</p>

  <p>After obtaining the default victory for three days, Zheng got the right to enter the eleventh floor of the Tower of Sin. However, he wanted to stay on the tenth floor for a while more right now as he wanted to accumulate more Lucky Light on the tenth floor before entering the next one.</p>

  <p>However, nothing of the sort happened to him even after six consecutive days, and he kept getting the default victory, since no one wanted to fight him on the arena.</p>

  <p>As this was going to be the case, then staying there was a waste of time for him.</p>

  <p>Disappointed, all Zheng could do was to choose to leave the tenth floor and enter the next one.</p>

  <p>By this time, half of the grace period that Zheng had given to the ogres had already passed.</p>

  <p>News regarding their exchange and deal had already spread throughout the Tower of Sin at a gradual pace. Every single race was discussing it openly or secretly.</p>

  <p>Some of the races were even talking about it in a delightful tone. In the past, no other race would have dared to speak out of anger against the ogres even though they had acted outrageously, but now that Zheng was going to expel the ogres from the Tower of Sin, it was definitely a great thing for them.</p>

  <p>Many of the relatively weaker races were sure to clap their hands in joy if they saw the ogres leave the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>As for the ogre members, they were obviously depressed.</p>

  <p>Many of the ogres rarely went onto the arena. They even didn't dare to appear publicly in the Tower of Sin. Each and every one of them was very careful if they ever went out and would even lower their voices a bit while speaking.</p>

  <p>This entire month was going to be very crucial for the ogres.</p>

  <p>If they refused to give in, then the Demon Night, the Purple Heart Sacred Place, and even Zheng himself were not going to go easy on them.</p>

  <p>And if Zheng refused to budge, every single ogre member would have to leave the Tower of Sin, including all of their war lords who were at the top level!</p>

  <p>The moment Zheng stepped onto the eleventh floor of the Tower of Sin, two level three war lords from the ogre race walked up to him.</p>

  <p>"You're Zheng, right? You've finally reached the eleventh floor! Are you interested in competing in the arena right now?"</p>

  <p>"You're just a second-level war general. And you are daring enough to climb up to the eleventh floor. You're really so reckless!"</p>

  <p>The two ogre war lords tried to provoke Zheng into a fight.</p>

  <p>In fact, the ogres already understood clearly that they were unable to defeat Zheng in the Tower of Sin. Even Bradley, the fourth strongest war lord among all, had been instantly killed by Zheng. How could the warriors from any other races be a match for him!</p>

  <p>This meant that there was only one way left for the ogres now, and that was to kill Zheng on the arena.</p>

  <p>That was just the way ogres were. Even though they weren't strong enough to stand up against Zheng, they were still willing to fight him to the death. In addition to Boris, there were lots of other tenth-level ogre war generals on the tenth floor of the Tower of Sin too.</p>
