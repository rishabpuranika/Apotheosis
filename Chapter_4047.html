  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Night View Island was rather peculiarly named. Whoever didn't apply the Ghost Powder on this island would die at night.</p>

  <p>As those strangers knew nothing, they would have been eaten by the white-haired monsters last night.</p>

  <p>"I'm wondering how many Arcana were left," Graham thought out loud with eyes shining with greed.</p>

  <p>Over the past few years, because of the appearance of the Evil Tiger race, the west path of the Wooden Leaf race had been cut off. As a result, hunting had become more and more difficult as time had passed. These strangers could not have come at a more fortunate time.</p>

  <p>Graham hadn't slept a wink last night and had been hiding in his cave in fear. But now, it was time to harvest.</p>

  <p>"They are humans," Decker said with a strong desire in his eyes. "And what's more, they are quite strong when you think about it. I think the white-haired monsters must have left a lot of Arcana!"</p>

  <p>The two of them called the other soldiers of the Wooden Leaf race and then climbed up the stairs at the side of the mountain.</p>

  <p>Although both Decker and Graham sincerely believed that Luo Zheng and his companions had been devoured completely, they still had to be prepared for any unexpected situations that might arise.</p>

  <p>The Wooden Leaf race was very good with bows and arrows. The soldiers held simply wooden bows in their hands, but the arrows were cyan black and poisonous. These arrows were known to be incredibly toxic. That was the sole reason the seemingly weak members of the Wooden Leaf race had survived so long.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, they had climbed the mountainside and arrived at the cave.</p>

  <p>Decker signaled to the crowd. They held their breath and approached quietly.</p>

  <p>The soldiers were walking gingerly and slowly approached the side of the cave. Decker was the first to poke his head into the cave, and he was extremely careful in doing so. But there was nothing and no one in it.</p>

  <p>Chances were, those humans had been eaten up by the white-haired monsters. Decker had already expected this outcome. He felt more relieved and then looked to the ground.</p>

  <p>If those humans had been completely annihilated, then there would be a lot of things left behind there.</p>

  <p>Decker's eyes swept over the ground, and his pupils suddenly shrank. He was staring at the center of the cave, where only four glazed crystals were sitting sadly.</p>

  <p>"So few?" Decker narrowed his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Not even half a dozen crystals?" Graham frowned.</p>

  <p>Decker walked in and picked up the glazed crystals on the ground.</p>

  <p>Normally, after the white-haired monsters had devoured their prey, Decker and his companions could obtain at least ten glazed crystals. If those humans really had been eaten up by the white-haired monsters, then there should be at least a hundred glazed crystals lying on the ground.</p>

  <p>But there were only four here! Only two possibilities could explain this.</p>

  <p>The first one was that the humans were still alive, or it could be that the glazed crystals had been stolen.</p>

  <p>A bad feeling rose from the bottom of Decker's and Graham's hearts.</p>

  <p>They were sincerely hoping that the second option was the right one.</p>

  <p>If those humans were still alive, then Decker and company were in deep trouble.</p>

  <p>As the two of them pondered over the mystery, they suddenly felt the leaves above their heads become extremely heavy. The leaves were quickly turning red.</p>

  <p>The members of the Wooden Leaf race had a talent quite similar to what the Augury Dog had, in the sense that they could predict danger in advance.</p>

  <p>And perhaps it was because they were good at archery, their talent was also more practical than that of the Augury Dog. They could sense the presence of their enemies from a distance. This complemented their archery skills since arrows could kill from a distance.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, their enemies were rather close this time.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and his group were hiding in the cave, but they were covered with a layer of skin from Sawyer's treasure, known as the Magic Camouflage Skin.</p>

  <p>It could change into any form and color.</p>

  <p>The moment Sawyer removed the Magic Camouflage Skin, Luo Zheng reached out his hand and grabbed the bow in Decker's hand.</p>

  <p>Decker's reaction was also incredibly fast. He raised his hand and was about to shoot an arrow at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The other warriors of the Wooden Leaf race also followed suit. Bows and arrows were their weapons of choice, and operating them was in their instinct. Therefore, their reaction speed and accuracy were both very high.</p>

  <p>However, this time, something unfortunate happened. Before Decker or anyone else had a chance to let an arrow fly, a thin strand of spider thread was wrapped around their arrows.</p>

  <p>And when they were about to shoot, the spider thread pulled the arrows away in one direction. The soldiers of the Wooden Leaf race could do nothing but stare at their bows in confusion.</p>

  <p>Crack! Just two of Luo Zheng's fingers pinched Decker's bow and crushed it with a gentle force.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>The bows of the other members of the Wooden Leaf race shared a similar fate.</p>

  <p>Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and the Eternal Realm Hunters also made their moves and crushed the long bows of whoever was nearest.</p>

  <p>The Wooden Leaf race was quickly detained.</p>

  <p>"You, you... What do you want?" Decker's face turned pale.</p>

  <p>"Friends from afar, why are you doing this to us? Have we been ungracious hosts to you?" Graham asked in a calm tone.</p>

  <p>As the patriarch of the Wooden Leaf race, he was much calmer than Decker in times of crisis.</p>

  <p>However, his calm was immediately lost when he heard the unmistakable crack of bones breaking into two!</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The warrior behind Graham had tried to pull out his short sword and attack Pearson in secret, but his neck was immediately broken. His large head rolled to a side, and the sound of spurting blood could be heard coming from the cave.</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish! Swish!</p>

  <p>Silver threads wrapped themselves around the necks of Decker and all his friends. And these were not as fragile as ordinary spider threads.</p>

  <p>Instead, they felt as sharp as sword blades.</p>

  <p>Pearson's cold eyes were full of killing intent now. "Stop talking nonsense.</p>

  <p>And don't try any unnecessary flattery, or you will die immediately."</p>

  <p>"How dare you..."</p>

  <p>Crack! Sizzle! Sizzle! Sizzle!</p>

  <p>Another soldier of the Wooden Leaf race was about to threaten Pearson, but the latter immediately moved his finger and the sharp thread cut off the soldier's neck before he could complete his sentence.</p>

  <p>As his detached head fell to the ground, so did a cold silence in the cave.</p>

  <p>Not a single soldier of the Wooden Leaf race dared to say anything now.</p>

  <p>Pearson was gazing at them fiercely, but they did not even dare to look into his eyes.</p>

  <p>The man's intention had been to catch Decker and torture him cruelly yesterday.</p>

  <p>Although the method that Luo Zheng and the others proposed could also achieve his goal and was more secure, it was too troublesome in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Graham and Decker had initially planned on struggling, but now, they completely gave up.</p>

  <p>Without further ado, Luo Zheng took out a glazed crystal and placed it in front of Decker. "What is this?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Decker rolled his eyes, but Pearson threatened, "Answer him now, or you will die."</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, the silver threads wrapped around Decker's and Graham's necks magically tightened themselves. The sharp threads cut into their flesh, and blood quickly seeped out.</p>

  <p>"It's an Arcanum!"</p>

  <p>"It's an Arcanum!"</p>

  <p>Decker and Graham cried out simultaneously.</p>

  <p>"Very good." Pearson waved at Luo Zheng and said, "Go on."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and the others were a little confused when they heard this strange name. Luo Zheng continued the interrogation, "What's the use of this Arcanum?"</p>

  <p>"It gets its name from the fact that the Treacherous Beings like it very much. If we accumulate enough of this, we can easily subdue them by distracting them," Decker explained.</p>

  <p>"Is that all?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Decker hesitated, but trembled when his eyes met Pearson's. He quickly replied, "No. If you refine it, you can coexist peacefully with several Treacherous Beings without having to worry about subduing them. You can also turn them into your own weapons and even a part of your body. Then you would be half human and half Treacherous Being."</p>
