<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Let her go!"</p>

  <p>Zheng shouted, his entire aura going icy cold.</p>

  <p>He had undergone so much hardship and exerted unimaginable effort in trying to find his sister. He travelled through the great world, the Upper World, and even the divine land. It was only recently that he was finally able to reunite with his sister.</p>

  <p>There was no way he was letting Yan get kidnapped ever again.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The Sword Clan's flying sword rotated and fell onto Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>There was no longer any hesitation on his face.</p>

  <p>"You are so childish! Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>Atlas felt Zheng's remarkable momentum but did not feel the least bit afraid.</p>

  <p>His opponent was a mere low-rank True God and there was no way he was going to take him seriously.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Atlas raised his hand and gathered bolts of lightning in his hand.</p>

  <p>He was the incarnation of thunder and already had a consummate understanding of the Thunderstorm Godly Way.</p>

  <p>There was nothing special about his bolts. However, they were extremely powerful.</p>

  <p>Fuzz!</p>

  <p>The bolts in his hand condensed into a sharp, thunderbolt awl.</p>

  <p>"It's so powerful!" Reinhard exclaimed. "Even Master Ivan wouldn't be able to defeat him with the Thunderbolt Sword. Who exactly is this guy? Whose incarnation of fear is he?"</p>

  <p>There was a big gap between the consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>Atlas himself was destined to be the top existence among warriors who reached consummation of True God Realm.</p>

  <p>In the past, any wealthy clans on the Floating Islands already sent several consummate True Gods after him but none succeeded in bringing him down. Only a Holy Being managed to succeed in sending him into chaos.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The thunderbolt awl in Atlas's hand came straight for Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng fiercely waved his sword in the face of such a powerful thunderbolt awl.</p>

  <p>The moment he sent out that strike, all emotion disappeared from his bloodshot eyes.</p>

  <p>In the past, this sword skill of his, taught to him by Supreme Lord Sword, was called the Gods-intimidating Strike.</p>

  <p>But he was a True God now.</p>

  <p>It wasn't really appropriate to call it by its old name anymore.</p>

  <p>During the two years he spent in the fairy palace, Zheng continued to practice and hone his sword will.</p>

  <p>The Emotion Closing Godly Way released under the state of the Ripping Consciousness was terrifying, but it was far from enough.</p>

  <p>Two years ago, in the Time Sea Forbidden Land, Zheng saw that faint figure merged three thousand Godly Ways together inside the Divine Time Temple.</p>

  <p>After fusing the three thousand Godly Ways, the energy he obtained was indeed extremely powerful.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, when Zheng himself practiced it, he found that the fierce energy was uncontrollable and could lead to him exploding if he wasn't careful enough.</p>

  <p>However, after cultivating the Truth of Cultivation Nature, Zheng finally found the key to wielding such power.</p>

  <p>Nature must be allowed to take its course.</p>

  <p>Three thousand Godly Ways were used to utilize three thousand kinds of energy.</p>

  <p>These energies were complex, as were the Godly Ways. Even the energies contained within the Godly Ways themselves could combine or restrict each other. The Five Elements Godly Way, for example, was originally the combination of five contradictory energies.</p>

  <p>But to combine all three thousand?</p>

  <p>It was impossible!</p>

  <p>However, despite being so different, the Godly Ways, in fact, all led to the same destination.</p>

  <p>When Zheng used the Truth of Cultivation Nature and combined it with three hundred kinds of Godly Ways, he did not interfere and simply let all of them run their course.</p>

  <p>Some Godly Ways were devoured.</p>

  <p>Others merged with each other.</p>

  <p>Most collided until finally merging and finding a suitable state.</p>

  <p>It was only after careful trials that all three hundred became one.</p>

  <p>The result was a very complicated energy.</p>

  <p>Zheng had no idea whether this kind of energy had ever appeared in the divine land but he definitely knew he made the right choice.</p>

  <p>The instructions from the Divine Time Temple were certainly correct.</p>

  <p>He had never really used this method before.</p>

  <p>The Emotion Closing Godly Way was considered a forbidden way. Using it at will could get him into trouble and there was no way he'd be able to use it in the Sword Clan.</p>

  <p>However, seeing Yan get taken away again made something snap inside of him.</p>

  <p>Therefore, he went all out with this strike.</p>

  <p>As this method was the blending of all the Godly Ways, Zheng came up with a name.</p>

  <p>"Emotion Closing--Ways-blending Strike!"</p>

  <p>The surface of the Sword Clan's flying sword glowed a magnificent color.</p>

  <p>The merging of the Godly Ways eliminated all wild energy and transformed it into pure power.</p>

  <p>Thus, Zheng swung his sword.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>As the tip of his sword touched the thunderbolt awl, a loud explosion was heard.</p>

  <p>Fizz! Fizz!</p>

  <p>Needless to say, the thunderbolt awl was completely annihilated by Zheng's Ways-blending Strike.</p>

  <p>The moment the light disappeared, so did the thunderbolt awl.</p>

  <p>"What? This is..."</p>

  <p>Atlas originally thought his thunderbolt awl would've been more than enough to kill Zheng.</p>

  <p>There was no way he would take any of the top-rank True Gods seriously, much less Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, he would think more, compared with the ordinary incarnations of fears.</p>

  <p>He hadn't attacked before because he wanted to find the secret in this mist-filled world.</p>

  <p>Since this low-rank True God wanted to die though, then he had no choice.</p>

  <p>Atlas threw a thunderbolt awl containing sixty-percent of his power. To his surprise, however, it was easily destroyed by a low-rank True God.</p>

  <p>What the hell was going on?</p>

  <p>Reinhard and the guy with soybean-like eyes were stunned.</p>

  <p>The appearance of a consummate True God made both of them feel powerless.</p>

  <p>If the top-rank True Gods cooperated with their avatars then it was possible for them to deal with the Multiple Antennae Snake.</p>

  <p>However, a mature consummate True God was a different story.</p>

  <p>That thunderbolt awl was enough to end Zheng.</p>

  <p>That meant Yan was going to be taken away again.</p>

  <p>Such an outcome would have led to the failure of the entire mission.</p>

  <p>Even Reinhard saw no hope.</p>

  <p>However, the entire situation was turned around by Zheng.</p>

  <p>Who would've thought that this young man would easily dissolve a consummate True God's attack?</p>

  <p>Moreover, the strike he used to counter Atlas's thunderbolt awl wasn't anything he'd ever heard of before.</p>

  <p>As he and the soybean-eyed guy were still comprehending what just happened, Zheng was already on his second strike.</p>

  <p>"Ways-blending Strike!</p>

  <p>Die!"</p>

  <p>He swung his sword once again, directing it towards Atlas as it shone with a dazzling light.</p>
