  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng still felt the chances were slim.</p>

  <p>The famous doctor, Zaine Xue, had already examined Yudie and proclaimed that she was not injured, nor did she harbor any kind of disease.</p>

  <p>Her life energy was just depleted and left her in a vegetative state, like a wilted flower.</p>

  <p>There was no way one could bring a wilted flower back to life. However, Zheng was not going to give up.</p>

  <p>Yudie was also struggling with her life, and he had no right to give up on her.</p>

  <p>Many disciples of Cloud Hall had already returned to Cloudy City through the transmission array. Since Yudie's condition made her unable to take charge of the sect's affairs, the elders agreed to have Zheng become the interim leader for the time being.</p>

  <p>It was a very suitable arrangement. After his victory against Eddie, Zheng was now the number one warrior in Central Region. It would be to Cloud Hall's advantage to have such a strong person in charge of its affairs.</p>

  <p>Zheng, however, refused.</p>

  <p>He had no intention of taking charge and, after the defeat of the Heavenly Evil Sect, he was sure that both the Cloud Hall and the World Commercial Alliance would now reign supreme in the Central Region with or without him as the leader. Besides, he had other important matters to attend to.</p>

  <p>Still, there was a need to appoint a leader for Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>In the end, Zheng chose Saint Morphens.</p>

  <p>The battle with Eddie left Saint Morphens with a few injuries after he had taken a punch from him. It had taken him a few days to recuperate, but he was now as good as new. It made sense to appoint someone like him since Saint Morphens had served as Yudie's close confidant. Zheng was at ease with him taking charge of Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>Zheng remained by Yudie's side.</p>

  <p>She was like a sleeping beauty that showed no signs of ever waking up.</p>

  <p>He would sit beside her most of the time to cultivate. When he wasn't cultivating, he'd comfort himself by quietly staring at her sleeping face all day long.</p>

  <p>During this time, the World Commercial Alliance had already spread the news throughout the entire Central Region.</p>

  <p>Their influence reached even the remotest areas of the Central Region. This was thanks to their monopoly of life vitality crystal trade and circulation in the entire Central Region.</p>

  <p>The population of the entire Central Region was abuzz with discussion.</p>

  <p>"I heard the bounty was a low-grade sacred weapon plus a thousand supreme life vitality crystals."</p>

  <p>"Isn't that too high? Most ordinary third-grade sects don't even possess those things."</p>

  <p>"Third-grade sects? Are you dreaming? Even a fourth-grade sect would kill for just one sacred weapon. They're spending so much just to save an already dying girl!"</p>

  <p>"Are you kidding me? She's not just some random girl. She's the leader of Cloud Hall! For someone at the Life and Death Realm, the price can't be described as too high."</p>

  <p>"My family has an ancestral pill formula that can bring one back from the dead and even extend their lifespan by dozens of years! I'd like to give it a try."</p>

  <p>"Don't talk nonsense! You'll just end up embarrassing yourself. All the top pill refiners are already gathered in the World Commercial Alliance. Do you think they'll take a fancy to your pill formula?"</p>

  <p>The attractive bounty had all sorts of people rushing into the World Commercial Alliance to present their "treasures."</p>

  <p>However, it was true that the World Commercial Alliance was already abounding with capable people.</p>

  <p>Most of the people that came were swindlers. Those who presented their magical pills and techniques paled in comparison to the members of the World Commercial Alliance.</p>

  <p>It seemed Yudie's problem was really something that couldn't ever be solved.</p>

  <p>Half a month had passed after the offering of the bounty. It was at that time that a beggar, dressed in rags, entered Oracle City.</p>

  <p>The beggar arrived in front of the World Commercial Alliance's headquarters and claimed that he had a way to treat Yudie.</p>

  <p>The guards from the World Commercial Alliance had no patience to deal with the beggar. All sorts of people had already dropped by to offer their remedies, but none had ever been useful. Naturally, one of them chased the beggar away.</p>

  <p>However, the beggar did not leave and instead inquired about Yudie's residence.</p>

  <p>It was not a secret that both Zheng and Yudie were temporarily staying in a palace in Oracle City which was specially allocated by the World Commercial Alliance.</p>

  <p>The beggar easily managed to get this information and found the location of the palace. He once again patiently explained his purpose to the guards of the palace.</p>

  <p>He was also sent away. Left with no other choice, he girded up his loins and actually jumped over the wall.</p>

  <p>He had a nature-level cultivation. Perhaps wandering around as a beggar had been his method of cultivating.</p>

  <p>Not long after he trespassed the palace walls, he was discovered by the warriors that guarded the inside.</p>

  <p>The palace's defenses were not poor. Its walls were filled with one-star runes that, when activated, would emit sharp chirps signaling the entry of an intruder.</p>

  <p>After the beggar triggered these alarms, it consequently attracted the attention of the guards.</p>

  <p>The guards made quick work of surrounding the beggar.</p>

  <p>Ever since the World Commercial Alliance spread the news, tens of thousands of people entered Oracle City in droves. Although most of the applicants who claimed they could help Yudie had been screened beforehand, there were still a large amount of people who managed to step into the palace.</p>

  <p>Every single person who entered the palace gave Zheng a glimmer of hope, but he always ended up disappointed.</p>

  <p>However, he could not refuse to see them. What if the next person who came was the one who could help Yudie? He was not willing to take such a risk. Even if it was by a minuscule margin, he had to give that person a chance of saving her.</p>

  <p>"It's a pity the chirps disturbed your sweet dream," he joked, gently stroking Yudie's hair. He would've been happy if the chirps had indeed disturbed her and woke her up, but she remained fast asleep.</p>

  <p>At that moment, a loud noise burst from outside.</p>

  <p>"Hmm? What happened?" He frowned as he stood up to see the source of the commotion. Who would ever dare barge into his palace?</p>

  <p>Outside, he heard a guard shouting, "You dare trespass into the Heavenly Stellar Palace? You must be courting death! Take this person down and send him to prison!"</p>

  <p>His guards surrounded a tattered-looking beggar.</p>

  <p>As a powerless vermin who was only at the nature level, the beggar could only stammer in front of the guards, "I...I've come to offer my treasure to Master Ning!"</p>

  <p>"Treasure? You? What a joke!" a guard said coldly. "Take him away!"</p>

  <p>Realizing that they would never believe him, the beggar took out a tattered sack of cloth and held out a piece of ancient jade. "This ancient jade was left behind by an immortal and has the ability to restore a person's life energy. I heard that Master Ning's life energy has been exhausted. This ancient jade of mine is definitely useful!"</p>

  <p>"Fuck off!" the guard spat. How could he ever listen to the ramblings of a beggar? There were just too many swindlers in Oracle City nowadays. The guards had naturally gotten tired of listening to these kinds of gimmicks.</p>

  <p>Most of these supposed swindlers only dared to wander around the Heavenly Stellar Palace, but none had the gall to actually break inside.</p>

  <p>At first, Zheng had no plans of interfering in this matter. However, the ancient jade the beggar had shown to the guards changed his mind.</p>

  <p>The beggar wasn't lying. Zheng could indeed feel the life energy from the ancient jade. Using his perception to scan it, he discovered that it was similar to a living thing.</p>

  <p>"Take him away!</p>

  <p>Make sure to put him behind bars. That'll teach him!"</p>

  <p>A few guards had already grabbed the beggar by the shoulder, preparing to escort him out of the palace.</p>

  <p>It was then that Zheng decided to make his appearance. "Hold on!"</p>

  <p>The leader of the guards immediately bowed down in shame once he realized that Zheng had actually been alerted. "Master Luo, we..."</p>

  <p>"Silence," Zheng said dismissively. He then turned to the beggar. "Come with me!"</p>

  <p>A look of ecstasy appeared on the beggar's face at Zheng's words. As for the guards, they immediately let him go.</p>
