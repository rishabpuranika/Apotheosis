<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1835 The Heart Of The Sinful Dragon </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>The Calamity Dispelling Wood burned with extraordinary flames, but none of it harmed Luo Zheng in any way.</p>

  <p>However, the Calamity Dispelling Fragrance caused him to feel rather stifled when his entire body fell into the fire.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>The dry tree trunks continued to collapse as they burned, burying Luo Zheng underneath the glowing charcoals.</p>

  <p>Many of the Collapsing Mountain warriors gathered around the bonfire and observed Luo Zheng carefully.</p>

  <p>It was obvious that they were already aware of Zheng's resistance to fire and were currently using him for this experiment.</p>

  <p>Three minutes later, someone bent down and removed the charcoals that had previously buried Luo Zheng. Seeing that the young man was unharmed, they pulled him out and threw him carelessly to the side.</p>

  <p>"Hdfkioue!"</p>

  <p>"Dahfdh!"</p>

  <p>There was a discussion amongst all of them in their own language.</p>

  <p>After a few collective nods and final-sounding words, the Collapsing Mountain race seemed to have come to a conclusion and dispersed.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng noticed a few warriors from other races mixed in with the Collapsing Mountain race. He even saw an ogre.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the warriors on the square seemed to be divided into different grades.</p>

  <p>The bonfires were set up based on the distribution of the blood grooves.</p>

  <p>Warriors of the Collapsing Mountain race gathered around the bonfire in the center while those from the other races gathered around the ones in the periphery.</p>

  <p>A few warriors of other races could enter the inner circle, but they were generally stronger and were all world lords.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng had been thrown into the bonfire right in the middle of the square.</p>

  <p>"Sit-up!" ordered a well-built Collapsing Mountain warrior.</p>

  <p>Sitting up on his own was a tad bit difficult for Luo Zheng due to the overwhelming gravitational pull.</p>

  <p>His body had been refined successfully, and his strength and endurance had been greatly enhanced, but it still took him a great deal of effort to do as he was told. After borrowing the power of the dragon scales, Luo Zheng managed to pull himself up. He did not dare move the slightest once he was upright since any sort of movement would bring him back down again.</p>

  <p>The Collapsing Mountain warrior who ordered him to sit up had thick fur on his chest and wore a golden shoulder guard. On that shoulder guard was an exquisitely carved wolf head. The wolf head had three, sharp thorns on its head. Luo Zheng couldn't figure out what kind of wolf it was.</p>

  <p>The warrior sat down and faced Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Clap! Clap!</p>

  <p>Upon clapping his hands, two other warriors brought him a huge plate wherein two huge hearts were laid. Each of the hearts was taller than Luo Zheng so there was no doubt that both came from some huge beasts.</p>

  <p>They had already been roasted which was evident by their oily and steaming surface. It smelled like cooked meat laced with the pungent scent of blood. Strangely, the hearts still beat ever so slightly. There was a cut in one where faint, green blood oozed out of.</p>

  <p>What kind of beast's heart was this? Despite being dismembered and roasted, the hearts were still beating.</p>

  <p>Clang!</p>

  <p>The Collapsing Mountain warrior took the plate and slammed it down in front of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Because he was already on the verge of collapsing, the air current from the plate was enough to push Luo Zheng backwards.</p>

  <p>Plop!</p>

  <p>His head landed heavily on the ground as he fell.</p>

  <p>"Hahaha!"</p>

  <p>He heard a burst of laughter come from a distance, most probably from the children.</p>

  <p>However, their mirth was quickly silenced by the Collapsing Mountain warrior who hushed them. He then turned back to Luo Zheng. "Foreigner, you are the first one to stand despite being only at the Spirit Supreme Realm!"</p>

  <p>His words made all laughter and conversation cease.</p>

  <p>The Collapsing Mountain warriors had a special constitution that enabled them to bear the abnormal gravitational force and move around the place freely.</p>

  <p>Almost all of the foreigners who got the top-level trial tallies were already at the Spirit Transformation Realm. It was unlikely for Spirit Supreme Realm warriors to accomplish this feat since there were still those at the Spirit Transformation Realm that hadn't even stood up yet.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, however, was an exception. The young man once again gritted his teeth and struggled to get up from the ground.</p>

  <p>The Collapsing Mountain warrior on the other side grabbed one of the hearts and threw it towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"This is the Sinful Dragon's heart. Eat it!" he told Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Bam!</p>

  <p>The burning-hot heart smashed towards Luo Zheng forcefully.</p>

  <p>It almost smashed him back to the ground again.</p>

  <p>However, he had already learned his lesson. Before the heart even had the chance to land, he already tilted his body to fall forward. As the heart plopped itself down, the force pushed his body backwards. Because of the opposing forces, Luo Zheng was able to sit upright.</p>

  <p>A trace of admiration flashed on the Collapsing Mountain warrior's face when he saw through Zheng's strategy.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng held the heart and buried his head on it. He did not care whether it tasted good or not; he simply opened his mouth wide and began to eat it.</p>

  <p>The Calamity Dispelling Fragrance had tormented him for so long and this was a chance for him to finally satiate his hunger.</p>

  <p>He wolfed down the heart in an attempt to fill himself up in the shortest time possible.</p>

  <p>The Sinful Dragon's heart was quite strange, perhaps even revolting. As Luo Zheng ate, he felt the meat continue to pulsate. Each swallow intensified a burning sensation in his stomach that spread throughout his entire body.</p>

  <p>He could feel himself gradually gain power as he ate.</p>

  <p>'The Sinful Dragon's heart actually has such an effect!' he thought and kept on chewing.</p>

  <p>After relentlessly eating through the heart, Luo Zheng finally managed to create an opening. The Collapsing Mountain warriors were evidently skilled with the blade since the fresh blood remained inside of the heart cavity though it had already been cut off from the beast. Green-colored blood spurted out of the heart and Luo Zheng drank it all forcefully.</p>

  <p>This display of such voracious appetite was greatly admired by the Collapsing Mountain warriors. Their logic was simple: a warrior's potential depended on whether or not he had a good appetite.</p>

  <p>This wasn't necessarily the case for warriors of the outside world. In fact, once a warrior reached a certain boundary in cultivation, they wouldn't even need to eat at all.</p>

  <p>Before long, Luo Zheng had devoured the Sinful Dragon's heart completely.</p>

  <p>"You have a good appetite!" the Collapsing Mountain warrior smiled, grabbing his wineskin and throwing it towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng grabbed the wineskin and bit the cork open before gulping down the wine. The drink felt like small knives that sliced through Zheng's stomach.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng's body was extremely sturdy along with his internal organs so it wasn't that much of a big deal.</p>

  <p>The Collapsing Mountain warriors quietly stared at Luo Zheng as he emptied out the wineskin.</p>

  <p>The person across him was actually their new leader, Chapman Lei.</p>

  <p>These warriors were all addicted to alcohol and they drank wine like water. Foreign warriors who stayed in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land long enough would often exchange good wine for trial tallies with the Collapsing Mountain warriors.</p>

  <p>Over the years, the Collapsing Mountain warriors themselves mastered all sorts of strange methods for winemaking. They used water from the Nether Cold Fountain to make Frosty Wine, which was like white frost that froze the immediate vicinity. They also used the Flame Serpent Fruit to make Flame Wine that, once ignited, could burn for ten years.</p>

  <p>However, the most precious was the Soul-enchanting Wine in Chapman Lei's wineskin. According to rumors, the winemaking method for it had been given to him by a person from the divine land as a gift. The brewing process combined the blood of various, powerful beasts.</p>

  <p>The intensity of this wine was beyond imagination.</p>

  <p>This was not wine at all, but the most violent poison.</p>

  <p>If a Spirit Transformation Realm warrior took one sip of this wine, they would have to go all out in refining it. Otherwise, they would end up burning from the inside out.</p>

  <p>That was just one sip!</p>

  <p>Even Chapman Lei himself only dared to drink one gulp a day.</p>

  <p>The wine was extremely strong and it was also made from the blood of various beasts. It was held as an extremely precious item for the Collapsing Mountain race that even the members rarely got the chance to drink it.</p>

  <p>So Luo Zheng drinking it with such tenacity made Chapman Lei feel a great deal of heartbreak and also a tinge of amazement.</p>
