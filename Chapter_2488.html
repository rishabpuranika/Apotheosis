<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2488 The Sun-resisting Umbrella </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Compared to Luo Zheng's complex thoughts, Yan was much simpler.</p>

  <p>Unlike the awkwardness between Luo Zheng and Lorena, Yan and Lorena were much more familiar with each other.</p>

  <p>In fact, Luo Zheng still had some doubts about Yan.</p>

  <p>He and Yan were siblings, and yet their blood powers were different.</p>

  <p>That made Luo Zheng confused.</p>

  <p>Based on the uniquely shaped and powerful shadow that Yan had released, it seemed like his mother also possessed that.</p>

  <p>This was very likely because of Yan's blood power.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't press further.</p>

  <p>He knew enough.</p>

  <p>The three reached the foot of the cyan stone tablet.</p>

  <p>Right behind the stone tablet was Enoch, who was hiding there. He hurriedly scurried away from Lorena with terror written on his face.</p>

  <p>Lorena walked to the cyan stone tablet and gently stroked it for a moment.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The Sanskrit words carved on the cyan stone tablet faintly began to flicker with color.</p>

  <p>Rumble...</p>

  <p>The stone tablet began to violently tremble.</p>

  <p>"Because my father didn't come here, there isn't actually a controller in the divine land," Lorena said.</p>

  <p>Chiyou created this world and made it a ship that would go far in the chaos. He didn't come with the ship himself because he stayed in the Source World to lead the clansmen's fight against their enemies.</p>

  <p>Even though it was called a ship, it wasn't an accurate description. After all, the divine land was a big world.</p>

  <p>In order to give the Nine Li people better opportunities to cultivate, Chiyou mustered all his cultivation into the divine land.</p>

  <p>Because there weren't enough warriors to manage the divine land, he left several blank slates.</p>

  <p>The slates were all blank in the beginning.</p>

  <p>Using divine might coins, the Nine Li people could write rules on the slates.</p>

  <p>In fact, it was exercising one's right of control.</p>

  <p>The entire divine land would have been controlled by the Nine Li race, who began calling themselves the Sacred race, if it weren't for the Yellow Emperor Guards.</p>

  <p>There would be no divine citizens or wealthy clans. All Holy Beings would be of the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>"But Father gave Harper the authority to control this ship as he's the most loyal warrior to my father," Lorena added.</p>

  <p>"So Harper's the captain of the ship."</p>

  <p>"Yes." Lorena nodded.</p>

  <p>"Is Master Harper still alive?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>It was suspicious that a dead warrior at the Other Shore Realm could give out such a powerful Truth of Divine Dao, and so Luo Zheng couldn't stop himself from asking.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he is."</p>

  <p>Doubt colored Luo Zheng's voice. "Since Master Harper is still alive, why doesn't he save the divine land?</p>

  <p>You just said that he's the most loyal person to your father. It is impossible for him to just watch when the divine land is about to be destroyed, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"He's not dead, but he can't control the direction of the ship right now.</p>

  <p>Someone needs to take the responsibility from him," Lorena explained tiredly.</p>

  <p>It was the first thing Harold should do? obtaining the inheritance of the debate venue.</p>

  <p>If the divine land kept falling, everyone would go with it. The first step for them was to change the direction of the ship.</p>

  <p>Of course, Harper was aware of that.</p>

  <p>Using just about all his life, Harper created the debate venue to pick out someone to take over his responsibility.</p>

  <p>So many divine eras passed that Harper began losing hope when no suitable candidates appeared.</p>

  <p>He was pessimistic as Lorena.</p>

  <p>Any more struggle was meaningless in Harper's eyes since the Nine Li race was finished.</p>

  <p>If Lorena wasn't Luo Zheng's incarnation of fear, the debate would have been futile again.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Because of the constant vibration of the cyan stone tablet, a crack appeared in the middle.</p>

  <p>With a slender finger, Lorena gently touched the crack on the cyan stone tablet.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The stone tablet, which was a thousand feet high, immediately split apart and fell to the sides.</p>

  <p>An oiled paper umbrella appeared in the center of the stone tablet.</p>

  <p>"The Sun-resisting Umbrella is the inheritance of the debate venue," was what Luo Zheng's mother said.</p>

  <p>The moment the Sun-resisting Umbrella appeared, Reinhard, the soybean-eyed guy, and the others, were all focused on the umbrella.</p>

  <p>They didn't expect that the most important thing in the debate venue was hidden inside the tablet.</p>

  <p>"This is what our Sword Clan wanted to get for years!"</p>

  <p>"It's right in the middle of the stone tablet!"</p>

  <p>"If I knew, I would have just destroyed the stone tablet."</p>

  <p>"You can't open the stone tablet by yourselves. Luo Zheng, go get the umbrella,"</p>

  <p>Lorena said flatly.</p>

  <p>"Yes!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>The umbrella floated about three hundred feet in the air.</p>

  <p>Even if Luo Zheng couldn't fly, he just jumped up and reached out his hand. He grabbed the umbrella in his hand and dragged it down easily.</p>

  <p>"How could one change the direction of the divine land with this umbrella?" A strange expression appeared on Luo Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>There seemed to be nothing special about the umbrella.</p>

  <p>"It's not what you think," said Lorena with a smile. "Unfurl it."</p>

  <p>At his mother's suggestion, Luo Zheng unfurled the Sun-resisting Umbrella.</p>

  <p>"Yes!"</p>

  <p>The moment the Sun-resisting Umbrella was unfurled, a golden light shield appeared around Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>The light shield was like an enchanted barrier but Luo Zheng didn't know how strong it was.</p>

  <p>"The enchanted barrier of the Sun-resisting Umbrella can protect you from being burned by the fire of the sun," Lorena explained.</p>

  <p>"This light shield can resist the fire of the sun?" Luo Zheng was shocked.</p>

  <p>There was a great sun hanging in the divine land.</p>

  <p>The sun rose from the Ray Tree in the east and disappeared to the edge of the Sunrest Tree Region in the west.</p>

  <p>No matter how many divine eras had passed, there had never been an exception.</p>

  <p>The power of the sun could burn everything, and even the Holy Beings never got too close.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't expect that the paper umbrella could withstand its power.</p>

  <p>"This umbrella can take you into the sun. In the Heavenly Wheel Hall, you would be the new captain of the divine land who can change the direction of this ship," she said.</p>

  <p>"Enter the sun?" Luo Zheng's eyes narrowed.</p>

  <p>"My brother's going to be roasted!" Yan said with a laugh.</p>

  <p>Lorena had a general idea of what Luo Zheng was thinking. "Even if you practiced the Grand Weapon Refining Method and forged your body to be able to resist fire, you still won't be able to take the heat. However, you'll be safe as long as you take this umbrella. You can treat the umbrella as a key to open the door in the sun. But before that, I'll take you to meet Harper."</p>

  <p>She turned her head and glanced at the others. Her voice was cold when she spoke. "You may leave. I will send Luo Zheng and Yan back later."</p>
