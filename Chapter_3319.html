<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>In the light that Feng Ge had released, Luo Zheng finally saw what was going on around him, surprised.</p>

  <p>They were now stepping onto the floor that was made of a huge piece of jade.</p>

  <p>"Is this whole floor paved with a single piece of cyan jade?" Luo Zheng muttered.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge seemed to know this and didn't react to Luo Zheng's question.</p>

  <p>The jade floor at the bottom of the black pool was lined. Feng Ge lowered her head to look closely at it. She walked along the patterns, as if she was looking for something.</p>

  <p>The jade itself could not resist the light that Feng Ge had released. Wherever the light passed through, the surface of the jade floor became corroded.</p>

  <p>They walked for a dozen steps at the bottom of the pool when the jade under their feet lightened in color. It started to become transparent, allowing them to easily see through it.</p>

  <p>"This is..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had previously noticed random lines on the jade floor. But as he looked more carefully, he found they weren't lines but Green Jade Bugs that were embedded in the floor.</p>

  <p>Did the Green Jade Bugs in the black pool grow out of this?</p>

  <p>A strange thought came to Luo Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>This place was full of wonders. Wilder guesses wouldn't feel wrong in this situation.</p>

  <p>What he saw next proved him right. The Green Jade Bugs under the jade floor moved suddenly and began to fly around within the jade, probably having been disturbed by Feng Ge's light.</p>

  <p>The hard jade was like water to the Green Jade Bugs. They wandered freely within it.</p>

  <p>These bugs would be safe as long as they didn't come out because the jade floor had blocked the light that was capable of eliminating them.</p>

  <p>But it looked like they were courting death as they emerged from the floor and began to fly around.</p>

  <p>They pointed the cyan needles that were in their mouth upward, and for some time, it looked like the floor was covered with needles.</p>

  <p>"Watch out!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was not sure if Feng Ge had the ability to resist the Green Jade Poison. If she didn't, it would be a lot of trouble if she were to be bitten by these bugs.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng lifted Feng Ge onto his shoulder.</p>

  <p>Puff. Puff. Puff.</p>

  <p>Moments later, Luo Zheng felt pain in his feet as the needles began to stab him.</p>

  <p>Groups of Green Jade Bugs had gathered at his feet and were stabbing their needles into his soles.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng might not be afraid of the Green Jade Poison, but being stabbed by the needles was still a painful experience.</p>

  <p>The needles were densely packed before him and it looked like he was walking on a mountain formed by them.</p>

  <p>He had barely taken a few steps before he had to stop because his feet had become a mass of flesh and blood, no thanks to the poisonous needles.</p>

  <p>"Go!" Feng Ge barked, perched on Luo Zheng's shoulder.</p>

  <p>She waved a hand and released a ray of strong light that shot out towards Luo Zheng's feet, erasing the poisonous needles the moment they emerged from the jade floor. The light had now cleared a path for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The Green Jade Bugs, on realizing that it was impossible to stop Luo Zheng, rushed with a mad buzz towards Feng Ge instead.</p>

  <p>"Humph!"</p>

  <p>Feng Ge snorted and smiled contemptuously.</p>

  <p>A white circle of light spread out from her body. The Green Jade Bugs found it impossible to go anywhere near Feng Ge, because the moment they left the jade floor they were completely erased.</p>

  <p>The suicide attacks of the Green Jade Bugs had lasted for about three minutes before they finally stopped. No one knew how many Green Jade Bugs had died in the light.</p>

  <p>"Hoo..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>They were lucky to get rid of the Green Jade Bugs and he hoped they would not encounter the Green Jade Beasts.</p>

  <p>This thought had barely entered his mind when a pair of huge eyes loomed before him. It looked like a huge Green Jade Beast was embedded under the floor.</p>

  <p>The beast's eyes were wide open but lifeless.</p>

  <p>"If this thing comes out, we'll be in so much trouble!" Luo Zheng murmured.</p>

  <p>He was incapable of fighting against the Green Jade Beast at the moment.</p>

  <p>Even Feng Ge would have great difficulty in subduing it.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng was worrying unnecessarily. The Green Jade Beast didn't emerge from the jade floor.</p>

  <p>They had walked some distance when Luo Zheng spotted more Green Jade Beasts - about sixty of them - intertwined with each other.</p>

  <p>And these were only the Green Jade Beasts that were visible. God knew how much deeper this jade was. There were probably countless Green Jade Beasts hiding in its depths.</p>

  <p>If these Green Jade Beasts were let out, they might easily flatten Stage Thirteen.</p>

  <p>He walked a few hundred feet before the Green Jade Beasts were left behind. The color of the jade floor under his feet had turned into a shade of dark green.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had just begun to think that there was nothing underneath him when a ten-foot long cyan feather appeared out of nowhere.</p>

  <p>"Such a huge feather!" Luo Zheng said, surprised.</p>

  <p>"Finally found it!" Feng Ge gasped, smiling, and jumped off Luo Zheng's shoulder.</p>

  <p>She tiptoed towards the feather.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng followed close behind and as he looked down, he found that more and more feathers were appearing. A sudden thought flashed through his mind.</p>

  <p>These feathers belonged to the wings of a giant bird! Was there a giant bird lurking underneath this jade floor?</p>

  <p>He was proved right when he spotted the huge bird head some distance away.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge didn't stop running until after she had passed the bird's head.</p>

  <p>Underneath the surface of the jade floor was a spiky ball in the shape of a diamond.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge looked at it for a while before kneeling down on the ground beside it.</p>

  <p>She placed her hand on the floor above the diamond shaped spiky ball and released a bright light from her palm.</p>

  <p>The jade floor melted quickly under the strong light, leaving a gaping hole in its wake and exposing the diamond-shaped spiky ball.</p>

  <p>He didn't know what the ball was made of. The surface of the ball darkened under the strong light but it showed no signs of melting.</p>

  <p>"What's this?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," Feng Ge answered.</p>

  <p>She had come here driven by her memory to find the diamond shaped spiky ball. She didn't know what exactly it was or what it could be used for.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was speechless. It was a long time later that he helplessly said, "You have looked for it for so long. And now you've found it and you're saying you don't know what it is!"</p>

  <p>"Let me think," Feng Ge said. She searched her memory, head tilted and eyes narrowed at the ball. A few minutes later, she burst out, "Got it! It seems to be called the Civilization Artifact!"</p>
