<br/><br/>

  

  <p>One might remember that although Tracy was strong, her strength lay in her talent and blood, rather than in her diligence.</p>

  <p>As far as knowledge and experience was concerned, she was nowhere close enough to the saints and elders of Cloud Sect, or even Tianming and Patrick. So naturally, the reasons for their surprise were quite different.</p>

  <p>Patrick was surprised because he understood what had happened inside the combat ring.</p>

  <p>Tracy's shock did not arise from the fact that she had understood something, but because her Blue Phoenix's blood was tingling inside her body. Even though not knowing what had actually happened, the tingling phoenix blood inside instinctively sent a feeling of fear all across her body, as if some sort of natural defense mechanism. The tingle was enough to tell her that something extraordinary had happened around her.</p>

  <p>The Blue Phoenix was a legendary bird and was capable of extremely strong perception skills. It could sense things. If there was any danger in the surrounding environment, the blood of the Blue Phoenix would tingle, warning the owner of the danger.</p>

  <p>This was why Tracy was shocked and had almost screamed out.</p>

  <p>Patrick didn't have the blood of the Blue Phoenix and therefore, could not sense something unusual. However, he had already noticed that the skills utilized in the fight between Luo Zheng and Tianming had been far beyond their cultivation levels. This also meant that whatever had happened was also not some common phenomenon.</p>

  <p>"If my eyes don't deceive me, then their swordsmanship has just reached the most perfect level there can be. Both Luo Zheng and Tianming have taken inspiration from the fight and both reached the consummation level of the sword intent." Patrick muttered under his breath. An expectant expression, almost ecstatic secretly flashed on his face because he thought that he had finally found his match.</p>

  <p>Until now, there was only one disciple in the entire Cloud Sect who ranked stronger than Patrick did among the hundreds of thousands of disciples being trained every day. Evan was the strongest disciple of the Cloud Sect and of course, above Patrick. His identity was somewhat special. Strictly speaking, he shouldn't have been counted as a disciple of the Cloud Sect, and Patrick should be the Number One disciple in the sect.</p>

  <p>For that reason, Patrick had paid little attention to the All Peaks Competition at first.</p>

  <p>With his strength, and Evan not participating, no one would have been Patrick's match. It didn't matter whether he faced the top disciples of the thirty-three Peaks or personal disciples of the saints and elders of Cloud Sect. The final result of this All Peaks Competition did not make him curious or expectant since no one could have inspired his fighting will.</p>

  <p>But as the competition progressed and Luo Zheng and Tianming gradually showed their strengths in the round robin competition, Patrick found that the All Peaks Competition had become more and more interesting.</p>

  <p>He had been deeply impressed by Zheng's victory over Tracy and Jacques and Tianming's unique Heavenly Sword. The competition had become more fascinating than ever.</p>

  <p>Finally, he had found someone who could have matched him in this competition.</p>

  <p>Both Luo Zheng and Tianming had the ability to fight him and could, perhaps, even defeat him in some stroke of luck. He should become serious now.</p>

  <p>However, he completely disagreed with Tianming's claim that he had a fifty percent chance of defeating him.</p>

  <p>It was not that Patrick despised Tianming. On the contrary, he deeply admired the contestant and was impressed by the fact that he could master the four swords of the Heavenly Sword just at the consummation of nature level. When he himself had been at the consummation of nature level, he had been much weaker than Tianming was right now.</p>

  <p>After Patrick's practice of the Buddhist cultivation method, his personality and mentality had become very relaxed, and he was very open-minded when looking at the problems in his life.</p>

  <p>In his eyes, the highest possibility Tianming could have had of defeating him was not fifty percent, but thirty percent.</p>

  <p>To be honest, that was a very high evaluation indeed. After all, Patrick was a strong master at the Illuminating Soul Realm while Tianming was at the consummation of the nature level. The gap between their cultivation level was vast.</p>

  <p>But things were different now. Patrick hadn't expected that Tianming would be able to comprehend the consummation of the sword intent. He realized that his assessment of Tianming's ability had indeed been lower than he deserved.</p>

  <p>Patrick deemed that Luo Zheng was slightly stronger than Tianming. Although he hadn't been as remarkable as Tianming, he had used a lot of skills one by one during the fight, which had stunned the audience. In view of such an opponent, Patrick, who had always been calm, had become a little restless. The important part of being a warrior was to not let your enemy get into your head and Luo Zheng had managed that.</p>

  <p>And who knew if Luo Zheng was hiding more skills up his sleeve? This unfathomable feeling made Patrick realize that of all the contestants in this year's competition, Luo Zheng was perhaps the most deserving to fight with him.</p>

  <p>Patrick thought to himself, 'However, it is difficult for him to defeat me.</p>

  <p>It is highly probable that he will be restricted by his low cultivation level.</p>

  <p>What gets me is that at his current strength, it is weird to see him only at second-grade of nature level.'</p>

  <p>What was more unexpected was that Tianming and Luo Zheng had reached the consummation of the sword intent at the same time in battle.</p>

  <p>The sword intent was an artistic conception which was extremely difficult to comprehend and equally difficult to master.</p>

  <p>Why was there no sound when the two swords clashed? The audience was shocked because when Zheng's Streamer Sword and Tianming's Blood-corroding Sword, two first-class weapons had collided so hard, no sound was heard. It was as if they were made of paper.</p>

  <p>The reason for this lack of bang with the flash was that as soon as they realized the consummation of their sword intent, they had entered a perfect state of epiphany, and it had suppressed the sound completely in an instant.</p>

  <p>It wasn't that they were not powerful enough. Rather, all their life vitality and bodily strength had disappeared at once when they had reached the consummation of the sword intent. At that moment, the only thing for them to possess was the sword intent. Everything else would have gone blank to make way for it and therefore, there was no sound.</p>
