<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Since you know everything, please go ahead. I've brought this upon myself," said Yao smiling calmly.</p>

  <p>She no longer had any strategies left for a counterattack. In her dispute with Xun, the final result was a crushing defeat. However, her smile wasn't entirely innocent; there seemed to be hidden shrewdness behind her calm demeanor.</p>

  <p>Yao's expression was as tranquil as a lake, but her soul was trembling faintly. The Soul-sealing Needle in the depths of her soul was emitting a faint light.</p>

  <p>Xun slowly walked toward Yao grasping her Saint Killing Spear tight in her hand, her steps slow and heavy. The hatred between her and Yao was complicated. In the beginning, she had been killed by Yao and become a remnant soul. Then, Yao had sent out her people, Viveca, Elspeth, Salvador and Aneisha to hunt her. The four of them had killed themselves in front of Xun. It was all too much!</p>

  <p>Now that the opportunity for revenge was right in front of her, she didn't feel much joy even though she could easily kill her.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>The two tips of the Saint Killing Spear began to rotate. The two dots on the tips of the spear formed a circle of light due to the high-speed rotation.</p>

  <p>Ten feet...</p>

  <p>Five feet...</p>

  <p>Three feet...</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Leroy and Luo Zheng stood behind Xun, quietly watching the scene.</p>

  <p>This was a grudge match between Xun and Yao, and they would not interfere. Xun's tactics on dealing with the Queen of Life depended entirely on her mood.</p>

  <p>This spear strike was only a foot away from Yao. If Xun lightly swung it with her arm, it would be able to crush Yao's exquisitely beautiful face and reduce it to a pile of mud.</p>

  <p>But in this instant, the Soul-sealing Needle within Yao's soul suddenly broke into two.</p>

  <p>Pah!</p>

  <p>A light but sharp sound came from deep within Yao's soul.</p>

  <p>The instant the Soul-sealing Needle broke, Yao's entire Mu Ning underwent a dramatic change.</p>

  <p>Puff! Puff! Puff!</p>

  <p>An Mu Ning, which originated since ancient times but had been passed down eternally, was emitting from Yao's body!</p>

  <p>Under the spell of this incredible Mu Ning, everything in the universe was so tiny.</p>

  <p>Soon, an enormous transparent figure appeared behind Yao.</p>

  <p>The translucent figure did not have a completely-formed body. It was just a spectral Mu Ning that constantly whirled in the air, forming the shape of a person.</p>

  <p>Yao's face revealed a proud smile and her voice also became louder.</p>

  <p>"Xun, how naive you are! Do you really think you have what it takes to kill me? Hahaha!"</p>

  <p>Yao suddenly spread out both her hands and tilted her head backwards.</p>

  <p>She had a crazed smile on her face as she loudly proclaimed, "Master, you're here..."</p>

  <p>That translucent figure continued to grow. Almost instantly it went from a height of a hundred feet to more than a thousand feet, then ten thousand feet, before finally transforming into a figure of a hundred thousand feet.</p>

  <p>Roar!</p>

  <p>Sensing threat from the transparent figure, the Ancestral Dragon stretched out its enormous head and roared at the figure.</p>

  <p>As the Ancestral Dragon roared, the figure suddenly waved its huge arm.</p>

  <p>The translucent arm continued to move and came fiercely towards the Ancestral Dragon.</p>

  <p>The Ancestral Dragon was not to be outdone. Its mouth split open, revealing sharp teeth and it heavily bit the arm.</p>

  <p>However, the translucent figure was faster than the Ancestral Dragon. It flipped its invisible arm, and directly slapped the Ancestral Dragon's head.</p>

  <p>Bam!</p>

  <p>A muffled sound was heard as the Ancestral Dragon suffered a heavy blow from this slap.</p>

  <p>Its massive body tumbled through the air from the Inauguration Altar and slammed heavily onto the ground.</p>

  <p>The Ancestral Dragon's massive body created a thousand-mile long ravine on the ground. The moment it fell to the ground, its tail smashed down heavily, causing the ground to crack instantly. Using the power of the strike, the Ancestral Dragon shot up towards the transparent figure once again.</p>

  <p>As it flew towards the transparent human figure, the Ancestral Dragon's mouth began to accumulate a demonic red light. It looked like it was about to spit out a mouthful of dragon breath.</p>

  <p>The transparent human figure once again reached out and started shoving the head of the Ancestral Dragon down towards the ground.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Under this pressure, another massive ravine was formed, spanning thousands of miles. This ravine spread into the distance, covering almost the entire Rosy Cloud World and becoming a permanent scar on this supreme world.</p>

  <p>Roar! Roar! Roar!</p>

  <p>Now the Ancestral Dragon released a vicious Mu Ning and twisted its body wildly in front of the transparent figure. However, no matter how much it struggled, it was unable to come out of the giant hand. In the end, its tail kept dancing and finally curled around the arm.</p>

  <p>The translucent figure reached out with its other hand and grabbed the tail of the Ancestral Dragon, ripping it off its own arm. It seized the tail of the creature and sent the gigantic Ancestral Dragon flying tens of millions of miles, smashing it against the edge of the Rosy Cloud World with great force.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The battle between the two giant creatures caused an abnormally intense vibration in the world.</p>

  <p>The Ancestral Dragon slammed into the edge of the Rosy Cloud World with its powerful kinetic energy, causing the entire world to shake violently. The ground began to crack as volcanoes erupted, setting off a series of earthquakes.</p>

  <p>Yao stood at the feet of the transparent giant and raised her head to observe at this scene. A faint smile appeared on her face. Then she shifted her gaze towards Xun, a proud and arrogant expression taking over her face. "Xun, do you really think that everything has come to an end?"</p>

  <p>At this point, Xun, Luo Zheng and Supreme Lord Leroy stared at the invisible figure, their expressions sullen. Judging by the powerful Mu Ning emitted by the transparent figure, they might not be able to contend against it.</p>

  <p>"This is... the Mu Ning of a Holy Being!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng frowned and narrowed his eyes as he sized up the figure.</p>

  <p>Holy Jay and Holy Drew were the most powerful among all the mighty warriors that Luo Zheng had met. These Holy Beings' auras were ancient and vast. They were the only ones who could be described as eternal. Even True Gods didn't have these kinds of auras.</p>

  <p>But it was impossible for a Holy Being to enter the universe, wasn't it?</p>

  <p>The transparent figure's head lowered suddenly as it looked at Luo Zheng and Xun. Its massive body rotated slightly and its giant hand was raised.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The figure flailed its giant hand about violently, causing disturbances in the surrounding air currents and setting off a hurricane.</p>

  <p>"Let's go!"</p>

  <p>Even the Ancestral Dragon was thrown off by the transparent figure. Luo Zheng knew that they had no way of fighting it and could only avoid it at this moment.</p>

  <p>He was trying to help Xun escape, but he himself chose not to leave. Instead, he charged towards the giant translucent hand that was coming down on him.</p>

  <p>Bam!</p>

  <p>"Transfer the power!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had a head-on collision with the transparent palm. Compared to the enormous palm, he was as minuscule as an ant.</p>

  <p>However, it was this very ant that strongly blocked the palm mid-air!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng transferred the boundless power in the deadly palm into another supreme world.</p>

  <p>At this moment, there was a tremendous power surge in a supreme world occupied by the Sacred race. In a bizarre turn of events, a palm imprint appeared on the supreme world, and the entire surface of the world began to crack and crumble. Countless cracks appeared thereafter, and then began to disintegrate.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>For all the living beings in that supreme world, this strike was the beginning of the apocalypse. After the collapse of the supreme world, it constantly spiraled downwards, and the ascending passageways connecting from the Lower World also began to break one by one.</p>

  <p>Countless living creatures were desperately flying towards the sky in a bid to escape nature's wrath.</p>

  <p>The power of this palm strike could completely destroy a supreme world.</p>

  <p>Zheng's heart was thumping like crazy as well.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lords were unable to demolish a supreme world completely.</p>

  <p>For example, Yao's Profound Holy Thunder had obliterated a third of the surface area of the Celestial Wolf World. The Profound Holy Thunder had only caused destruction on the surface area of the Celestial Wolf World.</p>

  <p>However, no Supreme Lords could wipe out a supreme world. Even when several Supreme Lords fought against each other in the Orange Sea World, they weren't able to make the entire Orange Sea World disappear.</p>

  <p>At least half of the Orange Sea World still remained.</p>

  <p>But now, the translucent palm had shattered a supreme world.</p>

  <p>The palm attack was blocked by a small, ant-sized warrior. The transparent shadow seemed to be caught off guard. However, it only hesitated for a moment and then used its other hand to hit Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Bam!</p>

  <p>Another vicious muffled sound.</p>

  <p>Left with no other choice, Luo Zheng once again transferred the power he received to another world.</p>

  <p>Another supreme world became Zheng's scapegoat. After he transferred the power to that supreme world, it would also be desecrated without exception.</p>

  <p>'This won't do, ' Luo Zheng thought anxiously.</p>

  <p>If he allowed this translucent figure to keep attacking him, and he, in turn, kept sacrificing all the supreme worlds of the Upper World, it would still not be enough! He had to think of another way.</p>
