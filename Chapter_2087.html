<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Due to the unexpected occurrence of the event, Pranav became confused.</p>

  <p>He suffered three punches as he didn't have the time to analyze the situation. Bewilderment was apparent in his expression.</p>

  <p>As he heard Blayd's remarks, Pranav's befuddlement grew even worse!</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Luo Zheng appeared next to Blayd. Pranav's expression became stiff.</p>

  <p>"You!" Pranav's eyes flashed. Hatred was reflected in his eyes as he stared at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Pranav had been planning to search for Luo Zheng meticulously, after he murdered all of those Supreme Lords. He was determined to find Luo Zheng, no matter the cost.</p>

  <p>The Evolutionary Universe was vast. However, with Pranav's cultivation base, he knew that there was nowhere for Luo Zheng to hide.</p>

  <p>Never would he have thought that the guy would actually show up and invite such a powerful expert. Pranav couldn't believe the situation he was in.</p>

  <p>Just then, Pranav still wondered why Blayd only used sixty percent of his strength in his three punches instead of his maximum power to kill Pranav. Pranav was aware that the third punch of Blayd would be able to kill him. When he finally saw Luo Zheng, Pranav immediately understood that Luo Zheng had once employed a Wishing Spell towards him. The reason why Blayd did not kill him was just to make Luo Zheng fulfill the Wishing Spell.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng slowly walked towards Pranav with the Great Weighty Sword in his hand. Coldness was apparent in Zheng's eyes. When he arrived in front of Pranav, Luo Zheng gently held the Great Weighty Sword horizontally and pressed it against Pranav's neck.</p>

  <p>With the help of the Wishing Spell, Luo Zheng felt that his power had almost doubled. That was the advantage brought by the Wishing Spell, but the drawbacks were obvious. If Luo Zheng did not kill Pranav personally, his cultivation base would be permanently stagnated. Moreover, there was no way to break that curse, and Luo Zheng wouldn't be able to advance in his cultivation for the rest of his life!</p>

  <p>Therefore, even if most martial artists in the divine land could use the Wishing Spell, they were extremely cautious if they were to employ it�</p>

  <p>"I realize the wish of the Wishing Spell. Slaughtering the one in front of me is enough to calm my indignation. His death would quell the anger in my heart. With this, I would be able to fulfill my vows to the Wishing Spell," Luo Zheng softly muttered before he raised Great Weighty Sword in his hands.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Pranav no longer had the strength to struggle. Blayd's punches seemed ordinary, but the War God Hall's ultimate technique was extraordinarily formidable and destructive. The rapid surge of Blayd's fighting intent immediately extinguished the momentum within Pranav's body. At the same time, it entered Pranav's internal organs through his meridians and then penetrated his inner world.</p>

  <p>The Holy Being covered the heavens with the Heavens-suppressing Object, while the True God covered the inner world with the Godly Tile.</p>

  <p>Once the Godly Tile was formed, it would not be destroyed. However, once those streaks of fighting intent were infused into the inner world, they would completely wrap around Pranav's Godly Tile. That was equivalent to sealing off all of Pranav's momentum. The loss of connection with his Godly Tile had left Pranav helpless and weakened.</p>

  <p>With a sword pressed on his neck, Pranav knew that he was about to die.</p>

  <p>However, the smile on his face only became more and more pronounced.</p>

  <p>He then let out an arrogant laugh and said, "Do you really think that you can save the entire universe? And do you think you can save your father?"</p>

  <p>The arrogant words from Pranav's mouth caused the Great Weighty Sword to freeze in midair. In fact, with Zheng's current state of mind, no matter what Pranav said, it wasn't enough to affect him. However, Luo Zheng still responded with a calm tone, "No, I don't think so."</p>

  <p>"Then why are you struggling even though you are weak?" Pranav asked again with a prideful expression.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng creased his brow as he actually thought about the question rather carefully...</p>

  <p>Blayd, Xun, Supreme Lord of Oracle, and the others saw that Luo Zheng had started to hesitate. Their confusion was reflected on each of their faces. The Ancestral Dragon gently whimpered at the side, with a vast, damaged body. Even its power could not save it from death. Its pair of huge eyes had also lost their luster. But when the Ancestral Dragon saw Luo Zheng, its initially dim eyes suddenly glowed with a bright light. Although the Ancestral Dragon was no longer affected by the imprint after it grew up, it still had a natural sense of intimacy with Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Thirty seconds...</p>

  <p>Sixty seconds...</p>

  <p>Ninety seconds...</p>

  <p>The heavens shook violently again, and one more Supreme Lord had just died.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng still held his Great Weighty Sword high up in the air. As he maintained his formidable posture, his mind wandered for an answer.</p>

  <p>Puzzlement and perplexity were apparent at Zheng's face as he stared blankly at Pranav.</p>

  <p>Even though it was just a provocation, it was not easy for Luo Zheng to answer Pranav's question.</p>

  <p>From the very start, Luo Zheng had always struggled just because of his sister.</p>

  <p>He had survived all sorts of difficult situations just to get her back to his side. However, he finally realized that his father had personally arranged every predicament and danger for him...</p>

  <p>It had been a long time ever since he thought for a purpose about why he worked so hard to improve and to advance his cultivation...</p>

  <p>Pranav said such provocative words so that he could disturb Zheng's state of mind and stall for time. If Mateo were to appear here, he would still have a sliver of a chance to survive. Naturally, he would not give up. He also felt pleased as he saw that Luo Zheng was stunned after he delivered his provocations.</p>

  <p>Actually, for Luo Zheng, Pranav had asked a critical question. The query Pranav gave was related to the purpose of Zheng's life.</p>

  <p>"Boom, boom, boom�"</p>

  <p>Thunderous sounds of explosions could be heard from far away. The large balls of light exploded as the Supreme Lords continued their deadly battles. Even without the Roaring Token, the energy fluctuations and sounds of explosions could still spread very far away.</p>
