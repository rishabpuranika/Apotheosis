  <p>
</p>

  <p>"The Latent token is quite aggressive in nature. As long as it feels the massive killing intent from my opponent, it will counterattack without hesitation,"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng muttered to himself in his mind.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 had however countered and added, "It's nothing. In the Source World, there are some more powerful Latent Theurgies."</p>

  <p>"Are there also Latent Theurgies in the Source World?" Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"Of course. When some powerful masters protect the juniors of their clans, they would naturally grant these juniors those Latent Theurgies.</p>

  <p>Some Latent Theurgies will be triggered even just because you have taken a few glances at someone. Such Latent Theurgies are so outrageous," No. 9527 informed him.</p>

  <p>"Even a few glances will make one be punished." It was absurd and hearing about it made Luo Zheng speechless.</p>

  <p>Latent Theurgies were in actual fact similar to protective treasures. Only given the difference that they were more active and could start automatically when certain conditions were met.</p>

  <p>A sudden thought came to him about the 'Killing Intent Counterattack', the first Latent token. It instantly aroused his curiosity.</p>

  <p>At that moment, he released another wisp of spiritual sense to explore the next Latent token.</p>

  <p>"Life For The Dead.."</p>

  <p>He realized that it seemed to be the same as the 'Revenge' that Leland had obtained. This Latent token would only be activated once he lost his life.</p>

  <p>In the situation where he would breathe his last, this Latent token would still keep him alive and maintain his current fighting power for a period of time before he actually died completely.</p>

  <p>"This Latent token is the same as the Reincarnation token in the Life Divine Dao," Luo Zheng stated with a nod.</p>

  <p>The consummate level token of the Life Divine Dao was the Reincarnation token. For the consummate True Gods who cultivated Life Divine Dao, the moment they died, their life could be prolonged by creating another body.</p>

  <p>However, there was a deterrent condition in activating it. The time for the prolonged lifespan was limited, and they would completely die when the time ran out.</p>

  <p>"The next, Wind Cloud Escape..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes lit up when he saw the third Latent token.</p>

  <p>The Wind Cloud Escape could be advantageous for him during the time he would be in a danger of death. It could force him to teleport for a distance which was a good way to save his life.</p>

  <p>But thinking about it, the Space Law was ineffective in the Abyss Demon Region. He wondered if this 'Wind Cloud Escape' could still work in the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>"The fourth one is the 'Exhausting Power'. Once I unleash my full strength, it will work and give me even stronger power!"</p>

  <p>"The fifth one..."</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately, these Latent Theurgies can only be used once."</p>

  <p>After he checked all of the Latent Theurgies, Luo Zheng gave out a sigh full of emotion.</p>

  <p>Almost all of the Latent Theurgies had extraordinary effects. Once activated, they would cause a great turn of the situation.</p>

  <p>Gaining and having a total of seven Latent Theurgies above his head made him extremely secured. It was as if his strength had suddenly increased by several times in a short period of time!</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Leland on the side dazedly watched everything that transpired for quite a while.</p>

  <p>He was feeling resentful and was very jealous, but he knew to himself that it was impossible to snatch them away from Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He was rather grateful because if it weren't for Luo Zheng, he would probably still be lying on the ground like a corpse. After all, it was Luo Zheng who had saved everyone.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the Latent Theurgies were not something one could snatch.</p>

  <p>After examining all of the Latent Theurgies, Luo Zheng stared at Leland and said, "There's only one way to leave this place. It's through the Abyss Demon Region."</p>

  <p>Leland was at the moment caught up on a daze. He was all along focused on the ways to get the Latent token, and had placed the thought on how to leave the place on the back of his mind.</p>

  <p>He suddenly heard Luo Zheng's words bringing up the topic. It made his eyes twitch and he couldn't help but cry out, "What! What about the cave?"</p>

  <p>"That cave is only a one-way transmission channel," Luo Zheng responded in pursed lips.</p>

  <p>"The Abyss Demon Region..." Leland was all along aware of how horrible the Abyss Demon Region was and the dangers that awaited for everyone who dared enter the place. He was not a member of a Floating Island but he had paid a certain price to acquire a chance for entry using his identity as a Demi-holy Being. He then asked, "Which stage are we going to be in?"</p>

  <p>He thought that as long as it was within the first three stages, he could well accept it.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shook his head. "I don't know, but we must be in the very deep place..."</p>

  <p>Leland fell into silence.</p>

  <p>If the Reincarnation Land was located at the bottom of the Abyss Demon Region, the chances of them going back would be very small.</p>

  <p>After thinking for a while, Leland couldn't make up his mind and suggested in the end, "Ask those guys..."</p>

  <p>His suggestion simply implied about the top-rank Gods who were still focused on their cultivation.</p>

  <p>The top-rank True Gods currently were just greedily devouring the Memory Flames, and hadn't considered about the problem at all.</p>

  <p>Moreover, in their eyes, this should be something of Leland's concern.</p>

  <p>Both Luo Zheng and Leland gradually made a move. They swiftly left the Reincarnation Hall and descended on the steps.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng moved his finger lightly. Right after, the Memory Flames floating in the middle of these powerful top-rank True Gods' brows had then entered the sea of the Memory Flames.</p>

  <p>As a result, every top-rank True God's concentration was disturbed as they opened their eyes and looked at them in confusion.</p>

  <p>"What happened?" Cameron asked as he gave Luo Zheng a strange look.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng briefly explained the current problem to everyone.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's explanation startled the top-rank True Gods as they immediately realized the seriousness of the problem. They were trapped underneath the Abyss Demon Region!</p>

  <p>"Oh my god! We can't leave at all..." a top-rank True God among them cried out with a mournful look on his face.</p>

  <p>It was a known fact that the Abyss Demon Region was a forbidden place to the True Gods.</p>

  <p>Even the True Gods of powerful clans on the Floating Islands would be considered courting death if they dared enter the place.</p>

  <p>"I won't go," one of the top-rank True Gods responded quickly. "If I choose to leave, I will end up turning into these things."</p>

  <p>He pointed at the light dots as he spoke.</p>

  <p>The moment they died, they would only have their Memory Flames left.</p>

  <p>"Give me more time and I can comprehend the consummate level token. By then, perhaps I can leave this place," said another top-rank True God.</p>

  <p>There was a leeway to leave. If they could succeed in becoming a consummate True God, the chances of being able to safely get out of the Abyss Demon Region would greatly increase.</p>

  <p>Cameron spoke with a bitter smile, "Yes, he's right. With our current cultivation, if we go out now, it would be no different from courting death."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng listened and nodded. "You can stay if you want. But I will leave this place. Whoever wants to leave the Reincarnation Land with me has to make the decision now."</p>

  <p>Hearing this, some top-rank True Gods began to ponder.</p>

  <p>Choosing to still stay was not a good solution and indeed a risk.</p>

  <p>They pondered that even though their lifespan was unlimited, it was still impossible for them to live in this damned place all the time!</p>

  <p>After some time, some people finally made their decision. Three top-rank True Gods chose to leave together with Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>As for Leland, he also chose to leave with Luo Zheng. He was also afraid of the Abyss Demon Region, but he was after all a Demi-holy Being and had always been confident of his strength.</p>

  <p>The group who chose to leave were already decided. There were Luo Zheng, Leland and three top-rank True Gods. Luo Zheng did not choose to go immediately as they carefully set a plan. It made them stay for a period of time in the place for a while.</p>

  <p>It was not until three days later that the group were already set and ready to leave.</p>

  <p>They went on their journey and reached the other end of the Reincarnation Land. There was a pitch dark valley.</p>

  <p>As they walked through the valley, they felt as if they were walking through a cave. There were no light cast around and the surroundings were indeed engulfed in darkness.</p>

  <p>It didn't matter as they continued to move. They were always on guard but at that moment, they felt no danger in the Reincarnation Land.</p>

  <p>Five minutes later, they finally arrived at the end of the valley.</p>

  <p>A naturally formed stone arch bridge appeared in front of them. Beneath it, the turbulent lava was rolling and surging. They realized that it was a huge lava river.</p>

  <p>It seemed dangerous but they paid no attention to the lava below. Their gaze was focused on the other end of the stone arch bridge.</p>

  <p>They gradually continued and easily passed through the stone arch bridge. They successfully left the Reincarnation Land as they were ready now to enter the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>    </p>
