<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1976 A Child's Voice (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>In regards to the overall situation, the Sacred race were the ones who had the advantage.</p>

  <p>However, the human race still had a praiseworthy strategy. Even against the odds, they were able to devise such an intelligent scheme.</p>

  <p>After they sacrificed the territory of the Humanity Alliance, the Sacred race was stuck in a quagmire. The warriors of the Sacred race were unable to move any further into the universe. They continued to linger at the supreme worlds, which were on the border between the Humanity Alliance and the Thoughtless Minds.</p>

  <p>Whenever the Sacred race wanted to continue their expansion, the Thoughtless Minds and the Blessed Buddha Land disrupted their advance. The two groups dispatched hundreds of world lords to attack the supreme worlds occupied by the Sacred race.</p>

  <p>The most important thing in their strategy was that there seemed to be a Supreme Lord among the human race, who carried the Heavenly Destiny of a space token! The Heavenly Destiny could send any martial artist into any supreme world. Additionally, the martial artist would usually appear and disappear mysteriously to make sure the enemies wouldn't be able to detect them...</p>

  <p>As such, the Sacred race would often be bewildered with mysterious events. For example, as soon as the Sacred race occupied two supreme worlds, several world lords were sent to guard them. However, those world lords were always slaughtered suddenly just after the Supreme Lords of the Sacred race left!</p>

  <p>In truth, the Supreme Lord who held the Heavenly Destiny was Supreme Lord Healum of the Humanity Alliance.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Destiny that he carried belonged to the Space Law.</p>

  <p>Additionally, the Heavenly Destiny he held contained the token known as the Space Lock. The martial artist connected to the Space Lock could be thrown to any corner in the universe by Supreme Lord Healum. He could even instantly pull that martial artist back to his side!</p>

  <p>After the Humanity Alliance was defeated by the Sacred race and retreated to the Thoughtless Minds, Supreme Lord Healum continued to employ the 'Space Lock'. He cooperated with some of the stronger warriors of the Humanity Alliance, such as Yolande and the others, to launch surprise attacks. Their guerilla tactics were more than an effective disruption for the warriors of the Sacred race.</p>

  <p>When the Supreme Lords of the Sacred race received the news and rushed back, Yolande and the rest had already disappeared without any trace...</p>

  <p>It was that simple tactic that disrupted the attack plan of the Sacred race.</p>

  <p>The existence of the Heavenly Destiny in the Humanity Alliance continued to be an obstacle for the Sacred race.</p>

  <p>If the Sacred race wanted to advance towards the depths of the universe and attack more supreme worlds, then the Sacred martial artists left behind would all be defeated.</p>

  <p>"They are indeed not that stupid. The human Supreme Lords are just acting in coordination with Luo Luo Zheng," Supreme Lord Palmere uttered. His expression was calm yet calculative.</p>

  <p>"But their strategy is still successful," Supreme Lord Denzel interjected.</p>

  <p>"Right now, the momentum of the entire Evolutionary Universe has increased by quite a bit."</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Palmere suddenly smiled. "I feel like all of you are overthinking! They don't want to fight us head-on, which means that we will always have the initiative! We only need to destroy their momentum!"</p>

  <p>After they saw Supreme Lord Palmere's confident expression, all of the other Supreme Lords of the Sacred race and Maha revealed a trace of interest on their faces. It seemed as if Supreme Lord Palmere was about to reveal an intelligent counter-strategy.</p>

  <p>"There is such a thing called Roaring Token within the universe. We can use it to issue a challenge to the human race for a fight in a supreme world. Supreme Lords do not even need to take action. With Maha as the leader, we can constantly fight with the human world lords, Luo Luo Zheng and the other Godly Geniuses..." Supreme Lord Palmere said calmly. A devious smile was seen on his lips.</p>

  <p>However, halfway thru his speech, he discovered the strange gazes from Maha and the others. Thus, he asked them with a curious tone, "What's wrong?"</p>

  <p>Maha gently turned the golden scimitar in his hand. His eyes were full of caution. "Do you think they would fall for such a simple trick?"</p>

  <p>The other Supreme Lords also revealed looks of disbelief. Supreme Lord Irvin said in a strange tone, "Those Godly Geniuses have returned to the universe. They would surely hide at this moment. Why would they dare to reveal themselves now?"</p>

  <p>After Supreme Lord Palmere heard the remarks, he calmly responded,</p>

  <p>"First, the location of the battle would be in a supreme world situated at the border of the Thoughtless Minds to show fairness. Second, if they didn't accept the challenge under the invitation of Maha, the enemy would only be labelled as cowards. This would suppress their morale and thus weaken the momentum of the universe!"</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Palmere's idea might have sounded simple to the others, but he had reasons to believe that it would work against the human race.</p>

  <p>The human race were the ones who had declared war. Additionally, Luo Luo Zheng had issued the war declaration throughout the entire universe. If they would not dare to accept the challenge, it would only show that the human race didn't dare fight with the Sacred race at all. It would brand them as cowards.</p>

  <p>If such a thing happened, it would be detrimental to the morale of the human race.</p>

  <p>Moreover, they possessed the Roaring Token of the Evolutionary Universe. With that treasure, all the creatures in the universe would hear the declaration of challenge from the Sacred race. If the human race would reject the challenge, everyone would know their cowardice. As such, the morale of the human race would be instantly destroyed!</p>

  <p>"After we declare our challenge, they will have to take it. But no matter what method the human race choose, the final result will be a crushing defeat for them. Maha, what do you think?" Supreme Lord Palmere said with a shrewd smile.</p>
