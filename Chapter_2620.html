  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Then, what do you want me to bring back from the other shore?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng continued to ask.</p>

  <p>"We can't tell you," No. 9527 answered stiffly.</p>

  <p>'This guy is so stubborn even though it is asking for help.'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng curled his lips. "If you don't answer me, I'll drive you out."</p>

  <p>"You're not strong enough," No. 9527 responded. "Although your soul power far surpasses that of others at the same level, it's far from enough to expel me."</p>

  <p>Its answer was straightforward enough, which made Luo Zheng lose his interest in trying to get an answer.</p>

  <p>He really didn't have any good way to deal with it, since the opponent was after all a strand of the soul of the Chaos Ancient God.</p>

  <p>The wound on his body caused by the Body Tribulations was in no time healed quickly.</p>

  <p>After making sure that his condition was back to normal, he stretched his limbs for a while. Afterwards, he immediately left the Cave of Wildness.</p>

  <p>"Have you succeeded this time?"</p>

  <p>Baldwin asked as soon as he spotted Luo Zheng. He was standing above the Cave of Wildness.</p>

  <p>He was greeted by a nod and saw a smile on Luo Zheng's face. He knew that Luo Zheng had been successful.</p>

  <p>He had sent over a hundred people in order to help him undergo a breakthrough and become the top-rank Wild God.</p>

  <p>He was well aware and certain about Luo Zheng's ability and sufficiency in absorbing the Wild God Power.</p>

  <p>It could be said that Luo Zheng's body was like a black hole, easily absorbing almost all the Wild God Power without missing a single drop.</p>

  <p>The Wild God Power that he obtained was far beyond that of the ordinary Wild God.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was truly qualified to have succeeded on just the first time, but Baldwin could not help but sigh.</p>

  <p>He was held responsible and in charge of maintaining the Cave of Wildness distributing the wild bones to his race members. He had met and had various encounters with many talents in his race.</p>

  <p>But it was the first time for him to meet a guy like Luo Zheng. He knew that this might be their last encounter.</p>

  <p>Under the watchful eyes of everyone, Luo Zheng lightly stood on his tiptoe and flew away.</p>

  <p>"Grow!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng spoke an order.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh..."</p>

  <p>A powerful aura was suddenly emitted from Luo Zheng's body, and his body began to swell in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>One thousand feet...</p>

  <p>Five thousand feet...</p>

  <p>Ten thousand feet...</p>

  <p>If someone's body could reach a height of eight thousand to ten thousand feet, they could be considered the mid-rank Wild God. Before, Luo Zheng had been able to make his body reach the height of ten thousand feet.</p>

  <p>"Go on!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng felt that the Wild God Power in his body was still very powerful.</p>

  <p>Exerting his full strength, his body followed the order as it continued to grow and swell.</p>

  <p>Fifteen thousand feet...</p>

  <p>Twenty thousand feet...</p>

  <p>Thirty thousand feet!</p>

  <p>His body continued to grow until his head almost reached the top of the cave. At the same time, the Wild God Power in his body was almost exhausted reaching its limit.</p>

  <p>"It reaches the limit," Luo Zheng said calmly. The result was what he had expected.</p>

  <p>At the same time, a thought flashed on his mind and three heads and six arms appeared on his physical body.</p>

  <p>He wanted to test if he would activate the bloodline token after becoming the top-rank Wild God. Exploring it for a while, he did not feel anything unusual.</p>

  <p>'It seems like it's not easy to activate the bloodline token in the Wild God Power, ' Luo Zheng thought to himself.</p>

  <p>Just as he was immersed on this thought, No. 9527's consciousness once again sprung out to his mind. "The bloodline token? You already have a one, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"You are peeping into my soul!" Luo Zheng was a little annoyed.</p>

  <p>"Isn't that normal?" Noticing Luo Zheng's anger, No. 9527 felt a bit surprised.</p>

  <p>In the spiritual world of the Chaos Ancient God, the minds of all the brain units were exposed to each other. In other words, everyone was clear about everyone's thought. There was no need to hide something since they were accustomed to this.</p>

  <p>"Nonsense," Luo Zheng couldn't help but retort. After a pause, he came to a realization and asked, "What did you say just now? Bloodline token?"</p>

  <p>"You just blamed me for peeping at your soul." No. 9527 had no idea why Luo Zheng's thought had changed so quickly.</p>

  <p>"What we are talking about now is the bloodline token!" Luo Zheng fiercely corrected it.</p>

  <p>"Okay," No. 9527 responded. "When you first experienced the Body Tribulations, you obtained the inheritance of the Chaos Ancient God's blood, so you have already obtained the bloodline token."</p>

  <p>"The inheritance of the Chaos Ancient God's blood?" The information certainly shocked him.</p>

  <p>The oldest man had known about it, but he didn't tell Luo Zheng or spread to the public.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was after all the grandson of the Grand Chieftain, and the Wild Gods had deeply valued the purity of their blood.</p>

  <p>"As you said, it is the blood transplant. The sclerite in your chest you just mentioned is formed because of the blood," No. 9527 added.</p>

  <p>"The blood of the Chaos Ancient God has been planted in my body." Luo Zheng never expected this. He thought for a while and then asked, "What is the bloodline token?"</p>

  <p>No. 9527 smiled and explained, "This bloodline token comes from the early stage of chaos. Although you have this token, whether you can use it or control it depends on how much you can master!"</p>

  <p>As soon as these words were spoken, Luo Zheng suddenly felt the sclerite in his chest begin to heat up, and the temperature also rose higher and higher.</p>

  <p>He soon felt a burning sensation, as if a flame was constantly jumping in his chest.</p>

  <p>Strange textures in no time were revealed on the diamond-shaped sclerite. The textures turned into a large net and projected into Luo Zheng's mind. Afterwards, it slowly surrounded his soul.</p>

  <p>"What's this?"</p>

  <p>Being enveloped by the circular net, he felt as if he had lost contact with his physical body and his soul was trapped in the net.</p>

  <p>The Wild Gods who were watching outside the cave saw that Luo Zheng had involuntarily taken two steps back. His huge body fell on the ground, causing a loud bang.</p>

  <p>"What happened to Luo Zheng?"</p>

  <p>Baldwin was caught off guard as he asked.</p>

  <p>Many Wild Gods panicked.</p>

  <p>They had held high regards towards Luo Zheng attaining a great achievement in the Nine Li race, and his status in the race was incomparably high.</p>

  <p>The scene had indeed surprised them as he passed out right after becoming a top-rank Wild God.</p>

  <p>"Go and inform Grand Elder!" Baldwin abruptly gave out an order.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was oblivious to what was happening outside as he was still immersed in his own mind. No. 9527 continued to explain, "The Chaos Ancient God was lucky to observe the energy of the Divine Dao Great Unity in the early stage of chaos. Thus, he comprehended a truth which was in his use. That token is the truth token! It could control all the rules in chaos from the beginning to the end, in an unbreakable way!"</p>

  <p>The voice of No. 9527 sounded in his own mind. It sounded very illusory when the voice was isolated by the net.</p>

  <p>The more No. 9527 explained, the more he was astonished.</p>

  <p>It was superior to all rules, which could not be broken from the beginning to the end.</p>

  <p>What an incredible token!</p>

  <p>The energy of the Divine Dao Great Unity?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had once cultivated the Ways-blending Strike which used to merge all of the three thousand Divine Dao in one. But what was the Divine Dao Great Unity? It even made the Chaos Ancient God come up with a truth!</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>The huge net began to spin, turning into a round ball and enveloping Luo Zheng's soul.</p>

  <p>Then a strange picture, appearing on the inner wall of the ball, unfolded slowly right before Luo Zheng's vision.</p>

  <p>"Golden Sanskrit words?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was once more stunned looking at the golden words that had appeared in the inner wall of the huge ball.</p>

  <p>His only concern was that he couldn't understand it.</p>
