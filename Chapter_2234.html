<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The rich playboys of the wealthy clans were quite used to this kind of situations.</p>

  <p>In fact, they meant no harm, as they only thought of it as a game.</p>

  <p>However, this game would prove to be quite costly to the three sisters of the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>The Han Clan was meant to be riding on the Leng Clan's coattails.</p>

  <p>Although the playboys mostly kept it to themselves, they despised the Han Clan in their hearts. They also had a tendency to create troublesome situations for others. They were quite keen on the politics of the Floating Islands as well.</p>

  <p>They were aware of their actions and knew whom to avoid when they stirred trouble.</p>

  <p>The playboys were unaware of Luo Zheng standing there. He wouldn't have caught their attention even if he was a top-rank True God, let alone a proving godly warrior.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng kept his head down and started walking towards them.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Zheng was on the Floating Island, he didn't want to cause any trouble. He had no one to lean on and was weak. Provoking these guys didn't seem like a good idea as he could jeopardize everyone knowing his true identity, However, he couldn't just stand there and watch Aleyna getting bullied.</p>

  <p>"How about that?"</p>

  <p>When he was only seven or eight feet away from Aleyna, a great force made way through his feet and exploded.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng increased his strength in order to make up for the loss in speed. In the Evolutionary Universe, when everyone was flying back and forth, this was not much of an advantage, but in the divine land, it was extremely valuable and effective.</p>

  <p>Due to that turbulent force, Zheng's speed increased in an instant. His body started to lean forward. Few pieces of ice were condensed in his left hand, and a raging flame was seen in his right hand.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng used the Great Weighty Sword combined with the Emotion Closing Godly Way, he would have been able to even kill Keenan.</p>

  <p>However, the consequences would be quite severe once his Emotion Closing Godly Way was exposed.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Luo Zheng had stored a lot of Godly Ways through Infinity Ruler.</p>

  <p>Although, he was unable to cultivate anything during this time. He was also constantly thinking about the cooperation between these Godly Ways. He suddenly started waving his left hand just as he became fast.</p>

  <p>The air was filled by sudden swishing sounds.</p>

  <p>The ice cones in his left hand suddenly flew towards Keenan.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng started to attack, he finally attracted the attention of people that were present there.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng was only a proving godly warrior, the people over there didn't take him much seriously. After all, Aleyna was the strongest among the proving godly warriors, but she wouldn't have been able to do much against Keenan.</p>

  <p>"Where is this guy from? I just noticed him." People started to wonder.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. Maybe he is a direct disciple of the Han Clan. Maybe he wants to take a stand alongside Aleyna."</p>

  <p>"He used two Godly Ways at once? That's interesting," someone exclaimed.</p>

  <p>They thought low, even of those who were direct disciples of the Han Clan. The thought never crossed their mind that Luo Zheng was only an outer disciple.</p>

  <p>Clank! Clank! Clank!</p>

  <p>Keenan accurately caught all the sharp ice cones that Luo Zheng had thrown on his flute. His face grew darker as he said, "How dare you attack me! Do you wish to die?"</p>

  <p>He didn't take Luo Zheng as an opponent, but Luo Zheng had indeed disturbed the ambiance of the place. However, just as he was about to remove the ice cones off the silver flute, the corners of Zheng's mouth curled up.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Black and purple flames erupted from the ice cones, followed by a black smoke with a hideous smell. The hideous stench that filled the air was like that of the poison.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng himself created that nameless flame from the elementary fire. It took a long time to cultivate the Elementary Fire Godly Way. And it needed some practice and a few finishing touches to create one's own fire.</p>

  <p>The dark purple nameless fire was only a semi-finished fire, and it did not have much power in it. However, it looked quite frightening. When smelling the pungent odor of the thick smoke, everyone thought it was a toxic fire.</p>

  <p>Keenan's expression changed when he saw the black smoke. He waved the silver flute, and spun a strong wind from it, intending to blow out the flames and the black smoke on the flute.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't stop moving either. A five colored light flashed gently in his hand and activated the Earth Law of the Five Elements Godly Way. Then he punched the ground hard.</p>

  <p>Smash!</p>

  <p>A huge mud hand suddenly sprang out from under Keenan's feet and grasped him firmly.</p>

  <p>Keenan felt dizzy. He didn't expect Luo Zheng to exert so many methods in the blink of an eye. These methods weren't very powerful, but were still quite excruciating.</p>

  <p>"Who is he? He has used three types of Godly Ways in a short amount of time!"</p>

  <p>"He's not experienced in cultivating these Godly Ways. He's just very skilled at using them."</p>

  <p>"It is quite time consuming to cultivate several kinds of Godly Ways at the same time. And he has bitten more than he can chew!" people exclaimed.</p>

  <p>After becoming True Gods, people did cultivate more than one kind of Godly Way, but they mostly practiced a single Godly Way and the other one or two were just subsidiaries. But people were surprised to see Luo Zheng use three kinds of Godly Ways at the same time.</p>

  <p>"Oh! He's already using the fourth Godly Way. Wow! It's the Purple Mu Ning Godly Way! He's not a woman!"</p>

  <p>While they were gossiping, wisps of purple mist spread out and transformed into purple birds which then attacked Keenan. It was the incarnation in the Purple Mu Ning Godly Way.</p>

  <p>Being held captive by the mud hand and dealing with the large group of purple birds at the same time stunned Keenan. He didn't know what to do.</p>

  <p>Han Liusu and Langston were dumbfounded by the unexpected fold of events.</p>

  <p>Langston was one of the most powerful warriors present in this group, and his eyes were fixed on Luo Zheng. "This guy is unique. If he can unite several Godly Ways together, he could have a miraculous effect."</p>

  <p>Some of the mighty warriors of the divine land had truly grasped the way to perfectly combine several types of Godly Ways, but that required an extremely thorough comprehension and understanding of the Godly Ways. Langston thought that Luo Zheng was just playing petty tricks as he was just a proving godly warrior.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Han Liusu was a bit confused. She didn't expect Tianxing to constantly change his Godly Ways as soon as he attacked. Such a way dealing with the enemy was quite amazing.</p>

  <p>'This man is so powerful that he can unleash several Godly Ways to this point with such an ordinary cultivation level. He is quite unique, but isn't he Luo Zheng?'</p>

  <p>Liusu's heart was filled with sorrow. She couldn't figure out that whether Tianxing was actually Luo Zheng. If he wasn't Luo Zheng, he had nothing to do with her no matter how powerful he was.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom! The sky was filled with sudden booming noise.</p>

  <p>The purple birds which contained the internal momentum surrounded Keenan and exploded simultaneously. At the same time, some snowflakes drifted. The snowflakes covered the whole area, and suddenly it became cold there.</p>

  <p>"Snow Godly Way!"</p>

  <p>"This is the sixth Godly Way," someone exclaimed. "This fellow is quite mysterious."</p>

  <p>"I know plenty extraordinary people, but I never heard of this person in the Han Clan before."</p>

  <p>The playboys from the wealthy clans present were the most powerful and talented ones in the same realm. In their opinion, cultivating three or four kinds of Godly Ways was way too much work. And it would be a queer if they could display five or six kinds of Godly Ways casually. Moreover, this guy seemed to have cultivated much more Godly Ways than he had displayed.</p>

  <p>Even though Keenan had been cornered by Luo Zheng, the onlookers had no intention of helping him. They were interested in seeing what Luo Zheng would do next.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Aleyna intervened and stopped Luo Zheng in his tracks. She asked Luo Zheng to let her kill Keenan. Aleyna was not a softhearted person. Her cultivation base had restrained her strength, but she wasn't afraid of killing Keenan.</p>

  <p>Aleyna hated Keenan ever since she was molested by him. She didn't want to standby watching idly as Keenan was getting killed. She wanted to be the one to kill him herself.</p>

  <p>"Let me kill him!" Aleyna exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Keenan felt quite dizzy and furious at the same time. Whenever he tried to get out of this difficult situation, Luo Zheng would come up with something new.</p>

  <p>Keenan raised the silver flute in his hand and shoved it into the ground.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>A streak of silver light suddenly flashed from the upper end of the silver flute which stunned the spectators.</p>

  <p>"This isn't good."</p>

  <p>"Keenan is mad now!" one said.</p>

  <p>"Everyone, move back quickly!"</p>

  <p>Everyone rushed back to safety when they saw this.</p>
