  <p>
</p>

  <p>It wasn't that difficult to climb the stairs in the cemetery. As long as they seized the opportunity to make a move, they would meet no danger.</p>

  <p>Over the years, other than the first time that a Soul Sea Realm martial artist had died without knowing the situation in the tomb, no one else from the four divine kingdoms had ever died in it.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng and Fiona carefully returned to the fourth floor after the Soul Purifying Light had extinguished twice.</p>

  <p>As soon as the two of them were in front of him, War King Wind expressed his gratitude to Luo Luo Zheng. Then he and his men began to climb the stairs in the cemetery again.</p>

  <p>Most of the Soul Sea Realm martial artists managed to safely make it to the fifth, sixth, and seventh floors with more ease. But as they climbed higher, the time between each Soul Purifying Light became shorter and shorter.</p>

  <p>For them, the pressure wasn't too great. However, to Virtual Tribulation Realm martial artists like Fiona and Bram, the pressure was immensely greater.</p>

  <p>"Bram, Randy, climbing up is too difficult for you. Even if you make it there, you probably won't be able to occupy the bodies of those powerful martial artists. This floor should be your limit, so try to dwell on the corpses here," Turner said with his soul power.</p>

  <p>Although these martial artists had been dead for countless years, it was never an easy task to inhabit their corpses. The Soul Core could minimize the repulsion of the corpses, but the stronger the corpses were, the stronger the repulsive force would be.</p>

  <p>Bram, Randy, Fiona, and the other martial artists of the younger generation all nodded in agreement. Although they all had entered the Divine Emperor Secret Land with the help of the elder generation, it was a trial for them. But they were not required to obtain anything from this journey.</p>

  <p>"Let me help you open this coffin." War King Wind walked swiftly to the side of the platform. When he entered the hut, he purposely stood next to a coffin near him.</p>

  <p>Briefly, he closed his eyes and said a few words to himself before communicating through his consciousness, "These corpses have been here for countless years. You have to respect them."</p>

  <p>As he muttered these words, he stretched out his hands. Then like a wind, his hands changed their shapes and flowed smoothly along the grooves on the side of the coffin. When he felt that a part of his soul invaded the edge of the coffin, his soul fluctuated slightly, signifying that the soul power of the Fighting Soul Realm had burst out, thus lifting the coffin before everyone's eyes.</p>

  <p>Inside the coffin was a woman at the Life and Death Realm.</p>

  <p>Historically, it was unknown just what method the Dragon Lineage Human used to preserve the corpses. Even after so many years, it still hadn't shown any signs of decay. The woman still maintained her peerless appearance, wearing a light blue palace uniform. Apart from the pale complexion, she looked as if she was only sleeping.</p>

  <p>War King Wind asked, "Who will do it?"</p>

  <p>The moment he raised that question, everyone looked at him in surprise.</p>

  <p>Among the martial artists of the younger generation, only the crown princes and other outstanding princes could follow the kings here. And Fiona happened to be the only woman among them.</p>

  <p>Seeing everyone's confounded expression, War King Wind smiled awkwardly and stated, "Fiona, you control this corpse."</p>

  <p>Fiona's eyes blinked. She stared fixedly at the body within the coffin and then nodded. "Okay."</p>

  <p>Controlling a corpse was different from possessing one's body shell. And imbuing one's own soul into the corpse was not even a wonderful experience at all. However, it was the only way to enter the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land.</p>

  <p>Soon after, Fiona leaped onto the coffin as if she had no choice left. She looked hesitant as she looked at her father.</p>

  <p>War King Wind gave her a slight smile. Walking beside the coffin, he extended his hand and pressed it on the corpse's head. As if on cue, the corpse suddenly opened its mouth, and its eyes were also wide open.</p>

  <p>Fiona was a girl, after all. Although she acknowledged that the corpse wasn't frightening, she couldn't still hide her shock!</p>

  <p>"Don't be afraid. Just merge with it," War King Wind encouraged her.</p>

  <p>Fiona surveyed the corpse once more. Her face now was filled with grim determination. Then she began to drill into it.</p>

  <p>Shortly after, rays of grey light projected out from the head of the corpse.</p>

  <p>This light was the energy of the Soul Core which had fused with the soul previously. But after Fiona successfully merged with the corpse, it started to spread throughout the corpse.</p>

  <p>Occupying a corpse was completely different from taking one's body shell. The latter did not require the help of the Soul Core because the person being possessed was a living person with an intact body. It would only harm his soul.</p>

  <p>These corpses had already been existent for countless years. And it was apparent that all of their blood had dried up a long time ago. In this case, the Soul Core must be used to have their body activated forcibly.</p>

  <p>When the grey light merged fully with the corpse, the woman's fingers gingerly moved. Then after a few moments, her closed eyes suddenly opened slowly.</p>

  <p>Everyone stood there watching the whole scene when the corpse climbed out from the coffin. It had an extremely stiff posture. It was like a puppet that was not controlled well, as it took a tentative few steps forward in a strange way.</p>

  <p>Fiona couldn't control the corpse well at first. She was having a hard time, but her movements soon became more and more skilled. After some time of getting used to it, she pressed her legs together, and she stood in a very ladylike posture as she usually did, looking elegant.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng revealed a faint smile and continued to wear an amused expression as he thought that even though she was controlling a corpse, she still maintained her original habits.</p>

  <p>"I can control it now," Fiona exclaimed. Her voice completely changed as she was controlling a corpse.</p>

  <p>"Good job," War King Wind acknowledged. "We will help you open the other coffins, and then you can occupy the corpses."</p>

  <p>At his words, several powerful warriors of the Soul Sea Realm came forward and began opening the coffins, revealing the corpses. Except for the first one, which was a palace lady, the rest were all found to be males.</p>

  <p>All of these men wore golden armor. And they even had top-grade sacred weapons placed on their sides, which were more likely burial items.</p>

  <p>Randy, Crown Prince Bram, Callan, and the other princes occupied a corpse respectively without much further ado.</p>

  <p>The whole process did not take too much time in its entirety. It only took about five minutes. After they had taken possession of the corpses, Turner then turned his gaze towards Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He was wondering if Luo Luo Zheng could pick a corpse as well. He also contemplated the fact that Luo Luo Zheng was still a member of the younger generation in the eyes of those powerful warriors of the Soul Sea Realm, even if he had already advanced to the Life and Death Realm, and his own strength was hard to estimate.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Stellar Secret Land was indeed a place that was not easy to infiltrate. And a warrior must consider challenging a strong corpse to get through. With this, Luo Luo Zheng obviously wouldn't casually choose a corpse.</p>

  <p>Long before they could say anything, Luo Luo Zheng had already floated out, "I'll go up with you!"</p>

  <p>War King Wind chuckled and said, "Tianxing's soul is already close to the Jasper Fighting Soul Realm. It is much stronger than our souls. Surely, you have the qualifications to go up."</p>

  <p>So Luo Luo Zheng followed the group of Soul Sea Realm martial artists as they continued to climb up while avoiding the Soul Purifying Light.</p>

  <p>Fiona, Randy, and the others had their souls penetrated deep into their minds. Since they were all encased in bodies, the Soul Purifying Light wouldn't cause any damage to them. Hence, they didn't need to dodge the light at all but walked up the steps at ease.</p>

  <p>They all continued climbing up. On the eighth, ninth and tenth floors, the number of coffins became fewer and fewer while the corpses within the coffins became more and more powerful.</p>

  <p>Starting from the tenth floor, the corpses in the coffins had already reached the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>"I will choose this floor." A Soul Sea Realm martial artist stopped and occupied one of the corpses on the tenth floor with no qualms. His soul seemed to have just entered the Fighting Soul Realm. If not for Luo Luo Zheng excavating so many Soul Cores, he wouldn't have been able to enter the tomb this year.</p>

  <p>Besides, he wasn't confident in his soul's strength. Even if he went up there, he might die. So he decided to occupy a corpse on this floor.</p>

  <p>Still, on the tenth floor, powerful warriors of the Soul Sea Realm started to choose their own corpses one after another.</p>

  <p>On the eleventh and the twelfth floors, there were already sixty to seventy Soul Sea Realm martial artists who had already occupied a corpse.</p>

  <p>When they reached the thirteenth floor, most of them had already controlled a corpse, so they all came up the stairs with their bodies. Only Luo Luo Zheng, Turner, War King Wind, War Emperor York, and Scott had not chosen a corpse yet.</p>

  <p>The five of them set their gazes on the thirteenth floor, surveying the area.</p>
