<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Hey! Newbie! Are you from the Heart Flow Sect of the Taiyi Mountain?" Abdul squinted his eyes at the Evil God.</p>

  <p>A strong wave of evil energy emanated from him, which greatly displeased Abdul and the other senior disciples.</p>

  <p>The Evil God nodded. "Yes."</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you join the Land of Sword Grief with the others?" Abdul asked.</p>

  <p>The Evil God replied with a shrug, "I don't know."</p>

  <p>His less than elaborate reply was met with disapproval from Abdul and the others. "Forget it then. Just tell me your name so I can add it to the Ranking Stone."</p>

  <p>Since he came last, his name would be ranked at the lowest place.</p>

  <p>"My name is Evil God."</p>

  <p>Abdul was a bit taken aback and thought he had misheard.</p>

  <p>"What was that? Can you say that again?"</p>

  <p>"My name is Evil God," the newcomer repeated.</p>

  <p>"Haha!"</p>

  <p>His serious answer made the senior disciples burst into laughter.</p>

  <p>True Gods could lead long, amazing lives but none of them was cocky enough to call themselves 'Evil God.'</p>

  <p>This guy who dared to name himself 'Evil God' was a joke!</p>

  <p>As Abdul and the other senior disciples laughed, the Evil God stewed with restrained anger.</p>

  <p>Had it been in the past, he would've already killed them all.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng specifically instructed him to register with Abdul in order to get himself a cultivation room. The Evil God had no choice but to follow through with his creator's command, so he powered through the ridicule.</p>

  <p>"Go and register his name," Abdul said to a disciple once they were done laughing.</p>

  <p>It was a fairly straightforward process and soon enough, the Evil God's name had been added to the Ranking Stone.</p>

  <p>Abdul then proceeded to tell the Evil God the rules: he had the qualifications to challenge everyone on the first floor on his first day and only after he got a rank could he get his own cultivation room.</p>

  <p>"Including you?" the Evil God asked. Abdul couldn't help but scoff in amusement, "Yes, including me but only if you dare!"</p>

  <p>"I see." The Evil God nodded in understanding before giving Abdul a determined look. "I'll challenge you then."</p>

  <p>The sudden declaration made Abdul freeze, not really knowing how to respond.</p>

  <p>It wasn't just him. Everyone who heard was also rendered speechless by the Evil God's sudden challenge.</p>

  <p>"Is he an idiot?"</p>

  <p>"He must really be crazy then. I mean, who names themselves Evil God?"</p>

  <p>Abdul cleared his throat before giving the challenger a mocking smile.</p>

  <p>"Well, since you dare challenge me, then there's no way I can refuse!"</p>

  <p>Ever since their several shameful defeats by the new disciples, it seemed everyone had begun looking down on the senior disciples of the first floor.</p>

  <p>This challenge was seen as an opportunity by Abdul. Perhaps it was time to show his strength to gain back the respect owed to them.</p>

  <p>"Where should I challenge you then?" the Evil God asked.</p>

  <p>"Follow me. We're going to the arena!" Abdul instructed. He nodded at the Evil God and went towards the back door of the Land of Sword Grief.</p>

  <p>"A new disciple is going to challenge Abdul!"</p>

  <p>"The battle is about to begin!"</p>

  <p>"Abdul has made some progress! This is going to be interesting! Don't miss it, everyone! We'll be able to see his current level through this battle!"</p>

  <p>There were still two days left before the new month started and most people in the Land of Sword Grief had already exhausted their challenge rights.</p>

  <p>This fight was the first in quite a while.</p>

  <p>Of course, it attracted a lot of attention.</p>

  <p>With Luo Zheng occupying the Myriad Spirits City, the new disciples who were close to him got the most benefits, followed by Abdul. It had been his responsibility to guard the stronghold of the Taiyi Heaven Palace before Luo Zheng after all.</p>

  <p>Since it was said that Abdul's strength had greatly improved, then it might be possible for him to finally reach the top thirty on the first floor. He hadn't given a definite answer when someone asked him about it, but it was pretty obvious that he changed a lot in Stage Fourteen.</p>

  <p>Everyone was eager to see just how much he'd improved.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Chaim was busy informing Luo Zheng of what happened in the Taiyi Heaven Palace. "Dorothy hasn't come to the Land of Sword Grief in days?"</p>

  <p>Chaim nodded. "Yes. I haven't been seeing her lately."</p>

  <p>Everyone knew about Ying and Dorothy's relationship and now that the former was in trouble, it was only natural for the latter to feel bad about it.</p>

  <p>It seemed Dorothy no longer had the time to come to the Land of Sword Grief to cultivate, but Luo Zheng wasn't sure if she had gone to the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Ying's matter was related to the top masters in the Source World, which was beyond Luo Zheng's scope. He could do nothing about it.</p>

  <p>At that moment, several cheers and shouts interrupted their conversation.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng frowned when he heard what the senior disciples were saying.</p>

  <p>"Challenge Abdul?"</p>

  <p>Even Chaim frowned in confusion. "He should have the strength to challenge Cleon, right?" asked him.</p>

  <p>A lot of the new disciples, Chaim included, didn't like the Evil God mostly due to the fact that he slaughtered the disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace back in the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>However, since the Evil God had been caught by Luo Zheng, they had to let him go.</p>

  <p>They were well aware of his strength though. The Evil God was no weaker than Luo Zheng so it was a bit of a waste for him to challenge Abdul.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng waved his hand dismissively. "Come, let's go to the arena and watch."</p>

  <p>Abdul was already standing on the arena.</p>

  <p>His eyes were full of desire as he regarded his opponent below.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had asked Chaim to help him deal with everything in the Myriad Spirits City, so the latter was extremely busy.</p>

  <p>Abdul had guarded the Myriad Spirits City on behalf of the Taiyi Heaven Palace and was very familiar with the races that resided in the city. Back when he eliminated the remaining members of the Dark Bear race, he was able to come upon a very unique Other Shore Token. This token was at least the fifth grade and he'd taken it for himself without telling anyone.</p>

  <p>He was able to break through to the top ten with the aid of the token.</p>

  <p>Today, since he was challenged by the Evil God, he figured it would be a good idea to bring it out.</p>

  <p>"Please come up." He gestured to his opponent.</p>

  <p>The Evil God stepped onto the arena wordlessly, only emanating a faint evil energy. Back then, his energy alone had been enough to send his opponents running but now, he had to restrain himself.</p>

  <p>Those new disciples watching with eagerness all became confused when they saw him step up onto the platform.</p>

  <p>"Why is he here?"</p>

  <p>"Wasn't he supposed to be taken back into Luo Zheng's inner world?"</p>

  <p>"Hasn't he been defeated already? How was he able to reach the Chaotic Source Realm?"</p>

  <p>Seeing the Evil God in front of them was like a nightmare for these new disciples. Nobody really wanted to see him ever again.</p>

  <p>Yet here he stood in the Land of Sword Grief, unharmed and well.</p>
