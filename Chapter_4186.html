<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>A deep voice cut through the quiet air. "Judging from your attitude, it seems that you don't want to talk about the alliance any more." Luo Zheng tightened his grip on Lawler's wing and coldly added, "Or do you think that I'm a human, who doesn't have the strength or qualifications?"</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng said those words, his vice-like grip on Lawler's wing became even more rigid.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh..."</p>

  <p>At that moment, a straight, thin red thread materialized and punctured Lawler's wing.</p>

  <p>"Swish, swish, swish..."</p>

  <p>Everyone present heard the sound of the thin thread piercing through Lawler's wing, which was followed by countless rays of red light that floated atop the wing's surface.</p>

  <p>"Splash..."</p>

  <p>Then, the red light cut the wing into several pieces, which fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>Manuel, who squatted somewhere not far away, also saw the scene. A chill ran down his spine.</p>

  <p>He had heard Tearrag talk about this token of Luo Zheng before. The token let Luo Zheng cut bodies into pieces quickly with the help of blood streaks.</p>

  <p>However, Manuel thought that he was much stronger than Tearrag, so he did not take Luo Zheng seriously.</p>

  <p>Then again, Lawler was just as powerful as him, and Lawler could not defend himself in the slightest against Luo Zheng's red thread. Perhaps if he touched that red thread, he too, would be seriously injured.</p>

  <p>"Lawler, I wonder if this strength could be considered powerful in your eyes?" Luo Zheng asked coldly.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng uttered those words, both Lawler and the Grandmaster of Heaven were stunned.</p>

  <p>After all, Lawler never thought that this human could hurt him.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, such injuries naturally meant nothing to the Treacherous Being.</p>

  <p>Lawler trembled slightly, and the Treacherous Being's body parts that fell to the ground jumped up one by one. Then, they quickly stuck to each other until they returned to their previous shape.</p>

  <p>"You surprised me," Lawler muttered, the arrogance in his eyes completely gone now.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's attack was like a waterfall that splashed straight into his heart and cleared his mind.</p>

  <p>Indeed, both the Monkey Spirit King and the Great Ape King were not stupid. There was certainly a reason they supported Luo Zheng so much!</p>

  <p>"Let's continue to talk about the alliance," Luo Zheng calmly stated.</p>

  <p>"Didn't you just refuse?" Lawler said in surprise.</p>

  <p>"That's because your condition is not right," Luo Zheng said with a shake of his head.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?"</p>

  <p>When the Grandmaster of Heaven heard Lawler ask such a question, he could not help but sigh inwardly.</p>

  <p>Although Lawler was powerful, he did not know how to negotiate.</p>

  <p>He had been quite arrogant to the humans ever since the beginning, but Luo Zheng had managed to get some information out of him. He had revealed that the Bird Spirit King was currently in an unfavorable situation and that they could not get the upper hand if they did things recklessly.</p>

  <p>If he asked Luo Zheng what he wanted now, then Luo Zheng would surely demand many benefits.</p>

  <p>"The condition for this alliance to take place is that all the members of the Bird Spirit Sect must obey my orders," Luo Zheng answered.</p>

  <p>Lawler's anger, which he had restrained, rose again.</p>

  <p>This human being did make him exceptionally mad!</p>

  <p>"You even want our Bird Spirit Sect to obey your orders! Does the Monkey Spirit Sect also listen to you?" he screeched, his high-pitched voice laced with grief and resentment.</p>

  <p>He said these words to the Great Ape King.</p>

  <p>Yet, Manuel only said, "It's okay to listen to him. That's what our king said..."</p>

  <p>The monkey spirits also weren't good at strategy, so they just handed over the tasks that required such a skill to this group of humans.</p>

  <p>When Lawler knew about it, he felt even more enraged. Was this really the once invincible Monkey Spirit Sect?</p>

  <p>Disheartened, he turned around to leave, but in reality, he could not leave like this.</p>

  <p>Even the Bird Masters couldn't stand the current situation, so they had to get the Monkey Spirit Sect's strong support.</p>

  <p>After Lawler thought carefully for a while, he gritted his teeth and said,</p>

  <p>"It's alright to listen to you. All of the Bird Masters are at your disposal, but there are two exceptions!"</p>

  <p>"Please go ahead," said Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"First, our king will not listen to you; and second, the Source World and the Evil God are also exempted," Lawler replied.</p>

  <p>The Bird Spirit Sect would never put their king in danger. After all, Sheehan had yet to awaken, and he was much weaker than the Snake Spirit King.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the Source World and the Evil God were two essential keys that could allow the Bird Spirit Sect to turn the tables. They had already caught Duran and the others' attention. Furthermore, Lawler knew well about the conflict and relationship between Luo Zheng and the Evil God.</p>

  <p>"Okay, but I'll be in charge of the top ten Bird Masters' coordinates," said Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>In reality, Luo Zheng did not trust the Bird Masters at all. Moreover, the Bird Spirit Sect could become his enemies at any time because of the Evil God.</p>

  <p>Therefore, he had to have these Treacherous Beings' coordinates in his hands.</p>

  <p>At that point, Lawler slightly hesitated to grant Luo Zheng's request. First and foremost, the coordinates were their lives.</p>

  <p>He stalled for a moment and asked, "Will you... really help us fight against the Snake Spirit Sect?"</p>

  <p>"Of course," Luo Zheng answered with a smile. "The Snake Spirit Sect must be our common enemy. Even if we don't ally with the Bird Spirit Sect, we will still fight them head-on," he added.</p>

  <p>"Then next time I will bring the other Bird Masters' coordinates..."</p>

  <p>As soon as Lawler finished speaking, a ball of Light of Annihilation burst out from his neck. Countless small lightning bolts wrapped around his body. As a result, his massive body quickly exploded and disappeared, and only the coordinates in the Grandmaster of Heaven's hands remained.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven put away the coordinates, looked at Luo Zheng and said, "Goodbye!"</p>

  <p>Even when he was about to leave, he did not talk to his two senior fellow disciples at all.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven stared blankly at the Grandmaster of Heaven's receding figure. "He still takes those matters to heart," he muttered.</p>

  <p>"Some people are destined to travel on a single path. Don't force them. As for the alliance with the Bird Spirit Sect, I do not know if they are sincere or not," the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord said calmly.</p>

  <p>"They are sincere," the real Snake Goddess replied.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded in agreement and said, "Since the Bird Spirit King has not awakened yet, they have no other choice. The Bird Masters can help us!"</p>

  <p>"But there's one thing that's quite strange," the real Snake Goddess said with a frown. "Since the Bird Spirit Sect is completely weak, why didn't the Snake Spirit Sect kill them together with the Bird Spirit King? Was there anything else to it?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Not to mention, the people present and even the Bird Masters could not figure out why the Snake Spirit King had let the Bird Spirit King go that day.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, when Lawler returned to the nest in Jade Pure Realm, he told the other Bird Masters about Luo Zheng's request.</p>

  <p>When Dural, Orval, and the other Bird Masters heard the news, they felt furious.</p>

  <p>To give their lives to a mere human being?</p>

  <p>That was way too much!</p>

  <p>What a wishful thought!</p>

  <p>However, the commotion only lasted for a short while. After Lawler analyzed the advantages and disadvantages, as well as the fate of the Bird Spirit Sect, the Bird Masters all fell silent.</p>

  <p>It was true that they had no other choice.</p>

  <p>In the end, the Bird Masters made a compromise and bowed in front of the Bird Spirit King.</p>

  <p>Of course, they never dared to tell the Bird Spirit King, Sheehan, what truly happened. Although Sheehan had not awakened yet, he would surely turn the world upside down once he heard about the matter.</p>

  <p>It also went without saying that the Snake Spirit King in the Heavenly Square City saw the scene with the Limited Omnipotent Stone.</p>

  <p>"Why? Why don't we stop them?" the Snake Spirit King asked desperately.</p>

  <p>"Why should we? Are you afraid of so many Bird Masters?" the black light asked back.</p>

  <p>"Of course I'm not afraid of the Bird Masters," the Snake Spirit King said disdainfully.</p>

  <p>"Once the Bird Masters join, it would make them enter the Jade Pure Realm faster," the black light said.</p>

  <p>"Tell me. What the hell do you want to do?" the Snake Spirit King asked.</p>

  <p>The black light didn't answer, but it surprisingly burst into laughter.</p>
