<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng had to integrate the different kinds of internal momentum in his inner world before he could fight the enemy with the Ways-blending Strike in the divine land.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the Evil God watched him every single time he merged the internal momentum.</p>

  <p>The Evil God certainly felt how strong the power of the Ways-blending Energy was, and that was why he also tried to fuse the Godly Ways.</p>

  <p>In executing this, the Evil God used Zheng's experience with the matter as his reference.</p>

  <p>When Zheng had merged the Godly Ways in his own inner world, he didn't hide anything at all. The Evil God had observed his every move, even the proportions and the sequence of different kinds of internal momentum that Zheng had activated.</p>

  <p>By closely watching Zheng's movements, the Evil God, in his own way, found a shortcut. As far as Zheng knew, the Ways-blending Energy would become very unstable after 2, 500 Godly Ways were merged. Merging one more Godly Way could create a very terrible explosion.</p>

  <p>But unexpectedly, the Evil God had already merged 2, 994 Godly Ways successfully.</p>

  <p>He could complete the Godly Ways Great Unity as long as he fused the remaining six Godly Ways!</p>

  <p>Taking a deep and long look at the Evil God, Zheng could not understand why there was such a supernormal talent appearing in his inner world.</p>

  <p>"Can you practice the merging of the Godly Ways?" Zheng asked as he stared at the Evil God.</p>

  <p>In fact, in his inner world, Zheng could easily find out how the Evil God's fusion of the Godly Ways worked, but he still wanted to see it with his own eyes.</p>

  <p>"Okay," the Evil God agreed and nodded.</p>

  <p>Being very smart, the Evil God perceived the value of the merging of Godly Ways. He also knew that there was nothing in the world that he could hide from Zheng. With this, the Evil God knew that it was better for him to use his skill openly.</p>

  <p>But just as the Evil God was about to fuse the internal momentum, Zheng suddenly uttered, "Wait!"</p>

  <p>"Huh? What's wrong?" the Evil God could not help but ask in puzzlement upon being halted.</p>

  <p>"I have a friend who needs to see this," Zheng responded as he activated his spiritual sense which spread out of his inner world. At that time, he was summoning No. 9527.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 had always said that the 3, 000 Godly Ways were not possible to be fused together. Now Zheng wanted it to have a look to confirm if any of it was true.</p>

  <p>After receiving Zheng's invitation, No. 9527 immediately entered Zheng's inner world.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Evil God, Nelly, and Liusu were all amazed upon seeing the green light ball. Even though this light ball's soul force was not at all that strong, it was still mysterious as it drew their attention.</p>

  <p>"Can you take on a different shape?" Zheng asked, looking at the light ball.</p>

  <p>"Of course."</p>

  <p>After No. 9527's reply, the green light ball immediately turned into a seed.</p>

  <p>Afterwards, a huge eyeball grew from the seed. Covered in blood, it looked very terrifying.</p>

  <p>Zheng, Nelly, and Liusu frowned at the sight of the eyeball.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in Zheng's opinion, No. 9527's taste in its appearance was extremely bad. In such disappointment, he waved his hand in the air.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, countless pieces of broken stones appeared out of thin air, quickly melting into a mold of a handsome young man. However, this man was only a puppet, without any trace of flesh or blood.</p>

  <p>Once more, No. 9527 turned into a green light and went into the body of the puppet. Afterwards, it made some seemingly strange movements with the puppet's face and tried to adapt to the body of the puppet.</p>

  <p>Not long after, No. 9527 finished what it was doing.</p>

  <p>Zheng said to the Evil God, "Okay, you may now start."</p>

  <p>Nodding, the Evil God closed his eyes and sat down cross-legged.</p>

  <p>In fact, Zheng was very familiar with the scene that wisps of internal momentum quickly merged within his inner world.</p>

  <p>The more Godly Ways were fused, the more powerful and more violent the energy contained within the Evil God's body became.</p>

  <p>Shocked and scared, both Nelly and Liusu could not help but take a step back under the pressure of the energy.</p>

  <p>If it weren't for the fact that they truly believed in Zheng, then they would have escaped that instant.</p>

  <p>Right at that time, the Evil God looked calm and relaxed, as if he could easily handle the situation at hand. Turning to Zheng, he said, "So, I've already fused 2, 600 Godly Ways. Do I still need to continue with the fusion?"</p>

  <p>"I see. Move on. I want to see your limitations," Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>When Zheng sent the information through his spiritual sense to it moments ago, No. 9527 was surprised.</p>

  <p>In fact, it had mocked Zheng several times before for it thought Zheng did such a useless attempt. It firmly believed that fusing 3, 000 Godly Ways into one was an impossible task. However, there was a person inside Zheng's inner world who had actually merged 2, 994 Godly Ways before, which was out of No. 9527's imagination.</p>

  <p>The Evil God only nodded, while he continued to concentrate on his merging of the Godly Ways.</p>

  <p>2, 700 Godly Ways...</p>

  <p>2, 800 Godly Ways...</p>

  <p>2, 900 Godly Ways...</p>

  <p>After 2, 900 Godly Ways were merged, the difficulty would be doubled each time a new Godly Way's internal momentum was activated and added.</p>

  <p>Even if the Evil God had once fused the Godly Ways smoothly, it could still slow him down.</p>

  <p>As he fused more and more Godly Ways, the Ways-blending Energy's pressure in his body only grew more intense. Seeing this, both Nelly and Liusu became even more surprised.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing such a scene in front of him, Zheng lifted his hand and waved it.</p>

  <p>Afterwards, a layer of pale green light film enveloped the two women and separated them from the outside world.</p>

  <p>2, 991...</p>

  <p>2, 992...</p>

  <p>As the Evil God reached the 2, 992nd Godly Way, his body began trembling, and the internal momentum in his inner world became more and more unstable.</p>

  <p>At this point, the fusion was becoming more erratic, and once the Ways-blending Energy collapsed, the power caused by this collapse would be enough to tear him apart!</p>

  <p>Being a man of valor and bravery, the Evil God was fearless as he was not afraid of anything that could come across his path. After all, he had long been aloof to the thought of life and death for he only focused on pursuing strength. Apart from that, he was that person who even dared to plot something against Zheng before.</p>

  <p>2, 993!</p>

  <p>2, 994!</p>

  <p>Now, the Evil God was at his limit. If another Godly Way was added to the fusion, then it would be his last straw and death would surely take him.</p>

  <p>With his face turning red, the blood vessels all over his body were all about to burst from all the pressure. Raising his hands, he pulled out the Ways-blending Energy from his body, roaring loudly, "Go!"</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished his words, the Ways-blending Energy shot high up into the sky at a rapid speed.</p>

  <p>When it flew past a star formed by the strength source, it somehow exploded with terrifying energy.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, a thunderous and loud voice resonated through the sky.</p>

  <p>The Evil God cracked a smile upon seeing the Ways-blending Energy's explosion, beads of sweat trickling down his forehead.</p>

  <p>When Zheng and No. 9527 were looking up, their eyes were filled with shock.</p>

  <p>Due to the limitation of the rules of the world, the Evil God couldn't reach the consummate level theurgies of the Godly Ways. That was why the power that he exerted while using Godly Ways was surely not as formidable as the one Zheng exerted. However, even if such theurgies were lacking, the Ways-blending Energy's power released from him was almost as great as that from Zheng!</p>

  <p>"It's unbelievable. I can't believe that the living creature in your inner world is able to get the Ways-blending Energy to this stage," No. 9527 spoke in utmost disbelief.</p>

  <p>Zheng replied, "There are only six Godly Ways left. Do you still want to stick to your original opinion?"</p>

  <p>Smacking its lips, No. 9527 spoke, "It is impossible to achieve the Godly Ways Great Unity again. That is the absolute rule. Even if someone has merged 2, 999 Godly Ways, I would still have the same opinion... However, it is indeed an extraordinary method to take the Ways-blending Energy as a theurgy and cultivate it."</p>
