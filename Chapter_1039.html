<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1039 Threat </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Ethereal Spirit Sect had been plunged into complete chaos.</p>

  <p>Back when they had attacked the place, the members of the Heavenly Evil Sect were arrogant and completely ruthless.</p>

  <p>Rather than just taking over the sect, they had also desecrated it. The carved plaque with the words "Ethereal Spirit Sect" that had decorated the Ethereal Spirit Hall in the past had been shattered and replaced by the invaders. The new plaque weighed more than ten thousand pounds and was gilded with sparkling gold. It read "Heavenly Evil Sect" which signified the complete takeover of the entire headquarters.</p>

  <p>It was a pity that such a grand plaque only hung for a few months.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Evil Sect was like a meteor that had risen in the sky but ended up crashing into the earth later on. The independent warriors that had joined thought they would be able to lead a peaceful and noble life in the Central Region, but the death of their leader changed all that.</p>

  <p>It also did not help that most of the independent warriors that had joined had no loyalty ties to the sect. They merely joined but were not necessarily trained and molded by the Heavenly Evil Sect. At first, they couldn't escape because of the elders, but once the elders themselves fled, the warriors soon followed.</p>

  <p>Eden had been left behind and stayed in the Ethereal Spirit Hall. Beside him were two women who had their six senses sealed off: Yan, and Owen's lover. Both possessed the Purple Power Body.</p>

  <p>Their senses had been sealed until Eddie could find the third and final Purple Power Body. Through this secret technique, the two women's cultivation base had already reached the middle stage of the Internal Elixir Realm.</p>

  <p>Eden sat on the large dragon throne, yet this was the most powerless moment of his entire life.</p>

  <p>Everything had been so different just a few months ago. He had happily visualized the future of the Heavenly Evil Divine Kingdom as the sole power in the entire Central Region. His father would be the king, and he would be the crown prince. They would be strong and unshakeable, and no one in Central Region would be able to resist them.</p>

  <p>But now, everything had come crashing down around him and he realized how childish his past dreams were.</p>

  <p>It was only then that he realized that Luo Zheng was his and his father's invincible opponent.</p>

  <p>But did it really matter at this point? Wasn't it already too late? He had nowhere else to go. There were still a few independent warriors within their Heavenly Evil Sect but they could all flee and conceal their identities.</p>

  <p>Eden might've been a divine-level talent but his father was now dead, and he was surely next. He knew that they would scour the entire area for him, especially Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He had no place to hide so he figured that it might be better for him to just lie in wait and face his fate calmly.</p>

  <p>If he had the chance, he had to avenge his father's death.</p>

  <p>He looked at the two women beside him. "Luo Zheng…since you've killed my father, I will kill your sister right in front of your very eyes," he mumbled crazily. "Losing this war means losing everything. I have become miserable because of you and you will have to pay!"</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...</p>

  <p>A few beams of light appeared as both Luo Zheng and Owen arrived at the Ethereal Spirit Hall's entrance. Both of them were anxious as they entered the hall.</p>

  <p>Eden looked up and couldn't help but feel an instinctive fear the moment he saw Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Back in the Martial Arts Contest, Luo Zheng had shattered his warrior spirit and gave him an indelible memory that he would never forget his entire life.</p>

  <p>However, now was not the time to think back on such things. Eden straightened his back and pretended to be calm in the face of his own fear.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng! You're here!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng ignored Eden as his gaze fell on his two hostages: Yan and the woman beside her. "Let them go," he ordered Eden. "Let them go and I will give you a painless death and let your body remain whole."</p>

  <p>Eden's eyes flashed with madness. "Let them go?</p>

  <p>Dream on!"</p>

  <p>He shouted before standing up from his throne. He raised his hand and used his life vitality, transforming it into thin threads that coiled around his hostages' necks.</p>

  <p>These life vitality threads were thin but extremely sharp. One gentle pull would be enough to behead the two women in a flash.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng remained calm but Owen couldn't bear such a sight. "Stop!" he roared before suddenly rushing towards Eden.</p>

  <p>Eden laughed and gently lifted his finger. The threads suddenly tightened and broke the skin on Owen's lover's neck, drawing out some blood.</p>

  <p>The sight made Owen freeze in his tracks.</p>

  <p>"If you dare make a move towards me, I'll make sure to split her body in two!"</p>

  <p>Eden roared. He knew he was going to die but at least he'd be able to satisfy himself with the thought that he could take away their precious people before he left.</p>

  <p>Owen clenched his fists tightly in anger. "What do you want?" he asked through gritted teeth.</p>

  <p>"Well, I just want you… to pay a price."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng glared coldly at Eden. "If you let them go, I won't kill you."</p>

  <p>Eden could not help but laugh at Zheng's new proposition. "Really? You're going to spare my life?</p>

  <p>You give in so quickly, Luo Zheng. It's quite disappointing."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did not speak. He had not fully figured out Eden's thoughts and intentions but he knew that it might not be safe for his sister if they provoked him.</p>

  <p>The situation was very volatile. Eden could kill both women instantly but he insisted on keeping them as hostages. There must be a motive.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" Luo Zheng repeated the question.</p>

  <p>"I'm a divine-level talent but you will only spare my life? How do you intend to compensate me for everything that I have lost?</p>

  <p>I do not need anything Luo Zheng. I only want to kill them!"</p>

  <p>Eden had fully snapped at this point, and his eyes were mad with rage as he looked at the warrior in front of him. "My father is dead and so is the Heavenly Evil Sect. I have nothing left to live for, and it's all because of you, Luo Zheng. It's all because of you!"</p>

  <p>His words were heavy but Luo Zheng could care less what he felt. He simply glared at Eden and did not say anything.</p>

  <p>Dillon, Hobbes and others were worried about the current situation.</p>

  <p>They were not afraid of whatever Eden could've asked for. As long as it was within their sphere of power, they were willing to make a compromise and even spare his life. With the Heavenly Evil Sect gone, Eden did not really pose a significant threat to them.</p>

  <p>However, the young man was completely out of his mind. He had lost all sense of self-preservation and his heart had been fully occupied with revenge.</p>

  <p>When one had no desire, one must be strong and fearless. This was exactly how Eden could be described. The most troublesome thing was that he still held Zheng's sister and Owen's lover hostage.</p>

  <p>Dillon and the others could now surmise what Eden truly wanted. Luo Zheng was also able to come to the same conclusion after a while. This guy only desired revenge and wanted to kill Yan in front of him!</p>

  <p>How could he protect Yan's life?</p>

  <p>How could he eliminate Eden as fast as possible?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng wasn't so confident about the situation. His movement speed was fast and he knew he could kill Eden in the blink of an eye using his forceful energy and his Cloud-chasing Lion talent. However, Eden's life vitality threads wrapped tightly around Yan's neck and just one slight move of his finger could kill her.</p>

  <p>No matter how fast he could move, Eden would be faster.</p>

  <p>"You look very calm," Eden remarked. "But I know you're just pretending. I can see that you're very scared!"</p>

  <p>"You're right," Luo Zheng affirmed.</p>

  <p>"I am indeed afraid that you would kill my sister. But…"</p>

  <p>"But what?" Eden asked.</p>

  <p>"But..." Just as he spoke, Luo Zheng circulated his forceful energy and took a step forward.</p>

  <p>However, as he had thought, Eden was quicker and more vigilant than him.</p>

  <p>Zheng's figure only flashed for a moment but Eden's finger had already tightened and drew more blood out of the two women's necks.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>Owen shouted, hurriedly stopping Luo Zheng from advancing.</p>

  <p>"You take me for a fool?" Eden smirked at the two.</p>

  <p>"Do you, Luo Zheng?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng could only grit his teeth and glare at Eden in rage. The siege of the Ethereal Spirit Sect seemed to be backfiring on him. Had he known that this was going to happen, he would've just figured out a way to sneak into the sect and covertly rescue his sister. Luo Zheng truly did not anticipate Eden's intentions and behavior.</p>

  <p>Eden, on the other hand, was just waiting for Luo Zheng to arrive so that he could kill Yan in front of him.</p>

  <p>This was all exactly what Eden wanted and they were now all playing by his rules.</p>
