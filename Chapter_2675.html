<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Only a few top-rank True Gods were within the radius of ten thousand feet around the tablet.</p>

  <p>They were all surrounded by lightning snakes, just like Zheng was.</p>

  <p>The top-rank True Gods had a deep understanding of the Thunderstorm Godly Way. They were comprehending here so that they could get a chance to master the consummate theurgy of the Thunderstorm Godly Way and become consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>But within the numerous divine eras that had passed, only a few among the large number of top-rank True Gods had succeeded in becoming consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>Zheng was still some distance away from the Godly Way Tablet when an old man, who was sitting on the ground, spoke to him, "Young man, although you are talented and aren't afraid of the pressure of the internal momentum, you have to comprehend the Godly Way step by step. You are just a low-rank True God. You don't have to be so close to it."</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled and bowed to the old man. "Thank you for your kind reminder. But I have a different purpose of getting close to the Godly Way Tablet."</p>

  <p>The old man didn't talk but his eyes were filled with doubt.</p>

  <p>Zheng came to a standstill when he was a hundred feet away from the Godly Way Tablet.</p>

  <p>The entire Godly Way Tablet was roaring.</p>

  <p>Huge lightning dragons circled madly around Zheng, roaring as they made to tear him apart.</p>

  <p>But Zheng remained steady as before, standing there unhesitating in the face of the danger.</p>

  <p>This distance between him and the Godly Way Tablet was enough for him to start taking action.</p>

  <p>Now that he was facing the Godly Way Tablet of the Thunderstorm Godly Way, Zheng activated the Infinity Ruler in his mind. .</p>

  <p>The edge of the Infinity Ruler flashed in Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, two golden circles of light appeared around Zheng's pupils.</p>

  <p>"Absorb the Thunderstorm Godly Way again!"</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>The Infinity Ruler continued to vibrate. Once the Thunderstorm Godly Way had been absorbed, the lightning sign on the scale of the ruler became rounder and fuller.</p>

  <p>The Godly Ways that Zheng had absorbed from the consummate True Gods were consummate.</p>

  <p>When Zheng had been in the Consulting God Hall, he had absorbed the Purple Aura Godly Way from the Godly Way Tablet that Joy had created.</p>

  <p>But she hadn't comprehended the consummate theurgy, the Purple Sky Land of the Purple Aura Godly Way, when she had made the Godly Way Tablet. So Zheng's Purple Aura Godly Way remained incomplete.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, if he absorbed the Godly Way from a low-rank True God, he could own the theurgies, but only with the first two levels.</p>

  <p>Now that he was facing the Godly Way Tablet of the Thunderstorm Godly Way, his Thunderstorm Godly Way had become consummate. Zheng could now freely utilize the first three levels, the last three levels, and even the consummate level of the Thunderstorm Godly Way.</p>

  <p>Once the mark on the Infinity Ruler was full, the Godly Tile of the Thunderstorm Godly Way in Zheng's inner world became near-consummate. The light that reflected through the Godly Tile also began to become complete.</p>

  <p>Zheng stood there like a fool, attracting a number of surprised gazes from behind him.</p>

  <p>Everyone was whispering to each other, irrespective of whether they were top-rank True Gods, low-rank True Gods, or proving godly warriors.</p>

  <p>They didn't know what Zheng wanted to do and the kind of strength that he had.</p>

  <p>After a long while, a satisfied smile appeared on Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>He made to remove the pair of golden pupils when something strange happened.</p>

  <p>A pattern in the shape of a triangle appeared at the center of the Godly Way Tablet. At its core was a small eye.</p>

  <p>An arc of light suddenly shot out of the eye and shot straight into Zheng's mind, passing through his soul, and connecting with the Infinity Ruler.</p>

  <p>The beam of light might have pierced Zheng's soul, but he barely felt it.</p>

  <p>He felt a slight pain, like a needle pricking him, and a miracle revealed itself in his mind.</p>

  <p>"What's this?"</p>

  <p>Zheng exclaimed in disbelief.</p>

  <p>Many black Godly Way Tablets emerged in his mind.</p>

  <p>"The locations of the three thousand Godly Way Tablets?"</p>

  <p>The three thousand Godly Way Tablets were scattered in the divine land, each separated by a certain distance. The tips of these Godly Way Tablets were all linked to the arc-shaped light.</p>

  <p>But now, the other two thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine Godly Way Tablets were blacked out while only the Godly Way Tablet of the Thunderstorm Godly Way before Zheng was lit up.</p>

  <p>"This is the guidance!" Zheng's eyes brightened. "Is the Infinity Ruler going to lead me to light up all the Godly Way Tablets?"</p>

  <p>Since the locations of most of the Godly Way Tablets in the divine land had been recorded, it was now easy to find them.</p>

  <p>But the locations of a few of the Godly Way Tablets were strictly secret.</p>

  <p>"This Godly Way Tablet of the Earth Godly Way is located in the Lofty Tree. Since it has turned into a dead land, ordinary people cannot get close.</p>

  <p>This is the Godly Way Tablet of the Evolution Godly Way. My father was the first person to fully comprehend it and mark it with his name.</p>

  <p>The Godly Way Tablet of the Emotion Closing Godly Way? Why has it been thrown into the Time Sea? Has someone transferred it to the Time Sea, or..."</p>

  <p>Zheng continued to observe it all with great interest.</p>

  <p>He had long planned to absorb all the three thousand Godly Ways, but he had never had this opportunity before.</p>

  <p>But now, with the Infinity Ruler's guidance, Zheng was even more determined to do that. He wanted to know what would happen after he absorbed all the three thousand Godly Ways.</p>

  <p>Zheng turned to look at the True Gods behind him.</p>

  <p>Their gazes were still locked on Zheng, so they didn't notice the triangle and eye on the Godly Way Tablet.</p>

  <p>And when Zheng stopped using his golden eyes, the triangle and eye disappeared as well.</p>

  <p>He smiled as he left the Godly Way Tablet.</p>

  <p>It wasn't easy to light up three thousand Godly Way Tablets. He had finally returned to the divine land and he had to return to the fairy palace first.</p>

  <p>When Zheng stepped out of the thunder pool, the three top-rank True Gods of the Fang Clan looked at him warily.</p>

  <p>Zheng's smile was actually scaring the three top-rank True Gods.</p>

  <p>Zheng had been able to go up to a distance of one hundred feet from the Godly Way Tablet, which had taken them by surprise.</p>

  <p>Only a consummate True God was qualified to do that.</p>

  <p>Before Zheng did that, these three True Gods had been plotting to kill him.</p>

  <p>But now, this idea had already vanished. It was obvious that this young man was powerful.</p>

  <p>When Zheng was about to leave, tens of consummate True Gods from the powerful clans on the Floating Islands arrived at the large regions through the transmission arrays.</p>

  <p>They had received an order to check the space channels of the thirteen regions.</p>

  <p>These space channels were marked and were located in the thirteen regions. The consummate True Gods could look for the exact locations of the marks.</p>

  <p>"The space channel marked in the Square Sky Region is very close to the Fang Clan's Square Sky City. It seems to be next to the Godly Way Tablet of the Thunderstorm Godly Way," Shahn said, staring off into the distance.</p>

  <p>"There are thirteen space channels. Who knows which channel that person has walked out of? Moreover, that person might leave even before we get there. If that happens, tracking down that warrior will be like looking for a needle in a haystack!" Rachelle retorted beside Shahn.</p>
