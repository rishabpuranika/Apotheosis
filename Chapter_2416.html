<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2416 Luo Zheng's Limit </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Hayden's face lit up in excitement and anticipation.</p>

  <p>The very moment that Luo Zheng had entered the city, he could already sense that Luo Zheng was an extraordinary person.</p>

  <p>Yet he had never expected that Luo Zheng would collect the fourteen Truth Spiritual Swords with such ease.</p>

  <p>He had good knowledge of the arrangement of the Truth Spiritual Swords.</p>

  <p>It was reasonably easy to get the first three Truth Spiritual Swords, but the fourth to ninth ones were quite tricky to obtain.</p>

  <p>As for the tenth to seventeenth Truth Spiritual Swords, the difficulty was a whole different level altogether!</p>

  <p>The last time Hayden had attempted to collect them, he had gotten hit simultaneously by three long swords while going for the tenth Truth Spiritual Sword. Then he had blacked out and gotten kicked out of the array.</p>

  <p>His personal best as of today was still only nine Truth Spiritual Swords.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had already obtained fourteen Swords, and it didn't seem hard for him to get seventeen.</p>

  <p>Among the eighty-seven divine cities in the Sunrest Tree Region, very few True Gods were able to grab seventeen Truth Spiritual Swords.</p>

  <p>'This guy... He would be perfect to participate in the debate over the Divine Dao!</p>

  <p>If he could participate in the debate, then my authority as the new city lord would be guaranteed and I would be able to ask my uncle for some rewards.'</p>

  <p>As Hayden was lost in his thoughts, Marley walked up to him and asked,</p>

  <p>"How's it going?"</p>

  <p>Marley had been busy with some personal affairs, thus the late arrival. He too was very curious about the performance of the young True God who had just arrived the day before.</p>

  <p>"See for yourself!" Hayden pointed at the direction of the array happily.</p>

  <p>Marley had expected Luo Zheng's performance to be above average. At the very least, he should be able to pass the test of the array. But if Luo Zheng couldn't even get the qualification to get onto the Sunrest Wood, then he would have to admit that he had overestimated Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>As his eyes followed the direction of Hayden's finger, the expression on his face froze.</p>

  <p>He saw Luo Zheng taking two steps forward and one step backward before a Truth Spiritual Sword floated up and joined the other swords which fanned out and spiraled around him.</p>

  <p>"What? He managed to grab so many?" Marley shouted with disbelief when he finally got over his shock. He started counting, "One, two, three..."</p>

  <p>"Fifteen now. Don't bother counting. The kid still seems to feel no pressure at all," Hayden cut him off.</p>

  <p>"If he can do it so effortlessly, does that mean... Is it possible? Do you think he can grab seventeen swords?" Marley asked.</p>

  <p>A delighted smile spread across Hayden's lips as he replied, "I think so. I bet seventeen is his limit."</p>

  <p>"That's good," Marley said with a short laugh. The scene in front of him was indeed something out of his expectations. He initially thought that Luo Zheng would be able to grab nine Truth Spiritual Swords at most as Hayden did.</p>

  <p>He had never expected that Luo Zheng could make it to this point.</p>

  <p>"But what's wrong with the Truth Spiritual Swords? Why do they keep ringing like that?" Marley suddenly noticed the oddity and asked Hayden.</p>

  <p>Hayden shrugged. "Who knows? Maybe he used some special skills that we don't know."</p>

  <p>While their discussion was going on, Luo Zheng kept moving forward and backward, and soon two more swords floated up and swirled around him.</p>

  <p>Which made it a grand total of seventeen now!</p>

  <p>Seeing this, the other True Gods in queue all gasped in surprise.</p>

  <p>"I really didn't expect this low-rank True God to be so extraordinary. He looks like an ordinary man, but in such a short period of time, he has already grabbed seventeen Truth Spiritual Swords!"</p>

  <p>"He's amazing! Is he qualified to participate in the debate over the Divine Dao?"</p>

  <p>"I've heard that only less than two hundred True Gods in the eighty-seven cities of the Sword Clan could grab seventeen swords. About fifty of them are qualified to participate in the debate over the Divine Dao and compete against the geniuses from the large clans on the Floating Islands. This guy has at least 25 percent of probability to participate in the debate!"</p>

  <p>For most True Gods, their chances of participating in the debate over the Divine Dao were too slim. Most of them had just come to try their luck.</p>

  <p>Just having the opportunity to discuss about Sanskrit words or enter the Sunrest Tree was good enough for them.</p>

  <p>They really envied Luo Zheng's unexpected performance.</p>

  <p>As for the two brothers of the Wang Clan who had taunted Luo Zheng earlier, they were now rendered speechless, unable to believe their eyes.</p>

  <p>They now understood that this man coming with the city lord was nowhere on the same level as them.</p>

  <p>"Seventeen is his limit," Hayden concluded with a smile, even though he had expected nothing less.</p>

  <p>Marley stroked his beard thoughtfully and chuckled. "I wonder if this boy could even go further. Do you think it's possible for him to grab all the Truth Spiritual Swords?"</p>

  <p>Hayden glanced at him incredulously and replied in a mild tone, "You're kidding right? You know this array as well as I do. After the seventeenth sword, the long swords along the road are added with the power of Red Fire Thunder. Although it won't harm the soul, it's very difficult to bear that sort of pain even for a consummate True God."</p>

  <p>"Hey, I was just joking. Never mind!" Marley said, giving two short laughs.</p>

  <p>In the history of the Famous Sword Divine City, there had only been three True Gods that had managed to grab more than seventeen swords.</p>

  <p>Two of them had made it to eighteen, and the last one had managed to get twenty.</p>

  <p>The True God who had grabbed twenty swords was a member of the Sword Clan. It was said that he had grown up in another clan and suddenly became an outstanding figure after he returned to his clan. He was now at consummation of True God Realm.</p>

  <p>Up to that point, no one had been able to grab all twenty-three swords.</p>

  <p>"If this guy doesn't want to give up and keeps going for the eighteenth sword, he will have to suffer a lot," Hayden said with a smile.</p>

  <p>Even as the two men were talking, Luo Zheng kept on moving forward.</p>

  <p>As he was halfway along the path, he noticed something rather odd.</p>

  <p>Amongst the rain of swords along the road, there were flashes of red lightning, and the speed of these swords seemed to be boosted even more compared to the previous ones.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>Before he could reach the blind spot ahead, he was hit by a Truth Spiritual Sword.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>As he was penetrated by the long sword, Luo Zheng felt an unbearable pain in his soul. In a flash, he felt that his head was about to explode. The pain almost reached the depths of his soul, and was absolutely unbearable.</p>

  <p>His strong willpower seemed to disappear in the face of such pain.</p>

  <p>Even so, Luo Zheng fought through the intense pain and struggled towards the blind spot. His body shook uncontrollably.</p>

  <p>"What the hell is that?"</p>

  <p>After making sure that his soul was unhurt, Luo Zheng took a closer look at the red swords and couldn't help but shout.</p>

  <p>Hayden and Marley observed Luo Zheng's trembling body and smiled at each other in anticipation.</p>

  <p>After a long while, the pain deep in his soul slowly disappeared. Then he looked back at the Truth Spiritual Swords with an intense look.</p>

  <p>He had planned to grab all the Truth Spiritual Swords with the same speedy method, but he finally realized that it would be no easy feat.</p>

  <p>If he got stabbed by the swords another three times, he would definitely black out.</p>

  <p>"Should I give up?" he wondered.</p>

  <p>He knew that he had done well enough and had far exceeded the requirements of entering the Sunrest Wood.</p>

  <p>But as he looked at the Truth Spiritual Swords shuttling back and forth, he was overcome by his stubbornness.</p>
