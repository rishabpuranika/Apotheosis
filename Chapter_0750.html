  <p>
</p>

  <p>Survival of the fittest ruled everyone in the world of warriors, exhibiting itself in every possible facet of life.</p>

  <p>If you possessed enough strength, then you'd have the potential to be revered by the people, much like they would worship God; all the people around you would kneel down and bow their heads to you; and even if you did something as irrational as calling a deer a horse, there was bound to be a couple of them who would still blindly go along with you.</p>

  <p>Fame, fortune, and authority could only be attained through possessing immense power.</p>

  <p>Let's say that a certain warrior had a younger sister who held a Purple Power Body, that person would surely be more than willing to offer her to Eddie. For as long as they could guarantee receiving Eddie's protection, or maybe even just a meager reward, they could make use of it for all eternity.</p>

  <p>But on this day, Luo Luo Zheng, who appeared to be just as feeble as an ant, up on his feet on the ruins of the arena, had proven to everyone how worthy he was of his dignity.</p>

  <p>In spite of the fact that Eddie was widely known as the strongest warrior residing in Central Region, Luo Luo Zheng wasn't fazed at all; he didn't even flinch a bit. When he did away with Marilyn, he had no qualms about doing it at all.</p>

  <p>In the face of Eddie, who had been fuming with intense rage, Luo Luo Zheng retained his composure. He had his gaze fixated on Yan, his younger sister, the only person who meant the world to him.</p>

  <p>The gusts of wind were steadily getting heavier and heavier.</p>

  <p>The spiritual energy of heaven and earth was growing much more frenzied and uncontrollable.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The basalt beneath Eddie's feet had already been loaded with fissures, and at that moment, it was beginning to collapse bit by bit.</p>

  <p>The murderous Mu Ning was looming deep inside Eddie's body, like a volcano that was about to flare up. Yan's face had gotten flushed red a little. This was caused by Eddie's hand unconsciously tightening its grip around her neck. In desperate need of breathing in more air, her chest started gasping frantically.</p>

  <p>Eddie was in a bit of a shock, for he hadn't thought that Luo Luo Zheng would really have the guts to try and kill Marilyn. 'It seems to me this puny brat has no idea what fear truly is, ' he pondered.</p>

  <p>Being the strongest and mightiest warrior in Central Region, not to mention, a Life and Death Realm warrior, and most importantly, after being at the jaws of death three times already, he had been utterly astonished that he had fallen at the hands of a little kid who was merely a warrior in the Illuminating Soul Realm. That puny human was just around 18 years old.</p>

  <p>To someone like Eddie who had been living for hundreds of years, he was nothing but a child!</p>

  <p>Eddie instinctively wanted to crush something with his bare hands. If he so much as exerted a little more force into it, Yan was going to end up having a fractured neck. Be that as it might, for the sake of gathering all three Purple Power Bodies, he had already exhausted several decades of his time.</p>

  <p>Now that Marilyn was gone, he knew full well that he couldn't kill Yan no matter what, because if he did that, then it would take close to forever for him to achieve the Lustful Demon Array.</p>

  <p>Every single warrior from the Life and Death Realm had to experience heavenly tribulations. The Lustful Demon Array was supposed to be the foundation for him to be able to force his way through the Life and Death Realm and make it to the Soul Sea Realm. If he somehow failed to acquire three Purple Power Bodies, there was a good chance that he'd meet his end on one of the heavenly tribulations without ever stepping foot inside the Soul Sea Realm in his lifetime!</p>

  <p>"For killing Marilyn with your own two hands, I sentence you to die right here as well!" Eddie shoved Yan over to the side, and proceeded to walk off the high platform straight away, pacing in the air heading toward the battle arena.</p>

  <p>"Eddie, I know you're angry, but you really need to think this through!"</p>

  <p>There wasn't any hint of amusement left on Dillon's face at that point.</p>

  <p>"Anyone who is foolish enough to get in my way will meet his maker,"</p>

  <p>Eddie clearly stated, stripped of any emotion, as he paced heavily in the air.</p>

  <p>Zing?</p>

  <p>A huge wall of ice about 50 feet high materialized on the bounds of the battle arena. With the mysterious ice halberd she had behind her, Ning Yudie said in a resolute voice, "Luo Luo Zheng is a disciple of Cloud Hall."</p>

  <p>Eddie, furiously jeering at Ning Yudie, looked her in the eye. "Little girl, I suggest that you not get yourself involved in this matter. You? do not possess the strength to be worthy of opposing me!"</p>

  <p>"So what? That is but a trivial matter." Ning Yudie had no intention to back down at all. In a second, an ice phoenix soared from somewhere far away and perched on her shoulder, cautiously glaring at Eddie.</p>

  <p>"Considering that you said something about my disciple not being strong enough, I suppose I wouldn't suffice to be your opponent either, isn't that right?" An old voice appeared without warning. Thereafter, the figure of a stooped woman emerged out of the blue, pacing her way with the aid of a walking cane. Notwithstanding her age, the woman walked surprisingly fast. That being said, in just a couple of strides, she had already gotten in front of Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>"Master..." Ning Yudie anxiously called out upon seeing her master.</p>

  <p>The old woman shot Ning Yudie a threatening glare. The fact was that the old woman had been utterly disappointed in the actions Ning Yudie had taken. In any case, the thing she just casually said indicated that she had been following Luo Luo Zheng and putting Cloud hall at risk.</p>

  <p>When all was said and done, Ning Yudie was still her beloved disciple. She honestly couldn't care less what would happen to Luo Luo Zheng, but she just couldn't let anything bad happen to Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>"Imogen." Eddie shook his head in disapproval. "That is indeed true. You are also not strong enough to stand against me."</p>

  <p>Imogen, Yudie's master, who was a former leader of Cloud Hall, was one of the strongest amongst the Life and Death Realm warriors. Having said that, upon entering the Life and Death Realm, she was only able to go through a single heavenly tribulation. Apart from that, she had gotten much too old that the vital energy and blood she had were both already deteriorating, so there was no way she could possibly be a match for Eddie.</p>

  <p>While they were about to engage in hostilities, a voice that seemed much older than even Imogen's rang out. "In the Martial Arts Contest, competitors' life or death depends on their own strength. This is a rule that has been laid down by our World Commercial Alliance, one that has been adhered to for hundreds of years. Eddie, aren't you aware of that?"</p>
