</p>

  <p>Elder Jing's face broke into an even wider smile.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's appearance gave him hope for the Purple Heart Sacred Place's destiny.</p>

  <p>Perhaps, with his presence, its state would finally improve.</p>

  <p>The hundred clans were all fighting for supremacy in the Sea God Continent and there was hope for the humans to take back their place in the sun.</p>

  <p>The human race had the capability of cultivating life vitality which gave them unparalleled superiority. Moreover, they had been able to produce two divine-level talents both 300 and 100 years ago, respectively.</p>

  <p>These two divine-level talents that were produced had the highest chances of reaching the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, they weren't able to do so. The first divine-level talent was killed by another race the moment he left the Purple Heart Sacred Place while the other talent became really strong but then perished in the Dark Nether Cave. There was great opportunity but also great danger in the Dark Nether Cave that even war lords could face sudden death.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng was, dare Elder Jing say it, different? His strength far exceeded that of an ordinary war fighter and had been enough to fight a tenth-grade general. To add to that, his soul seemed to be even strong enough to suppress a war lord.</p>

  <p>This young man might just be the one to reach the Soul Sea Realm and when he did, he'd be unstoppable. By then, it was possible that nobody in the entire Sea God Continent would be able to curb his strength.</p>

  <p>Because of the potential Elder Jing saw in Luo Luo Zheng, he did not feel the need to restrict his assistance to the young man through the use of the many resources of the Purple Heart Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>Elder Jing's purpose had been achieved after meeting with Luo Luo Zheng. In fact, he actually wanted to go further and invite the young man into the Purple Heart Sacred Place. They had a transmission array that led to the Purple Heart Sacred Place in the Cursed Land and if the powerful ones in the Soul Sea Realm would be willing to lend Luo Luo Zheng the Purple Heart Plate for his use, then it would be for the best!</p>

  <p>However, he understood that such a thing was too much. Even divine-level talents did not receive such treatment and he did not really have a say on such matters, so he chose to just keep his mouth shut.</p>

  <p>Just as he left with Olivia and the others, the young woman turned her head towards Luo Luo Zheng, "You still don't know my name!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled pleasantly, "What's your name?"</p>

  <p>Olivia returned his smile with her own. "Olivia Xia," she told him before leaving with Elder Jing.</p>

  <p>Upon returning to his living quarters, Luo Luo Zheng immediately rented a new cultivation room and continued refining the Lucky Light he had obtained from Teresa, which increased his cultivation at an extremely fast rate.</p>

  <p>For Luo Luo Zheng, the only way he would be able to fight Eddie and defeat him was through becoming a war lord.</p>

  <p>Thus, his ultimate goal was to become a war lord in the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>He had only experienced a few battles after entering the tower. He had fought with those war fighters on the first floor, while the Lucky Light he had obtained allowed him to advance from a Level 7 to a Level 8 war fighter. It should be noted, however, that at the time, he was already on the verge of a breakthrough and the light he had obtained only served as a catalyst for his advancement.</p>

  <p>He had managed to obtain a lot of Lucky Light from Teresa on the second floor, but despite absorbing all the light rays, he had not managed to break through. He concluded that it was because the light rays he had absorbed were not enough and he would need to get more in order to advance.</p>

  <p>The Lucky Light from Teresa had come from other war generals, who, in turn, had snatched it away from the first and second-floor war fighters, so it was understandable that it wasn't really that much.</p>

  <p>This made Luo Luo Zheng think, 'It seems I have to climb to the higher floors as soon as possible. There is too little Lucky Light on the lower floors.' He had to catch up with the war generals in the Tower of Sin if he wanted to get stronger.</p>

  <p>The war generals located above the fifth floor possessed a much larger amount of Lucky Light in their hands.</p>

  <p>It was a pity he had to follow the rules and climb up the tower one floor at a time. So, even if he were to have a default victory on every floor, it would still take him quite a while.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng shook these thoughts from his head and decided to rest for the night.</p>

  <p>The next day, he walked out of the cultivating room and headed for the battle arena. War fighters had been fighting in the arena day and night but as soon as Luo Luo Zheng walked in, it was suddenly plunged into a deathly silence.</p>

  <p>News about him using his Mu Ning to force the two ogre war lords away had already spread throughout the entire second floor. Most of them thought of him as that terrifying fiend who, despite coming from the human race, had combat skills that far surpassed others at his level. They knew he was strong, but they couldn't tell where the limits of his strength lay.</p>

  <p>Because of yesterday's events of him defeating Teresa, a war general and divine-level talent of the Demon Night Race, nobody had the courage to challenge him to a fight.</p>

  <p>When he arrived, two creatures from the other races were still fighting.</p>

  <p>After their match, the winner of the fight noticed Luo Luo Zheng standing outside the arena. His glorious expression immediately blanched and he quickly jumped off the battle platform.</p>

  <p>According to the Tower of Sin's rules, the fighters could fight and kill freely once onstage, and if Luo Luo Zheng had come up while the winner was still there, then he could instantly die from Luo Zheng's formidable strength.</p>

  <p>The sight of the fleeing creature didn't elicit any laughs from the other combatants.</p>

  <p>Everyone's life was precious. If any of them were to go up against Luo Luo Zheng and died, then they would be relegated to the role of a mere stepping stone used by him to climb up? it wasn't a fate any truly desired.</p>

  <p>However, it was ironic because the one that had run away was actually the strongest on the entire second floor, having previously won sixteen consecutive victories.</p>

  <p>Despite his wins, he had been extremely depressed for the past few days.</p>

  <p>First, it was Teresa, whose battle proposal he did not dare accept; he opted for closed-door cultivation instead. Now, here was Luo Luo Zheng who had defeated Teresa and was no doubt coming for him next.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, on the other hand, pretended not to notice. This was always how it had been for those in power, and he couldn't care less about what these fighters thought. All Luo Luo Zheng cared about was gaining strength, and whoever blocked his path of advancement would die.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng entered the arena. "Who dares challenge me?" he asked in a booming voice.</p>

  <p>Everyone hoped for a default victory for Luo Luo Zheng. As long as there was a default victory today and tomorrow, they would happily send him off and get rid of this great threat to their lives. No one present would be stupid enough to challenge him unless they were seeking death.</p>

  <p>Everyone was silent, all waiting with bated breath for the default victory to be announced. Luo Luo Zheng being stuck there with them was a type of torture, and they would rather he get out and ascend to another floor as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>However, just as they thought Luo Luo Zheng'd get a default victory, a voice rang out from the crowd, "I will challenge you!"</p>

  <p>The moment they heard this brave soul speak, everyone's expression froze while Luo Zheng's eyebrows furrowed.</p>

  <p>"Who dares challenge Luo Luo Zheng? Damn it!" someone cursed. "Look, we couldn't care less whether you live or die, but once you challenge him, Luo Luo Zheng has three more days before he can go up the third floor!"</p>

  <p>"Are you trying to screw us over!" another one burst angrily.</p>

  <p>"Right! Just let him advance automatically. If you want to challenge him, you go to the third floor!"</p>

  <p>"It seems like Luo Luo Zheng will be staying on this floor for a few more days."</p>

  <p>As the creatures buzzed and cursed, the brave soul who had spoken up revealed herself: it was Teresa from the Demon Night race!</p>

  <p>Her gaze was cold as she shot a fierce glare at the fighters who had cursed at her. "You got a problem with me?" she demanded angrily.</p>

  <p>Her sudden appearance immediately made the other combatants shut their mouths.</p>

  <p>They had forgotten that there was another fiend among them.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng scared them, but Teresa was no better. In any case, both of them were regarded as invincible among the war fighters, and one of them was in an extremely bad mood after suffering a loss. If she decided to vent her anger on them, they'd be facing a huge problem!</p>

  <p>Such was always the case: the weak were always subject to the whims of the strong.</p>

  <p>A war fighter on the first to fifth floors had a tragic fate: either they climbed up or stayed on their floors to become a stepping stone for others' advancement. The recent change of the tower rules actually worked in their favor.</p>

  <p>In the past, there was no such thing as a default victory so the war generals would often farm points on the lower floors because it was the only way they could get promoted. The weaklings on the lower floors ended up as the war generals' tools in gaining points for advancement while the war lords preyed on the war generals.</p>

  <p>Back then, the Tower of Sin was even more chaotic than it was now. There hadn't even been a designated safe zone! Talents could be killed at any time and the cruelest of them all had a full range in taking down whoever, whenever.</p>

  <p>Teresa's appearance left a sour taste in Luo Zheng's mouth. 'Could it be that since I ended her default victory yesterday, she deliberately came out to cause trouble today? Does she think I won't kill her?'</p>

  <p>His eyes sharpened with rage at the thought.</p>

  <p>This intense look had Teresa's palms sweating, but she reeled it in. "I want to challenge you," she told him. "But not on the second floor. I'll let you ascend, and if I catch up to you, then I'll fight with you once again!"</p>

  <p>Everyone present let out a collective sigh of relief. It seemed Teresa wasn't entirely stupid. Since Luo Luo Zheng had let her go yesterday, challenging him the next day would be for naught. One would've thought she was courting death if she proceeded with fighting him again.</p>
