<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4227 Satisfy His Obsession </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>In the past, both the Bold Conjecture House and Kincaid himself had opposed Elder Xue's idea of venturing into the Deep Space.</p>

  <p>As a result, Elder Xue decided to leave abruptly, without so much as a goodbye. He only left a letter for them.</p>

  <p>After that, they hadn't heard from him. After all this time, they figured he had perished.</p>

  <p>And yet, now, Luo Zheng was claiming he had news from Elder Xue! Hence they felt shock mixed with doubt.</p>

  <p>"Elder Xue? How is it possible that you saw him?" a long-haired monster inquired, his tone littered with doubt.</p>

  <p>"Elder Xue went to the Deep Space alone back then," another long-haired monster mused aloud. "Although we thought he wouldn't survive, he did manage to avoid the catastrophe that happened in the main world..."</p>

  <p>"Never mind that, he found the way to fuse with the ancestry-level bloodline!"</p>

  <p>"When and where did you see him?"</p>

  <p>The long-haired monsters buzzed with questions, their eyes brimming with excitement.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shook his head regretfully. "I didn't see him personally, but someone else did."</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord's remnant soul emerged from above Luo Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>He then recounted how he had met Elder Xue. He explained how he had hidden in the Jade Pure Realm and how Elder Xue had planned everything.</p>

  <p>The long-haired monsters all listened closely, their shock steadily growing with each story the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord told.</p>

  <p>Although they all shared the same roots and were all very smart creatures, they couldn't deny that they were impressed by how far Elder Xue had come.</p>

  <p>"I must admit, Elder Xue is the most far-sighted person amongst the Bold Conjecture House..."</p>

  <p>"I didn't expect him to come so far!"</p>

  <p>"We should have believed him back then..."</p>

  <p>While the other long-haired monsters discussed excitedly, a white-haired monster slowly took a few steps forward. "I was wrong about Elder Xue," he suddenly said, his tone filled with regret. "I had even scolded him back then. I didn't know he had so much alone..." Then, he smiled. "But what's important is, he made it!"</p>

  <p>"May I know your name?" Luo Zheng asked him politely.</p>

  <p>The white-haired monster cupped his hands courteously and said, "I am Hilario Wen, the chief of the Bold Conjecture House."</p>

  <p>The strongest person in the Human Spirit Sect was Kincaid, the Human Spirit King. Below him were the Ten Directions House and the Bold Conjecture House. The two houses were responsible for military and civil affairs, respectively. Hence, Hilario was in charge of the latter.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng also cupped his hands and bowed in return.</p>

  <p>Hilario studied Luo Zheng carefully. "The ancestry-level bloodline is believed to be the origin of everything, and it can provide endless power. If that sword was in your possession, you should've been invincible in this world."</p>

  <p>There was a tinge of doubt in his voice. He still felt it was hard to believe Luo Zheng's words.</p>

  <p>The Bold Conjecture House had made many relevant conjectures. Hilario had deduced that the strongest power in the main world was in theory the combination of the ancestry-level bloodline and that sword. Theoretically, anyone who owned both should be able to take control of everything.</p>

  <p>"My enemy came from the world above the Deep Space. He is a higher-level opponent," Luo Zheng explained, seeing they still doubted him.</p>

  <p>Hilario was stunned for a moment. "Do you mean he is someone from the sixth-grade world?"</p>

  <p>The other long-haired monsters who had been discussing amongst themselves suddenly stopped to listen. They too were intrigued by their conversation.</p>

  <p>These creatures had taken it upon themselves to explore the truth of the world.</p>

  <p>Thus, while they were almost certain that there was a higher-grade world above the Deep Space, they had figured that it was too difficult for them to explore even the Deep Space itself. Even if there was a higher-grade world, it was most likely something beyond their understanding, so it only existed in their assumptions.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shook his head. "No. In fact, he might be from the seventh, eighth, or even ninth-grade world..."</p>

  <p>"What?!"</p>

  <p>"How is that possible? How could there be such an existence?"</p>

  <p>"Impossible! You must be joking!"</p>

  <p>Chaos erupted amongst the long-haired monsters. They just couldn't believe Luo Zheng's words.</p>

  <p>"Believe it or not," Luo Zheng said indifferently. "The world you lived in was downgraded from the higher-grade worlds by him. That's why he's called 'the downgrader'."</p>

  <p>"Why would he do such a thing?" Hilario queried, his curiosity piqued.</p>

  <p>"Who knows?" Luo Zheng shrugged. "Maybe this was his way of dealing with someone. Or perhaps he was trying to escape from someone..."</p>

  <p>The only information Luo Zheng garnered from the humanoid creature was that he had faced an opponent named "Clarence".</p>

  <p>"It's no wonder, then." Hilario shook his head and sighed. "No wonder you lost..." He finally understood how Luo Zheng had been defeated.</p>

  <p>Now that Luo Zheng, who possessed the ancestry-level bloodline, had been defeated, it would be useless even if they did awaken Kincaid. Although Kincaid was powerful, he would never do better than Luo Zheng. They had heavily underestimated their enemy.</p>

  <p>"Well, then... Can't I see my father? Can't your curses be removed now?"</p>

  <p>Dorothy asked, tears still brimming in her bright eyes.</p>

  <p>"Your father must be the Human Spirit King, Kincaid, right?" Luo Zheng gently stroked her hair, smiling at her fondly. When he had seen the woman who looked exactly like Dorothy in the altar, Luo Zheng guessed the truth of the matter.</p>

  <p>"Yes." She nodded.</p>

  <p>At first, Dorothy didn't know much about it, but gradually, it dawned on her.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stretched out his hand. With a flash of blue light from his Sumeru Space, a Treacherous Being emerged from inside. It was the Human Spirit King, Kincaid.</p>

  <p>The long-haired monsters didn't expect that Luo Zheng would hide the Human Spirit King in his Sumeru Space. They immediately became overcome with excitement when they recognized that the Treacherous Being before them was their king.</p>

  <p>"King!"</p>

  <p>"It's our king!"</p>

  <p>"Master Kincaid!"</p>

  <p>The long-haired monsters gathered around him excitedly.</p>

  <p>"Get out of the way!" Hilario barked irritably.</p>

  <p>After the long-haired monsters retreated a distance, Hilario gently lifted Kincaid from the ground.</p>

  <p>As a sleeping-type Treacherous Being, Kincaid did not show any resistance whatsoever. Hilario tried to awaken him, "Master Kincaid!</p>

  <p>Master Kincaid! Look! This is your daughter! Can you see her? Can you wake up?"</p>

  <p>As strange as it seemed, it was common practice to wake up Treacherous Beings by using their loved ones.</p>

  <p>Each Treacherous Being had differing obsessions, so they couldn't be awakened in the same way. For example, Sheehan, the Bird Spirit King, who had a strong tendency of self-destruction, definitely couldn't be awakened in this way.</p>

  <p>In the past, Kincaid was known to cherish his family the most, so this method had a good chance of working.</p>

  <p>Eyeing the father she'd never met, Dorothy felt a little nervous.</p>

  <p>Although she was actually the reincarnation of his daughter, her memories of the previous life didn't come with her. Thus, this father was a total stranger to her.</p>

  <p>Dorothy had been brought up by Ying since she was a child, and she had been well taken care of in the Origin Mountain. It could be said that she was the apple of everyone's eye back home, but at the back of her mind, she hoped to see her parents all this time.</p>

  <p>Now that she stood before her father, she felt mixed feelings.</p>

  <p>Inside the Treacherous Being's body, Kincaid did not have a clear perception of the outside world. He was trapped in the cage of obsession, and his children had been his strongest obsession. When Dorothy was presented in front of him, alive, this information was like a beacon of light that shone into his dark world.</p>

  <p>The cage that bound him started to break little by little...</p>

  <p>"Has he woken up?" one of the long-haired monsters grumbled after waiting for a long while.</p>

  <p>"Shut up!"</p>

  <p>The remaining long-haired monsters glared at him fiercely, shutting him up immediately.</p>

  <p>Just then, Kincaid slowly raised his hand and stroked Dorothy's face. His eyes opened slowly, only to reveal tears streaming down his face.</p>

  <p>Although the general atmosphere had been a bit glum, what with the news of Luo Zheng losing the irregular heavy sword, once they saw the Human Spirit King wake up, the mood instantly brightened.</p>

  <p>At least...</p>

  <p>They finally completed their mission.</p>

  <p>Kincaid stared at Dorothy's face for a long while, his eyes filled with affection. Then, he slowly shifted his gaze to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Young man, are you the one who took me out of the altar?" Kincaid asked.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded. "Please forgive me, Master Kincaid. I took your sword but failed to keep it. It's in someone else's possession now."</p>
