<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>



  <p>
</p>

  <p>Although at first intimidated by the blue flame's strength, Zheng didn't think that it could harm him in any way.</p>

  <p>Just as the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow stopped spewing out flames, Zheng abruptly jumped up to rush towards Queenie.</p>

  <p>Queenie, who thought that Zheng died, had shifted and fixed her gaze on another Oneness General.</p>

  <p>Just as she flapped her wings to return to and mount the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow, Zheng had unexpectedly pounced on her.</p>

  <p>Queenie was caught off guard. She never expected Zheng to return safely from the blue flames!</p>

  <p>The look of astonishment on her face froze as Zheng's long sword pierced right through her chest. At that point, her Chaotic Source Spirits had managed to restore to just thirty percent of their original power after Zheng had consumed it earlier.</p>

  <p>That meant his sword was only met with slight resistance before it successfully pierced her through the chest.</p>

  <p>"I thought…the fire…killed you…" Queenie stuttered in confusion with whatever remaining strength she had.</p>

  <p>"Well, you thought wrong," Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Upon finishing his sentence, he suddenly withdrew his long sword from her chest before wielding and slashing it to split her into two.</p>

  <p>Now that he had successfully slaughtered Queenie, Zheng returned his gaze to the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow.</p>

  <p>Because it no longer had a master to order it around, the beast appeared lost and clueless as to what its next move should be.</p>

  <p>The Corpse Spirit Sun Crow was like a puppet, useless without a master controlling it.</p>

  <p>As Zheng thought it through, he suddenly remembered the human race's Civilization Artifact. Apart from the Primeval Lord of Heaven's energy soul, there was also Emperor Charm's energy soul in that Civilization Artifact.</p>

  <p>Although these energy souls weren't their real bodies, they still possessed and retained their memories and auras.</p>

  <p>As he was casually wiping out dozens of approaching Sun Crows, another thought flashed through Zheng's inner world and called out to the Primeval Lord of Heaven.</p>

  <p>His inner world had undergone tremendous change ever since carrying the human race's Civilization Artifact. All of this was caused by the Primeval Lord of Heaven and other energy souls that had been carrying out experiments on his inner world.</p>

  <p>The successful integration of the Civilization Artifact into Zheng's body meant that he trusted them. During this period of transformation, even the Regal Jade Spirit often followed the Primeval Lord of Heaven and kept asking numerous questions.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven raised his brows after learning Zheng's encounters and thoughts in his inner world. He then pointed a finger to the book in the air.</p>

  <p>After a few pages were turned, a handsome man appeared. It was none other than Emperor Charm.</p>

  <p>"What? Corpse Spirit Sun Crow?" The emperor's face appeared shocked.</p>

  <p>"Although my avatar betrayed the Finale Way, he is able now. He's even summoned the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows…"</p>

  <p>"Emperor Charm, are you able to control them?" Zheng's question rang in his inner world.</p>

  <p>"It'll be a piece of cake," Emperor Charm assured Zheng.</p>

  <p>Soon, the shadow of the book materialized above Zheng's head. The outline of Emperor Charm's head stretched out from the pages. With the help of the Civilization Artifact, Emperor Charm began to get a glimpse of the world over a thousand chaotic eras later.</p>

  <p>What he witnessed truly vexed him.</p>

  <p>The Sun Crows, blocking the sun and sky with their massive wings, fought with the humans. This stirred up some unhappy memories he had kept.</p>

  <p>"Emperor Charm, I'm talking about that Corpse Spirit Sun Crow," Zheng explained and pointed towards the large bird ahead.</p>

  <p>The other demon women were locked in combat with the Oneness Generals, and so none of them took heed of Zheng.</p>

  <p>"You can mount it," Emperor Charm said.</p>

  <p>Without saying a word, Zheng jumped onto Corpse Spirit Sun Crow's back.</p>

  <p>Immediately, a strange yet familiar feeling came over him. He realized that not only could he control the beast, he could also control the Other Shore Token that was embedded in its body as well. "This Corpse Spirit Sun Crow has quite an…unusual Other Shore Token…"</p>

  <p>The token the bird carried within it was shaped like a spindle similar to a fruit core.</p>

  <p>"It's considered an Other Shore Treasure," Emperor Charm informed nonchalantly. "It's the Demonic Star Fruit. Only about a hundred in total exist. I only placed them in Stage Thirty-One. Unexpectedly, another me had found them…"</p>

  <p>The Other Shore Treasure in the Source World could carry the Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>But most of the Other Shore Treasures weren't strong enough to carry Other Shore Tokens in higher level due to their limited strength.</p>

  <p>The Demonic Star Fruits had many divine megatons of force, and how did the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows carry them…</p>

  <p>Getting to the bottom of that matter would have to wait. Now, Zheng stood on top of the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow he mounted and gazed at the other Sun Crows that were located not too far away. A thought then flashed through his mind.</p>

  <p>The Corpse Spirit Sun Crow beneath his feet opened its mouth and from deep within it burst brilliant blue flames.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>How powerful were the blue flames, exactly?</p>

  <p>So powerful that they had reduced the ordinary Sun Crows to nothing but ashes.</p>

  <p>"This way!"</p>

  <p>"Left! Burn them now!"</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Under Zheng's control, the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow constantly spewed out blue flames in all directions and burned thousands of Sun Crows to ashes.</p>

  <p>Not far away, Jago and the other warriors at the Other Shore Realm were running wildly.</p>

  <p>Normally, it wouldn't be difficult for a Oneness General and a five-star Oneness Guard to kill the Sun Crows.</p>

  <p>However, with the strength of Jago and his peers, they could do nothing but escape in the face of thousands of Sun Crows.</p>

  <p>"Those Sharp-winged Sun Crows are rushing down!"</p>

  <p>"Everyone, get down!"</p>

  <p>At this order, everyone in the group lowered themselves to the ground as quickly as possible.</p>

  <p>Soon, the Sharp-winged Sun Crows began to rain down on them like lightning bolts during a heavy storm.</p>

  <p>Reflexively, Jago lay on the ground with his body huddled up, trembling with fear.</p>

  <p>He had no chance of fighting these vicious beasts at all.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The whistle of the Sharp-winged Sun Crows slicing the air was followed by the deaths of dozens of people— many of them with their stomachs sliced wide open.</p>

  <p>Hot blood splashed onto Jago's face.</p>

  <p>More than half of the 300 people who made up the group were slaughtered in this single attack alone.</p>

  <p>"I'll slaughter them even if it means death!"</p>

  <p>One terrified man exclaimed as he prepared to activate his Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Other Shore Tokens that originated from Stage Two or Stage Three couldn't work in this kind of battles at all. Using it against the swift Sharp-winged Sun Crows would be useless.</p>

  <p>Before that man could activate his Other Shore Token, one of the Sharp-winged Sun Crows swooped down and slashed his neck. He was beheaded before he even got the chance to cry out.</p>

  <p>Jago felt nothing but utter hopelessness as he witnessed his comrades drop dead all around him.</p>

  <p>'How can Flag Master… survive this?'</p>

  <p>Jago's mind went blank as he realized he'd be unable to protect himself now.</p>

  <p>But he still clung to the hope that Zheng would be able to save him. Although at this point, it seemed quite impossible…</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>A sudden wave of heat passed over his face.</p>

  <p>All he saw above him was a brilliant blue flame before an enormous Sun Crow landed beside him.</p>

  <p>"Come on up!" Zheng beckoned from the back of a Corpse Spirit Sun Crow.</p>

  <p>Blinking his eyes, Jago could hardly understand what was happening in front of him.</p>
