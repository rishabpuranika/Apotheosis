  <p>
</p>

  <p>Fuxi had been observing Zheng closely the whole time.</p>

  <p>He was curious as to why Zheng's pained expression gradually calmed down.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, have you sealed off your hearing?" he asked through his spiritual sense.</p>

  <p>Zheng was still carefully distinguishing the low chanting sounds. When he heard Fuxi's question, he shook his head and said, "No."</p>

  <p>"It seems that you're not in pain anymore…" At that point, Fuxi was even more surprised.</p>

  <p>"The howls are gone. The Treacherous Beings you mentioned seem to be chanting something now," said Zheng.</p>

  <p>Fuxi arched his brows at Zheng's words. "What are they chanting about?"</p>

  <p>Before they entered the Whining Road, he and the Snake Goddess prepared quite well.</p>

  <p>After all, they would die if they were not careful on their way to the Supreme Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>When they hid in the thatched hut before, they also destroyed their hearing.</p>

  <p>However, Fuxi brought out a mouse from his spirit beast bag every once in a while, so they knew what was going on outside.</p>

  <p>The howls on the Whining Road were very powerful. Fuxi's mice also came from the Grand Pure Realm, and they were close relatives of the Terror Mice. Although they weren't rare creatures, they were by no means weak.</p>

  <p>However, after the mouse was out for less than nine seconds, its eyes turned bloody red, then its head exploded as it struggled madly.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, the Whining Road had twelve hours of daytime and twenty hours of nighttime.</p>

  <p>Fuxi released a mouse every two hours to test the situation.</p>

  <p>According to his experiment, the howls lasted twenty hours until dawn.</p>

  <p>It was not until daybreak when the mouse he had released returned unharmed, that he and the Snake Goddess dared to restore their hearing.</p>

  <p>Based on the mice's reaction, the howls of the Treacherous Beings would last a whole night.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng just said that the howls had stopped, which contradicted his early conclusion. He didn't believe him at all.</p>

  <p>Yet, Zheng's reaction told him everything, as he didn't show any pain at all.</p>

  <p>Did something happen to the Treacherous Beings on the Whining Road?</p>

  <p>Suddenly, an idea occurred to him. He gently touched his ears, as his palm glowed green. Then, his hearing returned to normal.</p>

  <p>He had trusted Zheng's reaction too much, but he forgot that Zheng had a completely different type of life form after he had obtained a unique bloodline.</p>

  <p>Just as he recovered his hearing, the ear-piercing howls immediately flooded his mind.</p>

  <p>As a result, his eyes rolled back, and his body convulsed.</p>

  <p>"Do you want to die?!" the Snake Goddess hissed madly.</p>

  <p>She quickly reached out to him and pressed on his ears. After she shut off his hearing, he stopped twitching. He had fully fainted.</p>

  <p>Then, she turned to look at Zheng. "What did you do?" she asked in confusion.</p>

  <p>He and Fuxi had communicated with each other through their spiritual senses just now, so the Snake Goddess naturally did not know what they talked about, nor did she know why Fuxi suddenly restored his hearing.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng was also confused. He said, "The Treacherous Beings have stopped wailing. Why did Master Fuxi still suffer?"</p>

  <p>"Stopped wailing?" the Snake Goddess frowned. "Maybe you heard a different sound from us," she opined.</p>

  <p>By that time, Fuxi woke up already. He released a spiritual sense that conveyed resentment. He glared at Zheng and said, "You brat, do you want to kill me?"</p>

  <p>Right now, the howls of the Treacherous Beings were quite intense. If it wasn't for the Snake Goddess's quick reaction, Fuxi's soul would've gotten seriously injured. Furthermore, exposure to the howls for five minutes was enough to kill him!</p>

  <p>"It's my fault, Master Fuxi," Zheng apologized. "But what I hear are indeed chanting sounds, and the chants follow certain rules," he explained.</p>

  <p>With that, he announced his words to the crowd in the thatched hut through his spiritual sense.</p>

  <p>"Chants that follow some rules..."</p>

  <p>"Do these Treacherous Beings have language?"</p>

  <p>"You must have misheard it. Did the wails damage your ears?"</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and the three Eternal Realm Hunters all looked at him strangely.</p>

  <p>No one knew about the origins of the Treacherous Beings. They just appeared occasionally in the Supreme Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>It seemed that some kind of creature had created them from their resentment. As for why they existed or what they came here for, no one knew. The more they couldn't figure out the Treacherous Beings' origins, the more they became afraid of them.</p>

  <p>"I did not mishear," Zheng said and shook his head. "These regular chants seem to..."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, his eyes suddenly glowed brightly, then he exclaimed, "It appears that they are reciting Sanskrit words!"</p>

  <p>The voices uttered the chants in a rhythm. Although their tone was flat and was nothing like singing, it was quite similar to reading Sanskrit words.</p>

  <p>Back then, when he was with the bald giant by the name of Pompeo, his voice was like singing, and it was also rhythmic.</p>

  <p>It turned out that the Treacherous Beings were not wailing, but communicating through the incomprehensible Sanskrit words!</p>

  <p>"Sanskrit words?"</p>

  <p>Everyone looked at each other, confused.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! Forget about whether the Treacherous Beings know Sanskrit or not, or if the wails are a way of their communication with Sanskrit words. Even if it is, you still can't understand it," Pearson said and waved his hand.</p>

  <p>There was no way for them to confirm such speculations if they couldn't understand the language used. Thus, Pearson thought that what Zheng said was nonsense.</p>

  <p>"Not necessarily," the Snake Goddess said with a smile. "He can understand it."</p>

  <p>Pearson's, Thurston's, and Sawyer's eyes widened in shock. They thought that the Snake Goddess must be kidding!</p>

  <p>The Eternal Realm Hunters wandered in the Three Purities Stage all year round, and they also knew a lot about Sanskrit words.</p>

  <p>It was still possible to decipher Sanskrit words that were on paper or engraved on something, but not for "Sanskrit words" in chants.</p>

  <p>That kind of language contained too much meaning, and it was too complicated.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the creatures in the chaos had innate limitations. Letting them decipher Sanskrit words was equivalent to making the dumb speak and the blind paint. It was beyond their abilities.</p>

  <p>Even Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin also cast Zheng strange looks. Then again, they did not know much about what happened on the Other Shore after they got trapped, so they did not know that Zheng had such a skill.</p>

  <p>"I'm not sure if I can understand, but I can try," said Zheng.</p>

  <p>What if perhaps the Treacherous Beings did not talk in Sanskrit? If so, the Heavenly Obsession Civilization naturally couldn't decipher them.</p>

  <p>Still, he began to communicate with the Heavenly Obsession Civilization.</p>

  <p>However, he didn't dare let the Heavenly Obsession Civilization listen directly to the wails. Instead, he transmitted the sound he heard into his inner world.</p>

  <p>Once the Civilization Artifact of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization was ready, it began to decipher the chants.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization on the upper ice field of the Blooming Jade Stage began to operate like mad.</p>

  <p>This time, it took longer to decipher the words. After quite a while, a voice came out from the Civilization Artifact.</p>

  <p>"They are indeed speaking Sanskrit," it stated. "Then what are they talking about?" Zheng asked hurriedly.</p>

  <p>"Most of the sounds are meaningless. Perhaps they are scriptures used in a kind of ceremony, and they recite them over and over again," answered the Civilization Artifact.</p>

  <p>"Some scriptures..." In all honesty, he was a little disappointed.</p>

  <p>Just then, the Civilization Artifact added, "In addition to those meaningless scriptures, there is also a sentence within them."</p>

  <p>He immediately perked up upon hearing those words. "What is it?" he asked again.</p>

  <p>"They have been calling out 'come back quickly, ' as if one of them went missing. They continually repeat the words so the missing would return," the Civilization Artifact said.</p>
