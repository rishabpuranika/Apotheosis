<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Somewhere in the depths of the chaos, a huge pyramid spun slowly.</p>

  <p>Behind this pyramid was an empty void, the heads previously scattered already devoured.</p>

  <p>It had now entered a new world.</p>

  <p>With all the heads cleared out, three light columns suddenly extended from the three, large mouths.</p>

  <p>The energy within these columns was very weak yet very stable and had the power to spread for billions of miles across the chaos.</p>

  <p>Although these heads were stupid, they had an extraordinarily keen sense when it came to energy. They crazily followed the light columns as they swept past them.</p>

  <p>Once the number of heads that followed the light columns was enough, the distance between each beam narrowed in such a way that they were all led towards the mouths of the pyramid. This was how all those heads from before were cleared out all at once.</p>

  <p>As the pyramid devoured the heads with frighteningly high efficiency, it expanded a thousand times in size.</p>

  <p>It was small compared to the Source World but the rate at which it grew was astonishing.</p>

  <p>On the other side of the chaos, Luo Zheng used a similar way to clear the heads.</p>

  <p>He had asked the Snake Goddess to spread her shadow and used the energy beams to attract the heads, and this method initially worked.</p>

  <p>However, as the primitive land continued to expand, the Snake Goddess's shadow fell short.</p>

  <p>Her shadow could theoretically extend at an infinite distance. If she was given enough time, she could even spread her shadow across the chaos.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the speed at which her shadow extended was too slow.</p>

  <p>According to what the ancestry-level bloodline said, a round of competition would begin after the downgrade started and those bigger in size would have a great advantage.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng knew he had to come up with a better method if he wanted to absorb more heads in the least amount of time.</p>

  <p>Since Snake Goddess' shadow proved ineffective, he decided to gather everyone on the jadeite platform for a brainstorming session.</p>

  <p>What they needed was something that could spread far and wide at a fast enough rate.</p>

  <p>"Light," Gerald was quick to propose.</p>

  <p>Light not only contained energy but also had the ability to spread all throughout the chaos.</p>

  <p>Once again, Luo Zheng asked the ancestry-level bloodline to transform the primitive land.</p>

  <p>Not long after, six, huge arrays appeared on the surface of the primitive land. These six arrays served no purpose of defense and only released strong, enduring light.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>As a burst of powerful energy was injected into the arrays, it scattered into strong beams of light in all directions.</p>

  <p>It was as if there was a huge sun in the chaos as these blazing beams of white light expanded hundreds of millions of miles away. They effectively drew in the heads within this range which then rushed towards the primitive land.</p>

  <p>All three primitive lands within the chaos were able to figure out unique ways to expand and grow.</p>

  <p>As the rate at which they consumed the heads wasn't slow, their growth rate itself was astonishing.</p>

  <p>For perspective, it was important to remember that the chaos was enormous.</p>

  <p>For them to grow to a size comparable to the chaos, given their already astonishing expansion rate, was still going to take some time.</p>

  <p>Fast forward to a month later.</p>

  <p>Several humans appeared at the Night View Island's entrance on the Supreme Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>The man at the helm was handsome and had a heroic expression on his face.</p>

  <p>Behind him were three women and two other men.</p>

  <p>As they approached the pool, two Monkey Masters suddenly appeared.</p>

  <p>"Stop!"</p>

  <p>"Take one more step and you die."</p>

  <p>The two Monkey Masters were on the defensive, ready to strike if they did not do as they said.</p>

  <p>These two took their jobs of guarding the entrance to the Night View Island seriously. Nobody was allowed to approach it.</p>

  <p>Under normal circumstances, the Monkey Masters would've already killed whoever decided to venture close to the entrance.</p>

  <p>However, this group was an exception because they were humans.</p>

  <p>Over the years, the Monkey Masters made a lot of contact with the human race. Moreover, Luo Zheng also helped them awaken the Monkey Spirit King which contributed to their changed perspective of the human race.</p>

  <p>The man leading his group bowed respectfully to the two Monkey Masters. "I am the leader of the Nihility race, Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>Greetings, Monkey Masters!"</p>

  <p>"The Nihility race? Grandmaster of Heaven? Aren't you the ones supported by the Bird Spirit Sect?" one of the Monkey Masters said with a strange expression on his face.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven gave him a gracious smile. "Yes. I came here with Bird Master Lawler's coordinates."</p>

  <p>Lawler's reputation in the Four Spirits Sect was only second to that of the four leaders and was even on par with the Great Ape King. He was given the title "Divine Phoenix" and was no doubt a well-known figure.</p>

  <p>His name surprised the two Monkey Masters who grew even more cautious against this group.</p>

  <p>The coordinates were equivalent to the lives of the Treacherous Beings.</p>

  <p>This person had come bearing Lawler's life!</p>

  <p>"Why are you here?" one of the Monkey Masters asked.</p>

  <p>"The Bird Master Lawler wants to discuss an alliance with the Monkey Spirit King," the Grandmaster of Heaven replied.</p>

  <p>Without further ado, the two Monkey Masters sent this message to the Night View Island.</p>

  <p>A reply came soon enough and the Grandmaster of Heaven was allowed entry into the Night View Island but only if he came alone.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven entered the pond and went up the passage.</p>

  <p>Once he emerged on the other side, he was guided to a palace on the shore.</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, there was no Monkey Spirit King in the palace, only a group of human heroes led by the Primeval Lord of Heaven and Luo Zheng was also there on the side.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven's face wrinkled with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Brother, we finally meet again," he exclaimed good-naturedly.</p>

  <p>However, his enthusiasm was only returned with a look of indifference.</p>

  <p>"Hello, brother."</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, his gaze fell on Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Back when he had just climbed up to Stage Thirty-two, Luo Zheng already struck the Grandmaster of Heaven as someone special. He never expected that this kid would actually affect the balance between the Treacherous Beings.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven simply brushed his indifference aside.</p>

  <p>"There is another person who wants to see you! You're not going to believe who it is!"</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven raised an eyebrow. "Who?"</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven nodded at Luo Zheng and soon enough, a figure appeared above the latter's head. It was none other the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord, or rather, a strand of his soul.</p>

  <p>"The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord..." the Grandmaster of Heaven could only murmur in astonishment. Was he truly seeing correctly?</p>

  <p>He had no idea that the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord hid in the Jade Pure Realm, and he never expected to see him here.</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord gave him a small smile. "The three of us have finally gathered together. What a beautiful and exciting surprise."</p>

  <p>"I am surprised but not excited," the Grandmaster of Heaven replied coldly. He still held a few grudges.</p>

  <p>"It seems you're still angry about the past. Given the chance, I'll have Ziya apologize to you personally," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven harrumphed. "That disciple of yours..."</p>

  <p>As soon as Ziya's name was mentioned, the frown on the Grandmaster of Heaven's face grew worse.</p>

  <p>During the battle in the Li Shan mountain, he had been exiled in the Deleting Space by Othniel and got kicked out by Ziya. Never had he been so humiliated before in his entire life.</p>

  <p>"I'm here to discuss an alliance with the Monkey Spirit King, not to talk about the old days with you," he grumbled pointedly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded. "That is correct. The Monkey Spirit King has entrusted the matter to us. You can discuss it with us."</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven couldn't help but frown at Luo Zheng's words.</p>

  <p>"What did you just say?"</p>
