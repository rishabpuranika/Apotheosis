<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2734 Difficult To Deal With </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The speed of the little fiends was extremely fast as they moved.</p>

  <p>But Nicholas was quick to react.</p>

  <p>It seemed that he could always foresee any impending attack and was ready to block it precisely!</p>

  <p>He clapped his hands as two black palm shadows clapped five times in an instant.</p>

  <p>"Puff! Puff! Puff!..."</p>

  <p>The fiends currently moving at a high speed were all thrown away by the great force. Some of them were even thrown a hundred miles away.</p>

  <p>The other little fiends crashed into the rocks and in turn had created a crater as deep as ten thousand feet. Some were smashed into the lava lake which had caused a lava tide that was tens of thousands of feet high.</p>

  <p>If it was a consummate True God that was hit by Nicholas' palms, the person would have been smashed to pieces.</p>

  <p>Even if it was a Demi-holy Being or a Holy Being, the result would not be inferior to the damage inflicted to a consummate True God. They would have been seriously injured!</p>

  <p>However, these little fiends were completely unharmed.</p>

  <p>A little fiend crawled out of the messy gravel, his sharp eyes looking ahead.</p>

  <p>Emerging from the mist, waves of internal momentum slowly spread out...</p>

  <p>Although other Holy Beings could not make such powerful attack like Nicholas, they could set up various enchanted barriers like what Jeremiah did.</p>

  <p>The purple mist would eventually dissipate, and they just needed to hold on to survive past it.</p>

  <p>"There is a very powerful guy who can locate us, but how did he do it?" a little fiend voiced out with a strange expression.</p>

  <p>"I'll give it another shot. I almost cut his head off just now!" another fiend carrying the heavy broadsword on his hand gave a suggestion. This fiend was called 'Greed'.</p>

  <p>"It's no use. I think that guy could predict what we will do in advance.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, he wouldn't have been so accurate in his attack," a little fiend named 'Pride' remarked as he shook his head.</p>

  <p>In terms of speed alone, the speed of the little fiends was among the fastest in the divine land.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings who cultivated Spiritual Wind Godly Way couldn't even be their match.</p>

  <p>However, the powerful masters in the divine land could use their spiritual sense to locate their opponents. And in order to reach them, they would use the Grand Teleportation.</p>

  <p>The little fiends would only have a difficulty in dealing with a Holy Being if it was in other places. But the Space Law in the Abyss Demon Region was ineffective. The warriors couldn't make use of their spiritual sense, so they were at the mercy of the little fiends.</p>

  <p>"Caw, caw. You, the most lewd guy, why don't you induce them?" the little fiend called 'Pride' yelled.</p>

  <p>"You are the most lewd guy!" Hearing the words, one of the little fiends felt unhappy. This little fiend represented 'Lust'. He had a special talent, which was to lead the target to an illusory world and make them indulged in lust and dream.</p>

  <p>For the little fiend to perform his special talent, he needed the help of a certain method.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings and Demi-holy Beings were people with strong wills.</p>

  <p>Under such a circumstance, it was impossible for 'Lust' to perform his skills.</p>

  <p>Just as the five fiends were talking, a cold voice rang out, "You are all a group of waste! It is such a waste for the master to have raised you for so many years!"</p>

  <p>"Wrath comes, ha-ha!"</p>

  <p>"If you are not a waste, you go ahead!"</p>

  <p>"They are the Holy Beings of the divine land. They are the most powerful existences. Even the master is very serious this time!" the little fiends shouted one after another.</p>

  <p>"Humph! You all come with me... "</p>

  <p>Just as the last word was spoken, the fiend named 'Wrath' rushed into the purple mist.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>It only took a few seconds for him to cover the distance of several hundred miles.</p>

  <p>"Boom! Boom! Boom..."</p>

  <p>The moment Wrath rushed to the Holy Beings, he had immediately triggered the lightning trap that was set by a Demi-holy Being.</p>

  <p>A series of lightning fiercely flashed, but not even a single streak of lightning had been able to touch him.</p>

  <p>After Wrath passed through the lightning trap, waves of cold air instantly surrounded him. The cold air quickly condensed on the surface of his body, trying to freeze him in place.</p>

  <p>However, as he moved at a supersonic speed and even before the cold air could condense into ice, it was shattered by Wrath.</p>

  <p>"They are coming again!"</p>

  <p>"Watch out, everybody!"</p>

  <p>"Consummate True Gods stand in the middle!"</p>

  <p>Seeing that the enchanted barriers and the traps were triggered, everyone became alerted that the little fiends were coming again.</p>

  <p>The consummate True Gods knew that they had no ability to fight back when faced with the little fiends whose speed was super fast. The Holy Beings could only protect them in the middle to avoid meaningless casualties.</p>

  <p>Nicholas' expression was still as calm as water.</p>

  <p>If these fiends only relied on their fast speed, he could definitely cope with them.</p>

  <p>"They are coming!"</p>

  <p>He stood still as his eyes were narrowed.</p>

  <p>As he had already predicted his opponents' move, he raised his hand and slashed in the air!</p>

  <p>In midair not far from where he was standing, a black palm shadow also hacked down from the sky.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>This strike precisely landed on Wrath, just as he had calculated.</p>

  <p>The two-foot long body of Wrath had crashed directly into the ground.</p>

  <p>After a while, no sound was heard.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings who had been watching the scene looked at each other, wondering what the little fiend was doing.</p>

  <p>As they were caught in confusion to what was happening, the ground started to crack.</p>

  <p>A huge claw stretched out from the ground.</p>

  <p>"It's painful..."</p>

  <p>Wrath cried out as he rose from the ground. He was originally only two feet high, but now he had turned into ten feet tall.</p>

  <p>"He has grown!"</p>

  <p>The change on the little fiend had made Nicholas slightly frown.</p>

  <p>Unlike the rest of the little fiends, this little fiend didn't take the advantage of his fast speed to rush toward them, but had approached them briskly.</p>

  <p>Every one of the Holy Beings were already feeling vexed because of the previous attacks. And now, there was this little fiend which could be served as a live target. They certainly would not let go of this opportunity.</p>

  <p>"Da! Da! Da!"</p>

  <p>A red circle of light appeared on the fiend's head.</p>

  <p>Countless flame spears materialized from the halo of light and directly shot towards the little fiend.</p>

  <p>The power of the internal momentum contained in each of the flame spears was completely concentrated without any leak of heat.</p>

  <p>The strike was activated by Clark.</p>

  <p>At the same time the attack was released, a few warriors from the group had also moved to attack. They were Murphy, Jeremiah and other six or seven Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>With so many Holy Beings attacking together, the power burst out was beyond imagination.</p>

  <p>All the attacks were currently poured on to the little fiend.</p>

  <p>When Rachelle, Troy, Shahn and some others had witnessed the scene, they were greatly shocked.</p>

  <p>They had only entered the Abyss Demon Region not long ago, but these strange looking little fiends were simply too difficult to deal with. They had actually caused a group of Holy Beings to feel so frustrated...</p>

  <p>If they reached the bottom of the Abyss Demon Region and faced those truly powerful fiends, what kind of predicament would they even encounter?</p>

  <p>The attacks had continued for some time.</p>

  <p>Nicholas gently waved his hand, and then Clark and the rest had also stopped attacking when they noticed the order.</p>

  <p>A great sense of pressure came out from the burning flame before it dissipated.</p>

  <p>As the smoke cleared, it was evident that Wrath was not hurt at all!</p>

  <p>Instead, he turned into a huge being that was over ten thousand feet tall, appearing in front of everyone.</p>

  <p>"Ha ha ha, I like this kind of power!" the huge fiend spoke with a twisted smile on his face.</p>

  <p>Different from the other little fiends, the more painful Wrath felt, the more furious he was. The more he was driven by fury, his strength and body would constantly grow larger.</p>
