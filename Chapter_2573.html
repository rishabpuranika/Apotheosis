<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2573 Bones Buried In The Ground </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Luo Zheng had absorbed one blood wild bone before and it gave him a strange feeling of something about to sprout.</p>

  <p>Despite the strangeness of the sensation, there was no pain.</p>

  <p>This time though, when the brown Wild God Power penetrated his wound and entered his body, Luo Zheng immediately felt a searing pain quite similar to a red-hot knife cutting through his flesh.</p>

  <p>"Uh!" he couldn't help but groan.</p>

  <p>Both Giacomo and the old man had warned him of the Body Tribulations' unbearable pain so Luo Zheng was, fortunately, a bit prepared for what was coming.</p>

  <p>He had already experienced all types of pain but was able to endure all of them.</p>

  <p>The Body Tribulations were said to be terrifying but, in the end, the pain was merely physical - at least, that was what Luo Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>Now that he was experiencing it, he realized that the pain affected his soul as well!</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>Another wound appeared on Luo Zheng's back and the golden blood that streamed down from it turned into a blood arrow that hit the wall. At the same time, more Wild God Power squeezed in through his wounds.</p>

  <p>"Szzz..."</p>

  <p>All Luo Zheng could do was grit his teeth and take deep breaths.</p>

  <p>As time went by, the number of wounds on his body increased.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng now looked as if he had been beaten terribly with his body almost covered from head to toe with wounds. Some were as long as two feet, others as small as two inches. Not a single place in his body remained unmarked and the Wild God Power in the blood wild bones continuously penetrated his bloodstream through each opening.</p>

  <p>"The second batch of blood wild bones..." Giacomo took out another golden bag and emptied it of its contents. dozens of fist-sized, brown wild bones rolled out.</p>

  <p>Each share contained around two hundred pieces of blood wild bones which meant Luo Zheng was to consume two thousand from all ten shares altogether.</p>

  <p>However, there were only about ten thousand blood wild bones in the whole of the Nine Li race's reserves. That meant Luo Zheng was about to consume one-tenth of the race's entire supply of blood wild bones.</p>

  <p>The muscles in Luo Zheng's body were close to snapping when the Body Tribulations paused briefly.</p>

  <p>It was a moment of relief and Luo Zheng chose to sit very still. Any slight movement would riddle his entire body with immense pain.</p>

  <p>The relief lasted for a few seconds before another wave of violent pain washed over him again.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>There was a sickening crack as his rib broke unexpectedly...</p>

  <p>Given Luo Zheng's cultivation level, his bones were even stronger than supreme primordial weapons.</p>

  <p>Not even ordinary True Gods could break through his physical defenses, however, the Body Tribulations were an entirely different matter. Not even his bones were able to resist.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>There was another cracking sound as his shank bone also gave in and broke.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, Luo Zheng's entire body was riddled with cracking noises, like internal firecrackers that brought intense pain each time something broke. Blood shot out from his wounds and formed a blood mist around him.</p>

  <p>Never had Luo Zheng been so seriously injured. To go through the Body Tribulations was like going through hell itself and for the first time, Luo Zheng actually doubted if he could actually survive this!</p>

  <p>As his bones broke one by one, his spine also found it hard to support his body. As a result, Luo Zheng, who had been sitting crossed-legged, fell on the floor. All of his bones were broken and he had no strength to even pull himself back up.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Wild God Power continued to penetrate into his broken bones, aggravating the pain he suffered.</p>

  <p>On top of the Cave of Wildness, Giacomo watched this scene in silence.</p>

  <p>The Body Tribulations were hellish but also proved to be a great opportunity.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng couldn't survive this then his entire body would collapse and his cultivation would be gone.</p>

  <p>However, if he managed to endure then he would be able to reshape himself and also obtain the Nine Li Wild Body.</p>

  <p>Everything depended on his willpower!</p>

  <p>"Your body is too strong. No wonder you were given ten shares of blood wild bones for the Body Tribulations..." Giacomo muttered as he refined the third batch of blood wild bones.</p>

  <p>The 'Body Tribulations' was actually a general term. When one's corporeal body reached a certain level, it would disintegrate on its own.</p>

  <p>There would be five tribulations that would happen: Flesh Cracking Tribulation, Bones Breaking Tribulation, Meridians Breaking Tribulation, Blood Boiling Tribulation, and Marrow Damaging Tribulation. All in all, these were what constituted the Body Tribulations.</p>

  <p>There was no way of intervening in this process. Unlike Heavenly Tribulations, Body Tribulations weren't something caused externally.</p>

  <p>Judging from the sounds coming from below, Giacomo was sure that Luo Zheng was now undergoing the second tribulation.</p>

  <p>Only after surviving all five tribulations could one rebuild their body - a new body infused of blood wild bones. It was only then that the cultivator would get to own the Nine Li Wild Body!</p>

  <p>With all his bones broken, Luo Zheng sank to the ground motionlessly.</p>

  <p>After his bones, it was his meridians that began to break down.</p>

  <p>The pain was so insufferable. Luo Zheng thought he was going to die. However, he could do nothing but endure.</p>

  <p>As he went through this painful process, Luo Zheng didn't notice his golden blood quietly integrating itself into the walls of the Cave of Wildness.</p>

  <p>Etched onto the walls were exquisite bone patterns used by the Nine Li race to guide the Wild God Power.</p>

  <p>At that moment, however, Luo Zheng's golden blood smeared across these bone patterns and penetrated into the small cracks.</p>

  <p>The space under the cave remained part of the bone tower and the golden blood that flowed through the cracks made its way down to the bottom of the tower...</p>

  <p>One hundred feet...</p>

  <p>One thousand feet...</p>

  <p>Ten thousand feet...</p>

  <p>One hundred thousand feet...</p>

  <p>Ten million feet...</p>

  <p>The bone tower outside was just a small part of the beast's bone but about one-sixth of it was buried underground which was about forty million feet long.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng's golden blood flowed down, it also infused itself onto the part of the bone buried underground. This was the vertebra of the Chaos Ancient God!</p>

  <p>Half of the Chaos Ancient God's bones were buried underground and the bone towers that were exposed above ground were actually his ribs in the chest.</p>

  <p>"Drip, drip, drip..."</p>

  <p>As the golden blood dripped into the inner part of the vertebra, it converged and congealed into a palm-sized blood ball. This blood ball seemed sentient and rolled into the space within the bone. Then, it began to jump forward at high speed...</p>

  <p>It was as if a special force pushed the blood ball forward at an unimaginably fast speed, crossing hundreds of millions of miles in just five minutes.</p>

  <p>As the blood ball reached the end of the vertebra, it seeped into a huge skull.</p>

  <p>This skull was so enormous, as if it opened its mouth, it could devour the entire divine land in one gulp if it wanted to. This was the skull of the Chaos Ancient God!</p>
