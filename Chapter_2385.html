  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng's words clearly suggested who Joy was. Yudie was an intelligent woman, and she understood that Joy was a senior.</p>

  <p>She walked over to Joy and bowed to her. "Nice to meet you. Pardon me, but I'm unaware as to how to address you."</p>

  <p>"Just call me Joy," smiled Joy.</p>

  <p>"Alright. Good to see you, Joy," Yudie said sweetly.</p>

  <p>Then Aura and Freya bowed to Joy.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, you haven't introduced them to me," said Joy while looking at Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng gave her a smile and introduced his wives to Joy one by one.</p>

  <p>Joy chuckled to herself as Zheng introduced the women to her. Thinking of Liusu's reaction on the Floating Island, she sighed in her heart. 'This guy is as good as his father in relationships.'</p>

  <p>When Zheng introduced Imogen to Joy, Imogen nodded coldly to her and said, "I'm Yudie's master, and you're a friend of Zheng's father. I'm a senior to them too, just as you are, so there's no need for me to heed etiquette in front of you, right?"</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled weakly and said, "This is how Lady Yu always is."</p>

  <p>Joy didn't mind Imogen's bluntness. After examining the women briefly, she said, "They haven't totally mastered the Godly Way, so they can't really enter the divine land, can they?"</p>

  <p>"No, they can't," Zheng said.</p>

  <p>Among the three women, Aura was comparatively weaker, whereas Yudie and Freya were always neck and neck talent-wise.</p>

  <p>However, back then, there were only about ten people in the entire universe whose Lotus Flowers bloomed fully and who had mastered the Godly Way. Now, in such a short period, even though they lived in the fairy palace, it wouldn't be that easy for them to become proving godly warriors.</p>

  <p>"That isn't easy to accomplish," Joy said. She paused for a moment and waved her hand. Three light green pills appeared in her hand. "These Enlightenment Pills will greatly enhance your talents. Consider them a gift from me since this is the first time that we have met. Please take them."</p>

  <p>"Really? They can enhance talents?" Yudie and the other two women had a surprised expression on their faces.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Joy, much to their delight.</p>

  <p>The Enlightenment Pill was a better kind of seven times refined pill.</p>

  <p>These pills were quite rare even in the rich clans on the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>The materials required to refine them came from the Soul Wilderness.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings had many children. Thus they selected those who were distinctly talented.</p>

  <p>Some of the Holy Beings' offspring had special bloodlines. Nonetheless, they were not quite talented as to master the Godly Way or acquire the Godly Tile, so they needed the Enlightenment Pills to improve their talents.</p>

  <p>The thing was, the pill would only affect a person once.</p>

  <p>The female disciples in the Purple Soul Hall cultivated the Purple Aura Godly Way, and overall, they were weaker in talent than the other disciples from the Floating Islands. Therefore, Joy had spent a lot of money getting a few Enlightenment Pills in case she needed any. As an act of generosity, she had gifted the pills to the three women.</p>

  <p>"These Enlightenment Pills won't enable you to become the real talents of the rich clans on the Floating Islands, but they'll be enough for you to master the Godly Way," Joy said.</p>

  <p>Liusu and Nelly were two examples of the rich clans' talents.</p>

  <p>"However, even if you master the Godly Way and have the Godly Tile, I'm afraid you still won't be able to enter the divine land. You'll have to come up with something else if you want to do so," added Joy.</p>

  <p>Before Zheng had acquired his Godly Tile, he had experienced the exchange of blood before he was able to sneak out of the universe and escape the punishment of the Ruling Slate.</p>

  <p>If Yudie, Aura, and Freya became True Gods, they would break the Rule 833 of the Ruling Slate the moment they'd step out of the fairy palace, thus resulting in their punishment.</p>

  <p>"If this pill can really help in understanding the Godly Way, I'd be really grateful to you. I'll leave everything behind and focus on learning the Godly Way," Yudie said with a smile.</p>

  <p>Understanding Godly Way and becoming a True God was something quite extraordinary for a person to achieve.</p>

  <p>Even the Supreme Lords in the universe never had such an opportunity.</p>

  <p>With the pills, these women stood a fine chance. The idea of becoming a True God excited them.</p>

  <p>"Welcome again to the fairy palace, Demi-holy Being," said Saul, who politely bowed to Joy.</p>

  <p>Joy had been here before, and Saul remembered her.</p>

  <p>Then Saul led everyone into the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>Joy recognized the place as soon as she entered. It brought back many memories of her previous visit to the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>As they entered the main hall, they heard someone screaming from the side hall. The scream was followed by a loud thud as if someone fell.</p>

  <p>Yudie's expression changed. She rushed towards the side hall and said angrily, "I've told you a thousand times not to let Geoffrey do it anymore, but you won't listen!"</p>

  <p>Immortal Book opened the door of the side hall and rushed in without even greeting Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Geoffrey? What's the matter?"</p>

  <p>Zheng had a concerned expression on his face as everyone hurried towards the side hall.</p>

  <p>He saw white pieces of paper lying everywhere on the ground of the side hall, with palm-sized words written on them. A teenager dressed in white was lying in Yudie's arms. Zheng gave a sigh of relief when he found out that the boy had fainted only.</p>

  <p>Zheng walked towards Geoffrey and put a hand on his forehead. Wisps of soul power slowly seeped into Geoffrey's mind.</p>

  <p>When he touched the boy's soul, a trace of shock appeared on Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>It had been only two years since he last saw his son. Was the boy's soul this powerful already?</p>

  <p>Zheng was a little baffled.</p>

  <p>Zheng's soul had first reached the Jasper Fighting Soul Realm, then the Silver Fighting Soul Realm and later, the Gold Fighting Soul Realm. At last, he cultivated the True God Soul, and he had slowly made a breakthrough in his soul level.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey hadn't gone through such processes as his father had. Of course, he hadn't reached Zheng's level either, yet his soul seemed to be quite strong!</p>

  <p>"His soul is exhausted. He will be fine after some rest," Zheng said to Yudie.</p>

  <p>Yudie appeared dissatisfied as she listened to Zheng. Her beautiful eyes were burning in rage as she snapped at Immortal Book, "You did this to him! You asked him to immerse himself in these Sanskrit words every day. Sooner or later, you'll kill him!"</p>

  <p>Yudie's love for her son knew no bounds. She didn't want to see Geoffrey get hurt, not even in the slightest, let alone take unnecessary risks.</p>

  <p>Joy was quietly pacing in the side hall, her face wearing a surprised look.</p>

  <p>"This boy can decipher Sanskrit?"</p>

  <p>Immortal Book then greeted Joy. During Joy's first visit, she had borrowed Bromley's books in the library, and he was an acquaintance of hers. Immortal Book laughed and said, "Don't underestimate the boy!</p>

  <p>Master has left behind a great deal of Sanskrit words, and this kid has deciphered about thirty percent of them."</p>

  <p>"What?" asked Joy in amazement.</p>

  <p>For so many divine eras, a large number of golden Sanskrit words had been passed down across the divine land, and a portion of the golden Sanskrit words was deciphered, but it turned out to be worthless.</p>

  <p>Genuine rare Sanskrit words were collected by wealthy clans on the Floating Islands. Some of them were collected by the Holy Beings. They were so rare no one had seen a printed version.</p>

  <p>It was extremely difficult to decipher those rare Sanskrit words. Up to now, few of them had been deciphered completely. Deciphering Sanskrit required extremely rich experience. Sometimes, the decrypted Sanskrit content made no sense at all.</p>

  <p>Bromley was quite fond of travelling in the chaos. Due to Holy Jay, the Sanskrit he had collected was of great value. One deciphered chapter of his collection would already mean a great deal. But the kid lying in front of Joy had deciphered thirty percent of it. Joy couldn't believe her ears.</p>

  <p>How could she not be surprised?</p>

  <p>When she looked at the words translated by Geoffrey, she froze.</p>

  <p>"Is this... the Truth of Godly Way?" she stammered.</p>
