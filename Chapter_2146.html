<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2146 Ruling Slate (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>As Master Evil had said, the rules of a divine city were very strict. As such, most of the people there would always follow such regulations.</p>

  <p>Even top-rank True Gods wouldn't dare to act rashly in the city, let alone a mere low-rank True God!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had heard a lot of threats in his life. However, this was probably the lamest one he had ever heard. He even suspected about how this person became a True God with such stupid brain.</p>

  <p>What Luo Luo Zheng didn't know was that it wasn't difficult to become a True God in the divine land. The achievement of such a title was rather easier than he had imagined.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the strength of True Gods varied greatly. For example, Marko and Mateo were low-rank True Gods, but they were Murphy's disciples.</p>

  <p>Their techniques and abilities were still above ordinary True Gods. Even if they encountered some ordinary True God, they would be able to kill their opponent in the blink of an eye!</p>

  <p>Blayd was also a low-rank True God. However, he was comparatively much stronger than Marko, Mateo, Wynn, and some others.</p>

  <p>That was also the reason why Master Evil suggested Luo Luo Zheng join a wealthy clan on some Floating Island first. Luo Luo Zheng could rapidly increase his strength if he became a disciple of a Holy Being. Under a Holy Being's tutelage, Luo Zheng's comprehension and abilities would significantly improve.</p>

  <p>"Leave what behind?" Luo Luo Zheng asked in confusion.</p>

  <p>The middle-aged man laughed coldly. With an arrogant tone, he replied,</p>

  <p>"Of course I meant your divine might coins!"</p>

  <p>As he heard the middle-aged man's demand, Luo Luo Zheng carelessly took out several divine might coins. With a callous look at his face, he held the coins in his hand. Then, he asked in an aloof tone, "Are you talking about these?"</p>

  <p>As the middle-aged man saw the divine might coins in Luo Zheng's hand, his eyes suddenly lit up with greed. A look similar to a hungry dog painted the middle-aged man's face. He immediately nodded, "Yes, yes. That's it!" As he said that, the middle-aged man quickly reached out to grab the divine might coins.</p>

  <p>"In your dreams!"</p>

  <p>With a flip of his hand, Luo Luo Zheng immediately put away the divine might coins as if by magic?</p>

  <p>"You imbecile! You are courting death..."</p>

  <p>After he was toyed with twice by Luo Luo Zheng, the True God was finally angered from embarrassment! An intense expression was seen in his face.</p>

  <p>Snowflakes appeared in his eyes as an icy Mu Ning surged out from his body.</p>

  <p>The middle-aged man was a True God that cultivated the Snow Divine Dao. Nonetheless, Luo Luo Zheng had already seen such cultivation in the Corridor of Emperor in the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>Generally, a True God that came from a universe was far more powerful than an ordinary True God in the divine land.</p>

  <p>The Mu Ning released by the man was indeed sharp, but Luo Zheng's state of mind was not affected at all. As such, he also quickly retreated.</p>

  <p>"Master Evil, didn't you say that it is forbidden to fight in the Mirror City?" Luo Luo Zheng asked curiously as he watched the middle-aged man make his move.</p>

  <p>Master Evil was also speechless. "You're the one that agitated this idiot!</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, he will also pay for his misdemeanor."</p>

  <p>The commotion had also alarmed the guards of the teleportation channels. The guards were also astonished. They looked at the True God as if they saw a fool. A displeased thought passed by their heads. 'What kind of idiot dared to create trouble in the divine city?'</p>

  <p>At the same time, a blue light shot out from the center of Mirror City.</p>

  <p>Along with that, a stone slab slowly rose up from the ground and then flew rapidly to the west of the Mirror City.</p>

  <p>After the stone slab appeared, it also attracted the attention of countless martial artists in the Mirror City. Since they already knew what the stone slab symbolized, many of the martial artists had displeased expression as they saw the stone slab.</p>

  <p>"Which idiot is fighting in the Mirror City again!"</p>

  <p>"Does that fool really think that the rules set by the Qian Clan are just for show? Isn't this courting death!?"</p>

  <p>"Why is it heading towards the west side of the city? What the hell is happening there?"</p>

  <p>Because they feared the punishment of this stone slab, all of the martial artists in the Mirror City were careful. They didn't even dare to use life vitality to send voice messages. Fights wouldn't normally happen since the warriors wouldn't even activate their life vitality, much less condense the momentum within their bodies with their Godly Tiles. Normally, when they cultivated or learned martial arts from their masters, they would go to a designated area in the city. If they weren't careful enough, they would receive the punishment from the stone slab.</p>

  <p>A furious expression painted the True God that faced Luo Luo Zheng. The True God then condensed the momentum in his body. However, before he could do anything, a flash of blue light shone from the horizon. Suddenly, from the blue light arose the stone slab, which flew towards the True God with intense precision and high speed. Panic immediately enveloped him as he was scared out of his wits. With a bitter face, he said, "I, I... I didn't want to do anything!"</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the stone slab was not a human and did not listen to the True God's explanation. It continued its advance toward its target. From the surface of the stone slab, small dots of lightning were emitted. The small dots quickly condensed and formed a thick bolt of lightning that shot towards the True God.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Although the lightning looked very ordinary, the power contained within it was almost unparalleled. The destructive capabilities of the released lightning would terrify most martial artists.</p>

  <p>"Ah..."</p>

  <p>The lightning struck the True God's body and the lightning fragments continued to move around his body. The True God let out a miserable scream as he frantically rolled on the ground. After a while, the True God lost consciousness and lay pathetically on the ground.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng felt a bit of life energy in the True God. He knew that the middle-aged man was still alive. Nonetheless, Luo Luo Zheng still felt cautious of the stone slab. If it was him who had been struck by the lightning, even if he did not die, he would at least lose half his life?</p>
