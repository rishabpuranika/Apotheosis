<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The bright scorching sun shone high up in the sky. All of a sudden, it disappeared.</p>

  <p>The light that was shining upon Zheng a moment ago vanished in an instant.</p>

  <p>With that, a strange expression flickered in his eyes.</p>

  <p>The Evil God raised his hand gently. The diamond-shaped pieces created from the Ways-blending Energy assembled together and danced upon his palm.</p>

  <p>The light of the pieces shimmered. It was a beautiful and splendid thing to behold. However, it was also extremely dangerous.</p>

  <p>"I have to thank you for your help. You have given me an opportunity to practice the Ways-blending Energy to this extent," said the Evil God with a wry smile. "As far as I know, there are not a lot of Godly Ways found within common people's inner worlds."</p>

  <p>Zheng remained silent for a while.</p>

  <p>He did not care about the Evil God's words. He was most interested in the Ways-blending Energy instead.</p>

  <p>Three thousand was not always the exact number. Different masters had different methods of summarizing Godly Ways.</p>

  <p>The three thousand Godly Ways Zheng and the Evil God had practiced was summarized by Chiyou.</p>

  <p>Both Zheng and the Evil God were quite accustomed to using these three thousand Godly Ways.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng found something unique in the Ways-blending Energy now.</p>

  <p>There was a gleam of faint white arc light among the pieces.</p>

  <p>But because the white arc light only occupied one three-thousandth of the Ways-blending Energy, Zheng could not clearly make sense what it was.</p>

  <p>What did the Evil God put into the Ways-blending Energy?</p>

  <p>The Evil God noticed that Zheng was gazing at the Ways-blending Energy.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, he broke into an even bigger smile. "Are you wondering why my Ways-blending Energy is so powerful?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Zheng replied with all honesty. He was really intrigued by what he saw.</p>

  <p>"It's because the three thousand Godly Ways you pride yourself in are flawed. Hahaha..." The Evil God laughed wildly and continued, "Today I will show you something completely extraordinary, so that you may know what the perfect Ways-blending Energy truly is!"</p>

  <p>He spread out both of his hands and the diamond-shaped Ways-blending Energy spread like the wings. This display of power was remarkable.</p>

  <p>The structure of the Ways-blending Energy was extremely complicated. Its current state was very unpredictable and unstable but it seemed rather mutable. Moreover, the power contained within it was awfully terrifying.</p>

  <p>"Yan, retreat!" Zheng ordered at once. There was no time to waste.</p>

  <p>Yan held the silk cloth with one hand while she made a gesture with the other.</p>

  <p>The power of the Ways-blending Energy was indeed terrifying but Yan believed she had the power to withstand it.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, Zheng's tone was very serious. Yan pursed her lips but chose to follow her brother's order. Obviously, Zheng was concerned for her safety.</p>

  <p>Yan was able to sense her brother's emotions very clearly. She knew all too well that Zheng wanted to deal with the rebel who came out of his inner world personally. She fully respected Zheng's decision to do this on his own.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Yan leapt away from them. She had already put quite some distance between her and the Evil God. Meanwhile, she continued to stare warily at the Evil God and the giant eye that was hiding on the other side of the main peak. She knew she shouldn't let her guard down for even a second.</p>

  <p>The giant eye was afraid of the silk cloth. It wouldn't dare to fight back just yet. It remained hidden and unmoving.</p>

  <p>As the Evil God gently pushed his hands forward, the diamond-shaped Ways-blending Energy pelted towards Zheng like feathers.</p>

  <p>Zheng remained standing still and didn't bother to dodge the attack.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>Several scorching suns exploded around Zheng.</p>

  <p>As they exploded, they emitted dazzling lights which disappeared in the blink of an eye. Zheng merely looked at them and returned his gaze to the Evil God.</p>

  <p>There wasn't even a single scratch on Zheng after the attack. He was completely unharmed.</p>

  <p>"Were you able to see it clearly? Hahaha!" The Evil God laughed once again and said, "Never in your lifetime would you be able to uncover the secret hidden inside it. Don't even bother trying to solve this mystery. I am the only one who can achieve it in this world!"</p>

  <p>The members and disciples of the other races heard this while they were fighting against the Chaotic Source Spirits. The Evil God's statement thoroughly baffled them.</p>

  <p>They were fully aware that the power of the Ways-blending Energy was strong. But what was the Evil God so proud of? They couldn't quite understand it.</p>

  <p>There were a lot of powerful masters in the Source World. Many of them had put a lot of effort in studying the Ways-blending Energy. However, all of them only reached a dead-end. Ultimately, they had no choice but to give up.</p>

  <p>They had to admit that the Evil God was powerful. It was just that they didn't have much interest in the Ways-blending Energy. All they wanted to do was merge with the Other Shore Tokens and obtain greater Other Shore Power.</p>

  <p>They were not the only ones who thought of it like this.</p>

  <p>Through the magic array, the leaders of many large races waiting at the entrance of the Chaotic Source World were able to see clearly what just happened.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth frowned at the Evil God's statement. She didn't understand it as well.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Athemar and Winchell looked grave. The members of the Separate Abyss race and the Bearing race, and the Ear Mice also shared the same sentiment with the two.</p>

  <p>"Winchell," Athemar said, "it seems like there is a special energy contained in the Ways-blending Energy of that young man in black." Athemar noticed something while watching Zheng through the magic array.</p>

  <p>Even though they did not cultivate so many Godly Ways, they had a general understanding of the energies that existed in the whole world. He was quite perplexed at the kind of energy he just observed.</p>

  <p>Winchell nodded his head grimly. "Never in my life have I seen such an energy before," he responded.</p>

  <p>"Is it the power of some Other Shore Token?" an Ear Mouse speculated as it tried to comprehend it as well.</p>

  <p>"The Other Shore Power couldn't be fused so perfectly," Athemar said as he shook his head. "It is truly strange and quite inexplicable."</p>

  <p>It seemed like they didn't have a total understanding of the energies after all. The vast majority of people did not know that the original energy of this world was actually incomplete.</p>

  <p>Fuxi sat on top of the snowy mountain. As he moved his gaze back from the edge of the Icy Snow Province to the core area of the Chaotic Source World, he also witnessed the scorching suns.</p>

  <p>His eyes narrowed slightly when he noticed the white arc light within the energy. Like most of them, he was puzzled too.</p>

  <p>"How is that even possible?"</p>

  <p>Fuxi had successfully merged three thousand Godly Ways. He also had a better understanding of the Ways-blending Energy than all the leaders gathered at the entrance of the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>"Why is there an extra energy? Where does it come from? If I am not mistaken, this didn't exist between heaven and earth in the past," Fuxi wondered out loud. After a while, something dawned upon him. "I see... No wonder the Ways-blending Energy cannot be perfected. Without this energy, they could not be fully merged. Any efforts will be in vain! Now the only question is, where did this guy get this energy?"</p>

  <p>Fuxi was absolutely stumped.</p>

  <p>Many years ago, people thought that the Ways-blending Energy was the original energy. Once the energy of three thousand Godly Ways was fully merged, even the truth-level theurgies wouldn't be able to match it.</p>

  <p>Lots of supreme masters took severe painstaking efforts for countless years to perfect this. Yet, they still failed to merge the energy of three thousand Godly Ways. Finally, Fuxi, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and the others concluded that the Ways-blending Energy was impossible to complete.</p>

  <p>The Evil God's gaze was fixed on Zheng. He kept watching him as he launched his attack.</p>

  <p>He wanted to see the look of astonishment and disbelief on Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>However, he was completely disappointed. Zheng's expression remained impassive. After a while, Zheng finally opened his mouth to speak. "If I were you, I would not make this energy public," he said in a calm manner.</p>

  <p>"Do you think I'm as cowardly as you are? Don't make me laugh," the Evil God mocked Zheng.</p>

  <p>"After all, you are not able to complete the Ways-blending Energy either,"</p>

  <p>Zheng continued as he shook his head. "But because you have exposed this energy now, people will only covet it."</p>

  <p>"Haha! I can't complete the Ways-blending Energy?" The Evil God's face broke into a proud smile. "I have already merged two thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine Godly Ways, including this one. I only need the Thunderstorm Godly Way now. I am one step away from completion!"</p>

  <p>As the Evil God spoke, he stared arrogantly at Zheng. However, there wasn't any sign of admiration or surprise on Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>Zheng retained his calm demeanor. He replied, "Clearly, you have done a great job. Nevertheless, you will never be able to take that final step because the Ways-blending Energy has more than one flaw."</p>
