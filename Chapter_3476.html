<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Refinement failed..."</p>

  <p>Zheng pursed his lips, unable to hide his disappointment. He shook his head and willed all the crystals to gather into his inner world once again.</p>

  <p>It seemed this magic array only worked for ordinary crystals of Chaotic Source Spirits, not the golden red ones.</p>

  <p>Zheng had to look for another way to refine them.</p>

  <p>He got to his feet. Without saying a word, he stepped into the space channel, immediately transformed into a stream of light and headed straight out of the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>In the sky above the Icy Snow Province, thick, ominous clouds spat out thunderbolts angrily. The lightning twisted in the atmosphere like menacing dragons. Each bolt of lightning was extremely powerful, enough to destroy the heavens and the earth. Gathering all the thunderbolts would garner enough power to destroy the entire Icy Snow Province.</p>

  <p>There were a few human tribes in the Icy Snow Province. Seeing the menacing bolts of lightning in the sky above them, they trembled in fear.</p>

  <p>Some even knelt in the snow, praying that God would not punish them.</p>

  <p>After all the thunderbolts had gathered together, they suddenly shot out towards Fuxi at lightning speed.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>Fuxi calmly stretched out his hand.</p>

  <p>Black and white auras swirled in front of him, shrouding him in a bright light. Once the light died down, he remained standing, unscathed. The Eight Diagrams disk had protected him!</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>The thunderbolts kept striking the Eight Diagrams disk hundreds of times.</p>

  <p>Each time it was struck, the disk would rotate, effectively diffusing the thunderbolt.</p>

  <p>"It's no use, Thunder Dimorphodon. You're no match for me," said Fuxi gravely.</p>

  <p>His voice was like the waves of the sea, which could spread far away even amidst the rumbling thunder.</p>

  <p>In the entirety of the chaos, any strong warrior would tremble before Fuxi.</p>

  <p>He could even fight Chaos Ancient Gods.</p>

  <p>"I am indeed not your match, but there is nothing you can do about me," said the Thunder Dimorphodon in a low voice. This was the first sentence it had uttered since coming to the Icy Snow Province.</p>

  <p>The top ten fierce beasts were by no means ordinary. Every beast had a certain kind of omnipotent innate theurgy, although slightly weaker than truth-level theurgies.</p>

  <p>"If I ran away, you wouldn't be able to catch up with me," the Thunder Dimorphodon taunted.</p>

  <p>"Oh, really?" Fuxi sneered. Circles of white fog spread out from beneath his feet, until he had formed a giant cloud. From Fuxi's cloud, the power of wind and thunder could faintly be felt. "I wonder what makes you so confident."</p>

  <p>At the sight of the cloud beneath Fuxi's feet, the Thunder Dimorphodon's expression quickly changed. "The Heavenly Auspicious Cloud! How did you find this Other Shore Token?"</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Auspicious Cloud was known to greatly increase the speed of its user. It was extremely rare; even powerful warriors like Fuxi were unlikely to stumble upon it.</p>

  <p>The Thunder Dimorphodon was known for its incredible speed. However, if Fuxi used the Heavenly Auspicious Cloud, there was a chance it wouldn't be able to escape.</p>

  <p>"Leave those rings behind, and I'll let you go. We'll just act as though nothing happened." Fuxi's eyes narrowed ruthlessly.</p>

  <p>The Thunder Dimorphodon could clearly tell that Fuxi would be a force to be reckoned with when mad.</p>

  <p>Fuxi, also known as the Human Sovereign, had been supporting the Snake Goddess race of the Pear Hill, but in the Source World, there weren't any strong warriors that had the confidence to face him.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry. Someone asked me to do this. I can't promise you anything..."</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a small dragon made out of lightning appeared above the Thunder Dimorphodon's head. It was also an Other Shore Token!</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>The moment the lightning dragon burst forth, the Thunder Dimorphodon's body began to vibrate violently.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>The tiny flashes of lightning vibrated with the Thunder Dimorphodon in the air. Soon an identical Thunder Dimorphodon materialized. It was the Thunder Dimorphodon's avatar, made of lightning!</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>More and more avatars appeared, one after another. In no time, six avatars had been born.</p>

  <p>Fuxi looked coldly at the seven figures before him. "You chose to fight me face to face because of those idiots. You are more stupid than them. Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>The seven identical Thunder Dimorphodons said at the same time, "Who said I was going to fight you? Haha!"</p>

  <p>Seven huge space channels appeared beside the Thunder Dimorphodons.</p>

  <p>Each avatar headed for their designated space channel.</p>

  <p>"You!"</p>

  <p>Fuxi's expression darkened. Before the figures had entered their space channels, he punched at them.</p>

  <p>Two marks of Eight Diagrams appeared on the bodies of two Thunder Dimorphodons.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>As the two marks of Eight Diagrams exploded, the two Thunder Dimorphodons exploded in a blast of light and then disappeared. The other five, on the other hand, managed to make it to their space channels.</p>

  <p>Fuxi took a step forward, the Heavenly Auspicious Cloud fluttering beneath his feet. He rushed into a space channel, his eyes fixed on the true Thunder Dimorphodon all the time.</p>

  <p>The moment he entered the space channel, his body transformed into a beam of light that sprinted towards the Thunder Dimorphodon.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The true Thunder Dimorphodon flew rapidly along the space channel.</p>

  <p>Seeing Fuxi on its tail, it flapped its wings. Huge thunderbolts filled the entire space channel, heading straight for Fuxi.</p>

  <p>Instead of dodging, Fuxi flew forward, undaunted.</p>

  <p>Activating the Heavenly Auspicious Cloud to its highest speed, he steadily closed the distance between him and the beast.</p>

  <p>When the Thunder Dimorphodon was only about a thousand feet away from Fuxi, he planted a mark of the Eight Diagrams on its body. Then, he threw a fist to it.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The mark of Eight Diagrams suddenly exploded.</p>

  <p>The huge Thunder Dimorphodon was blasted into an electric light, disappearing into the space channel.</p>

  <p>"Is this also an avatar?"</p>

  <p>Fuxi's eyebrows twitched in annoyance.</p>

  <p>The avatars of the Thunder Dimorphodon were very unique. When the avatars appeared, each of them could be the true Thunder Dimorphodon.</p>

  <p>The Thunder Dimorphodon could choose any avatar to be its true body at any given time.</p>

  <p>Even though Fuxi had fixed his spiritual sense on the first Thunder Dimorphodon, the latter could've easily shifted to one of its avatars.</p>

  <p>Seeing that the Thunder Dimorphodon had gotten away, Fuxi became more sullen.</p>

  <p>Reaching out his hand, he tore the void. After ripping a hole in the space channel, he flew out.</p>

  <p>Phew!</p>

  <p>In another long space channel, the Thunder Dimorphodon flapped its wings agitatedly.</p>

  <p>Most of the time, the Thunder Dimorphodon looked like an annoying bat.</p>

  <p>But when lightning danced all over its body, it looked strangely beautiful.</p>

  <p>It wasn't interested in the rings that were snatched from Zheng. Someone had offered an irresistible price, so it decided to take a risk and went to the Icy Snow Province to give it a try.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Fuxi had underestimated it. If it was trapped by Fuxi, it might have died in the Icy Snow Province!</p>

  <p>Phew! Phew!</p>

  <p>With its wings flapping in the air, it quickly advanced forward in the space channel, leaving the Icy Snow Province.</p>

  <p>As the Thunder Dimorphodon flew at high speed, it suddenly sensed something behind it. Turning its head to look, it was shocked to find a huge black ship ripping open the space channel, floating towards it like a ghost.</p>
