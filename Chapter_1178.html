<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Derek hadn't the foggiest notion of what was going on, but that didn't mean he was unaware of what the Mahayana Lotus Flower was.</p>

  <p>What was unexpected was the young man in front of him. He had never thought that such a young individual would be able to activate the Mahayana Lotus Flower.</p>

  <p>To him, such a thing was a complete impossibility.</p>

  <p>The Lotus Flower was divided into the Mahayana Lotus Flower and the Hinayana Lotus Flower. The Hinayana Lotus Flower was characterized by a maximum of nine petals, while the former was much more powerful and had a maximum limit of twenty-seven petals!</p>

  <p>There had been hundreds of warriors who had activated the Hinayana Lotus Flower, but it was extremely rare for any supreme world to have even a single warrior who could activate all the nine petals. Yet even with that kept in mind, in the last 3.6 billion years, the number of warriors who had achieved that wasn't too small.</p>

  <p>However, the situation for the number of warriors who had activated the Mahayana Lotus Flower was completely different.</p>

  <p>In the last tens of thousands of years, there was, maybe, someone in a corner of some supreme world who had activated it. After all, the Upper World was simply too vast; one couldn't blame Derek for being ignorant and ill-informed about these affairs.</p>

  <p>But despite his level of knowledge, Derek himself had never heard of anyone who had activated the Mahayana Lotus Flower.</p>

  <p>He only heard that Supreme Lord Lloyd of the Lloyd World had activated the Mahayana Lotus Flower after passing through the Reincarnation Tribulation 2.6 million years ago. As for other Supreme Lords, Derek was unsure whether they had activated the Mahayana Lotus Flower or not but if they had, news would have spread.</p>

  <p>One thing was certain: only a Supreme Lord could activate the Mahayana Lotus Flower. No wonder Derek didn't believe that Luo Zheng could do that.</p>

  <p>Derek's heart grew heavy and his facial expression turned glum. He could have accepted the fact that Luo Zheng had somehow managed to activate the Nine-petal Lotus Flower, but this news was beyond his level of control. He himself did not know what this meant. The only thing he knew was that this matter would cause an unprecedented sensation and would spread like wildfire if he were to report it to the Upper World through the Reverse Spirit Channel.</p>

  <p>He felt his throat dry up. It had been many years since the Upper World had sent him down to supervise the four divine kingdoms and obtain the Ancestral Dragon's egg.</p>

  <p>Derek knew of his own fate. Most likely, he had only one way to escape this world: find the Ancestral Dragon's egg and then he would be qualified to return to the Upper World.</p>

  <p>If he was able to discover a warrior who could activate the Mahayana Lotus Flower, his fate would also change, and he might even obtain unimaginable benefits as a reward.</p>

  <p>But, could Luo Zheng really do that?</p>

  <p>Derek was still puzzled. This possibility was so small that it was practically negligible. If he were to report this matter and later on it turned out to be fake, the consequences far outweighed the rewards.</p>

  <p>As he mulled this over, he suddenly had a feeling that it might be possible. The Nine-petal Lotus Flower was the limit of the Hinayana Lotus Flower. If one were to count all the warriors who had ever activated the Nine-petal Lotus Flower in the last 3.6 billion years and then count all the warriors who had activated the Mahayana Lotus Flower, then the numbers painted an interesting picture. However small, the possibility was there and it was still appreciable.</p>

  <p>The Nine-petal Lotus Flower in the sky suddenly began to tremble more and more violently in the air, and its petals began to spin faster and faster.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't understand what was going on. He asked the cyan dragon in his mind, "Cyan dragon, what is going on? I thought the Lotus Flower was done after its nine petals! Is it possible for this thing to take root, sprout and grow a second flower?"</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon laughed out loud. "Your idea is strange and far-fetched!</p>

  <p>How could there possibly be a second flower? But from what is happening, it seems like you are activating the Mahayana Lotus Flower now. You have the fate to lead the great world of chaos, Luo Zheng, and it is possible that you can activate the Mahayana Lotus Flower. Just wait and see!"</p>

  <p>"Mahayana Lotus Flower? What the hell is that thing?" Luo Zheng was still puzzled.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon simply said, "You'll understand the difference between the Mahayana Lotus Flower and the Hinayana Lotus Flower in a moment. It's more than just names!"</p>

  <p>Right after the cyan dragon's voice faded, a pistil slowly rose from the center of the Lotus Flower. Strangely, there was a small flower bud in the middle of the pistil.</p>

  <p>Under everyone's watchful and curious gaze, the pistil rose higher and higher, with its bud expanding continuously. The rate of growth was such that it could be seen with the naked eye. Not long after this, the size of the bud surpassed the Nine-petal Lotus Flower itself.</p>

  <p>"There really is a second Lotus Flower, and I was right. Far-fetched, eh?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng chuckled.</p>

  <p>"No. You were wrong! That is the same Lotus Flower!" the cyan dragon retorted.</p>

  <p>After a while, the bud stopped growing but the Lotus Flower rose up, and the petals on its surface fell apart one by one, blooming unceasingly.</p>

  <p>"One petal, two petals, three petals, four petals..." Callan looked at the petals and counted.</p>

  <p>Pretty soon, people could see that the new Lotus Flower had opened up twenty-six beautiful petals. However, the one petal that did not bloom somehow gave everyone a feeling that the contraption was incomplete.</p>

  <p>After it had bloomed completely, it floated in front of everyone's eyes and came to a rest from its terrible and violent shaking. Then it emitted a sweet fragrance, and from the petals, a dazzling flowing light could be seen.</p>

  <p>"This young man is indeed remarkable!" Marine exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Derek immediately remarked, "You are correct! At the very least, he has the fate to lead the world of chaos. Moreover, in the world of chaos, he might not be the absolute protagonist, but he can at least assume a highly important role!"</p>

  <p>"To lead the world of chaos..." Marine had originally intended to say the same. How could she not know that the world of chaos had arrived?</p>

  <p>There was no other way for so many divine-level talents to be present in the four divine kingdoms. In the history of the divine kingdoms, their numbers had never reached the current stage before.</p>

  <p>Even though she knew that when the world of chaos had arrived, numerous divine-level talents would also sprout up, Marine never would have thought that a warrior who carried the fate of leading such a world of chaos would also show up and that she would actually meet such a person.</p>

  <p>Right at that moment, Marine suddenly thought back to what had happened in Immortal Mist's celestial tomb. In the Wheel of Fortune, Zheng's luck had been extremely bad at the beginning. But once he had endured the hardships that the wheel had to offer, his luck had suddenly become the best among them all and he was the first one to pass through the Wheel of Fortune.</p>

  <p>When she thought about this and saw Luo Zheng activate the Mahayana Lotus Flower, her conjecture was confirmed.</p>

  <p>"No wonder his luck was so amazing back then," Marine murmured.</p>

  <p>War King Wind had a smile on his face. His gaze had shifted from the Lotus Flower above his head towards Luo Zheng. To him, Tianxing was becoming more and more satisfying, and was showing up to be perfect.</p>

  <p>War King Wind was a straightforward and short-tempered man. Most of the warriors that cultivated the Fire Law had this kind of character, and if he had something to say or something on his mind, he couldn't hide it even if he wanted to. He looked at Fiona, who was sitting at his side. She was young and beautiful, and her entire body was brimming with the Mu Ning of youth. Although a warrior had a long lifespan, she still had to marry someone someday and in today's age, the sooner the better.</p>

  <p>War King Wind was very picky about his future son-in-law. In fact, several Soul Sea Realm masters had brought up the topic in front of him, but War King Wind had shut them all down. In his eyes, among all the younger generation warriors of the four divine kingdoms, there was not a single person worthy of his daughter's hand. Yes, his future son-in-law had to be perfect.</p>

  <p>Even though Zheng's background was unknown and he appeared to be from the Sky Northern Region, Derek had just spoken so highly of him. Zheng's future was prominent, and for once, War King Wind had found someone who was worthy to be Fiona's husband.</p>

  <p>Therefore, he suddenly asked his daughter, "Fiona, what do you think of Tianxing?"</p>

  <p>War King Wind simply popped the question in front of so many people.</p>

  <p>Although Fiona was innocent, she was still an adult and immediately understood what her father was implying.</p>

  <p>Her charming eyes had originally been fixed on Luo Zheng. When War King Wind opened his mouth, her face turned red, and she retracted her gaze and pouted, "Father, what are you talking about?"</p>

  <p>War King Wind scratched the back of his head. He also knew that his daughter was shy, but this was an important matter to him. If they didn't act quickly, maybe the others would see what was going on and seize this opportunity. They would then introduce their daughters to Luo Zheng. So he wanted to pair Luo Zheng and Fiona as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>When this conversation reached the ears of the other Soul Sea Realm masters, they all showed a trace of understanding. 'This guy is really cunning! With Tianxing's potential, his future would be incalculable! No wonder he wants to marry his daughter off to Tianxing, ' they thought.</p>

  <p>But War King Wind wasn't alone! The other Soul Sea Realm masters also had their own plans, especially those who had young and pretty daughters.</p>

  <p>The Lotus Flower in the sky slowly rotated and its color finally dimmed, slowly disappearing from everyone's sight.</p>

  <p>When he saw this scene, Luo Zheng sighed and told the cyan dragon in his mind, "Alas! I thought that I would be able to activate the last petal too!"</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon sneered, "In your dreams, boy! To be able to activate even a single petal of the Mahayana Lotus Flower is highly difficult. You should be extremely satisfied. Also, as long as the Mahayana Lotus Flower has appeared once, it will appear each time you go through a tribulation."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded as he walked towards the pyramid. He still had a large amount of precious ores to deal with.</p>

  <p>However, at this time, a black thin line suddenly appeared in the sky.</p>
