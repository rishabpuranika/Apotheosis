  <p>
</p>

  <p>However, during the time, Usman was still too weak to defeat Jimena Ji.</p>

  <p>Every time he attempted to throw a punch, he would get a hit first. Every time he attempted to give her a kick, she would be able to dodge it with ease.</p>

  <p>He could not defeat her, and he could not stop thinking about her. As time went by, an obsession formed in his mind, and it was emerging at this very moment.</p>

  <p>Likewise, Jimena Ji was able to tell the identify of this man through Usman's aura. "You must be the Evil God," she said to him.</p>

  <p>"Jimena," the Evil God responded, making it known that he knew who she was.</p>

  <p>As the Evil God confirmed her speculation of who he was, she smiled, thinking of ways she could use to her advantage. "Evil God, perhaps there is no reason for us to stand against each other. We can work together," she said and stared at him with her soft and beautiful eyes.</p>

  <p>The Evil God sneered at her suggestion. "Are you suggesting we cooperate with you? But how?"</p>

  <p>"Join us, and we can fight against the Pear Hill together." Jimena Ji replied slyly.</p>

  <p>"If you truly wish to cooperate with us, why don't you join my Black Ship? We can fight against the Pear Hill then," the Evil God said smugly.</p>

  <p>He was not one that could be convinced so easily, but Jimena Ji refused to give up. She flashed him a seductive look, attempting to have him go more easily on her. "But I'm a member of the Ji Clan. If I join enemy forces by my own will, I would betray my clan. It truly is a pity I can't do so."</p>

  <p>The Evil God scoffed. "It is easy. Just become my woman."</p>

  <p>She felt the Evil God's longing for her. She smiled, believing she had the upper hand in the situation. "Can you give me at least two days to think about your offer?"</p>

  <p>Given the current situation of the Ji Clan, uniting with the Black Ship by marriage should be a good thing.</p>

  <p>The entire time, Shera, who was also on the black ship, was listening to the conversation. When she heard what Jimena Ji said, her slender eyebrows immediately shot up.</p>

  <p>The Evil God stared at Jimena Ji for a long time, making her believe that he was truly appreciating her beauty. However, in a flash of a second, his entire expression changed. His look of admiration turned into a look of derision.</p>

  <p>"The women of the Ji Clan are truly extraordinary. You tried to steer me, didn't you? You wanted to take advantage of Usman's memory to buy more time for yourself. You should have known better. You're about to find out the high price you have to pay to be my woman, but I must tell you, you are not qualified," the Evil God said menacingly.</p>

  <p>"Buzz! Buzz!"</p>

  <p>As soon as the Evil God finished speaking, two conical containers fell on the old man and Jimena Ji, trapping them inside.</p>

  <p>When Jimena Ji processed what just happened, she immediately went feral. Her fingers began to emit astonishing energy, clawing at the surface and the walls of the container in an attempt to free herself.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The energy radiating from her fingertips was from an Other Shore Token on Stage Thirty-three. The energy was so strong and powerful that anything it touched would be destroyed.</p>

  <p>The conical space was no exception. She placed her hands upon one of its walls. When she removed her fingers, the surface revealed ten, burning prints. After a few seconds, the container broke into tiny pieces.</p>

  <p>She thought she was free. She was ready to attack the Evil God. However, right after she broke the first conical container, a second conical container came from above her head, entrapping her body once again. She looked up, only to see that a third one was waiting to go down on her once she escaped the one she was currently in. And forming above the third one was another conical container, and another waited after that— all waiting for their turn to imprison the Ji Clan warriors.</p>

  <p>From the hands of the Evil God appeared two streams of Ways-blending Energy.</p>

  <p>He flew into the sky, making his way towards the conical containers. He placed his hands upon them, and streams of Ways-blending energy began to gather within the containers.</p>

  <p>The Evil God gave a sinister laugh. "Have you ever seen the most perfect power of the Godly Ways Great Unity? You must look at how majestic it is, and you are about to know how majestic it feels. As the first one to die under it, you should feel honored."</p>

  <p>In the past, the Evil God was almost killed by Maximized Energy, but at that time, the energy of all the Godly Ways had been perfectly fused. It wasn't him at the end of the stick anymore. This time, it was him holding it.</p>

  <p>Feeling the strength of the energy's aura, Jimena Ji began to panic, pushing on the walls of the container as hard as she could. This could not be the end of her. She had to find a way to survive. Her mind was already going haywire.</p>

  <p>"We can talk about this!</p>

  <p>The Ji Clan will agree to our marriage! I'll be yours!</p>

  <p>You can be my master!" she screamed, tears streaming down her cheeks.</p>

  <p>The Evil God began to raise his arms.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>They all heard two muffled sounds coming from inside the conical containers.</p>

  <p>The entire scene was terrifying. The energy the Evil God used was enough to destroy more than half of the province, and he locked it all up in the conical containers, where none of the energy was able to leak out.</p>

  <p>Both the old man and Jimena Ji had completely disappeared.</p>

  <p>Octavio, who stood guard before Moon Shield City, was left paralyzed by what he saw. He did not know how to react.</p>

  <p>The old man and Jimena Ji were among the top five warriors from the Bearing race. They had fought and survived numerous battles. Had they just died like this? Was this the end of them? Octavio could not bear to think about it.</p>

  <p>As his mind began to weaken so did his body. He began to tremble, both out of fear and exhaustion. He lost all will to fight, fleeing from the scene and into the furthest end of Moon Shield City.</p>

  <p>The Evil God knew there was another warrior at the Holy Soul Realm on the run, but he had no interest in hunting him down. He already accomplished what he came here to do.</p>

  <p>Now that Jimena was done for, so was Usman's obsession for her, his heart finally silencing its call. "Show's over," he told his crew. They then left, heading north of the city.</p>
