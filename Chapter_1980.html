<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords had already conducted twelve negotiations prior to Luo Zheng's arrival.</p>

  <p>They had all come into conflicts with each other at some point in the past but all past grudges took a backseat in this time of crisis.</p>

  <p>At this time, even the Humanity Alliance's territories had become a casualty to the war. They had all come to a point where nothing was too big of a sacrifice for the sake of the universe's survival.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, all twelve negotiations proved unsuccessful in formulating a feasible plan for their victory.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's plan was far from perfect.</p>

  <p>However, they all supported him because he was a rallying point and had a special status.</p>

  <p>To pacify Supreme Lord of Oracle and the other members of the Humanity Alliance, Master Feng had no choice but to reveal Luo Zheng's real identity along with Mike's intention for the three greatest forces of the human race.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's return convinced them even more in the truth of Master Feng's words.</p>

  <p>He had only left for three years yet his cultivation had improved so much.</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng could carry the Heavenly Destiny successfully then his strength might surpass all of the Supreme Lords'.</p>

  <p>They now fully believed in the Godly Geniuses' power to turn the tables for them.</p>

  <p>Most importantly, even if they did not believe in Luo Luo Zheng and the Celestial Position race, the Sacred race remained as an unbeatable opponent against the three greatest forces of the human race.</p>

  <p>There was no other choice other than to put their hopes upon Luo Luo Zheng and believe in him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, of course, noticed the Supreme Lords' attitudes which was why he came up with a plan to gain their support.</p>

  <p>In a quiet corner of the Breaking Cloud Sacred Place</p>

  <p>Several dozen world lords were busy coming and going.</p>

  <p>After arriving, each one would take the time to open their space rings.</p>

  <p>From there, they brought out weapons and treasures and plopped them all down onto the ground.</p>

  <p>Most of the weapons were spiritual, fairy, and sacred weapons.</p>

  <p>Such practice had lasted for several years.</p>

  <p>In fact, it had been implemented ever since Luo Zheng's first visit to the Celestial Position race territory.</p>

  <p>Most of the weapons were still intact and undamaged and an ordinary warrior would no doubt find just one already extremely valuable and precious.</p>

  <p>These weapons had been collected from all corners of the universe.</p>

  <p>After years upon years of accumulation, this pile of weapons and treasures had reached several hundred thousand feet high.</p>

  <p>In the bright sunlight, the mountain of treasure glittered and shone in a multitude of colors.</p>

  <p>"What do you think they're planning to do with all these weapons?"</p>

  <p>"Who knows? At least they're not for eating, right?"</p>

  <p>"It has been several years since the first weapon was dropped here. Even though they're just a load of abandoned crap, they should be valuable enough in such a great number!"</p>

  <p>These were just some of the remarks that the warriors of the Breaking Cloud Sacred Place made when passing by this pile of weapons.</p>

  <p>Not everyone was qualified enough to know the plans of the higher-ups.</p>

  <p>However, the Celestial Position race had already spent a lot of time and effort in obtaining such a large collection of weapons so they must be planning for something significant.</p>

  <p>At that moment, multiple beams of light appeared across the sky.</p>

  <p>Each beam of light was a warrior that emanated an extremely powerful Mu Ning. Some people on the ground couldn't help but stop in their tracks and stare.</p>

  <p>These warriors were the human Supreme Lords gathering in the Breaking Cloud Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>These Supreme Lords were bold and generous. Since they decided to follow through with Luo Zheng's suggestions then there was no time to waste.</p>

  <p>Under current circumstances, they needed to carry out their plan as soon as possible while staying at the ready for any sort of unforeseeable changes.</p>

  <p>Their top priority was to help the nine Genuine Dragons in restoring their strength and assist Luo Luo Zheng in his destiny.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords stopped and floated near the mountain of weapons.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, on the other hand, landed at the very summit, the weapons clanging loudly beneath his feet.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, you can start now," Master Feng said above him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded. His eyes flashed with determination as a brilliant beam of light suddenly glittered between his brows.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>There was a multitude of sharp whistling sounds as the souls of the nine Genuine Dragons flew out from between his brows one by one.</p>

  <p>The nine Genuine Dragons hovered over the mountain of weapons.</p>

  <p>Their leader, the Five-clawed Golden Dragon nodded at Master Feng.</p>

  <p>"Thank you for helping us build our Heavenly Bodies."</p>

  <p>"You and I serve the same master. We are now both in the same boat.</p>

  <p>There is no need to thank me for such trivial things," Master Feng replied graciously.</p>

  <p>The Five-clawed Golden Dragon nodded and turned his huge head towards Luo Luo Zheng. Everything was all set, however, it all depended upon Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Another beam of light flashed between Luo Zheng's brows and a black flame appeared in the air.</p>

  <p>With a happy chirp, this black flame circled the air once like a bird before swiftly plunging into the mountain of weapons.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stood steadily on the mountaintop surrounded by the nine Genuine Dragons. Meanwhile, the Supreme Lords merely floated in the sky and observed.</p>

  <p>Silence filled the air as everyone watched the black flame disappear in the mountain.</p>

  <p>A few warriors also watched at the sides, curious as to what was about to happen.</p>

  <p>"Are they really going to eat all of the weapons?" one of them asked jokingly.</p>

  <p>"Cut the crap! These Supreme Lords all have great perception. Stop talking nonsense or you'll get punished," one of his friends admonished.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng tilted his head toward their direction. He was several hundred thousand feet away yet he could perfectly hear their conversation.</p>

  <p>It was not by perception but simply his good hearing.</p>

  <p>After being remodeled by Holy Drew, his body improved a lot. Some of his abilities even went beyond his own expectations.</p>

  <p>"One of them is looking over here!"</p>

  <p>"Who is this young man? Is he also a Supreme Lord?"</p>

  <p>The two warriors murmured in astonishment by Luo Zheng's gaze.</p>

  <p>To their pleasant surprise, Luo Luo Zheng only gave them a gentle smile.</p>

  <p>These two were only at the Life and Death Realm. They could barely see the smile on Luo Zheng's face but his air of friendliness calmed them down.</p>

  <p>Two hours later.</p>

  <p>The mountain of weapons lay motionless for a bit.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng resembled a statue as he also stood still on top.</p>

  <p>He was sensing the motions of the black flame.</p>

  <p>It was currently burning through all the weapons inside.</p>

  <p>The flame was incredibly hot and burned through the stack of treasures effortlessly.</p>

  <p>It was slow at first, merely melting a portion of the weapons at the bottom of the mountain. However, as time went by, it spread and burned through everything more quickly.</p>

  <p>The weapons melted and turned into ashes at an increasing rate. After incineration, only the heavenly essence remained.</p>

  <p>This went on for four more hours.</p>

  <p>With a shattering sound, the entire mountain suddenly started to collapse into the center.</p>

  <p>The black flame had burned through the bottom of the mountain and the weapons that had been haphazardly piled together all lost their balance, beginning to collapse one by one.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>With the mountain's collapse, the black flame finally made its appearance.</p>

  <p>It was now a huge fire as compared to the initial small spark it once was.</p>

  <p>The flame didn't show any sign of stopping anytime soon as it continued blazing higher and higher.</p>

  <p>As it grew, it also got even fiercer and faster at consuming the treasures.</p>

  <p>The clanging sound of falling weapons reverberated in the entire place.</p>

  <p>Everyone watched in awe as the black flames danced upon the once glorious mountain of treasure like vicious, ebony serpents.</p>

  <p>Even the Supreme Lords couldn't help but gasp as they watched these divine flames burn.</p>

  <p>One careless brush against these flames would burn their bodies to ashes.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng remained motionless on top of the mountain. His body remained whole and unyielding despite the ferocity of the flames.</p>

  <p>The fire went from the bottom to the very top and turned all weapons into heavenly essence that flowed into the ditches built underneath the treasure mountain.</p>

  <p>In wasn't until another half-hour that the mountain finally disappeared.</p>

  <p>With no more fuel, the fire then began to fizzle out, slowly reducing in size before spiraling happily in the air and returning into the center of Luo Zheng's brows.</p>

  <p>With the consumption of the weapons came the appearance of the nine huge ditches underneath.</p>

  <p>These ditches were dug way before the first weapon had been dropped in this place. The most skillful craftsmen of the Celestial Position race worked very hard for several months to create them.</p>

  <p>All that hard work translated to all nine ditches filled to the brim with heavenly essence. With an unhindered view of the ditches, Luo Luo Zheng saw how each one was intricately shaped like a dragon. The nine formed a sort of painting of the Genuine Dragons.</p>
