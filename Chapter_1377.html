<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1377 Gap </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Except for Layla, the rest of the warriors from the first tier were injured in varying degrees.</p>

  <p>All the warriors were equipped with many healing panaceas, but the problem was that the Law Storm was everywhere in the Enchanted Barrier Tower. There was no place for them to hide and heal their wounds.</p>

  <p>Therefore, at this moment, everyone had to endure the pain and keep moving forward. It was a true test of their endurance.</p>

  <p>After Javier covered the distance of ten thousand miles, the other warriors on the first tier also sprinted to cover the same distance!</p>

  <p>Only two or three warriors had managed to travel ten thousand miles during the Passing the Torch in the past. Sometimes, only one warrior managed to do this. But this time, the number had increased significantly.</p>

  <p>By the time Luo Luo Zheng reached the ten-thousand-mile mark, he was already ranked thirteenth.</p>

  <p>Other than occasionally dodging a powerful Law Power in the storm, he had been able to move forward at a constant speed!</p>

  <p>But he wasn't faster than some of the other warriors who had used special methods to increase their speed. They used these methods as a boost in the last stretch of the test and sprinted as fast as they could.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng was much calmer than the other warriors and he wasn't injured...</p>

  <p>As of now, Layla and Luo Luo Zheng were probably the only ones who were completely unharmed in the Enchanted Barrier Tower.</p>

  <p>"There is something very strange here! This guy called Luo Luo Zheng seems to have maintained the same speed from start to end!"</p>

  <p>"Well, his speed is neither fast nor slow? he maintains a steady pace. In a Law Storm of this level, it's hard to believe that he is completely unharmed!"</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Yolande's eyes flashed faintly. It was only now that these warriors were noticing Luo Zheng's amazing performance...</p>

  <p>He had now become the center of attention.</p>

  <p>Although he still hadn't made it into the top ten, his calm demeanor made him appear enigmatic.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had maintained his ranking in the top thirteen for five minutes, while two super talents in front of him had been injured in succession and were eliminated from the Enchanted Barrier Tower.</p>

  <p>With their elimination Luo Luo Zheng moved up to the eleventh position!</p>

  <p>The warrior ranked tenth wasn't too far from Luo Luo Zheng. It seemed as if he had also been ravaged by the Law Storm, and was finding it extremely difficult to even take a single step further. It was easy for Luo Luo Zheng to surpass this injured warrior and enter the top ten now.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was closing in on his opponent, but just as he was about to surpass him, the warrior turned around and glared at him. Then he bit his tongue and burnt his blood essence, causing the Mu Ning from the savage land to erupt from his body.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>The warrior's speed suddenly increased three times, and he zoomed ahead, leaving Luo Luo Zheng far behind!</p>

  <p>Clearly, he didn't want Luo Luo Zheng to beat him!</p>

  <p>Looking at the warrior who was moving further and further away, Luo Luo Zheng shook his head and smiled. 'Did he do that just to retain his place in the top ten?' he thought curiously.</p>

  <p>This warrior might have inherited some sort of ancient bloodline. Blood essence was very precious. But he had burnt his own blood essence just to stay in the top ten. This was a bit of a waste...</p>

  <p>Moreover, at this stage, speed was no longer important. In fact, after they traveled ten thousand miles, it was more a competition of endurance.</p>

  <p>The warrior fled rapidly into the endless Law Storm. His figure quickly became blurry and he gradually disappeared from Luo Zheng's line of sight.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng maintained his pace, continuing to fly at a moderate speed!</p>

  <p>Another five minutes passed...</p>

  <p>As he advanced steadily, a gigantic black hole appeared not far away. It completely engulfed the warrior who ranked tenth.</p>

  <p>The Law Power at this stage was already terrifying. In addition to that, some very rare laws were also present in the Law Storm. Although these laws were derived from the Original Law, they had formed another law system.</p>

  <p>This huge black hole was the legendary Dark Law. It was said that once one cultivated this Dark Law to its full limit, it would be able to devour everything, including the entire universe!</p>

  <p>Although the black hole in front of Luo Luo Zheng couldn't achieve this, it was difficult for the warrior, who was devoured into it, to get out and fight it on his own.</p>

  <p>As he passed the black hole, Luo Luo Zheng also felt its strong magnetic pull. At the same time, he also saw that the warrior within the black hole was trying to call out to him.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng could not hear any sound. The black hole could absorb everything, including sound and light. The warrior's cries for help could not escape the black hole either.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng tried to read the warrior's lips and understood that the warrior wanted him to help!</p>

  <p>He shook his head indifferently.</p>

  <p>It wasn't that he planned to just stand by and watch the warrior get eliminated. In fact, it might not be a big deal for Luo Luo Zheng to help the warrior escape the black hole.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng himself wasn't familiar with the Dark Law. It would be too bad, if he, too, were to get trapped in it. He also believed that the palace leaders would help to extract the warrior from the black hole. At this point though, the chances of the warrior getting eliminated were high, or perhaps it could be said that he had already been eliminated.</p>

  <p>Now that he had surpassed and replaced his competing warrior, Luo Luo Zheng was finally in the tenth place.</p>

  <p>However, just as Luo Luo Zheng entered the top ten, a figure flew overhead at a high speed. He didn't see it clearly in this boundless Law Storm. He could only make out that the faint shadow might belong to a big bird.</p>

  <p>When the "big bird" approached, Luo Luo Zheng realized that it was Layla. But she had a pair of wings on her back!</p>

  <p>When Layla came closer him, he asked with a strange expression, "Why are you flying back?"</p>

  <p>She looked at him blandly and replied, "I thought you have already been eliminated!"</p>

  <p>"I won't be eliminated so easily," Luo Luo Zheng said, shaking his head confidently.</p>

  <p>"You are just too slow!" she mocked him again.</p>

  <p>"We are not competing for speed!" Luo Luo Zheng was not going to increase his speed in order to chase after someone, nor was he going to slow down for anybody.</p>

  <p>"It is great that you are not eliminated. I'll wait for you in the front!"</p>

  <p>Layla spread her wings and flew away. However, suddenly a "snowstorm" appeared. Gigantic fireballs formed by the Fire Laws and ice spears, which were over one hundred feet long, started falling on them!</p>

  <p>Layla whizzed off, and she passed through the snowstorm in a flash.</p>

  <p>Occasionally, there would be some fireballs blocking her way, but she wrapped her wings around her body and zoomed directly through them.</p>

  <p>"She came back just to say something to Luo Luo Zheng..."</p>

  <p>"Layla is really very self-confident!"</p>

  <p>"She can travel twelve thousand miles with such ease. This woman...</p>

  <p>This woman might have the qualifications to challenge the record set by Supreme Lord Illusion!"</p>

  <p>Not many warriors remained in the Enchanted Barrier Tower, and the few who were there garnered attention by the others. Layla, who was previously ranked first, naturally received the most attention.</p>

  <p>She only wanted to talk to Luo Luo Zheng when she had returned resolutely, which stunned the palace masters.</p>

  <p>Other warriors found it difficult to take a single step forward, but Layla seemed to advance in such a fierce Law Storm pretty easily. Everyone marveled at her remarkable ability!</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Luo Zheng continued improving his ranking.</p>

  <p>Ninth place, eighth place, seventh place...</p>

  <p>With his steady progress, he quickly entered the top five and then the top four...</p>

  <p>By the time they reached the 13, 000th mile, he was already in the top three.</p>

  <p>This was because seven of the top ten warriors had already been eliminated!</p>

  <p>The strangest thing was that the top three warriors were from the Mist Palace.</p>

  <p>Layla was still in first place, Javier was second and Luo Luo Zheng was third!</p>

  <p>The palace leaders and vice leaders from the other twelve palaces looked very embarrassed at this point.</p>

  <p>In the past, their warriors had excelled in this competition. However, this year, it seemed that every palace had some remarkable talents, and all of them had attained the ten-thousand-mile mark. All the warriors, who were still moving forward after traveling ten thousand miles, belonged to the Mist Palace. It was obvious that the gap between the warriors of the Mist Palace and those from other palaces was very large.</p>
