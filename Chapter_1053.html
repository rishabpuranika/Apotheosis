<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1053 Master Abraham </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Among the six warriors, two of them were at the Soul Sea Realm, while the other four were at the level of Life and Death Realm.</p>

  <p>It seemed that the warriors from the Central Region had guessed it right? the four divine kingdoms truly didn't take the Central Region seriously.</p>

  <p>In their eyes, the location of the divine kingdoms was the center of this world. They believed that there was practically nothing across the vast ocean.</p>

  <p>A lot of warriors originated from the four divine kingdoms had been to Sky Northern Region for exploration during the remote ages until the middle ages. That sort of place, however, was simply impossible to find under any opportunities. Thus, there were very few warriors from the divine kingdoms willing to go to the Sky Northern Region, let alone pay a high cost to attack the said region.</p>

  <p>Thus, since the ancient times, the warriors that came to the Sky Northern Region were all those that offended the divine kingdoms and had chosen to flee. Since they had nowhere else to go, hiding in the Sky Northern Region was their best alternative.</p>

  <p>Only this time, it was different.</p>

  <p>The Holy Maiden of the York Divine Kingdom ordered Master Wallace to annihilate the Cloud Hall, a small fourth-grade sect.</p>

  <p>Initially, Master Wallace could not understand why the Holy Maiden was hostile towards a small sect in the Sky Northern Region that was tens of thousands of miles away.</p>

  <p>But later on, he soon realized that the young man named Luo Luo Zheng had offended her.</p>

  <p>For this rationale alone, Master Wallace would not personally step into the Sky Northern Region. Being a mighty warrior at the Soul Sea Realm, he didn't need to listen to the Holy Maiden.</p>

  <p>But this time he came to the Sky Northern Region. And this was naturally because of the secret in Luo Zheng's mind!</p>

  <p>He happened to take a glimpse of what was in Luo Zheng's mind at that incident where a strand of his soul was devoured. That was a huge temptation!</p>

  <p>Every time he thought of this, he could not suppress the excitement in his heart. He knew he had a better perspective. If he decided to keep this secret on his own, his future would be bright. Even the York Divine Kingdom would be trampled under his feet one day. And he was looking forward to it!</p>

  <p>The four divine kingdoms were undeniably too far away from the Sky Northern Region. Moreover, Master Wallace and his group had to avoid some dangerous areas along the way, so they tried their best not to provoke those powerful vicious beasts in the ocean.</p>

  <p>Several days later, the six warriors of the York Divine Kingdom finally appeared on the east side of the Sky Northern Region.</p>

  <p>"Wallace, there seems to be a small sect there. Let's have a look." The other warrior at the Soul Sea Realm, who came with Master Wallace, was Master Abraham. They were close friends. And it was only because of Master Wallace's invitation that he came here with him.</p>

  <p>These warriors of the York Divine Kingdom all perceived that the trip to the Sky Northern Region was not dangerous at all. They realized that this was a place where even warriors at the Life and Death Realm could rule over the entire area. To them, they could do whatever they wanted in the Sky Northern Region. They even agreed that in comparison, the Chaotic Ocean of Stars was much more dangerous than the Sky Northern Region.</p>

  <p>In the far east of the Sky Northern Region, there was a third-grade sect widely known as the Fish Dragon Sect. And it didn't escape under the watchful eye of Master Abraham. Thus, he casually mentioned this small sect.</p>

  <p>Master Wallace let out a cold laugh and suddenly rushed into the Fish Dragon Sect as if curiosity had gotten into him. He haughtily landed on a space in the great hall of the Fish Dragon Sect. His face was devoid of respect as his eyes swiftly scanned the area.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Master Wallace looked like a child. But in reality, he was already an old man who had lived for more than a thousand years. And he could also be described as an Ancient Tycoon. With his feet being the center, the hard ground started to grumble and split open. Large cracks covered the whole floor of the hall. Soon after, spider-like cracks adorned the wall, even reaching up to the roof.</p>

  <p>"Who is it? Who dares to trespass into the Fish Dragon Sect!" exclaimed the leader of the Fish Dragon Sect furiously.</p>

  <p>When Master Xiao rushed out of the great hall, his furious expression immediately vanished like smoke into thin air. He let out a flattering smile.</p>

  <p>But he was silently cursing in his mind.</p>

  <p>'Damn! Why do warriors at the Soul Sea Realm appear again?</p>

  <p>Since when are there so many mighty warriors at the Soul Sea Realm in the Central Region?'</p>

  <p>Even though he was seething in anger, he exuded a warm demeanor. After encountering over a hundred mighty warriors last time, he discovered that his mind had become stronger. So meeting these six warriors, he did not lose his composure.</p>

  <p>"Master, may I know what you want from us?" Master Xiao asked Master Wallace with a fake smile on his face.</p>

  <p>Master Wallace glanced at him and asked coldly, "How do I get to Oracle City?"</p>

  <p>'Oracle City again!</p>

  <p>Are these people also looking for Luo Luo Zheng?</p>

  <p>A while ago, the divine kingdom has already sent over a hundred warriors over. How come it still isn't enough?' Master Xiao wondered.</p>

  <p>But then again, after the hundred or so warriors had headed to Oracle City about a month ago, there was no latest news about Luo Luo Zheng. Master Xiao was dying to know what had happened, but he didn't dare to ask the warriors before him.</p>

  <p>He knew clearly that curiosity might kill the cat. If he were to speak too much, he might bring about a calamity that could kill himself and even destroy the entire clan.</p>

  <p>He quickly took out a map. And as he respectfully handed it to the boy at the Soul Sea Realm, he grinned and explained, "This is the map of the entire Central Region. The Oracle City has already been marked out on the map. You can follow the map and find it."</p>

  <p>Master Wallace nonchalantly took the map and shook it a bit before memorizing it. He snorted and turned into a streak of light, flying straight in the direction of Oracle City, followed by his companions.</p>

  <p>Unlike Miguel, Master Wallace didn't leave any rewards behind. He didn't even spare Master Xiao a glance before vanishing.</p>

  <p>Master Xiao spat at them soon after the six warriors left. Previously, those hundred warriors had bestowed him with a low-grade sacred weapon. These two warriors at the Soul Sea Realm were so stingy!</p>

  <p>In less than a day, the six warriors had quickly approached Oracle City.</p>

  <p>Now standing at the entrance of the city, Master Wallace surveyed around the place. At that time when he was in the Eight-diagram Mirror, he vividly remembered the surrounding environment of Oracle City. Although the World Commercial Alliance had cleaned up the battlefield recently, the city didn't change that much. He was more than sure this was Oracle City.</p>

  <p>"I just don't know if that young man is still in Oracle City," Master Wallace said indifferently.</p>

  <p>Master Abraham then probed, "What kind of secret does that guy hold that makes you so concerned about him?"</p>

  <p>Surprised, Master Wallace just chuckled. "How could he have any secrets?</p>

  <p>I'm just doing things for the Holy Maiden."</p>

  <p>Master Abraham declared coldly, "Those words of yours are good enough to fool the Holy Maiden, but don't you try to use them to fool me. You and I have been good friends for so many years. And yet, here you are, trying to hide it from me!"</p>

  <p>Noticing that Master Abraham was slightly displeased, Master Wallace finally opened his mouth and confided, "Alright. Since I'm willing to invite you to the Central Region, I naturally want to share that secret with you.</p>

  <p>That secret has something to do with the Dragon Lineage Human!"</p>

  <p>"Dragon Lineage Human!"</p>

  <p>Hearing his words, Master Abraham was stunned, but he soon changed his expression into one of disbelief. "Wallace, stop joking with me."</p>

  <p>The untold tales of the Dragon Lineage Human were the greatest secret of the four divine kingdoms.</p>

  <p>The history of the four divine kingdoms was much longer than that of the Central Region. On that continent, all sorts of civilizations had existed for countless years.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the history of the divine kingdoms perfectly depicted its remote ages, middle times, and modern times.</p>

  <p>The Dragon Lineage Human had been enemies with the divine kingdoms since the remote ages. Then during the middle times, they suddenly waged an earth-shaking war with the seven divine kingdoms. It was said that a Genuine Dragon even appeared to help them out. And this was when three divine kingdoms were annihilated.</p>

  <p>The remaining four divine kingdoms only gained the upper hand during modern times. And that was also the time when they completely exterminated the Dragon Lineage Human, turning it into a piece of history and legend within the divine kingdoms.</p>

  <p>Even if it was just a legend, the Dragon Lineage Human still had many inheritances and ruins, and these things were like gold mines that attracted warriors of the divine kingdoms to excavate them.</p>

  <p>Thus any secret related to the Dragon Lineage Human was incomparably precious in the divine kingdoms. Through the years, their warriors had dug up far too many benefits from the Dragon Lineage Human.</p>

  <p>"Why would I joke around with you? Wait till I catch this brat and search his soul, then you'll know!" Master Wallace's face revealed a smile brimming with confidence.</p>

  <p>Seeing how confident Master Wallace was, Master Abraham also believed in him by twenty to thirty percent. Anyway, there were a lot of warriors of divine kingdoms that had offended other strong warriors. And they resorted to hiding in the Sky Northern Region. But here, those warriors would eventually die. Maybe this secret was brought over by those warriors and captured by the warriors in the Central Region.</p>

  <p>"Since that guy has the secret of the Dragon Lineage Human, his strength should not be weak. I wonder if he has any helpers?"</p>

  <p>On the other hand, a hint of caution appeared on Master Abraham's face.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha!" Hearing the words coming from Master Abraham, Master Wallace burst out laughing. "That guy's strength is not bad. He is at the middle stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm, and yet he killed a warrior at the fourth grade of the Life and Death Realm."</p>

  <p>"Really?" The eyes of Master Abraham flickered. Regardless of whether it was the Virtual Tribulation Realm or the Life and Death Realm, he didn't give a damn. However, according to Master Wallace, the guy himself was at the middle stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm, yet he was able to kill a warrior at the fourth grade of the Life and Death Realm.</p>

  <p>This was very impressive.</p>
