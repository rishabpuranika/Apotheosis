<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1197 Giant Shields </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Divine Emperor Island was a huge cemetery, and the road was lined with many tombstones on both sides.</p>

  <p>The sacred place of the Dragon Lineage Human was an eighth grade power and the warriors who were buried in the cemetery were big shots.</p>

  <p>The ones who were buried on the platforms were core members of the Dragon Lineage Human. The Dragon Lineage Human had a lot of warriors with other surnames apart from 'Feng'. The warriors with other surnames were inferior. Even those at the Soul Sea Realm didn't have the qualification to keep their corpses. These powerful warriors were buried in the cemetery after their deaths, and slowly faded into insignificance.</p>

  <p>The only difference was that their tombstones were in the shape of golden dragon heads, which could be recognized even from a distance.</p>

  <p>The powerful warriors of the Soul Sea Realm looked at the tombstones and felt sadness wash over them. If they couldn't open the passage to the Upper World, they would never be able to break through to a higher realm. And they would, without a doubt, die if and when they ran out of lifespan.</p>

  <p>Others would hold big funerals for them, and they would sleep in delicate coffins, slowly fading out of memory.</p>

  <p>The martial artists of this universe had used their entire lives to cross this limit and escape death.</p>

  <p>The group encountered a dark forest once they had left the cemetery behind. At the edge of the forest was the tail of the Divine Emperor Island, and at the end of the island was a funnel-shaped area that lined a long, narrow sea.</p>

  <p>A twenty-foot wide road extended through the sea, cutting it into two. It looked like a brown ribbon lying on the surface of the sea and it formed a wondrous sight.</p>

  <p>Under the supervision of the white-browed Taoist priest by the West Dragon River, a ceremony had been held to dispel much of the power of the blood sacrifice in the Feather Holy Sea. However, the power of blood sacrifice around the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land did not weaken one bit. The golden sea water, like pure molten gold, beat continuously along this narrow road.</p>

  <p>The power of blood sacrifice in this area was so strong that even the mighty martial artists of the Soul Sea Realm couldn't break through. But the power of blood sacrifice didn't work on the Dragon Lineage Human.</p>

  <p>This was also why these powerful martial artists of the Soul Sea Realm wanted to occupy the corpses. Only then could they safely enter the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land.</p>

  <p>The towering figure of War King Wind stopped in front of the long, narrow road. He turned to everyone and said, "This is the Road of Saints of the Dragon Lineage Human. The entrance to the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land is at the end of this road. But it is not easy to pass the road, so we must be very careful."</p>

  <p>Hearing his father's warning, Callan asked, "Father, what danger is there on this road?"</p>

  <p>War King Wind smiled and replied, "You guys have encountered the Slow Arrow Area in the Feather Emperor Secret Land before, right?"</p>

  <p>The juniors nodded. Even now, the memory of the arrows that had flown at them triggered fear in their hearts. If it hadn't been for Luo Luo Zheng pushing the magnetic stone forward, it was likely that all of the younger generation martial artists would have been trapped in the Slow Arrow Area.</p>

  <p>War King Wind continued, "The Slow Arrow Area is located in the Feather Emperor Secret Land. In a sense, this Road of Saints is known as the Fast Arrow Area."</p>

  <p>"Fast arrows?" Luo Luo Zheng raised an eyebrow. "This road is so narrow. How can we avoid the arrows that come at us swiftly?"</p>

  <p>War King Wind smiled and said, "Although the four divine kingdoms cannot explore the entire Heavenly Stellar Secret Land, we have thought of countless ways to get here. More than a dozen Soul Sea Realm martial artists died in the quest to pass through this Road of Saints. These are all lessons paid for with blood."</p>

  <p>His gaze landed on Turner. Turner gazed back before saying, "Show us what you have."</p>

  <p>The four Soul Sea Realm martial artists from the Harlen Divine Kingdom took out giant shields that were twenty feet long.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's gaze scanned them as they stabbed the shields into the ground one by one. There were more than ten shields present.</p>

  <p>A rainbow-colored luster emanated from the surface of these shields, and Luo Luo Zheng could feel the power of the five elements from them.</p>

  <p>"The magnetic stone!" Luo Zheng's gaze flickered as he asked, "We can't process the magnetic stone, can we?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had noticed the hardness of the magnetic stone before, and the power of the five elements within it was extremely chaotic. Because of this, no absolute power could restrain it. Moreover, it was so hard that even if a divine weapon came in contact with it, it could destroy the divine weapon.</p>

  <p>This meant that even the mighty martial artists of the Soul Sea Realm couldn't do anything to the Magnetic Sacred Mountain.</p>

  <p>At Luo Zheng's apprehensive and slightly stunned gaze, Turner smiled proudly and said, "It is true that the magnetic stone cannot be processed. It caused the world to tremble when the Magnetic Sacred Mountain fell, crashing from the sky. A few small fragments scattered across the Magnetic Sacred Mountain, and most of these fragments have been collected by our kingdom."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's brow cleared in sudden enlightenment at Turner's explanation. He looked again at the huge shields and found that they were indeed embedded with small magnetic stones. As for what the Harlen Divine Kingdom had used to assemble the magnetic stones, Luo Luo Zheng had no idea.</p>

  <p>It was true that the four divine kingdoms had thought of all sorts of ways to enter the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land.</p>

  <p>"Alright, it's getting late. Shields up. Let's go! Fiona, Callan, you youngsters have to follow us closely. The difficulty of going past the Fast Arrow Area is far greater than that of going past the Slow Arrow Area,"</p>

  <p>War King Wind warned.</p>

  <p>The juniors' hearts skipped a beat at these words as they nervously followed behind.</p>

  <p>A powerful martial artist of the Soul Sea Realm was carrying a huge shield as he walked ahead. He held his shield horizontally as he faced the Road of Saints.</p>

  <p>Four powerful martial artists of the Soul Sea Realm were blocking the flanks with huge shields held on their shoulders. Two more were holding their shields up, facing the sky, while the last one covered the rear.</p>

  <p>These shields were huge and quite heavy. But since they had occupied the corpses of powerful martial artists of the Soul Sea Realm, it was easy for them to lift the shields up.</p>

  <p>The craftsmen of the Harlen Kingdom had crafted exquisite buckles at the edges of the huge shields. The powerful martial artists of the Soul Sea Realm only had to lightly touch the edges of the shields for the buckles to merge together. The huge shields thus formed an airtight box that covered over a hundred people.</p>

  <p>War King Wind shouted, "Let's go!"</p>

  <p>Everyone took a synchronized step forward. The eight powerful martial artists of the Soul Sea Realm also carried their huge shields and maintained the same pace as everyone else. The long, narrow box slowly moved on the Road of Saints.</p>

  <p>They were only thrice as fast as an old man walking. When they had walked for more than a hundred feet, the sound of countless waves crashing against each other suddenly reached their ears, emanating from the surrounding golden sea.</p>

  <p>A number of dragon statues emerged from the middle of the sea. These statues had blue arrows in their mouths.</p>

  <p>War King Wind didn't flinch as he said, "It's coming. Stay alert! Grasp your shields firmly!"</p>

  <p>The eight powerful martial artists of the Soul Sea Realm became serious, and they gripped the huge shields tighter.</p>

  <p>They had barely taken another step on the Road of Saints when they heard a cracking sound.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>An azure light streaked across the sea's surface, leaving a blue ripple in the air as it shot towards the box.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng blinked at the speed with which the arrow's light was approaching them. The Fast Arrow Area was probably more troublesome than the Slow Arrow Area by a large margin. If the powerful martial artists of the Soul Sea Realm were to be hit by the arrow, a huge hole would be left on their bodies. The blue arrows were most likely coated with Dragon Arsenic as well.</p>

  <p>Now that Luo Luo Zheng had possessed Brianna's body, he wouldn't be able to escape if he was hit by the arrow. His own body was as strong as a sacred weapon, but Brianna's body wasn't.</p>

  <p>The arrow that had originally been a thousand feet away reached them in the blink of an eye and crashed into a giant shield on the left.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Even a single arrow of such power carried an irresistible force under such a high-speed collision. The box formed from the giant shields tilted to the right, only just escaping from slipping into the sea.</p>

  <p>"Steady with the shields!" With a loud shout, War King Wind extended his huge hand and slapped the giant shield to his left, bringing the box back to the Road of Saints.</p>
