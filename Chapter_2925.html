<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2925 The End Of The Passageway </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Zheng had no idea how deep this passageway was, but he reckoned that he might have already reached the core area of the maze.</p>

  <p>The spirals were surging toward him one after another from the path ahead.</p>

  <p>Even if he managed to dodge the spiral right in front of him, he would fail to avoid the next one.</p>

  <p>In such a situation, the Time Jade Seal proved to be essential. Without it, Zheng might have died many times.</p>

  <p>Or, in other words, in the countless periods of time that he had erased with the Time Jade Seal, he had already been killed.</p>

  <p>Now, he could only use the power of the Time Jade Seal once more in the near future, so he couldn't waste it casually.</p>

  <p>As the next spiral surged toward him, Zheng suddenly turned to his right and entered the space-time on the wall of the passageway.</p>

  <p>The moment he stepped into the space, he felt like he had entered a different world altogether. This experience was nothing like how he had felt after entering the world inside the Time Jade Seal. A strong gust of wind blew on his face, carrying many grains of sand with it.</p>

  <p>These grains of sand were actually colorful particles, each of which contained astonishing cutting power. When they hit Zheng, his face contorted in pain.</p>

  <p>He immediately brought his hands up to his face to protect himself. Then, he looked closely and discovered that he was in some sort of small desert formed by countless colorful grains of sand.</p>

  <p>"The sand..."</p>

  <p>He slowly crouched down and reached out to touch the sand. He immediately felt a sharp pain in his fingertips, like they had been pricked.</p>

  <p>If he had not had a strong and sturdy body, he might have been hurt by these strange grains of sand.</p>

  <p>'What is this weird place?' Zheng wondered.</p>

  <p>Just then, he heard a loud cry from the middle of the desert. The sound seemed to be coming from a baby.</p>

  <p>As soon as Zheng heard it, he associated it with the laughter and the breathing he had heard in the passageway. If there was really a baby in the desert, it was probably the same one that had been in the maze too.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Zheng leaped up and saw an astonishing scene in front of him.</p>

  <p>In the middle of the desert was a low basin surrounded by a circular sand dune. There was a golden cross hovering in the air, beneath which a faint shadow of a baby could be seen.</p>

  <p>The shadow of the baby emitted a powerful aura as it tried hard to fully materialize itself.</p>

  <p>However, the sand rose up into colorful tornados and promptly swept away the shadow.</p>

  <p>This chain of events kept repeating as if on loop. Every time the baby's body was about to materialize, the colorful tornados would roll towards it, immediately tearing its shadow into pieces.</p>

  <p>"Waah!" came the baby's cry every time it disappeared.</p>

  <p>However, it kept stubbornly putting itself together again while sobbing.</p>

  <p>The speed at which it was materializing was getting faster and faster, while the speed of the colorful tornados was getting slower and slower.</p>

  <p>"If it goes on like this, the baby will be able to completely materialize sooner or later," Zheng commented as he watched the scene from midair.</p>

  <p>Just as he had predicted, it wasn't long before the baby's shadow began to take on a solid shape. He could almost see its smooth skin. The golden cross floating above the baby's head slowly descended, almost touching its forehead.</p>

  <p>But at this moment, a large crack suddenly appeared in the dark sky right above the basin. And from that crack, water from the Time Sea poured down like a heavy rain.</p>

  <p>Most of the water hit the baby's body and completely destroyed it, while the extra water permeated into the desert sand.</p>

  <p>Although the baby's shadow was destroyed, the cross above it did not disappear; instead, it remained floating in the center of the basin.</p>

  <p>Zheng was planning to observe the scene for a while longer, but the colorful tornados around the basin seemed to have discovered him, and they flew toward him at an incredible speed.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng was not afraid of the sand that was transformed by time, getting caught in the tornados would be a disaster.</p>

  <p>Shocked, he quickly descended from the air without hesitation.</p>

  <p>He was only a few inches away from the wall from which he had entered this space. The moment he passed through it, he found himself back in the passageway.</p>

  <p>Zheng took a deep breath of relief.</p>

  <p>He gathered that the scene in the desert was a real story. But what did it all mean? Why was there a baby, and why had the water from the Time Sea rained down to destroy it?</p>

  <p>Shortly after Zheng returned to the passageway, he heard the strange giggle once again.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>From the depths of the passageway, another spiral suddenly flew straight toward him.</p>

  <p>Since he knew that he could freely enter the space-time walls on both sides of the passageway, Zheng didn't panic anymore.</p>

  <p>This time, he deliberately chose the wall on his left to see what was happening in this specific space.</p>

  <p>To his surprise, everything here was exactly the same as it had been in the space in the wall to his right. As soon as he entered, a gust of wind carrying colorful sand blew toward him. It was the same small desert, the same circular sand dune, the same golden cross above the basin, and the same shadow of a baby.</p>

  <p>The scene that Zheng had seen a few moments before played out in front of his eyes once again. The baby struggled and cried as it was swept away by the colorful tornados.</p>

  <p>"Could it be the same space and the same period of time?"</p>

  <p>Zheng wondered. But when he observed the movement of the struggling baby's shadow, he immediately rejected his own guess.</p>

  <p>Although it was the same shadow, the way the baby was struggling was completely different from before. This meant that this event must have happened more than once in the desert.</p>

  <p>After struggling for a while, the baby's shadow was about to materialize completely. Zheng subconsciously looked up at the dark sky above, knowing what was about to happen.</p>

  <p>Just as he had guessed, a huge crack appeared in the sky. Water from the Time Sea fell from the sky and poured down on the baby.</p>

  <p>Zheng shook his head and returned to the passageway.</p>

  <p>For the time being, he didn't know what this meant, but it didn't matter. The important thing was that he could use the space-times on both sides of the passageway to dodge the spirals, so he could still move forward following the instruction of the Infinity Ruler.</p>

  <p>"Heh heh…"</p>

  <p>As Zheng moved along the passageway, the baby's laughter continued to sound in his ears.</p>

  <p>When he encountered the spirals again, he unhurriedly entered the space-times on the walls. Once the spirals were gone, he once again returned to the passageway.</p>

  <p>As he continued to move forward, Zheng became more and more proficient in traveling between different spaces.</p>

  <p>Although the baby's eerie laughter became increasingly frequent and more and more spirals came from the end of the passageway, they didn't affect Zheng's speed.</p>

  <p>As for the scene playing out in the spaces on both sides of the passageway, Zheng couldn't be bothered to observe it again and again, because he had realized that it was almost the same every time.</p>

  <p>An hour later, Zheng suddenly heard a whistling sound coming from ahead.</p>

  <p>As soon as he heard the whistling sound, a single colorful grain of sand was blown out from the end of the passageway and brushed past Zheng's face. He immediately felt as if someone had cut his face with a sharp knife.</p>

  <p>Was this passageway leading to the desert? Such an idea suddenly popped into Zheng's mind.</p>
