</p>

  <p>Callan didn't understand why Luo Luo Zheng had asked such a question. In any case, he replied in a stiff voice, "I didn't dig it out myself. Fredric sold it to me. Is there something wrong?"</p>

  <p>As Fiona heard Fredric's name, she also frowned. Of the four crown princes of the four divine kingdoms, only Callan, who was her younger brother, was honest and simple-minded. She didn't like the other three, especially Fredric, who was the crown prince of the York Divine Kingdom. He was at the bottom of her list of likable men. He was extremely cunning and vicious. Although Fiona hadn't seen him many times, he had left a bad impression on her.</p>

  <p>Thus, Fiona immediately asked, "How many life vitality crystals did you spend buying it?"</p>

  <p>Callan replied, "Nine thousand."</p>

  <p>The mentioned life vitality crystals were naturally supreme life vitality crystals.</p>

  <p>Nine thousand supreme life vitality crystals was not a small number even for a crown prince. It might very well have been more than half of Callan's savings.</p>

  <p>Fiona took the Black Heart Fire Stone from Callan's hand and frowned.</p>

  <p>Something didn't seem right.</p>

  <p>Seeing his sister's expression, Callan opened his mouth and told her,</p>

  <p>"Fiona, they demonstrated to me that this ore can withstand fire. They said that after refining it, it would be able to greatly consolidate the purity of one's flames!"</p>

  <p>As Callan's voice fell, a wisp of flame rose from Fiona's hand. She was going to test the stone. Although the flame in her hand wasn't large, the temperature was extremely high and it was hot beyond imagination. The power of the third layer of Fire Law wasn't a joke.</p>

  <p>Under the heat of this pure flame, a crackling sound came from the Black Heart Fire Stone. Cracks immediately erupted from the exquisite clouds of fire on the stone as it began to melt under the immense heat and pressure.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the entire stone was incinerated into fragments.</p>

  <p>Callan's eyes became wide open as he blankly stared at these fragments.</p>

  <p>His face filled with disbelief. His strength might not have been as great as Fiona's, but he had also cultivated the third layer of the Fire Law.</p>

  <p>Before buying the stone, he had also used his own fire to try and burn it, and even after giving it a flame for several minutes, he was unable to burn it down. But how had Fiona turned the stone into fragments?</p>

  <p>At this time, Callan also understood that he had been deceived.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng and Camilla thought that Fredric must have used some tricks to fool Callan. Callan was a dull and honest person, and it wasn't going to be difficult to fool him.</p>

  <p>Fiona's gaze was calm, but her face looked extremely frosty. She had an amiable personality and never liked to argue with anyone, but she was simply not going to allow anyone to deceive her brother!</p>

  <p>At this moment, the ring of light on the side of the pyramid slightly flickered. Fredric, carrying a pickax, came out from the mine. Once he was outside, the rings of light flashed one after the other and some of his followers also came out.</p>

  <p>Although one leaf could only accommodate one warrior, Fredric's group had chosen to enter through his adjacent doors, which would allow them to fall on the neighboring leaves after entering the mine. Now, following Fredric, the divine-level talents from his divine kingdom had also come out.</p>

  <p>Fiona held the fragments of the Black Heart Fire Stone in her hand and looked at Fredric. Although she was angry, her voice was still clear and indifferent. In fact, her voice was its usual brand of calmness. However, her words revealed a majesty that could not be refused.</p>

  <p>"Fredric, return the nine thousand life vitality crystals to my brother.</p>

  <p>Take these fragments back and let bygones be bygones."</p>

  <p>Fredric was in a good mood right now as he had reaped a great harvest from the mine in the Feather Emperor Secret Land. Although Luo Luo Zheng had dug out most of the ores from the mine, the other princes, princesses, and divine-level talents had reaped less rewards than Fredric.</p>

  <p>Personally, Fredric was envious of Luo Luo Zheng as Camilla had helped him earn more than 100, 000 supreme life vitality crystals, but he still stayed calm.</p>

  <p>After all, Luo Luo Zheng was a dead man in his mind. He was sure that his father, War Emperor York would not let Luo Luo Zheng go.</p>

  <p>Fredric's eyes darkened at Fiona's words. Looking at the pile of debris in her hand, he knew that his trick had been exposed. However, he wasn't the least bit nervous. He was cunning and knew how to come out on top of such a situation. "What are they?"</p>

  <p>"The stone you sold to Callan was a fake. Please return his life vitality crystals to him." Seeing Fredric play dumb, Fiona got angry. Her eyebrows knitted themselves together even more fiercely. She was a kind and innocent girl, but she couldn't bear her brother being fooled by anyone.</p>

  <p>Hearing Fiona's words, Fredric chuckled. "Princess Fiona, what you've said is incorrect. When did I say that the stone was real?"</p>

  <p>"What? You..." Callan became anxious. Just as he was about to speak, Fredric interrupted him, "What did I say? Callan, did I tell you that the stone was real?</p>

  <p>In fact, I even reminded you that I was not sure of the value of the stone, didn't I?</p>

  <p>And I said I didn't want to sell it to you, right?</p>

  <p>It was you yourself who insisted on buying it, and even swore that regardless of whether it was real or fake, you would not pursue the matter, right?"</p>

  <p>Fredric was clever with his words. After what he just said, Callan didn't know how to retort at all. In the end, he could only suppress his anger and nod his head, his face as red as a tomato.</p>

  <p>What Fredric had said was true. In reality, he and his followers had set up a trap for Callan and deceived him effortlessly.</p>

  <p>"Princess Fiona, your brother has already admitted to it. Isn't this matter very clear? I already told him that I didn't want to sell it to him. Callan insisted on buying it. Now you're going to look for trouble with me. Isn't that very inappropriate?" Fredric asked.</p>

  <p>Faced with Fredric's questions, Fiona didn't know how to answer. She wasn't someone who was particularly good at arguing. The moment Fredric opened his mouth, all the reasoning had come to his side and it seemed like her brother was in the wrong.</p>

  <p>Seeing Fiona's expression, Fredric smiled smugly. He chuckled and told her, "As a matter of fact, although Callan forced me to sell this stone to him and it was even burnt to this state by you, it's not impossible for me to return the life vitality crystals to you. I have a deal."</p>

  <p>Fiona's face changed. "What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>Pointing at the jade bracelet on Fiona's arm, Fredric smiled and replied,</p>

  <p>"If you are willing to lend me the bracelet for a year or so, I will consider myself unlucky and return all the life vitality crystals. What do you think about that, Princess Fiona?"</p>

  <p>The value of the semi-divine weapon on Fiona's arm was incalculable!</p>

  <p>Ordinary princes or princesses who were not favored by their fathers did not have such a treasure. Even as the wealthiest crown prince of the York Divine Kingdom, Fredric only had two Heavenly Thunder Halberds that could be ranked at the level of semi-divine weapons. Such weapons were extremely rare.</p>

  <p>A bigger problem was that the Heavenly Thunder Halberds were only single-use treasures. In the Spirit Beast Area, Fredric had already used up one of those halberds in order to escape. Now, he was only left with the other.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha!" Hearing this, Luo Luo Zheng couldn't hold back his laughter.</p>

  <p>Looking at Luo Luo Zheng laughing so unrestrainedly in front of him, Fredric gnashed his teeth and shouted, "What the hell are you laughing at, Tianxing Luo?"</p>

  <p>"I'm laughing because you can act so shamelessly. I'm truly impressed by you, or rather, your stupidity and shamelessness!" Luo Luo Zheng replied with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>"How dare you! Tianxing Luo, you are courting death!"</p>

  <p>"How dare you insult the crown prince of our York Divine Kingdom!</p>

  <p>You're dead!"</p>

  <p>"You don't seem to have figured out your identity. You're just a nobody.</p>

  <p>You're nothing in front of the imperial family!"</p>

  <p>Before Fredric himself could say anything, the divine-level talents who followed him began clamoring.</p>

  <p>In the four divine kingdoms, the power of the warriors was something that every commoner aspired for but could never attain. As for the warriors themselves, the power of the imperial family members was something they could imagine of, think of, and try to achieve, but never succeed in reaching.</p>

  <p>This sort of narrow-minded thinking had been built up over thousands and thousands of years in the four divine kingdoms. Luo Luo Zheng, however, didn't give a damn about it.</p>

  <p>To put it bluntly, the establishment of a divine kingdom depended on one's own strength. If a divine kingdom's imperial family members lost their strength, then the divine kingdom would automatically be in extreme danger. And since there were no Soul Sea Realm masters among this lot, Luo Luo Zheng could beat every single one of these divine-level talents with his strength. As a result, he didn't show Fredric the slightest respect.</p>

  <p>So what if Fredric was the crown prince of the York Divine Kingdom?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng still had the Harlen Divine Kingdom backing him up. What was more, Luo Luo Zheng was helping Fiona and Callan. Behind them stood the Wind Divine Kingdom. In other words, it was two whole divine kingdoms along with Luo Luo Zheng against one.</p>

  <p>"You guys talk too much nonsense!" Luo Luo Zheng sneered. His eyes fell on Fredric. "I will only say this once. Return the life vitality crystals to Callan and this matter will be over. Do not embarrass yourself!"</p>

  <p>The moment he said this, Fredric's expression immediately turned extremely dark.</p>

  <p>Perhaps Fiona was very strong, but Fredric wasn't too afraid of her. In his mind, one of the siblings from the Huo Clan was stupid and the other was too naive. He could beat them both.</p>

  <p>But now, Luo Luo Zheng was standing up for them too.</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng was a bit more polite, Fredric might have given in, but his words were too unpleasant to listen to. If he gave in right now in front of Luo Luo Zheng, then everyone would believe that he was afraid of him.</p>
