<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The ogre war lord leapt up and ruthlessly stepped on the arena. His immense strength caused the arena to cave in slightly, but the arena quickly recovered and returned to its normal state.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, red lights flashed around Zheng and Xun's figure appeared beside him. Stretching out her hand, she said to him, "Give it to me."</p>

  <p>"Give you what now? What do you mean?" Ever since Xun recovered her consciousness, she had often jumped into situations on her own volition.</p>

  <p>"The spear!" Xun answered, though her tone was indifferent.</p>

  <p>"What for?" Zheng asked again.</p>

  <p>"Let me fight for you this time," said Xun quietly, a wry smile gracing her lips.</p>

  <p>Perhaps she came up with such a proposal because she had stayed inside Zheng's body for a long time.</p>

  <p>Zheng remembered the day Xun wielded a spear at the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place in such an impressive manner. It was a sight to behold, and truly, he wanted to see it again. With a smile on his face, he tapped his space ring with his finger, and a long spear flew towards Xun.</p>

  <p>Xun expertly caught the long spear with one hand, and her aura suddenly changed. A burst of strong malicious aura escaped from her eyes.</p>

  <p>"What? Why the sudden substitution?"</p>

  <p>"She's the Queen of Demon Night. You should feel greatly honored to see her fighting!"</p>

  <p>"That's Zheng's sword spirit. It could be Zheng's substitute during the battle. It's quite common to see that. However, it's a strange thing to know that a substitute has its own consciousness."</p>

  <p>On the arena, eyes of the ogre war lord glistened. At that moment, he couldn't care about anyone or anything else. Only Zheng mattered to him.</p>

  <p>Even if he had to sacrifice his own life, he must kill Zheng. The moment Zheng was declared dead, he, the ogre war lord, would be considered a hero of the ogre race.</p>

  <p>In the two ogre sacred places, extreme heroism was extremely adored, and for the people there, dying on the battlefield would be a great honor.</p>

  <p>Being brought up like that, the ogre war lord didn't care about the sword spirit, nor did he care if Zheng was going to fight. His only goal was to kill Zheng on the arena, and he was going to do that no matter what it took.</p>

  <p>With a deep breath, the ogre war lord let his forceful energy flow to his legs. The energy exploded, and it made him look like a fierce monster. All of a sudden, he broke out into a run, heading towards Zheng and bypassing Xun.</p>

  <p>But before the ogre war lord was able to get any closer to Zheng, Xun said, her tone once again indifferent, "I am you opponent, you ogre." Silent and graceful, Xun lifted her spear and pointed it at the running ogre war lord.</p>

  <p>"Fuck off!" the ogre shouted, his gaze firm on Zheng. As he rushed forward, he blocked Xun's spear attack with his saber. Successful in doing so, he ran faster towards Zheng, his eyes filled with murderous rage.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Zheng was standing in the corner of the fighting arena, his arms down and an indifferent expression on his face. Faced with the ogre war lord, he showed not one bit of interest in fighting him.</p>

  <p>"You had the nerve to ignore our queen, you must die!"</p>

  <p>"Surely our queen will put him to death!"</p>

  <p>When the Demon Nights heard the ogre war lord swear at Xun, many of them couldn't help but clamor. How could their queen be insulted like this? If it weren't for the rules of the arena, they must have rushed towards the ogre war lord to tear him into many pieces.</p>

  <p>Right after Xun's long spear was blocked by the ogre war lord, she drew an arc in the air with its tip. Then, with a light shake, the spear shaft started looking like a snake raising its head!</p>

  <p>Soon after, she spread out her arm, and the long spear shot from her hands.</p>

  <p>Its tip pierced through the air with a loud sound, and it headed straight towards the back of the ogre war lord.</p>

  <p>Zheng stared at the oncoming ogre war lord, his expression calm as if he could not be bothered. He even had the time to warn the ogre war lord of the danger behind him. "If I were you," he started, with little smirk on his lips.</p>

  <p>"I'd look behind."</p>

  <p>Any creature with a cultivation base of a war lord should be able to feel what was coming, so it was impossible that an ogre war lord would fail to sense the danger that was coming for him.</p>

  <p>But since Zheng was just there, looking indifferent and unconcerned, it seemed that he really hadn't decided to fight back or defend himself.</p>

  <p>It didn't matter to the ogre war lord if he died because a sharp spear stabbed him in the back. 'As long as I succeed in killing Zheng, I would be considered a hero by the ogres, ' he thought, focused on his mission.</p>

  <p>With his mind made up, he ran faster, his eyes only on one prize - the death of Zheng.</p>

  <p>The moment he came upon Zheng, his forceful energy exploded, and the enormous power that it produced transferred to the saber he was wielding.</p>

  <p>"Die!"</p>

  <p>The ogre war lord roared with great excitement, as he poised himself to give Zheng a death blow.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, just as he raised his blade, the tip of Xun's spear had already penetrated his chest.</p>

  <p>The ogre war lord had hoped that he would be able to withstand Xun's spear with the shear strength of his body until he successfully killed Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, he underestimated the strength of Xun's attack.</p>

  <p>Back in the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place, where Xun just wielded her spear casually, its eerie and formidable strength already made Zheng's heart skip a beat. Even Amber was shocked by its intensity.</p>

  <p>The strength of a sword spirit would increase with the enhancement of its owner's cultivation base. Back then, when Xun was only using the sword dance, her strength was almost the same as Zheng's.</p>

  <p>But what Xun used just now was a spear, and the skill she cultivated in order to do it was spear art. It was one of the best things one could inherit from the Demon Night race.</p>

  <p>Although Xun didn't say what sort of martial skill her spear art was, Zheng estimated that this spear art was surely a Transcendent Divine Might.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The long spear penetrated the ogre war lord's back, and a strong force exploded inside his body. That was the malicious aura.</p>

  <p>This malicious aura was not rotating around a certain center, but instead was spreading in all directions!</p>

  <p>In an instant, the ogre war lord's body exploded into many tiny pieces. With him dead, the blade he was wielding dropped on the arena floor.</p>

  <p>Clang!</p>

  <p>The whole arena was silent, and it made the sound of the fallen blade loud and crisp. Zheng hadn't moved from his place at all, still calm and indifferent as he had been minutes ago. This was all because of his deep faith in Xun.</p>

  <p>Xun, on the other hand, seemed to be bored either by her victory or her weak opponent. Her mouth twitched, and while rolling her eyes, she said,</p>

  <p>"He was boring."</p>

  <p>Zheng chuckled and replied, "I'll find a fighter competent enough to fight with you, don't worry."</p>

  <p>With a thorough understanding of ogres' character, he was sure that as long as he stood on where he was standing, the ogres would go up to him and challenge him one by one.</p>

  <p>While he was in the tenth floor, Zheng thought hard and long before deciding to come to the eleventh floor.</p>

  <p>The war outside the Cursed Land had already come to a deadlock. As long as the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place did not order a retreat, the ogres wouldn't dare attack the Purple Heart Sacred Place. Both of the two sides could endure a war of attrition. However, the ogres' two sacred places didn't have much time.</p>

  <p>Aside from finding an opportunity to break the deadlock outside the Cursed Land, killing Zheng was probably the most effective way to end the war.</p>

  <p>Therefore, more ogre war lords would challenge him to try to kill him.</p>

  <p>Before Zheng could finish saying what he wanted to say to Xun, a second ogre war lord already jumped up into the arena.</p>

  <p>Zheng faced Xun and shrugged. "Would you like another fight?" he asked flatly.</p>

  <p>Xun nodded. Turning around, she wielded her weapon and once again pointed the spear tip towards the ogre war lord.</p>

  <p>The first ogre war lord's aim was to kill Zheng, and thus ignored the existence of Xun and her threat. As a result, Xun finished him off easily.</p>

  <p>However, her second opponent seemed to be smarter and more cautious. He would still sacrifice his life to kill Zheng and save his people, but he would never die without a fight. After what happened to the first one, he knew that he would be penetrated by Xun's spear before he could even come anywhere near Zheng. He even had no chance of putting up a desperate fight.</p>

  <p>So he had to kill this woman before he could do anything else.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, this ogre war lord did not accurately assess Xun's strength. There was a special 'force' hidden inside Xun's spear, which even Zheng couldn't comprehend. Each and every spear attack could create a unique wave of energy, which terrified Zheng, as well as the No. 1 genius of Heavenly Feather Sacred Place, Amber.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, Zheng felt that this shapeless wave was similar to the weapon spirit inside the Tower of Sin since the weapon spirit's power directly came from the tower's previous owner. Could it be possible that Xun was somehow related to the previous owner of the Tower of Sin?</p>

  <p>He might have to ask her when they had free time.</p>

  <p>Any person with common sense knew that this ogre war lord was no match for Xun. He would never find a way to deal with Xun's spear skills.</p>

  <p>With just ten spear strikes, the ogre's weapon was broken to small fragments the size of a grain of rice. At last, Xun's spear penetrated the ogre's throat.</p>

  <p>After the ogre war lord's limp, dead body fell to the ground, a white stream of light shot towards Zheng's chest.</p>

  <p>The Lucky Light of these two ogre war lords amounted to that of ten war generals. Zheng was right about ascending the eleventh floor.</p>

  <p>It took Xun less than ten minutes to kill two ogre war lords.</p>

  <p>Other ogre war lords who had decided to ascend to the arena to try to kill Zheng felt both desperate and discouraged. If they couldn't defeat Xun first, how could they confront Zheng?</p>
