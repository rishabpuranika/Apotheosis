  <p>
</p>

  <p>In the Illusion Battlefield, the weak martial artists were defeated one after another.</p>

  <p>Some of those who were originally at the top of the list fell to the bottom rather rapidly.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, some of the lower-ranked martial artists were surprisingly rising to the top.</p>

  <p>All the races paid close attention to every update on the rankings as shown on the pyramids above their Illusion Spaces.</p>

  <p>The crowd kept a particularly close eye on the names of the top talents of every race. Many paid special attention to one name,  Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>At that point,  Luo Luo Zheng was a name often heard and well-remembered throughout the universe? even the top talents of different races, the sons of Supreme Lords, and the successors of world lords simply couldn't match up to him.</p>

  <p>And there was one simple reason behind it? he had the Roaring Token.</p>

  <p>Trillions of living beings could be found in the universe, and every one of them could hear the sounds transmitted by the Roaring Token. The mysterious girl shouted out Luo Zheng's name repeatedly.</p>

  <p>The news of Luo Luo Zheng being surrounded by dozens of Supreme Lords and killing some of them from years ago spread like wildfire throughout the universe.</p>

  <p>Since ancient times, he was the first martial artist to enjoy such fame and glory? not even the Supreme Lords had such.</p>

  <p>Not only Yolande kept an eye out for Luo Zheng's ranking? the members of the Celestial Position and the rest of the universe had their eyes hot on it.</p>

  <p>Because Luo Luo Zheng was so well-known, even the Supreme Lords grew curious as to how he had performed in the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>But the search left the people quite disappointed.</p>

  <p>With the trillions of names on the pyramid, the names on the lowest levels were almost totally stuck together, making it impossible for anyone to make anything out.</p>

  <p>Only the first few million martial artists were notable. They had accumulated quite a lot of Illusion Points, after all, and the gap between them and the rest was huge.</p>

  <p>To find Luo Zheng's name, people had to go all the way down from the top of the pyramid? they went through tens of millions of names, but Luo Zheng's couldn't be found.</p>

  <p>"Doesn't  Luo Luo Zheng have an extraordinary fairy place? Why isn't he ranked among the top ten million?"</p>

  <p>"That's simple? he got that indestructible fairy place only by good luck.</p>

  <p>He may not even be that talented, let alone skilled enough to make it to the top ten million. It seems as though he's weaker than the talents in some core sacred place."</p>

  <p>"You're right. The top ten million is a pretty low standard. It seems like a disaster will be unfolding soon."</p>

  <p>"Disaster? What disaster?" someone curiously asked.</p>

  <p>"Think about it. With Luo Zheng's talent, if he's trapped in the fairy place for tens of thousands of years or even hundreds of thousands of years, he'll definitely die in there. By then, the fairy place will be left without an owner. All the Supreme Lords in the universe will use every means possible to fight for it. I'm afraid no one will give it up."</p>

  <p>"There is some truth in that, yes."</p>

  <p>The martial artists from the outside world discussed among themselves the names at the top of the pyramid.</p>

  <p>70, 000 Illusion Points and the nineteen millionth place. Surely, Luo Luo Zheng wasn't satisfied with this ranking.</p>

  <p>On this trip back to the main city, Luo Luo Zheng wanted to get a minimum of 300, 000 Illusion Points? it was just enough to open up the cave in the wilderness.</p>

  <p>But as Luo Luo Zheng walked all the way around the city walls, the wry smile on his face grew all the more evident. Was there some kind of problem with the rules of the Illusion Battlefield?</p>

  <p>It wasn't that Luo Luo Zheng was avoiding a fight with anyone for the Illusion Points, but it was that he didn't even have a chance.</p>

  <p>More and more wolves returned. Those like Luo Luo Zheng who had returned to the main city had begun massacres around it.</p>

  <p>The main city was incomparably large. The martial artists who had amassed many Illusion Points were growing smarter? they couldn't afford to offend someone like Luo Luo Zheng. But they could, at the very least, hide from him.</p>

  <p>Because of this, many of them chose to merely hide within the city and refused to step into open view.</p>

  <p>Fighting was prohibited within the main city, so Luo Luo Zheng would never barge in to take someone out.</p>

  <p>The sensible martial artists who had racked up plenty of Illusion Points hid within the city. On the way there, though, there were some who knew no fear and rushed to challenge Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Even if Luo Luo Zheng killed them, he wouldn't gain any Illusion Points. Still, they insisted on provoking him and chasing after him to the end. He was left with no choice but to put in all his effort to get rid of them.</p>

  <p>"There's something wrong with the rules of the Illusion Battlefield."</p>

  <p>Overall, the set of rules itself was not much of a problem. If martial artists wanted to stand out, they had to kill the others. It was merely a system where the large fish ate the small fish, the small fish ate the shrimps, and the shrimps ate mud.</p>

  <p>But the organizers shouldn't have set up a safe haven like the main city? it was totally unfair in Luo Zheng's opinion.</p>

  <p>But the Illusion Battlefield had only just opened. If all the martial artists stayed within the city, it would be impossible to gauge their strength.</p>

  <p>With such a set-up, the Illusion Battlefield would go against its original purpose, so the rules should change pretty soon.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng pondered as he ran around the city.</p>

  <p>Just as he passed a corner of the city wall, a purple-colored flame curling up came into his view. The sound of an explosion came before him.</p>

  <p>Whir! Whir! Whir!</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, the wind pressure from the intense explosion contained numerous cyan wind blades. One could only imagine the intensity of the explosion just then.</p>

  <p>After the light ribbons slowly faded into nothing, a huge crater appeared at the bottom of the city wall. It was tens of thousands of feet wide and several thousand feet deep.</p>

  <p>On top of the city wall, many ogre martial artists looked into the crater, their eyes riddled with fear. A wisp of purple flame rose into the air from within.</p>

  <p>"Layne is truly worthy of being the successor of the lord of Ogre Flame World. It seems like he's already mastered his cultivation method to its maximum. The power of his attack just now was amazing!"</p>

  <p>"Wallis was still so arrogant when he just returned. He killed seven people within two hours and accumulated about 200, 000 Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, Layne killed him in only three moves? Three moves!"</p>

  <p>"The strongest martial artist in our city must be none other than Layne!"</p>

  <p>Many of them in the city were staring at the large pit, discussing among themselves. The conversation reached Luo Zheng's ears.</p>

  <p>"Layne?"</p>

  <p>The name didn't mean much to him, but Luo Luo Zheng got something significant from it? Layne seemed to be a step ahead of Luo Luo Zheng, having accumulated about 200, 000 Illusion Points in a short period of time. He was undoubtedly faster than Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Before Luo Luo Zheng came back, many martial artists had already returned to the main city. After obtaining a few Illusion Points, they quickly hid themselves in the main city. When Luo Luo Zheng came back, the weak ones were already defeated. During his return, Luo Luo Zheng had only encountered two warriors who could be called "sheep".</p>

  <p>Not long after, a rather skinny figure slowly rose from the pit.</p>

  <p>This person was none other than that Layne everyone was talking about.</p>

  <p>A streak of purple devil flame turned into a giant hand beneath his feet and lifted him up.</p>

  <p>Although Layne was also an ogre martial artist, he wasn't as tall as his clansmen. While still being much taller and stronger than humans, he was considered puny among the sturdy ogres.</p>

  <p>After Layne emerged from the pit, his eyes swept across his surroundings. As he spotted the many martial artists hiding within the city walls, his expression turned mocking.</p>

  <p>Even if they took the initiative to leave the city, he wouldn't bother killing those cowards.</p>

  <p>But when the gaze of Layne swept along the edge of the city wall and extended to its very end, he saw a lone figure floating in the corner.</p>

  <p>It was Luo Luo Zheng, dressed in cyan.</p>

  <p>A hint of doubt swept across Layne's face. Why wasn't he hiding within the city walls like the rest of the human martial artists?</p>

  <p>As the successor of the Ogre Flame World lord, conquering this city was merely a trivial goal for someone like Layne? what he truly wanted was to fight with the real top powerhouses in the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>From the beginning, Layne had always looked down upon the city, including all its martial artists.</p>

  <p>So when Luo Luo Zheng didn't hide himself from him, Layne was left rather puzzled. Had this human been scared silly?</p>

  <p>As he wondered, he saw Luo Luo Zheng fly toward him slowly with a warm smile on his face.</p>
