<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2061 Wishing Spell (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Wynn carefully handled Luo Luo Zheng, bracing himself to toss him down to Xun. Xun flew a few more feet and once she was in the right position caught Luo Luo Zheng in her arms. She flew a little further down to land gracefully on a sturdy boulder.</p>

  <p>Her face contorted in grief for her man, who groaned weakly in her grasp. Luo Luo Zheng had been heavily injured, and she wasn't sure what they could do to help alleviate some of his pain. The fact he had to be thrown into her arms hadn't helped, and she was sure of that.</p>

  <p>Xun knew just who was to blame for this terrible mess. A rush of irritation and hatred lanced through her core at the thought of Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>Despite the fact her neck had been snapped, she was still causing trouble for Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, Xun knew that Luo Luo Zheng irrationally cared for those close to his heart. He was a kind person. She knew if she were to be injured in that way and she no longer were to be alive, Luo Luo Zheng would become enraged.</p>

  <p>Even though that thought warmed her heart, she still believed the man was too impulsive! Too brash.</p>

  <p>"How could he be such an idiot!" She hissed, hugging him tighter to her chest. Her voice had been low so as not to disturb Luo Luo Zheng, but he shifted as if he had heard her. She attempted to blink the tears from her eyes to no avail as she looked over his injury. He'd fought valiantly and for that she admired him, but her worry was stronger than her admiration. His chest was bloodied and slightly sunken in, his breathing ragged and labored.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had only been struck by Pranav twice. However, the seemingly unremarkable palm strikes had caused insurmountable damage to his chest.</p>

  <p>Ever since their return from the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, it was the first time Luo Luo Zheng had been injured. It had come as a shock to them all.</p>

  <p>Xun could see the energy from Pranav's attack lingering in the wound. It was like a festering sore, attempting to corrode and infect his entire body.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was incredibly lucky to be the person he was. His physique was unique in that it naturally produced the primordial energy. Primordial energy was more commonly referred to as the warm current, and the gentle glow of the current was nearly surrounding Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The warm currents were like leeches, trying to overpower the energy and then attempt to siphon it from his body.</p>

  <p>However, Pranav's energy was nearly too much for the warm currents. It was domineering and could easily bat away the primordial energy.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Luo Luo Zheng was a natural conductor for the warm currents. They had accumulated a decent amount inside his body, and naturally worked against the energy trying to eat away at him. Xun watched with wide eyes as new currents would automatically counteract the energy from Pranav's attack. They worked to heal what they could, and finally were able to defeat the remaining darkness from the wound.</p>

  <p>The body in her arms sucked in a sharp breath, and then went into spasm.</p>

  <p>A large mouthful of blood, shining gold in the daylight, was spat out onto the rock at her feet. Luo Luo Zheng was panting and slowly opened his eyes.</p>

  <p>When he realized where he was he began to struggle from Xun's grip. She held on tightly. "You need to be careful! Your recklessness caused this injury. You don't need to cause any more damage." She could see the pure hatred in his eyes, but also the resolve. "You are no match for him at this moment!" she said. Her hold on him tightened as if she expected him to bolt.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng was extremely powerful and his strength outmatched that of many warriors, this was an entirely different situation. He could defeat any Supreme Lord as they had no real way of defending themselves against him. Pranav was not a Supreme Lord though.</p>

  <p>Pranav happened to be a True God, a being never so easily defeated.</p>

  <p>They'd just experienced what would happen to them in various unprepared battles. It was ludicrous for Luo Luo Zheng to even consider challenging him again in this state.</p>

  <p>Despite Xun's warning, the look of determination did not lessen from Luo Zheng's face. She knew there would be no dissuading him. Sighing, Xun set him carefully on his feet and took his hands in hers. "We need to have a plan if we're going to do this. They will be fighting soon, and we can plan to launch an attack then."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng assessed the woman before him, the sincerity of her words calming him. He knew she cared for him, but to see it was moving.</p>

  <p>He nodded, deciding Xun was right. If he rushed in now to battle Pranav unprepared, he'd certainly be killed. Wynn might have been able to save him this time, but there was no guarantee he'd be able to do so again. His impulsive actions could cause Wynn and the Supreme Lords to fall into terrible circumstances. Luo Luo Zheng certainly didn't want the whole of the Evolutionary Universe to suffer for a mistake on his part.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng considered the situation, he realized there was a chance. With the aide of Supreme Lord Lester, he could bring back Mu Ning. That was only if Supreme Lord Lester was still alive and could perform the Heavenly Destiny of Revival.</p>

  <p>He was standing there for a long while, lost in his thoughts when he felt someone's eyes on him. Xun was watching him expectantly, a brow raised in question. Luo Luo Zheng nodded at her once more, squeezing her hands in reassurance. He opened his mouth to relay his thoughts when an explosion thundered through the world. Following the sound was an epic shock wave, knocking them off their feet. It seemed the battle had already begun.</p>

  <p>They all turned their gazes to the sky. The Grand Supreme Lord had led the Sacred Supreme Lords to this area for battle, instructing them to assemble all manners of weapons.</p>

  <p>Wynn just happened to be a meticulous person as well. After learning just how powerful Pranav's reinforcements were, he knew that their Evolutionary Universe was weaker by comparison. He had tried his best to prevent the Sacred race from assembling their arrays. Anything to hinder the inevitable. It was precisely why he had taken action first!</p>

  <p>The leader of the Celestial Position race and the Supreme Lords had understood that acting first was the best option as well. Luo Luo Zheng and Xun watched in awe as the Supreme Lords readied themselves, and then let loose every weapon they had.</p>

  <p>There was no Star Sealing Technique to seal the Sacred Supreme Lords' space, no protection from the onslaught of attacks. After an attack, either side would keep their distance from one another. They didn't need to be close to the other to do damage.</p>

  <p>"Crack!" The harrowing sound echoed through the sky.</p>

  <p>It was the Space Law cracking apart. They watched as fissures opened up in the sky above the battle.</p>

  <p>Those fighting in the sky must have not expected the outcome before, so they all started to flee. As many Supreme Lords escaped across the sky, others teleported to adjoining worlds.</p>

  <p>Those that were left continued to fight, using all manners of strange abilities and superior strength. All around them more and more Heavenly Destinies were released.</p>

  <p>A rumble rolled across the sky.</p>

  <p>The earth below the sky was quivering.</p>

  <p>It had only lasted less than thirty seconds, but the battle had resulted in the death of eight Supreme Lords. They had been the ones that were unable to teleport in time.</p>

  <p>Five of the dead were Sacred Supreme Lords, the other three belonged to different races. One human and the other two ogres. The deaths were a result of the Sacred race being attacked off guard thanks to Wynn's forethought. It was the only explanation for how easily they had perished.</p>
