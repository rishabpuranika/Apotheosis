<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3194 Xu Clan's Plan </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Osrid's face turned pale upon hearing those words.</p>

  <p>He had fought with Morgan three years ago but was defeated with only a single strike.</p>

  <p>Morgan had called him a loser and kicked him into the lake.</p>

  <p>Osrid had never been so humiliated in his life.</p>

  <p>But he had been working hard these last three years and that motivated him to become an elite disciple.</p>

  <p>"You'd be wise not to look down upon me. Things change. People change,"</p>

  <p>Osrid said, brimming with pride in himself. He recognized this was an opportunity to redeem himself and put his shame behind him.</p>

  <p>The smirk on Morgan's face widened. "I know you have become the elite of the Azure Mountain. But as you progress, so do I, and I do it much faster!</p>

  <p>Before me, you will always be a loser!"</p>

  <p>Morgan waved his hand.</p>

  <p>Six rays of icy light burst out from behind his back, circling around him at high speed.</p>

  <p>He stamped his feet down, sinking the huge drum he stood on in the water as he rushed towards Osrid.</p>

  <p>The look in Osrid's eyes intensified when he faced Morgan's attack. A purple sword showed up in his hand.</p>

  <p>As a member of the Su Clan, he owned a treasure of high grade. It was an Other Shore Treasure.</p>

  <p>As the sword was drawn, the purple light turned into countless faint snake shadows, sweeping toward Morgan.</p>

  <p>Everyone present stood in shock as the scene unfolded.</p>

  <p>On the one hand, they were surprised at Osrid's progress. On the other hand, this was only the first match and it was so fierce. This was a rare occurrence at the Ripple Pavilion competition.</p>

  <p>The purple snake shadows stretched their large mouths open to swallow Morgan whole.</p>

  <p>But as they got close, the icy light surrounding Morgan charged at him.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh</p>

  <p>The six icy rays shone with dazzling brilliance and slashed the fierce purple snake shadows with deft ease.</p>

  <p>"Too weak!"</p>

  <p>Morgan sneered. The six rays of ice radiance picked up the pace now, and like a whipping wind, struck at Osrid.</p>

  <p>'Did the Phantom Snake Strike lose just like that?</p>

  <p>I can't believe my eyes.</p>

  <p>How can this be possible?' Osrid thought disheartened.</p>

  <p>He hadn't expected his sword skill, which he had cultivated so hard and with such care, to be defeated by Morgan with a single strike. It was a bitter pill to swallow.</p>

  <p>Morgan continued his pressure, attacking over and over as Osrid gritted his teeth and leaped away, barely avoiding the attacks. He was about to find his footing again on the drum when Morgan appeared from his flank and kicked him solidly in the chest.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>Osrid was kicked into the lake and water splashed wildly as he fell.</p>

  <p>"Three years ago I beat you with one move, and now, I have done it again.</p>

  <p>It seems that you haven't made any progress after all, loser," said Morgan, waving his hand dismissively at Osrid.</p>

  <p>Hearing this seriously peeved the people of the Su Clan and surly looks crossed their faces.</p>

  <p>"He is too arrogant!"</p>

  <p>"Please allow me to fight!"</p>

  <p>"Let me fight!"</p>

  <p>Both Irving and Nevyn were filled with fury. They wanted to soften the embarrassment and disgrace for the Su Clan, so they immediately asked Cailen for a fight.</p>

  <p>There was no trace of emotion present on Cailen's face.</p>

  <p>He didn't understand what the Xu Clan was up to, but since they had deliberately chosen the Su Clan as their target and even provoked them, they must have an agenda. But Cailen couldn't figure it out. He would never know their true goal was Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Why are you in such a hurry to fight? The Xu Clan hasn't issued another challenge," replied Cailen with composure.</p>

  <p>Only the winner had the right to challenge others. The losers had to wait for the other party to make a choice.</p>

  <p>In a situation like this, the later they fought, the better. That way, they could avoid fighting several clans in a row. That would be exhausting and so really most clans would not want to be chosen by Xu Clan.</p>

  <p>The head of the Xu Clan in Xu City then said, "Xu Clan selects Su Clan once more!"</p>

  <p>Elders of the Su Clan, such as Reid and Ruben, suddenly stood up and glared intensely at the head of the Xu Clan.</p>

  <p>Cailen frowned, confused by their decision. He wondered what on earth the Su Clan had done to offend the Xu Clan. The competition had only just begun, why were they already so hell bent on knocking Su Clan out?</p>

  <p>Marco sat by the small window, silently watching the Su Clan's every move.</p>

  <p>He figured if they still hoped to win, they would ask Zheng to help. If they didn't, Marco would have to reconsider the plan.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with the Xu Clan?"</p>

  <p>"There's no rivalry between us. Why are they doing this..."</p>

  <p>"There is little chance that our clan will enter the Ripple Pavilion. What's the use of forcing our elimination?"</p>

  <p>The Su Clan members were all confused. The Ripple Pavilion competition was a joyful event. Even the clans who usually showed hostility for one another would not go at it on this day.</p>

  <p>Till the day was over the biggest joke would be them being forced out by the Xu Clan right from the very beginning. The Su Clan would surely lose the respect of other clans in Su City.</p>

  <p>After some consideration, Cailen turned to Zheng and asked with a bright smile, "Zheng, would you mind fighting for us, please?"</p>

  <p>He wasn't hoping for Zheng to help the Su Clan enter the Ripple Pavilion. He just wanted to save their dignity.</p>

  <p>"Flag Master..." Gant stared at Zheng with eager eyes.</p>

  <p>Zheng had agreed to this before. After all, he owed them one since they helped him melt the Shade Stone. He couldn't really refuse them.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded, stood up from the seat and jumped gracefully. His figure floated past the heads of the crowd and flew towards the center of the Clear Lake, gently falling on one of the huge drums.</p>

  <p>"Young Master, he has agreed to do it!"</p>

  <p>"He's really in the battle ring!"</p>

  <p>"Everything is as expected, Young Master!"</p>

  <p>Both Lazlo and Grayson praised Marco's brilliant idea. A faint smile flickered across Marco's face.</p>

  <p>"What if Zheng wins and he doesn't challenge the Xu Clan?" Drystan suddenly asked.</p>

  <p>Marco, Lazlo and Grayson stopped dead on hearing this. They hadn't quite considered that.</p>

  <p>It was the rule of the Ripple Pavilion competition that only the winner could challenge others.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry! It's the head of the Su Clan who issues a challenge. We'll force him to challenge us," Marco said snickering with schemes filling his mind.</p>

  <p>Morgan stood on the huge drum, looking at Zheng and feeling very proud of himself. "You are not a member of the Su clan, are you?" asked Morgan.</p>

  <p>"No," replied Zheng blankly.</p>

  <p>Morgan pointed at the bank of the Clear Lake and continued, "Since you are an outsider in this, I advise you not to get involved. Just admit defeat and leave. It's not too late."</p>

  <p>Morgan was also an elite of Vastness Mountain. The people who participated in the Seven Mountains Meeting were selected by Marco.</p>

  <p>Morgan was not one of those invited and so had never seen Zheng in action.</p>

  <p>Zheng calmly pulled out his Snow Sword, and replied nonchalantly, "I have no intention to leave. I owe the Su Clan a favor. I have promised to help them and I will keep that promise."</p>

  <p>"Then you'll definitely regret this," said Morgan, shaking his head, not taking Zheng seriously at all.</p>

  <p>In an instant the six icy rays behind him burst out and turned into little stars.</p>

  <p>Under the spread of the cold air, a thin layer of ice formed on the lake!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, he was in front of Zheng.</p>
