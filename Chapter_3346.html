  <p>
</p>

  <p>Only Sally, Hutton, and a few other young members of the Nine Li race were left in the Splendid Palace.</p>

  <p>Although it was the first time they had personally met, Luo Zheng could feel a sense of kinship with them, coming from the same race.</p>

  <p>Ambrose had entrusted them to him. He was sure to take good care of them.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, can you really do it? Can you rebuild the Nine Li race?" Sally asked, blinking her wide, innocent eyes.</p>

  <p>Growing up, she had heard about the past glory of the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>Back then, there was no need for their people to find different places to hide. Every time worship day arrived, over ten thousand other races came to worship.</p>

  <p>If Chiyou was angered, the entire Source World would tremble.</p>

  <p>But this glory mostly existed only in Sally's imagination. If only Luo Zheng could really make it become a reality.</p>

  <p>She was the youngest and most naive of them, after all.</p>

  <p>But Hutton and the others didn't think so.</p>

  <p>It wasn't that they doubted Luo Zheng's strength and talent, but they felt that such a great promise just could not be fulfilled.</p>

  <p>Chiyou was truly formidable.</p>

  <p>But in the end, he fell into defeat by the hands of the Bearing race.</p>

  <p>The Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race were no weaker than the Nine Li race in their prime. Even the Taiyi Heaven Palace didn't dare to act rashly against them. It could only be wishful thinking to consider Luo Zheng fighting them all alone.</p>

  <p>"Sally, don't take it too seriously. You're daydreaming if you really expect the Nine Li race to rise like it did back then. These are different times," said a young man beside her.</p>

  <p>"Umar!" Hutton called him out with a frown.</p>

  <p>Umar was one of the best members of the Nine Li race that Ambrose had brought here.</p>

  <p>"Am I wrong? The Grand Chieftain was once so powerful. But the Yellow Emperor defeated him too easily! Sure, Luo Zheng is powerful, but only within our generation. Is he capable of leading our entire race up the ranks? There's no way!" The atmosphere grew grim. Pausing for a moment, Umar continued,</p>

  <p>"He's just lucky to have outshone us on the Other Shore!"</p>

  <p>"Shut up! Don't forget who Luo Zheng is!" Hutton's face darkened.</p>

  <p>On their way here, Leopold had told them that Luo Zheng's blood was much purer than theirs.</p>

  <p>If the Nine Li race hadn't declined, he would have gone up higher than them in status.</p>

  <p>"So what? The Nine Li race has declined. His identity and status no longer matter!" Umar continued his argument.</p>

  <p>"Do you think it was because of our grandfather that Master Qiu Yinhe was willing to accept us and help us get a ticket to the Chaotic Source World?"</p>

  <p>Flames burned in Hutton's eyes as he stared Umar down.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of the super forces, the Nine Li race was worthless. Their former honor and glory were things of the past.</p>

  <p>It was thanks to Luo Zheng that the Taiyi Heaven Palace was willing to help them enter the Chaotic Source World. It definitely wasn't for Ambrose's sake.</p>

  <p>"Remember! Luo Zheng will be our young master from today forward!" Hutton said fiercely.</p>

  <p>Umar was still not convinced. "You want me to call him young master?</p>

  <p>Why? Is he stronger than I am?"</p>

  <p>After that, the aura in his body surged, and a statue of a fiendish beast appeared before him. It was his Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>On the way there, Sally and Hutton had been boasting about Tianxing's strength on the Other Shore. But now that Umar met him, he doubted Sally and Hutton's claims about his strength. Finally, he decided to challenge Luo Zheng and display his Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>The statue was a fourth-grade Other Shore Token from Stage Thirteen.</p>

  <p>Once it was activated, a malicious aura spread all over the Splendid Palace.</p>

  <p>Before the others could stop him, Umar turned into a gust of wind and rushed toward Luo Zheng, chopping down on his head with a single push of his palm.</p>

  <p>"Take this!"</p>

  <p>Being Ambrose's grandson, Umar was indeed a gifted man. The Other Shore Power he had extracted from the statue reached 900 Jun.</p>

  <p>If struck by his palm, even a mountain would break in half, let alone a mere person.</p>

  <p>"Umar! Don't do it!"</p>

  <p>"Stop!"</p>

  <p>Everyone was taken aback and wide-eyed. They knew that Umar had a strange temper, but they were all told not to stir up any trouble on their way there. Little did they expect Umar to provoke Luo Zheng the minute Ambrose left them.</p>

  <p>Sally and her brother had witnessed Luo Zheng's strength on the Other Shore, but it was completely different from the Source World. No one could tell whether or not he'd manage to resist Umar's strike.</p>

  <p>"900 Jun. That is good in Stage Thirteen."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's face remained dead-calm. He didn't even bother to shift his feet. With a raise of his hand, the Shade Stone liquid attached itself to his right arm.</p>

  <p>Then, he slightly tilted his wrist and had Umar's hand precisely in his grasp.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>The Splendid Palace shook slightly before a fist-sized area cracked open right under Luo Zheng's feet. With that, Umar's fierce blow was stopped.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's grip was iron-tight. Umar couldn't twist his hand out of it.</p>

  <p>The sight had everyone holding their breath.</p>

  <p>On the way there, Leopold had announced that if Luo Zheng made it to Stage Thirteen on the Other Shore, his strength must be far greater than that of his peers. Back then, Umar only snorted at the exaggeration. The others weren't totally convinced either. But now, it seemed that even Leopold had greatly underestimated Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Even after taking Umar's all-out strike with a single hand, Luo Zheng was completely unharmed. No one there could even imagine finding someone on the same level of strength.</p>

  <p>An exasperated sigh broke the silence. Hutton turned to Luo Zheng and said, "Luo Zheng, please forgive Umar's rudeness."</p>

  <p>Still indifferent, Luo Zheng merely let go of the man's hand. He looked up to the ceiling of the Splendid Palace and said, "We're all from the same race, so I will forgive him. Our people are facing a great decline, so we have to keep working harder. Grandpa Ambrose has entrusted all of you to me. I only have one request." He looked firmly at the group before continuing, "Don't ever give yourselves up."</p>

  <p>Hutton, Umar, and the rest looked at him complicatedly.</p>

  <p>The small world they had been hiding in was haunted by the Bearing race.</p>

  <p>Neither the elders nor the younger generation were courageous enough.</p>

  <p>They ended up giving themselves away gradually.</p>

  <p>During his time in the Taiyi Heaven Palace, Luo Zheng did not forget where he came from. He was confident by nature. The others could sense his genuine pride and suddenly felt ashamed of themselves.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng can make it happen. I choose to believe it!" Sally chimed in eagerly.</p>

  <p>"I believe it too," Hutton agreed.</p>

  <p>"Soon, our Nine Li race will rise again!" And with that, the rest of them echoed with them.</p>

  <p>After sending Ambrose away, Qiu Yinhe turned back to Luo Zheng and the rest. "I'll send you up the Taiyi Mountain first. Please follow me."</p>

  <p>It was the first time that the youth of the Nine Li race had left their elders. It was rather nerve-wracking to follow behind Qiu Yinhe in silence.</p>

  <p>Standing on Qiu Yinhe's huge sword, they looked curiously down at the Dragon City and the great mountains in the distance.</p>

  <p>Ever since they could remember, they had nestled in such a small world.</p>

  <p>Never had they really explored the vast Source World. It was their first time stepping outside and witnessing first-hand the size of a super force.</p>

  <p>Once they returned to the Heart Flow Sect, Qiu Yinhe had applied for an independent courtyard house where he had the six members of the Nine Li race settle down.</p>

  <p>Even then, their background was sensitive. Although the Heart Flow Sect was the Taiyi Heaven Palace's core area, Qiu Yinhe had especially warned them to keep their identity hidden. If they needed anything, they had to turn to Luo Zheng.</p>
