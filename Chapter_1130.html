<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Although it was very easy for a warrior to die from a Heavenly Tribulation, many warriors managed to overcome it and had even cultivated further, effectively making themselves stronger.</p>

  <p>If even the Heavenly Tribulation was unable to kill a powerful warrior, the world itself would make a way to make sure that the said warrior would be exiled from the world.</p>

  <p>Of course, this was what was called "going to the Upper World."</p>

  <p>However, it was a pity that there was a problem with this world's path to the Upper World. Even if the world wanted to kick a mighty warrior out of its premises, it wouldn't be able to.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon replied lightly, "Yes. With the resources in the Lower World, a warrior more powerful than Soul Sea Realm masters would not be able to appear in the Lower World."</p>

  <p>"But that person's strength surpasses that of Soul Sea Realm warriors,"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng started, slightly hesitating. "How is it possible that he's here?"</p>

  <p>"Well, Luo Zheng, the answer to that is very simple. He is not a person from this world. I am sure that he came from the Upper World," the cyan dragon explained.</p>

  <p>"I see! That explains everything!" Luo Zheng said, his face lightening up, his heart even skipping a beat. Without wasting any time, he started searching the memory of the world's will for the origin of this white-browed Taoist priest.</p>

  <p>"What?" he suddenly exclaimed, his face contorted due to surprise and frustration. "There's no information on this guy!" It was only then did he discover that the existence of this powerful priest was nowhere to be found in the memory of the world's will.</p>

  <p>"That's very normal," the cyan dragon said, his voice soothing to calm Luo Zheng down. "While the world's will you got is in a state wherein you can know everything about the world, this priest came to this world through the Reverse Spirit Channel. He is not a life form that was born in this world. Because of that, I am sure that he paid a considerable price to come to this world," he concluded, trying to make Luo Zheng understand.</p>

  <p>With that, Luo Zheng was successfully enlightened on the nature of the powerful being. However, something still wasn't sitting right with him.</p>

  <p>"But I was able to find the Soul Nurturing Wood. Tell me, why couldn't I find any information on this priest?"</p>

  <p>"Well, the Soul Nurturing Wood is a dead item. If you don't believe me, you can check the Dark Nether Cave, Immortal Mist's celestial tomb, and the fairy palace in the Eastern Region. It's impossible to find the information on living things that don't belong to this world."</p>

  <p>As he was still unconvinced, Luo Zheng did what the cyan dragon said. As he researched through the memory of the world's will, he was able to find out that the things presented to him by the cyan dragon were very correct. He was unable to search the Dark Nether Cave, the Tower of Sin, and the fairy palace in his memory, but he was able to find the celestial tomb.</p>

  <p>Even without the cyan dragon's explanation, Luo Zheng could already guess the reason why he couldn't search these places. Even though Immortal Mist was also a warrior from the Upper World, he was born in this world and so Luo Zheng was able to find his existence in the memory of the world's will.</p>

  <p>However, since the fairy palace and the Tower of Sin were both places that originated from another world, Luo Zheng was not able to find them.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng also tried to look for the young man who took Yan away, but he was also unable to find him either.</p>

  <p>Since there was no other way he could find anything useful on the powerful priest, he decided to leave him behind. Just as the priest had ordered, the mighty warriors of the four divine kingdoms began to pass dragon blood around.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng saw several Life and Death Realm masters continuously giving out small bottles to many divine-level talents.</p>

  <p>Even after dispelling the curse surrounding the Feather Holy Sea, it was still difficult for the Virtual Tribulation Realm warriors to enter. The power from the blood sacrifice that remained was enough to make Virtual Tribulation Realm warriors unable to move even an inch, causing them to eventually die helplessly in the Feather Holy Sea. That was why every human warrior had to consume a drop of Genuine Dragon blood before entering.</p>

  <p>The Genuine Dragon blood was a great tonic for ordinary warriors. After consuming it, they would be able to enhance their strength as a trace of the Genuine Dragon's power had been contained within their own blood.</p>

  <p>However, for warriors of this level, this tiny bit of Genuine Dragon's power was extremely insignificant— its main use was to help them resist the power of the blood sacrifice that was abundant in the Feather Holy Sea.</p>

  <p>The length of a Genuine Dragon could be thousands of miles, almost comparable to a continent. Their blood, however, wasn't a rare treasure in the Upper World. Otherwise, when Luo Zheng entered the Genuine Dragon World, he wouldn't have been given the Genuine Dragon blood.</p>

  <p>It wasn't clear how the four divine kingdoms were able to obtain this amount of Genuine Dragon blood. Luo Zheng concluded that they had also used the Reverse Spirit Channel in order to obtain it.</p>

  <p>After a few minutes, Luo Zheng had also been given a drop of the Genuine Dragon blood.</p>

  <p>A strange smile appeared on Zheng's face as he received his small bottle.</p>

  <p>The Genuine Dragon blood contained in his body was surely more than all of the drops combined, not to mention that his body also contained Genuine Dragon Blood Essence.</p>

  <p>Unlike normal Genuine Dragon blood, Genuine Dragon Blood Essence was something warriors from this world would die for. This was because Genuine Dragon blood could reproduce, while Genuine Dragon Blood Essence couldn't. Even in the Genuine Dragon World, a drop of Genuine Dragon Blood Essence was an extremely rare find.</p>

  <p>Some warriors immediately swallowed the Genuine Dragon blood in a single gulp as soon as they received their bottles.</p>

  <p>Although the Genuine Dragon blood wasn't of much use to Luo Zheng, he still drank it in order to blend in with the others.</p>

  <p>After every warrior on the square had taken in their Genuine Dragon blood, they began to disperse. They knew that they were about to set off.</p>

  <p>It was just like what Randy said. Warriors who were to explore the Feather Holy Sea would have to form their own teams. Within a few moments, the warriors grabbed a partner or formed a group of three.</p>

  <p>At that moment, a voice suddenly rang out. "Tianxing! I'd like to invite you to join my team! Let's explore the secret land together!"</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng turned around, he discovered that the one who spoke was the crown prince of the Wind Divine Kingdom. Now, Luo Zheng already knew that the Wind Divine Kingdom was the Lu family's territory and the crown prince was called Horace Lu.</p>

  <p>Being invited by a crown prince was considered to be a great honor to the one who was invited.</p>

  <p>But then again with the power that Luo Zheng had displayed a while ago, who wouldn't want him to join their teams?</p>

  <p>Although the four divine kingdoms had explored secret lands for many years now and already had a good understanding of the four secret lands, there were still many unpredictable dangers lurking in where they were headed. Because of that, having a mighty warrior like Luo Zheng in one's team would increase the chances of the team surviving unscathed tenfold.</p>

  <p>As a response to his invitation, Luo Zheng smiled apologetically and said, "I'm sorry, but I've already accepted Lord Randy's invitation."</p>

  <p>"Lord Randy? Randy Zhou?" Horace Lu asked as he frowned slightly.</p>

  <p>By that time, Randy, Camilla and the others, were already approaching Luo Zheng. When they arrived, Randy patted Luo Zheng on the shoulder and turned to Horace Lu, saying, "Yes. Luo Zheng has already joined my team. Sorry kid, but you're a bit too late!"</p>

  <p>Dejection was written all over Horace Lu's face. Actually before he invited Luo Zheng, he had already known in his heart that it would be impossible for Luo Zheng to agree to him. Although Luo Zheng was not a warrior from the Harlen Divine Kingdom, he was representing the Harlen Divine Kingdom in battle. Horace Lu just wanted to try his luck.</p>

  <p>"You're awesome, Tianxing!" Camilla said as she neared Luo Zheng. An excited smile was already on her luscious lips.</p>

  <p>Before Zheng's battles, they had already known that his strength was not to be trifled with because they had sparred with him before. They believed that Luo Zheng had displayed at least eighty percent of his strength before them.</p>

  <p>But after they saw Luo Zheng fighting the warriors from the other divine kingdoms, they then realized that they were wrong.</p>

  <p>They really didn't imagine that Luo Zheng would be that strong. Not only did he crush the strongest talents of the divine kingdoms, he also injured a Soul Sea Realm master— War Emperor York, who was even an elite among the Soul Sea Realm masters.</p>

  <p>If they hadn't personally witnessed this scene, they wouldn't have dared to believe it.</p>

  <p>With that, the gazes that Camilla and the others shot at Luo Zheng had completely changed. Especially Camilla— the only thing in her eyes at that very moment was a fervent worship!</p>

  <p>Being able to form a team with Luo Zheng was an extremely fortunate thing.</p>

  <p>With him in tow, they sure would likely reap a great harvest from this trip.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded his head. "Alright. When should we set off?"</p>

  <p>"We can set off now," Randy said with a smile. "According to the rules, once you win against the warriors from the other three divine kingdoms, the warriors from the winning divine kingdom would be the first ones to enter the Feather Holy Sea. However, that is of no importance to us..."</p>

  <p>As they were talking, Bram, the crown prince of Harlen Divine Kingdom, had already led several people flying high into the sky. They followed the West Dragon River upstream, entering the Feather Holy Sea.</p>

  <p>"If that's the case, then let's go!" Luo Zheng said enthusiastically. The reason why he had joined the Jade Martial House and fought on behalf of Harlen Divine Kingdom was to enter the Feather Holy Sea. Finally, he would be able to step into it.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, Luo Zheng, Randy, Camilla, and the others were flying into the sky, heading straight for the Feather Holy Sea.</p>

  <p>Waves surged towards the shore of the Feather Holy Sea and the faint golden light still contained the power of blood sacrifice. The moment Luo Zheng entered the sea, he felt an omnipresent power wrap around him.</p>

  <p>'Is this the power of blood sacrifice?' Luo Zheng thought as his eyes flashed.</p>

  <p>Under the influence of the force of blood sacrifice, Zheng's flying speed had greatly slowed. The speed of Randy and Camilla had slowed down even more than his.</p>

  <p>As they continued forward, they felt an invisible hand pulling them into the sea.</p>
