<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 165 Encounter With A Demon (Part One) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Sky Forest was named for its spruces.</p>

  <p>Soaring spruce trees could be seen everywhere. The trees were hundreds of yards tall, straight as spears, and thrust into the sky.</p>

  <p>Standing at the entrance of the forest, the disciples couldn't help feeling as though there was something dark and dismal about the vastness of the dense trees.</p>

  <p>Once all the disciples had gotten off the huge flying chariot, they were distributed into small groups before being allowed to head into Sky Forest. Every group contained ten disciples� five inner disciples and five outer disciples.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was surrounded by the five inner disciples from Drizzle Peak as soon as he jumped out of the chariot.</p>

  <p>"I don't give a shit what happened between you and Yale," a black-robed disciple said as he stepped forward, his voice haughty and supercilious.</p>

  <p>"You do as I say if you want to survive the forest. If you're going to behave as you did in the flying chariot, you will find yourself in the belly of the demon. Remember that, boy!"</p>

  <p>"Don't get cocky when you don't have the right to be. You know what they say, 'the nail that sticks out must be pounded down'. You are just an outer disciple, and only a half-step into the nature level. You still need our protection during the trial. Why do you have to pick a fight with Yale and drag us into it? To be clear, we will not get involved if Yale comes after you later," another black-robed disciple added.</p>

  <p>"I heard that you made quite a reputation for yourself among the outer disciples. But let me make it plain, outer disciples are at the very bottom of the pile. What you achieved was nothing compared to what inner disciples can do. Now learn your lesson and look before you leap," A third black-robed disciple said to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The remaining two disciples glanced at Luo Zheng coldly. Then the five inner disciples turned to head forward.</p>

  <p>Gury, Henry, and the other two outer disciples followed quickly. As they passed Luo Zheng, each spared him a sympathetic glance.</p>

  <p>Of the four outer disciples, Henry took great pleasure in seeing this.</p>

  <p>This trail was extremely dangerous. If the inner disciples had decided to leave Luo Zheng to his fate, Luo Zheng would definitely be headed to his execution.</p>

  <p>So the sight of Luo Zheng being chastened by inner disciples filled Henry with great joy.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled lightly at the rebuke from the inner disciples. But his heart turned cold.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng wasn't a cold-hearted man.</p>

  <p>He had spared the lives of the Luo children even though they had bullied him and had also tried to kill him.</p>

  <p>At Cloud Sect, things had changed for Luo Zheng. He felt a sense of belonging even though he had been at Drizzle Peak for a short while. For the first time in a very long time, Luo Zheng felt revived by the warmth of his friendship with Nory, Sean, Wurth, and the others.</p>

  <p>However, the inner disciples had a hostile attitude toward him. Today, they drew a line between them because he was at war with Yale.</p>

  <p>But it really didn't matter. Luo Zheng had never enlisted other people's help to protect himself. He had cultivated his powers to such a great extent that he felt self-sufficient. In any case, the future was unpredictable. Perhaps during the trial, the disciples would end up begging for his protection!</p>

  <p>Zheng's smile faded as this thought. When he stepped into Sky Forest, he was wearing his usual calm expression.</p>

  <p>Sky Forest was different from the rain forest in the south. Spruce trees pressed close and formed a dense canopy that shut out the sky.</p>

  <p>Occasionally, some sunlight seeped through the leaves, but on the whole, the forest was very dim and quiet.</p>

  <p>They heard strange bird chirping from time to time. Sometimes the birdsong was distant, sometimes it sounded very close, but nobody could make out where it was coming from.</p>

  <p>Once they had entered the forest, the disciples were engulfed by the bleak atmosphere. Everyone was on high alert. After all, it was Sky Forest.</p>

  <p>Sky Forest was not the front line of the battle. It was located between the Imperial Capital and White Emperor City. The White Emperor City was closest to the Shura Battlefield. Still, many demon scouts secretly crossed the front line and hid in Sky Forest. Although inner disciples possessed power comparable to ordinary demon soldiers, there were few absolute certainties in a fight. You never knew who would win until the last minute.</p>

  <p>Henry, Gury, and the other two outer disciples of Drizzle Peak reached for their weapons as they moved warily behind the five inner disciples.</p>

  <p>Compared to them, Luo Zheng seemed most relaxed.</p>

  <p>His soul, which had been forged was way stronger than normal people, including the five nature creatures ahead.</p>

  <p>So Luo Zheng was more sensitive than others. His senses were heightened to sense even the slightest noises like the wind stirring the grass. No sound could elude him!</p>

  <p>As the Drizzle Peak disciples pressed further and further into the forest, they separated from the other Cloud Sect disciples.</p>

  <p>Watchfully, they followed the trail in the forest for about twenty miles.</p>

  <p>Then, there was a sharp crack. An inner disciple who had been sent to scout ahead had stepped on a dry branch.</p>

  <p>"What happened?" Henry was the first to call out. He had never been in a situation like this and found that his nerves were strained all the time.</p>

  <p>"Relax, Henry. It's no big deal. I just stepped on a branch." The disciple turned and gave Henry a mocking smile.</p>

  <p>"Watch out!" Just as the inner disciple turned to speak to Henry, a huge snake emerged from behind a thick spruce trunk.</p>

  <p>The snake's trunk-like body had a grey-green color that matched the spruce's bark. This camouflage had allowed it to hide in plain sight.</p>

  <p>The snake lunged at the inner disciple, Its jaws opened wide as if it were going to swallow its prey whole.</p>
