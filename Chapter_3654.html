<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3654 Getting More People To His Side </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The huge Corpse Spirit Sun Crows were controlled by Emperor Charm like vicious puppets.</p>

  <p>They intertwined with each other and formed a unique and gigantic maze that eventually trapped Elizabeth, Dugan, Micah, and Bagot.</p>

  <p>Leaning against a Corpse Spirit Sun Crow, Zheng turned to Auden and Pearce who were a few meters away, and let out an intriguing smile.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A huge Lofty Sword darted upwards. Sitting on the magnificent blade, Libby couldn't help but purse her lips as she looked at the pile of Corpse Spirit Sun Crows, with doubt and caution.</p>

  <p>Pearce caught a glimpse of Libby and then stared back at Zheng, bearing bewildered eyes.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, what is going on?" Auden finally asked.</p>

  <p>It was really absurd from whatever angle it was looked upon. No matter how hard they guessed, there was no telling what was inside Zheng's head at that moment.</p>

  <p>"Elder Pearce, Elder Auden, just trust me. You'll know later," Zheng replied but didn't disclose anything.</p>

  <p>At the same time, blue and green flames suddenly burst out from inside the maze formed by the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows. It turned out that Elizabeth and Dugan had taken the initiative to launch the first strike.</p>

  <p>As the flames swirled violently, Micah and Bagot were caught by surprise.</p>

  <p>They couldn't figure out why the loyal Elizabeth would dare betray the Sun Crow race.</p>

  <p>The flames continued to sizzle from within the maze as Micah and Bagot roared, mightily deflecting the attacks thrown at them.</p>

  <p>Soon after, the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows also spurted out blue flames, boosting the attacks of Elizabeth and Dugan. The whole maze was blazing like a tremendous hellfire.</p>

  <p>Micah and Bagot were powerful warriors, only second to Emperor Charm in the whole Sun Crow race. Their strength was even comparable to that of the leaders of the seven mountains. Even if they were caught off guard by the sneak attack of Elizabeth and Dugan, they wouldn't be defeated by them in one go.</p>

  <p>However, if it was Emperor Charm himself who dealt with Micah and Bagot, then they wouldn't stand a chance, as he had supreme control over the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows.</p>

  <p>The fierce battle lasted for only about half a minute. Then, the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows forming the maze started to spread out again.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth and Dugan finally got out.</p>

  <p>Dugan was unscathed, while half of Elizabeth's beautiful face was burnt due to the encounter.</p>

  <p>"Are you all right?" Zheng asked worriedly.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth reached out her hand and gently brushed her face. The burned part of her face quickly began recovering. She shook her head and answered, "I'm fine. It was my fault that I was accidentally injured by the flames."</p>

  <p>She didn't have any dissatisfaction since it was the method of Emperor Charm that had hurt her. Being killed in his hands would even be an honor for her, so there was no issue whatsoever for receiving a measly injury.</p>

  <p>As for Micah and Bagot, the two were covered with dust and grime as they got out of the encirclement. They were not severely harmed but their faces were contorted in pain.</p>

  <p>Each of them obtained a wound on their chest, where the transformed blood flowed. After the pain was gone, they floated in midair and stared blankly at Zheng. There was an extremely contradictory feeling that rose from within their hearts.</p>

  <p>Buzz…</p>

  <p>Emperor Charm's shadow emerged in the sky and once again issued an order to make the two powerful warriors submit to Zheng. Micah and Bagot didn't have a choice, so they lowered their heads as they felt rather conflicted about what was happening.</p>

  <p>Even Pearce and Auden were dumbfounded at the scene.</p>

  <p>They were so shocked that they couldn't think of a logical reason why this was happening.</p>

  <p>They wondered what that shadow above Zheng's head really was.</p>

  <p>It couldn't be a soul fragment of Emperor Charm, could it?</p>

  <p>If it was a soul fragment of Emperor Charm, it could indeed command the hearts and minds of those who belonged in the Sun Crow race like Elizabeth and the others.</p>

  <p>But still, the impending question was why would Emperor Charm help Zheng and the Oneness Sky Palace?</p>

  <p>If he was that kind of person, the war wouldn't have happened in the first place.</p>

  <p>It didn't make any sense for the two old men. They needed an explanation or they wouldn't be able to accept that these were all true.</p>

  <p>"Fascinating…"</p>

  <p>Libby chuckled as she sat on the Lofty Sword, watching the unfolding scenes.</p>

  <p>Previously, she thought that Zheng had just obtained the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows by sheer luck. However, they were all witnessing that he also made the most powerful warriors of the Sun Crow race stand on his side.</p>

  <p>By what it looked, it seemed that Zheng was planning to bring all the members of the Sun Crow race to his side.</p>

  <p>The warriors of the Sun Crow race present were enough to give the entire Oneness Sky Palace an atrocious and tortuous battle. Now, if Zheng really had full control over them, his status would even far surpass that of the mountain leaders, and ultimately be comparable to that of Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>

  <p>One who possessed admirable talent would always have a strong sense of vigilance towards the rise of another domineering talent.</p>

  <p>Therefore, even if Zheng didn't do anything to provoke or offend Libby, she wouldn't be able to hide her hostility towards him in their first encounter.</p>

  <p>But after only several days, she realized that they were not on the same level. Zheng's ultimate ambition didn't lie in the Land of Sword Grief or the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, can you please tell us now?" Auden asked as cautiously as possible.</p>

  <p>There was definitely no one in the Source World that could make the strong warriors of the Sun Crow race fall into absolute submission except for Emperor Charm. So they were beginning to wonder if the shadow was the real Emperor Charm.</p>

  <p>Zheng was actually faced with a difficult question that it almost gave him a headache.</p>

  <p>During the fierce battle between the two enormous forces, both sides lost powerful warriors every second.</p>

  <p>He didn't want to see anyone from the Oneness Sky Palace or the Sun Crow race die. But it was something inevitable in order to attain a much bigger goal.</p>

  <p>Looking at the expression of the two elders, Zheng didn't have a choice but to explain so that they could let this go.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Zheng gave a simple answer, "I used the bloodline of the Sun Crow race… and it isn't the real Emperor Charm."</p>

  <p>Normally, the elders wouldn't be satisfied with those explanations alone.</p>

  <p>However, they also recognized that the on-going warfare was at the most menacing stage. Since Zheng had come up with such an incredible scheme, they naturally had to seize every opportunity to gain the upper hand.</p>

  <p>In fact, the two elders had the resolve to sacrifice themselves in this war if worst came to worst. But now that they were witnessing a new light of hope, they decided to push aside their doubts for now. The only thing in their minds right at this moment was to survive and win this war in any means possible.</p>

  <p>"I understand your reason if you cannot disclose all information right now.</p>

  <p>Rest assured, no matter what kind of method you are using, Auden and I are at your disposal," Pearce said with a burning passion in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded slightly as he was relieved to finally hear their positive response. At the same time, something caught his attention and he quickly turned towards that scene.</p>

  <p>Seven huge sword shadows madly bombarded a certain member of the Sun Crow race. Deafening sounds reverberated like thunderous roars.</p>

  <p>It turned out that the one who blasted out the sword shadows was Athemar, and the recipient of his ruthless skill was Tyrese of the Sun Crow race.</p>

  <p>Tyrese's strength was categorized at the bottom of the second rank among the royal guards. He presumed that Athemar's strength was far weaker than Pearce and Auden. With that, he thought that he could easily defeat Athemar in a one-on-one battle.</p>

  <p>However, it never occurred to him that Athemar was actually strong enough to be ranked first among the Oneness Governors.</p>

  <p>The Lofty Swords chased him down vehemently. Tyrese could only curse wildly as he continued to retreat.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>Under the persistent bombardment of the sword shadows, Tyrese's Chaotic Source Spirits had already fallen into severe exhaustion. Fear started to crept all over his face as he hysterically thought on how to successfully escape.</p>

  <p>Athemar had a serious look on his face and didn't have the slightest intention of letting him go alive.</p>

  <p>"Master Athemar, wait for a second!" Zheng suddenly descended and tried to stop him from pursuing Tyrese.</p>

  <p>He threw a cold glance at Zheng. "What do you think you're doing?" He couldn't think of any reason for Zheng to stop him.</p>

  <p>Tyrese let out a deep sigh as he noticed that Athemar stopped for a while from pursuing him. As he was about to fly away and escape farther, Elizabeth appeared and landed beside him.</p>

  <p>"Elizabeth! Great timing! I was initially thinking of escaping, but now, I could use your help!" Tyrese let out a wicked smile as he told Elizabeth his plan. He didn't need to run away anymore, and he could get even with Athemar for humiliating him in the earlier battle.</p>

  <p>"Let's go together and kill that bastard!" Tyrese turned into the direction of Athemar and was already prepared to go back. However, Elizabeth ignored him and with a gentle flap of her wings, she had already approached Tyrese.</p>

  <p>As Tyrese's Chaotic Source Spirits had suffered too much fatigue due to the earlier battle with Athemar, it saved her a lot of effort. A dark red light flashed from her fingertips and quickly pierced through Tyrese from his back.</p>
