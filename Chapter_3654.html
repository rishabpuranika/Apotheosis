  <p>
</p>

  <p>The huge Corpse Spirit Jin Wu were controlled by Emperor Di Jun like vicious puppets.</p>

  <p>They intertwined with each other and formed a unique and gigantic maze that eventually trapped Phoenix, Dugan, Micah, and Bagot.</p>

  <p>Leaning against a Corpse Spirit Sun Crow, Luo Zheng turned to Auden and Pearce who were a few meters away, and let out an intriguing smile.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A huge Lofty Sword darted upwards. Sitting on the magnificent blade, Li Bianxue couldn't help but purse her lips as she looked at the pile of Corpse Spirit Jin Wu, with doubt and caution.</p>

  <p>Pearce caught a glimpse of Li Bianxue and then stared back at Luo Zheng, bearing bewildered eyes.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, what is going on?" Auden finally asked.</p>

  <p>It was really absurd from whatever angle it was looked upon. No matter how hard they guessed, there was no telling what was inside Luo Zheng's head at that moment.</p>

  <p>"Elder Pearce, Elder Auden, just trust me. You'll know later," Luo Zheng replied but didn't disclose anything.</p>

  <p>At the same time, blue and green flames suddenly burst out from inside the maze formed by the Corpse Spirit Jin Wu. It turned out that Phoenix and Dugan had taken the initiative to launch the first strike.</p>

  <p>As the flames swirled violently, Micah and Bagot were caught by surprise.</p>

  <p>They couldn't figure out why the loyal Phoenix would dare betray the Jin Wu.</p>

  <p>The flames continued to sizzle from within the maze as Micah and Bagot roared, mightily deflecting the attacks thrown at them.</p>

  <p>Soon after, the Corpse Spirit Jin Wu also spurted out blue flames, boosting the attacks of Phoenix and Dugan. The whole maze was blazing like a tremendous hellfire.</p>

  <p>Micah and Bagot were powerful warriors, only second to Emperor Di Jun in the whole Jin Wu. Their strength was even comparable to that of the leaders of the seven mountains. Even if they were caught off guard by the sneak attack of Phoenix and Dugan, they wouldn't be defeated by them in one go.</p>

  <p>However, if it was Emperor Di Jun himself who dealt with Micah and Bagot, then they wouldn't stand a chance, as he had supreme control over the Corpse Spirit Jin Wu.</p>

  <p>The fierce battle lasted for only about half a minute. Then, the Corpse Spirit Jin Wu forming the maze started to spread out again.</p>

  <p>Phoenix and Dugan finally got out.</p>

  <p>Dugan was unscathed, while half of Phoenix's beautiful face was burnt due to the encounter.</p>

  <p>"Are you all right?" Luo Zheng asked worriedly.</p>

  <p>Phoenix reached out her hand and gently brushed her face. The burned part of her face quickly began recovering. She shook her head and answered, "I'm fine. It was my fault that I was accidentally injured by the flames."</p>

  <p>She didn't have any dissatisfaction since it was the method of Emperor Di Jun that had hurt her. Being killed in his hands would even be an honor for her, so there was no issue whatsoever for receiving a measly injury.</p>

  <p>As for Micah and Bagot, the two were covered with dust and grime as they got out of the encirclement. They were not severely harmed but their faces were contorted in pain.</p>

  <p>Each of them obtained a wound on their chest, where the transformed blood flowed. After the pain was gone, they floated in midair and stared blankly at Luo Zheng. There was an extremely contradictory feeling that rose from within their hearts.</p>

  <p>Buzz?</p>

  <p>Emperor Di Jun's shadow emerged in the sky and once again issued an order to make the two powerful warriors submit to Luo Zheng. Micah and Bagot didn't have a choice, so they lowered their heads as they felt rather conflicted about what was happening.</p>

  <p>Even Pearce and Auden were dumbfounded at the scene.</p>

  <p>They were so shocked that they couldn't think of a logical reason why this was happening.</p>

  <p>They wondered what that shadow above Luo Zheng's head really was.</p>

  <p>It couldn't be a soul fragment of Emperor Di Jun, could it?</p>

  <p>If it was a soul fragment of Emperor Di Jun, it could indeed command the hearts and minds of those who belonged in the Jin Wu like Phoenix and the others.</p>

  <p>But still, the impending question was why would Emperor Di Jun help Luo Zheng and the Taiyi Heaven Palace?</p>

  <p>If he was that kind of person, the war wouldn't have happened in the first place.</p>

  <p>It didn't make any sense for the two old men. They needed an explanation or they wouldn't be able to accept that these were all true.</p>

  <p>"Fascinating?"</p>

  <p>Li Bianxue chuckled as she sat on the Lofty Sword, watching the unfolding scenes.</p>

  <p>Previously, she thought that Luo Zheng had just obtained the Corpse Spirit Jin Wu by sheer luck. However, they were all witnessing that he also made the most powerful warriors of the Jin Wu stand on his side.</p>

  <p>By what it looked, it seemed that Luo Zheng was planning to bring all the members of the Jin Wu to his side.</p>

  <p>The warriors of the Jin Wu present were enough to give the entire Taiyi Heaven Palace an atrocious and tortuous battle. Now, if Luo Zheng really had full control over them, his status would even far surpass that of the mountain leaders, and ultimately be comparable to that of Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>

  <p>One who possessed admirable talent would always have a strong sense of vigilance towards the rise of another domineering talent.</p>

  <p>Therefore, even if Luo Zheng didn't do anything to provoke or offend Li Bianxue, she wouldn't be able to hide her hostility towards him in their first encounter.</p>

  <p>But after only several days, she realized that they were not on the same level. Luo Zheng's ultimate ambition didn't lie in the Land of Sword Grief or the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, can you please tell us now?" Auden asked as cautiously as possible.</p>

  <p>There was definitely no one in the Source World that could make the strong warriors of the Jin Wu fall into absolute submission except for Emperor Di Jun. So they were beginning to wonder if the shadow was the real Emperor Di Jun.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was actually faced with a difficult question that it almost gave him a headache.</p>

  <p>During the fierce battle between the two enormous forces, both sides lost powerful warriors every second.</p>

  <p>He didn't want to see anyone from the Taiyi Heaven Palace or the Jin Wu die. But it was something inevitable in order to attain a much bigger goal.</p>

  <p>Looking at the expression of the two elders, Luo Zheng didn't have a choice but to explain so that they could let this go.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Luo Zheng gave a simple answer, "I used the bloodline of the Jin Wu? and it isn't the real Emperor Di Jun."</p>

  <p>Normally, the elders wouldn't be satisfied with those explanations alone.</p>

  <p>However, they also recognized that the on-going warfare was at the most menacing stage. Since Luo Zheng had come up with such an incredible scheme, they naturally had to seize every opportunity to gain the upper hand.</p>

  <p>In fact, the two elders had the resolve to sacrifice themselves in this war if worst came to worst. But now that they were witnessing a new light of hope, they decided to push aside their doubts for now. The only thing in their minds right at this moment was to survive and win this war in any means possible.</p>

  <p>"I understand your reason if you cannot disclose all information right now.</p>

  <p>Rest assured, no matter what kind of method you are using, Auden and I are at your disposal," Pearce said with a burning passion in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded slightly as he was relieved to finally hear their positive response. At the same time, something caught his attention and he quickly turned towards that scene.</p>

  <p>Seven huge sword shadows madly bombarded a certain member of the Jin Wu. Deafening sounds reverberated like thunderous roars.</p>

  <p>It turned out that the one who blasted out the sword shadows was Qiu Yinhe, and the recipient of his ruthless skill was Tyrese of the Jin Wu.</p>

  <p>Tyrese's strength was categorized at the bottom of the second rank among the royal guards. He presumed that Qiu Yinhe's strength was far weaker than Pearce and Auden. With that, he thought that he could easily defeat Qiu Yinhe in a one-on-one battle.</p>

  <p>However, it never occurred to him that Qiu Yinhe was actually strong enough to be ranked first among the Taiyi Governors.</p>

  <p>The Lofty Swords chased him down vehemently. Tyrese could only curse wildly as he continued to retreat.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>Under the persistent bombardment of the sword shadows, Tyrese's Chaotic Source Spirits had already fallen into severe exhaustion. Fear started to crept all over his face as he hysterically thought on how to successfully escape.</p>

  <p>Qiu Yinhe had a serious look on his face and didn't have the slightest intention of letting him go alive.</p>

  <p>"Master Qiu Yinhe, wait for a second!" Luo Zheng suddenly descended and tried to stop him from pursuing Tyrese.</p>

  <p>He threw a cold glance at Luo Zheng. "What do you think you're doing?" He couldn't think of any reason for Luo Zheng to stop him.</p>

  <p>Tyrese let out a deep sigh as he noticed that Qiu Yinhe stopped for a while from pursuing him. As he was about to fly away and escape farther, Phoenix appeared and landed beside him.</p>

  <p>"Phoenix! Great timing! I was initially thinking of escaping, but now, I could use your help!" Tyrese let out a wicked smile as he told Phoenix his plan. He didn't need to run away anymore, and he could get even with Qiu Yinhe for humiliating him in the earlier battle.</p>

  <p>"Let's go together and kill that bastard!" Tyrese turned into the direction of Qiu Yinhe and was already prepared to go back. However, Phoenix ignored him and with a gentle flap of her wings, she had already approached Tyrese.</p>

  <p>As Tyrese's Chaotic Source Spirits had suffered too much fatigue due to the earlier battle with Qiu Yinhe, it saved her a lot of effort. A dark red light flashed from her fingertips and quickly pierced through Tyrese from his back.</p>
