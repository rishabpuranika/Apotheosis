  <p>
</p>

  <p>Bruno couldn't quell his worries any longer. He finally stood up and announced, "I have to report this to my father. You should go and inform my uncles as well! Nathan, sorry for disturbing you. Please forgive me."</p>

  <p>Nathan replied with a wave of his hand and said, "Never mind! We should pay attention to it. If there is anything I can help with, please let me know as soon as possible."</p>

  <p>Bruno nodded in response and left hurriedly.</p>

  <p>Nathan didn't stay back. He, too, walked out from the side door of the hall.</p>

  <p>As the central divine city of the Bright Night Region, the Bright Night City was not a very big city, but it was quite special.</p>

  <p>Three hundred miles away from the city was a mine, which produced unique stones that could gather light. These stones absorbed sunshine during the day and sparkled brightly at night.</p>

  <p>These mineral resources didn't hold much use to a True God. However, they adorned the divine city like beautiful jewels. Even the rich clans on the Floating Islands would purchase some of them for decoration purposes.</p>

  <p>The streets were all glowing with azure brilliance.</p>

  <p>Nathan had grown steadily in the city. In the past few years, he had already built his own house here.</p>

  <p>On his way home, he suddenly sensed an invisible aura.</p>

  <p>He frowned slightly but continued moving quietly.</p>

  <p>The news about the Bright Moon City was very strange, but Nathan subconsciously believed that the Bright Night City was still safe.</p>

  <p>Anyone who wanted to fight him needed to be at least a consummate True God, but such people didn't have a reason to give him trouble.</p>

  <p>'Am I being nervous unnecessarily?' Nathan thought to himself.</p>

  <p>But as he continued moving ahead, he felt the invisible aura tracing him again.</p>

  <p>The owner of the aura was purposely not disguising it. It was as if that person wanted Nathan to discover it.</p>

  <p>With furrowed brows, Nathan sped up his pace.</p>

  <p>But the problem was that no matter how fast he moved, he couldn't get rid of the aura. Every few seconds, the aura would catch up with him, making its presence felt.</p>

  <p>Finally, Nathan rushed into an empty corner and grabbed his space ring in desperation.</p>

  <p>The slate would be alerted in the divine city if a fight occurred, but it wasn't instantaneous. It required some time to be triggered. So he had to be on full alert.</p>

  <p>Just then, another figure appeared with a flash out of nowhere.</p>

  <p>The mysterious figure's arrival signaled Nathan's space ring to begin flashing light, and half of a green long spear emerged from it.</p>

  <p>However, the stranger forcefully shoved the long spear back into Nathan's space ring with a gentle flick of his hand. At the same time, a voice rang out, "If you want to fight here, the slate will be alerted!"</p>

  <p>Nathan took a closer look at the person and was surprised to discover that it was Luo Zheng. "Long time no see, Nathan!" said Luo Zheng with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng? It's you!" Nathan was too stunned to speak for a while. "How did you manage to find me?" he asked after recovering from the shock.</p>

  <p>To be honest, Nathan wasn't too happy to see Luo Zheng again.</p>

  <p>Although he had let go of the past events that occurred in the Evolutionary Universe, he was reminded of the unhappy memories as soon as he saw Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Still astonished at his sudden appearance, Nathan studied Luo Zheng up and down, and the surprise on his face was getting stronger and stronger. "You, you've already reached the consummation of True God Realm!"</p>

  <p>And he could feel that Luo Zheng was mightier than an ordinary consummate True God!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's aura was very special. Wherever he stood, he seemed to merge with the surrounding scenery. There was no sense of abruptness around him.</p>

  <p>Such a special aura could not be endowed by the power of Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded and said, "It wasn't me who found you; it was my father. He can sense your existence wherever you are."</p>

  <p>"Your father? Do you mean that..." Before Nathan could finish his sentence, another vague figure appeared not too far away from them. It was none other than Mike.</p>

  <p>Mike had disguised his real strength, but, as a Holy Being, he had a special aura around him because of his universe.</p>

  <p>More importantly, Mike was the owner of the Evolutionary Universe, and Nathan was a creature born in that universe. He was awestruck by this connection.</p>

  <p>"I'm honored to see you in person, sir!" Nathan said respectfully, as he cupped his hands.</p>

  <p>While he was in the universe, Nathan had been proud of his family background.</p>

  <p>He was the son of one of the strongest Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>It was not until the end of the war with the Sacred race that Nathan learned about the existence of the divine land, the truth of the war and Luo Zheng's real identity.</p>

  <p>"Come with us. Leave this city as there will be a lot of trouble in this divine city shortly," said Mike.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and Mike had heard the words from the servant of the Cao Clan, outside which they had been hiding.</p>

  <p>"What kind of trouble awaits this city?" Nathan asked worriedly.</p>

  <p>Although Nathan's goal was to become a member of a rich clan above the Time Sea, he had lived in this city for many years and it still held a special place in his heart.</p>

  <p>"It's very difficult to make all the people in a divine city vanish. A consummate True God wouldn't be able to do that. It would have to be at least a Holy Being who can do that," Mike explained flatly.</p>

  <p>"A Holy Being?" Nathan was taken aback, but soon he realized that a Holy Being was already standing right in front of him.</p>

  <p>Mike smiled and continued, "A Holy Being wouldn't be so bored as to slaughter ordinary divine citizens. Even if it was for cultivating some sort of Divine Dao to hone one's killing intent, they wouldn't choose the divine cities in the Bright Night Region. After all, the divine cities here have the protection of the Bai Clan. If they couldn't handle it well, it might cause a skirmish between the powerful clans. The enemy might be even stronger than a Holy Being."</p>

  <p>Mike already had some guesses in his mind.</p>

  <p>He had heard from Lorena that the Yellow Emperor Guards had a secret weapon for which a lot of blood was required to activate.</p>

  <p>Now that the Yellow Emperor Guards were set free, they would definitely use the secret weapon. This could be the reason behind the mysterious disappearance of people in the divine cities. Moreover, the Yellow Emperor Guards were not afraid of provoking the Bai Clan.</p>

  <p>Nathan was even more confused now. "Aren't the Holy Beings the strongest warriors in the divine land? Who can be stronger than a Holy Being?"</p>

  <p>Nathan's range of knowledge was quite different than Luo Zheng's.</p>

  <p>He wasn't aware of the existence of the outside world, nor did he know about the existence of the Other Shore Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>"It's hard to explain this to you. Anyway, we can't fight against such strong enemies at present. So we'd better leave as soon as possible," Luo Zheng urged.</p>

  <p>To his surprise, Nathan thought for a moment before saying, "In that case, can I ask the Cao Clan to evacuate the people in the city? It will be a pity if they all die in vain."</p>

  <p>After living in the divine land for years, Nathan's once arrogant nature had changed.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and Mike exchanged a glance. They were a bit hesitant.</p>

  <p>They would have to collect the Divine Dao all around the divine land and doing so might draw the Yellow Emperor Guards' attention, which was something they wanted to avoid.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps they won't suspect us if the people in the city are evacuated. After all, the Cao Clan is already alerted because of the Bright Moon City, and it's reasonable that they would want to evacuate the city. You'd better do it fast if you want to help them," said Mike.</p>

  <p>The Yellow Emperor Guards could appear any moment and it would be a disaster of epic proportions to encounter them here.</p>
