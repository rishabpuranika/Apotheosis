</p>

  <p>Zheng left on a Heavenly Phoenix Horse.</p>

  <p>This legendary beast that was used for travelling was considered rare even in the Upper World. Naturally, it was gifted to Zheng by Yolande in honor of all Zheng's accomplishments.</p>

  <p>After he had left, Yolande turned around and returned to the depths of her palace.</p>

  <p>On a flight of stairs deep within the hall, there was an obscure and complex divine texture carved into it. As Yolande stepped onto the stairs and activated the divine texture, a black figure began to emerge from the air around her.</p>

  <p>"Father," she called out.</p>

  <p>Yolande's father was Supreme Lord Healum, one of the three great heads of the alliance.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lords were the most supreme entities in the entire universe.</p>

  <p>Even Yolande would not disturb her father easily, unless she had an important matter to discuss with him. Theirs was a formal, but familial bond.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Healum had an indifferent expression. Even when he was facing his own daughter, his tone of voice didn't contain the least bit of emotion. He was consumed by his status, and had left the more mundane emotions, such as love, behind. "Has that brat left?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Yolande nodded absently.</p>

  <p>"I will do everything I can to help you with your plan. However, there are no secrets under the heavens. If you can think of something, then they can think of it as well," said Supreme Lord Healum in warning.</p>

  <p>Yolande smiled sweetly. "Of course, I know that. There are a lot of people who know that Zheng is a man without destiny. So what? What can they do about it? The fate of a man without destiny cannot be deduced or determined. It is a path that no one can estimate. I am only being very careful in pushing Zheng from behind. Who can say for sure about what will happen in the future?"</p>

  <p>"That's true. The most difficult thing for a schemer is to jump out of a rut. Yolande, you're not good at scheming, but this time you are doing great," Supreme Lord Healum complimented, though his tone remained indifferent.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Father, for your appreciation," Yolande smiled sweetly despite the customary cold shoulder which he gave her.</p>

  <p>"However, you still have to be careful. Zheng's luck is truly rare, and the things he is trying to accomplish are not trivial. For example, he wants to help the Demon Night's Queen of Killings regain her throne. That will be extremely difficult. If he were to die on that mission, it would be a pity and a waste."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Father. I understand."</p>

  <p>Her father had always spoken very little. A Supreme Lord was at the stage where they could sever all emotions and attempt to obtain a trace of divinity. He had almost ceased to be human now.</p>

  <p>Because of that, her father had never revealed any emotions since she was born. He was still as cold as ever today, but Yolande was very happy to hear him say so much to her, and he even showed a minuscule trace of concern.</p>

  <p>Ever since she had reported Zheng's news to her father, Healum had shown much interest in Zheng. This was the first time she'd received her father's praise since she'd become a martial artist. Though she had told herself that she didn't need his approval, the validation was nice.</p>

  <p>Traveling on a legendary beast through the passages of the supreme world was quite eye-catching and caused a stir.</p>

  <p>There were countless other practitioners hurrying along within the wide passageway. A trace of envy was revealed on their faces every time they saw Zheng's Heavenly Phoenix Horse. They also silently tried to guess Zheng's identity.</p>

  <p>A martial artist qualified to ride the Heavenly Phoenix Horse was not an ordinary person. They reasoned that he must then be someone of great importance.</p>

  <p>On the way, Zheng formed a preliminary plan for his next step.</p>

  <p>With his current level of strength, he definitely wouldn't be able to help Xun reclaim the throne on his own.</p>

  <p>The good thing was that Xun was not alone in the Upper World. For example, Leroy had been firmly standing behind her, up until now. Aside from Leroy, there were also some of her old subordinates awaiting her to return. She would not face the mission alone.</p>

  <p>In addition to that, Xun had concealed huge amounts of resources.</p>

  <p>She planned to use these resources to help Zheng rapidly increase his strength.</p>

  <p>Once he reached the Soul Sea Realm, Zheng's cultivation rate would increase very slowly, but the resources consumed would be a hundred or even a thousand times more than before. It would be costly to boost Zheng to his full potential.</p>

  <p>This was no longer a matter of talent.</p>

  <p>In the world of warriors, those below the Soul Sea Realm only trained their foundation. However, it was not suitable for them to use all kinds of alchemic resources to make it mature. Otherwise, it would cause their foundation to be unstable and lead to disaster.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Zheng and the other talents had all been relying on their own talents to make breakthroughs in their cultivation, not piling up resources.</p>

  <p>However, after reaching the Soul Sea Realm, the warrior training had more to do with the inner world and it was an advanced training method.</p>

  <p>To open up one's Soul Sea, to expand one's inner world, to induce divine thunder to fill one's body, to nurture a small world within one's Soul Sea</p>

  <p>…</p>

  <p>All these steps needed so much more than one's talent alone.</p>

  <p>The late stage of the Life and Death Realm also featured this. For instance, if an ordinary martial artist didn't have the Tenth Tribulation Introducing Pill, it would be almost impossible for him to attract the tenth small Heavenly Tribulation. Therefore, those kinds of pills were extremely precious and rare in many sacred places; even the martial artists of the thirteen palaces could only rely on their own strength to obtain them in the Passing the Torch.</p>

  <p>A world where the practitioners had to fight over resources was crueler.</p>

  <p>This was also one of the reasons why it was difficult for those who had ascended from the Lower World to rise above others. This was because talent was very important here, but resources were also becoming more and more important. Thus, when Supreme Lord Illusion had ascended to the position of a Supreme Lord, it was considered a miracle.</p>

  <p>Xun knew about the treasures of the Dark World. It could even be said that the origin of the secret treasures was closely related to her. That was why she had asked Zheng to accept the secret treasures when he hesitated and remained on guard. The treasures were the very first stipend of resources she would give him.</p>

  <p>If he were to simply fly at his own speed, it might take dozens of years or even longer for Zheng to cross the vast distances of these supreme worlds.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Phoenix Horse was originally a rare creature in the world.</p>

  <p>With its great speed, in under a month, Zheng had already arrived at the edge of the supreme world occupied by the alliance.</p>

  <p>"The Mind World... the Noble World... the Star Rain World... the Spirit Reading World."</p>

  <p>After crossing the Spirit Reading World, he would reach the Dark World.</p>

  <p>Who would have thought that after shuttling through so many supreme worlds of the Upper World, he would once again return to the Spirit Reading World?</p>

  <p>In the universe, many martial artists, even those at the Soul Sea Realm, were unable to travel through a single supreme world. The distance was simply too great. However, Zheng had traveled through more than a thousand supreme worlds and now had returned.</p>

  <p>He had Xun to thank for that.</p>

  <p>Crossing through a world was time and money-consuming. Crossing a supreme world could nearly exhaust a martial artist's entire life's savings, and it could take several decades. For an ordinary martial artist, such consumption of time and money was simply impossible to bear. It was an unattainable desire for most.</p>

  <p>Zheng, with his Gauze Token and Heavenly Phoenix Horse, naturally had no obstructions on his journey.</p>

  <p>Lincoln had promised to meet up with Zheng in the Dark World in half a year's time. Zheng assumed that Lincoln had to be very resourceful indeed, to make it to the Dark World within half a year. He did not have the Heavenly Phoenix Horse at his disposal like Zheng did.</p>

  <p>Zheng did not plan to stay long in the Spirit Reading World. It was just the supreme world he had ascended to.</p>

  <p>However, as he was flying through the passage, a voice suddenly echoed in his ears. "Zheng, where are you? Can you help me?"</p>

  <p>Hearing that voice, Zheng was slightly stunned. It was Freya's voice!</p>

  <p>Before they had left the mine, Freya and Zheng had exchanged message runes with each other. This was a way to keep in contact over great distances, though it had its limits.</p>

  <p>When he thought about it later, he found it had indeed been a very laughable thing to do.</p>

  <p>The universe was simply too vast. One supreme world was already far beyond their imagination in size. In the Lower World, the most powerful message rune could travel around thirty thousand miles; and though the quality of the message rune that Freya had exchanged with Zheng was even higher, it could only reach sixty thousand miles.</p>

  <p>Sixty thousand miles in the great world was enough to cover a continent, and could even transmit their voices between two continents.</p>

  <p>But in the Upper World, this distance would seem ridiculously short.</p>

  <p>Even when Zheng was in the Enchanted Barrier Tower during Passing the Torch, he had withstood the Law Storm and had rushed over a distance of thirty thousand miles.</p>

  <p>Since this message rune was ringing in his ears, it meant that the distance between him and Freya was within sixty thousand miles. In a supreme world, this distance was very short, almost equal to the distance from his home to the market.</p>

  <p>Zheng wasn't overly familiar with Freya. Back then, in order to leave the mines, the two of them had a mutually beneficial use of each other. It had been because of Zheng that she was able to leave the mines earlier. Of course, what happened afterwards proved that even if Zheng did not mine, there would in any case be people who would take him away.</p>

  <p>'Freya is in trouble?'</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't know when she had burnt her message rune. Perhaps it was several months ago, and that message rune had still been reverberating here. There was no way to tell.</p>

  <p>She had told Zheng that one of her uncles held the position of city lord in the Spiritual Force Sacred Place. Zheng supposed that, given her status, she would be treated better than ordinary warriors who had ascended.</p>

  <p>A hint of hesitation appeared on Zheng's face, but he still lightly patted the Heavenly Phoenix Horse's neck. Following Yolande's instructions on riding the magnificent beast, he stopped the Heavenly Phoenix Horse, and turned around to leave the passageway. Zheng would never leave a friend in need, and he wanted to find out what trouble Freya was in.</p>
