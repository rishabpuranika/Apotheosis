<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Throwing out his long hook, Luo Zheng successfully caught Jeffrey and dragged him to his side.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, he had already charged into the darkness.</p>

  <p>After getting Jeffrey, he immediately got Janet as well, then Hailey, Coleman, and the other two warriors.</p>

  <p>Bam!</p>

  <p>Just as the warriors on Zheng's side were pulled to the other side one after another, a muffled sound rang out from the darkness before a light ball of Illusion Points exploded and flew toward Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The martial artists that managed to enter the Hall of Causality had naturally gathered a great number of Illusion Points. In this round of the attack, Luo Zheng had instantly gotten over a million.</p>

  <p>At this moment, how could Jeffrey, Janet, or the others be willing to fall far behind Luo Zheng?</p>

  <p>By then, Lone had already died and returned to the main city for revival.</p>

  <p>The fact that their leader had been killed was already a cause for discouragement.</p>

  <p>Although the remaining seven weren't completely lacking in strength, their confidence level had naturally dropped to their feet, leaving them in no mood to fight� they posed no threat to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Janet's, Hailey's, and Jeffrey's strength couldn't be underestimated either.</p>

  <p>As lights flashed on the Buddha Curse Blade, the martial artist that employed the Dark Law was also put to death. The darkness that shrouded the area had dissipated and the number of martial artists on the opposing side decreased rapidly. Crumpling like dead leaves, they turned into Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>After Janet absorbed the last person's Illusion Points, everyone's gaze once again fixated on Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Now, it seemed like the third Hall of Causality wasn't too difficult to get through. From the start until then, Janet and the rest hadn't done much.</p>

  <p>Only Hailey had assisted Luo Zheng a great deal.</p>

  <p>But they were all aware that the third Hall of Causality was extremely dangerous� if it weren't for the fact that Luo Zheng had brought Lone down into the river of energy, their group would probably have been annihilated right there. The only reason they could pass through the third Hall of Causality was that they had Luo Zheng with them.</p>

  <p>"Why are you all looking at me?" Luo Zheng asked before turning to the exit of the Hall of Causality where Lone and the other members of his group had entered.</p>

  <p>But Janet pursed her lips and smiled. "That guy seemed unwilling to accept defeat so easily."</p>

  <p>"Who?" Luo Zheng only smiled, pretending to be unaware of who the other was referring to.</p>

  <p>Then, Janet pointed to the river of energy in the deep ravine.</p>

  <p>"I've already offended Lucille," said Luo Zheng. "I don't mind offending one more�"</p>

  <p>Someone like Lone who was considered an ace talent would be able to catch up quickly even after his death. As the game continued in the Illusion Battlefield, the lower-ranked martial artists would constantly get wiped out, leaving the top-ranked martial artists to compete with each other. Sooner or later, Luo Zheng would meet him again.</p>

  <p>"You're right�" Watching Zheng's nonchalant expression, Janet could only laugh helplessly.</p>

  <p>"But it's a pity that his Illusion Points will be wasted," Luo Zheng muttered as he continued staring at the Illusion Points floating above the river.</p>

  <p>Everyone looked at them regretfully.</p>

  <p>After a beat, Hailey walked up to Luo Zheng. Holding the long hook in her hand, she softly suggested, "You can get down there and I'll pull you up with my hook."</p>

  <p>"Hm?" Luo Zheng gave her a look of both surprise and doubt.</p>

  <p>"Trust me. I won't let you fall into the river," she said seriously.</p>

  <p>The hook was long enough to reach someone in an instant and pull the person back. The dots of light holding the Illusion Points were floating about a foot above the river� if someone jumped down there and absorbed them in a flash before getting caught by another warrior's hook, it might just work. So long as both parties cooperated with each other in terms of timing, it wasn't impossible to obtain the Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>But the success of this plan required someone with the ability to control the hook with utmost precision.</p>

  <p>If the warrior threw out the hook even the slightest bit too soon or too late, he or she wouldn't catch the falling warrior. The key to this plan was the one who would throw the hook.</p>

  <p>Trust, then, became a major factor here.</p>

  <p>Having fought in the Hall of Causality together, this group of warriors had established some trust among each other. But that alone wasn't enough to make anyone put their lives into the hands of someone else. If the person on the bank didn't throw out the hook, the warrior who set out for the points would die in vain. Even though no one died in the Illusion Battlefield for real, it was unworthy to lose life like this.</p>

  <p>"I can hit a butterfly from ten miles away. I never miss my target,"</p>

  <p>Hailey added.</p>

  <p>Though she had been rather quiet along the way, at this moment, she spoke confidently.</p>

  <p>"We� We'll use our hooks to help too," Janet said with a smile, seeing Luo Zheng consider the idea.</p>

  <p>"I think it'd be better if only Hailey throws out her hook to drag him back. If two hooks collided, the rules within them would set off each other's power and do more harm than good," Jeffrey offered. Although he was also tempted by the chance to get the Illusion Points, he didn't dare jump close to the river of energy.</p>

  <p>At that point, everyone saw Luo Zheng as their leader, wanting him to guide them further into the Hall of Causality� no one was rooting for his death. Jeffrey was well aware that he was far less important than Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>With furrowed brows, Luo Zheng looked from Hailey to the Illusion Points floating along the river of energy.</p>

  <p>Currently, he had a total of over ten million Illusion Points in his body.</p>

  <p>To Luo Zheng, the number of Illusion Points above this river of energy was by no means small.</p>

  <p>After a moment of thought, he gave Hailey a nod. Ten million Illusion points were definitely worth the risk.</p>

  <p>With that, he walked to the edge of the place with Hailey standing behind him, grabbing the long hook firmly in her hand.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to jump!"</p>

  <p>And he did.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng aimed straight for the Illusion Points above the river.</p>

  <p>Falling rapidly, Luo Zheng soon covered several dozens of feet in distance, soon reaching his target.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Hailey stared firmly at Zheng's movement, keeping watch at the height he was in. After calculating the timing, she threw the long hook in her hand toward the balls of Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>The instant Zheng's figure swept past the points, these ownerless points immediately flew into his body.</p>

  <p>But just as he absorbed the points, he was already less than a foot away from the river of energy below.</p>

  <p>Whoosh�</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the long hook had already reached Zheng's body. With a tug from Hailey, Luo Zheng was saved from the fall. With the hook pulling him back, Zheng's head hung forward, the tip of his nose only inches away from the river.</p>

  <p>If he fell forward even the slightest bit, he would be eroded in an instant.</p>

  <p>While Luo Zheng could withstand the immense power of fire, there was no chance that he could handle the river's erosion.</p>

  <p>Huff, huff�</p>

  <p>When Hailey pulled hard, Zheng's figure began to emerge faster until he returned to the bank.</p>

  <p>As the several martial artists witnessed Luo Zheng return safe and sound, envy grew in their hearts. Although Luo Zheng risked a great deal, he managed to obtain over ten million Illusion Points in an instant� how could they not be jealous?</p>

  <p>"Thank you," Luo Zheng gave Hailey a thoughtful nod.</p>

  <p>"No need to thank me. This is what you deserve," she returned.</p>

  <p>Though Lone wasn't directly killed by Luo Zheng, the latter was still a great factor leading to his death. If it weren't for Luo Zheng, all of them were likely to have been killed off by the swordsman.</p>

  <p>After collecting Lone's Illusion Points, Zheng's ranking soared once again.</p>

  <p>As the martial artists fought around the Illusion Battlefield, they obtained iron tickets from various mystic places, allowing them to enter the Hall of Causality.</p>

  <p>At this stage, everyone's ranking fluctuated dramatically.</p>

  <p>Entering the Hall of Causality cost five million Illusion Points, after all.</p>

  <p>Even the top-ranked martial artists would drop in ranking if they lost tens of thousands of Illusion Points, let alone five million.</p>

  <p>Back when Luo Zheng had paid five million points, his ranking instantly dropped back down to where no one could even pick out his name.</p>

  <p>But as he passed the second Hall of Causality, his ranking rose just as quickly. After absorbing another ten million Illusion Points, he was ranked 23rd in this supreme world.</p>

  <p>In the entire Illusion Battlefield, his rank jumped from the 9, 200th to the 130th.</p>

  <p>The top hundred places were mainly occupied by the ace talents.</p>

  <p>The peak of the pyramid was where the most outstanding beings in the universe stood.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng is definitely not weak�"</p>

  <p>"Who said he was relying on a fairy palace? His strength alone is probably comparable to that of an ace talent!"</p>

  <p>"If this guy works a bit harder, he could probably make it into the top 100!"</p>

  <p>It would seem that Luo Zheng had already garnered most of the Upper World's attention. Back when he was below the ranking of several millionth, they already had their eye on him because of his performance.</p>

  <p>Not long ago, Luo Zheng had broken into the top 10, 000.</p>

  <p>And soon after that, Luo Zheng had already reached the 130th. With such speed, he could probably break into the first hundred soon.</p>
