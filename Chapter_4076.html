  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Wait. What just happened?"</p>

  <p>The Glede Demons standing on the edge of the Ghost Altar were utterly dumbfounded. They couldn't believe their own eyes.</p>

  <p>Bacchus personally handpicked these Glede Demons to join the team. They were regarded as the elites of their race.</p>

  <p>Over the past couple of years, all of them had the opportunity of going onto the Ghost Altar. In fact, they had been there several times already. However, all attempts proved to be unsuccessful.</p>

  <p>Bacchus stood on the edge of the Ghost Altar with his eyes wide in shock.</p>

  <p>His entire body was trembling. This was unbelievable!</p>

  <p>He had a difficult time processing what he had just witnessed.</p>

  <p>It was absolutely surreal!</p>

  <p>All of the Great Ghost Priests had rejected Decker. Naturally, they didn't quite expect that the hatred-level Treacherous Being would be willing to fuse with Decker's Arcana.</p>

  <p>This was preposterous!</p>

  <p>Never in the history of Night View Island had this kind of thing occurred.</p>

  <p>They originally deemed it impossible.</p>

  <p>Bacchus was keenly observing the reactions of the Great Ghost Priests. He noticed that they were undeniably flabbergasted as well. The complication must have originated from the Treacherous Being.</p>

  <p>At that very moment, he felt a sudden desire to take this hatred-level Treacherous Being away.</p>

  <p>Based on his observation, the Treacherous Being had become attracted to only the Arcana. Surely, he wouldn't be interested in a good-for-nothing like Decker.</p>

  <p>But in the end, Bacchus managed to suppress the strong urge to do so. He just kept monitoring the situation and stayed silent.</p>

  <p>He knew that if he enraged the Treacherous Being, he would probably die a horrific and miserable death. He didn't dare to take the risk.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, all he could do was watch the large hedgehog as he merged with the glazed sheet. Soon after, Decker closed it.</p>

  <p>"Is that... Is that it? Is it done?" Fuxi asked aloud while staring wide-eyed at the glazed sheet.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, this was the actual way of fusing with resentment-level and hatred-level Treacherous Beings.</p>

  <p>The Arcana could easily be used to lure the Treacherous Beings. As long as one could do it, fusing with them would be possible.</p>

  <p>Needless to say, this would only be the first step.</p>

  <p>If they wanted the Treacherous Beings to have fighting power and stick with them through life and death, they first had to train these creatures for a long period of time.</p>

  <p>"Does this mean... Does this Treacherous Being belong to me now?"</p>

  <p>Decker looked around and sought answer from the ones present.</p>

  <p>However, no one answered him. The twelve Great Ghost Priests were still completely stunned.</p>

  <p>Out of the blue, one of the Great Ghost Priests shouted. He had a sudden recollection of something he saw before. "I remember now! I know I have seen that hedgehog somewhere before! That is the Ghost Master's pet! Do you remember? Think hard!"</p>

  <p>"You're right! It's Cary! That hedgehog is Cary!"</p>

  <p>"That really is the Ghost Master's pet! How can I forget?"</p>

  <p>All at once, the other Great Ghost Priests were reminded of the same memory.</p>

  <p>There was an enormous painting hanging in the depths of the Ghost Mountain.</p>

  <p>The portrait was of a gigantic monkey. This was the renowned master of the Ghost Mountain.</p>

  <p>The Great Ghost Priests referred to this huge monkey as the "Ghost Master".</p>

  <p>The magnificent painting portrayed the Ghost Master sitting with his legs astride. One of his hands was spread out in front of him. There at his palm laid a little hedgehog.</p>

  <p>They deeply acknowledged the Ghost Master's authority. Naturally, they were afraid of him. Hence, they rarely made attempts to study the portrait carefully. Most of the time, they merely sneaked glances at it.</p>

  <p>They had been quite oblivious to the little hedgehog in the painting.</p>

  <p>Because they didn't pay too much attention to him, they almost forgot about his existence.</p>

  <p>But now, one of them finally remembered it. Quite possibly, all of those stolen glances had gotten him ingrained in his subconscious mind.</p>

  <p>This meant that the hedgehog was not one of the hatred-level Treacherous Beings waiting to be selected on the third floor. Rather, he was the Ghost Master's pet.</p>

  <p>Knowing this, how could they allow Decker to take the hedgehog?</p>

  <p>"Hand over the Treacherous Being at once!" one of the Great Ghost Priests demanded. "We cannot allow you to take him away!"</p>

  <p>At that point, a diamond-shaped glazed sheet suddenly flashed in between the Great Ghost Priest's eyebrows.</p>

  <p>Looked inside, the glazed sheet appeared jet black. It also seemed as though there was a black snake lurking behind it.</p>

  <p>They were now aware that this priest's Treacherous Being was black.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! They heard a sudden rush of air.</p>

  <p>Afterwards, they felt an awfully terrifying aura. It was emanating from the glazed sheet.</p>

  <p>The menacing aura was so strong that it seemed tangible as it loomed all over the entire hall.</p>

  <p>As soon as Decker sensed this aura, he felt thoroughly anxious and terrified.</p>

  <p>The corners of his mouth were trembling from fear. "Of course. I'll release the hedgehog right away," he answered. He had no other choice. This was quite a predicament. He had no intention of angering the Great Ghost Priests.</p>

  <p>"You saw it with your own eyes.</p>

  <p>Even you can tell that I didn't ask the hedgehog to come in.</p>

  <p>He came in by himself," Decker explained as he proceeded to release the hedgehog.</p>

  <p>He hurriedly shook the glazed sheet in an attempt to throw Cary out. His trembling hands did not make this task any easier.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Cary was not under his control yet. He remained motionlessly hidden inside the glazed sheet. Decker was starting to panic now.</p>

  <p>Under the fierce stares of the twelve Great Ghost Priests, he was now being filled with crippling anxiety.</p>

  <p>He even tried to pull the glazed sheet apart. But alas! His strength was still weaker than Cary's so he failed miserably.</p>

  <p>Seeing that the Great Ghost Priests were now looking angry, Decker pleaded, "He refuses to come out. I can't get him out."</p>

  <p>"The solution is plain and simple. Just hand your glazed sheet to me. Now."</p>

  <p>After he spoke, a Great Ghost Priest jumped down and forcefully grabbed Decker's glazed sheet.</p>

  <p>Just as he was about to leave, another Great Ghost Priest intervened,</p>

  <p>"Bainbridge, don't you think it's against the rules for you to take away his glazed sheet like this?"</p>

  <p>The Great Ghost Priests had every right to express their disagreement on the matter. However, they were not allowed to take away the Treacherous Beings and Arcana of others.</p>

  <p>"Well, it's also against the rules for him to fuse with the hatred-level Treacherous Being like this," returned Bainbridge coldly.</p>

  <p>"We will just let the Ghost Face race be the judge of this. Take this fellow with you," the Great Ghost Priest suggested.</p>

  <p>"I have to take him with me?" Bainbridge replied with a frown on his face.</p>

  <p>Normally, anyone who had fused with a hatred-level Treacherous Being would immediately be brought to the third floor of the Ghost Mountain.</p>

  <p>Because the hatred-level Treacherous Beings that appeared on the second floor were merely avatars of the real ones.</p>

  <p>In Bainbridge's opinion, Decker was definitely not qualified to go to the third floor.</p>

  <p>There were strict rules within the Ghost Mountain. Knowing this, he had no other option but to lift Decker up and fly towards the sky.</p>

  <p>"Now that the stone is broken, the Ghost Altar will not be able to select the Great Ghost Priests for a while. Please go back," Bainbridge said as he glanced indifferently at the crowd below.</p>

  <p>When they heard this, Luo Zheng and the others were shocked. What was happening?</p>

  <p>Just like that, Decker would be taken away. There were no other explanations. They didn't even get the chance to negotiate.</p>

  <p>Moreover, there would be no selection of Great Ghost Priests for the time being.</p>

  <p>This meant that they wouldn't meet any human Great Ghost Priest.</p>

  <p>If they went back now, they would definitely encounter the Eye Spirit and his people. They would walk into a dead end.</p>

  <p>"Sirs, I implore you," Luo Zheng said in a loud voice while cupping his hands.</p>

  <p>"We have traveled long to look for the humans in the Ghost Mountain. Can you please help me notify them?"</p>

  <p>Almost simultaneously, all of the Great Ghost Priests focused their attention on Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>In fact, they had already been secretly paying attention to him as soon as they appeared.</p>

  <p>They were instantly able to sense a strange and powerful aura from him.</p>

  <p>Each of them thought that if Luo Zheng were to stand on the Ghost Altar, they would be very happy to let him pass and become a Great Ghost Priest.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng's identity would be the biggest obstacle. He was a human.</p>

  <p>These Great Ghost Priests were on bad terms with the human race. They had poor relationships with them for a long time.</p>

  <p>Bainbridge sneered as he heard Luo Zheng's plea, "Oh, those humans are so lofty and illustrious. There's no way ordinary creatures like us can talk to them."</p>

  <p>It was apparent that his voice dripped with sarcasm.</p>

  <p>The other Great Ghost Priests laughed derisively. They obviously hated the human race very much.</p>

  <p>Just as the Great Ghost Priests were about to enter the space channels, the door was pushed open once more.</p>

  <p>The door was opened by a suit of armor.</p>

  <p>Floating right next to it was an eyeball and an extremely beautiful woman.</p>

  <p>The members of the Red Demon race and the Grand Mighty race were standing behind them.</p>

  <p>The woman was Claire. She looked enchantingly at Luo Zheng. "I have originally taken a liking to a resentment-level Treacherous Being. But since I knew you were waiting here, I came here first."</p>

  <p>As soon as Luo Zheng and his companions realized that it was Claire and the others, they quickly retreated to the other side of the Ghost Altar.</p>

  <p>He didn't expect to be put into the most troublesome situation at the most inconvenient time. Nothing was certainly going as planned.</p>
