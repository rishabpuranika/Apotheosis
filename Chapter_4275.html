  <p>Kincaid stared at Geoffrey and pursued the matter further. "Is the Holy Item the Evil Bead?"</p>

  <p>"The Evil Bead?" Geoffrey grew pensive for a moment and replied, "I'm not certain of that, but it resembled a round piece of metal."</p>

  <p>"Was there anything unusual about her facial features?" Kincaid questioned further.</p>

  <p>"Her facial features..." As he tried to remember all that he had seen, Geoffrey suddenly clapped his hands as he exclaimed, "Now I recall, I think she had frightening eyes, and they were slitted like those of a snake!"</p>

  <p>The snake eyes were the most striking feature of that woman.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing what Geoffrey said, Kincaid suddenly fell silent, while Hilario silently let out a sigh beside him.</p>

  <p>"Dad, who is that woman?" Dorothy asked. She could tell from Kincaid's earlier emotions as well as his sudden silence that he knew without any doubt who the woman was. She wanted to get the answer from him.</p>

  <p>"She's your mother," Kincaid answered in a somewhat bitter voice.</p>

  <p>"My mother?" Dorothy asked in confusion. "If she is my mother, why is she imprisoned in the wall of the chaos?"</p>

  <p>"In the past, her father had defeated us all. I believed she was dead back then. Now, it appears that her father showed mercy to her. Her imprisonment in the wall of the chaos must be her father's punishment,"</p>

  <p>Kincaid slowly explained.</p>

  <p>Dorothy, Zheng, and Geoffrey were all momentarily stunned by his words.</p>

  <p>Zheng was the first to figure it out, and he said, "Is her father the Snake Spirit King, Cornelius?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Kincaid admitted. "She is Cornelius' daughter, Itzel."</p>

  <p>Although the Four Spirits Sect was an entity, the four sects were comprised from different races, and each hailed from their own ancestral lands. Their lifestyles varied greatly from each other.</p>

  <p>Normally, a snake spirit had a large number of offspring, and competition among them was extremely cruel.</p>

  <p>Cornelius was reputed to have hundreds of thousands of children, but most of them had died before they reached adulthood. The cause of their death was mainly the fierce internal family strife, and only those who were strong enough to survive were considered deserving enough to be Cornelius' descendants.</p>

  <p>Compared with his other children, Itzel had led a charmed life.</p>

  <p>In the past, the Bold Conjecture House had required the study of the bloodlines of the four leaders' children. Technically, the leaders only required one of their children to give blood.</p>

  <p>However, the Snake Spirit King had instead sent them an egg.</p>

  <p>After Itzel's hatching, the Bold Conjecture House had wanted to return her, but the Snake Spirit Sect had become indifferent to her fate. They had then allowed the Human Spirit Sect to deal with her as they pleased.</p>

  <p>Following that, Itzel was raised in the Human Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>Compared to her several hundred thousand siblings, Itzel was therefore undoubtedly much luckier. She grew up in a relatively stable environment.</p>

  <p>She performed well there and showed a willingness to accept the human spirits' culture.</p>

  <p>She didn't like her original identity as a snake spirit. Therefore, the Bold Conjecture House had helped her to assume a human body and turned her into a beautiful human spirit.</p>

  <p>The only mark that could prove her original relationship with the snake spirits was the golden crescent-shaped pupils in her attractive eyes, which was a typical feature of snake spirits.</p>

  <p>With the abilities of the Bold Conjecture House, it was a small matter to remove the snake pupils for her. Once those were removed, nobody would know that she was actually a snake spirit. However, she had insisted on keeping her snake pupils as a reminder of where she came from.</p>

  <p>Cornelius had never cared for Itzel, and he had almost forgotten that he actually had a daughter who lived within the Human Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>It wasn't until Kincaid and Itzel fell in love that Cornelius recognized his daughter through her snake pupils. Discovering the truth, he had opposed their relationship vehemently. This was the first breach of trust between the Snake Spirit Sect and the Human Spirit Sect. At that point, Kincaid had given the Snake Spirit King a king's ransom in exchange for his compromise.</p>

  <p>As a result, the Snake Spirit Sect had never mentioned this matter again, and Cornelius had disowned Itzel as his daughter.</p>

  <p>"Her father is the Snake Spirit King… So, my mother is a snake spirit..."</p>

  <p>Dorothy muttered to herself.</p>

  <p>Kincaid stared at her and gently asked, "Does this fact disgust you?"</p>

  <p>In fact, he had questioned Dorothy about this in her previous life.</p>

  <p>However, he wanted to confirm her answer once again.</p>

  <p>"Why? She is my mother, after all. What does that have to do with her identity?" Dorothy observed in confusion. "I think our focus should now be on where my mother is trapped in the chaos and whether we can save her," she added.</p>

  <p>Kincaid flashed a relieved expression at her answer and replied firmly,</p>

  <p>"Of course! We must rescue her."</p>

  <p>Dorothy's positive attitude towards her mother was good news for Kincaid, and he was obviously most satisfied by it.</p>

  <p>Zheng was able to leave the passageway immediately by reciting the Illusion Breaking Rune.</p>

  <p>However, Dorothy and Kincaid were left with no option other than to enter the primitive land through a process of descent.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey's options were even more complicated.</p>

  <p>He had left the chaos through the Deleting Space. Though he had entered the Other Shore, his physical body wasn't in the primitive land, so the Illusion Breaking Rune wouldn't work for him.</p>

  <p>In the end, Geoffrey also chose to return by means of descending, and he landed steadily on the jadeite platform.</p>

  <p>On the staircase reaching up to the jadeite platform, Yudie had been standing there like a sculpture for a long time, and her beautiful eyes were filled with anxiety and uneasiness.</p>

  <p>Even when she saw Zheng open his eyes, she didn't step forward to acknowledge him.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey had been gone for a very long time, and she had missed her son so much. If she still couldn't be reunited with her son at this time, she would pester Zheng until he returned Geoffrey to her.</p>

  <p>To her surprise, Geoffrey soon appeared and landed in the center of the jadeite platform. However, his bulky figure startled everyone present.</p>

  <p>"Geoffrey, how did you become like this?" Yudie stormed up to the jadeite platform and grabbed Geoffrey's burly arm, tears streaming down her cheeks.</p>

  <p>Although she hadn't personally witnessed Geoffrey's journey, she had already imagined it thousands of times in her mind. She feared her son must have experienced all kinds of trials and tribulations on the quest.</p>

  <p>"Mother, I'm well. I have become like this because my body has grown so strong, and I can't find a way to shrink it..." Geoffrey rushed to explain.</p>

  <p>"Really?" Yudie skeptically raised her eyebrow at his explanation.</p>

  <p>"It's true. I bet that nobody throughout the entire chaos could now match me in a melee combat!" Geoffrey confidently assured her. He had grown adept at comforting his mother.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to say you are more powerful than your father now?"</p>

  <p>Given Yudie's current cultivation base, she lacked the ability to determine Geoffrey's real strength, so she turned to look at Zheng for confirmation.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded with a solemn look. "He's right. His body has gained experience and unimaginable strengthening, and even I can't hold a candle to him now."</p>

  <p>After hearing their explanations, Yudie finally smiled through her tears.</p>

  <p>Since her son had returned safely, and his strength had increased to such an extent, her pent-up sadness quickly vanished like mist before the sun of her joy.</p>

  <p>Six hours later, in the center of the primitive land, the Heavenly Ring Staff floated in isolation in the air.</p>

  <p>Thin but long streaks of blood rained down from the blood-red sky and tightly wrapped around the Heavenly Ring Staff.</p>

  <p>After Geoffrey first gained control of the Heavenly Ring Staff, he had tried to infuse his consciousness into it. However, his small wisp of consciousness had disappeared without a trace, and it was immediately devoured by the Heavenly Ring Staff as energy.</p>

  <p>It was not easy to completely subdue the Heavenly Ring Staff, and the task was left to the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>The moment the streaks of blood wrapped around the Heavenly Ring Staff, the ancestry-level bloodline started to notice a massive amount of energy being drawn away by the Heavenly Ring Staff. Zheng also sensed that there was a strong energy flow across the primitive land.</p>

  <p>The ancestry-level bloodline didn't stop the energy supply. Instead, it was willing to offer the Heavenly Ring Staff as much as it wanted.</p>

  <p>Regardless of how much energy it required to activate the staff, it would be satisfied as long as it continued to supply it. As the energy flow fused with and filled the Heavenly Ring Staff, its surface, which looked like a withered branch, began to radiate an aura of life. On the top of the staff some green buds even grew, and these were about to bloom.</p>
