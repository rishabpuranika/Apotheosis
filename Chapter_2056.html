  <p>"Rumbling…"</p>

  <p>Just as the Grand Supreme Lord was about to invite Pranav, the heavens of the Murphy Universe began to tremble violently.</p>

  <p>The waves of vibrations naturally reached the Supreme Lords of the Sacred race, who stiffened in shock.</p>

  <p>It was the first time that the vibrations of the heavens of the Murphy Universe had been that intense. Therefore, it was safe to say that it was a sign that many Supreme Lords died.</p>

  <p>From there, it was easy for the Supreme Lords from the Sacred race to guess what had happened to the Evolutionary Universe, which was right next to the Murphy Universe.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the Sunflower Water World had been destroyed.</p>

  <p>Golden rings of light spread from a huge altar and surrounded the Supreme Lords from the Sacred race.</p>

  <p>At the very top of the altar sat Supreme Lord Denzel, who was doing his best to activate his Heavenly Destiny.</p>

  <p>He looked nothing like the refine Supreme Lord that he was before. Not only was his golden red armor tattered and full of holes, he had also lost an arm.</p>

  <p>He wasn't the only one in bad shape though; the other Supreme Lords from the Sacred race were in far worse conditions.</p>

  <p>Five minutes were all it took for more than half of the Supreme Lords from the Sacred race to be wiped out. There were just twenty-odd of them left, and most of them were very weak as they stubbornly struggled around the altar.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>There was a slight noise as four beams of light shot from the sky.</p>

  <p>Those four light beams turned out to be Margaret's Long Vine Sword, Buddha Emperor Sword, Grant Sun Sword, and Heavenly Tooth Sword!</p>

  <p>Long before Margaret was born, the Celestial Position had already been preparing the Gods Killing Sword Array. Now, it was finally put to use.</p>

  <p>True to its name, the Gods Killing Sword Array could kill even the True Gods. There was no way that the Supreme Lords would survive from it.</p>

  <p>If it had been another day, the Supreme Lords of the Sacred race would have gotten to escape when they had lost in battle because while the sword array formed by the four swords was complex, it would have been impossible to catch the Supreme Lords with Margaret's current skills.</p>

  <p>But because Wynn had performed his Star Sealing Technique, the Supreme Lords of the Sacred race ended up being trapped in the Sunflower Water World. Margaret considered them as living targets. The terrifyingly powerful all-conquering divine swords were ready for use, even if she herself was intimidated by their immense strength.</p>

  <p>It wasn't long before she had killed nine Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>"Those four swords are coming again!"</p>

  <p>"Supreme Lord Denzel! Help!"</p>

  <p>"I'll go block those four swords!"</p>

  <p>The remaining Supreme Lords of the Sacred race scrambled in fear. The four swords were like death itself and every time they appeared, they took the lives of one or two Supreme Lords with them.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, the four swords rushed to the top of the altar but the golden rings of light stopped them before they could reach it.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Margaret sat on top of the warship. Her eyes were icy cold as her fingers danced in the air. In turn, her huge swords flashed with different colored lights and began to attack the golden rings of light.</p>

  <p>"Boom, boom, boom..."</p>

  <p>The universe seemed to quake from the collision of the four great swords against the rings of light. They clashed against the golden rings of light more than ten thousand times in just three seconds!</p>

  <p>And every time they collided, the golden rings of light dimmed a little.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>There was an ear-splitting sound, and the golden rings of light were broken into pieces.</p>

  <p>It was at that exact moment when the four swords entered their scope and two other people suddenly appeared.</p>

  <p>The first one was Zheng, and the other one was Supreme Lord of Oracle.</p>

  <p>Zheng, who had been relying on Supreme Lord Healum's Space Lock, had appeared right behind one of the Supreme Lords from the Sacred race.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lord in front of Zheng was quick to react. As soon as he saw Zheng, he immediately waved the halberd in his hand and stabbed Zheng with it.</p>

  <p>That Supreme Lord had used his Heavenly Destiny to the utmost, so his halberd's attack could pierce through literally anything. However, Zheng did not dodge but instead, slammed his body against the halberd while he swung the Great Weighty Sword in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Causality Breaking Light!"</p>

  <p>A misty beam of light shot out as the causality was severed. After the Supreme Lord had lost the blessing of Heavenly Destiny, his halberd became almost harmless to Zheng. Thus, there was nothing but a crisp noise when the halberd struck his Redemption Armor.</p>

  <p>After he was struck by the blow, Zheng's eyes were already filled with a violent malicious aura. "Gods-intimidating Strike!" he roared.</p>

  <p>"Pfft!"</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lord tried to use his Grand Teleportation technique to escape, but he failed miserably. He could only watch as Zheng's heavy sword swung down on him. The violent sword intent swept across his body and his entire inner world, and left nothing but dust.</p>

  <p>When Supreme Lord of Oracle saw that Zheng had killed that Supreme Lord from the Sacred race, she ran past another Supreme Lord with a dagger in hand. The dagger's blade had slightly cut the Supreme Lord's cheek and left a thin, red mark on his face. She seemed to have done that to provoke the enemy, but not to kill him.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lord from the Sacred race was naturally furious. He waved the great axe in his hand and chased after Supreme Lord of Oracle in anger.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord of Oracle gracefully glided around like a butterfly that shuttled back and forth between flowers. The corners of her lips lifted up into a faint smile as she continued to swim between the rays of the axe light.</p>

  <p>It didn't take long before the wound on the Supreme Lord's cheek began to emit a faded purple light. Then a small cut continued to expand from his cheek all the way to neck, until it had reached every part of his body!</p>

  <p>It was known that after Supreme Lord of Oracle had borne that one Heavenly Destiny, she had cultivated an immensely vicious cultivation method known as the Self-destruction Technique— which was also one of Mike's ultimate techniques.</p>

  <p>Warriors at their level generally didn't fear all kinds of poisons because both their bodies and blood essence had been cultivated to their peak.</p>

  <p>Even if such fatal poisons entered their bodies, they could simply digest and release them.</p>

  <p>While the Self-destruction Technique was another form of poison technique, it wasn't actually a type of poison but rather, an extremely special kind of energy. Any living being who had been even just cut by Supreme Lord of Oracle would undoubtedly die.</p>

  <p>But in such a case, it could be said that Supreme Lord of Oracle didn't technically kill them. What actually happened was the special energy would let the energy within the body destroy itself. The blood essence and life vitality within the cinnabar field would turn against the body as well, and attack it until the living being died.</p>

  <p>It could be considered suicide, and that was why the skill was called the Self-destruction Technique. It was because of that very technique that Supreme Lord of Oracle had been promoted to a top-rank Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>Zheng and Supreme Lord of Oracle quickly killed two Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>They passed by each other and gave each other a glance.</p>

  <p>Zheng was still immersed in the Emotion Closing Godly Way, and his gaze was merciless, while Supreme Lord of Oracle's eyes contained a hint of a smile and admiration. After that, the two of them simultaneously stepped into a space crack and escaped.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord of Oracle executed the Grand Teleportation technique, while Supreme Lord Healum pulled Zheng back.</p>

  <p>Aside from the two of them, Supreme Lord of Original Sin and Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment had also killed two Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>Just then, Supreme Lord Denzel clapped his hands together as he stood on the altar. The life vitality in his inner world gushed into the altar like the sea, and the other Supreme Lords near him did the same. The inner worlds they had worked so hard to build had collapsed, and the creatures in them had dissolved.</p>

  <p>Their group of Supreme Lords came to the Evolutionary Universe together, but they had failed to form a powerful array. It was because the elites of their kind had stayed in the Murphy Universe and they were the only ones who were here. It was also why they were at a disadvantage when they fought against the Supreme Lords of the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Supreme Lord Denzel's Heavenly Destiny was extremely powerful, and he could hold on with his back against the altar. If it wasn't for this altar, all of the Supreme Lords would have perished by now.</p>

  <p>Several of them combined their efforts and poured massive amounts of life vitality into the altar. Another creature crawled out of the altar, which turned out to be a small golden monkey. The golden monkey flew towards the sky, and then a golden light shone in all directions.</p>

  <p>The golden light was as sharp as knives as it scattered in all directions at an extremely fast speed.</p>

  <p>The golden light had killed two Supreme Lords from the Celestial Position and the Humanity Alliance before, but it was useless to do the same as of the moment since the Supreme Lords from the Evolutionary Universe had escaped already. Thus, the golden light hit nothing but air.</p>

  <p>After the golden light scattered, it condensed into a golden ring of light once again and wrapped around the entire altar, which gave the Supreme Lords from the Sacred race some breathing room.</p>

  <p>However, Margaret directed her four divine swords, the Long Vine Sword, the Buddha Emperor Sword, the Grant Sun Sword, and the Heavenly Tooth Sword to appear outside the ring of light.</p>

  <p>When Supreme Lord Denzel saw those four swords again, he couldn't help the despair that flooded his heart.</p>
