<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's long sword blocked Sandy's two sharp blades. The sword drew back and immediately twisted towards her neck.</p>

  <p>Fear crept up in Sandy's face. She never expected that Zheng could block her attack with a weapon that was made of common iron.</p>

  <p>It was impossible for such a weapon to dodge her attack just like that.</p>

  <p>The only thing that could've possibly allowed him to do that was the green light wrapped around it. 'How could he utilize that kind of power?' she wondered.</p>

  <p>This unknown skill surprised her to a great extent. She knew she wasn't Zheng's match. How else was she going to deal with him?</p>

  <p>The power of Zheng's sword that was coming straight for her meant death.</p>

  <p>Sandy had no other choice but to retreat. In the end, she managed to avoid the sword, but she lost her balance and fell straight on the ground.</p>

  <p>Just as she struggled to get back on her feet, Zheng's long sword was already pointed on her snow-white neck, while the green light around it had disappeared.</p>

  <p>"Don't move, or I'll cut your neck," Zheng said with a sly smile on his face.</p>

  <p>"Don't ask me how I did it either."</p>

  <p>Sandy could only glare at Zheng, her chest heaving, and her thoughts wavering.</p>

  <p>She finally understood why Spark was unable to stop those intruders.</p>

  <p>Under the effect of the Strength Equalizing Theurgy, only the Warden race was able to break the restrictions of the theurgy. Sandy's double blades were grace from the master.</p>

  <p>But Zheng seemed to have also broken the restrictions of the Strength Equalizing Theurgy.</p>

  <p>She didn't have time to think about how he did it first. If these people could all break through the restrictions, it meant Spark's men weren't their enemies.</p>

  <p>Even if the Warden race and Spark had planned it for a long time, the people they sent out to attack would not return.</p>

  <p>From a distance, a bunch of rapid, disorderly footsteps could be heard along with some murmurs of curse words.</p>

  <p>"Damn it! Spark sure is quick!"</p>

  <p>"I wonder if Zheng has caught up with that woman. If we can catch her, things would be a lot easier!"</p>

  <p>"I'm a little worried about Zheng's safety."</p>

  <p>Beneath the city wall, Zheng had had a brief talk with Emily and others.</p>

  <p>The situation was clear. Spark and the others with him were no longer a threat to them. All they had to face was the Warden race -- their real enemy.</p>

  <p>There was a saying that went, "Know the enemy as you know yourself."</p>

  <p>At that time, no one had any idea how to deal with their nemesis.</p>

  <p>Although Zelda knew a little about the Warden race, it just wasn't enough.</p>

  <p>The Warden race sent Sandy in hopes to convince Emily, along with the entire Snake Goddess race, to surrender.</p>

  <p>If they caught that woman and forced her to tell them the secrets about the Warden race, they could be at an advantage.</p>

  <p>So, Timotheus led several people to go after Spark, while Zheng took the initiative to chase after Sandy.</p>

  <p>However, under the cover of several exiles, Spark had escaped successfully. That was why everyone rushed back.</p>

  <p>They didn't think Zheng would actually catch the woman. After all, they knew that the Warden race wasn't so easy to be up against.</p>

  <p>Surprisingly, just as soon as they crossed the street, they noticed Zheng pressing his long sword on the skin of Sandy's neck.</p>

  <p>Emily raised her eyebrows slightly. She knew she was right.</p>

  <p>She had long suspected that Zheng had some extremely powerful methods that he just never showed.</p>

  <p>That was the exact reason why Emily trusted Zheng to chase the woman by himself.</p>

  <p>It didn't matter much if Zheng wasn't able to catch her.</p>

  <p>But as expected, Zheng had once again delivered.</p>

  <p>"Got her! Ha!" One of the exiles couldn't help but laugh.</p>

  <p>Seeing this scene, the others began to ponder about the events that had occurred along the way. They always thought of Zheng as someone outrageous.</p>

  <p>After all, it was Zheng who helped all the people get through in the end.</p>

  <p>They all felt lucky and grateful that they had Zheng at that moment. If it wasn't for him, Emily might also have the ability to bring them here, but more people would've died.</p>

  <p>Sandy leaned on the ground. Upon seeing Zelda among the crowd with a smile on her face, she whispered, "For the sake of my master... You bugs.</p>

  <p>You keep dreaming to leave this world."</p>

  <p>A determined look replaced the anger on her face.</p>

  <p>Immediately, she hit herself against Zheng's long sword.</p>

  <p>Zheng was quick to act. With a slight shake of his sword, only the blunt side of it hit Sandy's skin, which left a straight blood mark on her neck.</p>

  <p>But if Zheng didn't kill her, she had ways to force him to do so.</p>

  <p>Since she was already in between life and death, she didn't have any more qualms. Some sort of blue textures had appeared on her arms, and the two sharp blades had condensed again. She brandished her weapons and pulled Zheng into an embrace.</p>

  <p>"If you don't kill me, then let's die together!" Strange lights flashed in her eyes.</p>

  <p>The two sharp blades were too close to Zheng. He had no other choice.</p>

  <p>He frowned, then reluctantly moved forward with his sword.</p>

  <p>The bright silver sword penetrated her chest.</p>

  <p>Despite so, Sandy managed to push her two sharp blades forward. Before they could even touch his skin, Zheng had already nailed her to the ground.</p>

  <p>The two sharp blades gleamed with blue light for the last time before they broke into pieces.</p>

  <p>The people who were able to see everything froze in their tracks. They never expected such a thing to happen. The smiles on their faces faded away.</p>

  <p>"Splash!"</p>

  <p>Zheng pulled out the sword from her swelling chest, and blood immediately gushed out. His face was filled with regret.</p>

  <p>"I didn't expect her to be so tenacious," said Emily, pursing her thin lips.</p>

  <p>"She wanted to die. I had no choice," Zheng replied, with a hint of helplessness in his voice.</p>

  <p>"You did well," Emily reassured.</p>

  <p>An exile from the Fire Melting race nodded in agreement. "Yes. Now, we have finally killed a member of the Warden race."</p>

  <p>The way this group of exiles talked to Zheng changed. Before, they were condescending towards him, but at that moment, they treated him as an equal.</p>

  <p>Emily bent down to study the textures that had appeared on Sandy's arms. "Zelda, are these razor blades bestowed upon her by the Chaos Ancient God?"</p>

  <p>Stepping forward, Zelda was a little shocked by what she had seen. After all, the woman who had died right before her very eyes was a member of the Warden race, and they shared the same bloodline.</p>

  <p>However, when she remembered the time when her family was killed, her heart grew cold again. "Yes," she replied. "After the Strength Equalizing Theurgy has been activated, the master of our race will grant us grace to help us get rid of the limitations of such theurgy."</p>

  <p>"The grace for every one is the ability to condense a pair of sharp blades?" Zheng asked, still fixated on Sandy's corpse.</p>

  <p>If that was the case, then things would become easier.</p>

  <p>Those blades were sharp indeed, but the Warden race weren't as difficult to deal with as they thought they would be.</p>

  <p>"No, it isn't," Zelda shook her head. She knew why Zheng was asking such a question. "Everyone's grace is different. Some are strong, and some are weak."</p>
