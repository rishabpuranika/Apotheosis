  <p>
</p>

  <p>As Zheng released the Eight Smoky Melodies, his entire body tumbled backwards!</p>

  <p>The Crescent Blade left a bloody scar several inches long on Zheng's face in almost the same instant that the barrier of the Eight Smoky Melodies threw him backwards!</p>

  <p>The tumble motion was Zheng's sharp reaction to the impending crisis, and it was this movement that had saved him from calamity.</p>

  <p>If he hadn't thrown himself backwards, Lucille's attack would have crushed Zheng's head with that Crescent Blade.</p>

  <p>Huff! Huff!</p>

  <p>Both of them had flipped in the air! Lucille was repelled backwards by the smoky barrier which Zheng had created.</p>

  <p>When Lucille saw that she did not manage to do anything other than scratch him with her formidable attack, she coldly snorted. With a sweep of her golden wind, her figure disappeared again. She appeared again and assumed a station another hundred feet from Zheng, and stood on the top of the Magnetic Sacred Mountain!</p>

  <p>'This guy's reaction is really fast...' she thought, secretly impressed.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of the bystanders, Lucille had launched an attack right after she had recovered. It could be said that she seemed to be in a hurry!</p>

  <p>However, she knew very well that, whether it was its timing or angle, this move had already reached its limits, and she still had not managed to do more than give Zheng a close shave! She hadn't expected that Zheng would still have been able to dodge the sudden attack which all of her other opponents had been unable to defend against in time.</p>

  <p>As for Zheng, he was quite speechless as he looked at the small embroidered shoes on Lucille's feet and the Crescent Blade concealed under them. Gingerly, he wiped away some of the blood which was trickling from the cut along his face. Zheng was not overly concerned by this superficial injury as his body would heal swiftly.</p>

  <p>'This woman has so many tricks up her sleeve!</p>

  <p>Even something as mundane as a pair of embroidered shoes could hide such a cold killing intent!</p>

  <p>Are all the female cultivators in the Upper World talented like this?' he wondered, still somewhat surprised. Lucille was like this, so was Layla.</p>

  <p>They used all sorts of methods, and every single one of their methods could have become a great killing tool in the hands of any normal warrior. To these female cultivators it seemed that these methods were mere tinkering and not their only means of attack. Zheng wondered darkly what else was still in store for him!</p>

  <p>While he was left feeling helpless, Lucille, who was standing on top of the Magnetic Sacred Mountain, was shining with the golden light again!</p>

  <p>Zheng knew by now what that meant.</p>

  <p>"Here it comes again," he muttered warily.</p>

  <p>Zheng turned over again in the air, at the same time, he drew out his chaotic energy and circulated his cultivation method. The amount of white fog that condensed on the surface of Zheng's body had also increased. He was fully surrounded by a dense fog screen which made it difficult to determine his exact location.</p>

  <p>Even though Zheng had activated the Eight Smoky Melodies to its limit, her Crescent Blade was still a bit faster. As she kicked out like a lightning strike, her weapon easily passed that three-inch distance and was once again slicing towards Zheng!</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>This time, Zheng was still unable to completely dodge Lucille's kick, and the Crescent Blade instantly cut into the flesh of his upper arm!</p>

  <p>'Now is the time!' Zheng shouted in his heart.</p>

  <p>He already knew that he could not keep dodging. He resolutely twisted his body to use his left arm to block. The moment his arm was cut, his right hand reached out swiftly to grab Lucille's foot.</p>

  <p>If binding and killing this woman at the cost of only one arm was Zheng's chance to win, then he would accept it gladly!</p>

  <p>However, just his fingers touched Lucille's instep and, before he could grab her, a golden light flashed and he felt his fingers close on nothing but air!</p>

  <p>Lucille's figure once again disappeared from in front of Zheng, returning to appear on her vantage point on the top of the Magnetic Sacred Mountain.</p>

  <p>Although her attack had succeeded, her face was a bit unnatural and strained now. Her foot was almost grabbed by Zheng! Never in all her time in the Illusion Battlefield had this happened.</p>

  <p>That unnatural expression only remained on her face for an instant, but Zheng identified it as fear.</p>

  <p>The golden wind roared and she once again attacked Zheng without the slightest hesitation or warning!</p>

  <p>She knew that with her incredible speed, it was impossible for Zheng to catch her. As long as she could maintain this status quo, he would definitely lose to her. Therefore, she wasn't willing to give Zheng the slightest bit of time to prepare a strategy to deal with her!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>Every time Lucille advanced and appeared, a deep bloody gash would appear on Zheng's body! The evidence of her proficiency abounded and Zheng was soon crisscrossed with bloody cuts.</p>

  <p>The problem Zheng was facing right now was almost the same as the situation when he had dealt with the Celestial Mice. Though both the Celestial Mice and Lucille were gifted with exceptional speed, those Celestial Mice had been stupid, and they didn't deal as much damage to him as Lucille had already done.</p>

  <p>It was obviously impossible to also trap Lucille with Heavenly Tribulation as Zheng had done with the Celestial Mice! She was so much more powerful than that already.</p>

  <p>While Zheng was being attacked by Lucille, his mind was also working hard. He knew that if he couldn't break out of this situation, he would lose sooner or later!</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>Streams of blood sprayed out again, as Lucille kept advancing her swift attacks and then retreating again.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha, Lucille becomes really serious now. Look, her attacks are as smooth as flowing water, one after one. She doesn't allow her opponent a chance to catch his breath!"</p>

  <p>"With her strength and speed, I'm afraid that she could easily kill a warrior at the middle stage of the Spirit Supreme Realm."</p>

  <p>"Like I said, an ace talent is an ace talent. How could this guy hope to defeat her? What's more, Lucille has only displayed half of her power so far, right? I heard that Lucy has also entered the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>Lucille has actually entered the Illusion Battlefield under two identities at the same time! She must have divided herself to be able to achieve that feat. But I wonder if she will become one with Lucy in the later battles?"</p>
