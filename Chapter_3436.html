<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng moved close to the blue lights. "Couldn't you release me first?"</p>

  <p>As he said it, he motioned to the blue lights and then to the area outside.</p>

  <p>Since he couldn't speak the monsters' tongue, he could only rely on the sign language.</p>

  <p>He wasn't sure if the little monster with a golden ring actually understood him, but after a while, it did take the other little monsters away. Luo Zheng was left in the cage, helpless. The little monster that had been accompanying him felt the same way.</p>

  <p>After about eight hours, some little monsters brought him food. They didn't know he didn't need to eat anything, so they thought that he had to eat just like they did.</p>

  <p>The raw meat appeared cut from carcasses. It didn't appeal to Luo Zheng at all.</p>

  <p>He glanced at the meat, completely uninterested in eating it. Seeing the little monster beside him looking on eagerly, he threw the meat toward it.</p>

  <p>The little monster's eye was filled with excitement and gratitude as it wolfed down the meat.</p>

  <p>'The blue light these little monsters shoot out from their eyes is powerful enough to hurt me directly. This means the light has a very high level of energy. Why, then, do they need to eat all this meat?' Luo Zheng thought, looking at the little monster.</p>

  <p>It was impossible for Luo Zheng to be hurt by the energy at the same level as the internal momentum of the Divine Dao unless it was the Ways-blending Energy.</p>

  <p>The creatures that acquired the internal momentum of the Divine Dao had already reached the True God Realm. To use that kind of token, what they consumed was the spiritual energy of heaven and earth.</p>

  <p>Those at the Other Shore Realm, meanwhile, had to absorb divine crystals to replenish their Other Shore Power.</p>

  <p>The energy that meat could replenish was simply negligible and wasn't worth much. It was the crudest and least effective way of acquiring energy.</p>

  <p>The little monsters couldn't release the terrifying blue light just from eating meat alone. It made no sense.</p>

  <p>Moreover, this space had existed for who knew how many years. All carcasses should have already been dug out by these little monsters long ago. But they obviously were still able to obtain the fresh remains of small animals. This was also very strange.</p>

  <p>It was only after two days that the little monsters finally made their move.</p>

  <p>All the little monsters from the city ruins gathered in this area in neat formations.</p>

  <p>The little monster with a golden ring stood above the others, shrieking in a high pitched voice. The little monsters below responded in unison with the same sound from time to time.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng couldn't understand what was being said, but he guessed that this was some kind of show of force.</p>

  <p>It seemed like a rally before a battle or a major mass action.</p>

  <p>What did the little monsters want to do?</p>

  <p>After a while, the strongest little monsters came over to Luo Zheng and lifted the metal cage. It seemed they were going to transport Luo Zheng to another place.</p>

  <p>However, just as they were about to set off, some red dots appeared in the horizon.</p>

  <p>The red dots approached so fast that they flew across the ruins in the blink of an eye. As they came closer, Luo Zheng was finally able to make out what they were: double-headed flying snakes.</p>

  <p>The moment the red snakes appeared, all the little monsters' auras changed.</p>

  <p>Their eyes flashed with hatred. Blue lights shone in their eyes.</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish! Swish!</p>

  <p>Dense blue lights shot upward.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was deeply shocked at the sight.</p>

  <p>Since Grand Teleportation was prohibited, even the powerful men of the Chaotic Source Realm and the warriors like Qiu Yinhe, let alone Luo Zheng, wouldn't be able to escape an attack like that.</p>

  <p>But the double-headed flying snakes seemed unfazed by it. They opened their mouths wide and spat out blood-red bubbles.</p>

  <p>The bubbles moved at a very high speed. When they made contact with the blue lights, the two would counteract and disappear together in a flash. But more blood red bubbles evaded the lights, raining down over the ruins below.</p>

  <p>A red bubble exploded near Luo Zheng. Traces of blood-red energy spread like lightning, forming a sphere of force ten feet wide.</p>

  <p>Everything enclosed in the ball melted completely.</p>

  <p>"These double-headed snakes have terrifying energy as well," Luo Zheng muttered to himself. He looked at the ensuing crater as his eyelid twitched.</p>

  <p>More red bubbles fell to the ground, riddling the city ruins with more craters. The blue lights were able to take down some double-headed flying snakes, however. There was no surviving such a hit.</p>

  <p>The hatred between these two races was extremely strong. Each and every one of their encounters led to a fight to the death.</p>

  <p>"Geo...geo... geo..."</p>

  <p>The little monster with a golden ring screamed something in Luo Zheng's direction. At this, the little monsters below the metal plate carried the cage and fled from the battlefield, apparently scrambling to secure Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>They hadn't gone far, however, when the double-headed flying snakes in the sky changed direction and started going after them.</p>

  <p>Now Luo Zheng understood what was going on.</p>

  <p>It seemed that not only the little monsters but also the double-headed flying snakes were interested in him. They came here for him.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The little monsters carried Luo Zheng through the ruins, while the double-headed flying snakes chased after them relentlessly, intent on taking their captive away.</p>

  <p>There were always numerous casualties in this kind of battle.</p>

  <p>But it seemed both parties were careful not to harm Luo Zheng in the crossfire.</p>

  <p>The bubbles from the double-headed flying snakes and the blue lights from the little monsters all avoided the cage in which Luo Zheng was imprisoned.</p>

  <p>The intense battle continued for a while. The little monsters carried Luo Zheng all throughout their retreat, fleeing into another ruin.</p>

  <p>As they arrived at one of the ruined structures, Luo Zheng's eyes lit up at what he saw ahead.</p>

  <p>There was a small yellowish brown star floating at the edge.</p>

  <p>The star, measuring over ten thousand feet across, was valuable. Luo Zheng was surprised to see a huge statue of a human standing on top of it.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had thought he was the first human that had been exiled to this place. It seemed that he was wrong.</p>

  <p>It would appear that the human race had come here many years ago.</p>

  <p>However, judging from what remained in this place, many civilizations had gone by. When had this statue been built?</p>

  <p>While Luo Zheng puzzled over it, the little monsters carrying him jumped onto the small star.</p>
