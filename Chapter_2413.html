  <p>
</p>

  <p>Looking at the True God's behavior, all the other True Gods present around burst into laughter.</p>

  <p>He was thoroughly embarrassed, when he saw their reaction. Glaring at them, he quickly walked away.</p>

  <p>He waited for a long time, but in the end, he took only a step forward. At this rate, no one would ever be happy.</p>

  <p>Zheng's gaze was fixed at the array made of long swords on the ground. He looked at it for a while, but did not find anything special about it.</p>

  <p>He knew that the debate over the Godly Ways in the Sword Clan must have something to do with the Truth of Godly Way. But when he looked at the exhibition of the swords, he didn't feel any Truth of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>After the first True God left in a haste, another young man appeared in front of the line.</p>

  <p>The young man was wearing a purple and golden robe with works of embroidery. Across his waist, there was a beast identification tag. Zheng guessed the tag must be some sort of identification mark of a powerful clan.</p>

  <p>He waved at the three white robed True Gods with pure disdain. "Is it my turn?" he asked in an indifferent tone.</p>

  <p>"Please step forward."</p>

  <p>One of the three men waved his hand.</p>

  <p>The young man proudly sauntered forward. The moment he stepped into the array, the long swords began to vibrate again.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, most of the confident people possessed real skills.</p>

  <p>It was evident that the young man's performance was far better than the earlier True God. He took a step forward, closed his eyes and walked back and forth in the array, as if he was casually wandering.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>He had hardly taken a couple of steps when one of the long swords floated upwards and slowly flew towards him.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Zheng instantly felt a unique aura emanate from that sword.</p>

  <p>"What is it about the aura? It is definitely getting stronger."</p>

  <p>Zheng wondered as he raised his eyebrows slightly.</p>

  <p>Ever since the time he entered the Non-combat Zone, he had been constantly oppressed by an irresistible aura.</p>

  <p>According to Hallet, this aura should be the Truth of Godly Way from the skeleton on the Sunrest Tree.</p>

  <p>If the Sword Clan wanted to conduct a test, they would choose to use the Truth of Godly Way. But till now, Zheng hadn't seen any clues.</p>

  <p>As soon as the sword floated up, Zheng felt that the original Truth of Godly Way that emitted from the array of swords had become stronger. Now he was dead sure about it.</p>

  <p>"So the test is about the understanding of the Truth of Godly Way!" Zheng was astonished with this revelation.</p>

  <p>As far as he knew, the Truth of Godly Way couldn't be reached by any ordinary True Gods. Only a few disciples of the powerful clans on the Floating Islands had the eligibility to reach the Truth of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>Hayden was slightly stunned hearing Zheng's words. He excitedly looked at Zheng as he asked, "You've heard of the Truth of Godly Way?"</p>

  <p>Many True Gods intently studied Sanskrit words in the divine land because the Sanskrit words could be seen everywhere. They all assumed that by finding some clues from the Sanskrit words, their fortunes would change overnight, or they might be put in important positions.</p>

  <p>But the vast majority of them didn't know that the True Gods and even the Holy Beings in the powerful clans were only concerned about a very small number of the golden Sanskrit words that recorded the Truth of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>The ordinary True Gods didn't know what Truth of Godly Way was, nor could they imagine what the world looked like at the end of the Godly Ways. Hence for the True Gods, the so-called debate over the Godly Ways had become a great event about Sanskrit words.</p>

  <p>"Yes." Zheng nodded as he continued to stare at the array.</p>

  <p>"These True Gods have no idea of the Truth of Godly Way. The reality is that we, the Sword Clan, use those Truth Spiritual Swords only to test the alignment between True Gods and the truth," Hayden said as he shook his head.</p>

  <p>"The Truth Spiritual Swords?" Zheng looked at those long swords, and his eyes flickered slightly. When one of them floated up, he realized that it was truly extraordinary.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Earlier, all of these Truth Spiritual Swords used to be supreme primordial weapons," said Hayden. "However, after we forged these supreme primordial weapons, we didn't completely condense the primordial energy in them. Instead, we put them into the core of the Sunrest Tree for many divine eras."</p>

  <p>The Truth Spiritual Swords weren't a secret in the Sword Clan. Everyone was aware of them. After all, only the Sword Clan could make such kind of spiritual swords. So naturally, Hayden did not feel the need to withhold any information from Zheng.</p>

  <p>The Truth Spiritual Swords absorbed the Truth of Godly Way that came out from the skeleton through several divine eras.</p>

  <p>After being dealt with the secret techniques of the Sword Clan, the Truth Spiritual Swords would be able to sense the alignment between ordinary martial artists and the Truth of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>If one could drive at least three Truth Spiritual Swords to float up, they would be qualified to open the west gate and climb to the Sunrest Tree.</p>

  <p>"That's why even if a person can drive the Truth Spiritual Swords, it doesn't mean that they have the ability to comprehend the Truth of Godly Way. It's only a test of alignment," Hayden said with a laugh. "The test of the understanding of the Truth of Godly Way is difficult even for the disciples of the powerful clans on the Floating Islands. How can it be conducted for these True Gods?"</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded. He was beginning to get the picture.</p>

  <p>If any True God could get the Truth of Godly Way, then where was the challenge to surpass the Godly Ways?</p>

  <p>At that moment, another Truth Spiritual Sword floated in the sword array and its tip was pointed at the young man.</p>

  <p>"There are two Truth Spiritual Swords now," Hayden said as a matter of fact. "Looks like he will be able to climb onto the Sunrest Tree."</p>

  <p>Just as what Hayden had expected, two more Truth Spiritual Swords floated up. The four Truth Spiritual Swords circled around the young man slowly, following him until he passed the path in the middle of the array.</p>

  <p>"Excellent!"</p>

  <p>"Rufus, the eldest son of the Wang Clan, successfully passed the test!"</p>

  <p>"I really admire his talents and his confidence! He will definitely be able to mount the Sunrest Tree."</p>

  <p>"Congratulations!"</p>

  <p>Rufus turned his head grandly, as he soaked in the admiration. Although his eyes were full of excitement, he tried his best to look casual about his achievement. With a faint curve forming at the corners of his mouth, he said, "Brother, as we have agreed, if I pass the test, everyone will be rewarded."</p>

  <p>It turned out that the True God who stood at the front of the line was Rufus's brother, Rudolf. Upon hearing Rufus's words, Rudolf smiled, turned around and said, "And I will fulfill that agreement!" Saying this, he flapped his waist, and the divine might coins were hurled towards the group.</p>

  <p>"Wow! What rewards!" "Definitely the Wang Clan is mighty rich!"</p>

  <p>"There are so many divine might coins!"</p>

  <p>Everyone was scrambling and shoving among themselves to get the maximum coins.</p>

  <p>Rudolf continued to hurl the coins towards the True Gods. Within a short time, he had already distributed three to four hundred divine might coins.</p>

  <p>"The two members of the Wang Clan are really generous." Hayden looked at them with complete disdain.</p>

  <p>The Wang Clan was a first-tier clan in the Sunrest Tree Region and was a powerful clan attached to the Sword Clan.</p>

  <p>Rufus and Rudolf were from the direct line of the Wang Clan, so they naturally inherited vast fortunes.</p>

  <p>They did not want to wait in line to participate in the debate over the Godly Ways. They had spent a large sum of divine might coins, so they claimed the first two seats in the queue.</p>

  <p>Now that Rufus had passed the test, they began celebrating by distributing the divine might coins.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Zheng just smiled and then asked, "At what level are the True Gods if they can drive four Truth Spiritual Swords?"</p>

  <p>"What level? They just barely scrape through the test," Hayden said in a disdainful tone. "There are totally 23 Truth Spiritual Swords in this array. I could drive six of them when I was thirteen, and I've already driven nine this year. Come with me."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, Hayden led Zheng towards the array.</p>

  <p>After Rudolf distributed the divine might coins, it was his turn to take the test.</p>

  <p>"Rudolf, if you pass the test, you should also celebrate by distributing divine might coins!"</p>

  <p>"Rudolf, you will surely pass the test!"</p>

  <p>The True Gods all began to shower their flattery on Rudolf, with the hope that they would get more divine might coins.</p>

  <p>Rudolf grinned back at them saying, "Sure, no problem!"</p>

  <p>However, as he walked towards the array, Hayden walked past him and stood in front of him. He said indifferently, "A distinguished guest wants to take the test first. Wait till he finishes!"</p>

  <p>"A distinguished guest? What do you mean by that?"</p>

  <p>Stunned, Rudolf glanced at Zheng who was standing behind Hayden. Then he knew who the distinguished guest was.</p>

  <p>Both of the brothers stood there, sulking at the sudden turn of the event.</p>

  <p>Staring at Hayden, Rudolf said, "We spent a lot of divine might coins in getting the first two seats. Even if you are a member of the Sword Clan, you just cannot allow someone to randomly jump the queue!"</p>
