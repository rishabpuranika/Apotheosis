<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Mu Ning stared at the barrier in a daze as she floated outside of it. No one could decipher what she was thinking about.</p>

  <p>"Bro, what are you dong? That chick is so beautiful. Why didn't you chat with her more?" the other guard asked when the guard who dealt with Mu Ning came back.</p>

  <p>That guard only harrumphed at the remark. "Stop making fun of me. She came here looking for Luo Zheng. The thing is, it looks like she comes from a noble family, so I don't understand why she came here alone. I'm curious as what Luo Zheng has done to her that made her come to Cloud Hall without any backup."</p>

  <p>"Hmnn... Should we inform Master Ning?" the other guard inquired.</p>

  <p>"I think we should leave it for now. Master Ning has been busy these few days. We just need to watch the door and prevent anyone from entering Cloud Hall," a third guard said.</p>

  <p>As these guards discussed what was happening with hushed voices, their gazes didn't leave Mu Ning. Standing guard for Cloud Hall was a tedious job, and they already considered it a treat to lay their eyes on such an elegant and stunning beauty as Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>After a short while of having her head down, Mu Ning raised her head and waved her hand. A crack suddenly appeared in the sky, from which a huge sword quickly descended. It then slashed down towards the barrier of Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>As the huge sword landed on the barrier, an ear-splitting sound erupted.</p>

  <p>After that, a layer of ripples began to appear on the barrier of Light of Water.</p>

  <p>"Holy shit!"</p>

  <p>The guards were shocked by what just happened. They did not expect a beautiful lady like Mu Ning would be so daring and directly attack the barrier of Cloud Hall!</p>

  <p>"What happened?" one guard exclaimed as he looked at the huge sword that struck the barrier. "This bitch doesn't know that the Cloud Hall is a fifth-grade sect!" By doing what she did, Mu Ning was only seeking death.</p>

  <p>"Hey, you! Stop what you're doing! You do not want to cause any trouble here at Cloud Hall. Take that as an advice! Because if you continue what you're doing, you won't be able to leave even if you want to later!" a guard warned Mu Ning as he started readying himself for a fight.</p>

  <p>But it was as if Mu Ning didn't hear any of what the guard said.</p>

  <p>Continuing her attack, ten cracks suddenly appeared in the sky and ten swords came out of them, each one slashing down towards the barrier.</p>

  <p>Thump! Thump!</p>

  <p>As the swords fell on the barrier like rainfall, their impact immediately increased tenfold. This time, not only did the noise scare the guards, it also alarmed the people who were in Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>Soon, two stewards at the Internal Elixir Realm rushed out from Cloud Hall's main entrance. With narrowed eyes, they looked at Mu Ning and asked, their tone scathing, "Who are you and why are you causing trouble here at Cloud Hall?"</p>

  <p>Mu Ning stayed silent and just looked at them. This time, she summoned over a hundred huge swords. After another glance at the guards and the two warriors, she let the swords fall on the barrier.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The power that the hundred swords emanated was terrifying. The water ripples on the surface of the barrier began to look bigger.</p>

  <p>Margaret's attack was the most ideal way to wear down and even destroy barriers. Such could have a huge impact if a battle between the sects erupted. For example, if she summoned a million swords and concentrated them on one target, she would be able to destroy a city. But she could not kill Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Then, if so many swords were to fall at the same time during a battle, the opposing sect would probably only have a few top masters left. The rest would all be dead, their bodies nothing but minced meat after the attack.</p>

  <p>"Halt your attacks!"</p>

  <p>"Or else, you will face immediate death!"</p>

  <p>"Do you know where you are?"</p>

  <p>Despite the shouts of the stewards, Mu Ning didn't stop at all. She still willed thousands upon thousands of swords to descend on Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>If these swords were to fall at the same time, their power would be devastating. It would almost have the same power as Eddie's punch. The only difference between them was that Eddie's punch was concentrated at a single point, while Margaret's swords were scattered across the barrier.</p>

  <p>But as the barrier was designed to scatter the force of an attack and take it as a whole, Margaret's attack was not any weaker than Eddie's punch.</p>

  <p>As Margaret's attack continued, the surface of the barrier immediately surged with turbulent waves. At the same time, the supreme life vitality crystals that were maintaining it were also beginning to rapidly deplete.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had been chatting with Tianming. In the past two years, they had experienced a lot of things, and they managed to escape certain death twice. Soon enough, their feelings of relief vanished as they saw violent waves appearing on the barrier around Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>Only a warrior at the Life and Death Realm could be able to cause such a thing. Was Eddie already here? Was he attacking the barrier?</p>

  <p>Zheng's expression changed and quickly, he rushed towards the entrance of Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Ning Yudie, Morphens and a group of elders from Cloud Hall also rushed outside.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, what's going on?" Ning Yudie asked Luo Zheng as they made their way outside.</p>

  <p>"I'm not sure either. In the Central Region, only Life and Death Realm masters can cause such an intense reaction to the Light of Water," Luo Zheng said with a cautious look on his face.</p>

  <p>There were only a handful of Life and Death Realm masters in the Central Region. However, if it was Eddie, the guards would have already reported it. So who on earth was attacking the barrier?</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng arrived at the Cloud Hall's gate, he saw tens of thousands of huge swords appear out of thin air just outside the barrier.</p>

  <p>When Ning Yudie, Luo Zheng, and Morphens saw the swords, their expressions once again changed. Seeing so many swords falling down onto the barrier, all of them believed that the Light of Water would soon collapse.</p>

  <p>"Who are you and why are you attacking the Cloud Hall?" Ning Yudie shouted angrily. But soon enough, they started to see who was on the other side of the barrier, conducting a full-on attack on Cloud Hall. It was a girl in plain clothes.</p>

  <p>But just by looking at the oncoming swords, Luo Zheng had already felt like he knew who the person outside the barrier was. The swords reminded him of Marilyn. He then looked outside, and there she was - Mu Ning. His expression changed drastically. After a few moments of awe, he immediately roared at Mu Ning, "What are you doing? Stop it right now!"</p>

  <p>When Mu Ning heard Zheng's voice, all of the swords stopped mid-air. As she saw that the one who spoke was indeed Luo Zheng, a smile quickly appeared on her lips. But then, when she saw Zheng's angry expression, her face immediately became gloomy. This man had never been nice to her, and she felt that he would never, ever be.</p>

  <p>With a flick of her finger, all the swords disappeared into thin air.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie had already planned to make her move. She wanted to kill this attacker before any other sword landed on the barrier. She didn't care who this girl was. Anyone who dared to destroy the barrier around the Cloud Hall would face the wrath of death!</p>

  <p>Although the swords were powerful enough that they could destroy the barrier around the Cloud Hall, they wouldn't be able to hurt Ning Yudie. If she decided to, she would have enough time to get around them and find a gap to kill whoever the attacker was.</p>

  <p>However, after hearing Luo Zheng, the attacker suddenly stopped. That surprised Ning Yudie greatly. Then, she wondered whether Luo Zheng knew the girl.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning bit her lips, stared at Luo Zheng and said in a hushed voice, "Finally, you're willing to come out to meet me."</p>

  <p>"What? If you really want to see me, why didn't you just let the guards inform me?" Luo Zheng said as he continued to glare at Mu Ning. "How could you be this stupid!"</p>

  <p>Then, Mu Ning pointed at the guards, her lips pouted. "But they told me that you were not here in the Cloud Hall! I thought you were just hiding.</p>

  <p>I thought you were just not willing to see me."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng turned around and glared at the guards. Scared, the guards immediately explained the misunderstanding with an apologetic face,</p>

  <p>"Sir, we didn't know you were back. We thought you were still in a distant land, and so we told her that." The guards were more than scared.</p>

  <p>If the barrier of Cloud Hall had been destroyed because of this incident, they would be severely punished.</p>

  <p>With that, Luo Zheng snorted. He then stared back at Mu Ning and asked,</p>

  <p>"What brings you here?"</p>

  <p>The others were also curious. Why was this woman looking for Luo Zheng?</p>

  <p>Mu Ning thought for a while and then shook her head. "I don't know either."</p>

  <p>Morphens and the few elders looked at each other and tittered. They had lived for so many years and could roughly guess that Luo Zheng played the field outside, so the girl came after him. Not long ago, Morphens had witnessed a scene where Luo Zheng was hugging Ning Yudie. He had no idea how things would end today.</p>

  <p>Of course, the one who had to solve the problem definitely wasn't them, but Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie looked at Mu Ning, her face full of conflicting emotions. Then she asked, "Are you the young lady from the Xi Clan?"</p>

  <p>Mu Ning summoned so many huge swords, just like Marilyn did when she confronted Luo Zheng a few years ago. So Ning Yudie guessed that Mu Ning possessed a Purple Power Body. But then, she noted how she was only at the primary level of the Internal Elixir Realm, yet she could already summon so many swords. Obviously, she was much stronger than Marilyn.</p>

  <p>Currently, there were only three Purple Power Bodies in the Central Region, two of which were in Eddie's hands. Since the third one was Xander's great-granddaughter, Ning Yudie had made such a logical conclusion.</p>

  <p>As Ning Yudie had guessed her identity, Mu Ning nodded and said, "Yes, I am Mu Ning Xi."</p>

  <p>She thought the others would show her respect once she made herself known. However, Ning Yudie just looked at her with a weird expression and asked, "You don't know why you're looking for Luo Zheng, but why did you come to the Cloud Hall for him?"</p>
