<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2099 The Bicker </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>All of the remaining Supreme Lords of the Sacred race had perished.</p>

  <p>This meant none other than the end of the universal war.</p>

  <p>To the Evolutionary Universe, this war was still a massive calamity.</p>

  <p>Countless supreme worlds had been shattered; countless kingdoms had been destroyed and it was hard to even estimate the number of warriors that had been killed.</p>

  <p>All the same though, like the aftermath of a forest fire, destruction also meant rebirth.</p>

  <p>Here, in the Evolutionary Universe, there were only thirty-odd remaining Supreme Lords across all the land. In other words, there were over ninety current vacancies for Supreme Lords!</p>

  <p>It was true that quite a high number of Evolutionary Universe's world lords had lost their lives in the battle, but the overall number of world lords was still good. The remaining two hundred thousand world lords would strive to fight for the Supreme Lord position.</p>

  <p>That said, fighting for a position as a Supreme Lord was far from easy.</p>

  <p>After all, bearing the Crown of Destiny required time, and the Supreme Lords within the Evolutionary Universe weren't yet completely dead. In fact, it was highly plausible that the distribution of over ninety Crowns of Destiny was still controlled by the remaining thirty-odd Supreme Lords!</p>

  <p>Due to the Sacred race invasion, all present Supreme Lords had dropped their prejudices. When it came to the interests of their own race though, the chances of conflict lingering between them were still great.</p>

  <p>Given the fact that these Supreme Lords had passed through such a disastrous event together, the distribution of the Crowns of Destiny should no longer resort to force. It was now more likely than ever that it would be resolved through negotiation.</p>

  <p>It wasn't long before Master Feng used the Roaring Token in order to announce the victory to the entire universe.</p>

  <p>When Master Feng's voice echoed throughout the universe, the Evolution Lotus Flower became heavy once again. The "momentum" contained within the voice had more than doubled. All the intelligent creatures in the Evolutionary Universe began to celebrate.</p>

  <p>Joy pervaded every mortal royal court, every temple, street, countless sacred places and divine kingdoms...</p>

  <p>Not only were the intelligent beings affected by the atmosphere, but so were a few of the savage beasts, rare insects and plants. Heck, even the regular mountains and rivers seemed to be exuding a refreshing Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>This victory belonged to the entire universe, and this world was alive and thriving!</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng lay on a supreme world fragment, a sense of relief washed over him.</p>

  <p>In order to survive this universal crisis, he had been extremely busy for dozens of years. Fortunately though, the result wasn't half bad at all.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng also understood that this was the end for everyone in the Evolutionary Universe, he knew his life was truly about to begin.</p>

  <p>Now, he had to jump out of this universe and face the real enemy.</p>

  <p>Speaking of which, he wasn't the only one who needed to jump out of the universe. The other Godly Geniuses were actually obliged to make this same choice.</p>

  <p>"Mu Ning!"</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng stood up, a thought flashed through his mind and his eyebrows rose slightly.</p>

  <p>A few seconds ago, for safety's sake, Supreme Lord Lester had left with Xi Youqin's and Nathan's bodies in tow.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng was very confident in Supreme Lord Lester, he didn't know how things were going to play out.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Out of nowhere, a space crack suddenly appeared.</p>

  <p>From the crack emerged an agile figure. A pair of embroidered shoes tapped the air a few times before a woman pounced instantly into Luo Zheng's arms.</p>

  <p>"Ahh... I really thought I was going to die this time!" Mu Ning cried in Luo Zheng's arms.</p>

  <p>Not far away, the Supreme Lords looked at each other as they observed the scene. Xun rubbed at her delicate ears and looked away with her red, somewhat puffy eyes. She was the one who had stayed the longest with Luo Luo Zheng, and had long become accustomed to Xi Youqin's appearance.</p>

  <p>After being wrapped up tightly and hugged like an octopus, Luo Luo Zheng felt rather embarrassed and a little helpless, at first. It was inappropriate to be intimate with Mu Ning in front of the Supreme Lords, but seconds later, he seemed to have understood something. With a faint smile, he held onto Mu Ning tightly.</p>

  <p>It was precisely because of her sincerity that Mu Ning came off as totally adorable. And Luo Luo Zheng was in no position to ask her to change.</p>

  <p>However, just as Luo Luo Zheng grasped onto her waist, she struggled out of his embrace and her shallow eyebrows immediately knitted themselves into a frown. She glared at the blue-clothed woman behind Luo Luo Zheng and questioned him, "Luo Luo Zheng, who is this woman? Where does she come from?"</p>

  <p>Mu Ning had very developed senses and was likely to feel enmity toward any female that was around Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>It would have been fine if the blue-clothed woman was very ordinary, but this woman gave her a very special feeling. She immediately sensed that this woman was powerful and mysterious. Mu Ning had gone from a docile little sheep just a moment ago and transformed into a vicious lioness. This woman was the reason.</p>

  <p>Xi Youqin's actions had scared Master Feng and the others, though.</p>

  <p>None Supreme Lords present were capable of seeing through this blue-clothed woman's cultivation base. This woman was a terrifying character that could resist even Murphy's sword strike. They didn't doubt that with her ability alone, she could slaughter all of the Supreme Lords present in the blink of an eye!</p>

  <p>Such formidable masters were usually temperamental. They had a chance of winning this war all because the woman helped them at a crucial moment. If they angered her though, she might not let them get away that easily.</p>

  <p>Master Feng, Supreme Lord of Oracle and the others were all heavy hearted and felt an overwhelming desire to cry.</p>

  <p>"Mu Ning, don't speak nonsense! This lady has saved our lives!" Master Feng snapped, with an unprecedented sternness.</p>

  <p>Although Mu Ning belonged to the Celestial Position, Master Feng had always treated her with a kind attitude, just like a grandfather would. He treated her in such a way in order to make her control the Gods Killing Sword Array. Despite that though, his sudden seriousness came off as a surprise, and it stunned Mu Ning for a short moment.</p>

  <p>Faced with this situation, any other women, Lucille included, would have shut up immediately. After all, it was better to be sensible and get the priorities straight, right?</p>

  <p>Mu Ning, on the other hand, was quite different.</p>

  <p>After being scolded by Master Feng, she pouted and quickly responded,</p>

  <p>"So what if she saved our lives? Saving our lives means she can steal my man afterward? If we follow that line of thought, Supreme Lord Lester has also saved me, can he steal my man, too?"</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha!"</p>

  <p>Xun, who was nearly always serious, couldn't contain herself and laughed out loud.</p>

  <p>Blayd wanted to laugh too, but he didn't dare. Among all the people here, he was the only one who was absolutely clear on how terrifying this blue-clothed woman truly was.</p>

  <p>As for those Supreme Lords, their faces had completely darkened. A few of them were now cautiously sizing up Estelle, afraid that this woman would anger quickly!</p>

  <p>"Mu Ning!" Luo Luo Zheng shouted. Luo Luo Zheng felt that his only option was to try and stop Mu Ning before she grew more and more boisterous.</p>

  <p>"Am I wrong?" Mu Ning questioned, wrinkling her brow.</p>

  <p>At first, Luo Luo Zheng wanted to reprimand her with an even harsher tone but when he thought of how she had just been resurrected, his heart softened and he became speechless instead.</p>

  <p>Once Murphy's three-inch sword radiance was sealed off, Estelle kept looking upward, as if she was observing something in the sky. Upon hearing Xi Youqin's words though, she recovered her senses. As she cast an indifferent glance at Mu Ning, her face immediately cracked a mysterious smile like a blooming cyan lotus, exuding an attraction that was almost fatal to any man who dared look in her direction.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords here were much more experienced than the Emperors of the mortal world. The women by their sides were all stunning beauties, and many of them were even more outstanding than this blue-clothed woman. However, once they reached the Soul Sea Realm, it was quite easy to change their appearances, which then became unimportant. Despite that, this woman's temperament made all the present Supreme Lords flip out. Even Supreme Lord of Oracle, who was a woman, was no exception!</p>

  <p>Estelle smiled faintly while taking two slow steps toward Mu Ning. Her brown eyes seemed to have countless souls circulating within them. She was the controller of the Soul Wilderness, and no one could surpass her study in soul throughout the whole of the divine land. With just a glance, she seemed to have the capacity to suck in Xi Youqin's soul.</p>

  <p>Before the blue-clothed woman, Mu Ning felt naked, completely exposed. Amidst her nervousness, she retreated behind Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Lady, Mu Ning is straightforward and outspoken. Please forgive her,"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng uttered, clasping his hands together.</p>

  <p>Although he didn't know this mysterious blue-clothed woman at all, deep in his heart, Luo Luo Zheng didn't feel as though she had any ill intentions toward him. He knew she wasn't a mean person overall, and this was just a small matter, so Luo Luo Zheng wasn't very nervous.</p>

  <p>"Never mind. I just have something I want to tell her," Estelle responded unexpectedly, with a cold smile on her face. "So what if I steal your man?"</p>

  <p>As soon as these words were spoken, not only was Luo Luo Zheng stunned, but the other Supreme Lords present were equally taken aback.</p>

  <p>Even Blayd was dumbfounded at this reply. "She really is the number one extraordinary woman in all the divine land. She can say such words..."</p>

  <p>"But... Your man is still a little too inexperienced," Estelle uttered lightly.</p>

  <p>"Now, I don't have much interest in him, but who knows if my interest will change in the future."</p>

  <p>After that, she lightly swiped her pinky across Luo Zheng's forehead where the wound had nearly completely healed, leaving only a small cut. With her touch, the cut quickly disappeared.</p>

  <p>Everything happened so quickly that even Luo Luo Zheng himself hadn't noticed that a tiny petal had quietly been planted inside the wound.</p>
