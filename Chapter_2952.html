<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Zheng had seen this white crystal once before. After Leopold had taken a Yellow Emperor Guard's corpse back from the divine land, he had found one from his space ring.</p>

  <p>That was the divine crystal they were talking about.</p>

  <p>Timotheus and the others thought that the Yellow Emperor Guards' divine crystals had been used to activate the Slaughtering Moonlight Array.</p>

  <p>They were also positive that the Trumpet Flying Ship that the guards had with them needed the divine crystals to be driven.</p>

  <p>In Zheng's eyes, the divine crystal to the Source World was similar to that of the life vitality crystal to the universe.</p>

  <p>There was no life vitality crystal in the divine land because the power of True Gods came from the Faith Energy of their inner worlds. The divine might coin, which was similar to the life vitality crystal, couldn't be used by True Gods directly either. The divine might coins could only be used by the Holy Beings of large clans on the Floating Islands to modify rules on the Ruling Slate.</p>

  <p>It was no wonder Zheng's mouth had fallen open in shock with the overwhelming amount of divine crystals that lay before him.</p>

  <p>He had not expected there to be such a mass amount of divine crystals in this space.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>Zheng realized it was a fluctuation of space behind him, and Emily, Ramzi, Timotheus and Leopold appeared.</p>

  <p>The group glanced around Zheng, and their jaws dropped in amazement, their expressions much more exaggerated than Zheng's.</p>

  <p>Zheng was not a member of the Source World. Even though they told him the divine crystals were the currency of the Source World and the only way for Other Shore Realm warriors to replenish their energy, he still didn't have a clear understanding of the crystals' value.</p>

  <p>Because of this, Zheng was not as shocked as they were by the sheer number of divine crystals.</p>

  <p>For Timotheus, Emily, and the others, they were different.</p>

  <p>When they were fighting against Clement and his men, it was not that Timotheus, Emily and the others were weaker than their opponents.</p>

  <p>In terms of the number of Other Shore Realm warriors, the Nine Li Guards and the Snake Goddess members had the advantage. The biggest problem, however, was that Timotheus, Emily and the others lacked resources. They didn't have divine crystals. Shortly after they had been captured and placed in the prison, the divine crystals they had with them were exhausted.</p>

  <p>If they had been given enough crystals to nourish their Other Shore Tokens, they probably wouldn't need Zheng to give them a hand. Emily, Timotheus and Ramzi would have been able to kill the people led by Clement on their own with enough crystals.</p>

  <p>"I can't believe it. They're all divine crystals!" said Ramzi.</p>

  <p>"Am I dreaming? I must be dreaming. I've never seen so many divine crystals in one place before," Emily muttered.</p>

  <p>"These must have been left by the Grand Chieftain!" Timotheus exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Timotheus, Leopold, and Ramzi were beyond stunned at what lay before them.</p>

  <p>There was a hint of excitement twinkling in Emily's eye, but overall, she had a much calmer demeaner than the others.</p>

  <p>The number of divine crystals here was indeed shocking to Emily, but they did not belong to the Snake Goddess race.They belonged to the Nine Li race, so the divine crystals had nothing to do with her.</p>

  <p>It was a rare sight for so many divine crystals to be gathered in one place, even in the Source World.</p>

  <p>"I had still been contemplating how to get the Trumpet Flying Ship to work, but now it seems that luck is on our side," Leopold said, sighing happily.</p>

  <p>Zheng squatted and snatched up a divine crystal. He turned it over in his hand, feeling the unique coldness seep into his fingertips.</p>

  <p>The shape of the crystal was similar to that of stone, but the surface was smoother with seamless edges. He could feel the energy buzzing inside the crystal.</p>

  <p>The energy did not seem strong or special to Zheng; it just seemed exceptionally stable and gentle.</p>

  <p>"Are these divine crystals really that important?" Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Emily smiled at the question. "Of course! The divine crystals are the primary source of energy in the Source World. We won't be able to power anything without them."</p>

  <p>"But the energy within it isn't powerful," Zheng stated.</p>

  <p>"But the energy contained in the divine crystals can nourish the Other Shore Tokens. It allows the tokens to give off a more powerful energy," Emily said with a shrug of her shoulders.</p>

  <p>Zheng raised his eyebrows. "Does it have the same effect as the soul pill?"</p>

  <p>He had a minimal amount of understanding of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>When one wanted to reach the Other Shore, they needed to have the Other Shore Token. The strength of an Other Shore Realm warrior did not rely on the inner world.</p>

  <p>The power of a True God depended on the Faith Energy to be transformed into internal momentum by the Godly Tile. However, a powerful warrior at the Other Shore Realm improved the Godly Way to the extreme, and the power they pursued came from the Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>"It's different," said Emily, shaking her head. "There are two major currencies in the Source World: soul pills and divine crystals. Soul pills can be used on the Sea of Truth and the Other Shore as well as to strengthen the soul power. Divine crystals can be used in the Source World and used to nourish the Other Shore Tokens."</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded his head in understanding.</p>

  <p>He thought for a moment longer before asking another question. "Since the divine crystals are used to nourish the Other Shore Tokens, why does the Trumpet Flying Ship need them to be driven as well? The ship is not a powerful being at the Other Shore Realm. Is there an Other Shore Token on the deck of the flying ship?"</p>

  <p>"Your speculation is correct," Emily replied with a slight smile. "The ship was forged by special warriors at the Other Shore Realm. They have the ability to project the Other Shore Token on some objects."</p>

  <p>'They have the ability to project the Other Shore Token onto some objects?</p>

  <p>What does it mean?' Zheng thought, frowning in confusion at the crystal in his hand.</p>

  <p>He hadn't set foot into the Other Shore, so it was hard for him to understand what Emily said. Maybe if he reached the Other Shore Realm in the future, he would be able to further his understanding.</p>

  <p>"This is most likely the greatest legacy the Grand Chieftain left to us,"</p>

  <p>Timotheus said soflty, finally coming out of his shocked daze.</p>

  <p>Ramzi nodded, "I may have a rough idea of why there is so much Lethal Fire Magma here as well."</p>

  <p>"Why do you think?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Follow me," said Ramzi, taking the lead to walk along the path paved by divine crystals.</p>

  <p>Timotheus and the others followed him closely. They were certain they knew why, but they wanted clarification.</p>

  <p>At the beginning of the path, the divine crystals were laid flat on the ground, but the further they trekked, the more crystals there were. There were piles of crystals the size of small hills along the sides of the path.</p>

  <p>As they passed the small hills of crystals, the path became steeper and harder to walk. At the top, the walkway of crystals formed a slope and tapered down into the shape of a whirlpool.</p>

  <p>At the center of the whirlpool sat a large ancient tripod.</p>

  <p>In the center of the tripod, green Lethal Fire Magma was roiling, making the divine crystals around the whirlpool fall into the tripod.</p>

  <p>As Zheng stared at the tripod, he got the impression that it was an illusion. It seemed the tripod did not exist in this world, but he could feel a mysterious energy coming from it.</p>

  <p>"This big tripod..." Zheng muttered. He continued to stare at it for a long while, and thought over what Emily had told him. "Is it an Other Shore Token too?"</p>

  <p>"That is correct!" Emily said. A trace of admiration flashed in her eyes as she continued, "This is the Mysterious Meteor Tripod."</p>

  <p>Ramzi nodded and added, "The Lethal Fire Magma is actually named the Mysterious Meteor Fire."</p>

  <p>"Is the Mysterious Meteor Tripod the Other Shore Token of the Grand Chieftain?" Zheng asked as he looked back at the whirlpool.</p>
