<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 208 A Good Plan (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The light curtain was egg-shaped, floating in the air.</p>

  <p>Zheng crawled to the edge of the eggshell and was only a few feet away from Demon King Aldrich.</p>

  <p>There was a saying that people couldn't be distracted when competing in battle of life vitality, for Aldrich he believed otherwise. Being the demon king, he was beyond any human belief and standards so a slight disturbance wouldn't affect him.</p>

  <p>Zheng thought that if he had rushed without thinking, he might be stabbed by the demon king's spike and his life would be over before he knew it.</p>

  <p>At this point, caution was his only friend.</p>

  <p>He thought that the safest way was to attack with his broken flying knife, but he didn't expect to kill demon king with one shot. But if he could injure him, it could cause a considerable amount of effect on the demon king.</p>

  <p>With that in mind, Zheng gently pressed space ring with his finger and shot flying knife towards the back of the Demon King Aldrich.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the demon king was ranting about his carelessness in ignoring the human boy when he released the demon's holy fire.</p>

  <p>He initially thought that the human boy was as weak as an ant. He wouldn't even pay much attention to a master of the Illuminating Soul Realm, so why would he worry about a meek human boy? He was confident that the boy would eventually be corroded when exposed to his demon's holy fire.</p>

  <p>But Demon King Aldrich didn't expect that the boy would consume his demon's holy fire.</p>

  <p>He found it strange for an ordinary human to stand his demon's holy fire, let alone consume it like it was nothing.</p>

  <p>Witnessing this made him change his perspective about the boy. Since then, he didn't let his guard down at all.</p>

  <p>It also made sense to the demon king why Yolande brought the boy to the battlefield. If Yolande didn't know that the boy had the ability to swallow the demon's holy fire, she wouldn't have brought him in here in the first place.</p>

  <p>After he processed all the details, he now concluded that everything wasn't a coincidence, but premeditation.</p>

  <p>And Demon King Aldrich believed that the humans had more tricks up their sleeves.</p>

  <p>At that time, he sensed the flying knife that Zheng shot at his back.</p>

  <p>Before Demon King Aldrich had time to react, the flying knife already hit him at the back.</p>

  <p id="top_1">"That tickles. By the way, that's a nice flying knife, kid," Demon King Aldrich chuckled sarcastically.</p>

  <p>But Zheng was in disbelief when he saw how his flying knife stopped before hitting the demon king as if there was a great barrier that was protecting Aldrich.</p>

  <p>Spencer and the other masters were fighting with the other two demon kings in the sky when they saw what was happening between Zheng and Demon King Aldrich. They abruptly stopped and watched the combat nervously.</p>

  <p>"Geez, what a pity!" Spencer shook his head in disappointment. 'The kid's strength is only at the half-step into the nature level and it isn't enough to deal with the demon king. If it were me, that flying knife would surely hit him and that demon king won't have the chance to escape. He would be dead in an instant, ' Spencer thought to himself.</p>

  <p>The other Illuminating Soul Realm masters were also disappointed at the turn of events. "What is wrong with him? Does he really think he can beat that demon king with his half-step into the nature level?" said one of the masters.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Demon King Oceiros and the other ordinary demon king were a bit relaxed and were enjoying the scene. "That boy is stupid enough to fight Aldrich with his level. It's like going into a lion's den and presenting himself as food. He'll soon be crushed like an ant," Demon King Oceiros said to the other demon king.</p>

  <p>Zheng was nervous, but he had to take another shot at this. He gently pulled the ring on his finger to take back the falling flying knife.</p>

  <p>He took several consecutive shots, but nothing even made it to Demon King Aldrich. The knife would lose its aim as soon as it got nearer to the demon king. One shot almost hit back at Zheng, luckily, he was able to dodge it.</p>

  <p>There was no chance he could kill the demon king with the flying knife.</p>

  <p>He changed to use the Heavenly Ogre Fist.</p>

  <p>He took a deep breath and readied himself for the Heavenly Ogre Fist pose. He turned his original life energy to the demonic life energy.</p>

  <p>"Ogres Shaking the World!"</p>

  <p>With his commanding voice and pose, a purple-black shadow accumulated in Zheng's fist.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!" shouted Zheng as he threw the purple-black shadow towards Demon King Aldrich.</p>

  <p>Zheng was confident at the strength of his Heavenly Ogre Fist. He once defeated the Illuminating Soul Realm master Hugh with it, but Zheng knew that his victory was only because Hugh was not 100% into their fight.</p>

  <p>"Poof!"</p>

  <p>But like the flying knife, the purple-black fist shadow hit an invisible barrier before reaching Demon King Aldrich.</p>

  <p>Zheng failed again. His face showed his disappointment and frustration.</p>

  <p>'Damn! Both my flying knife and the Heavenly Ogre Fist didn't work.</p>

  <p>There's no way but to approach him myself.</p>

  <p>Damn it. But Demon King Aldrich is strong. His strength is far beyond mine. What if he attacks me and kills me in an instant?' Zheng thought hopelessly.</p>

  <p>"Listen to me, boy! If you stop this nonsense, I will let you live as my servant after I capture the White Emperor City," Demon King Aldrich shouted at Zheng.</p>

  <p>When Zheng heard it, he was angered. He scoffed, "I'm sorry. I'm not interested to be anyone's slave."</p>

  <p>"So, what do you want to be?" Demon King Aldrich asked Zheng.</p>

  <p>"I would like to be your master. What do you think?" Zheng sneered.</p>
