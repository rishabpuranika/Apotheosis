<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>A frightening energy burst and flowed wildly throughout the huge triangular pyramid.</p>

  <p>The black flames occupied almost the entire space, as if they burned up from the most ferocious hell.</p>

  <p>And among it all, two gigantic creatures brawled like beasts in captive!</p>

  <p>The two powerful masters had used many theurgies and were now left with only their physical bodies to end this battle.</p>

  <p>Othniel might have had an absolute advantage in terms of spatial transference, but he still could not get the upper hand on the Grandmaster of Heaven, who was giving it all he had. In fact, he was in grave danger.</p>

  <p>"Can this space you've created really bear my hellfire all the time?" said the Grandmaster of Heaven, sneering.</p>

  <p>The relentless, unending black fire released from the Six Soul Flags continued burning the space, causing numerous cracks to form.</p>

  <p>If they continued to grow, eventually the entire space would collapse with an enormous bang.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven would then be free and Othniel would be no match for him.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! dozens of ten million-foot-long space blades sliced at the Grandmaster of Heaven. He responded by raising his Cyan Misty Sword and waving it gently, collapsing the space blades as soon as they were touched by the cyan light that came off the sword.</p>

  <p>Othniel glanced at the cracks and a trace of worry crept into him, but he still allowed himself to say, "The space can withstand your flames for hundreds, even thousands of years!"</p>

  <p>His body shuddered as he spoke and the cracks in the triangular pyramid quickly closed and the space recovered!</p>

  <p>He was unable to defeat the Grandmaster of Heaven here. He had basically already lost. The man before him had surpassed the Chaos Ancient God.</p>

  <p>However, Othniel could delay this battle.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven looked at the rapidly healing triangular pyramid and inquired, "You wish to take Luo Zheng away, right?"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Othniel asked, staring down his opponent.</p>

  <p>"This sort of battle is meaningless," said the Grandmaster of Heaven calmly. "They have already fled to the Li Shan mountain. At the very least, we should catch Luo Zheng and then we can resume this battle and find a winner!"</p>

  <p>"You wish to call for peace?" Othniel asked astounded.</p>

  <p>"I just think that it would allow us both to get what we need," the Grandmaster of Heaven replied smiling.</p>

  <p>Othniel shook his head. "How do I know you won't just attack me once I let you out?"</p>

  <p>This round of their bout revealed the gap between them to Othniel quite clearly; there was no way he would let the Grandmaster of Heaven go without caution.</p>

  <p>"I will not attack you until I have destroyed the Li Shan mountain," the Grandmaster of Heaven answered earnestly.</p>

  <p>"Why should I believe you?" Othniel asked, still not trusting him.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven pondered for a moment before saying, "I can swear with the Contract-restricting Twin-headed Snake."</p>

  <p>The Contract-restricting Twin-headed Snake was the captain of the Black Ship's Other Shore Token. Once an oath was made, the snake would form a huge restraint, and if one broke the oath, they would pay a heavy price.</p>

  <p>Naturally, Othniel had heard of the Contract-restricting Twin-headed Snake.</p>

  <p>His large single eye blinked as he considered this, but he still seemed unconvinced. "If you have the snake, I will trust you for now," he said finally.</p>

  <p>"I don't, but someone else has it," said the Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>Soon after he spoke, several black ships came from the distance and stopped beside the triangular pyramid.</p>

  <p>The captain in a black cloak stepped out of one of the ships and gently knocked on the wall of the space.</p>

  <p>Othniel hesitated for a moment and then let the captain in.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven then made an oath using the Contract-restricting Twin-headed Snake, after which their battle finally subsided and the massive triangular pyramid was removed.</p>

  <p>"Grandmaster of Heaven, are you off to the Li Shan mountain now?" asked the captain.</p>

  <p>"Of course," he answered. He was a man of action and would not give the Li Shan mountain any chance of escape. He turned to Othniel and said, "Will you be joining me?"</p>

  <p>Othniel snorted and was enveloped by a square space. In an instant, his huge body vanished right before the Grandmaster of Heaven and the members of the Black Ship.</p>

  <p>Their agreement was that the Grandmaster of Heaven would not make a move on Othniel before the Li Shan mountain was destroyed. Once that was done, no restriction existed and they would most likely battle for Luo Zheng once more.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven was in such a hurry that Othniel could easily pretend it was none of his business.</p>

  <p>The captain looked at the place where Othniel had disappeared and reminded, "Grandmaster of Heaven, I'm afraid Othniel will not leave so easily."</p>

  <p>"Of course he will not leave," the Grandmaster of Heaven said, shrugging his shoulders with a stone faced expression. "And he can't leave either."</p>

  <p>The captain did not understand what he had meant; he simply nodded, led him onto the ship and began heading west.</p>

  <p>On the ship, the Evil God sat cross-legged, falling into a deep and strange trance.</p>

  <p>When he closed his eyes, he still saw many large provinces in the distance, connected together.</p>

  <p>Every time he entered a large province, an invisible tentacle extended towards him, trying to establish a connection.</p>

  <p>Once it was completed, the Evil God was connected to this province.</p>

  <p>Every detail of the entire province would be laid bare before his eyes, and the harm he suffered would be transferred to the boundary wall of the province.</p>

  <p>This ability was very useful, but the Evil God was not satisfied with it.</p>

  <p>Above his head was a space wider still; it was the entire Source World.</p>

  <p>He could feel the tentacle representing the entire Source World, but it was only faintly visible, seeming to evade him.</p>

  <p>His goal was to make contact with this tentacle.</p>

  <p>Two hours after the Snake Goddess and the others returned to the Li Shan mountain, milky white clouds rose up above the whole province.</p>

  <p>If one stood at the highest point in the Source World and looked down, they'd see that it seemed the largest mountain in the Source World had been covered in snow rather quickly.</p>

  <p>The layers of clouds spread like a waterfall, creating a wondrous and beautiful scene.</p>

  <p>The people in the Li Shan mountain, however, were not pleased but worried.</p>

  <p>This was the Cloud Cover Array, the most powerful array of the Li Shan mountain, which had not been opened for a great many years. Its activation meant the Li Shan mountain now faced an incredibly formidable enemy.</p>

  <p>Not long ago, When the Li Shan mountain was under constant provocation from the Bearing race, news arrived that the temporary peace in the Source World would probably not last much longer.</p>

  <p>The reality often came faster than rumors...</p>

  <p>After the Cloud Cover Array was set up, the whole Li Shan mountain was like a giant beast crawling across the ground.</p>

  <p>Under the jadeite platform atop the Li Shan mountain, the nine mountain leaders and more than two hundred grand sect leaders had already gathered and awaited orders.</p>

  <p>From the center of the platform, the Snake Goddess glanced at the mountain leaders and the grand sect leaders and said, "All the sects and mountains have to restrain their own disciples from going out. For the next several months, no one is allowed to leave."</p>

  <p>The mountain leaders and grand sect leaders raised their heads and looked at the Snake Goddess in astonishment, their faces filled with confusion.</p>

  <p>The Li Shan mountain was in danger. They had to pledge to fight to the death to defend it. Why had the Snake Goddess suddenly issued this ban?</p>
