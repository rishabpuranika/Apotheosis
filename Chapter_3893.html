  <p>
</p>

  <p>Othniel stared at Zheng in horror, as if he was looking straight at a monster.</p>

  <p>He was practically speechless.</p>

  <p>It was only then that he finally realized why Yellow Thearch was so eager to take Zheng away and why the Element Spirit race was so determined to get him.</p>

  <p>Othniel swallowed thickly as he muttered a question to this horrifying freak in front of him. "How did you make it?"</p>

  <p>Zheng shot him an indifferent glance. "Why should I tell you? You can go out now."</p>

  <p>Although he had fused with the ancestry-level bloodline, Zheng's use of the blood was still limited in the usage of the inter-restriction properties between energies.</p>

  <p>If worse came to worst and he had to fight head-on with beings like Othniel and Grandmaster of Heaven then he might not be able to make it.</p>

  <p>Since he did not know much about what was happening outside, he needed to use Othniel's power.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven was too busy fighting with the Snake Goddess and Fuxi that he didn't notice Zheng sneakily changing the state of space in the Fishing Drum.</p>

  <p>This change of space cut off the connection between the Grandmaster of Heaven and the space treasure.</p>

  <p>However, the Heart-piercing Lock was a real thing connected to the Grandmaster of Heaven and the moment Zheng broke the chains, the former's expression changed.</p>

  <p>Fuxi took his opponent's distraction to his advantage and placed another mark of Eight Diagrams on the Grandmaster of Heaven's body.</p>

  <p>Boom! Being hit by Fuxi's strike, the Grandmaster of Heaven was sent flying away. Despite the slight elevation in terms of advantage, both Fuxi and Snake Goddess felt a bit strange.</p>

  <p>This was a life and death battle that even a powerful warrior like the Grandmaster of Heaven had to go all out with his attacks. That momentary distraction was unlike him. Did he, perhaps, encounter some sort of trouble?</p>

  <p>No matter what sort of trouble it was, the fact remained that they were currently embroiled in a battle to the death so Fuxi and the Snake Goddess showed no mercy. Their bodies flashed as they chased after the Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>With no time to deal with his oncoming opponents, the Grandmaster of Heaven quickly flew backward in retreat.</p>

  <p>He had been able to trap Othniel into the Fishing Drum effortlessly because he caught Othniel off guard. If Othniel really managed to escape, that would be the biggest trouble.</p>

  <p>Since Othniel was still in the Fishing Drum, the Grandmaster of Heaven figured that it would take him a long time to completely break out which meant that he still had a chance to stop him.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>However, when the Grandmaster of Heaven was sent flying backwards, Fuxi and the Snake Goddess remained relentless in their pursuit.</p>

  <p>"Damn it!" the Grandmaster of Heaven cursed.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, he flipped his hands and the Six Soul Flags flew in the air. .</p>

  <p>At his command, the Six Soul Flags moved on their own and emanated a cold aura that caused the temperature within a hundred-mile radius to drop significantly.</p>

  <p>Refined with six powerful ghosts, the Six Soul Flags were formidable, and these ghosts could be considered the weapon spirits of the Six Soul Flags.</p>

  <p>From within the flags, six black ghosts sporting a single horn on their heads rushed out and let out chilling howls.</p>

  <p>Usually, these ghosts were the Grandmaster of Heaven's trump card and there was no way he'd use them on a regular fight. However, he was faced with no other choice if he had to deal with Othniel.</p>

  <p>These ghosts would be enough to stop Fuxi and the Snake Goddess for him.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, the ghosts all collectively headed straight towards Fuxi!</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>At the approach of these ghosts, Fuxi simply held out his hand and branded all of them with marks of Eight Diagrams.</p>

  <p>There were six, successive explosive sounds as the ghosts were blown away. They were not destroyed entirely but the Six Soul Flags still suffered heavy damages from Fuxi's attack.</p>

  <p>The horrifying pained cries of the ghosts made the Grandmaster of Heaven even more distressed. He had to move fast since his trump card might not be enough to deter his opponents. He quickly raised the Fishing Drum and intended to use the power of space to bind Othniel.</p>

  <p>However, the moment he grabbed it, his whole body froze.</p>

  <p>The space treasure that had accompanied him for countless years was disconnected from him!</p>

  <p>Even the lock that bound Othniel had come undone. Could he have broken his Fishing Drum in such a short period of time? That was impossible!</p>

  <p>There was no way he could believe it.</p>

  <p>Just as he was about to forcefully take control of the Fishing Drum, he heard a light sound coming from the Fishing Drum.</p>

  <p>An invisible space fluctuation softly spread out along with the light dongs.</p>

  <p>"Dong, dong! Dong, dong, dong!"</p>

  <p>Soon the Fishing Drum emitted a series of rhythmic sounds.</p>

  <p>Each soft bang was accompanied by the space fluctuation and even attracted Fuxi's and the Snake Goddess's attentions.</p>

  <p>"Dong-dong-dong! Dong-dong!"</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven could only stare at the Fishing Drum with a frown. He was astounded inside.</p>

  <p>There were nine rhythms that the Fishing Drum could produce.</p>

  <p>The one he was hearing now belonged to the eighth rhythm, which meant that the Fishing Drum was about to release the creatures he had trapped inside!</p>

  <p>What the hell?! How was that possible?</p>

  <p>The only one who was able to do that was him and him alone!</p>

  <p>Was it possible that Othniel grasped the method due to his understanding of space truth?</p>

  <p id="top_2">"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>Faced with the inevitable, the Grandmaster of Heaven could only watch as Othniel effortlessly came out of the Fishing Drum.</p>

  <p>There was a shared look of unusual shock on both their faces as they looked at each other.</p>

  <p>Othniel was shocked at Zheng's ability. The Grandmaster of Heaven was understandably shocked that Othniel was able to come out.</p>

  <p>'What is the matter with Othniel's expression?</p>

  <p>Why is he confused?</p>

  <p>Didn't he come out by himself?'</p>

  <p>Just as the Grandmaster of Heaven began to think that there might actually be more to this situation, the Fishing Drum began to beat once again.</p>

  <p>"Dong-dong-dong! Dong-dong!"</p>

  <p>It was still the eighth rhythm that signaled the release of a creature trapped within.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, another person emerged from the drum. It was none other than Zheng!</p>

  <p>The sight of the young man instantly cleared things up for the Grandmaster of Heaven. Zheng had woken up!</p>

  <p>So that meant the one who released Othniel was Zheng?</p>

  <p>Of course, this conclusion only led to more confusion. How in the world was this young man able to unlock the Heart-piercing Lock and take control of the Fishing Drum?</p>

  <p>"Zheng?"</p>

  <p>"He woke up?"</p>

  <p>Fuxi and the Snake Goddess, who stood by the side, were just as equally shocked.</p>

  <p>If Zheng was awake then that meant he left the Eternal Scroll Painting and managed to obtain a bloodline. He was now a warrior at the Eternal Realm!</p>

  <p>However, it would be difficult for him to unleash his newly obtained bloodline since he just reached the Eternal Realm. There was still no way he'd be able to contend with the Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>Also, there was the matter of his and Othniel's emergence from the Fishing Drum. How in the world were they able to do that?</p>

  <p>"I've helped you out, and now you have to hold up your side of the bargain," Zheng told Othniel meaningfully.</p>

  <p>His words made Fuxi and the Snake Goddess look at each other in shock.</p>

  <p>Othniel was released by Zheng?</p>

  <p>How?! What had happened to Zheng?</p>

  <p>Othniel simply gave Zheng a smile. "Of course! I'll make my move but none of you can leave."</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, the fluctuation of space truth began to gush out from his body in waves.</p>

  <p>The bloodline theurgies of Chaos Ancient Gods were terrifying when they burst out. The only reason Othniel was imprisoned was because he had been caught off guard. It did not have anything to do with skill or power but pure, dumb luck on the Grandmaster of Heaven's part. That was why Othniel was resentful at his capture.</p>

  <p>Now that Othniel was free, there was no way he was going to repeat his mistake.</p>

  <p>He was determined to kill the Grandmaster of Heaven and afterwards, capture Zheng!</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>A huge, triangular pyramid appeared, spanning ten thousand miles. It was so big and stable that it formed a world on its own.</p>

  <p>Othniel had pushed the space truth to the limit. This theurgy had exceedingly surpassed the Grandmaster of Heaven's Fishing Drum and made one thing clear: Othniel was not going to let anyone go!</p>
