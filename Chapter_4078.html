<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The cyan-skinned Great Ghost Priest had already planned to kill Claire.</p>

  <p>However, a chill ran down his spine, and his body violently trembled when he saw the wolf tooth that the Eye Spirit showed him.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the other eleven Great Ghost Priests just watched everything for fun. However, they too got surprised when they saw the wolf tooth as well.</p>

  <p>The creatures in the Night View Island had seen the necklace of wolf teeth in their minds.</p>

  <p>There were very powerful fluctuations in the Night View Island every two hundred days and nights, even if they did not use their spiritual senses. On that day, no one could go out because the necklace of wolf teeth appeared in everyone's mind. That day was a day full of pain for all the creatures in the Night View Island.</p>

  <p>Many legends about the wolf teeth had spread across the Night View Island.</p>

  <p>It was said that they were the teeth of the master of Ghost Mountain.</p>

  <p>Those ten teeth chewed up anyone who died into pieces.</p>

  <p>Some creatures saw them as totems and worshipped them. After they captured their prey, they pulled out all their teeth and fashioned them into the shape of wolf teeth, then embedded them on tall totems.</p>

  <p>As for the wolf teeth's real origin story, the people outside the Ghost Mountain did not know about it, unlike the Great Ghost Priests in the Ghost Mountain.</p>

  <p>Their life's significance rested on those ten wolf teeth. They were their tasks and the Ghost Master's obsession.</p>

  <p>Now, the reason the Ghost Master hadn't woken up yet was that he had lost these wolf teeth.</p>

  <p>His obsession was to find his greatest magic treasure, the Thirteen Teeth Necklace.</p>

  <p>As its name suggested, it was a necklace inlaid with thirteen wolf teeth.</p>

  <p>However, the Thirteen Teeth Necklace had long been missing, and now, only three real teeth remained in the Ghost Mountain.</p>

  <p>After the creatures in the Night View Island fused with the hatred-level Treacherous Beings, they were led into a special hall. In the center of the hall was a wolf tooth.</p>

  <p>The Great Ghost Priests had to remember the aura of this wolf tooth, then find the other teeth.</p>

  <p>It was an order from the Ghost Master.</p>

  <p>Of course, the Ghost Master hadn't awakened and was still in a dead sleep.</p>

  <p>Yet, he instinctively began to collect the wolf teeth!</p>

  <p>And his strategy was correct.</p>

  <p>The Ghost Mountain was known for its richness in resources.</p>

  <p>With the Ghost Mountain's support, the Great Ghost Priests who fused with the hatred-level Treacherous Beings could search the Three Purities Stage and find all the wolf teeth one by one.</p>

  <p>At first, two Great Ghost Priests had completed their tasks and brought back two wolf teeth from the Three Purities Stage.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, since the passageway of the Night View Island had gotten destroyed, they could not leave the island.</p>

  <p>That was why there were only three wolf teeth in the mountain.</p>

  <p>Naturally, the newly selected Great Ghost Priests felt dejected.</p>

  <p>After all, they had searched every part of the Night View Island, but to no avail.</p>

  <p>Because they could not find the wolf teeth, they were punished and imprisoned in the Ghost Mountain.</p>

  <p>That was why it was quite hard for the new Great Ghost Priests to leave the Ghost Mountain these years.</p>

  <p>They suffered bitterly, while the Ghost Master himself had given up on himself. He had lost hope on awakening.</p>

  <p>However, a group of strangers suddenly appeared, and one of them brought a wolf tooth. Of course, the Great Ghost Priests could not contain their excitement.</p>

  <p>Their memories of the wolf tooth's aura were still fresh in their minds.</p>

  <p>Just then, the cyan-skinned Great Ghost Priest's body trembled. He jumped down from the upper layer, then stooped down and smelled the wolf tooth.</p>

  <p>"It's quite similar.</p>

  <p>But the aura of the energy is different from that of the wolf tooth," he said.</p>

  <p>Although he was also ecstatic, he was worried.</p>

  <p>"Each wolf tooth contains bloodline power, and the bloodline of each wolf tooth is different. Thus, the aura of the energy is naturally different," the Eye Spirit explained.</p>

  <p>"May I verify it?" the cyan-skinned Great Ghost Priest asked.</p>

  <p>"Sure," said the Eye Spirit.</p>

  <p>He had a total of ten wolf teeth in his hands. Even if he gave the cyan-skinned Great Ghost Priest one, he still had nine left.</p>

  <p>"But there is one condition," said Claire.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing those words, Luo Zheng and the others felt their hearts sank.</p>

  <p>When the Great Ghost Priests decided to intervene, he and the others finally felt hopeful.</p>

  <p>If the Ghost Altar did not allow them to fight, they could stay and wait for the reinforcements of the human race.</p>

  <p>However, now that the Eye Spirit brought out a wolf tooth of great importance, the tense situation toned down.</p>

  <p>They did not need to think too much to know what condition Claire wanted.</p>

  <p>"Let me guess. You want the lives of these people?" the cyan-skinned Great Ghost Priest asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Claire answered.</p>

  <p>"Let's talk about it after I examine it," the cyan-skinned Great Ghost Priest said.</p>

  <p>"We can wait," Claire said with a smile.</p>

  <p>The cyan-skinned Great Ghost Priest nodded, then asked the question that all the Great Ghost Priests were concerned about, "How many wolf teeth do you have?"</p>

  <p>The Great Ghost Priests' ultimate task was to gather the ten remaining wolf teeth.</p>

  <p>"It depends on whether you guys cooperate or not," Claire said playfully.</p>

  <p>In turn, the Great Ghost Priests became even more excited.</p>

  <p>Did it mean that they had more than one wolf teeth in their hands?</p>

  <p>The Great Ghost Priests exchanged glances with each other.</p>

  <p>They did not think that the Eye Spirit, Claire, and the Holy Wings Armor were powerful beings.</p>

  <p>But now that these people were in their territory, would they just steal all the wolf teeth?</p>

  <p>The cyan-skinned Great Ghost Priest thought of the same thing.</p>

  <p>Claire knew what went on in their minds, and her catty eyes glinted dangerously. "If you try to make a move, you will regret it. Our supporter is on par with the Ghost Master."</p>

  <p>The twelve Great Ghost Priests present were stunned.</p>

  <p>After a while of thought, they immediately understood what she meant.</p>

  <p>If the Eye Spirit had dared to lead his people straight to the Ghost Mountain with the wolf teeth, then he must be quite confident.</p>

  <p>"You must be kidding. We are very grateful to you because you brought the wolf teeth here in the Ghost Mountain. How can we do something against you? I'll verify it now," said the cyan-skinned Great Ghost Priest and looked at Luo Zheng and the others. 'I'm sorry, ' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>He originally wanted to protect them, but the tides turned entirely as soon as the wolf teeth were involved.</p>

  <p>Not to mention Luo Zheng and his companions, even the status of the humans in the Ghost Mountain would decline.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the cyan-skinned Great Ghost Priest brought the wolf tooth back to the space channel.</p>

  <p>Five more Great Ghost Priests also entered the space channels, including Bainbridge, who had taken Decker away.</p>

  <p>The rest of the six Great Ghost Priests stayed above the Ghost Altar.</p>

  <p>The wolf teeth were highly valuable. Thus, they had to watch over these members of the Element Spirit Civilization.</p>

  <p>The space channels in the Ghost Mountain were not that long.</p>

  <p>Bainbridge carried Decker in his hand. After they passed through the space channel, he entered the third floor of the Ghost Mountain.</p>

  <p>There was a dark passage on the third floor.</p>

  <p>The other Great Ghost Priests moved forward at immensely fast speed while Bainbridge took Decker to another road.</p>

  <p>At that point, Decker regretted everything.</p>

  <p>He estimated that he might not be able to get out of the Ghost Mountain alive.</p>

  <p>However, the members of the Wooden Leaf race never dared to attempt or even imagine to fuse with a hatred-level Treacherous Being.</p>

  <p>As he thought of it, he suddenly felt a sense of satisfaction.</p>

  <p>It was worth dying this way. He felt grateful to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Just as he further drowned in his thoughts, a figure flashed not far away.</p>

  <p>It was a human.</p>

  <p>A human Great Ghost Priest!</p>

  <p>He felt his heart get caught in his throat.</p>

  <p>He, who was timid by nature, suddenly dared to glance stealthily at Bainbridge.</p>

  <p>Bainbridge, who was unaware of what happened, continued to move forward.</p>

  <p>Without any hesitation, Decker shouted at the human Great Ghost Priest with all his might.</p>

  <p>"Human Great Ghost Priest, some humans are looking for you on the Ghost Altar!"</p>
