  <p>
</p>

  <p>The arena had fallen into an eerie silence. No one dared to even breathe in fear of making a sound. They didn't need to speak anyway since their facial expressions were enough to convey their differing thoughts at what had just transpired in front of their very eyes.</p>

  <p>Everyone had thought Luo Luo Zheng was dead meat the moment he set foot in the arena. Even some of the humans had the same thoughts, too.</p>

  <p>The human race had lamented and grieved over the fact that they couldn't protect a talent like Luo Luo Zheng. They would've done all they could but the threat of dragging the entire Purple Heart Sacred Place into trouble hung over them.</p>

  <p>In the end, their weakness forced them to choose the preservation of the sacred place over their treasured talent.</p>

  <p>Malcom, on the other hand, had already planned to kill Luo Luo Zheng as soon as the battle ended.</p>

  <p>As per their way of doing things, once they killed Luo Luo Zheng, they would compensate the humans with ten sacred weapons. It didn't matter whether or not the humans agreed since the weapons were nothing but compensation in order to get out of being punished for breaking the rules.</p>

  <p>Malcom had originally prepared to take action after Luo Luo Zheng had finished the fight with Boris, but Cheryl, who was a divine-level talent in the Demon Night, and also on par with Boris, suddenly came forward and challenged Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>This sudden challenge wasn't something any of them expected and this greatly delayed Malcom's plan. However, he comforted himself with the thought that Luo Luo Zheng would die sooner or later and this was a sentiment shared, not just by the ogres, but by all other creatures in the tower? including the humans.</p>

  <p>However, there was another unexpected twist that suddenly happened. A sword spirit that belonged to the Demon Night suddenly rushed forth from Luo Zheng's body and was found out to be the queen of Demon Night.</p>

  <p>The appearance of this "queen" completely changed the attitude of the entire race. Their initial plan of standing back and staying on the sidelines was quickly chucked out of the window.</p>

  <p>Both Fabian and Jarrod were equally flabbergasted. They really didn't know what was going on!</p>

  <p>Previously, the Demon Night had taken a neutral stance. But now they made a decision that was to the human race's advantage. This decision was born from the fact that whether it be in the Tower of Sin or outside the Cursed Land, the Demon Night refused to lose to the ogre race.</p>

  <p>This sudden realization made both of them smirk.</p>

  <p>"I knew it. I knew it?"</p>

  <p>Olivia muttered repeatedly, her face red with excitement.</p>

  <p>She had noticed that Luo Luo Zheng had been exceptionally confident as if everything was right under his control. At first, she was puzzled and couldn't really pinpoint where his confidence stemmed from.</p>

  <p>But she now understood. Who would've thought Luo Luo Zheng would actually have the queen of Demon Night with him?</p>

  <p>However, despite knowing the reason, Olivia couldn't help but feel as if there was still something strange.</p>

  <p>Just now, Luo Luo Zheng had looked as if he had been caught off-guard when the sword spirit beside him suddenly spoke as if he wasn't expecting it at all.</p>

  <p>So Olivia couldn't be too sure about her earlier assumption. For all she knew, Luo Luo Zheng might've not been aware this entire time and the surprised look on his face was very suspicious.</p>

  <p>She had been observing him for quite a while and could now detect even the slightest changes in his expression.</p>

  <p>But then, if Luo Luo Zheng had not been aware that his sword spirit was actually the queen of the Demon Night, where had he gotten his confidence from when he fought with Boris before? Could it be because he was ignorant of the fact that the one whom he would have to face was none other than the ogre war lord seat holder? Malcom?</p>

  <p>It was all theories and it messed with Olivia's mind.</p>

  <p>Of course, she could not know that Luo Zheng's confidence actually stemmed, not from the Demon Night queen, but from the fact that he had been acknowledged by the Tower of Sin's weapon spirit. He had the power to kick anyone out of the tower at any time.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the atmosphere in the arena grew ever more intense. Even the whispers were gone and a few of the more timid creatures were gradually inching their way towards the exits.</p>

  <p>A fight between the ogre race and Demon Night was bound to be ugly.</p>

  <p>There was no doubt that many of the war lords in the upper floors would involve themselves in the matter and paint the entire tenth floor with blood.</p>

  <p>Malcom stepped forward. "It seems that the Demon Night truly wants to declare war with us," he said, lifting his arm to the audience. His muscles contracted and the wound caused by Elder Mei instantly closed and stopped bleeding.</p>

  <p>A group of ogre war lords was quick to come down from the eleventh floor, their faces looking formidable and their Mu Ning burning with the resolve to fight.</p>

  <p>A lot of creatures in the audience went pale in the face. It truly seemed as if a violent war was about to take place right here on the tenth floor.</p>

  <p>If a battle did start, anyone caught in the middle would surely lose their lives!</p>

  <p>However, no one had the balls to attempt an escape, not under the eyes of so many war lords. Their legs were heavy as lead while the weaker war generals were already trembling with fear from the powerful Mu Ning emitted by the gathered war lords.</p>

  <p>"So many ogre war lords. There are more than sixty of them coming down from the upper floors?"</p>

  <p>Someone murmured as they counted the ogres that were quickly making their way to the tenth floor.</p>

  <p>"Those in the front row are all top-level war lords. They're also the ten great war lords of the ogre race and the seat holders in the Tower of Sin," someone else whispered.</p>

  <p>"That one in front is Maurice! He's ranked second among the 128 seat holders. He could be considered the strongest in the Tower of Sin!"</p>

  <p>Ogre war lords came down from the eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth floors?</p>

  <p>But most terrifying of all were the ten war lords who walked in front. These ten were the most powerful war lords the ogre race had in the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>More than half of the ogres who had seats actually came!</p>

  <p>Maurice, the strongest of them all, held the helm.</p>

  <p>He wore fiery-red armor whose lines spread all throughout, making it seem as if lava itself circulated in his body. Even before his arrival, there had already been a scorching Mu Ning that hung over the entire floor which made people feel as if they were about to face a towering volcano.</p>

  <p>Ogres all had impressive heights and enormous builds so the audience felt as if dozens of small mountains were making their way towards them. The thumping footfalls on the floor were similar to the sound of oncoming giant elephants and it made everyone briefly wonder if the tower could actually handle such heavy steps. They would've made these remarks known if not for the fact that all of them were so scared that they couldn't even breathe.</p>

  <p>Maurice walked over to Malcom. "What happened?" he asked calmly.</p>

  <p>Malcom quickly pointed to Luo Luo Zheng, "I want to kill that brat from the human race but Madeline and Mei from Demon Night stood in my way. They even wounded me!"</p>

  <p>"Oh?"</p>

  <p>Maurice gave both Madeline and Elder Mei an icy glare. "It seems that the Demon Night isn't planning on living peacefully with the ogres?"</p>

  <p>Elder Mei and Madeline were both top-level war lords, the same as Maurice, but they still looked uneasy. The strength of the one hundred and twenty-eight seat holders differed greatly and though Elder Mei was slightly stronger than Malcom, she was still very much weaker than Maurice.</p>

  <p>But that look of unease quickly disappeared when they remembered that Xun was behind them.</p>

  <p>Whether it was against a mere ant or the strongest of all ogres, they would go all out to protect the Demon Night's queen. Both Elder Mei and Madeline would not hesitate to go through fire or tread water, even give up their lives and sell their souls just to protect the queen.</p>

  <p>"There's no such thing as negotiation when it comes to the queen's safety!"</p>

  <p>Elder Mei declared firmly as an overwhelmingly sharp Mu Ning emitted from her body. Her Mu Ning seemed more powerful than the scorching lava-like Mu Ning emitted from Maurice.</p>

  <p>"If that brat dies, we will let bygones be bygones," Maurice said.</p>

  <p>"Our queen is attached to that human's body so he can't die!"</p>

  <p>Elder Mei said firmly.</p>

  <p>A vicious light flashed in Maurice's eyes. "Is that so? If that's how it's gonna be, then let's fight it out!"</p>

  <p>His figure immediately dashed forward, avoiding both Elder Mei and Madeline and making his way towards Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Maurice! How dare you!"</p>

  <p>"Stop!"</p>

  <p>Both Madeline and Elder Mei screamed, their hearts pounding with anxiety as they tried to stop the ogre war lord from touching Luo Luo Zheng. They did not think he would act so recklessly since the Demon Night was still a powerful race. They didn't expect him to be this decisive! Just exactly who had his back?</p>

  <p>They both asked the puzzling question to themselves as they rushed to stop Maurice.</p>

  <p>Could it be that the ogres had acquired some kind of secret weapon? Or maybe they had gotten the backing of some mysterious masters in the Tower of Sin?</p>

  <p>Two huge hands were determined to grab him but Luo Luo Zheng was undaunted. He hurriedly jumped backward and dodged Maurice's attack. He might be brave but he was not stupid and knew when to fight his battles. Even if Luo Luo Zheng refined all the Lucky Light stored in his chest, the most he'd be able to challenge would be a level three or a level four war lord. Maurice was a top-level war lord and the most powerful one at that. He knew he stood no chance against him.</p>

  <p>The moment he saw him attack, Luo Luo Zheng was quick to retreat back from the battle stage.</p>

  <p>Maurice sneered at Luo Zheng's actions, "Brat! You are merely a war fighter. Do you really think you have any chances of escaping?" he sneered.</p>

  <p>Madeline and Elder Mei then suddenly appeared beside Maurice, determined to immobilize him. Meanwhile, Xun, the queen of Demon Night, had gotten her black great sword and raised it high in the air.</p>

  <p>"Stellar Body!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng instantly activated his Stellar Body without hesitation and threw out a punch as he retreated!</p>

  <p>"Star shakes the earth!"</p>
