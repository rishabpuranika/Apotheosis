<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Ben Wang, an inner disciple of the Drizzle Peak in the Cloud Sect, followed other disciples to have a look at the test of the outer disciples.</p>

  <p>There was no need for him to worry as he was at the seventh grade of the nature level. He was much stronger than the one at the eighth place among the inner disciples of the Drizzle Peak.</p>

  <p>A test like today's was normal among the inner disciples of the Drizzle Peak every day. Even the magic array itself was a regular training place for the inner disciples.</p>

  <p>Ben's best performance on the test was a high score of 18 thousand, while the disciple in the eighth place only got 15 thousand. There was a huge gap between them, and Ben thought the latter wouldn't catch up soon.</p>

  <p>But recently he heard a rumor that an outer disciple,  Luo Zheng Luo, would attend the All Peaks Competition representing the Drizzle Peak.</p>

  <p>There were only seven disciples that could attend the All Peaks Competition and they had been chosen by their ranks. If  Luo Zheng Luo would attend the Competition as a disciple of the Drizzle Peak, Ben would lose his qualifications to attend the competition.</p>

  <p>Ben hadn't thought of it first because there was no way an outer disciple could be stronger than an inner disciple. But after the practice of killing demons, another inner disciple, Cleve Lin, had confirmed that Luo Zheng was extremely strong and that he had beaten demon generals.</p>

  <p>Although Cleve was a strong well-ranked inner disciple, he was not as good as those in the top ten. So, what he said could have only been partly true and he was just giving Ben a piece of information.</p>

  <p>Despite that, Ben was still anxious and a little scared. That outer disciple had defeated demon generals, which was something he wasn't sure he could do by himself.</p>

  <p>From this point, Luo Zheng could probably get a place in the top seven to represent the Drizzle Peak.</p>

  <p>Today, the other inner disciples in the upper rank arrived to observe the test with Ben. These were the third-ranked disciple named Glenn, and the fifth-ranked disciple.</p>

  <p>Glenn was a member of the Shi family. He had monitored Luo Zheng since the latter was at the half-step into the nature level. At that time, Glenn had predicted that if Luo Zheng would become an inner disciple, he could even rank as one of the best ten in the inner disciple list.</p>

  <p>However, even if Glenn spoke highly of Luo Zheng, he still believed that the latter needed more time to practice before he could win a place in the inner disciple list.</p>

  <p>But Glenn was still surprised to find out Luo Zheng needed a shorter time than he had expected. Only after a few months, Luo Zheng had reached the nature level. And now here he was, trying to win the seventh position of the inner disciple list.</p>

  <p>Glenn gazed at Luo Zheng from a distance. He could see that Luo Zheng was very confident from his expression. Suddenly, Glenn started to think that Luo Zheng was not only aiming to be part of the top seven but win a higher rank in the disciple list.</p>

  <p>But whatever place Luo Zheng would win, the one to be disqualified was Ben.</p>

  <p>It meant that Luo Zheng was not a threat to Glenn at all. And even if Luo Zheng surpassed his rank, he would still be qualified to participate in the competition.</p>

  <p>When the top thirty outer disciples had finally arrived, the tutor announced the starting of the test.</p>

  <p>The first disciple to take the test was Ziv Zhao, the 30th place on the outer disciple list. Since he had just entered the top thirty outer disciple list, it was impossible for him to win a place of the top ten. However, this test gave him an opportunity to use the magic array for free for his training. To most outer disciples, this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity was quite precious.</p>

  <p>When Ziv went into the magic array, a column of white fog appeared and surrounded him instantly.</p>

  <p>This medium magic array didn't have the ultimate scenario simulation to completely change the surroundings. It could only surround the person who attended the test and made a suitable scenario simulation for that person alone.</p>

  <p>Soon Ziv dramatically quivered and then the fog disappeared slowly.</p>

  <p>The tutor read Ziv's score out loud, "Ziv Zhao, 410 points. Failed."</p>

  <p>If an outer disciple desired to become an inner disciple, the first requirement was to win a place in the outer disciple top ten list. The second requirement was to obtain at least three thousand points. If an outer disciple successfully won a place in the outer disciple top ten list but his points had not reached three thousand points, he could still not become an inner disciple. This could explain that the whole level of the outer disciples was too low, and he did not have the qualification to become an inner disciple.</p>

  <p>But Ziv was still very optimistic. Although he was not satisfied with his performance, he now clearly knew his own strength. For the outer disciples, to know oneself clearly was a good strong point.</p>

  <p>Some warriors had excellent talents and never met obstacles in their practice. They always wanted to win regardless of anyone who they fought with. If the warrior was narrow-minded, his defeat wouldn't give him the right idea to strengthen himself further. And this would create a huge barrier on his upgrading way and his achievement would be impossible to meet.</p>

  <p>"The second one, Xu!"</p>

  <p>"The third one..."</p>

  <p>A disciple would averagely consume five minutes for the test. Some of them would take longer than ten minutes.</p>

  <p>The points of the disciple went higher as the test moved forward.</p>

  <p>The 13th disciple so far had the highest score at 3, 100 points.</p>

  <p>This meant the thirteenth disciple had the qualification to be an inner disciple. But another requirement would still depend on the remaining twelve outer disciples' performances.</p>

  <p>If from the remaining disciples, three got a score of less than three thousand, the 13th disciple could have the opportunity to be an inner disciple. But the chance of that was still very slim.</p>

  <p>From the success of the thirteenth disciple, it could be concluded that the level of the Drizzle Peak had improved. This would make the competition even more challenging.</p>

  <p>As the 12th, the 11th and the 10th completed their tests, it was announced that they all got more than 3, 000 points.</p>
