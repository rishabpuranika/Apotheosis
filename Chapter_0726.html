  <p>
</p>

  <p>Eden didn't get angry at Yudie's sarcastic remarks. Instead, he continued to smile and said, "Is Lady Ning Yudie referring to the differences between our realms and cultivation? If you really think so, I have to admit I don't meet the requirements at the moment. But, I do have a divine level talent. So, it's just a matter of time before I step into the Virtual Tribulation Realm. With luck, I'll be able to make a breakthrough in the Virtual Tribulation Realm and become even stronger."</p>

  <p>"Divine-level talent!"</p>

  <p>"Is he bragging? When did divine-level talent appear in the Central Region?"</p>

  <p>"According to historical records, up until now, divine-level talent hasn't been seen in the Central Region. Only six warriors, possessing divine-level talent, have appeared in the four divine kingdoms, and each of them established a divine kingdom of their own later!"</p>

  <p>"I can't imagine such a person really exists. A powerful father plus he has divine-level talent, he truly is amazing!"</p>

  <p>Hearing the warriors discuss about him, the corners of Eden's mouth curved slightly upward in a proud grin.</p>

  <p>Listening to what was being said, Brent from the Ethereal Spirit Sect turned to Philip, who was next to him, and hurriedly said, "Philip, he says that he has divine-level talent, too! But, didn't you tell me that divine-level talent is very rare?"</p>

  <p>Philip sighed and rolled his eyes but kept quiet. Brent was really troublesome.</p>

  <p>In fact, Philip agreed, inwardly. He found it strange that there were such a large number of people possessing outstanding qualities coming from the Central Region in recent years. It was as though the disciples' strengths in the various sects had reached new heights overnight! In the past, it was a rarity for a top disciple from a great sect to understand even a trace of the Law Power while he was in the Internal Elixir Realm. But, over the last decade, there were more and more refiners at the Internal Elixir Realm emerging who had mastered the Law Power.</p>

  <p>It was as if geniuses sprang up everywhere suddenly.</p>

  <p>At one time, a warrior possessing heaven-level talent was a highly valued member of the sect. Warriors with saint-level talent were even rarer, and every few decades, one would appear. But now, no less than ten warriors possessed the saint-level talent at the Ethereal Spirit Sect, and there was even one with divine-level talent.</p>

  <p>What was happening in the Central Region? How was it possible for it to suddenly become so remarkable that so many outstanding talents were springing up?</p>

  <p>"The divine-level talent?"</p>

  <p>The group of disciples from Cloud Hall thought Eden was overly arrogant, and especially Benson, and he hoped that he'd have the chance to knock this brat down a peg or two with his fist soon, in the arena.</p>

  <p>However, after discovering that Eden was a divine-level talent, Benson felt a bit powerless.</p>

  <p>As a warrior with heaven-level talent, Benson was already a top elite of Cloud Hall. If what Eden had was saint-level talent, Benson would have been able to accept it. But, it turned out that Eden actually had divine-level talent!</p>

  <p>According to legend, a warrior with divine-level talent was destined to be emperor in the future and could become the top ruler of this diverse world and from there, dominate the whole universe!</p>

  <p>He wondered, was it really true that the guy standing in front of him could achieve that?</p>

  <p>"Enough of this! Eden, this is the Martial Arts Contest. Put up or shut up!"</p>

  <p>Benson approached Eden, signaling the start of the match. "Please!" he said, politely.</p>

  <p>However, Eden turned a blind eye to Benson's gesture. He smiled at Ning Yudie and said, "Lady Ning Yudie, please accept this gift as a token, from me!"</p>

  <p>With Yudie's hot temper, she could have scolded the brat earlier and kicked him from the stage. But, as the leader of Cloud Hall, she had to give due consideration to the overall situation. Eddie was sitting in his seat, making no comment, making it obvious to her that he had given his consent to this proposal.</p>

  <p>What the hell were they up to?</p>

  <p>Just then, laughter broke out from below and a voice firmly said, "Ha-ha, you want to marry our leader with a mere sacred weapon? Do you think the leader of Cloud Hall is a child, who can be lured away with candy easily?</p>

  <p>You have made a good plan but you shouldn't have made it in the first place!"</p>

  <p>It was Luo Luo Zheng speaking.</p>

  <p>Eden's face darkened immediately.</p>

  <p>Although some warriors had said rude things about his behavior earlier, Eden couldn't lose his temper at any of them. After all, there were too many of them. However, none of them dared to speak out like Luo Luo Zheng did, publicly.</p>

  <p>After all, anyone dared to do that had to consider Eden's identity, and his father's influence.</p>

  <p>"A sacred weapon?" Eden glared coldly at Luo Luo Zheng and demanded, "Who do you think you are? What makes you qualified to judge a sacred weapon?</p>

  <p>Have you even seen one in your life?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smacked his lips, shook his head, and said, "You're so naive to show off a sacred weapon, and it's only a crown!"</p>

  <p>As soon as Luo Luo Zheng finished talking, he walked over to Ning Yudie quickly. As he walked, he tapped the space ring Ning Yudie had given him. There was a flash of light as he pulled a body protection garment out of the space ring.</p>

  <p>"Tia, this body protection garment isn't pretty, but, it is also a sacred weapon." As he explained, Luo Luo Zheng closed the distance between Ning Yudie and himself and put the body protection garment which he got from the Upper World on her.</p>

  <p>When Ning Yudie saw the body protection garment, she was shocked. But, before she could check the value of the body protection garment, it dawned on her that Luo Luo Zheng had actually called her Tia in front of all these people!</p>

  <p>Yudie's face flushed with anger. As she opened her mouth to tell Luo Luo Zheng off, he pulled the garment over her, catching her off guard.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie froze.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did this intimate act in front of hundreds of thousands of warriors!</p>

  <p>Although warriors didn't usually care much about propriety, and were more tolerant about female warrior's mannerisms, Ning Yudie was the leader of Cloud Hall, and no disciples had ever dared assist in dressing her!</p>

  <p>Then again, she wondered, was this body protection garment really a sacred weapon? It didn't look like one.</p>

  <p>However, as soon as Ning Yudie was ensconced in the garment, it emitted a bright light that resembled ripples on a lake. The ripples intertwined together, forming a small protective shield that covered her entire body!</p>

  <p>At the same time, a warm feeling spread throughout Yudie's body. She felt her physical strength increasing by forty percent at least!</p>

  <p>Who would've thought the body protection garment would have such an effect! It was definitely one of the sacred weapons!</p>

  <p>Wrapped up in the warm shield, Ning Yudie no longer thought about Luo Zheng's offensive behavior moments ago. Ning Yudie very clearly knew the value of the body protection garment.</p>

  <p>Defensive weapons were more sought after than offensive ones!</p>

  <p>There were no mid-grade sacred weapons in the Central Region. However, if anyone offered a mid-grade sacred weapon in exchange for the body protection garment, she would turn them down. She would be a fool to take the offer!</p>

  <p>"The body protection garment... is indeed a sacred weapon!" exclaimed Ning Yudie smiling. "It is a little unsightly, but I can make do!"</p>

  <p>'Make do? It's a sacred weapon!' Many warriors' hearts were jolted hearing Yudie's remarks.</p>

  <p>Obviously, she was directing her comments especially in Eden's face!</p>

  <p>"Sorry, it's the only one I have. I promise, I will find a beautiful one for you next time!" Luo Zheng's voice softened and he smiled faintly.</p>

  <p>Flop!</p>

  <p>Jaws dropped at the staggering conversation.</p>

  <p>"The body protection garment really is a sacred weapon. Oh my god? The value of the body protection garment surpasses that of the Ethereal Spirit Sect's Soul Flag, most likely, along with the World Commercial Alliance's Time Copper Coin, and Eddie's Nameless Saber. It will become our most valuable treasure in the Central Region!"</p>

  <p>"Wow, Luo Luo Zheng is quite bold. He's made a mockery of Eden's Heavenly Feather Crown. Eden would probably be so anxious that he will want to dig a hole in the ground and vanish into it! And Luo Luo Zheng promised to find another beautiful one? Is it so easy to find sacred weapons?"</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng's so generous! He actually got a sacred weapon and gave it to someone else randomly."</p>

  <p>"What's the relationship between Ning Yudie and Luo Luo Zheng? He's clearly a disciple of Cloud Hall, but he didn't follow Yudie's orders, and he even called her Tia!</p>

  <p>What's going on between the two of them?"</p>

  <p>As the crowd continued to discuss the garment, Luo Luo Zheng and Ning Yudie, Eden's face darkened.</p>

  <p>This guy, he was only at the fourth level in the Illuminating Soul Realm, and here he pulled out a sacred weapon, a body protection garment and just casually gave it away!</p>

  <p>Although the Heavenly Feather Crown was a sacred weapon as well, it was a crown which was only an accessory after all, when compared to the far more precious body protection garment.</p>

  <p>The biggest issue Eden had was who fashioned the body protection garment? Why was it so ugly?</p>

  <p>It would never cross his mind that the sacred weapon was a uniform for common officers and warriors at the Dragon Abyss Palace. Almost everyone there had a suit like that one. The body protection garment was designed with maximize function in mind, and style was less important.</p>

  <p>The three fat leaders of the World Commercial Alliance exchanged a glance with each other, and their eyes were filled with disbelief.</p>

  <p>Actually, the World Commercial Alliance didn't have only the one sacred weapon known to the public knew as the Time Copper Coin.</p>

  <p>However, the other two sacred weapons that the World Commercial Alliance never disclosed to the public couldn't hold a candle to the body protection garment that Luo Luo Zheng gave Ning Yudie.</p>
