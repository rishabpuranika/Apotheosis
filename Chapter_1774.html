</p>

  <p>The blazing white light appeared, and the power of the Space Law enveloped them both. Geoffrey shut his eyes tight and when he opened them again, he could only see a trace of a blazing white light around him.</p>

  <p>The power of the Space Law had already started to dissipate.</p>

  <p>Zheng and Geoffrey had already penetrated the enchanted barrier by now.</p>

  <p>"My master has told me that the Light of Water is so powerful that even someone who is proficient in the Space Law can't penetrate it!" Geoffrey recited.</p>

  <p>"Master? Which master?" Zheng asked, curious.</p>

  <p>"My master's surname is Zong," Geoffrey replied.</p>

  <p>Zheng immediately knew the 'master' Geoffrey was referring to. It was Felix, the chief rune expert of the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>Zheng hadn't expected Felix to be the one to have imparted the divine texture skill to Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>"Wow! So high! So high!"</p>

  <p>Zheng flew higher and higher, leaving the clouds far below. They looked like white sea water, rolling slowly beneath him. Geoffrey cried out excitedly, completely forgetting about how terrifying Zheng was.</p>

  <p>"Father, if we keep flying like this, can we reach the Upper World?"</p>

  <p>Geoffrey asked suddenly.</p>

  <p>Zheng thought for a moment, and then replied with a slow smile taking its place on his face, "Sure."</p>

  <p>If one could withstand the ravages of the strong gales, they actually could go all the way up into the universe.</p>

  <p>"Grandma said that mother has gone to the Upper World. If we keep flying like this, will we be able to find my mother?" Geoffrey asked again.</p>

  <p>This child's thoughts!</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled faintly. If they didn't go through the ascending passageway and ascended through the space of the universe, it would take a lot of time for an ordinary Soul Sea Realm warrior to reach the nearest supreme world.</p>

  <p>But whatever it was, the little guy was still too young and Zheng would obviously not explain all of this to him. He only smiled and said, "Your mother will come back."</p>

  <p>"When will mother be back?" Geoffrey asked, his eyes lighting up.</p>

  <p>Zheng stared into the distance, to the end of the sea of clouds, and then answered firmly, "It shouldn't be too long. You will definitely meet her in half a month."</p>

  <p>Zheng hoped that Yudie would not encounter something bad or stray into dangerous areas while she traveled through the ascending passageway.</p>

  <p>At this thought, he remembered the terrible back side of the universe with a jolt. If the universe were to be dissected, space would be divided into the front side and the back side.</p>

  <p>The back side was not an independent world, but it complemented the familiar space of the world as a shadow followed the person.</p>

  <p>But a vast majority of creatures did not like living on the back side where sunlight could not reach. There was no life vitality there, nor were there living beings. It was empty.</p>

  <p>The sorcerer race was the only race that lived at the back side of the world.</p>

  <p>This race was too mysterious. There had been a Supreme Lord who had investigated them before, but had come up empty-handed. What was more, he had gotten into a lot of trouble, the least of which were the countless small skulls that covered his body.</p>

  <p>These skulls hadn't caused any damage to the Supreme Lord but no one had been able to destroy or even remove them. The Supreme Lord had, in the end, used a complicated method to dispel the curses and banish them.</p>

  <p>Over time, no one was willing to get into such trouble.</p>

  <p>What did the sorcerer race rely on to survive? What were they planning?</p>

  <p>The secrets of this race became more and more mysterious as time passed.</p>

  <p>The Celestial Position had recently revealed the news and only a few of the upper-level masters in the universe knew that this was a conspiracy that had lasted for hundreds of billions of years.</p>

  <p>Even a Supreme Lord wouldn't do anything to meddle in the conspiracy because they would be unable to make any changes.</p>

  <p>This was a game that only True Gods and Holy Beings could participate in.</p>

  <p>It was a pity that the grand era of the universe was nearing an end.</p>

  <p>The game was about to start, which was why the situation had become so intense. The universe itself had become more sensitive and powerful, causing talents to appear from everywhere.</p>

  <p>It was most peculiar in the great world where Zheng resided. A warrior with the first-rank Purple Power Body had appeared there. Besides, it also was home to extremely powerful talents like Tianming and Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng thought it was a coincidence.</p>

  <p>But the sorcerer race and Master Feng didn't think so. In reality, once Zheng had left, Master Feng had already completed the first round of arrangement.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey ultimately had Zheng's blood running through his veins, which was why they'd only needed a few days to get familiar with each other even though it was the first time they had met.</p>

  <p>The little guy was mischievous, but was also extremely intelligent.</p>

  <p>He seemed to have countless questions running through his mind. The moment he came to be with Zheng, he raised all of the questions one by one.</p>

  <p>"Dad, why should a warrior cultivate?" Geoffrey asked.</p>

  <p>The question sounded simple. Idiotic, even. But it tugged at Zheng's heart, rendering him speechless and wondering how to answer this question.</p>

  <p>He thought for a moment before smiling and saying, "We cultivate in order to protect the people around us. If there are bad guys bullying you, then I can help you punish them."</p>

  <p>"But why do warriors have to ascend to the Upper World? Isn't this world good?" To Geoffrey, the Central Region was already huge.</p>

  <p>It was boundless for mortals and flying into the Upper World was not a good choice. The Upper World was not a fairyland, but a world where competitions were even crueler.</p>

  <p>"In order to become stronger," Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey was relentless. "Why do we have to become stronger?"</p>

  <p>The question was a hard one to answer and soon fell into a cycle of logic.</p>

  <p>One had to trace back to the first batch of creatures that had been born from the chaos to find the most basic answer. Why would the divine land appear from the chaos? When did the various Holy Beings in the divine land develop a sense of competition?</p>

  <p>What kind of an achievement would it be once one had reached the peak of martial arts?</p>

  <p>Zheng would eventually find the answer, but he couldn't answer Geoffrey's question right now.</p>

  <p>So he answered Geoffrey honestly, "I don't know either."</p>

  <p>Geoffrey was curious. He thought Zheng to be an omnipotent warrior. He hadn't thought that there was something his father didn't know.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you when I find out," Geoffrey said seriously, blinking.</p>

  <p>At Geoffrey's words, Zheng suddenly laughed. "Finding the answer to this question is not an easy task," he said, chuckling.</p>

  <p>"I'm not afraid of difficulties," Geoffrey said, still very serious.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey had such ambitions at such a young age, which pleased Zheng.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey probably hadn't even understood what he was really looking for. But with this determination, many difficult things would become very easy for him.</p>

  <p>Days passed in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>On the twelfth day, Zheng still hadn't detected any fluctuations in the great world.</p>

  <p>But he hadn't expected Lawson and Nathan to cause trouble.</p>

  <p>The two of them had gone to the Central Region, and had been injured when they returned.</p>

  <p>Lawson had sustained serious injuries, his body covered in thin cuts. It looked like he had been wounded by a sharp weapon.</p>

  <p>Nathan was also injured and looked to be in a very sorry state.</p>
