<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Patrick, Tianming, and Lewis were all now disciples in the Elite House of the Cloud Hall, and had received the best training from it. They had made incredible progress in the past few months. For instance, Tianming had comprehended two laws in the cultivation of Extreme Thunder Sword Intent, namely the Metal Law and the Thunder Law. Although he didn't get much Law Power, only one or two among thousands of cultivators were able to comprehend the laws. Moreover, Tianming was only at the Illuminating Soul Realm, so one could imagine just how gifted he was.</p>

  <p>Patrick also had improved a lot in his strength. He could now summon the Acalanatha continuously without taking a break at the intervals. In addition, the Acalanatha had a second pair of arms. In the Vajrayana, the strongest Acalanatha had six arms, which meant that Patrick still had a lot of room for improvement.</p>

  <p>Lewis, on the other hand, didn't advance as fast as the other two did.</p>

  <p>However, his bodily movement skill was becoming more and more unfathomable. He could almost approach his opponent without casting a shadow and could leave without a trace.</p>

  <p>Their rapid progress in the cultivation made them very proud in the Elite House of the Cloud Hall. They believed that it would not be long before they were able to rank among the top in the Elite House.</p>

  <p>However, when they discovered that Zheng was in the arena, they suddenly felt that the achievements they had been so proud of seemed to have become a joke now.</p>

  <p>Before they arrived in the Oracle City, they previously discussed the Martial Arts Contest along the way.</p>

  <p>The strongest disciples of each sect gathered to compete in the Martial Arts Contest, and it was a showdown among the Internal Elixir Realm masters.</p>

  <p>Tianming had complained about how the Martial Arts Contest was held a few years in advance. If the plan hadn't changed, he would have a few more years to practice. Once he reached the Internal Elixir Realm, he would have the opportunity to participate in the contest.</p>

  <p>Lewis had mocked Tianming that even if he was given a few more times, he still might not be qualified to participate in the Martial Arts Contest. In turn, Tianming got so irritated that he even placed his sword on Lewis' neck to shut him up.</p>

  <p>However...</p>

  <p>Zheng had already stood on the arena of the Martial Arts Contest.</p>

  <p>"His cultivation base has improved quite rapidly. In less than half a year, he has reached the fourth level of the Illuminating Soul Realm from the nature level. But...</p>

  <p>Why is he allowed to compete here, considering the gap between his level and the Internal Elixir Realm?" Patrick said. A lot of doubts crossed his mind.</p>

  <p>"Don't forget that back when he was in the Cloud Sect, he defeated a bunch of Illuminating Soul Realm warriors when he was just at the nature level.</p>

  <p>Now that Zheng has reached the Illuminating Soul Realm, it is possible that he has the ability to fight against those Internal Elixir Realm warriors!" Tianming said and shook his head.</p>

  <p>Tianming's words fell on a warrior's ears who stood next to him. The warrior's face darkened.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean possible? The brat only got a bit lucky. I'm sure he won't survive this fight. The disciple of the Bloodwood Cliff will definitely beat him!" he said.</p>

  <p>The warrior who spoke to them was a member of the Gongsun Clan.</p>

  <p>Although he was not a core disciple, he had strong sense of honor to his family. He was quite unhappy to hear what Tianming had said.</p>

  <p>"Lucky?" Tianming smiled. "It seems that we have missed a match. Zheng has already fought and won one," Tianming said to Patrick.</p>

  <p>"However, this round doesn't look too good for Zheng. The person from the Bloodwood Cliff is not easy to deal with," Patrick said and fixed his eyes firmly on the arena.</p>

  <p>They came from the same sect as Zheng and entered the Cloud Hall together.</p>

  <p>They got a bit worried when they saw how extremely powerful Zheng's opponent was.</p>

  <p>"Oh, he won't survive this! No way! It's an Internal Elixir Realm master on the other side!" Lewis cried out. However, Tianming just raised his eyebrows and a smile graced his lips.</p>

  <p>"I don't know why, I have the hunch that Zheng will…</p>

  <p>Zheng will win all the way through to the end!</p>

  <p>Lewis, give me all your money!"</p>

  <p>"What are you trying to do?" Lewis subconsciously held on tight to his space ring. He was the one who had reaped the most benefits from their mission because he had an advantage in speed and bodily movement. Thus, he had obtained a lot of life vitality crystals from the mission.</p>

  <p>"Don't be nervous," Tianming said and reached out a hand. "Did you see the sign over there? The odds are out, and the odds against Zheng are shockingly high. I want to take a gamble!" he explained.</p>

  <p>Tianming wasn't a gambler, but he felt that Zheng always had a good luck on his side. He just wanted to see if his hunch was right.</p>

  <p>"Nope!" Lewis screamed. "Give them to me!" Tianming said coldly.</p>

  <p>"No!" The two of them continued to grapple for the money in Lewis' space ring.</p>

  <p>A gust of wind gently flew by, and the tip of Tianming's sword was pressed against Lewis' neck once again.</p>

  <p>Lewis sighed. It seemed that he would never win as long as Tianming could threaten him.</p>

  <p>He couldn't do anything but hand over his money to Tianming in resignation.</p>

  <p>Just after Tianming had placed his stake, the luminous curtain in the center of the arena disappeared, and the battle between  Zheng Luo and Brody Bu began.</p>
