<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 984 First Grade Purple Power Body </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The purple flames that erupted from Margaret's belly wrapped around her body, and then she began to fall down.</p>

  <p>"Look! A giant fireball is falling from the sky!"</p>

  <p>"Oh my god! It has smashed Wang's house!"</p>

  <p>"There's someone inside the fireball. Is it a martial artist?"</p>

  <p>Most of the people left in Fire City were ordinary mortals. The martial artists with higher cultivation had left the city to go with their respective sects.</p>

  <p>For mortals, the war between different sects wasn't important to them.</p>

  <p>Even if the times had changed, they would have lived the same life. No matter who ruled this continent, he wouldn't make things difficult for mortals.</p>

  <p>Somehow, Mu Ning had managed to smash a tile roof house. The fierce purple flames were still burning, making it impossible for the people outside to get close.</p>

  <p>There were still some martial artists left in the city. Before long, three martial artists who had reached the nature level rushed over. But when they saw the purple flames, their expressions immediately changed.</p>

  <p>The power of the purple fire was so daunting that they didn't dare to approach it. They could only watch as the flames continued to burn until the house was completely reduced to ashes.</p>

  <p>"There's a person in the fire!"</p>

  <p>"The purple flames can't even burn him. He must be a peerless powerhouse!"</p>

  <p>"You're right. I wonder where he's from and why he came to our city."</p>

  <p>Having only a fair amount of experience, the three martial artists didn't know what exactly was going on.</p>

  <p>After a short period of coma, Mu Ning slowly woke up. After that, she entered a very strange state, and the talent of her Purple Power Body was quickly activated.</p>

  <p>Those who had Purple Power Bodies could communicate with the Purple Power World. Furthermore, they could even cultivate in that place.</p>

  <p>However, every Purple Power Body was activated at a different time.</p>

  <p>Back then, Marilyn forcibly activated her Purple Power Body with the secret method that Eddie sought for her sake, and she had also kept her virginity energy for Eddie.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, Mu Ning activated her body after her virginity energy was taken, so the effects were completely different.</p>

  <p>Although the Purple Power Body was rare, there were countless living creatures in the universe who possessed such. Several girls in the Central Region had Purple Power Bodies, so it meant that there were a considerable number of Purple Power Bodies in the entire universe. The Purple Power Body could be at one of six grades.</p>

  <p>The humans in the Upper World divided the six grades according to their colors. They were light-purple, cyan-purple, red-purple, blue-purple, exact-purple, and black-purple.</p>

  <p>Among them, black-purple was the highest grade, and light-purple was the lowest grade. Margaret's Purple Power Body was at the black-purple grade, which was also considered as the first grade.</p>

  <p>The higher the grade of the Purple Power Body, the easier it was for the owner to communicate with the Purple Power World, and thus, the more abundant the resources she could obtain from the Purple Power World.</p>

  <p>Only when the first grade Purple Power Body was activated could the owner be wrapped up by the purple fire, and no one else could get close to her.</p>

  <p>The purple fire was exceptionally substantial. Let alone the three martial artists who had reached the nature level, even those at the Internal Elixir and Virtual Tribulation Realms didn't have the ability to approach a woman with a first grade Purple Power Body. Even the martial artists at the Life and Death Realm had to use their full strength to resist the purple fire at the bare minimum.</p>

  <p>The purple flames burned day and night.</p>

  <p>That was something significant for the Fire City. It had attracted countless commoners, martial artists at the nature level and Illuminating Soul Realm, but no one was able to figure out what was really happening.</p>

  <p>Finally, the three remaining martial artists at the Internal Elixir Realm in Fire City had also arrived, but, just like the rest, none of them attempted to approach the purple flames either.</p>

  <p>After a day and a night, the purple flames finally began to diffuse.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning, who was sitting cross-legged within the purple flames, slowly opened her eyes. In just twenty-four hours, her temperament had undergone such a drastic change.</p>

  <p>In those hours that passed, Mu Ning did nothing else but cultivate in the Purple Power World. Not only did she understand the rules of the Purple Power World, but she also knew the secrets there and acknowledged just how superlative her own talent was.</p>

  <p>The Purple Power Body was a special martial path which was very different from that of ordinary martial artists. It was a shortcut, but once one took the first step, she would be limited by the innate talent of her Purple Power Body. For girls who had sixth grade Purple Power Bodies, they could never be able to have the fifth grade Purple Power Bodies in their lifetime regardless of their cultivation base.</p>

  <p>Only Mu Ning possessed a first grade Purple Power Body.</p>

  <p>"I never thought that there would be such a delicate girl within this purple fire."</p>

  <p>"She's such a pretty young lady. She has already stepped into the Internal Elixir Realm at such a young age. She must come from a great clan."</p>

  <p>The onlookers began to guess Margaret's origin and identity.</p>

  <p>The eyes of the three martial artists at the Internal Elixir Realm who were standing not too far away flashed. They looked at each other, unpleasant smiles painted all over their faces.</p>

  <p>For the martial artists at the Illuminating Soul Realm and the nature level, Mu Ning was a force to be reckoned with. But for the three gutsy martial artists, her name wasn't even worth mentioning.</p>

  <p>Although the girl in front of them had reached the primary level of the Internal Elixir Realm and her foundation was very stable, her life vitality was another story.</p>

  <p>Having an unstable life vitality meant that she was extremely weak.</p>

  <p>From the looks of it, one could definitely say that the girl hailed from a big, wealthy family.</p>

  <p>According to the information they had received, Eddie was already attacking the Ethereal Spirit Sect. Maybe, she was a martial artist that had escaped from a third-grade clan in Ethereal City.</p>

  <p>Even if she had no treasures in her possession, they thought that her delicate body was more than enough to compensate.</p>

  <p>The martial artist with a mustache walked over and politely asked,</p>

  <p>"Miss, is there anything I can help you with?"</p>

  <p>It was obvious that Mu Ning didn't have much confidence whenever Luo Zheng was around, but she sure looked down on other normal martial artists.</p>

  <p>As she was about to fly up, she gave the mustached man a cold look.</p>

  <p>However, the other two martial artists were one step ahead of her, blocking her path.</p>

  <p>"What's with the hurry? Since you've come all the way to Fire City, you should have a good rest before leaving."</p>

  <p>"That's right. How about having a drink with us?"</p>

  <p>Before Margaret's Purple Power Body was activated, it was really difficult for her to get rid of those three men. Although they were at the primary level of the Internal Elixir Realm and came from a second-grade sect, they were not that powerful at all. But at that particular time, Mu Ning was still so much weaker than them.</p>

  <p>However, she had already achieved a complete transformation.</p>

  <p>"Get out of my way!" Mu Ning disdainfully said.</p>

  <p>"Don't be so rude," one of the three men retorted.</p>

  <p>The other mustached man giggled loudly and said, "It doesn't matter if she's rude. I like rude girls!</p>

  <p>When beauties are being rude, they look much prettier."</p>

  <p>Hearing that, Margaret's eye twitched. The three martial artists suddenly felt a powerful wind blowing. Then, some dark shadows appeared in the sky.</p>

  <p>As soon as they raised their heads, hundreds of giant ancient swords had emerged in the sky.</p>

  <p>Each of these swords was several dozen feet long, hanging in the air as if they could fall down at any moment.</p>

  <p>"What... What's going on?"</p>

  <p>"Why are there so many swords in the sky? Where did they all come from?"</p>

  <p>As Mu Ning cleared her throat loudly, the huge swords smashed down on the three martial artists at once.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>The swords smashed into the ground, creating deep cracks. Fire City wasn't big, so when these swords crashed right through, it caused the entire city to shake. Those who didn't know what was happening thought it was just an earthquake that hit them.</p>

  <p>The swords covered a vast area when they fell. The three martial artists wanted to dodge, but it was already too late. They didn't even have the time to scream. Death, a gory one, came after them really quickly.</p>

  <p>With a smug look on her face, Mu Ning then flew into the sky. That was the first time she had ever killed fellow martial artists.</p>

  <p>After Mu Ning flew high up in the sky, a trace of hesitation appeared on her face. She didn't know whether she should return to Ethereal City or go to Cloudy City. As she looked towards the direction where Luo Zheng had disappeared, a hint of grief appeared in her eyes. Eventually, she decided to fly to Cloudy City.</p>

  <p>The experiences she had in the Purple Power World had allowed her to know her own potential and true strength. Unlike before, she now had a bit of confidence in her own abilities.</p>

  <p id="top_16">Despite everything that she had accomplished, she still didn't know what she genuinely wanted.</p>
