<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>For the vast majority of Eternal Realm warriors, the Grand Pure Realm was equivalent to Stage Thirty-three because they would never be able to go to the Supreme Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>The Land of Diabolic Demons was the most dangerous place in the Grand Pure Realm where survival was nigh impossible.</p>

  <p>Each and every Eternal Realm warrior who dared pass through the Stage End Passage would have to risk their lives.</p>

  <p>This led to a lot of them refusing to explore the Three Purities Stage altogether. Instead, they chose to stay in the Grand Plain Stage where it was safe and they'd be able to stay long there.</p>

  <p>"Did you fall on the edge of the Land of Diabolic Demons and escape?"</p>

  <p>Fuxi asked.</p>

  <p>Zheng had actually fallen into the inside of the Diabolic Earth, which should be the worst situation.</p>

  <p>But Zheng just nodded. "I was able to escape. I'm opposite the Spirit Disappearing Peak and the Soul Dissipating Peak now. You and the Snake Goddess can go there and easily find me."</p>

  <p>"Opposite the Spirit Disappearing Peak and the Soul Dissipating Peak?" the Snake Goddess repeated. "You are not far away from the Land of Diabolic Demons. That place is still very dangerous."</p>

  <p>Zheng merely shrugged. "They shouldn't be able to find me."</p>

  <p>The entirety of the Land of Diabolic Demons had since turned into a dead area, which would make it difficult for the two remaining kings to find him.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess and Fuxi exchanged glances.</p>

  <p>It would be quite risky to venture so close to the Land of Diabolic Demons but since it was Zheng, they definitely had to go.</p>

  <p>"Don't go to the Other Shore for the time being," Fuxi told him. "You can go back after we arrive at the Spirit Disappearing Peak and the Soul Dissipating Peak."</p>

  <p>Soon enough, the Snake Goddess and Fuxi sat cross-legged, opposite Zheng, and entered the Other Shore together.</p>

  <p>Zheng sensed the fear in their hearts, yet he couldn't help but admire their willingness to take the risk with no evident hesitation.</p>

  <p>The two had stayed in the Grand Pure Realm for a really long time so they were naturally very familiar with it.</p>

  <p>Fuxi's Augury Dog was also of great help since he was able to foretell the dangers that hid in every corner. This ability surely came in handy to warn them in advance of any untoward incident heading their way.</p>

  <p>After half a day's journey, Fuxi and the Snake Goddess arrived at the west side of the Land of Diabolic Demons.</p>

  <p>A strange feeling rose in their chests as they looked towards that forsaken land in the distance.</p>

  <p>"Did the color of the Land of Diabolic Demons change?" Fuxi asked, confusion evident on his face. The Snake Goddess could only stare at the horizon, lost in thought.</p>

  <p>For many years, the Diabolic Earth was blood-red. In fact, it was said that it was actually a living creature and the Diabolic Demons that roamed the land were birthed by the earth itself.</p>

  <p>Since it had turned black, then did that mean that the Diabolic Earth had become stronger?</p>

  <p>Of course, it wasn't the time to instigate an investigation. They might be outstanding Eternal Realm warriors but the Land of Diabolic Demons was a scary place, even for them.</p>

  <p>"We should go north and make a safe detour."</p>

  <p>"North, and then go parallel to the Land of Diabolic Demons. We'll be safe and reach Zheng in no time."</p>

  <p>The two ventured forth once they came into an agreement. The Augury Dog followed closely behind Fuxi as they journeyed on. "This is one of the most dangerous places in the Grand Pure Realm, yet I don't sense any danger at all. It's quite strange," he muttered in observation.</p>

  <p>Last time the Augury Dog followed Fuxi into the Land of Diabolic Demons, he had spent the entire time urging Fuxi to leave due to the extreme danger he felt from all over the place.</p>

  <p>This time, though, he felt no danger at all. The entire Land of Diabolic Demons felt peaceful in its dead silence.</p>

  <p>"It is quite strange. Look," the Snake Goddess said as she pointed towards the distance. dozens of deer were feasting on plants on the black Diabolic Earth peacefully. There were no signs of any Diabolic Demons around.</p>

  <p>"Those Diabolic Demons have a strong sense of territory. They would never allow deer to approach their land. Where in the world are they?" Fuxi asked in concern due to the strangeness of the situation. The two companions' hearts sank at a sudden realization.</p>

  <p>"Is it the Element Spirit Civilization or the Nihility race?" the Snake Goddess murmured with a frown. Diabolic Demons expanded their territory at an extremely slow rate and usually stayed within the Diabolic Earth in fierce protectiveness of their land. The Element Spirit Civilization and the Nihility race wouldn't dare to provoke them, would they?</p>

  <p>Aside from these two forces, there wasn't really anyone else who could wipe out the Diabolic Demons.</p>

  <p>Halfway through their journey, Fuxi tried to approach the edge of the Diabolic Earth but still did not see any Diabolic Demons.</p>

  <p>The situation was very strange but they came here for one thing only. Once they arrived at Zheng's location, they immediately retreated from the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>When they returned, the Snake Goddess was quick to ask Zheng about the situation. "Zheng, did you see any Diabolic Demons when you fell into the Land of Diabolic Demons?"</p>

  <p>The two waited for his answer with bated breath.</p>

  <p>"Of course," Zheng answered readily.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess's eyes flashed. "Were they alive?" she specified.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded. "Yes."</p>

  <p>"Then can you explain to us why all the Diabolic Demons in the entire land seemed to have disappeared, or perhaps died?" Fuxi asked. His voice had been loud and attracted other people's attention.</p>

  <p>"What did he say?"</p>

  <p>"All the Diabolic Demons died?"</p>

  <p>"Then that means the land is now abandoned?"</p>

  <p>"Isn't that good then? The Eternal Realm warriors will now feel safer."</p>

  <p>Zheng sported a faint smile on his face. "Not all of them died. There are still two kings left but I don't know where they are."</p>

  <p>"Two kings?" the Snake Goddess repeated. "What about the others?"</p>

  <p>Zheng shrugged nonchalantly. "I poisoned them to death."</p>

  <p>Fuxi already kind of suspected Zheng had something to do with the sudden disappearance of the Diabolic Demons but it was still surreal to hear him admit it in person. He had to take a deep breath to stabilize his heart. The young man had just arrived yet he had already exterminated all the residents of the most dangerous place in the Grand Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>Even the Element Spirit Civilization and the Nihility race would be impressed if they heard this.</p>

  <p>"This matter must be kept secret," the Snake Goddess announced to those on the Dark Haze Peak.</p>

  <p>Zheng was currently a thorn in the two forces' side. If they knew what he did, then they would feel threatened and do something to the young man.</p>

  <p>After the Snake Goddess gave the order to keep things quiet, she and Fuxi returned to the Other Shore with Zheng.</p>

  <p>Once inside the Other Shore, Fuxi looked back at the Land of Diabolic Demons and confirmed that there were indeed no more Diabolic Demons left. He sighed and took his companions to the place where Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin were trapped.</p>

  <p>After passing the Spirit Disappearing Peak and the Soul Dissipating Peak, they arrived at the southeast part of the Grand Pure Realm. Here, they soon heard deep, rumbling sounds.</p>

  <p>"The Heavenly Thunder Plain is right in front of us. It's not safe. We should take a detour," Fuxi warned.</p>

  <p>"Crossing the plain will save us a lot of time though, but then again it might be too risky," the Snake Goddess agreed with a look of regret.</p>

  <p>Zheng, however, thought differently. "The Heavenly Thunder Plain? We might be able to cross it."</p>

  <p>Back when he was in the Blooming Jade Stage, the Primeval Lord of Heaven's Imprisoning Lightning left a deep impression on him. He knew that it could perfectly restrain the thunderbolts and lightning here and even help them obtain the powerful Solid Lightning Powder. They couldn't just let this opportunity pass them by!</p>
