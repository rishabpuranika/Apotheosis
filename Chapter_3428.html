<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Chaim had told Milo that there was only one way to defeat Mount, and that was to stab the latter with his sword.</p>

  <p>However, it was extremely difficult to do so since Mount constantly performed the Grand Teleportation technique.</p>

  <p>Despite that, Milo immediately decided that he would handle this matter.</p>

  <p>After all, no one else had a better understanding of the Flow Strike than Milo did.</p>

  <p>The very second he launched the attack against Mount, he quickly entered the flow state and was always on guard for Mount's possible attacks.</p>

  <p>Yet, such a prediction was not completely accurate. After all, Milo was not Mount himself, so he could not know what his opponent was thinking.</p>

  <p>Still, it could bring guidance to him and pressure to the opponent's thoughts.</p>

  <p>Chaim launched an attack before Milo did; then Chaim attacked Mount again. Milo's prediction changed three times before he directed Chaim to stab Mount in the chest.</p>

  <p>But Milo was disappointed at the power of his attack.</p>

  <p>If it was Milo who had stabbed Mount, Mount's skin would have been cut, even if the sword had not pierced his body.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, Chaim's strike was just like a tickle!</p>

  <p>In addition, his proud expression confused Milo. "What are you happy about? Is your sword poisoned? He didn't even bleed...so even if there is poison in your sword, it is useless, isn't it?" Milo berated.</p>

  <p>In turn, Chaim simply pointed to Mount in the distance and said, "Look!"</p>

  <p>A speck of golden light appeared beside Mount, which soon turned into a gold abacus.</p>

  <p>"What the hell is that?" Milo asked in bewilderment. There were millions of mortals, but the immortal-like disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace weren't one of them.</p>

  <p>It was normal that Milo had not seen abacuses before.</p>

  <p>"It's just an abacus," answered Chaim with a quick glance at Milo, and thought that the latter was a little ignorant.</p>

  <p>"An abacus... What does it do?" Milo asked. He was still confused.</p>

  <p>It wasn't only him, however. The disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace, and the members of the Snake Goddess race who surrounded Mount, all stared at the shiny object with perplexed looks.</p>

  <p>Even Mount was observing the small thing.</p>

  <p>Then, he stretched out one of his fingers and flicked the gold abacus.</p>

  <p>"Clap!"</p>

  <p>That small, random flick's power was extremely terrifying!</p>

  <p>The gold abacus immediately turned into gold powder, and dissipated in front of him.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the powder turned into a new abacus in the blink of an eye!</p>

  <p>"It's indestructible?" Mount's eyebrows shot up in surprise. He pointed at it and asked, "What's this?"</p>

  <p>He knew nearly everything, but even he could not see through where the abacus had originated, which indicated how precious it was.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Chaim remained vigilant but silent while Milo, who stood not far from him, seemed rather nervous.</p>

  <p>"Answer me," Mount commanded.</p>

  <p>As Chaim stayed quiet, Mount's body quivered slightly, and then disappeared.</p>

  <p>"Chaim! Watch your back!" Milo shouted.</p>

  <p>Chaim heard the warning and he immediately rushed forward. Then, Mount strangely popped out from his back. A thick yellow light flashed across his body while he punched his way out.</p>

  <p>It was clear that Mount had restrained the power of his punch by a lot, but everyone was sure that it was far greater than 1, 000 divine megatons of force.</p>

  <p>But because Milo had warned Chaim in time, he was able to avoid the punch.</p>

  <p>Mount silently glanced at Milo. Chaim had caught where he was in two rounds, and he thought that it was because of Milo.</p>

  <p>Milo could capture a person's subconscious reaction and strategy by relying on his flow state. However, when Mount began to be alert and didn't follow the subconscious reaction, the flow state naturally didn't work.</p>

  <p>Just as Mount's body was about to disappear in a flash again, Milo warned Chaim once more and yelled, "Chaim! Mind your top!"</p>

  <p>Without hesitation, Chaim pressed his body down vertically, but Mount, who had slowly disappeared, did not use the Grand Teleportation technique.</p>

  <p>Instead, he turned into a sharp arrow that shot towards Chaim.</p>

  <p>There was a dull force that was hidden in Mount. It had no momentum, but it killed or injured anyone that it hit.</p>

  <p>Chaim's pupils suddenly dilated. At the same time, he struck the sword with almost all his strength, and then twisted his body to retreat.</p>

  <p>Even with his maneuver, Milo's wrong judgment had already lost him the opportunity to escape.</p>

  <p>Mount stretched out his finger and gently snapped on Chaim's long sword.</p>

  <p>There was a metallic clang and the sword broke into countless pieces, before he literally punched Chaim.</p>

  <p>"Crack..."</p>

  <p>When the deadly punch came at Chaim, the Latent Theurgy above his head suddenly shattered, and a snow-white mirror appeared in front of him.</p>

  <p>The mirror showed a clear reflection of Mount, and that mirrored image charged at the real Mount outside the mirror.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The two fists crashed into each other and shattered the mirror's surface.</p>

  <p>Chaim was not hurt in the slightest, while Mount was thrown backward after he hit the Mount reflection in the mirror.</p>

  <p>"Emerald Light Mirror!"</p>

  <p>Chaim's Latent Theurgy was bestowed upon him by the head of Bright Mountain. At that critical moment, it saved his life.</p>

  <p>As Mount failed to hit his target, he quickly turned around and prepared to strike Chaim again. Just then, the gold abacus that had followed him sent out a series of noises.</p>

  <p>The beads of the abacus moved up and down, as if an invisible hand had fiddled with them. Eventually the beads stopped, and revealed a number.</p>

  <p>"2, 400 divine megatons of force..."</p>

  <p>Chaim's face instantly paled after he read the number on the abacus.</p>

  <p>The power that Mount had randomly released surpassed 1, 000 divine megatons of force. He was truly much stronger than an ordinary warrior at the Chaotic Source Realm.</p>

  <p>'His body is tough as a warrior at the Chaotic Source Realm. If the Emerald Light Mirror had not blocked his attack, I might have died already!' Chaim thought with lingering fear.</p>

  <p>Now, Mount also looked at the gold abacus beside him and quickly read the number on it. "2, 400 divine megatons of force…the function of this abacus is more than just counting, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Of course not. Your first attack has reached your limit, and your next attack will have only half the power of the previous one," Chaim calmly explained. He had relied on the Latent Theurgy to avoid his opponent's deadliest blow. Now that his gold abacus had already started to work, he was no longer that afraid of Mount.</p>

  <p>While Mount stared at the numbers on the abacus, he asked, "So, you mean that I can only exert 1, 200 divine megatons of force for my next attack?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Chaim with a nod.</p>

  <p>The moment he nodded his head, Mount appeared in front of him and was about to throw a punch to his face.</p>

  <p>This time, Mount was so fast that Milo had no time to alert Chaim. Without any warning, Chaim reflexively raised his hands to resist the punch.</p>

  <p>"Crack, crack, crack..."</p>

  <p>How could Chaim's body resist Mount's attack? The bones in his arms and his chest broke into pieces at once. Blood gushed out from his mouth, and then he fell from the sky.</p>

  <p>"It really was only half as powerful as the last punch." Mount looked at his fist and muttered.</p>

  <p>"Crack, crack, crack..."</p>

  <p>At that moment, the beads of the abacus beside him began to move again.</p>
