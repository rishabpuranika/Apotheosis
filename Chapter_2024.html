<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Soon after Luo Luo Zheng became a world lord, his inner world formed its true boundaries.</p>

  <p>The boundaries of an ordinary world lord were covered by transparent barriers that were similar to the boundaries of a great world. However, Luo Zheng's inner world stood apart from others.</p>

  <p>On the boundaries inside Luo Zheng's inner world, enormous golden Sanskrit words hovered in the air.</p>

  <p>With Luo Zheng's current knowledge and experience, he was unable to decipher the meaning of the golden Sanskrit words. He was very curious about the origin of the golden Sanskrit words.</p>

  <p>Mike wanted to guide him in the creation of his divine land. Hence, Luo Luo Zheng brought his father to this place.</p>

  <p>Mike and Luo Luo Zheng were floating above the endless chaotic sea.</p>

  <p>Although Mike was just an energy soul, its power was far beyond that of an ordinary Supreme Lord. More so, it was enough to even rival a True God's. Although he was still far away, he could clearly see the golden Sanskrit words.</p>

  <p>When he saw what was happening in front of him, his eyes were filled with disbelief.</p>

  <p>"This is unbelievable! Never thought I would be seeing these words in your inner world! These are definitely their words!"</p>

  <p>Mike was referring to the extraordinary creatures.</p>

  <p>Long ago, a group of exemplary individuals of the divine land had discovered the existence of these creatures.</p>

  <p>These people never stopped studying these extraordinary creatures. But after all these divine eras of research, nobody could understand their origin. Everything of them still remained a mystery, such as their appearance, gender, composition etc.</p>

  <p>They seemed to be above the knowledge of the True Gods and Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>There were still quite a few living creatures in the divine land who continued to be interested in them. They seized every opportunity to conduct a thorough research on them.</p>

  <p>Among these researchers were Holy Jay and Holy Bromley.</p>

  <p>For example, Xenia's page of golden Sanskrit words and the golden Sanskrit words on Luo Zheng's body were the outcome of their researches.</p>

  <p>And the effect was quite surprising!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had reformed his body by using the golden Sanskrit words. His body was by now far stronger than any living being. It was only because of this strength that he could withstand the chaotic energy of his inner world and practice the Primal Chaos Technique.</p>

  <p>"Father, why would these golden Sanskrit words appear at the edges of my inner world?" Luo Luo Zheng enquired.</p>

  <p>Mike stared at the golden Sanskrit words, while remaining afloat. He ignored Luo Zheng's question and flew along the edges of his inner world, while constantly looking over the golden Sanskrit words.</p>

  <p>His speed was exceptionally fast, but as the creator of this inner world, Luo Luo Zheng didn't need to circulate the Space Law. With just a thought, he could appear anywhere.</p>

  <p>As Mike flew around the edges, Luo Zheng's figure continuously flashed behind him.</p>

  <p>Currently, Luo Zheng's inner world could not be considered wide. It was about the size of four great worlds.</p>

  <p>Mike's Evolutionary Universe, however, contained a hundred thousand supreme worlds, and a million great worlds. Compared to that, Luo Zheng's inner world was a minuscule.</p>

  <p>In less than five minutes, Mike had already circled around Luo Zheng's inner world. Suddenly he stopped.</p>

  <p>When Mike saw Luo Luo Zheng appear in front of him, he stared at him with a strange expression. His eyes were filled with incomprehension and disbelief.</p>

  <p>"Father, what's wrong?" Luo Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"There are a total of one thousand and eighty golden Sanskrit words.</p>

  <p>They must have intentionally left these golden Sanskrit words behind,"</p>

  <p>Mike concluded.</p>

  <p>"Intentionally left behind these golden Sanskrit words? Why would they do such a thing? There has to be some reason!" Luo Luo Zheng was equally aghast.</p>

  <p>Mike shook his head. "With my current energy soul, I am unable to solve the mysteries of these golden Sanskrit words. However, there must be some important information that they want to pass on to you."</p>

  <p>Golden Sanskrit words were very unique characters. Each word contained a rich amount of information, and just by looking at it, nobody could gauge anything. One had to synchronize it in order to understand it, which was very time consuming.</p>

  <p>However, once the mystery was unraveled, a martial artist could benefit unlimited advantages.</p>

  <p>The Grand Weapon Refining Method was one such fine example. It was Holy Jay who had unraveled it. Xenia's Sanskrit words could release fine bolts of lightning, which had been unraveled by Holy Bromley.</p>

  <p>The divine land was an isolated island within the chaos. Only Holy Beings could travel through the chaos. Even the strongest True Gods were unable to step into the chaos.</p>

  <p>And after countless divine eras, the cultivation methods, laws, and Divine Dao of the life vitality system had been studied thoroughly by warriors, and it was very difficult for them to make any major breakthroughs.</p>

  <p>As a result, countless martial artists in the divine land were studying the golden Sanskrit words, trying to comprehend cultivation methods that belonged to these extraordinary creatures and obtain power that had never appeared in the divine land before.</p>

  <p>It was not as if this had never happened before. There had once been a warrior who had become a Holy Being, and the reason he could do so was because he had unraveled an extremely powerful cultivation method through some Sanskrit words.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng had returned to the fairy palace back then, Immortal Book had told him that his son Luo Nian would definitely be a good treasure in the divine land. Luo Nian's talent in deciphering the Sanskrit words had always been admired by Immortal Book.</p>

  <p>At that time, Luo Luo Zheng didn't take the words of Immortal Book very seriously.</p>

  <p>Now that he heard his father say this, he realized that what Luo Nian possessed was indeed an incredible skill.</p>

  <p>Mike continued looking at the Sanskrit words for a long time. Although he made these speculations, he was still unable to decipher the meaning behind the golden Sanskrit words, much less understand why these golden Sanskrit words appeared here.</p>

  <p>"If you have the chance, you must unravel these Sanskrit words before you head to the divine land," Mike told Luo Luo Zheng. Even though Mike could not understand the words, he knew there was something extraordinary about them.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Father," Luo Luo Zheng said while nodding his head. After all, this was his inner world. No matter what the Sanskrit words meant, he somehow had to find out by himself.</p>

  <p>Mike wandered around in this inner world and shook his head, while looking at Luo Luo Zheng. "But your inner world is still too small."</p>

  <p>"Too small?" Luo Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>He had limited idea about the size of other warriors' inner worlds.</p>

  <p>He didn't know that after one became a world lord and the boundaries of the inner world appeared, they would try their best to expand the inner world. After all, the amount of life vitality a world lord required was extremely high, and the wider the inner world, the more life vitality it would contain. This was an urgent requirement for a world lord.</p>

  <p>However, this problem didn't exist for Luo Luo Zheng at all.</p>

  <p>As for the other martial artists, their inner worlds swallowed all the vitality between heaven and earth in the universe, slowly accumulating it over time. If one's life vitality was excessively exhausted, then they would have to constantly meditate, absorbing the vitality between heaven and earth into their own sea of life vitality.</p>

  <p>Of course, there was an even simpler and faster method. One could simply crush a supreme life vitality crystal and absorb the life vitality existing inside.</p>

  <p>As for Luo Luo Zheng, the chaotic energy within his body was extremely vast, which meant he had a bottomless pit of chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Luo Luo Zheng could use the roots of the World Tree to collect the chaotic energy, so there was no urgency to expand his inner world.</p>

  <p>However, from Mike's viewpoint, expanding the inner world was very important.</p>

  <p>He was, after all, a Holy Being who had built the universe. His experience in this aspect could be said to be shocking. He was pleasantly surprised to see the huge ice tree in Luo Zheng's body. "This is the profound mystery of the Ice Cold Flame. You got it from Holy Jay!"</p>

  <p>Mike then taught Luo Luo Zheng the keys to build one's inner world.</p>

  <p>One of them was that Luo Luo Zheng should create Law Tablets and record the laws that he had comprehended onto the tablets. Then he should give them to the creatures in his inner world and guide them on how to become stronger. Ideally, Luo Luo Zheng should have created a few continents, instead of allowing this one continent to expand indefinitely.</p>

  <p>The construction of the universe was very complicated, and as Mike was telling Luo Luo Zheng the key points, the latter listened attentively.</p>

  <p>While Mike was imparting his knowledge, Luo Luo Zheng noticed that the Mu Ning emitting from his father was getting weaker by the minute.</p>

  <p>This figure was formed from his energy soul. His entire body was becoming more and more transparent in front of Luo Luo Zheng, while his voice was becoming weaker.</p>

  <p>Only Holy Beings could create their energy souls and descended to the universes through them. Mike had left behind a total of fourteen energy souls, and after the beginning of a new grand era in the Evolutionary Universe, his energy souls would begin to move, seeking opportunities.</p>

  <p>This energy soul was consumed very quickly, and about ten years ago, it had helped Luo Luo Zheng resist the Luck-devouring Snake Tribulation. And not long ago, in order to protect Luo Luo Zheng, this energy soul had fought against Murphy's energy soul violently. His energy soul was now like a spent arrow.</p>

  <p>"Father?" Luo Luo Zheng called out.</p>

  <p>Mike looked at Luo Luo Zheng with a faint smile and shook his head. "It's about time. This energy soul can only last for so long. This is the only remaining energy soul that I have in this universe. If I can't wake up in the future, I'm afraid I will surely die."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was shocked and shouted, "Father! Father!"</p>
