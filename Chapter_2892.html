  <p>
</p>

  <p>Leland was surprised at the thought that crossed his mind. But he was soon smiling.</p>

  <p>Even if Luo Zheng had obtained great opportunities in Reincarnation Land, it was highly possible that he wouldn't be able to leave the Abyss Demon Region alive facing the alliance of the powerful clans.</p>

  <p>But he had a faint premonition that Luo Zheng wouldn't die that easily.</p>

  <p>At this moment, a voice sounded close to them. "We, in fact, have a greater chance of becoming Holy Beings this time. I hear that the strength of the alliance of powerful clans has weakened considerably when they explored the Abyss Demon Region. All of them were almost killed. Holy Beings can be reincarnated, but the Demi-holy Beings and consummate True Gods of the clans are now dead. Even Nicholas' universe has collapsed. The one that collapsed not long ago was his."</p>

  <p>"Where did you get the news?"</p>

  <p>"I have an old friend on a Floating Island. He told me. But keep this to yourselves. Don't spread this news.".</p>

  <p>Leland's expression shifted to one of sadness at these words.</p>

  <p>Now that he knew the news of these deaths, it seemed to him that Luo Zheng had died along with them.</p>

  <p>Once the Mountain of Holy Beings had appeared, Luo Zheng and Mike returned to the Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>The Infinity Ruler in his mind changed direction according to Luo Zheng's position. But it always pointed towards the Time Sea in the middle of the divine land.</p>

  <p>The Mountain of Holy Beings would be opened three months after it appeared.</p>

  <p>This time around, Luo Zheng had gathered all the Divine Dao, and had also taken his time to fuse them together. So he chose to cultivate in seclusion immediately after their return to the Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>'The power of the Ways-blending Strike created by the fusion of more than three hundred Divine Dao is extraordinary. If the three thousand Divine Dao are fully integrated...' His eyes glinted with excitement at this thought.</p>

  <p>But No. 9527 was ready with a buzzkill the moment the idea came to Luo Zheng's mind. "This method of Ways-blending Energy has been tried before."</p>

  <p>"Is it powerful?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Of course! It's incredibly powerful but only to warriors at the True God Realm. This kind of power is ordinary to those at the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>So what you should do now is cross the Sea of Truth and cultivate the truth token," No. 9527 warned.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 could hardly understand Luo Zheng's stubbornness. It had warned Luo Zheng the first time it had seen the Ways-blending Energy that it would not work.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng had still continued to explore the Ways-blending Energy diligently.</p>

  <p>The True Gods in the Source World did not know the extent of the Ways-blending Energy's power.</p>

  <p>Once different kinds of selected internal momentum came together properly, it could display an extraordinary level of power. But it would take a lot of time to comprehend the three thousand different Divine Dao one by one.</p>

  <p>Wouldn't it be easier to use this time to cross the Sea of Truth and reach the Other Shore Realm instead? According to them, studying the Ways-blending token was a complete waste of time.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng was not born in the Source World. Many people had told him that he could achieve nothing on the path of blending the Divine Dao, but he still believed in Chiyou's arrangement and chose to try it this time.</p>

  <p>Moreover, now that he possessed the Infinity Ruler, it was easy for him to comprehend a token. Mastering the Ways-blending Energy could also increase his own strength. So why not?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had calmed down after his conversation with No. 9527.</p>

  <p>The light on the Godly Plate in his body flashed and began to extract the Faith Energy, which then turned into traces of internal momentum. And then, the internal momentum of various colors transformed into mist of different shapes and came together slowly, mixing together.</p>

  <p>In the chaos...</p>

  <p>The clouds formed by the chaotic energy began to flow, albeit slowly.</p>

  <p>In fact, the speed of the flow of these clouds was not slow, but was outrageously fast to behold.</p>

  <p>The speed at which they moved and spread out was a hundred times faster than that of a warrior at the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>Every cloud was unimaginably large. A single cloud was large enough that it could contain trillions of divine lands within it.</p>

  <p>So seen from a distance, these clouds seemed to be still.</p>

  <p>Within the clouds, several people stood on a cyan ship that was one thousand feet long. Its surface flashed with a pale cyan light as it flew at an amazing speed.</p>

  <p>A huge beast ran ahead of the ship.</p>

  <p>It looked like a mantis, four wings on its back and a number of fine barbs on its abdomen. Thin tentacles spread out on the top of its head. It looked strange and had hateful countenances.</p>

  <p>Its body rippled under the cover of the chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>It was a Chaos Winged Beast that lived in the chaos, considered rare and precious in the Source World. Its soul was especially priceless as it could be brought over to the Other Shore after it was refined.</p>

  <p>In the Source World, anything that had anything to do with the Other Shore was precious, soul pills being a case in point.</p>

  <p>In fact, the power of the soul pills was considered ordinary. There were a lot of elixirs that were better than soul pills, but a majority of them couldn't be carried to the Sea of Truth or the Other Shore. This made them far less valuable than soul pills. This was also why soul pills could become the currency of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>"The Chaos Winged Beast is running so fast! We've chased it for many years, and now we've come to the bottom of the chaos. I want to go back to the Source World. What the hell kind of place is this?" one of the men on the ship complained.</p>

  <p>"So what? Once we catch the Chaos Winged Beast, our status in the Other Shore will be greatly enhanced. We will also receive a great reward when we return. Each of you can raise one star! The hardships we go through would pay off!"</p>

  <p>The one who spoke was a young man dressed in a purple robe standing to the front of the ship.</p>

  <p>This young man had sharp eyes and a special aura that surrounded him. He was obviously the leader of the group.</p>

  <p>The moment he finished speaking, the Chaos Winged Beast suddenly let out a sound. The four giant wings on its back flashed with cyan light, and an irresistible space power spread out of them. These four giant wings contained the Truth of Void Destruction!</p>

  <p>"Damn it. It's going to run away again. Hurry up!" a man on the flying ship shouted.</p>

  <p>The flying ship followed the Chaos Winged Beast into the space channel.</p>

  <p>They couldn't give up since they had chased after the Chaos Winged Beast for many years.</p>

  <p>The moment the flying ship got into the space channel, a man on the ship had a strange look on his face and cried out, "Master Clement! My Yellow Emperor Magatama seems to be having a reaction!"</p>

  <p>Clement glanced at this man in surprise. Someone standing beside him couldn't help but ridicule him, "Do you know how vast the chaos is? The Yellow Emperor Magatama's range of perception is limited. If you can encounter Yellow Emperor Guards here, my name is not Cosmo!"</p>

  <p>Clement nodded in agreement.</p>

  <p>Yellow Emperor Magatama could allow the Yellow Emperor Guards to communicate with each other.</p>

  <p>Distance was not a problem in the Source World. But the Source World was only a drop in the ocean compared to the chaos. How could one meet Yellow Emperor Guards at the edge of such a chaos? Even Clement didn't believe what the man claimed.</p>

  <p>Seeing that no one was going to believe him, the man patted his waist gently and pulled out the Yellow Emperor Magatama. "You better hear it for yourself then."</p>

  <p>Then they heard an ear-piercing screech from the Yellow Emperor Magatama.</p>
