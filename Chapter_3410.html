  <p>
</p>

  <p>At that moment, the various races broke into gasps when they saw the Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>After all, they had roamed across the Chaotic Source World for a really long time, but harvested very little. There were some lucky ones who were able to get dozens of Chaotic Source Spirits, but the others got nothing.</p>

  <p>To their surprise, Yan actually drew out a hundred Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>Of course, it made everyone excited!</p>

  <p>"Everyone, come on!"</p>

  <p>"As long as the mountain wall is broken, we can dig out Chaotic Source Spirits!"</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, the Chaotic Source Spirits reinforced anything they had been integrated with to a great extent.</p>

  <p>If they were continuously battered, however, they quickly became exhausted.</p>

  <p>It was known that there was a large amount of the Chaotic Source Spirits in the mountain.</p>

  <p>"Crack..."</p>

  <p>Just then, a new crack appeared on the mountain wall.</p>

  <p>This time, Mya, the genius of the Divine Farmer race was quick to act. In a blink of an eye, her long curly hair extended up into the crack and with a slight twist, her hair had killed the Chaotic Source Spirits hiding inside the crack. After they were stripped of their blood and flesh, her hair had pulled out dozens of amber crystals.</p>

  <p>"Sure enough!"</p>

  <p>"All the Chaotic Source Spirits are in there!"</p>

  <p>"Everybody, charge up!"</p>

  <p>Even the warriors who hesitated to move couldn't sit still anymore.</p>

  <p>They all descended and stood on the mountain wall of the main peak, then smashed and punched the wall like mad.</p>

  <p>All they needed was for the Chaotic Source Spirits inside the mountain to get tired, then the warriors simply had to reach through the cracks and pull the Chaotic Source Spirits out. After the warriors killed them, they stripped the amber colored crystals from their bodies and put the crystals into their space rings.</p>

  <p>The Chaotic Source Spirits were a kind of living beings, and they also referred to the crystals in their bodies.</p>

  <p>"How savage are these warriors?" Luo Zheng said and shook his head. Then again, Yan's method, which consisted of inserting her energy threads in the crack then instantly evaporating the blood, flesh, and bones of the Chaotic Source Spirits was no different.</p>

  <p>Her method of killing them was also bloody.</p>

  <p>There was nothing the Chaotic Source Spirits could do to ease their tragic fate.</p>

  <p>The warriors outside the mountain continued to dig happily, while the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits and the huge eye who were hiding inside were in deep agony.</p>

  <p>"These damn creatures! They have gone too far this year..." Resentment filled the black eyes of the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>Trapped in the Chaotic Source World, the Chaotic Source Spirits were like meat on the chopping block.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, such a way of cultivation was like a game and also a trial for the geniuses of the super forces.</p>

  <p>The mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits, however, had been trying her best to save the creatures of her own race since she had gained wisdom. She summoned a considerable number of the Chaotic Source Spirits and gathered them all together at the main peak. If anyone dared to enter the main peak, they absolutely fought back.</p>

  <p>Her efforts did work. Now, almost no one dared to enter the main peak. In addition, she only needed to sacrifice more than half of the Chaotic Source Spirits every ten years to keep the rest safe.</p>

  <p>The giant eye came up with such a trick this time, but it was not helpful at all. What was worse was that the whole main peak was destroyed, which was the last thing she wanted to see.</p>

  <p>The huge eye stared at what happened outside in silence.</p>

  <p>"If this goes on, we will lose more of our Chaotic Source Spirits, and we will only be weaker and weaker! What should we do?" the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits cried out and urged for a solution.</p>

  <p>"We have no choice but to fight our way out..." said the huge eye through its consciousness. As it spoke, a sharp light flashed deep inside of its eyeball.</p>

  <p>The descent of the huge eye was such a well-kept secret that even the people of the Li Shan mountain hadn't noticed it.</p>

  <p>Although the Li Shan mountain was in charge of the operation of the Chaotic Source World, they rarely entered the core area. If the two of them rushed out, their plan would probably be ruined.</p>

  <p>At the same time, they would be beaten passively if they stayed hidden inside.</p>

  <p>The mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits had long harbored a grudge against the creatures outside. When she heard what the huge eye had said, she immediately gave an order.</p>

  <p>Outside the main peak, the members of different races and disciples of various forces continued to plunder the Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>Later on, some of the warriors who were wandering in the periphery of the Chaotic Source World also joined them when they arrived.</p>

  <p>At that point, the dark smog in the sky surged again. It meant that the hurricane was about to come.</p>

  <p>"Hurricane is coming!" someone shouted.</p>

  <p>The creatures who were gathered at the top of the main peak heard the warning, and quickly retreated.</p>

  <p>Some hid in arrays, and some had dug holes in the ground and hid inside, waiting for the hurricane to pass.</p>

  <p>Outside the Chaotic Source World, the leaders didn't know whether to cry or laugh when they saw the scene.</p>

  <p>They actually didn't know what happened at first. They thought it was strange that no one went to the arrays to receive Chaotic Source Reinforcement. When they finally saw them retreat from the four mountain peaks, they immediately understood what was going on.</p>

  <p>They never expected that all the warriors would break the main peak with joint forces.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the various races didn't lose many of their key figures. The current situation was just fine as they looked at it.</p>

  <p>As soon as the hurricane stopped, the warriors hiding in the holes flew up again and continued to attack the mountain wall.</p>

  <p>A member of the Separate Abyss race stepped directly on the mountain wall. There was a layer of extremely sharp cyan light floating in his hands.</p>

  <p>He pounded the wall with his fists several times, until the part of the wall he was hitting exploded.</p>

  <p>This one warrior cheered in delight, then enthusiastically buried his hands in the hole to take the Chaotic Source Spirits inside.</p>

  <p>When he put his hands in, however, he saw two red eyes glow in the crack.</p>

  <p>The eagerness in his face was gone.</p>

  <p>He immediately kicked hard against the wall with his strong legs to try to distance himself from the mountain wall, but it was too late.</p>

  <p>"Aoo!"</p>

  <p>A bright red thing emerged from the mountain wall. It was biting hard at the warrior of the Separate Abyss race, until it chomped on his head. The warrior twisted his strong body a few times in an attempt to escape, but he suddenly went limp. He eventually stopped moving.</p>

  <p>The warrior had a large build, so the Chaotic Source Spirit couldn't swallow him at once completely.</p>

  <p>Things were even worse on the other side of the mountain wall. Two warriors from the Divine Farmer race were also digging for Chaotic Source Spirits until they saw the glowing red eyes inside. Before they could react, a large bloody mouth swallowed their whole bodies.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, every race had lost several members who were devoured by the large bloody mouths.</p>

  <p>"Retreat!"</p>

  <p>"The Chaotic Source Spirits are coming out!"</p>

  <p>"I told you not to approach the mountain wall!"</p>

  <p>Most people were still very cautious. Luo Zheng, Yan, Dorothy, and some others kept a distance from the mountain wall while they smashed it. When the Chaotic Source Spirits emerged from the mountain wall, they lightly lifted their bodies and instantly distanced themselves from them.</p>

  <p>"They finally came out," Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>He had warned the disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace, the Li Shan mountain, and the Ear Mice not to get too close through chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>If too many Chaotic Source Spirits were lost, the rest of them would definitely rush out and fight for their lives.</p>

  <p>Now, his prediction was right. Therefore, none of the members of the Taiyi Heaven Palace, the Li Shan mountain, or even the Ear Mice got injured.</p>

  <p>"Crack..."</p>

  <p>"Crack..."</p>

  <p>On the mountain wall, the large-sized Chaotic Source Spirits finally got out of the cracks. In addition to their size, they also exuded a malicious aura.</p>

  <p>Yet, they didn't attack immediately. They remained attached to the mountain wall and just leered at the creatures above them with hatred.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a bigger crack ruptured and split the top of the main peak in half.</p>

  <p>It immediately caught the attention of all the creatures around.</p>

  <p>The moment the broken mountain top fell, a huge eyeball emerged, and beside it was an enormous Chaotic Source Spirit that measured ten thousand feet high.</p>

  <p>Everyone's eyes were transfixed on the huge Chaotic Source Spirit. At the same time, they all thought of the same thing: It must be the mother of all the Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>
