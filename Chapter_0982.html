<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Margaret was not expecting for things to come this far.</p>

  <p>Ever since she was young, she had been thoroughly accomplished. She could play the lyre, she was good at chess, her calligraphy and painting skills were excellent, and her innate talent for martial arts could make a lot of warriors green with envy. Coupled with her ravishing looks, it was no surprise that men continuously fell at her feet.</p>

  <p>Back in both the Ethereal City and Ethereal Spirit Sect, she was considered a lofty goddess whose holy presence was something ordinary people could only hope to bask in. Countless young, talented men had tried their hardest to curry her favor.</p>

  <p>There used to be a heaven-level talent in the Ethereal Spirit Sect. To celebrate Margaret's birthday, he gathered sixteen Radiant Light Grass seeds from thousands of miles away to string into a bracelet as a gift for her.</p>

  <p>Those seeds only existed on the snowy mountains of the far west and were extremely hard to collect. They would glow faintly day and night, which made them viable to be turned into an ingenious gift.</p>

  <p>But in truth, people didn't just use Radiant Light Grass seeds as makeshift beads for a bracelet. They were extremely valuable and the cost could be compared to that of a fairy weapon.</p>

  <p>Right after the young man presented Margaret with the bracelet, she immediately threw it on the ground as a show of blatant displeasure.</p>

  <p>The clan elders could do nothing but helplessly smile at her actions.</p>

  <p>Everyone in the clan doted on her. She was Xander's descendant. Despite his fury, the heaven-level talent could do nothing but accept her rejection.</p>

  <p>Margaret used to be filled to the brim with arrogance. She had never thought that the day would come when she was trapped in a dark, underground palace, weak and utterly helpless.</p>

  <p>It was the ultimate humiliation for someone like her.</p>

  <p>She tried to resist Zheng with all her might but it was futile.</p>

  <p>She was too weak to stop him. Her life vitality was restrained and, even if she could use it, she would've never been able to harm Zheng's body since he had the strength of a high-grade fairy weapon.</p>

  <p>She had tried to graze his skin, but soon found that it was extremely tough. Her nails were on the verge of breaking, but she couldn't even make a single mark. She tried to bite him, but it was like sinking her teeth on a thick piece of metal. It hurt her teeth terribly, so she decided against it.</p>

  <p>"Let me go!</p>

  <p>If… If I manage to escape this time, I will definitely kill you!" she told him, gritting her teeth in fury.</p>

  <p>Zheng rolled his eyes. "You've already said that three times," he replied coldly.</p>

  <p>Xun was right. This was the only way. Even if he got lucky and managed to escape the underground palace, it would be very difficult to take Margaret with him. Her Purple Power Body would be completely useless to Eddie. Even if Zheng himself presented Margaret to him, he wouldn't be interested in the slightest.</p>

  <p>A lot of girls liked Eddie, mostly due to the fact that he was the strongest warrior in all of Central Region. However, men like him who sought to attain the peak of martial arts would never be interested in the affairs of the heart. Only those evil warriors would indulge in sexual relationships with multiple women.</p>

  <p>"There are at least a few hundred tunnels in this underground palace,"</p>

  <p>Xun sneered. "Eddie won't be able to find this place in such a short period of time, but it is still better to end this quickly."</p>

  <p>Just then, a few tendrils of purple light surrounded the cave. They were like silk threads that constantly diffused and condensed around Zheng and Margaret until they completely wrapped the two of them together and formed a purple cocoon.</p>

  <p>This purple energy was unique to the Purple Power Body. Eddie needed three girls with Purple Power Bodies and used the Lustful Demon Array to activate and harness the said energy.</p>

  <p>But even without the use of the Lustful Demon Array, just absorbing the energy like this was enough to benefit both Zheng and Margaret.</p>

  <p>The Purple Power was an excellent element for cultivation. During the process, the purple cocoon would mix with their sweat and slowly be absorbed by their bodies.</p>

  <p>After the ordeal, Margaret lay on the cold, hard ground with her entire body covered in sweat. She could only stare at Zheng with a dazed look in her eyes though her gaze held a trace of doubt.</p>

  <p>She knew in her heart that she wanted to kill Zheng, but at the same time, she didn't find him quite as hateful as before.</p>

  <p>Margaret had now been thrown into a state of confusion.</p>

  <p>Zheng, on the other hand, was already up. He quickly tidied himself and took out a loose set of clothes from his space ring. He tossed the clothes to Margaret and turned his head away to avoid looking at her.</p>

  <p>His actions enraged Margaret. 'You've taken my virginity but now you're embarrassed to even look at me?' she thought to herself.</p>

  <p>And she was right.</p>

  <p>Just now, Zheng had pushed Margaret down in a fit of rage but only because he felt cornered and desperate inside the dark, dangerous, underground palace with Eddie hot at his heels. He was afraid of Margaret falling into Eddie's hands, so for the greater good and also for the sake of his little sister, he had no choice but to do it.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng was still a virgin, so he was still a bit embarrassed after they finished.</p>

  <p>In Margaret's eyes, however, Zheng was blatantly trying to deny their relationship.</p>

  <p>"Put your clothes on and we'll find a way to get out of here," Zheng said with his back to Margaret.</p>

  <p>For some reason, she refused. "No! I don't want to!" she declared angrily.</p>

  <p>She quickly blushed at her impulsive words. Never did she think that she would be so shameless in front of a man.</p>
