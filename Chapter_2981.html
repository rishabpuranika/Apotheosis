  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng couldn't get a full, clear picture. He saw only fragments of what he was being shown to him.</p>

  <p>He saw Leopold being stabbed by the man dressed in white when suddenly the image stopped.</p>

  <p>Zheng was left anxious, worrying for Leopold's life. He glared fiercely at the Ear Mouse who responded in an unhurried tone, "This is all I can show you with the twenty divine crystals you paid. If you wish to see more it is going to cost you more."</p>

  <p>It was true that all mice were cunning creatures.</p>

  <p>"How many more divine crystals do I have to pay?" Zheng asked, frustrated and containing his anger.</p>

  <p>"One hundred more," the Ear Mouse replied, a sly glint in its eyes.</p>

  <p>Zheng had enough divine crystals, so that was not a problem for him. He just hated having his fears being taken advantage of and used against him.</p>

  <p>Were they in the divine land, Zheng would have given this mouse what it deserved.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng was a stranger to the Source World and had no backup here.</p>

  <p>The Ear Mice were familiar even to No. 9527, which meant this race had great power here and it would be ill-advised for him to provoke them.</p>

  <p>Zheng clenched his fists and swallowed his anger. "Is a hundred divine crystals enough to buy all I need to know?" Zheng inquired.</p>

  <p>Zheng had to ask such a question or the Ear Mouse would undoubtedly take the opportunity to con more divine crystals out of him.</p>

  <p>The Ear Mouse squeaked and laughed before admitting, "Yes, one hundred divine crystals will be enough."</p>

  <p>Zheng snorted and waved his hand above the large porcelain plate. Another hundred divine crystals fell from his sleeve and stacked neatly together.</p>

  <p>With a devious grin, the Ear Mouse stretched out its claw and gently swept across the magic array.</p>

  <p>Zheng could see Leopold again. Emily appeared immediately after he had been struck by the man in white, and dragged him out of the way.</p>

  <p>The strike of the sword had not taken Leopold's life but the ground was left painted with his blood.</p>

  <p>As Emily moved him, several hundred circles of colorful light burst from Emily's body.</p>

  <p>Zheng had never seen Emily conjure so many circles of light all at once. He soon realized warriors of the Other Shore Realm like Emily needed the divine crystals to maximize their power. Emily had not had even a single divine crystal with her before.</p>

  <p>On their way to the Source World, Zheng had distributed several hundred divine crystals to every warrior at the Other Shore Realm. It looked like Emily had gone all out against the man dressed in white.</p>

  <p>The rings of colorful light housed an intense deadly force that could be felt resonating from them. Emily continued shuffling along with Leopold as the rings began shuddering and connecting with one another, forming a huge maze enveloping the man in white.</p>

  <p>It still wasn't enough, and the man took only a few seconds to break through and emerge, a terrifying sight. Fortunately, as Zheng saw, Emily had already managed to escape with Leopold. The man dressed in white was left with no one else in sight.</p>

  <p>Zheng was unfamiliar with the technique Emily used to escape, and he could not figure out how she had done it. It seemed the man in white could not either. He searched and searched, eventually having to accept defeat and give up his pursuit.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Zheng let out a deep sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>Both Emily and Leopold were still alive. This was the best news possible.</p>

  <p>"They have indeed escaped successfully. But is there not more you wish to know? For instance, you could learn the identity of this man in white, should you pay an additional fifty divine crystals." The Ear Mouse pressed on, staring intently at Zheng.</p>

  <p>Without hesitation, Zheng threw out another fifty divine crystals before the mouse could even finish speaking.</p>

  <p>The Ear Mouse was taken aback. It was very difficult for an ordinary consummate True God to possess more than five divine crystals, and here Zheng had already paid close to two hundred.</p>

  <p>"The man's name is Sanjay. He belongs to the Bearing race. He ranks among the last three thousand of the Sky Guard Pavilion, but he is excellent enough. He is skilled with a broad-edge sword. His Other Shore Token is..."</p>

  <p>The Ear Mouse revealed almost every imaginable detail of the man in white to Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng took it all in, believing what he had just heard. The Mice League was far more impressive than he had expected. The Ear Mouse knew everything there was to know about Sanjay, as if he had absolutely no secrets from them. "As far as I know, the Bearing race is a great race in the Source World. Aren't you afraid of retaliation from Yellow Emperor Guards when they find out you gather their information and sell it to anyone who can pay?" Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>It was taboo to reveal anyone's detailed information and secrets to others, so Zheng gathered that it was impossible for the other great races to let the Mice League go on like this consequence free.</p>

  <p>"Retaliate against us?" The Ear Mouse appeared viciously insulted, "They don't have the ability to do that!"</p>

  <p>The Mice League was spread throughout the various provinces in the Source World. Although they were a serious annoyance to the other great races, nothing could be done about it. The Mice League operated in mysterious ways.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, Zheng got what he came for with the divine crystals paid. He cupped his hands to the Ear Mouse and made for the exit.</p>

  <p>As he was leaving the room, the Ear Mouse warned, "You remember the rules don't you? You are not to reveal to another soul the information you bought here today. If you violate the rule, we will chase you to the ends of the earth. You best keep that in mind!"</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded politely and left the room.</p>

  <p>The Mice League were a greedy bunch, but they attached great importance to their rules.</p>

  <p>Zheng was generous with his money, and it was obvious that he had plenty of divine crystals. Yet even with this knowledge, the Ear Mouse would not continue to try and split him from his divine crystals.</p>

  <p>In respect of that, Zheng was required to obey their rules. This was their way of doing business.</p>

  <p>Zheng left the house to find Kenelm waiting outside. Kenelm walked up to greet Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Get anything useful from them, Zheng?" Kenelm asked with a friendly smile.</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled and nodded. He seemed somewhat uneasy around Kenelm.</p>

  <p>"That's great! There's indeed no information in this world that you can't get from the Mice League! By the way, Zheng, what's your next move?" Kenelm asked.</p>

  <p>When Zheng and Kenelm first met, Kenelm's intention to befriend Zheng was clear. However, since Zheng had denied their friendship before, he could not ask for it again, and the best he could do was be helpful and charming and hope.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to..."</p>

  <p>All Zheng had been concerned with was his sister's safety.</p>

  <p>Now that he had discovered she escaped safely, he was both relieved and a tad lost. 'What should I do next?' Zheng wondered.</p>

  <p>According to their original plan in the divine land, Chiyou should have arranged Zheng's next move. However, Chiyou hadn't revealed it to Zheng, but instead made a deal with No. 9527.</p>

  <p>It seemed he should inquire with No. 9527 for the answer to his question.</p>

  <p>It occurred to him he still knew very little about the Source World. It would probably be prudent for him to stay in the Excellence City and get a basic understanding of the Source World.</p>

  <p>"If you have no place to go, I can arrange a place for you to stay if you'd like," offered Kenelm.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng only knew Kenelm for a short time, he knew he was not a cunning and insidious person. What was more, Kenelm had helped him to locate the Mice League.</p>

  <p>There was no reason for Zheng to distrust him and decline his invitation, so he didn't.</p>

  <p>Led by Kenelm, Zheng walked across half the Excellence City and arrived at a house that Kenelm had found for him to stay in.</p>

  <p>Over the next few days he stayed in the Excellence City, Kenelm for company and a provider of a rudimentary understanding of the city's environment.</p>
