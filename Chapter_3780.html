<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3780 Demonic Murloc </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Below Luo Zheng, a great creature floated in the dark blue sea.</p>

  <p>While most of its body was shrouded in darkness, a huge outline could be recognized vaguely in the water. Its torso was akin to that of a human's, but its limbs were tentacles several hundred to a thousand feet long.</p>

  <p>It was none other than a Demonic Murloc? a very mysterious race on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Very few members of this race existed, but each one was extremely powerful? they were the strongest creatures in this sea.</p>

  <p>The outside world knew little about these creatures apart from a record that the Demonic Murlocs had once broken the biggest bone cave a long time ago, attacking the creatures inside.</p>

  <p>Typically, they stayed in the deepest parts of the sea, rarely getting involved in the world outside.</p>

  <p>As the Element Spirit race tried gaining their support, the Nihility race and many other races did so as well? they all wanted to rule the Sanskrit Light Stage with the Demonic Murlocs' help.</p>

  <p>But these creatures refused them all.</p>

  <p>Like the Garudas in Stage Twenty-nine, the Demonic Murlocs in Stage Thirty-one couldn't resign themselves to the outside world's power. Perhaps it was their creator's deliberate arrangement, or maybe it was a mere coincidence. So in the end, these races had no choice but to forfeit.</p>

  <p>The Element Spirit race, however, saw a sliver of hope? even while the Demonic Murlocs remained at the top of the food chain, they weren't free from disputes of power within the race.</p>

  <p>When the chance came, the Element Spirit race assisted a Demonic Murloc called Kendall to beat out his competitors and come to sit on the race's throne.</p>

  <p>Even after Kendall became the Demonic Murlocs' king, his subjects still rarely displayed any friendliness to the Element Spirit race. Fortunately, the king himself had made a promise to the Element Spirit race, offering them a helping hand at a critical moment.</p>

  <p>It was at this time that Kendall finally decided to fulfill his promise.</p>

  <p>The Celestial Spear was a gift from the Element Spirit race? it contained terrifying power, and when Kendall wielded it, he couldn't help but be shocked by the sheer force.</p>

  <p>For a long time, Kendall waited beneath the Land of Bone Tribulation because he couldn't attack the creatures within the land.</p>

  <p>But once Luo Zheng left, he could attack him at will.</p>

  <p>And so in theory, if Luo Zheng failed to get the Bone Tribulation Imprints, Kendall probably wouldn't get a chance to attack Luo Zheng in the sea.</p>

  <p>Because of this, Kendall was entirely bewildered by the Element Spirit race's order.</p>

  <p>He couldn't understand how they could be so certain of Luo Zheng's success.</p>

  <p>As he watched and waited quietly in the sea, Luo Zheng indeed obtained the Bone Tribulation Imprints? he even got nine of them.</p>

  <p>'This human is an extraordinary talent?'</p>

  <p>Kendall was completely taken aback by Luo Zheng's achievement.</p>

  <p id="top_27">But since he decided to kill him, he wouldn't hesitate at the last moment.</p>

  <p>Even if Luo Zheng had cultivated the Myriad Tribulations Body, Kendall believed that his all-out attack was more than enough to kill Luo Zheng. The Celestial Spear he got from the Element Spirit race was a great weapon in itself.</p>

  <p>It could increase strength nine-fold, after all.</p>

  <p>If he used 15, 000 divine megatons of force, an attack he launched through the Celestial Spear would contain over 130, 000 divine megatons of force.</p>

  <p>Such was something most people would dread to even imagine.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The sea water's resistance didn't hinder Kendall in the slightest.</p>

  <p>The long spear penetrated the water like a bat shuttling through the night sky, heading straight for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Dropping at the very bottom of the light pillar, Luo Zheng had no time to dodge at all.</p>

  <p>He tried swimming upward, but it was clearly too late.</p>

  <p>'This spear strike is unimaginably great? seems like I have to take it head-on!'</p>

  <p>The moment Luo Zheng thought it, the Celestial Spear had already made it straight to his chest.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The spear pierced Luo Zheng's body with a strange sound.</p>

  <p>In a flash of white light, the Chaotic Source Spirits in his body formed a circling whirlpool.</p>

  <p>The Chaotic Source Spirits, which had increased six-fold in number, managed to neutralize about 100, 000 divine megatons of force. The remaining force of the strike spread throughout Luo Zheng's chest and into his body. But with the tribulation skeleton that had already merged with his body and the nine Bone Tribulation Imprints, he withstood the power all too easily.</p>

  <p>The Celestial Spear only slightly pierced into Luo Zheng's chest, narrowly stabbing into a rib. Traces of blood started spreading in the seawater.</p>

  <p>Withstanding the spear strike that contained such an immense amount of force, he was barely even injured.</p>

  <p>Upon witnessing the scene, the Demonic Murloc was so astounded that his eyes almost bulged out.</p>

  <p>In truth, the spear strike could have easily pierced through his own body? the attack's power was enough to shatter the body into shreds.</p>

  <p>It was a truly formidable spear strike.</p>

  <p>And yet the human managed to survive it.</p>

  <p>Not to mention the fact that he was barely even harmed.</p>

  <p>Was the man really human, one would wonder?</p>

  <p>Because the Demonic Murlocs were born strong, they naturally understood the weakness of many Other Shore creatures.</p>

  <p>Humans were normally the weakest of all.</p>

  <p>But the scene unfolding before Kendall was completely beyond his imagination.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Once the strike was delivered, the tip of the spear quickly dimmed.</p>

  <p>The Celestial Stone couldn't be combined with another Other Shore Token, and it would take a great long time to recover after being used once. Such were the weaknesses of the Celestial Stone? the warriors that wielded weapons forged from this stone usually had to kill their enemies in a single strike.</p>

  <p>Once some powerful warriors in the Source World merged with this Other Shore Token, they faced the same problem. After failing to kill their opponents in a single blow, they'd be left with no choice but to escape.</p>

  <p>When Kendall realized his attack caused no damage to Luo Zheng, he fell into a panic.</p>

  <p>He attempted to flee with the long spear in his hand.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng then reached out and caught the Celestial Spear. Staring into the darkness, he asked, "Who are you?"</p>

  <p>Unsurprisingly, Kendall gave Luo Zheng no reply. Instead, he remained silent and tried to pull the spear back.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng's physical body had been greatly strengthened? he could display a considerable amount of the Civilization Artifacts' power as his physical body was already strong enough to withstand it.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>In an instant, he managed to snatch away the spear from the Demonic Murloc.</p>

  <p>Then, he stabbed down, hacking into the water.</p>

  <p>Over 50, 000 divine megatons of force erupted from his body before it turned the dark blue current into an intense tornado.</p>

  <p>Like an invincible saber, the long spear chopped down.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>As the tip of the spear swiftly slashed against the water's surface, several tentacles were rapidly cut off before black blood spread widely into the seawater.</p>

  <p>While Luo Zheng wanted to chase after Kendall, the Demonic Murloc was more familiar with the water than he was. He fled into the sea at a surprisingly great speed. In the blink of an eye, he completely disappeared from Luo Zheng's view? only darkness remained below.</p>

  <p>"I bet the Element Spirit race sent him," Luo Zheng muttered with a shrug before swimming back into the light pillar.</p>

  <p>Following the light pillar, he returned to the Land of Bone Tribulation. All the Other Shore creatures there gazed at him with wide eyes.</p>

  <p>The power Luo Zheng displayed on the bone island made them both astounded and cautious. The fact that Luo Zheng cut off the Demonic Murloc's tentacles had everyone overwhelmed with fear and awe.</p>
