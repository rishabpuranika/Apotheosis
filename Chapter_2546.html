<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>



  <p>
</p>

  <p>Amos looked at Zheng with disdain. Turning to the woman in emerald, he asked her with bitterness in his voice, "Can I give up now?"</p>

  <p>"Your name has been registered on the list. If you give up, you will be blacklisted and will never be allowed to enter the Immemorial Wilderness again," the woman in emerald replied softly.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Amos felt his heart sink in desolation.</p>

  <p>Sarah, the young lady with a ponytail, and the man with an almost military composure, Hiram, also looked on with downcast faces.</p>

  <p>This was a matter of life and death. Who would dare to joke about it?</p>

  <p>However, regret was a pointless emotion. All they could do was try to make the best of the current situation.</p>

  <p>Yet, Amos was still unwilling to give up. He turned to Zheng, staring at him with a vicious expression. "Man, I am giving you a chance to get away with your life. Now, get out of here!"</p>

  <p>If Zheng quit, there would be someone else to take his place.</p>

  <p>However, if he left, he would be blacklisted and denied the Admission Token of the Nine Li race, and he would be forever barred from the Immemorial Wilderness.</p>

  <p>Hiram and Sarah stared at Zheng, hoping that he would back down in the face of these challenges.</p>

  <p>They had underestimated Zheng's resolve, of course. Zheng looked Amos square in the eyes. "Why should I quit?" he asked pointedly.</p>

  <p>"If you don't quit, don't blame me for being rude," said Amos, a sinister expression appearing on his face. "The Immemorial Wilderness is extremely dangerous. You will die there!"</p>

  <p>"Every time you open your mouth, rubbish comes out," Zheng said flatly.</p>

  <p>Amos opened his mouth to speak, but closed it again, at loss for words.</p>

  <p>He knew nothing he said would sway Zheng. He stayed silent, glaring at him.</p>

  <p>"Well, Amos, forget it. Even if there are only three people in our group, the problem will not be too big. At most, we will be more careful," said Sarah, her voice soothing.</p>

  <p>With a playful smile, Hiram said, "Relax. It won't be a big deal to take a loser with us."</p>

  <p>Eventually, the two succeeded in stopping Amos.</p>

  <p>After the Wild Gods had been divided into groups, they rested in the hall for a while.</p>

  <p>About an hour later, they heard some noises coming from the innermost part of the hall. Then, someone announced, "Master Romeo has arrived!"</p>

  <p>Soon, a young man, dressed all in white, entered, escorted by a crowd of women. He walked slowly, as if time was of no importance to him.</p>

  <p>The young man in white looked no older than twenty years old, but the Wild God Power in his body was much greater than one would expect of a person his age. His aura was unique and mysterious, leaving a deep impression on everyone who encountered him.</p>

  <p>An amiable smile on his face, the young man in white stopped. He looked around him. "Everyone, sorry to have kept you waiting. Please follow me to the Immemorial Wilderness. I hope that you won't waste this opportunity and do your best to collect as many wild bones as you can."</p>

  <p>'That woman said someone from the Nine Li race will lead us to the Immemorial Wilderness. Is this man, Romeo, from the Nine Li race?'</p>

  <p>Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>His mother had told him that he had, too, inherited Chiyou's blood. It was the inheritance of a race, however, not an object, so it was hard to tell just by observation.</p>

  <p>Having finished his announcement, Romeo headed out of the hall.</p>

  <p>The Wild Gods who had been gathering in the hall followed him at once.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Romeo suddenly flew high into the air, and all the Wild Gods followed suit.</p>

  <p>The stronghold of the Nine Li race was a little far from the Immemorial Wilderness. After they had been flying through the air for about an hour, piles of broken bones came into Zheng's vision.</p>

  <p>He knew what that meant. 'We are very close to the Immemorial Wilderness, ' he thought.</p>

  <p>Squinting far into the distance, he saw a semicircle of silver light on the ground in front of him. The silver light curtain extended for tens of thousands of miles until it reached the end of his line of sight, seemingly covering the entire Immemorial Wilderness.</p>

  <p>Romeo led the way, and soon he arrived in front of the light curtain. He took out a unique-looking disk, and gently flung it at the curtain like a frisbee. When it touched the silver light curtain, a crack appeared on the surface, as if it were made of glass.</p>

  <p>"It seems that all the powerful forces in this world have used this method to build barriers against outsiders trying to gain access to the Immemorial Wilderness without permission."</p>

  <p>Romeo went into the Immemorial Wilderness first, and the others followed after him.</p>

  <p>After everyone had entered, Romeo collected the disk and said politely,</p>

  <p>"Now you can begin. I'll leave first."</p>

  <p>The members of the Nine Li race and the Yellow Emperor race needed to train and mature learning about life and death. The Immemorial Wilderness was an excellent training place for them.</p>

  <p>As soon as he had finished speaking, Romeo turned into a streak of light and disappeared as the many Wild Gods looked on, star struck.</p>

  <p>"Well, I must say that Romeo is quite impressive!"</p>

  <p>"It's his birthright. He was born into the Nine Li race. Those who are not born into the Nine Li race cannot access that power. Even if we managed to find a wild bone with the blood of Chiyou, we would still be unable to absorb the Wild God Power it contains."</p>

  <p>"Let's not mention the blood of Chiyou. Just give me a random kind of blood."</p>

  <p>"No way!"</p>

  <p>The blood was determined by destiny.</p>

  <p>Ordinary people could not absorb the Wild God Power from the blood wild bone even if they had one. Zheng, for instance, had dug out a wild bone of the Spirit Wolf God, but he was unable to absorb the Wild God Power from it.</p>

  <p>After Romeo had left, the Wild Gods started to have discussions.</p>

  <p>It was not their first time entering this place. Some of the experienced Wild Gods knew the terrain well, aware of what spots were safer and where to find more wild bones.</p>

  <p>While they were discussing, Amos, Hiram and Sarah continued to ignore Zheng.</p>

  <p>After they had finished, however, Amos finally decided to spare him a glance. "Man, although we don't want to take you with us, since we are here now, you'd better be smart!" he said sheepishly. "Let me take you to a good place!"</p>

  <p>As the Wild Gods left, one group after another, the four that made up Zheng's group flew in their decided direction.</p>

  <p>As he flew, Zheng silently employed the power of his spiritual sense and sent it into the ground below him.</p>

  <p>The moment his spiritual sense reached the ground, his eyes flashed.</p>

  <p>He finally understood why these people were willing to risk their lives to enter the Immemorial Wilderness.</p>

  <p>Having entered the Immemorial Wilderness himself, he sensed that hundreds of wild bones were hidden underneath the surface of the soil.</p>

  <p>No wonder the Immemorial Wilderness of the Iron Tribe had been abandoned. Compared to this place, it was barren.</p>

  <p>Now, Zheng wanted to act on his own. Even if he picked up only the wild bones lying along the border, he would still manage to get a substantial number of them.</p>

  <p>"There's no hurry. The deeper we go, the more wild bones there will be," said a voice in his head. Zheng calmed down and continued to fly, following his group members.</p>

  <p>After about eight miles of flight, Zheng used his spiritual sense once again, this time to check if there were more wild bones under the ground. It made his heart ache to see so many go to waste.</p>

  <p>"Right here!"</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Amos abruptly stopped flying, froze in the air and then descended.</p>

  <p>After the four of them had landed, Amos looked around and said, "Let's look for the wild bones separately. But listen: don't go too far! This is a treasure land. It is relatively safe, and the wild bones are abundant. I've found plenty of wild bones here when I came before."</p>

  <p>With these words, he cast a sidelong glance at Zheng and rolled his eyes.</p>

  <p>"If you are afraid of death, stay here and don't cause any trouble."</p>
