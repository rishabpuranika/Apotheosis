<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Even a powerful Soul Sea Realm warrior would have to reconnect his broken arm if it was dislocated. Otherwise, he would become a cripple.</p>

  <p>No human body had such miraculous regenerative abilities. This was why the Nine Furnace Martial House was becoming increasingly interested in the little monster.</p>

  <p>The martial artists of the Nine Furnace Martial House secretly conducted research on the little monster's body within the Nine Furnace Martial House. One day they discovered the little monster's secret abilities, which could help other martial artists with their cultivation.</p>

  <p>A martial artist was born with some amount of talent. Some medicinal herbs could modify this talent, but these weren't found in the Divine Kingdom Continent.</p>

  <p>In order to cultivate faster and reach a higher level, the four divine kingdoms had established numerous martial houses and constructed countless secret training grounds. They had organized all sorts of matches for martial artists at different levels during which they could constantly temper themselves, fight vicious beasts, and train for life-threatening situations.</p>

  <p>All this was done to unleash their talents and make the most of them.</p>

  <p>When the martial artists of the Nine Furnace Martial House discovered the little monster's talent, they were all excited.</p>

  <p>A warrior at nature level was stuck at a bottleneck for many years. He probably would never have a chance to enter the Illuminating Soul Realm. However, after fighting with the little monster, he was enlightened and soon advanced to the Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>This was the effect of the little monster's talent.</p>

  <p>When he had first entered the Nine Furnace Martial House, he was only at the marrow refining level. He wasn't even a nature creature back then.</p>

  <p>The Nine Furnace Martial House soon discovered that the little monster could help others break through a bottleneck during a spar. However, this was only possible if the gap in cultivation wasn't too large.</p>

  <p>If an Internal Elixir Realm martial artist fought with the little monster, the effects would be minimal, but a nature creature would benefit a lot from fighting with him.</p>

  <p>The Nine Furnace Martial House had specially built a stone tower where they had chained the little monster, and every day, they would send in a different nature-level martial artist to fight him.</p>

  <p>Many martial artists at nature level died at the hands of the savage monster. But, those who survived could rapidly advance to the next level.</p>

  <p>The little monster was not a fool. Even though he was a fierce beast, he was smart enough to learn the purpose of this group of warriors.</p>

  <p>So he refused to fight. No matter how much the Nine Furnace Martial House abused him, or even cut off his hands and feet, the little monster still refused to fight.</p>

  <p>After several months of stalemate, the Nine Furnace Martial House finally compromised.</p>

  <p>It would be a waste to use the little monster simply to cultivate warriors at nature level. If they cultivated the little monster instead, one day he would be able to reach the Illuminating Soul Realm, the Virtual Tribulation Realm, or even the Life and Death Realm. Then he would be of even greater use to the Nine Furnace Martial House.</p>

  <p>Then the little monster fit into the human society. As he grew stronger and stronger, his talent became more and more valuable. After entering the Internal Elixir Realm, he was able to help the Virtual Tribulation Realm martial artists to break through their bottlenecks, and after entering the Virtual Tribulation Realm, he could help many Life and Death Realm martial artists to break through their bottlenecks too.</p>

  <p>Many powerful warriors of the Soul Sea Realm were hoping that the little monster could also help them to break through. That was why they were eagerly hoping that he could enter the late stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm soon.</p>

  <p>If he could enter the Life and Death Realm, he would be able to help out the Soul Sea Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>This was a huge temptation and no one at the Soul Sea Realm could resist it.</p>

  <p>War Emperor York, War King Wind and Turner were stuck at the Soul Sea Realm for countless years. Unfortunately, the resources in the Lower world were too scarce. They were not sufficient for the Soul Sea Realm experts to cultivate in order to reach the next level.</p>

  <p>In this situation, where the Soul Sea Realm experts couldn't ascend, the little monster was their only hope.</p>

  <p>This was how he earned a high status. Even the princes didn't dare to provoke him.</p>

  <p>However, the little monster's cultivation suddenly stopped ever since he attained the late stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm.</p>

  <p>Many Soul Sea Realm warriors were puzzled. The little monster's talent was very powerful. Why was he stuck at the late stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm?</p>

  <p>Ten years had passed and yet the little monster was still at the late stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm, unable to go further into the Life and Death Realm.</p>

  <p>Some of the Soul Sea Realm warriors couldn't wait any longer and went to fight the little monster. However, the gap between the Soul Sea Realm and the Virtual Tribulation Realm was too big, and it didn't work out as anticipated.</p>

  <p>There was nothing that could be done at the moment. They could only wait for the little monster to advance slowly.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the powerful Soul Sea Realm warriors had a long lifespan, so they could afford to wait. He couldn't break through to the Virtual Tribulation Realm in ten years, so they would wait twenty to thirty years.</p>

  <p>It would have been easier to use the little monster to kill Luo Zheng. However, after seeing the battle between Luo Zheng and Fiona, Marine hesitated. The talent that Luo Zheng displayed was also extremely terrifying. Just like the little monster, he also possessed extraordinary theurgy.</p>

  <p>The battle within the enchanted barrier began to get more exciting.</p>

  <p>One of the little monster's hands was tightly wrapped around Luo Zheng. He was forcing Luo Zheng to engage in a hand-to-hand fight. This was the little monster's best strategy. Every part of his body could be used as a lethal weapon.</p>

  <p>None of the martial artists who fought the little monster had any chance of escaping. Without exception, all of them had died.</p>

  <p>But this time, the little monster was facing Luo Zheng. He could turn every part of his body into a weapon, but Luo Zheng himself was a weapon.</p>

  <p>Moreover, after Luo Zheng had refined, his body had become a sacred weapon.</p>

  <p>The little monster's neck suddenly stretched out, and his head swung high up like a hammer and came smashing heavily towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng's expression was calm. His left hand was filled with power, and he threw a punch towards the little monster's head, as if he was punching a sandbag. The power of his punch knocked the little monster's head back more than 200 feet. After crashing into the side wall of the enchanted barrier, the head bounced back and came smashing back towards Luo Zheng with a horrifying force.</p>

  <p>They fought like two fierce beasts.</p>

  <p>Every time they attacked, the enchanted barrier set up by the powerful warrior at the Soul Sea Realm shook violently.</p>

  <p>Virtual Tribulation Realm warriors were powerful. Every punch was forceful enough to crack stone, and every single blow by these two creatures had the same effect. However, because they were trapped in the enchanted barrier, their punches did not look so scary. If the enchanted barrier was removed and they were to fight freely, then the West Dragon River would probably be riddled with holes.</p>

  <p>"I'm stunned by this battle. From the looks of it, there seems to be no way to determine the outcome," said one warrior, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>"Encountering an opponent like the little monster can only be regarded as Tianxing's misfortune. It is difficult to defeat the little monster."</p>

  <p>"But Tianxing isn't weak either. What the heck is his body made of? He should have been hurt many times by the little monster by now, right?</p>

  <p>But he looks just fine!"</p>

  <p>At this point, Luo Zheng became impatient. This little monster was even more difficult to defeat than he had thought. The first thing he needed to do was pull him off his body. So Luo Zheng suddenly turned around and twisted the little monster's other hand, and then he suddenly leaped into the air and stomped heavily on the little monster's chest.</p>

  <p>The little monster realized what Luo Zheng was up to. "You want to get rid of me? In your dreams!" he jeered.</p>

  <p>But in that moment, the forceful energy in Zheng's body suddenly erupted, and as he stretched his legs, the power of the dragon scales within his body also surged out. Luo Zheng was like a meteor, crashing into the edge of the enchanted barrier, but the little monster's hands were still firmly entwined around his body.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had already anticipated this, so when he hit the edge of the barrier, he pulled with all his might.</p>

  <p>Pah!</p>

  <p>The little monster's soft body crashed into the enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>"In my dreams? I don't believe that your body has no limits!" Luo Zheng swung his hands once again and pushed the little monster heavily. The little monster's body instantly got stuck to the barrier.</p>

  <p>Bang, bang, bang, bang!</p>

  <p>A series of loud sounds echoed in the air as Luo Zheng swung the little monster's body, smashing it into both ends of the barrier.</p>

  <p>Every collision caused the barrier to tremble. One could imagine how much the little monster's body was suffering.</p>

  <p>"Um..." Seeing the little monster being treated like this by Luo Zheng, one of the Soul Sea Realm experts got worried and asked the War Emperor York, "Should we stop Luo Zheng? Although the little monster's body is almost immortal, if this goes on, he might die."</p>

  <p>Many powerful Soul Sea Realm warriors had been anxiously waiting for the little monster to enter the Life and Death Realm. Now they were afraid that the little monster would be killed by Luo Zheng.</p>
