<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Never did Zheng think he would be treated as such by the Sun Blind race.</p>

  <p>The huge dragon bone ship seemed to be speeding up. Gradually, the Floating Islands on the Time Sea turned into small black dots until they fully disappeared from Zheng's view.</p>

  <p>The old man of the Sun Blind race remained silent as he returned to the cabin to pull out a delicate cigarette pipe. He then took out a small packet from his waist pocket and poured out powder from it. Zheng did not know what sort of powder it was but it looked as colorful as the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>After the Sun Blind old man ignited the powder, he took a deep breath, emitting colorful smoke.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes flashed with surprise upon witnessing the smoke. A faint layer of the Time Law appeared within the cloud.</p>

  <p>"The cigarette is made from the Illusory Grass in the Time Sea. It produces the Illusion Smoke when used, and within it, you will see an illusion of the past. Do you want to take a puff?" He said before offering the cigarette pipe to Zheng.</p>

  <p>Though Zheng didn't smoke, he was very interested in the Time Law.</p>

  <p>Even after entering the Floating Island, Zheng had almost no chance to cultivate the Time Law. But the smoke breathed out by the Sun Blind old man could spread the Time Law, naturally piquing Zheng's curiosity.</p>

  <p>Taking the pipe from the old man, he fiddled with it before taking a puff.</p>

  <p>The moment he breathed in the Illusion Smoke, Zheng immediately felt something tearing into his throat. After all the small pieces of the Time Law dissipated, they caused some small wounds inside his body.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, the smoke flowed through these wounds until he fully absorbed it.</p>

  <p>Dizziness overcame Zheng and the colorful smoke he coughed out spiraled around in front of him. Then, some scenes began appearing faintly.</p>

  <p>Through the smoke, Zheng saw a huge turtle floating on the surface of the Time Sea. It was tens of millions of miles long and on its back was no city, but an entire continent.</p>

  <p>Zheng squinted, trying to see more clearly, but the smoke quickly floated away until the illusion quickly disappeared from his eyes.</p>

  <p>The Sun Blind old man smiled and asked, "What did you see?"</p>

  <p>"A turtle," Zheng answered.</p>

  <p>"Well, lucky you! You can see the Cliff Spirit on the first puff of the cigarette," laughed the old man.</p>

  <p>"Cliff Spirit?" Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"It is one of the biggest true spirits in the ancient legend, the mount of the Lord of Weapons."</p>

  <p>"Lord of Weapons, Chiyou?" Zheng asked further.</p>

  <p>The old man nodded.</p>

  <p>After mentioning Chiyou's name, Zheng's memory floated back to Tianming whose strength had improved greatly after obtaining Chiyou's treasure.</p>

  <p>Tianming had stepped into the divine land before him, Zheng had no idea where he would now be.</p>

  <p>With Tianming's abilities, it was also possible for him to try every way to enter one of the Floating Islands, but Zheng didn't meet him.</p>

  <p>"What happened to his turtle, then?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"No one knows. Perhaps it was killed or perhaps it left the divine land." the old man explained.</p>

  <p>Since Zheng entered the divine land, he had always tried his best to understand its history. In the Purple Soul Hall, he had also searched through many ancient books and records. Soon, he discovered that some of the ancient histories of the divine land was still incomplete.</p>

  <p>Zheng was totally confused.</p>

  <p>The True Gods' lifespan in the divine land was infinitely long, lasting practically forever. There had to be a few True Gods who had been living in the divine land since ancient times. Under such circumstances, it was impossible to find fault in history. But when Zheng tried to learn from the divine land's history, he discovered that there were many things still incomplete, as if someone had deliberately erased it.</p>

  <p>Once again, Zheng tried smoking a few times. Each time, the illusions he saw were different. Sometimes, it was the incomparably huge red bird, sometimes it was an incomplete picture, and sometimes it was an indistinct figure of a man or a woman.</p>

  <p>According to the old man, these scenes had happened in the past, but most of them were meaningless. Since Zheng couldn't understand those scenes, he stopped trying.</p>

  <p>But what Zheng didn't know was that the colorful smoke he spat out didn't disappear after it drifted out of the large dragon bone boat, hovering over the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>A short while later, a small boat slowly approached the smoke. On it was a member of the Sun Blind race with a weirdly-shaped cigarette pot in his hand. He made a strange gesture, gently opening the cigarette pot and pointing to the Illusion Smoke, still in a constant swirl. The smoke Zheng had puffed out turned into a long snake before it was sucked right into the cigarette pot. This member of the Sun Blind race looked to the direction of the dragon bone ship and whispered as he raised his hand to row the boat away quietly.</p>

  <p>Two hours later...</p>

  <p>The ship finally arrived at its destination.</p>

  <p>The Sun Blind race lived on a group of black islands, much like a dense mass of stars that stood in the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>Several small buildings were built on the islands, only about twenty to thirty feet wide. The seawater below was constantly pitter-pattering as if the buildings could be devoured at any time.</p>

  <p>Witnessing this scene, Zheng further recognized the miraculous situation.</p>

  <p>These Sun Blind people's cultivation levels were not particularly high. At the very least, the ones he saw were ordinary divine citizens. The True Gods treated the Time Sea as a sea of death. Still, the Sun Blind race could easily survive in such an environment.</p>

  <p>The dragon bone ship passed by the small islands before finally entering a major island.</p>

  <p>At the edge of the main island was a wide port where the True Gods of the Floating Islands were still in the middle of gathering.</p>

  <p>"How could there be a dragon bone ship?" a True God asked.</p>

  <p>"Maybe it's the honored guest invited in by the Sun Blind race." another one of the True Gods said.</p>

  <p>The others were just as curious. It was the Astronomical Transit Day, and the honored guests invited by the Sun Blind race were the elites of the wealthy clans on the thirty-six Floating Islands. Whether it were consummate or low-rank True Gods, they were supposed to be treated equally.</p>

  <p>"Honored guest? Is he more honored than us?" Nelly said proudly.</p>

  <p>Standing behind her, Rachelle kept silent. With her were the other consummate True Gods of all wealthy clans such as Walton, Alfredo, the masters of each Floating Island and others.</p>

  <p>It could be said that apart from the Holy Beings and the Demi-holy Beings, the most powerful and talented people of every wealthy clan had gathered there as well.</p>

  <p>Such a group of people could be said to represent the divine land's future. Who else in the divine land could possibly be more distinguished and honored than them?</p>

  <p>But as the dragon bone ship approached them slowly, many of the True Gods widened their eyes.</p>

  <p>A low-rank True God was standing on the deck of the huge dragon bone ship.</p>

  <p>"Who is this guy?"</p>

  <p>"Why was a low-rank True God treated so politely by the Sun Blind race?"</p>

  <p>...</p>

  <p>As they waited, the True Gods grew chattery. Many of them lowered their heads and began whispering among themselves.</p>

  <p>The consummate True Gods quietly looked at Zheng, seemingly lost in thought.</p>

  <p>"It's him?" In the back of the crowd, Alfredo thought the whole situation odd. 'This is the disciple enrolled by Joy into the Purple Soul Hall. How could he be invited by the Sun Blind race to attend the Astronomical Transit Day?' More importantly, why was he getting such good treatment from the Sun Blind race?</p>

  <p>"Ah! It's Tianxing!" Kelsey jumped up and smiled at the sight of Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Kelsey!" But Alfredo stopped her with a frown.</p>

  <p>"Liusu, it is him, indeed," Aleyna murmured.</p>

  <p>Even from a long distance, Liusu's gaze fell right on Zheng's body. Her expression seemed rather complicated. Though she had guessed that Zheng might have been invited by the Sun Blind race, she never thought that they would pay so much attention to him.</p>

  <p>Thanks to Kelsey's reaction, the True Gods there quickly understood what was going on.</p>

  <p>'Is that guy on the dragon bone ship from the Han Clan?'</p>
