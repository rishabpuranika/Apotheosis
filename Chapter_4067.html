  <p>
</p>

  <p>When Tianming entered the Mysterious Yellow Tower for the first time, the bell only rang for three seconds.</p>

  <p>He kept in mind what Gu Bei and the other elders had told him. He could grab whatever he liked in the tower, but he could just take one.</p>

  <p>However, as he only had a few seconds, he didn't have enough time to choose properly. Thus, he just took an Other Shore Token randomly.</p>

  <p>When he realized that the token he got was not suitable for the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, he felt so frustrated. All his efforts were put to waste.</p>

  <p>The second time he entered the Mysterious Yellow Tower, he could now stay for six seconds. The premise still held that he could only choose one of the Other Shore Tokens of his liking.</p>

  <p>Though he still didn't have that much time, he, fortunately, obtained a suitable one this time.</p>

  <p>Seeing that he acquired a useful one the second time, he became more determined. He went in again and bet on his luck. As the bell stopped, he was kicked out by a strong force. According to the Ruin Graveyard, he was actually kicked out by a huge foot.</p>

  <p>However, not even a single Other Shore Token he obtained in the next three attempts he made could be useful to him. So for now, he had to make do with the one he acquired the second time he went in.</p>

  <p>Over time, Tianming improved the strength of his physical body. This made the bell ring for a longer period.</p>

  <p>When he already reached the thirtieth floor of the Mysterious Yellow Tower, the ringing of the bell could now last for five minutes.</p>

  <p>In his next attempt, he directly went to the thirty-first floor as soon as the bell rang.</p>

  <p>There he saw several Other Shore Tokens embedded on the walls of the Mysterious Yellow Tower. Occasionally, there would be a dazzling light emitting from them, containing incredible Other Shore Power.</p>

  <p>Tianming leaned against the wall and walked quickly along the corridor of the thirty-first floor. He analyzed each of the Other Shore Tokens in there so that he could pick the best one for him.</p>

  <p>"This one's the Dead Skeleton."</p>

  <p>It was a mysterious-type Other Shore Token and Tianming was unsure of its ability. He thought that he should aim for something that he could readily use.</p>

  <p>"The Power of Mist?"</p>

  <p>It was a strengthening-type Other Shore Token. However, Tianming didn't lack power, so he deemed to choose something that could boost his other attributes.</p>

  <p>"The Speed Boots."</p>

  <p>It should be a descending-type Other Shore Token that could greatly increase one's speed.</p>

  <p>In the Ruin Graveyard, there were specially assigned beings to record, analyze, and evaluate the Other Shore Tokens which were situated on the top floor of the Mysterious Yellow Tower.</p>

  <p>In particular, their jobs were focused on the new Other Shore Tokens in the tower.</p>

  <p>On the thirty-first floor, there were three special Other Shore Tokens. They were known as the Whirlwind Wings, the Sacred Battle Sword, and the Monta Stone.</p>

  <p>Tianming quickly skipped over the ordinary Other Shore Tokens and focused his attention on these as he got to the section where they were located.</p>

  <p>"Let's see. The Monta Stone could greatly enhance the strength of one's body.</p>

  <p>The Sacred Battle Sword is a masculine type, but the broadsword is not that suitable for me.</p>

  <p>Lastly, the Whirlwind Wings should belong to the descending type. They're supposed to greatly improve one's bodily movement skill." Tianming's eyes flashed with excitement as he stared at the last Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>It was like the pair of transparent wings was tailor-made for him.</p>

  <p>He had already seen and understood the Whirlwind Wings before from the ancient books in the Ruin Graveyard. He was enticed by it the moment he had laid his eyes on the Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>The Whirlwind Wings had been on the thirty-first floor for the longest time.</p>

  <p>After all, only very few people from the Ruin Graveyard could reach this floor. However, in recent years, a group of extraordinary talents started appearing in the divine land.</p>

  <p>If the divine land was given enough time, the number of their strong warriors would definitely surpass that of the Ruin Graveyard.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Tianming knew that the bell would stop ringing soon.</p>

  <p>The ringing started trembling more violently but its sharpness decreased gradually.</p>

  <p>It also meant that Tianming needed to hurry in picking the token of his choice.</p>

  <p>Once the ringing stopped, he would be instantly kicked out of the Mysterious Yellow Tower.</p>

  <p>Without any hesitation, he reached out his hand and tried to grab the Whirlwind Wings. However, just when he was about to touch them, the Whirlwind Wings disappeared and he was only able to touch the wall.</p>

  <p>His eyes widened as his face was filled with confusion. "What happened?"</p>

  <p>But as the sound of bell kept on dissipating, he had not much time to think.</p>

  <p>He clearly thought that he couldn't leave empty handed, so he quickly floated towards the Sacred Battle Sword. However, just as what happened with the Whirlwind Wings, it instantly disappeared just before he grabbed it.</p>

  <p>"Hey! This isn't funny!"</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>The ringing of the bell trembled more and more violently. Tianming now only had about six seconds before he would be kicked out.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Left with no choice, Tianming leaped to the other side of the wall and grabbed the Monta Stone.</p>

  <p>The stone was still one of the strongest Other Shore Tokens on the thirty-first floor, although it was not suitable for him.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The bell made its final ring and instantly stopped. Tianming felt a sudden force bump into his body. The next moment, he had already returned to the Divine Bell City.</p>

  <p>Inside the Mysterious Yellow Tower, the young man in the cyan robe emerged from the dark with a complacent look on his face.</p>

  <p>In his hands, he was holding the Sacred Battle Sword and the Whirlwind Wings that disappeared from the walls earlier.</p>

  <p>"What's your motive for helping him? You always look down upon the people from the Ruin Graveyard, don't you?" the old man asked.</p>

  <p>"No, he's not from the Ruin Graveyard. He's from the divine land," the young man replied.</p>

  <p>"Huh? What's the difference? Those two places have now become one," the old man remarked.</p>

  <p>The young man paused for a while and said with a faint smile, "Maybe, I was just rooting for him. He has a high chance to eventually reach the thirty-third floor. With the Monta Stone, he will reach it faster."</p>

  <p>Upon saying that, he hung both tokens back to the walls.</p>

  <p>There were only extremely few people who could even make it to the thirty-first floor. After Tianming took the Monta Stone, the other two tokens would have to wait a long time again before someone could attempt to grab them.</p>

  <p>A Bell Ringing Meeting was held every month in the Divine Bell City.</p>

  <p>Various races and forces attended this meeting.</p>

  <p>There weren't too many conflicts in the Ruin Graveyard. Human and nonhuman races coexisted without any enmity between them.</p>

  <p>To every race that was residing there, the bell ringing wasn't only a way to enhance their strength. It was also considered as a competition among many races.</p>

  <p>Originally, three non-human races had an absolute advantage in the entire Ruin Graveyard, while the other weaker races had several limitations.</p>

  <p>As for the human race, Gu Bei was the only one they could rely on.</p>

  <p>But as the divine land entered the Ruin Graveyard, its people accidentally discovered that the place was an excellent venue for cultivation.</p>

  <p>The Truths of Divine Dao began to spread quickly in the divine land. The True Gods from various powerful clans and ancestral lands began to cultivate the Truths of Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>The Ruin Graveyard formerly had a reputation of being a dangerous place in the chaos, but as they accepted the divine land, they eventually began following the rules.</p>

  <p>In return, the humans from the divine land also obtained a considerable amount of cultivation resources.</p>

  <p>Over recent years, some of the young talents from the divine land had reached the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>And among them, Tianming was considered to be the most outstanding one.</p>

  <p>He had an extraordinary understanding of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent.</p>

  <p>In fact, he had mastered it in just a few months after he was sent into the Ruin Graveyard.</p>

  <p>The first time he rang the bell of the Divine Bell City, he had successfully obtained a divine megaton of force.</p>

  <p>After he reached the Other Shore Realm, he had been cultivating in the Water Drop Cave.</p>

  <p>The Grand Drip Technique there could quickly enhance one's physical strength. As he entered the Water Drop Cave, he was given special treatment. His rate of progress was just several times faster than that of any ordinary warrior.</p>

  <p>He was considered as a genius and a rising star that appeared in the Ruin Graveyard after all these years.</p>
