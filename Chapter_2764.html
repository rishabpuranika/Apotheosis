</p>

  <p>"An opportunity? What do you mean?" Luo Zheng asked with a puzzled look on his face.</p>

  <p>Sword Chen's eyes, however, were sparkling with excitement.</p>

  <p>Swordsmen were always adamant. Once they made up their minds to do something, they wouldn't give up easily.</p>

  <p>Sword Chen used to be heroic, but after he was corroded by the black water for so many years, not only had his body taken substantial damage, but he had also become more stubborn.</p>

  <p>"An opportunity to control the Abyss Demon Region."</p>

  <p>Then, Sword Chen raised his eyebrows and looked Luo Zheng up and down.</p>

  <p>"Now, we have the perfect opportunity and the perfect candidate. This is simply the arrangement of fate!"</p>

  <p>As a Demi-holy Being, Sword Chen couldn't control the Abyss Demon Region. Even if he was given a chance, he still wouldn't be able to grasp it.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, on the other hand, was merely a consummate True God, so he was the perfect candidate for this.</p>

  <p>"Control the Abyss Demon Region..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng chewed over the words with his mouth, his gaze narrowing slightly.</p>

  <p>Many Holy Beings, Demi-holy Beings, and consummate True Gods from the union of the powerful clans on the Floating Islands, like Tianming and Rachelle, had come here this time.</p>

  <p>The goal of the union was probably to make one of the members gain control over the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had fought with Liusu, Aleyna and Pascal just now. With the help of No. 9527, he had removed the restrictions on Liusu and Aleyna.</p>

  <p>However, Pascal had escaped as fast as he could. Presumably, Samuel was trying to leave at least one behind to take control of the place.</p>

  <p>The Abyss Demon Region was ranked first among the four forbidden lands.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng could control it, it would be a powerful card in his hands.</p>

  <p>"But it's not that easy to grab control of the Abyss Demon Region from the hands of Nicholas and Samuel," Luo Zheng said, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>Nicholas and Samuel had dozens of Holy Beings and Demi-holy Beings to help them. It was impossible for Luo Zheng to fight against them face to face.</p>

  <p>If not for the protection of the black water and Sword Chen, Luo Zheng would already have been on his way to death.</p>

  <p>The only thing he could have used to escape was the Latent Theurgies, and even that might not have worked.</p>

  <p>"Samuel and Nicholas are strong, of course. But we don't have to fight against them face to face," said Sword Chen. "Even if I have no choice but to confront them head-on, I might not lose!"</p>

  <p>"Being trapped in the Sea of Meditation for so many years, you have indeed made great progress in your cultivation. Not many people in the divine land can fight against Samuel directly," Luo Zheng noted in slight awe.</p>

  <p>Samuel was considered one of the most outstanding Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng had never seen his real strength, he assumed that Samuel was not weaker than Nicholas.</p>

  <p>So naturally, it came as a surprise to Luo Zheng that Sword Chen, who was merely a Demi-holy Being, was strong enough to take on Samuel.</p>

  <p>Sword Chen was only a secondary creature from the universe while Mike was only a Holy Being.</p>

  <p>Sword Chen shook his head and said, "I'm only confident because we are in the Abyss Demon Region now. There's no way I can go up against Samuel outside the Abyss Demon Region."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"You have been to the Killing Sword Mountain. Do you know the cultivation method I used in the past?" Sword Chen asked.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded. "You used the Killing Sword Mountain to gather malicious aura, with which you could suppress and abandon emotions."</p>

  <p>Of course, the Emotion Closing Godly Way couldn't be cultivated in this way. It had just been Sword Chen's helpless move in the Evolutionary Universe, but it had been a very clever one.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had gained a great deal from the Killing Sword Mountain, and it was also because of his trip to the Killing Sword Mountain that he had met Xun.</p>

  <p>"I improved my cultivation base with the help of the Jade Scale Butterfly and became a Demi-holy Being after creating my own land. But such strength was still not enough in the Abyss Demon Region," said Sword Chen. "Later, I thought of another way which was similar to the one I used with the Killing Sword Mountain."</p>

  <p>To become Demi-holy Beings, consummate True Gods had to create their own lands which were fundamentally different from the inner worlds.</p>

  <p>For example, Joy had built the Purple Sky Land using the Purple Aura Godly Way. Likewise, Sword Chen had built his own land.</p>

  <p>Both the Purple Sky Land and Sword Chen's land could project a part of them into the divine land.</p>

  <p>"A similar way? Did you build another Killing Sword Mountain here?" Luo Zheng couldn't make sense of it.</p>

  <p>The malicious aura in the divine land was not that powerful. Apart from the Murdering Godly Way, it was useless for the other Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>"That's impossible," said Sword Chen. "You can think of the Sea of Meditation as the Killing Sword Mountain. Since becoming a Demi-holy Being, I have refined 128 longswords. I have inserted them into the Sea of Meditation so that they can absorb the power in the whole sea for my own use."</p>

  <p>The Killing Sword Mountain gathered and delivered the malicious aura by long swords.</p>

  <p>There was a great amount of force of primitive fear hidden in the Sea of Meditation. Taking the Killing Sword Mountain as a reference, Sword Chen had used the force of primitive fear in the Sea of Meditation as malicious aura.</p>

  <p>"I see." Luo Zheng's eyes flashed.</p>

  <p>Before, he hadn't been able to understand what was happening. How could Sword Chen, who was merely a Demi-holy Being, block Samuel's spear?</p>

  <p>The Emotion Closing Godly Way might be one of the reasons, but it turned out that the key reason was the Sea of Meditation.</p>

  <p>"Young master, you also cultivate the Emotion Closing Godly Way.</p>

  <p>Although you haven't managed to build your own land, you can still use the power of the Sea of Meditation. I can help you with the sword array," said Sword Chen abruptly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was somewhat confused. Why was Sword Chen calling him "young master"?</p>

  <p>He didn't know the relationship between his father and Sword Chen. He just wondered if Sword Chen was one of the Godly Geniuses, or maybe a Godly Genius of the last generation.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng had no time to worry about such trivial matters in the situation they were in, so he put them aside for the time being.</p>

  <p>"I can also set up the sword array?" Luo Zheng's eyes lit up.</p>

  <p>According to Sword Chen, Luo Zheng could only use the force of primitive fear in the Abyss Demon Region, but that itself would be enough.</p>

  <p>Now, Luo Zheng couldn't leave this place as the road to the fifth stage was closed, so taking control of the Abyss Demon Region might be the only option he had.</p>

  <p>Like Sword Chen had said, it was necessary to strengthen himself so that he could fight with the alliance of the powerful clans on the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>"Of course you can, young master," Sword Chen replied, nodding his head.</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he took a step forward and stood at the center of the bubble.</p>

  <p>With a gentle flick of his hand, a long table appeared horizontally in the bubble.</p>

  <p>Then, with another wave of his hand, long swords of different styles and lengths appeared on the long table.</p>

  <p>"But the quality of these long swords is poor, and I'm afraid they won't be able to withstand the corrosion from the Sea of Meditation." A hint of helplessness appeared on Sword Chen's face.</p>

  <p>Although he had countless long swords in his own land, they could only be projected when he used the land. It was impossible to directly take them to the divine land. If he took any long swords out of his own land, they would be restored into life vitality.</p>

  <p>The long swords that he had conjured up now were only ordinary swords from the divine land.</p>
