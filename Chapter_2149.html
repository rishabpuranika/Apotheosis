  <p>
</p>

  <p>Not every warrior had the chance to see the Godly Way Tablets. Their existence was elusive and legendary for others.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the comprehension of the Godly Ways under the Godly Way Tablets was an extremely serious test. The power it offered was not easily attained. If things went wrong, their souls might shatter.</p>

  <p>In fact, most proving godly warriors only learned the Godly Ways from the tutelage of True Gods.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, each True God had their own unique instructions.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings knew more about the Godly Ways. As such, if they passed on their knowledge personally, their disciples would better comprehend the Godly Ways. With any luck, they might even gain the Holy Beings' own insights that they couldn't gain from Godly Way Tablets. But not everyone was able to receive such treatment. Only the descendants and disciples of the Holy Beings had the qualifications.</p>

  <p>That was the reason why the disciples of the Holy Beings were so much stronger than ordinary True Gods. Their knowledge and comprehension of the Godly Ways were vastly different.</p>

  <p>Second to the Holy Beings were consummate True Gods, top-rank True Gods, mid-rank True Gods etc.</p>

  <p>The lower one's cultivation level was, the shallower their comprehension of the Godly Ways would be. There were huge differences in the instructions of different low-rank True Gods. A low-rank master would definitely produce a rather weak disciple.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Han House boasted of all sorts of True Gods who had comprehended hundreds of the most common Godly Ways. Therefore, it was the most famous place in Six-Burden Divine City, and countless proving godly warriors wanted to join it.</p>

  <p>However, only a chosen few would truly be part of the Heavenly Han House. It was very picky about its recruitment process.</p>

  <p>The proving godly warriors who couldn't join the Heavenly Han House could only linger around it all day long.</p>

  <p>Lucky for those who failed, the Heavenly Han House was generous.</p>

  <p>Whenever its members were free, they would invite some True Gods to teach the warriors outside the house.</p>

  <p>That was what the old man was doing. He imparted the Five Elements Godly Way today, which was one of the most widely spread Godly Ways in the divine land. Some proving godly warriors who were unable to join the proving godly houses would naturally seize this opportunity to comprehend the Godly Ways for free and listen attentively.</p>

  <p>Zheng had already made up his mind to join the Heavenly Han House.</p>

  <p>Although countless proving godly warriors blocked his path, Zheng was not anxious at all. Nonetheless, he kept his focus on the old man. After the old man's lecture ended, he wanted to make some inquiries. With that thought in mind, Zheng found an empty seat and went up to sit down with his knees crossed.</p>

  <p>He did not intend to cultivate the Five Elements Godly Way. However, the instructions of the Godly Ways contained the truth, so Zheng would also get much from it. With curious eyes, Zheng planned to listen attentively to the old man.</p>

  <p>However, just as he sat down, a bald warrior's face sank. The bald warrior immediately screamed at him, "Get the hell out of my way!"</p>

  <p>Zheng was not aware of the inside information. He only knew that everyone could listen to the lectures of the Heavenly Han House.</p>

  <p>However, the seats in front of the house were in high demand.</p>

  <p>Additionally, the best seats were occupied by some proving godly warriors who stayed in Six-Burden Divine City all year round.</p>

  <p>To obtain the best seats, the warriors fought fiercely. Some fought outside the city, while others fought through other channels.</p>

  <p>Zheng was a newcomer, but he had occupied one of the better seats. As the bald warrior next to Zheng was not familiar with him, he gave Zheng a hard time. The bald warrior looked at Zheng with murderous eyes.</p>

  <p>If the bald warrior kindly advised him, then Zheng would have probably apologized politely and left. He also knew it was inappropriate to occupy the seat and he had to keep the order of arrival. It didn't matter if he had to stay a little far away.</p>

  <p>However, the bald warrior's abusive words provoked Zheng. He glanced at the warrior and calmly replied, "Everyone can sit on this empty seat.</p>

  <p>Why do you want me to leave?"</p>

  <p>"Brat, you're new here, right?" From Zheng's words, the bald warrior immediately learned that Zheng was completely unaware of the inside information. He continued with his rough attitude towards Zheng. "The seat you're sitting on is for the son of Master Pang in the Heavenly Han House. If your parents died early and didn't teach you the rules, I can teach you!"</p>

  <p>As he heard the bald warrior's words, a cold light flashed through Zheng's eyes. The bald warrior had started to get in Zheng's nerves but Zheng was able to restrain his emotions.</p>

  <p>Although the bald warrior had the same level of cultivation as Zheng, the difference between their strength was as wide as heaven and earth.</p>

  <p>Among the proving godly warriors, perhaps only the top disciples from the wealthy and influential clans on the Floating Islands could compete with Zheng. His strength was already above average compared to divine citizens.</p>

  <p>Zheng actually planned to ignore the bald warrior and just sit calmly for the lecture. No matter what the warrior said, it wouldn't be able to shake Zheng. However, the bald warrior had even sworn at Zheng's parents. As such, Zheng was badly triggered.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng was aware that it would be very foolish to create a ruckus in Six-Burden Divine City. To achieve his plans, he had no choice but to endure such profanities.</p>

  <p>When he noticed that Zheng was silent, the bald warrior felt even more offended as Zheng had ignored him. The bald warrior suddenly stood up with an extremely angry expression on his face. Then, with a shameless voice, the bald warrior shouted, "Master Wu, this guy actually criticizes your understanding of the Godly Way! He said you are talking nonsense!"</p>

  <p>The old man surnamed Wu from the Heavenly Han House shook his head as he lectured. Slowly but accurately, he spoke about his comprehension of the Five Elements Godly Way. To share his own comprehension of the Five Elements Godly Way was quite enjoyable for him. He even thought that he could learn something new from such lectures.</p>

  <p>Master Wu's most hated people were those who interrupted his lecture.</p>

  <p>When he heard the bald warrior's words, his face instantly revealed a trace of anger. "Who said I was talking nonsense?"</p>

  <p>"Him!"</p>

  <p>"The new guy!"</p>

  <p>"I heard what he said! He looks down upon you!"</p>

  <p>Apart from the bald warrior, several other proving godly warriors around Zheng suddenly jumped out and pointed at him. All of them looked at Zheng with disdain.</p>

  <p>Those people were probably in the same group. Under the guise of public honesty, their false testimony became quite credible.</p>

  <p>In reality, that was what they usually did. If someone sat randomly in a seat that he shouldn't, they would drive him away in this way. Since there were several of them against a lonesome warrior, their claims would seem even more believable.</p>

  <p>Normally, the True God who taught the Godly Ways would drive out the troublemaker. However, Master Wu took the matter rather seriously. He did not drive Zheng away immediately. Instead, he walked up to Zheng, stared at him and asked, "Tell me, why did you say I talked nonsense? If you can't explain clearly, get the hell out of here. Young people nowadays are getting bolder and bolder. How dare you talk sheer nonsense at the gate of the Heavenly Han House?"</p>

  <p>Everyone stared angrily at Zheng. Apart from a few warriors who knew about the inside story, most of the proving godly warriors felt that Zheng was here to cause trouble. Their free lecture was interrupted by a no-name newcomer.</p>

  <p>In his current predicament, it was useless for Zheng to defend himself.</p>

  <p>Rather, it would only make things worse for him.</p>

  <p>The bald warrior wore a satirical expression. He was secretly happy in his heart. 'This guy brings contempt upon himself. He should have left voluntarily, but he's stubborn. I have no choice but to force him to leave in this way. I wonder how he plans to get out of this.'</p>

  <p>Zheng slowly stood up, cupped his hands towards the True God and said plainly, "From what I see, you were indeed talking nonsense."</p>

  <p>"..."</p>

  <p>The proving godly warriors that saw what happened were greatly dumbfounded. They watched the drama unfold before their eyes indifferently just now, but what Zheng said left them stunned.</p>

  <p>Even the bald warrior was no exception. He stared at Zheng with his mouth wide open. Such a response from Zheng was clearly unpredicted.</p>

  <p>It was one thing to say something in private, but it was another thing to say it in front of others. All of the proving godly warriors there had come to learn the Five Elements Godly Way. As such, they could be considered as the students of Master Wu. Zheng's words greatly embarrassed Master Wu.</p>

  <p>Anyway, Master Wu was a True God. As Zheng humiliated him in public, his face was deathly pale. "What did you say? Say it again!"</p>

  <p>"In my opinion, you were talking nonsense," Zheng repeated as he remained his callous expression.</p>

  <p>"..."</p>

  <p>The faces of the warriors present stiffened even more. Zheng's responses were truly out of their imaginations. Some of them began to whisper among themselves.</p>

  <p>"Is this man crazy?"</p>

  <p>"Although the people of the Heavenly Han House have always been nice, they can't bear to be slandered like this."</p>

  <p>"Even though Master Wu is only a low-rank True God, he has a deep understanding of the Five Elements Godly Way."</p>

  <p>Master Wu's lips hardened and an angry mask shadowed his face.</p>

  <p>However, a burst of laughter suddenly came out of his mouth. "Oh? Why did you say that?"</p>

  <p>'Alas!' Zheng sighed in his heart.</p>

  <p>He didn't want to offend Master Wu, but under the circumstances, he had no choice but to say, "It's a good idea to use the four words of generation, restriction, subjugation, and counter-restriction to summarize the five elements. But Master Wu, what you said is the exact same as the Godly Way Tablet. The Godly Ways can be comprehended in thousands of ways. You have just comprehended the literal meanings and drawn conclusions based on partial understanding. As such, it is very difficult to see through everything."</p>

  <p>"Humph! Most True Gods in the divine land cultivate the Five Elements Godly Way. What's wrong with this concept?" Master Wu felt a trace of surprise in his heart after he heard Zheng's words. Nonetheless, he still questioned Zheng coldly.</p>

  <p>Zheng shook his head. "It's absolutely wrong! We can't follow the old rules when comprehending the Godly Ways. There are twenty-five different forms of the Five Elements Godly Way. However, there are two taboos, namely the fire-wood taboo and the water-earth taboo. We must first remove these two taboos before we can take a step forward. Many low-rank True Gods have no idea of this, so they can't cultivate the Five Elements Godly Way. Presumably, this is also the reason why you have been unable to make progress in the Five Elements Godly Way."</p>

  <p>After Zheng finished his sentence, Master Wu's expression changed! His previously angry expression had disappeared.</p>
