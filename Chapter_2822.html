  <p>
</p>

  <p>Only about twenty years had passed since he attacked Luo Zheng with his sword strike in Mike's universe.</p>

  <p>To the Holy Beings, twenty years were almost negligible in comparison to their long lives.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, who had been considered as insignificant as ants by Murphy, had then grown to such a high level.</p>

  <p>Finally meeting each other once again, the tables had turned. Luo Zheng's huge body now made Murphy as insignificant as ants, which was simply ironic.</p>

  <p>"Father!"</p>

  <p>Calling out with concern, Rachelle quickly flew upward and stood protectively before her father.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng had returned to the divine land some time earlier, many consummate True Gods had witnessed Luo Zheng's great strength. At that time, Luo Zheng was already able to defeat the consummate True Gods with ease, and his strength was comparable to that of a Demi-holy Being.</p>

  <p>And with his strength greatly improved once again, even Murphy wasn't able to withstand Luo Zheng's punch.</p>

  <p>He was now so powerful that both the consummate True Gods and the Demi-holy Beings had to look up at him.</p>

  <p>Apparently, Luo Zheng's control over the True Demon Body had upset the two other people present.</p>

  <p>One of them was Samuel.</p>

  <p>Knowing that he cut off the connection between the two girls, he believed that he was more deserving of the True Demon Body in the ice coffin.</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, he ended up with nothing. One of the girls was obtained by Lowell, while the other one belonged to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>With this thought in mind, he was especially disgruntled at Luo Zheng's luck.</p>

  <p>Witnessing how Luo Zheng was surrounded by red lotuses, everyone believed that he had been burnt to death. However, that was not the case. Samuel couldn't understand how he could have shown up again, safe and sound.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the woman was overwhelmed with mixed feelings as well.</p>

  <p>Her goal was to obtain the True Demon Body. She had tried countless times, but in the end, all her efforts had turned out to be a paving stone for others.</p>

  <p>Despite her failure, she felt pleased to learn that Luo Zheng was still alive. After all, she was born out of the resentment after the extinction of the Nine Li race. Knowing that Luo Zheng had survived, she was pleased that at least one descendant of the Nine Li race would remain.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Stretching out his hand, Luo Zheng suddenly grabbed Murphy.</p>

  <p>Surprised, Rachelle gritted her teeth and defended her father by standing before him.</p>

  <p>But how would she be able to resist Luo Zheng now?</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>A golden light appeared on Luo Zheng's huge palm as it collided with Rachelle, slapping her away. Rachelle spat out a mouthful of blood.</p>

  <p>With Murphy gripped in his hand, Luo Zheng's gaze fell on Nicholas who was standing afar, a glint of anger flashing from his huge eyes.</p>

  <p>After meeting Sword Chen in this place, Luo Zheng couldn't help seeing a glimmer of hope in getting a chance to take his mother back from Nicholas.</p>

  <p>Through Nicholas's Memory Flame, it was very clear that Nicholas had brought Lorena with him to the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>However, with Luo Zheng's previous standing, rescuing his mother would've been reckless and irresponsible. Luo Zheng had only been able to guarantee his own survival and his safe escape from the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>The situation had changed now.</p>

  <p>Merging with the True Demon Body, he had improved greatly. He would be capable of declaring war with Nicholas now.</p>

  <p>"Give me my mother back," Luo Zheng ordered with a cold voice. "Otherwise, I'll crush him to death."</p>

  <p>Hearing these words, Nicholas' eyebrows furrowed slightly.</p>

  <p>"Your mother? What are you talking about? I don't know where she is now,"</p>

  <p>Nicholas answered with a blank expression.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng sneered, "You are the head of the Holy Beings. Stop playing dumb!</p>

  <p>This is ridiculous! I know you have brought my mother with you to this place. Do you think it's only Samuel who can read your memories?"</p>

  <p>Nicholas' face darkened immediately.</p>

  <p>On top of his status and strength, he had always been proud of his astuteness and wisdom.</p>

  <p>Learning that Luo Zheng was able to probe into his memories, and even his thoughts, he knew that he couldn't keep any secrets from both Luo Zheng and Samuel.</p>

  <p>Of course, Nicholas didn't know how their actual skills worked. In fact, Samuel was only able to read the memories of those around him and his ability was greatly limited. On the other hand, since Luo Zheng possessed the Reincarnation Soul Weapon, he was able to read almost everyone's memories throughout the entire divine land.</p>

  <p>"Release her, or I'll kill him," Luo Zheng threatened, waving his giant hand.</p>

  <p>Murphy had no power to resist him at all.</p>

  <p>Sneering coldly, Nicholas responded, "Can you really kill him?"</p>

  <p>The loss Nicholas had suffered in the Abyss Demon Region was something he could still afford.</p>

  <p>After all, these Holy Beings did not really die. They could be reborn in their universes afterwards.</p>

  <p>Hearing Nicholas' response, Luo Zheng knew what he had to do. The power in his hand surged without reservation. With a golden light flashing, he tightened his grip.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>Shortly after, Murphy's body transformed into a cloud of blood in Luo Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>It was the first time Luo Zheng killed a Holy Being, although everyone knew that Murphy wasn't really dead and he could be reborn.</p>

  <p>After Murphy's body had exploded into dust, Luo Zheng took a wide step and headed straight towards Nicholas.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The red-eyed girl followed closely behind him. Standing close to Luo Zheng, her size seemed almost insignificant and unnoticeable when compared to Luo Zheng's.</p>

  <p>Narrowing his eyes, Samuel stared at the red-eyed girl.</p>

  <p>He could not reconcile himself to the fact that Luo Zheng got the True Demon Body. Although Luo Zheng seemed extremely strong now, his method of attack using merely physical strength still didn't scare Samuel off. He believed that having the Spear of Supreme Harmony in his possession was an advantage.</p>

  <p>Having Luo Zheng and Nicholas fighting fiercely would be a pleasure.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Luo Zheng, who was as huge as a mountain, was coming straight to him, Nicholas's eyes narrowed in concentration.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>From his palm, the Truth of Dark and Light Chaos began to swirl.</p>

  <p>Creating a huge eight-diagram disc, it then floated above him.</p>

  <p>Just as they were about to collide with each other, Luo Zheng's body suddenly halted.</p>

  <p>Everyone watching was puzzled, seeing that Luo Zheng aggressively approached Nicholas. What would have made him stop all of a sudden?</p>

  <p>Smiling, Nicholas said, "Sure enough, you can actually peep into my memories."</p>

  <p>In fact, Nicholas had foreseen what would happen next. As the eight-diagram disc that he summoned was extremely sharp, it should destroy Luo Zheng's arm like a spiraling millstone.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng had already seen the same pictures from Nicholas' memory.</p>

  <p>Theoretically speaking, they had already fought once in the past 'future'.</p>

  <p>Since Nicholas had predicted the result, and Luo Zheng could read his memory, he had to give up his attack knowing it would be a failure.</p>

  <p>Therefore, this round of fight, which was supposed to have happened, would no longer be a reality.</p>

  <p>Frowning slightly, Luo Zheng took another step. He chose to attack from the right this time. But halfway through his attack, he suddenly stopped again.</p>

  <p>This signified a second round of a "could have been" that didn't come into reality.</p>

  <p>With a complacent smile, Nicholas said, "Your body seemed to have been refined and enhanced, but you are underestimating me if you think you can defeat me with your physical strength!"</p>

  <p>After all, Nicholas was the head of the Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>In the Abyss Demon Region where the Grand Teleportation technique could not be used, the Spear of Supreme Harmony worked to Samuel's great advantage. In addition, the flames and ice created by the two girls had made it easier for him to kill members of the powerful clans.</p>

  <p>Anyway, it still would not be easy for Samuel or Luo Zheng to kill Nicholas easily.</p>

  <p>From the eyes of their spectators, the fight between Luo Zheng and Nicholas that did not happen was so bizarre. The only person who could understand their strange behavior was Samuel, since he was also able to read Nicholas' Memory Flame. Each time, he could see the pictures of their fight that didn't come into reality.</p>
