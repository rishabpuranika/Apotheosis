<br/><br/>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>A sense of urgency arose in the Evil God.</p>

  <p>He realized it was necessary to urge the two billion brains.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The Evil God instantly projected his will into the brains.</p>

  <p>"You should realize the meaning of your existence, and that is to find out the best way to obtain infinite energy. Once you obtain it, you will all have freedom and everything your hearts desire!"</p>

  <p>Hearing this, these brains began chattering with their spiritual senses.</p>

  <p>"Of course!"</p>

  <p>"We are about to achieve an unprecedented feat!"</p>

  <p>"I want a world of my own!"</p>

  <p>Two billion brains responded, one after another.</p>

  <p>Once he obtained absolute infinite energy, the Evil God would be able to create countless worlds to accommodate them all.</p>

  <p>The Evil God had always pursued freedom. These brains had the same goals as him, but since they existed in the form of brains, they could only help him achieve his ultimate goal.</p>

  <p>"But I'm afraid the victory has already been decided in the Burial Land, and we have almost run out of time. No matter which side wins, we would lose the chance to resist," the Evil God said with a serious honesty. "So, please hurry up with your efforts!"</p>

  <p>"The higher the level of energy, the less kinds there are, and the faster it will be!"</p>

  <p>"We will try our best!"</p>

  <p>"You will win the unprecedented glory for us all!"</p>

  <p>Two billion brains responded in unison. Although the Evil God was omnipotent, he couldn't hear every brain's response, but he could choose to listen to the most popular ones.</p>

  <p>The energy of the ninth-grade world was known as Cube, and there were only sixteen kinds.</p>

  <p>Just as the brains had said, they became more and more skilled at restoring energy, and once the kinds of energy decreased, their speed of restoration became faster and faster.</p>

  <p>Basically, every five minutes, one more kind of "Cube" energy formed.</p>

  <p>After one and a half hours, the sixteen kinds of energy of the ninth-grade world had been restored.</p>

  <p>Then they proceeded to restore the energy of the tenth-grade world, which was known as Phase. Its number was reduced by a half to eight.</p>

  <p>Very soon, these eight kinds of energy were also restored.</p>

  <p>The energy of the eleventh-grade world was known as Frequency, and its number had been reduced by another half to four.</p>

  <p>The energy of the twelfth-grade world was known as Coke, and it possessed only two kinds.</p>

  <p>The Evil God anticipated receiving the essence of the energy, so he became more and more excited.</p>

  <p>In the blinking of an eye, he landed on the deck of the black ship and paced back and forth.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven, Duran, Shera, Edna, and the former captain stood on the other side of the deck, their eyes following the steps of the Evil God.</p>

  <p>In fact, they wanted to know what the Evil God had achieved, but when they saw the serious look on his face, no one dared to question him.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Suddenly, countless spiritual senses gathered about the black ship.</p>

  <p>There were too many invisible spiritual senses to fully discern. Their presence even caused a gentle wind to stir Shera's and Edna's long hair.</p>

  <p>After receiving the information from the spiritual senses, the Evil God shut his eyes lightly.</p>

  <p>After a short moment, he opened his eyes, and they lit up brightly.</p>

  <p>"I see!</p>

  <p>I see!</p>

  <p>I see!" the Evil God shouted into the void.</p>

  <p>"Dear..."</p>

  <p>Edna called out to him with concern.</p>

  <p>As if he hadn't heard her, the Evil God asked, "What do you believe the energy to be?"</p>

  <p>Hearing this question, Shera blinked her large eyes. She raised her right hand, and a mass of energy gathered like a blood mist around it. "For me, energy is a tool for killing."</p>

  <p>"Energy? It's the root power to maintain my bloodline's might," said Duran.</p>

  <p>"It's the way to rule everything," the former captain responded.</p>

  <p>Edna pursed her lips, wanting to express her opinion. She considered it for a while but gave up.</p>

  <p>After a while of contemplation, the Grandmaster of Heaven said, "Energy forms all materials. The two can mold each other."</p>

  <p>The Evil God grinned, giving him a thumbs up before he continued to question, "Where do the energy and materials come from?"</p>

  <p>"They come from higher-grade worlds," the Grandmaster of Heaven replied.</p>

  <p>The Evil God nodded. "If, and I do mean if... What will happen if we transform all the materials into energies and consume them?"</p>

  <p>Hearing this question, the Grandmaster of Heaven frowned. It was difficult for him to adequately answer it.</p>

  <p>Energy was used to create a world, and the energy consumed in this process would be transformed into materials.</p>

  <p>Energy also had the ability to destroy everything. What happened to the energy used in this process?</p>

  <p>"The consumed energy has completely disappeared, and so has everything else," the Grandmaster of Heaven replied.</p>

  <p>"You think it has disappeared, and I also once believed it had disappeared.</p>

  <p>Everyone believes it has disappeared, but in fact it does not disappear at all!" the Evil God countered.</p>

  <p>"But then what has happened to it?" the Grandmaster of Heaven questioned in puzzlement.</p>

  <p>"It has entered the void." The Evil God exaggeratedly opened his arms in a gesture of hugging the void. "The void is overflowing! All the space, so devoid of any material that we can see, is actually filled with energy! The space in a cup, the space in a room, and also the space in a world are all bursting with energy!"</p>

  <p>Shock was painted all over everyone's face.</p>

  <p>"How is that possible?"</p>

  <p>"There is nothing within the void."</p>

  <p>"If there really is energy in the void, how come we can't sense it at all, let alone use it?"</p>

  <p>The Evil God looked at them as if he was looking at simpletons and unhurriedly explained, "According to my calculations, the energy that is transformed from the materials in the Deep Space, the main world, and all the secondary worlds only makes up twenty percent, while the invisible energy in the void accounts for the remaining eighty percent. More importantly, even when the energy in the void is consumed, it still returns to the void. In this sense, it is absolutely infinite!"</p>

  <p>It was like drawing water from a lake for a bath. After the bath, the water was poured back into the lake. In this way, the water would neither decrease nor increase, and it could be used repeatedly.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven gasped for breath. The words of the Evil God seemed so unbelievable, but now it made perfect sense. He continued to ask, "If what you say is true, how can we prove it?"</p>

  <p>"Prove it?"</p>

  <p>The corners of the Evil God's mouth curved upwards, and he gently raised his hand towards the sky.</p>

  <p>A light blue colored ribbon unrolled, and this was the Field of Static Electricity.</p>

  <p>Following that, a dark red colored ribbon flowed out, representing the Life Field.</p>

  <p>Then more fields in black, white, yellow, green, and other colors unfolded like the lines of a rainbow.</p>

  <p>The energy consumption of these Fields was astonishing. Previously, it had been too difficult for the Evil God to activate the Restriction Field, but now, he could easily display all eighty-six different Fields, one by one.</p>

  <p>"From the moment this world was created, the energy in the void remained unknown to us. We simply couldn't comprehend its existence, let alone use such energy," the Evil God proudly stated. "But now, I have discovered the truth."</p>
