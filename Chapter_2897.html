<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2897 Mountain Power </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The forbidden lands, which were the domains defined by the creator, were considered almost sacred and inviolable in the eyes of the people dwelling in the divine land. These lands remained indestructible.</p>

  <p>However, in the eyes of the Yellow Emperor Guards, other than the Mountain of Holy Beings and the Ruling Slate, they could handle everything else with their bare strength alone.</p>

  <p>Harold had destroyed the transmission arrays connecting other places and the Everest Spirit Mountain in advance.</p>

  <p>After receiving Leyton's order, Samuel led the Holy Beings of the powerful clans to the Everest Spirit Mountain. Of course, his group included Hamish, Salim, and Lorcan.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings of the powerful clans seemed to hold a slight indifference in this whole affair. Primarily, they didn't want and never aspired to work for them. But when they joined the alliance, they were left with no choice but to reluctantly go with them as if it was part of their allegiance.</p>

  <p>Equipped with such confidence, the three Yellow Emperor Guards and the Holy Beings found themselves at their mapped out destination half a day later. It was the region where the Everest Spirit Mountain rested.</p>

  <p>This forbidden land was not as large as the Abyss Demon Region, as it only occupied half of the area of the region.</p>

  <p>Standing on a barren mountain, the group unknowingly focused their gazes towards a light enchanted barrier. The space covered by that magical barrier belonged to the Everest Spirit Mountain.</p>

  <p>"Even if we destroy the Everest Spirit Mountain, Harold wouldn't be waiting for us there. He will leave, and there is a chance that he would flee to the Swirl Forest," Samuel claimed in a tone full of certainty.</p>

  <p>The other Holy Beings did not speak or react even though they heard his words distinctly. They kept a stiff upper lip.</p>

  <p>Murphy and Clark also kept silent, giving off an impassive stance.</p>

  <p>It looked like they were all still not entirely convinced. The Yellow Emperor Guards might feel that everything went smoothly at this moment, because to win them, they imparted to them the Truth of Dark and Light Chaos. But, it seemed that they fell short in their expectation, and they still needed to work harder to gain their full support.</p>

  <p>For instance, the members of the former alliance of the powerful clans, like Murphy, had a real good relationship with Nicholas. How could they submit to their enemy Samuel? Likewise, other powerful clans held so much resentment in their hearts as they were forced to join the alliance. And there was no room for refusal.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter. There are not many forbidden lands for them to hide. If we can destroy the Everest Spirit Mountain, we'll continue to head for the Swirl Forest," countered Hamish, reassuringly, after a moment of reflection.</p>

  <p>He seemed in a daze, but he was sharply looking at the enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>Previously, the Yellow Emperor Guards had suffered a lot when they pinned their hopes on the Sea Cracking Skull and the Ruling Slate. But now, after they contacted Clement, they had a sudden boost of confidence generously bursting from within.</p>

  <p>And killing the people in the forbidden lands was no more than a casual task.</p>

  <p>"Come on, everyone," Hamish ordered, gesturing with a flick of his hand.</p>

  <p>His words didn't fall on deaf ears, after all. Under the command of the Yellow Emperor Guards, many Holy Beings began to attack the Everest Spirit Mountain in unison.</p>

  <p>Even though they did not try their best, they were able to cause destructive damage with a wave of their hands at the very least. The ripples of internal momentum spread from the light enchanted barrier that separated the Everest Spirit Mountain from the divine land. The tremendous vibration reverberated incessantly.</p>

  <p>While Samuel's group was hell-bent on creating destruction, on the top of the Everest Spirit Mountain, there seemed to have a sense of stillness.</p>

  <p>Harold, who was dressed in his favorite white, was found to be sitting cross-legged, basking in tranquility.</p>

  <p>He was savoring this moment down to the core, because ever since Mike returned, the burden on his shoulders was lifted, and he felt so much relaxed.</p>

  <p>But it didn't take long before troubles came, and he was getting an eyeful of it.</p>

  <p>"They really launched an attack,"</p>

  <p>Harold mumbled, watching the north of the Everest Spirit Mountain.</p>

  <p>He could feel it deep down the moment the Everest Spirit Mountain was attacked because he had integrated with the mountain.</p>

  <p>At this juncture, a huge roar came, followed by a strong sense of vibration, like an earthquake.</p>

  <p>"What's going on, Harold?"</p>

  <p>And as if on cue, Marsh on the other side of the mountain top was seen flying towards Harold, wearing a grim face.</p>

  <p>He couldn't believe his eyes with what he witnessed. The forbidden lands were known to be almost indestructible. But now, with such resounding loud noises produced, something grave indeed happened.</p>

  <p>The Moon Clan was situated very close to the Swirl Forest. They had chosen this place after their departure from the Floating Island, while the Sword Clan decided to opt for the Everest Spirit Mountain.</p>

  <p>"Some people are attacking the Everest Spirit Mountain," Harold sternly replied.</p>

  <p>Marsh, who looked bewildered at the sudden turn of event, seemed to have something to come to his mind. Then he thoughtfully asked, "The Yellow Emperor Guards?"</p>

  <p>"They haven't made a move yet," countered Harold beaming a smile.</p>

  <p>Crossing his arms on his chest, he went on, "It's those Holy Beings who are attacking."</p>

  <p>"Then what should we do?" Marsh casually asked, frowning. His face was etched with worry.</p>

  <p>"Get out of here," retorted Harold, curtly.</p>

  <p>Harold then recalled that previously, Mike had ordered him to develop a transmission array that led to the Swirl Forest. So no matter which place was assaulted, they would immediately give up that place to flee to the other.</p>

  <p>Soon after he finished talking, he flashed and quickly disappeared.</p>

  <p>And at the next moment, he appeared on the edge of the Everest Spirit Mountain.</p>

  <p>The sight of numerous Holy Beings of the powerful clans incessantly wreaking havoc by attacking the enchanted barrier of the Everest Spirit Mountain unfolded before him. When they sensed Harold's oppressive presence, they immediately stopped.</p>

  <p>Glancing at Harold, Samuel spoke disdainfully, "Your strength is not powerful enough to fight against us. If you choose to surrender, I can persuade Master Hamish to spare most of you."</p>

  <p>"Right now, it's indeed hard to fight against you, but who knows what will happen in the future?" Harold calmly pointed out.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>With his body sticking to the light enchanted barrier, Samuel threatened coldly, "But you have no future! It won't be long before all of you die!"</p>

  <p>Harold also slowly attached himself to the light enchanted barrier, mimicking Samuel's move as if to taunt him. He stayed very close to Samuel, with his lips slightly open. He uttered something, but Samuel didn't hear a single word of it.</p>

  <p>"What did you say?" Samuel demanded. The confusion was evident in his face.</p>

  <p>"I said, you can have a try." Just as the words fell from his lips, he flexed his hand and deliberately threw a solid punch at Samuel.</p>

  <p>Then his right arm started to swell wildly.</p>

  <p>And simultaneously, the large Everest Spirit Mountain behind him gradually emitted an infinite luster. It glowed like a moon in an evening sky!</p>

  <p>Countless cracks subsequently emerged on the surface of the mountain body. And not long after, the strength source that was flowing in every crack directly all gathered on Harold's right arm, shredding the sleeve covering his right arm in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>In the divine land, the Everest Spirit Mountain symbolized the legend of power.</p>

  <p>It was told that there was someone in the remote past who had been moving with the Everest Spirit Mountain on his back. But after arriving in the region where the mountain was located at present, he couldn't go any further and was pressed at the foot of the mountain. As time went by, the mountain absorbed his strength and became the symbol of power in the divine land.</p>

  <p>In terms of pure combat power, it was very likely that Harold couldn't beat Samuel, because it was extremely tough to use the power of the Everest Spirit Mountain to fight.</p>

  <p>After taking control of the Abyss Demon Region, Samuel didn't take the rulers of the other forbidden lands seriously as he only ignored them. He didn't think that there would be an unexpected attack from Harold, so he was caught unprepared.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>The light enchanted barrier of the Everest Spirit Mountain had an attribute.</p>

  <p>It could block everything, but it wouldn't block its ruler.</p>

  <p>Harold's punch had drawn almost half of the mountain power. Such a massive amount of strength source could mean several dozen times greater than that of a Holy Being. The second it gathered in Harold's fist, a 100-foot gravitational field was suddenly formed.</p>

  <p>The space in the gravitational field collapsed toward his fist. Since he was caught off guard and unprepared, Samuel was pulled over by the power. His body clung to the light enchanted barrier in a sorry state.</p>

  <p>It was too late for Samuel to realize what happened. He had been unable to display the Grand Teleportation to dodge Harold's punch. And at this crucial moment, he could only pull himself up.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The punch struck him painfully hard in the chest!</p>

  <p>Although he was a Holy Being, his body was as fragile as a piece of paper.</p>

  <p>It was nothing in front of such power. The punch directly smashed his half body into pieces.</p>
