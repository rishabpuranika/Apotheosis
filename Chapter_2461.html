  <p>
</p>

  <p>Reinhard was completely confused. He asked, "What do you mean by that, Luo Zheng?"</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>At that moment, two rays of red light shot through the mist and beamed on the wall, constructed by avatars.</p>

  <p>The Multiple Antennae Snake still refused to give up.</p>

  <p>Looking at that wall, Luo Zheng said, "The mystery behind the debate venue is no longer a secret for you guys. I am aware that most of the people came for the inheritance of that skeleton."</p>

  <p>He paused for a moment and then continued, "Let me rephrase it. The debate venue was designed by the skeleton, who wanted to choose a successor for himself. Am I right?"</p>

  <p>Tyrone of the Mu Clan sneered, "You are talking plain nonsense. Everyone knows that."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng just smiled indifferently. Tyrone's attitude hardly bothered him. "If that is the case, then the skeleton had completely lost his senses. Otherwise he wouldn't have set up such a debate venue."</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Yan couldn't help giggling, On the other hand, most people were still clueless about what Luo Zheng meant.</p>

  <p>But the guy with soybean-like eyes nodded and said, "That's true. Since the intention behind creating this debate venue was to pick up a successor, it was impossible for the skeleton to design an unbreakable dead end!"</p>

  <p>The Truth of Goodwill and Malice permeated in the debate venue.</p>

  <p>As per Reinhard's explanation, the debate venue used the Truth of Goodwill to test the True Gods' comprehension of the Truth of Divine Dao, and everyone would be in possession of a powerful avatar.</p>

  <p>The Truth of Malice would detect what those True Gods feared the most and create incarnations of their fears.</p>

  <p>It sounded normal.</p>

  <p>But then, the avatars were weaker than the incarnations of fears, and the True Gods were unable to bring their power into play.</p>

  <p>In other words, the avatars were useless to fight with these powerful incarnations of fears.</p>

  <p>Facing the Snake Spirit, all the avatars were trying their best to kill the group of snakes, but they still lost a considerable number of True Gods.</p>

  <p>"In the debate venue, neither a consummate True God nor a Holy Being can pass the skeleton's test. As for top-rank True Gods... I believe everyone present should be able to represent the top-rank True Gods in the divine land. Even so, it's still impossible for us to even move a single step. It clearly means that the skeleton doesn't want to find a suitable successor after all," Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>Duke exclaimed with a mocking smile, "In that case, let's all retreat now!"</p>

  <p>"You're right. Retreat is the only option we have right now. If we continue to fight at the debate venue, we will end up dead!" Wesley echoed.</p>

  <p>For the alliance of wealthy clans, their goal was to ruin this debate.</p>

  <p>It would be perfect if the two siblings of Luo Clan were killed here. On the other hand, it was a good choice to let everyone return home.</p>

  <p>In this way, they didn't need to sacrifice their own lives to get Luo Zheng and Yan killed.</p>

  <p>After the people from the Dongfang Clan took the lead to incite them to quit, the people from the Tang Clan, the Fang Clan, the Mu Clan, and the Leng Clan all followed suit.</p>

  <p>Earlier, a few True Gods had also revealed their intention of going back, but they were held down by Reinhard.</p>

  <p>Now that everyone had encountered such a huge disaster, they wanted to quit even more.</p>

  <p>"I agree. There is no point in continuing when there is no hope."</p>

  <p>"It's not too late to go back now."</p>

  <p>"If we keep moving forward, I'm afraid we will face our end soon!"</p>

  <p>Except for the soybean-eyed guy, Yan, Luo Zheng and those from the Sword Clan, almost all the other True Gods seconded Duke and wanted to leave the debate venue.</p>

  <p>Reinhard was anxious when the situation turned its table. 'Clever of Duke to turn the tide in his favor!' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>A few True Gods had wanted to go back earlier, but Duke didn't say anything at that time.</p>

  <p>When the time was right and everyone's courage was wiped out, Duke made the suggestion and automatically it got the approval from many True Gods.</p>

  <p>But for Luo Zheng, Yan and the Sword Clan, they had no other choice but to keep moving forward.</p>

  <p>"Go back?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng glared at Duke and said, "The road to go back is always there. You can choose to leave this very minute. And this option is also available for the members of the Floating Islands. Your presence here is hardly of any help.</p>

  <p>And I have to be on my guard against you."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had always been the enemy of the alliance of wealthy clans, and there was no way that the members of the alliance would let him go. He was well aware that both he and Yan were on their hit list. Hence he openly offended them all.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean? And how dare you talk to us in such a manner!"</p>

  <p>Duke's face darkened and his aura began to spread.</p>

  <p>"For the sake of repeating myself, you can go back instead of merely creating a nuisance here!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng said with a cold sneer.</p>

  <p>He hardly finished speaking, when the True Gods from the alliance of wealthy clans, including Gino, Wesley, Tyrone, Ellis, Gage and Donne, stepped forward. They all displayed their weapons and unleashed their auras.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's words were so demeaning that it almost brought upon a war on them.</p>

  <p>Reinhard was astonished with Luo Zheng's erratic behavior. He could not understand the reason Luo Zheng chose this moment to provoke them. But despite his inhibitions, he always stood by Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>As soon as the sword was pulled out, it radiated with absolute brilliance.</p>

  <p>"Form the array!" he ordered the members of the Sword Clan.</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish! Swish!</p>

  <p>Solomon and the disciples of the Sword Clan immediately stepped forward and stood before Luo Zheng, to protect him.</p>

  <p>Yan's head tilted to one side slightly, and her eyes had a murderous look.</p>

  <p>Her eyes shone a dangerous purple light. She had very striking features, making her look beautiful from any angle.</p>

  <p>As for the soybean-eyed guy, he too stood beside Luo Zheng. A sword appeared in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, why did you instigate them? Is this time for a war?" Reinhard asked him using his life vitality.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng ignored his question as he said to the crowd, "I am sure that these avatars are not just used to defend against the enemies. They must be more powerful than what we see. There should be some secret in the debate venue that is yet to be exposed. Knowing more would help us fight against those incarnations of fears!"</p>

  <p>"So what? Where to find out the secret? At any rate we will be dead long before that! Can we just give up and go back? Right now, we really don't care about the inheritance of that skeleton!" a True God exclaimed in a desperate tone.</p>

  <p>"You can always leave, if you chose to," Luo Zheng said, shrugging his shoulders.</p>

  <p>Hearing Luo Zheng's words, the true God turned to Duke and asked, "In that case, would you please take us away?"</p>

  <p>Anyone who looked keenly, could clearly see the situation.</p>

  <p>The warriors in the debate venue were divided into two groups.</p>

  <p>One was led by Luo Zheng and Reinhard, and the other was the group of people from the alliance of wealthy clans, led by Duke.</p>

  <p>Those grassroots True Gods, and the other True Gods from neutral Floating Islands did not dare to leave alone. After all, if they left by themselves, they would probably encounter greater danger.</p>

  <p>But if Duke took the lead to turn back and leave the debate venue, they would gladly be willing to follow.</p>

  <p>"Yes Duke, we are willing to take your side and go back with you," said a True God from a neutral Floating Island.</p>

  <p>"Why bother yourself, by trying to bring some sense to them? If they wish to court death, they are free to do so at their own will."</p>

  <p>This time, it was Duke's turn to be in a dilemma.</p>

  <p>His sole purpose of coming to the debate venue was to prevent Luo Zheng and the others from obtaining the inheritance of the skeleton.</p>

  <p>How could he leave the debate venue before his mission was completed?</p>

  <p>According to the rules of the debate venue, the fiend that had never appeared in the mist had existed because of his fear. Once he left the debate venue, the fiend would also disappear.</p>

  <p>This was a result that he could not accept.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked at Duke calmly with a smile on his face, waiting for what he had to say.</p>
