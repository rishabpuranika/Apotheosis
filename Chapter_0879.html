  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Good job!" Zheng praised enthusiastically.</p>

  <p>The corners of Olivia's lips curled up with pleasure as she smiled. "I'm far from being on par with you!"</p>

  <p>Olivia had already been a tenth level war general, while Zheng had only been a tenth level war fighter before. Even after he had refined the Lucky Light, he still only ranked as a first level war general now.</p>

  <p>But Olivia knew that she was far from being a match for Zheng.</p>

  <p>Apart from Olivia, all of the other human war generals on the tenth floor had also gathered around. Even Dylon, who was driven mad by jealousy of Zheng, also looked at Zheng with respect now.</p>

  <p>Now, not only had Zheng shocked the entire Tower of Sin, he had also shocked the entire Purple Heart Sacred Place of the human race.</p>

  <p>When Zheng had entered the Tower of Sin for the first time, people of the Purple Heart Sacred Place felt that as long as Zheng grew stronger in the Tower of Sin, it was very likely that he would help the human race to win a seat.</p>

  <p>Humans were so weak. They would be very contented indeed if they were able to gain even one more seat in the Tower of Sin. After all, the four seats which they already possessed had not come easy.</p>

  <p>The higher Zheng had climbed in the Tower of Sin, the more he had shown his strength and potential. The warriors in the upper floors of the Tower of Sin and the Purple Heart Sacred Place now paid more and more attention to Zheng. After Elder Jing had met with Zheng, he had concluded that not only would Zheng help them obtain a seat in the Tower of Sin, but the seat which he would earn could rank within the very top. He would potentially enter into at least the top thirty among the 128 seat owners.</p>

  <p>Elder Jing thought very highly of Zheng! However, since the day that humans had entered the Tower of Sin, not one of them had been able to rank in the top 50!</p>

  <p>From the moment in which Zheng had entered the Tower of Sin, the four human seat owners at the top of the tower had also been closely watching his progress. No one had expected that after he got out of the Talent Tablet, he would have come into such a huge conflict with the ogres. The Demon Night was also involved.</p>

  <p>More unexpectedly, Zheng had single handedly turned the tide. Even the two war sages, kept in the Tower of Sin through some secret means by the ogres, had been kicked out by Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng's performance so far had greatly exceeded Elder Jing's expectation every time. Of course, Zheng had surprised and dumbfounded all the races on the Sea God Continent.</p>

  <p>The Tower of Sin had always been at the focus of all the sacred places of the Sea God Continent. Now Zheng's name had spread like wild fire throughout the Sea God Continent in just a few days.</p>

  <p>On the Sea God Continent, it was similar as in the Central Region where the talents who had a chance of entering the Soul Sea Realm were called divine-level talents. But there were two extra words that had appeared before Zheng's name on the Talent Tablet, which read, 'Celestial Position'. As a result, Zheng was now called the Celestial Position talent by tens of millions of creatures.</p>

  <p>As to why these two words had appeared before Zheng's name, only Zheng knew the reason. Perhaps it was because Zheng had obtained the recognition of the Celestial Position race.</p>

  <p>"Elder Jing wanted me to bring you a message. Let's go to the living area to talk about it," Olivia suggested. This public place where they were now was surely not a good place to talk.</p>

  <p>Of course Zheng was aware that the Purple Heart Sacred Place wanted to ask him for help. Zheng's appearance had allowed the humans to see a great opportunity for them to rise in rank. The sacred places of a dozen races on the Sea God Continent were clustered around the Tower of Sin. Almost all of them were built around the spire.</p>

  <p>The strength of the warriors in the Tower of Sin directly reflected the strength of the sacred places they belonged to.</p>

  <p>Therefore the ogres and the Demon Night, who controlled the most seats in the Tower of Sin, had the most powerful sacred places.</p>

  <p>If Zheng could help the human race secure more than ten seats, then with the increase of human seat owners, a greater number of humans could access the Dark Nether Cave, and the more likely it was that they could obtain greater opportunities there. All of the races on the Sea God Continent placed great importance on gaining more seats in the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>Outside of a secret chamber on the tenth floor of the Tower of Sin, several tenth level human war generals were standing by, guarding the place.</p>

  <p>Inside of the secret chamber, under the faint yellow light, Olivia's face appeared gentle and soft. She tried her best to make her smile look more natural, but she still looked a little nervous.</p>

  <p>It wasn't just Olivia, Elder Jing, and the many human war lords in the Tower of Sin all felt uneasy. Even the human top-level war lords and the four human seat owners were feeling nervous and worried. They were being swayed by considerations of gain and loss.</p>

  <p>One basic reason for their fidgeting was that Zheng was not a member of the Purple Heart Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>During the past few days, the Purple Heart Sacred Place had carried out a large-scale investigation into Zheng. After many inquiries, they had finally found a crucial piece of information— the place where Zheng had first appeared was in the Heavenly Eagle Prairie!</p>

  <p>There was a force of the Purple Heart Sacred Place that had been stationed at the border of the Heavenly Eagle Prairie. According to the information they had gotten from the squad, after Zheng had suddenly appeared on the Heavenly Eagle Prairie, he seemed to have saved a group of people from the pasture of ogres.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Eagle Prairie was not a strategically important area, so the ogres, the human race and the Demon Night had only sent a small part of their forces to be stationed at the place.</p>

  <p>However, the three Soul Sea Realm masters in the Purple Heart Sacred Place knew that there was actually an ancient transmission array hidden in the Heavenly Eagle Prairie. In the past, humans and ogres had sent many warriors to enter the transmission array, but none of them had ever returned.</p>

  <p>So they had assumed that this ancient transmission array must be for travelling across great distances.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the people of the Purple Heart Sacred Place had quickly begun speculating that Zheng hadn't come from the Sea God Continent, but from another continent! They wondered if he had traveled through the array from some far off and distant land then.</p>

  <p>Zheng was therefore a passerby to this continent. Although he was also a human, they were not sure that he would definitely apply his hand to help the Purple Heart Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the sword spirit that had suddenly appeared at Zheng's side seemed to be very important to the Demon Night, and she had turned out to be one of the queens of the Demon Night. Though essentially different from the ogre race, the Demon Night was not close to the human race either.</p>

  <p>It would all depend on Zheng's will and determination. So Elder Jing sent Olivia to first inquire about Zheng's intentions.</p>

  <p>Elder Jing had even hinted that if possible, Olivia was to sacrifice herself...</p>

  <p>Olivia was not a child. She had immediately flushed upon grasping the meaning behind 'sacrificing' herself. The human race had endured being despised for so many years, and now they had finally grasped onto a lifesaving straw. They were indeed very cautious and nervous, fearing that this life-saving straw would float away at any time.</p>

  <p>As a divine-level talent trained by the Purple Heart Sacred Place, Olivia would indeed 'sacrifice' herself for anything that would be in the interests of the Purple Heart Sacred Place. However, Olivia also knew that Zheng was not a skirt chaser. Was it that Elder Jing and the senior leaders of the Purple Heart Sacred Place had overthought this?</p>

  <p>"What message did Elder Jing want you to bring to me?" Zheng asked curiously as he saw the hesitant look on Olivia's beautiful face. They had moved to the living area where they could speak freely.</p>

  <p>Olivia stared at him. Her gaze was like the rippling waves of the sea, enigmatic and filled with energy. She was an extremely intelligent woman.</p>

  <p>After thinking about it for a while, she then blurted out without any beating around the bush, "Elder Jing wanted me to ask you just how much you could help us."</p>

  <p>Zheng raised his eyebrows. He instantly understood what Olivia was hesitant about. However, he liked her straightforward approach. Truthfulness was a rare quality which he respected. He chuckled and said, "If possible, I will wipe out all of the ogres from the Tower of Sin!"</p>

  <p>Olivia gasped at Zheng's words. "Wipe out all of the ogres from the Tower of Sin? Can you really do that?"</p>

  <p>Zheng shrugged and replied with equal honesty, "I am not sure, but I will do my best!"</p>

  <p>Hearing his words, Olivia felt relieved. Although she hadn't spent much time with Zheng, the man that she had come to know was not the type of person who talked big. He either said nothing or stuck it out to the end once he gave his word.</p>

  <p>"Right now, there are also different opinions conflicting within the ogre race. But I guess that they will still come to you for negotiation," Olivia looked a little worried as she said this.</p>

  <p>She only said half of what she had intended to say. The other half was actually that if the ogres promised Zheng huge benefits during the negotiation, would he change sides?</p>

  <p>"Negotiation?" Zheng cocked one eyebrow as he considered this possibility.</p>

  <p>Then he smiled and said, "Then I'll see how much they can offer!"</p>

  <p>There were indeed disagreements raging within the ogre race.</p>

  <p>On the top floor of the Tower of Sin, there were a total of 128 spaces, each of them separated from one another, similar to the Sumeru Space in the space ring. However, space rings couldn't house living beings, while the space on the top floor of the Tower of Sin didn't have such a restriction.</p>

  <p>Each seat owner had their own space. This was also the reason why there were always only 128 seats at the top of the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>Every space had a door that bore the number of the seat in it. For example, Esther from the Demon Night ranked first out of 128 seat owners, so her space was number one.</p>

  <p>Maurice ranked second among the one hundred and twenty-eight seat owners, so his space was labelled as number two.</p>

  <p>During this period of time, the twenty-six seat owners of the ogre race gathered together every day, arguing endlessly about how to deal with Zheng.</p>
