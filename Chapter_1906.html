  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was quite familiar with the Sanskrit language.</p>

  <p>So he immediately recognized the word, as soon as it was revealed.</p>

  <p>The entire structure of the Sanskrit was smooth, but complicated. Each stroke looked like they were made up of small tadpoles.</p>

  <p>A single word in the Sanskrit usually contained around 30-40 strokes.</p>

  <p>Each language carried the culture of a race. In general, the simpler the text, the more excellent it was. After all, learning a language cost time.</p>

  <p>Moreover, it was easier to learn and understand a simple language.</p>

  <p>In his entire journey, Luo Luo Zheng came across many races and was familiar with their languages. But he had never seen a race with such complex language.</p>

  <p>If his guess was right, this race that practiced the Sanskrit language was definitely a very intelligent race. Perhaps this race existed within the divine land.</p>

  <p>The golden Sanskrit word flashed for a moment, and then completely disappeared. Luo Luo Zheng suddenly realized that his group was getting further and further away from him.</p>

  <p>He frowned as he felt a bit peculiar about the situation.</p>

  <p>The group was moving unusually fast in the dark.</p>

  <p>Realizing that there was something strange going on, Luo Luo Zheng increased his pace and chased after them.</p>

  <p>While chasing them, Luo Luo Zheng could hear Kennan, Han Liusu, Chapman and Kaydan whispering to each other. But their voices were sounding softer, implying that they were getting farther away.</p>

  <p>"Kaydan!" "Chapman!" "Han Liusu!" Luo Luo Zheng shouted after them.</p>

  <p>However, they reacted as if they did not hear him at all. They were still whispering to each other and continued to move away.</p>

  <p>"What is happening?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng realized that there was little he could do about the situation.</p>

  <p>Moreover, he had yet to recover his strength. Till now, his body had only recovered ten percent of the strength after absorbing the dragon scales' power.</p>

  <p>"Once they realize that I am not around, they will probably stop and search for me. But, from the looks of it, these people don't find anything amiss." Luo Luo Zheng frowned.</p>

  <p>What Luo Luo Zheng was not aware was that there was one more person in the group.</p>

  <p>That person's Mu Ning, appearance, and even the voice were exactly the same as Luo Zheng's. Generally, these warriors could use their senses to check their surroundings, but even Han Liusu didn't notice anything out of the ordinary. They thought that Luo Luo Zheng had suddenly become very silent, due to the exhaustion of his strength.</p>

  <p>After chasing them for a while, Luo Luo Zheng stopped. He knew that it was all in vain.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stood rooted in the same spot, completely swallowed by the darkness, as if everything around him had turned into nothingness.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a golden light flashed, and a Sanskrit word appeared in front of him.</p>

  <p>It was another different word in Sanskrit. It shone for some time before disappearing into darkness.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng let out a breath as he began to think.</p>

  <p>There had to be a reason why he was the only one left behind.</p>

  <p>'Is it because I can see those golden Sanskrit words?'</p>

  <p>In the darkness, Luo Luo Zheng tried to adjust to the surroundings. From the moment he had entered the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, the master of this land had been selecting some warriors.</p>

  <p>Since he dealt with the Nine Divine Stars in such a way, there had to be a reason for it.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng saw those golden words, no one else had any reaction. That meant only Luo Luo Zheng could see them!</p>

  <p>Maybe that was the reason for choosing him over others.</p>

  <p>As to why Luo Luo Zheng wasn't able to catch up with his group, it should be someone's deliberate efforts!</p>

  <p>While thinking through, Luo Luo Zheng grew calm.</p>

  <p>With his strength depleted, Luo Luo Zheng was afraid of encountering a strange beast that he would not be able to fight at all. The beasts in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land were quite powerful. He was afraid that he would not be able to resist them in this state.</p>

  <p>At this moment, he was still rooted at his original position because he knew it was impossible for him to walk out of this space no matter how hard he ran.</p>

  <p>With a flash of golden light, another complicated word appeared before his eyes, and disappeared in a flash.</p>

  <p>Different Sanskrit words kept appearing before him. Luo Luo Zheng was not sure what the connection was between these words, but he memorized every word.</p>

  <p>After some time, Luo Luo Zheng suddenly heard a faint sound of someone breathing.</p>

  <p>"Huff?"</p>

  <p>This breathing sound was quite faint, but in this silent environment, Luo Luo Zheng was still able to hear it clearly.</p>

  <p>There was someone around!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng extended his senses to a radius of several thousand feet.</p>

  <p>Sure enough, he could notice someone slowly walking towards him through the darkness.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng clenched his fists tightly, and the chaotic sea within him began to surge.</p>

  <p>Without the ability to use the Nine Divine Stars, Luo Luo Zheng could only use his chaotic energy. However, his cultivation restricted Luo Zheng's strength. With his cultivation at the Spirit Supreme Realm, it was easy for him to fight against a Spirit Transformation Realm warrior. However, if he encountered a world lord, it would prove difficult to fight against him or her.</p>

  <p>"Wait! Don't panic! I am not a threat," a soft voice sounded from not too far away.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Luo Zheng's fists loosened up a bit. He did not feel the person's killing intent, so he went ahead and asked, "Who are you?"</p>

  <p>"Me? Ha-ha!" The person standing in the darkness smiled. "You just took away about a third of my strength source. Shouldn't you thank me first?!"</p>

  <p>Hearing this Luo Luo Zheng was completely astonished.</p>

  <p>The strength source he had taken away belonged to the master of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. All throughout, the warriors from the divine land called him 'Holy Jay'.</p>

  <p>"You? are Holy Jay?"</p>

  <p>Excluding Mike, the strongest person Luo Luo Zheng had ever come across was the young man who had abducted Yan that year.</p>

  <p>Now that Luo Luo Zheng suddenly came across a Holy Being, he felt a great sensation in his heart. Although he didn't feel any Mu Ning from that Holy Being, he was still a top-level existence at the divine land. He should be on the same level as Mike and Luo Zheng's master.</p>

  <p>"That is what the others call me. Since my name is very long, ordinary people can't remember. Hence the name Holy Jay," the Holy Being replied.</p>

  <p>"Very long? How long is it?" Luo Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>The man let out a long string of words in the darkness.</p>

  <p>These words were spoken in a language Luo Luo Zheng had never heard before. The series of words took nearly one minute, and the sounds rose and fell as if in a melody.</p>

  <p>"Did you note it down? That's my name," the man smiled faintly.</p>

  <p>...</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was totally speechless.</p>

  <p>This name had to be at least a few hundred syllables long!</p>

  <p>From the beginning to end, Luo Luo Zheng had only heard one word, and that was the last word of the name, 'Jay'.</p>

  <p>Presumably, this was the origin of the name "Holy Jay".</p>

  <p>After a moment of silence, Luo Luo Zheng uttered, "I might as well also call you Holy Jay."</p>

  <p>Holy Jay smiled faintly and said, "The name is just a symbol, you don't need to bother so much."</p>

  <p>"Hmmm," Luo Luo Zheng responded and nodded, his heart filled with doubts. Since Holy Jay came to find him alone, he must have a purpose. The reason why he locked him in this dark place was not to make fun of him, right?</p>

  <p>Holy Jay might have heard Luo Zheng's thoughts, because he said, "Since the moment you entered the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, I have been paying close attention to you, Luo Luo Zheng from the Evolutionary Universe. That is why I changed your teleporting area."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's heart skipped a beat. As he wandered around the Collapsing Mountain race and the Skyland race, Luo Luo Zheng knew that his teleporting area was off the mark. Nine out of ten Godly Geniuses had been teleported to normal places. Only he had been teleported to an abandoned place.</p>

  <p>"I also arranged for the young daughter of Holy Samuel to meet you, so that she would believe that you are her chosen one," said Holy Jay with a faint smile. "My arrangement seemed terrific. Both of these two sisters seem interested in you."</p>

  <p>...</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was rather speechless at this new revelation. Holy Jay's first few words were initially very formal, but he instantly changed the topic and tone. No matter how he looked at it, the words of this Holy Being sounded difficult to digest.</p>

  <p>"Don't be under the assumption that I am not serious. To Holy Samuel, Han Liusu is very important. It's not just the fire that she has. It will be beneficial if there is a Holy Being as your father-in-law," continued Holy Jay.</p>

  <p>"Holy Jay, I am married already. I will never play up to anyone. It is against my belief and principles." Luo Luo Zheng couldn't control his annoyed tone, although he was facing a Holy Being.</p>

  <p>"Hey! I don't need to listen to your thoughts. Do not forget, there is nothing that I can't do in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land," said Holy Jay with a smile. The Divine Refinement Forbidden Land was built by Holy Jay himself, and in this place, he was an omniscient existence.</p>

  <p>No one could stop him if he wanted to do something.</p>

  <p>"But you can't change my mind, can you?" Luo Luo Zheng said in a firm deep voice.</p>

  <p>Holy Jay smiled and asked, "What if this concerns your father's life and death?"</p>
