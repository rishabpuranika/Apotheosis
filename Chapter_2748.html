<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2748 The Desperation Plain </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Begaus was unable to compete against Luo Zheng, who was even taller.</p>

  <p>A shocked expression covering his features, he looked up at Luo Zheng, whose figure was increasing exponentially.</p>

  <p>The fiend's colossal figure had been the greatest advantage in his arsenal.</p>

  <p>Now, for the first time, Begaus felt tiny and helpless like a leaf in the wind.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, Luo Zheng had grown to become a giant who was fifty thousand feet tall.</p>

  <p>His huge body cast a giant shadow over the ground. The mountains before Luo Zheng were like small bumps. Their might was meaningless.</p>

  <p>"What's this?"</p>

  <p>Leland sputtered, staring at Luo Zheng's giant body.</p>

  <p>Compared to Luo Zheng, he was as small as an ant. Luo Zheng's size shook him to the core.</p>

  <p>The three top-rank True Gods in the corner were also dumbfounded as to how this was possible. They were clueless about what had happened.</p>

  <p>"Now who is to be pulverized?" Luo Zheng sneered.</p>

  <p>Thud! Thud!</p>

  <p>Begaus took a deep breath and suddenly turned around, retreating in a hurry.</p>

  <p>Stomp!</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng stepped, the earth around cracked. The crack spread and extended several thousand feet. Magma flowed out from it.</p>

  <p>Begaus thought he was lucky to dodge Luo Zheng's attack.</p>

  <p>But deep inside, he felt helpless.</p>

  <p>The fiend race attached great importance to any intruders. The strongest of their warriors had assembled on the sixth stage.</p>

  <p>As the leader of the sixth stage, Begaus was powerful and held high status.</p>

  <p>He had himself volunteer to confront the trouble and go all out to solve it.</p>

  <p>However, he had never expected to face this monster!</p>

  <p>Was this person still a human being? How could his stature be so great?</p>

  <p>He managed to dodge when Luo Zheng tried to trample him for the first time, but he failed to do so the second time.</p>

  <p>Stomp!</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng stepped on Begaus's head with his foot, the latter's vision blurred. The disturbing and violent sound of a crack was heard.</p>

  <p>Begaus was stunned for a while and realized that his bones were broken. He fainted in a flash.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng crushed Begaus, he reached out, his hand slapping at something around him.</p>

  <p>His hands were like two enormous doors and the previously giant birds were as tiny as flies in front of him.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng hit them, the giant birds and the fiends were flung backward, decimated by one swoop of his hand.</p>

  <p>After a short while, Luo Zheng had killed almost all the beasts. Sharp cries escaped from the remaining two giant birds. They flapped their wings and escaped.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked into the distance, finally dispersing the Wild God Power.</p>

  <p>"Poo!"</p>

  <p>His body continued to shrink to the size of a normal person.</p>

  <p>Leland was perturbed at what he saw when he looked at Luo Zheng again.</p>

  <p>How could the size of Luo Zheng's body instantly bloat to tens of thousands of feet?</p>

  <p>As a Demi-holy Being, Leland had never heard of such a theurgy...</p>

  <p>Begaus had great strength. Leland would have found it difficult to defeat him.</p>

  <p>But now, Luo Zheng had trampled Begaus to death. If Leland had not witnessed it with his very own eyes, he would have found the piece of information unbelievable.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's expression did not change a bit. He said to the strange fish, "How far is it now?"</p>

  <p>The strange fish looked at Luo Zheng with fear in its eyes.</p>

  <p>Although it didn't care about its own life or death, any creature always had a natural fear of the mightier ones.</p>

  <p>"The Desperation Plain should be before us. It's not so far away now. Once we pass through the plain, we will reach the exit to the fifth stage. As long as we move fast, we can escape!"</p>

  <p>His reverence for Luo Zheng only lasted for a moment. The strange fish was thrilled once again.</p>

  <p>On the Desperation Plain, waves of black death aura surged around Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The spirit of death could swallow everything.</p>

  <p>If a healthy divine citizen were to reside on the Desperation Plain, their life energy would drain out of their body in a span of two days. They would turn into a corpse and lie there forever.</p>

  <p>Even the fiend race was not particularly fond of the Desperation Plain, although the aura of death posed no threat to them.</p>

  <p>This time, however, almost four hundred fiends had inhabited the place, ready to take action at any moment.</p>

  <p>In addition to these fiends, there were thousands of Abyss Demons in the place.</p>

  <p>The Desperation Plain was the only path to the sixth stage of the Abyss Demon Region from the fifth stage. This time, the Holy Beings had launched an attack. The fiend race did not have any other choice but to send out the little fiends to test them. The resistance hadn't been large-scale.</p>

  <p>The fiend race did not seem willing to capitulate. They tried to block the Holy Beings on the Desperation Plain.</p>

  <p>"Aah!"</p>

  <p>Two loud sounds followed.</p>

  <p>The two giant birds flapped their wings hastily, coming into view from another direction. They landed on the Desperation Plain.</p>

  <p>A fiend walked up to the two birds and communicated with them in a strange language. His expression changed.</p>

  <p>"Something has gone wrong on Begaus's side," he then reported to the fiend commander. "There has been an accident."</p>

  <p>"An accident? On the pasture?" asked the fiend commander doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"Begaus has been killed. The humans on the pasture appear to be very powerful," the fiend said.</p>

  <p>The fiend commander frowned.</p>

  <p>He had thought that the creatures creating mischief on the pasture were insignificant human warriors, so he had directed Begaus to deal with them.</p>

  <p>But it seemed that the strength of the human warriors went far beyond his assumptions.</p>

  <p>"Begaus is useless. I will go and deal with them myself!" another fiend said lightly.</p>

  <p>The fiend commander shook his head. "There's no need. If they want to leave here, they have to pass through the Desperation Plain first. Our garrison is stationed here. No one can pass through the Desperation Plain without going through us first. Master Gallio is coming soon, so we can wait here."</p>

  <p>Right now, they would rather let the human warriors come to them than seek them out themselves.</p>

  <p>As soon as the fiend commander finished speaking, black smoke billowed over from behind the Desperation Plain.</p>

  <p>Hearing the faint sound, the fiends turned their heads.</p>

  <p>As the black smoke circled around them and dissipated, Gallio's giant body stepped out.</p>

  <p>Thud! Thud! Thus!</p>

  <p>The fiends fell prostrate on the ground.</p>

  <p>The four great fiends, including Gallio and Stuart, held great status in the fiend race.</p>

  <p>They got their high status not by relying on their own strength. In their legends, these four fiends were renowned, which was why they were able to possess more Faith Energy and become the superiors of the fiend race.</p>

  <p>Standing there, Gallio looked into the distance and saw a huge door of space.</p>

  <p>"Generals and soldiers, today, your enemies are the Holy Beings of the divine land," Gallio said coolly. "You are to live forever. But if you were to die today, you will become stronger in the future! Those seemingly powerful humans are only the stepping stones for us to enter the divine land!"</p>

  <p>The fiends were not afraid of death, because in their minds, they had no concept of life and death. For them, death was only a loss in their cultivation bases.</p>

  <p>What truly excited them, however, was setting foot into the divine land.</p>

  <p>"Yes! Bravo!"</p>

  <p>Hundreds of fiends roared. Their loud cries echoed on the Desperation Plain.</p>
