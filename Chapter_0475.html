<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 475 Return Home For Revenge (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As she was imprisoned on Hell Mountain, Yan had been separated from her family members for several years. She was also almost completely isolated from the outside world. Yan did not expect that when she finally saw her brother, Zheng, she would hear the news of her beloved father's death.</p>

  <p>Yan felt great sorrow, and the urge to avenge her father was strong.</p>

  <p>Killing desire boiled inside her.</p>

  <p>Yet, her killing desire was shown in a very gentle way. Even though her eyes became red and welled up with tears, she still looked elegant and beautiful. In her brother's eyes, she looked like a little wounded female leopard, on the edge of bursting with her grief and anger.</p>

  <p>Obviously, he had sensed the life vitality, in the shape of sharp spikes, floating around her. Yan practiced a unique cultivation method. It was so special that the life vitality around her was a reflection of what she was thinking, which meant that she could visualize her thoughts through her life vitality.</p>

  <p>She turned her head suddenly, and all spikes were aimed at Elder Xu.</p>

  <p>Her abrupt action startled Elder Xu. Of course, with his strength, Elder Xu was naturally not afraid that Yan would hurt him. Instead, he was worried that Yan would not be able to withstand the grief she was feeling. After all, she was still a little girl, even younger than Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Elder Xu, I want to leave Hell Mountain for a few days," Yan said calmly.</p>

  <p>Elder Xu was lost in silence for a while. According to the rules, it would be unwise for him to allow Yan to leave Hell Mountain. Cloud Sect had imprisoned Yan at Hell Mountain in the name of cultivation. If she left and something dramatic happened, it would hurt Cloud Sect's reputation.</p>

  <p>"Didn't our sect leader give her that permission before? He said that my sister, Yan, could leave Hell Mountain for a short time," Zheng reminded Elder Xu about the permission given by the head of Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>"Well, I am not saying it's impossible," Elder Xu said as he thought,</p>

  <p>'After all, the Eastern Region is not close to the Central Region, and even if Yan leaves for a short while, the people in the Central Region may not find out about her leaving.'</p>

  <p>"In that case, please allow me to leave for a while. Although I am trapped on Hell Mountain in the name of my practice, no one dictates that I have to practice all the time and that I can't go out for a walk and some fresh air, right?" Yan reasoned calmly.</p>

  <p>She had long known about the fact that she had been chosen to be a sacrifice for an evil array by a certain mighty master. Yet, she had decided how she would deal with the fact.</p>

  <p>If someday in the future, that mighty master managed to gather three women with the Purple Power Body and the cultivation level of Internal Elixir, Yan would commit suicide if she had not found alternatives. In this matter, she was indifferent, unlike Zheng, because she could choose to kill herself at any time and no one could stop her.</p>

  <p>"I can apply for permission on your behalf from our leader. But I need to know what your purpose for leaving Cloud Set will be." Elder Xu asked, wanting to confirm the details.</p>

  <p>Yan looked at the distant mountains with cold eyes. Although she was a girl, she was also a warrior practicing martial arts. If she didn't have a strong heart after stepping on the road to practice martial arts, she would have no long-term development. Thus, although the terrible news of her father's death saddened her, Yan would not behave like other girls by immersing herself in grief and self-pity.</p>

  <p>The world of cultivators involved blood, killing, cruelty, and firm will.</p>

  <p>Still, she was not completely cruel and cared for her brother and father.</p>

  <p>Now, her father's death hardened Yan's heart and made her appear harsh.</p>

  <p>She gritted her teeth and uttered four words, "Return home for revenge!"</p>

  <p>These four simple words sounded powerful and full of killing aura!</p>

  <p>Hearing Yan's words, Elder Xu nodded. He understood Yan's reaction. It was impossible for anyone to swallow such pain, and any cultivator would kill those who had murdered a member of their family.</p>

  <p>Elder Xu then looked at Zheng as he waited for his answer. Elder Xu did not care about the private business of the Luo Clan, but he knew a little bit about it. As Yan's brother, Zheng should make decisions about such matters.</p>

  <p>Zheng heaved a big sigh. He knew that he had to return home to handle family affairs. After much thought, he said, "I've been away from home for so long. It's time to return. But there is still one last competition between Patrick and me! After the competition, we'll head home."</p>

  <p>"All right! I also want to watch this competition. I want to see for myself if my brother is lying! Are you that awesome?" said Yan, blinking her eyes.</p>

  <p>Elder Xu said with an awkward smile, "You little girl, I am a senior elder. Do I need to lie to you about this kind of thing?"</p>

  <p>"It's possible!" Yan said as she adjusted her mood and gave a soft smile.</p>

  <p>Her smile was so dazzling that it lit up her face and added a layer of soft splendor and beauty.</p>

  <p>Although Yan believed in Zheng, she still found it hard to accept. How could her brother compete for the first place during the All Peaks Competition only through his strength at the second grade of the nature level?</p>

  <p>She wanted to see it with her eyes.</p>

  <p>For the next three days, Zheng practiced in a secret room and processed everything he had learned from the All Peaks Competition.</p>

  <p>The most important thing for a cultivator was talent and foundation.</p>

  <p>For example, although some disciples from the top seven noble clans might have high talents, their actual combat effectiveness was not strong.</p>

  <p>On the one hand, they did not work hard to practice, and more importantly, they took well-refined pills to cultivate and improve their cultivation level. Thus, their foundation was somewhat unstable despite their virtually high level.</p>

  <p>It was not impossible to practice by taking well-refined pills, but before taking the pills, one should build a solid foundation.</p>

  <p>If his foundation were not stable, it would negatively affect the top level that one might reach, which meant that he might meet the ceiling and could not make a breakthrough.</p>
