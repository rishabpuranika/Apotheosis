  <p>Libby's question made Zheng and the three Ear Mice realize this was a problem that needed to be addressed.</p>

  <p>The bone caves in the Sanskrit Light Stage formed the most complicated maze any of them had ever come across. Up until now, there was still no one who had completely worked out the entire maze.</p>

  <p>"Deviating too far from our original route would be disastrous, I'm afraid,"</p>

  <p>Fidel said seriously.</p>

  <p>Zheng considered their options for a while before finally saying, "Those Ghost-claw Worms always leave traces, and we can go back the same way we came by following those traces they've left."</p>

  <p>After that, he turned and began walking back.</p>

  <p>Zheng had sliced the Ghost-claw Worms' heads off at the neck and they still struggled on the ground. Even now they still stretched out three fingers in an attempt to grab Zheng as he passed.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>The long sword in Zheng's hand shook, and with a flash of sword radiance, he had cut the wriggling heads in halves.</p>

  <p>Zheng and the Ear Mice felt more comfortable with their plan after seeing these Ghost-claw Worms. Zheng had killed many along the way so it'd be an easy trail to follow back...</p>

  <p>They followed the corpses, walking the wrong way on several occasions before they had finally found the original path they had taken here.</p>

  <p>The Ear Mice had come from a different bone cave and recorded a different path. Now they too, like Zheng, were counting on Libby to lead the way.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, although it was Libby's first time in the Sanskrit Light Stage, she was very smart and remembered the way to the Land of Bone Tribulation clearly.</p>

  <p>"There are eight bone caves in the bone cavity. We should take the seventh one..."</p>

  <p>"There are two roads here. We should take the left one..."</p>

  <p>"The first bone cave..."</p>

  <p>Under her guidance, they continued onward, slightly uphill.</p>

  <p>Just as Fidel had said, they were in fact still in the sea formed by the Soul Interdicting Water. If they broke through a wall of a bone cave, the Soul Interdicting Water would gush in.</p>

  <p>But many bones were in the water, looking like countless tubes.</p>

  <p>The route the Ear Mice had taken had been submerged by the Soul Interdicting Water, but everything was fine for the one the human race had recorded in their documents, and they continued smoothly along the way.</p>

  <p>The size of the Sanskrit Light Stage was no smaller than that of the Blooming Jade Stage. Zheng and his companions climbed up the bone caves for four hours before they finally came to a huge bone cavity.</p>

  <p>There were many bone caves of different sizes here. The largest was massive and the smallest was only as big as a fist.</p>

  <p>Zheng looked around and said, "It seems that all the bone caves are connected to this bone cavity?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, this one is our Ear Mice's bone cave," said Fidel, pointing at a cave that was neither too big nor too small. "That is the bone cave of the Separate Abyss race... Eh?"</p>

  <p>Fidel shrieked as it pointed at a wide bone cave. It was so large that even those of the Separate Abyss race could walk through it freely. This was indeed their bone cave. But there was something odd about it; a green light flashed at the entrance of the cave as if reflected by a mirror. It soon discovered that the entire cave had been filled with Soul Interdicting Water!</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?"</p>

  <p>Zheng and Libby had noticed Fidel's strange reaction immediately. They walked over to have a closer look and were both shocked at what they saw.</p>

  <p>"Whose bone cave is this?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"The Separate Abyss race!" exclaimed Fidel.</p>

  <p>"It seems that the Separate Abyss race have it much worse. Their cave is filled with the Soul Interdicting Water. I wonder if there's anyone trapped within it," Zheng mused, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>As Zheng climbed higher up the stages of the Other Shore, the number of Souls of Light he could meet lowered. There was only the Land of Bone Tribulation on the huge Sanskrit Light Stage where warriors could explore.</p>

  <p>A warrior like Libby, who had reached the Holy Soul Realm, would usually choose to pass through the Sanskrit Light Stage and go directly to Stage Thirty-two, the destination of the powerful Holy Souls.</p>

  <p>"Splash..."</p>

  <p>As they looked on, the Soul Interdicting Water had risen by a foot!</p>

  <p>When it eventually overflowed it would probably pour into the other bone caves around it.</p>

  <p>"Let's go! The bone cave is full of Soul Interdicting Water. Who knows what monsters might burst from it," Libby urged standing aside.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded in agreement and looked up at the other end of the bone cavity.</p>

  <p>"I wonder which bone cave leads to the Land of Bone Tribulation..."</p>

  <p>There were many bone caves of various sizes around the huge cavity, but in the center were three bone caves that extended up diagonally. It was Zheng's first time here but he understood enough to know that the exit of the Sanskrit Light Stage was among these three caves.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, Are you heading to the Land of Bone Tribulation?" Fidel asked excitedly.</p>

  <p>Since ancient times, no one in the chaos had been able to enter the Land of Bone Tribulation.</p>

  <p>Over the years, only a small number of Other Shore creatures had gone there, but no one in the chaos had the necessary qualifications to enter.</p>

  <p>"Yes." Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>"We'll be taking the cave in the middle to go to Stage Thirty-two. To get to the Land of Bone Tribulation, you should go through the cave on the left."</p>

  <p>Fidel said enviously, "If you succeed, you'll be the first to qualify to enter the Eternal Scroll Painting after ancient times!"</p>

  <p>This was important news to the Ear Mice and when Fidel could leave the Other Shore, it would surely bring it to the superiors immediately.</p>

  <p>Libby looked at Zheng in silence. She knew the left bone cave led to the Land of Bone Tribulation, but because she couldn't go there herself, she knew little of it and could not offer Zheng any advice.</p>

  <p>Zheng glanced at her and said, "Since you can't come with me and the Ear Mice are going to Stage Thirty-two, you should go with them."</p>

  <p>"I... I'll wait for you here," said Libby.</p>

  <p>"It's too dangerous here!" Fidel yelled in warning.</p>

  <p>"Normally, you staying here wouldn't be a problem. But Fidel is right, the Soul Interdicting Water has begun flooding and who knows what followed the water in," Zheng pointed out shaking his head as he spoke.</p>

  <p>The Ghost-claw Worms alone were tough to deal with, not to mention there could be more than one kind of creature in the Soul Interdicting Water.</p>

  <p>Libby considered this a while and decided Zheng made a lot of sense and so she agreed.</p>

  <p>Zheng then jumped up straight to the first bone cave on the left and climbed up along the wall.</p>

  <p>It was over ten thousand feet long and very wide. He could still hear the echo of his footsteps when he walked. When he was halfway up, a black fog appeared around the cave.</p>

  <p>This gave him pause and he hesitated.</p>

  <p>But then, the Primeval Lord of Heaven, who had been observing Zheng this whole time, reminded him, "Don't worry. This black fog is only to scare off souls and can't harm a physical body."</p>

  <p>Holy Souls were forbidden to step on this road, naturally there were some measures to stop them.</p>

  <p>These words of comfort swept Zheng's worries away and he continued climbing up.</p>

  <p>He was almost at the top when a ray of light shone in front of him, lighting the dim cave.</p>

  <p>"Does this bone cave lead outside?"</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes glinted and he quickened his pace.</p>

  <p>When he finally reached the top, he saw what it was like outside the bone cave...</p>

  <p>He saw a boundless blue sea and slender bones in the water upside down, sticking out like bamboo growing in the sea. This was the forbidden area outside the bone caves that Libby had mentioned!</p>
