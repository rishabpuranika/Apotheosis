<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"The Black Ship?"</p>

  <p>The Thunder Dimorphodon was dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>Back when it was lurking in the Icy Snow Province, it had spotted the ship.</p>

  <p>However, before the Chaotic Source World opened, Fuxi had driven the ship out of the Icy Snow Province.</p>

  <p>While the Thunder Dimorphodon had nothing to do with anyone from the Black Ship, it didn't expect the ship would come after it as soon as it lost Fuxi.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>It flapped its huge wings and sped up.</p>

  <p>Before long, however, it suddenly slowed down once more. To its surprise, another ship appeared from the other end of the space channel.</p>

  <p>The two ghost-like ships floated over quietly, blocking the Thunder Dimorphodon's way from both sides.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>On the ship behind the Thunder Dimorphodon, Shera gathered her dress and jumped off the rail of the ship, quickly flying towards the Thunder Dimorphodon. The brass man followed closely behind her.</p>

  <p>On the ship ahead, a person covered in bandages, resembling a bamboo pole, also flew towards the Thunder Dimorphodon. Next to the "bamboo pole" was a large Ear Mouse. A deep, red scar covered its right eye, which gleamed with a sharp light. It was as though it had been slashed at with a blade in its past.</p>

  <p>This Ear Mouse was called Tomos. It used to be a capable assistant of Ieuan, the king of Ear Mice. Later, it rebelled against the Ear Mice and joined the Black Ship. To this day, the Ear Mice were still chasing it.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>A flash of lightning circled the Thunder Dimorphodon. Angrily, the Thunder Dimorphodon roared, "Members of the Black Ship, what do you want from me?"</p>

  <p>Shera floated quietly in the air. Holding up a small, bony finger, she smiled charmingly. "Give us half of what you've got."</p>

  <p>Squeak! "Only half! We are not greedy!" echoed Tomos.</p>

  <p>Of course, the Thunder Dimorphodon was keenly aware of how important the rings were. In order for the creatures on the Other Shore to return to the chaos, the rings were integral. It was said that they might affect the entire situation of the chaos.</p>

  <p>"Half? Truly, you are greedy," said the Thunder Dimorphodon coldly, narrowing its eyes.</p>

  <p>"You don't have to hand them in," the brass man said with a shrug. "We will take everything anyway. And the rankings of the so-called top ten fierce beasts may change..."</p>

  <p>The top ten fierce beasts were universally acknowledged.</p>

  <p>However, if one of them died, another would take its place.</p>

  <p>Obviously, the brass man was threatening the Thunder Dimorphodon.</p>

  <p>"You? What makes you think you're strong enough to defeat me?" said the Thunder Dimorphodon in a low voice.</p>

  <p>Shera still wore a sweet smile. "The Human Sovereign took you lightly and you managed to escape, but we won't repeat the same mistake. We're well prepared to block you here. You don't have any chance to run away!"</p>

  <p>As soon as she finished speaking, Tomos had pulled out its Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>It was a pipe.</p>

  <p>Thin wisps of white smoke rose from the pipe, which suddenly solidified to form a strong net that prevented the Thunder Dimorphodon from tearing open the space channel to escape.</p>

  <p>The bandages on the body of the "bamboo pole" began to unravel, layer by layer. Without the bandages, his skin was bright and colorful. At a glance, anyone could tell it was poisonous.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the brass man didn't move a muscle. Instead, he watched from where he stood.</p>

  <p>If in a fight of pure strength, he wouldn't fear even Fuxi.</p>

  <p>"You have five minutes to consider it. We are very generous," Shera said with hands clasped behind her back.</p>

  <p>The lightning on the body of the Thunder Dimorphodon was cracking gently, and the trace of hesitation flashed through its only eye.</p>

  <p>The members of the Black Ship were definitely not weak. More importantly, every member's methods were strange and difficult to deal with. The Thunder Dimorphodon thought it could fight one head-on, but it was up against four. The chances of winning were slim.</p>

  <p>Phew!</p>

  <p>The Thunder Dimorphodon flapped its wings hard. Six rings rushed toward Shera with terrifying forces, like hidden weapons.</p>

  <p>Without flinching, Shera reached out and waved her delicate hand. The rings slowed down, and floated gently towards her.</p>

  <p>She inspected them carefully in her hand. After a while, she nodded at Tomos.</p>

  <p>Tomos understood immediately. It put away its Other Shore Token, deactivating the net.</p>

  <p>The Thunder Dimorphodon shot Shera a vicious glance. "Tell your captain that the glory days of the Black Ship are coming to an end."</p>

  <p>Then, without waiting for a response, it flapped its wings and flew away.</p>

  <p>Shera titled her head slightly and cracked a lovely smile. "Good days or bad days don't mean anything to the Black Ship," she said sweetly.</p>

  <p>The thirteen members of the Black Ship were all powerful creatures at the top of their game.</p>

  <p>No matter where they were in the Source World, they were able to live luxuriously. They could start up a great force with ease, and it was very likely that they could develop themselves into a super force if they worked hard.</p>

  <p>They chose to join the Black Ship not because they wanted to live a good life, but because they wanted to sail forward for their goals.</p>

  <p>The leaders outside the Chaotic Source World had been anxious since the conflict between Fuxi and the Thunder Dimorphodon had started.</p>

  <p>If strong masters, such as Athemar and Elizabeth, were involved in a fight like that, they would have been seriously injured, if not killed. If anyone younger got involved, they would have been killed for sure.</p>

  <p>To their relief, Fuxi was chasing the Thunder Dimorphodon away.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, everyone could hear the roar of thunder. However, now, the sounds had faded; the two had probably gone into a space channel.</p>

  <p>Whoever had reached the Chaotic Source Realm was sent out one by one.</p>

  <p>After the members of the smaller races came out, they quickly located their leaders and headed out in their flying ships.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the super forces had sent many members to the Chaotic Source World, so they were still waiting for their members to return.</p>

  <p>The leaders of the Separate Abyss race looked sullen.</p>

  <p>This time, they had been really unlucky. They had been attacked by the Evil God at the very beginning. And, at last, even Hamzah was killed in the world created by the Evil God.</p>

  <p>How could the leaders explain what had happened to their clansmen after they went back?</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>There was a fluctuation of space in the magic array at the door. Then, Zheng emerged.</p>

  <p>His appearance immediately attracted everyone's attention.</p>

  <p>His battle with the Evil God in the core area went beyond everyone's expectations.</p>

  <p>They hadn't reached the Chaotic Source Realm, and their Souls of Light were still in the Lust World. Yet, their battle was much fiercer than that between any ordinary Chaotic Source Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>What was even more terrifying was that the Evil God had actually come out of Zheng's inner world!</p>

  <p>Among the many leaders, the expression in Elizabeth's eyes was the most unreadable.</p>

  <p>She recalled the time when Zheng escaped her clutches. He had used the Withering Power and the Wind Cloud Escape. These two methods were the theurgies possessed by the chieftains of the Nine Li race. However, she did not think much about it at the time.</p>

  <p>Now she knew that Zheng had the Soaring Snake Sword, and the Evil God could copy three heads and six arms. She was certain that Zheng was from the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>He was also the spokesperson of a civilization, and he wielded the Soaring Snake Sword.</p>

  <p>Was Zheng also the one who could enter the Other Shore with his physical body?</p>

  <p>'How could the remaining members of the Nine Li race cultivate such a genius?' she wondered angrily.</p>

  <p>Back then, when Zheng was still young, Elizabeth hadn't been able to kill him.</p>

  <p>Now, she didn't even have a chance. Zheng's performance unsettled her to her very core.</p>
