  <p>
</p>

  <p>The members of the Demon Night race were without fail obedient to their queens.</p>

  <p>This race maintained this structure since its creation.</p>

  <p>The sacred places of the human race were evolved from sects, while the divine kingdoms were evolved from mortal nations. However, the loyalty of human martial artists couldn't be compared to that of the Demon Night warriors.</p>

  <p>When the sacred places and divine kingdoms experienced chaos, the core martial artists would choose to continue to serve their sacred places or divine kingdoms. At times though, a large group of them would try to escape.</p>

  <p>When the territory of the Humanity Alliance was slowly occupied by the Sacred race, many martial artists chose to leave the sacred places that they belonged to and run for their lives. Some criminals even burned, killed and looted random areas. Hence, the mortals were the ones left to suffer.</p>

  <p>This would never happen to the Demon Night race.</p>

  <p>The beliefs of their race were embedded in their very bones and ingrained in their brains.</p>

  <p>Once, when Xun and Yao were fighting back then, only the upper-level martial artists were in chaos. The lower-level martial artists didn't experience any disturbance because they only followed their own queens.</p>

  <p>Followings the orders of the queens, the members of the Demon Night race would go through fire and water without any complaints. This was why the Demon Night race remained so united.</p>

  <p>After finishing her sentence, Yao looked at Shania with an indifferent gaze. With an arrogant smile plastered on her face, she lifted her hemlines as she walked towards the transparent crystal doors of the Heavenly Punishment Palace.</p>

  <p>The warriors in front of the palace came from various sacred places.</p>

  <p>They were all elite warriors of the Demon Night race, ranging from world lords to Spirit Transformation Realm warriors, Spirit Supreme Realm warriors, Soul Sea Realm warriors... These were the strongest members of the Demon Night race.</p>

  <p>Seeing the graceful figure move behind the doors, the warriors of the Demon Night race immediately quieted down. They were ready for whatever the queen would ask of them.</p>

  <p>Although the vast majority of the Demon Night warriors were women, that didn't mean they weren't valiant. When faced with invasions, many world lords voluntarily joined the fight.</p>

  <p>Pah!</p>

  <p>The large, multi-colored doors slowly opened. Yao slowly but surely, stepped onto the terrace and took a look down at all the Demon Night members. Her facial expression was soft, but stern and poised.</p>

  <p>Shania followed closely behind, standing beside Yao with a calm gaze.</p>

  <p>"My dear people, it is an honor to meet you," Yao said. "We have gathered here today, with all the elite warriors, because something very drastic and important has happened."</p>

  <p>The expressions of the Demon Night members remained intent and focused. Though there were many warriors present, the place was completely silent. Yao's voice was easily heard by each and every one of them.</p>

  <p>Most thought Yao would declare war against the Sacred race.</p>

  <p>Whenever their universe suffered such a crisis, it was nearly impossible for everyone to stay out of this matter.</p>

  <p>"As you all know, the Sacred race has come to our universe," Yao said word by word.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, many of the Demon Night warriors furrowed their eyebrows. 'The Sacred race has come to our universe?</p>

  <p>They invaded our universe! Why is our queen saying something like that?'</p>

  <p>In situations like this, every word the queen uttered was of utmost importance. If the Queen of Punishment were to say anything too casually, it would be deemed inappropriate. Everyone knew she couldn't just make a mistake with wording.</p>

  <p>"This is an excellent opportunity for us. We will join hands with the Sacred race to help them take over this universe? the Evolutionary Universe." Yao's voice suddenly rose in volume, her face filled with excitement.</p>

  <p>As for the warriors of the Demon Night race, they were all stunned at her announcement.</p>

  <p>At least seventy percent of the Demon Night members felt that they had misheard her. 'The queen wanted to help the Sacred race?'</p>

  <p>In the past few days, the warriors of Sacred race used the Roaring Tokens to provoke the various races in the universe. Although the martial artists that Maha had slaughtered were all from the Humanity Alliance, everyone in the universe shared a common hatred for Maha. The Demon Night warriors all hated the Sacred race very much.</p>

  <p>Why did the Queen of Punishment suddenly announce that she was going to help that damned Sacred race?</p>

  <p>The silence broke as the Demon Night members whispered in hushed tones. It was absurd and too much for them to grasp.</p>

  <p>Gradually, the voices got louder and louder, turning into a buzzing frenzy. It sounded like a gentle storm across the ocean.</p>

  <p>"What does she mean?"</p>

  <p>"Our queen wants us to help those damned Sacred race?"</p>

  <p>"Why? Why!"</p>

  <p>Although they obeyed the queen's orders without question, the warriors still had thoughts that ate them up.</p>

  <p>They were born and raised in the universe; this was their homeland.</p>

  <p>There was no doubt that they loved this universe. Although the warriors of the Demon Night race were cold and aloof, they were upright and had a sense of justice nonetheless.</p>

  <p>Yao's announcement took them by surprise.</p>

  <p>"Master Janice, why is this happening?" Lynne asked in disbelief.</p>

  <p>Her face was angry and doubtful, with a hint of confusion. "How is that possible?" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>People asked questions too. "My queen, the Sacred race is our enemy, so why should we help them?" said one of them.</p>

  <p>"My queen! If we were to help the Sacred race, we would be acting against the will of the heavens!" another expressed.</p>

  <p>"My queen, you're joking, right?"</p>

  <p>World lords and members of the Board of Elders couldn't help but jump out to protest.</p>

  <p>The universe was watched over by the same heavens, and the creatures and races within were born under the same heavens. If they were to help a race outside the universe, then that was indeed going against everything they believed in.</p>

  <p>To them, Yao's decision didn't make sense at all. They couldn't understand why their queen wanted to take such unimaginable actions.</p>

  <p>Facing the chattering crowd, Shania laughed coldly on the side. "It seems like your first step will be very difficult to attain."</p>

  <p>Yao's expression didn't change. Her flawless, stern face held up despite the commotion.</p>

  <p>"My queen! Even if you had a grudge with Xun back then, we never blamed you for that. We also forgave you for sealing the Pool of Faith of Xun. But do you realize what you're doing now?"</p>

  <p>"You are bringing the entire Demon Night race to the death sentence!"</p>

  <p>"This will put us in an irreparable situation," the few elders roared at Yao.</p>

  <p>Even if they loved and trusted in Yao, her order remained against their will. Every inch of their bodies failed to accept what she wanted.</p>

  <p>Yao, however, remained calm. If this was in the past, she would have already started killing people. But in front of the elite forces of the Demon Night race, she knew she couldn't be too brutal. She had to maintain her elegance and poise, no matter what.</p>

  <p>"My queen! Do you think so too?" one of the elders asked Shania.</p>

  <p>Shania looked quite innocent, but in the end, she still nodded her head. If she had a choice, she wouldn't have agreed with Yao's decision. She had always been immersed in her own research, and this brought her endless joy. The Sacred race's sudden appearance disturbed all her plans.</p>

  <p>She was restricted by the Soul-sealing Needle and could only do as the needle instructed.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Shania agreed so easily, the elders couldn't believe their ears, their faces revealing shock and confusion.</p>

  <p>The character of the Queen of Punishment had always been crazy and difficult to comprehend. However, the Queen of Life was relatively gentle, so why did even she approve of this matter this time around? No one could figure out what was happening.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>The discussion grew louder and louder.</p>

  <p>Pah!</p>

  <p>Yao reached out her hand, and the Saint Thunder Meteor Hammer appeared before her. A blue-colored flash of lightning shot out from the hammer, violently exploding high in the sky.</p>

  <p>There was a clap of thunder in the air.</p>

  <p>A deafening sound erupted, masking all the discussion and arguments happening below.</p>

  <p>"I know that everyone is angry," Yao said slowly. "As creatures born in the Evolutionary Universe, we, the Demon Night warriors, have the duty to protect our homeland. However, I want to set it clear to everyone that the Demon Night race does not belong to this universe!"</p>

  <p>"What?</p>

  <p>How is this possible?"</p>

  <p>"We were born in this universe. Why don't we belong to this universe?"</p>

  <p>All of the Demon Night members gasped as they stared wide-eyed at Yao. Their minds were completely muddled.</p>

  <p>Yao did not have a better way to appease them. She could only divulge some information to calm them down. "The purpose that our Demon Night race was created was to destroy the Evolutionary Universe, and now the opportunity has come."</p>
