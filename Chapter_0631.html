<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 631 Bidding (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Hearing Felix's remark, Lasseter and Luo Zheng got so upset. Even though Lasseter and Felix were quite fond of each other, business was strictly business, and an acquaintance was just an acquaintance. They were two quite different kettles of fish altogether!</p>

  <p>The reason why Luo Zheng came here was to make some money from selling his work of meditation divine texture, but Felix, for whatever reason he might have, was trying to get in his way from doing that.</p>

  <p>"What I'm trying to say is that if you're planning to sell it, then it would be best for you to only sell it to me!" Felix interjected.</p>

  <p>Shrugging his shoulders, Luo Zheng made it obvious that it didn't really matter who would buy it, for as long that he could make some money out of it.</p>

  <p>But Lasseter and Felix couldn't see eye to eye. Lasseter blurted out,</p>

  <p>"Felix, what are you trying to do? Luo Zheng came to my store of his own volition to do business with me, but you just randomly broke into my store and what? You went ahead and tried to steal my customer!"</p>

  <p>"So, what? Why should it matter? When you get right down to it, this place is under the ownership of the Cloud Hall. So, why shouldn't I be allowed to come here and do my business as well?" Being the runic expert of Cloud Hall, despite the fact that Felix was merely at the medium stage of the Internal Elixir Realm, he had the privilege of having a high position in the Cloud Hall. His position was actually just a tad bit lower than that of Emanuel, Saint Morphens, and Elder Osmond. He wasn't inferior to any of the other general elders.</p>

  <p>Be that as it might, Lasseter wasn't fazed in any way, and still didn't have the slightest intention to give in. "This place belongs to the Cloud Hall?</p>

  <p>Are you trying to pull my leg right now? This market was built by the World Commercial Alliance. In fact, it's still sponsored by them. Do you have the nerve to say that straight to the face of the head of the World Commercial Alliance that this market is owned by the Cloud Hall? If you dare say something like that, then I will cease going on with this meaningless banter and leave the premises at once!"</p>

  <p>Watching in the sidelines as these two were having a discussion just made Luo Zheng even more restless. 'For what logical reason could I be wasting time standing here in silence not having sold my meditation divine texture yet?' he was lost in thought. Luo Zheng interrupted them and said, "Stop arguing. I'm the owner of this rune, so it's only right that I get to decide whom I want to sell it to. Let's make this simple, the one who has the better offer gets to have it, understood?"</p>

  <p>The men had been left at such a loss for words upon hearing the proposal. Only then were they able to come to the realization that the best way to address the issue lay in Luo Zheng himself.</p>

  <p>"Did I hear that right? Bidding? I think that's a great idea!" Lasseter was a little surprised at first, but after just a moment, he was already grinning like a Cheshire cat. As a part of the World Commercial Alliance, he had an edge whenever it came to things like auctions and bidding as opposed to Felix, and most of all, he had a lot of money to burn.</p>

  <p>Felix clenched his jaw and pried, "For how much would you be willing to let it go? Just give me any amount and I will give you the money right away. It doesn't matter how much."</p>

  <p>A broad smile crept onto Zheng's face as he listened to them. 'Well, isn't this just great? This is precisely what I have been looking for, ' he thought, trying to hide his excitement. After pondering about it for a while, Luo Zheng said, "Considering how much money I have forked out for the materials the day before, the meditation rune cost me just about ten thousand low-grade life vitality crystals. So, now, I'm thinking of doubling that, making it twenty, so it should be about twenty thousand."</p>

  <p>"Are you serious?" The starting bid Luo Zheng had recommended utterly baffled them.</p>

  <p>A meager twenty thousand life vitality crystals... Was that really all that he wanted? Was this guy serious?</p>

  <p>Had it only been a common rune, it would still go for a price significantly higher than that. Was this guy out of his mind?</p>

  <p>"Five hundred thousand low-grade life vitality crystals." For the reason that they would have to make him an offer he couldn't refuse for the rune, Lasseter decided to go at it rationally and started bidding immediately, a hint of excitement filled his eyes. In terms of runic knowledge, he indeed couldn't hope to measure up to Felix, but if it was all about business, Felix wouldn't be able to hold a candle against him.</p>

  <p>Since Felix detested Lasseter so much for arguing with him, he shot him an intense glare and yelled, "One million low-grade life vitality crystals!</p>

  <p>I'm more than willing to trade for it with a supreme life vitality crystal."</p>

  <p>A single supreme life vitality crystal was worth one million low-grade life vitality crystals. Felix jumped the gun and offered a price twice as much as that of Lasseter's.</p>

  <p>"Two supreme life vitality crystals." Lasseter doubled the amount without batting an eye. There was just no way he'd lose to someone like Felix.</p>

  <p>"How about four supreme life vitality crystals?" Without letting Luo Zheng get a chance to think about Lasseter's offer, Felix shouted out and just continued bidding a higher amount.</p>

  <p>Listening as the price kept rising up, Luo Zheng could literally feel the blood surging to his brain that he was beginning to get a little lightheaded. Just imagine, a single supreme life vitality crystal would be equal to one million cubic crystals! Meaning four supreme life vitality crystals would be worth as much as four million cubic crystals! Never would he have thought that making the divine texture could be of great help for him to earn a huge sum of money! But how was it that a simple meditation divine texture piece could be valued at such an absurd amount?</p>

  <p>Truth be told, this meditation divine texture wouldn't really be worth that much anywhere else. In reality, the meditation divine texture was not that powerful. However, what piqued Lasseter's and Felix's interest the most was not its function, but the technique of the Perfect Brushwork which could be utilized through it.</p>

  <p>And solely for that purpose, namely, the Perfect Brushwork, this divine texture could be much sought-after and worth a lot of money.</p>

  <p>"F...Five..." At that point, Lasseter started to get reluctant. Because he was a businessman first and foremost, he was well aware of his limitations. It was true that the Perfect Brushwork was employed in this meditation divine texture work, but the true worth of this work would only be put on display through the way of trading. Offering too high an amount, he could end up losing a lot of money in the process.</p>

  <p>And yet Felix's eyes still brightened up even after hearing that. Letting a conceited smile slip, he yelled again, "Ten! I offer you ten supreme life vitality crystals!"</p>

  <p>It was evident that, at that very moment, he had, without a doubt, absolutely forgotten his goal to stop Luo Zheng.</p>
