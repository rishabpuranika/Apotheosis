<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 725 The Proposal </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Eden nonchalantly pushed the fragments of Arctic Mysterious Ice away, before he lifted the glimmering item, holding it up to admire. Smiling slightly, he said, "I want to give this to the head of Cloud Hall as a gift!"</p>

  <p>He proudly gazed down at the sparkling small golden crown he held. There were three breathtaking crystals embedded into the delicate circlet. They were brilliant white crystals that, instead of radiating and bouncing off the many facets, they captured the light and reflected a softened, faint silvery shimmer. On the crown's side, three feathers were secured.</p>

  <p>If this small golden crown were made of ordinary gold and gems, it wouldn't be worth anything in the eyes of a martial artist. After all, it didn't take many life vitality crystals to buy a great deal of gold or gemstones.</p>

  <p>Even a minuscule piece of Arctic Mysterious Ice was worth more than ten times an ornate crown made of traditional gold and gems.</p>

  <p>However, Eden had sealed the golden crown in the Arctic Mysterious Ice, so, its value could only match or exceed the ice.</p>

  <p>Most of the warriors didn't recognize it and were confused.</p>

  <p>However, with so many people present, there was bound to be someone with the knowledge and experience to recognize it. Suddenly, someone shouted, "Wow! That's the Heavenly Feather Crown of the Northern Serenity Palace!"</p>

  <p>"The Northern Serenity Palace? The one that once was situated in the Arctic Lands? The one that has been destroyed long time ago?"</p>

  <p>"Hey! That's right! I remember it now. I saw a picture of the Heavenly Feather Crown. You know, it's a sacred weapon!"</p>

  <p>"Before she fell, the Holy Maiden of the Northern Serenity Palace was armed to the hilt with sacred weapons. When she went to war against the four divine kingdoms, her forces were crushed and left wounded. Her sacred weapons were divided among four divine kingdoms. In the chaos, the Heavenly Feather Crown disappeared. People from the four Kingdoms searched all of the Northern Serenity Palace, yet no one found it. Wow! It's amazing that Eden found it! This is astounding!"</p>

  <p>Mysterious, spiritual, fairy, and sacred weapons...</p>

  <p>Fairy weapons could be found throughout the Central Region, easily. Every sect head had a high-grade fairy weapon, but sacred weapons were rare.</p>

  <p>Currently, only three sacred weapons were known to be in the Central Region. One was the Soul Flag, which was held by the Ethereal Spirit Sect, the World Commercial Alliance had the Time Copper Coin, and Eddie possessed the Nameless Saber.</p>

  <p>These sacred weapons were confirmed. It was unknown if any others were in the region, where they were, or who had them.</p>

  <p>A sacred weapon was so powerful and special that it often affected the rise and fall of a sect.</p>

  <p>Martial artists believed the birth of a sacred weapon heralded a period of great luck because it contained a blessing. Even if it weren't used, and instead housed in a place of honor at the sect, it would bring the sect good luck!</p>

  <p>For example, the Soul Flag was at the Ethereal Spirit sect, and since they got it, they'd also seen a rise in talented disciples at the sect. In addition, out of the blue, talented applicants showed up. It was the same thing over at the World Commercial Alliance. Although they kept the number of forces hidden from outsiders, everyone saw the changes, and how the alliance had grown since they got the weapon.</p>

  <p>For Eddie, it was the Nameless Saber that brought the luck! Before obtaining the saber, Evil East Lord Eddie was merely an independent warrior, but, with his sacred weapon, Eddie rose up and soon became known as the most powerful person in the Central Region.</p>

  <p>Many sects dreamed of having a sacred weapon. The weapon's strength was secondary to the luck that came with it!</p>

  <p>"A sacred weapon... Oh my God, he's wealthy and incredibly lucky! Why couldn't I be the son of the Evil East Lord?"</p>

  <p>"A spendthrift, he's truly a spendthrift. Why does he want to give the sacred weapon away?"</p>

  <p>"But, I don't understand. Why is Eden gifting the sacred weapon to the Cloud Hall's leader? Oh, wait, I know, he has his eyes on Ning Yudie. Am I right?"</p>

  <p>The warriors in the stands also started a heated discussion.</p>

  <p>Tianming, Patrick and the others frowned while watching the events unfold on the stage.</p>

  <p>Although Tianming bore no ill will to Eden, the animosity Luo Luo Zheng felt toward his father, made up for it! Tianming knew about Luo Zheng's determination. He was convinced that once Luo Luo Zheng thought he himself was strong enough, he would definitely fight Eddie. When the battle would happen was unknown.</p>

  <p>Although Tianming and Patrick weren't able to help much, they were on Luo Zheng's side. Since Eddie was evil, it was a given that his son would be too. His intentions behind gifting the sacred weapon to Ning Yudie were confusing.</p>

  <p>The Bloodwood Cliff's leader, Lady Poison-blood, as well as Elderly Luna of the Mysterious Luna Hall, and Raven of the Black Mountain Sect were all extremely envious. The most envious of them was Lady Poison-blood.</p>

  <p>She and Ning Yudie were both women, and she believed her herself to be as beautiful as Ning Yudie. Then why would Eden want to give Ning Yudie the crown?</p>

  <p>When Marilyn, behind Eddie, looked at that Heavenly Feather Crown, her face was filled with dissatisfaction. It was a good sacred weapon, but Eddie didn't give it to her, but gave it to someone else instead. She had even gotten into an awkward situation with Eddie over this.</p>

  <p>Eden smiled, "The Ethereal Spirit Sect is a fifth-grade sect. They have their own sacred weapon, and the World Commercial Alliance is nearly more powerful than a fifth-grade sect. The Cloud Hall is the third largest sect in the Central Region, a fourth-grade sect. It would make no sense if it didn't have its own sacred weapon."</p>

  <p>Staring at the Heavenly Feather Crown, Ning Yudie revealed a smile. "A sacred weapon is very important to the sect. Our Cloud Hall would also like to have one like that, but whether or not our Cloud Hall has a sacred weapon, I don't see how it concerns you. You're not from our Cloud Hall, why do you want to give me the crown? The gift is too much. I can't take it."</p>

  <p>Hearing Yudie's words, Eden smiled, turned and clasped his hands towards the sects, then said to Ning Yudie, "As martial artists, we do not care about the formalities of mortals. I want to use this opportunity of the Martial Arts Contest to propose to you!"</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie was stunned and blinked her eyes. "What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>Eden's face exuded a strong sense of confidence, passing down his father's domineering Mu Ning. "I want you to be my woman!"</p>

  <p>The warriors in the stands clamored.</p>

  <p>The atmosphere at the scene exploded once again.</p>

  <p>Compared to a mortal, a martial artist could live longer, even for hundreds of years. A martial artist's marriage wasn't all that complicated, and they didn't need a matchmaker. It was often straightforward.</p>

  <p>However, Eden's way was even more direct and bolder. He actually proposed to the head of the Cloud Hall personally in the Martial Arts Contest.</p>

  <p>Even though his father was the strongest in the Central Region, the gap between Eden and Ning Yudie was not small!</p>

  <p>He was just a mid-stage Internal Elixir Realm warrior. He could be considered an expert in the Central Region, but he was not a peerless expert.</p>

  <p>However, Ning Yudie was a Virtual Tribulation Realm martial artist. Even though she was cultivating the Sutra of Empyrean Goddess and needed to renew her cultivation nine times, and she had just entered the early stage of Virtual Tribulation Realm, she would soon be able to recover to the late stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm. She would be a top expert in the Central Region by then. She might be weaker than Eddie, but she was definitely not someone that Eden could challenge.</p>

  <p>A martial artist proposal didn't care about status or money. It didn't require a matchmaker, but it cared about strength!</p>

  <p>It was venturesome for a warrior in Internal Elixir Realm to go up to Ning Yudie to propose to her, even though he had a sacred weapon.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Ning Yudie was the goddess in the hearts of many warriors.</p>

  <p>Eden's words "become my woman" instantly angered the several hundred thousand warriors in the stands.</p>

  <p>"Just because your father is Evil East Lord doesn't mean all the women in the world belong to you. You are too shameless!"</p>

  <p>"He is daydreaming. Ning Yudie won't say yes just because of a sacred weapon!"</p>

  <p>"His plan is not bad. He gets Ning Yudie and also Cloud Hall at the cost of a sacred weapon. This is a good deal!"</p>

  <p>Although the strength of these martial artists was very weak, they had their own judgments. Eden was too shameless. For a time, all sorts of nasty words came out from the stands.</p>

  <p>Some of the words were indeed very unpleasant to listen to. Eden turned his head and coldly said, "What nonsense are you guys spouting? Do you want to die?"</p>

  <p>"We were talking about you. So what? You are shameless!"</p>

  <p>"Is there anyone else in the world who knows how to do business better than you? Do you think others are idiots?"</p>

  <p>"Your father's dominance is justified, because your father has the strength to do so. Without your father, who the hell would know you!"</p>

  <p>Although Evil East Lord was there, all the warriors were certain that Eden did not dare to fight here. After all, this was the Martial Arts Contest. They didn't think Eden and Eddie dared to kill hundreds of thousands of warriors.</p>

  <p>The World Commercial Alliance would not sit there and do nothing.</p>

  <p>Everyone was talking at once, and they were not afraid of Eden's threats at all.</p>

  <p>Yudie's face broke into a gentle smile, and she looked towards Eddie. She then stared at Eden, her expression cold. "Did your father tell you to do this? Isn't it enough for you to take Yan away? What do you take our Cloud Hall for? And... Are you worthy of me?"</p>

  <p>Previously, Eddie had asked for Yan. The Cloud Hall was unwilling to offend him, so even though they were reluctant, they still sent Yan over.</p>

  <p>Because of this matter, there was a quarrel between Ning Yudie and Luo Luo Zheng. She regretted it a lot. She never thought that Eddie's son would actually come and propose to her. This was the biggest joke in the world.</p>
