  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's information ignited a spark of hope within Lorena and Rosie.</p>

  <p>They knew it was difficult for the powerful masters to enter divine land, but it was only a matter of time before they succeeded in doing so.</p>

  <p>The powerhouses at the Other Shore Realm would have broken the space barrier within ten years. By then, they would be able to sweep away everything.</p>

  <p>The void was not meant for prolonged stays.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng gave a rough introduction of what happened outside the divine land.</p>

  <p>Afterwards, Rosie instructed Samuel's clone to crack through the void.</p>

  <p>The Cold Fiends in the lair at the foot of the snow mountain had been reborn.</p>

  <p>Rosie very well knew what lay at the bottom of the snow mountain. After breaking through the void, Samuel's clone built a space channel and sent them directly to the top of the snow mountain.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong with the snow mountain?" Sword Chen observed something unusual while watching the snow mountain.</p>

  <p>Rosie similarly felt strange. "Looks like an avalanche has struck. I don't think I've ever seen anything like this before."</p>

  <p>The snow blanket on the mountain was gone, revealing the bare hilltop covered only with a thin layer of snow.</p>

  <p>Tianming said, "The fight in the void must have been too fierce. Maybe that caused the snow to slide."</p>

  <p>"But that's impossible!" Rosie exclaimed, shaking her head.</p>

  <p>"The void at the bottom of the ice volcano is completely separated from the outside world. No amount of noise we made in the void can cause an avalanche."</p>

  <p>"Maybe Samuel did this to vent his anger," guessed Sword Chen.</p>

  <p>"That's a possibility," Rosie agreed with a nod.</p>

  <p>After staying for a short while, Rosie flew the group up. They soon left the coffin and returned to the bottom of the massive ice palace.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and Tianming left the coffin together; at the same time, the girl lying in the coffin disintegrated into specks of golden powder and vanished right before everyone's eyes.</p>

  <p>The True Demon Body was taken away by Luo Zheng and Tianming.</p>

  <p>Looking at the disappearing girl, Rosie felt a twinge of disappointment. "I have fought so hard for the True Demon Body, but you two ended up getting it."</p>

  <p>Despite being a monster in the forbidden area, Rosie possessed her own memories and emotions.</p>

  <p>Through the years, she had been coming and going into the coffin multitudes of times, even dying in it many times. Then, she revived again in the black water.</p>

  <p>Considering her own inadequate strength, she supported the fiends and helped Sword Chen. She left no stone unturned in her quest to acquire the True Demon Body but ultimately failed, so her disappointment was definitely warranted.</p>

  <p>Lorena looked at her sister with eyebrows raised. "If you don't have the True Demon Body, does that mean you can't leave the Abyss Demon Region?"</p>

  <p>Rosie nodded but then shook her head. "Technically, I don't really need the True Demon Body to leave the Abyss Demon Region; I only have to control the forbidden land."</p>

  <p>Upon uttering these words, she suddenly realized something.</p>

  <p>The same realization simultaneously occurred to Sword Chen, who asked,</p>

  <p>"So, who is controlling the Abyss Demon Region now?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and Tianming also looked a bit bemused.</p>

  <p>If the True Demon Body was a level-six supreme treasure of belief in the Abyss Demon Region, then they should by now have had the control of the region. However, the two girls showed no response.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was a witness to how Augustus had absolute control over the Swirl Forest and everything in it. In fact, Augustus could be considered the ruler of the Swirl Forest.</p>

  <p>Lorena, who had been lost in thought for a while, wondered aloud, "Is it because the True Demon Body is divided into two parts? If so, you can merge the two girls into one and let one of you control the Abyss Demon Region."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and Tianming looked at each other and nodded.</p>

  <p>They had no reason to take control of the True Demon Body. They could even send the two girls to Rosie if she so desired.</p>

  <p>They summoned the girls and tried to separate them from their bodies.</p>

  <p>They attempted this for a long while but failed every single time.</p>

  <p>The two girls were also confused, as they did not know what Luo Zheng and Tianming were doing.</p>

  <p>In particular, the girl with red eyes only snuggled into Luo Zheng's arms. She seemed to understand what Luo Zheng was saying, but when Luo Zheng asked her something, she would shake her head fervently and refuse to cooperate.</p>

  <p>After all of the drama, Luo Zheng and Tianming had no choice but to give up.</p>

  <p>Although Rosie was disappointed, she still said in a voice full of hope,</p>

  <p>"Although you can't do it now, that doesn't mean that you won't succeed in the future. If anyone of you manages to control the Abyss Demon Region someday, come back and get me out!"</p>

  <p>She had been trapped here for many years. It had been so long, and she dreamed of returning.</p>

  <p>"That's all we can do. Once we return, we'll figure out a way to get you out as soon as possible," Luo Zheng said with a nod.</p>

  <p>Rosie then led Luo Zheng and the others out of the ice palace.</p>

  <p>Before leaving, she took one last look at the coffin and found something odd. The coffin seemed to have moved a bit, but she did not know how and when the coffin's position changed. Even so, she did not dwell on it.</p>

  <p>Outside the ice palace, the fiends remained guarding the seventh stage of the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>At that point, the fiends did not cut the same figure of terror that they once did. After being killed once, they needed some time to accumulate the Faith Energy, so they were presently too weak to fight.</p>

  <p>However, even if they were as strong as they used to be, none of them would dare to wage a war under Rosie's leadership.</p>

  <p>Under their watchful gazes, Luo Zheng and the others went back from the seventh stage to the sixth.</p>

  <p>The Abyss Demon Region was vast. Even if they proceeded on their way without a hitch, it would still take them considerable time to return to the entrance.</p>

  <p>After three days, Rosie finally escorted Luo Zheng and the others to the entrance.</p>

  <p>On their way back, she and Lorena reminisced about the past. At the moment of parting, they were somewhat reluctant to go their separate ways.</p>

  <p>"Don't be afraid, Rosie. Trust me, you will leave here soon," Lorena consoled the other.</p>

  <p>Rosie nodded her head, trying to hold on to Lorena's unshakable faith in her eventual escape.</p>

  <p>Over the years, she had been resenting the Yellow Emperor Guards and exhausting every means to rebuild the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>With Lorena alive, Rosie knew that the other would play a pivotal role in the Nine Li race, so her resentment had gradually dissipated.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, you must figure out a way after you go back," Rosie addressed Luo Zheng with a smile. "I will await your news in the black water."</p>

  <p>"Trust me, I won't let you down," Luo Zheng replied, waving his hand towards Rosie.</p>

  <p>With a dark, sinister aura emanating from it, the gate of the Abyss Demon Region appeared like the rabid, gaping mouth of a particularly terrifying monster. dozens of transmission arrays were established outside the gate, which directly led to the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>In order to monopolize the forbidden lands, powerful shackles were laid out at the entryways. All people could only enter the forbidden lands through the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>"If we return, we have to enter a Floating Island from one of the transmission arrays," Tianming said. "However, there is another way: by breaking the restriction of the Abyss Demon Region." He continued, "With our current strength, that will not be too difficult for us to do, but it will take some time."</p>

  <p>"Let's return through a Floating Island," Luo Zheng said faintly.</p>

  <p>With so many Holy Beings dead, they feared no one with their strength.</p>

  <p>Only the Yellow Emperor Guards could threaten them, but by reading Nicholas' memory, Luo Zheng knew that Hamish had already left the Floating Island.</p>

  <p>Just as they had made their decision, an invisible wave suddenly struck, and a loud cracking sound was heard. "Crack!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the ground at the gate of the Abyss Demon Region splintered.</p>

  <p>The earth in the fractured ground morphed into a massive head that was about a hundred thousand feet high, dust and smoke suffocatingly filling the air around the gruesome sight. The monstrous head opened its bloody mouth and tried to swallow the group.</p>

  <p>Rosie was stunned at the sight of the huge face. She looked over to her sister and companions and shouted, "Lorena! Everyone! You must leave quickly! I'll do what I can to block it!"</p>
