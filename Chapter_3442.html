  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng returned to the cave in a daze.</p>

  <p>He was still adjusting after returning from the Abstruse Energy State.</p>

  <p>"How do you feel?" the handsome man asked with a smile.</p>

  <p>The enchanting woman was not surprised at Zheng's reaction. She had expected it.</p>

  <p>The first time they ventured into the outside of the chaos, they had the same reaction.</p>

  <p>It was a long time before Zheng could respond.</p>

  <p>He looked at the void outside the chaos, his face inscrutable. "So, those light dots are actually the other things in the space?"</p>

  <p>The man nodded. "My master once said that all things scattered there.</p>

  <p>Maybe one of the light spots is a part of my master's body."</p>

  <p>The light dots were spread outside the chaos, indistinct from each other.</p>

  <p>Zheng only needed to experience it once to understand that it would be futile to judge the size and distance of the void.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, let me see!"</p>

  <p>"I want to try it, too!"</p>

  <p>No. 9527 and the Regal Jade Spirit pleaded.</p>

  <p>When Zheng had poked his head out, the two had been hiding in his body.</p>

  <p>They weren't able to follow him out.</p>

  <p>So now they were also very curious about the void outside the chaos.</p>

  <p>Zheng thought for a moment. He answered with his consciousness, "Hide yourselves in my right arm."</p>

  <p>After the consciousness of the Regal Jade Spirit and No. 9527 burrowed into Zheng's arm, he extended his right hand outside the cave.</p>

  <p>Just like before, his right hand turned into light dots and quickly spread out.</p>

  <p>This time, the consciousnesses of No. 9527 and the Regal Jade Spirit spread along with them.</p>

  <p>While letting the two observe the Abstruse Energy State, Zheng turned to the man. "Since your master is out there, how can you pass the news to him and ask him to return?"</p>

  <p>The woman pointed to the edge of the cave where long and thin ropes were nailed. Complicated runes were painted on the surface of each rope.</p>

  <p>There were a total of thirteen ropes. Most parts of the ropes extended outside the chaos, leaving only finger-long sections in the cave. Zheng hadn't noticed them before.</p>

  <p>"My master and his other disciples have tied themselves to the ropes. We can reach them using these," the woman said.</p>

  <p>'There are thirteen ropes, so thirteen people are out. By using the ropes, they don't get lost in the void. King Manard is really smart, ' Zheng thought to himself.</p>

  <p>The woman raised her hand gently. Three energy beams, red, yellow and blue, spiraled up from her palm.</p>

  <p>Zheng had seen two of the energy beams before. One was the blue light from the big-eyed little monsters. The other was the red bubble from the double-headed flying snakes. It was his first time to see the yellow energy.</p>

  <p>Zheng was told that King Manard kept three races in the space. He presumed it was the third race that used the yellow energy.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The three energy beams merged into a ball. The woman thrust it onto the runes of one of the ropes. The runes then lit up one after another, spreading all the way to the void outside the chaos. They turned into light spots and flew quickly away.</p>

  <p>It seemed that this mysterious void wasn't so unfathomable after all. King Manard had found ways to work with it.</p>

  <p>Zheng withdrew his hand from outside of the cave, bringing No. 9527 and the Regal Jade Spirit back inside.</p>

  <p>"…" No. 9527 was rendered speechless.</p>

  <p>"…" The Regal Jade Spirit was left dumbfounded, too.</p>

  <p>One used to be a Son of Truth, while the other was a splinter of the soul of the Chaos Ancient God.</p>

  <p>Suffice to say, both of them had been through a lot. They knew many secrets unknown to most.</p>

  <p>However, the Abstruse Energy State still left them shocked and shaken to the core.</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade Spirit, in particular, had never imagined that this space, which was previously under his control, could lead outside of the chaos and to something so incredible.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't need to ask them for their reaction. "How long will we have to wait after we send word to your master?" he asked the man.</p>

  <p>The man thought for a moment. "It's hard to say. Sometimes he takes his time to return, having been in space for too long. Sometimes he comes back quickly. It depends on his mood."</p>

  <p>The woman nodded. "Once, a golden-faced ghost was exiled here. It owned a very unique Other Shore Token, so both of us could not defeat it. In the end, we could only flee into this cave and ask our master to come back. At that time, our master returned in only a few seconds to subdue the golden-faced ghost."</p>

  <p>"It all depends on how willing he is to return. If he takes you seriously, he returns instantly." As the man said this, stars appeared in the distance outside, approaching the entrance of the cave.</p>

  <p>The woman pouted. "It seems you have our master's attention."</p>

  <p>King Manard usually only appeared when his disciples were in great danger.</p>

  <p>But not long after she relayed Zheng's news, here was King Manard, already coming back. She felt a little jealous.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>More and more light dots gathered at the entrance of the cave. The dots started to converge into a vague human form. As soon as it entered the cave, it materialized into a man with a curly beard. He looked exactly the same as the statue that Zheng saw on the small star.</p>

  <p>"Master!"</p>

  <p>"Master!"</p>

  <p>The woman and the man respectfully bowed to King Manard.</p>

  <p>King Manard nodded and let his eyes settle upon Zheng. He scrutinized Zheng from head to toe, raising a brow.</p>

  <p>"Nice to meet you, sir!" Zheng said, likewise bowing to King Manard.</p>

  <p>King Manard didn't greet him in return. Instead, his eyes fell on Zheng's right hand. "There are two souls of other races in your body. Show yourselves! If you're here to spy on me, don't blame me for wiping out your consciousness!"</p>

  <p>The woman and the man grew nervous at their master's words.</p>

  <p>They knew King Manard only acknowledged the human race, rejecting other races with extreme prejudice.</p>

  <p>Some of the creatures from other races that had been exiled to this space had been innocent. Many of them had fallen to their knees and begged to be spared.</p>

  <p>But King Manard showed no mercy to the alien creatures in this space. He left none of them alive. He had ordered his disciples to be as ruthless.</p>

  <p>And so it came to pass that the woman and the man killed countless creatures of different races, developing an instinctive repulsion for them.</p>

  <p>After all these years, Zheng was the only one they had kept alive.</p>
