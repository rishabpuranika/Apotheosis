<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Ever since Luo Zheng disappeared, his wives were helplessly quite worried about him.</p>

  <p>Seeing him return unharmed, they felt describable relief and could finally put their minds at rest.</p>

  <p>"I finally reached the divine land, but you didn't wait for me in the Immortal Mansion. I was devastated," Xi Youqin blamed in a hurt tone, burying herself in Luo Zheng's arms.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled. "But I'm back now, right?" he coaxed.</p>

  <p>"Yes." Xi Youqin nodded obediently. She suddenly raised her head and looked warily at Yudie and Xun who were standing not too far away. "Listen, they came to the divine land earlier than me so they were able to spend more time with you in the past. As compensation, you'll have to accompany me for the next few days."</p>

  <p>A bitter smile spread on Luo Zheng's face. Xi Youqin was probably the only one who could pull off saying such capricious words.</p>

  <p>Although Xi Youqin was speaking in a low voice, Yudie and Xun could still hear her pretty clearly.</p>

  <p>Yudie frowned and was about to talk back in retaliation. Xun, who was beside her, held her arm and shook her head in negation.</p>

  <p>What Xun hoped for was very simple. As long as Luo Zheng could safely return back to her, then everything would be fine. She didn't need to be jealous of Xi Youqin over such a small, meaningless matter.</p>

  <p>Harold and the others patiently waited for Luo Zheng to come to them, even though they had several important subjects to discuss with him.</p>

  <p>The first five minutes ticked by.</p>

  <p>Five minutes turned into ten.</p>

  <p>Before long, an hour had passed.</p>

  <p>An awkward atmosphere unwittingly broke out in the Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>Yudie had been stopped by Xun, and thus, she could only resentfully criticize Xi Youqin in her heart for not being reasonable instead.</p>

  <p>Augustus simply couldn't wait anymore.</p>

  <p>In a flash, he had already arrived at Luo Zheng's side. "Hey, Xi Youqin, this isn't the time for you to be all gooey over Luo Zheng! We've got business to take care of."</p>

  <p>"That doesn't concern you!"</p>

  <p>A moment ago, Xi Youqin had resembled a docile lamb, but now her voice was cold as she glared at Augustus with resentful eyes, as if she wanted to kill him.</p>

  <p>"You're not the only one who Luo Zheng has. He also has me, Hallet, Joy, his sister, as well as his son. You can't take up all of his time," Augustus said in a matter-of-fact tone.</p>

  <p>Xi Youqin raised her nose and said proudly, "I'm his wife! My time spent with him is perfectly justified!"</p>

  <p>"But you are not his only wife," Augustus retorted, tightening his lips into a white line.</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he mischievously looked over at Xun and Yudie, who had crept a little closer in order not to miss a word.</p>

  <p>Being mocked, Xi Youqin felt a little embarrassed, and she reluctantly let go of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>In the inner yard of the Immortal Mansion, everyone was seated.</p>

  <p>Saul was serving them cups of tea when a refreshing fragrance filled the air in the yard. Everyone seemed to smell it at once.</p>

  <p>Their beverage was wild tea from the depths of the Swirl Forest, and it was made with amber tree dew. Both these products were once difficult to collect, but ever since Augustus controlled the Swirl Forest, it was no longer a problem.</p>

  <p>"In ten years, you've reached the consummation of True God Realm. It's very difficult for us to have such resources here in the divine land,"</p>

  <p>Harold said as soon as he sat down.</p>

  <p>Everyone was thinking the same thing. The Floating Islands possessed the most resources in all the divine land, but it was virtually impossible for Luo Zheng to stay on any Floating Island. Was he hiding in some faraway hilly area or a second or third tier clan in the last ten years?</p>

  <p>It was simply beyond their imagination that Luo Zheng, who had disappeared for ten years, had returned as a consummate True God. They didn't understand it in the least.</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't be so quick to say that there aren't such resources in the divine land." Luo Zheng smiled and said, "You know, Tianming has also reached the consummation of True God Realm. And he didn't even need as much time as I did."</p>

  <p>"Tianming?" Harold asked. After pausing for a second in order to gather his thoughts, he continued, "The way he became a consummate True God is completely different from yours. It doesn't count."</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, Harold was clear on the role that every Godly Genius should play, and of course, he knew what kind of theurgies Tianming had.</p>

  <p>"What's the difference, exactly?" Luo Zheng asked, as suspicion washed over his face.</p>

  <p>"He has devoured many Commandments Slates and therefore, he can steadily improve his cultivation base without any hassle. That's the only reason he could reach the consummation of True God Realm in such a short period of time," Harold replied.</p>

  <p>"Devour the Commandments Slates?" Luo Zheng repeated in a shocked tone.</p>

  <p>"Well, let's just drop the subject now. Tell me, where did you go after you left the Han Clan's ancestral land?" This was one of the most important questions that were on the tips of everyone's tongue. They were all eager to hear the answer.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng paused for a suspenseful moment before saying, "I left the divine land."</p>

  <p>"What?! What do you mean you left the divine land? Are you saying you went to the chaos?" Augustus' voice climbed a notch higher all of a sudden. He stood up from his chair as he spoke anxiously.</p>

  <p>Even if he had controlled the Swirl Forest, and Harold the Everest Spirit Mountain, they didn't have the qualifications to leave the divine land.</p>

  <p>The chaotic energy would slowly erode their bodies until they were completely corroded. This was something that they couldn't resist, nor could they avoid it.</p>

  <p>Only the strong warriors at the Other Shore Realm or Holy Beings had the qualifications to roam through the chaos. Luo Zheng couldn't possibly have managed to do so.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, Augustus." Hallet gave Augustus a ferocious glare as he ordered him around, and Augustus obeyed at once.</p>

  <p>However, Harold wasn't quite so surprised. He knew that Luo Zheng had a special body and wasn't afraid of chaotic energy erosion, so he continued to question him. "Was it your mother who sent you out?"</p>

  <p>"Yes." Luo Zheng nodded in reply. "Then, I fell all the way to the bottom of the chaos."</p>

  <p>"It's been said that just outside the divine land, there's a mass of chaotic energy. Chaotic energy is everywhere, and it's both bleak and desolate.</p>

  <p>Did you absorb the chaotic energy and reach the consummation of True God Realm?" Augustus asked. The questions were relentless.</p>

  <p>Although Augustus' words were very stupid, what he said wasn't wrong.</p>

  <p>Most of the True Gods wouldn't care about what was outside the divine land in any way, but the consummate True Gods present had probably known about the chaotic world outside the divine land. After all, there were a few records about the chaos in the Immortal Mansion's library, which had all been left by Bromley.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng shook his head. "The bottom of the chaos isn't desolate.</p>

  <p>There are living creatures there, and many of them are strong warriors," he mentioned.</p>

  <p>"Huh? There are people at the bottom of the chaos? Do you know if they're extraordinary creatures?" With what he'd just heard, even Harold, who was usually quite composed, was rather surprised.</p>

  <p>Hallet, who had been nothing more than a silent spectator until now, suddenly raised his brows. "There's a world at the bottom?" he asked in awe.</p>

  <p>"That's right." Luo Zheng blinked. "It is a prison. There are many exiles inside the prison, and they are all from the Source World."</p>

  <p>"What kind of place is the Source World?" Augustus asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Hallet and Harold looked at one another, and then Harold said, "It's said that the Source World is the chaos' center. Since the exiles are locked up in the prison there, they are very powerful, aren't they?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, they're all strong warriors at the Other Shore Realm." Luo Zheng nodded in agreement.</p>

  <p>Disbelief registered in everyone's eyes, including Joy's.</p>

  <p>At the same time, a sense of crisis dawned over the group.</p>

  <p>The Yellow Emperor Guards who they were fighting against were at the Other Shore Realm. They didn't know if the exiles were friends or foes.</p>

  <p>If the exiles also had to get involved, the situation would become even more problematic.</p>
