  <p>
</p>

  <p>Of course, the Other Shore creatures that wandered in the Sanskrit Light Stage were well aware of the powerful strength of those monsters in the sea.</p>

  <p>Still, such a powerful monster fled in the presence of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>How mighty was he?</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng drove the bone plate and floated out of the Myriad Tribulations Storm. The blue-gold raindrops still hit his body, but the black cracks on his skin no longer posed any threat to him.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore creatures gathered at the entrance continued to drive their bone plates to make way for him.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the centipede came forward and said, "Congratulations on your achieving the Myriad Tribulations Body!"</p>

  <p>The creatures of the Source World couldn't enter the Land of Bone Tribulation, and in any case, it would take a long time for the Other Shore creatures to achieve the Myriad Tribulations Body.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," Luo Zheng answered with a nod.</p>

  <p>The centipede didn't say anything else, then he retreated to the side with the other creatures.</p>

  <p>They didn't dare to pry into the secrets of such a powerful warrior. They were afraid that if they behaved too attentively, they might annoy him.</p>

  <p>As for Luo Zheng, he walked out of the bone stairs and returned to the bone island again.</p>

  <p>If he wanted to leave the Other Shore, he had to wait until the effects of the Soul Interdicting Water disappeared.</p>

  <p>However, he didn't intend to leave the Other Shore at all.</p>

  <p>Li Bianxue, who had failed to enter Stage Thirty-two, still waited for him in the bone cavity. He could go there now and meet her since he had obtained the Myriad Tribulations Body.</p>

  <p>By the edge of the bone island stood the bone slaves who waited for orders.</p>

  <p>Since the bone slaves were no different from the dead, they looked like soulless skeletons when they lowered their heads and stayed motionless.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng approached them, however, they suddenly seemed to have souls and began to move.</p>

  <p>They proceeded to look for the bone oars, and when they found them, they quickly jumped back to the bone boat.</p>

  <p>Once they finished, Luo Zheng leaped lightly and landed steadily on the bone boat.</p>

  <p>It would take some time to return to the beach, but he wasn't in a hurry. He leaned firmly against the side of the boat and played with the long spear in his hand.</p>

  <p>"The Celestial Stone's light seemed a little brighter," he said.</p>

  <p>When the Celestial Spear was pointed at him, he saw that its tip was extremely dazzling even in the dark blue ocean.</p>

  <p>But after one shot, the tip of the spear quickly dimmed.</p>

  <p>After one hour, the light at the spear's tip became a little brighter again.</p>

  <p>It would take more than twenty hours for the Celestial Stone to completely recover. For now, it can only double your strength," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said as he stared at the long spear. "Once it has completely recovered, the spear will release its power. You can instantly kill any powerful warrior by then," he added.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was not too surprised to hear this.</p>

  <p>His body could carry over one hundred thousand Jun of force.</p>

  <p>If he were to extract all of that and infuse it into this spear, the spear's strike would probably contain over a million Jun of force!</p>

  <p>How terrifying would such an amount of force be?</p>

  <p>It was known that in the past, the human ancestor had only released less than ten million Jun of force even though he had fused with the best Other Shore Tokens from Stage Thirty-three.</p>

  <p>Then again, that force was supposed to complete the Finale Way.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Luo Zheng could release a million Jun of force now when he relied on the spear. Thus, one could only imagine how truly strong the spear was.</p>

  <p>But just as the Primeval Lord of Heaven had said, although the Celestial Stone was powerful, it sadly couldn't be used together with the Other Shore Tokens of the strengthening type. Therefore, choosing the Celestial Stone meant that one's increment of power would be fixed at nine times.</p>

  <p>In this case, the spear appeared nothing to a master at the Eternal Realm.</p>

  <p>"No matter how strong it is, I can't carry it," Luo Zheng said regretfully.</p>

  <p>The three Truths of Divine Dao in his body each carried a Civilization Artifact. The Civilization Artifacts were not like ordinary Other Shore Tokens that one could abandon. Once Luo Zheng had them, he would develop some sort of relationship with them.</p>

  <p>For instance, the Green Jade Spirit and the core of Heavenly Obsession Civilization were inseparable from him now. Of course, it was unrealistic for him to give them up.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, he could use the spear on the Other Shore. Although it wasn't a sword, it could be used as a weapon to increase strength.</p>

  <p>After the bone boat had drifted on the sea for a long time, it finally arrived at the beach made of bones.</p>

  <p>They docked the boat, then Luo Zheng set foot on the beach. The bone slaves followed suit and went to their positions, then their bones immediately scattered.</p>

  <p>Without rest, Luo Zheng walked along the beach and returned to the huge bone cave.</p>

  <p>After he reached the cave, he went to the huge bone cavity again.</p>

  <p>He thought that the bone cavity was empty, but the lively commotion in it proved that he was wrong.</p>

  <p>There was the Ear Mouse race, two members of the Separate Abyss race, one of the Celestial Wolf race, and Li Bianxue.</p>

  <p>Li Bianxue had previously sent a message to Luo Zheng where she told him that she couldn't enter Stage Thirty-two, and she would just wait for him to pass through the Land of Bone Tribulation in the Sanskrit Light Stage.</p>

  <p>However, she heard that the cultivation speed in the Land of Bone Tribulation was immensely slow. It took years to pass through it.</p>

  <p>Therefore, no matter how talented Luo Zheng was, it would probably still take him a few years to finish the cultivation. Of course, she didn't want to stay in one place all the time.</p>

  <p>Thus, she continued to enter the Sanskrit Light Stage to find a way to pass through it.</p>

  <p>She couldn't find a way, but she met several other Souls of Light.</p>

  <p>Those Souls of Light had become Holy Souls. But they couldn't enter Stage Thirty-two just like her. In the end, they decided to gather in the bone cavity to find a solution.</p>

  <p>They were shocked when they suddenly saw a person come out from the bone cave on the right.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng!" Li Bianxue exclaimed in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Have you already passed the Land of Bone Tribulation?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Pass the Land of Bone Tribulation?"</p>

  <p>"Does that mean that he has obtained the Myriad Tribulations Body?"</p>

  <p>"How is that possible?"</p>

  <p>The two members of the Separate Abyss race and that one of the Celestial Wolf race were stunned.</p>

  <p>One who had obtained the Myriad Tribulations Body could enter the Eternal Scroll Painting and reach the Eternal Realm.</p>

  <p>They subconsciously thought that it was impossible, but the name "Luo Zheng" was like a needle that pierced into their minds.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, who had brought his physical body to the Other Shore, was able to reach the Eternal Realm!</p>

  <p>"Squeak! It has only been three months, but he has already obtained the Myriad Tribulations Body.</p>

  <p>How could it be possible?"</p>

  <p>"It is too fast. Squeak!"</p>

  <p>The Ear Mice knew that he had entered the Land of Bone Tribulation, but they never thought that he would pass through the land so quickly!</p>

  <p>"Yes, I have passed the Land of Bone Tribulation," Luo Zheng said and nodded in response. "That's great!" Li Bianxue praised.</p>

  <p>There were changes in the Sanskrit Light Stage, and the bone cave that led to Stage Thirty-two was blocked.</p>

  <p>And she couldn't count on the Ear Mice or the members from the Separate Abyss race.</p>

  <p>They had been discussing in the bone cavity for a few days already, and all of them remained vigilant. They planned to leave the Other Shore as soon as there was any accident. Hence, she knew that she couldn't pin her hopes on them.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng must be able to solve the problem. For some ineffable reason, she was always strangely confident in him.</p>
