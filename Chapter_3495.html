  <p>
</p>

  <p>A white-faced man gazed at Zheng with interest. He was on the second floor and was observing the young man. "It is said that the disciples of the Flow Sword Sect act at their sweet will. I find that to be true, Yusuf. That guy is just like the younger you."</p>

  <p>Next to him was a strong man named Yusuf Gu, also a member of the Flow Sword Sect.</p>

  <p>Yusuf glared at Zheng coldly. "Don't take me for a fool. He's just joined the Land of Sword Grief but already has the audacity to challenge Abdul. He's simply an idiot asking for trouble."</p>

  <p>It was a well-known fact that Abdul was a backbone of the Land of Sword Grief.</p>

  <p>He'd gotten lucky recently, finding an unparalleled Other Shore Token in Stage Sixteen. As his strength surged, his ranking also steadily improved.</p>

  <p>If he played it safe, then he was set to reach the top 200 in the next couple of years and go up to the second floor.</p>

  <p>The white-faced man laughed at Yusuf's words. "I don't think he's that much of an idiot. He didn't say he would challenge Abdul. That young man is actually quite shrewd in my opinion."</p>

  <p>In his eyes, Zheng was a mere cunning newcomer who had no courage to issue a direct challenge to Abdul.</p>

  <p>"Still, it's not wise to piss off someone like Abdul," Yusuf reasoned.</p>

  <p>Zheng came from the Flow Sword Sect too and Yusuf had decided to stand up for him if he was bullied. Unfortunately, Zheng's words earlier had offended most of the disciples in the Land of Sword Grief. Yusuf didn't think he'd be able to protect him because of that.</p>

  <p>Abdul was ranked around 500th. The things Zheng just said insinuated that nearly half of the disciples were not qualified to challenge him.</p>

  <p>In all honesty, Abdul never expected Zheng to answer him in such a way.</p>

  <p>His Soul of Light emitted a sharp aura and charged straight towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>Despite the overwhelming pressure from Abdul's soul power, Zheng remained calm and collected, never showing any sort of fear.</p>

  <p>This placid reaction made Abdul feel strange. Was Zheng truly not affected at all?</p>

  <p>'Although he's just reached the Chaotic Source Realm, his soul is no weaker than mine, ' he thought to himself as he charged. 'Does he have some sort of magic treasure that lets him withstand soul attacks?'</p>

  <p>Despite his misgivings, Abdul soldiered on. He had to teach Zheng a lesson about being disrespectful.</p>

  <p>"Do you want to die?! This is the Land of Sword Grief, not the Flow Sword Sect!" Abdul reminded him.</p>

  <p>"So what?!" Zheng answered with obvious nonchalance.</p>

  <p>His uncaring reaction made the two disciples behind Abdul livid.</p>

  <p>These two disciples were from the Ivory Mountain and ranked lower than Abdul. Seeing someone like Zheng be rude to their superior irritated them greatly.</p>

  <p>"You brat! You've got a sharp tongue but little to no brains! If you're really capable, why don't you challenge me then?" one of them shouted.</p>

  <p>"Yeah! Come and challenge me too while you're at it! You have the right to challenge me once!" Not one to be outdone, the other disciple also jeered at Zheng.</p>

  <p>It seemed the two were set offering themselves up for a challenge.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng simply gave them an indifferent look. "He's not qualified to challenge me. What more the two of you?"</p>

  <p>His words drove the two red with rage.</p>

  <p>"You!"</p>

  <p>According to the rules of the Land of Sword Grief, veterans were forbidden from fighting with newcomers. Only newcomers were allowed to choose their opponents.</p>

  <p>"Who do you think is qualified?" Abdul asked through gritted teeth.</p>

  <p>Zheng simply pointed at the bronze building. "Someone inside this bronze building."</p>

  <p>"Please!"</p>

  <p>Abdul held back his anger and went towards the bronze building with the newcomers following behind.</p>

  <p>He needed to let Zheng know the consequences of offending them.</p>

  <p>As soon as the new disciples entered the first floor, those who were waiting there immediately gathered around and blocked Zheng.</p>

  <p>"You'll pay the price for your arrogance, brat!"</p>

  <p>"Am I qualified to challenge you? Choose me!"</p>

  <p>"Choose me!" "Choose me!"</p>

  <p>"…"</p>

  <p>It was plainly obvious that Zheng's provocation had angered the Land of Sword Grief's veterans. Almost everyone wanted to challenge him.</p>

  <p>"If you defeat me, I'll pay you ten thousand divine crystals!"</p>

  <p>The prize was a small amount for these disciples.</p>

  <p>It served as a starting bid as everyone followed suit.</p>

  <p>"If you defeat me, I'll give you fifty thousand!"</p>

  <p>"One hundred thousand!"</p>

  <p>"One hundred and fifty thousand!"</p>

  <p>"I don't care who wins! If you challenge me, I'll give you two hundred thousand!"</p>

  <p>Zheng was completely surrounded by the disciples and he didn't know whether he should laugh or cry.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge and Dorothy could only exchange confused looks with each other.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Chaim was laughing. He hadn't expected Zheng to be this popular. Even the veterans were offering him divine crystals.</p>

  <p>Once the bid reached four hundred thousand divine crystals, Zheng finally felt the need to address them. "I'm not lacking divine crystals," he said.</p>

  <p>His battle with the Evil God had him consume tens of millions of divine crystals and he recently used a huge amount to refine his body. Four hundred thousand was too meager of an amount to interest him.</p>

  <p>"Since you aren't lacking divine crystals, how about treasures and weapons?"</p>

  <p>"I have an intermediate Profound Blood Treasure! If you..."</p>

  <p>"I have a premium Profound Blood Treasure!"</p>

  <p>"I've got a sword that is a primary..."</p>

  <p>The disciples were now bringing out all sorts of magic weapons, mainly swords since they were the known weapons for the Oneness Sky Palace disciples.</p>

  <p>It was a complete mess. It seemed that as long as Zheng chose to challenge them, they would meet all of his requirements.</p>

  <p>Like Chaim, the newcomers couldn't help but tear up from having to hold back their laughter. Just what kind of reaction would the veterans have once they found out Zheng's real strength?</p>

  <p>"Enough!" Zheng announced, hiding his frustration behind a bitter smile.</p>

  <p>Realizing that Zheng was unwilling to challenge them, the veterans immediately turned hostile.</p>

  <p>A young man, short in stature, stepped forward. "It seems you don't want to choose an opponent. Are you lacking guts? By a month, we'll have the right to challenge you and you won't be able to turn us down!"</p>

  <p>Abdul sneered. "This guy's obviously playing with us. He doesn't dare to challenge us at all! Let's go. We'll see how miserable he'll be after a month."</p>

  <p>Zheng couldn't help but roll his eyes. "I can challenge you but first, I want to see the rankings of the Land of Sword Grief."</p>

  <p>Everyone's eyes lit up. His request made sense. Maybe he wanted to play it smart and choose the people at the bottom of the rankings in hopes that it would increase his chances of victory.</p>

  <p>It didn't matter though.</p>

  <p>To them, even the 1115th warrior could take care of Zheng effortlessly.</p>

  <p>"This is the Ranking Stone!" someone in the crowd shouted. The disciples parted and allowed Zheng a path towards the said stone.</p>

  <p>At the end of the hall was a black stone pillar.</p>

  <p>Someone rubbed his body against the magic array and names suddenly appeared like glowing carvings. There were 1, 116 names on it since Zheng and the other newcomers hadn't been added yet. Right now, they were ranked 1117th.</p>

  <p>These names were divided into three sections.</p>

  <p>There were a little over 30 names in the first section: those on the third floor with the top spot taken by someone called Libby Li.</p>
