<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The creatures Fire Emissary had brought neither reached the Eternal Realm nor gained the Myriad Tribulations Bodies.</p>

  <p>However, as creatures from the Grand Plain Stage, they were not weak. At the least they could put a lot of pressure on the Holy Souls.</p>

  <p>The Ghost Cicadas that had been sent out earlier had already made Winchell's group struggle hard. If these three Other Shore races joined forces with them, there was no doubt they would be crushed.</p>

  <p>These Other Shore creatures continued entering the white vortexes while Fire Emissary's gaze fell on Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Obviously, he had come for Luo Zheng by the order of the Element Spirit race.</p>

  <p>What puzzled him was that they had only ordered the Crane Split race, the Ice Lynx race and the Cyan Spirit race to attack. These three races belonged to the second tier in Stage Thirty-two and possessed ordinary strength.</p>

  <p>If reports were true, Luo Zheng had killed the Blood Spirit Tortoise on the Other Shore and these three races would be far from enough to challenge him.</p>

  <p>This confused Fire Emissary. He had no idea what the Element Spirit race was up to.</p>

  <p>In fact, when Xuanyuan gave him such an order in the Source World, he had outspoken his doubt. But the emperor did not explain and just ordered him to do as he was told.</p>

  <p>Pearce and Auden were very hesitant when they saw the Other Shore creatures constantly drilling into the painting.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was clearly the Fire Emissary's target and not Winchell.</p>

  <p>If they entered the painting as well, they definitely wouldn't be able to save Winchell. If Luo Zheng made a move, defeating these creatures would be no problem, but he would have to stay alert to their cunning tricks.</p>

  <p>In Pearce's hesitation, Luo Zheng turned around and stretched a hand to Li Bianxue.</p>

  <p>"Give me the Celestial Spear," he said.</p>

  <p>Li Bianxue paused a moment and then with a gentle wave of her hand, a long spear burst from her Sumeru Space and landed firmly in Luo Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, are you really going in?" Pearce thought about dissuading him, but he couldn't stand aside and helplessly watch Winchell and the others being killed.</p>

  <p>"I can't watch them die. Master Winchell was the one who brought me to the Taiyi Heaven Palace, and now they're in danger because they were searching for a Heavy Stone for me. How can I just stand by?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng finished speaking and walked straight towards Fire Emissary, the Celestial Spear spinning like a rotor in his hand before he pointed it at the latter's face. "Fire Emissary, you've been famous for a long time. Do you have the guts to get into the painting as well?"</p>

  <p>Fire Emissary was embarrassed, as he hadn't expected Luo Zheng to challenge him so suddenly.</p>

  <p>But he didn't say a word to this junior's provocation.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng hadn't expected a response anyway, and he just jumped right into the vortex.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>With the Celestial Spear in his hand, he fell into the stone forest.</p>

  <p>The members of the Crane Split race, the Ice Lynx race and the Cyan Sprit race gathered up north after they entered the stone forest.</p>

  <p>These three races didn't hold a high position in Stage Thirty-two, so seeking refuge with the Element Spirit race was all they could do, but even so, the Element Spirit race didn't attach great importance to them.</p>

  <p>The leaders of the three races had been overjoyed to receive orders from the Element Spirit race.</p>

  <p>The only drawback was the Element Spirit race only allowed them to attack some Holy Souls...</p>

  <p>Although these souls were strong enough to hold their own against ordinary Other Shore creatures, they were nothing compared to the three races.</p>

  <p>Asking the three Other Shore races to fight was quite a fuss.</p>

  <p>"Just a few Holy Souls. We Ice Lynx can deal with them. You two races should stay and rest here!"</p>

  <p>"Humph! I can handle them myself!"</p>

  <p>"I guess it depends on who gets there first!"</p>

  <p>The members of these three races rushed to the north.</p>

  <p>The topography of the stone forest was very strange. There were giant stone pillars all around that towered into the clouds.</p>

  <p>On the path between the stone pillars, the corpses of Ghost Cicadas were scattered everywhere. In some places, the corpses even piled into hill-like mounds. One could only imagine how fierce the previous battles had been.</p>

  <p>Behind the two huge stone pillars on the northernmost end, was a col that was easily defended but difficult to attack.</p>

  <p>Five powerful Holy Souls of the Taiyi Heaven Palace hid inside with a hundred-foot-tall giant ape stood in front of them.</p>

  <p>Winchell had morphed into the giant ape, now any Ghost Cicadas that tried to rush in would be torn to pieces!</p>

  <p>It was because of Winchell that these five people of the Taiyi Heaven Palace survived.</p>

  <p>"There are fewer Ghost Cicadas!"</p>

  <p>"Great! If we can kill them all, we can leave this damned place!"</p>

  <p>"Winchell, thank you so much!"</p>

  <p>Those powerful Holy Souls hiding behind Winchell had launched attacks as well, but they didn't kill nearly as many as Winchell.</p>

  <p>Winchell roared in response.</p>

  <p>If the Ghost Cicadas were really their only opponent, they might narrowly escape alive this time.</p>

  <p>But would things go as they hoped?</p>

  <p>Once Winchell had crushed the last wave of Ghost Cicadas, he heard a rumble of footsteps rolling out of nowhere. Then he saw a group of Other Shore creatures rushing at them like a tidal wave.</p>

  <p>The sight of them dissipated Winchell's will to fight like a ball deflated in an instant.</p>

  <p>He was very clear that it would be impossible for him to defeat all of them alone, and those with him felt the same. All their hearts sank as they accepted their fate that they would now die here.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The giant ape's skin flashed a cyan light and shrunk all the way down to Winchell's original size.</p>

  <p>With a flip of his hand, a round black stone appeared in his palm. It was a Heavy Stone.</p>

  <p>They had been very lucky this time and not long after entering the stone forest, he found this Heavy Stone.</p>

  <p>"What a pity..."</p>

  <p>He raised his hand and was about to throw the Heavy Stone when a wild clanging suddenly rang out from not far off.</p>

  <p>Behind the creatures rushing over, came the bang of heavy objects clashing.</p>

  <p>Then there were broken limbs floating in the air, blood splashing everywhere and gruesome howling could be heard throughout.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>A Celestial Spear was spinning in Luo Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>To him, these Other Shore creatures were nothing.</p>

  <p>He had only released fifty thousand divine megatons of force, which was still far more than these creatures could take.</p>

  <p>The long spear spun around like a windmill, the slightest touch of it causing death or serious injury.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng killed the creatures all along the path like this. When the last Other Shore creatures had been minced, he appeared before Winchell and the others. His body was soaked in blood of all sorts of colors, as if he had been painted on like he was a canvas.</p>

  <p>Winchell and the others stood not far away, staring blankly as they watched Luo Zheng rushing in and killing every creature in his path.</p>

  <p>They had been at the end of their rope and now couldn't believe what they were witnessing!</p>
