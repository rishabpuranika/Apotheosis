<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Humans on earth had a deep understanding and knowledge about runes, which gave them more information on how they were able to utilize the runes. Runes were not only there as characters, nor alphabets--they were even more important than the weapons that protected warriors' lives.</p>

  <p>The runes were widely used in many areas. As such, the Cloud Sect's cultivation places were established with magical arrays that were made of runes and other materials. Many weapons were seen inscribed with runes on their blades. These weapons were revered. Not only were these weapons used for protection, but rather they were enforced with great power.</p>

  <p>When it came to guarding, there were different kinds of sect protecting arrays which were closely related to runes. For pill refiners and weapon refiners, they used fire runes to strengthen the flames' power. All beings should be thankful for the runic experts who gave their time and effort into studying those materials. If it weren't for them, the powers and wonders of the runes would not be harnessed.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon's divine texture was otherworldly, a heritage from another broader world. Its conception was far beyond the common runes people knew. And its creation, design, and power were so intricately well thought of that the runes in the Central Region were no match for it. The divine texture's powers were among the cream of the crop, exceptional.</p>

  <p>"The divine texture? So...can I start practicing the divine texture now?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng asked nervously while containing his happiness.</p>

  <p>"Yes, you may. But even if you take the soul essences, you might not be able to handle it since yours is still not very strong. Moreover, if you must start to learn the divine texture at this very moment, mind that you will only be able to master the lowest grade. Are you sure you want to learn it now?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng replied, light glinting in his eyes, "Rome was not built in one day.</p>

  <p>And the longest journey begins with the first step. If I don't take the first step, when will I ever start?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, you're right. Drawing the divine texture would consume a lot of your spiritual power. But at the same time, it is a good way to temper your spirit. This is the right time for you to learn it..." The cyan dragon continued. Slowly and firmly, he said, "But the first step of creating the divine texture is to infuse your spiritual power to the tip of the paintbrush."</p>

  <p>"The tip of the paintbrush? What paintbrush?" Luo Luo Zheng asked with confusion.</p>

  <p>"Of course it is the paintbrush that is used to draw the divine texture. But it seems that you don't have all the materials needed to draw it. If you really want to learn the technique, you must first gather all the materials," the cyan dragon said lightly.</p>

  <p>"I think it won't be difficult for you to infuse your spiritual power to the tip of the paintbrush. After all, you have already practiced Spiritual Thorn and have already comprehended the process of turning a soul into a thorn. Gather and prepare the materials tomorrow, then I will teach you to draw the first divine texture stroke. After that, I'll assess whether you have the talent to master the skill."</p>

  <p>Then a list of materials appeared in Luo Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng felt giddy seeing the cyan dragon's list of materials. Runic experts or weapon refiners didn't become masters in one day. No one became experts in a day. It was all about patience, practice, and heart. It was just like the case when Luo Luo Zheng wanted to refine weapons with the heavenly essence. The real technique of weapon refining could not be grasped by relying only on the guidance book of the weapon refining master Chase.</p>

  <p>Even if there was a famous teacher who could demonstrate each step and give guidance, it would still be extremely difficult for him to go anywhere by relying on his own understanding of the skill.</p>

  <p>And that was why some Cloud Sect disciples from the noble clans and the Cloud Hall disciples from the influential families despised someone like Luo Luo Zheng, who was from the grassroots. People from the noble clans were people born with silver spoons in their mouths. But Luo Luo Zheng was different.</p>

  <p>He had to double up his efforts into achieving his goals for he didn't have much. The noble clans had the resources to get anything that they had wanted. If they had wanted to learn anything, their family could have easily hired a famous teacher and their performance couldn't be as bad under the guidance of a successful master.</p>

  <p>That was also why it was difficult for the disciples from the grassroots to stand out, as ninety-nine percent of these disciples were already left behind when they were born.</p>

  <p>Doors were opened for a chance at mastering multiple skills. Now that Luo Luo Zheng had finally found the legendary teacher, the cyan dragon, nothing could stop him from achieving greatness.</p>

  <p>The sun shone brightly on Luo Zheng's face. He got up, yawned and stretched.</p>

  <p>He was about to go to the dining table for breakfast when suddenly, he felt his body trembling uncontrollably. Saint Morphens was controlling him. He wasn't able to do anything but be the victim. He struggled with it, fighting the Morphens controlling his body when suddenly, his body flew out of the room and zoomed towards the grey building.</p>

  <p>To Luo Luo Zheng, fighting three battles a day was a big burden. He had to stand out among the disciples, proving to himself and to others that poor family couldn't make him less of a warrior.</p>

  <p>Yesterday, only about one hundred disciples were there in the grey building. But today, when Luo Luo Zheng entered the hall, he was surprised by what he saw. There weren't one hundred people. The people doubled!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng could not believe his eyes. So many people were in the hall that a warrior could not pass without having to break the sea of people. He wasn't sure how many disciples were usually there in the building, but he was sure that it wasn't this many. As the name suggested, only the elites were allowed to enter the Elite House. Warriors had to go through numerous and difficult tests to be ever considered worthy of entering the Elite House. Even the warriors of the Cloud School, which was affiliated to the Cloud Hall, and the warriors of the other five great sects, had to undergo the series of tests. Was this a regular scene?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was baffled. He never thought of meeting this many more people than ever before. More than that, he was surprised at the sight of some Internal Elixir Realm masters in the hall.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng raised an eyebrow. He had unintentionally poured scorn on them.</p>

  <p>But it was not his doing. He was controlled by Tia. Did they have to make such a fuss? Those Internal Elixir Realm masters were not the members of the Elite House, Luo Luo Zheng supposed.</p>

  <p>In all honesty, those Internal Elixir Realm masters were not from the Elite House. Luo Luo Zheng thought of a reason for their presence--his manners.</p>

  <p>Stories of Luo Zheng's unruly manners for the past two days had spread around the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>All the disciples of the Elite House knew that there was a new member who was extremely arrogant. And that new disciple was only a nature creature. The news was not only known to the disciples of the Elite House. The news spread even to other members and masters. It was not surprising that even some of the elders of the Cloud Hall knew about this obnoxious nature creature.</p>

  <p>And Fernandez was one of elders that was stirred by this news.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng was on the Cloud Road, Fernandez had shown special care for Luo Luo Zheng. Within his ability, he would like to speak for Luo Luo Zheng, vouch for him to get him out of any trouble. Fernandez saw Luo Zheng's potential. He saw that Luo Luo Zheng would become an extraordinary disciple in the Cloud Hall in the future. He got great talent. And it was only a matter of time for him to achieve success. Fernandez believed in him.</p>
