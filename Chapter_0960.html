<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Moon Pavilion was not spectacularly large or tall like other establishments due to it being only three stories high. However, it was directly adjacent to the limpid river, and the scenery one could see if he happened to take a glimpse at it was extremely beautiful and elicited feelings of tranquility. Since ancient times, many people had turned up in this pavilion to recite poems. Thus, the Moon Pavilion had a first-class reputation as people spent a lot of money and time enjoying themselves there.</p>

  <p>Once Zheng had randomly ordered a few simple yet elegant dishes, Zheng looked into the distance, leaning his head on his hand absent-mindedly.</p>

  <p>Inside the pavilion, there were a handful of scholars shaking their heads and chanting an old song at the tables beside where he sat. When they were in high spirits, they picked up the chopsticks located on the table to beat the bowl from time to time. The men who beat the bowl seemed to be adept at beating it rhythmically, so the beating sound they made sounded pleasant.</p>

  <p>Amused at the performance, Zheng also found it interesting when he heard this and even clapped after they performed. Grateful for the attention, those people flashed Zheng a quick smile.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, most of the scholars situated in the Moon Pavilion were not warriors. At this time, Zheng also sighed deeply, a little wistful at the thought that such a kind of ordinary life was also great and enjoyable in itself. Despite this, Zheng ultimately understood that the path he had chosen for himself, a warrior, was something intrinsically valuable and there was no reason for him to retreat.</p>

  <p>From the first day he had started to pursue and cultivate the martial arts, he was destined to struggle against the heaven, the earth, and everything in between. Even though he thought it was possible for him not to reach the land of promise even if he kept on cultivating himself, he understood that he was definitely falling into the everlasting perdition if he retreated now.</p>

  <p>While the scholars busied themselves with playing and singing at the same time, several warriors walked in the pavilion. Apparently, these particular set of warriors were all at the Illuminating Soul Realm, and they immediately shouted out loud the moment they came in, as if they owned the place. As they exuded such haughtiness by being disruptive, the scholars who were in the Moon Pavilion stared at them angrily.</p>

  <p>On the other side, those warriors did not seem to be aware of this fact, or did not care at all. Striding inside with their heads held up high, they just despised and ignored the mortals.</p>

  <p>Unimpressed by the sight of the boisterous group, Zheng turned around and continued to mind his own business, eating his food and drinking.</p>

  <p>However, his ears managed to pick up the flow of their conversation and it slightly intrigued him.</p>

  <p>"Alas! I'm so tired!" one of them pronounced, stretching his arms languidly before placing them behind his head. "The Ethereal Spirit Sect members do not treat us as disciples at all! They just treat us as slaves."</p>

  <p>The warrior huffed and gulped down his wine, venting to the others about the unfair treatment and the unhappiness buried deep in his heart.</p>

  <p>"Shh! Do not speak so loud. If the inner disciples of the Ethereal Spirit Sect happened to hear your words and told the sect leaders about this, you would definitely be in trouble by then!" another warrior reminded him in a low voice while looking at his companion with a strict expression.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing their exchange, the realization finally dawned on Zheng.</p>

  <p>These warriors were independent warriors before. Due to having no other options, they had to join the Ethereal Spirit Sect despite having initial doubts. It was obvious right then and there that they were not satisfied with their current situation.</p>

  <p>"Alas! I hope this matter can end soon. Otherwise, if we continue to wander around the city in a state of extreme nervousness and fear, it's going to be really tiresome!" one of them exclaimed, frowning at the thought of the reality they were facing.</p>

  <p>Shaking his head forlornly, another warrior replied, "I think that if the young lady of the Xi Clan were able to find a man to sleep with, everything could be resolved." Zheng heard a pregnant pause before the man's next words made him suddenly still. "And Eddie would not care about or think about her anymore!"</p>

  <p>The minute he overheard those words, Zheng was instantly surprised and his ears perked up. 'What does he mean by that?' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>"The young lady of the Xi Clan?" Zheng muttered, as something started to form in his mind. Furrowing his eyebrows, he clasped his hands in front of him, foregoing the food in front of him to gather his thoughts instead.</p>

  <p>What he had just heard was certainly strange, for Eddie was considered to be the strongest and most powerful person in the Central Region.</p>

  <p>Therefore, he could surely surround himself with all the women his heart desired. If Eddie himself, despite his reputation, kept on thinking about that woman, she must have been special; perhaps, she had something to do with the Purple Power Body.</p>

  <p>While Zheng was in the middle of deliberating with himself, his figure suddenly flashed. As he was just sitting still a moment ago, he suddenly appeared next to the group of the discussing warriors in the blink of an eye while maintaining his sitting position. Moreover, what was more baffling was the fact that the stool he was sitting on also moved over with him, but from the beginning until the end, he did not make a single sound. It was as if he had acted like a ghost.</p>

  <p>When the group of scholars witnessed the scene unfold before their very eyes, they assumed straightaway that they had seen something wrong.</p>

  <p>Blinking in disbelief, they rubbed their eyes and looked once more, only to discover that Zheng managed to stealthily move his stool more than ten feet away from his original place. With their expressions visibly brightening and their eyes lighting up with undiluted surprise, they all instantaneously believed that they had just encountered a master.</p>

  <p>As for the group of warriors who were drinking the wine and enjoying themselves in their table, they were also reasonably startled by the sudden appearance of Zheng. With a hard look, one of them glared at Zheng and asked, "Hey, what was that for?"</p>

  <p>"Clank!" Without breaking eye contact, Zheng passively dropped a supreme life vitality crystal onto the table. With a serious tone, Zheng immediately said, "I'll pay for the wine and food."</p>

  <p>The moment the warriors laid their eyes upon the glistening supreme life vitality crystal, they found themselves gasping and unable to look away from it.</p>

  <p>Everyone was well-aware of the fact that the prices of the food in the Moon Pavilion were awfully expensive, and an average person could definitely not be able to afford it. Nevertheless, it was possible for a warrior to dine there, as one or two low-grade life vitality crystals would be sufficient enough to pay for consuming food in the pavilion for half a month.</p>

  <p>Astonishingly, this supreme life vitality crystal that Zheng casually threw out was more or less equal to about a million low-grade life vitality crystals. In other words, with this exceptional supreme life vitality crystal, Zheng could book the entire Moon Pavilion and have extravagant meals there every day for several years.</p>
