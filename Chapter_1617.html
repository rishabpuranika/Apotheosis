  <p>
</p>

  <p>Boom! The silence in this corridor was broken by this sound.</p>

  <p>It came from the flame, which suddenly exploded in front of Luo Zheng in a magnificent flash of color.</p>

  <p>However, this flame didn't burn his body. In fact, this flame had originally been part of the flames of the nihility. It was a flame that had burned a soul!</p>

  <p>However, the power hidden within the flame was unimaginably strong!</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The long corridor suddenly disappeared ahead of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>What replaced it was a world of bitterly cold ice and snow!</p>

  <p>Within the swirling and frigid wind, the power of the Ice Law was nearly incalculable!</p>

  <p>'My soul has forcefully been pulled into this world of ice and snow?' Luo Zheng thought, looking down at his hands. There was a jade-green glow floating around his body. He was at the perfect soul state.</p>

  <p>Ding-dong!</p>

  <p>The crisp jingle of a metallic bell could be heard.</p>

  <p>Then Luo Zheng saw a small bell suspended in the air!</p>

  <p>"What is this bell?"</p>

  <p>After the small bell's appearance, a figure gradually emerged from within the snowstorm.</p>

  <p>It was a woman wearing nothing but a green and blue colored ribbon, wrapped around her graceful figure!</p>

  <p>This woman flew towards Luo Zheng with her bare legs treading uncaringly through the endless cold. She quietly stared at him.</p>

  <p>Brrr!</p>

  <p>Before, it had not been so cold, and the toughened strength of Zheng's soul was powerful enough to withstand any normal cold.</p>

  <p>However, under this woman's indifferent gaze, Luo Zheng felt like he had fallen into an ice cellar which had been frozen for ten thousand years. At this moment, it was as if his soul was about to be sealed away. The surface of his soul had frozen over, and a thin layer of frost appeared. Luo Zheng was now even too cold to think at this point.</p>

  <p>"What a strong use of the power of the Ice Law! But this is only the perception released by the soul. It's only an illusion!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes flashed, and the green light which lit up the surface of his soul grew even more intense!</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>The frost layer that had attached itself to Zheng's body suddenly exploded into countless cracks, and with a series of low popping sounds, the fragments fell to the ground!</p>

  <p>When the woman floating in the air saw this, a faint smile appeared on her face, but it melted away to be replaced by a chilly look.</p>

  <p>Instantly, she took up the bell in her hand and lightly shook it. A large drift of snowflakes descended in a flurry from the sky!</p>

  <p>"More?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng muttered as his face grew cold again. He dashed towards the woman at a high speed.</p>

  <p>The cold wind howled past Zheng's ears, which had reddened from the chill, as he rushed towards the woman. But he noticed that the woman only lightly swayed in midair like a snowflake, flying backwards and out of reach, while he was dashing ahead!</p>

  <p>The more Luo Zheng advanced, the more she would simply retreat.</p>

  <p>The two of them engaged in this dash of pursuit and retreat in this boundless space, but the distance between them could not close.</p>

  <p>"This movement technique... It appears so familiar..."</p>

  <p>Zheng's brow suddenly furrowed, but a hint of light also flashed in his eyes as he smiled grimly!</p>

  <p>'Eight Smoky Melodies?'</p>

  <p>Only that kind of strange movement technique could allow one to become as light as a feather and maintain a distance from one's opponent.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng had only been able to successfully keep his opponent three inches away from him so far while practicing the Eight Smoky Melodies. If his opponent had presented an extremely strong method, they would then be able to break the three-inch distance and close in on Luo Zheng. For example, Lucille had broken his Eight Smoky Melodies during their confrontation!</p>

  <p>When his thoughts traveled there, a bit of white mist emanated out from the surface of Zheng's soul. He also activated his own Eight Smoky Melodies.</p>

  <p>Huff...</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng had activated the Eight Smoky Melodies, he became as light as a feather as well.</p>

  <p>Strictly speaking, the Eight Smoky Melodies was not a movement technique per say, but rather a body refining technique. However, it was fundamentally different to an ordinary body refining technique.</p>

  <p>It could make one as light as smoke. In life, if there was a wind blowing, smoke would drift along with the wind!</p>

  <p>Thus, the Eight Smoky Melodies relied on external forces, not its user's own strength. It made use of the opponent's own force and momentum to repel the wielder of the Eight Smoky Melodies.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Zheng's speed after activating the Eight Smoky Melodies wasn't very high, but the woman's speed had also slowed down. She was originally being 'pushed' by Zheng's expending of energy in trying to catch her. With Luo Zheng now slowly fluttering, the resulting thrust had become minimal. And the woman could no longer take advantage of the effort, so the distance between the two was shrinking rapidly!</p>

  <p>When the woman saw Luo Zheng slowly floating closer, a look of confusion flashed across her snowy white face.</p>

  <p>"You... You know how to use the Floating Feather Technique too?"</p>

  <p>From the moment this woman had appeared, she hadn't spoken a single word. This was the first time she had addressed Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Floating Feather Technique? No, I'm using another movement technique."</p>

  <p>As he drew closer and closer, Luo Zheng stretched out his hand towards the small bell!</p>

  <p>The woman's waist gently twisted, and the bell rang again. After avoiding Zheng's grabbing hand, the snow between the heaven and earth suddenly increased in size, becoming incomparably huge. A single snowflake had suddenly become the size of a washbasin! The giant snowflakes condensed together and formed into a massive hailstone, which quickly plummeted down like a giant boulder. And for a time, the entire world was filled with the crisp sounds of cracking and splitting ice.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and the woman both circulated their movement technique and were able to safely avoid the hail. However, because of the hail's disturbance, there was a reintroduction of energy and force between Luo Zheng and the woman. As a result, Luo Zheng was unable to get close to the woman.</p>
