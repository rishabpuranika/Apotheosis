<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 702 The Primordial Energy (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The cyan dragon's seventh brother was one of the nine dragons.</p>

  <p>Back in the city of the Genuine Dragon World, the cyan dragon had been successful in swallowing the Owl Beast's evil spirit.</p>

  <p>That evil spirit was divided into three parts. Those three parts, according to the cyan dragon, were extremely useful: one could be used to cure the cyan dragon itself, the other could be used to wake up his seventh brother, and the third could help Luo Zheng with the creation of the soul seed.</p>

  <p>It was a long time before the cyan dragon came up with the decision to finally wake his seventh brother. Luo Zheng, however, was patient and waited respectfully for the cyan dragon.</p>

  <p>Now, he sat cross-legged and immersed himself in the silence. Closing his eyes and taking a deep breath, Luo Zheng slipped into a deep, meditative state.</p>

  <p>During this time, his mind relaxed and his soul was able to enter into the depths of his psyche.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng found the cyan dragon coil around the huge mysterious furnace. At first glance, the dragon looked fearsome and scary. However, his fierce look softened once he realized who the visitor was.</p>

  <p>Uncoiling himself from the furnace, the cyan dragon approached Luo Zheng and opened his jaw wide. In his mouth was a huge, black bead.</p>

  <p>"Is that…? That's the black bead from the Owl Beast's evil spirit, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon nodded. "Uh-huh," he confirmed. "After absorbing the Owl Beast's evil spirit, my body became much stronger. Hopefully, I can also wake my brother up with this bead."</p>

  <p>Having said that, the cyan dragon spat out the bead. Both he and Luo Zheng watched as the black bead flew over their heads and towards the dragon-shaped sculptures on the surface of the mysterious furnace. It shot itself right into the gaping mouth of one of the dragons.</p>

  <p>As soon as the bead touched the dragon's mouth, it transformed into some kind of viscous dark matter quite similar to the soul essence refined by the Dark Devil Phantom. However, it seemed much purer than the soul essence.</p>

  <p>Once the dark matter was swallowed into the dragon's mouth, everything became quiet.</p>

  <p>One of the reasons why Luo Zheng was willing to risk the destruction of his own soul to help the cyan dragon in capturing the Owl Beast's evil spirit was that the dragon's brother had the capacity to refine his body. However, they'd have to wake him up first.</p>

  <p>Body refining skills were not very popular in the Central Region. All the sects and warriors preferred and practiced the refining techniques of the life vitality system. Only a few people refined their bodies, so there were very few body refining techniques.</p>

  <p>If they succeeded in waking up the cyan dragon's brother, he could help Luo Zheng refine his body and considerably enhance his effectiveness in combat.</p>

  <p>The dragon statue remained still while Luo Zheng and the cyan dragon patiently waited with rapt attention. Surely the Owl Beast's evil spirit was enough.</p>

  <p>They had risked so much to obtain it. It must be, no, it had to be enough.</p>

  <p>Seconds passed.</p>

  <p>The clock was ticking.</p>

  <p>But nothing was changing from the ornament.</p>

  <p>A period of thirty seconds passed.</p>

  <p>The silence was deafening and it shattered whatever hope Luo Zheng and the cyan dragon had. After so much trouble and expectations, all of it only led to failure. Zheng's and the cyan dragon's faces fell with disappointment.</p>

  <p>The black bead from the Owl Beast's evil spirit hadn't been enough to awaken the dragon.</p>

  <p>However, just as all hope had been eradicated in their hearts, the dragon statue suddenly began to shake.</p>

  <p>"B-Brother…." the cyan dragon murmured, eyes shining with hope.</p>

  <p>A wisp of red began to appear on the petrified dragon statue, staining the stone with the hope of awakening.</p>

  <p>Crack.</p>

  <p>As the red bled through the statue, multiple cracks began to appear. One by one, the pieces of debris fell away to reveal the grand beast underneath. The red dragon, one of the nine dragons, had finally awakened.</p>

  <p>The dragon raised his head in slight bewilderment, "Where am I?" he asked in a rough, hoarse voice.</p>

  <p>"Brother," the cyan dragon greeted his newly awakened sibling. "It's me."</p>

  <p>The red dragon cautiously uncoiled from the mysterious furnace. "Little brother!" the red dragon called. Familiarity was written over his face as he slowly glided down the furnace towards the cyan dragon. "Are you the one who woke me up from my slumber?" he asked as he stopped in front of the cyan dragon. Slowly, the memories that had long been frozen in time were rapidly coming back to the red dragon. The red dragon could now remember perfectly. His memories were no longer in a haze.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon nodded in response. "Yes," he replied. "My ability is very limited. There are things that are beyond my comprehension, so I opted to wake you up," he added. The red dragon knotted his brows. "What do you mean?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon started talking in a language that Luo Zheng had never heard before. It was the dragon's language.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng wasn't able to catch anything as the two dragon brothers began to converse in rapid dragon language. The syllables were too complex, but he had no doubt that the cyan dragon was now telling his brother all that he had missed while in slumber. As the two conversed, the red dragon began to look Luo Zheng up and down.</p>

  <p>Despite being uneasy, Luo Zheng never showed it. Instead, he stared back at the dragon and coolly turned his head towards the fire that was lit on the furnace. The red dragon caught Zheng's attention back when he laughed.</p>

  <p>"Human, did you really turn yourself into a spiritual weapon?" he asked with amusement dancing in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Luo Zheng replied with eagerness and pride as an answer to the dragon's question. However, he was confused as to what the dragon found amusing.</p>

  <p>"There are billions, heck, even trillions of creatures in this universe," the red dragon said, "but nowhere will you be able to find such a unique and valuable body as yours. You actually used the primordial energy you produced during the refinement of your body to wash your belly? What were you thinking?" The red dragon shook his head at Luo Zheng, obviously disappointed but also slightly amused.</p>

  <p>Zheng's brows knitted. "The primordial energy?" he repeated, shooting a confused look at the red dragon.</p>

  <p>The red dragon frowned, "Didn't my brother tell you? Your body is the rudiment of primordial energy!"</p>

  <p>The red dragon's declaration echoed in his ears. "It's quite a pity you don't know how to use it at all. Truly a pity," the dragon started. "After you stepped into the nature level, you had to practice the refinement techniques of the life vitality system, so you just wasted the primordial energy away..." the mighty dragon began in a low, cold voice. "You do not know how to use that energy, so you cleansed your body by using that energy!" the dragon said, heaving a sigh in disappointment. "I bet you have no actual idea how precious it truly is!" the dragon stated lastly.</p>
