<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>This lion's roar originated from the vicious nature of the Cloud-chasing Lion's bone.</p>

  <p>Even a creature like a flood dragon that was close to a legendary beast could preserve its vicious nature in its bones for a long time. And here, the Cloud-chasing Lion was a genuine legendary beast. It was a close relative of another powerful super legendary beast, the kylin.</p>

  <p>When Zheng's forceful energy entered the bone, it activated the vicious nature within it.</p>

  <p>Just as the lion's roar burst out, Zheng circulated his life vitality to wrap around the bone, suppressing the vicious nature within.</p>

  <p>Even though he had forcefully suppressed the sound of the lion's roar by ninety-nine percent, there was still a weak sound that could be heard.</p>

  <p>The several hundred people surrounding Zheng looked at each other, ashen-faced. Those with weaker physiques trembled as their legs gave way and they fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>Zheng heaved a sigh of relief. If the vicious nature of this bone had really erupted, then none of the surrounding commoners would have survived.</p>

  <p>After he soaked the bone in the forceful energy, Zheng began to refine the bone, continuously absorbing the essence within it.</p>

  <p>Zheng had to form Eight Path Platforms within his body. He was now using the essence within this bone to forge the Hundred Meetings Platform.</p>

  <p>A milky white mist appeared between his eyebrows as he continued to absorb the little bits of essence of the bone. One could faintly see a platform slowly forming within the white mist.</p>

  <p>Even after absorbing the entire bone, the Hundred Meetings Platform still hadn't been built between his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>Forming Eight Path Platforms was a difficult threshold for body refiners. It wouldn't be easy even if Zheng used the legendary beast's bone.</p>

  <p>One bone wasn't enough. Zheng took out another bone from his space ring.</p>

  <p>This time, he was much more careful and wrapped his life vitality around it to prevent the vicious nature of the Cloud-chasing Lion from leaking out.</p>

  <p>As Zheng refined the legendary beast's bones, the mist on his Hundred Meetings Platform gradually dissipated. If he were to close his eyes and look inside, he would see a white Path Platform standing there.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the forceful energy, which was originally evenly distributed throughout his body, began to slowly gather at the Hundred Meetings Platform and circulate at a uniform speed.</p>

  <p>The Hundred Meetings Platform was the foundation of the Eight Path Platforms. After forming the Hundred Meetings Platform, the speed of producing the forceful energy would multiply, and each of the Eight Path Platforms in the body refiner's body would have its own use. Once all the Eight Path Platforms were activated, a body refiner would be able to clash with a warrior at the Life and Death Realm just by relying on the might of the forceful energy.</p>

  <p>This was only for ordinary body refiners. As for Zheng, whose body was now a top-grade fairy weapon, his power was unimaginable as his forceful energy pulsed.</p>

  <p>During this process, Zheng had already traveled quite some distance while sitting on the cart.</p>

  <p>The scenery of this continent was completely different from that of the Central Region. It was pitch black everywhere, once they had left the pasture. The soil, mountains, and plants were all steeped in darkness, giving off an eerie feeling.</p>

  <p>Zheng was surprised that they did not encounter a single ogre or even a single living creature on the way.</p>

  <p>But the quieter it was, the more likely it was that danger was lurking in the shadows. Zheng understood this. He could even vaguely sense that there was more than one living creature spying on them from the shadows, and that they came from all directions.</p>

  <p>Zheng's soul had become sensitive after it had entered the Fighting Soul Realm. He wouldn't have been able to sense these prying eyes in the past.</p>

  <p>'What exactly is going on? Even if the ogres are spying on us, why didn't they make a move?' The doubt in Zheng's heart grew.</p>

  <p>However, this was his first time visiting this continent. He was not familiar with this place and did not know much about the powers on this continent.</p>

  <p>And because of this, he could only bring this group of people to wander around.</p>

  <p>What Zheng didn't know was that the powers that were spying on him were also puzzled.</p>

  <p>And this was because the place where Zheng had arrived through the long-distance transmission array was very complicated.</p>

  <p>This was the northeast corner of the chaotic continent, called the Heavenly Eagle Prairie. This was originally a fertile piece of land, and humans had settled here ten thousand years ago. However, humans didn't rule the chaotic continent. Until now, they had been at a stage where hundreds of races were competing with each other for absolute hegemony. The disputes between various races were chaotic and too many.</p>

  <p>Five thousand years ago, the ogres had started a war and destroyed the civilization that mankind had built. In the present, this area was torn apart by three forces, humans, Demon Nights and ogres.</p>

  <p>After thousands of years of fighting, the three races were unwilling to give up on each other. In the end, they had set up their own bases and guarded them with all their might, creating a delicate balance that had now led to the current situation.</p>

  <p>Zheng had brought his people to the midst of these three races.</p>

  <p>There had not been a war in the Heavenly Eagle Prairie for more than ten years because of the understanding among them. The chaos had been suppressed enough for the three great races to develop themselves around their bases.</p>

  <p>But what no one had expected was for a mysterious human to suddenly appear at the edge of the ogre's territory, in the pasture that had originally been used to raise humans. This mysterious human had, with his strength alone, massacred over a thousand ogre warriors. He had majestically led his people forward after killing an ogre governor.</p>

  <p>By the time the ogres had reacted, Zheng had already led his people into the complicated triangle.</p>

  <p>A hundred miles away from Zheng, two ogre war generals stood on top of the city walls. Both of them looked puzzled.</p>

  <p>"Where did this human kid come from?"</p>

  <p>"It is reported that he appeared suddenly in a pasture, without warning.</p>

  <p>Someone even saw a giant cloud of vitality that day. It seemed to contain the fluctuations of the space channel."</p>

  <p>"Taking away a few humans is a small matter not worth mentioning. I'm just afraid that the kid has some sort of scheme boiling within him."</p>

  <p>"Humans are weak, but they have always been cunning. I think we should stop them."</p>

  <p>"But where he is right now is too complicated. If we were to move, the humans would probably act. I'm also afraid that the Demon Night would also not be able to restrain themselves."</p>

  <p>The two ogre war generals were very hesitant, but in the end, one of them said, "Report this to the elder. That brat brings along a group of ordinary people and their speed is quite low. We still have time to consider."</p>

  <p>It would take Zheng less than five minutes to cover a hundred miles. But this group of ordinary people was slowing him down. And now, it would take several days and nights for this group of hundreds of people to move forward.</p>

  <p>Two hundred miles away from Zheng, three other humans were equally puzzled.</p>

  <p>They wore armors belonging to the generals of the army. One of them, a middle-aged man with a full beard, sat at the top of a fortress and laughed mischievously. "Where did this guy come from? He is clearly only a level seven war fighter, but he actually went to the ogre's pasture and took away several hundred people. What is he trying to do?"</p>

  <p>"Who cares if he's dead? We'll just pretend we didn't see him. It's not easy to have ten years of peace. If we were to appear, then we might have to fight," another said coldly.</p>

  <p>"No. I have to report it to my father. This matter is rather strange. We can't make a decision without authorization. No matter where that kid came from, he is a human after all." The last to speak was a youth. He was extremely handsome, had a head of silver hair, and his eyes flashed with a green light.</p>

  <p>The bearded middle-aged man shook his head. "I have to report this. But the biggest problem is that the kid is heading for the Demon Night's place."</p>

  <p>The three races were closely watching Zheng's group.</p>

  <p>On the first day, they walked forty miles.</p>

  <p>On the next day, they walked forty-five miles.</p>

  <p>On the third day, they walked thirty miles.</p>

  <p>On the fourth day, an arrow, thick as an arm, abruptly shot out from ten miles away, with a loud whistling sound.</p>

  <p>It was made from the bone of some fierce beast and extremely special runes flickered on it.</p>

  <p>The bone arrow was shot from afar. It was aimed at no one and fell to the ground before Zheng. Half of the arrow was stuck in the ground.</p>

  <p>Looking at the bone arrow in front of him, Zheng frowned and said, "Is this a warning?"</p>
