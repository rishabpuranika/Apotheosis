<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3469 Thunder Dimorphodon </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The force blasted Fuxi tens of thousands of miles away. He crashed into the western peak in the core area, and it crumbled at the impact. Fuxi tumbled down into the rubble. Meanwhile, the one-eyed bat landed at the periphery of the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>To those of the younger generations, such a battle was simply unimaginable. Even the slightest shock wave of it could kill them.</p>

  <p>However, except for Mount who was capable of traveling through spatial transference, the others had no choice but to stand still. There was no point in trying to hide themselves.</p>

  <p>The one-eyed bat rose up again, surrounded by a halo of bright white lightning. The flash of light swept across the landscape, revealing a huge space channel.</p>

  <p>It hadn't come here to fight with Fuxi.</p>

  <p>Since it had gotten what it wanted, it clearly planned to leave.</p>

  <p>In an instant, the huge bat entered the spatial channel.</p>

  <p>It disappeared into the depths of the channel, moving at an incredible speed.</p>

  <p>But at that moment, a mark of Eight Diagrams appeared high in the sky above the channel again.</p>

  <p>Fuxi, who stood on the ground, lifted his fist and made a punching motion against the sky.</p>

  <p>There was a deafening boom.</p>

  <p>The mark of Eight Diagrams suddenly exploded in the sky.</p>

  <p>To everyone's shock, the body of the giant one-eyed bat faltered, then fell out of the space channel.</p>

  <p>"It won't be that easy for you to run away," shouted Fuxi at the bat, his face full of anger.</p>

  <p>The Chaotic Source Spirits could be fused by all the races to strengthen themselves in the Source World. And yet, there was a huge mystery attached to the Chaotic Source Spirits that still hadn't been solved, even now.</p>

  <p>What was the exact nature of the Chaotic Source Spirits kept in both the Chaotic Source Sea and the Chaotic Source World?</p>

  <p>Were they the creatures of the Other Shore, or in reality? If the Chaotic Source Spirits could appear in the chaos by virtue of their own unique characteristics, then would it be possible for other powerful creatures on the Other Shore to return to the chaos by some means?</p>

  <p>These questions had piqued speculation among various races when the special characteristics of the Chaotic Source Spirits were discovered, but they had remained unsolved.</p>

  <p>But this time was different.</p>

  <p>A Dreaded Eye Demon suddenly appeared in the main peak of the Chaotic Source World, catching the attention of the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>The appearance of the Dreaded Eye Demon was completely unexpected. It was known that the Chaotic Source Spirits were able to live in chaos after they had been born. But this Dreaded Eye Demon had neither been born nor descended? it had just directly appeared in the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>It surely shocked the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>Originally, the Li Shan mountain had planned to launch explorations of the Chaotic Source World after it was closed. However, the events occurring in the Chaotic Source Sea on the Other Shore had made the situation a lot more complicated.</p>

  <p>Before Yan entered the Chaotic Source World, the Li Shan mountain had given her the silk cloth fused with the Braveness Rain to restrain that giant eye.</p>

  <p>After subduing the giant eye with the help of Luo Zheng, Yan had taken the initiative to collect it. She planned to turn it over to the Li Shan mountain for further study.</p>

  <p>The giant eye was strange indeed. But Fuxi was keenly aware that it was not the key to the problem. He supposed that the giant eye could appear in the Chaotic Source World because of the Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>So, when Luo Zheng had been digging for crystals of the Chaotic Source Spirits, Fuxi didn't interfere.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng dug out the rings of light, Fuxi wondered if they were the key to making the giant eye appear. He hadn't expected that the one-eyed bat would show up suddenly and take the rings away.</p>

  <p>He absolutely couldn't let that happen.</p>

  <p>So Fuxi threw the one-eyed bat out of the space channel. Immediately after, he moved to the side of the one-eyed bat using Grand Teleportation.</p>

  <p>Without giving the bat a chance to recover, he hit it as hard as he could. The bat screeched and retaliated. They launched a series of ferocious attacks against each other. In the heat of the battle, they directly rushed out of the Chaotic Source World and rose high into the sky of the Icy Snow Province.</p>

  <p>The others in the core area watched as Fuxi and the one-eyed bat disappeared into the distance. As the two combatants moved further away, everyone heaved deep sighs of relief.</p>

  <p>"Unless my eyes deceived me, it was the Thunder Dimorphodon! One of the top ten ferocious beasts of the ancient times!" squeaked an Ear Mouse.</p>

  <p>It looked extremely excited.</p>

  <p>"Was it really the Thunder Dimorphodon? I've only ever seen it in illustrations..."</p>

  <p>"Of course it was! How could an ordinary beast withstand the palm of the Human Sovereign? Only a beast such as the Thunder Dimorphodon could bear it!"</p>

  <p>At that statement, traces of fear reappeared on the faces of the members of the various races. If it had truly been the Thunder Dimorphodon, then they had just encountered one of the top ten ferocious beasts in history, not long after they had just barely escaped the previous devastating disaster. What a unique experience this trip had been!</p>

  <p>"Where is Luo Zheng?" Feng Ge asked, looking quickly around.</p>

  <p>Previously, Luo Zheng and the Evil God had both demonstrated their ability to use the Inheritance of World. After the pure energy entity had been exterminated, it seemed that the wielder wouldn't die.</p>

  <p>At least the Evil God was still alive, though his body had shrunk into the size of a baby under the attacks of Luo Zheng. However, Feng Ge was still slightly worried. Yan, Dorothy, Sally and the others were also looking around for any sign of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>At that point, there was a flash from the Green Jade World. Out of nowhere, a crack appeared and widened in the ground.</p>

  <p>A bang sounded.</p>

  <p>To their shock, Luo Zheng bounced out of the crack. His body curved through the air and he landed on his feet.</p>

  <p>Everyone's eyes were wide at his sudden reappearance. There were also many exhalations of relief, for they were glad that Luo Zheng was safe and sound.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't pay any attention to anyone else for the moment. Instead, he looked up. Beyond the sky of the Chaotic Source World, the faint figures of Fuxi and the one-eyed bat were still visible as they battled with each other.</p>

  <p>The sound of their fight reverberated across the distance like the rumblings of far-off thunder.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng could only stand and watch the ferocity of the confrontation. He knew that the most important thing now for him was to distribute the Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had collected all those golden red crystals, but he was a little upset that he couldn't get any of the rings.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, just outside the Icy Snow Province, the lone Black Ship floated in the air.</p>

  <p>Shera sat on the deck, wearing a long, flowing black dress. A small bottle had been placed in front of her. The bottle was shrouded in a cloud of black mist, with a blurry figure visible inside.</p>

  <p>She stared fixedly at the figure in the bottle. Her eyes were red and hooded in her snow white face. Frowning, she murmured to herself, "How could he fail? The captain had foretold that he would encounter a disaster, but he shouldn't have died."</p>

  <p>A cold voice spoke up behind Shera. "The Evil God is indeed alive."</p>

  <p>The person who had spoken was exuding a brass light. He had a strange appearance, like he had been dipped and coated with molten brass. Even his voice had a metallic aura.</p>

  <p>"He lost and was collected by his former master. How is that any different from death?" Shera snapped furiously.</p>

  <p>If not for her fear of Fuxi, she would have entered the Icy Snow Province herself, to force Luo Zheng to hand the Evil God over.</p>

  <p>That brass man shook his head. "The captain said that Luo Zheng and the Evil God might be the same person..."</p>

  <p>Shera rolled her eyes. "Yes, of course, the creatures born in the inner world surely belong to the owner of that world. But after they leave the inner world, they will separate. Is there any need to remind me of this?"</p>

  <p>The inner world was formed by consciousness. Thus, the owner of the inner world was the ruler controlling everything within it.</p>

  <p>"No, you misunderstood it," said the man, shaking his head. "Do you still remember Usman?"</p>

  <p>As soon as the name Usman was mentioned, Shera's face went blank, but her eyes darkened. It had all happened a very long time ago. Why was the brass man bringing him up now?</p>
