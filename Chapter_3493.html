  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess gasped. She had never seen something like this happen before.</p>

  <p>If she used this golden red crystal to forge a body protection weapon, would this make her practically invincible?</p>

  <p>Her tender fingers gently caressed the crystal. Then, from her fingertips burst out five thousand divine megatons of force.</p>

  <p>"Click!"</p>

  <p>With a crisp sound, the crystal had broken into two halves.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess and Fuxi frowned. Both were evidently perplexed.</p>

  <p>"That's weird. This crystal couldn't take the power exerted on it, yet it can avoid the attack of energy... How is that helpful?" The Snake Goddess furrowed her brows, puzzled.</p>

  <p>Staring at the two pieces of the golden red crystal, Fuxi shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Maybe this is not for body refining."</p>

  <p>"You mean it has something to do with descending?" The Snake Goddess's eyes flashed with understanding. "Yes, this is possible..."</p>

  <p>"Zheng has a lot of these crystals. Do you want to take them back first?" Fuxi asked.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess shook her head. "Let him keep them first. Our most pressing issue is the loss of the Descending Rings to the Thunder Dimorphodon."</p>

  <p>At the mention of the Thunder Dimorphodon, Fuxi's eyes flashed with a hint of killing intent.</p>

  <p>While the top ten ancient beasts were quite famous for their strength and prowess, Fuxi was confident he could kill the Thunder Dimorphodon, given the chance.</p>

  <p>Because the Thunder Dimorphodon had dared to steal the rings right under his nose, Fuxi vowed to never let it go unpunished.</p>

  <p>After staying at the Pear Hill for seven days, the flying ships of the Oneness Sky Palace finally left.</p>

  <p>In case of any emergency, the Pear Hill sent two masters to escort the flying ships back to the Bloom Divine Province.</p>

  <p>After the seven flying ships arrived at the Bloom Divine Province, Zheng took the time to rest well at the Flow Sword Sect.</p>

  <p>Sally, Hutton and other members of the Nine Li race were also arranged to stay at the Flow Sword Sect as they waited for Ambrose.</p>

  <p>Happy her husband finally returned, Yudie pounced into his arms. She stayed by his side to hear him talk about what he'd just been through at the Chaotic Source World. When Zheng got to the part about the fight with the Evil God, she felt her heart pump faster.</p>

  <p>She never expected that the man that had been kneeling before Zheng in his inner world would have caused so much trouble.</p>

  <p>Margaret wrinkled her nose at Zheng's story. "He is such an ungrateful fellow!</p>

  <p>Why don't you just kill him?"</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled, but said nothing.</p>

  <p>The Evil God had gotten involved with too many things. Zheng needed more time to figure out how to deal with him.</p>

  <p>Upon the return of Zheng, Milo and others, the other disciples of the Flow Sword Sect looked at them with a new light.</p>

  <p>According to the rules of the Oneness Sky Palace, any member who had reached the Chaotic Source Realm was no longer an ordinary disciple, but was considered a member of the Land of Sword Grief.</p>

  <p>They differed from the ordinary disciples, from cultivation base to identity.</p>

  <p>In the past few days, Zheng hadn't gone to the Other Shore. Instead, he kept throwing divine crystals into the Civilization Artifact and called out several Regal Jade statues to temper himself.</p>

  <p>The Truth of Godly Way, glowing with golden light, integrated with his body in continuous refinement. The spots of light from the Chaotic Source Spirits were constantly nourished thanks to this. Consequently, these spots of light grew at an astonishing speed.</p>

  <p>Just like Zheng, other warriors at the Chaotic Source Realm also tried to strengthen the light spots within their bodies. However, the only effective method to strengthen the Chaotic Source Spirits was continuous import of the Other Shore Power.</p>

  <p>This was a slow and time-consuming process. It usually took a warrior years of efforts to gain some progress. No one's speed could compare to Zheng's.</p>

  <p>A few days later, this group of disciples who just reached the Chaotic Source Realm gathered at the junction of the Origin Mountain and Oneness Mountain.</p>

  <p>In front of the junction was a huge, bronze palace, consisting of three floors.</p>

  <p>The terrace on the first floor of the palace was filled with disciples from the Land of Sword Grief, who were at the Chaotic Source Realm.</p>

  <p>The Chaotic Source Realm was an extremely crucial threshold, and only after passing through it would one be able to go any further.</p>

  <p>The backbone of any great sect, great force, or any clan was made up of strong warriors at the Chaotic Source Realm. Super forces like the Oneness Sky Palace focused on training such warriors.</p>

  <p>For example, the Bearing race would send all its members at the Chaotic Source Realm to the Sky Guard Pavilion. As for the Oneness Sky Palace, it was the Land of Sword Grief.</p>

  <p>The disciples standing in the bronze palace turned to glance at the group who had just reached the Chaotic Source Realm.</p>

  <p>"The Land of Sword Grief will receive its new members today," said a long haired man, who was standing on the first floor of the bronze palace.</p>

  <p>"We'll need to share some resources from the Land of Sword Grief with them, alas!" A fat man beside the long-haired man sighed loudly.</p>

  <p>"They are just new comers. How many resources can they take?" a short middle-aged man whined.</p>

  <p>Most of the cultivators in the bronze palace had reached the Chaotic Source Realm years ago.</p>

  <p>They were not strong enough like Athemar, so most of them were still cultivating in the Land of Sword Grief.</p>

  <p>Upon the group's return from the Chaotic Source World, Athemar had ordered these disciples to keep their mouths shut about what had taken place in the Chaotic Source World -- especially the fact that Zheng had the Soaring Snake Sword.</p>

  <p>Although many leaders from those great races had clearly seen Zheng wield the Soaring Snake Sword, Athemar wanted to at least keep it from the rest of the Oneness Sky Palace. This was for Zheng's own safety.</p>

  <p>This would explain why the disciples in the Land of Sword Grief had no idea what had happened in the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>After all the disciples who just reached the Chaotic Source Realm made it to the bronze palace, three people emerged from its massive bronze gates.</p>

  <p>The leader of the group was the long-haired man, with a long sword strapped to his back. His eyes flashed fiercely.</p>

  <p>The long-haired man looked like a serious fellow. With a curt bow, he said,</p>

  <p>"Congratulations! All of you have made it to the Chaotic Source Realm, and are thus members of our Land of Sword Grief."</p>

  <p>The crowd all bowed respectfully to the man.</p>

  <p>"My name is Abdul Fang, from the Bright Mountain."</p>

  <p>"Nice to meet you, Abdul."</p>

  <p>"I have heard a lot about you..."</p>

  <p>…</p>

  <p>The ones who whispered amongst themselves were actually from the Bright Mountain. Though Abdul Fang ranked at the bottom among the members from the Land of Sword Grief, he was quite famous back in the Bright Mountain.</p>

  <p>Abdul Fang just nodded slightly at them, remaining serious-faced.</p>

  <p>"However, you should know that before joining the Land of Sword Grief, each of you need to confirm your rankings."</p>

  <p>While most of the disciples from the Oneness Sky Palace were aware of the rules of the Land of Sword Grief, Zheng blinked confusedly.</p>

  <p>"Sorry. What do you mean by that?" Zheng asked innocently.</p>

  <p>Abdul Fang cast a cold glare at Zheng, a trace of contempt born in his heart.</p>

  <p>Judging from Zheng's white clothes, he figured he must be from the Flow Sword Sect. 'How can this kid know nothing about the rules of our Land of Sword Grief?'</p>
