  <p>
</p>

  <p>Everyone's collective gaze was focused on Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Dillon's question was also what everyone was most concerned about.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had said that they could have the help of the powerful warriors of the Soul Sea Realm. But they were nowhere to be seen. Where were they?</p>

  <p>There were many hermits in the Central Region who never ventured into active society. Even the World Commercial Alliance knew little about some of them. It was said that there were even two or three Life and Death Realm warriors among them. But who they were, no one knew.</p>

  <p>However, there were no powerful warriors of the Soul Sea Realm among the hermits.</p>

  <p>Where would Luo Luo Zheng get the Soul Sea Realm warriors from?</p>

  <p>"Master Shi, I will give you the answer in seven days. Please be patient,"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng said, folding his hands respectfully.</p>

  <p>Dillon nodded. He believed in Luo Luo Zheng the most. Moreover, Luo Luo Zheng had no reason to lie; it would not benefit him in any way. Moreover, the powerful masters of the York Divine Kingdom were targeting Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>As to the others, they were still somewhat skeptical about what Luo Luo Zheng was saying. Seven days would pass by very quickly and soon enough, they would know whether or not Luo Zheng's words were true.</p>

  <p>Hanson had originally followed Luo Luo Zheng here, greedily hoping for rewards. But when he heard talks about the powerful warriors at the Soul Sea Realm, he suddenly felt dizzy and confused.</p>

  <p>However this meeting hall was full of warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm. A mere nature creature like him would tremble in the face of any one of them. He didn't dare to interrupt.</p>

  <p>Sensing the lull in the conversation, he said in a low voice, "Well, about my reward?" and the voice trailed off.</p>

  <p>Dillon looked coldly at Hanson and then ordered someone beside him to take Hanson to get the supreme life vitality crystals.</p>

  <p>Hanson didn't dare ask Luo Luo Zheng about joining the Cloud Hall, but he was smart enough to understand the situation. Since Luo Luo Zheng had agreed to it, Hanson believed that he would keep his promise. So he thought that he could go to the Cloud Hall once he had obtained a thousand supreme life vitality crystals. Once he told them that Luo Luo Zheng had promised him about letting him join the Cloud Hall, the Cloud Hall couldn't refuse him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng summoned Xun once he returned to the Heavenly Stellar Palace.</p>

  <p>Xun had been hiding within Luo Zheng's body all this time, so she knew why Luo Luo Zheng had summoned her.</p>

  <p>When they had left the Sea God Continent, Amber had connected a message rune to Xun's statue.</p>

  <p>Since Xun's soul was too weak, she was unable to communicate with the Demon Night's sacred land through the statue like the other queens did.</p>

  <p>However, with the special message rune connected to the queen's statue, she knew that it would work.</p>

  <p>Once Luo Luo Zheng ignited the message rune, Xun closed her eyes. Her eyelashes trembled as she entered a different state of mind.</p>

  <p>Tens of thousands of miles away, the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place stood on the Sea God Continent across the endless sea.</p>

  <p>The members of the Demon Night from the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place had a routine that consisted of worshiping at the supreme queens' statues every day.</p>

  <p>To them, the statues of the queens were like a spiritual totem.</p>

  <p>Amber led the members of the Demon Night to piously kneel in front of the statues. This ceremony of worship would last for about a quarter of an hour, and they never missed it.</p>

  <p>As they worshiped the statues, the third queen's statue lit up, a message rune burning in the air. The statue of the Queen of Killings seemed to have a voice of her own as it resounded across the worshipers.</p>

  <p>"Amber," Xun said. Although she presented an image of being extremely clever and nimble before Luo Luo Zheng, she was still the dignified and supreme queen who ruled over the members of the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>Her voice sent the members of the Demon Night into shock. But they recovered soon enough to beam with joy.</p>

  <p>"Queen!"</p>

  <p>Amber exclaimed excitedly as she knelt down on one knee.</p>

  <p>"I need you," Xun said without preamble.</p>

  <p>"I'm at your service, queen. I will arrive as soon as I can!" Amber said without hesitation. There was no doubt in her mind as to what she must do.</p>

  <p>Every member of the Demon Night would unconditionally obey their queen.</p>

  <p>"Have you considered what could happen to the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place if you leave?" Xun asked, her voice laced with a layer of sternness. "And what will happen to the Purple Heart Sacred Place?" she continued.</p>

  <p>The Sea God Continent wasn't as stable as they had imagined. If Amber left the Sea God Continent, the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place would probably be ready to make a move against them. It would be the best time for them to counterattack.</p>

  <p>However, the Demon Night regarded serving the queen as their highest honor. In comparison, their own sacred land was not of priority to them.</p>

  <p>Xun could understand what Amber was thinking. So she said, "There's no need for you to come, Amber. You have to guard the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place. I only need the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place and Purple Heart Sacred Place to send a few powerful masters who are at the Soul Sea Realm."</p>

  <p>A hint of disappointment appeared in Amber's eyes.</p>

  <p>But how could she disobey the queen's direct order? She couldn't. She could only acquiesce.</p>

  <p>Xun then instructed them about how to get to the Oracle City after they went through the transmission array.</p>

  <p>After Xun was done talking, Amber stood up suddenly. She turned around, her back facing the three queens' statues and looked around at the members of the Demon Night and then called out, "Who is willing to go through the transmission array and head to the Central Region to serve our queen?"</p>

  <p>To Amber, serving Xun was a supreme honor, and she knew that the other members of the Demon Night felt the exact same way.</p>

  <p>"Amber! I'm willing to go!" a powerful warrior at the Soul Sea Realm of the Demon Night called out.</p>

  <p>"'Me too," said another woman in black.</p>

  <p>"Amber, give me a chance to serve the queen!"</p>

  <p>"Amber..."</p>

  <p>Among the many sacred places of the Sea God Continent, the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place had the largest number of Soul Sea Realm masters.</p>

  <p>There were seven powerful masters at the Soul Sea Realm in the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place and Amber was one of the top masters of the Soul Sea Realm. In the Purple Heart Sacred Place that belonged to the human race, there were only three powerful masters who were at the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>Now that Amber had asked, all the powerful masters of the Soul Sea Realm were willing to go.</p>

  <p>There were also many masters of the Life and Death Realm who wanted to go along with the other six mighty warriors of the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>Warriors at the Life and Death Realm were considered top-level masters within the Central Region, but in the Sea God Continent, there were a large number of them.</p>

  <p>Amber thought about it for a moment. Xun had only asked her not to leave the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place. But that did not mean that those warriors at the Life and Death Realm couldn't go. There was no limit to the number of people she could send out. Since the war sages of the sacred place were willing to go, she had no reason to refuse them.</p>

  <p>So Amber nodded, "Other than you, there are also people from the Purple Heart Sacred Place who will be going with you."</p>

  <p>These two sacred lands were extremely efficient. In less than a day's time, a large group of warriors had already set off for the Heavenly Eagle Prairie.</p>

  <p>The Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place had already received news of the unusual movements of the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place and the Purple Heart Sacred Place. But since Amber had stayed back in the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place, the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place didn't dare act rashly. It would have been different if Amber had left. Though these two sacred places could not fight against the war sages that had broken through in the Tower of Sin, they could still directly attack their sacred places. The elders of the ogres were very ambitious and they wouldn't miss a single chance to regain their power.</p>

  <p>This was also why Xun had rejected Amber.</p>

  <p>Three days later, in the sky above the Chaotic Ocean of Stars that was on the east of the Central Region, a huge space windstorm suddenly whirled into existence.</p>

  <p>An enormous transmission array appeared in the air.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack! The space storm roared.</p>

  <p>Such a massive space windstorm could crush ordinary martial artists to pieces.</p>

  <p>But within this space windstorm was a squad of over a hundred warriors who seemed to have completely ignored the windstorm and forcefully rushed out of the transmission array.</p>

  <p>The group consisted of over a hundred warriors and was led by nine powerful warriors of the Soul Sea Realm. Everyone else were powerful war sages.</p>

  <p>"This is the Central Region? Luo Zheng's hometown?" As Miguel glanced down at the distant coastline of the continent, he didn't know what to feel.</p>

  <p>Before Luo Luo Zheng had come to the Sea God Continent, the humans of the Purple Heart Sacred Place had always been like orphans, grabbing on to a corner on the Sea God Continent to survive. He hadn't thought that the continent that Luo Luo Zheng had lived on would be completely ruled by humans.</p>

  <p>"Let's go," a powerful Soul Sea Realm master from the Demon Night said after she had looked over the place. She didn't feel the same way as Miguel did. Their only motive that had driven the members of the Demon Night to come here was to serve their queen.</p>

  <p>And so, this group of over a hundred martial artists began to charge forward.</p>

  <p>"S-Sir, something terrible has happened!" A scream rent the air from the direction of the Fish Dragon Sect that was located in the outermost region of the Central Region.</p>

  <p>"What are you panicking about?" When Master Xiao, who was the leader of the Fish Dragon Sect heard the scream, his face darkened as he shouted at the person who had spoken, "When we cultivate our warrior spirit, the most important thing is to stay calm. Panic will not help you achieve anything!"</p>

  <p>Master Xiao fumed, his cleverness and sophistication coming to the fore.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Evil Sect had ravaged half of the Central Region, and many of the third grade forces were destroyed. However, the Fish Dragon Sect managed to survive without much damage.</p>
