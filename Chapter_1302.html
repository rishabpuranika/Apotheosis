<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1302 Life Vitality Jade (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Everyone was silent for a while after hearing that. They had to face reality. And the harsh and bitter reality was that although every single one of them was at the Soul Sea Realm, they had no choice but to bow their heads since they were in someone else's territory now.</p>

  <p>After a few moments of silence, one of the warriors suddenly walked out and asked, "So if I pay a million supreme life vitality crystals, then I'll be exempted from service?"</p>

  <p>The armored man replied, "Kind of. It's not that you will be exempted from service. The very purpose of the service is to mine for life vitality crystals! If you can pay up enough life vitality crystals, you can leave at any time!"</p>

  <p>To everyone's shock, as soon as the armored man finished his words, the warrior took off the space ring from his finger. He gently tapped it, and hundreds of thousands of life vitality crystals piled up on the ground like a small hill in front of the audience's eyes!</p>

  <p>They were glittering like diamond and translucent and pure in texture.</p>

  <p>The vitality of the heavens and the earth contained within them was extremely rich and powerful. Anyone could tell that these were all supreme life vitality crystals!</p>

  <p>Although several of the newcomers had seen a great deal of wealth in their life, when they saw this small mountain of supreme life vitality crystals in front of them, their hearts began to thump wildly.</p>

  <p>"Here are a million supreme life vitality crystals. Can I leave now?" the warrior asked.</p>

  <p>The armored man nodded in satisfaction, but then shook his head and answered in the negative, "If you want to join the Spiritual Force Sacred Place, one million supreme life vitality crystals are enough to serve the purpose. But if you wish to become an independent martial artist and leave our Spiritual Force Sacred Place or the Spirit Reading World, you will need to hand in two million supreme life vitality crystals!"</p>

  <p>The warrior frowned. For a moment he seemed to hesitate, but then, he took out another space ring. With a gentle wave of his hand, another small mountain of supreme life vitality crystals appeared in front of the armored man!</p>

  <p>"Damn, this guy? He's super rich!"</p>

  <p>"Look! He just took out two million supreme life vitality crystals without even batting an eye. Where is he from?"</p>

  <p>"Well. There are some great worlds which are indeed fabulously wealthy.</p>

  <p>I heard that in the great world neighboring my own, there is a giant mineral vein of life vitality crystals running through the entire place. In fact, people over there are so rich in terms of life vitality crystals that the crystals have lost their value. In that world, they don't serve as a currency anymore!"</p>

  <p>With so many supreme life vitality crystals piled up on the ground, the armored man seemed to have run out of things to say. What surprised the audience beyond anything was that the warrior wasn't done. He soon dumped even more life vitality crystals from his space ring in front of the armored man, which formed themselves into two other small hills. He pointed at another martial artist behind him and said, "These are for my brother. He will come with me."</p>

  <p>Seeing the four piles of supreme life vitality crystals, the armored man picked one of them and held it in his hand. Satisfied, he chuckled and said, "Of course, you two can go now! This supreme world is vast, and you can go wherever you want!"</p>

  <p>The two warriors nodded, and then left the place under the guidance of the other armored man.</p>

  <p>As the rest of them watched the two warriors leave, then besides feeling envy, they could only sigh under their lips. It wasn't that they were all poor. In fact, some of them were even richer than the warrior who had just left. But not many people would have thought of taking so many supreme life vitality crystals with them to the Upper World.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng shook his head slightly in regret. When he had been in the four divine kingdoms, he had collected a great number of supreme life vitality crystals. However, he had left a large portion of them in the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>Thinking about it, he remembered that he had only brought about two hundred thousand supreme life vitality crystals with him to the Upper World. They were far from enough.</p>

  <p>When he thought about it, he suddenly remembered that he had numerous valuable things with him, such as the Black Star mining pickaxe. This supreme divine weapon was worth quite a bit of money.</p>

  <p>However, even if someone offered him over hundreds of millions of supreme life vitality crystals to buy it, Luo Luo Zheng would never be willing to sell such a valuable thing.</p>

  <p>No. He would not sell it in any case. And since he didn't have enough life vitality crystals with him, he would have to mine for them?</p>

  <p>The life vitality jade which the armored man had mentioned just now had piqued Luo Zheng's interest. The former had said that the jade was much more valuable and he only needed a hundred life vitality jades to earn his freedom. The questions was, could Luo Luo Zheng dig out any of these life vitality jades from this dark and steep mountain range in front of him?</p>

  <p>Under the lead of the armored men, the warriors arrived at a gathering place. The chances of escape were zero since several Spirit Supreme Realm masters were scattered around to guard the place.</p>

  <p>Not far ahead, several martial artists seemed to have just flown in with pickaxes on their backs. After handing over all the life vitality crystals they had dug up, they got the count of crystals handed over recorded and then flew back. They went back and forth like this, digging for life vitality crystal in the mines, trying to be free as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>When the newcomers entered the gathering place, they also received their mining picks and tokens according to the rules.</p>

  <p>Although everyone was reluctant to go for the mining, they still had hopes that they would leave here soon. They had the same thoughts as Luo Luo Zheng. Since only one hundred life vitality jades were needed to get them out of this place, their goal, therefore, was to dig out one hundred life vitality jades as fast as they could.</p>
