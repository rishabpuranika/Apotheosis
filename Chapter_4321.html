<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Edna," the Evil God called his wife.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong, honey?" his wife responded softly.</p>

  <p>She smiled faintly and batted her long lashes. Her beauty could've made any man weak.</p>

  <p>"Do you remember what I told you before?" the Evil God asked. "That when everything is settled, we would live in seclusion?"</p>

  <p>Edna nodded. "Yes. I remember how you liked to live in seclusion back when we were in the inner world of the creator. We— "</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Before she could even finish her sentence, the Evil God grabbed her by the neck, flames spurting out from his hands.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the flesh and muscle were incinerated, leaving only her ghastly white bones. The bones hissed under the heat of the flames and trembled violently.</p>

  <p>"Humph! Break!" the Evil God shouted, his voice filled with rage.</p>

  <p>Flashes of lightning burst forth from his eyes.</p>

  <p>Everything the lightning touched was sliced into pieces.</p>

  <p>The unique courtyard...</p>

  <p>The blue sky, the earth, the city...</p>

  <p>Everything in this world started to collapse, revealing a translucent egg membrane. From within, the Evil God caught sight of Zheng standing outside.</p>

  <p>"You attempted to trap me in an illusion?" the Evil God spat coldly.</p>

  <p>Zheng raised his eyebrows curiously. "He's found out the truth. We've failed."</p>

  <p>This had been Clarence's plan.</p>

  <p>No matter how high the level of energy was, it was still easy for one to fall into an illusion. This was the same strategy the downgrader had used to trap Zheng with the Soul Extreme Form previously.</p>

  <p>In all their battles, Clarence had always created a huge illusion to suppress the downgrader.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, they had underestimated the Evil God. His instinct was extremely keen.</p>

  <p>Having grown up in cruelty, he had absorbed all the negative emotions in Zheng's inner world.</p>

  <p>It was unsurprising he had become a cold-blooded killer.</p>

  <p>This pleasant world didn't align with things he was familiar with, so he saw through the deception quite easily.</p>

  <p>The illusion might've only lasted for a moment, but it was enough to place the Evil God in an extremely dangerous position. Every hair on his body stood up.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!" the Evil God roared, suddenly stretching out his hand to grab at Zheng.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, Zheng managed to retreat backwards more than ten thousand feet. However, to his surprise, the Evil God's arm closed that distance swiftly, grabbing him by the neck.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>A powerful force of space was applied to the two of them, and the next moment, they arrived above the Wall World. The Evil God ruthlessly pressed Zheng towards the Wall World.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>The instant Zheng's feet touched the Wall World, they were downgraded, shattering into thin slivers of blood.</p>

  <p>Then his legs, abdomen, and chest suffered the same fate as these parts connected with the Wall World.</p>

  <p>Seeing that his entire body was being pressed into the Wall World, Zheng struggled to shift to the side, grabbing the Evil God by his shoulders.</p>

  <p>Gritting his teeth, Zheng twisted what was left of his body, dragging the Evil God into the Wall World.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>Because the Evil God's body had been strengthened by the Frequency energy, the process of downgrading was even more intense. An ear-piercing sound erupted and sparks shot out as his body was downgraded.</p>

  <p>In a matter of mere seconds, only the Evil God's head remained of his body.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The energy of the Creation Coke roared to life once again.</p>

  <p>Just in the nick of time, the Evil God's body began to grow from the top of his head. A neck, then his body, arms, and legs sprouted from his scalp like strange plants.</p>

  <p>As soon as his arm was developed, he threw a punch at Zheng's chest. It was powerful enough to fling Zheng backwards, away from the Evil God.</p>

  <p>Having gotten rid of Zheng's grasp, the Evil God was finally able to gather his bearings. Firmly clasping his head from both sides, he gently pulled his head off and straightened it before planting it firmly back on his neck.</p>

  <p>Zheng also took this opportunity to recover his missing lower body.</p>

  <p>"Great!</p>

  <p>You truly are worthy of being my nemesis!</p>

  <p>Again!"</p>

  <p>The eyes of the Evil God flashed viciously, like a hungry beast eyeing its prey.</p>

  <p>After leaving Zheng's inner world, the Evil God was faced with even more challenging worlds. In the Source World and the chaos, he had encountered all sorts of opponents, but no one had come close to being as difficult to deal with as Zheng.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of the Evil God, only Zheng was strong enough to be his opponent. Even the downgrader and Clarence weren't worthy.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, the Evil God pounced on Zheng once more.</p>

  <p>Zheng gritted his teeth as the Evil God approached, making no attempt to dodge. He knew that this was a difficult battle he couldn't run away from.</p>

  <p>If the Evil God was his other self, then he had no choice but to deal with him now.</p>

  <p>Just as the Evil God was about to collide into him, Zheng leapt upwards. His body drew an arc in the air, until he kicked the Evil God, sending him straight towards the Wall World.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>One of the Evil God's legs was downgraded upon impact, but he'd managed to grab onto Zheng's foot, dragging Zheng along with him.</p>

  <p>The two of them seemed to be fighting hand to hand on a vast snow plain, and anything that touched the line of snow would disappear.</p>

  <p>However, whenever they escaped from the line, their bodies would recover instantly.</p>

  <p>It all happened so fast. Anyone watching from afar wouldn't have been able to tell that they were ever injured.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>Zheng and the Evil God rolled and crawled along the surface of the Wall World.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, the right half of Zheng's body completely disappeared, leaving only the other half. On the other hand, the upper half of the Evil God's body was downgraded, leaving only his legs and the lower half of his body. At some point, only half of Zheng's skull was left, whereas what was left of the Evil God was just a finger.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the two of them had become too strong that even their physical bodies couldn't restrain them, and even their cinnabar fields no longer existed. Consequently, as long as a part of their bodies was still alive, they could recover in an instant.</p>

  <p>As they continued to fight each other head on, the downgrader watched quietly from within the black light.</p>

  <p>He never would've imagined that the battle would be so fierce; it never occurred to him either that they would use the Wall World as a weapon.</p>

  <p>Initially, the downgrader had no intention of joining this battle. After all, the downgrading had just begun. He only needed to sit this out patiently.</p>

  <p>However, as he watched the two of them roll back and forth on the Wall World, he began to feel as though they weren't taking the downgrading seriously.</p>

  <p>"Since you two are so intent on killing each other, why don't you just die together?"</p>

  <p>The downgrader decided to take this as an opportunity to strike, suddenly appearing above the two of them. The Extreme Form energy that had been stored for a long time suddenly exploded.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The downgrader initially thought that this would be enough to push both of them into the Wall World.</p>

  <p>However, when he had released the Extreme Form energy, the two barely even flinched.</p>

  <p>While it might've looked like they were fighting hand-to-hand, they were in fact using the Creation Coke and the Annihilation Coke alternatively.</p>

  <p>Moreover, they had the strongest bodies and the most destructive power.</p>

  <p>The Extreme Form energy simply paled in comparison.</p>

  <p>"Fuck off!"</p>

  <p>The Evil God threw a punch in his direction without even looking, and the once arrogant downgrader was blasted away instantly.</p>

  <p>Zheng somersaulted in the air, simultaneously activating the Cube energy.</p>

  <p id="top_31">As he pointed at what remained of the downgrader's body, the Cube energy enveloped the fragments and sent them to oblivion. Without batting an eyelash, the two managed to kill the downgrader before he even had the chance to strike.</p>

  <p>Without pausing to take a breath, Zheng and the Evil God continued to fight each other fiercely.</p>
