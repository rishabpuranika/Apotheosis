  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng stepped into the passageway that seemed like a rainbow. A gentle fragrance went up his nose.</p>

  <p>As far as he could see, a colorful world was right in front of him.</p>

  <p>"Is this... the inside of the bone tower?" He was stunned by what he saw.</p>

  <p>When Zheng saw the interior of the Nine Li race's bone tower, he thought the place was simple and crude.</p>

  <p>The Nine Li race had halls and houses within the caves that formed naturally inside the bone tower, and the materials that they used were very simple.</p>

  <p>But in the vast cave of the Torrent Bone Tower were some emerald green plants. They were lined up in an orderly fashion and had light yellow flowers scattered around them. In the distance were mountains and waterfalls. Every structure inside seemed beautiful as if the place was from a fairytale.</p>

  <p>"He-he, of course it is." A soft chuckle rang through his ears.</p>

  <p>Not far from Zheng was a tall woman who wore a long white dress and sat on a broad chair.</p>

  <p>She had a pretty face and clear eyes that glistened with crystal lights.</p>

  <p>Both her strength and reputation had exceeded those of the other exiles by a mile.</p>

  <p>Even Timotheus who was known to be a five-star Nine Li Guard wouldn't stand a chance against this woman. It was because of her that the Snake Goddess race was able to secure the title of being the most powerful race in this world.</p>

  <p>But the woman had also hidden her aura. At a glance, one would think that she was an ordinary woman who had no experience in any cultivation of marital arts.</p>

  <p>As Zheng observed the woman closely, the woman also looked at him.</p>

  <p>"For so many years, the Nine Li race has not developed anything at all.</p>

  <p>Except for a few old freaks, the people of the younger generation are all disappointing. But this time around, you seem to have gotten your hands on a good disciple." The woman had sharp eyes and she immediately saw through Zheng's cultivation with a quick glance.</p>

  <p>She was well aware of how difficult it was to train a powerful top-rank True God in their world. The most vital thing was that Zheng seemed to have been able to comprehend two types of Truths of Godly Ways.</p>

  <p>Timotheus smiled out of embarrassment...</p>

  <p>The development of the Nine Li race in their world was indeed not as good as that of the Yellow Emperor race and the Snake Goddess race.</p>

  <p>They used to completely rely on their group of exiles to become what they were.</p>

  <p>"Well, if you are really interested in making alliances through marriage, we have a lot of good girls in our race that you might want to meet. I can arrange some meetings for the kids." The woman was very interested in Zheng so she immediately began to dwell on the topic.</p>

  <p>Zheng couldn't help but show that he was quite embarrassed.</p>

  <p>Timotheus smiled and said, "It all depends on their own decision but I honestly have something important to do here!"</p>

  <p>The woman took her eyes off Zheng and said, "Go ahead!"</p>

  <p>Every exile was extremely eager to leave this world.</p>

  <p>However, they always chose to give up after endless attempts.</p>

  <p>How could anyone ever escape from the cage built by the Chaos Ancient God?</p>

  <p>But even if their chances were very slim, they would still exert effort in trying and giving it their best.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid that we have to begin with Zheng's background. Zheng, you need to tell her this part," Timotheus told Zheng through his life vitality.</p>

  <p>The woman frowned slightly. She didn't know what was so important about the young man's origin that they needed to do it so secretly.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded slightly as he said through his chaotic energy, "I didn't come from this world. I came from the divine land."</p>

  <p>The woman was a bit confused. She tilted her head and frowned as she asked, "Where exactly is the divine land?"</p>

  <p>"The world right above your head," Zheng said.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, the woman's face was filled with shock. "Did you come from that ship?"</p>

  <p>In the woman's eyes, the world that was bound on the Torrent Bone Tower was a huge ship.</p>

  <p>She didn't expect Zheng to be from that place!</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded as a look of helplessness appeared on his face. "But this ship was bound by you. It cannot leave now..."</p>

  <p>The woman still didn't understand so she continued to ask, "You said you came from that ship then why exactly are you a member of the Nine Li race now?" she asked as she stared at Timotheus with confusion.</p>

  <p>Timotheus smiled bitterly before saying, "That ship was built by the Grand Chieftain of our race, Chiyou. Zheng is his grandson."</p>

  <p>The woman's eyebrows suddenly raised. She then looked at Zheng more closely. A strange light flashed in her very eyes as her interest in Zheng grew stronger.</p>

  <p>"It sounds like a fantasy story." The woman laughed as she shook her head. She couldn't believe what they just told her.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't care if she believed him or not. He continued, "This is not the most important thing right now. My top priority is to return to where I came from. So, the Snake Goddess race needs to release the ship!"</p>

  <p>No one ever dared to speak to her with that tone.</p>

  <p>The woman looked at Zheng with interest and walked up towards him. Her beautiful eyes glared at him. "I've exerted great efforts to tie this ship up and now you're telling me it dares to break free. If I drag it into this world, I would be able to obtain a lot of resources. Do you really think I'll be willing to let it go?"</p>

  <p>"Moreover... Even if you're really from that ship, do you think you can leave this world with your strength?" the woman added.</p>

  <p>Even if what Timotheus and Zheng had said was true, that the ship really belonged to the Nine Li race and that Zheng was a direct descendant of Chiyou, the situation would change.</p>

  <p>She wouldn't let go of the ship just because of what they tried to tell her.</p>

  <p>Zheng stared at the woman with a calm face and said, "That's why our Nine Li race is inviting you to leave this world with us. I believe that you will also make the wise choice!"</p>

  <p>For the exiles, leaving this world had always been the most important thing. At the end of the day, everything else didn't matter.</p>

  <p>"What a shameless boy! I cannot believe you have the audacity to make such remarks!" The woman's gaze went by Zheng and fell on Timotheus.</p>

  <p>The more she listened, the more she felt that Zheng's words were very absurd.</p>

  <p>However, she knew Timotheus' character very well. As a five-star Nine Li Guard, he would never bring a liar to fool her.</p>

  <p>"Please let Zheng continue," Timotheus said as he waved his hand.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't care about the woman's reaction and went on with what he was saying, "When I came into this world, I had an encounter with the Warden race."</p>

  <p>"We see them every year. Those cowards recently came to our Torrent Bone Tower themselves. This is not surprising at all," the woman replied faintly.</p>

  <p>"My experience with them was quite different," Zheng said as he shook his head.</p>

  <p>Zheng told them in detail about his encounter with Zelda and Luther.</p>

  <p>As Zheng spoke, the woman's face gradually revealed a look of doubt.</p>

  <p>Once Zheng was done speaking, the woman stared at Timotheus and said in a doubtful tone, "Timotheus, is this the opportunity you have mentioned before?"</p>

  <p>Timotheus nodded and said, "Yes. Aren't you interested in this great opportunity at all?"</p>

  <p>Zheng stared at her as he waited for her answer.</p>

  <p>The woman was the decision maker of the entire Snake Goddess race and her attitude determined everything.</p>

  <p>After a moment of contemplation, a wide smile appeared on her beautiful face. "Although what you just told me sounds like a made-up story, I think I'll give it a shot."</p>
