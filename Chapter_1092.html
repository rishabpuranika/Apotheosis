  <p>After Edwin was defeated, except for Lord Randy and the crown prince himself, not a single powerful martial artist was present to grace the history of Harlen Divine Kingdom.</p>

  <p>The first tier of the divine kingdom continent was composed of the most outstanding divine-level talents. Such talented people were extremely rare and people who could match the best of them were impossible to find.</p>

  <p>There was a huge gap between the strength of the first tier and the second tier. Even the most powerful martial artists of the second tier itself would be instantly killed by Logan alone, so it was useless to dispatch them.</p>

  <p>The crown prince, who went by the name Bram, had never witnessed Luo Zheng's strength. Back when the latter had passed the examination of the Jade Martial House, Bram was not present, but Gregory had personally informed him that an independent warrior who had appeared in the martial house possessed the qualification to be ranked at the first tier.</p>

  <p>This was a highly improbable truth and the crown prince's curiosity was aroused.</p>

  <p>Without doubt, he was in dire need of such a talent, so he rushed to Crane City. At that time, he had thought that it would be easy to win over Luo Luo Zheng since Gregory had told him that Randy had already become enemies with Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, he did not expect Randy to break in.</p>

  <p>Judging from Gregory's description, Bram only had a rough estimate of Luo Zheng's strength. He was probably almost on a par with Gregory, maybe even a bit stronger. Even if he fought, he probably wouldn't be Logan's match.</p>

  <p>However, this wasn't the crux of the problem. The key was, would Luo Luo Zheng listen to his orders? What if he asked Luo Luo Zheng to fight and Luo Luo Zheng refused? What would he do then?</p>

  <p>When Randy saw the crown prince lost in thought, a sneer rose from the corner of his mouth. He knew that it was time for him to stand out. The Harlen Divine Kingdom had just lost, and now it was time for Wind Divine Kingdom and Star Field Divine Kingdom to dispatch their martial artists. Whether or not they could challenge Logan, Randy would definitely dispatch Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The two sons of Turner were lost in their own thoughts, but more importantly, everyone's attention at the moment was focused on the Wind Divine Kingdom and the Star Field Divine Kingdom.</p>

  <p>War King Wind was wearing a huge cloak and standing on the platform at the top of the stairs. His cloak was fluttering in the wind.</p>

  <p>Till now, the Wind Divine Kingdom had not sent in a single martial artist. And from the looks of things, it seemed that War King Wind did not plan to send any martial artist to challenge Logan.</p>

  <p>Thus, everyone could sense that it was Star Field Divine Kingdom's turn now.</p>

  <p>Scott, the ruler of the Star Field Divine Kingdom chuckled slightly.</p>

  <p>"Looks like our kingdom's youths aren't strong enough to win this fight.</p>

  <p>Is there someone you would like to recommend?"</p>

  <p>He turned around and asked the crown prince as well as the other princes.</p>

  <p>In fact, as the ruler of the Star Field Divine Kingdom, he knew very well how many top-grade martial artists he had under his control. However, according to traditional practice, the ruler himself would never recommend anyone. After all, if the candidate he recommended was defeated in battle, he would be humiliated.</p>

  <p>"Your Majesty, I am willing to represent our kingdom in battle!"</p>

  <p>"I request to fight!"</p>

  <p>"Count me in!"</p>

  <p>The Star Field Divine Kingdom was the second strongest among the four divine kingdoms. There were numerous martial artists in its arsenal, and many of them were sure of themselves.</p>

  <p>Therefore, when their ruler needed them to fight, they actively volunteered themselves.</p>

  <p>Horace, the crown prince of the Star Field Divine Kingdom, swept over his team before his sight finally focused itself on Jeremy. He indifferently ordered, "Jeremy Zhao, you will fight for me!"</p>

  <p>He was very unhappy at the moment. How could his kingdom be suppressed by Logan from the York Divine Kingdom? Was the latter really invincible among Virtual Tribulation Realm martial artists? This gave him no balm.</p>

  <p>However, the sword in Logan's hand told him exactly what the cruel reality was and just how bloody it was.</p>

  <p>Jeremy Zhao had performed slightly better than Edwin of the Harlen Divine Kingdom, but he had only withstood seven strikes from Logan.</p>

  <p>After seven strikes, Jeremy also had lost an arm and dejectedly left the arena.</p>

  <p>The somber expression of War Emperor York finally relaxed. He suddenly tilted his head and smiled at Turner. "I wonder if anyone else from your kingdom can fight."</p>

  <p>There were no more than 20 to 30 martial artists from the four divine kingdoms who were able to stand in the first tier. Everyone had a list of their names.</p>

  <p>War Emperor York knew that the Harlen Divine Kingdom only had two Virtual Tribulation Realm martial artists, Gregory and Edwin. Since the two had already been defeated, the royal family members themselves would have to fight now. It was very likely that the crown prince would have to personally fight Logan.</p>

  <p>At his words, Turner's lips hardened and an angry mask shadowed his face. He thought to himself, 'This is too much! He obviously knows the answer, but he asked that question deliberately to humiliate me! He's giving me a hard time!'</p>

  <p>This match was just a review before the exploration of secret lands. It was like an appetizer. The words of War Emperor York were a bit too much.</p>

  <p>The anger on Turner's face disappeared. War Emperor York was right.</p>

  <p>He really didn't have any good ideas. Was he really going to let the crown prince fight? It was feasible, but even if the crown prince won, it wouldn't be something honorable. Losing would be even more humiliating.</p>

  <p>If he was defeated, then what qualifications would he have left to be allowed to succeed the throne?</p>

  <p>Therefore, Turner had to think prudently before he appointed the crown prince to fight.</p>

  <p>Just then, the Holy Maiden of the York Divine Kingdom twisted her body and walked to her emperor. She giggled and giddily asked, "As far as I know, only Edwin and Gregory of the Harlen Divine Kingdom are qualified, barely! Now that their arms have been cut off by Logan, who is going to fight next? Is it Lord Randy? Or the crown prince himself?"</p>
