<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>After its last revival, the Stone Mouse had been at the mid rank of the True God Realm.</p>

  <p>Back then, even Master Evil couldn't be a match for it, and his body had been effortlessly destroyed by the powerful creature.</p>

  <p>After another rebirth, the Stone Mouse's cultivation level descended once again, and it was now at the low rank of the True God Realm.</p>

  <p>Another different thing was that Luo Zheng, who had been a proving godly warrior back then, was now a consummate True God.</p>

  <p>As soon as the Stone Mouse approached him, Luo Zheng reached out in one swift motion and caught the mouse in his hand.</p>

  <p>Squeak! Squeak! Squeak!</p>

  <p>The Stone Mouse struggled desperately in Luo Zheng's hand, its body rolling up and snapping at Luo Zheng's fingers.</p>

  <p>One of the Stone Mouse's theurgies was that it could move freely through everything. Back then, Luo Zheng's body was already strong, but it still couldn't resist the mouse.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng's finger was bitten by the Stone Mouse, it would be torn off without difficulty.</p>

  <p>Of course, Luo Zheng would not allow such a thing to happen. There was no way he would risk any part of his body; not even a single finger.</p>

  <p>He caught the mouse by its tail and shook it slightly. Before its mouth could reach his fingers, he swung it to the other direction, away from his flesh.</p>

  <p>No matter how hard it struggled, it couldn't do anything but swing whichever way Luo Zheng wanted it to, like a puppet with strings attached to its limbs.</p>

  <p>Squeak! Squeak! Squeak!</p>

  <p>After a few more attempts, the Stone Mouse finally gave up and started screeching in despair.</p>

  <p>With its scream permeating the air and echoing off the invisible walls around them, seemingly a call for help, rustling sounds suddenly came from all directions in the darkness in response.</p>

  <p>Countless green spots of light appeared from the haze of black, followed by the shadows of numerous huge mice.</p>

  <p>"These big mice, strictly speaking, are not the same type of creature as you, right?" Luo Zheng asked with a knowing smile, looking at those huge mice.</p>

  <p>Since the Stone Mouse was a one-of-a-kind true spirit, it was a unique existence and, naturally, it was impossible to have a companion of the same kind.</p>

  <p>However, it seemed to at least have the power to summon these big mice.</p>

  <p>Squeak! Squeak! Squeak!</p>

  <p>The huge mice, seemingly stupid at first, all started squeaking after they saw Luo Zheng at the altar.</p>

  <p>Their eyes shone bright red when they saw the Stone Mouse in his hand.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>All mice were nimble and quick despite their large size. The speed at which they moved was nothing short of amazing, and it didn't take long for them to approach Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Facing these huge mice, lightning flashed through Luo Zheng's eyes.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>A bolt of lightning sparked in front of him and hit the first mouse. It swiftly leaped to a nearby mouse, and then to another mouse.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the lightning had leaped a hundred times through the group of mice, eliminating them one by one.</p>

  <p>With no resistance to the power of lightning, the mice quivered and dropped dead.</p>

  <p>Soon, over one hundred mice were lying on the ground, motionless, and the smell of burnt fur smothered Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He slowly lifted the Stone Mouse and calmly said, "I know you have the memory of your previous life after every reincarnation. You are very intelligent, so you must understand what I'm saying. I only want to know who set the restriction here."</p>

  <p>Dangling in the air, the Stone Mouse stared at Luo Zheng with its small eyes. It seemed that it didn't want to reply to him.</p>

  <p>"Even if you don't tell me, I know it must be Gregorio," Luo Zheng continued in a collected voice. "Those who got you before him were not able to set such a powerful restriction. As for those after him... I think they must have been eaten by the huge mice. The problem is, who has Gregorio been incarnated as?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng guessed that there were people who had obtained the Stone Mouse before Gregorio in the past.</p>

  <p>But they failed to know about the secret of reincarnation, at least not at Gregorio's level.</p>

  <p>As for those who got the Stone Mouse after Gregorio, they must've all been eaten up by those huge mice, just like Jalen and others.</p>

  <p>Squeak! Squeak! Squeak! The Stone Mouse kept squeaking, as if it was unable to communicate with Luo Zheng at all.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked into its small eyes and sneered. "Playing dumb? Okay."</p>

  <p>He laid it on the altar and pressed on it. "It seems that as long as your corpse is thrown on the altar, you will be reincarnated immediately, and I don't need to wait for a long time. Am I right? Do you want me to try this theory again?" he threatened.</p>

  <p>After speaking, he pressed one finger on its tail, summoning lightning arcs on his other hand at the same time.</p>

  <p>The lightning arcs contained his power of consummate Thunderstorm Divine Dao, which meant they were extremely powerful and almost invincible.</p>

  <p>The Stone Mouse's eyes widened in fear when it sensed its destructive power.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's guess was correct.</p>

  <p>If it died on the altar, it could be reincarnated immediately.</p>

  <p>The Stone Mouse was an immortal creature as long as it was within the divine land. It was a very special existence!</p>

  <p>But even if it could be reincarnated infinitely, it would hate to taste the feeling of being killed again and again! The agony of dying surely wasn't something it would like to experience repeatedly.</p>

  <p>"Stop! This is the Reincarnation Land! Up until now, there are only four people who have been reincarnated successfully in the divine land. You can check it yourself. Why do you have to torture me like this?" the Stone Mouse suddenly answered in a sharp voice.</p>

  <p>Its eyes were full of contempt, having to heed Luo Zheng's warning against its will.</p>

  <p>But although its voice was harsh and strange, Luo Zheng understood all of its words.</p>

  <p>"Four people have been reincarnated successfully?" Luo Zheng repeated, raising an eyebrow.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir." the Stone Mouse said, sighing in resignation.</p>

  <p>"Take me there," Luo Zheng ordered.</p>

  <p>Reluctant as it was, the Stone Mouse had no other choice but to obey Luo Zheng's words.</p>

  <p>It didn't expect that Luo Zheng would be able to get rid of the restriction set by Gregorio, let alone massacre the huge mice that came to its rescue.</p>

  <p>If this place was not discovered by Luo Zheng by accident, it would have waited here quietly for its master. The man had promised that he would definitely find it again!</p>

  <p>There was not only one way to enter the Reincarnation Land, as the Abyss Demon Region was another way, albeit a treacherous path to take.</p>

  <p>But despite its difficulty and danger, the Stone Mouse firmly believed that its master would definitely find it again one day!</p>

  <p>With the mouse's guidance, Luo Zheng left the altar and walked into the darkness.</p>

  <p>After he advanced several thousand feet, a row of low stairs appeared in front of him. He slowly climbed up the steps, and after two to three hundred steps, he felt a powerful aura emanating ahead.</p>

  <p>The aura was quite similar to that of a soul, yet Luo Zheng knew it was impossible for one's soul to be so powerful.</p>

  <p>"What's on the steps?" Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"You'll know it when you reach the end," the Stone Mouse said.</p>

  <p>It didn't take long for Luo Zheng to finally get to the top of the stairs. As he looked down, he saw millions of orbs floating in the void in front of him.</p>

  <p>His eyes shone with wonder. The orbs created a huge ocean of light.</p>

  <p>Even the stars all over the sky paled in comparison to this magnificent sight before him.</p>

  <p>"What is this?" Luo Zheng asked with his mouth slightly open, taken aback by the sheer beauty of the lights.</p>

  <p>"They are Memory Flames," No. 9527 explained to him before Luo Zheng could force the mouse to answer. "The first condition for reincarnation is to get your Memory Flame. The Stone Mouse is technically the manager here, the one that makes sure everything is as it should be. This is why even though it died, its cultivation and memory would never disappear.</p>

  <p>Anyone who wants to be reincarnated needs its help to find their Memory Flames."</p>
