<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Even though the ground shook as a rock giant rushed quickly towards Luo Zheng, he still remained composed and nonchalant.</p>

  <p>The rock giant balled its huge fists and then smashed them towards Luo Zheng, but he disappeared in a flash from the spot!</p>

  <p>The next moment, he reappeared behind the rock giant.</p>

  <p>With a crisp sound, he slashed his sword across the giant's body, but it failed to damage even the surface of the rock.</p>

  <p>Still, Luo Zheng wasn't disappointed.</p>

  <p>In fact, he was surprised? it just proved that there really was a Chaotic Source Spirit that hid inside the rock giant and strengthened its body.</p>

  <p>Of course, he did not forget that their trip's main objective was to obtain the Chaotic Source Spirits!</p>

  <p>"Clang!"</p>

  <p>There was a deafening crash when the rock giant stretched its arms and fell on its back.</p>

  <p>The way it moved wasn't particularly slow, but it still couldn't touch Luo Zheng at all.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng moved as swiftly as a light feather that glided in the wind, that even a small force could blow him away, but not damage him.</p>

  <p>He ducked to avoid the rock giant's attack, then squinted his right eye which flashed a white beam of light.</p>

  <p>"Authentic Visual World!"</p>

  <p>As he employed the skill, the whole world became unusually clear in his vision. It didn't take him much effort to find several cracks on the surface of the rock giant.</p>

  <p>"Sword Texture Technique! Break it!"</p>

  <p>Next, he raised his sword and pointed it at the junction of two cracks found on the giant's waist.</p>

  <p>The queen ant he had fought before had absorbed many Chaotic Source Spirits over a long period of time, so its body had only one flaw.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the rock giant had many flaws since it was only a temporary product.</p>

  <p>The next events all went by in a blur.</p>

  <p>As soon as Luo Zheng's sword touched the rock giant's weak spot, its body exploded into smithereens.</p>

  <p>Yet, Luo Zheng didn't lower his guard even when the rock giant was now crushed into pieces.</p>

  <p>That was because he suspected that the Chaotic Source Spirits must have been plotting something because they gathered in the main peak. Since they hadn't assassinated him with the stalagmites, he expected them to use more powerful means against him. The rock giants, however, were much weaker than he had imagined.</p>

  <p>The thought quickly flashed in his mind? but no matter what the truth was, he believed that they must be able to obtain some Chaotic Source Spirits from the rock giants.</p>

  <p>Just as the stone fragments collapsed on the ground, a small red creature emerged out of them. Compared to the ordinary Chaotic Source Spirits that Luo Zheng had seen before, this one was in a strange red color, and its big eyes were filled with ferocity instead of the loveliness the other Chaotic Source Spirits possessed.</p>

  <p>"There's only one Chaotic Source Spirit?" he muttered. His eyes suddenly lit up in realization. Still, he stretched out his hand and an invisible force enveloped the little creature.</p>

  <p>To his surprise, the little creature moved unimaginably fast. It directly plunged into the ground in an attempt to escape.</p>

  <p>But, Luo Zheng wouldn't allow his prey to escape before him.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the force he had just released turned into an invisible giant claw and grasped at the ground.</p>

  <p>The Chaotic Source Spirit was extremely exhausted. Even if it merged with the rocks again, it wouldn't be able to make them solid to resist Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The rocks were as fragile as bean curd under the pressure of the invisible giant claw. With just a slight effort, the giant claw lifted them off the ground together with the Chaotic Source Spirit that hid inside them.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the rocks suddenly exploded in the air.</p>

  <p>The Chaotic Source Spirit immediately escaped and went straight towards Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>It came to an abrupt halt as its little red body swelled rapidly and shattered into pieces.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng couldn't believe it. Trapped in a desperate situation, it decided to blow itself up!</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the blast wasn't enough to cause any damage to him. He just covered his face with his hand and easily blocked the suicide attack.</p>

  <p>After the slight explosion, he heard a small clank by his feet.</p>

  <p>It turned out to be an amber crystal that fell on the ground.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng picked it up as he glanced across the surrounding battlefield.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, the rock giants weren't considered as formidable enemies. Feng Ge, Dorothy, Hutton, Sally, Chaim, and the Ear Mice had each fought against a rock giant. Although their own battles didn't end as fast as Luo Zheng's, the Chaotic Source Spirits inside the rock giants they faced were quickly worn out. Eventually, the rock giants became very weak.</p>

  <p>A loud thud resounded throughout the area as the Iridescent Stone had pierced one of the rock giants.</p>

  <p>The red Chaotic Source Spirit inside the rocks was forced out of them. As Sally gently flicked her fingers, the Iridescent Stone went back and hit the Chaotic Source Spirit, thus reducing it into pieces. Only an amber crystal remained, which dropped to the ground.</p>

  <p>"Perfect!" Sally exclaimed with a satisfied smile.</p>

  <p>She kicked the debris and dirt off her feet and happily picked up the amber crystal from the ground.</p>

  <p>Although it was only one Chaotic Source Spirit, it was a reward she had reaped with her own strength.</p>

  <p>Following her victory, several more loud bangs echoed in the field.</p>

  <p>The other rock giants were defeated one by one, and each of them had obtained a Chaotic Source Spirit.</p>

  <p>Once they had cleared the battlefield and gathered together, Chaim looked as if something bothered him. "I don't see the point of those strange Chaotic Source Spirits," he said.</p>

  <p>It was known that the Chaotic Source Spirits needed to merge with each other to become powerful.</p>

  <p>For instance, one hundred Chaotic Source Spirits that had fused together was as powerful as one Chaotic Source Realm warrior.</p>

  <p>Thus, a thousand or even ten thousand of them merged together would have an incomparable amount of strength.</p>

  <p>Today, however, they oddly chose to fight alone? which was like a free gift for Luo Zheng and his group of warriors.</p>

  <p>"There must be something wrong with them," Luo Zheng remarked. "I have a strange feeling that something has been staring at me in the darkness in this weird place," he added with a frown.</p>

  <p>Darth unexpectedly nodded and said, "Yes. In fact, we noticed it as soon as we got here, but we had no way to confirm our assumption."</p>

  <p>"Exactly!" the other Ear Mice chimed in as well. One aspect of the Ear Mice's abilities was far stronger than that of humans, and that was their keen perception.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng had noticed the strangeness, then the Ear Mice had surely managed to do so as well.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, Luo Zheng and his companions weren't the only ones who had encountered such weird matters.</p>

  <p>A cool, gentle breeze swept through another passageway. Yan's dress rustled elegantly against the floor as she pressed her fingers on her forehead.</p>

  <p>She gazed at several rock giants in front of her and said in a low voice,</p>

  <p>"Break!"</p>

  <p>The ground trembled and an audible crash was heard when the rock giants fell apart before her.</p>

  <p>"Freeze!"</p>

  <p>Yan opened her mouth once again, and an invisible power instantly restrained the Chaotic Source Spirits inside the rock giants.</p>

  <p>When the little creatures were exposed, they just stared at her with hatred before they detonated themselves.</p>

  <p>Several explosions later, all of them had turned into shreds.</p>

  <p>There was a trace of pity and sadness in Yan's eyes as she looked at them, even though she didn't directly kill them.</p>

  <p>She had already had a thorough understanding of these miserable creatures.</p>

  <p>All warriors in the Other Shore Realm needed to capture the Chaotic Source Spirits in order to obtain greater power.</p>

  <p>Although she could choose not to kill these creatures straight, they would still die at some point after the crystals had been taken out of their bodies. A moment of mercy wouldn't change the inevitable.</p>

  <p>The Chaotic Source Spirits had a life that entailed the constant tragedy of being nurtured and slaughtered. Perhaps no other creatures could have a more miserable fate than them.</p>

  <p>That was why the sight of hostility in their eyes made Yan uncomfortable and guilty.</p>

  <p>In any case, that same form of slaughter had been taking place in the other passages as well.</p>

  <p>The warriors had all reaped their first harvest in the main peak, but a dozen Chaotic Source Spirits were far from enough for them.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, a huge eye that resided in the main peak had been observing everything that had happened below it through the thick layers of rocks.</p>

  <p>This huge eye was ten feet wide. Half of it flashed with a white light, and the other half with a red light. It obviously didn't belong to the Chaotic Source World, because it was an Other Shore Token.</p>
