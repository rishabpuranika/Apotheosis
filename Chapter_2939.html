<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>All the Other Shore Realm warriors were surprised to see Luo Zheng resist Clement's sword strike.</p>

  <p>After all, they had found out firsthand how terrifying the Slaughtering Moonlight Array could be.</p>

  <p>Even the strongest warriors like Emily didn't have the strength to resist Clement's attacks. In fact, Emily had even turned into a Wild God, but Clement had still easily cut off one of her arms.</p>

  <p>If Ramzi hadn't set up the array, this group of Other Shore Realm warriors might have been slaughtered by the enemy!</p>

  <p>While Mike was watching this scene, a look of satisfaction spread across his face.</p>

  <p>Even though Emily and the others had objected again and again, Mike had insisted on sending Luo Zheng to the Mountain of Holy Beings. Now, it was obvious that he made the correct choice.</p>

  <p>If Emily and the others had left Luo Zheng and his companions to wait outside the divine land while they attempted to break the space barrier, the consequences would have been disastrous.</p>

  <p>Clement and his men would probably have killed all of them.</p>

  <p>"I don't believe it!"</p>

  <p>Clement's eyes burned with fury.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>All of the silver moons began shining over ten times brighter than before.</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...</p>

  <p>Clement madly waved his silver blood sword at Luo Zheng without any premeditation whatsoever.</p>

  <p>His sword strikes were so incredibly fast that it was impossible for Luo Zheng to dodge.</p>

  <p>Plop! Plop! Plop...</p>

  <p>To his satisfaction, his sword managed to make contact with Luo Zheng's body with every strike.</p>

  <p>As he attacked, the divine crystals in the Slaughtering Moonlight Array were being rapidly consumed.</p>

  <p>The Slaughtering Moonlight Array was indeed powerful. Other Shore Realm warriors wouldn't be able to resist it even if they all joined hands. All Luo Zheng did, however, was to transfer the power that he absorbed with every strike on his physical body to the Mountain of Holy Beings, causing waves of silver light to roll over the surface of the mountain.</p>

  <p>After hacking at Luo Zheng more than hundreds of times, Clement finally stopped for breath.</p>

  <p>It had taken him a lot of energy to manipulate the Slaughtering Moonlight Array this way, and weariness was written all over his face.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the divine crystals of the Slaughtering Moonlight Array were almost used up. The silver moons floating above had become dim, indicating that the array could disappear at any time.</p>

  <p>Even after all those sword strikes on his body, Luo Zheng hadn't budged even a little bit.</p>

  <p>Even those talents from the Sky Guard Pavilion wouldn't be able to withstand so many sword strikes!</p>

  <p>"Master Clement, what should we do now?" one of the Yellow Emperor Guards asked secretly through his life vitality.</p>

  <p>These Yellow Emperor Guards were starting to get anxious. Before going to the divine land, they had been very confident about their mission.</p>

  <p>They thought that the people in the divine land, who were nothing more than ants, would be no match for them.</p>

  <p>None of them had ever expected to face an invincible force like Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>If they had, they would have never followed Clement here.</p>

  <p>Clement stared at Luo Zheng for a while before letting his gaze sweep over Timotheus, Emily, and the others.</p>

  <p>The strength of those warriors was on par with his. Even if they were to take turns to fight Clement, he could barely have the upper hand.</p>

  <p>However, he was now facing a boy who was stronger than all of them put together. Clement guessed that it would be impossible to fight this guy head-on. The most important thing now was to find a way to flee the divine land!</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the divine land was vast. For now, they could temporarily hide in a corner of the divine land. Then, they could look for an opportunity to escape from the divine land altogether.</p>

  <p>As soon as the thought flashed across his mind, Clement spoke to the other Yellow Emperor Guards through his life vitality, "This guy is too strong.</p>

  <p>We won't be able to fight him. Let's run for our lives and hide somewhere in the divine land. If we get a chance in the future, let's kill these fools one by one!"</p>

  <p>Then, a trace of space fluctuation appeared around his body. He activated the Grand Teleportation technique and disappeared right in front of Luo Zheng's eyes.</p>

  <p>The rest of the Yellow Emperor Guards had been hoping that Clement would come up with a good idea. Escaping was the last thing they had expected him to suggest. They all cursed him in their hearts, but they also knew that there was no other option now. They quickly started employing the Grand Teleportation technique to flee.</p>

  <p>"You want to escape?" Emily's face darkened.</p>

  <p>Timotheus and the others also glared at the Yellow Emperor Guards with a stern expression on their faces.</p>

  <p>These people came from the same prison at the bottom of the chaos and had experienced life-threatening situations together. But now some of them had been seriously injured and many more had died miserably. How could Timotheus and the others let off these Yellow Emperor Guards?</p>

  <p>Just as they were about to track down the Yellow Emperor Guards who used the Grand Teleportation technique to escape, Luo Zheng suddenly raised his hand.</p>

  <p>"There's no need to chase them. I have an easier way of dealing with them."</p>

  <p>Emily blinked in confusion. "What are you talking about?"</p>

  <p>"Please follow me," Luo Zheng said with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>With a gentle wave of his hand, wisps of space fluctuations gathered and a space channel appeared out of thin air. Luo Zheng stepped into the space channel first.</p>

  <p>Emily hesitated for a moment, glancing into the distance. If they didn't track down the Yellow Emperor Guards right now, it would be almost impossible to find them later.</p>

  <p>But since Luo Zheng was so confident, she decided to trust him.</p>

  <p id="top_7">Mike, Lorena, Emily, Timotheus, and the others all followed Luo Zheng into the space channel.</p>

  <p>It was not until these people disappeared from the Murphy Universe that Murphy slowly floated up.</p>

  <p>The scene he had just seen was terrifying.</p>

  <p>Compared to the Other Shore Realm warriors such as Hamish and Leyton, this group of Other Shore Realm warriors seemed much more powerful, especially because of the formidable silver moons floating on top of the divine land.</p>

  <p>One glance at the light emitted by those moons struck fear into Murphy's heart.</p>

  <p>In fact, Murphy was not a coward by any means, and now that he had become a Holy Being, he was not even afraid of death.</p>

  <p>However, the power of the Slaughtering Moonlight Array was so horrible that it was able to make him feel this way.</p>

  <p>'No wonder Nicholas was determined to go to the Source World. One seems so powerful after becoming a Holy Being in this divine land, but in the eyes of an Other Shore Realm warrior, they are just as weak as an ant.'</p>

  <p>Murphy let out a deep sigh.</p>

  <p>He not only marveled at the strength of the Other Shore Realm warriors, but also worried about his own fate.</p>

  <p>Then, his gaze landed on the Trumpet Flying Ship that the Yellow Emperor Guards had left behind.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had drawn all the people and the Trumpet Flying Ship into the divine land. Now, the ship was flying on its own in the distance.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, just above the Time Sea, Emily, Timotheus, and the others were hovering in front of the Ruling Slate with puzzled expressions on their faces.</p>

  <p>However, Lorena and Mike instantly understood why Luo Zheng had brought them here. "It takes a lot of divine might coins to modify the rules on the Ruling Slate. Can you modify them as you like?" Mike asked curiously with a hint of pride in his voice.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>The rules on the Ruling Slate were aimed at all the living beings in the divine land. As long as enough divine might coins were used, they could be modified. Even an ordinary divine citizen could modify the rules.</p>

  <p>Of course, they did not have the qualifications to enter this place in the first place.</p>

  <p>Now that Luo Zheng had fused himself with the original will, the entire divine land was under his control.</p>

  <p>It was just wishful thinking for Clement and his men to think that they could hide from him. No matter where they were, Luo Zheng would be able to find them with just a thought.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng knew that Emily, Timotheus, and the others must be exhausted after fighting for such a long time. Emily had even sustained a broken arm! Letting the rules on the Ruling Slate kill those Yellow Emperor Guards was the easiest way to deal with the situation.</p>

  <p>'The existing rules on the Ruling Slate should be revised as well, ' Luo Zheng thought to himself, glancing at the Ruling Slate.</p>

  <p>With a slight wave of his hand, he dispelled all the rules on the Ruling Slate.</p>

  <p>All those rules had been written by the powerful clans on the Floating Islands. In order to write them, those clans had spent a lot of time and effort collecting the sufficient number of divine might coins. But now, Luo Zheng had easily erased those rules without a second thought.</p>

  <p>If the Holy Beings of those clans saw how easily Luo Zheng erased those rules without a second thought, they would have burned with anger and frustration.</p>

  <p>Then, Luo Zheng used his finger to gently write some new words on the Ruling Slate. Soon, a new rule appeared.</p>
