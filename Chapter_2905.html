<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Leland was floating behind the crowd in silence, and his heart was filled with shock.</p>

  <p>He had wondered whether Luo Zheng would come, but he heard from someone that all the people who went to the Abyss Demon Region had been killed, so he thought Luo Zheng died along with them.</p>

  <p>He didn't expect that Luo Zheng would be here, alive and healthy, entering the Mountain of Holy Beings this way too.</p>

  <p>The powerhouses at the Other Shore Realm knew that Luo Zheng would be coming, and that was why they'd been patiently waiting for him here.</p>

  <p>However, even with the three powerhouses joining forces, they still couldn't stop Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>Who on earth was standing behind Luo Zheng and supporting him?</p>

  <p>Leland had once thought that he was a prominent figure in the divine land after he became a Demi-holy Being, but now, he began to reconsider his thoughts about it. The divine land was far from the simple way it looked, and there were many things that he still didn't know about.</p>

  <p>Not long after, a space wave appeared next to Hamish, and three people materialized out of it.</p>

  <p>Leyton led the group, and his two companions were Samuel and Pascal.</p>

  <p>"Leyton, I'm so sorry." Hamish bowed to Leyton, feeling quite ashamed.</p>

  <p>Leyton had always been calm, and his demeanor was a sound, undisturbed lake. But right now he had a murky expression on his face. He sighed and said, "It's not your fault. They indeed have a lot of methods."</p>

  <p>Samuel frowned and joined in, "I didn't expect Estelle to make a move this time."</p>

  <p>"Forget it." Leyton waved his hand and directed his next words to the consummate True Gods and Demi-holy Beings in front of him. "You all know that the chance of being Holy Beings is too small. You won't improve your strength much even after you become Holy Beings. But you are all highly talented, otherwise you wouldn't have cultivated with limited resources to reach this level. You will have a chance to reach the Other Shore Realm in the future!"</p>

  <p>Some people's eyes lit up with hope, while the others were still a little confused.</p>

  <p>All the members of the powerful clans knew what it meant to reach the Other Shore Realm, but there were still many who didn't know.</p>

  <p>"What's the Other Shore Realm?" someone from the crowd asked in a quiet voice.</p>

  <p>"The warriors at the Other Shore Realm are the ones that manage to surpass the Holy Beings," Leyton explained with a smile. "The difference between them is like that between the True Gods and the divine citizens. We are warriors at the Other Shore Realm."</p>

  <p>After hearing Leyton's explanation, everyone finally understood.</p>

  <p>Some of the Demi-holy Beings and consummate True Gods exclaimed with excitement. If they could be as powerful as Hamish and his group, then defeating the Holy Beings would be an easy feat!</p>

  <p>"I can help you reach the Other Shore Realm," Leyton continued as everyone went silent to listen. "But there is one condition."</p>

  <p>"What condition?" a red haired Demi-holy Being asked him eagerly.</p>

  <p>"You have to enter the Mountain of Holy Beings and kill those three people there," said Leyton.</p>

  <p>"Two consummate True Gods, and one Demi-holy Being?"</p>

  <p>"If we join hands and fight together, it won't be difficult for us to defeat them!"</p>

  <p>"Where are they from?"</p>

  <p>The consummate True Gods and Demi-holy Beings who didn't know what lay ahead were quite excited.</p>

  <p>They fought so fiercely for an opportunity to become Holy Beings. How much more struggle were they willing to be under for a chance to reach the Other Shore Realm?</p>

  <p>Most of them could see hope, and it reflected with the determined fervor in their eyes.</p>

  <p>Only a few of them stayed calm, including Alfredo and Leland.</p>

  <p>Alfredo was well aware of what had happened in the Abyss Demon Region, so he knew pretty well how powerful Luo Zheng was. Leland was also there to witness Luo Zheng's strength. Even the alliance of the powerful clans could not kill Luo Zheng. How could a group of Demi-holy Beings and consummate True Gods probably defeat him? Weren't they being too naive?</p>

  <p>However, Leyton had already given the order. Those who knew the truth kept their mouths shut and didn't dare to say anything.</p>

  <p>After seeing the enthusiastic reaction of the group, Leyton was very satisfied. He said, "Good luck to all of you. Hamish, you can let them in now."</p>

  <p>Hamish nodded and got out of the way with Salim.</p>

  <p>The group hurriedly rushed into the gate and instantly disappeared, leaving only ripples behind them.</p>

  <p>When everyone was finally inside, Leyton turned to Samuel and said, "I'm afraid these people may not be strong enough to kill them."</p>

  <p>"Of course, they can't. Even I can't, let alone them," said Samuel. "It seems that Pascal has to fight in person. Even if he can't become a Holy Being, he can enter the Mountain of Holy Beings as a consummate True God. But..."</p>

  <p>Samuel was a little hesitant to continue.</p>

  <p>"But what?" Leyton asked.</p>

  <p>"I sent my two daughters to hunt Luo Zheng in the black water, but Luo Zheng seemed to have used a very strange method to forcefully break the spiritual connection between me and my daughters," said Samuel cautiously. "If I only send Pascal into the mountain, Luo Zheng may destroy the spiritual connection between us, and things might get tricky."</p>

  <p>"Don't overthink it. It's not a problem," Leyton reassured him with a smile.</p>

  <p>Then he reached out and a small blood jade gourd suddenly appeared in his hand. "Hang this gourd around Pascal's neck. No matter what Luo Zheng does, it will be difficult for him to invade Pascal's mind."</p>

  <p>The blood jade gourd exuded a mysterious aura. Samuel's eyes instantly lit up when he saw it. He repeatedly thanked Leyton and then took the jade gourd to his own hands before hanging it around Pascal's neck.</p>

  <p>Pascal didn't waste time and he immediately leaped and flew into the Mountain of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng felt himself sink into a strange silver light as he passed through the gate of the Mountain of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>The silver light shone brightly, and Luo Zheng couldn't see anything. He couldn't even feel the existence of Tianming and Sword Chen. He could only move on by feeling things around him.</p>

  <p>A few moments had passed before Luo Zheng sensed the silver light had started to fade away, and then eventually he could see the road ahead. There was a large, silver valley right before him.</p>

  <p>After entering the valley, he waited for a while until he saw Tianming and Sword Chen emerge from the silver light too.</p>

  <p>"We're finally here," Tianming exclaimed excitedly.</p>

  <p>"Lucky for us," Sword Chen said, evidently still in a state of shock.</p>

  <p>Rushing into the Mountain of Holy Beings in front of the Yellow Emperor Guards, they took a considerable risk. Especially when the Yellow Emperor Guard had broken free from the power of the Scepter of Gods' Silence, they had almost fallen into despair.</p>

  <p>"Those who enter the Mountain of Holy Beings first gain an advantage.</p>

  <p>Let's move quickly," Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>The three of them flew forward along the valley without any hesitation.</p>

  <p>Not long after Luo Zheng and the other two were gone, the other consummate True Gods and the Demi-holy Beings also reached the valley.</p>

  <p>"Haha! I'm not so interested in being a Holy Being now," said a consummate True God, who was from the south of the divine land and was a famous figure.</p>

  <p>"Indeed, if we can really reach the Other Shore Realm, then becoming Holy Beings means nothing to us," said a thin Demi-holy Being.</p>

  <p>"But we can't underestimate the three people who managed to break in even with the Yellow Emperor Guards securing the entrance," somebody said watchfully.</p>

  <p>It didn't matter though because they had already made their decisions. At least, in their eyes, killing Luo Zheng and the other two should be easier than fighting for a slight opportunity to become Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>The group of people tirelessly chased after Luo Zheng and his companions along the valley. The last one to come out of the silver light was Pascal with an expressionless face.</p>
