  <p>
</p>

  <p>Iris had always done and accomplished what Tianming asked her to do throughout all the years that passed.</p>

  <p>But she was not completely blind.</p>

  <p>From the time Tianming entered the Floating Island and until he rose in fame, she had always felt that her husband had a plan.</p>

  <p>She might not be clear about his true standpoint or intention, but that didn't mean that she couldn't figure it out.</p>

  <p>"Dongfang is only my last name... I only have you in my eyes. You are my everything and know that I will always stand behind you," Iris said firmly.</p>

  <p>Tianming stared at his wife, looking pained and conflicted.</p>

  <p>He had always been determined and had never doubted his belief.</p>

  <p>But now, his perspective seemed to crumble and he began to doubt his motives.</p>

  <p>The woman standing in front of him was the wife he had always been with. But he was working for a Holy Being he had never even seen before.</p>

  <p>The boundary between right and wrong in his heart started to blur.</p>

  <p>Maybe it was a better choice to stay in the Dongfang Clan and work for Nicholas?</p>

  <p>Tianming shook his head and threw such unrealistic idea out of his mind.</p>

  <p>"Only the Holy Beings, Demi-holy Beings, and consummate True Gods are allowed to go to the Abyss Demon Region," Tianming uttered softly.</p>

  <p>The transmission gates leading to the Abyss Demon Region were already sealed, so no other True God was allowed to enter.</p>

  <p>"If you go and ask for the permission of Holy Nicholas, he will make an exception," Iris still urged.</p>

  <p>Tianming still shook his head and explained, "The Abyss Demon Region is too dangerous. I can't protect you!"</p>

  <p>"But..." Iris still wished to strive for the chance to go with her husband.</p>

  <p>However, Tianming wasn't willing. He swiftly pulled her into his arms and whispered, "Let's drop it. I will definitely come back!"</p>

  <p>In his eyes, the situation had not progressed to that stage.</p>

  <p>The Godly Geniuses weren't gathered yet, and Harold had not personally made his move.</p>

  <p>For the meantime, he only needed to follow his plan. If there was a chance, it would be best if he could take control of the Abyss Demon Region. He had hoped that he could get rid of the fate of death by taking advantage of the Abyss Demon Region!</p>

  <p>At the outermost part of the Swirl Forest...</p>

  <p>A one thousand-foot long black python was moving rapidly.</p>

  <p>It soon wrapped its body around a thick trunk. Preparing for a move, it suddenly opened its mouth, and rushed towards another figure. It was Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was well aware of the black python's movement but he just stood still, showing no intention of making a move.</p>

  <p>As the python was getting closer to where he was, a thunderous sound instantly came from not too far away.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>A puppet of two meters high had rushed over to attack against the black python.</p>

  <p>Two extraordinary long swords were seen to be embedded in the puppet's hands. Lightning arcs continuously circled around its arms until they reached the swords.</p>

  <p>"Phew! Phew!"</p>

  <p>The python was instantly hit by the two long swords, its body immediately reeked of burning.</p>

  <p>The puppet rolled over with the help of the two long swords and chopped on its opponent's body.</p>

  <p>"Dong!"</p>

  <p>The ten foot-wide body of the python was cut off.</p>

  <p>Its head and its broken body rolled wildly, creating deep ditches on the ground.</p>

  <p>"Click, click..."</p>

  <p>The puppet then put away the two swords on its back. Its arms began to contract, and its height rapidly shrank. In no time, it turned into an old man with a fierce look on his face.</p>

  <p>The puppet was no other than Master Evil!</p>

  <p>"How do you feel?" Luo Zheng asked with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Haha!" Master Evil laughed, a hint of complacency could be heard along his laughter.</p>

  <p>He naturally felt extremely good at this moment.</p>

  <p>He had been using the puppet as his body for a period of time. The longer he used it, the more amazing he felt it was.</p>

  <p>He was only a warrior from the Vast Sky Region, while the puppet, which was created by Augustus, was not to be underestimated even in the powerful clans on the Floating Islands. He even felt that it was difficult to fully exploit the potential of the puppet with his own ability.</p>

  <p>"Ahead is the Cyan Demon Region. Are you sure you don't want to follow me to the Evil Ghost Region?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Master Evil thought for a while and shook his head firmly.</p>

  <p>Back then, he had accidentally obtained the unhatched Stone Mouse and had been interested about its story and the legend circulating about it.</p>

  <p>Now that he knew the origin and secret of the Stone Mouse, he gave up the idea of getting it.</p>

  <p>Such a thing was not what he deserved to obtain. Even if Luo Zheng was kind enough to share some benefits with him, probably he still wouldn't have the luck to enjoy them.</p>

  <p>"I won't go to the Evil Ghost Region. Isn't Wayne in the Cyan Demon Region? Hah-ha! I'm going to meet him!" Master Evil said in laughter.</p>

  <p>Master Evil and Wayne had both been imprisoned in the dungeon for a very long time, which bonded them to become friends.</p>

  <p>He thought that his strength this time was already far more powerful than that of Wayne. The body of the puppet was also enough to show off in front of that guy, so he planned to meet with him.</p>

  <p>Most importantly, the Cyan Demon Region's location was near the Swirl Forest. If something awful would really happen in the divine land, he might still be able to flee back to the Swirl Forest where he could take shelter. This was his plan for the incoming occurrences in the near future.</p>

  <p>After the talk, they both walked out of the Swirl Forest. Luo Zheng parted with Master Evil. He then activated the Grand Teleportation and headed to the south.</p>

  <p>Before leaving the Immortal Mansion, he had spent a lot of time and effort persuading Yudie to stay in the palace. It was deemed worthwhile since Yudie had looked better than before.</p>

  <p>After persuading Yudie to stay, he had trouble with Xi Youqin who was more difficult to deal with. She was persistent to follow, and talking to her gave him a lot of headache.</p>

  <p>She had never even given him a chance to say anything as she insisted on going along with him to the Evil Ghost Region.</p>

  <p>Xi Youqin was a Godly Genius, a critical figure to complete his father's plan. Although her current strength was not weak, it was better for her to stay in the Immortal Mansion and cultivate with Joy.</p>

  <p>It took much time with persuasion, and eventually, Luo Zheng finally made her agree to stay in the Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>Xun and Aura on the other hand didn't say much, but he knew that they were disappointed. However, he was not qualified to enjoy life with his wives because of the current situation. He only hoped that they could understand him.</p>

  <p>Both Harold and Hallet had already left the Immortal Mansion before Luo Zheng did.</p>

  <p>The Godly Geniuses who sneaked into the divine land were scattered throughout the land.</p>

  <p>Harold's goal was to find the Godly Geniuses back from the vast divine land.</p>

  <p>On behalf of the Gu Clan, Hallet went to meet the Moon Clan in the Hidden Tree.</p>

  <p>The Sword Clan already had an agreement to ally with Harold and although they didn't completely go against the alliance of the powerful clans on the Floating Islands, they had made their attitudes clear.</p>

  <p>And now, the only task remaining to accomplish was to know the attitude of the Moon Clan.</p>

  <p>After using the Grand Teleportation several times, Luo Zheng quickly crossed the Cyan Demon Region.</p>

  <p>Next to the Cyan Demon Region was the Wind Wood Region.</p>

  <p>He swiftly entered the Wind Wood Region. Looking around, he noticed that the place was covered with lush greenery.</p>

  <p>The whole world was full of vitality. The plants he saw around were so lush that it was beyond his imagination.</p>

  <p>"What a strong life force...</p>

  <p>So that's how it is. There are two Divine Dao Tablets in the middle of the Wind Wood Region. They are the Life Divine Dao Tablet and Cyan Wood Divine Dao Tablet.</p>

  <p>The area covered by the internal momentum of these two Divine Dao Tablets is not very large, but it is enough to affect the entire environment of the region..." Luo Zheng muttered to himself as he scanned the area.</p>

  <p>Without hesitation, he directly moved towards the two Divine Dao Tablets.</p>

  <p>It was not an easy thing to collect the Divine Dao Tablets of the three thousand Divine Dao. During his journey to the south, he had seen a lot of Divine Dao Tablets in the large regions along the way.</p>

  <p>As he headed to the south, he naturally wouldn't miss the opportunity to absorb the internal momentum in the Divine Dao Tablets.</p>
