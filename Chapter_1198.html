<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1198 Dragon Lineage Archer </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Once they had taken over the bodies of the corpses, the mighty warriors of the Soul Sea Realm were able to display and use seventy percent of their original power. But they hadn't expected that the attack from just one sharp arrow could have such terrifying power.</p>

  <p>Several young warriors became nervous at their contact with the arrow.</p>

  <p>War King Wind noticed Fiona's and Callan's nervousness. He smiled and said, "Don't be afraid. We've traveled the Road of Saints quite a few times in the past. There won't be much danger."</p>

  <p>He had originally wanted to say that the real danger was within the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land. But as he watched anxiety ripple through the warriors, he decided against it, not wanting to cause too much panic.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The effect of the first arrow crashing into the shields had barely subsided when three arrows came at them from their right.</p>

  <p>"They are coming from the right! Attention!" War King Wind yelled.</p>

  <p>The two powerful warriors of the Soul Sea Realm who were holding the shields on the right flank gripped the shields more firmly, bracing for impact.</p>

  <p>The arrows hit the surface of the shields with a clanging sound and smashed into pieces.</p>

  <p>Since they had taken careful precaution, the shield box only shook a little before the warriors balanced it back and continued on their path.</p>

  <p>"The arrows in the Fast Arrow Area are hard to dodge, but with these giant shields, it won't be too much of a problem," the crown prince of the Wind Divine Kingdom said with a smile.</p>

  <p>After all, there were so many elders protecting them on this trip. The princes weren't as nervous as they had been moments ago.</p>

  <p>The whooshing sound of consecutive arrows reached the ears of everyone.</p>

  <p>As the box formed by the giant shields went further along the Road of Saints, more and more dragon-shaped sculptures emerged from the sea, and more blue arrows shot out of the waters.</p>

  <p>These arrows came from all directions. Some appeared out of nowhere and some even came from the dragon-shaped sculptures that raised their dragon heads to shoot the arrows high up into the sky. As a result, the arrows came at them in a downward curve.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the eight giant shields had firmly encased the warriors inside. No matter which way these arrows came from, they could not penetrate the shields. The shower of arrows could do nothing to them.</p>

  <p>Although the group wasn't progressing at a fast pace, they had managed to traverse one-third of the path in about five minutes.</p>

  <p>Arrows kept raining down on the shields.</p>

  <p>War King Wind was focused on reminding the other Soul Sea Realm masters to keep their balance and avoid falling into the sea.</p>

  <p>"This Road of Saints is only 20 miles long. We will be able to cross it in an hour at the current speed we're moving," Turner said to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded. He was relaxed as he walked in the middle of the crowd.</p>

  <p>After all, he didn't need to worry about how to pass through Road of Saints. He wasn't in a hurry.</p>

  <p>At this moment, a statue slowly rose from the sea two thousand feet away from Road of Saints. This statue was shaped like a human.</p>

  <p>It looked like it was carved from white jade, and every part of him seemed lifelike, and the pair of eyes seemed to be made of some kind of precious stone, which was flickering with a scarlet light. What was stranger was that even though he was a statue, his limbs could move nimbly, as if he were alive.</p>

  <p>The human-shaped statue held a dark golden longbow in his hand and a dozen or so black arrows sat in a quiver on his back. He slowly rose up from the sea, took out a black arrow from his quiver, nocked the arrow on the dark golden longbow, and aimed it at the group.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had initially been indifferent as he followed the many powerful warriors of the Soul Sea Realm in a slow advance. It looked like an easy trip to make to enter the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land. And he had somehow thought that Brianna's physical body hadn't been much of use, despite her being at the Spirit Supreme Realm.</p>

  <p>But a chill went through his spine as he beheld the sight before him. It was as if his body had instinctively felt a great sense of crisis.</p>

  <p>"Danger?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng looked around through the gaps between the shields.</p>

  <p>Brianna's soul suddenly sounded a message from her world. "Idiots! It's the left side. Not the right! You guys have alarmed that fellow!"</p>

  <p>"That fellow? Who is it?" Luo Luo Zheng immediately turned his gaze to the right.</p>

  <p>He narrowed his eyes and discovered that something was amiss.</p>

  <p>The statues that kept rising and descending in the surroundings were almost all dragon-shaped statues. But there was a 'person' - just one - standing about two thousand feet away from them.</p>

  <p>Brianna said flatly, "The Dragon Lineage Archer is one of the masterpieces that Master Hendrix Feng was most proud of."</p>

  <p>"His arrows can penetrate these giant shields?" Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Brianna smiled and answered, "Most likely. Though the magnetic stone is hard, these eight shields are not completely made of magnetic stone.</p>

  <p>They are, in fact, made by assembling many small magnetic stones together. I don't think they will be able to resist his arrows. That fellow's arrows? They have a power that's immense and intense!"</p>

  <p>The Dragon Lineage Archer drew his bow as Brianna spoke. As he saw this, Luo Luo Zheng shouted to alert his group, "Everyone, be careful! Pay attention to the right!"</p>

  <p>He had barely finished speaking when the Dragon Lineage Archer released the bowstring.</p>

  <p>He had released the arrow.</p>

  <p>The ear-piercing sound of a bowstring vibrating resounded across the group.</p>

  <p>It created ripples on the surface of the sea, making it resemble the scales of a fish, following which, a ray of black light shot towards them.</p>

  <p>Not many people could react in such a short period of time. The moment the black light had suddenly shot out, the sound of an explosion rent the air, and the black arrow's speed increased a notch.</p>

  <p>When the black arrow was about five hundred feet away from the box formed by the giant shields, there came another explosive sound. Its speed increased twofold.</p>

  <p>"It has accelerated three times in the bowshot!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's face hardened. His hands moved as fast as lightning, grabbing Callan and Randy and pushing them away as he shouted, "Get down! All get down!"</p>

  <p>But however loudly he shouted, his words came out in Brianna's crisp voice. Only a few of the powerful warriors of the Soul Sea Realm reacted quickly enough. By the time the other Soul Sea Realm masters heard the shout and turned, the black light was only twenty or thirty feet away from the giant shields.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>Two muffled sounds could be heard.</p>

  <p>Everyone had stopped moving forward, astonished. But it wasn't long before they became fearful.</p>

  <p>Two small, round holes appeared on the shield box, one on a left shield and the other one on a right shield. This arrow had actually gone straight through the shields!</p>

  <p>A giant shield was twenty feet long and ten feet wide. The eight shields formed an area that wasn't small, but with the eighty to ninety mighty warriors of the Soul Sea Realm cramped inside, it definitely wasn't enough. They were all squeezed in together, so there wasn't much space for them to move freely.</p>

  <p>Once the arrow had pierced through the giant shields, everyone looked around, only to see four people standing motionlessly in their places.</p>

  <p>They all had small holes on their foreheads. It was pretty obvious that the black light had pierced right through their foreheads.</p>

  <p>The four of them were all at the Soul Sea Realm and they all had souls of the Fighting Soul Realm. But the power of this arrow was too great. It had penetrated their heads and entered their minds, directly shattering their souls.</p>

  <p>Thump! Thump! Thump!</p>

  <p>Once their souls were shattered, the corpses became owner-less and fell to the ground with eerie thumps.</p>

  <p>Both Callan's and Randy's eyes were filled with great fear. The place that they had stood in a moment ago was where the arrow had pierced through and shattered those souls. If it hadn't been for Luo Luo Zheng, who had pulled them aside, that black light would have penetrated their minds and destroyed their souls!</p>

  <p>"What ? What is that?"</p>

  <p>"That statue, that human-shaped statue! His arrows can pierce through shields!"</p>

  <p>"What should we do? We can't move very fast. We're like a moving target!"</p>

  <p>Four mighty warriors of the Soul Sea Realm had died under this arrow.</p>

  <p>How could the others not be panicking?</p>

  <p>The key point was that everyone was bound within the box formed by the giant shields. The space was limited, and there was no room for dodging, unless they abandoned the box. But the problem was that if they abandoned the box, they would have to face the countless arrows out there. And that was something they would definitely not survive.</p>
