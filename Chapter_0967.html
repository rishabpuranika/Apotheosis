  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was not joking. His sister, Yan Luo, was truly the most important person in his life.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning was like Marilyn? their mere existence was a threat to Yan.</p>

  <p>Marilyn had set herself against Luo Luo Zheng, so he had no choice other than to kill her. Mu Ning, however, was completely innocent.</p>

  <p>However, regardless of whether Mu Ning was innocent or not, Luo Luo Zheng still could not tolerate Yan being threatened. That was why he had decisively told Mu Ning that she could either follow him back to the Cloud Hall or be killed. It was that simple.</p>

  <p>Unsurprisingly, when Luo Luo Zheng told Mu Ning this, she was stunned.</p>

  <p>Ever since she could remember, she had been considered the smartest girl around. Apart from Brent, she was the youngest in her generation and was the most beloved daughter of the family. Even Xander, who seldom came back to the Xi Clan's castle, was fond of her. Every time he came back, he would ask Mu Ning to meet him.</p>

  <p>Since Xander was in charge of the Ethereal Spirit Sect, he had rarely shown up in the Xi Clan's castle. Even if Robin wanted to meet him, planning for it would be a real pain. But despite his frequent absence, Xander had always been fond of Mu Ning, his great-granddaughter. At this critical moment, he was actually willing to send Brent to accompany Mu Ning because he knew of the good relationship between the two of them.</p>

  <p>One could only imagine how much Xander had doted on her.</p>

  <p>It was also because of this that the members of the Xi Clan chose to tolerate her behavior again and again, even giving her ample time to choose the man she was going to marry. They had already waited for so long, yet she still had not picked anyone she liked.</p>

  <p>If she was only a random girl from some branch of the Xi Clan, the members of the clan might have already married her off to someone, by hook or by crook.</p>

  <p>Considering all the love that she had received from the people around her since she was very young, Mu Ning didn't expect that this man in front of her would be so insolent towards her, even daring to threaten that he would kill her if she refused to leave with him.</p>

  <p>Robin and Brent were also stunned. They could tell that Luo Luo Zheng was not joking. As for the other members of the Xi Clan, such as Margaret's seniors, their expressions significantly darkened after Luo Zheng's remarks.</p>

  <p>Although everyone was having a headache about Margaret's marriage, they wouldn't dare force her to marry someone. So how dare an outsider come to the Xi Clan's territory and think that he could treat Mu Ning like that!</p>

  <p>Brent frowned. Although he was an adopted son, he and Mu Ning had grown up together since they were young. The two of them were even closer than those related by blood. How could Luo Luo Zheng threaten to hurt Mu Ning?</p>

  <p>Just as Brent was about to speak up and push Luo Luo Zheng away from Mu Ning, Robin waved his hand and stopped him.</p>

  <p>With a confused expression, Brent turned to look at Robin. Mu Ning was Robin's daughter. Wasn't he worried about her safety at all?</p>

  <p>Although Brent felt fully puzzled, he chose to stay put and shut up.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning was Robin's youngest daughter. How could he not worry about her safety? However, Robin had an intuition that Luo Luo Zheng would not really do anything that would hurt his daughter. Also, he believed that his daughter was so willful to the point that someone should indeed come and teach her a good lesson.</p>

  <p>There was no need to expound on Margaret's revered position in the Xi Clan? no one dared offend her. Even as her father, Robin did not dare to be too critical of her. Everyone had to respect Xander because even though he rarely returned to the Xi Clan's castle, he was still the clan's pillar of support.</p>

  <p>Other than the members of the Xi Clan, who in the entire Ethereal City had the qualifications to teach Mu Ning a lesson?</p>

  <p>The young man in front of them seemed to be very different from a normal person. The story of Luo Luo Zheng? now considered a legend? berating Eddie was still fresh in everyone's mind. His story had been quickly made into songs being sung by patrons at tea houses and taverns.</p>

  <p>Warriors had taken a liking to it, and ordinary people had embraced it as their own.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was not even afraid of Eddie at all. So how could he be afraid of Xander?</p>

  <p>Robin wanted to see if Luo Luo Zheng had the ability to subdue his daughter.</p>

  <p>"You want me to die?</p>

  <p>Do you have the ability to do that?" Margaret's face was pale, but her temper and stubbornness still didn't leave her. Even though she had an intuition that Luo Luo Zheng would keep his word, she bit her lips, took a deep breath, kept a brave face on, and kept pressing on.</p>

  <p>Besides, why would she be afraid? There were so many members of the Xi Clan present.</p>

  <p>The young man in front of her was at the Virtual Tribulation Realm. It was true that Mu Ning was a little fearful of him, but a warrior who was at the early stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm couldn't do much to her family. Her father was a warrior at the middle stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm, and Brent had just stepped into the Virtual Tribulation Realm. Besides, Brent was a divine-level talent; he was definitely stronger than this guy in front of her.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's gaze was calm as he stared into Margaret's eyes. "I've already said that there are two options. Leave with me, or I'll kill you right here, right now. Choose between the two," he said calmly and coldly.</p>

  <p>"What if I don't want to choose?" Mu Ning replied, staring at Luo Luo Zheng with the same intensity.</p>

  <p>"Then I'll help you choose one." Luo Luo Zheng snorted lightly and actually reached out his hand to grab Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>"How dare you!" an elder of the Xi Clan shouted.</p>

  <p>However, Robin fiercely glared at the elder. The elder saw that and immediately understood what he wanted to say, so he stopped his protests and leaned back in his seat. His face, however, showed how angry he was.</p>

  <p>When Mu Ning saw that her father not only did not help her but also prevented the elder from taking action, a look of despair suddenly appeared on her face. A teenage girl's feelings of self-pity were the most likely to arise, and so she immediately cried out, "So what if I die!"</p>

  <p>The moment she finished speaking, Luo Zheng's hand was already around her supple neck, ready to choke her to death. It was at this moment that Luo Luo Zheng said, "You're not afraid of death because you've never known what death is like!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the malicious Mu Ning surged out from Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>He had accumulated quite a bit of malicious Mu Ning in the Tower of Sin and the Dark Nether Cave. The malicious Mu Ning erupted like that of a descending fiend, showing its great strength and mercilessness.</p>

  <p>The malicious Mu Ning was also known as the Mu Ning of slaughter. It was a kind of Mu Ning that one accumulated from killing others. It was a type of curse that came from the creatures that one had killed.</p>

  <p>This monstrous malicious Mu Ning gushed out, and the hearts of over ten thousand people in the entire castle trembled, to the point that even those outside the castle were alarmed.</p>

  <p>"What happened to the Xi Clan's castle?</p>

  <p>Could Eddie have sneaked in? Why is there so much malicious Mu Ning?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think so. Eddie could be righteous at some times and terribly evil at other times, but he hasn't cultivated in the killing way. He does not have such a ferocious malicious Mu Ning."</p>

  <p>"Then who is it? Who would dare to mess around with the Xi Clan in their own castle? Is he not afraid of the Ethereal Spirit Sect?"</p>

  <p>Many warriors speculated. All of them wouldn't dare trespass into the Xi Clan's castle, so they could only make wild guesses.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning started choking and suffocating. She felt like she was not facing a person, but a devil that had crawled out of hell.</p>

  <p>This man would kill her without any hesitation.</p>

  <p>Since she was a child, she had never gone too far from Xi Clan's castle.</p>

  <p>Everyone in the clan doted on her. That was why she was innocent yet so willful. This made her even more simple-minded than Bess, the female disciple of the Fish Dragon Sect.</p>

  <p>She had thought that she was not afraid of death because she had never encountered the danger of death ever before. All her life, she firmly believed that the members of the Xi Clan would protect her and die for her.</p>

  <p>But now, Mu Ning felt that she was very close to death. If the man in front of her used a little bit more of his strength, she was sure that she would die. She was already teetering on the edge of life and death.</p>

  <p>'Why won't Dad save me? Why won't he make a move? Why are the members of the Xi Clan staying still?' she thought, tears already pooling in her eyes. Finally, she began to panic. In this situation, her survival instinct kicked in, and she began to struggle.</p>

  <p>"Dad! Save me!"</p>

  <p>But this did not lessen the hold of Luo Luo Zheng on her neck. Slowly, her voice became shrill and colored with fear.</p>

  <p>As much as it was hurting him, Robin had no intentions of moving, and looked as if he hadn't heard her.</p>

  <p>The malicious Mu Ning released by Luo Luo Zheng was still rising. At the same time, he also released a portion of his soul pressure. Mu Ning definitely wouldn't be able to block Luo Zheng's soul pressure. If the pressure was too great, she might pass out immediately, so Luo Luo Zheng didn't release much of it. However, he made sure that it was enough for her to feel that the threat that he was posing against her was constantly increasing.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure you still want to choose death?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng asked, his voice deep and demonic. As he stared at the young girl in front of him, he thought of how he did not like being an evil person. The girl he was choking looked very beautiful and soft, so usually, men would feel like protecting her, even if it was the first time they had seen her. Luo Luo Zheng was no exception to that. However, he valued his sister more.</p>

  <p>Margaret's lips were turning pale. When Luo Zheng's malicious Mu Ning and soul pressure slightly lessened, she immediately said, "I...I choose to go with you!"</p>

  <p>After that proclamation, all of Luo Zheng's malicious Mu Ning was instantly poured into the Killing Sword Mountain. At the same time, his soul pressure disappeared without a trace. Mu Ning was put down, and immediately, she took a deep breath and then panted heavily.</p>

  <p>Seeing Mu Ning act like this, the members of the Xi Clan, including Robin and Brent, felt their hearts ache for her, but they were forced to do nothing.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning was like a frightened little bird as she stared at Luo Luo Zheng, great fear in her eyes. She chose to give in in the face of death, and at the same time, she had developed a deep hate for Luo Luo Zheng.</p>
