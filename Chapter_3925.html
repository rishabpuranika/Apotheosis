<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The real Eastern Emperor Taiyi was not weak by any means, but he was no match for Othniel.</p>

  <p>That was why it shocked the Grandmaster of Heaven a great deal to see him walking towards them.</p>

  <p>Fuxi, the real Snake Goddess, Gerald and Judson also sported expressions of surprise on their faces, while Herbert even bordered on desperation.</p>

  <p>In a flash, the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi spiraled into the air and brandished his golden sword radiance.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! Buzz...</p>

  <p>His bloodline-activated swordsmanship was geared to the max as nineteen golden long swords were summoned by his side.</p>

  <p>These golden swords looked illusory and extended far into the distance.</p>

  <p>Some directly stabbed into the Source World, but did not really damage it.</p>

  <p>A few sensitive creatures felt their hearts palpitate but nothing more.</p>

  <p>The blades, however, were very solid and even the toughest magic treasure in the chaos could be slashed open by them easily.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>With a shrill, ear-shattering whistle, the nineteen golden swords merged into one and immediately slashed down towards the Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>At the moment before impact, the light emanated from the blade and formed a golden arc in the air. A terrifying force was released from the sword as the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi was going to break through the Lawless Cage and pierce through the Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>Fuxi's eyes sparkled in excitement. "Eastern Emperor Taiyi is so powerful!"</p>

  <p>In contrast, the real Snake Goddess was calm and the real Fuxi sighed slightly.</p>

  <p>The real Eastern Emperor Taiyi was by no means weak, but the gap between him and the Grandmaster of Heaven was way too big. Even if he pushed that physical body to the limit, his efforts would remain futile.</p>

  <p>They had no idea how the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi defeated Othniel, but it would be impossible for him to change the situation now.</p>

  <p>In the face of such a seemingly devastating attack, the Grandmaster of Heaven only snorted as he lifted his own Cyan Misty Sword to resist his oncoming opponent's attack.</p>

  <p>His sword was fixed and stayed motionless atop his head.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Upon the moment of impact with the Cyan Misty Sword, the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi's golden sword trembled. However, the Cyan Misty Sword remained motionless.</p>

  <p>With eyes full of determination, the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi clenched his hand and lifted his sword to let out a series of slashes upon his opponent.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>This golden sword was his strongest token, but it remained unable to shake the Cyan Misty Sword that kept resisting each attack.</p>

  <p>During the course of the one-sided struggle, the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi tried to change the direction of his strikes in an attempt to kill his target but to no avail.</p>

  <p>All the Grandmaster of Heaven did was flicking his finger and blocking each of his pursuer's sword strikes.</p>

  <p>After ten strikes, the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi's sword showed signs of fatigue and the golden light was significantly dimmer than before.</p>

  <p>"I have no idea how you managed to escape Othniel, but since you're brave enough to come at me and court death, then I will fulfill your wish," the Grandmaster of Heaven muttered darkly as he went through the purple pillars and headed straight towards the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi!</p>

  <p>As soon as he got out of the Lawless Cage, Herbert immediately tried to gain control. However, the Grandmaster of Heaven merely turned around and silenced him with a glare. Soon enough, several purple pillars flashed and suppressed Herbert.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi remained resolute and had no plans to retreat. He continued to wave his dimmed golden sword and hacked away at the Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>It was a battle of blades as each strike from the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi was deflected by the Grandmaster of Heaven's Cyan Misty Sword. In the blink of an eye, the latter appeared in front of his opponent, slashing at him with his Cyan Misty Sword in order to conclude this fight.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!" the Grandmaster of Heaven shouted.</p>

  <p>However, in the split second that he was about to deal his blow, the Grandmaster of Heaven saw a look of ridicule on the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi's face with no trace of cowardice whatsoever.</p>

  <p>How could someone make such an expression in the face of death?</p>

  <p>Momentarily distracted by his confusion, the Grandmaster of Heaven was caught off-guard when he felt a piercing sensation at the back of his neck that soon escalated into indescribable pain.</p>

  <p>He turned around on reflex and saw a huge, ugly, gorilla-like monster in front of him.</p>

  <p>"Fuck off!" he screamed just as the monster was about to hug him.</p>

  <p>His reaction was extremely fast and he was able to predict what would happen next.</p>

  <p>In an effort to ward off the beast, the Grandmaster of Heaven held his Cyan Misty Sword in front of him and was ready to pierce through the oncoming monster's chest.</p>

  <p>If this monster dared to come closer, he would surely cut it in half with the Cyan Misty Sword!</p>

  <p>Of course, any regular creature would immediately give up, but Luo Zheng was considerably all-powerful in this form.</p>

  <p>Two ribs suddenly drilled out of his chest, strange, solid and metallic-looking. At the end of each rib was a small split that held the Cyan Misty Sword at bay.</p>

  <p>The strange sight made the Grandmaster of Heaven's eyes widen in shock.</p>

  <p>It was as if the two ribs had formed a customized sword rack for his blade!</p>

  <p>"What the hell is that?!" he cursed in disgust.</p>

  <p>It was half amazing yet also half disturbing.</p>

  <p>While he was frozen in shock, Luo Zheng took the chance to wrap his arms around him. At the same time, a few more ribs jutted out of his body and pierced through the Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>Puff, puff, puff...</p>

  <p>These ribs were akin to the sharpest sword and thus were able to pierce through the Grandmaster of Heaven's flesh with no resistance at all.</p>

  <p>All the onlookers in the Lawless Cage could do was to stare at this scene with looks of disbelief on their faces.</p>

  <p>"Who the hell is that?"</p>

  <p>"Where in the world did this monster come from?"</p>

  <p>"Is fate smiling down on us and sending us help?"</p>

  <p>Everyone knew that their fortunes had just been reversed by the sudden appearance of this white-haired monster.</p>

  <p>Ever since the battle began, Fuxi and the others had no time to pay attention to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>They thought that even if Luo Zheng was able to fuse with the ancestry-level bloodline, he was still weak compared to the Chaos Ancient Gods and there was no way he'd be able to contend with them. That was the reason why they asked him to guard the Li Shan mountain with Yan.</p>

  <p>Who would've thought Luo Zheng would be their unlikely trump card in the form of this white-haired monster.</p>

  <p>As the Grandmaster of Heaven was trapped within Luo Zheng's arms, he forcibly tried to struggle, just as Othniel had done.</p>

  <p>His figure constantly shifted between blurry and solid, yet he remained in Luo Zheng's hold. Soon enough, he came up with the same escape method Othniel had used and turned himself into countless Minimum Spaces to escape.</p>

  <p>There was a sour expression on the Grandmaster of Heaven's face as he shifted into countless Minimum Spaces, since it was, after all, Othniel's ability that helped him escape.</p>

  <p>He glared hard at the monster. "Who are you?" he asked coldly.</p>

  <p>It wasn't just him. Fuxi, the real Snake Goddess, Gerald, Judson, and even Herbert wanted to know who this monster was.</p>

  <p>There was no powerful beast that existed in the chaos like the one in front of them, save perhaps for the Chaos Ancient God, Lamont.</p>
