<br/><br/>

  

  <p>The ogre war sage before him had left the Tower of Sin several years ago, broken through the shackles of top-level war lords and stepped into the ranks of war sages.</p>

  <p>Naturally, now he could not enter the Cursed Land again, nor could he enter the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>This was why Zheng's name was etched in his heart as a painful reminder of the past. However, he had never actually come face-to-face with him before.</p>

  <p>So when he heard Esther calling out Zheng's name, he was very excited.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng Luo! Luo Zheng, I felt sad when I heard that you had already left the Sea God Continent. I didn't think you would dare to come back here to court death! Interesting, interesting!"</p>

  <p>Esther got anxious when she saw Luo Zheng. She thought it was not the right time for him to be here. Although she saw that he had already broken through, he was still only a first level war sage.</p>

  <p>Of course, Zheng's strength couldn't be measured by his cultivation level.</p>

  <p>Back when he was still a war lord, he had managed to kill a war sage.</p>

  <p>The problem was that the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place had started a large-scale sect war against the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place, and there were several Soul Sea Realm martial artists among them. And Luo Zheng would not be able to defeat them.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, run! The Heavenly Feather Sacred Place is about to fall. Run for your life!" Esther screamed with all her might.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, however, remained indifferent to her warning. His eyes darkened slightly. "Why would the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place dare to attack the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place ruled by Amber?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Before Esther could explain, the ogre war sage interrupted, "Now that you are here, you won't be able to escape! If you think you can, it is wishful thinking on your part!" He had been hearing about Luo Zheng for a long time. All the ogres in the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place hated Luo Zheng to the core.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng had driven the ogres out of the Tower of Sin, it was as if he had cut off the future of the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place. Without access to the Tower of Sin, they would surely decline sooner or later.</p>

  <p>When the top-level war lords went back to the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place, all the ogres, whether they were war sages or war fighters, had cursed Luo Zheng. As for the war sage in front of them, Luo Zheng had angered him so much that he demolished his own house.</p>

  <p>Little wondered then that he was thirsty for revenge.</p>

  <p>If he was allowed to enter the Cursed Land, he probably would have torn Luo Zheng to shreds.</p>

  <p>But that wasn't possible. And now that Luo Zheng himself had come to him, how could he let him go so easily?</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Ogres' bodies were huge and this particular war sage was like a small mountain. Wind whooshed as he rushed towards Luo Zheng. The saber in his hand contained a heavy pressure as he wanted to cut Luo Zheng into two.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>Esther had confidence in Zheng's abilities. She believed that after he attained the Life and Death Realm, his strength had also improved greatly. She was just worried that Luo Zheng might not be a match for the Soul Sea Realm martial artists. However, she hadn't seen him for a long time, so she wasn't too sure about his strength levels now that he had become a war sage.</p>

  <p>Therefore, she was a bit apprehensive, especially when she saw that Luo Zheng wasn't dodging the attack at all.</p>

  <p>Clang!</p>

  <p>Zheng's gaze was unwavering as the saber landed on his body.</p>

  <p>His body was strong as a sacred weapon, but in this great world, he didn't need to rely on his body. He had transferred the power of the saber to the Magnetic Sacred Mountain, so the strike didn't really have much of an effect on him.</p>

  <p>"Your name is Saroyan, right?" Luo Zheng asked coolly.</p>

  <p>Saroyan's jaw dropped in shock. His strike had cost him one hundred percent of forceful energy and yet Luo Zheng stood there without batting an eyelid! Like other ogres, Saroyan was reckless but smart. He despised Luo Zheng, but in fact, he had weighed Zheng's strength in his heart, so he had used up one hundred percent of his strength in the very first strike itself.</p>

  <p>He'd never thought that such a powerful strike would not hurt Luo Zheng at all.</p>

  <p>Was Luo Zheng really a first-level war sage?</p>

  <p>"H..how...how did you know my name?" Saroyan spluttered. He was shocked and puzzled all at once.</p>

  <p>"You have been in this world for one hundred and ninety-two years, three months, thirteen days," said Luo Zheng with a straight face.</p>

  <p>"How? How did you know that?" Saroyan was truly flummoxed now.</p>

  <p>Esther, too, was staring at Luo Zheng in amazement. There were just a few Soul Sea Realm martial artists in the Sea God Continent, but there were quite a few war sages in the races, especially in the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place, the Dread Ogre Sacred Place and the Demon Night. Luo Zheng was able to recognize this ogre war sage with absolute accuracy, right down to his age, including the month and day.</p>

  <p>Even the highly-skilled intelligence system of the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place wouldn't be so accurate. It was a mystery as to how Luo Zheng got this information.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did not answer Saroyan's question. He only shook his head in mock sadness. "But you will die right here, right now."</p>

  <p>Saying this, Luo Zheng gripped Saroyan's saber, and the power of one thousand dragon scales flowed out from within his body. This amount of power was more than enough to kill a martial artist of this level.</p>

  <p>Clang!</p>

  <p>The mid-grade sacred weapon in Saroyan's hand broke apart right from the center.</p>

  <p>Pure terror filled Saroyan's heart. It was not just Zheng's strength that frightened him; there was something eerie about him. It was almost as if Luo Zheng was omniscient and understood everything about him.</p>

  <p>Saroyan turned around, hoping to escape him. The ogre who was famed for his aggressiveness had actually chosen to flee after a single strike.</p>

  <p>"You want to flee? No way!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's gaze was unfaltering. He turned his body into a thin line and caught up with Saroyan in a flash. His hand was already on Saroyan's neck.</p>

  <p>Immediately after, a ripping sound was heard, and with Zheng's immense power, the ogre war sage's head was separated from his body!</p>

  <p>Esther watched this scene in stunned silence. She was tongue-tied. She knew that after Luo Zheng became a war sage, he would become much stronger.</p>

  <p>But she didn't expect his strength to be quite so much.</p>

  <p>War sages were divided into nine levels, and just like the Life and Death Realm, martial artists had to undergo a Small Heavenly Tribulation on each level.</p>

  <p>Some martial artists had already broken through to the Soul Sea Realm when they became fifth- or sixth-level war sages. Saroyan was a war sage at the later stage. Yet, he was killed by a single strike from Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Only Soul Sea Realm martial artists could kill a fourth-level ogre war sage so easily.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng was a first-level war lord, he was able to fight against a first-level war sage. Could it be that he had maintained such outstanding strength and fought against Soul Sea Realm martial artists?</p>

  <p>Actually, Esther's guess was not totally correct.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng's body was strong enough to fight against Soul Sea Realm martial artists, he lacked a crucial component, which was his own domain.</p>

  <p>After merging with the will of the great world, Luo Zheng was linked with the world. As long as the world was not destroyed, it was impossible for him to be killed. But, if a Soul Sea Realm martial artist used his domain and severed the connection between Luo Zheng and the world, then he would be in grave danger.</p>

  <p>However, the power he was displaying at this point was truly impressive.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>In the sky above the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place, over a hundred beams of light were still rapidly zigzagging among each other. The Demon Night was currently at a complete disadvantage.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Luo Zheng asked, "Esther, you still haven't answered my question.</p>

  <p>How can the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place dare to attack the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place? Where is Amber?"</p>

  <p>Esther's face revealed a trace of bitterness. "She is undergoing a tribulation."</p>

  <p>"You mean the Big Heavenly Tribulation?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes! The Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place are taking advantage of this opportunity to attack our sacred place,"</p>

  <p>Esther explained angrily.</p>

  <p>When one reached the Life and Death Realm, they would become a war sage. At this stage, one had to undergo Heavenly Tribulations. Small Heavenly Tribulations were for the Life and Death Realm warriors, while Big Heavenly Tribulations were for the Soul Sea Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>The Big Heavenly Tribulation was more terrifying than the small one.</p>

  <p>Although Amber's talent was impressive, the Big Heavenly Tribulation was undoubtedly very challenging.</p>

  <p>In the past, the Tower of Sin had maintained a delicate balance within the Sea God Continent, and therefore, many races lived on friendly terms with each other, never offending each other openly. If Amber had undergone the Big Heavenly Tribulation at that time, the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place would not have risked attacking the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>But now the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place had lost the access to the Tower of Sin. After the Demon Night and the humans quickly grew stronger, it would be only a matter of time before they were completely destroyed. Thus, when Amber was undergoing the Big Heavenly Tribulation, they had chosen to stake everything on one throw.</p>
