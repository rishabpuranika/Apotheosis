<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3108 Abandon The City </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The warriors hadn't been so surprised even when they had witnessed Luo Zheng kill the Sharp-winged Jin Wu.</p>

  <p>The Sharp-winged Jin Wu didn't possess strong defense abilities. Their strong suit was their fast movement and that they were difficult to track.</p>

  <p>Besides, Luo Zheng had the Flow Strike. Once he grasped a few methods, he had been able to kill the birds. The other warriors understood that.</p>

  <p>But now, Luo Zheng was facing the Blood Jin Wu.</p>

  <p>Even Other Shore Realm warriors could not break the defense of the Blood Jin Wu. Only Oneness Guards could take them head-on.</p>

  <p>Even Maxim was frustrated under the siege of the three Blood Jin Wu.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng had just cut off a Blood Sun Crow's head in one strike, which meant that he possessed as many Jun of force as a one-star Oneness Guard did. The other warriors suspected that Luo Zheng might be even stronger than a one-star Oneness Guard.</p>

  <p>'Where did Dragon City get such a powerful warrior? Even a Flag Master is stronger than a one-star Oneness Guard. Has Dragon City become this powerful?' they wondered.</p>

  <p>Gant was the only one among them who kept his calm.</p>

  <p>He knew that Luo Zheng wasn't showing his full strength yet.</p>

  <p>He wasn't sure how powerful Luo Zheng actually was. But the strike that Luo Zheng had let loose outside the Dragon City had impressed Gant.</p>

  <p>The remaining two Blood Jin Wu were cawing to each other, talking in their own language.</p>

  <p>Nobody knew what they were talking about.</p>

  <p>Their wings unfurled suddenly, the force they emitted surging wildly.</p>

  <p>Two identical Other Shore Tokens appeared on their heads. They were white feathers and gave them an aura of holiness.</p>

  <p>"Are those their Other Shore Tokens?" Luo Zheng was slightly stunned.</p>

  <p>"Yes, they are feathers from the Sunset Temple," Maxim said, nodding.</p>

  <p>"Why are their Other Shore Tokens exactly the same?" Luo Zheng noticed that a similar white feather had surfaced on the head of each Blood Sun Crow not far away.</p>

  <p>"Since they have occupied the Sunset Temple, they distributed all the Other Shore Tokens in the temple to their race,"</p>

  <p>Maxim patiently explained to Luo Zheng, surprised that Luo Zheng didn't know such basic knowledge.</p>

  <p>"The Sunset Temple has been occupied by the Jin Wu?"</p>

  <p>Upon learning this, Luo Zheng wanted to ask if the Taiyi Heaven Palace also had a temple.</p>

  <p>But the two Blood Jin Wu were in no mood to let him ask. Their strength had greatly increased by now, and they flew towards Luo Zheng and Maxim like two rays of red light.</p>

  <p>The Nine Edges Weapon Refining Array had been removed.</p>

  <p>Besides, the array used to draw Eira's blood had also been removed.</p>

  <p>Ableson hoisted the dying Eira onto his back.</p>

  <p>Cailen led the group of warriors to a high place, from where they watched the surrounding battle.</p>

  <p>The Oneness Guards and the generals and soldiers of the Blue Cloud City fought bravely, but their line of defense was still diminishing bit by bit.</p>

  <p>The corpses of the Jin Wu had piled up into many small mountains.</p>

  <p>And now, the two races were preying on each other.</p>

  <p>"This is not good."</p>

  <p>"This place will eventually be occupied by the Jin Wu!"</p>

  <p>"Does the Grand River Fortress have reinforcements for us or not?" the weapon refiners inquired impatiently.</p>

  <p>Not far from them, two tall figures stood, looking upon them.</p>

  <p>They were twin brothers: Satchel Yan and Sebert Yan.</p>

  <p>They were five-star Oneness Guards, the mainstay of the Blue Cloud City.</p>

  <p>Since the battle had begun, they had stayed by Cailen's side and hadn't involved themselves in the fight.</p>

  <p>"The Grand River Fortress responded to our request of help, but for some reason, the reinforcements haven't yet come," Satchel Yan said. His voice was rich and deep.</p>

  <p>Sebert Yan gritted his teeth and added, "I'm afraid the Jin Wu might have stopped them along the way."</p>

  <p>Cailen and the others had thought of this possibility, but none of them had wanted to voice this dreadful thought.</p>

  <p>If there were no reinforcements, the Blue Cloud City would undoubtedly be destroyed.</p>

  <p>All its people would die.</p>

  <p>"Even without reinforcements, we can't sit still and wait for our deaths," said Cailen, looking to the south.</p>

  <p>The only safe place in the whole Mountain Viewing Province was the Grand River Fortress, which was the stronghold of the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>The Blue Cloud City was not too far from Grand River Fortress.</p>

  <p>"You mean we should fight and try to leave?" Satchel Yan asked.</p>

  <p>Cailen nodded. "Yes. That's why I decided to melt the Shade Stone. We remained here only because you said we were waiting for reinforcements.</p>

  <p>Now that they might not come, it will get worse if we stay here any longer!"</p>

  <p>Satchel Yan and Sebert Yan exchanged a glance. Their cultivation bases were far stronger than Cailen's, but Cailen was the head of the Su Clan, after all. Moreover, the Grand River Fortress had issued an order for Cailen to be in charge of Blue Cloud City, and that all Oneness Guard were to serve these weapon refiners. So now, the twin brothers had to listen to Cailen.</p>

  <p>"In that case..."</p>

  <p>"The two of us will do our best to escort you."</p>

  <p>Since the Shade Stone was in Cailen's hands, he was naturally Satchel Yan's and Sebert Yan's top priority.</p>

  <p>They had barely made a decision when Satchel Yan suddenly jumped up and shouted, "Generals and soldiers, Oneness Guards, listen! The reinforcements are coming now!"</p>

  <p>The people who were fighting were excited and filled with hope at his words.</p>

  <p>Satchel Yan knew there wouldn't be any reinforcements, but these soldiers needed something to keep their morale up, a belief to live, a reason to fight, and only if they had hope would they be able to display their strongest power.</p>

  <p>This was basic military prowess.</p>

  <p>"But we've already completed the refinement of the Shade Stone. There's no need for us to guard the Blue Cloud City. Let's move south to join the reinforcements of the Grand River Fortress. Follow me!"</p>

  <p>Satchel Yan released his aura as he spoke.</p>

  <p>The aura of a five-star Oneness Guard was horrifyingly powerful. It was like a flash of light in the midst of all the chaos.</p>

  <p>His goal was not only to guide his subordinates to follow him, but also to draw the attention of the Jin Wu to cover Sebert Yan's and Cailen's tracks. This was his sacrifice.</p>

  <p>Satchel Yan dashed out of the high wall and flew south.</p>

  <p>He recited loudly, "The spring sunshine is as bright as ever. We're here to worship the Eastern Emperor. The host touches the jade on his sword. The jade pieces clink like a singer."</p>

  <p>He had used "Nine Songs," a poem extolling the virtues of Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>

  <p>All the Oneness Guards knew this poem.</p>

  <p>The other guards and soldiers, on hearing his recitation, swelled with pride and began to recite the poem, their voice firm and loud.</p>

  <p>"The spring sunshine is as bright as ever. We're here to worship the Eastern Emperor. The host touches the jade on his sword. The jade pieces clink like a singer. The grass mattress has jade on its corners. The fragrance of the flowers makes everything sweeter."</p>

  <p>The people were like an arrow, moving south.</p>

  <p>It was risky to deploy the army when the two races were fighting so fiercely. One slip could lead to a heavy loss.</p>

  <p>Satchel Yan kept boosting the morale of the soldiers and at the same time, managed to artfully make the army retreat.</p>

  <p>Cailen was shocked at his performance, thinking that Satchel Yan had great talents as a leader.</p>

  <p>Maxim's army base faced the south.</p>

  <p>Once Luo Zheng and Maxim worked together to get rid of the two Blood Jin Wu, they heard an order sounding from within the high wall. Luo Zheng glanced at Gant, and then they looked up at the same time.</p>

  <p>Following Satchel Yan's lead, Sebert Yan and the weapon refiners also flew out of the city. Gant recognized his father and spotted Eira, who was now on Ableson's back. But he was not sure if she was alive or dead.</p>
