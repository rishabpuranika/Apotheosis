  <p>
</p>

  <p>Only one in a hundred million warriors could reach the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>And even a Soul Sea Realm master could only play a supporting role in the four divine kingdoms. For the past tens of thousands of years, the main characters of the four divine kingdoms had been the four emperors.</p>

  <p>In War Emperor York's eyes, his fate was so great that he could ascend to the Upper World in the future. His future was limitless, so how could he be willing to die here?</p>

  <p>Ever since Dorothea had restrained his body, his thoughts had kept spinning and spiraling out of control. This was probably the biggest trouble he had ever faced in his life. He had never felt so powerless even when he had gone into the sea to hunt for the young Water-eyed Swallowing Beast.</p>

  <p>He knew he couldn't fight back against his enemies with his soul in such a state. No matter how hard he tried, he still wouldn't be able to think of a way to save himself.</p>

  <p>When Dorothea undid part of the restraining force, he didn't scream like the warriors before him. He knew this was his only chance to tell his opponents that he was a dignified emperor and that he could pay any price in exchange for his own life. And he wanted to seize it.</p>

  <p>Hank waved the fishing rod in his hand lightly. This time, he did not intend to throw these corpses into the crater. Instead, he would hang them above the crater to lure the thing that lurked below.</p>

  <p>The front of the fishing rod was only as thick as a little finger, and the thin green thread was fine as a hair. But it was strong enough that six or seven corpses could be hanged without any problem.</p>

  <p>"An emperor?" Hank suddenly chuckled at War Emperor York's words.</p>

  <p>"How big is your York Divine Kingdom?"</p>

  <p>"Thirty million acres of land. Four billion living creatures. I can give you my place! I will make you the emperor of York Divine Kingdom!" War Emperor York said rather desperately. Since he was suspended in midair, he could clearly see the situation within the huge crater. He noticed that at the bottom of the crater, there was a pair of huge, demonic red eyes.</p>

  <p>He knew he was pressed for time, so he took the chance to speak. Or perhaps it was begging for mercy.</p>

  <p>"Thirty million acres!" Hank didn't know whether to laugh or to cry at this information. "How big is thirty million acres? It sounds pretty big."</p>

  <p>The York Divine Kingdom wasn't small. Of the four divine kingdoms, it occupied the largest area of land. But it looked like Hank wasn't interested in the slightest.</p>

  <p>Dorothea said calmly from some distance away, "Thirty million acres is about one in ten million of the Sacred Region of the Celestial Position World. It's not even as big as my garden. These natives have quite a narrow vision."</p>

  <p>"Is it not enough? If it's not enough, I can give you the entire Divine Kingdom Continent. The four divine kingdoms— " War Emperor York became anxious. He didn't know what else he could offer to move the hearts of these people.</p>

  <p>Or perhaps he had already understood that what he was saying was all nonsense and that these people would never take a fancy to anything that belonged to him.</p>

  <p>The ground began to shake again.</p>

  <p>"Max, that thing is moving. Looks like it can't hold it in any longer. It does work!" Dorothea smiled excitedly.</p>

  <p>"Be careful, everyone! It looks like it's about to come out," Max said as a way of warning.</p>

  <p>Each of the seven people standing at the edge of the crater adopted a fighting stance, ready to fight against the upcoming enemy. Even though they were extremely powerful, they didn't dare relax in the face of the terrifying existence within the crater.</p>

  <p>War Emperor York also felt the change. He saw the pair of glowing red eyes getting closer and closer, constantly rising towards the surface.</p>

  <p>Roar!</p>

  <p>A pure black dragon's head suddenly reared out of the crater.</p>

  <p>This dragon was unique in its appearance, very unlike any normal dragon. Dragons and phoenixes were symbols of good fortune. And though dragons were powerful, they didn't look evil.</p>

  <p>There were six pairs of horns on this dragon's head, and its blood-red eyes looked terrifyingly evil. Ordinary warriors would go insane if they were enveloped by its Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>Roar!</p>

  <p>The pure black dragon jumped out of the huge crater, opening its mouth wide to bite the corpses of the Soul Sea Realm masters.</p>

  <p>War Emperor York had now become desperate. He knew that no matter how much he resisted, he wouldn't be able to escape this calamity.</p>

  <p>The dragon was about to bite the baits, and if it succeeded, there was no chance that they would survive. But at the last moment, Hank gently lifted the fishing rod and pulled War Emperor York and the others higher into the air.</p>

  <p>The dragon bit down on empty air.</p>

  <p>Hank wasn't trying to save their lives. He was just trying to lure the huge dragon out of the crater. He didn't even stop to consider War Emperor York and the others, and to him, they simply didn't matter.</p>

  <p>Roar!</p>

  <p>The giant dragon's power was imposing and powerful, on par with that of an ordinary Genuine Dragon. The only difference was probably that it was still young and didn't have a lot of spiritual wisdom.</p>

  <p>The dragon stretched out, raising its huge head and continuing chasing after the corpses.</p>

  <p>Hank gripped the fishing rod tightly and swung War Emperor York and the others so that they smashed heavily to the ground. Hank finally said,</p>

  <p>"It's your turn!"</p>

  <p>At Hank's words, the burly, muscular man, who had been standing at the edge of the crater, jumped to his feet. Flames appeared on the sickle in his hand.</p>

  <p>The burly man charged at the dragon, sickle waving in the air and creating a circular arc that spiraled and slashed towards the dragon's neck.</p>

  <p>"Come on! Fight me!" he roared.</p>

  <p>Even Luo Zheng was secretly shocked at the extent of the power of the man's attack. The power was difficult to estimate, but the giant red sickle in his hand was a divine weapon, which meant that its power was unimaginable.</p>

  <p>But as the powerful slash landed on the dragon's scale, it only produced an intense flame that sounded like metal clashing, but didn't cut through the dragon's neck. The dragon was indeed on par with a Genuine Dragon.</p>

  <p>"Such powerful defensive power! What kind of dragon is this?" Luo Zheng asked Brianna in amazement.</p>

  <p>Brianna hadn't said anything from the start. She just stared blankly at the giant dragon in the crater.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Brianna wasn't responding, Luo Zheng asked again, "Hey, why aren't you talking?"</p>

  <p>After a long while, Brianna said, "No wonder! I think those dragon-shaped monsters were summoned by this dragon. I really didn't expect to see the Evil Dragon appear after so many years!"</p>

  <p>"Evil Dragon?" Luo Zheng said, taken aback.</p>

  <p>Brianna, however, did not hear Luo Zheng and muttered to herself, "It's still not right. Why would the Evil Dragon appear in the world? There was an Ancestral Dragon's egg hidden in the sacred place of the Dragon Lineage Human. Could it be that this egg had hatched the Evil Dragon? This is impossible!"</p>

  <p>"Hey, what exactly is the Evil Dragon?" Luo Zheng asked again, now slightly annoyed by Brianna's lack of attention.</p>

  <p>Brianna finally reacted and said, "The Evil Dragon is the opposite of the Ancestral Dragon. It is a faith inheritance derived from our race."</p>

  <p>"A faith inheritance derived from your race?" Luo Zheng said quizzically. He didn't know what she was talking about.</p>

  <p>Brianna immediately replied, "Neither the Ancestral Dragon nor the Evil Dragon should exist. They are only creatures created by the illusions of our race."</p>

  <p>"Creatures created by illusions?" Luo Zheng felt that the more he listened, the more confused he became.</p>

  <p>Brianna understood Luo Zheng quite well. As a warrior of the Lower World, Zheng's knowledge of certain things in the Upper World was rather limited.</p>

  <p>She asked, "Hasn't my Grandpa Josh told you that? Creatures created by illusions are not strange at all. It's just like your so-called visualization. If you visualize something long enough, you can use the life vitality to create what you want."</p>

  <p>She continued, "Then, creatures of any race can visualize something together, and eventually produce something that doesn't exist in the world. The secret sect of your human race is a good example. They gathered a trillion humans to visualize something together. Of course, they called it 'faith.' They all believed in a sword embryo that didn't exist! After a hundred thousand years, they finally created that sword embryo. And then, the most powerful human weapon refiner forged a legendary weapon with it."</p>
