<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1086 Quarrels (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>'A warrior at the Virtual Tribulation Realm possesses a soul at the Fighting Soul Realm? It's impossible. Is it because he has a magic treasure with him that could resist my soul pressure?</p>

  <p>But not even the crown prince of the Harlen Divine Kingdom would have such an artifact, much less a mere warrior at the Virtual Tribulation Realm.'</p>

  <p>He remained curious but said nothing. His duty was to maintain order during the competition. This matter did not really concern him.</p>

  <p>Therefore, he only gave Luo Luo Zheng a look and ignored him.</p>

  <p>Once the ruckus died down, the battle's outcome had already been decided.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Luo Zheng expected, Titus Zhao's attack was fierce and probably the most powerful among the warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm present. However, brute strength would not be enough to pull him through this fight. The warriors gathered here were all talented, young individuals with their own trump cards and cultivation methods. Logan Yun's Space Armor was ingenious and proved effective in the fight against Titus.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Titus Zhao crashed onto the ground. He hissed in pain before pulling himself into a kneeling position. "Your majesty! Forgive me. I have failed you!"</p>

  <p>Scott smiled in understanding. "Please rise! Victory and defeat are integral parts of a soldier's life! There is nothing to forgive. Do not worry about it!"</p>

  <p>The emperor didn't blame him and even comforted him! Nonetheless, Titus Zhao still felt dejected. He was supposed to represent both the Wisteria Martial House and Star Field Divine Kingdom in battle, but he felt that he had failed them and his peers' expectations.</p>

  <p>It was a given that the warriors of the Star Field Divine Kingdom all had long faces. Many of them even wanted to jump out and challenge Logan Yun to a match because of what had happened.</p>

  <p>Even if Titus Zhao was their number one, there were still a lot of warriors that were on par with him. Of course they'd feel annoyed rather than awed with the result.</p>

  <p>Logan Yun couldn't be bothered as he floated in the air. His face was filled with arrogance as he scanned the square and waited for a challenge.</p>

  <p>He had declared that he was invincible among the warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm, which meant that he had full confidence in his own strength.</p>

  <p>"I'll go!</p>

  <p>I, Victor Li, challenge you!"</p>

  <p>"I'll go!"</p>

  <p>"Let me deal with this guy first!"</p>

  <p>The warriors of the Star Field Divine Kingdom were blurting out their challenges left and right, eager to prove themselves after Titus' defeat.</p>

  <p>However, a voice boomed across the square, "Challenges are to be carried out in turns, as in accordance with the rules. It is now time for the warriors from Wind Divine Kingdom and Harlen Divine Kingdom to issue their challenges."</p>

  <p>Lord Randy's and the crown prince's eyes both sparkled.</p>

  <p>The purpose of the challenge was to examine the strength of the divine kingdoms' younger generation. Both Lord Randy and the crown prince were part of this generation, but they could not readily compete and participate due to their noble statuses.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, they still had the right to recommend a fighter. The crown prince, for example, could order either Gregory or Edwin to fight in his place.</p>

  <p>Lord Randy, on the other hand, despite also having his own force, could really only recommend Luo Luo Zheng since the warrior was the only one that had the qualifications and strength to represent him.</p>

  <p>The question, however, was if Luo Luo Zheng was even willing to fight in his place.</p>

  <p>Just as he briefly mulled it over, another argument broke out on the square.</p>

  <p>Titus Zhao's defeat had left many warriors of the Wisteria Martial House dissatisfied. Since they couldn't send out a challenger to beat Logan Yun up, they decided to vent out their anger on the Jade Martial House instead.</p>

  <p>"Isn't your Jade Martial House supposedly powerful? Why don't you guys go out there and show us?"</p>

  <p>"Isn't Gregory Zhan your top warrior? Why not send him up there and give it a try? Maybe he'll get beaten up by Logan just like that!"</p>

  <p>"Ha! From what I know, the Jade Martial House will end up in an even worse state than we did!"</p>

  <p>Their arguments solidified the crown prince's decision. He nodded to his warrior and gave him a smile. "Gregory Zhan will represent me to challenge Logan Yun!"</p>

  <p>Gregory nodded, transforming into a beam of light and flew up towards the sky.</p>

  <p>This made the warriors of the Jade Martial House boil with excitement.</p>

  <p>"You can do it, Gregory! Show them!"</p>

  <p>"That brat only knows how to use the Space Law for defense! You have to beat him as fast as you can!"</p>

  <p>"Don't allow them to look down on us!"</p>

  <p>The atmosphere was heated and Gregory wasted no time. He flew forward and suddenly took out a saber behind him. The blade was thick, resembling the tooth of a wolf and flickered with a faint blue light.</p>

  <p>'A warrior at the Virtual Tribulation Realm has a mid-grade sacred weapon. I wonder if there are divine weapons in the divine kingdoms, '</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng thought to himself.</p>

  <p>He wasn't really concerned with the outcome of this battle. He wasn't born in the Jade Martial House and wasn't really a citizen of the Harlen Divine Kingdom, so he wasn't as invested as the other warriors. The only reason he came here was for Ning Yudie. Still, he needed to observe the battles in order to find out more about the other warriors.</p>

  <p>He worried a bit though. Since the crown prince chose Gregory to represent him, could that mean that Lord Randy might also ask him to fight in his place?</p>

  <p>It wasn't because he was afraid to fight but, if he went on stage, he was sure to attract the attention of the York Divine Kingdom's Holy Maiden.</p>

  <p>What should he do then? He still remembered how this Holy Maiden swore to kill him the last time they met.</p>
