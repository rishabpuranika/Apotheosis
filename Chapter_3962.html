<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The maple leaves had left the trees of the Flaming Maple Forest. However, it wasn't long before new maple leaves started sprouting on the trees.</p>

  <p>Zheng reached out his hand and gently picked one.</p>

  <p>He didn't extend his arm, nor did he build a space channel, but he somehow was able to pick a single maple leaf.</p>

  <p>"Are you able to pick anything?" The Snake Goddess's eyes lit up excitedly.</p>

  <p>If Zheng was able to harness this mysterious ability, he would become extremely powerful and extremely useful.</p>

  <p>"No." Zheng shook his head. "I can only pick the maple leaves."</p>

  <p>After he took the terrifying punches from Hawley, he was left almost in a coma. In an attempt to protect himself, he managed to activate the space theurgy to narrowly avoid Hawley, completely relying on the instinct of the ancestry-level bloodline. Upon activating the theurgy, the ancestry-level bloodline gifted him with this miraculous ability.</p>

  <p>The instant he gathered his wits, Zheng was shocked to see so many maple leaves chasing after him. However, he noticed that the maple leaves flew very slowly. Moreover, it seemed as though the maple leaves followed a certain path. To his surprise, he too was on this same path.</p>

  <p>Once he realized this, everything became simple.</p>

  <p>Others thought it was incomprehensible, but to Zheng, it was simple.</p>

  <p>Whenever someone released energy in the Flaming Maple Forest, the maple leaves would come to life and would build a specific path that led to them.</p>

  <p>No matter how fast the target was, no matter how far they ran, the maple leaves only needed to follow the path and hit the target.</p>

  <p>With Zheng, however, he realized he could manipulate the path.</p>

  <p>This was why he circled the sky several times. He created a path that looped, which trapped the maple leaves in an infinite path. As long as he didn't break the circle, the maple leaves were doomed to fly in a circle for eternity.</p>

  <p>He approached Hawley again and tapped him on the shoulder, creating a path that led straight to the latter.</p>

  <p>Because Zheng now understood the nature of the Flaming Maple Forest, he no longer feared it. In fact, he used it to his advantage. He could let the maple leaves kill Hawley for him.</p>

  <p>Once the creatures and the Eternal Realm warriors recovered from their initial shock, they hurried to make plans.</p>

  <p>Three short members of the Magic Dwarf race stepped forward first. The one in the lead raised an intact Gold and Silver Skeleton above his head.</p>

  <p>"This Gold and Silver Skeleton is extremely rare. Please accept it."</p>

  <p>The members of the Misty River race watched sullenly.</p>

  <p>Generally, when an intact Gold and Silver Skeleton was retrieved, the creatures were not allowed to keep it. The Misty River race would definitely get a share of it. Intact Gold and Silver Skeletons were extremely rare, and the Misty River race would take them as their own, and then give some broken bones to the ones who retrieved the skeletons.</p>

  <p>To their surprise, the Magic Dwarf race had actually kept an intact Gold and Silver Skeleton without them knowing.</p>

  <p>It was common for other races and Eternal Realm warriors to privately store whatever retrieved from the Divine River.</p>

  <p>The Misty River race was aware of this, of course, but they never imagined the Magic Dwarf race was audacious enough to keep a whole Gold and Silver Skeleton and present it to Zheng right in front of them.</p>

  <p>The instant Hawley died, the Magic Dwarf race ceased to take the Misty River race seriously.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Larkin suddenly cut in. "We, the Misty River race, are the masters of the Flaming Maple Forest!"</p>

  <p>Larkin was young and aggressive. He couldn't help but scold the member of the Magic Dwarf race.</p>

  <p>The member of the Magic Dwarf race turned his head to shoot Larkin a contemptuous glance. "Hawley is dead. You are too weak to be the master of the Flaming Maple Forest," he sneered.</p>

  <p>Although the members of the Magic Dwarf race were short, they were by no means ordinary.</p>

  <p>Just like the members of the Misty River race, they were all born with strong physical bodies. However, because the Misty River race had Hawley's extraordinary strength on their side, they had always had the upper hand. As a result, the Magic Dwarf race had always been suppressed.</p>

  <p>Although the population of the Magic Dwarf race was hundreds of times larger than that of the Misty River race, Hawley was powerful enough to wipe them out by himself.</p>

  <p>The Magic Dwarf race were so afraid of Hawley that they were willing to swallow the insults and humiliation thrown at them.</p>

  <p>But now, things were different.</p>

  <p>Hawley was dead.</p>

  <p>The Magic Dwarf race saw this as an opportunity.</p>

  <p>It was rare for the human race to reach here. Only those at the Eternal Realm ever made it to the Flaming Maple Forest. In the long history, the human race had made many brilliant achievements, but it disappeared for a long time. It was not until recently that a few of its members appeared in the Grand Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>They alone were definitely unable to manage the vast Flaming Maple Forest. As a result, the Magic Dwarf race was happy to do this on behalf of Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Is it useful?" Zheng asked the ancestry-level bloodline in his body.</p>

  <p>But the ancestry-level bloodline did not respond. Obviously, it had no interest in the supposed rare treasure before it.</p>

  <p>"Of course it's useful! It's sacred to any body refiner. An intact Gold and Silver Skeleton only shows up once every ten thousand years!" Eastern Emperor Taiyi said excitedly.</p>

  <p>But when he saw everyone staring at him, he suddenly fell quiet. His face turned red with embarrassment for the first time.</p>

  <p>After all, he was the leader of the Oneness Sky Palace, and the backer of the human race in the Bloom Divine Province.</p>

  <p>It was indeed a little inappropriate for him to comment on a treasure, especially in front of a younger warrior, but he couldn't help himself.</p>

  <p>Although he had found a lot of things in the Divine River in the past few years, not all of them were useful. From time to time, some strange things would float down from the upper reaches of the Divine River, but other creatures would immediately snatch them before he could even get close.</p>

  <p>As a result, the Other Shore Tokens that Eastern Emperor Taiyi brought back to the Oneness Sky Palace to benefit the members at the Holy Soul Realm were basically lowly things that no one wanted.</p>

  <p>Once, he had found a piece of Gold and Silver Bone, which was only the size of a fingernail. However, this small treasure already made him feel as though he'd uncovered a supreme Other Shore Token. After all, after he reached the Eternal Realm, not many treasures could be used to strengthen his body.</p>

  <p>Now that he saw an intact Gold and Silver Skeleton, he could hardly control his excitement.</p>

  <p>"Since you say it's a good thing, please accept it," said Zheng.</p>

  <p>The Gold and Silver Skeleton might not be useful for him, but it was extremely important to Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and King Ieuan, who were all at the Eternal Realm.</p>

  <p>The gift that the Magic Dwarf race presented to Zheng not only caused the dissatisfaction of the Misty River race, but caused a ripple effect among the other races that lived along the Divine River.</p>

  <p>They too scrambled to find worthy offerings. It was evident to all that Zheng was an incredibly important, powerful man. If they could get on his good side, they could possibly benefit from it, or at the very least, they could avoid certain death.</p>

  <p>However, just as those races were about to line up to give Zheng gifts, all the maple trees in the Flaming Maple Forest began to tremble.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>It was as if a gust of wind had swept through the Flaming Maple Forest, and all the maple leaves began to rustle at this moment. The Flaming Maple Trees suddenly came to life, communicating with each other in a unique way.</p>

  <p>Plop! Plop!</p>

  <p>Waves suddenly appeared in the Divine River.</p>

  <p>Countless thick roots suddenly emerged on the surface of the river. These were the roots of the Flaming Maple Trees!</p>

  <p>Curious, the crowd stopped in their tracks to watch the roots carry something out of the water.</p>

  <p>It seemed the roots entwined around two burnt, black limbs, and sent them to the shore. One of the burnt limbs was sent to the Wheeler, and the other was sent to the Magic Dwarf race.</p>
