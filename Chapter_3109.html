  <p>
</p>

  <p>When Satchel burst out to lead the charge, the Sun Crow race responded with action of their own.</p>

  <p>The Sun Crows, which tried to surround them, now adjusted their strategy to flock even more to the south.</p>

  <p>An unstoppable amount of them, especially Blood Sun Crows formed an impenetrable wall to the south to hold them in, making certain they would not escape.</p>

  <p>Satchel's eyes turned blood red as he saw this. He clapped his hands and yelled at the top of his lungs, "Sword!"</p>

  <p>A menacing dark thunder cloud appeared above his head. This was his Other Shore Token!</p>

  <p>"Crack..."</p>

  <p>Lightning flashed in brilliant white light and a thunderbolt exploded in sparks and flames in front of Satchel.</p>

  <p>When the light faded and the air had cleared, a thunderous sword stood before him in all its glory.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh..."</p>

  <p>The sword began to spin wildly, whipping the air around it.</p>

  <p>As the gigantic sword spun wilder and wilder, the thunder cloud began to rage, spewing out strikes of lightning into it.</p>

  <p>Just then some of the Blood Sun Crows and Sharp-winged Sun Crows attempted to rush at Satchel and prevent him from activating his omnipotent skill.</p>

  <p>But they had no chance of getting near him. They were still several hundred feet away from Satchel when they were all burnt to ashes by violent bolts of lightning shot from the cloud above his head.</p>

  <p>"So powerful..."</p>

  <p>Zheng muttered to himself, amazed by the scene.</p>

  <p>He saw that Satchel was a five-star Oneness Guard. According to the division of these super forces, Timotheus should be at the same level as Satchel, and Emily should be above them both.</p>

  <p>But now, it seemed the forces shown by Timotheus and Emily were nowhere near the power Satchel was displaying.</p>

  <p>As a sect master, Emily should be stronger than Satchel. However, she had been trapped at the bottom of the chaos for much too long and lacked divine crystals, this made it truly difficult for her to unleash the full potential of her Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>"Go!"</p>

  <p>Satchel gently pushed the giant sword in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Crack..."</p>

  <p>The giant, viciously spinning sword, wrapped almost completely with thunderbolts, surged forward at blinding pace.</p>

  <p>As it flew, the thunderbolts held within shot out all over the place and kept striking Sun Crows here and there, burning them into ashes.</p>

  <p>Almost half of the Sun Crows which gathered in the south were killed, leaving a gaping hole where they had been.</p>

  <p>"Let's go!"</p>

  <p>Satchel roared.</p>

  <p>Cailen, Sebert and the weapon refiners followed closely behind, rapidly charging to the south.</p>

  <p>The Oneness Guards and generals and soldiers who guarded the Blue Cloud City then followed too.</p>

  <p>"Let's go," Zheng said to Gant.</p>

  <p>Gant nodded. The two of them then flew up, determined to reach the weapon refiners of the Su Clan.</p>

  <p>Everyone joined in, the generals, the soldiers, even the Oneness Guards fought and retreated to the south calmly, ensuring their damage was at a minimum.</p>

  <p>Within 5 minutes, everyone had fled Blue Cloud City, followed by a dense population of Sun Crows. Blue Cloud City was left a completely deserted ghost town.</p>

  <p>"Caw...caw..."</p>

  <p>But the Sun Crow race could fly just that little bit faster than the human race and that was enough.</p>

  <p>They formed dark clouds and flew up high into the sky, catching up to those at the back of the pack fairly easily.</p>

  <p>But they had no interest in the lives of the Oneness Guards or generals or anyone else, they had come for the Shade Stone. Laser focused on their task, they sped past heading for the weapon refiners of the Su Clan.</p>

  <p>Seeing the dark cloud formed by the Sun Crows engulfing the front line, Satchel stepped up again and took out his Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>The deadly thunder cloud appeared once more, rising high into the sky.</p>

  <p>Thunderbolts darted around the cloud in flashes, striking out and incinerating countless Sun Crows.</p>

  <p>He had stalled the entire Sun Crow race all on his own.</p>

  <p>Satchel's efforts, on both occasions, had undoubtedly raised the morale of the line.</p>

  <p>Many more began their assault as well, striking Sun Crows in the sky with their rays of sword radiance flying out.</p>

  <p>"These damned birds can do nothing to the five-star Oneness Guards!"</p>

  <p>"As long as we retreat in an orderly way, we can safely return to Grand River Fortress..."</p>

  <p>"There is indeed nothing to panic about."</p>

  <p>All of a sudden the burden weighing on everyone's minds had been lifted.</p>

  <p>"If Uncle Ableson could bring Eira back to Grand River Fortress, she would no longer be in danger," said Gant, suddenly optimistic about everything.</p>

  <p>Zheng was not feeling quite the same. He gazed up at the Sun Crows, with uneasiness still clouding his heart. "Something is wrong..." he whispered.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" Gant asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"There are fewer Sun Crows than before," Zheng revealed.</p>

  <p>There were many more Sun Crows in the first attack and most of them were killed by Arrays of Innumerable Swords.</p>

  <p>This time, the Sun Crows pounced one after another. Although many had been killed by the generals and soldiers, they were definitely less than the last attack...</p>

  <p>What made it more confusing was that the Arrays of Innumerable Swords had been destroyed by that two-winged woman.</p>

  <p>"So what? It could just mean they don't have enough birds," Gant said, totally unconcerned.</p>

  <p>Zheng shook his head. "If the Sun Crow race doesn't have enough backup, they wouldn't have taken the risk to destroy the Arrays of Innumerable Swords. What they're doing is more like... ...trying to force us out."</p>

  <p>It appeared that Zheng was not the only one who had noticed this.</p>

  <p>The weapon refiners as well as Sebert and Satchel had been alerted to what was going on around them.</p>

  <p>It was by no means an easy task to resist the Sun Crow race. Their way back to Grand River Fortress was going to be a much bigger mountain to climb than they had thought.</p>

  <p>Hearing Zheng's analysis, Gant's face and demeanor shifted. "What should we do now?" he asked with a nervousness growing within him.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't know what to do. They could only continue on forward and see what fate had lined up for them.</p>

  <p>With Satchel clearing the Sun Crows above, everyone was able to advance much faster than before.</p>

  <p>Once the team had been stretched out, their speed only increased more.</p>

  <p>They could fly more freely and vigorously now.</p>

  <p>It was now the Sun Crows following up behind them, rather than the other way around as before.</p>

  <p>They had flown for about 2 hours when a mountain revealed itself in front of them.</p>

  <p>It was the junction between the Falling Fox Mountain and Blue Plain, known as the Falling Fox Ridge.</p>

  <p>A beam of pale golden light flashed up from the deep of the ridge as they approached.</p>

  <p>Seeing the peculiar nature of this, Satchel and Sebert frowned. Satchel yelled, "Stop!" He sensed something ominous ahead.</p>

  <p>The crowd was left confused by his command, as this was a great opportunity for them to escape in a flash. What was he thinking?</p>

  <p>Splash...</p>

  <p>The Sun Crows in the sky dispersed and formed a giant ring, surrounding the crowd.</p>

  <p>The golden light reflecting from the Falling Fox Ridge shone brighter and brighter. From the beaming golden light, several grey golden feathers fluttered with the wind.</p>

  <p>Three pairs of wide golden wings rose slowly from the Falling Fox Ridge.</p>

  <p>Between the wings were three beautiful women. They looked very much like the two-winged woman who had destroyed the Arrays of Innumerable Swords, but she wasn't here...</p>
