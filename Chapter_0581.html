  <p>
</p>

  <p>"You are so beautiful. I don't understand why you're dressed up like a man," Luo Luo Zheng said abruptly.</p>

  <p>"It's none of your business, all right?" said the woman coldly.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled and continued, "You are right. It was not my business.</p>

  <p>However, you dragged me down here. I believe it's only fair for me to ask for a reasonable explanation. We're stuck inside the flood dragon now, right? Tell me, what exactly were you trying to do? And? Are you really at the first grade of the Illuminating Soul Realm?"</p>

  <p>Although the woman's strength appeared to be at the first grade of the Illuminating Soul Realm, a moment ago, she had seen through the secret hidden in his basic swordplay skills within seconds. What was more surprising was that she had broken his swordplay using only her hands.</p>

  <p>This was impossible for disciples whose strength was only at the first grade of the Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>'Isn't Frank supposed to be the strongest participant? He should be the most powerful among the disciples who have just entered the Illuminating Soul Realm. Even compared to the warriors in the Central Region who have recently advanced to the Illuminating Soul Realm, Frank would rank at the top. It is possible to imagine Frank reacting in an instant. Armed with his long spear, Frank could be powerful enough to break through my basic swordplay. However, it would be impossible for him to make a breakthrough with his bare hands.</p>

  <p>However, cultivators beyond the third grade of the Illuminating Soul Realm are banned from participating in the Cloud Road test. From this aspect, the woman cannot exceed that level, ' Luo Luo Zheng rationalized.</p>

  <p>Based on the conflicting details, Luo Luo Zheng felt rather confused. Thus, he had to ask the question to clarify his doubts.</p>

  <p>"You asked a meaningless question. I wouldn't be able to participate in the trials of Cloud Road if I were not at the first grade of the Illuminating Soul Realm," the woman replied coldly.</p>

  <p>"Then how could you break through my swordplay with your bare hands?" Luo Luo Zheng asked, puzzled.</p>

  <p>"Why should I tell you?" the woman lifted her chin in defiance as she spoke.</p>

  <p>"Explain why you brought me here, inside the flood dragon?" Luo Luo Zheng continued.</p>

  <p>"Why should?? I'll tell you later!" the woman said as she glared at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Her attractive eyes shone with mischief and radiance.</p>

  <p>After a while, Luo Luo Zheng and the woman felt a violent trembling. Finally, after a loud sound, the shaking stopped. Luo Luo Zheng presumed that it was because the flood dragon had rushed to the abyss and then slowly returned to its nest.</p>

  <p>"Let's move forward!" the woman said before turning and walking past Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Where exactly are we going? Are we safe in this flood dragon?" Luo Luo Zheng couldn't help but ask with curiosity.</p>

  <p>"If you don't shut your mouth, I'll never speak to you again. Just follow me," said the woman as she walked in front of him. Although her voice was cold, it was also silvery and lovely. Luo Luo Zheng found himself attracted to her.</p>

  <p>"At the very least, tell me your name. Otherwise, I won't follow you,"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng said and stopped walking. He knew that the woman seemed to have plans for him, which was why he wouldn't die anytime soon.</p>

  <p>When she heard his request, the woman thought for a few seconds and then said, "You can call me Tia?"</p>

  <p>"Tia?" Luo Luo Zheng asked with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Yes!" she said quickly. With a last glance at Luo Luo Zheng, the woman turned and marched forward.</p>

  <p>To Luo Zheng's surprise, the flood dragon's inside seemed to be empty and dry.</p>

  <p>If it were a live flood dragon, both he and Tia would have landed in its stomach. But under the dim light held up by Tia, Luo Luo Zheng discovered that human beings had transformed the inside. Instead of a stomach, Luo Luo Zheng and Tia were walking in a palace.</p>

  <p>At this point, the cyan dragon in Luo Zheng's mind spoke with him, "This flood dragon was transformed a long while ago. Don't worry. It is dead."</p>

  <p>"A dead flood dragon? But just now?" Luo Luo Zheng replied in his mind.</p>

  <p>"Well, as you can see, it was transformed by humans. They drained its blood and soaked its skin and flesh using a secret method so that its body would not decay. Then they converted it into a puppet," the cyan dragon explained.</p>

  <p>"Why are you speaking to me after such a long silence? What do you want?" Luo Luo Zheng asked bluntly. The cyan dragon in his mind was always in a deep sleep. He would only wake when intrigued by something. Even when Luo Luo Zheng was facing a life-and-death crisis, the cyan dragon would not show. After experiencing this several times, Luo Luo Zheng had figured out how the cyan dragon worked.</p>

  <p>"Hoho, you sneaky boy?" Despite having lived for thousands of years, the cyan dragon had become impervious to sarcasm and lack of respect.</p>

  <p>He didn't mind that Luo Luo Zheng had figured out his character and had spoken in such a direct way. He continued, "The flood dragon's blood was drained a long time ago. Even its bone marrow has been totally absorbed. Thus, its body has no use or value. So low is its value that it cannot be compared to that bone spear made from the flood dragon's bone. At least that bone spear still had the blood of the flood dragon. So, its body is no longer useful to me. However, I can sense that the flood dragon's spirit is hidden somewhere. I want to devour that spirit!"</p>

  <p>"Flood dragon spirit? Didn't you just tell me that the flood dragon died a long time ago?" Luo Luo Zheng asked doubtfully. According to Luo Zheng's understanding, if the flood dragon's corporeal body had died, its spirit was bound to be gone as well.</p>

  <p>"It's not easy to control a flood dragon puppet. The best way is to extract the flood dragon's spirit, refine it, and seal it in somewhere near the puppet. That's also the most effective way," the cyan dragon explained.</p>

  <p>'Good method! The sixth-grade sect had such strength. Not only did it kill this flood dragon, but it also drained its blood, extracted its spirit, and refined it to make a flood dragon puppet. How unusual is that? Is this the work of the Blood Fiend Emperor?' Luo Luo Zheng wondered.</p>

  <p>"However? I can feel that the seal of the flood dragon's spirit seems to have loosened a bit. The nature of flood dragons is lewd and evil. You and the woman... Be careful," the cyan dragon said seriously.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded slightly as he stared at Tia's back. She was still walking in front of him. After studying her for a while, Luo Luo Zheng asked, "I have another question. Do you notice something unusual about her? Why is her strength so terrifying?"</p>
