<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Eye Vine was a monster that had lived for countless years.</p>

  <p>It could feel the space fluctuation in the sky, and how strong the fluctuation was really struck it dumb.</p>

  <p>It would eventually die if it kept fleeing this way, so it could only place its hope on Zheng now. After all, it was a fact that Zheng managed to crush a huge golden axe with his bare hands— his strength was indisputable.</p>

  <p>Thus, while it dodged, it also used Zheng as a shield to face those golden axes.</p>

  <p>In fact, considering the fact that Zheng was still standing on it, Zheng wouldn't just stay still and watch on with folded arms. Even if the Heavenly Eye Vine didn't do this, Zheng would still take the initiative to fight off those golden axes.</p>

  <p>Every time a huge golden axe swung down on them, the big mouth on Zheng's shoulder would immediately open and suck down the Life Devouring Flames. The originally golden axe would immediately lose its luster and turn into an ordinary iron axe.</p>

  <p>Although the ordinary iron axe would still retain its slashing momentum, Zheng could rip it into halves with just a little twisting movement, and it would end up being thrown aside casually by Zheng.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Some of the axes were torn apart by Zheng with bare hands, some cracked, while some others were riddled with holes.</p>

  <p>All in all, the fate of those golden axes, which had appeared out of nowhere, never strayed far from being destroyed into pieces by Zheng.</p>

  <p>Something unexpected also occurred during the fight— someone used the space theurgy and retrieved the broken giant axes. However, they soon realized that the destroyed giant axes were useless and stopped. Since no one took care of those broken axes, wherever the Heavenly Eye Vine passed, there would always be piles of iron scraps lying on the ground.</p>

  <p>When Zheng first attacked, Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and the others were quite worried, but upon seeing Zheng becoming more and more proficient in dealing with the golden axes, their tight nerves gradually loosened.</p>

  <p>Right in front of them, at the end of the first stair of the Sky Ladder Plateau, there were over a hundred creatures with transparent wings hovering in the air. These creatures were only about half the height of an adult human. They had small builds, but their heads were big. The combinations of these made them look funny.</p>

  <p>Each one of them was covered in a layer of space membrane. It was precisely these layers of space membrane that changed the surrounding light rays and allowed them and the bull-headed men to hide well.</p>

  <p>Even if one's spiritual sense swept over this area, their presence wouldn't be detected.</p>

  <p>These short creatures were the Space Manipulating Spirits in the Grand Pure Realm, and just like their name indicated, they were highly talented in manipulating space.</p>

  <p>After the Space Manipulating Spirits met the bull-headed men halfway, rather than engaging in a dead or alive battle like they usually did, both races unprecedentedly chose to join hands.</p>

  <p>Both races were determined to get the Bone Fragments Secret Soul, so after discussing with each other, the Space Manipulating Spirits and the bull-headed men lurked at the end of the first stair of the Sky Ladder Plateau, ready to ambush Zheng and his group.</p>

  <p>The bull-headed men were very powerful, and the help of the Space Manipulating Spirits made up for their shortcomings— it was like adding brilliance to their present splendor.</p>

  <p>In addition, they were in the dark, while Zheng and his group were in the light. They should've been able to catch Zheng and his group off guard and bring them down easily.</p>

  <p>But the truth was poles apart from their imagination.</p>

  <p>The Space Manipulating Spirits used the bull-headed men's axes to attack Zheng, but Zheng dealt with them easily and even smashed them into piles of scrap metal.</p>

  <p>The bull-headed men's axes were forged elaborately. They would get a Golden Spirit Axe only after they became real soldiers. In general, they could only have one such axe in their lives.</p>

  <p>Only those who'd made a great contribution would be awarded with a second Golden Spirit Axe.</p>

  <p>The bull-headed men who came here were the most powerful elites of their race. Many of them had two Golden Spirit Axes, and some even had three.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, the bull-headed men were quite willing to use their Golden Spirit Axes to attack Zheng. However, when they saw Zheng effortlessly tear their Golden Spirit Axes apart, they felt heartbroken. Those with only two Golden Spirit Axes refused to attack again and even began to quarrel with the Space Manipulating Spirits.</p>

  <p>"What the hell are you thinking?!"</p>

  <p>"That guy's not afraid of our axes!"</p>

  <p>The Space Manipulating Spirits didn't show any weakness and retorted.</p>

  <p>"We've overestimated you! Losers!"</p>

  <p>"Don't you claim to have the strongest combat power among those in the Grand Pure Realm?"</p>

  <p>"You're all elites, but you can't even defeat that one guy!"</p>

  <p>When the two races were in a fierce dispute, a blue-haired Space Manipulating Spirit said, "Everyone, shut up!"</p>

  <p>A bull-headed man with golden horns also roared, "Stop arguing! It's meaningless!"</p>

  <p>The two were leaders of their teams. After they stepped up, the two sides finally quieted down.</p>

  <p>The bull-headed man with golden horns said, "They don't know where we're yet, but they're heading towards us— we can kill them later!"</p>

  <p>"Right," the blue-haired Space Manipulating Spirit echoed in agreement.</p>

  <p>There was a vicious glint in her eyes. "I'll trap that human in a space maze.</p>

  <p>Without him, we can kill the others easily."</p>

  <p>Zheng had the ability to devour the Life Devouring Flames— it was something that neither the bull-headed men nor the Space Manipulating Spirits ever imagined.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, from their point of view, it was Zheng's physical body that was strong. Since it was a physical body, it wouldn't be difficult for them to deal with it.</p>

  <p>The two races kept hiding at the end of the first stair of the Sky Ladder Plateau, waiting for the arrival of Zheng and his group.</p>

  <p>One thousand miles...</p>

  <p>Three hundred miles...</p>

  <p>One hundred miles...</p>

  <p>When Zheng and the others finally entered their line of sight, the distance between them was only about forty miles.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>The Space Manipulating Spirits flapped their wings, and a strong spatial power spread around with them as the center.</p>

  <p>The bull-headed men were also ready to fight. They held their Golden Spirit Axes tightly, and their breaths were heavy.</p>

  <p>Twenty miles...</p>

  <p>Ten miles...</p>

  <p>Five miles...</p>

  <p>Zheng and his group were practically within reach now.</p>

  <p>"Fight!" the bull-headed man with golden horns bellowed.</p>

  <p>In an instant, the Space Manipulating Spirits withdrew the space camouflage. They flapped their transparent wings, and triangle space fragments shot towards the Heavenly Eye Vine like raindrops.</p>

  <p>The bull-headed men's Golden Spirit Axes shone brightly as they rushed forward.</p>

  <p>"Endless Corridor!"</p>

  <p>With a gentle wave of her hand, the blue-haired Space Manipulating Spirit created a winding space corridor in front of her.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The space fluctuated, and a second later, the blue-haired Space Manipulating Spirit already appeared above the Heavenly Eye Vine. She suddenly clapped her hands, and the space corridor immediately enveloped Zheng. In the blink of an eye, Zheng fell into the space corridor and vanished from everyone's sight.</p>

  <p>Da! Da! Da!</p>

  <p>Unable to dodge the triangular fragments released by the Space Manipulating Spirits, the Heavenly Eye Vine's huge body was instantly riddled with wounds and soon torn into pieces.</p>

  <p>The three Eternal Realm Hunters, as well as Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, King Ieuan, and Yasamin couldn't withstand the bull-headed men's huge axes. In a matter of seconds, all of them were killed. Blood gushed out of their wounds and flooded the area.</p>

  <p>Everything went on smoothly just like the Space Manipulating Spirits and the bull-headed men had planned.</p>

  <p>"Is it so simple?" The blue-haired Space Manipulating Spirit took a doubtful look at the corpses lying on the ground and then at Zheng who was still trapped in the Endless Corridor.</p>

  <p>There was a powerful, constantly twisting spatial force within the Endless Corridor, but it shouldn't have had much effect on Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, the purpose of this Endless Corridor was just to trap Zheng.</p>

  <p>The blue-haired Space Manipulating Spirit's eyes widened suddenly. She saw that Zheng's body had already been badly twisted by space in the Endless Corridor.</p>

  <p>But his physical body was so powerful that he could even slay Hawley— how could it be twisted by mere spatial power?</p>

  <p>"It's a trick!" the blue-haired Space Manipulating Spirit shouted as a realization hit her.</p>
