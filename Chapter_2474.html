<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Thump!"</p>

  <p>"Thump!"</p>

  <p>The crunch of gravel echoed too loudly in the mist, as if it came from a gigantic creature.</p>

  <p>The footsteps became increasingly louder and indeed, a gigantic creature was slowly approaching.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the True Gods were so excited when they found the cyan stone tablet that they let down their guard for a little bit.</p>

  <p>After all, the most important thing was to get the inheritance of the powerful warrior at the Other Shore Realm. Anything other than that was of no account.</p>

  <p>Both Reinhard and Duke thought so, until…</p>

  <p>The True Gods suddenly stopped in their tracks when they heard the loud footsteps, turned around and looked at the mist in the distance.</p>

  <p>"Hahaha!" Duke laughed wildly. "Finally he's coming! Finally!"</p>

  <p>Zheng turned around as well to look at the giant shadow within the mist.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" he asked dimly.</p>

  <p>"It's the fiend! The fiend in the abyss!" Duke announced madly. "I don't need to give up. Ha-ha! I'm just waiting to get killed!</p>

  <p>You and I, all of us will die!" "Is this fiend the incarnation of your fear?" asked Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Duke bellowed. "All of you were doomed to fail the moment I entered the debate venue! All of you are doomed to die!"</p>

  <p>Then, instead of moving backward, Duke rushed headfirst towards the huge shadow from the mist that slowly approached them.</p>

  <p>"What? Why is there a fiend here?"</p>

  <p>"Based from what Duke said, he has predicted it ever since he entered the debate venue."</p>

  <p>"In other words, he knows what he's afraid of. This fiend is the incarnation of fear that he summoned!"</p>

  <p>The chatters became louder as some disciples of the wealthy clans on the Floating Islands theorized among themselves while staring at Duke in the distance with gritted teeth.</p>

  <p>"If he wants to die, he can do that himself. Why should he get us all killed?"</p>

  <p>"Duke has gone too far!"</p>

  <p>"That is a fiend in the abyss. Some of them are as powerful as the Holy Beings!"</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, True Gods were able to fight against some incarnations of fear like the Snake Spirit and the Multiple Antennae Snake that had appeared before.</p>

  <p>They, however, could not fight against a fiend.</p>

  <p>Tyrone and the other six who had recovered their consciousness sat cross legged in meditation. All of them had sustained serious internal injuries when the Energy-extracting Needles erratically extracted their cultivation bases.</p>

  <p>Even their inner worlds weren't spared in the process.</p>

  <p>To add further salt into their wounds, they heard Duke's words which made them so angry that they almost fainted.</p>

  <p>"The Dongfang Clan has gone too far!"</p>

  <p>"Do they actually mean to tell us that the moment we entered the debate venue, we were going to die?!"</p>

  <p>"I don't want to die like this!"</p>

  <p>Tyrone and the other six were known as the elites of the powerful clans on the Floating Islands, and the strongest among the top-rank True Gods.</p>

  <p>Aside from that, they themselves also thought that they were the backbone of the powerful clans, the ones with a promising future.</p>

  <p>Therefore, they thought that it was absolutely preposterous for them to die with Duke just like that!</p>

  <p>The repetitive sounds of a gentle metallic clang rang throughout the area when the members of the Sword Clan also put down their swords.</p>

  <p>Then, Reinhard's sharp gaze landed on the huge shadow in the dense mist.</p>

  <p>"The Dongfang Clan is so ruthless," said Solomon with a thin, wan smile.</p>

  <p>"Is it worth it to sacrifice Duke and the others to prevent us from obtaining the inheritance of the debate venue?" Reinhard murmured.</p>

  <p>Judging from Marsh's attitude, both the Sword Clan and the Luo Clan attached great importance to the debate.</p>

  <p>Reinhard knew that there must still be some other reasons.</p>

  <p>Yet after he saw the Dongfang Clan's arrangements, he realized that the debate was probably more important than what he had imagined.</p>

  <p>Yan glanced coldly at the distance and said, "Whoever marks their name on the cyan stone tablet can obtain the inheritance. Now, we have all carved our names and my brother's name is on top…</p>

  <p>But why don't we see any movement?"</p>

  <p>She thought that they could leave the place right away if Zheng was qualified to obtain the inheritance. Perhaps, they could even save their lives this way.</p>

  <p>Nothing covered the stone tablet, however. There was no array.</p>

  <p>Yan's words served as a reminder for Reinhard.</p>

  <p>The reason they could find the place before was that Zheng had proposed to change directions. Soon enough, the mist in the area disappeared and was replaced by a path. They walked down the path and finally found the cyan stone tablet.</p>

  <p>They proceeded to do what they had seen on the stone tablet, but why were there still no signs of the inheritance?</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, it was already too late to think about that now.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the footsteps continued to get closer until the soft ground began to shake.</p>

  <p>"Hurry up! Edmond! Kill us!</p>

  <p>Kill us all!" Duke ran and roared on top of his lungs.</p>

  <p>It wasn't long before the figure in the mist eventually became clear.</p>

  <p>There in front of everyone, stood Edmond in his massive glory.</p>

  <p>Atlas, who had turned into lightning, appeared beside Edmond.</p>

  <p>He floated below Edmond and graced the True Gods with one of his iciest smiles.</p>

  <p>"You..." Edmond muttered when he saw Duke on the ground.</p>

  <p>He immediately felt that he had seen Duke before.</p>

  <p>However, his thought process had become so complicated that it was hard for him to recall a certain person from the past.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I remember. I-I've seen you before," Edmond said nonchalantly.</p>

  <p>"You were the weakest one among the hunters in the Abyss Demon Region."</p>

  <p>"Yes, of course you've seen me before. I created you, the incarnation of my fear!" Duke cackled.</p>

  <p>Edmond slightly bent on one leg and stretched out his huge hand. "You are like nothing.</p>

  <p>You did not create me," he responded and raised his huge middle finger at Duke.</p>

  <p>Just then, a loud, muffled sound filled the air.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>Duke bounced away as if lightning had hit him. His body flew thousands of feet away like a kite without a string, before it crashed deep into the ground. No one knew if he was dead or alive.</p>

  <p>Edmond knew that his own existence was related to those True Gods.</p>

  <p>But he was more aware of the fact that none of those True Gods could have possibly created him.</p>

  <p>Zheng, who had witnessed the whole scene, was shocked.</p>

  <p>"He's so powerful!"</p>

  <p>Indeed, Edmond could be compared to the Demi-holy Beings, and even the Holy Beings in terms of strength.</p>

  <p>He carelessly flicked the mad Duke's body away, when Atlas had noticed Zheng nearby.</p>

  <p>"Master, it's that powerful man who could cut off my thunder-like body!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>In turn, Edmond looked at where Atlas was looking and saw Zheng. Zheng suddenly felt an invisible pressure had surrounded him, and then the air around him became thick and balmy.</p>

  <p>"This powerful man you say? Haha..."</p>

  <p>As soon as he was done speaking, he stomped on Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>Even though Edmond had a tremendous size and he looked like he moved slowly, he actually had an immensely fast speed!</p>

  <p>Zheng was greatly surprised, but he swiftly used his bodily movement skill and retreated.</p>

  <p>"The Eight Smoky Melodies!"</p>

  <p>The Eight Smoky Melodies had become more powerful after it was fused with the Truth of Cultivation Nature.</p>

  <p>As for Edmond, he stepped down with his overly large foot, which created a strong wind pressure. Zheng quickly took advantage of the wind and dodged even faster.</p>

  <p>"Thump!"</p>

  <p>Edmond stepped away from the ground where his large footprint was, but there was no sign of his target.</p>
