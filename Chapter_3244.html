<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng naturally failed to decipher what was going on in Dorothy's mind.</p>

  <p>After he switched his form from his physical body to his Soul of Light to enter the Other Shore, he left the temple with Dorothy and headed for that square not far away.</p>

  <p>On that square, there was a star ring. It continued to emit coldness that was chilling to the bone.</p>

  <p>Around the star ring, many people sat with their legs crossed. They wanted to attempt at increasing their resistance against the cold.</p>

  <p>There were many ways to improve cultivation. The privileged super forces had reserves of soul crystal, and they would absorb it to increase their cultivation of Soul of Light faster compared to others.</p>

  <p>But the common folk in the Source World had no qualifications to enter the temples, let alone to get any soul crystal.</p>

  <p>So they had to make use of other ways to improve cultivation that were less effective, such as enduring the brutal cold exuded by the star ring.</p>

  <p>Since Dorothy and Zheng both had Indigo Souls, they inevitably attracted a lot of attention as they approached the scene.</p>

  <p>The Indigo Soul was invincible in Stage Four since it could reach Stage Thirteen of the Other Shore directly. As a result, Zheng and Dorothy were much more compelling than the others present there.</p>

  <p>"Let's go!"</p>

  <p>Dorothy gestured Zheng to follow after her, and then she stepped into the star ring without any hesitation.</p>

  <p>As the star ring began to spin around her, her Soul of Light stretched up vertically and turned into a ray of light. With a swift movement, it shot up towards the sky, like a rising comet.</p>

  <p>After Dorothy ascended, it was Zheng's turn. He entered the star ring to follow after her.</p>

  <p>Recalling back to when he first entered Stage Four, he remembered how hard it was for him to bear the pressure exerted by the same star ring.</p>

  <p>However, that was a while ago, and his Soul of Light had made substantial progress since then. The coldness contained in the star ring could not harm him anymore.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Within a split second, Zheng had also successfully left Stage Four.</p>

  <p>Just as they left Stage Four, a Soul of Light slowly condensed and formed in the square where they once stood.</p>

  <p>It was the first time this soul had reached Stage Four. Naturally, he was curious about exploring his surroundings.</p>

  <p>He glanced around to see if he could find anything worth his interest, and then he walked over to the side of the star ring. Upon noticing a warrior, he approached him and asked curiously, "Hey man, what are you guys doing here?"</p>

  <p>The cultivator looked annoyed by his question. He glanced at him and answered impatiently, "Are you blind!? We are cultivating here!"</p>

  <p>"What? Really?"</p>

  <p>The man turned around and scanned the star ring with a baffled expression.</p>

  <p>The principles of this cultivation method were not hard to understand.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, he began to chuckle in amusement and said, "This cultivation method is equivalent to ants crawling on the ground, it's too slow! I heard that the super forces had built temples in Stage Four. Why don't you guys go there?"</p>

  <p>Hearing his suggestion, the cultivator fell into a crippling depression. He wasn't a disciple of a noble race, which was why he didn't have the qualification to enter any of the temples. Did this man only come here to make him feel inferior and provoke him?</p>

  <p>"It's none of your business. Leave me alone!" The cultivator frantically waved his hands to drive the irritable man away.</p>

  <p>"It's none of my business? How disrespectful! No one dared to talk to me like that in Stage Three!"</p>

  <p>Offended by the cultivator's attitude, the man reached for his arm and gently scratched at it. As a result of this action, the cultivator's arm immediately left his torso. The man grabbed it and swallowed it down.</p>

  <p>This man could directly devour other people's Souls of Light!</p>

  <p>What was even more shocking was that the warrior remained seated in cultivation as if he didn't sense his arm being pulled off. However, when he glanced in the direction of the man to see what he was eating, he saw it was his arm!</p>

  <p>"You, you... You can directly swallow other people's Souls of Light!" As feelings of terror filled the cultivator, he struggled with the right words to say.</p>

  <p>"What's so strange about this? The creatures in Stage Two and Stage Three were too weak, so I came to Stage Four. This damned place. I don't like to swallow the Souls of Light of my race, but I have no choice. It seems that there are only humans in this stage?" The man replied, seeming unapologetic for his actions.</p>

  <p>Of Course, Stage Four wasn't filled with humans only. But since they belonged to the same race, they would usually fly upwards in the same direction and land at the same location.</p>

  <p>"What the hell is wrong with you? You're crazy!" The cultivator shrieked in horror. Then he turned into a blur and immediately retreated from the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>"That man can actually devour Souls of Light?"</p>

  <p>"Isn't he afraid of the consequences?"</p>

  <p>"This guy is crazy!"</p>

  <p>Other cultivators in the square began to scream in shock after witnessing that horrific scene.</p>

  <p>Each soul had its own will and could not devour each other. If one devoured too many other souls, it would be overwhelmed by them and would lose control of its will.</p>

  <p>Absorbing soul crystal was also like swallowing other souls. However, the soul crystal was not accumulated in a short time, and it was quite pure and free of such risks.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, all the Souls of Light in the square emptied their spots. They left out of fear of being devoured by this man.</p>

  <p>The man looked at the empty square in disappointment and sighed, "I've said that I don't really like to devour the soul of my race. I just wanted to know how it tasted here. It seems that Stage Four is also nothing special."</p>

  <p>He didn't bother to stop the cultivators from deserting the area. In his eyes, they were similar to insignificant ants.</p>

  <p>There was an abundance of Souls of Light in the Other Shore. Everyone in the Source World would have their Soul of Light step onto the Other Shore once reaching the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>In addition to humans, it also harbored myriads of nonhuman creatures.</p>

  <p>It only took the man a few days to move from Stage One to Stage Four by swallowing the Souls of Light of other beings.</p>

  <p>While he stood still, he narrowed his eyes to look further in the distance.</p>

  <p>Soon, his gaze fell on a temple where disciples of the Bearing race were busy with their work. A curious look appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>'I've heard that the temples keep the purest soul crystal within them. I wonder if they would give me some if I asked.'</p>

  <p>He always did what came to his mind, nothing was stopping him this time either. With quick steps, he made his way towards the temple.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng felt his soul take shape again. When he opened his eyes, he found he had reached Stage Five, the Primary Light Stage.</p>

  <p>This stage was different from Stage Four. It was fully painted in white with the ground covered in layers of salt.</p>

  <p>"Is it always so quiet in Stage Five?" Zheng asked while looking around curiously.</p>

  <p>Dorothy nodded her head and explained to him, "Most races regard Stage Four as a starting point. So Stage Five is naturally neglected. No one would stay here, unless they want to explore some unique temples."</p>

  <p>The Other Shore Tokens of Stage Five were not much different from those in Stage Four. Moreover, those from major forces managed to obtain Other Shore Tokens from higher stages in their temples, so there was no point in exploring Stage Five.</p>

  <p>The same could be said about Stages Six and Seven.</p>

  <p>Zheng and Dorothy didn't stay there for long. They entered another star ring and continued to ascend to the next stage.</p>

  <p>Stage Six, the Seven-brilliance Stage, was a little dangerous and had a complex landscape. It was covered with giant rocks painted in a bright red color.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Stage Seven, the Nothingness Stage, was occupied by pink fern. It proved refreshing in contrast to the previous stages.</p>

  <p>Stage Eight, the Great Ultimate Stage, seemed more like a world of only ice and snow.</p>

  <p>Stage Nine, the Red Sun Stage, like its name, was similar to that of a blazing sun with high temperatures.</p>

  <p>Stage Ten was called the Mysterious Light Stage...</p>

  <p>The pair kept stepping into star rings of the stages and flying upward.</p>

  <p>As they ascended, they felt the pressure of the star rings increase gradually.</p>

  <p>For an ordinary person with an average Soul of Light, it would take a few years or even longer in the ascension.</p>

  <p>However, they were Indigo Souls. They could resist the pressure with ease.</p>

  <p>They kept progressing without a hitch.</p>

  <p>Finally, they reached Stage Eleven, the Ancestral Glory Stage! dozens of giant Souls of Light appeared not far from them once they showed up in Stage Eleven. These blurry Souls of Light looked terrifying, judging from the aura they emitted.</p>

  <p>Behind Zheng, there were countless star rings. No one could tell exactly how many they were.</p>

  <p>"Humans, come this way!"</p>

  <p>A tall and seemingly powerful Soul of Light walked up to Zheng and Dorothy and pointed to the right while giving the order.</p>
