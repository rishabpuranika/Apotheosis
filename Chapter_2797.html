  <p>
</p>

  <p>The appearance of the bag had surely surprised everyone. The other Holy Beings had different expressions on their faces.</p>

  <p>They had never expected that Nicholas would have such a magic weapon.</p>

  <p>Judging from the internal momentum of Timing Divine Dao spreading from the surface of the bag, they figured it was probably a supreme treasure of belief obtained from the Time Sea Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>They wondered when Nicholas got the treasure.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>Being covered by the cloth bag, the Explosive Crystals constantly produced huge energy.</p>

  <p>But no matter how the energy raged, it couldn't break free from the bag.</p>

  <p>"I didn't expect that you have such a magic weapon!" Clark said as he laughed.</p>

  <p>The entrance of the groove was already sealed by frosty air outside, and they couldn't use Grand Teleportation. It would be a death land if the Explosive Crystals exploded.</p>

  <p>There would be no chance for them to dodge at all.</p>

  <p>All the Holy Beings and the consummate True Gods were in despair and in panic.</p>

  <p>At the most critical moment when they could surely lose their lives, Nicholas' action was truly unexpected. Their emotions were a mixture of surprise and relief at the same time. Everyone felt lucky of surviving the disaster.</p>

  <p>Nicholas had been quick to throw the bag with its opening first on the ground to cover the Explosive Crystals. He was currently pressing it firmly on the ground preventing any energy from leaking out.</p>

  <p>After proper calculations, he took a deep breath and lifted up the plump bag with a strong flip.</p>

  <p>Everyone was attentive watching Nicholas' actions. They took two steps back as soon as he flipped the bag.</p>

  <p>"The bag has been sealed, and time in the bag moves in endless cycle.</p>

  <p>These things can't really explode, unless I open the bag," Nicholas explained.</p>

  <p>In truth, the bag wasn't obtained from the Time Sea Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings would not be invited to the forbidden area on the Sun Blind race's island. They would allow consummate True Gods to get there at most. Even Demi-holy Beings were not allowed to enter.</p>

  <p>Nicholas found it in a broken time fragment when he had helped Lorena look for her body.</p>

  <p>Because of this, Nicholas had new speculations about the whole Time Sea.</p>

  <p>The supreme treasures of belief could only be found in the forbidden areas, because only the forbidden areas could gather the Faith Energy of the entire divine land.</p>

  <p>If that was the case, perhaps the entire Time Sea should be considered a huge forbidden area.</p>

  <p>At the same time when Nicholas subdued the Explosive Crystals, there were several violent explosions coming from below the volcano mouth.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>Explosive Crystals would appear in the grooves every once in a while.</p>

  <p>The woman still had no idea of the reason why it was happening.</p>

  <p>When she first explored the ice volcano mouth, she had suffered a great loss... She witnessed how Sword Chen's duplicate was shattered to pieces when the Explosive Crystals exploded.</p>

  <p>Later when she explored, she naturally became more cautious of these powerful things.</p>

  <p>Every time she stepped into the volcano mouth, she purposely made a huge noise and in turn triggered the Explosive Crystals that might exist in the grooves to explode.</p>

  <p>Since it was the alliance of powerful clans on the Floating Islands that led the way, she had forgotten her usual routine of entering the volcano mouth.</p>

  <p>Now, she ordered a Holy Being duplicate to release Wood Divine Thunder, in order to trigger all the Explosive Crystals.</p>

  <p>In her mind, she planned that if she could take this chance to get rid of the Holy Beings from the alliance of powerful clans on the Floating Islands, it would be a good thing. After all, killing the Holy Beings was also a part in her plan.</p>

  <p>"Hoo, hoo, Hoo..."</p>

  <p>The energy burst out from the Explosive Crystals and the cold air blowing from the ice volcano were two extreme energy currents.</p>

  <p>After the bright red energy burst out from the Explosive Crystals flew out of the grooves. It collided with the cold air, producing a series of cracking sound.</p>

  <p>The sound was likened to pouring water into a frying pan...</p>

  <p>As soon as the two kinds of energy reacted, it produced a wisp of light red mist. It violently surged up and rushed straight to the sky from the bottom of the ice volcano.</p>

  <p>The dense mist and the cold air condensed into dark red snowflakes, floating slowly in the world of the ice coffin. It somewhat made an extremely beautiful scene to behold.</p>

  <p>"These guys really have some skills," the woman remarked with a faint smile as she cast a glance at the third groove.</p>

  <p>These Explosive Crystals were extremely unstable. The Wood Divine Thunder would definitely detonate all of them.</p>

  <p>Her attention was focused on the third groove but no energy was released.</p>

  <p>It only meant that the Holy Beings in that groove had used some tactic to seal up the Explosive Crystals.</p>

  <p>She just gave a shrug and didn't care.</p>

  <p>They might have gotten through this stage but there were still more dangerous situations awaiting them.</p>

  <p>Moreover, she already gained perfect duplicates of the Holy Beings that followed obediently behind her. The stronger the Holy Beings performed, the stronger the duplicates would be.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>A signal came as the cold air that was constantly blowing had calmed down once more.</p>

  <p>Nicholas's action greatly encouraged his group. Although this damned place was deemed dangerous, they learned that as long as Nicholas was with them, they would be able to get through safely.</p>

  <p>Doing the same process, they immediately left the third groove and flew towards the fourth groove.</p>

  <p>They knew that the previous sound of explosion from below had meant that the Explosive Crystals in other grooves should have all exploded.</p>

  <p>When the alliance of powerful clans on the Floating Islands entered the fourth groove, they were still very cautious.</p>

  <p>One could never be too careful. No one wanted to die on the spot because of being careless. Their expression changed as if they looked like they were facing a formidable enemy.</p>

  <p>According to what the woman had said, ferocious beasts named Cold Fiends were present at the grooves. If they encountered those beasts, it was inevitable to encounter a fierce fight.</p>

  <p>"It's empty?"</p>

  <p>"There is nothing inside the fourth groove?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing? That's the best..."</p>

  <p>Everyone felt relieved making sure that nothing around posed a threat. They cautiously entered the groove and found a position to stay. Once again, the cold air outside began to blow up.</p>

  <p>As for Luo Zheng and the others with him, they had also stepped into the third groove...</p>

  <p>Taking advantage of the intervals, the two groups of people descended from one groove to another. They could only descend for about four thousand feet in five minutes. Such a speed was not that fast.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings felt fortunate to have good luck along the way.</p>

  <p>Except for the Explosive Crystals in the third groove, they actually did not encounter any threat on the following grooves.</p>

  <p>About an hour later, the alliance of powerful clans finished a third of the full journey.</p>

  <p>Everything changed at the eleventh groove...</p>

  <p>Nicholas was the first to enter the groove and immediately felt a stream of cold air advancing towards him!</p>

  <p>The temperature in the snow mountain was very low but the icy air in the groove was much lower.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>Three translucent heads were floating in the depth of the groove. The heads looked ferocious, and cold air flowed out of their eyes.</p>

  <p>"Watch out!"</p>

  <p>Nicholas noticed these strange heads and reminded the people behind him at once.</p>

  <p>But his warning came a little too late...</p>

  <p>Three streams of milky white cold air were spewed out from the mouths of the three translucent heads.</p>

  <p>The chilly air was the same as that emanated from the ice volcano, but each stream of cold air was only as thick as a finger.</p>

  <p>Despite how it looked, it shouldn't be taken lightly. A slight touch of it would also lead to death!</p>

  <p>Clark continued to follow closely behind Nicholas into the groove and upon hearing his warning, he reflexively rolled up. One of the three streams of cold air almost swept past him from his back!</p>
