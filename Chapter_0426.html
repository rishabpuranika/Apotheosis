<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>However, it was undeniable that Luo Luo Zheng was not a weak person, and the disciples had to admit this, including the fact that he was strong enough to be among the top-ranked disciples of Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>After the intermezzo, the competition resumed and Luo Luo Zheng returned to the base of Drizzle Peak.</p>

  <p>The ones most worried about Luo Zheng's safety were of course Master Wen and the Drizzle Peak disciples. All they could do was stand by helplessly, unable to help Luo Luo Zheng in his match. After all, the leader and saints were present, thus preventing them from speaking a word in front of them.</p>

  <p>Everyone held their breath until they saw Luo Luo Zheng land on his feet safely.</p>

  <p>Upon his return, they were just as filled with envy seeing the pill given by the leader to Luo Luo Zheng. Although they had no idea what the Blood Condensation Pill was, since it came from the leader, they knew it must be a rare treasure.</p>

  <p>Finally, Luo Luo Zheng sat down and took the pill.</p>

  <p>The Blood Condensation Pill had a unique taste and instantly melted in the mouth. It released a strong smell of blood, and Luo Luo Zheng almost felt that he was not taking a pill, but sucking fresh blood.</p>

  <p>After several minutes, Luo Luo Zheng could feel the blood pulsing through his body and his face burning and turning red. The rush of blood flow was twice as fast as normal. It was the Blood Condensation Pill in action.</p>

  <p>As previously explained, it was expected to increase pneuma and blood.</p>

  <p>The rapid flow of blood was good for the body and the faster it flowed, the more distinctive the promotion.</p>

  <p>With the pill's effects released to the maximum extent, Luo Luo Zheng could feel the blood burning in his vessels.</p>

  <p>Rather than discomfort, Luo Luo Zheng felt himself full of energy.</p>

  <p>He smiled as he took a deep breath of satisfaction.</p>

  <p>While Luo Luo Zheng was meditating and absorbing the pill, the competition continued in high gear.</p>

  <p>For the other disciples, Luo Zheng's assassination by saints was only an episode in the All Peaks Competition. They understood that what was most important was getting a good result in the competition.</p>

  <p>As the round-robin competition went underway and reached the later stages, the fighting in the field was getting more and more intense.</p>

  <p>All the disciples of the 33 peaks were making desperate efforts to push their final ranking.</p>

  <p>In cases where they were matched up with a top disciple from the other peaks or a personal disciple whose skill was far above their own, most would simply throw in the towel to preserve their strength for the next round of fighting. If they came up against a well-matched adversary, they spared no effort to fight and win.</p>

  <p>These were often fierce matches where they had to bring out all their potential.</p>

  <p>After another seven or eight rounds of round-robin competition, it was again Luo Zheng's turn to fight, after the drawing of lots.</p>

  <p>When the referee saw Luo Luo Zheng still seated on the ground and meditating, he assumed the fighter was still absorbing the pill and didn't know whether to interrupt him or not. The pill from the leader was very precious. It would be a sin to waste even just a little of it. So, he announced, "Luo Luo Zheng has not finished absorbing the pill. We will put off the match."</p>

  <p>Right after the announcement, Luo Luo Zheng suddenly opened his eyes and said aloud, "No! There is no need to break the rule for me."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's pronouncement threw the referee in a dilemma.</p>

  <p>He worried that it might upset Kenneth if he allowed Luo Luo Zheng to continue.</p>

  <p>Although he was not directly under Kenneth's power, just one order from the leader could get him in trouble. "But..." the referee hesitated, and left the sentence unfinished.</p>

  <p>"I have completely absorbed the pill. It was nothing serious and I can go on," Luo Luo Zheng said seriously.</p>

  <p>He stared at the referee to show he was ready.</p>

  <p>Taking a deep breath, the referee stopped arguing after Luo Zheng's declaration.</p>

  <p>He felt a sense of relief and a smile spread across his face. "Then please head on to the field," he instructed Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Luo Zheng stepped onto the field, the man at the other end of the field called out, "I give up!"</p>

  <p>The man who declared himself defeated was Jose Zhangsun. As a personal disciple, he was one of the top disciples of Daylily Peak and was of no ordinary talent. He had straight victories except for one loss to Wing.</p>

  <p>Everyone was stunned to see Jose concede defeat to Luo Luo Zheng. Personal disciples always beat ordinary disciples. No one had ever witnessed a personal disciple throw in the towel without a fight!</p>

  <p>This year's All Peaks Competition had indeed changed the logic of the disciples. Or perhaps it could be said that the performances of ordinary disciples were simply astounding.</p>

  <p>Aside from Luo Luo Zheng, Tianming was also a dark horse in the All Peaks Competition this year. He had defeated two personal disciples in succession without even using his sword. It had been incredible.</p>

  <p>In addition to Luo Luo Zheng and Tianming, Wing and Sheeny also defeated several personal disciples.</p>

  <p>People were shocked when Jose admitted defeat before even facing Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>In their view, he had the potential to be in the top 10.</p>

  <p>However, it was his bad luck to meet Luo Luo Zheng, whose spectacular performance impressed everyone. And it took everyone by surprise to see that Luo Luo Zheng was also a master of soul attack. Even Johanson, who had trained his soul intensely, could not withstand Luo Zheng's soul attack, let alone Jose.</p>

  <p>It was extremely difficult to practice the soul.</p>

  <p>And most martial artists never got the chance to even reach that level.</p>

  <p>In the several rounds that ensued, when people faced Luo Luo Zheng, no sooner had the competition started than most would toss their hands in defeat. So, Luo Luo Zheng just moved from the field to his seat without actually fighting.</p>

  <p>Tracy had become very depressed.</p>

  <p>After several rounds of drawing lots, she still hadn't met Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>She already harbored thoughts of having someone play a trick in the drawing of lots to arrange it, so she and Luo Luo Zheng ended up in the same group.</p>

  <p>After that incident, even a fool could see that Johanson versus Luo Luo Zheng was not just spontaneous. The two saints had designed the entire thing to kill Luo Luo Zheng. At this point, even she was in a special position in Cloud Sect, no one dared to help her cheat in the lot drawing.</p>

  <p>Each time when it was her turn to draw lots, she would murmur his name, again and again, hoping to get Luo Luo Zheng to be her opponent. But the results of the competition raised her hopes repeatedly.</p>
