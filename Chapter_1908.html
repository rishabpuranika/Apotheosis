<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Hearing Holy Jay's explanation, Luo Zheng finally connected all the clues he had gathered.</p>

  <p>Having obtained the Grand Weapon Refining Method and the Primal Chaos Technique, he thought he was lucky. But all of these had actually been arranged by them in advance.</p>

  <p>The creator of the Primal Chaos Technique, a man called Bromley Gu, was also the master of the fairy palace. It wasn't by chance that he created the Primal Chaos Technique. He and his friends guessed that there was a higher level of life and civilization, but that kind of life was hard to understand. They couldn't even recognize its shape.</p>

  <p>After Mike was attacked by the people of the Hall of Holy Beings, he was left in a half-dead state.</p>

  <p>There was a saying among Holy Beings— as long as the universe existed, the Holy Being who created the universe was immortal. And to a certain extent, the saying was true.</p>

  <p>But a universe wasn't an isolated area. No matter how well one constructed the universe, the life vitality within inevitably leaked out.</p>

  <p>Without a Holy Being to replenish the life vitality, the universe would eventually weaken and perish.</p>

  <p>But Holy Bromley, the most intelligent among the three of them, had helped Mike come up with a way to make the Evolutionary Universe truly last forever.</p>

  <p>Such was the Grand Era Tribulation.</p>

  <p>In the other universes, there was no such thing as a grand era that lasted 3.6 billion years. Such universes wouldn't perish after that period.</p>

  <p>After a Holy Being built a universe, it remained stable— so long as they maintained it regularly by providing life vitality, they could maintain the universe's entire operation.</p>

  <p>But it was impossible for Mike to do this in his half-dead state, so he decided to listen to Bromley and set up the Grand Era Tribulation. Every 3.6 billion years, the universe went extinct.</p>

  <p>With the exception of the nine stars, all stars fell and all living creatures withered. Mountains collapsed and rivers flowed backward. From the great to the supreme worlds, not a single thing was spared.</p>

  <p>When that time came, the entire universe would begin to shrink.</p>

  <p>Its space would be reduced to about two-thirds of its original size.</p>

  <p>During this period of contraction, the universe began to go extinct. And after that, the entire universe expanded once again.</p>

  <p>The universe was attached to the edge of the divine land. After shrinking, it would expand. Under the effects of the shrinking and expanding, it produced a powerful suction effect that absorbed life vitality from the divine land and put it into the universe.</p>

  <p>The Evolutionary Universe was like a heart— constantly contracting and expanding. It would beat once every 3.6 billion years of age to absorb life vitality.</p>

  <p>Every time it absorbed life vitality, it had enough to cover 3.6 billion years of consumption.</p>

  <p>The contracting and expanding happened a total of sixteen times.</p>

  <p>And this meant that sixteen grand eras had passed.</p>

  <p>In this new grand era, Mike's plan was finally implemented. Even Bromley contributed his fairy palace to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>In their eyes, defeating the Hall of Holy Beings was impossible. Even if Luo Zheng was nurtured enough to become a Holy Being, it wouldn't have been enough to change the final outcome.</p>

  <p>The only thing they could do was raise Luo Zheng into an extraordinary creature. A creature that stood a level higher than all living creatures in essence.</p>

  <p>The creator of the inner world was a secondary creature.</p>

  <p>And a Holy Being that created a universe was an ordinary creature.</p>

  <p>Those who constructed the divine land was an extraordinary creature.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng could successfully cultivate the Primal Chaos Technique, it'd be equal to building another divine land. Then, he'd truly have the qualifications of becoming an extraordinary creature.</p>

  <p>Such was Bromley and Mike's attempt. No one could tell if the final result turned in their favor because in the endless years of the divine land, no such thing had ever happened before.</p>

  <p>From the moment Luo Zheng was born, their plan had progressed steadily. No one could say whether or not he would be able to meet their expectations.</p>

  <p>The Hall of Holy Beings didn't think Mike could survive for so many years. Although the Time Law of the divine land was different from that of the universe and the universe's time flow rate was much faster than the divine land's, Mike had clearly lived too long.</p>

  <p>The Hall of Holy Beings then realized that if they kept waiting, Mike wouldn't die on his own. So they send another Holy Being to launch a universal war, someone who sent the warriors of the Sacred race from another universe to invade the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>"Who is that Holy Being?" Luo Zheng asked coldly when he heard it.</p>

  <p>"His name is Murphy Mu, a member of the Hall of Holy Beings. People call him Holy Murphy— he built what is now called the Murphy Universe," Holy Jay answered.</p>

  <p>"Murphy Mu! Holy Murphy!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng made sure to engrave the name deeply in his mind.</p>

  <p>The man didn't only invade the Evolutionary Universe, but he also wanted Mike to perish. No matter how Luo Zheng looked at it, Holy Murphy stood as his biggest opponent.</p>

  <p>"One more question," Luo Zheng piped after some thought.</p>

  <p>"What is it?"</p>

  <p>"I've encountered the warriors of the Sacred race in the True Path of the fairy palace. Didn't they say they disappeared long ago? Why would they appear in the universe created by Holy Murphy?"</p>

  <p>For as long as he could remember, Luo Zheng had always been puzzled by the appearance of the Sacred race. According to Saul, the Sacred race was supposedly a powerful race in the divine land— they shouldn't have been secondary creatures in the universe created by a Holy Being.</p>

  <p>"Haha! Those warriors created by Murphy are mere imitations of the real warriors of the Sacred race. The real warriors of the Sacred race are the aboriginals of the divine land. After countless years of evolution, they've perished," Holy Jay explained.</p>

  <p>To that, Luo Zheng nodded and once again fell silent in the darkness.</p>

  <p>Having received so much information at once, he needed to take some time to digest it.</p>

  <p>Once again, Holy Jay gave Zheng's shoulder a pat. "You are Mike's only hope. Do your best. During the rest of the journey in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, I will give you many opportunities to improve your strength as much as possible."</p>

  <p>When he heard this, Zheng's heart filled with gratitude. "Thank you very much."</p>

  <p>"It's no problem! Your father and I are good friends. I even participated in the plan of your creation. The Divine Refinement Forbidden Land is also an extremely important link. I've been waiting for you for so long.</p>

  <p>You need not thank me." Holy Jay laughed. "Remember to charm the daughters of the Han Clan so they fall in love with you. Or at least, you should pick one of them.</p>

  <p>If you can draw their father, Holy Samuel, over to your side, our plan will proceed much more smoothly."</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Luo Zheng was rendered speechless.</p>

  <p>"I'm not joking. You should think of your father. You'd better make Han Liusu fall in love with you. She has the strong blood power of an ancient Holy Being— the Voiced Blood. If you want to avenge your father, making her your woman will make things easier for you," Holy Jay explained in earnest. "You must promise me."</p>

  <p>Never did Luo Zheng expect Holy Jay to be truly serious.</p>

  <p>No matter how difficult a task he had to deal with, Luo Zheng wasn't one to ever put his hopes in anyone else. Though his life was short, he never hesitated in the face of any battle. All he wanted was to cultivate and grow stronger.</p>

  <p>But this time, Luo Zheng fell into a dilemma.</p>

  <p>'Am I really going to butter up a woman for my own sake?' he thought.</p>

  <p>Patting his shoulder again, Holy Jay said, "You may leave now. I will arrange everything for the rest of your journey. Now, I have to go see someone else."</p>

  <p>"Who?" Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"You should know him. You both came from the same place. Hua Tianming."</p>

  <p>"Tianming?" Luo Zheng was stunned.</p>

  <p>Giving Luo Zheng a smile, Holy Jay continued, "He's taking another path, one that might be even crueler than yours— a path he may die on."</p>

  <p>"Why?" Zheng's gaze darkened.</p>

  <p>"Don't ask too many questions. What I've told you might not sound so complicated, but it isn't that simple, either. There are some things crueler than you can imagine."</p>

  <p>"But..."</p>

  <p>Holy Jay's voice grew softer and softer as the distance between him and Luo Zheng grew further and further until he finally disappeared.</p>

  <p>"Holy Jay?"</p>

  <p>"Holy Jay!"</p>

  <p>"Holy Jay!"</p>

  <p>In the darkness, Luo Zheng kept calling out his name.</p>

  <p>But Holy Jay gave no response; he had completely disappeared.</p>

  <p>Just then, there was another whisper. When Luo Zheng listened in close, he realized that it was Kaydan and the rest talking amongst themselves.</p>

  <p>"This is strange. It's taking so much longer than before. We haven't even found the exit," Kaydan muttered.</p>

  <p>"It should be around here, right?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think we'll be trapped here…"</p>

  <p>In the absolute darkness, everyone's mood fell. Perhaps there really was no way out of the black sphere.</p>

  <p>But right at this moment, they sensed another presence in front of them.</p>

  <p>Kaydan was the first to shout, "Who are you? Who's there?"</p>
