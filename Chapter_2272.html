<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2272 An Unprecedented Body Refining Technique </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Rachelle held a short machete in one hand and a short sword in the other.</p>

  <p>She resembled a gazelle in her stance and fighting technique, quick and nimble.</p>

  <p>Harold had avoided all of Rachelle's attacks with the simplest moves; he had been able to predict her moves as if he was able to foresee everything.</p>

  <p>They had faced each other in battle so many times before, and every fight ended in a life-and-death situation between them. They were very familiar with each other's personalities and fighting styles.</p>

  <p>But in this particular fight, Harold was much calmer and more focused.</p>

  <p>He dodged everything, ignoring all of Rachelle's attacks. It seemed that he was confident he wouldn't get hurt at all.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>Each cut of Rachelle's short machete triggered a terrible blood wave that spurted and scattered across the vast space. It was as if the very space bled with each stroke of the machete gliding through the air.</p>

  <p>The disciples of wealthy clans on the Floating Islands were awed at what was unfolding in front of their eyes. A scene like this was very rare, and only during an open battle between two consummate True Gods were they able to witness something like this.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, on the other hand, was tired of it. After all, he had witnessed much more terrifying effects of battles between Supreme Lords when he was in the Evolutionary Universe; this fight was not a big deal compared to that.</p>

  <p>However, it should be recalled that the Evolutionary Universe was still the inner world of Holy Mike, and it shouldn't be compared with the divine land.</p>

  <p>It was easy for those Supreme Lords to destroy a supreme world in the universe, but it was a hard task for them to turn a mountain upside down in the divine land.</p>

  <p>The exchange of blows between Rachelle and Harold was gaining speed at an alarming rate. The two of them rapidly circled in the air, launching from the ground. Without any warning, she disappeared from behind him and suddenly reappeared above his head. In an instant, a bright red blade radiance slashed down on him.</p>

  <p>"Space travel..." Luo Zheng's lips were pressed into a thin line.</p>

  <p>Perhaps Harold was not expecting this move from Rachelle, or he might have had deficiencies in his cultivation. As she slashed downward from above him, he had no time to dodge the attack.</p>

  <p>Momentary surprise flickered in Harold's eyes. Unexpected by everyone, he grabbed Rachelle's blade radiance in his fingers.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>How awe-inspiring the power of blade radiance was!</p>

  <p>When Harold was able to constantly avoid Rachelle's blade radiance earlier, its power just transformed into billowing waves of frost and dissipated immediately. But now, as he caught the blade radiance in his hand, its power poured forth, and he had difficulty fighting against it.</p>

  <p>Dark blue light radiated from Harold's hand. With the protection provided by the light, he forcefully pulverized Rachelle's blade radiance into pieces. However, his facial expression turned much more serious.</p>

  <p>He retreated and traveled quickly through space, as if he wanted to put as much distance as possible between himself and her.</p>

  <p>"Do you feel strange?" Rachelle smiled smugly, like a cat about to kill its prey. "Did your calculations fail you?"</p>

  <p>His head down, Harold kept clenching and unclenching his fingers. A strange look appeared in his eyes. "Well, I might have been wrong in some of my calculations."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did not react with anything when he heard this exchange. He wasn't able to understand the meaning behind the conversation at all, but it raised a huge uproar when the audience heard it.</p>

  <p>"I can't believe that Harold calculated something wrong!"</p>

  <p>"How could it be possible? He had fought Rachelle for so many times already, and he didn't calculate anything wrong in the past!"</p>

  <p>"Has the Mu Clan created some powerful method for Rachelle to be able to interfere with the accuracy of Harold's calculations?"</p>

  <p>"Wasn't it said that the cultivator of the Evolution Divine Dao could calculate anything even through chaos? It seems that Harold can't even calculate and predict Rachelle's attack. He's going to lose."</p>

  <p>Something clicked in Luo Zheng's mind after he had heard these words. He finally understood something that had been bothering him for a long time.</p>

  <p>How could Harold defeat Rachelle fifteen times in a row?</p>

  <p>He had used the Evolution Divine Dao!</p>

  <p>Mike was the first to completely comprehend the Evolution Divine Dao; his name became the first one that was engraved on its Divine Dao Tablet.</p>

  <p>After Mike became a Holy Being because of his use of the Evolution Divine Dao, many people flocked to the tablet of the Evolution Divine Dao as they also hoped to comprehend it. However, very few people were truly able to comprehend it; the Evolution Divine Dao was too convoluted. It was very difficult to comprehend, and even harder to use once it was comprehended.</p>

  <p>Mike brought people's attention to the Evolution Divine Dao and became a Holy Being because of it. However, only a handful of people really knew where he had gone to with the Evolution Divine Dao. It was very rare for Holy Beings to fight against each other in the divine land.</p>

  <p>By contrast, the Evolution Divine Dao that was used by Harold was more familiar to the True Gods.</p>

  <p>He calculated a number of factors that could affect the outcome of the fight. These included the opponent's height, cultivation level, strength, even the direction of the light and other environmental factors. He was able to predict all kinds of possibilities with one hand, and could even calculate the opponent's next move with the Evolution Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>Rachelle, on the other hand, had cultivated the Murdering Divine Dao to the maximum level. Her own strength was nothing to be looked down upon. In the entire divine land, excluding the Holy Beings and Demi-holy Beings who were stronger than her, no consummate True Gods had the confidence to say that they could win against her.</p>

  <p>However, Harold had already won against her fifteen times using his Evolution Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>Every time she made a move, Harold could calculate and predict her next move through the way she blinked, her heartbeat, her involuntary actions, and so on. He had never made a mistake before.</p>

  <p>His ability was revered as a miracle by the countless True Gods in the divine land. They had never seen anyone use the Evolution Divine Dao the way Harold used it.</p>

  <p>Someone even speculated that Harold could foretell the future using the Evolution Divine Dao. The reason why he had stayed in the Everest Spirit Mountain and didn't change his side in the war was that he had a premonition about the future of the Luo Clan. He helped the Luo Clan unremittingly, as he predicted that sooner or later, Mike would be brought back to life.</p>

  <p>It would not be an exaggeration to say that Harold was already able to calculate everyone's capabilities. But it would be outrageous to say that he could really foresee the future of the divine land.</p>

  <p>If a leaf fell from the tree, one could know where the leaf would land in the end if the height of the branch and the intensity of the wind were known. Even without using the Evolution Divine Dao, some gifted True Gods could do that.</p>

  <p>However, in the divine land, there were countless True Gods and divine citizens. There were also a multitude of variables that should be considered. No matter how powerful the Evolution Divine Dao was, it was impossible to calculate and predict the future of the divine land.</p>

  <p>But that wasn't important now. Harold had calculated something wrong for the first time in the battle with Rachelle.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad that your calculations were off," Rachelle told him with a smug look on her face. "Let that tattered Floating Island of the Luo Clan sink into the Time Sea this time. It's really annoying."</p>

  <p>As soon as she finished speaking, Rachelle suddenly launched herself into the air. Little rays of blood-red light faintly glowed and enveloped her entire body. Then, in the blink of an eye, she disappeared from Harold's sight again.</p>

  <p>Harold's left index finger was constantly being pinned under the clasp of his thumb, and the little finger popped out. As he was calculating, his expression became even more dire, as if he could not really calculate his opponent's next move.</p>

  <p>"Since you already know you are unable to calculate my movements, it would be pointless to waste any more energy in trying," Rachelle said in the void.</p>

  <p>As soon as she finished her statement, a thick ray of blood-red light appeared in the air. Rachelle's figure materialized on the other side, and a part of the blood light extended towards Harold's chest.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>By the time the blood radiance had dissipated, another shocking wound had appeared in Harold's chest. His body had been cut open almost in half, leaving only a sliver of flesh connecting the two parts of his body.</p>

  <p>"Oh my God! Harold has been cut in half by Rachelle!"</p>

  <p>"I've told you, the reason why Rachelle lost to Harold so many times before was because of the Evolution Divine Dao. If we would consider their real strength, it would appear that Harold is not stronger than her!"</p>

  <p>"I thought Harold was going to defeat his opponent easily. I spent all my money betting on him!"</p>

  <p>Looking upon this scene, Luo Luo Zheng also appeared a bit worried. Although Harold wouldn't actually die, would the Luo Clan's Floating Island fall into the Time Sea because of his failure?</p>

  <p>Harold's face was still calm. He extended his hand and gently pressed the wound in his chest; his broken body quickly merged into one. The shocking wound eventually disappeared.</p>

  <p>Harold then said in a stern voice, "The Floating Island of Luo Clan won't fall into the Time Sea. I had already defeated you for 15 times before you knew how to deal with my Deduction Technique. It must be those damned old men from the Hall of Holy Beings who put you up for this.</p>

  <p>You wouldn't have come up with these ideas on your own. In that case, I can let you and the old men of the Hall of Holy Beings watch as I tear up your bodies and trample on your Floating Islands in the future!"</p>

  <p>His shoulders suddenly trembled, and the clothes at the back of his shoulders suddenly expanded. In addition, his chest, thighs, and almost every part of his body began to swell up. Everyone watched this scene with curiosity and trepidation; even Luo Luo Zheng was stunned speechless.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the frail and weak young man transformed into a tall, muscular man. His clothes were ripped into pieces, and the veins on his muscles stood out prominently.</p>

  <p>"The strength source is flowing in his blood vessels instead of blood.</p>

  <p>How is he able to do it?" As he saw the situation, Luo Luo Zheng was also astounded.</p>

  <p>A True God's strength was not determined by the size of his muscles, but by the strength source itself. It seemed that Harold had displayed a new body refining technique that was yet unheard of in the divine land.</p>
