<br/><br/>

  

  <p>In the divine land, the Great Dominance Technique was a Godly Way that focused on the cultivation of one's soul.</p>

  <p>It strengthened one's soul and improved the intimidation from their Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>However, there was a prerequisite for the cultivation of the Great Dominance Technique— one's soul should reach the realm of Gold Fighting Soul. At the same time, one should also master the Emperor Soul Imprint.</p>

  <p>Holy Jay didn't guide Luo Zheng in the mastery of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng needed to comprehend the Godly Way and condense the Godly Tile by himself. Only by doing so could the Godly Way be the most suitable for him.</p>

  <p>Both Holy Jay and Holy Drew thought that Zheng's Emotion Closing Godly Way was not the best choice. However, what was most crucial was that Luo Zheng should make the decision himself, and they should not interfere!</p>

  <p>Additionally, Luo Zheng had obtained the Emperor Soul Imprint. He already had the precondition to cultivate the Great Dominance Technique. All that was left was for him to take a step forward.</p>

  <p>Maha had also obtained his Emperor Soul Imprint in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>Maha seemed to have a good comprehension of the Great Dominance Technique. The Mu Ning he released was mighty and hard to resist. Even the grand world lords found it hard to confront Maha. The Mu Ning from him was powerful enough that it could also affect the state of minds of Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>Although every Supreme Lord had the Gold Fighting Soul, they didn't possess the Emperor Soul Imprint. As a result, they found it hard to resist Maha's dominant Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, on the other hand, had the Emperor Soul Imprint. Thus, the Great Dominance Technique barely affected him. Even after he heard Maha roar, he was rather calm. He also delivered a sly smile on his face.</p>

  <p>The intimidation from Maha's Mu Ning continued to grow even worse.</p>

  <p>Golden light shone in his eyes as his soul power spread to the extreme.</p>

  <p>However, doubt could be seen in his golden eyes. How could Luo Zheng be unmoved by his Great Dominance Technique? A disturbed expression formed on Maha's face.</p>

  <p>Connie lay in Maha's arms and looked at Luo Zheng below. A curious look painted her delicate face.</p>

  <p>She had seen Maha perform the Great Dominance Technique before.</p>

  <p>When the Sacred race first attacked the Evolutionary Universe, Maha had fought against six world lords of the Humanity Alliance alone. After he applied the Great Dominance Technique, those world lords' minds were all affected, and they had no will to resist. They had been easily killed by Maha. If Maha wanted them to surrender, he could do it quickly. However, it would be meaningless since normal world lords were of no use to Maha.</p>

  <p>Back then, Maha had dealt with the six world lords with ease. However, with the current situation, Connie could feel Maha was very serious. He must have viewed Luo Zheng as a worthy enemy.</p>

  <p>Yet, why was Luo Zheng not affected at all? Was his soul made of stone? How could he be unmoved by Maha's dominant Mu Ning?</p>

  <p>Connie pouted her lips. Worry could be seen from her eyes. With the ineffectiveness of Maha's Great Dominance Technique, she thought Luo Zheng made Maha lose face.</p>

  <p>Maha roared several times and demanded Luo Zheng to surrender. However, Luo Zheng ignored the threats. When his patience grew thin, Maha frowned and took out a Roaring Token.</p>

  <p>The Roaring Token in the Evolutionary Universe could amplify one's voice and expand it to the whole universe. That voice could directly enter people's minds. Because the voice directly went into people's mind with the Law of Causality, no one could resist it. Moreover, it had an added effect on Maha's Great Dominance Technique. The combination would help him dominate the concentration of his opponents.</p>

  <p>Ever since Maha obtained his first Roaring Token, he became aware of its value. However, he hadn't used it to amplify his Great Dominance Technique before.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>When he activated the Roaring Token, Maha's powerful voice spread out again and reached every corner of the universe.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, surrender now!"</p>

  <p>All the creatures in the Evolutionary Universe were able to hear Maha's declaration. Immediately, they became hopeful when they heard Zheng's name.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng? Is he back?"</p>

  <p>"Where is he? Is it true?"</p>

  <p>"Have the Godly Geniuses truly returned?"</p>

  <p>It turned out that many creatures in the Evolutionary Universe awaited the return of the Godly Geniuses. Their cries were full of hope as they heard the name of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Most creatures already grew quite pessimistic and believed that the human race couldn't block the invasion of the Sacred race. They feared the whole universe would eventually be destroyed by the Sacred race.</p>

  <p>However, a small glimmer of expectation still lingered in their hearts.</p>

  <p>They still had the Celestial Position race, the three major forces of the human race and many Supreme Lords. Hope could still be felt through their army. The Godly Geniuses were still seen as the trump card of the universe. Luo Zheng and the others were the ones who would lead the world of chaos.</p>

  <p>In these three years, the Sacred race had expanded in the universe at an incredible speed. Their invasion was unstoppable.</p>

  <p>The Humanity Alliance had lost one supreme world after another. They had retreated to the territory of the Thoughtless Minds. Other than the elite warriors of the Humanity Alliance, their forces had been already depleted by the Sacred race.</p>

  <p>No one dared to be optimistic in such a dire situation. Despair had started to affect everyone.</p>

  <p>They could only expect miracles.</p>

  <p>Maha's voice, which contained the Law of Causality, irresistibly penetrated Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng fought against Maha's Great Dominance Technique by shielding his voice, this move of Maha would have some effect. However, Luo Zheng only relied on his own soul strength to resist the suppression of Maha.</p>

  <p>Since Maha used the Roaring Token, Luo Zheng decided to use his own Roaring Token as well.</p>

  <p>With a flick of his fingers, two tokens jumped into Zheng's hands. He gathered his focus towards the tokens.</p>

  <p>One was the Roaring Token. The other was the token of mountain which could allow him to get into the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>His pupils also twinkled, even brighter than Maha's under the golden glow. Confidence and pride could be seen in Zheng's smile.</p>

  <p>Maha's Mu Ning was that of a tyrant. Violence and harsh temperament flowed through it.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng's Mu Ning was completely different. His soul was upright, together with the admirable authority of an emperor. It made him comparable to the hope of a dynasty. If Maha was a tyrant, then Luo Zheng was a wise emperor.</p>
