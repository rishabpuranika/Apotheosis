<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2157 Eric Hulan (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The black divine might coins looked like both gold and wood, but they were neither gold nor wood. When they hit the floor, they made blunt and heavy sounds.</p>

  <p>About three to four hundred divine might coins fell down from the fourth floor. All those coins became scattered on the ground.</p>

  <p>When the proving godly warriors in the Brilliant Moon Restaurant saw such a scene, their breaths quickened, especially those on the first and second floors. A few True Gods also revealed an expression of interest.</p>

  <p>All their eyes were focused on the coins on the ground.</p>

  <p>Four hundred divine might coins were enough to buy two houses in Six-Burden Divine City. Such an amount was not easily gained by the warriors. To many low-rank True Gods, it was a huge sum of money.</p>

  <p>Although the warriors in the Brilliant Moon Restaurant were envious, no one dared to pick the coins up. No common warrior would easily throw away such wealth. The one who dared to toss out such a large number of coins must be very influential socially.</p>

  <p>Whir!</p>

  <p>On the fourth floor, a figure descended and silently landed on the ground. The eccentric arrival of the figure piqued the interests of those around him.</p>

  <p>No warriors below the top-rank True Gods in the divine land were able to fly in the air. However, one could still be creative as he fell from a high place. The man from the fourth floor used a clever method to reduce the force of the impact and descended just like a nimble cat.</p>

  <p>The man wore a purple robe and a purple gold crown. Redness decorated his lips while his skin was flawlessly white. Beautiful features similar to a young girl's could be seen in his face. Additionally, his appearance looked no older than that of a youth at sixteen or seventeen years of age.</p>

  <p>"No one dares to challenge me? You can at least try. If you win, all of these divine might coins will be yours," he said calmly yet with an arrogant tone.</p>

  <p>He had previously thrown a divine might coin to challenge Holt, but was rejected. Nonetheless, he still craved for a battle. Thus, a pile of divine might coins was dropped by him to trigger fights with other warriors.</p>

  <p>The divine might coins on the floor tempted those proving godly warriors. Many of them became envious. Their mouths twitched as they could only shake their heads. None of them dared to challenge the young man.</p>

  <p>"He's from the Hulan Clan."</p>

  <p>"You mean that violent brat? Whoever dares to challenge him is truly courting death!"</p>

  <p>"He is extremely strong, and he doesn't hold back at all when he fights.</p>

  <p>Dangerous is the only word to describe him. Breaking an arm or a leg is not a big deal, but we may even lose our lives if we fight with him!"</p>

  <p>The divine might coins were indeed great temptations, but their lives were clearly more important. So the warriors were still reluctant to accept his challenge.</p>

  <p>The Hulan Clan was one of the top three clans under the Han Clan's rule.</p>

  <p>It was also one of the few second-tier clans in the thirty-six regions. An influential background and powerful warriors were possessed by them.</p>

  <p>They had a close relationship with the Han Clan, and some of them supported the Han Clan on the Floating Island.</p>

  <p>The young man's real name was Eric Hulan. With exceptional talent and abilities, his potential was very great. He just reached fifteen years of age this year, but he was already a proving godly warrior. Eric's appearance was even more exquisite than a woman's. However, his attacks were extremely ruthless and lethal.</p>

  <p>He went to Six-Burden Divine City a month ago. During his battles with others, he had crippled three proving godly warriors while another one died. His techniques were simply vicious and brutal to the point that he became famous for the injuries and deaths he caused.</p>

  <p>The dead warrior was a talented member of a third-tier clan. After his clansmen knew of what happened, they went to reason with the Hulan Clan. In the end, the Hulan Clan only gave them some money for compensation.</p>

  <p>Given his misdeeds, the divine might coins on the ground didn't look that good anymore. It wasn't enough to entice the warriors around him to a rather deadly and dangerous fight with him.</p>

  <p>For some time, the restless atmosphere in the Brilliant Moon Restaurant quieted down. No one seemed to be interested in the coins scattered by Eric.</p>

  <p>However, after a while, a burly man walked out from the right corner of the first floor. He was eight feet tall and was as tall as an iron tower.</p>

  <p>Most of the people around were focused on the man's right hand. It was covered with a layer of brown scales which seemed to be the scales of some fierce animal.</p>

  <p>The burly man walked towards Eric and said with a grin, "I want to challenge you."</p>

  <p>Generally, the proving godly warriors of the clans of second and third tiers were on the third floor and above. The elite disciples of these clans weren't interested in several hundred divine might coins. Such money might not be worth their time or possible injuries.</p>

  <p>However, those proving godly warriors on the first and second floors were different. If they won these divine might coins, it was very likely that their fates would be changed. So it would be a reasonable risk for them. Besides, some of them had never heard of Eric before, so they weren't afraid of him.</p>

  <p>As Eric saw that someone had finally come up to challenge him, the corner of his mouth slightly curved upwards. A beautiful smile came across his pretty face.</p>

  <p>"What a handsome man! He is even more alluring than a girl," one girl said with a soft sigh. She was filled with envy about Eric's good looks.</p>

  <p>As two divine might coins flew into the air and shot out of Brilliant Moon Restaurant, the burly man didn't say anything else. He leaned forward and charged towards Eric like a ferocious beast. A malicious Mu Ning came out of the man as he attacked fiercely.</p>
