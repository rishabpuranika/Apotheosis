<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2590 David's Battle </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>A complicated expression was plastered all over Lancelot's face as he looked at Luo Zheng. The leader of the Yellow Emperor race himself was stunned.</p>

  <p>Now that Jerome was defeated, David was all they had.</p>

  <p>Lancelot had faith in David, but what if he lost as well?</p>

  <p>It was a known fact that the Nine Li race was determined to have the Sky South Bone Tower back, but Lancelot couldn't let that happen.</p>

  <p>Jerome walked back slowly, his shoulder hunched in defeat.</p>

  <p>David opened his mouth just to spite Jerome.</p>

  <p>"I've told you, Jerome, you against him is a total waste of time!"</p>

  <p>Before, David was pretty anxious to fight, but now, he wasn't in a hurry at all and even managed to put up a calm face.</p>

  <p>Jerome walked towards David just to glare at him.</p>

  <p>The intensity of Jerome's stare worried his sister Lisa. She thought that if it went on longer, it could turn messy. She hurriedly came up to him and said, "Brother, please ignore him!"</p>

  <p>"You're probably not his match either," Jerome calmly told David.</p>

  <p>In response, David curled his lips and raised his eyebrows slightly.</p>

  <p>"Don't assume anything yet. I'm not as useless as you are," he said lazily.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng hasn't even used his entire strength yet," Jerome warned him. "Are you forgetting that he's a member of the Nine Li race? He has yet to use his Nine Li Wild Body."</p>

  <p>That was true. Luo Zheng didn't activate his Nine Li Wild Body during his last two battles.</p>

  <p>That meant that he had not put his real strength in display yet.</p>

  <p>Even during his match with Jerome, he only used the strength source from the Nine Divine Stars.</p>

  <p>After all, one of Luo Zheng's real reasons for these fights was to hone his Wild God body.</p>

  <p>Jerome's words made David rather unhappy.</p>

  <p>By nature, he was fickle, and although Jerome's warning was in good intentions, it sounded harsh to David's conceited ears.</p>

  <p>"Oooooh, that guy is so powerful! I'm so scared! I don't want to face him anymore! I'm just going to admit defeat! Ha!" David was quick to change his tone.</p>

  <p>"You!" Jerome's face darkened.</p>

  <p>There was a helpless expression on the faces of the elders from the Yellow Emperor race upon hearing such snide remarks from one of their warriors.</p>

  <p>David was one thick-skinned, vengeful man.</p>

  <p>When he asked to fight before, Lancelot refused him. Now that they needed his help, he was going to make them beg.</p>

  <p>With knitted brows, Lancelot approached David and said lightly, "It's your turn to fight."</p>

  <p>David pretended not to hear him.</p>

  <p>"David, the Grand Elder is talking to you!" Jerome said.</p>

  <p>However, David didn't budge.</p>

  <p>Even as the Grand Elder, Lancelot knew he couldn't be too harsh to someone like David. Calmly, he said, "The Nine Li race is a force to behold. I didn't send you to fight because I was saving you for last. You are needed to defeat their strongest warrior. This Luo Zheng just appeared, and he is their last warrior. I had you on reserve for someone like him.</p>

  <p>However, the strength of that kid is beyond my expectations. If you fight him, you may not match his abilities. If you refuse to do this, I will not force you." Lancelot carefully studied David's expression as he said those things.</p>

  <p>The truth was, David was only reluctant to fight because of the argument they had before.</p>

  <p>Fighting someone like Luo Zheng was a chance he wouldn't miss.</p>

  <p>The Sky South Bone Tower was not David's concern. He wanted to fight Luo Zheng for himself.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing Lancelot's words, he grew anxious.</p>

  <p>However, he wasn't convinced that the Grand Elder was just going to give up easily. He narrowed his eyes and sneakily observed Lancelot.</p>

  <p>Lancelot sighed and intended to admit defeat against the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>But before he could even open his mouth, David quickly stopped him.</p>

  <p>"Alright, I'm going to fight? Grand Elder."</p>

  <p>A smile appeared across Lancelot's face. Even though David was quite troublesome, he was a simple-minded man. He was only pretending just to scare David, and as he had expected, he gave in.</p>

  <p>Ultimately, strength had nothing to do with personality.</p>

  <p>Despite his thoughtlessness, David possessed the talent and bloodline that were first-class in the Yellow Emperor race.</p>

  <p>Not only was he skilled in the cultivation of becoming a Wild God, but he had also achieved great things in his journey of becoming a True God.</p>

  <p>Elders like Lancelot and the exiles were closely related. They knew, of course, that a major part in the chaos was the cultivation of the True Gods which was also known as the Grand World Cultivation Method.</p>

  <p>However, their world was not suitable for the cultivation of True Gods, so there were only a few people who had created inner worlds inside their bodies.</p>

  <p>As time went by, most people had neglected the True God cultivation, and there were fewer and fewer warriors who cultivated for that purpose.</p>

  <p>However, the exiles in the Yellow Emperor race believed that David was special. Not only did they cultivate him to become a Wild God, but they also exerted great efforts to help him open up an inner world in his body and become a True God.</p>

  <p>David lived up to everyone's expectations and had done well in both aspects.</p>

  <p>Because he had the favor of those exiles, he got away with disrespecting not only the elders but also Lancelot.</p>

  <p>"Are you really willing to fight?" Lancelot asked, pretending to be astonished by David's decision.</p>

  <p>"Yes, of course! I will win that bone tower for our race!" As he said those, David's finger pointed somewhere. He thought he was pointing at the tower, but it was just an empty lot. Realizing that, he looked around and finally moved his finger to where the tower actually was.</p>

  <p>Lancelot couldn't help but roll his eyes.</p>

  <p>He knew quite well that David didn't care about the Sky South Bone Tower, so he just played along.</p>

  <p>"You are the hope of this race. Luo Zheng is a tough guy. Be careful, David,"</p>

  <p>Lancelot sincerely said while patting his shoulder.</p>

  <p>The final battle? Luo Zheng versus David.</p>

  <p>At first, the Yellow Emperor race boasted such a victorious force. They were so sure about winning.</p>

  <p>None of them thought Luo Zheng could win those two battles, let alone get a chance to face a warrior like David.</p>

  <p>Before his power became known to them, Luo Zheng was just a nobody. David was the more popular warrior.</p>

  <p>But before David's fame, it was Jerome and his sister Lisa who were regarded as the Yellow Emperor race's top two warriors. In the Immemorial Wilderness, people trembled in fear upon hearing their names.</p>

  <p>After he rose to fame, David became the more eye-catching warrior. The attention he received was monumental.</p>

  <p>"Finally! David has decided to fight!"</p>

  <p>"He is going to end that boy from the Nine Li race for sure! Right?"</p>

  <p>While the others bickered, David had already turned into a giant that was over ten thousand feet tall.</p>

  <p>With heavy eyes and a nonchalant expression, he carefully scanned Luo Zheng that was right in front of him.</p>

  <p>"Thank you so much," said David, grinning from ear to ear.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyebrows instantly wrinkled at David's words. He had seen David once and had always thought he had a rather odd character. At that point, he had absolutely no idea why he thanked him. "For what?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"If you didn't defeat Lisa and Jerome, the opportunity to fight might have not arrived for me and I would've come here for nothing," David said as he casually shrugged his shoulders.</p>
