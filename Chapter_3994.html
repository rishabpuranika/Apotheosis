<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>



  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Treacherous Being was not on-guard at all and seemed to have fallen asleep.</p>

  <p>Very few people had ever dared to venture into the Whining Road since ancient times. Not many were brave enough to challenge the Treacherous Beings after all.</p>

  <p>Nobody ever came through here, thus the Treacherous Beings did not see the need to be so vigilant.</p>

  <p>"Hiss, hiss, hiss..."</p>

  <p>One by one, long, thin threads crept up towards the Treacherous Being.</p>

  <p>Extremely thin to the point of weightlessness, these spider threads felt no more than specks of dust upon the body of the Treacherous Being.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, these threads covered the creature in its entirety. Every single square inch was tightly wrapped by the spider threads!</p>

  <p>Swoosh...</p>

  <p>The Black Sun in front of Thurston and Sawyer began to spin just as a strong attraction force burst forth from it.</p>

  <p>As this strong attraction force came out, it headed straight towards the Treacherous Being and dragged it directly out of the thatched hut.</p>

  <p>Its body was soft, liquid, and had the consistency of water. It had since lost its shape and had turned into something that resembled a mass of sticky glue.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>With no struggle on the part of the Treacherous Being, it was quickly and flawlessly sucked into the Black Sun.</p>

  <p>It was only then that Thurston and Sawyer separated and the Black Sun promptly disappeared.</p>

  <p>If one thought about it, it was actually quite amazing. A horrible Treacherous Being was dealt with in such a short amount of time and with no sort of violent struggle whatsoever.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi had to voice out his question through spiritual sense.</p>

  <p>"Has the Treacherous Being been sucked in?"</p>

  <p>Yasamin nodded. "I suppose."</p>

  <p>The Wing King then took his chance to slowly withdraw his wings.</p>

  <p>An open space was necessary to deal with a Treacherous Being. If it ever let out a howl to call out its companions, the Wing King would use the space to block off any sound, if it could block it at all.</p>

  <p>With their purpose served, the spider threads retreated and reformed into Pearson's body.</p>

  <p>"You two should separate further," he ordered Sawyer and Thurston. The Black Sun had never failed them until Zheng, of course.</p>

  <p>Even if the Treacherous Being was sucked into the Black Sun, it was best to be careful.</p>

  <p>What if it turned out that the Treacherous Being shared Zheng's ability? What if like the young man, it could also forcibly gather the separated Black Sun?</p>

  <p>If that was the case, then things would be very bad for all of them.</p>

  <p>Sawyer and Thurston did as Pearson ordered and walked further in the opposite direction of each other.</p>

  <p>However, Sawyer had only taken a few steps when a white mass suddenly emerged from his back.</p>

  <p>It was the sticky body of the Treacherous Being!</p>

  <p>Pearson was quick to point out this horrifying mass. "Sawyer!" he roared in warning. In a fit of desperation, he had forgotten that everyone had destroyed their hearing and only Zheng heard what he said.</p>

  <p>Sawyer had no idea what was currently on his back and of the warnings Pearson yelled at him.</p>

  <p>The white mass of goo gradually bulged and extended its body on top of Sawyer's head. Then two, hollow eyes appeared.</p>

  <p>There was no denying that the Treacherous Being had used some kind of technique to escape the Black Sun before it closed.</p>

  <p>"Up there! Above your head!" the Snake Goddess warned Sawyer through spiritual sense. Her words were firm but unlike Pearson; she knew how to use her head.</p>

  <p>Panic in their current situation was never a good thing.</p>

  <p>When Sawyer raised his head, he immediately paled.</p>

  <p>How could this be? This thing had attached itself onto his back!</p>

  <p>The Treacherous Being was a mass of goo and looked like a slug as it crawled on Sawyer's back. Anyone would get goose bumps just imagining it. When Sawyer turned his head, the Treacherous Being took the chance and planted itself on his face!</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish! Swish...</p>

  <p>The orifices on Sawyer's face were enough for the Treacherous Being to enter his body.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the mass of goo was gone and had completely entered Sawyer!</p>

  <p>"Sawyer, no!" Thurston screamed. A sudden rage erupted from deep inside him when he saw what happened.</p>

  <p>However, along with the anger came fear.</p>

  <p>Everything happened so fast. There was no time to react, much less help Sawyer.</p>

  <p>With the Treacherous Being now inside him, Sawyer's pupils suddenly rolled back and he stood completely still.</p>

  <p>The people around him immediately stepped back, eager to keep their distance.</p>

  <p>To everyone's horror, Sawyer turned towards Zheng and opened his mouth. He was going to start howling!</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>There was a flash of green light as the Wing King spread his wings and formed a protective dome above all of them.</p>

  <p>Fuxi and the Snake Goddess could only look up in desperate hopes that Sawyer's howls wouldn't wake up the other Treacherous Beings.</p>

  <p>Everyone waited with bated breath to see if the protective dome would do its job.</p>

  <p>"It works!" they all exclaimed when they saw the thatched huts remain quiet.</p>

  <p>To say that they were relieved would be an understatement.</p>

  <p>They couldn't be too sure if the space the Wing King conjured completely blocked Sawyer's howls but it proved to be enough since none of the other Treacherous Beings stirred from their slumber.</p>

  <p>However, they still had a problem.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, can you understand what it's saying?" the Snake Goddess asked him through spiritual sense as the Treacherous Being continued to howl.</p>

  <p>"It is being deciphered," he replied.</p>

  <p>Since the Black Sun's space failed to trap this Treacherous Being, then this situation had now truly become extremely troublesome.</p>

  <p>"Should we kill it?" Fuxi asked. Thurston was quick to shake his head.</p>

  <p>"No! Of course not!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Sawyer was his brother and there was no way he would be willing to kill him. Thurston would rather kill himself than hurt his brother.</p>

  <p>"What should we do then?" Fuxi asked. This situation wasn't exactly ideal.</p>

  <p>A Treacherous Being's strength was unfathomable and even if the warriors had an advantage, victory remained slippery.</p>

  <p>If they waited until the Treacherous Being began to attack them, they would be forced into a passive state.</p>

  <p>"I don't care what we do but anyone who hurts my brother will be my enemy," Thurston declared as he shot Fuxi a cold glare. It was obvious that keeping his brother safe and sound was non-negotiable.</p>

  <p>"Calm down Thurston. You must remember, that person is no longer Sawyer!" Pearson reminded him.</p>

  <p>There were so many monsters in the Three Purities Stage that had the ability of possession.</p>

  <p>The Soul-killing Flame for instance was one of these creatures. It existed in the Grand Pure Realm and could possess one's body if a warrior was not too careful. The Soul Leech in the Blood Swamp of the Supreme Pure Realm was another example.</p>

  <p>A warrior could already be considered dead the moment these creatures possessed their body.</p>

  <p>Since the Treacherous Being was infinitely more terrifying than those things then how could they ever hope for Sawyer's survival?!</p>

  <p>He was no more than a corpse now!</p>

  <p>Thurston shook his head in denial.</p>

  <p>"But...But..." he stammered and watched as his brother, who had previously been content with howling, suddenly rushed towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>"We need to act now!" Fuxi declared.</p>

  <p>Without any hesitation, he stretched out his hand and pressed it onto the ground.</p>

  <p>A mark of Eight Diagrams promptly appeared on top of Sawyer's head.</p>

  <p>In his determination to take down Sawyer, Fuxi exerted his full strength onto this attack.</p>

  <p>Just as Fuxi's attack came down upon the young man, Sawyer suddenly pointed up and touched the mark of Eight Diagrams. To everyone's surprise, it shattered with a loud bang!</p>

  <p>The attack, backed by Fuxi's full strength, was broken by Sawyer so casually.</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish! Swish...</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess also went on the offensive and stretched out her shadow's densely-packed tentacles to wrap around Sawyer.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, King Ieuan, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and Yasamin got busy with using their own unique skills.</p>

  <p>Underneath this green space, the collection of powerful energy and the pressure it released was terrifying. Any ordinary creature would tremble in fear.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the thing that possessed Sawyer was far from ordinary. The Treacherous Being had an incredible ability that dissipated any sort of energy sent to harm it.</p>

  <p>When Zheng saw Sawyer rush towards him, his eyes immediately flashed with determination. Instead of a retreat, he decided to face his opponent head-on.</p>

  <p>Eager to take on the offensive, Zheng lowered his body and threw a solid punch towards Sawyer's head! "Da!"</p>

  <p>Since his body had been transformed by the ancestry-level bloodline, it was a given that the power of his punch would be extremely terrifying.</p>

  <p>However, instead of the devastating results Zheng expected, Sawyer merely stretched out his finger and pointed it to his fist.</p>

  <p>The moment their hands touched, Zheng's power completely dissipated.</p>

  <p>His pupils widened and he immediately jumped back in retreat.</p>

  <p>"What the...? No. Retreat! Retreat!"</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, that was no longer an option. Sawyer was fast and immediately grabbed hold of Zheng's fist. He didn't seem to exert that much strength but Zheng found himself unable to break free of his hold.</p>

  <p>"Rumble, rumble, rumble..."</p>

  <p>At that moment, a stream of white goo emerged from the orifices of Sawyer's face. It was the Treacherous Being's body!</p>

  <p>Soon enough, Zheng found himself face to face with the Treacherous Being's hollow eyes and its strange smile. It looked at him up and down before suddenly jumping onto his face and into his body the same way it entered Sawyer.</p>
