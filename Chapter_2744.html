<br/><br/>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>With an almighty splash, the strange fish was dragged out of the sea of lava and towards the shore.</p>

  <p>'This doesn't seem right.'</p>

  <p>The fish seemed to think, confused.</p>

  <p>It usually didn't get dragged ashore until it almost finished eating the tentacle.</p>

  <p>After all, it couldn't escape if the fiends were so intent on catching it.</p>

  <p>The fish usually didn't resist. Since there was something it wanted to eat, it chose to satisfy its appetite first.</p>

  <p>The fiend who came to catch the fish was usually very patient and would let it have its last lunch.</p>

  <p>But this time, it had barely taken a bite when it was dragged up to the shore. How anxious these guys were!</p>

  <p>"So soon?"</p>

  <p>The Western Sea Monster was also surprised.</p>

  <p>Leland smiled and threw away the tentacle in his hand.</p>

  <p>It seemed to him that Zheng was indeed luckier than him.</p>

  <p>The strange fish landed directly on the beach with a plop. It looked around with its strange eyes, and the first thing it saw was the Western Sea Monster.</p>

  <p>Its eyes widened in humor. "Western Sea Monster! You? Ha-ha! How did you find the courage to climb out of the sand? You're usually so gutless!"</p>

  <p>As it spoke, the strange fish began to sense that something was wrong.</p>

  <p>Beside the Western Sea Monster stood several humans.</p>

  <p>"Humans? Human True Gods? How could they be here?" the strange fish screamed, its eyes filled with disbelief.</p>

  <p>This area was dominated by the fiend race.</p>

  <p>It looked like the only reason the human race would appear here would be if they were being controlled by the fiend race. It could be that the fiends ate people.</p>

  <p>The strange fish had a vague recollection of the fiends doing something like that before.</p>

  <p>Perhaps because the human race was similar to the fiend race, the fiends had been very interested in everything that the humans did or had.</p>

  <p>The human flesh was one of them.</p>

  <p>But they found it difficult to eat people.</p>

  <p>After all, although this fish was rare and was one of a kind at the moment, it would be reborn after being eaten.</p>

  <p>It had been eaten hundreds of thousands of times.</p>

  <p>It was a kind of food that was inexhaustible.</p>

  <p>And the fiends had to go to the upper stages of the Abyss Demon Region to capture the humans.</p>

  <p>The True Gods that dared step into the Abyss Demon Region weren't like the strange fish. They were few in number and if they were captured, they could only be eaten once.</p>

  <p>This was why the fiends wanted to raise human beings here, akin to animal farming.</p>

  <p>They would let the human True Gods give birth to babies on their own because once their numbers multiplied, they could eat them as they wanted.</p>

  <p>This was a beautiful wish, but the True Gods that had entered the Abyss Demon Region were members of the large clans.</p>

  <p>They were ambitious and arrogant. They couldn't even think of being raised like animals!</p>

  <p>They'd rather commit suicide than allow their children to be eaten by fiends.</p>

  <p>The fiend race could do nothing else but give up on this idea. They only kept a few human women, and asked them to serve the great fiends.</p>

  <p>The fiend race treated these human women well, even advising them on their cultivation and giving them a glimmer of hope that one day, the masters of the divine land would enter the Abyss Demon Region to rescue them.</p>

  <p>There were also some human women who caused chaos at critical moments, and chose to explode.</p>

  <p>So now, when the strange fish saw that the True Gods of the human race were here, its surprise was evident in the way its eyes bulged and almost popped out.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. Ask them why they are here!" the Western Sea Monster said helplessly.</p>

  <p>The monster and the strange fish were fellow sufferers. The only difference between them was that the monster wasn't as popular as the strange fish. They could not tell if it was fortunate for it or not.</p>

  <p>The strange fish stared at Zheng for a while before making a request. "Will you let me eat this Western Sea Monster? Every time I try, I only could eat its tentacles. I'm a little tired of it. I want to eat its head."</p>

  <p>"You!" The Western Sea Monster glared at it.</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled and said, "I want to know how to get out of here. The Western Sea Monster told us you are familiar with this place."</p>

  <p>"Get out of here?" The strange fish stared at Zheng, as if it didn't understand what Zheng was saying.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Zheng said, nodding.</p>

  <p>"That's impossible!" The strange fish chuckled. "I don't know how you got in, but it's impossible to return from the sixth stage!"</p>

  <p>At its words, Zheng's and Leland's faces darkened. "Tell us more about it,"</p>

  <p>Zheng said.</p>

  <p>The strange fish looked at the Western Sea Monster again and said, "You let me eat this guy, and I will tell you all about it!"</p>

  <p>"I'll eat you first!" the Western Sea Monster yelled, unable to stand it anymore.</p>

  <p>It was furious.</p>

  <p>Before it could do anything, Zheng had kicked at it and it landed on the beach over a thousand feet away.</p>

  <p>Zheng waved his hand.</p>

  <p>He drew a number of tentacles from the sand of the beach and dropped them in front of the strange fish.</p>

  <p>"Eat them and tell me everything you know. If we get out of here, I will consider taking you with me," he said.</p>

  <p>The strange fish laughed bitterly and said, "But how will you take me? I can't leave the Abyss Demon Region!"</p>

  <p>Like the fiends, the strange fish was also an illusory creature. They disappeared once they left the forbidden area.</p>

  <p>"The Abyss Demon Region is so huge, you can hide somewhere and get rid of your present fate," Zheng said.</p>

  <p>Although the fiend race was the top race in the Abyss Demon Region, they couldn't actually control the whole Abyss Demon Region. Only a True God could be a controller of this forbidden area; even the Holy Beings couldn't control it.</p>

  <p>The strange fish rolled its eyes.</p>

  <p>It had had this thought of hiding before, and it knew that hiding was better than being eaten here again and again.</p>

  <p>But given its limited abilities, it was near impossible for it to escape.</p>

  <p>The human True Gods standing before it seemed to be strong enough, which had it believing that there might be a possibility, however small, of its escape.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, if it failed, it would only be eaten again by fiends. It knew its fate was miserable and nothing that happened would be worse than the things it had undergone so far.</p>

  <p>"Okay! I'll show you the way out!" The strange fish agreed after thinking for a while.</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled and pointed at the tentacles, "Have them."</p>

  <p>The strange fish, no longer fearful, opened its mouth and gulped down the tentacles.</p>

  <p>But as it ate, it still looked at the Western Sea Monster in the distance.</p>

  <p>The Western Sea Monster knew that the fish wouldn't give up easily. So it turned and went down the beach. Zheng didn't stop it this time. In any case, its goal had been achieved. And now, the key lay in this strange fish.</p>

  <p>The strange fish gobbled down all the tentacles quickly. It was not until it finished eating that it said, "Right now, the great fiends are planning to leave the Abyss Demon Region. But they seem to have encountered some difficult enemies. This is an opportunity for us. If you had arrived before this, you wouldn't have been able to leave this place."</p>

  <p>"Leave the Abyss Demon Region?" Shock registered on Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>It looked like the strange fish knew a lot, just as the Western Sea Fish had said.</p>
