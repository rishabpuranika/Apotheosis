<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 737 Luo Zheng Started Repairing The Runes </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>There was a time when everyone would recommend those who wanted to study runes to go to the Ethereal Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>This was because Arnold, the Son of Rune, was born in the Ethereal Spirit Sect. Over hundreds of years, all sorts of runic experts had gone to the sect for further study.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the Ethereal Spirit Sect had consumed too much of Arnold's fame and didn't place too much importance on the study of runes.</p>

  <p>Gradually, Ethereal Spirit Sect's rune technique began to decline. Other than the sect-protecting array left by Arnold, the Ethereal Spirit Sect's rune technique wasn't special.</p>

  <p>Along with the rise of the World Commercial Alliance, as well as the continuous evolution of runes and the establishment of the Runic Tower, all the runic experts in the Central Region would choose to study runes at the Runic Tower instead of at Ethereal Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>The Runic Tower was the authority of runes in the entire Central Region, and these three people were the highest-ranked runic experts at the Runic Tower. Their knowledge of runes was second to none.</p>

  <p>When Nate said they needed three days, no one in the Central Region dared to say otherwise.</p>

  <p>Therefore, he dared to say, "If you can find a person in the Central Region who can fix them in less than three days, I will call him Master."</p>

  <p>That was why they mocked Zheng's ignorance. As the saying went, "Young people are fearless. It is because they are ignorant."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't get angry when he heard Nate's taunt. He didn't bother to pay attention to them and said to Dillon, "Master Shi, I can repair these runes within two hours. How much are you offering me?"</p>

  <p>"Are you sure you can fix them?" Luo Zheng had performed many unimaginable miracles. No one believed that a warrior at the Illuminating Soul Realm could make any of these miracles happen. However, Luo Zheng had done it. Dillon felt that he had gotten used to witnessing one more miracle from Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"I can give it a try. Even if I fail, it won't delay the match in any way, right?" Luo Zheng said with a laugh.</p>

  <p>Zheng's argument made sense. At most, it would delay the match by a few hours. If Luo Zheng was unable to repair the runes, the warriors would have to wait three days to watch the next battle. Two hours meant nothing compared to the three-day wait.</p>

  <p>Just as Dillon was about to nod, Nate and the other two runic experts stopped him.</p>

  <p>They didn't think that Luo Zheng would be able to repair these runes. In their eyes, this kid wouldn't be able to fix them in two hundred or two thousand hours, let alone two hours. The fact that Dillon actually believed Luo Zheng made it hard for them to accept.</p>

  <p>It was like how a chef, who had fed his master for many years, spent twenty hours cooking a great dish. All of a sudden, a brat who came from nowhere said he could cook the same dish in two hours. Not only did the master not shoo the brat away, he even agreed to let him try. This was a pure humiliation to Nate and his companions.</p>

  <p>"Master Shi, if you choose to believe that brat, then the Runic Tower won't interfere in this matter," Nate said coldly in a threatening tone.</p>

  <p>The other two runic experts were also not convinced.</p>

  <p>"Haw-haw." Dillon was very familiar with these people's temper, but he was not a person without courage. As the leader of the World Commercial Alliance, he had strength, vision, courage, and luck. After laughing, he said,</p>

  <p>"I think it's better to let him have a try first."</p>

  <p>"Humph!"</p>

  <p>The three runic experts turned their heads and took a few steps back. They crossed their arms and stared at Luo Zheng coldly. They didn't leave as they wanted to watch Luo Zheng make a fool of himself.</p>

  <p>Dillon gestured to Luo Zheng and said, "If you can repair these runes, I will reward you with this number." He extended his hand and said, "50, 000 supreme life vitality crystals."</p>

  <p>"50, 000 supreme life vitality crystals?" Luo Zheng raised an eyebrow.</p>

  <p>"Not enough?" Dillon asked.</p>

  <p>"No, no." Luo Zheng was overjoyed. Fifty thousand supreme life vitality crystals would equal 50 billion low-grade life vitality crystals. With so many supreme crystals, he could perhaps buy the entire Burning Sky Empire.</p>

  <p>The World Commercial Alliance was indeed wealthy! Although 50, 000 supreme crystals was a large amount, to the World Commercial Alliance, it was nothing more than a drop in the bucket. In this competition, just the entrance fee alone earned them 200, 000 to 300, 000 supreme life vitality crystals.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did not bargain. Since he had already agreed to the reward, he squatted and began to examine the runes on the stone tablets, one by one.</p>

  <p>Although most of these runes were three-star runes, a few of them were four-star runes. At Zheng's request, the World Commercial Alliance quickly sent over the materials for drawing the runes. Previously, the World Commercial Alliance had made these runes, and the quantity of materials that had been used had been recorded. With the abundance of materials in Oracle City, it was easy to prepare another set of materials.</p>

  <p>Grinding, batching, ink making...Luo Zheng was very skilled in these processes.</p>

  <p>When the three runic experts saw Zheng's practiced movements, their eyes lit up.</p>

  <p>Nate even nodded slightly in approval. Zheng's movements were light, meticulous, and precise. He could serve as an assistant in the Runic Tower.</p>

  <p>Runic experts at the Runic Tower did not need to prepare their own materials, such as grinding, batching, and making ink. These trivial matters were left to their assistants. But finding a good assistant was very difficult.</p>

  <p>After all, not only did the assistants need patience, they also needed to comprehend the characteristics of the various materials, and most importantly, they needed to be dexterous.</p>

  <p>From what Nate and his companions could see, Luo Zheng was very suitable to be an assistant.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng quickly processed these materials, he took out his runic brush.</p>

  <p>'This runic brush is pretty good. However, it's such a waste for a beginner to use this kind of rune brush, ' Nate thought.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had obtained the rune brush during a bet with the Cloud Hall's runic expert, Felix. This runic brush had been very precious to Felix, so it was naturally of outstanding quality.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng dipped the tip of his brush into the ink and closed his eyes to feel the composition of the materials. This was the most crucial step in drawing runes. Luo Zheng had by now demonstrated that he had all the qualities desired in a runic expert.</p>

  <p>After a dozen seconds, Luo Zheng opened his eyes and started to paint on the blank stone tablet in front of him.</p>

  <p>The moment the tip of the brush touched the piece of stone, a speck of brown shimmer flashed. As Luo Zheng moved the tip of the brush, the brown glow became brighter and lasted longer. The first stroke was completed in one go!</p>

  <p>When the three runic experts saw the first stroke, their pupils dilated. Nate even sucked in a breath of cold air. "Perfect Brushwork!"</p>

  <p>The fact that Luo Zheng knew how to use the Perfect Brushwork was known by many people such as Michael, the three leaders of World Commercial Alliance, and Xiao. But people of the Runic Tower had no idea about it.</p>

  <p>These people studied runes all the time and paid no attention to the outside world. They stubbornly believed that only they could represent the highest rune technique in the Central Region. They believed that the rune techniques in the outside world were not valuable.</p>

  <p>'How did a runic expert with Perfect Brushwork suddenly appear?'</p>

  <p>When they saw this scene, the three runic experts were shocked and didn't know what to do.</p>

  <p>A trace of coldness flashed through Dillon's small eyes. He had agreed to let Luo Zheng try because he wanted to deflate Nate's and his companions' arrogance.</p>

  <p>These guys were so full of themselves that they had become arrogant in the past few years. Even if the World Commercial Alliance was to ask them to draw some runes, they would ask for an outrageous price. They behaved as if they were indifferent toward everyone and acted like they were the number one in the Central Region. They had forgotten that they were also members of the World Commercial Alliance and had long forgotten that the Runic Tower had been established with the financial resources of the World Commercial Alliance.</p>

  <p>Now, they would understand that they were no longer number one in rune drawing in the Central Region.</p>

  <p>Zheng's rune drawing speed was very fast.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng was drawing runes in the early days, he needed to stop and think about how to draw them. Rune drawing was linked to the strength of a runic expert's soul. Rune drawing was rather soul power consuming.</p>

  <p>But Zheng's soul power was stronger now. A soul that had stepped into the Fighting Soul Realm was incomparably sturdy. Drawing divine textures was a small matter. Moreover, he was only following the original strokes on the stone tablet and restoring these runes to their original state!</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>The runic brush kept drawing out a stroke after another, and soon, the first rune was repaired.</p>

  <p>At this moment, as one of the Central Region's greatest runic experts, Nate could not utter a single word in front of Luo Zheng.</p>
