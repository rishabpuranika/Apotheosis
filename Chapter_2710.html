<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2710 The Disappeared Space Law </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Leland's group was high alert to the four-legged Earth Ghosts around them.</p>

  <p>But when the cave shut them in from above, they were surprised to see a person jump out before them.</p>

  <p>Taking a closer look, the stranger turned out to be a consummate True God. How strange, they thought.</p>

  <p>"Who are you? How dare you follow us?" Leland snapped, glaring at Zheng.</p>

  <p>As a Demi-holy Being, Leland had cultivated his soul to the Soul of Light� his voice was laced with soul pressure, bearing right down on Zheng.</p>

  <p>He wasn't expecting Zheng to be seriously harmed from it, but he was hoping to at least make the man dizzy.</p>

  <p>But Zheng only remained still, giving no response.</p>

  <p>The eerie reaction had made Leland kind of scared.</p>

  <p>If they were still on the ground, Leland would have taken action without hesitation.</p>

  <p>But they were now in a dangerous place. The walls were densely covered with four-legged Earth Ghosts. And Zheng looked like no ordinary person� it didn't seem wise for Leland to make the first move.</p>

  <p>While they were traveling, Leland had been aware of some kind of presence in the cave� he could sense that someone was following them, but wrote the feeling off as an illusion.</p>

  <p>"I'm not following you. You only happened to be a step ahead of me,"</p>

  <p>Zheng replied calmly.</p>

  <p>"You're lying! I discovered this cave myself a long time ago. I've used a magic array to cover it up� you're obviously following us." Cameron, a top-rank True God accused him coldly.</p>

  <p>With that, Leland and the other True Gods turned hostile.</p>

  <p>But Zheng merely shrugged, not caring to defend himself.</p>

  <p>He was well aware that the cave had something to do with the Stone Mouse.</p>

  <p>Harold and he had found the abnormal phenomena there first.</p>

  <p>But he didn't think it necessary to mention that fact to these people.</p>

  <p>"Leave him alone. The cave has sealed us in. We'd better find a way out of here first!" Jalen exclaimed, keeping a careful eye on the Earth Ghosts.</p>

  <p>After the cave sealed them in, the Earth Ghosts began moving.</p>

  <p>After a long moment of examining Zheng, Leland turned toward the depths of the cave, unwilling to leave just yet.</p>

  <p>The situation seemed too complicated. He wasn't going to break out into a violent fight with Zheng who just came out of nowhere. Choosing to prioritize their safety, he sighed and said, "You're right. We have to leave. Let's take a minute and figure something out."</p>

  <p>In the divine land, the consummate True Gods and Holy Beings rarely displayed the Grand Teleportation technique while going downward in the underground� it was too risky.</p>

  <p>The underground of the divine land was full of Lethal Fire Magma. If they miscalculated their distances while going downward, they'd fall right into the magma and be completely devoured.</p>

  <p>But it was a rather simple task to move upward from the earth's bottom.</p>

  <p>They could reach the earth's surface once they displayed the Grand Teleportation technique, after all.</p>

  <p>One Demi-holy Being and two consummate True Gods were powerful enough to bring along ten other people.</p>

  <p>When Leland was ready to leave, Jalen heaved a sigh of relief. With his mind, he intended to build a space channel.</p>

  <p>But at this moment, something strange happened.</p>

  <p>No fluctuation of space was triggered.</p>

  <p>"I can't use the Grand Teleportation technique!" Stress came over Jalen as he kept trying and failing.</p>

  <p>The other top-rank True Gods grew nervous and turned to Leland� he was a Demi-holy Being. If anyone could save them, it would've been him.</p>

  <p>When Leland stretched his hand out and gave it a wave, no space fluctuation happened either.</p>

  <p>"Impossible�" Leland muttered to himself, looking grave.</p>

  <p>The Space Law might have been prohibited in some places in the divine land.</p>

  <p>The Grand Teleportation technique was useless on the Time Sea and the Sunrest Tree, for instance.</p>

  <p>But the Space Law was prohibited on the Time Sea because of the Ruling Slate's restrictions, and only the consummate True Gods were forbidden� the Demi-holy Beings and Holy Beings were still allowed to do so.</p>

  <p>In the Sword Clan, Harper had used the Sunrest Tree to transform the entire region into the Non-combat Zone, prohibiting the use of the Grand Teleportation technique.</p>

  <p>While the Space Law had been prohibited, that didn't make it ineffective.</p>

  <p>But in the cave, Leland and Jalen couldn't activate the Space Law at all.</p>

  <p>It didn't seem that the Space Law existed in this cave.</p>

  <p>It was unbelievable� as far as any of them knew, there shouldn't have been such a place in the divine land.</p>

  <p>At this very moment, the densely packed four-legged Earth Ghosts that clung to the cave's walls crawled towards them.</p>

  <p>"Hiss..."</p>

  <p>In the face of these Earth Ghosts, a cold light flashed in Leland's eyes before five-colored internal momentum spread from his hands.</p>

  <p>At the sight of the internal momentum, Zheng slightly raised his brows.</p>

  <p>"It's the Five Elements Godly Way. As a Demi-holy Being, his internal momentum is really steady."</p>

  <p>Two strands of five-colored internal momentum met, producing a huge killing force.</p>

  <p>"Crack! Crack! Crack!"</p>

  <p>Hundreds of four-legged Earth Ghosts that were rushing ahead were suddenly kneaded together by the killing force and turned into a huge black mass.</p>

  <p>If a group of True Gods were kneaded by this force, they would easily be done for.</p>

  <p>But after another while of kneading, the Earth Ghosts bumped heavily against the cave wall. They scattered but remained intact. They rolled along the ground before charging at the group once again.</p>

  <p>"Hiss..."</p>

  <p>Everyone turned pale at the scene.</p>

  <p>Since even the Demi-holy Being was no match for these demons, the rest figured there was no hope for them.</p>

  <p>"Let's go! We have to run further down!" Leland called the others to him, waving his arm in urgency.</p>

  <p>With no way out, they had no choice but to move forward.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Jalen and Cameron were the first to run down.</p>

  <p>Seeing that the group of True Gods had led the escape, Zheng took a step forward and followed closely behind them.</p>

  <p>But as soon as he rushed over, dozens of four-legged Earth Ghosts pounced on him.</p>

  <p>"The Eight Smoky Melodies!"</p>

  <p>With a thought, Zheng's body became light enough to float naturally as he drilled through the cracks between the demons.</p>

  <p>"Ah!"</p>

  <p>"Damn it!"</p>

  <p>Just then, the two top-rank True Gods before Zheng were surrounded by the Earth Ghosts, including Cameron who set up the magic array earlier.</p>

  <p>Soon, they were bitten off into pieces� it was a horrible sight.</p>

  <p>"Help!" Cameron snarled furiously.</p>

  <p>The other one was already dead� half of his head had been feasted on by the four-legged Earth Ghosts. There was no chance of his survival.</p>

  <p>While Cameron cried out for help, all the other top-rank True Gods were busy running for their lives. How could they even think about running back to their deaths?</p>

  <p>Leland, Jalen, and the rest didn't have the slightest intention of helping him.</p>

  <p>Hearing Cameron's shrill cries, Zheng furrowed his brows as he floated in front of the struggling man. He gathered the force in his palm and laid a heavy blow on Cameron's chest.</p>

  <p>"Puff!"</p>

  <p>The force entered Cameron's body without hurting him.</p>

  <p>As he shuddered, the force spread out from his body, dispelling all the four-legged Earth Ghosts that were attacking him.</p>

  <p>With that, Zheng grabbed him and fled.</p>
