  <p>
</p>

  <p>A hoarse voice came out of the Chiyou statue's mouth which caught Luo Zheng and the others in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Who are you? Why do you have my sword?"</p>

  <p>After the shock had faded, Thimotheus, Leopold, and others realized whose voice they were hearing. It was Chiyou's, and they were more than happy to hear it.</p>

  <p>"Grand Chieftain!"</p>

  <p>"We are the Nine Li Guards, Grand Chieftain!"</p>

  <p>Timotheus and Leopold said in unison. They were practically jumping with excitement and fervor.</p>

  <p>They were not qualified to meet the Grand Chieftain in the Source World.</p>

  <p>They felt so honored now that they had the chance to meet Chiyou in person in the divine land.</p>

  <p>"Nine Li Guards?"</p>

  <p>Chiyou's voice sounded bleak and as stone cold as the statue. The statue looked around and, with no emotions, said, "I have given the Soaring Snake Sword to my daughter, Lorena. Where is she?"</p>

  <p>"Grand Chieftain, Princess Lorena is in the divine land..." Timotheus' voice trailed off. He paused for a moment before continuing, "I want you to meet your grandson,  Luo Zheng Luo!"</p>

  <p>Strictly speaking, Luo Zheng was Chiyou's maternal grandson.</p>

  <p>But it was a good thing Timotheus was able to quickly think on his feet.</p>

  <p>Mike, after all, was a divine citizen who didn't have the bloodline of Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>People like them would need to take their actual blood to know if they were related; their surnames suggested nothing to them. As far as the Grand Chieftain was concerned, Luo Zheng was his grandson.</p>

  <p>"My grandson?"</p>

  <p>The statue was almost twenty feet high. It stared down at Luo Zheng and reached out its hand to him. "Young man, show me your bloodline."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stared at the statue. He knew there was a remnant soul inside it, but he didn't appreciate how he was being pressured by it.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, give the Grand Chieftain a drop of blood quickly," Timotheus ordered.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stretched out his finger and, with a gentle force, a drop of golden blood dropped out of it and fell on the statue's hand.</p>

  <p>The statue looked at it closer and said, "You are indeed Lorena's child. Stay here. The others, please wait on the other side of the bridge."</p>

  <p>Timotheus and the others quickly did as told, hoping not to cause any more trouble.</p>

  <p>"Why is your blood no longer pure? I could smell a hint of Gerald in your blood. Why is that?" Chiyou's voice was still devoid of any emotion.</p>

  <p>"Gerald?" Luo Zheng's brows furrowed. "You mean the Chaos Ancient God?"</p>

  <p>Then, No. 9527's voice came out from Luo Zheng's chest. "Wow. Chiyou is truly intuitive. My master's name is indeed Gerald."</p>

  <p>As No. 9527 communicated with Luo Zheng, Chiyou pointed fiercely at Luo Zheng's chest. Under an invisible gravitational pull, a light green soul was pulled out. That was No. 9527's soul.</p>

  <p>"You are not Gerald himself, but a spiritual puppet created by himl!"</p>

  <p>Chiyou said in a cold voice.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, golden silk threads emerged from the statue's right hand. It quickly turned into a cage and trapped No. 9527 inside it.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 seemed unfazed as it said, "I, of course, can't represent my master."</p>

  <p>"What are you doing inside my grandson's body!" Chiyou's voice finally sounded less cold and more outraged.</p>

  <p>Chiyou didn't really care about Luo Zheng. He was more suspicious of No. 9527.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had the capability to enter the place with the Soaring Snake Sword which meant he was Lorena's son, but the strange scent of his blood suggested something more.</p>

  <p>"The reason is very simple: Luo Zheng was chosen by my master," No. 9527 reasoned.</p>

  <p>"What does Gerald want to do with my grandson?" Chiyou asked again.</p>

  <p>"My master wants him to be the Finale Hero," No. 9527 replied.</p>

  <p>"Gerald wants Luo Zheng to be the Finale Hero?"</p>

  <p>Chiyou couldn't keep his nonchalance any longer. He was obviously stunned. He did not expect such an answer.</p>

  <p>"I wonder why too. My master cherishes his bloodline so much. Why would he give his blood to a Nine Li member? Do you think your bloodline is nobler than my master's?" No. 9527 asked back.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 seemed to not care of Chiyou's status. Its master, the Chaos Ancient God, was of much greater status.</p>

  <p>"Why did Gerald choose him?" Chiyou stared at Luo Zheng in shock.</p>

  <p>"Why are you asking me? He was born and cultivated in the world created by you. My master obviously chose him because he is most suitable," No. 9527 stated matter-of-factly. "Now that my master chose Luo Zheng, he will help you. So why don't you cooperate with him?"</p>

  <p>Chiyou kept silent. He knew what No. 9527 meant.</p>

  <p>"Your name is  Luo Zheng Luo?" Chiyou asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"I want to see your mother," said Chiyou.</p>

  <p>"But I am unable to go out of this space," Luo Zheng reminded him. Otherwise, it would have been easy for him to fetch Lorena.</p>

  <p>Chiyou just calmly pointed towards a direction where a space crack broke open. Through it, green flow of magma was surging out.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't waste time. He moved swiftly towards the crack using the Grand Teleportation.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, a spatial passageway spread out from the depth of the ground to a palace on a Floating Island.</p>

  <p>At that point, Lorena and Mike had already travelled to plenty of places, rarely dropping by the Floating Island. The couple was thoroughly enjoying their travels that their relationship flourished a lot.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's presence in the palace confused them. "What happened?" Lorena asked.</p>

  <p>"Someone wants to see you, Mother," Luo Zheng responded.</p>

  <p>He couldn't care less about his grandfather, but he knew that, as Chiyou's daughter, Lorena had more respect in her.</p>

  <p>"Who is it?" Lorena inquired.</p>

  <p>He offered his hand in an invitation. "Come with me," he asked curtly. And then, looking at Mike, he added, "You too."</p>

  <p>He wasn't sure if that was the correct decision. He didn't know if Chiyou would be happy to see Mike.</p>

  <p>Finally, the couple drilled into the space tunnel built by Luo Zheng. In a short moment, they were standing in front of Chiyou.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, why can't you just tell me who it is?" Lorena was beginning to feel impatient. Then, at the sight of Chiyou, tears fell from her eyes.</p>

  <p>Chiyou's indifference returned. "What happened in the divine land?" he asked coldly. "Why is your body gone?"</p>

  <p>The Blood Body which Lorena was currently using was perhaps precious in the divine land, but it was never valued by Chiyou. For Chiyou, what he was seeing was a broken body of Lorena.</p>
