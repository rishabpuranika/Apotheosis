<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3523 Black Bear </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Creatures from the Other Shore resembling mole crickets, stood firm and held long bows. They pulled back on their bows and released a wave of sharp arrows.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng heard the sound behind him and turned towards it. He frowned as he looked on.</p>

  <p>The arrows weren't aimed at him and Feng Ge, but at the women of the Fragrant Butterfly race instead, killing them all.</p>

  <p>Once all the arrows had been released, a 10-foot tall black bear emerged from behind the mole crickets. He stood tall, strong and unmistakably domineering with aggression glowing in his green eyes.</p>

  <p>"The people of City Guard House are here..."</p>

  <p>"Good timing!"</p>

  <p>"The City Guard House and the Ghost Scorpion have always been at odds. I doubt they would offer any help to the Ghost Scorpion now."</p>

  <p>All kinds of creatures from the Other Shore chimed in their speculations.</p>

  <p>On the round terrace, Souls of Light of the Bearing race and the Jin Wu all smirked when they saw the black bear.</p>

  <p>If the Ghost Scorpion was not strong enough to kill Luo Zheng, the City Guard House should be able to do the trick!</p>

  <p>"The city guard!"</p>

  <p>"Squeak! Sir!"</p>

  <p>Several Ear Mice bowed respectfully at the sight of the black bear.</p>

  <p>The city guards were a special force in the Myriad Spirits City. Many races from the Other Shore lived here and were constantly engaged in conflicts with one another. Because of this, the city guards had created laws and acquired a considerable amount of strength in order to maintain the peace within the city.</p>

  <p>The Ear Mouse race might have been quite powerful in the south of the city, but they still required the City Guard House's support and naturally had to show their respect to the black bear.</p>

  <p>The black bear strode past the bodies of the Fragrant Butterfly women, paying no attention to the Ear Mice. He glanced at the dead Ghost Scorpion lying on the ground and cursed inwardly, 'Useless!' He then turned his glare towards Luo Zheng and asked, "Was it you who killed the Ghost Scorpion?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, it was," replied Luo Zheng indifferently.</p>

  <p>"Do you know what happens to those who commit murder in the Myriad Spirits City?" the black bear pressed further.</p>

  <p>Hearing this made the Ear Mice uneasy.</p>

  <p>One of the Ear Mice then raced up to him to explain, "Sir, it's the Ghost Scorpion that..."</p>

  <p>"Fuck off!" the black bear yelled at it impatiently and slapped the giant mouse away, sending it flying into the air.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the Ear Mouse was quick enough to jump off its back and avoid being hit.</p>

  <p>The black bear had no intention to kill the Ear Mouse. The giant mouse could bear the power of the bear's slap. Having only a Soul of Light, the Ear Mouse, however, was too weak and would have had its soul sent to pieces.</p>

  <p>The rudeness of the black bear turned Feng Ge's face grim. Silently, she lifted the long sword inserted into the ground next to her.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's face showed no emotion, but his burning anger could be felt in his aura.</p>

  <p>"Do you know the consequence of committing the crime of murder?" the black bear asked again.</p>

  <p>"No, I don't," Luo Zheng replied coldly.</p>

  <p>They were enemies, so Luo Zheng had no reason whatsoever to be polite.</p>

  <p>"By the law of the Myriad Spirits City, the killer should be arrested by the City Guard House and sentenced accordingly. Please come with me to the City Guard House," the black bear ordered.</p>

  <p>"The law of the Myriad Spirits City..." Luo Zheng put a finger to his chin and looked at the bodies of the Fragrant Butterfly women. "You had these innocent women killed. According to the law, how should you be punished?" he asked.</p>

  <p>It had never occurred to the black bear that Luo Zheng would fire back with that.</p>

  <p>His face darkened and he snorted disdainfully. "The City Guard House represents the law of the Myriad Spirits City. So what if I had these women killed?" he said with his head held high.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng sighed softly. "What you're saying is that the strongest around represents the law of the Myriad Spirits City. Am I understanding that correctly?"</p>

  <p>"Exactly!" the black bear replied confidently.</p>

  <p>"Really?" Luo Zheng said with a smirk cracking through. "If that's the case, then I'll represent the law here myself!"</p>

  <p>Before the black bear could figure out his meaning, Luo Zheng had begun rushing straight towards him.</p>

  <p>The black bear's green eyes widened when he saw Luo Zheng's terrifying speed.</p>

  <p>Now he understood how the Ghost Scorpion had been killed by this human!</p>

  <p>But the Ghost Scorpion was underground creature of the Other Shore. He couldn't compete with the strength of the warriors of the City Guard House!</p>

  <p>The black bear roared ferociously and stretched out a pair of sharp claws, slamming them as he attacked Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's only choice was to retreat in order to prevent himself from being smashed into paste.</p>

  <p>But retreating was not in Luo Zheng's nature. He continued rushing towards the black bear, and stretched his own hand out on either side, quick as a bolt of lightning, and clutched the black bear's claws.</p>

  <p>"What is this?" The black bear's green eyes filled with panic for the first time.</p>

  <p>Very few creatures within Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore were a match for him in terms of strength!</p>

  <p>But the grip of the human felt like he was being held down by two huge iron doors. He just couldn't move an inch from Luo Zheng's clutches.</p>

  <p>"Turns out that around two thousand three hundred Jun of force is enough to represent the law of Myriad Spirits City..." Luo Zheng's words brimmed with disappointment.</p>

  <p>The black bear gritted his teeth and suddenly lifted both his palms. Not letting go, Luo Zheng was hoisted up as well. The black bear turned and placed Luo Zheng in front of the mole crickets and roared, "Shoot him to death!"</p>

  <p>The mole crickets were all elite archers of the City Guard House. Their Green Kylin Bows possessed incredible penetrating power. The black bear had expected that even with Luo Zheng's super might, he would not be able to dodge the fierce arrows.</p>

  <p>The last syllable left the black bear's mouth and he was instantly petrified by what he saw.</p>

  <p>The archers and their bows were all broken to pieces, brown blood flowing among them.</p>

  <p>Stood beside the piles of fragments, wiping the long sword in her hand clean, was Feng Ge. She stared at Luo Zheng and said, "Let me test the strength of the law of the Myriad Spirits City."</p>

  <p>"Sure! Catch!"</p>

  <p>Without a beat, Luo Zheng chucked the black bear with an Other Shore Power as strong as three thousand Jun.</p>

  <p>"Swish!"</p>

  <p>The black bear flew towards Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was unable to bring the Shade Stone liquid onto the Other Shore when he was at Stage Thirteen. His physical strength was extremely limited, and the power that erupted from his body was less than a thousand Jun. It was enough to defeat weak creatures like warriors from the Separate Abyss race, but in the Dark Region of Stage Thirteen, such strength was far from enough.</p>

  <p>Even the Snake Goddess herself probably wouldn't have guessed that the one who would gain the most from reaching the Chaotic Source Realm would be Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>When Truth of Powerful Holy Body wasn't prohibited, Wild Gods could enhance their bodies with the help of the Body-strengthening Jade.</p>

  <p>Truth of Powerful Holy Body was later banned and powerful warriors of the Source World could only rely on Chaotic Source Spirits to cultivate their bodies.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng had accidentally brought the Chaotic Source Spirits back to the Other Shore, leading to his abrupt increase in strength at Stage Fourteen.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng could now easily exert three thousand Jun of force after reaching the Chaotic Source Realm by relying on the Other Shore Power of Civilization Artifact.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng had had such strength in the Dark Region of Stage Thirteen, he wouldn't have been that embarrassed, and he wouldn't have needed Feng Ge's help to flee that place.</p>
