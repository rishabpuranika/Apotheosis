<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Under Zheng's arrangement, all the members of the Sun Crow race had to stay in the Oneness Mountain for cultivation.</p>

  <p>In reality, however, they were simply on standby.</p>

  <p>The reason for that was if the Oneness Sky Palace ever encountered external intruders again, they would do their best to defend against them upon Zheng's order.</p>

  <p>Still, the only person those Sun Crows followed was the real Emperor Charm. After they knew about the current situation, they thought that they would never betray him.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Elizabeth stared at Zheng with an unreadable expression.</p>

  <p>Both of them were at the Holy Soul Realm, but the aura Zheng emitted was much stronger.</p>

  <p>It made Elizabeth a little confused. "Zheng, have you obtained the Holy Soul Imprint? How many did you get?" she asked.</p>

  <p>For her, it was almost inevitable for Zheng to obtain the Holy Soul Imprint.</p>

  <p>However, she didn't know how many Holy Soul Imprints he could get.</p>

  <p>Three or four?</p>

  <p>It might even be possible that he got five imprints.</p>

  <p>While Elizabeth pondered over the matter, Libby, who was beside her, answered first, "Zheng has passed through the Soul City on his first try and obtained nine Holy Soul Imprints."</p>

  <p>Upon hearing those words, Elizabeth's Soul of Light suddenly trembled.</p>

  <p>They even saw that the surface of her Soul of Light had fluctuated.</p>

  <p>"Nine Holy Soul Imprints? Then, what did you see or what can you do with them?" she asked in a shaky voice.</p>

  <p>Back then, she had gone to and returned from Stage Twenty-nine of the Other Shore so many times. Not even the Element Spirit race could unravel the secret about the Soul City.</p>

  <p>If Zheng obtained nine Holy Soul Imprints, then he might have obtained different opportunities.</p>

  <p>"He can open and close the door of the Soul City freely," Libby said.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Zheng glanced at Libby. He was slightly thankful that she answered the questions for him.</p>

  <p>Now, Elizabeth asked such questions just out of curiosity.</p>

  <p>However, he refused to reveal the secret of the Starry Roc-fish in the Soul City.</p>

  <p>"Yes." He nodded, and then continued, "There is a switch to the door on top of the Soul City."</p>

  <p>Only then did Elizabeth realize that she had asked something she shouldn't have asked.</p>

  <p>If she talked to another master or even Emperor Charm that way, she might get punished.</p>

  <p>Yet, Zheng had only avoided the topic.</p>

  <p>As soon as she came back to her senses, she changed the subject and said,</p>

  <p>"Zheng, you should stay in the Constant Glory Stage for now.</p>

  <p>Don't go to the Blooming Jade Stage." "Why?" Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"If you go there, the Element Spirit race would attack you. They would never let you set foot in the Land of Bone Tribulation," Elizabeth replied.</p>

  <p>Since she had followed Emperor Charm while traveling on the Other Shore, she had witnessed how strong the Element Spirit Civilization was.</p>

  <p>In her opinion, it was almost impossible for anyone to defeat the unbeatable Element Spirit Civilization.</p>

  <p>"Just because they will attack me in the Blooming Jade Stage like you said, I have to stay in the Constant Glory Stage all my life?" asked Zheng.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth was stunned at Zheng's question.</p>

  <p>"Some paths are destined to be difficult, but we can't stop because of some obstacles," he said indifferently.</p>

  <p>In turn, Elizabeth was silent for a moment. However, she had already expected such an answer from him.</p>

  <p>"If you want to go, please follow me. I'm very familiar with both the Blooming Jade Stage and the Element Spirit race. Although it's a bit risky, I can help you reach Stage Thirty-one of the Other Shore!" she offered.</p>

  <p>Libby blinked and said, "The masters of our Oneness Sky Palace will be there to meet us. He doesn't need you."</p>

  <p>Although she knew that Elizabeth had already surrendered and wouldn't attack Zheng, there was still a chance that she might do so.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth glanced at Libby, and then at Zheng. Zheng was the one to make the decision.</p>

  <p>"I want to get there with my physical body, not my Soul of Light. I'll be back after I change my form. If you have better way to pass through the Blooming Jade Stage, then of course I will choose the easier way," Zheng said with a nod.</p>

  <p>After all, his top priority right now was to go to the Land of Bone Tribulation. He didn't want to stay in Stage Thirty of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>If his Soul of Light ever went there in the future, then there would probably be a fierce battle between him and the Element Spirit race.</p>

  <p>"Then I'll wait for you here," Elizabeth agreed with a smile.</p>

  <p>After they were done, Zheng left the Other Shore with his Soul of Light and entered it again with his physical body. He continued to use the Blood Fog Spell to move forward.</p>

  <p>When he arrived at the star ring, Elizabeth and Libby were still waiting for him.</p>

  <p>"Libby, I'm afraid I'll be in trouble when I go to the Blooming Jade Stage this time. Why don't you stay here and wait for a while before going there?" he suggested.</p>

  <p>Libby just chuckled at him and said, "Well, I have also stepped into the Holy Soul Realm , so my Soul of Light isn't as fragile as an ordinary Soul of Light."</p>

  <p>"You do indeed have the strength to fight against a physical body after you've reached the Holy Soul Realm, but it is vastly different when you are against a truly powerful Other Shore creature. There is still a big difference between your strength and theirs. I suggest you stay here for the time being," Elizabeth said coldly.</p>

  <p>When she talked to Libby, she became as arrogant as she was before.</p>

  <p>Libby slowly answered, "Thank you for your concern, but I don't need anyone to give me any advice."</p>

  <p>"Let's go!" Zheng declared.</p>

  <p>He did not want to participate in such a meaningless argument, so he walked straight to the star ring.</p>

  <p>In just a second, Elizabeth and Libby stepped into the star ring as well and turned into white beams of light that shot upwards.</p>

  <p>From Stage Twenty-nine of the Other Shore, almost every stage had a specific arrangement.</p>

  <p>Stage Twenty-nine of the Other Shore had the Soul City, Stage Thirty-one had the Land of Bone Tribulation, and Stage Thirty-two housed the Eternal Scroll Painting.</p>

  <p>Only Stage Thirty of the Other Shore was considered normal!</p>

  <p>Therefore, the disputes in Stage Thirty had been the most intense since many chaotic eras ago. It was even safe to say that most races would fight for Stage Thirty.</p>

  <p>But since the human race was trapped in Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore and the Nihility race was always on the defensive, the Element Spirit Civilization gradually took control of Stage Thirty. A large number of the members from the Element Spirit race stayed in Stage Thirty, which they considered as their headquarters.</p>

  <p>"Swoosh..."</p>

  <p>The moment Zheng left the star ring, the turbulent cold air blew over his body and made him stiff.</p>

  <p>When Libby walked out of the star ring, she also felt that her Soul of Light was about to solidify.</p>

  <p>She would've gotten injured if it wasn't for her Colorless Soul.</p>

  <p>As for Elizabeth, she had already adapted to the low temperature in the Blooming Jade Stage, so she was well prepared.</p>

  <p>"What a vast ice field!" Zheng exclaimed as he looked into the distance.</p>

  <p>The ice field was boundless, and it seemed that the entire Blooming Jade Stage was made of ice. There were even rays of icy light that shone down from the sky above the Blooming Jade Stage.</p>

  <p>Zheng stared at the sky for a while and asked, "Is there another layer of ice above the Blooming Jade Stage?"</p>

  <p>He looked around carefully and found that the ice light above them did not refract from below. It looked like there was another layer of ice above their heads.</p>

  <p>"Yes, there are two layers on the Blooming Jade Stage. The upper layer is extremely cold and could freeze both Other Shore creatures and the Souls of Light.</p>

  <p>No one can cross the upper layer, so we can only pass through the lower layer of ice," Libby explained.</p>

  <p>In other words, all the living beings in the entire Blooming Jade Stage and the many temples and strongholds of various forces were all sandwiched between the two layers of ice. "I wonder what better way of passing through you have come up with, Elizabeth," Libby said and glanced at Elizabeth.</p>

  <p>A faint smile graced Elizabeth's lips, and she said, "The better way I mentioned is to pass through the upper ice field."</p>
