<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>In the sky, Luo Zheng flew rapidly on his own.</p>

  <p>He had originally wanted to leave with Zelda and Luther.</p>

  <p>Zelda, however, refused his offer.</p>

  <p>Approaching the bone towers carelessly could only lead to them being discovered by members of the conservative faction.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Luo Zheng had to go there alone.</p>

  <p>The Sand Core City was just a border city and didn't have any transmission arrays.</p>

  <p>After passing through this city, Luo Zheng would enter another part of the Immemorial Wilderness.</p>

  <p>This part of the Immemorial Wilderness was almost the same as Luo Zheng's first one. The wild bones in it had been exhausted after being collected.</p>

  <p>It was uninhabited.</p>

  <p>"There are so many Wights!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng remarked, looking down at the thousands of Wights that galloped along the barren wilderness.</p>

  <p>People in this world had three different origins.</p>

  <p>One was the Warden race created by the Chaos Ancient God.</p>

  <p>Second were the exiles who were prisoners in this huge prison.</p>

  <p>Last were the pariahs that lived outside the bone towers. They were evolved Wights who developed intelligence and could have the qualification of entering the bone towers if they were strong enough.</p>

  <p>"All the strong warriors in this world are afraid of the Light of Adjudication except the unintelligent Wights. Where did they exactly come from?" he mumbled to himself, remembering that he forgot to ask about these creatures' origins.</p>

  <p>The Immemorial Wilderness was vast and boundless. It took Luo Zheng almost half-a-month to cross it despite already flying at a very high speed.</p>

  <p>Half-a-month later, Luo Zheng finally caught sight of another city.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>He unfolded a map.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng paid one wild bone to buy it from the Sand Core City. It was well-made and recorded the specific locations of cities and bone towers.</p>

  <p>"The Sacred Bone City. There is a transmission array to Herren City!</p>

  <p>Herren City is also located on the same Immemorial Wilderness as the Sky South Bone Tower. This can be a shortcut!" Luo Zheng exclaimed, his eyes flashing with delight.</p>

  <p>He put the map away and went straight to the Sacred Bone City.</p>

  <p>Just like the Sand Core City, the Sacred Bone City was also on high alert.</p>

  <p>The guards blocked Luo Zheng's path upon sighting him.</p>

  <p>"Friends, consider this as my little token of respect," he said, turning his palm over and giving the guards ten pieces of wild bones.</p>

  <p>These guards' expenses were normally no more than three pieces of wild bones and ten was a fortune for them.</p>

  <p>Given that Luo Zheng's cultivation base was ordinary, he didn't look like the type to make any waves so there was no reason for the guards to not let him pass.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had no intention of staying in the Sacred Bone City at all. After inquiring about the transmission array's location, he immediately went straight to it.</p>

  <p>The city was hundreds of millions of miles away from Herren City and cost Luo Zheng one hundred pieces of wild bones.</p>

  <p>It was fortunate that he had a large number of wild bones with him and paying for his travel saved him a lot of trouble. It would no doubt take him several years to reach his destination if he flew. The Light of Adjudication would have arrived and Luo Zheng would still be flying. He wouldn't have entered the bone tower, let alone go back and pick up Zelda and Luther.</p>

  <p>Since the transmission distance was quite far, it took him three days to travel through the transmission channel.</p>

  <p>Three days later...</p>

  <p>A prosperous city appeared before Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>As per his expectations, he figured that all cities in this world were bleak and primitive.</p>

  <p>Other than the creatures living in the bone towers, the people here could only live for a thousand years which wasn't enough time to fully develop their cities.</p>

  <p>However, Herren City was different.</p>

  <p>This city was very close to the bone towers. Since the creatures in the bone towers avoided the Light of Adjudication, they could return to Herren City which meant that the light did not affect the process of the city's development.</p>

  <p>"The divine land..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng mumbled, raising his head to see the huge divine land hanging in the air.</p>

  <p>The huge bone towers also felt closer now, as if they were only several miles away.</p>

  <p>The towers stood quite high, almost the same as the length of the divine land. It would take countless years to climb to the top due to their sheer size.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing? Don't block the way!" Someone urged from behind him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng spared him an indifferent glance before quickly leaving.</p>

  <p>He wandered around the city, inquiring here and there for some information. After a while, Luo Zheng finally got the location of the Sky South Bone Tower which was apparently several hundred-thousand miles away from the city.</p>

  <p>After leaving Herren City, Luo Zheng flew southward for an entire day and night. Eventually, he saw a flagpole high up in the distance. Under the flagpole was a strange building, on top of which was a stone carving that stood more than a hundred feet high!</p>

  <p>"A man with three heads and six arms!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng remarked, his eyes flashing in excitement.</p>

  <p>"This is Chiyou's statue!"</p>

  <p>He had already seen the statue back in the palace inside the sun. The memory was still fresh in his mind.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was already aware of the dangers in this part of the Immemorial Wilderness. It was a place of abundant resources but it also served as a battlefield between the Nine Li race and the Yellow Emperor race which made it extremely dangerous.</p>

  <p>"This should be a stronghold of the Nine Li race..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng murmured, feeling a familiar comfort at seeing Chiyou's statue again. He landed at the building's gate with no hesitation.</p>

  <p>However, the gates seemed to be closed shut.</p>

  <p>People were gathered by the gates, some even leaned against the wall smugly.</p>

  <p>There was a hint of mockery in their eyes as they saw Luo Zheng and found out his cultivation level.</p>

  <p>"They are all very powerful..." Luo Zheng muttered to himself, looking at these people up and down. "They are much more powerful than the four Wild Gods I fought in the Immemorial Wilderness. They also seem experienced and are absolutely resolute in killing."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng waited with them in front of the gate. Eventually, he couldn't help but turn to ask the man closest to him. "Why is the gate locked?"</p>

  <p>The man had a narrow and long scar on his face. His mouth curled up at Luo Zheng's words. "What a foolish question! The gate hasn't been opened so it's locked. You just have to wait here."</p>

  <p>"Why do I have to wait here?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Another foolish question! Aren't you here to enter the Immemorial Wilderness? How can you get in there without the Nine Li members' lead?" the man replied impatiently.</p>

  <p>The man might have been very rude to him but Luo Zheng tried his best to be patient. "Isn't everyone with an Admission Token allowed to enter?"</p>

  <p>"Oh my God!"</p>

  <p>"What an ignorant boy!"</p>

  <p>"He knows nothing at all!"</p>

  <p>The people around him burst out laughing.</p>

  <p>The man with the scar, however, looked curious. "How did you get the Admission Token? You know nothing at all. How did you have the guts to come here?"</p>

  <p>"I bought it in an auction," he answered.</p>

  <p>The people around him laughed even harder.</p>

  <p>"So there really is someone who bought an Admission Token from an auction! How many wild bones did you spend?" the scarred man asked with a smile.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"You can get as many Admission Tokens here as you like. I'm only afraid that you won't live to use it!" the man announced with a booming laugh.</p>
