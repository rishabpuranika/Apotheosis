<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2534 The Fake Wild Bone </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng flaunted the wild bone and then stashed it in his space ring. He smiled and said, "Does this qualify for an auction?"</p>

  <p>Although the Falcon Caravan also held the occasional small auctions, its influence was not as vast as that of the large auction house in Sand Core City.</p>

  <p>Some of the most rare and precious treasures were on offer at the auction house of the Sand Core City. However, these belonged to the powerful forces of the bone towers.</p>

  <p>These impressive forces, which occupied the bone towers, were the creators of the world order. Normally, they would not covet something as small as Luo Zheng's blood wild bone.</p>

  <p>In order to place the item on auction, Luo Zheng needed to obtain a qualification for auction from the Falcon Caravan.</p>

  <p>The old man was puzzled by the bone.</p>

  <p>Although he had merely glanced at the black wild bone, he had also sensed the Wild God Power within it.</p>

  <p>This old man was a senior member in the Falcon Caravan. He had seen both the blood wild bones of the Heavenly Core Blood, and of the Nether Luminous Blood. The aura that emanated from them was completely different from the aura he had sensed from Luo Zheng's wild bone.</p>

  <p>But the Wild God Power in Luo Zheng's black wild bone contained a powerful undertone and was rare indeed.</p>

  <p>"Can I see the black wild bone again?" asked the old man.</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't think that's a good idea." A look of vigilance settled on Luo Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>Ordinary people who possessed such a precious treasure would not easily reveal it. The old man had probably understood Luo Zheng's concerns, for he grinned and took out a white bone card. Engraved on the surface was a lifelike falcon.</p>

  <p>"This is an auction qualification card from our Falcon Caravan. With it, you can gain access to the auctions at the auction house here in Sand Core City," the old man explained, handing it to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>It was the rule that no item could be auctioned without the bone card of a reputable trade group.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng accepted the bone card and thanked the old man. Then he left the Falcon Caravan at best speed.</p>

  <p>A faint smile remained on the old man's face until Luo Zheng left.</p>

  <p>However, as soon as Luo Zheng had left, the smile slid off from the old man's face, disappearing completely. "The origins of that kid's black wild bone is very special!"</p>

  <p>"What makes it special?" asked Riley. He had also felt the unique aura of the wild bone. But he remained clueless as to the black wild bone's origins.</p>

  <p>"It is neither the wild bone of the Heavenly Core Blood, nor that of the Nether Luminous Blood. That kind of wild bone has never appeared before. It may even be a rare ancient blood wild bone!" the old man mused.</p>

  <p>Either way, the old man could feel the uncommon aura emanating from the wild bone, so he was certain it was no ordinary thing.</p>

  <p>"Well..." Riley was surprised and at a loss for words.</p>

  <p>The old man held a high position in the Falcon Caravan because he had an extraordinary ability to judge the value of things. If he said the black wild bone was a valuable thing, then he couldn't be wrong.</p>

  <p>"So what should we do, Mr. Dou?" Riley asked.</p>

  <p>"You take some men and go grab that black wild bone right away. You can kill that young man if he resists," the old man commanded in a cold voice.</p>

  <p>"Kill him? Here in the city?" Riley was stunned.</p>

  <p>Fighting was expressly prohibited in the Sand Core City, and no one was permitted to break the rule. It was a brazen act to kill someone here.</p>

  <p>"Just be careful not to be seen. What comes after doesn't matter, even if the situation escalates, or the matter causes a stir," the old man said with a sneer.</p>

  <p>After all, the Falcon Caravan had traded for many years in the Sand Core City, and they were powerful enough to deal with any trouble, which might be caused by this matter.</p>

  <p>While strolling along the street at a leisurely pace after leaving the Falcon Caravan, Luo Zheng began to casually check the alleys behind him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng wandered around aimlessly for a while, and his face soon became depressed. "Why haven't they made a move yet? The Falcon Caravan is too slow..."</p>

  <p>A moment later, he noticed two figures appear behind him. They were furtively sneaking along in his wake, trying to get closer without being seen.</p>

  <p>"Finally, they are hooked..." Luo Zheng smiled and then entered an empty alley that split off to the side of the main thoroughfare.</p>

  <p>After he had walked deeper into the alley for a while, a masked man suddenly blocked his way.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's expression changed, becoming alert as he tried to retreat, but another masked man had blocked his way out.</p>

  <p>"Hey, guys. What do you want?" Luo Zheng asked seriously.</p>

  <p>"Hand over that black wild bone, and I'll spare your life," the person in front of Luo Zheng said indifferently. There was no emotion in his cold voice, and the Wild God Power within his body had built to a state that could erupt at a moment's notice.</p>

  <p>The same state of alertness seemed to be present in the man behind Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Both of them must be excellent and capable members of the Falcon Caravan.</p>

  <p>"Who are you? Are you from the Falcon Caravan?" Luo Zheng looked surprised.</p>

  <p>"Whether that's true or not, your question doesn't make any difference," the man in front of Luo Zheng said as he pointed at Luo Zheng with one finger.</p>

  <p>"There's no way for you to live unless you hand it over."</p>

  <p>'This man is so presumptuous...' Luo Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>He sighed in his heart, and then a pained look appeared on his face. "But it has cost me a lot of time and energy to obtain this wild bone..."</p>

  <p>"There's no need to explain to me," the man stopped Luo Zheng from explaining. Having spoken, the two masked men edged closer and closer to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Seeing that they were prepared to make their move, Luo Zheng reluctantly took the black wild bone out of his space ring.</p>

  <p>When the masked man in the lead saw the black wild bone, he ripped it from Luo Zheng's hand. After examining it for a while, he stared at Luo Zheng in confusion, and then burst into a strange laugh. "Strangely, I didn't expect you to relinquish it so judiciously!"</p>

  <p>Then the two masked men quickly withdrew and moved into the warren of alleys around them.</p>

  <p>After they had travelled through a few alleys, the man in the lead took off the mask from his face. It was Riley, who had previously led Luo Zheng into the city.</p>

  <p>"This is the wild bone that Luo Zheng flaunted before. Its aura is indeed very unique. Take it back to Mr. Dou to extract the Wild God Power from it.</p>

  <p>Let's see what kind of blood wild bone this is..." Riley clenched the wild bone and observed it with excitement brewing in his eyes. If it was really worth so much money, then he made a substantial contribution to the Falcon Caravan this time, and his status would increase.</p>

  <p>Not far away, Luo Zheng walked out of an alleyway with a faint smile hovering on his face.</p>

  <p>He had expected this rash action from the Falcon Caravan.</p>

  <p>The black wild bone that he had so easily handed over to the thieves was a fake one that Luo Zheng had forged in anticipation of their knavery.</p>

  <p>The Wild God Power was a very pure power, which had been inherited from the owners of ancient bones, and it had accumulated over countless years.</p>

  <p>This power was easy to absorb, but it was also easy to be altered!</p>

  <p>While Luo Zheng was in the Iron Tribe, he had infused the Truth of Goodwill and Malice into a random wild bone, making it exude a unique aura. He had then blackened the surface with paint. Thus, he had quite easily created a unique wild bone.</p>

  <p>Of course, this was not a special blood wild bone.</p>

  <p>After convincing the Falcon Caravan's assessor earlier, Luo Zheng could now take the Falcon Caravan's bond card to the auction house for the real auction.</p>

  <p>In order to protect all the trade groups, the auction house had adopted a system of anonymity. They only knew which trade group was attending an auction, and they did not care who actually owned the items on auction!</p>

  <p>Therefore, Luo Zheng had now ensured his own safety, and he also made sure that the Spirit Wolf God's blood wild bone could be auctioned without any hiccups.</p>

  <p>On this world, Luo Zheng had no friends or relatives, so he had to be extra cautious about everyone and everything. Fortunately, Zelda had given him some sound advice. Otherwise, it would have proven a huge problem to auction the blood wild bone.</p>
