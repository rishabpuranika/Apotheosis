<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Therefore, instead of fighting against him, the refiners of Illuminating Soul Realm changed their plan and would like to save the human girl.</p>

  <p>Oceiros had to stop Spencer and other human refiners.</p>

  <p>Everyone was so engrossed that they had overlooked one person who was lying on the light curtain, Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Silently lying there, Luo Zheng felt a hot mass engulfing his body. It was as hot as the burning lava that he had experienced before.</p>

  <p>The golden swirls had absorbed all the demon's holy fire and then converted to such a power that refined his body from head to toe once again.</p>

  <p>'Ah, I do not want to feel this again!' Luo Zheng cried to himself. He sat up on the light curtain and shook his arms to ease his stiff body. Then, he felt something strange in his chest.</p>

  <p>'Wow, what's this? A new spiritual texture is on my chest!' Luo Zheng was delighted to see this spiritual texture. Last time when he absorbed the fire of the Earth's core, he also found that a spiritual texture appeared on his chest, which symbolized that he had become the body of spiritual weapon. Now he had two spiritual textures on his chest!</p>

  <p>One spiritual texture represented that he was a low-grade spiritual weapon. If he owned two spiritual textures, he had entered the middle-grade.</p>

  <p>A smile rose from his face. But on the other hand, he was a little confused. According to the previous experiences, he must absorb the fire to refine his physical body. But how could he receive the same effect after absorbing the black fog?</p>

  <p>He felt more confused now. The black fog which he saw was actually the demon's holy fire. It was also a kind of fire, but a special one and few people knew that.</p>

  <p>Aside from the new spiritual texture, Luo Zheng found some other special things appeared on his body.</p>

  <p>Two streak of unique runes had appeared on his arms, and in the middle of each one lay a blank space of the size of an egg. He lifted his arms and studied them for a while but could not find any clue to why they were there and what they were for.</p>

  <p>But they looked vaguely familiar to him and he must have seen them somewhere before.</p>

  <p>He had just absorbed the black fog, and now he was caught in confusion.</p>

  <p>He closed his eyes and tried to remember from where he had seen these runes.</p>

  <p>After he thought for a while, he gave up and started to look around to see what was happening. He saw two figures above him. And Luo Zheng wondered, 'what are they doing?'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng still sat on the light curtain and looked up. Aldrich and Yolande were standing not far away, face to face. The way they stood was very strange. A ray of evil spirit was spreading forward and then was stopped by some invisible force.</p>

  <p>Yolande's life vitality was formless and colorless. Luo Zheng surely could not see it. But due to his strong soul, he could sense Yolande's life vitality.</p>

  <p>'life vitality against life vitality?'</p>

  <p>Though his mind was still foggy, he finally understood what was happening.</p>

  <p>After becoming a nature creature, refiners indeed could rely on life vitality to defeat the other side. Some would even cultivate to strengthen their life vitality. With strong life vitality, they did not need to face directly to an enemy in the battle. Instead, such cultivators would find an opportunity to drag their rivals to the combat with the life vitality. No actions, and no weapons. Just life vitality.</p>

  <p>Although it was dangerous, it could maximize the advantage of life vitality.</p>

  <p>When he saw the pale face of Yolande, Luo Zheng knew that she was in danger.</p>

  <p>She might lose in life vitality combat.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng wasn't that anxious at all. He smiled and thought that it was safe for him to stay near the curtain of light. He lounged on the light curtain, looking up leisurely.</p>

  <p>Yolande took a glance at Luo Zheng when he sat down. She then withdrew her eyes. She was focusing on the release of her life vitality and didn't bother to ask for Zheng's help.</p>

  <p>The first one to turn to Luo Zheng for help was Spencer.</p>

  <p>Blocked by Oceiros, Spencer and other refiners couldn't help Yolande.</p>

  <p>But with the power of the life vitality, he could communicate with Luo Zheng and transmit his voice even from a distance.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng! Yolande's victory is very crucial. It could impact the survival of White Emperor City. Could you do us a favor and help Yolande?"</p>

  <p>Spencer was aware of Zheng's dramatic recovery and shouted to him for help.</p>

  <p>On hearing this, Luo Zheng turned over from the light curtain. Spencer's inquire did have some impact on him and it sounded reasonable. In fact, if it was some other human being fighting before Luo Zheng, no matter who he or she was, he would have already gone up to help. His current behavior was just something related to what Yolande had done to him. So, he pretended to be an onlooker, crossing his hands before his chest.</p>

  <p>However, what Spencer said was true.</p>

  <p>If Yolande failed in the life vitality battle with Aldrich, the strength of the human refiners would be much lesser than now. Thus, White Emperor City would be in chaos and taken over by the demon. Luo Zheng himself might also die as he would be easily pressed to death by one finger of the demon kings.</p>

  <p>With all these factors considered, Luo Zheng climbed up from the light curtain reluctantly.</p>

  <p>Anyway, his slow move satisfied Spencer and other human refiners.</p>

  <p>However, their smiling faces didn't last long and soon turned to worried ones.</p>

  <p>After all, this was Aldrich, a famous and strong demon king, while Luo Zheng was just a young man who was only half-step to the nature level.</p>

  <p>They two fighters could not afford to be distracted in a battle of the life vitality as the rival might take the chance to attack.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng was so weak before a demon king. Aldrich might not need to spare too much of his attention and could kill Luo Zheng easily.</p>

  <p>Anyway, they never knew the result if they did not try. And now, they could only rely on Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The moment was suspended as all were looking at Luo Zheng, who was climbing up to the curtain of light and moving towards Aldrich...</p>
