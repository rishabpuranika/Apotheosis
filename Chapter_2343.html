  <p>
</p>

  <p>More than two hundred True Gods who had left the valley were totally oblivious as to what was happening with the consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>All they wanted was to leave the forbidden area. But if they were to follow the path they had taken earlier, they'd probably run into those Time Ghosts again. Thus, they had to find a different route.</p>

  <p>They didn't expect to see a group of consummate True Gods suddenly appear just as they came out of the Star Door.</p>

  <p>Some of the True Gods were overwhelmed when they saw the consummate True Gods. They thought that with consummate True Gods by their side, leaving the Time Sea Forbidden Land was a piece of cake.</p>

  <p>However, they were shocked to find that all the consummate True Gods were either injured or exhausted. It looked as if they had been in a fierce battle.</p>

  <p>Then the huge monster was seen on the first stage of the forbidden area.</p>

  <p>Some True Gods with lightning reflexes rushed through the Star Door and returned to the valley. The first one to reach the valley collided with Reginald.</p>

  <p>The top-rank True God of the Xie Clan entered the Star Door and considered himself quite unlucky as he was being targeted by the monster.</p>

  <p>Even if the True God had rushed through the Star Door, he was still caught by the enormous monster.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>Before Rachelle could reply to her sister, the outskirts of the valley shook violently and the sound of an explosion was heard, much to everyone's discomfort.</p>

  <p>She glanced at the east of the valley. "They are still busy fighting the monster. And they'll be escaping into the valley soon." Then she pondered for a moment and added, "Who possesses the Star Door?"</p>

  <p>"I do," Pascal answered, stepping forward.</p>

  <p>"Give me the scroll," Rachelle ordered.</p>

  <p>Pascal didn't like Rachelle's tone one bit. However, she was a consummate True God and he couldn't fight her. Thus, he sulkily handed her the scroll.</p>

  <p>"It's likely that they won't be able to defeat the fierce monster. Therefore, when they escape into the valley, I'll close the Star Door so that the monster wouldn't be able to enter," Rachelle said.</p>

  <p>The True Gods finally understood what was happening.</p>

  <p>These consummate True Gods had provoked an extremely power monster and were unable to kill it. Thus, they had to escape through the Star Door to the valley.</p>

  <p>The True Gods wore an unimpressed expression on their faces. Since their path of leaving the valley was destroyed, they weren't quite sure of what to do next. They were stuck in the valley.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng leaned on the side of the tree block and observed the turtles which were crawling towards them from a distance. "Dealing with these Golden Shell Turtles is the most important thing right now, isn't it?" he suggested.</p>

  <p>The Star Door had become a dead end, and these Golden Shell Turtles came towards them from all the directions. Although they were slow, they'd be able to catch up with them nonetheless.</p>

  <p>The True Gods were unsure as to what to do. They became alert when Luo Zheng reminded them. Some of the True Gods felt like weeping, as they still had to deal with the ferocious beasts in the valley.</p>

  <p>Howl!</p>

  <p>As soon as Luo Zheng finished speaking, a furious roar was heard from the outside of the valley. Then a blazing fire was seen outside the entrance in the east of the valley.</p>

  <p>"You go in first, I'll cover you," someone shouted. Although the person was quite far, Luo Zheng and the rest heard him clearly.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>The consummate True Gods rushed in one after the other through the center of the Star Door. Within seconds, dozens of consummate True Gods were in the valley.</p>

  <p>"Father!" Kelsey looked over her shoulder and saw a man who was badly burnt.</p>

  <p>One of the consummate True Gods was none other than Alfredo, the head of the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>"Sir," Pascal and Aleyna greeted him.</p>

  <p>Like Rachelle, these consummate True Gods looked hurt. However, they weren't breathing heavily, and they had a spark of determination in their eyes. They didn't seem to be seriously injured.</p>

  <p>These consummate True Gods were either the heads or leading roles of the powerful clans on the Floating Islands, like Rachelle. The True Gods seemed much calmer than before as they joined the consummate True Gods of their respective clans.</p>

  <p>"Rachelle, you coward! You were the only one who ran away from the battle. You almost had us killed," Walton shouted in a fit of anger.</p>

  <p>Rachelle remained calm and said, "It's common sense, Walton. If the monster goes berserk, you have to retreat."</p>

  <p>"You really shouldn't have left us there." A man dressed in white and holding a paper fan also contributed to the discussion. He was none other than Shahn, the consummate True God of the Fang Clan.</p>

  <p>"If you hadn't left and we had tried a little bit more, we might have been able to kill the monster," another consummate True God pitched in. He was the consummate True God of the Sword Clan.</p>

  <p>Watching everyone make her the scapegoat, Rachelle rolled her eyes and didn't bat an eye. She counted the number of people present, making sure that no consummate True God was left behind. Then she walked towards the Star Door with Pascal's scroll in her hands.</p>

  <p>Just as she walked up to the Star Door, the center of the Star Door began to shake again and the black three-toed claw thrust through the Star Door again.</p>

  <p>"Humph!</p>

  <p>Not this again!"</p>

  <p>Rachelle snorted. Her eyes burning with rage, she pulled out a sword and slashed at the three-toed claw.</p>

  <p>The three-toed claw had pulled the True God of the Xie Clan out through the Star Door. Even Luo Zheng and other True Gods weren't able to do anything. But Rachelle's sword cut a deep wound in the sharp claw. The wound was so deep that even the bone was visible.</p>

  <p>The claw couldn't withhold Rachelle's attack and was seen retreating through the Star Door.</p>

  <p>Rachelle then gently waved the scroll and the Star Door disappeared completely. At the same time, the scroll also turned into small pieces, completely dissipating.</p>

  <p>Howl! Howl!</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>At the same time, they heard a roar coming from the entrance in the east of the valley. A huge monster was pounding on the light curtain. But the light curtain didn't cave in and the monster was unable to enter the valley.</p>

  <p>Rachelle looked at the monster and said, "It's still in the stage of madness. We can hide in the valley for a while, and we can kill it after it has cooled down."</p>

  <p>"Hide in the valley for a while?" A tall consummate True God threw a look at the Golden Shell Turtles which weren't far away. "It's not easy to deal with these Golden Shell Turtles, you know."</p>

  <p>It was quite easy for the consummate True Gods to fight against the Abyss Demons and Soul-killing Ghosts.</p>

  <p>Some consummate True Gods were able to kill the Abyss Demons solely alone.</p>

  <p>The Soul-killing Ghosts were much easier to deal with. The souls of some consummate True Gods had reached consummation too and had become Souls of Light. If one's soul was really hooked out by a Soul-killing Ghost, they could crush the Soul-killing Ghost by using their soul.</p>

  <p>But the Golden Shell Turtles were something else and were quite troublesome.</p>

  <p>The Golden Shell Turtles were able to reflect almost all the attacks with their shells.</p>

  <p>The stronger one attacked a Golden Shell Turtle, the stronger it would bounce back the attack.</p>

  <p>"It's not that difficult. I have killed loads of these in the Everest Spirit Mountain," a consummate True God of the Zhao Clan said, walking towards the Golden Shell Turtles with a golden saber in his hand.</p>

  <p>According to him, the Golden Shell Turtles were annoying, but they could be dealt with easily.</p>

  <p>With the presence of the consummate True Gods in their midst, the True Gods such as Reginald, Soren and Pascal all calmed down.</p>

  <p>However, once they passed the trial of the Goddess Statue, the light curtain that isolated the valley would disappear, and the monster outside would be able to enter the valley. Thus, they'd have to deal with it as well. Everyone knew that it was essential to be prepared for the monster.</p>

  <p>While the True Gods were pondering over the ongoing situation, the consummate True God of the Zhao Clan had already waved his large saber towards the Golden Shell Turtles.</p>

  <p>This man from the Zhao Clan was Naylor Zhao. He was a powerful man, and thus, he could easily deal with the Golden Shell Turtles.</p>

  <p>With one strike of his saber, he killed three Golden Shell Turtles.</p>

  <p>But suddenly, a white light curtain appeared from each of the Golden Shell Turtles' shells, shot back the blade lights and bounced back Naylor Zhao's attack.</p>

  <p>Puff! Puff! Puff!</p>

  <p>The blade lights weren't enough to cause him any harm. Thus, he didn't try to dodge them.</p>

  <p>After Naylor Zhao killed the Golden Shell Turtles, three balls of blood red fog arose from the bodies of the Golden Shell Turtles, and strong power of blood energy suddenly penetrated his body.</p>

  <p>Other consummate True Gods stood still under the Goddess Statue and didn't move.</p>

  <p>Now that they had already reached the current cultivation base, they weren't interested in any ordinary reward. However, they were in awe when they watched what Naylor Zhao got.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes flashed when he saw the blood energy.</p>
