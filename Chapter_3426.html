<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Li Shan mountain was a formidable group, and no one ever underestimated them. Yet it still shocked many when Yan was able to blow Khalid away in a single move.</p>

  <p>After all, Khalid was the best talent of the Bearing race. Perhaps he had been careless because he underestimated Yan. But it was still difficult to comprehend how easily she had overpowered him.</p>

  <p>Yan didn't miss a beat. Immediately after repelling Khalid, she flipped and shot up into the air, heading in the direction where Mya and Mount had landed.</p>

  <p>"What a woman..."</p>

  <p>A wicked smile formed on Mya's face. Her curly hair seemed to expand, framing her face like a dark cloud as it enveloped Yan.</p>

  <p>Her beautiful curls looked soft and glossy, but they contained a terrible killing intent.</p>

  <p>Once Yan got entangled in her curls, she would have at least a hundred ways to tear Yan into pieces.</p>

  <p>Yan, however, had no fear in her expression as she confronted Mya's black cloud of hair. She counterattacked boldly and directly.</p>

  <p>"The Truth of Holy Words!"</p>

  <p>"Break!"</p>

  <p>"Split!"</p>

  <p>"Slash!"</p>

  <p>As soon as Yan uttered the word "break," Mya's hair was cut into pieces flying haphazardly in all directions.</p>

  <p>Would it be this easy to break Mya's hair?</p>

  <p>With a flash in mind, Mya seemed to infuse her broken hairs with a kind of spirit. They began flying back towards each other, forming another cloud-like mass. They were about to return to Mya when Yan said, "Split!" Her command shattered the spirit animating the hairs, and the broken strands fell apart, no longer connected.</p>

  <p>When Yan spoke the word "slash", Mya began to tremble with fear. She could feel a sharp slashing force coming from the void. If it hit her, she would be killed undoubtedly.</p>

  <p>Before the blow landed, she felt someone grab her and jerk her backwards.</p>

  <p>It was Mount. "You're no match for her. Let me help you," he said.</p>

  <p>Mount quickly stood in front of Mya as the invisible slashing force slashed at him.</p>

  <p>Mount stayed calm. He stood still, his body glowing with a ray of khaki light, as he punched the air at a strange angle.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>When Yan heard the booming sound, she realized that her "slash" command had failed. Mount had easily fended off the slashing attack.</p>

  <p>"You're no match for me. Don't waste your time," Mount said, looking down at Yan.</p>

  <p>In the Chaotic Source World, the struggles were fierce between various races, but almost everyone made an effort to avoid facing Mount.</p>

  <p>But after all, the Chaotic Source World was created by the Snake Goddess race. If they went too far in bullying those from the Li Shan mountain, they might not get a good result after leaving the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>Mount was insightful, and he had a way of perceiving things that other people couldn't. He saw at a glance that Yan was unusual.</p>

  <p>If he killed Yan here, he would probably cause some unnecessary trouble.</p>

  <p>Mya, who was still being shielded by Mount, stepped forward again, her face filled with hatred.</p>

  <p>It was hard for most women to accept defeat at the hands of a more beautiful woman. And Mya was no exception. "Uncle Mount, she attacked me. Kill her!"</p>

  <p>Mya was expecting Mount to agree, so she was surprised when he shook his head. "I can't kill her. If I try, members of the Li Shan mountain will definitely break into the Chaotic Source World to stop me."</p>

  <p>"Will the Li Shan mountain break the rules for her?" Mya said coldly, still looking for a way to get revenge on Yan.</p>

  <p>"They wouldn't break the rules for just anyone in the past. But for her, and at this moment in time, I feel that they will," Mount said firmly.</p>

  <p>Since the Chaotic Source World had been established, the Li Shan mountain and other races in the Source World had always followed the rules that had been agreed upon. This established consensus was the foundation for the stability of the Chaotic Source World, and the reason it had lasted for so many years.</p>

  <p>However, it was the last time that the Chaotic Source World would ever open. It no longer mattered if the Li Shan mountain broke the rules.</p>

  <p>Mount thought his logic was unassailable.</p>

  <p>He sought to obtain the maximum benefit that he could from his time in the Chaotic Source World. He wouldn't be as emotional as Khalid and Mya.</p>

  <p>Mount's words made Yan even more determined, and she stood her ground.</p>

  <p>"Let my brother go or I won't give up!" she said in a low growl.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, there were sounds of people flying swiftly through the air. dozens of figures rushed towards them.</p>

  <p>Natalie and Six Snake Shadows circled vigilantly around Yan. The other members of the Snake Goddess race hovered near Mount, carefully watching him. He was very powerful, but he wouldn't be able to withstand their united attack by himself.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The sight of the members of the Snake Goddess race spurred the disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace into action. They rushed to confront Mount too.</p>

  <p>Although Feng Ge and Dorothy knew that it would be difficult to force Mount to release Luo Zheng, they had to give it a try. Moreover, people from the Bearing race, the Jin Wu and the Divine Farmer race had all been swept away by the hurricane. Only Mount, Mya, and Khalid who had been injured were here. They might have a chance to beat these three people, as they were greater in number.</p>

  <p>"The Taiyi Heaven Palace won't shrink back," said Feng Ge grimly, a determined look in her eyes.</p>

  <p>As they squared off against each other, the atmosphere grew thick with tension.</p>

  <p>Below, the Separate Abyss race and the Ear Mouse race were leading the other races in an attack against the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>The Separate Abyss race was the happiest with this situation. The Taiyi Heaven Palace, the Li Shan mountain, the Bearing race, the Jin Wu, and the Divine Farmer race were all competing for the Chaotic Source Spirits. But because of Luo Zheng, before they could even try to get to the crystals, they had to fight each other first.</p>

  <p>The Separate Abyss race were quick to take the opportunity to kill the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits. If they succeeded, they would be the greatest beneficiaries of the ongoing conflict.</p>

  <p>In fact, the Ear Mice were also very concerned about Luo Zheng. However, they and Luo Zheng were merely taking advantage of each other, so they did not feel that this was a battle they needed to be involved in.</p>

  <p>The Evil God stood in the shadow of a huge crater on the ground.</p>

  <p>"Are they going to fight? Interesting...!" The Evil God couldn't contain his excitement, and his desire to join the fray was evident on his gleeful face.</p>

  <p>His own instincts told him that Mount was overwhelmingly powerful. He thought not even the combined forces of the Taiyi Heaven Palace and the Li Shan mountain could defeat this man.</p>

  <p>The Evil God was not sure how he himself would fare against Mount.</p>

  <p>But he had been hiding in the dark for a long period of time. If he seized this opportunity, he might have a chance...</p>

  <p>Mount looked around at the assembled warriors. He shook his head and said to Yan, "It's not that I don't want to let him go. It's just that? well, he has completely disappeared."</p>

  <p>Yan heard only his refusal. "So you won't release Luo Zheng?" she asked, squinting. A ray of dangerous light shone from her eyes.</p>

  <p>Mount pressed his lips together. "As I said, I can't release him because he's gone."</p>

  <p>"Since you can't release him, you'd better be prepared to die," said Feng Ge icily, her cold nature on full display. If Mount was telling the truth, and Luo Zheng was gone, it would be something she was not prepared to accept.</p>

  <p>Auras burst out all around Mount as the others released their energy. Many disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace as well as members of the Snake Goddess race activated their Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>The negotiation had failed, and it was time to go into battle.</p>

  <p>Mount had an impenetrable poker face, and his expression did not change as everyone around him prepared to attack. He looked around coolly at the people surrounding him. "If you attack me, then you will die. It's really very simple. I will kill everyone except her," he said, pointing a finger at Yan.</p>

  <p>His words sounded like a warning, but there was a hidden message embedded in them.</p>

  <p>The message was not intended for the warriors surrounding him in the Chaotic Source World, nor was it for the leaders waiting outside. Instead, it was for Fuxi.</p>
