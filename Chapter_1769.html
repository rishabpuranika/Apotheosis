<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1769 Return To The Lower World </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Zheng couldn't wait to set off. He had the memories of the great world, so he would immediately know the exact moment Yudie returned. The only thing he wanted to do at that moment was to rush to the great world and wait for Yudie to descend.</p>

  <p>Warriors in the Upper World could only pass through the ascending passageways to go to the great worlds.</p>

  <p>Since Yudie's life was still in danger, Zheng did not accept any of Master Feng's transportation options. He wanted to teleport directly to the great world by activating the Teleportation Token.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, I'll go with you." Tianming followed behind him.</p>

  <p>Naturally, Margaret wanted to go with Zheng. Finally, after much deliberation, Xenia, Lone and Lucille also decided to descend to the Lower World with them.</p>

  <p>Nathan and Lawson both seemed indifferent, but in the end, they also agreed to go together with the others.</p>

  <p>"All of you..."</p>

  <p>Master Feng was about to announce an extremely important matter for the future of the ten Godly Geniuses. He had sacrificed a great deal in order to give them the opportunity.</p>

  <p>However, even before he could utter a single word, Zheng used the Roaring Token to speak, interrupting him. Furthermore, the group of warriors all wanted to leave together with Zheng.</p>

  <p>As the leader of the Celestial Position as well as being one of the most powerful Supreme Lords in the universe, Master Feng couldn't help but feel dejected. He suddenly realized how fast the world had changed.</p>

  <p>These warriors were still too young. They knew the fate they faced, but they didn't seem to realize the gravity of it.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, Master Feng wondered if he was too lenient in their training.</p>

  <p>Their elders had already entrusted their care and their training to the Celestial Position, so he needed to speak a piece of his mind and criticize them. He needed them to understand the current situation.</p>

  <p>But before he could say anything, an ethereal voice spoke into his mind.</p>

  <p>"Let them go. This is also part of their training."</p>

  <p>When Master Feng heard this voice, he surprisingly recognized it. "Have you woken up a bit early?"</p>

  <p>"We can delay the plan to send them to the training land. The enemies wouldn't be able to break through the Signing Wall that quickly. At the moment, the sorcerer race members would only be able to activate the troublesome things that have been buried underground for the past hundreds of millions of years. You could deal with them on your own.</p>

  <p>But we still have to be wary of the Demon Night race and the ogre race. I can't ensure that they would take our side," the voice said flatly.</p>

  <p>Master Feng nodded. The man who talked with him was the most important supporter of the Celestial Position. Since this elder had already spoken, Master Feng had no choice but to listen to him.</p>

  <p>Letting Zheng and the others descend to the Lower World was risky.</p>

  <p>However, the Celestial Position race could secretly arrange for members to watch over the group. In this way, their original plan could be put off for some time in the future.</p>

  <p>Zheng originally planned to utilize the Teleportation Token to return instantly to the great world. At most, Freya would be the only one he brought with him.</p>

  <p>However, just as the two of them were about to leave, Tianming and Margaret followed close at his heels, with the other Godly Geniuses not far off...</p>

  <p>"We can pass through the ascending passageway to go to the Lower World, but we need to have the Moon Shrouding Stone," Xenia reminded. It seemed to her that Zheng did not know how to return to the Lower World.</p>

  <p>"Moon Shrouding Stone? What is that?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Lucille smiled faintly as she heard this. "The Moon Shrouding Stone is an important object that will protect you from being rejected by the great world and help you enter the Lower World."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I see."</p>

  <p>Zheng acknowledged. In the past, it piqued his curiosity as to how the Spirit Supreme Realm warriors of the Upper World were able to enter the great world.</p>

  <p>Several hours later, a bright bolt of brilliantly white lightning streaked across the sky above the sea of the great world. The powerful space spread outwards violently, forming a great space windstorm.</p>

  <p>There were a few powerful water monsters circling on the surface of the sea, but after sensing the aura of the space windstorm, the water monsters scattered and hid into the depths of the sea...</p>

  <p>Zheng was the first to emerge from the space windstorm, followed by Freya, Tianming, Xenia, Lucille, and the rest of the Godly Geniuses.</p>

  <p>Nathan and Lawson lagged behind the others like the usual.</p>

  <p>Initially, the two never intended to follow them. But as they saw that the other Godly Geniuses went along with Zheng, they also decided to leave with them.</p>

  <p>The Godly Geniuses looked at the scenery around them with awe, their faces filled with shock. They were amazed by Zheng's Teleportation Token.</p>

  <p>According to Xenia's plan, they would have had to travel the ascending passageway for at least half a month before they could reach the Lower World. It baffled them that Zheng had such a magical item. The Teleportation Token seemed to have the ability to travel to any place in the universe, and it was even more convenient than the Supreme Lords' Grand Teleportation. This unique item was too amazing for this entire universe, so they had a hard time accepting its capabilities.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't really want to show them this Teleportation Token, but the current circumstances warranted its use. He wanted to rescue Yudie at the soonest possible time.</p>

  <p>The moment Zheng emerged from the space windstorm, a strong force repelled him. The Moon Shrouding Stone in his hand suddenly glowed with a faint radiance and entered Zheng's body, helping him counteract the repelling force.</p>

  <p>"I'm finally back." A sharp glint appeared in Zheng's eyes as he said the words. He had been away from this place for a few years, and this was the first time Zheng had returned to his homeland. He was giddy with excitement and mixed emotions.</p>

  <p>It had never crossed his mind that the reason he returned for the first time in ages was to save Yudie...</p>

  <p>Zheng looked around, and saw nothing but the endless sea. The place where their party had descended was in the depths of the sea.</p>

  <p>The moment Zheng had entered the great world, he already felt the connection with this world. It was the embodiment of the will of the plane, which gave Zheng a strange sense of security. In this plane, Zheng could transfer all the damage he had incurred into the great world.</p>

  <p>Unless this great world was destroyed, he would be immortal and indestructible.</p>

  <p>Yudie hadn't emerged from the ascending passageway, and descending into the great world through the ascending passageway was a relatively slow process.</p>

  <p>In the past, Zheng had taken half a month to ascend to the Upper World.</p>

  <p>But now he returned to the great world in advance to wait for Yudie to come back... The universe was going to suffer a cataclysm soon. Zheng had already laid out a plan of his own. Before the crisis happened, he would take all his loved ones to live in the fairy palace. That was the only place where he could guarantee their safety.</p>

  <p>After he got his bearings, Zheng figured out his own location. He was located at the west part of the great world. If he continued to head west, he would reach the wall of the great world. To the east lay the Central Region.</p>

  <p>Zheng wasn't sure where Yudie would land, so he could only settle down first. He used his will to monitor the entire plane and waited for Yudie to show up...</p>

  <p>"This way," Zheng flew towards the east as he led the group.</p>

  <p>The Godly Geniuses followed closely behind him...</p>

  <p>"The life vitality in this place seems to be too placid," Lucille said as she observed her surroundings during her flight.</p>
