<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The steward had asked the question out of instincts. However, he remembered clearly that he had registered the disciple card for Zheng for the first time today, which meant that this was surely the first time that Zheng had entered the Lake of Magical Fish.</p>

  <p>Compared to Roger, the steward's shock was even higher!</p>

  <p>Nature creatures weren't the sole people to practice in the lake. It had faced its fair share of disciples.</p>

  <p>There were different levels of difficulty inside the lake ranging from the surface to a depth of three hundred meters.</p>

  <p>However, generally speaking, the most a nature creature could penetrate was the first five levels, i.e. from the surface to a depth of 150 meters.</p>

  <p>They almost always lost beyond that.</p>

  <p>Besides, the water of the lake was also heavier than the usual ones, added to which, was the fact that the deeper you went inside, the greater the pressure you would encounter.</p>

  <p>At a depth of ten meters, the water pressure had only the weight of 500 pounds. However, at a depth of thirty meters, it could reach as much as 2000 pounds. And if one were to venture down to one hundred meters, the force he would encounter would be more than 10, 000 pounds. It was a horrible experience!</p>

  <p>A depth of 150 meters was already the limit that the nature creatures could reach.</p>

  <p>In addition to those horrific levels of water pressure, the practitioners had to face the Murlocs in the magic array each time they got cultivated inside the lake.</p>

  <p>And the power of the Murlocs was supposed to increase with increasing depth.</p>

  <p>The uppermost Murlocs were the weakest among all and were called as the fourth-grade Murlocs. Though not that hard to beat, they were no less powerful than a human being half-step into the nature level.</p>

  <p>Between 30 meters to 60 meters, the yellow and light blue Murlocs would show up. The blue Merloc was smaller in size than the yellow one, but was more agile and moved faster.</p>

  <p>So in a way, its competence was that of a first grade nature creature.</p>

  <p>Beyond the 60 meters mark, more Murlocs with higher abilities and competence would appear.</p>

  <p>Therefore, even if a nature creature had reached the ninth-grade of the nature level, he couldn't break the limit of 150 meters.</p>

  <p>However, there was no shortage of gifted man in the Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>It was said that two hundred years ago, a gifted nature creature had dived to a depth of 190 meters under the lake. This was an accomplishment that usually could only be made by the practitioners of the Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>No one had ever approached or broken this record till now. However, that person was at the eighth-grade of the nature level, which was so much higher than Zheng's level.</p>

  <p>After he had killed the three Murlocs, Zheng didn't stay afloat in the same position for a long time. Instead, he kept diving downwards.</p>

  <p>He could dive at a rapid pace easily in his current condition by waving the fishtail on his back.</p>

  <p>However, his intentions for visiting the lake were not the mundane practice of diving but to hone and cultivate himself.</p>

  <p>As he reached a depth of over 60 meters, some blue Murlocs appeared in his surrounding waters.</p>

  <p>The weapons they held were axes made of animal's bones. These blue Mulocs were a little smaller than the yellow Murlocs and their heads were flat and sharp.</p>

  <p>Also, they moved faster than the yellow ones and were more offensive.</p>

  <p>If Zheng hadn't condensed that fishtail, he might not have been able to keep up the fight with the blue Murlocs for more than a single round.</p>

  <p>However, when he faced the blue Murlocs, he could still maintain a certain advantage in speed.</p>

  <p>Currently, there were six blue Murlocs chasing closely after him.</p>

  <p>Although he was moving much faster than them, it wasn't easy for him to outrun them completely.</p>

  <p>"Bang! Bang! Bang..."</p>

  <p>The Murlocs had known that they couldn't keep up with Zheng's speed and therefore had thrown the axes they held in their hands towards him.</p>

  <p>When these axes rushed towards Zheng, they rotated and produced several tiny bubbles as they rent their way across the water.</p>

  <p>Three out of the six axes hit Zheng from behind, and the rest of them went on and blocked his way.</p>

  <p>'These blue Murlocs are far more aggressive than those yellow ones, and they are acting very swiftly. It seems that I can't get rid of them if I depend solely on my advantage in speed. I should try something else!'</p>

  <p>Thinking of a plan, Zheng took out the broken flying knife from his space ring.</p>

  <p>Ever Since he had dived into the lake, Zheng hadn't used any weapon yet.</p>

  <p>After all, the environment in the water was totally different from that in the air. His flying knife had always been fast in air but in water, he wasn't so sure.</p>

  <p>If it lost any speed here, the impact of his flying knife would be decreased greatly.</p>

  <p>The broken flying knife was still as sharp as usual. It swished across the water easily.</p>

  <p>However, it seemed that its impact had been reduced significantly by the resistance of the heavy water. The flying knfe that Zheng had thrown hit only one ax. Then it was lost to turbulence.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, since the ax had been split apart by his flying knife, an opening showed up in front of Zheng, and therefore, he found a chance to break out and seized it.</p>

  <p>Actually, Zheng's strength was much greater than those blue Murlocs, so he was wondering why the broken flying knife he had thrown out was much weaker than the axes those blue Murlocs had thrown out.</p>

  <p>He kept on pondering the question as he dodged the Murlocs.</p>

  <p>He had already made sure that the axes were nothing more than some common animal bones.</p>

  <p>However, after being thrown out, they had kept on rotating at a very high speed and produced countless tiny bubbles.</p>
