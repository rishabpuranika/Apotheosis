<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1217 Doubts </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>When they heard about the existence or rather the presence of the Black Star, the Celestial Position warriors finally understood what had happened.</p>

  <p>The Black Star did not adorn the list of the most powerful weapons in the Upper World, mostly because of the fact that it was just a pickax and not suitable as a weapon.</p>

  <p>However, it was a supreme divine weapon; this meant that the Black Star was extremely useful in certain scenarios. So one could definitely call it a treasure, and it would be easily worth a king's ransom.</p>

  <p>The middle-aged scholarly man named Delroy gave a slight nod. "Ah! I see! No wonder she broke my enchanted barrier. I was curious just how someone from the Lower World was able to do that. Turns out it wasn't her own strength."</p>

  <p>He had obtained a title from the Tower of Illusory. And a title of Asura was not to be taken lightly, no matter what its color. The title that the man had received was bronze, but was the highest bronze title one could get. That alone was enough to make him extremely proud of himself and equally confident in his abilities.</p>

  <p>To his knowledge, no warrior from the Lower World could ever shatter his enchanted barrier. A Law of Causality that had with it associated a sort of "Relative Defense" was in that enchanted barrier. Who among the natives of the Lower World could figure out how to use a Law of Causality?</p>

  <p>Yet that was his knowledge. And even though Delroy's thoughts were mostly correct, he had still underestimated the warriors of the Lower World. For example, Eddie from the Central Region had once used the Nameless Saber to activate a Law of Causality— the Life and Death Wind. This only partially violated Delroy's beliefs. Eddie did not know about the Law of Causality and had only lured the Life and Death Wind over from the Netherworld River.</p>

  <p>Zheng's situation was more or less the same as that. He did not comprehend any Law of Causality that belonged to him, but had merely relied on the one which was present inside the Black Star to destroy Delroy's enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>"There's no need to waste any more words now. We should just snatch the Ancestral Dragon and take it away. No wait! It is already hatched and has taken this woman as its mom. The imprinting can't be reversed.</p>

  <p>There's nothing we can do about it. Alas! All we can do is return to the Upper World and think of some other means," the burly man remarked in a thoughtful tone. He was also a little curious as to why Dorothea and Woody had not tried to snatch the Ancestral Dragon away, but instead brought the woman here.</p>

  <p>Max, however, was smarter than the burly man. Seeing Dorothea's expression, he could see that something was up. "Dorothea, did you discover something? What are you not telling us?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Only then did Dorothea nod and reply, "Yes! I did make a few important discoveries." After a little bit of pause, she added with a smile, "Very important discoveries indeed."</p>

  <p>When everyone heard her cautious emphasis on the word "important," they became curious and turned their attention towards her.</p>

  <p>"What important discoveries?" Max was the one to ask.</p>

  <p>Woody laughed and rushed in front of Dorothea before she could reply.</p>

  <p>"Dorothea found the location of the Tower of Crystal. It is somewhere inside this great world!"</p>

  <p>"What? The Tower of Crystal? Are you kidding me?"</p>

  <p>"Are you talking about that Tower of Crystal which is known as one of the three trial towers? Hasn't it been lost for so many years?"</p>

  <p>There were many murmurs instantly. "Is it true, Dorothea?"</p>

  <p>Max asked in a clear voice.</p>

  <p>He paused for a moment and continued, "Dorothea, is the Tower of Crystal really located inside this great world?"</p>

  <p>Dorothea nodded in reply. "Yes, most certainly. This is the world that plays host to the Tower of Crystal!"</p>

  <p>"Oh my God! Max, we have been blessed indeed this time! If we were to find that tower... Although this Evil Dragon is a bit difficult to deal with, the value of the Tower of Crystal is immeasurable!" the burly man said with a laugh.</p>

  <p>Delroy also nodded in affirmation. "Both the Tower of Illusory and the Tower of Jade are currently packed with people. What's more, those two trial towers are far from enough. If we can find the Tower of Crystal, it would be a great contribution to our race. Dorothea, how do you know the whereabouts of the Tower of Crystal?"</p>

  <p>Dorothea's response was astonishing. She pointed at Zheng and said, "I heard it from her."</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The burly man waved the giant sickle in his hand and hit it on the ground. He then walked towards Zheng and asked in a cold voice, "You, tell me the location of the Tower of Crystal!"</p>

  <p>Zheng stared indifferently at the burly man and did not answer him. He wasn't going to give in to rude orders.</p>

  <p>When he saw that the woman in front of him was treating him as if he was nothing, the burly man took two steps forward and tried to threaten her into responding. "Woman, I'll ask you a few more questions. If you're smart enough, you'll tell me what I want to know— "</p>

  <p>He was only halfway through his threat when Dorothea interrupted him.</p>

  <p>"The most important thing that I discovered is not the Tower of Crystal's whereabouts," she said.</p>

  <p>The Tower of Crystal was a treasure whose value was beyond measurement to the Celestial Position race; in fact, to the seven people standing here right now, it was incomparably precious. But even after,</p>

  <p>Dorothea was saying that the Tower of Crystal was not important. What the hell was going on? The company was confused and looking at her with a complicated expression.</p>

  <p>Max asked in confusion, "What do you mean the Tower of Crystal is not important? Of course it is! What could be more important than that?"</p>

  <p>"Her!" Dorothea pointed at Zheng, and there were several gasps and a few groans. Ignoring that, she continued, "This woman said that she had been to the Tower of Crystal and had also been tested by the Talent Tablet.</p>

  <p>She even saw my father's name on it."</p>

  <p>"Master Gu?" Max exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Odom's talent could only have been ranked in the first row, and he hadn't gotten a title from the Tower of Crystal, but talent was only one of the numerous aspects that decided a warrior's achievements. Even without such a feat, Odom was known as a powerful warrior and revered among the Celestial Position race. So when Max mentioned Dorothea's father, he still had to respectfully address him as "Master Gu."</p>

  <p>Out of the seven people present in the company, only Dorothea and the burly man had not received any titles from the Talent Tablet. Of the remaining five, Max had obtained a silver title, and the other four all had bronze titles.</p>

  <p>Strictly speaking, Dorothea didn't have the right to join their team. The main reason why she was able to join this mission was because of her father, Odom.</p>

  <p>Dorothea nodded, "Such important information cannot be faked, so I believe that she has indeed entered the Tower of Crystal."</p>

  <p>"Even in that case, what is more important than the Tower of Crystal?</p>

  <p>Just stop beating round the bush!" the burly man asked impatiently.</p>

  <p>"I told you! It's her!" Dorothea said again.</p>

  <p>At this point, her words had already confused the other six. What did this mean?</p>

  <p>The woman in front of them was indeed special, that much they could tell. There weren't many creatures in the whole universe who walked around with golden pupils. It was possible for some descendants of the Genuine Dragon, but a mere descendant of Genuine Dragon wasn't enough to pique their interest, and most certainly not Dorothea's.</p>

  <p>"She said that she had obtained a title in the test of the Talent Tablet, so she can be considered a member of our Celestial Position race,"</p>

  <p>Dorothea calmly explained.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Delroy flashed a mocking smile. "She has obtained a title?</p>

  <p>Ha-ha! As if someone from the Lower World would actually be able to obtain a title in the Tower of Crystal. That is too far-fetched, Dorothea!</p>

  <p>What color is that title, and what title is it?"</p>

  <p>Among the warriors present, Delroy's title was the second best. He was concerned about Zheng's title.</p>

  <p>"I know, I know. We still need to verify her title." After thinking for a while, Dorothea added, "But she said that she had obtained the golden title of Celestial Position."</p>

  <p>The moment Dorothea said those words, the other six men lost it and started laughing out loud.</p>

  <p>The one with the most intense reaction was Delroy. Though it wasn't physically that intense, he smiled arrogantly and then said, "Dorothea, you've gone mad. Do you know what you're talking about?"</p>

  <p>Even Max shook his head slightly and remarked, "Dorothea, you're still lacking in experience. How can you be so naive and believe something like that?"</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! Dorothea, that sounds ridiculous and you're better than to fall for that. What nonsense are you spouting!" The burly man also laughed.</p>

  <p>They simply could not believe Dorothea's words at all.</p>

  <p>In truth, Dorothea was also skeptical of Zheng's words. After all, they were empty words, without any proof.</p>

  <p>However, her belief in Zheng was based on her own judgment and she didn't care what the others thought. "Max, the Tower of Crystal has been lost since a long time ago. As far as I know, before it got lost, it had only opened for a short period of time and no one had ever managed to obtain a title from it. But this woman herself was the one who mentioned the golden title of the Celestial Position. If she didn't see it with her own eyes, how would she be able to speak of it? No such thing as a coincidence, right?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Delroy snorted lightly and said, "What if she got some information about our Celestial Position race from somewhere. Or perhaps someone she knew got the golden title?"</p>

  <p>"Someone else... There's no such possibility." Max shook his head.</p>

  <p>There were a hundred thousand supreme worlds in the Upper World. The talents of every single race had already tried their best to go to the Celestial Position race's trial towers. In the history, there had been only six living creatures who had managed to obtain the golden titles of the Celestial Position. Even if there were millions of great worlds in the Lower World, it was impossible for a creature of today's generation to obtain a golden title.</p>
