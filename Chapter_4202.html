<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As soon as Luo Zheng entered the altar, the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the others also came up with their own plan. There had to be a way for them to contribute to this battle.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven and his companions were weaker than the bird spirits, the monkey spirits, and the human spirits. It would be hard for them to last long in a fight like this.</p>

  <p>Unlike the Treacherous Beings, they didn't have tough bodies and they couldn't come back to life through coordinates. They were severely disadvantaged.</p>

  <p>Even the blood power they inherited was not enough for them to confront powerful beings like the Snake Spirit King. It seemed as though the only thing they could do there was to throw the coordinates.</p>

  <p>However, the human heroes wouldn't give up that easily.</p>

  <p>They began to discuss with each other. With the right combination of techniques, maybe they would have something to offer.</p>

  <p>Their weakness was actually their biggest advantage. They were so weak that the bird spirits, the monkey spirits, and the human spirits wouldn't pay any attention to them.</p>

  <p>"As far as I know, the Monkey Spirit King is impulsive and vengeful.</p>

  <p>Therefore, I think he will be the first one to make a move," the Snake Goddess surmised.</p>

  <p>"What does it matter? The Monkey Spirit King and the Snake Spirit King both are too strong. It will be impossible for us to interfere in their battle,"</p>

  <p>Zhurong said skeptically.</p>

  <p>Gonggong added, "Yes, I agree with you. If we interfere, we will only get ourselves killed."</p>

  <p>"How about we attack the Snake Spirit King directly?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven suddenly suggested.</p>

  <p>"Have you completely lost your mind? How are we even going to do that?" Even the hot-tempered Zhurong showed a frightened look on his face. "At the very least, we have to come up with a more practical plan," he added.</p>

  <p>'We are no match for the Snake Spirit King even if we work together, '</p>

  <p>Zhurong thought to himself. He didn't want to admit it out loud because his companions would just feel hopeless.</p>

  <p>However, Fuxi revealed a mischievous grin. "Hmm, do you think we can eliminate him by merely using reasonable methods?" he asked playfully.</p>

  <p>Zhurong was taken aback and didn't know how to reply.</p>

  <p>"Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying that we're going to deal with the Snake Spirit King on our own. I mean we can team up with the Monkey Spirit King and attack the Snake Spirit King together," the Primeval Lord of Heaven emphasized.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, the Monkey Spirit King was stronger than the Snake Spirit King in terms of brute strength. However, the Snake Spirit King was cunning and had Holy Items at his disposal. Thus, it was possible that the Monkey Spirit King wouldn't be able to touch him even after a hundred rounds.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi had remained silent the whole time. But at this point, he opened his mouth to make a suggestion. "I can immobilize anything with my sword," he chimed in.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure it will work on the Snake Spirit King? If so, then it probably will come in handy," the Snake Goddess said.</p>

  <p>"In theory, it will work as long as my sword doesn't break," Eastern Emperor Taiyi replied confidently.</p>

  <p>After Eastern Emperor Taiyi mastered the Blood-controlling Method, his sword skills had become more mysterious and effective.</p>

  <p>His sword seemed to follow a certain rule. This enabled it to become unbreakable.</p>

  <p>However, he had never used it in a battle before. It was because he couldn't defeat the enemy with this move.</p>

  <p>Not long ago, he had communicated with the Eastern Emperor Taiyi that was in the chaos. Unfortunately, they failed to figure out the correct method on how to unleash the full potential of the sword technique.</p>

  <p>"In any case, the Snake Spirit King is a Treacherous Being. He will just cut his tail off so he can escape," Fuxi said while shaking his head. The Snake Spirit King was a slippery and crafty opponent.</p>

  <p>A mocking smile appeared on the Snake Goddess's face. "Do you really think arrogant beings like him would sacrifice his tail to keep himself safe?" she asked wryly.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of the Snake Spirit King, humans were merely inferior beings.</p>

  <p>It would be too shameful for him to break his tail just to get away with them.</p>

  <p>"Well, no one knows what'll happen when the Monkey Spirit King fights the Snake Spirit King. So, how will Eastern Emperor Taiyi trap the Snake Spirit King? How will you even go there?" Gonggong was genuinely curious. If there was even a slightest possibility of defeating the Snake Spirit King, he was willing to cooperate.</p>

  <p>"I'll send him there," the Wing King volunteered all of a sudden.</p>

  <p>Thanks to his bloodline, the Wing King had the ability of the space-time quadrant. Even though his prowess in this ability was greatly enhanced, he didn't have the chance to use it until now.</p>

  <p>He thought that this space token he learnt was not even worth mentioning compared to the Snake Spirit King's Space Guiding Stone.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, he could utilize it to send Eastern Emperor Taiyi to the battlefield. He would do it once the Snake Spirit King and the Monkey Spirit King started battling.</p>

  <p>After their lively discussion, they ironed out their plan to defeat the Snake Spirit King. Seeing how it might succeed, everybody was on board with it.</p>

  <p>During the second round of the Monkey Spirit King and the Snake Spirit King's battle, the Wing King sent Eastern Emperor Taiyi to the battlefield where the two kings were.</p>

  <p>As soon as he arrived there, Eastern Emperor Taiyi used his sword to stab the Snake Spirit King. This attack rendered the Snake Spirit King immobile.</p>

  <p>Everything went just as the Snake Goddess had predicted. Their plan was going smoothly.</p>

  <p>Even though Eastern Emperor Taiyi just appeared out of thin air, the Snake Spirit King didn't pay much attention to him. He didn't dodge the attack and now he was struggling to break free from the sword.</p>

  <p>However, the simple golden sword made him unable to move. No matter how much he tried, he couldn't even lift the tip of his tail.</p>

  <p>He was now facing a barrage of attacks from the Monkey Spirit King. But the Snake Spirit King didn't even think about cutting his tail off to get rid of the sword. His mind was clouded with doubt.</p>

  <p>'What in heaven's name is going on with this sword? What is this?</p>

  <p>Why couldn't I break free from it?' he thought out loud.</p>

  <p>"You should have seen this coming, Cornelius! Take this!" the Monkey Spirit King roared as he charged towards his immobile adversary.</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, a handful of Holy Stones materialized in his palm.</p>

  <p>He didn't waste any time. He swiftly embedded the Holy Stones into the Snake Spirit King's body.</p>

  <p>Boom! A loud explosion was heard all throughout the battlefield.</p>

  <p>The Light of Annihilation exploded and caused severe injuries in the Snake Spirit King's body.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King also hurt himself with the Holy Stones because he didn't use anything to protect him. Nonetheless, the damage the Holy Stones did to the Snake Spirit King was greater than what they did to him.</p>

  <p>And that was all that mattered.</p>

  <p>"Annihilation Fist!" The Monkey Spirit King was just getting started. This was the perfect opportunity for him to defeat the Snake Spirit King.</p>

  <p>Soon after, a wolf tooth from his necklace glowed with black light.</p>

  <p>Seven bloodline powers merged into one and formed a light ball.</p>

  <p>Afterward, it shot directly at the Snake Spirit King.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King prepared for his next attack. "Extreme Intent of Thunder!"</p>

  <p>This time, another wolf tooth emitted a scarlet lightning that surrounded the Monkey Spirit King's fist. He punched the Snake Spirit King's chest and the powerful lightning hit the latter.</p>

  <p>"Power of Broken Stars!" He bellowed once again and launched a different attack.</p>

  <p>Most of the power contained in the Monkey Spirit King's necklace of wolf teeth came from the destruction quadrant. That in itself was extremely lethal.</p>

  <p>As the Light of Annihilation shone brightly, the bloodline powers simultaneously surged towards the Snake Spirit King.</p>

  <p>The Bird Masters remained hovering in the sky. They watched in horror as the Monkey Spirit King hit the Snake Spirit King.</p>

  <p>Originally, they were here to provide assistance to the Monkey Spirit King.</p>

  <p>However, it looked like that the Monkey Spirit King could finish off the Snake Spirit King all by himself. They didn't dare get in the middle of that onslaught of attacks.</p>

  <p>None of the Bird Masters saw this coming. In just a fraction of a moment, the Monkey Spirit King gained the upper hand.</p>

  <p>Alphonse, Hamilton, and the other human spirits were also dumbfounded by what they just witnessed.</p>

  <p>Despite that, Alphonse was clever. He knew that the reason why the Snake Spirit King was suddenly at a serious disadvantage was because of the golden sword. It had trapped him and made him immobile.</p>

  <p>"Clearly, I underestimated these humans. Not only did they take advantage of their bloodline powers, but they also saw through Snake Spirit King's mind," Alphonse murmured as he glanced at the Primeval Lord of Heaven, the Snake Goddess, and other humans who were watching not far away from the battlefield.</p>

  <p>Sewell and Balfour were more stunned than anyone else. They stood there rooted to the ground. Their faces showed utter confusion at what just happened.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom! They heard more explosions going off one after another.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King's body was in complete shambles.</p>

  <p>At this point, it would be impossible for him to escape. He couldn't even block the Monkey Spirit King's powerful attacks. As the Light of Annihilation eroded the heavily injured Snake Spirit King, his body broke into pieces and slowly began to dissipate.</p>

  <p>Everyone who was watching felt like the battle between the two kings had lasted for a long time. But in fact, only a minute had passed.</p>

  <p>When two top-level masters engaged in a fight, the one who made a simple mistake would lose in an instant.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King stopped attacking as the crumbling remains of the Snake Spirit King under his feet vanished into thin air.</p>

  <p>All the Snake Masters who had been eager to fight immediately fell silent.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King that they pledged their loyalty to was killed in such a short period of time. Because of that, they didn't see any point in continuing the battle.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King stomped on the ground with one foot, and the ground caved in and formed a big crater.</p>

  <p>His eyes blazed as he was still full of fighting spirit. "This is boring.</p>

  <p>Cornelius was still so weak. Is there anyone else who can be my match?" the Monkey Spirit King demanded.</p>
