<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The top-rank True God broke free from the ripped tentacle and quickly fled.</p>

  <p>"You want to escape?"</p>

  <p>Seeing the huge head sink rapidly into the sand, Zheng lifted his sword to strike again.</p>

  <p>Although what he was going up against was a ferocious beast in the Abyss Demon Region, it was not a very powerful one.</p>

  <p>It would not be difficult to kill it.</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng was about to end its life with his sword attack, Leland suddenly shouted, "Zheng, don't kill it! It's intelligent!"</p>

  <p>Although Leland's words fell short of conveying the complete meaning of what he wanted to say, Zheng understood his thoughts in an instant.</p>

  <p>Ever since leaving the Reincarnation Land, they had moved forward by instinct, completely unaware of where they were.</p>

  <p>If they were lucky, they would be able to leave this place and ascend to an upper stage of the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>But if they were unlucky and broke into the lair of some powerful beasts, they would be in real trouble. What they needed the most now was some information.</p>

  <p>And if this beast was really intelligent like Leland claimed, they would be able to get some information from it.</p>

  <p>Its huge triangular head was spinning madly, rapidly digging a big hole into the sand.</p>

  <p>However, its huge size affected its speed as it moved in the sand.</p>

  <p>Zheng gently floated over to the beast, and then grabbed the tentacles on the back of its head with his hands and pulled it out.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>He kicked hard on the lower part of its head.</p>

  <p>The head flew, drawing a steep arc in the air before landing on the beach.</p>

  <p>"Wow, wow, wow, wow..."</p>

  <p>Its big mouth screamed as it rolled around in pain.</p>

  <p>Then, determined to flee, it began to spin again.</p>

  <p>However, Leland had already followed it to the beach. He gently stomped on the sand, infusing it with a stream of internal momentum.</p>

  <p>The sand immediately turned solid and hard, like a slate, with a colorful glow on its surface.</p>

  <p>The head continued to spin in an attempt to drill into the ground but to no avail. At last, it gave up.</p>

  <p>After Zheng landed next to Leland, Leland stared at the head and said, "If I'm not wrong, this must be the Western Sea Monster."</p>

  <p>"What's that?" Zheng had never seen such a strange thing before.</p>

  <p>"It is from an ancient legend on the western sea. It is said that this monster wanders the depths of the western sea. Anyone who is caught by its tentacles will be dragged into the depths of the sea," Leland explained.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Zheng smiled; he finally understood what this beast was. "It seems that it is only a legend, and not one that many people know about."</p>

  <p>Strictly speaking, the Abyss Demon Region didn't exist in the first place.</p>

  <p>Everything within it was imagined by the divine citizens.</p>

  <p>Perhaps it was because of that ancient legend, which must have been spread by word of mouth, that the Western Sea Monster had sprung into existence in the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>"Yes." Leland nodded. "The legend of the Western Sea Monster is only spread near the western sea. I was born there, so of course I know it."</p>

  <p>Since this beast received only a little Faith Energy from the few people who knew about it, it was very weak.</p>

  <p>But according to the legend, it was a cunning and intelligent monster.</p>

  <p>That was why Leland had asked Zheng not to kill it.</p>

  <p>With a light tap of his toe, Zheng leaped up into the air and hovered above the Western Sea Monster. "Which stage of the Abyss Demon Region is this and where is the exit?"</p>

  <p>He didn't want to talk too much with this ugly thing.</p>

  <p>"Wow, wow, wow, wow..."</p>

  <p>The head opened its mouth and made a series of strange sounds, as if it didn't understand human language.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng's expression did not change at all. He pointed the long sword in his hand at it and said, "Speak human language or you'll die immediately."</p>

  <p>Splash...</p>

  <p>Rolling sword intent circled around Zheng's long sword. With just a light shake of his hand, he could shatter the head into pieces.</p>

  <p>The Western Sea Monster felt Zheng's killing intent and finally opened its mouth. In an extremely rough and strange voice, it shouted, "Don't, don't kill me. I tell you!"</p>

  <p>Zheng and Leland looked at each other and smiled. Leland's judgment was right.</p>

  <p>"Spit it out," Zheng said flatly.</p>

  <p>"I don't know much either! I'm just their food! This is the breeding zone!" the Western Sea Monster shouted pathetically.</p>

  <p>"Food? Breeding Zone?" Zheng's eyes narrowed.</p>

  <p>"Yes, we are just the food of the fiends! Every once in a while, the fiends will come here, dig us out, and take us away," the Western Sea Monster explained with a helpless expression on its face.</p>

  <p>The fiends thoroughly controlled the Abyss Demon Region. With their intelligence, their race had already surpassed the general definition of "forbidden area beasts."</p>

  <p>This was also the reason why the fiends were able to contend with the Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>And this breeding zone was merely a pasture of the fiends. In the lava lake and this endless beach, there were many beasts that they kept as food.</p>

  <p>The Western Sea Monster was one of them.</p>

  <p>"Which stage of the Abyss Demon Region are we in?" Leland prodded.</p>

  <p>This was what he was most concerned about.</p>

  <p>"The sixth stage," the Western Sea Monster replied honestly.</p>

  <p>When the five people present heard the answer, their hearts all sank.</p>

  <p>Although they didn't know how many stages there were in the Abyss Demon Region, this answer was far beyond their expectations.</p>

  <p>"The sixth stage... It seems that we can't get out," Leland murmured with a bitter smile on his face.</p>

  <p>He even suspected that the sixth stage was the lowest stage of the Abyss Demon Region!</p>

  <p>"If we really can't leave, we can still return to the Reincarnation Land."</p>

  <p>"If we meet the legendary fiends, there is no chance for us to leave this place alive..."</p>

  <p>The three top-rank True Gods couldn't stay calm anymore.</p>

  <p>Zheng frowned and looked at the Western Sea Monster. "Is there any way to go to the fifth stage?"</p>

  <p>"I... I don't know," the Western Sea Monster said with a mournful look on its huge face." I really don't know. I've had enough of this place, but I can't go anywhere. In the end, I can only be the food of the fiends!"</p>

  <p>Compared to the divine land, the environment in the forbidden areas was menacing.</p>

  <p>Even if not for the looming threat of the fiends, the ferocious beasts would fight among themselves; this was something they couldn't avoid.</p>

  <p>After all, it was impossible for these creatures to escape into the divine land. Being illusions, they would disappear into thin air if they put a foot outside the forbidden area.</p>

  <p>"Since that's the case, there's no need for you to exist," Zheng said as he raised his long sword, ready to kill the beast.</p>

  <p>In his eyes, these beasts didn't deserve his mercy.</p>

  <p>"Wait, wait!" the head said anxiously in an attempt to get Zheng to spare its life. "I've heard there's a fellow in the sea who would know the way out!"</p>

  <p>"In the lava sea?"</p>

  <p>Standing on the huge head, Zheng looked at the dark red lava sea and asked, "How can we find that guy?"</p>
