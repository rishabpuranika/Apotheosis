</p>

  <p>The light at the far end gradually disappeared and Egan said in thought,</p>

  <p>"The man from the Life race has failed."</p>

  <p>"Failed? What makes you say that?" asked Zheng surprised.</p>

  <p>He didn't know how Egan had come to this conclusion. When they were observing in the square, all they could see was a dot of light spinning in the distance before finally disappearing.</p>

  <p>"If he had entered a room and fused with the bloodline, a blazing light would have flashed. But now, the protective light has disappeared but there is still no blazing light shining, which means he hasn't entered a room,"</p>

  <p>Egan explained.</p>

  <p>"He was trying too hard," commented Kirk while shaking his head.</p>

  <p>In fact, the big vortex on the third page was relatively safe. As long as one's body was not totally eroded, they would be able to take their pick of a nearby room to obtain the bloodline and reach the Eternal Realm smoothly.</p>

  <p>But some people got too greedy and chose to go further even without possessing the necessary strength.</p>

  <p>"Let me have a go!"</p>

  <p id="top_30">The member of the Jade Crown race then came forward. He stepped into the hexagram array and quickly left the square, sprinting towards the depths of the big vortex.</p>

  <p>About ten minutes later, his protective light was falling dimmer and dimmer. Then, a blazing light shot into the sky; the member of the Jade Crown race had already chosen a room to enter. After fusing with the bloodline, he reached the Eternal Realm.</p>

  <p>"That was quite a rational decision. From what I see, he is probably in the ninth circle, matching the strength of the imprints he had obtained," Egan said, nodding to Kirk. It was Kirk's turn to enter the vortex.</p>

  <p>Kirk had obtained seven imprints, just like the man of the Jade Crown race and he didn't overextend himself either. After reaching the ninth circle, he simply chose and entered a room with a hexagram array.</p>

  <p>Several Other Shore creatures then followed suit. Perhaps the tragedy of the member of the Life race sucked away their will to gamble. They no longer dared grit their teeth and fight head-on. Most of them had each chosen a room with a hexagram array while the protecting light still shone.</p>

  <p>Egan was the third to last to enter the big vortex. The protective light released by the nine imprints guaranteed to take him further. In the end, he reached the expected sixth circle.</p>

  <p>In the Grand Plain Stage, the members of the Three Eyes race were overjoyed. Despite the outbreak of the Black Disaster, they still had two members successfully enter the Eternal Realm. Even more special was that Egan himself had reached his goal and made it into the sixth circle. They naturally felt proud and honored.</p>

  <p>"The sixth circle is probably the pinnacle of the Eternal Scroll Painting this time, right?" a member of the Three Eyes race asked, filled with pride.</p>

  <p>The disciples of the larger races had died on either the first or second page and lost their chance to compete.</p>

  <p>But just then, another began rushing along the big vortex. The person was very small. He was from the Grasshopper race.</p>

  <p>This race was even more inconspicuous than the Life race in the Grand Plain Stage and was not held in high esteem by outsiders.</p>

  <p>But when the other members of the Grasshopper race saw one of their own appear, they stood and watched expectantly.</p>

  <p>It had been many years since their race had produced such a talent.</p>

  <p>It would definitely increase the strength of the entire race by one level if he could enter an inner circle and reach the Eternal Realm.</p>

  <p>Many Other Shore races looked on indifferently. The member of the Grasshopper race passed through circles, entered the fourth circle directly and obtained a bloodline there. He did more impressively than seemed possible for this race.</p>

  <p>Bloodlines in the inner circles were on the root level.</p>

  <p>Since ancient times, very few had obtained one. Perhaps only one had entered an inner circle in the thousands of times the Eternal Scroll Painting had opened!</p>

  <p>Many Other Shore races were then shocked to see what the member of the Grasshopper race had achieved.</p>

  <p>A small, unknown race actually had a figure entering an inner circle... This would no doubt change the fate of their race.</p>

  <p>However, some of the other races close to the Grasshopper race were not pleased. There was much competition and many disputes between them and the Grasshopper race and so they did not want to see such an impressive talent popping up.</p>

  <p>"Why hasn't Zheng gone yet?"</p>

  <p>"His turn should be soon."</p>

  <p>"He's the last to go!"</p>

  <p>Pearce and the others were all in the Grand Plain Stage. Every time the Eternal Scroll Painting opened was like a grand banquet, but they always missed it as they were from the Source World.</p>

  <p>Zheng had come with eighteen imprints; he wondered what expressions this would inspire.</p>

  <p>When Zheng saw the blazing light soaring into the sky in the distance, he stepped into the hexagram array and turned into a flat painting, moving forward along the big vortex without hesitation.</p>

  <p>Even after he had turned into a painting, his protective light was still intensely bright.</p>

  <p>As the protective light blocked the Void Sand, he moved forward easily.</p>

  <p>He encountered almost no resistance in the first sixteen circles.</p>

  <p>A while later and he had successfully entered the fourth circle.</p>

  <p>Zheng had also garnered a lot of attention, but the Element Spirit race's and the Nihility race's interests in him had already proved he was extraordinary.</p>

  <p>His entering an inner circle was almost expected and inevitable.</p>

  <p>It would, after all, be ridiculous if the one selected by both Claire and the Grandmaster of Heaven could not even enter an inner circle.</p>

  <p>Zheng had no time to relax when he entered the fourth circle. Once there, the size and density of the Void Sand increased greatly and rushed towards him wildly, consuming his protective light.</p>

  <p>Although it was indeed very strong, it still would not be able to hold on much longer.</p>

  <p>But the closer the circle to the center, the shorter the distance there was to travel through.</p>

  <p>Without pausing, Zheng advanced rapidly along the path through the big vortex.</p>

  <p>The fourth circle...</p>

  <p>The third circle...</p>

  <p>The second circle...</p>

  <p>All the Other Shore creatures in the Grand Plain Stage stared silently. They watched as he smoothly entered the inner circles, their expressions shifting with increasing amazement with his every advancement.</p>

  <p>The gap between the Eternal Warriors was decided the moment they reached the Eternal Realm.</p>

  <p>The warriors in the outer circles were all at the ordinary Eternal Realm, while those who managed to make their way to the inner circles were capable of becoming the leaders of powerful races. Of course, they would most likely be recruited straight into the Element Spirit race or the Nihility race.</p>

  <p>As for those who entered the third or even second circle, they would be powerful forces in exploring Stage Thirty-three. By then, they could even dominate a territory.</p>

  <p>And the strongest would enter the innermost circle in the center of the vortex. These creatures had the potential to compete to be the strongest existence on the Other Shore!</p>

  <p>Now that Zheng had effortlessly stepped into the second circle and still showed no signs of slowing down, it seemed that he would rush into the innermost circle.</p>

  <p>"It's no wonder the two great races would fight for him..."</p>

  <p>"They already knew what he was capable of!"</p>

  <p>"He reaches the first circle. Up until now, there have only been eleven kinds of holy-level bloodlines. I wonder if he will obtain the twelfth."</p>

  <p>Some Other Shore races referred to the bloodlines provided in the innermost circle as the holy-level bloodlines. These were also regarded as the best.</p>

  <p>But this was a controversial view. After all, there were some incredibly powerful figures that did not rank high in the Eternal Scroll Painting. Thus it was believed that the difference in bloodlines from the four inner circles was not that great.</p>
