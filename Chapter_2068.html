<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2068 Enter The True Path Again </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>For the past years, Saul had been in a closed and secluded state for a long while.</p>

  <p>His puppet body remained immortal, while his body had a true soul. The endless years meant endless loneliness.</p>

  <p>Zheng's visit in the fairy palace was the happiest moment of Saul's life.</p>

  <p>Over the past decade, Luo Zheng had entered the fairy palace several times.</p>

  <p>Every time he did so, he would reap remarkable rewards. Eventually, his control over the fairy palace grew stronger as he journeyed further along the True Path.</p>

  <p>Later on, Luo Zheng even let his family stay within the fairy palace, too.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey, Zheng's son, brought a lot of happiness to Saul and Immortal Book. Everyone was fond of Geoffrey's quirky, refreshing youth.</p>

  <p>Saul didn't seem to care about what was happening in the outside world, but this didn't make him clueless. He knew about the Evolutionary Universe, and knew that Luo Zheng was facing a great test.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, Saul had immovable faith in Luo Zheng. He had a firm belief that Luo Zheng could not be defeated so easily.</p>

  <p>So seeing Luo Zheng suddenly appear in the fairy palace, sprawled across the ground, body covered in blood, Saul was drawn with worry. He carefully examined Zheng's injuries with gentle movements. Afterwards, he breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>Though Zheng's injuries looked frightening, they were not fatal.</p>

  <p>As he was a world lord, only his soul and cinnabar field were critical points to look at. As long as these two weren't in too much damage, they could recover quite fast.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Zheng's physique was already extraordinary compared to others'.</p>

  <p>He was rapidly recovering, like nothing had happened.</p>

  <p>The currents in his body met the wounds all over Zheng's body. Some of the wounds were deep and went through a few of his internal organs. But as the currents moved at high speed, new pieces of flesh formed along the wounds to heal his body completely.</p>

  <p>Not long after, Zheng's eyes fluttered as he regained consciousness. The moment he opened his eyes, a sharp light flashed and he turned over to get up.</p>

  <p>"Puff, puff, puff!"</p>

  <p>His body resembled a deflated rubber ball, and several blood streams were shot out from his body as he activated his power. Some of the wounds had only just healed, so couldn't withstand Zheng's vigorous movements.</p>

  <p>"Master, you are still weak," Saul said.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shook his head, unbothered by anything. He twisted his body and used his strength to force the gaping wounds to heal. He said, "Take me to the True Path!"</p>

  <p>"Master, you want to go through the True Path once again?" Saul asked.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded his head and took a step forward.</p>

  <p>In the past, Mike had given him advice and revealed some significant secrets of the fairy palace. He mentioned that there were powerful creatures there, and if he promised to release them, then these creatures could assist him if he ever needed help.</p>

  <p>If the Evolutionary Universe couldn't resist the enemy's attack, then Luo Zheng would have one last chance: to go to the True Path to seek for help.</p>

  <p>However, Mike repeatedly told him not to do this unless he had no other choice. "One of the rules is that only one low-rank True God is allowed to appear in the universe," Mike once said.</p>

  <p>If there were two or more than two True Gods present in one universe at the same time, the Hall of Holy Beings would be notified of this violation and impose punishment. If Murphy arrived in the Evolutionary Universe, he could destroy it within a short period of time.</p>

  <p>Before this, Wynn, a True God, had already arrived in the universe.</p>

  <p>Mike's so-called 'last gamble' was to abandon the Evolutionary Universe entirely, and give up his own life in order to save Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>During the battle, Luo Zheng learned that the rules of the Hall of Holy Beings changed over time, which was why Pranav had called Marko and Mateo over in the first place.</p>

  <p>"Master, your condition right now isn't good enough. If you go to the True Path now..." Saul tried to warn him, but he saw Zheng's expression and trailed away.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng returned from the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, his strength had altered which made him a qualified warrior to take on the True Path. But now that Luo Zheng was so heavily injured, Saul remained concerned. As Luo Zheng walked further and further on the True Path, the Sacred race's strength would grow stronger as well. If Luo Zheng was not careful, he'd face his own death eventually.</p>

  <p>Currently, Luo Zheng had a total of five tokens in his possession: the water token for entering the library, the fire token for entering the weapon refining workshop, the thunder token for entering the True Path, the wind token for entering the fairy palace, and the mountain token for projecting the fairy palace around him. There were three remaining tokens which were the heaven, earth, and valley tokens.</p>

  <p>The token of valley could be used to open the pill refining room, the token of earth was used to open the cultivation tower, and the token of heaven was used to open the dungeon in the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>The last three tokens were the most difficult to attain within the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>Although Saul tried to talk him out of it, Luo Zheng didn't flinch or doubt in the slightest way. He was so sure of what he had to do.</p>

  <p>Before leaving, Luo Zheng already understood the situation of the universe. He was very clear on what the appearance of the three True Gods meant.</p>

  <p>Even if Wynn had more cards up his sleeves, he couldn't reverse the situation on his own. In such a situation, a battle among the Supreme Lords lost its significance once Wynn perished. If a single True God fought Wynn, and the other two True Gods persistently killed the Supreme Lords, one could only imagine what would have happened.</p>

  <p>It was inevitable that Luo Zheng would have chosen to enter the True Path.</p>

  <p>Upon entering the fairy palace, Luo Zheng activated the token of thunder immediately. As the vast fog rose, Luo Zheng once again set foot on the same path.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the situation of the universe was just as Luo Zheng had expected.</p>

  <p>As the Supreme Lords of the two universes were at war, the Supreme Lords of the Evolutionary Universe had a great advantage over their opponents.</p>

  <p>The Evolutionary Universe was highly dominated by the Celestial Position race and the four great clans. Countless years ago, they began making all sorts of preparations. They also foresaw the crisis of this world of chaos breaking out, so their preparations became much more thorough than those of the Sacred race.</p>

  <p>In addition to this, when a person was on the verge of death, they would always be able to erupt with astonishing strength. This became the final struggle of the Evolutionary Universe: every Supreme Lord would exhaust all their strength because there was nowhere for them to retreat.</p>

  <p>In fact, every single mortal prayed for the Evolutionary Universe to increase the momentum. It was that bad.</p>

  <p>Because of this, the head of the Celestial Position relied solely on the Evolution Lotus Flower to suppress the spinulose wood fern of the Sacred Race's Grand Supreme Lord. When it came to strength alone, the Grand Supreme Lord from Sacred race was slightly stronger than the head of the Celestial Position race.</p>

  <p>Until now, the number of destroyed supreme worlds were rising, and many Supreme Lords were killed. The heavens had shaken time and time again.</p>

  <p>Notably, only thirty-three Supreme Lords of the Evolutionary Universe had perished. As for the Sacred Supreme Lords, fifty of them were already long gone.</p>

  <p>"Shay, Jamal, Jace, Alyx, help me!"</p>

  <p>"Annihilation Thunder Tower!"</p>

  <p>"Crack, crack!"</p>

  <p>Just then, a massive thunder tower formed and instantly descended, landing not too far away from Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment.</p>

  <p>The two Sacred Supreme Lords were killed without time for them to react.</p>

  <p>As Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment saw them get turned to ash, the corners of his mouth curved up into a cold smile. He turned his gaze towards another supreme world where the patriarchs of Thoughtless Minds were trying to break through the Sacred Spirit Array. This was formed by nine Supreme Lords of Sacred race. But despite their hopeful efforts, they were unable to succeed in the end.</p>

  <p>If Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment led the Supreme Lords of the Blessed Buddha Land to join in on the war, then the nine Sacred Supreme Lords would possibly have a weaker defense.</p>

  <p>The Sacred Supreme Lords perished left and right, mostly because they were outnumbered by the Evolutionary Universe Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>However, just as Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment was about to use the Grand Teleportation technique, a flag suddenly appeared in front of him.</p>

  <p>Across its surface was a strange, unidentifiable pattern. In the same moment, he felt a sharp pain go through his soul.</p>

  <p>Just then, Marko appeared beside this flag and chuckled at him. "Not bad. You know how to use your own Heavenly Destiny properly. If all of you joined forces, you might have the qualifications to fight me!"</p>

  <p>"True God!"</p>

  <p>When Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment saw Marko, he got shocked.</p>

  <p>And at the same time, Shay, Jamal, Jace and Alyx, the four Supreme Lords of the Blessed Buddha Land, were also in a state of high alert at the same time.</p>

  <p>"Haha! There's no need to be so nervous." Marko chuckled. "This Soul Searching Flag of mine is quite precious, and it particularly likes to devour souls. It could devoir your Gold Fighting Souls too. So do yourself a favor, and don't resist. I'll make sure you die quicker if you obey."</p>
