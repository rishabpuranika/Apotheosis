<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The other Godly Geniuses despised the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>A sixth-grade sect, or even a tenth-grade sacred place was nothing in their eyes. The forces they were under had jurisdiction over thousands of tenth-grade sacred places.</p>

  <p>So it was a surprise that Kurt was exceedingly polite and asked the Cloud Hall for a warrior.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyebrows were raised. "Godly Genius..."</p>

  <p>Yudie's eyes also flashed.</p>

  <p>She wasn't a stranger to how things worked around the Upper World.</p>

  <p>Ever since she ascended, Preston had already filled her in on the different levels of strength in the universe along with the different types of geniuses among warriors.</p>

  <p>Godly Geniuses were definitely the cream of the crop. They were the ones considered as the most talented and remarkable warriors in the entire universe due to their power and rarity.</p>

  <p>Yudie was rendered speechless for a moment. Her Cloud Hall was simply too powerful now that it had three Godly Geniuses. It might even be much stronger than she had ever expected. So how would it be graded? Was it an eleventh-grade sacred place? Or a twenty-first grade sacred place?</p>

  <p>None of the people from the Central Region really knew what 'Godly Genius' meant. All they knew was that Patrick had been chosen by this monk of the Spirit Supreme Realm, so that must meant that he was very talented. At that moment, they viewed Patrick as at least a divine-level talent.</p>

  <p>However, Nathan and the others were visibly surprised.</p>

  <p>"Cultivating him into a Godly Genius? Kurt, can you really make such a major decision on behalf of the Hidden Spirit Temple? Are you joking?"</p>

  <p>Nathan laughed.</p>

  <p>All of the Godly Geniuses were aware of their high status. They were symbolic of the future of their respective forces. Yet here was Kurt, randomly hand-picking a warrior from the Lower World with the goal of turning him into a Godly Genius.</p>

  <p>Kurt, however, merely smiled. "Have you ever seen a monk lie or say something reckless?"</p>

  <p>"The Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment has done so before,"</p>

  <p>Lawson said. The Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment pertained to the strongest Supreme Lord in the Blessed Buddha Land.</p>

  <p>"That has nothing to do with me," Kurt replied, not really finding the need to argue with these two warriors anymore. He turned his gaze back at Yudie. "I would like to ask Cloud Hall's permission to take him away."</p>

  <p>Patrick was bound to be taken to the Blessed Buddha Land anyway no matter what Yudie said. Kurt had to naturally report this talent he had found to the Hidden Spirit Temple which would then, in turn, do everything in its power to take Patrick away. Kurt, however, saw the need to ask for Yudie's opinion first for formality's sake.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Patrick himself was still unsure as to what was currently happening.</p>

  <p>He had wanted to enter a temple in the past but there just weren't many powerful ones in the Central Region and most of the cultivation techniques weren't even suitable for him. All he could do was to rely on his own comprehension.</p>

  <p>His cultivation had reached the Virtual Tribulation Realm which made him the core strength of Cloud Hall though this was still a far cry from Tianming's and Zheng's level.</p>

  <p>Yudie smiled graciously. "Although Patrick is a disciple of Cloud Hall, I will not stop him if he has a better place to go to. Please ask him first if he agrees."</p>

  <p>Before Patrick could even say anything, Lewis already beat him to it.</p>

  <p>"What is a Godly Genius? I'll ask this question on his behalf."</p>

  <p>"There are three thousand Godly Ways in the universe. A so-called Godly Genius is someone who has the capacity to become a True God in the future, go beyond the universe and surpass the Supreme Lords. I cannot guarantee that Patrick will reach this level, but the reincarnation of Acalanatha..."</p>

  <p>Kurt trailed off and refused to finish his words.</p>

  <p>"What is a Supreme Lord?" Lewis asked once again.</p>

  <p>A Lower World warrior had no clear concept of immortality, so this was an opportunity for Lewis to gain knowledge and satisfy his own curiosity.</p>

  <p>"A Supreme Lord is someone who carries the Heavenly Destiny, an invincible being in the universe," Kurt answered truthfully.</p>

  <p>"What is second to a Supreme Lord?" Lewis continued.</p>

  <p>His incessant questioning annoyed even the patient Kurt. Tianming and Patrick had already rolled their eyes with his questions.</p>

  <p>"If you want to know the division of power among the warriors within this universe, I can tell you in private," Kurt replied curtly.</p>

  <p>Lewis laughed. "I've finished my questions! Ha-ha!"</p>

  <p>Zheng couldn't help but look at Patrick with a smile. This opportunity was extremely hard to obtain for any warrior and he believed that Patrick was in no way going to let this pass.</p>

  <p>Just as he expected, Patrick cupped his hands in greeting. "I am willing to go with Kurt." He knew that his choice would lead to a tremendous change in his future though he couldn't imagine just how big it was going to be just yet.</p>

  <p>Nathan and Lawson were once again driven speechless.</p>

  <p>Their thoughts were in complete disarray. Just what kind of damned place was this great world? Why was it so mystical?</p>

  <p>The world of chaos arrived and there were only about ten Godly Geniuses. Nearly half of them came from this great world.</p>

  <p>It didn't make sense, statistically speaking.</p>

  <p>Most of the warriors present felt incredible envy grip their hearts at this wonderful opportunity that presented itself in front of Patrick. Their cultivation levels were not high but they were wise enough to know that these experts had extremely special backgrounds. Patrick was only a Virtual Tribulation Realm warrior, but he now had the chance to enter the universe.</p>

  <p>With this out of the way, they all continued with the banquet. As everyone enjoyed themselves, a hairline space crack suddenly appeared on the other side of Cloudy City where rays of green light burst forth.</p>

  <p>A green shadow drilled out from the space crack and from it emerged the supreme sorcerer of the sorcerer race!</p>

  <p>He raised the jade bone cane in his hand and waved it in the air wherein a green incantation circle appeared.</p>

  <p>The Godly Geniuses were currently gathered here. If he could kill all of them at this place, all at once, then that would be a good thing for the sorcerer race!</p>

  <p>He had to be wary though. These Godly Geniuses were most likely being protected by the members of the Celestial Position in secret.</p>

  <p>So this time, he had to go all out and use a devastating method that he was sure would eliminate all of them.</p>
