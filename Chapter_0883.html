<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 883 Dominant Physical Strength </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Despite facing against an orc war lord gone berserk, Luo Zheng stood his ground and refused to retreat.</p>

  <p>This encounter would only serve as the one of many fights he would be taking part in once he ascended the Tower of Sin's upper floors. Although his cultivation base had been increasing at a faster rate, he still found it important to measure his true strength. Fighting this berserk orc war lord was a very good opportunity to do just that.</p>

  <p>Anyone who chose to walk the path of martial arts must always be adequately prepared and plan at least ten steps ahead. Luo Zheng, despite knowing that he had a good fate, knew that luck would not always be by his side.</p>

  <p>The only true way to survive a warrior's life was to continually persevere and strengthen himself.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes flashed dangerously as the orc lifted his battle axe and prepared to swing it down.</p>

  <p>He immediately countered it with his sword and a powerful force was transmitted through the clashing of their two weapons.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng felt his palm tingle slightly from the force waves that reverberated from the axe, through his sword, and up to his arm.</p>

  <p>Had it been another person facing the orc, he would've already let go of his sword!</p>

  <p>Clank! Clank! Clank!</p>

  <p>Each swing of their blades produced a crisp sound as they clashed. Both unyielding with their attack.</p>

  <p>However, just as the orc's axe came in contact once again with the sword, the blade slid and suddenly went through the thick steel. Zheng's sword had sliced the orc's axe in two!</p>

  <p>The orc war lord had originally been an independent cultivator so he naturally did not possess any good weapons. Though his battle axes were considered top-grade fairy weapons, they were still nothing against Zheng's top-grade sacred weapon.</p>

  <p>With his axes literally ripped to shreds by Zheng's blade, the orc war lord's attacks ceased.</p>

  <p>But it wasn't over. The orc threw away his weapons and let out an earthshaking roar!</p>

  <p>Layers upon layers of forceful energy began to coat his body, taking on the form of sparkling, black scales.</p>

  <p>"Another change? This is beast transmogrifying!"</p>

  <p>The beast transmogrifying method wasn't new to Luo Zheng since he had seen Owen use it back in the Central Region. The only difference now was that an orc's beast transmogrifying ability was inborn since a portion of their bloodline was originally inherited from wild beasts.</p>

  <p>As soon as the black scales covered his entire body, the orc war lord immediately rushed towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng sneered, "You think your layer of scales will be enough to block my sword?"</p>

  <p>A top-grade sacred weapon's hardness and strength were out of this world!</p>

  <p>Undeterred by the orc war lord charging towards him, Luo Zheng stood his ground and lifted his blade.</p>

  <p>Against his top-grade sacred weapon, the layer of scales on the orc war lord's body was like fragile sheets of paper. Luo Zheng swung his sword down and expected to cut through the orc's flesh - however, this wasn't what happened.</p>

  <p>The moment his blade touched the scales, a powerful force suddenly erupted from the orc and deflected Zheng's sword!</p>

  <p>"BAM!"</p>

  <p>The moment his sword was deflected, the orc did not waste any time and slammed into Zheng's body hard.</p>

  <p>Being a war lord of the orc race, the full-force collision was undoubtedly powerful. The collision forced Luo Zheng to fly back several feet before falling heavily to the ground and leaving a crater in his wake. The top-grade long sword also swung in the air and landed some distance away from him with a clang.</p>

  <p>Olivia and the other humans were quickly on their feet in worry. They had initially been confident with Zheng's strength but they never imagined such a quick turning of the tide.</p>

  <p>"It looks like Luo Zheng isn't quite a match against a war lord yet."</p>

  <p>"I overestimated his strength. It seems the gap between a war general and a war lord is too wide to cross."</p>

  <p>"Shush! We shouldn't be too worried. Luo Zheng might have some tricks up his sleeve."</p>

  <p>The collision left Luo Zheng in a sorry state. The forceful energy of a war lord really wasn't something to be underestimated.</p>

  <p>However, despite suffering a powerful blow, Luo Zheng was still alive and moving. The energy within his body rolled while streams of primordial energy flowed through his veins. Not only was he able to stand, but he was entirely uninjured!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng crawled out from the ground with a calm look on his face. "I was too careless," he muttered to himself. The scales on the orc's body were just an illusion. The plan all along was to wait for Luo Zheng to strike. Once he swung his sword down, the orc would release his energy, deflecting Zheng's blade and giving him a chance to knock him down.</p>

  <p>The orc war lord's body released a powerful Mu Ning. "Human brat!" he growled in a deep, distorted voice. "I will kill you and eat your flesh!"</p>

  <p>The beast transmogrification had turned the orc into a true, wild beast. He let out a mighty roar before once again charging towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Everyone inhaled sharply. Luo Zheng had just lost his weapon. How in the world was he going to deal with such a powerful enemy unarmed? Faced with such a dilemma, the rational course of action was to put some distance between him and his opponent.</p>

  <p>However, even under the astonished gazes of the crowd, Luo Zheng still didn't retreat.</p>

  <p>He retained his ground despite the imminent threat of a powerful orc war lord charging towards him. Clenching his fists, he began to conserve the energy within his body and activated all of his dragon scales at the same time!</p>

  <p>Every vein on his right fist bulged with power and, if his body hadn't been as strong as a top-grade fairy weapon, the force would've been enough to shatter his entire hand!</p>

  <p>Once the orc was close enough, Luo Zheng drew his fist and aimed a punch at his opponent! However, instead of being awed, the audience merely shook their heads in disappointment.</p>

  <p>Not a lot of people were confident with Zheng's fighting mode and a lot of them believed that the only way he stood a chance against the orc war lord was to fight smart and keep his distance from his opponent. However, Luo Zheng had now chosen to fight with his physical strength, evident by the punch he was about to throw.</p>

  <p>"Zheng's hand is probably going to be crippled," someone remarked as he shook his head.</p>

  <p>As soon as he said those words, Zheng's fist landed directly on the orc war lord's chest that had been covered with a layer of black scales. A large amount of forceful energy erupted once again from the scales but was not enough to deflect Zheng's fist.</p>

  <p>The orc war lord never stood a chance. Once Luo Zheng unleashed his full strength, not even a top-level war lord would be able to withstand it.</p>

  <p>"BAM!"</p>

  <p>As soon as Zheng's fist struck down, half of the orc war lord's body caved in.</p>

  <p>The orc war lord managed to maintain his momentum and quickly rushed to the side, however, there was no denying that Zheng's punch severely injured him. His steps faltered before he fell to the ground completely and coated the arena floor with a small pool of his own blood.</p>

  <p>An orc's blood essence was vigorous and his body stored blood in far greater volume than any other living creatures. Thankfully, the gurgling blood flow was soon completely absorbed by the Tower of Sin and it prevented the arena from being flooded with the red substance.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>A few faint rays of Lucky Light spiraled out of the war lord's token and shot straight towards Zheng's chest.</p>

  <p>Although the war lord had ascended mostly through default victories, he still took the time to challenge others every time he stepped onto a new floor so his token contained a small amount of Lucky Light.</p>

  <p>The sight of Luo Zheng killing an orc war lord with a single punch put him into a new light in the eyes of everyone present.</p>

  <p>"Not only is he proficient in the law powers but he also has powerful strength and an extremely strong body!"</p>

  <p>"Cultivating both body and life vitality is very difficult for martial cultivators! Most fail to balance the two and end up with a David's Deer," another one remarked. "Luo Zheng seems to be an exception!"</p>

  <p>"I really look forward to the day he becomes a war lord! When that day comes, even if he does not use the power of the Tower of Sin, no one will be his match in this tower!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng walked to his long sword and put it away in his space ring before making his way out of the arena. Just as he walked out, a sixth-level ogre war lord came towards him.</p>

  <p>The moment the ogre made his approach, Olivia's and Cheryl's eyes quickly flickered.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng was able to control the power of the Tower of Sin and was more than capable of protecting himself, the Demon Night and the human race could not be put at ease. Nobody wanted anything to happen to him at this point in time so both races had sent people to protect Luo Zheng in private.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng!" the ogre called out.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng raised an eyebrow. "What do you want?" he asked indifferently.</p>

  <p>"Maurice wants to have a talk with you," the ogre answered, referring to their race's elder.</p>

  <p>"When?" Luo Zheng asked, raising an eyebrow.</p>

  <p>"Tonight!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded in affirmation, "I know it now. Thank you."</p>

  <p>Once he had delivered his message, the ogre quickly turned around and left.</p>

  <p>With him gone, Cheryl and Olivia quickly made their way towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng greeted Olivia with a smile, "You were right! They're already in a hurry to negotiate!"</p>

  <p>Cheryl nodded at Zheng's words, "I'll go inform Esther!" she said.</p>

  <p>No one would be able to guarantee that Maurice would be fair in the negotiations. As the number two seat owner of the Tower of Sin, he surely had some tricks up his sleeve. Esther's presence was necessary since she was the only person who could intimidate Maurice.</p>

  <p>Cheryl made quick work of informing Esther about Maurice's invitation while Olivia did the same to Elder Jing. Upon nightfall, many top-level war lords descended from the upper floors. All four seat-owners from the human race were present while Esther and the other three seat-owners from Demon Night also arrived.</p>

  <p>Since the ogres themselves had initiated the negotiations, the result of that night's talks would be especially important.</p>
