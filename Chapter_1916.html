<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>News of Holy Drew's failure spread throughout the divine land back then. Many weapon refiners mocked him and thought that he had truly been too naive.</p>

  <p>The primordial energy-based weapon refining method had been passed down for generations and was the orthodox method for all weapon refiners in the entire divine land.</p>

  <p>However, this person here was proposing for a new path in refining weapons through the use of chaotic energy. He was clearly delusional and probably had no idea what he was doing.</p>

  <p>Holy Drew's first failure cost him his entire wealth.</p>

  <p>Holy Drew had been depressed for a long time after his first failure.</p>

  <p>There was an established social structure for the divine land. All weapon refiners were required to register in the Weapon Refining Association to get their exclusive tokens and be allowed to sell and auction their wares.</p>

  <p>However, Holy Drew had already been expelled from the weapon refining sect he was in which meant he couldn't sell the weapons he had secretly refined. The only choice he had was to trade them in black-market auctions at a low price.</p>

  <p>Since his situation was like this then Holy Drew would have to spend an extremely long time accumulating his wealth in order to get enough chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>Still, he did not give up.</p>

  <p>Given his endless lifespan then time wasn't that much of an issue. As he accumulated his wealth, his long life ensured him of multiple chances of getting things right.</p>

  <p>However, he did not expect such a chance to come so quickly in the form of Holy Bromley of the divine land.</p>

  <p>That time, Bromley and Mike had already started exploring the chaos.</p>

  <p>The story of this young weapon refiner unintentionally made its way to them and caught their interest.</p>

  <p>In the end, the two of them sought Holy Drew out and offered to provide him with chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>Their words extremely moved Holy Drew.</p>

  <p>He was determined to forge a supreme chaotic weapon even if it took him a hundred years to do so. He had no idea just how long he would have to save up in order to achieve his goals and there was no guarantee that he would succeed.</p>

  <p>Of course, he could still try again and again.</p>

  <p>However, that would take him an extremely long time.</p>

  <p>Success wasn't that easy.</p>

  <p>He failed a total of 76 times before he successfully refined his first supreme chaotic weapon.</p>

  <p>Bromley studied chaos deeply and he was sure that the chaotic energy could be utilized in forging a weapon. Primordial energy could be considered similar to life vitality but chaotic energy was somewhat a bit different. It exceeded this level of life vitality and was the source of all things, nonetheless, it could still very much be used to refine a supreme chaotic weapon.</p>

  <p>On his seventy-seventh attempt, Holy Drew finally refined his first supreme chaotic weapon!</p>

  <p>The appearance of this supreme chaotic weapon shocked the entire divine land. At first, the Weapon Refining Association refused to acknowledge its existence. It was only with the help of Holy Bromley that the divine land finally saw it as a legitimate weapon.</p>

  <p>By relying on this method, Holy Drew created a school comparable to the school of supreme primordial weapon.</p>

  <p>His development soon became unstoppable. Refining supreme chaotic weapons opened up an entirely new path to Holy Drew and he soon established his own sect. His sect then gradually stood up to the Weapon Refining Association as an equal.</p>

  <p>There was nothing that the Weapon Refining Association could do. It was an association that consisted of established weapon refiners but they were all pushed back by the oncoming trend of these supreme chaotic weapons. Whether it was top-rank True Gods, or Holy Beings, all of them were after these supreme chaotic weapons. The value of supreme primordial weapons dropped as a result which never really happened before.</p>

  <p>However, despite reaching this level, Holy Drew still wasn't fit to be called a Holy Being who specialized in weapon refining.</p>

  <p>His continued success went unprecedented. Quite some time later though, he did something that once again shook the entire divine land.</p>

  <p>Holy Drew plucked out one of his eyeballs and refined it to become the Devil's Eye!</p>

  <p>This eyeball was a supreme chaotic weapon but its main purpose wasn't to defend against enemies. The Devil's Eye was actually a massive world built by Holy Drew, which was similar to a universe.</p>

  <p>Once forged, it was then placed at the edge of the divine land, like the other universes.</p>

  <p>Hole Drew never stepped into the Holy Realm nor did he ever reach the cultivation level of a Holy Being. He remained a mid-rank True God until he forged the Devil's Eye.</p>

  <p>Such a shocking feat earned him the qualification to become a Holy Being. This method of becoming a member of the Hall of Holy Beings was definitely unique and it was the first time it ever happened in the divine land.</p>

  <p>It was only at that time that Holy Drew's name appeared in the divine land.</p>

  <p>He was probably the first and last person to be able to become a Holy Being as a weapon refiner.</p>

  <p>Holy Jay undoubtedly paid a huge price just to get Holy Drew to come here. The latter came most probably because he placed a high value on old friendships.</p>

  <p>Holy Drew might not be able to help Mike fight against the Hall of Holy Beings but he could help Zheng to the best of his abilities. He was very curious about the young man's body. He refined a lot of supreme chaotic weapons in his time but he had never seen a warrior who could take chaotic energy for his own use.</p>

  <p>"If the person is really Holy Drew, then what is he planning by taking Zheng away?" Kennan asked.</p>

  <p>Liusu blinked. "Is he going to refine Zheng?" She knew Zheng's body was special which led her to this conclusion but this was only a rough guess on her part.</p>

  <p>Kennan nodded. "It's possible. I'm afraid Zheng's in trouble."</p>

  <p>Holy Drew's legend was widespread but everyone knew of the man's eccentric personality. It wouldn't surprise them if he did decide to refine Zheng himself.</p>

  <p>However, in fact he would help the young man refine his body and not in the way they thought. They sounded similar but were actually quite completely different cases.</p>

  <p>Zheng's body had always been very passively refined ever since he cultivated the Grand Weapon Refining Method. He was able to use the primordial energy for refinement with the help of the red dragon.</p>

  <p>However, the red dragon wasn't a weapon refiner himself and the cyan dragon was also not proficient in body refining.</p>

  <p>This time, Holy Drew himself personally took action since he wanted to carry out a complete weapon refining process for Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>He already had a rough idea of how he would do this but it was still his first time refining a living person. Zheng's physique was unique and the cultivation methods he practiced were also very special. There was no knowing what the final result for this attempt would be.</p>

  <p>Unwilling to see Zheng was taken away like that, Liusu jumped out of the crowd and ran at full speed. "Uncle Holy Drew! I am a member of the Han Clan, Liusu Han!" she shouted loudly.</p>

  <p>All of the warriors present were immediately dumbfounded upon finding out the man's status.</p>

  <p>Nobody thought that the one-eyed man in front of them was actually Holy Drew who created the supreme chaotic weapons.</p>

  <p>The one-eyed man looked back and took a glance at Liusu. Just one glimpse already assured him that this was truly Holy Samuel's eldest daughter who possessed the Voiced Blood.</p>

  <p>However, her shout did not deter him. Instead of responding, he moved down quickly.</p>

  <p>Liusu pouted. Since Zheng was being taken away, she had no choice but to continue giving chase.</p>

  <p>The cave wasn't very deep. Holy Drew quickly arrived at the bottom where there was a curved entrance of another cave lit with green flames.</p>

  <p>Carrying Zheng, Holy Drew rushed into the cave with no hesitation.</p>

  <p>This cave was the very same one Chapman and Kaydan discovered back then.</p>

  <p>Both of them had mixed feelings when they saw this. They were counting on Zheng to enter the cave and bring out the door.</p>

  <p>Right now, Zheng did indeed enter the cave but he didn't do it by himself.</p>

  <p>He was now held captive by Holy Drew which complicated the entire situation.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>There was a loud, booming noise as Chapman smashed his fist on the wall. He had travelled a long way to bring Zheng to the destination but something as ridiculous as this happened. Now all they could do was stand there helplessly.</p>

  <p>The cave was illuminated and filled with green flames. The one-eyed man brought Zheng in and tossed him to the ground.</p>

  <p>Zheng quickly rolled over and stood up. He couldn't help but glare at the one-eyed man.</p>

  <p>The green flames burned him and his body was already glowing golden as he began to frantically absorb the green flames.</p>

  <p>"What are you trying to do?" Zheng asked coldly.</p>

  <p>However, the one-eyed man did not answer. He simply moved his body and swung the golden hammer towards Zheng's chest!</p>

  <p>It happened so fast that Zheng was unable to react on time. Before he even knew what was happening, the golden hammer already hit him on the chest.</p>

  <p>There was a muffled sound as an extremely great power spread out from the golden hammer and entered Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, despite being hit with such strong force, it was distributed quite evenly and penetrated into every part of Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>Even so, Zheng still felt as if he'd been struck by lightning and all his internal organs had been displaced.</p>
