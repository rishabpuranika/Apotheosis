<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Fren never thought that Luo Luo Zheng could be so strong-willed.</p>

  <p>In other words, did he not have the courage of a lion? He was completely supercilious!</p>

  <p>The Zhuge Clan was one of the top seven noble clans of the Burning Sky Empire. The family had remained in power from the beginning of the Burning Sky Empire!</p>

  <p>He didn't even blink his eyes upon hearing about the Zhuge Clan. If Fren's family's reputation could not cause him the slightest apprehension, then what else could?</p>

  <p>Fren had always boasted of his demented nature. However, his attitude was based on the powerful background of his family.</p>

  <p>Compared with Luo Luo Zheng, the difference was not just a little bit.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was such a man of hubris!</p>

  <p>Embarrassment was what Fren felt right now.</p>

  <p>Deep in Fren's heart, he desired to tear Luo Luo Zheng to pieces!</p>

  <p>He could have done that.</p>

  <p>But if he killed someone in the Blessed Auction House, it might anger the Zhang Clan. His family could, however, bear the consequences.</p>

  <p>As was known to all, there was never a dead enemy between two noble clans. And if a dispute occurred between the Zhuge Clan and the Zhang Clan, the Zhuge Clan could settle this matter by giving a bit of profit to the Zhang Clan.</p>

  <p>He had made a mistake when he had shown respect for the Zhang Clan and promised not to hurt Luo Luo Zheng here. 'Damn it. I shouldn't have said that, '</p>

  <p>Fren regretted. He was overconfident and thought that he could threaten the low-born Luo Luo Zheng...</p>

  <p>It would not be appropriate to kill Luo Luo Zheng now as he said that he wouldn't hurt Luo Luo Zheng here.</p>

  <p>The evil smile on Fren's face disappeared. He stared at Luo Luo Zheng with livid disbelief.</p>

  <p>"As an outer disciple, what makes you think you are capable of offending the Zhuge Clan? How dare you!" Vivan, who was standing behind Fren, could not stay silent anymore. She had never seen this kind of expression on Fren's face. He seemed unusually angry. And the person who had angered him was an outer disciple who was only a half-step into the nature level!</p>

  <p>"Forget it, Vivan!" shouted Fren?as he turned and glared at Vivan.</p>

  <p>"But Fren..." Vivan tried to crucify Luo Luo Zheng. She was not reconciled.</p>

  <p>"Let's go!" said Fren in a low but harsh voice as he interrupted Vivan.</p>

  <p>Then he turned and walked away. He was too embarrassed to stay.</p>

  <p>Vivan didn't dare to contradict Fren. She glared at Luo Luo Zheng as if she would devour him. Then she followed Fren out of the auction house.</p>

  <p>It was not until Fren and Vivian had left the Blessed Auction House that Wurth, Nory, Sean, and other people came around.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, you are the boss! That was awesome!" exclaimed Nory?and Sean in unison.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Vivan had come to warn Luo Luo Zheng on Fren's behalf, they had become very nervous and were ready to fight back. But again, Luo Luo Zheng surprised them. He was even more arrogant! Despite Fren's family background, Luo Luo Zheng had treated Fren anyway that pleased him! He told Fren to die! And now he had embarrassed Fren. Luo Luo Zheng was really brave.</p>

  <p>Wurth said with a huge grin, "I have never seen Fren be humiliated before. He's the one who bullies people. Luo Luo Zheng, you are the first one to bully him!"</p>

  <p>Wurth never showed off. As a member of the Zhang Clan, his knowledge and information were much more profound than Nory's and Sean's. The fact that the Zhang Clan had been able to develop under the pressure of the top seven noble clans proved their incomparable strength. So Wurth saw more thoroughly.</p>

  <p>"Fren walked away speechless. I'm afraid that Fren was really angry this time," said Wurth. "Luo Luo Zheng, you made him that angry. Aren't you afraid that he..."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, however, said with a smile, "Wurth, if I feigned to be weak and humble, would he spare me?"</p>

  <p>Wurth froze and thought for a while before he said, "You are right. Even if you had been nice to him, he would not let it pass easily."</p>

  <p>"Now that the consequence is the same, why should I be afraid of him?" said Luo Luo Zheng as he raised his eyebrow gently. Cruel intent reflected in his eyes.</p>

  <p>He knew that dealing with such an enemy was just like dealing with a cunning wolf. A person had to be more ruthless and crazy than his opponent to seize the chance of victory. If a person showed the slightest hint of retreat, the enemy would tear him to pieces.</p>

  <p>"Very good point! Unbelievable!"</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng and his friends turned toward the voice, they saw a man enter through the door of the auction house. He was eight feet tall, had a stalwart figure, and walked with an air. He looked like Wurth, but he was not as fat as Wurth.</p>

  <p>The man ambled toward them, then said to Wurth, "Wurth, is he your friend?"</p>

  <p>"His name is Luo Luo Zheng. He is also a disciple at Drizzle Peak," replied Wurth as he introduced his brother to Luo Luo Zheng. "Luo Luo Zheng, this is my elder brother, Wick Zhang."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng didn't feel the need to patronize Wick because of his family's reputation. But he was Wurth's brother. And so, Luo Luo Zheng decided to be polite to him. He bowed to Wick.</p>

  <p>"You are the first one to embarrass Fren!" Wick said with a smile,</p>

  <p>"Wurth, you've got a great friend!"</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Wick. I appreciate it! If there were another way, I would not mess with Fren," said Luo Luo Zheng as he shook his head.</p>

  <p>"You are welcome. I am only a few years older than you, so I am not that old. No need to bow to me," Wick said with a smile. "Luo Luo Zheng, the item you bought has not been delivered yet. Please follow me. I will hand over the cubic crystals and the Weapon Refining Principle."</p>

  <p>Wick looked honest and straightforward. But he was physically strong and seemed highly intelligent. Although he admired Luo Luo Zheng for what he did to Fren today, he did not speak much about it. Luo Luo Zheng?was Wurth's friend.</p>

  <p>However, it was unrealistic to support Luo Luo Zheng against Fren. He needed to keep his family's interests in mind first.</p>

  <p>The Zhang Clan was running family business, not charity. It would be a significant loss if Wick also supported Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>But as members of the Zhang Clan, Wurth and Wick were extraordinarily wise.</p>

  <p>They were very optimistic about Luo Zheng's future. If Luo Luo Zheng were capable of beating Fren, his future would be bright! And they would be happy to see that.</p>
