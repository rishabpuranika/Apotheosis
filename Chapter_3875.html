<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>This Cloud Light Sail was an auxiliary type of Other Shore Token from Stage Thirty-three.</p>

  <p>Theoretically, if enough energy was put into it, the Cloud Light Sail could become incredibly fast.</p>

  <p>This Other Shore Token wasn't the most popular of Other Shore Tokens on Stage Thirty-three since it was helpful only during travel. But the Snake Goddess had still merged with it, and it was now coming in handy.</p>

  <p>The Cloud Light Sail was fast, but the amount of energy it consumed was astonishing. It wouldn't last long even if the Snake Goddess had cast her shadow in it.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, even the range of perception the strong masters like Grandmaster of Heaven and Claire had by way of their spiritual sense was limited. The Snake Goddess assumed that if they were far away from their pursuers, they would be able to escape.</p>

  <p>They headed east, moving further and further away from the Grandmaster of Heaven and Claire. Fuxi was relieved.</p>

  <p>He had fought a good many head to head battles in the past few years, but the other Eternal Realm warriors in the Source World always gave in to him. And now, he was the one running away. It was hard for him to accept.</p>

  <p>Deep in his heart, Fuxi didn't think he was incapable of fighting them. But the Snake Goddess had made a strategy and he had no choice but to follow her plan and escape.</p>

  <p>Once Fuxi's spiritual sense could no longer perceive the existence of the Grandmaster of Heaven and Claire, he said to the Snake Goddess, "Have we shaken them off?"</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess was ahead of Fuxi, but her spiritual sense could perceive much more than Fuxi could.</p>

  <p>"No, I'm afraid we can't get rid of them just by relying on our speed," the Snake Goddess answered calmly.</p>

  <p>The distance between them was increasing but the Grandmaster of Heaven and Claire had extraordinary tracking abilities that no ordinary Eternal Realm warrior could compare to. It would be difficult to get rid of them when they were in the same big province.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess stretched out two thin fingers, several small creatures appearing at her fingertips.</p>

  <p>These creatures were like jellyfish, a mushroom crowning the top of their heads. The mushroom was cracked and two horns sat on top of it. Funnily enough, they looked like monsters that were making faces. Thin tentacles floated below the heads, emitting rays of light in perfect symmetry.</p>

  <p>"Ghost Jellyfish Mask, transform!"</p>

  <p>The Ghost Jellyfish Mask was a rare Other Shore Token on Stage Thirty-three. It could easily change into shapes of other creatures and was also an auxiliary type of Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess was the incarnation of wisdom. She had cultivated several Truths of Godly Ways and had mastered several Other Shore Tokens of auxiliary type.</p>

  <p>Other Shore Tokens of auxiliary type weren't strong by themselves, and ordinary people didn't want any of them to take up a Truth of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>However, when more than one Other Shore Tokens of auxiliary type were combined, the effect they had would often be terrifying.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>The Ghost Jellyfish Mask quickly turned into the reflections of the Snake Goddess and Fuxi.</p>

  <p>The fake Snake Goddess was connected with the fake Fuxi using the shadow of Snake Goddess, and they were quickly sent backwards.</p>

  <p>Before long, Fuxi found two identical figures of them floating in front of him too. They were also connected by a shadow of Snake Goddess as they moved forward.</p>

  <p>"Let's head south!"</p>

  <p>Saying thus, the Snake Goddess dragged Fuxi and headed south.</p>

  <p>The fake Snake Goddesses and Fuxis were heading east and north, one pair in each direction.</p>

  <p>Claire and the Grandmaster of Heaven who were in hot pursuit after them felt the change at the same time. They looked at each other, stoic in their confusion.</p>

  <p>Their spiritual sense could cover a long distance, easily sensing anything within a large province.</p>

  <p>But once their targets moved beyond their range, they became blurry, making it difficult for them to find the true ones.</p>

  <p>And the Snake Goddess had perfectly used the Ghost Jellyfish Mask to create their clones.</p>

  <p>Claire and the Grandmaster of Heaven had been quite confident at the beginning, but they began to panic when they suddenly found their targets head in three different directions.</p>

  <p>If each of them chose a different direction, they would have only one third of the chance to capture and nail down the real targets. If one were to find the true bodies of the people they were chasing, the other would fail. This was something they were finding hard to digest.</p>

  <p>'Do I have to split myself into several avatars to chase them?' Claire frowned.</p>

  <p>If it weren't for Grandmaster of Heaven, she would have done that. But Zheng had just absorbed one third of her body. If she did split into multiple avatars now, there was the possibility of the Grandmaster of Heaven killing her instantly.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven had the same concern. He had a secret technique with which he could create a powerful guard for himself that would have fifty percent of his strength. The downside of this technique was that his own strength would be reduced by half.</p>

  <p>The two of them wordlessly flew alongside each other for some time before finally choosing to go their separate ways.</p>

  <p>Claire went after the two avatars in the north, while the Grandmaster of Heaven chased the two avatars in the east. Neither made the effort to bother about the avatars in the south.</p>

  <p>Luck was on Snake Goddess and Fuxi's side, who were actually heading south.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess heaved a sigh of relief on sensing the change in their pursuers' directions. "They will go farther and farther away from us," she said.</p>

  <p>She infused a huge amount of energy into the two Cloud Light Sails that dragged the two fake pairs, enough for them to fly for some distance. By the time the Grandmaster of Heaven and Claire found out that they were chasing in the wrong directions, it would be too late to turn back.</p>

  <p>Once their targets split into three paths, Claire and the Grandmaster of Heaven sped up. They had to confirm whether the targets they were chasing were real as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>They gave chase for a distance before they realized that the speed of their targets was dropping.</p>

  <p>"Are these fake?" Claire exclaimed, frowning.</p>

  <p>She quickly shifted her attention to the targets that the Grandmaster of Heaven was chasing.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven also found that his targets had slowed down.</p>

  <p>He began to shift his attention to the targets that Claire was chasing.</p>

  <p>They were taken aback when they realized both of them had been chasing the wrong targets but they recovered quickly enough to turn around and head south. By this time, Fuxi and the Snake Goddess had already approached the edge of the Separate Amber Province.</p>

  <p>They would have a chance to escape once they flew out of the Separate Amber Province.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess and Fuxi were becoming more and more optimistic. If they could take Zheng away like this, the risks they had taken to snatch Zheng from Claire and the Grandmaster of Heaven would all be worth it.</p>

  <p>But they were just about to approach the boundary wall when a long spear suddenly shot out of the wall before them, taking them by surprise. .</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess had been vigilant all along and had considered every possible obstruction ahead of them. But she had ignored the boundary wall.</p>

  <p>She had ignored the Evil God who could control the boundary wall and detect everything that happened within the Separate Amber Province.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The spear shot through the space channel at a high speed and hit the Cloud Light Sail.</p>

  <p>The Cloud Light Sail was an excellent auxiliary type of Other Shore Token, but was also very fragile. It was shattered by the long spear, causing the Snake Goddess to roll to the side and come to an abrupt stop.</p>

  <p>Fuxi, who had been following behind, soon caught up with her. He stared at the boundary wall before asking, "What's wrong now?"</p>

  <p>The existence that could stop the Snake Goddess had to be strong.</p>

  <p>"Over there." The Snake Goddess pointed.</p>

  <p>The amber liquid on the boundary wall flowed and turned into a reflection of the Evil God. The highly condensed long spear had returned to his hand.</p>

  <p>"Devouring one is not enough for me. He has to stay." The Evil God pointed at Zheng who was on Fuxi's shoulder.</p>

  <p>"You want to court death?"</p>

  <p>Fuxi said, his countenance turning cold. If it was only a young man controlling the boundary wall, the man would be no match for him.</p>
