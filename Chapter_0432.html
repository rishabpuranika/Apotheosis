<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 432 Burning Blood Essence (Part Two) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>It was hard to predict who would win in the fight since both Zheng's and Tracy's strengths exceeded the normal level of the other disciples in the All Peaks Competition. Even their previous battles and experiences weren't of much help. Only when the match was over could they conclude the winner!</p>

  <p>"Zoom!"</p>

  <p>The sword that Zheng held cut upward, right through the five blue claw prints.</p>

  <p>An ear-splitting screeching sound, similar to claws scratching a smooth surface, came from the collision between Zheng's Streamer Sword and the five blue claw prints.</p>

  <p>"Oh my god!"</p>

  <p>"What is this noise?!"</p>

  <p>"It makes me dizzy! I'm going to vomit!"</p>

  <p>A lot of disciples who practiced poorly found the screech quite unbearable. Even those disciples who had reached the nature level consummation had gone pale--they were a bit uncomfortable, but they could tolerate it for the time being.</p>

  <p>Those disciples who had reached the level of Illuminating Soul Realm frowned slightly and barely reacted to the sound.</p>

  <p>A fierce sword intent wrapped the three-foot sword's simple chop and continuously melted the unusually aggressive claw prints. However, the claw of the Blue Phoenix was quite powerful too. If one were to look closely, they would find countless small wind shears around the claw prints which endlessly tore at the Streamer Sword.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Zheng's Streamer Sword was a fairy weapon, so it was strong enough to resist the small wind shears' attacks. If it was just a mysterious or a spiritual weapon, it would've been torn into two by now.</p>

  <p>After a mere second, Zheng's chop of the sword had finally taken over the blue claw prints and hacked them into pieces.</p>

  <p>"The blue claw prints are broken..."</p>

  <p>"It looks like Zheng's sword is stronger than the claw prints!"</p>

  <p>"Zheng only had an advantage over Tracy because of his weapon!" one of the disciples in the crowd said. "After all, he has a fairy weapon in his hands, and Tracy has nothing except her claw!" he added.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure that Zheng had edge over Tracy just because of his weapon?</p>

  <p>Have you forgotten that Zheng is just at the grade two of the nature level, while Tracy has already reached the Illuminating Soul Realm?" another one of them countered.</p>

  <p>When they realized what the latter just said, they all gasped in shock.</p>

  <p>They felt dumbfounded when they forgot what Tracy could do.</p>

  <p>She could rely on her great blood strength and the body of the Blue Phoenix. Moreover, she had already reached the level of Illuminating Soul Realm. On the contrary, Zheng was only at grade two of the nature level!</p>

  <p>Grade two of the nature level…</p>

  <p>It was a level lower than all the other disciples' levels in the All Peaks Competition. It was at the bottom of the level list of all the inner disciples of Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng stood on the battlefield of the All Peaks Competition and took part in the hard challenges one after the other, which they all couldn't have imagined. They didn't know what to say about the huge skill gap between them and Zheng. It was quite amazing!</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng paid absolutely no attention to other people's comments about him at that moment. After he slashed Tracy's claw prints into pieces with the sword, he kept going with it and performed another move. "Pick upwards!" he shouted.</p>

  <p>It was another simple move from the basic swordsmanship. Although it looked like it was easy to counterattack, it seemed that Zheng was the only sole master of this move! Even powerful men like Kenneth and Elder Xu couldn't find any flaws in Zheng's swordsmanship now.</p>

  <p>Despite that, of course, it did not mean that they would lose to Zheng in the competition. There was still a huge gap in skill between Zheng and them, and they could easily defeat Zheng with their immense strength.</p>

  <p>They couldn't win when faced with the move, though.</p>

  <p>Tracy had always kept her cool ever since she had activated the body of the Blue Phoenix. She looked like an incorruptible goddess when she had released massive amounts of power. However, that all changed a little now because of Zheng's attacks.</p>

  <p>She was a playful girl by nature and didn't like to practice. However, she could defeat most of the disciples in the same rank because of the body of the Blue Phoenix and her extraordinary talent, even if she didn't practice a lot.</p>

  <p>Thus, she still had a chance to win after she had activated the body of the Blue Phoenix--even if she fought against the mighty Patrick.</p>

  <p>Before her fight with Zheng, she thought that she could quickly finish the competition after she activated the body of the Blue Phoenix--but she didn't expect that Zheng could cut the Blue Phoenix's strongest killing trick of the claw prints, and he had even fought back now!</p>

  <p>For Tracy, Zheng was just like a small toy for her to play with.</p>

  <p>That was how she had always viewed Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, the small toy refused to obey and paid her no attention. Tracy, who had always been proud and stubborn, found it unacceptable--and it was why she was angry.</p>

  <p>Maybe other people, and also even Zheng might find her reason for getting angry unfathomable--but that was just how Tracy was, and how she had always been. She wanted to give Zheng a lesson and decided that it would be in the form of bleeding holes on his body.</p>

  <p>And that was what she did. Two Emei Pricks pierced Zheng's shoulder when the body of the Blue Phoenix was activated.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng had the upper hand when he raised his sword. Tracy felt that she was no match for him anymore!</p>

  <p>'Zheng is just at grade two of the nature level. Maybe he is special, but how can he even compete with me?</p>

  <p>How can he fight against me?</p>

  <p>He's just a nobody among hundreds of thousands of disciples in Cloud Sect! He is just one among the countless grains of sand!</p>

  <p>How can he win against me with the fucking basic swordsmanship, which he learned from nowhere!' Tracy angrily thought to herself.</p>

  <p>"I will never lose to you!" Tracy gritted her teeth and angrily declared.</p>

  <p>Her eyes began to blaze a fiery red. It only meant one thing: she was going to burn the blood of the Blue Phoenix.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Patrick, who stood next to the battlefield, saw that Tracy was forced to retreat by Zheng's basic swordsmanship. When he noticed the ruthless and vicious look on Tracy's face, he knew what was going to happen.</p>

  <p>His mouth immediately went dry. "Tracy, don't be stupid! Zheng, Tracy is going to burn the blood essence! It will damage her body for life! Stop her!" he shouted, panic evident in his voice.</p>
