<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon laughed and said,"The Owl Beast devil spirit has been tied by the Soul-nurturing Thunder Lock and has become extremely weak. It is almost as weak as me. What you need to do is merely break the Soul-nurturing Thunder Lock. I will deal with the rest."</p>

  <p>Zheng listened carefully but doubt made his expression turn bitter soon.</p>

  <p>"How can you do that for me? If you swallow the Owl Beast devil spirit, how will I explain its disappearance to the others?"</p>

  <p>This Owl Beast devil spirit had the Jasper Fighting Soul and wasn't easy to capture. If Zheng swallowed it in front of so many warriors, he would have no way to explain it.</p>

  <p>"Don't care about them. You can pretend to be insane... You can do whatever you want as long as you help me swallow the spirit. Needless to say, it will be of great benefit to you as well," the dragon said convincingly with a playful chuckle.</p>

  <p>Zheng's heart tightened at the dragon's words. With the vast knowledge the dragon had, he spoke of the spirit so highly. Zheng had no reason to think otherwise. This spirit seemed to be extremely skilled and powerful.</p>

  <p>"How can it be any good to me? Please tell me that first!"</p>

  <p>Zheng asked back hurriedly, starting to give away his fear.</p>

  <p>"I plan to use a part of the Owl Beast devil spirit to nurture myself, and some other part to wake my seventh elder brother. The rest of it can be used to build a soul seed for you," the cyan dragon replied with confidence. It seemed like he had all things planned in his head.</p>

  <p>"To wake your seventh elder brother?" Zheng repeated the cyan dragon's words in confusion. First of all, he was surprised to hear that the cyan dragon had a brother, let alone a seventh one!</p>

  <p>Zheng tried to recall the time when he first came to know the cyan dragon.</p>

  <p>In Zheng's soul sea, there was a total of nine genuine dragons. At the very beginning, all of them were like statues, completely lifeless. As Zheng started to use heavenly essence in great amounts and swallowed the flood dragon bone spear, one of them gained consciousness and recovered. No other dragons were affected.</p>

  <p>Even now the other eight dragons stood like statues around the giant furnace, frozen mid-action, as if the breath of life was taken away from them abruptly. The cyan dragon who spoke in Zheng's head, too, had recovered very, very slowly.</p>

  <p>Zheng presumed the seventh elder brother who the dragon had mentioned was one of those eight dragons around the furnace, but he had no way of knowing which one of them it was.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon was back into the Genuine Dragon World now, but couldn't show himself for some reasons. Once Zheng finished his training and returned to the Lower World, he would barely get the opportunity to meet a powerful soul like the Owl Beast devil spirit. Even if he did, he wouldn't be able to defeat it easily. This was why the cyan dragon asked Zheng to use this opportunity wisely.</p>

  <p>"My seventh elder brother is very good at practicing bodies. And your body has become a spiritual weapon with the help of the furnace. If your body keeps improving, it will grow into a fairy weapon. After you became a nature creature, the warmth produced by your body while practicing it could only nurture your own energy center. That wasn't very helpful to you. It's a pity you cannot continue improving body!"</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon explained calmly.</p>

  <p>But truth was that he was only feigning this calmness. Actually, the dragon was thinking about how Zheng's body was so special and there was no other like it anywhere else in the world. If Zheng kept practicing his body like this, the dragon couldn't even imagine the things he'd be able to accomplish in the future! The very thought excited the dragon but he didn't tell anything about it to Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Improve my body?" Zheng asked, bobbing his head from side to side.</p>

  <p>He had thought about practicing his body before. But fact was, most warriors in the Eastern Region and the Central Region did not practice their bodies, but cultivated their life vitality instead. The method of cultivation of a body refiner was completely different. The warriors who practiced their bodies needed to cultivate themselves with a kind of forceful energy.</p>

  <p>Compared to life vitality, forceful energy burst out from the body quicker, fiercer and more directly.</p>

  <p>The only problem was that cultivating both the body and the life vitality was very difficult and there were only a few people out of the entire human population who had even tried doing that.</p>

  <p>After a moment of silence, Zheng's eyes shone brightly. 'I have made great progress already, yet I am not powerful enough!' he thought. 'If I attempt to fight against Eddie, the Evil East Lord, I'd be killed in the blink of an eye!'</p>

  <p>His soul quivered as he thought about being weak in the face of adversity. A sort of rush filled him up, then he ran to the small Owl Beast ghosts without even asking the dragon what a soul seed was.</p>

  <p>'Let me kill them all!' Zheng told himself in his mind.</p>

  <p>He had no practice in the fighting skill of the soul, but the Spiritual Thorn was a good weapon to kill the small ghosts. There were a lot of these small ones but none of them was as powerful as Zheng thought they were.</p>

  <p>Zheng killed one Owl Beast ghost after the other, and returned to the area lit with the little oil lamp. He repeated this process several times and each cycle only made his soul stronger.</p>

  <p>Many warriors gazed at Zheng in the inner circle with jealousy which soon turned to depression. Compared with Zheng, the speed at which they were cultivating was so low that they didn't know how long they would take before getting into the inner circle. They were eager to step into the Fighting Soul Level.</p>

  <p>They watched as Zheng kept moving, fighting his way through one circle to the other. Before long, he stepped into the fourth circle. The warriors around had no choice but to accept that Zheng was far more talented than them. Some of them could not even be compared with him.</p>

  <p>After entering the fourth circle, his soul grew slower. Still, he fought for two whole days before returning from the black ball. After a whole day's rest, he went back to the black ball and continued his cultivation.</p>
