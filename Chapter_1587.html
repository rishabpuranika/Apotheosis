<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1587 Shoot An Arrow </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The figures of Janet and the short martial artist were blur as they both moved at the speed of lightning.</p>

  <p>Both of their strength could be ranked in the team's top three.</p>

  <p>Although the square pillars of light caused their speeds to slow down a bit, they had succeeded in setting up traps. There were now lines of traps on the floor from a side of the Hall of Causality.</p>

  <p>Janet had used something called the "Lofty Wood Texture." It was a profound mystery derived from the fifth level of the Wood Law. It was also one of her clan's extremely powerful techniques.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the thunder technique the short martial artist had used appeared to be extraordinary, which he hadn't explained.</p>

  <p>The two of them shuttled across the Hall of Causality just like that. Each of them would set up a trap each time reaching a square, and they had filled up one-third of the hall's area with traps within five minutes.</p>

  <p>Using their theurgies to set up traps had consumed lots of their strength.</p>

  <p>Thus, the two of them would rest for a while to replenish their life vitality as the pillars of light were released by the square boulders.</p>

  <p>This idiotic method consumed a great deal of life vitality, but they had no choice but to do so if they wanted to pass through this Hall of Causality.</p>

  <p>In any case--according to Luo Zheng's plan, the dark red grimace would definitely be crushed as long as that the traps covered the squares where all the giant rocks would go through, and that all the traps were activated at the same time.</p>

  <p>The others tried their best to help Janet and the short warrior while they dodged the rocks. For instance, the Demon Night woman had tied a light green feather into Janet's hair, which was taken from the Blue Phoenix's head. It allowed one to move effortlessly, and it did save Janet a lot of strength.</p>

  <p>However, an unexpected change happened.</p>

  <p>Something happened when this "grand project" was halfway set up.</p>

  <p>A ray of black light spread from the squares in the hall and released a strange burst of power!</p>

  <p>The black light spread out from the ground, but didn't harm any of the martial artists in the hall. However, when it disappeared, so did the traps Janet and the short martial artist had set!</p>

  <p>"Wh-what?!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng frowned deeply when he saw the scene.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Janet and the short martial artists were naturally upset.</p>

  <p>The other warriors simply remained silent.</p>

  <p>What had just happened meant that they weren't allowed to set traps in this Hall of Causality.</p>

  <p>Thus, the traps they had set up now were gone in a flash.</p>

  <p>"Buzz buzz buzz?"</p>

  <p>All the giant square boulders once again lined up in a row, and then released square beams of light.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Janet was already familiar with the boulders' movement patterns. She calmly stepped forward, walked into the safe spot, and asked Luo Luo Zheng what to do next.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Luo Luo Zheng was deep in thought.</p>

  <p>This Hall of Causality definitely had a method to work it out, but he just hadn't figured it out.</p>

  <p>When the huge rocks rolled, they actually had the opportunity to attack the dark red grimace hiding at the bottom.</p>

  <p>There were forty three rocks, but the team only had eight people. If each of them chose a boulder to guard, they would only have a one-in-five chance of coming into contact with the dark red grimace. As long as the dark red grimace appeared and the giant rock did not turn over, they would have the chance to destroy it.</p>

  <p>This plan was even more stupid than the previous one.</p>

  <p>However, they had no choice!</p>

  <p>Everyone was willing to spend five million Illusion Points to come here to have a single gamble, so no one wanted to quit right now.</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng had proposed his plan, the others had been very cooperative and did as he said!</p>

  <p>Everyone picked a huge rock and waited for the rocks to disperse. Before the light pillars shot out, everyone's attention shifted to the huge rock they chose and they began to check every side of the rolling rock.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had already taken out his dark golden long bow and got ready. He would shoot an arrow the moment his sharp eyes saw the dark red grimace appear in one of the rolling rocks!</p>

  <p>"Nothing!"</p>

  <p>"This one is no!"</p>

  <p>"Nothing here."</p>

  <p>"Boom, boom, boom?"</p>

  <p>As soon as they spoke, all the square boulders stopped rolling and began to emit square beams of light.</p>

  <p>Even if the dark red grimace appeared at this moment, Luo Luo Zheng and the others couldn't do anything to it at all. After all, neither Luo Luo Zheng nor the other warriors were able to flip the square boulder over. They could only wait for the next opportunity.</p>

  <p>The square boulders spread out, and then gathered in a row and spread out again.</p>

  <p>"Try again!"</p>

  <p>They found it extremely difficult to destroy the dark red grimace. First of all, they only had a one-fifth chance of finding the grimace, and they had to make their move before the square-shaped boulder turned over.</p>

  <p>However, none of them were discouraged.</p>

  <p>"Found it!"</p>

  <p>This time, it was the ogre who had found the grimace. The others' eyes were focused on the boulder beside him after they heard his shout.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, they all heard the sound of a bow being drawn at the same time!</p>

  <p>An arrow shot towards the enormous boulder at a high speed.</p>

  <p>The arrow came from Luo Luo Zheng, who had the fastest reaction time. Just as the ogre's voice rang out, Luo Zheng's right hand which already gripped the bowstring quickly loosened!</p>

  <p>However, a sharp sword light simultaneously shot out from another direction!</p>

  <p>The square boulder had already been half rolled over, and the dark red grimace would be covered below again as long as the boulder tilted forward.</p>

  <p>The two attacks were extremely fast and were about to pierce into the rock that hadn't completely turned over yet.</p>

  <p>"Crap!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng and the short martial artist were both dumbstruck.</p>

  <p>Just then, the streak of sword-light coincidentally collided with the black arrow!</p>

  <p>"Pak!"</p>

  <p>The two attacks collided with a clear and loud sound, and a refraction occurred. The black arrow flew up towards the ceiling, while the sword light nailed itself to the side of the boulder.</p>

  <p>Regret crossed everyone's faces when they all saw what happened.</p>

  <p>In particular, the ogre bitterly said, "It was very difficult to find this dark red grimace?"</p>

  <p>If it had been just one person who had taken action, perhaps they would have passed the Hall of Causality.</p>

  <p>The short martial artist just smiled faintly. "It doesn't matter. There is always a chance," he said lightly.</p>

  <p>The giant rocks rolled again and changed directions while everyone followed their movements.</p>

  <p>However, they couldn't find the dark red grimace for the next four times.</p>

  <p>On the fifth time, Luo Luo Zheng felt slightly annoyed as he stared at the huge rock in front of him.</p>

  <p>When the boulder flipped over, his face turned sour. He still didn't find the grimace.</p>

  <p>The woman from the Demon Night who was not far ahead of him suddenly pointed at the space behind Luo Luo Zheng. "Over there!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng turned his head on reflex as soon as he heard her, but he didn't have the time to adjust his longbow because of panic. Besides, the opportunity to attack the dark red grimace only lasted for a blink of an eye!</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng turned around, his right hand had already released the bowstring--but it didn't matter whether he had shot in the right direction, because he had grabbed onto a small skull on his right shoulder and thrown it at the giant boulder, as if he was acting on a conditioned reflex.</p>

  <p>The moment the square shaped boulder turned over, Luo Luo Zheng had succeeded in throwing the small skull into the bottom!</p>

  <p>"Boom...!"</p>

  <p>A muffled bang followed, then everyone saw that the square boulder could no longer turn over now.</p>

  <p>Even though the square boulder was unimaginably heavy, it didn't manage to crush the small skull into pieces. The small skull had actually stopped the boulder from turning just like that!</p>

  <p>"Be careful of that light beam!" Janet shouted from not far away.</p>

  <p>At that point, Luo Luo Zheng was still in the same direction where the light shot out from the square boulder.</p>

  <p>If the square-shaped light beam had hit him, he would undoubtedly die!</p>

  <p>There was a dull thud on the ground. Luo Luo Zheng had apparently collapsed!</p>

  <p>"Buzz buzz buzz?"</p>

  <p>Since the small skull was under the giant boulder, the light pillar that shot out from the boulder was tilted upwards.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had managed to dodge the square pillar of light, but he fell face-flat onto the ground!</p>

  <p>While Luo Luo Zheng was in that position, he took out another black arrow from his quiver.</p>

  <p>The square pillars of light would continue for a few more seconds, so Luo Luo Zheng had plenty of time now. His lips curved into a smile as he stared at the dark red grimace. Bow, aim, shoot!</p>

  <p>"Swish!"</p>

  <p>This black arrow whizzed out and was aimed at the grimace along the bottom, which the small skull had held up.</p>

  <p>Even then, Luo Luo Zheng was still a little worried. After all, he wasn't sure if the dark red grimace was the crux of passing through this Hall of Causality.</p>

  <p>It was merely their own speculation.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>The arrow flew right off and directly nailed itself onto the dark red grimace!</p>

  <p>At that moment, all of the light pillars simultaneously came to a halt; and the entire Hall of Causality returned to its calmness.</p>
