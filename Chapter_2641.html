<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As Timotheus led Leopold, Ramzi and the others, they didn't rush to the back of the tall platforms immediately.</p>

  <p>They had already attracted enough attention from most of the Wights.</p>

  <p>For them, Zheng's safety was their top most priority. And for that, they had to eliminate the Wights that surrounded them first. After all, they didn't know that Tyler and the others had eaten the medicine cakes. Hence, the Wights would not be following them towards the shadow behind the tall platforms.</p>

  <p>Behind the huge columns of the tall platforms, Tyler's face twitched slightly.</p>

  <p>He realized that their only means to escape was by killing Zheng.</p>

  <p>Tyler definitely did not want to die a pitiful death like other exiles from the smaller races.</p>

  <p>With this definite thought, his attack became even more aggressive.</p>

  <p>"The hell with you!"</p>

  <p>With a determined effort, Tyler brought down the blade, with all his strength.</p>

  <p>Instinctively, Zheng raised his sword to block the attack in front of him.</p>

  <p>By now, everyone's physical strength had weakened almost to the same level. Despite putting in his entire effort, he was no match for Tyler's attack.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>With a cracking sound, the long sword in Zheng's hand flew out.</p>

  <p>"Now is the time!"</p>

  <p>Although the other two exiles had pledged their lives, they remained unsuccessful in defeating Zheng. That was why, until now, they were getting extremely anxious.</p>

  <p>Tables changed for them, when unexpectedly, the sword in Zheng's hand was chopped away by Tyler with one swoop of the blade. As they witnessed the scene unravel before them, they quickly approached him with a delightful expression.</p>

  <p>Soon an axe and a sharp sword went sailing towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>With the saber in his hand, Tyler followed the two exiles, displaying a vicious smile. His plan was to cut off Zheng's head as soon as he was hit by the sword.</p>

  <p>Even though Zheng continued to dodge them at a remarkable speed, it was difficult to fight with bare hands.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Zheng had a faint smile while staring at Tyler, as he slowly raised one of his hands.</p>

  <p>"Death knocks at your door, but I applaud your courage to pretend to be strong," Tyler sneered.</p>

  <p>No one, including the exiles, could resist the power of the Strength Equalizing Theurgy. Tyler was puzzled with Zheng's sudden change in behavior.</p>

  <p>Just as the axe was about to chop Zheng's head, Zheng's palm suddenly glowed with a dazzling green light.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>The energy was buzzing with heightened power.</p>

  <p>A small green cube formed in the blink of an eye and quickly injected into Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>Now Zheng possessed a green right hand.</p>

  <p>He tried to grab the axe that was hurled at him.</p>

  <p>Even though it was merely an ordinary weapon, because of the Strength Equalizing Theurgy, whoever was hit by the axe would be immediately split into two. Moreover, the exile had put in all his efforts to slash Zheng with the axe.</p>

  <p>But Zheng suddenly twisted his right hand and easily grabbed the axe.</p>

  <p>The exile who held the other end of the axe was stunned. He grabbed the handle of the axe and tried to furiously pull it back. However, the axe hardly budged, as if it was embedded in a rock.</p>

  <p>"Whose turn is it to die now?"</p>

  <p>Zheng smirked as he slightly applied pressure on the axe.</p>

  <p>The axe was made of pure iron, but with Zheng's slight pressure, it completely lost its form.</p>

  <p>Tyler and the other exile with a sword were completely baffled at the ongoing scene.</p>

  <p>Although their senses had been weakened, they were on high alert. They knew that Zheng had used some kind of powerful energy to counterattack.</p>

  <p>Even the powerhouses at the Other Shore Realm had been subjected to the Strength Equalizing Theurgy. Then how could Zheng escape its power?</p>

  <p>For a moment, they thought that their eyes played some tricks.</p>

  <p>But soon they realized that what they witnessed was for real. In fact they could feel the strength emitting from Zheng's right hand.</p>

  <p>As the exile continued to be in a daze, Zheng grabbed the axe and hacked the exile furiously.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The handle of the axe, which had an arm's thickness, smashed into the exile. There was no way he could withstand such a force.</p>

  <p>Immediately his skull cracked open, as his brains oozed out. He simply collapsed and died on the spot.</p>

  <p>Since Zheng had chosen to use the theurgy, he decided to go on full throttle and mercilessly wipe out his opponents.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>He continued to violently wave the axe.</p>

  <p>The exile who held the sword came to his senses. As he turned to avoid the axe, he was whacked down with the axe handle. He faced a similar end as that of his team mate.</p>

  <p>Now, Tyler was the only one left.</p>

  <p>"How did you manage to do it? Does the Strength Equalizing Theurgy not work on you? How is that even remotely possible?" Tyler said in a trembling voice, but maintained calm composure on the outside.</p>

  <p>"Of course it has its effects on me," Zheng said as he gently kneaded the axe with his right hand. The axe that was made of fine iron was being shaped like a soft dough, transforming its shape under his constant kneading. "But I know of a way to dodge its effects."</p>

  <p>It was for this purpose that he had broken the rule made by the Chaos Ancient God.</p>

  <p>Tyler had no difficulty in believing Zheng. It was proof enough to watch Zheng's hand continue to glow.</p>

  <p>He gritted his teeth and mustering all his strength, threw his saber at Zheng and ran away.</p>

  <p>"Clang!"</p>

  <p>Zheng raised the handle of the axe and easily fended off the saber.</p>

  <p>Watching Tyler run away, he raised his right hand.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>As the huge axe was constantly waved, the air around crackled.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Zheng hurled the axe towards Tyler.</p>

  <p>Since he had already released the power of the Truth Crystal, there was no way he could spare Tyler.</p>

  <p>The axe sped up in the air and in the blink of an eye, caught up with Tyler.</p>

  <p>At the right moment, Tyler ducked his head and the axe flew over him.</p>

  <p>Tyler was relieved to escape from the axe. He had maintained a distance from Zheng, so that he could escape, if need be.</p>

  <p>But his relief was short lived as he instantly heard a howling sound.</p>

  <p>"Something is not right."</p>

  <p>A cold dread crept over him.</p>

  <p>The next moment he was stabbed by a thin flying knife. It resembled the wing of a cicada.</p>

  <p>Still at a distance, Zheng slowly put down his right hand and shook it slightly. He slowly walked towards Tyler, as the green light on the surface of his arm disappeared.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Timotheus and the others also got rid of the Wights.</p>

  <p>"Go help Zheng!"</p>

  <p>Timotheus hollered to the others. He sped up and rushed to the back of the high platforms.</p>

  <p>But when they arrived, they were stunned by what unfolded before them.</p>

  <p>Zheng was pulling out the flying knife from Tyler's back when he heard footsteps behind him. He faintly smiled as he heard their gasps.</p>

  <p>"That is Tyler! You killed all of them alone?" Leopold couldn't believe what he saw.</p>

  <p>They were all members of the large races and knew that it would not be easy to deal with Tyler, especially under the effect of the Strength Equalizing Theurgy.</p>

  <p>But Zheng defied all their beliefs, as he rushed over alone and killed the four exiles. This was definitely not what they had expected.</p>
