<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3758 The Holy Soul's Strength </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Back in Stage Four of the Other Shore, Zheng destroyed the Bearing race's temple all on his own.</p>

  <p>That time though, his physical body held a bit of an edge against everyone since his enemies were all Souls of Light that had limited strength to fight back.</p>

  <p>However, this was Stage Thirty of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Even the Other Shore creatures here held considerable power.</p>

  <p>Moreover, after upgrading to Holy Souls, these Souls of Light considerably increased their strength to the point that they could now contend with a physical body.</p>

  <p>Zheng's form on top of the ice wall immediately attracted a lot of attention.</p>

  <p>Nobody ever dared to act like this in the ice city! Zheng was asking for trouble.</p>

  <p>"Where did this reckless human brat come from?"</p>

  <p>Not far away was a platform where numerous burly creatures, covered in silver scales and with huge heads of golden hair, stood.</p>

  <p>They were members of the Scale Lion race which used to be the ruling civilization during the 337th chaos.</p>

  <p>This race had a good relationship with the Element Spirit Civilization and paid direct allegiance with them after entering the Other Shore. They were extremely loyal among all of the Other Shore civilizations.</p>

  <p>Their hostility towards Zheng was natural after the man made his invasion known.</p>

  <p>"Howl!"</p>

  <p>Accompanied by a burst of primitive roars, the members of the Scale Lion race suddenly jumped together and began to scale the ice wall, headed straight towards Zheng!</p>

  <p>One thing about the Scale Lion race was that they did not rely on their theurgy to fight and instead cultivated a special fighting instinct that helped them deal fatal blows upon their opponents. They were mean fighting machines who knew how to strike and defend effectively.</p>

  <p>If an opponent was on par to their strength, then the Scale Lion race would be invincible. However, if the opponent was stronger, the increase of the Scale Lion race's strength would be limited.</p>

  <p>Zheng's physical body was already at maximum power courtesy of the Body-strengthening Jades, and add to that the support of the Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>There was no need to take these approaching creatures seriously given his current strength. The only ones he had to watch out for were the Five-Element Slaves.</p>

  <p>The moment the first Scale Lion reached him, Zheng bent forward and threw a wicked punch towards his opponent's abdomen.</p>

  <p>Scale Lions, as their name suggested, were covered with extremely hard scales save for their bellies. Zheng's strike was incredibly powerful and was enough to break all his internal bones.</p>

  <p>One punch was all it took to eliminate the first opponent but the second one was already stretching out his sharp claws towards Zheng's head!</p>

  <p>Zheng was faster and he was able to strike first. Afterward, he clasped the sharp claws headed for him and spun violently.</p>

  <p>He used the Scale Lion as a weapon against his companions!</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang...</p>

  <p>Several Scale Lions failed to dodge and were directly smashed onto the ice wall. Zheng grabbed a few of them and threw them up to a height of hundreds of feet into the air before they fell down and crashed onto a nearby building.</p>

  <p>Zheng found himself looking into the distance. "The noise is nowhere near loud enough to attract attention," he mumbled to himself. He was here to mess things up, which meant the louder he was, the better.</p>

  <p>Just as he thought up of ways to make a bigger commotion, he heard a voice speak to him. "You are incredibly fearless, but it is time to stop..."</p>

  <p>The voice shocked Zheng greatly.</p>

  <p>He quickly whipped around to see a figure dash behind him. It was a human Soul of Light that held a huge ink brush. With unbelievable dexterity, he drew the brush and flicked a stroke towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng noticed that something was wrong, so he wanted to keep his distance from this person.</p>

  <p>This person was only a Soul of Light but his bodily movement was incredibly mysterious and amazing. He was like a maggot that kept following Zheng's moves.</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish...</p>

  <p>The second stroke of his brush landed directly on Zheng's chest!</p>

  <p>The third stroke...</p>

  <p>The fourth stroke...</p>

  <p>The fifth stroke...</p>

  <p>During this barrage of attacks, Zheng exhausted all means to dodge, counterattack, and even soar into the air. Unfortunately for him, the Soul of Light continued his pursuit and left behind many strokes on his body.</p>

  <p>"The stroke is incomparable, making the mountains and stars move. Seal!" the Soul of Light uttered, after suddenly drawing seven strokes on Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>It felt as if these brushstrokes came to life like snakes that coiled around Zheng's entire body and tightly wrapped around him.</p>

  <p>He felt his power within him sealed as he smashed onto the ice wall.</p>

  <p>With Zheng effectively restrained, the Soul of Light slowly approached with his ink brush propped on his shoulder.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng couldn't see his face clearly, he could see that the Soul of Light resembled an old man with a stooping body.</p>

  <p>This old man's name was Reed and he came from the Divine Farmer race.</p>

  <p>He was a high-ranking warrior at the Holy Soul Realm, and had been active in Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore for a long time now.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha, you're a daring one, aren't you? You successfully blocked the Sun Crow race's invasion and now even dared to enter the Blooming Hade Stage!" Reed said with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>As he spoke, Zheng couldn't help but shift his eyes to the large brush the old man carried.</p>

  <p>This ink brush was a unique magic treasure called the Dragon Sealing Brush.</p>

  <p>With Reed's soul theurgy, it had the ability to seal everything, even the powerful warriors on the Other Shore!</p>

  <p>There was no way Zheng would be able to attack, now that he was sealed. He could only lie on the ground and stare at the old man with indifference.</p>

  <p>He didn't expect for an old man who had reached the Holy Soul Realm to be his match.</p>

  <p>"Since you had the guts to break into the ice city, you're as good as dead.</p>

  <p>The Element Spirit race will be very happy if I hand you over to them,"</p>

  <p>Reed continued, stretching out a hand to lift Zheng up.</p>

  <p>However, the moment Zheng got to his feet, the strokes that restrained him suddenly broke free.</p>

  <p>Reed's eyes widened in horror as he immediately let go of Zheng and took a few steps back.</p>

  <p>"How is that possible!"</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>There was no time to ponder over that, as Zheng instantly threw him a punch square on the face.</p>

  <p>Though it had been a long time since he reached the Holy Soul Realm and the stability of his soul was comparable to that of a physical body, Reed still suffered greatly from the man's attack.</p>

  <p>As his soul was smashed into the air, he found it best to retreat from the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>Somewhere in the Source World was a palace and in this palace sat the old man, Reed. The moment he opened his eyes, he spat out a mouthful of blood and suddenly fainted!</p>

  <p>He did not know that in the eyes of the Primeval Lord of Heaven, his unique sealing theurgy was a mere party trick.</p>

  <p>When he sealed Zheng, the Primeval Lord of Heaven made quick work of negating the magic and reminded the man to launch a surprise attack once Reed approached.</p>

  <p>Zheng shook his head. "This Holy Soul really is so strong. This is indeed unexpected."</p>

  <p>He thought his punch would've been enough to smash Reed's Holy Soul to ashes, but the strength of the old man's soul exceeded his expectations.</p>
