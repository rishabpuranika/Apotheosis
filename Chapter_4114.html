<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The ten strongest Other Shore Tokens stored on the top of a holy pillar were referred to by the Snake Spirit Sect as the Holy Items.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King Cornelius had selected the ten items himself and strategically ordered them to be placed in this specific location for a very important reason.</p>

  <p>If someone was spying on him now through one of these items, it meant that they had climbed up the holy pillar.</p>

  <p>"My king, may I know what happened?" Sewell asked, trying to look and sound as respectful as he could be.</p>

  <p>He was the first one to come to the Snake Spirit King, and he did not want to try his patience.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King granted his request, filling him on what was happening to the holy pillar. When Sewell heard what the Snake Spirit King said, his neutral expression became somber.</p>

  <p>"We have left the main world for too long, my king. After the slaughter, many creatures might have been born there. I guess that some of them accidentally climbed up the holy pillar," Sewell said, his voice sounding worried.</p>

  <p>This only confirmed what the Snake Spirit King refused to hear. The main world was not empty. It was not dead.</p>

  <p>It was simply not prospering the way it did before.</p>

  <p>Long ago, the Snake Spirit Sect had sent the members of the Element Spirit Civilization into the main world to have them gather as much information about it as they could.</p>

  <p>From this mission, they discovered that there were already small races forming in the main world. Even worse, some of them were strong.</p>

  <p>In terms of size and strength, however, they were not much in comparison to the Four Spirits Sect, but this did not mean they were to be discarded.</p>

  <p>After all, a threat was a threat.</p>

  <p>"To think that those losers had the audacity to approach our holy pillar.</p>

  <p>When I come back to the main world, I will tear them into a thousand pieces," the Snake Spirit King said, each of his words laced with spite.</p>

  <p>The holy pillars were forbidden areas in the Four Spirits Sect.</p>

  <p>After all, people could see many things that they had no right to know through the holy pillars.</p>

  <p>Climbing up the four pillars without losing life would be next to impossible for anyone, but Geoffrey had tested his luck.</p>

  <p>Before the Snake Spirit King finished his sentence, Sewell's eyes narrowed, squinting to check if what he heard matched what he would see.</p>

  <p>Inside of Sewell's thick tail was a black spiral awl, which was given to him by the Snake Spirit King himself. The awl was a Holy Item too.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King responded to his reaction. "Did you detect something?" he asked, readying himself for the answer.</p>

  <p>Sewell switched his attention from the awl to his king, nodding his head in confirmation.</p>

  <p>"Show me," the Snake Spirit King ordered Sewell.</p>

  <p>Sewell bowed his head in submission, wagging his tail to release the awl from it. The spiral awl made its way around the location— from top to bottom, from left to right— before introducing itself to the face of the Snake Spirit King.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King looked at the spiral awl in front of him. Through it, he spoke to the intruder, his voice filled with anger. "This is the leader of the Snake Spirit Sect. Who are you? What are you doing on our holy pillar?"</p>

  <p>As he was speaking, his beady eyes began to turn golden, and a strong spell glowed around them.</p>

  <p>When his eyes would meet another's, the latter would immediately fall to his feet, completely submitting themselves to him. Even the most stubborn person could not stand a chance.</p>

  <p>Despite being in a different world, the Snake Spirit King remained confident in his powers. It had never failed him before. With just one look, he knew he would be able to make the intruder fear.</p>

  <p>However, just as the Snake Spirit King's eyes lit up, the intruder's gaze in the spiral awl disappeared.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King narrowed his eyes. "The intruder is quick to react," he remarked while his eyes began to darken, losing their glow.</p>

  <p>"Such a pity, my king," Sewell said in response, genuinely disappointed in what just passed.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King rolled his eyes in vexation. Right after, he summoned the Other Shore Tokens from many places in the Heavenly Square City, and they moved in circles above his head.</p>

  <p>As long as the intruder touched a ray of the dark light again, he would cast the spell through his eyes immediately. Then, the intruder's mind would swell up in confusion, forgetting what he was there for in the first place.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King waited and waited. However, moments passed, and there was still no negative reaction from the Holy Items. The intruder was not doing anything.</p>

  <p>"What a cunning lad," he commented, his patience nearing its end. He returned the Holy Items to their original places. He addressed his attention to Sewell and asked, "What do you think that intruder is there for? Do you think he or she is here to break the connection between the Holy Items and the holy pillar?"</p>

  <p>Sewell shook his head. "From what I know, no matter how hard a person tries, the connection between the Holy Items and the holy pillar would be impossible to break off."</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately, that's not true," the Snake Spirit King interjected.</p>

  <p>"Although the connection between the items and the holy pillar is supposedly unbreakable, if a person has enough time and the correct resources, he or she would be able to cut it all off," he continued, revealing a fit of growing anger in his expression. "After all, the Deep Space favors no one."</p>

  <p>"The Deep Space favors no one"— this was something the Human Spirit King Kincaid would always remind him. The Deep Space was never purposely on anyone's side.</p>

  <p>The Deep Space meant a great lot to the main world. Both Sheehan and Kincaid believed it to be the origin of all that existed.</p>

  <p>However, despite the supposed greatness of the Deep Space, it was also mysterious and unpredictable, therefore making it dangerous. No one knew what to expect from it, not even the Four Spirits Sect did when it was at its peak!</p>

  <p>Most members of the Four Spirits Sect believed the reason why they would rule the main world was because it was a blessing from the Deep Space back then. But Kincaid had a different opinion.</p>
