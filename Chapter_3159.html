<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Dorothy and the purple Soul of Light were stunned at the firmness in Luo Zheng's tone.</p>

  <p>"The Other Shore Token of the strengthening type can increase your power, but power doesn't mean everything," Dorothy said, trying to persuade Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"I know," Luo Zheng said, nodding.</p>

  <p>"Are you still going to choose this Other Shore Token then?" the purple Soul of Light asked again.</p>

  <p>He didn't care what Other Shore Token Luo Zheng would select. All he cared about was being nice to Dorothy.</p>

  <p>"Yes. I'll still choose this one," Luo Zheng replied decisively.</p>

  <p>He then picked up the Strength God Totem off the Earth Sanskrit Plate.</p>

  <p>Dorothy knew that once Luo Zheng decided to do something, nobody could persuade him to change his mind. And moreover, now that the Other Shore Token of the strengthening type was a trend among warriors, this Other Shore Token wasn't going to be weak.</p>

  <p>"Okay, it's my turn to choose," Dorothy said with a smile. She bent down over the Earth Sanskrit Plate in search of an Other Shore Token she wanted.</p>

  <p>She had already laid eyes on an Other Shore Token that was sitting on the right side of the twelfth circle. This token was the Twin Blossoms and it contained force of 150 Jun. It was an Other Shore Token of the auxiliary type and had a special power? it could help the user clone themselves.</p>

  <p>The Origin Swordsmanship that she had cultivated was extremely powerful and she had had to work with another warrior to bring out one of its theurgies. If she could work with her other self, she could launch this token to a greater effect, given that there would be a better connection between them. It was obvious that the Twin Blossoms was the best choice for her.</p>

  <p>"I'll take this Other Shore Token," Dorothy said as she reached out to pick up the blossoms.</p>

  <p>She hadn't yet passed the test of the Earth Sanskrit Plate, but she was confident that she could bear it, so she was now daring to take the Other Shore Token of Stage Twelve, which was why the purple Soul of Light remained silent.</p>

  <p>Once Dorothy and Luo Zheng obtained their own Other Shore Tokens, the next step they needed to take was to infuse the tokens into their souls and hold them in their own bodies. But before they could do this, two people suddenly walked in through the Seclusion Door.</p>

  <p>One of them had been waiting inside the Seclusion Door like the others.</p>

  <p>When Dorothy had revealed the Necklace of Mystic Soul, he had looked at it for a few seconds before leaving quietly.</p>

  <p>The Soul of Light behind him glowed with a faint purple light. It was clear that his soul could reach Stage Thirteen.</p>

  <p>Dorothy and Luo Zheng had just been about to leave when the two men blocked their way.</p>

  <p>"Dorothy! You have finally reached Stage Four!" the purple Soul of Light said.</p>

  <p>Dorothy frowned at this voice but didn't say anything. Hatred, however, radiated from her Soul of Light.</p>

  <p>"Now that you have reached Stage Four, you should have come to the Vastness Mountain to inform me of this progress. I found an extremely powerful Other Shore Token in the Ethereal Light Stage. It is very suitable for you!" the purple Soul of Light said.</p>

  <p>"No, thanks," Dorothy said coldly. "I can't afford to owe your Vastness Mountain a favor."</p>

  <p>The purple Soul of Light chuckled, and added, "It's just an Other Shore Token of the Lust World. How can you call it a favor? It's my gift to you."</p>

  <p>"Doesn't your Vastness Mountain always threaten my grandmother with that favor from years ago? You are not to be trusted!" Dorothy snapped and grabbed Luo Zheng's arm, intending to leave.</p>

  <p>The purple Soul of Light finally noticed Luo Zheng. He stretched out his arms to stop them, his strong soul pressure surging out of him.</p>

  <p>Fighting on the Other Shore meant confrontation on a spiritual level.</p>

  <p>This man's purple Soul of Light sat at the peak in the Lust World and was far stronger than Luo Zheng's. Luo Zheng was shocked when his soul pressure had burst out. He reacted quickly, but he wasn't fast enough. The pressure pressed him tight against a wall of the temple.</p>

  <p>"Who do you think you are?! How dare you hold Dorothy's hand!" the purple Soul of Light screamed, ruthless in his countenance. His aura intimidated everyone standing inside the Seclusion Door.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's Soul of Light could hardly move, given that he was tightly held against the wall.</p>

  <p>He had absorbed soul crystal twice on the Other Shore, but with his current soul cultivation base, he could barely enter Stage Six.</p>

  <p>This was why he couldn't defeat someone from Stage Thirteen.</p>

  <p>Even so, Luo Zheng mustered his soul force in a bid to try and escape the pressure.</p>

  <p>"Marco Xu! Stop it!" Dorothy berated him, irritated at what he was doing to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Marco Xu laughed and said, "Dorothy, is this kind of an insignificant guy really worth your plea? I think I should just kill him."</p>

  <p>The expressions on the faces of the three purple Souls of Light, who were in charge of affairs within the Seclusion Door, shifted at Marco Xu's words.</p>

  <p>They already knew who he was. Marco Xu, the young master of the Vastness Mountain, with a background on par with Dorothy's. They could not afford to offend him.</p>

  <p>But trying to unreasonably launch an attack in the Seclusion Door was taking it too far. After all, everyone in the temple was a disciple of the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's expression shifted into one of pure coldness when he heard this man reveal his intention of killing him.</p>

  <p>It was true that people in the Dragon City often killed others. But ever since he had joined the Heart Flow Sect, he was on good terms with everyone else. And because of this, Luo Zheng hadn't expected to meet such a person ever again.</p>

  <p>It was at this moment that Luo Zheng heard a calm, casual voice sound from the depths of his mind. "Want me to help you?"</p>

  <p>It was No. 9527.</p>

  <p>No. 9527's soul power wasn't too strong, but as part of the Chaos Ancient God's soul, it had a much better understanding of soul than ordinary people had. No. 9527 couldn't fight people like Qiu Yinhe, but it could easily deal with a Soul of Light in the Lust World.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did not speak. There were too many people here and he did not want to expose No. 9527 unless he had no other choice.</p>

  <p>The soul pressure was like an invisible hand, exerting more and more strength on Luo Zheng's Soul of Light.</p>

  <p>"Stop! Or I will have to kill you!"</p>

  <p>Dorothy threatened, her voice cold and determined. The Necklace of Mystic Soul against her chest suddenly erupted with a powerful soul pressure.</p>

  <p>A small soul sword appeared over Dorothy's head.</p>

  <p>It was not the first time that Luo Zheng had seen the sword. But it had never been so solid, and the purple light emanating from the surface of the soul sword was flowing everywhere.</p>

  <p>Marco Xu's eyes widened as he felt the pressure of the soul sword. There was no more doubt that Dorothy would kill him with this sword.</p>

  <p>Sensing that things were getting out of hand, the three purple Souls of Light who were in charge of the place rushed over to them.</p>

  <p>"You're all from the Taiyi Heaven Palace! Don't fight over a trifle!"</p>

  <p>"For God's sake, Marco, please forget it!"</p>

  <p>"How about meeting each other halfway?"</p>

  <p>Marco Xu was already regretting his actions at Dorothy's threat. He had never imagined that she would protect this brat, someone who had appeared out of nowhere it felt like.</p>

  <p>Marco Xu backtracked under the persuasion of the three Souls of Light, finding an opportunity to make right the awkward position he had put himself in. He smiled as he said, "You are right. I don't need to fight with a nobody."</p>

  <p>He then gathered all the pressure he had just released back into his body.</p>

  <p>But the small soul sword that was hovering over Dorothy's head shot suddenly towards him.</p>
