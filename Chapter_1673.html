  <p>
</p>

  <p>At this point, Tianming took a single step to the side.</p>

  <p>Obviously, Tianming could not turn himself into lightning, so he could not move as fast as Xenia on the Heaven Earth Board like lightning.</p>

  <p>While this might be true, he did not need to move like that.</p>

  <p>He merely needed to take one step.</p>

  <p>And that particular step was remarkably known as the Flashing Step!</p>

  <p>"I'm standing on the light and walking in the Flashing Step!"</p>

  <p>As he giddily chanted, the speed of his step had already surpassed the speed of the lightning.</p>

  <p>By utilizing this single step alone, he successfully dodged Xenia's attack in a matter of just a split second!</p>

  <p>The two of them swiftly passed by each other, seemingly without a pause. If the time could freeze right now, people would not only see Xenia's stunned expression, but they would also discern that her finger was only a step away from Tianming. But since the speed of the Purple Lightning Body had reached its limit, even it was Xenia, she couldn't change her direction in time. Because her thought could not catch up with her lightning speed, she could only move straightly and was unable to turn quickly.</p>

  <p>Consequently, Tianming could deduce Xenia's position ahead of time. He surmised she would definitely move in a straight line.</p>

  <p>And if he was not fast enough to strike, it would be all in vain.</p>

  <p>Because in a split second, Xenia would not limit herself to turn and dodge in another direction.</p>

  <p>Luckily, Tianming's sword strike was also faster than lightning.</p>

  <p>"Flashing Strike!"</p>

  <p>In the entire universe, there were only a few people who were able to distinguish clearly Tianming's counterattack.</p>

  <p>Most of them merely caught a flash, while some could not differentiate distinctly whether that flash was a sword light or something else.</p>

  <p>Unbeknown to all spectators, a Supreme Lord who hid hundreds of thousands of feet underground raised his eyebrows in awe as he observed the scene.</p>

  <p>This Supreme Lord was Supreme Lord Leroy. He was the Supreme Lord of the Demon Night, who owned a pair of sharp eyes like an eagle and ears that perched up a little too high, making them look quite animated.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Leroy's power could not enter the top ten among all the Supreme Lords, but his visual perception could land him in the top three rankings.</p>

  <p>"What a quick strike!"</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Leroy couldn't stop himself hollering with an amused look at his face.</p>

  <p>This sword strike was like a flash of light.</p>

  <p>It happened in the wink of an eye. As the light sparked, he timely executed the strike. And long before the light faded away, he had put back the sword into its sheath.</p>

  <p>And within three seconds, everyone heard the crisp sound of a sword sliding into its iron sheath.</p>

  <p>They all fixed their gaze at Tianming, who did pull his sword out a few seconds ago.</p>

  <p>He made a quick strike after pulling it out, making it harder for most people to discern those movements as well as to describe the outward design of his sword.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Xenia stood frozen and looked dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>There was no wound visible on her body. She felt something was amiss.</p>

  <p>Xenia's body was not in the form of flesh and blood after turning into lightning, so she should not be wounded, and there must be no bleeding as well.</p>

  <p>But who would have thought that a two-inch-wide gap would appear on her chest?</p>

  <p>All regular swords and even dozens of arrows could never hurt her because she could always fully recover in a short time. It was as if her body possessed magical healing power.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Tianming's sword was not an ordinary one.</p>

  <p>This sword strike contained a strange internal momentum, that seemed to have no power, but it could suppress Xenia's internal momentum within.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>Lightning continually burst out of that gap, exploding and emitting dazzling purple light.</p>

  <p>To some spectators, it was a beautiful scene to behold, but as for Xenia, that was a deadly wound!</p>

  <p>"This strike won't make you die," Tianming said indifferently. "But it can rapidly consume your thunder internal momentum. You have activated this Purple Lightning Body for too long, so your life vitality is already consumed a lot. You will soon be unable to maintain the Purple Lightning Body after being wounded by my sword."</p>

  <p>Tianming shook his head regretfully and went on, "You shouldn't have forced me to pull out my sword."</p>

  <p>Hearing Tianming's gentle words, Xenia looked at her wound. She soon realized that she was going to be eliminated, but she did not look depressed at all.</p>

  <p>Xenia had never feared anything in this universe.</p>

  <p>Her mind was reeling with different thoughts. She shouldn't have been born in this world as she had no desire for this kind of world. If she could, she would not even join the incoming world of chaos.</p>

  <p>She wholeheartedly accepted the result that this time she lost the battle.</p>

  <p>Tianming did not launch another strike.</p>

  <p>And Xenia did not attack him either.</p>

  <p>Instead, she let the lightning on her fingers begin to dissipate slowly, turning both her hands back to their original state, looking soft and fair.</p>

  <p>Then her right arm, shoulders, and her entire body, all, at last, were transformed back from the Purple Lightning Body.</p>

  <p>But the wound on her chest remained, and golden blood was oozing out of it.</p>

  <p>They said that one must change his blood if he joined the Celestial Position.</p>

  <p>Xenia was still at a young age when she joined the Celestial Position. So she was so young then when her blood was changed into the golden blood.</p>

  <p>Moments passed by, Xenia's face now turned paler and paler as more and more golden blood spouted out of her wound. But she was still smiling, saying, "You are truly powerful. But I might win over you if I were more careful just now. I have another powerful skill, but I can no longer use it now. What a pity..." Though she said that it was a pity, she did not look disappointed. She did not care a lot that she would be eliminated.</p>

  <p>"The Purple Lightning Body is not the strongest skill in the Thunderstorm Divine Dao, but the confusing thunder," Tianming stated as if he was helping Xenia explain. "Only the confusing thunder can release the ultimate internal momentum, but, it is still unable to hurt me."</p>

  <p>Xenia darted a fierce look at him when hearing what Tianming said.</p>

  <p>'What a bad guy. He already defeated me, but he is still hurting me.'</p>

  <p>But she soon let it go.</p>

  <p>She remembered that there were many arrogant guys in the Celestial Position race.</p>

  <p>Karl was the most arrogant one in the young generation.</p>

  <p>Xenia despised his arrogance the most. They did not speak to each other when they met the first time. They even glared at each other.</p>

  <p>Though Tianming also exuded arrogance, she found it not annoying. On the contrary, his handsome and thin face was pleasing to her eyes.</p>

  <p>She did not usually fall for someone who looked so pleasing around the universe.</p>

  <p>Xenia lost this battle.</p>

  <p>The entire universe was in an uproar.</p>

  <p>These three hundred warriors were numerous gamblers' subjects.</p>

  <p>Everyone had his own odds.</p>

  <p>The odds represented everyone's speculation of these warriors' power.</p>

  <p>The lower the odds were, the stronger the warrior would be.</p>

  <p>Among these three hundred warriors, Nathan had the lowest odds. He ranked top one in those gamblers' hearts as the potential winner.</p>

  <p>The second one was Lawson.</p>

  <p>Then following were Kurt from the Blessed Buddha Land, Karl, and so on.</p>

  <p>Xenia's odds were almost the same as that of Karl. The warriors with the lowest odds were all Godly Geniuses.</p>

  <p>Surprisingly, Tianming's odds were ranked around the two hundred sixtieth place.</p>

  <p>He strategically did not show his power before, and his ranking was not high in the Illusion Battlefield, so consequently, people underestimated him.</p>

  <p>Before Tianming fought Xenia, ninety-nine percent of warriors thought he would surely lose within just a second. For them, he was just an unknown warrior.</p>

  <p>Some bankers even set up a gamble on how many moves Xenia would use to kill Tianming.</p>

  <p>No one had expected that the battle would end like this.</p>

  <p>This battle made so many gamblers lose a large sum of money. Tianming was such a dark horse. Those gamblers who lost everything all angrily cursed Tianming.</p>

  <p>On the Heaven Earth Board, the white stones had tried so hard to make a "big dragon", but now it was damaged and broke by the black stones.</p>

  <p>The 'variable ones' on the board got the upper hand, and the white stones which had an advantage over the black ones were now at a disadvantage.</p>

  <p>Until this moment did Tianming slowly walk towards his own stone. He then smiled at Luo Luo Zheng in the midair. There was expectation in his eyes.</p>

  <p>As everyone was sensitive about his movements, they looked along with Tianming's eyes and saw Luo Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>They suddenly remembered that Tianming had said before that his sword was not prepared for Xenia.</p>

  <p>Seeing the provoking look on Tianming's face, they realized what he meant.</p>

  <p>Was he looking at Luo Luo Zheng?</p>

  <p>They did not know that since Tianming had entered the Central Region, his target was always Luo Luo Zheng. He never changed his target.</p>

  <p>There was a period of time when the harder he chased Luo Luo Zheng, the bigger the gap between them became.</p>

  <p>But Tianming never revealed negative emotions, and he never had the thought to give up. He just cultivated quietly and tried his best to catch up with Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Today, he was finally qualified to stand on the battlefield. He would naturally expect a battle between him and Luo Luo Zheng.</p>
