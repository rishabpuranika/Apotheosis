<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Tower of Sin had not been peaceful this year.</p>

  <p>Many creatures in the Tower of Sin were discussing what to do. Some of the more timid creatures had already followed the human warriors out of the tower and entered the Cursed Land. If something bad happened, they didn't want to be caught in the middle of it.</p>

  <p>Inside the Dark Nether Cave, Luo Zheng and his group were moving forward with an orange protective shield around them.</p>

  <p>As soon as they left the Mad Scorpion's body, Yolande activated the pendant hanging on Zheng's chest and pushed Malcom and Rehaan out of the protective shield.</p>

  <p>The moment the two ogres found themselves pushed out of the protective shield, they released their forceful energy to protect themselves against the Dark Nether Death Light. But the forceful energy lasted for less than three seconds before it disappeared. At such a close distance, even a warrior at the Soul Sea Realm wouldn't be able to resist the Dark Nether Death Light that was being released from the Mad Scorpion's head. There was no way the two war sages could survive.</p>

  <p>Looking at Zheng's shocked expression, Yolande asked indifferently, "When were you planning to get rid of them?"</p>

  <p>"I wanted to know where they had been hiding first," Luo Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>"Malcom wouldn't give you the chance. He would attack you the moment we leave the Fog Array. If he had managed to get your pendant, we would have been the ones to die."</p>

  <p>For once, Xun agreed with Yolande's words.</p>

  <p>Compared to Yolande and Xun, Luo Zheng wasn't experienced enough in dealing with these kinds of things. Or in other words, he wasn't ruthless enough. Yolande and Xun had much more experience when it came to these kinds of dangerous situations. When a group of warriors was exploring a place, only the most cold-hearted one would be able to survive and take all the treasures. The others would all be killed.</p>

  <p>By the time they left the Mad Scorpion's body, the fog in the core area had already started to dissipate.</p>

  <p>"The fog is starting to dissipate!" Seeing that the fog had become extremely thin, Luo Zheng furrowed his brows in confusion.</p>

  <p>Yolande blinked her eyes. "It should be because of the time flow rate. The time flow rate inside the Mad Scorpion's body is many times faster than that of our world. We might have been inside the Mad Scorpion's body for only a few days, but a much longer time has passed outside."</p>

  <p>"Holy crap! So the Dark Nether Cave is closed now? That means that the humans in the Tower of Sin must be in a really bad situation now!" Zheng's face was gloomy. Esther looked worried too.</p>

  <p>If the ogres thought that Luo Zheng and the others were dead, it was very likely that they would have come back to the Tower of Sin. The members of the Demon Night might not be in that much trouble, but the humans would be in great danger.</p>

  <p>"Let's hurry back to the Tower of Sin!" Luo Zheng said, picking up his pace.</p>

  <p>It wasn't until they entered the thin fog that Luo Zheng noticed the extremely thin golden lines pulsing on the ground.</p>

  <p>"The previous Fog Array was formed by these golden lines." As Yolande spoke, she reached out a finger and injected her life vitality into the array plate on her hand, making it spin.</p>

  <p>As the array plate rotated, the golden lines started to change direction and break apart one by one. After the Fog Array lost its effect, everyone began to move toward the exit.</p>

  <p>Normally, once the Dark Nether Death Light became more intense, all the warriors would return to the Tower of Sin. However, Luo Zheng and the others had been moving forward under the full illumination of the Dark Nether Death Light for such a long time. This was something that no one else had even dared to attempt before.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the monsters in the Dark Nether Cave weren't able to block out the Dark Nether Death Light. Whenever there was a lot of Dark Nether Death Light, the monsters' activities were not that frequent. Luo Zheng and the group didn't encounter any monsters on their way from the core area to the inner area.</p>

  <p>Even when they passed through the Bloody Pass, the Swallowing Birds and Azure Wolves on both sides of the Bloody Pass were hiding in their nests.</p>

  <p>They didn't come out even though they could sense prey.</p>

  <p>"From the looks of it, the monsters inside the Dark Nether Cave also move only when the Dark Nether Death Light greatly weakens," Esther said while blinking her eyes.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded. "Indeed!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly, an exciting thought struck Esther.</p>

  <p>Along the way, she had already understood that the most important thing in the Dark Nether Cave was not the belongings of the world lords, but the Heavenly Fragment. The other items weren't even worth mentioning in the same sentence as the Heavenly Fragment.</p>

  <p>But for most of the warriors on the Sea God Continent, the Heavenly Fragment was actually unimportant. It belonged to the Upper World and had nothing to do with the Lower World. Only a few of them would be lucky enough to go to the Upper World. Furthermore, none of the warriors at the Soul Sea Realm on the Sea God Continent had been able to go to the Upper World. They could only watch as their lifespan approached its end until they died in the sacred places.</p>

  <p>So in their eyes, the most important thing in the Dark Nether Cave was still the various treasures.</p>

  <p>Now that Luo Zheng had the pendant that could be used to resist the Dark Nether Death Light as well as the array plate that could be used to control the Fog Array, he would be able to freely enter and exit the Dark Nether Cave in the future. Besides, when the Dark Nether Death Light was not blocked by the fog, all the monsters in the Dark Nether Cave were also hiding in their nests. This meant that Luo Zheng could visit the Dark Nether Cave without having to face much danger.</p>

  <p>In addition, with the protection shield of the pendant, he could even cultivate in the depths of the Dark Nether Cave and make a breakthrough to become a war sage.</p>

  <p>The pendant hanging on Zheng's chest only required a small amount of life vitality to operate. As long as he had enough life vitality crystals, he could cultivate in the Dark Nether Cave for as long as he wanted to.</p>

  <p>Of course, Fabian and the others were also thinking the same thing. This could prove to be a huge advantage for both the Demon Night and the human race.</p>

  <p>Previously, Luo Zheng had said that he might choose to leave the Tower of Sin and the Sea God Continent. The warriors of the Purple Heart Sacred Place had been worried about this because once Luo Zheng was gone, the human race would lose control of the Tower of Sin again.</p>

  <p>Even if Luo Zheng chose to leave quietly, the other creatures would find out one day. If he was missing from the Tower of Sin for a long time, the ogres would definitely try to take control of the tower again.</p>

  <p>But now, with the two treasures that Luo Zheng had, a few of the humans could cultivate to become war sages and hide in the Dark Nether Cave. Then, the human race would also be able to take firm control of the Tower of Sin without facing any problems.</p>

  <p>Fabian and Jarrod were thinking a step ahead of Esther. If Luo Zheng left these two treasures behind, then the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place would maintain an alliance with the Purple Heart Sacred Place even after he left because of the treasures.</p>

  <p>Seeing the fiery expressions on all their faces, Luo Zheng immediately knew what they were thinking about. With a slight smile, he said, "Don't worry. If I leave the Sea God Continent, I will give these two treasures to Fabian for safekeeping. The humans will share them with the Demon Night."</p>

  <p>When Fabian, Jarrod, and Esther heard Zheng's words, their faces instantly lit up with joy. The value of this promise of Zheng's was too great.</p>

  <p>Without the obstruction of the monsters, the group was able to return to the Tower of Sin very quickly. Soon, they arrived at the bottom of the tower.</p>

  <p>They all used their life vitality and stayed close to Luo Zheng as they flew upward.</p>

  <p>But when they arrived at the top of the Tower of Sin, their faces fell. "The exit is closed," Esther said, taking a glance at the door.</p>

  <p>This door was the exit of the Tower of Sin. Every time the Dark Nether Death Light filled the entire Dark Nether Cave, the seat owners inside the Tower of Sin would close the door, with very few exceptions.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng moved forward and pounded on the door with his fist.</p>

  <p>Bang, bang, bang...</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Maurice, who was standing on the top floor of the tower, had just killed two human top-level war lords. The remaining human top-level war lords and the top-level war lords of the ogres were preparing to fight.</p>

  <p>At this moment, they all heard the sound of someone knocking on the door, leaving them stunned.</p>

  <p>How could there be someone knocking on the door after the Dark Nether Death Light had become intense?</p>

  <p>One of the top-level war lords of the human race shouted in joy, "Open the door! It must be Fabian and the others. No, it must be Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>Another top-level war lord of the human race tried to rush up the stairs to open the door. But before he could climb the stairs, Maurice's fist smashed into his shoulder, sending him flying backward. The man spat out a mouthful of blood before losing consciousness because of his internal injuries.</p>

  <p>The top-level war lords of the ogres began to look troubled, and a trace of fear rose from the bottom of their hearts. Could it really be that brat again?</p>
