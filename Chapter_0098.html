  <p>
</p>

  <p>Martin teetered on the brink of death, feeling like he would collapse at any second. As he watched the retreating form of the queen blade locust, his chest heaved as profoundly, out of breath after his run. He never thought Luo Luo Zheng would lead the queen blade locust away just in time to save his life!</p>

  <p>The whistling wind rushed past his ears, and the woods fell away behind Luo Luo Zheng on either side as Luo Luo Zheng ran. Luo Luo Zheng didn't choose any specific way because he had no idea where he was anyway!</p>

  <p>Aside from running onward with all his effort, he hadn't had time to think of a plan.</p>

  <p>The queen blade locust was chasing after him at a crazy speed. Although she had only one blade left, for Luo Luo Zheng, she was still an invincible being.</p>

  <p>"Scri-itch!" came the sound as a shadow of red flashed through the trees in the spot where Luo Luo Zheng was a moment ago, leaving a ten feet long scar in the ground.</p>

  <p>The queen was obviously much faster than Luo Luo Zheng. In seconds she would overtake?Luo Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>"What now?" questioned Luo Luo Zheng looking around frantically as his heart gradually sank.</p>

  <p>Faced with such a powerful opponent, he didn't hold out for the fight to go his way.</p>

  <p>"Scra-atch!" came the ominous sound as the red shadow fell again, and at the same time the wind whizzed past. Luo Luo Zheng surged up, avoiding the attack and rolled forward out of reach.</p>

  <p>Colliding into shrubs and bramble as he made his way through the jungle, Luo Luo Zheng saw a canyon come into view ahead. He looked?around and noted that the canyon was?about seventy or eighty feet?wide.</p>

  <p>'I'll have to jump the gorge!' decided Luo Luo Zheng quickly in mind.</p>

  <p>Racing to the edge of the canyon, Luo Luo Zheng clenched his teeth, directed the strength of his entire body to the feet while pulling himself into the shape of a curved bow, and flexed as he launched.</p>

  <p>With the power of his kick off, he thrust himself across the canyon.</p>

  <p>Midair, halfway across, the queen blade locust jumped after him, as she spread her wings. She flew at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Son of a bitch! The queen blade locust can fly?" yelled Luo Luo Zheng into the empty sky, depressed.</p>

  <p>In reality, the queen blade locust's body was too large, and she couldn't fly. The wings weren't strong enough to carry her up into the sky.</p>

  <p>But, using her strong hind limbs to propel upward, she could use her wings to glide on the air for short periods.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, the queen with her remaining red blade outstretched was gaining on Luo Luo Zheng, quickly.</p>

  <p>"What am I going to do? This will kill me..."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng couldn't stop his mind from turning to thoughts of death as he soared through the air. He couldn't dodge the red blade this time and watched as the tremendous red blade bit down on him.</p>

  <p>At this crucial moment, a desperate desire rose in Luo Zheng's heart to survive.</p>

  <p>"No! I can't die now! There's still so much left for me to do!" spat Luo Luo Zheng suddenly, his eyes bloodshot red.</p>

  <p>Faced with impending doom, Luo Luo Zheng pressed his knife against his arm. And as he did, he raised it to block the queen blade locust's blade.</p>

  <p>"Kla-ash!"</p>

  <p>The violent force connected with the broken knife but didn't break it.</p>

  <p>Sure enough, the toughness of the knife could handle blocking the attack of the queen blade locust's blade.</p>

  <p>"Oa-ff!" gasped Luo Luo Zheng as the wind was knocked out of him from the force of the blade clashing into the dagger. Spitting, Luo Luo Zheng sent a large mouthful of blood?splattering through the air.</p>

  <p>He felt the veins on his forehead throb, and his blood coursing through his body as if his organs were?shattered.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Luo Zheng's corporeal form was unique. If anyone else had taken such a fierce strike directly, like Luo Luo Zheng had, whether they were a master at the marrow?refining level or at the nature level, they would be dead.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng transformed most of the power he absorbed from this energy into a warm current, that continually penetrated his bones and rinsed his marrow.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the rest of the power from the blow injured him greatly as it was too much for him to bear.</p>

  <p>With the help of energy he could use, Luo Luo Zheng flew higher, gliding hundreds of feet above the ground until he was across the deep chasm. Falling fast, he landed on the soft ground below.</p>

  <p>"Thu-ud!"</p>

  <p>The ground shook from the shock of his impact. The queen blade locust landed on the ground seconds after Luo Luo Zheng and sped at him.</p>

  <p>Lying on the ground, Luo Luo Zheng felt as though his body had been ripped to shreds. He didn't want to move. However, when he saw the queen locust rushing closer, he spat bloody saliva and swore while he forced himself up enduring the pain from his fall, and darted in the direction away from the queen.</p>

  <p>Being chased for another thousand feet, Luo Luo Zheng came to the mouth of a large cave.</p>

  <p>He turned and looked at the jungle, spreading endlessly. When he sprinted away, he'd expected to find a place to duck into. But, there was no place to hide from the queen blade locust.</p>

  <p>Without thinking, Luo Luo Zheng could only seek refuge in the cave.</p>

  <p>For humans, caves were far more dangerous inside than the outside.</p>

  <p>Especially caves out in the wild, who knew what powerful creatures called the caves home?</p>

  <p>But, Luo Luo Zheng had no choice at the moment. It was futile to continue running.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng could only hope there would be a chance for him to survive somehow in the cave.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng got into the cave, the queen blade locust saw and followed close behind him without any hesitation. Hellbent on killing Luo Luo Zheng, she just wouldn't give up.</p>

  <p>It was such a spacious cave that even the large queen blade locust was able to walk freely inside. Fortunately, the cave also curved along, so that, although she was faster outside, inside the cave, Luo Luo Zheng was quicker.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the distance between them wasn't shortened.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng went deeper and deeper into the cave, the thick smell of sulfur penetrated his nose. What was below this cave?</p>
