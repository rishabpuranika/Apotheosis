  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Sword Clan had occupied the Sunrest Tree but they didn't know the existence of the skeleton.</p>

  <p>It would take them a long time to explore the Sunrest Tree to find the skeleton at the bottom.</p>

  <p>Who knew how long it would take? Maybe ten or ten thousand divine eras or maybe they would never find it!</p>

  <p>The True Gods and Holy Beings had ridden themselves of the shackles of time and become eternal creatures, but if the divine land was destroyed, all eternal beings would probably vanish in an instant!</p>

  <p>A giant, intimidating worm suddenly emerged from the Sunrest Tree and was killed by the Holy Beings. It was very puzzling.</p>

  <p>But by decoding the Sanskrit words, Mike and Holy Jay soon unraveled the mystery.</p>

  <p>The giant worm was designed to allow the Sword Clan, living on the Sunrest Tree, to discover the existence of the skeleton.</p>

  <p>When they figured out the intention of the skeleton, they learned that the inheritor whom the skeleton was looking for could only be a True God.</p>

  <p>Moreover, this True God must have an extraordinary ability to comprehend the Truth of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>However, the races in the divine land did not understand the Truth of Godly Way too well.</p>

  <p>The Sword Clan thought it about long and hard before they began to hold debates over the Godly Ways.</p>

  <p>They had to find a way to test the True Gods' comprehension of the Truth of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>The only way for them to test the sagacious perception of the True Gods was by using the Truth Spiritual Swords. This test was actually a last-ditch attempt.</p>

  <p>"It's a pity that the Sword Clan has wasted so much time." Harold's tone was slightly accusatory.</p>

  <p>After all, a divine era lasted quite long.</p>

  <p>Although the Sword Clan claimed to hold the debates over the Godly Ways over the divine eras, they had selfish motives for the inheritance of the skeleton.</p>

  <p>They didn't want an outsider to obtain the inheritance of the skeleton.</p>

  <p>However, the members of the Sword Clan had tried their luck countless times. None of their True Gods was qualified to obtain the inheritance of the skeleton.</p>

  <p>The members of the Sword Clan still did what they wanted until the last debate.</p>

  <p>On the surface of it, all of the True Gods in the divine lands could participate in the debate over the Godly Ways, and the Sword Clan welcomed all sorts of talents from various powerful clans.</p>

  <p>But the fact of the matter was that they were hostile to the candidates.</p>

  <p>They felt that if they couldn't get the inheritance of the skeleton, then no one else should either!</p>

  <p>Until now, Harold had helped them understand the importance of the inheritance.</p>

  <p>If it went on like this, everyone was sure to be doomed.</p>

  <p>Sensing Harold's reproach, Marsh shot a wry smile and said, "As a Holy Being of the Sword Clan, I am naturally concerned about the interests of my clan. How can I let such a valuable inheritance fall into the hands of an outsider?"</p>

  <p>However, Harold was unmoved by his words. "From the perspective of chaos, we are all sailing on the same ship," he remarked dryly.</p>

  <p>"So this time, we will go all out to help Mike's daughter get the inheritance," proclaimed Marsh with a smile. He prided himself on being a veteran, but, as a Holy Being, he was short-sighted.</p>

  <p>Yan smiled confidently. "Don't worry. I won't let you down this time!"</p>

  <p>"I hope so." Marsh nodded.</p>

  <p>Seeing Yan so confident, Zheng sighed to himself.</p>

  <p>With her incredible talent, she might soon become a consummate True God.</p>

  <p>Both Harold and Marsh had high hopes for her. As her brother, he obviously ought to go all out to assist her in obtaining that inheritance.</p>

  <p>The trajectory of the sun in the divine land was very peculiar.</p>

  <p>The huge fireball that was enough to burn everything rose up from the Ray Tree, and flew at an extremely high speed in the sky of the divine land.</p>

  <p>It was able to travel across hundreds of small regions within just two hours and it could cross the entire divine land and reach the edge of the Sunrest Tree in the west within 24 hours.</p>

  <p>If one stood atop the Heavenly Sword Divine City and looked to the west, he would see that the western side of the sky was bloody red, and the bright red light shone like a sharp knife. Even the True Gods' eyes would pain at the sight of it.</p>

  <p>It was said that every time the sun set in the west, the roots and the stems of the Sunrest Tree would be burnt to ashes.</p>

  <p>Thankfully, countless new roots and stems would grow each time and the roots would anchor themselves firmly in the sea again.</p>

  <p>This process would repeat every day.</p>

  <p>This mysterious phenomenon had existed ever since the divine land was built.</p>

  <p>One after another, the top-rank True Gods, who passed the second round of screening, got selected.</p>

  <p>Judging from the number of the True Gods participating in this debate over the Godly Ways, it was evident that many True Gods were already aware of the significance of this debate.</p>

  <p>In the last few debates, about 50 to 60 top-rank True Gods of humble birth were selected.</p>

  <p>But this time, the shortlisted figure was over a hundred!</p>

  <p>In addition to these True Gods of humble birth, members of powerful clans had also arrived on the Floating Island of the Sword Clan one after another.</p>

  <p>They could reach the Heavenly Sword Divine City in a very short period of time using the transmission array in the Floating Island of the Sword Clan.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, is it true? Do I really have a nephew?" Yan asked, staring at Zheng expectantly with her big eyes. It seemed that she was quite interested in this topic.</p>

  <p>"Of course!" replied Zheng happily.</p>

  <p>"Well..." Yan said with her head tilted to one side, "I wonder what gift I should buy for my nephew."</p>

  <p>Zheng pursed his lips. He knew that his son was greedy when it came to gifts and would never refuse one. He was worried that Yan would also get blackmailed by his mischievous son.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I wanted Hallet to take me to the Swirl Forest, but he said it was too risky. Moreover, I have been trying to cultivate the Truth of Godly Way."</p>

  <p>Yan shook her head in disappointment as she wasn't able to see her young nephew.</p>

  <p>In fact, Harold had kept the Truth of Godly Way for Zheng in the Everest Spirit Mountain.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng never showed up. So Yan had to carry the heavy load on her shoulders.</p>

  <p>After Yan inquired about her nephew, her interest was quickly diverted to her sisters-in-law.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, how many sisters-in-law do I have now?"</p>

  <p>"And which one do you like best?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, wait, which one do you think is the prettiest?"</p>

  <p>"Well... Am I prettier than them?"</p>

  <p>Yan's bombardment of questions made Zheng see stars. He didn't know how to answer them all.</p>

  <p>By the time Zheng answered her questions briefly, other members of the Sword Clan came.</p>

  <p>Many True Gods had gathered in the main hall located in the center of the Heavenly Sword Divine City.</p>

  <p>Elites from various powerful clans and the selected top-rank True Gods of humble birth all gathered here.</p>

  <p>There was a buzz in the air. Most of the top-rank True Gods showed a hint of excitement.</p>

  <p>Zheng and Yan also stepped into this spacious main hall led by Harold.</p>

  <p>The moment this trio entered, many eyes turned to them. The noise level in the hall suddenly went down.</p>

  <p>A majority of the True Gods in this hall knew too much about Harold. Of course, they had also heard a lot about Zheng.</p>

  <p>Enoch and some top-rank True Gods were engaged in an excited conversation at one end of the hall but when he saw Yan, his eyes lit up.</p>

  <p>"Look! That's the extraordinary girl I'm talking about! I don't know which first-tier clan she's from. If it weren't for her, I probably wouldn't be able to pass the second round of screening. I'll go and say hello to her. Haha!"</p>

  <p>Enoch didn't sense the change in the atmosphere in the hall and walked straight to Yan.</p>
