<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2552 Take Action In Person </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Hiram, Sarah, and Amos could change into eight thousand feet tall giants and were regarded as mid-rank Wild Gods.</p>

  <p>However, there was a huge difference between their strength and that of a Wild God with a bloodline.</p>

  <p>They would be the ones to get killed.</p>

  <p>Hiram was considered a brave warrior. He clenched his teeth and held onto his rake, standing still despite the oncoming attack of Bilaal from the Yellow Emperor race.</p>

  <p>Amos looked as if he was prepared to fight to the death, but he actually kept a safe distance and was always prepared to turn tail if things went south.</p>

  <p>Hiram didn't think much after hearing Zheng's words. He opened his mouth and let out a roar, activating the Wild God Power in his body as he jumped up and slashed his rake towards Bilaal.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Sarah's figure flashed past the other side, armed with a short sword.</p>

  <p>Despite her weapon being a short sword, it should be considered that the one who wielded it was about eight thousand feet tall which made the sword more than a thousand feet long.</p>

  <p>"Are you guys seriously resisting? Ha-ha!" Bilaal mocked.</p>

  <p>The Yellow Emperor race regarded these Wild Gods as mere target practice. Bilaal thought of them as nothing more than dirt so he didn't really take them seriously.</p>

  <p>His entire body flashed with golden light and he stretched out his thick, right hand to directly snatch Hiram's rake.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes flashed.</p>

  <p>"Frenzy of Goodwill and Malice!"</p>

  <p>As he shouted, his strong soul force activated the Shadow Bearing Sword. This soul attack with the Truth of Godly Way rushed towards Bilaal.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>Bilaal felt as if his head had been hit by a heavy hammer and was immediately dazed.</p>

  <p>He was totally confused and ended up standing in place like a fool.</p>

  <p>"I'll hit you to death!"</p>

  <p>Hiram knew he had to take advantage of this and tried to also hit Bilaal.</p>

  <p>He didn't know how Zheng did it but knew it was his opening.</p>

  <p>The huge rake came smashing down towards Bilaal.</p>

  <p>"Clang!"</p>

  <p>The rake came crashing down on Bilaal's head with a crisp sound.</p>

  <p>They saw how the golden light above him release bursts of glistening light waves that successfully blocked Hiram's extremely powerful attack.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>Sarah, who was at the side, also swung her short sword and struck it into Bilaal's rib.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the golden light around Bilaal served as impenetrable armor. The short sword, sharp as it was, failed to pierce Bilaal's body.</p>

  <p>With a reluctant expression on her face, Sarah turned and once again stabbed the short sword towards Bilaal.</p>

  <p>"Whizzing, whizzing..."</p>

  <p>Her attacks were aimed at his vital parts but were blocked by the golden light each time.</p>

  <p>Hiram had also taken this time to repeatedly smash Bilaal's head with his rake several times but he still couldn't break through the golden light.</p>

  <p>On the other side, Romeo continued to dodge his pursuers. The sight of his allies unable to land a blow on Bilaal caused him great anxiety. He was initially surprised at Zheng's abilities but it seemed that the other Wild Gods weren't even able to break Bilaal's Yellow Emperor Wild Body.</p>

  <p>This was truly a waste of opportunity.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, he was currently in a tight spot and couldn't help them kill Bilaal.</p>

  <p>Zheng's soul attack messed Bilaal's mind for a moment. He had to spend a few moments in a daze before regaining consciousness and, when he did, his huge face was immediately distorted in anger.</p>

  <p>To think that he was a member of the Yellow Emperor race and yet was actually caught off-guard by these weak Wild Gods was laughable. If it weren't for the defensive power of his Yellow Emperor Wild Body, he would've already died.</p>

  <p>"Swish!"</p>

  <p>Bilaal reached out and took Hiram's rake with one hand and grabbed Sarah's neck with the other.</p>

  <p>The Wild God Power burst out from his body as he lifted Sarah off the ground.</p>

  <p>"You are just a woman. But you are very bold," he said with a vicious smile.</p>

  <p>Sarah clawed at his hand, unable to say a word against him.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Zheng's thin figure quietly floated in Bilaal's mind.</p>

  <p>At that moment, an inaudible voice spoke to his ear. "Alas. They can't defeat you after attacking for so long. In the end, I have to take action in person..."</p>

  <p>Bilaal frowned, only realizing then that Zheng still hadn't activated the Wild God Power. The young man was merely floating around like a mosquito the entire time. Bilaal briefly wondered if it was he who released the soul attack.</p>

  <p>It was then that a unique aura emerged.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>Another huge, invisible hammer hit his head, disorienting his soul.</p>

  <p>Zheng held the hilt of the Shadow Bearing Sword on one hand and cradled the blade with the other. The aura of hundreds of Godly Ways merged in his inner world once again.</p>

  <p>"Ways-blending Strike!"</p>

  <p>"Chop!"</p>

  <p>Zheng was a mere mosquito compared to Bilaal.</p>

  <p>Despite the golden light produced by the Ways-blending Strike being a thousand feet long, it was only a mere thread compared to Bilaal's huge body.</p>

  <p>However, just as this crescent-shaped thread touched the golden light around Bilaal, it suddenly let out a harsh noise.</p>

  <p>"Sizz, sizz..."</p>

  <p>The golden light around Bilaal grew brighter and flashed crazily, as if it was finally ready to collapse.</p>

  <p>As the thin thread continued to cut forward, a crisp, smashing sound was heard. The golden light around Bilaal finally collapsed and the thread pierced through his neck.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't even bother to check if his attack killed Bilaal or not and instead floated directly to Romeo.</p>

  <p>He didn't really want to use the Ways-blending Strike in front of others which was the main reason why he hoped Hiram and Sarah could've been enough to help him kill Bilaal.</p>

  <p>However, he didn't expect the gap between ordinary Wild Gods and a Wild God with a bloodline to be so big. Bilaal was already just standing there yet the two of them could do nothing. Zheng had no choice but to intervene.</p>

  <p>Noticing that the hand that grabbed her neck lost its strength, Sarah immediately struggled and threw Bilaal's arm off her. She retreated a few steps back and stared at her foe.</p>

  <p>Hiram and Amos were also stunned.</p>

  <p>Not long after, blood spilled out of Bilaal's neck. His huge head began to tilt until it eventually fell off cleanly from his torso. Only then did they realize that Zheng had succeeded in what they failed to do. He didn't even turn into the form of a Wild God!</p>

  <p>"Well, that guy doesn't depend on the Wild God Power at all," Hiram remarked excitedly.</p>

  <p>Sarah was calmer now and couldn't help but heave a sigh of relief. She looked at Zheng with complex emotions. "I haven't heard of a True God that possesses such powerful strength!"</p>

  <p>Amos couldn't help but gasp in surprise. It was only then that he realized that Zheng stabbed the sword into his neck not because of his carelessness.</p>

  <p>It was only because Zheng showed him mercy that he was still alive and breathing.</p>
