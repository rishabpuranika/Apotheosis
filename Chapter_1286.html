<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>What the hell was the Roaring Token?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stared at Immortal Book in bewilderment.</p>

  <p>Immortal Book shook his head, preparing to showcase his knowledge.</p>

  <p>But Saul intervened and said, "This Roaring Token is an old object that was used by the master in the past. If one uses the Roaring Token to shout out something, his voice can be heard throughout the entire universe. The Roaring Token is very common in the universe, but our master's Roaring Token is special. It can be used countless times."</p>

  <p>"Countless times!" the cyan dragon roared once again.</p>

  <p>"How could there be such a damned thing!" the red dragon roared after being uncommunicative all this while.</p>

  <p>The two Genuine Dragons were inexplicably excited. Luo Luo Zheng was dizzy with all the roaring going on in his head. He had learned from Saul that the Roaring Token was just a tool to shout out words. Moreover, Saul had introduced the Roaring Token rather indifferently, which showed that it was perhaps not something important. But why were the two Genuine Dragons so excited?</p>

  <p>"Why?" Luo Luo Zheng asked the cyan dragon, confused.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon let out a long sigh and then said incredulously, "I know that the owner of this Immortal Mansion is a True God who surpasses the natural law, but I didn't expect him to actually have such a treasure..."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean? Can you explain more clearly?" The cyan dragon wasn't helping relieve Luo Zheng's confusion. This token was just a tool for shouting, so why did the cyan dragon marvel so much at it? The cyan dragon hadn't been this excited when Luo Luo Zheng had obtained the Black Star.</p>

  <p>Could it be that the Roaring Token was better than the supreme divine weapon?</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon said, "A hundred thousand supreme worlds are too vast and it is extremely inconvenient to communicate with others in the universe. A single Roaring Token can spread your voice throughout the entire universe!"</p>

  <p>"Oh..." Saul had just talked about what the Roaring Token did and the cyan dragon was merely repeating it all. Was spreading the voice all over the universe that important?</p>

  <p>Seeing Luo Zheng's dubious expression, the cyan dragon smiled and said,</p>

  <p>"Once you fly into the Upper World, you'll have the right to speak if your voice can spread throughout the universe. Which is why every race and every force demand that the Roaring Token be used an unlimited number of times!"</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon was trying his best to explain the Roaring Token to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng knew that the Upper World was composed of a hundred thousand supreme worlds, but he didn't have a clear understanding of the scope of these worlds.</p>

  <p>The supreme world was too large, which made gathering and making use of its forces extremely difficult.</p>

  <p>Besides, as the three great forces of the human race occupied nearly ten thousand supreme worlds, a wide range, communication became a big problem. The Roaring Token could help warriors' voices spread through the universe to let others hear them easily.</p>

  <p>Why did this token's name contain the word "Roaring"? It had something to do with a unique legendary beast in the universe called Roaring Tapir.</p>

  <p>The Roaring Tapir wasn't the strongest among the legendary beasts, but it developed an innate token as it attained adulthood. This token had a type of Law of Causality, which was why the Roaring Tapir's roar could spread throughout the entire universe.</p>

  <p>Some Supreme Lords had discovered the token of the Roaring Tapir, caught, and killed it. They then took away its throat and had their craftsman create the Roaring Token with its throat.</p>

  <p>The Roaring Token allowed the Supreme Lords to spread their voice throughout the universe.</p>

  <p>From then on, legendary beasts like the Roaring Tapir faced extremely tragic fates.</p>

  <p>Back then, a lot of Roaring Tokens existed in the universe, even some world lords owning a large number of them. And a number of unfamiliar voices would keep ringing in one's ears.</p>

  <p>The most ridiculous event was when two races that were considered as old enemies roared at each other and called each other names through the Roaring Tokens even though they were separated by hundreds of supreme worlds. That war of cursing lasted for months, and countless creatures in the universe suffered.</p>

  <p>So some Supreme Lords had had no choice but to use the Roaring Tokens to warn the two races against quarreling. If these two races continued to shout abuse, then they would have to be very careful of their own territories!</p>

  <p>But there wasn't much use in warning someone. If someone with a high status was to randomly use the Roaring Token and got punished by the Supreme Lords, he could just ask an insignificant subordinate to be the scapegoat. On the other hand, if some nameless warriors used the Roaring Tokens to make their voices heard throughout the entire universe, it was impossible for others to find the sources or figure out who were using the Roaring Tokens since no one knew their identities.</p>

  <p>The universe didn't contain a countless number of Roaring Tapirs.</p>

  <p>But the number of Roaring Tapirs wasn't small either. A lot of races needed the Roaring Tokes. It could be said that whoever had the most number of Roaring Tokens would be able to command a certain right to speak.</p>

  <p>One Roaring Tapir's throat could only be used to make one Roaring Token. Even the best craftsman could, at the maximum, only create two tokens with one Roaring Tapir's throat. And so, the number of Roaring Tapirs began to rapidly decrease.</p>

  <p>It had ended up becoming an extremely rare species.</p>

  <p>Since its numbers dwindled, the Roaring Tapir's value increased exponentially to the point where ordinary world lords could no longer afford the Roaring Tokens. Because of this, an undisturbed, quiet environment followed hundreds of years of chaos in the universe, much to everyone's relief.</p>

  <p>There were still quite a few Roaring Tokens in the universe, thanks to some large forces that had started raising the Roaring Tapirs. But their growth was slow and the value of the Roaring Tokens was still very high.</p>

  <p>In the hundred thousand supreme worlds, there were a few world lords who had one or two Roaring Tokens. But they weren't willing to use them recklessly.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords had more Roaring Tokens, but they were also against casually using them.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng understood the Roaring Token better once the cyan dragon had introduced it to him.</p>

  <p>He hadn't thought that a tool for shouting words across the universe would be so important. However, once he had thought about it, he understood the functioning of the Roaring Token better.</p>

  <p>To put it bluntly, this thing could shout out to the entire universe any number of times.</p>

  <p>For example, if there ever was a war between humans and ogres, and both sides were fighting in thousands of supreme worlds, it would be extremely inconvenient to communicate with each other. By the time reinforcements got news of fierce battles taking place in obscure places of a supreme world, the battles would have already ended. But if they used the Roaring Token to communicate with their members, news would reach their reinforcements in a short time.</p>

  <p>Besides, in a battle between two races, if one side had a lot of Roaring Tokens, they would make use of them to abuse and defame the other side, and even fabricate fake intelligence, which would be a huge blow to the morale of the enemy.</p>

  <p>If one side had too few of the Roaring Tokens, or none at all, then members could do nothing but stare.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng laughed as he looked at the Roaring Token in his hand. It was indeed a good thing.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did not forget that he still had one more important goal, and that was to find his sister. Although he felt that Yan was safe, he couldn't accept the fact that she had been taken away by someone he did not know.</p>

  <p>If he were to fly into the Upper World in the future, Luo Luo Zheng might have to use this Roaring Token to shout to Yan to see if she could reply.</p>

  <p>"I just can't figure out how the owner of the Immortal Mansion created a Roaring Token that can be used for unlimited times!" the cyan dragon said disbelievingly, still in shock.</p>

  <p>"I don't care!" Luo Luo Zheng couldn't be bothered to think about this, as long as it was useful.</p>

  <p>Once he had put the Roaring Token into his space ring, Luo Luo Zheng crushed the second fragment. As he did so, a shining chain appeared within the fragment. Luo Luo Zheng pulled the chain out and said, disappointment lacing his voice, "This... What the hell is this?"</p>

  <p>In the beginning, he had thought that his master's gift would most likely be a supreme divine weapon. And he had guessed that his master might give him at least a divine weapon. But now, as he crushed the fragments, he was confused as to why he was getting such strange things.</p>

  <p>When Saul saw the chain, he smiled and said, "This is the Death Chain!"</p>

  <p>"The Death Chain? What's the use of it?" Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"When you first entered the Immortal Mansion, did you trigger a Desperate Melee in the pavilion?" Saul asked as way of an answer.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded. He still remembered that Desperate Melee vividly.</p>

  <p>Everyone had been connected to each other by a special energy and fought a life-and-death battle as only one could survive in the end.</p>

  <p>"So that's it. The Death Chain can lock you and your opponent together, and it would open only after the battle is over and one of the fighters is killed. Even if a Supreme Lord is locked up with you, he won't be able to escape if he can't kill you."</p>
