<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Every martial arts cultivator had undergone rigorous martial arts refinement that improved their physical fitness and endurance.</p>

  <p>They were able to surpass human limitations even the standard human lifespan. Thus, they could live longer than any normal human.</p>

  <p>An ordinary human could rarely live more than one hundred years. The martial arts cultivators, on the other hand, could live much more than one hundred years. And the martial arts cultivators at the same level as the head of the Dragon Abyss Palace had an average lifespan of ten thousand years.</p>

  <p>The head of the Dragon Abyss Palace looked like a sixteen-year-old girl, but her actual age was already beyond a human's imagination.</p>

  <p>The actual age of the head of the Dragon Abyss Palace might be unknown or had been lost in counting. But it could be traced back as to when she was actually sixteen years old. At that time, Luo Zheng's ancestors had not yet been born in this world. Even the empires that existed before the Burning Sky Empire had not yet existed.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng was so naive about this fact that he even thought the head of the Dragon Abyss was sixteen years old.</p>

  <p>It sounded offensive, but she didn't mind it at all. On the contrary, she was flattered. Despite her age, she was still a woman who required that kind of attention and flattery from time to time. But since she became the head of the Dragon Abyss Palace, no one dared to speak to her so casually that she rarely heard such kind of flattery.</p>

  <p>Women always wanted to look young despite their age. They required that kind of validation, especially from men. And the head of the Dragon Abyss Palace was no exception. After all, she was still a woman.</p>

  <p>The craze of women wanting to look young even after they aged had created a need for anti-aging pills. But these anti-aging pills were quite expensive in the Upper World. The head of Dragon Abyss Palace had spent a lot on anti-aging pills to remain young-looking all these years.</p>

  <p>But despite that, no one had praised her youthful look and glow.</p>

  <p>So, Luo Zheng's words was the most flattering thing she had heard in her lifetime. She felt that her efforts in keeping her youthful look had paid off when a man finally took notice.</p>

  <p>"Silly! Stop flattering me now! Just call me aunt," she waved her hands and giggled. She had to be realistic about their age gap and set the right atmosphere between her and Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did no longer argue and just heeded her orders.</p>

  <p>Then she continued with a smile, "I heard from Elder Wei about your intention to join our Dragon Abyss Palace. Is that true?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's right," Luo Luo Zheng answered. Indeed, Luo Luo Zheng had intended to be part of the Dragon Abyss Palace.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing this, the head of Dragon Abyss Palace reached out her hand and flipped it over. Then, out of the blue, a bottle appeared. "There are about twenty drops of Genuine Dragon blood inside this bottle. You can use them to increase the concentration of Genuine Dragon blood in your blood."</p>

  <p>When Alan heard this, he gave a cold snort on the side. He had previously offered Luo Luo Zheng fifty drops of Genuine Dragon blood as a reward, but the latter didn't take it. Now, the head of the Dragon Abyss Palace was offering him lesser drops of the said blood and Alan thought that Luo Luo Zheng was being a fool in this deal.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the head of Dragon Abyss Palace turned her hand over again and said, "Now, this is a drop of Genuine Dragon Blood Essence. It's not the ordinary Genuine Dragon blood. You can use it to save your life at a crucial moment."</p>

  <p>This time, Alan's eyes had nearly popped out of his head.</p>

  <p>Dennis, Elder Wei, and Zack were also astonished at the current offer.</p>

  <p>They didn't say a word, but their eyes were showing great eagerness at the sight of that one drop of Genuine Dragon Blood Essence.</p>

  <p>The Genuine Dragon Blood and the Genuine Dragon Blood Essence sounded alike, but they were essentially different in all aspects.</p>

  <p>A Genuine Dragon's body contained an amount of blood enough to wash away a whole continent. Hence, the Dragon Lineage Human had plenty of Genuine Dragon Blood to give away to their younger members as rewards.</p>

  <p>However, the Genuine Dragon Blood Essence was quite rare compared to the Genuine Dragon Blood. The Dragon Lineage Human built 936 halls and 1300 palaces in total. From the 2, 000 branches of the race, some of them were lucky enough to possess over one hundred drops of Genuine Dragon Blood Essence, while the rest only had dozens of drops.</p>

  <p>Hence, the other halls and palaces were eager to get even one drop of this precious treasure.</p>

  <p>If the heads of these halls and palaces had the chance to acquire it, they would immediately use it to strengthen themselves.</p>

  <p>The Genuine Dragon Blood Essence was equivalent to one thousand drops of the Genuine Dragon Blood?that was if someone was willing to exchange their Genuine Dragon Blood Essence for some Genuine Dragon Blood.</p>

  <p>But just now, the head of Dragon Abyss Palace casually gifted one drop of the Genuine Dragon Blood Essence to Luo Luo Zheng. It was quite an extravagant gift! If anyone was offered the Genuine Dragon Blood Essence, he wouldn't think twice and would just blindly accept it.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng must be flattered by the gift that the head of the Dragon Abyss Palace was offering. Alan, Dennis, Elder Wei, and Zack were all taken aback by her generosity towards Luo Luo Zheng. They didn't think that she could be that generous to anyone.</p>

  <p>Dennis who envied Luo Luo Zheng right now had to ask, "Do you really intend to give it to him as a gift? The Genuine Dragon Blood Essence would be too much of a gift to that boy?"</p>

  <p>The head of Dragon Abyss Palace, however, raised her eyebrows at Dennis and said, "Of course I do. Did you hear me stutter? Have I ever changed my mind?"</p>

  <p>Dennis waved his hand. He didn't mean to offend her by asking. He said,</p>

  <p>"No, I didn't mean to question your generosity. I just feel that Genuine Dragon Blood Essence is rare. It's the most valuable thing to just be gifted to anyone."</p>

  <p>Dennis could not shrug off that feeling. The Genuine Dragon Blood Essence was one of the Dragon Abyss Palace's most important treasures.</p>

  <p>It seemed too good to be true that the head of the Dragon Abyss Palace would just give it to someone from the Lower World like Luo Luo Zheng who was not even qualified to be in their presence. Dennis sensed that it might have something to do with the dragon named Josh. Or perhaps the head of the Dragon Abyss Palace had found something else.</p>
