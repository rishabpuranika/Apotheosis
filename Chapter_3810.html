  <p>
</p>

  <p>Although Zheng didn't feel comfortable with his current form, he could now make do with it as he had been like this for so long.</p>

  <p>The beasts that were rushing over him were much weaker than him.</p>

  <p>It didn't matter if it was big or small. The moment he caught a creature, he tore it up like it was just a rotten piece of hemp rope.</p>

  <p>The dead beasts were like ink on paper, soaring towards Zheng's body and lingering around him.</p>

  <p>The ink dripped from the Eternal Scroll Painting and turned into wisps of black smoke, shooting straight into Zheng's Three Purities Stone.</p>

  <p>"He finally gets some black smoke," Libby said, happy at this development.</p>

  <p>Everyone from the Oneness Sky Palace knew that Zheng was highly valued, and that his previous performance had been bad.</p>

  <p>The only thing that made them happy was that Zheng seemed to have saved himself even though so many Other Shore creatures had died within the Eternal Scroll Painting that had clearly turned into a bloody field.</p>

  <p>They hadn't expected Zheng to finally begin hunting beasts in the scroll painting.</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish! Swish!</p>

  <p>Wisps of black smoke continued to gather, gaining speed with each passing minute.</p>

  <p>"Gosh, how many beasts did he kill in one go?" Pearce asked, panting, his eyes wide.</p>

  <p>He had never entered the Eternal Scroll Painting, but he still knew a few things, thanks to the ancient books. It wasn't normal for Zheng to collect the black smoke at such a fast speed.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore creatures that had originally held a keen interest in Zheng had all chosen to give up because many people belonging to almost every Other Shore race had died. But now, the descending black smoke attracted their attention once again.</p>

  <p>"What's going on with Zheng?"</p>

  <p>"How is he so fast? Did he encounter a large group of beasts?"</p>

  <p>"So many people have died in the Eternal Scroll Painting. Does it have anything to do with him?"</p>

  <p>There was no doubt that there was something unusual about Zheng's performance, and the Eternal Scroll Painting that had killed so many people. No wonder people were beginning to connect the two together.</p>

  <p>But even Zheng, who was in the painting, was dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>There were too many beasts that were coming for him and surrounding him, like lambs to the slaughter. .</p>

  <p>"Primeval Lord of Heaven, what do you think is the point of killing these beasts?"</p>

  <p>Zheng asked as he waved his hands to tear the beasts apart. "The Eternal Scroll Painting is also a trial. So what's the use of the black smoke?"</p>

  <p>Both the Soul City and the Land of Bone Tribulation were well understood.</p>

  <p>The Soul City allowed one's soul to enter a new realm, while the Land of Bone Tribulation allowed one's physical body to enter a new realm, both multiplying one's strength.</p>

  <p>One usually entered the Eternal Scroll Painting to obtain a bloodline, but what was the use of killing the beasts in it and obtaining the black smoke?</p>

  <p>"This black smoke is a kind of medium," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said.</p>

  <p>"The place where people can obtain bloodlines isn't in the chaos but in the Abstruse Energy World. I believe you know how difficult it will be if you enter the Abstruse Energy World in your ordinary form."</p>

  <p>Zheng had been to the Abstruse Energy World. He had lost himself once he had entered it and had lost track of time and space. It was as if he had become completely blind and deaf.</p>

  <p>The others were much worse than how Zheng had been.</p>

  <p>If the bloodlines were really placed on the ground like treasures, the Other Shore creatures would either not be able to pick them up, or they wouldn't be able to understand what it was on the ground.</p>

  <p>But Geoffrey was obviously an exception.</p>

  <p>Transforming into the special form in the painting was only the first step.</p>

  <p>Fusing with the black smoke was the second. This kind of medium was a disguised test.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore creatures were also busy killing beasts.</p>

  <p>More than two-thirds of the Other Shore creatures had been eliminated by that group of Worm Tapirs. As a result, more than half the competitors in the Eternal Scroll Painting had been eliminated. The competition was really not that fierce. The remaining creatures didn't need to fight for the beasts.</p>

  <p>No one could say if there would be another group of Worm Tapirs appearing on the first page. The best thing for them to do would be to quickly move to the second page before anything else happened.</p>

  <p>Wisps of black smoke continued to descend from within the Eternal Scroll Painting and into the Three Purities Stones. Zheng's Three Purities Stone was the most prominent of them all. The black smoke was like a pillar that stretched endlessly.</p>

  <p>This lasted for about five minutes. Zheng didn't know how many beasts he had killed. The moment he was done fusing with the black smoke, he suddenly felt his body sink.</p>

  <p>It was as if someone had poured a massive amount of lead into his body.</p>

  <p>The Eternal Scroll Painting's white ground began to sink, with Zheng trapped within it.</p>

  <p>It took only a moment to go from white to black and then from black to white again.</p>

  <p>When Zheng's vision was restored, he discovered that he was still lying on the Eternal Scroll Painting, in the flat form.</p>

  <p>"The second page seems to be no different than the first page," Zheng said.</p>

  <p>"Not at all. Go and have a look," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said.</p>

  <p>Zheng moved some distance before two lines came into sight.</p>

  <p>He found that these two lines outlined a road. Black thorns lined the road on both sides.</p>

  <p>These thorns were in the painting but the Primeval Lord of Heaven didn't hesitate to warn Zheng that they would be fatal.</p>

  <p>Even without his warning, Zheng wouldn't be so bored that he'd be compelled to step on them.</p>

  <p>According to what they had previously understood, since the first page of the scroll painting was a process of absorbing the medium, the second page must technically be a transition between the Abstruse Energy World and the chaos. Seen this way, the third page was already in the Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>The key to decide what one could get in the Abstruse Energy World was on the second page.</p>

  <p>Zheng walked along the road for quite a while. The two lines curved out in the distance and opened out into an open platform on which a few Other Shore creatures were already standing.</p>

  <p>Zheng was not the first one to enter the second page. When the Worm Tapirs had appeared, quite a number of creatures had already killed enough beasts.</p>

  <p>These creatures had been lucky to avoid the slaughter.</p>

  <p>The human-like figure standing on the left side of the platform was familiar to Zheng. His forehead had an eye drawn on it. A three-eyed warrior!</p>

  <p>Zheng was sure that this was none other than Egan from the Three Eyes race.</p>

  <p>"You've also entered the second page!" Egan exclaimed, noticing Zheng.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?"</p>

  <p>Zheng said, noticing that the moment he entered the platform, all the Other Shore creatures, including Egan, surrounded him.</p>

  <p>"Where are the other members of my Violet Cloud race? Why haven't they entered the second page? Tell me if you don't want to die!" a member of the Violet Cloud race commanded. 'This must be Walden, ' Zheng thought.</p>
