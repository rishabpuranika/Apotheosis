<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Evil God's face became serious as the black energy surrounding him turned into a pair of large wings. With a flap of his wings, he rushed towards Zheng at lightning speed.</p>

  <p>However, his wings were not a match compared to the Wing King's feather.</p>

  <p>As a result, the Evil God was evident to be lower in level in terms of speed and bodily movement skills.</p>

  <p>Zheng's fingertips were surrounded by three different colored energies. As soon as the Evil God approached him, he would just calmly and smoothly dodge the attacks while shooting back the three energies from different angles.</p>

  <p>The Truth of Three-Energy Construction was a kind of theurgy used to create various things. Considering its pure energy, it was much stronger than the other Truths of Godly Ways. Its power could be proved through the fact that Zheng was restrained by a group of little monsters as soon as he entered King Manard's space.</p>

  <p>The Evil God continued chasing Zheng in the air for a while. However, instead of catching Zheng, the Evil God was just pierced through by the three energies from time to time.</p>

  <p>If not for his current special constitution that allowed his body to recover in an instant, he would have been crushed to pieces already.</p>

  <p>After realizing that chasing Zheng would do him no good, the Evil God finally stopped. He landed on the ground and stared at Zheng with disdain.</p>

  <p>'It can't go on like this. I will just exhaust myself and will accomplish nothing, ' he thought.</p>

  <p>"My creator, won't you dare to fight me fair and square?" the Evil God asked as he gave a slight shudder.</p>

  <p>Then, the shadow of Snake Goddess vanished from his back, together with the heads and arms. Soon after, the Mighty Golden Body covering his entire body also disappeared.</p>

  <p>With this, he abandoned all his bloodline theurgies.</p>

  <p>Zheng stayed in the air and took the cyan feather over his head with his hand.</p>

  <p>He lightly brushed it and replied, "What do you mean by fighting you fair and square? This is the ability that the Other Shore Token gave me. Is it my fault that I possess a mighty token?"</p>

  <p>The Evil God smiled coldly, and his voice suddenly changed. "In that case, let me show you the true horror of this world."</p>

  <p>Immediately, the energy flow of the world began to accelerate.</p>

  <p>The black energy turned into thick clouds and gathered above the Evil God's head. It was as if a huge abyss was being created.</p>

  <p>Then the gathering energy turned into flashes of black lightning that lashed directly towards the Evil God.</p>

  <p>"Clap, clap, clap!"</p>

  <p>Every time a bolt of black lightning hit the Evil God, his face would twitch.</p>

  <p>The pain must be so agonizing that no ordinary person would endure it.</p>

  <p>Zheng still clearly remembered the piercing screams of the man from the Separate Abyss race when he was bitten by the four-legged black snakes.</p>

  <p>The black lightning that emerged from the stormy clouds became fiercer and fiercer. The Evil God receiving all the bolts of lightning was writhing in pain as his body grew bigger and his aura became stronger.</p>

  <p>Previously, the Evil God, Zheng, and Mount all possessed the most powerful auras among the warriors of the same level.</p>

  <p>However, as the Evil God's aura continuously grew stronger, it was now hard for any ordinary warrior at the Chaotic Source Realm to compete with him.</p>

  <p>Under the pressure of his aura, many men present in the world were greatly distressed. They all felt that something was going to go wrong any minute.</p>

  <p>The Evil God's avatars, who had been fighting with the three women until now, dissipated into black energy and merged into the whirlpool of gathered energy.</p>

  <p>Yan, Dorothy, and Feng Ge quickly flew over and stood by Zheng's side.</p>

  <p>"Brother!"</p>

  <p>"Zheng!"</p>

  <p>As they sensed that the Evil God's aura had greatly soared, they started to feel a little frightened but firmly decided to fight alongside Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Get out of here," Zheng ordered in a stiff voice.</p>

  <p>"But..."</p>

  <p>Yan wanted to argue with him, but when she saw how serious the look was on her brother's face, she couldn't utter another word. Her eyes turned red and tears instantly formed.</p>

  <p>Zheng's heart softened at the sight of Yan's expression. Then he said, "I created him, so I should be the one to subdue him. This is our battle."</p>

  <p>Some battles should be fought one-on-one. Not only would they be unable to help Zheng, but they could also become a hindrance.</p>

  <p>"What are you saying? We can always help you," Feng Ge answered stubbornly.</p>

  <p>The journey to the Chaotic Source World enlightened Feng Ge about the talents of this world.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge, Chaim, and Dorothy were already considered to be the strongest warriors compared to their peers in the Oneness Sky Palace. However, when compared to Mount, the Evil God, and Zheng, the gap was extremely wide as the strength of those three could even give the warriors at the Chaotic Source Realm a hard time.</p>

  <p>She actually was aware of it, yet she still chose to stand by Zheng's side.</p>

  <p>Just then, from a distance, Mount suddenly stretched out his hand and waved in the air towards Zheng. Then, a space instantly covered the three women.</p>

  <p>As Mount outlined the space, the three women immediately disappeared and were sent to Chaim's side.</p>

  <p>Zheng and Mount gave a glance to each other. "I want to see you fight him with all you've got," Mount told Zheng with a faint smile on his face.</p>

  <p>Being an avatar of the Chaos Ancient God, it was not surprising that Mount was quite proficient in dealing with people.</p>

  <p>He was arrogant and had never taken any opponent at his level seriously no matter if it was Zheng or the Evil God.</p>

  <p>There should be not much of a comparison in terms of knowledge, birth, and talent.</p>

  <p>That was why Mount didn't expect that he would be defeated by the Evil God.</p>

  <p>Despite that, he was reasonable enough and openly accepted his failure.</p>

  <p>Now, he wanted to see if Zheng was really a match for the Evil God.</p>

  <p>It wasn't only Mount who was looking forward to the battle, but also the team leaders outside the Chaotic Source World. They were patiently waiting and had taken a great interest in the fight.</p>

  <p>"The man in black has even defeated Mount. What domineering skills he has!"</p>

  <p>"Just now, he must have let go of all the bloodline theurgies. Does that mean that there are still other theurgies that he could use in that world?"</p>

  <p>"Probably. We're about to see…"</p>

  <p>"I can't believe there are such talented warriors in the world! I think you would agree that when these young people enter the Chaotic Source Realm, the gap between them and us would be really narrow!"</p>

  <p>These leaders didn't have any sectarian bias and they just wanted to see for themselves who was stronger between Zheng and the Evil God.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the leaders from the Oneness Sky Palace, including Athemar and Winchell, were more nervous.</p>

  <p>They had known that Zheng and the Evil God would engage in a fierce battle, but they never thought that it would escalate to this degree.</p>

  <p>The three women didn't return after Mount sent them away from the center of the battlefield.</p>

  <p>Facing the Evil God reinforced by the black lightning, the Civilization Artifact within Zheng's inner world gradually emerged. As he held it in the air, a cyan-colored chessboard appeared in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>Zheng reached out his hand and gently swept the board. A chess piece surfaced and a jade sculpture materialized beside him.</p>

  <p>"What is that strange sculpture? Is it an Other Shore Token of the descending type?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think that sculpture contains that much power."</p>

  <p>"I agree with you. I'll bet that it wouldn't even withstand a single blow from me!"</p>

  <p>Everyone couldn't help but shake their heads as they saw Zheng released the jade sculpture.</p>

  <p>They wondered if Zheng had no other powerful skill to summon.</p>

  <p>"His Strength God Totem is even stronger than this one. Why did he let this one descend?" Dorothy mumbled with a puzzled expression on her face.</p>

  <p>"What is he trying to do?" Yan asked curiously as she lightly scratched her head.</p>

  <p>When Feng Ge saw the Regal Jade chessboard, her eyes widened. Among all the people that were currently present, only she knew about the true power of the chessboard.</p>

  <p>Every time a sculpture landed, its strength would increase little by little.</p>
