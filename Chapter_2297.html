<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Spiritual Heart Hall was immersed in a peaceful atmosphere.</p>

  <p>The maids cheerfully splashed the Holy Dew, covering the hall with sparkling crystals.</p>

  <p>Alfredo and the senior leaders of the Han Clan were all present in the hall. Their sole aim was to maintain the ranking of the Han Clan's Floating Island. If the total number of points did not meet the requirement at the final stage, then they would dismiss the Purple Soul Hall thus, liberating themselves from all the trouble caused by the women of the Purple Soul Hall, as agreed before.</p>

  <p>But in the final two days, Han Liusu defeated the anonymous man. She elevated the ranking of the Han Clan without any help. She accumulated around two million points, so the ranking of the Han Clan didn't fall.</p>

  <p>They climbed up a few places instead. The members of the Han Clan were witnessing a miracle.</p>

  <p>Joy wore a purple dress. She looked quite elegant and beautiful in that dress. She leaned on the bench glancing around, lost in her thoughts.</p>

  <p>"To be fair, Joy, our clan's Demi-holy Being made the greatest contribution to the Han Clan. She sent such a talented disciple to help us at our time of need. I didn't expect her to be capable of such a thing."</p>

  <p>Alfredo chuckled.</p>

  <p>The clan members looked at Joy with great admiration.</p>

  <p>Joy raised her head, a confused expression on her face, and asked, "What do you mean? I think our princess contributed the most. She helped us when we needed her the most."</p>

  <p>"If the anonymous man isn't your disciple, how was he defeated by the princess so easily? Moreover, the Gods Killing Sword Array that was used by the anonymous man is your unique theurgy, isn't it? Today is a big day for us. Why don't you bring such a talented disciple here?"</p>

  <p>Alfredo said with a smile.</p>

  <p>Joy gave Alfredo a hard look and replied, "I don't know what you are talking about. There is no such talent in my Purple Soul Hall. I heard that the anonymous man has even mastered my Gods Killing Sword Array.</p>

  <p>What's more queer is that he can display the illusory swords with the Cross-world Theurgy. That's an impressive feat. I'm curious about him myself."</p>

  <p>Many people had believed that the anonymous man belonged to the Purple Soul Hall of the Han Clan. They thought that he was a new disciple of Joy.</p>

  <p>But Joy was adamant and protecting Zheng's identity was her top priority.</p>

  <p>Had Luo Zheng been an ordinary talent, no trouble would have brewed. But since Luo Zheng was not an ordinary talent, the Dongfang Clan would have taken him away if they wanted to.</p>

  <p>Therefore, keeping Zheng's identity safe was quite important. He had to enter the Everest Spirit Mountain as soon as possible. If the Dongfang Clan took Luo Zheng away, his identity would be revealed, and all his secrets would be exposed.</p>

  <p>So, when Luo Zheng cultivated in seclusion, Joy kept a distance from him so that no one could see them together.</p>

  <p>As for the questions, Joy pretended to be ignorant of such matters. There was no solid evidence to prove that the anonymous man was in the Purple Soul Hall.</p>

  <p>"That anonymous man isn't in the Purple Soul Hall?" When Alfredo noticed the shocked expression on Joy's face, he smiled. He hoped that Joy would cave in.</p>

  <p>"This anonymous man might be in the Mu Clan, the Han Clan or the Leng Clan, or maybe he lives in the Purple Soul Hall. But I really don't know who he is," said Joy shaking her head.</p>

  <p>Alfredo was quite surprised by Joy's answer, not knowing what to say.</p>

  <p>Joy's words were enough to convince Alfredo that the anonymous man was not from the Han Clan. Was it possible that he accidentally lost to Han Liusu? If this was the case, the Han Clan was quite lucky.</p>

  <p>Then, a faint laughter echoed in the Spiritual Heart Hall.</p>

  <p>Hearing the laughter, the guards, maids, and many True Gods in the hall all knelt down and said in unison, "Greetings, Holy Emperor!"</p>

  <p>As the Holy Emperor of the Han Clan, Samuel rarely showed up.</p>

  <p>The improvement of the ranking of the Han Clan was a news worth celebrating, but everyone was surprised when the Holy Emperor joined in the celebration.</p>

  <p>With a meaningful smile on her face, Joy stood up slowly and bowed to Samuel.</p>

  <p>Samuel smiled. "If all the rumors are not true, then the anonymous man wouldn't have lost to Han Liusu. He belongs to the Han Clan's Floating Island and has deliberately lost to Han Liusu because he wanted to keep his identity a secret. Han Liusu told me that the anonymous man doesn't want to join the Dongfang Clan."</p>

  <p>"You might be true, but I don't know anything about it," Joy remarked with a faint smile. She no longer supported Samuel. She thought that he had no ambitions anymore as he constantly tried to befriend the Dongfang Clan.</p>

  <p>The smile on Samuel's face suddenly disappeared. He looked directly at Joy and said, "I don't care who that person is. You must find him by hook or by crook."</p>

  <p>The smile on Joy's face disappeared as well. Suddenly, the cheerful atmosphere of the Spiritual Heart Hall turned sour.</p>

  <p>Alfredo and the others sat upright, with serious expression on their faces.</p>

  <p>They were quite surprised by the ongoing events. Was there something that the Holy Emperor knew, and they didn't?</p>

  <p>"What do you mean? I don't get it." Joy looked quite irritated.</p>

  <p>"The Dongfang Clan insists on taking him away, so we can't hide or protect him," Samuel said.</p>

  <p>"But what if I refuse to do that?" Joy snorted.</p>

  <p>Since she failed to cooperate, she knew pretending to be innocent wouldn't help her.</p>

  <p>Samuel sneered. "The Astronomical Transit Day will be held tomorrow.</p>

  <p>The people from the Dongfang Clan will send someone here after that.</p>

  <p>Deal with them on your own."</p>

  <p>With that, Samuel turned around and prepared to leave.</p>

  <p>"Samuel Han!"</p>

  <p>Joy shouted in anger. The muscles of her body tightened, showing her perfect figure.</p>

  <p>Even though Joy was the Demi-holy Being, it was not appropriate for her to call the Holy Being by his full name.</p>

  <p>Alfredo and the other senior leaders were left in awe. They couldn't quite anticipate what was going to happen next.</p>

  <p>Samuel froze in his tracks.</p>

  <p>"Must our Han Clan be a vassal for another clan?" Joy asked rising her voice.</p>

  <p>The Holy Being, as the controller of the universe, had already surpassed the scope of a True God and after they created a huge and complicated world, their comprehension of the world and life had risen to a new level. It could be said that every Holy Being had the absolute great wisdom. They had seen the collapse of the worlds as well as the annihilation of hundreds of billions of creatures and had also experienced endless cycles of reincarnation of life and death.</p>

  <p>Therefore, how could such a Holy Being become a vassal for others.</p>

  <p>Joy perceived Samuel as invincible and matchless. And the Han Clan had never depended on any other clan. Samuel's affiliation with the Dongfang Clan troubled her.</p>

  <p>Samuel turned and stated in a serious tone, "No one. I repeat, no one is qualified to make me their vassal. Not even Jeremiah Leng, Murphy Mu and Nicholas Dongfang."</p>

  <p>With that, he left, leaving everyone confused.</p>
