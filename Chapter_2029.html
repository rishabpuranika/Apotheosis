<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Connie laughed lightly as the black beads danced in the air. With her graceful movements and the ribbons on her clothes fluttering behind her, she looked ethereal.</p>

  <p>But then, without warning, she charged toward Alvin with her bare hands.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Alvin's eyes widened at Connie's sudden attack. He didn't know what the black beads were but this woman definitely had something up her sleeve, otherwise she wouldn't have charged empty handed. No, he didn't think she was that reckless. He wielded a pair of golden dark axes named Moon Howling Wolf, which was a famous first-rank divine weapon.</p>

  <p>Alvin's muscular figure leaped up, and he placed the pair of dark golden axes horizontally in front of him. After he steeled his stance then, like a raging bull, he charged towards Connie.</p>

  <p>"I'll smash you to pieces!"</p>

  <p>Alvin roared as he threw all of his weight onto his attack. With his hill-like body and explosive strength, the power of this attack was terrifying.</p>

  <p>In comparison, Connie was a lady with a delicate body. If she were to collide with Alvin, it was likely that her entire body would be smashed to smithereens! However, Connie only smiled and made no move to dodge.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the beads that were floating aimlessly in the air began to change their positions and form into a regular pattern.</p>

  <p>"That woman is so arrogant! How dare she take Alvin's attack head on?"</p>

  <p>"She must have a trick up her sleeve. She wouldn't be so stupid as not to dodge, you know?"</p>

  <p>"Hmph! I bet she's just pretending to have some elaborate plan. If Alvin doesn't fall for it, he'd be able to crush that woman into pieces!"</p>

  <p>A number of pavilions had appeared on the side of the hill facing the Iron Moon City recently. Warriors from both the human race and the Sacred race gathered inside these pavilions to exchange information and challenge each other.</p>

  <p>Hanging around wasn't free though. The warriors who wished to go inside needed to pay quite a lot of life vitality crystals.</p>

  <p>They didn't mind though. The warriors that dared to venture into the Sunflower Water World had long since showed little care for money.</p>

  <p>After all, challenging the Sacred race meant that they could die at any time, and what use would life vitality crystals be if they were dead?</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Alvin's axes flew towards Connie.</p>

  <p>However, as they collided with her, the strangest thing happened.</p>

  <p>Connie's entire body was as light as paper to sustain no forces. Connie had floated past the dual axes as if she was a willow leaf blown away by the wind. She smiled like nothing had happened. The attack hadn't affected her at all!</p>

  <p>Alvin was stupefied. His attack should have squashed the woman into a pancake but their collision only felt like he had hit cotton. He scowled.</p>

  <p>His opponent simply did not suffer. If this kept up, no matter how strong he was, he wouldn't be able to cause any damage to Connie!</p>

  <p>But Alvin was quick to react.</p>

  <p>Seeing his attack fail to hurt his opponent, he raised his axes and slashed his way towards Connie.</p>

  <p>Although Connie was as light as a feather, Alvin still wielded the golden axes like scissors, ready to cut the Sacred woman into pieces.</p>

  <p>However, just as the axes came slicing down, Connie twisted her body ever so slightly and smiled. She had slipped between the axes and was now floating between Alvin's arms. Reaching out her arm, she lightly brushed her knuckles on Alvin's chest and giggled. There was a look of contempt in her eyes. If she had been holding a dagger, Alvin would have been dead by now.</p>

  <p>Although Connie's smile was pretty and her laughter sounded pleasant, they only served to grate Alvin's nerves even more. He knew this woman was a powerful character, and now that she teased him while being so close to him, it became clear that she didn't take him seriously.</p>

  <p>Alvin was furious. He held on to Connie tightly. If he could grab this woman, he'd be able to crush her with brute force.</p>

  <p>But Connie was slippery like a fish and she slithered out of Alvin's arms.</p>

  <p>She distanced herself from him and gently clapped her hands.</p>

  <p>Alvin's heart sank, finally noticing the black beads that surrounded him.</p>

  <p>They were lined like an array, and when Connie clapped her hands...</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>The black beads exploded and blinding black light burst out, enveloping Alvin completely.</p>

  <p>Almost all of Connie's weapons could only be used once. The beads she had used just now were Black Flame Beads. The flames the beads produced were extremely destructive and released a strong cataclysmic power in the air.</p>

  <p>After a while when the flames dissipated, two charred objects fell from the sky. It turned out that they were the two axes that Alvin wielded.</p>

  <p>They were completely deformed and almost unrecognizable, their golden luster nowhere to be seen. As for Alvin, he had been completely annihilated by the black flames.</p>

  <p>"This is boring... Is there anyone else who'd like to challenge me?"</p>

  <p>Connie asked.</p>

  <p>She looked around the hill once, and she could sense that there were still many martial artists with powerful auras, but they all remained silent. It seemed like no one would dare challenge her today. Maybe she should just leave with Maha...</p>

  <p>These powerful martial artists weren't afraid of Connie, per se.</p>

  <p>It was just that this woman had countless single-use treasures with her that were extremely powerful which would make it very difficult to defeat her. Moreover, all of them thought highly of themselves. They came to the Sunflower Water World with the goal of challenging Maha.</p>

  <p>Anyone else wasn't worth attention.</p>

  <p>"Forget about Maha! No one in our Evolutionary Universe can even take down a Sacred girl!"</p>

  <p>"Aren't there at least ten martial artists who had been defeated by this girl?"</p>

  <p>"She has never failed once!"</p>

  <p>The warriors of Iron Moon City chatted. Some of them were even drunk and sad enough to recite poems.</p>

  <p>Just then, as Connie turned to leave, a person climbed up the hill.</p>

  <p>He was dressed in black, his body wrapped in a thick robe, and only a pair of gleaming eyes could be seen from the cracks. As the martial artist reached the top of the hill, he asked, "If I defeat you, can I challenge Maha myself?"</p>

  <p>Maha was just too infamous. He only accepted challenges from three warriors every day and now, they all had to line up to challenge him.</p>

  <p>Hearing the man's question, Connie looked back with an expression of interest. She clucked her tongue. "Actually, it doesn't work that way."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" The man asked coldly.</p>

  <p>Connie offered him a coy smile. "If you defeat me, Maha will avenge me. In that case, it'll be him who will challenge you first!"</p>

  <p>"That's good!"</p>

  <p>The man's goal was Maha, and he had no interest in the silly word games this Connie was playing. With a shake of his arm, the robe that covered his physique ripped and flew from his body. Finally, his true appearance was revealed!</p>

  <p>It was a young man. Under his perfectly arched brows, his eyes shone like stars. His gait exuded confidence and as he reached out his arm, a long fiery red spear appeared in his hand.</p>

  <p>"That's... Nathan!"</p>

  <p>"I knew the Godly Geniuses of our human race would show up!"</p>

  <p>"That Nathan is only second to Zheng and Tianming! Before Zheng appeared, he was the first-ranked Godly Genius!"</p>

  <p>"When a genius like him grows, it would be beyond our imaginations how strong he would become. His strength had improved tremendously after he became a world lord, and now, he's only going to be more powerful!"</p>

  <p>When the Godly Geniuses hadn't showed up, countless warriors in the Evolutionary Universe felt very disappointed.</p>

  <p>As the saying went, "a brave martial artist always wins the fiercest competition." Many warriors understood that losing was not a scary thing. What was scary was being afraid before the fight. The successive defeats of the human warriors had greatly affected the morale of the warriors in the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>They didn't expect that the Zheng that they had always hoped to come would be no-show. Instead, Nathan was here!</p>

  <p>Cheers broke out in the pavilions of the Iron Moon City. Victory was finally on its way! Even some of the heavily drunk martial artists were jolted awake.</p>

  <p>"Nathan?"</p>

  <p>The corners of Connie's mouth curled up, her eyes gleaming with interest.</p>

  <p>She knew the ten Godly Geniuses very well. In fact, back when Zheng had returned from the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, she had immediately recognized him.</p>

  <p>And from what she knew, this Nathan's origins were not that simple.</p>
