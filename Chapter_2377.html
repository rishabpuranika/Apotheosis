<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2377 Facing The Holy Beings </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's activation of the jade seal's ability made Nicholas frown.</p>

  <p>There was a look of helplessness in his eyes, and his figure once again turned into a shadow to prevent himself from getting devoured by time.</p>

  <p>"It's really true! This brat has erased a period of time!"</p>

  <p>"This is the ability of the jade seal."</p>

  <p>"I was able to sense it just now. There is a nine-second difference between my universe and the divine land. Has the jade seal reached its limit? It's already so intimidating!"</p>

  <p>The flow of time in the universe was way faster than in the divine land, but it was still easy to calculate just how much time was devoured.</p>

  <p>Knowing such things was easy for Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>These Holy Beings all gazed at Luo Zheng with passion burning in their eyes.</p>

  <p>Despite the awesome effects in Luo Zheng's hands, the jade seal had yet to reveal its true power. At the hands of a Holy Being, its true potential could be further unfolded.</p>

  <p>In nine seconds, the wielder of the jade seal would be invincible. A Holy Being who could obtain it would no doubt be able to do many glorious things. It was the kind of treasure that grew more powerful depending on its wielder.</p>

  <p>Moreover, this was not the jade seal's limit!</p>

  <p>There was unwillingness deep within Samuel's heart as he looked at the jade seal longingly. It was such a supreme treasure of belief that there was no way he would be willing to give it to Nicholas.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, he had no choice but to endure since he couldn't hold a candle to Nicholas.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng and Nelly were both getting chased by countless Time Ghosts.</p>

  <p>They ran at full-speed for about half a minute before finally emerging out of the Time Sea Forbidden Land's main road and walking towards the road created by the Water Luminous Star.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>The Time Ghosts did not rush into the road and merely circled around the entrance.</p>

  <p>Both warriors did not pay their pursuers any mind and continued to run, not stopping until they found a safe place.</p>

  <p>After circling around for a while, the Time Ghosts eventually dispersed.</p>

  <p>Noticing this, Luo Zheng carefully made his way back and found the Golden Beast Statue that had been cut into pieces by the creatures. He picked the pieces up and merged them into one piece before going back towards the exit.</p>

  <p>The two of them walked towards the exit of the Water Luminous Star.</p>

  <p>Breathing deeply, Nelly took a good long look at Luo Zheng. "Good luck." She then walked forward and headed towards the exit.</p>

  <p>The moment she left the Time Sea Forbidden Land, Nelly immediately felt the aura of multiple Holy Beings being exerted on her body.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, since she was the daughter of a Holy Being, she was used to the presence and remained calm. With her head held high, Nelly managed to walk towards the place where the True Gods of the Mu Clan gathered.</p>

  <p>"Hey, Nelly! Why didn't Rachelle come out with you? Why did you leave the jade seal with Tianxing?" Clark asked since he was the most anxious one out of everyone present.</p>

  <p>Nelly looked at Clark and answered him truthfully, "Tianxing willingly let me go."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by that?" Fire burned in Clark's eyes as if he could see right through her.</p>

  <p>Any other ordinary True God would've faltered under his gaze, but Nelly was different. Instead of panicking, she smiled at Clark. "Since Tianxing controls the jade seal, that means he also controls everyone's life. It's not up to me if I live or die. As for why he let go of me, maybe he did so because I'm pretty. I can't be too sure."</p>

  <p>Her words had a bit of a joking tone, but they signaled something much more serious about the situation. Based on what she had just said, Nelly just told all Holy Beings present that the lives of all the consummate True Gods in the jade seal were now under Luo Zheng's control.</p>

  <p>Because of this, the Holy Beings would now surely hold back for the sake of their clans' consummate True Gods. There might be a chance for Luo Zheng to survive.</p>

  <p>Clark snorted rudely. "Humph! The girls of Mu Clan are all very glib.</p>

  <p>You are just like your elder sister."</p>

  <p>Nelly simply smiled and bowed to him. "Thank you for your praise, Holy Clark!"</p>

  <p>With that, Nelly then joined the True Gods of the Mu Clan.</p>

  <p>When she turned, she trained her eyes onto the exit. The Water Luminous Star in the center of the nine towers rippled with waves before Luo Zheng also came out of the passageway.</p>

  <p>All eyes were immediately on him.</p>

  <p>The True Gods were neutral, but the Holy Beings radiated formidable power in their gazes.</p>

  <p>Had it been in the universe, then a mountain range, stretching for thousands and thousands of miles, would've already crumbled, the stars in the sky would've already shattered, and an ordinary low-rank True God would've been beaten to a bloody pulp under the stare of these Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>When such great force was thrown at Luo Zheng, his body immediately felt sluggish.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, his strength was on par with a consummate True God and he was still protected by his Redemption Armor. The powerful gazes of the Holy Beings did not do as much harm to him as they would've normally done.</p>

  <p>The Nine Divine Stars in his inner world revolved slightly and he was able to advance for a few steps against the pressure.</p>

  <p>"Hey! Where is Walton? Release him! Otherwise, I will kill you, extract your soul, and burn it with fire!" Clark declared with a dark look at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Nelly had warned them earlier that Luo Zheng controlled the lives of all consummate True Gods within the jade seal, and yet here was Clark causing a scene. He couldn't be blamed though. His temper had never been good, and he was also fiercely protective of Walton since he was his best son.</p>

  <p>Clark sat on his wide flame throne, and his eyes burned ever hotter in fury.</p>

  <p>Even a low-rank True God wouldn't be able to resist such raging power.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, however, remained unmoved. The burn was nothing to him.</p>

  <p>His gaze drifted from Clark to Nelly, who nodded slightly at him.</p>

  <p>He knew that she deliberately misled the Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you're talking about, Holy Clark," Luo Zheng told him calmly. There was no trace of fear in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Such arrogance! Don't you play dumb with me! Are you asking for your death?!" The enraged Holy Being slammed his hand onto his flame throne, making flames rise ever so higher.</p>

  <p>These flames were extremely hot and could spread out and burn the entire island if Clark willed it to.</p>

  <p>"Don't be so impatient, Clark," Jeremiah chided next to him.</p>

  <p>As soon as he said this, an invisible chill swept through Clark's burning body.</p>

  <p>Everyone felt a puff of cool air offset the heat Clark initially radiated.</p>

  <p>The flames on the flame throne quickly waned, completely doused by Jeremiah's chill.</p>

  <p>"Clark, you are a guest here in the Astronomical Transit Day celebration.</p>

  <p>You cannot make any sudden moves here!" the head of the Sun Blind race warned.</p>

  <p>"Humph!"</p>

  <p>Clark merely snorted in contempt before keeping silent.</p>

  <p>It was then that Nicholas finally opened his mouth.</p>

  <p>Compared to Clark's fiery personality, Nicholas was much more amiable.</p>

  <p>Instead of berating Luo Zheng, Nicholas smiled at him. He was like a refreshing spring breeze as compared to Clark's suffocating fury.</p>

  <p>"Your surname is Luo?" Nicholas asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Luo Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>"Are you Mike's son?" Nicholas asked again.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Luo Zheng answered truthfully.</p>

  <p>Back in the Time Sea Forbidden Land, Rachelle had been almost certain of his identity.</p>

  <p>He could stir up trouble among the consummate True Gods, but there was no way he could deceive the Holy Beings. Luo Zheng saw it fit to just admit who he was instead of lying.</p>

  <p>Joy sighed. 'He is very forthright, so much like his father. Although I want to take you away, I don't think I'll be able to in front of all of these Holy Beings.'</p>

  <p>She had initially made her mind up to take Luo Zheng away.</p>

  <p>After becoming a consummate True God, one would be able to use the Grand Teleportation.</p>

  <p>However, the distance consummate True Gods would be able to cover wasn't very far.</p>

  <p>Demi-holy Beings and Holy Beings were different. They could cross great distances using the Grand Teleportation. Had she been given the chance, Joy would've used her abilities to take Luo Zheng away.</p>

  <p>But would Nicholas ever give her the chance?</p>
