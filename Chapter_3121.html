</p>

  <p>Zheng felt embarrassed and didn't know how to respond to Athemar's question.</p>

  <p>No one in the divine land had ever told him the reason.</p>

  <p>Timotheus had left the Source World long ago, so he was also clueless.</p>

  <p>When Leopold and Lorena left the Source World, their cultivation levels were still low, so neither of them knew why.</p>

  <p>Chiyou also didn't mention anything about the fight when Zheng met him.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I don't really know," Zheng replied frankly, cheeks still slightly burning out of embarrassment.</p>

  <p>Athemar glanced at Zheng, then he nodded and said, "It's understandable.</p>

  <p>Your cultivation level was still too low at that time, so it was kind of meaningless to tell you about it anyway. It is hard to explain things about the Other Shore if you haven't reached it."</p>

  <p>"Why on earth did they fight?" Zheng asked, his eyes gleaming with obvious curiosity.</p>

  <p>"To survive," Athemar sighed exasperatedly.</p>

  <p>Zheng pursed his lips, and quietly glared at Athemar.</p>

  <p>Then he asked, "Have you heard of the Book of Changes?"</p>

  <p>Zheng shook his head, and his curiosity was back again.</p>

  <p>Athemar continued, "The Great Ultimate generates two complementary forces, then those two complementary forces generate other four aggregates. Those four aggregates then generate the Eight Diagrams; lastly, the Eight Diagrams determine myriads of phenomena. What would it generate if it went on this way?"</p>

  <p>"What would it generate?" Zheng asked, confused by the cycle.</p>

  <p>"The great rivers and mountains of the Mountain Viewing Province, the Source World and even the chaos came into being," Athemar answered as he stretched out his hands.</p>

  <p>The chaos could turn into anything and everything.</p>

  <p>There was no need for Athemar to explain further. That was exactly how Zheng's inner world had been created.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded with apprehension and said, "Got it."</p>

  <p>"No, you don't understand," Athemar said with a sly smile. "Have you ever thought about what will happen after endless generation?"</p>

  <p>Zheng was a little stunned, his brows furrowed. He had never thought about this.</p>

  <p>Athemar stretched out his arm. Then he moved his hand in the air like he was grabbing something. A huge stone flew fast towards him. When he grabbed hold of it, he slightly tightened his grip on the stone.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The stone was instantly covered with cracks and fissures. A few short moments later, it had turned into countless fragments.</p>

  <p>"This stone was a complete form, but it was easily broken by my power. We can't restore it," said Athemar.</p>

  <p>"It's possible to restore it," Zheng said adamantly.</p>

  <p>He could think of a way to piece the fragments together to get it back to its previous form, but he wouldn't waste his time on it.</p>

  <p>Athemar had known Zheng would say that, given his personality. Athemar continued, "But it will need more time or energy to repair it."</p>

  <p>"What do you want to say?" Zheng asked. He was getting more and more confused now.</p>

  <p>Athemar started explaining, "This stone was broken down from a whole into many fragments, and became even more disorderly, right?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Zheng agreed.</p>

  <p>"Such kind of thing has happened continuously in the whole world. After the chaos was split, new creatures were born. They started to give birth to more descendants, and the descendants built houses and expanded their own territories. After countless years, the Source World became what it is now,"</p>

  <p>Athemar said solemnly.</p>

  <p>Myriads of races were fighting and killing each other in the Source World for survival and territory.</p>

  <p>"The world used to be so orderly, but now it's chaotic," Athemar remarked.</p>

  <p>Zheng raised his eyebrows and tried to follow Athemar's train of thoughts to understand what he meant.</p>

  <p>The feud between the Nine Li race and the Bearing race definitely had nothing to do with this.</p>

  <p>Although Athemar had perceived Zheng's impatience, he continued his narrative, "Have you ever thought about what will happen after a long period of chaos?"</p>

  <p>"The Source World will become bigger?" Zheng tried to give it a guess.</p>

  <p>"The Source World can indeed expand, but the expansion is limited. When the chaos grows to a certain extent, there will be a needle that will stab it.</p>

  <p>Then with a bang, everything you know and have seen will no longer exist."</p>

  <p>At his words, Athemar made an exaggerated gesture to emphasize his point.</p>

  <p>Zheng blinked and then looked at Athemar with suspicion.</p>

  <p>He knew and understood what the other guy meant. The chaos would be destroyed if it expanded continuously.</p>

  <p>But the chaos was a myth. How did Athemar know that the chaos would explode? And he described it so vividly. He said a needle would puncture the chaos. The chaos was not a sort of ball. How could it be punctured by a needle? Zheng was just getting more confused.</p>

  <p>Just as he was about to speak out his doubt, Athemar changed the subject.</p>

  <p>"To prevent this kind of thing from happening, creatures of the Source World came up with some ideas. The Nine Li race and the Bearing race chose their own ways, and that was why they were at odds with each other."</p>

  <p>"Can you tell me what ways they chose?" Zheng asked, attention flicking back to his companion.</p>

  <p>"There are two ways. The first is to stop the needle from puncturing the chaos. The Nine Li race, the Pear Hill, and a considerable amount of the other races chose this way. This is what we call the Finale Way."</p>

  <p>Zheng blinked as a thought came into his mind.</p>

  <p>When Zheng first met Fuxi, he was puzzled when Fuxi mentioned the Finale Hero. Did the Finale Way that Athemar was talking about have anything to do with the Finale Hero?</p>

  <p>"What did the Bearing race choose?" Zheng asked. He was now paying full attention to Athemar's words.</p>

  <p>Athemar stretched out his hand and gently pinched the stone fragments scattered on the ground. The energy released from his fingertips swallowed the fragments bit by bit, and at last only a small fragment was left. "Only one fragment is left. It's clean. It's no longer messy, right?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"You mean..."</p>

  <p>"The Purge Way. It means wiping out all the other races," Athemar answered with a shrug.</p>

  <p>"Only humans are left? Can the Bearing race do it?" Zheng asked, probing.</p>

  <p>According to his observation after he entered the Source World, the human race did not dominate it.</p>

  <p>"Maybe even the existence of human race is needless. Even if the other races are killed, the human race will just reproduce and expand in every corner of the Source World. The chaotic life will last. The ideal situation is that only about ten thousand people live, so that the world will not be chaotic," Athemar said.</p>

  <p>It was a crazy and risky plan.</p>

  <p>"In other words, the Bearing race planned to kill all the creatures in the chaos, but the Nine Li race was eliminated in advance?" Zheng asked, perplexed by the new information.</p>

  <p>"The reasons for the feud between the two races are very complicated, but that is the main reason," Athemar replied with a nod.</p>

  <p>Zheng stared at Athemar and said with a baffled expression on his face, "The tragedy of the Nine Li race was caused not only by the Bearing race, but also by the Divine Farmer. Does this mean that the Divine Farmer chose the same way as the Yellow Thearch?"</p>

  <p>"You're right," Athemar agreed with Zheng's analogy. "It is impossible to fulfil such a great ambition with the Yellow Thearch alone. In addition to the Divine Farmer, there is someone more powerful behind him."</p>

  <p>Athemar had a faint sense of awe when he said this.</p>

  <p>Zheng could guess that Athemar was talking about a Chaos Ancient God.</p>

  <p>However, he always heard No. 9527's voice in his mind from time to time, so he didn't think a Chaos Ancient God was so mysterious.</p>

  <p>Athemar had been waiting for Zheng to ask about who the more powerful being was.</p>

  <p>But Zheng was silent for a long time, taking his time. Athemar could no longer help but ask, "Aren't you curious?"</p>
