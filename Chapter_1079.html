<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Hester danced gracefully like a nightingale, but how could Zheng be in the mood to appreciate it under such a strange atmosphere?</p>

  <p>Lord Randy was glaring down at Hester with a manic expression on his face. It was as though tormenting his wife was quite a pleasant way of venting his anger.</p>

  <p>So when the song was over, Zheng quickly stood up from his seat and found a possible excuse to leave.</p>

  <p>He was apparently not interested in how Lord Randy was to compete with the crown prince. What he only wanted was to follow the goals he had set for himself.</p>

  <p>He was already pleased that he had obtained some life stones from Lord Randy's manor, although the quantity was far from enough. Apart from that, he now had a clearer understanding of the Feather Holy Sea.</p>

  <p>And with him being more determined to enter the Feather Holy Sea, he wouldn't waste time while he was waiting for that to happen.</p>

  <p>Aside from his planned cultivation, he also wanted to purchase more life stones.</p>

  <p>Anyway, Crane City was the second-largest city in the Harlen Divine Kingdom. And within this city, the Jade Martial House was considered a perfect place for cultivation, which was comparable to a sixth-grade sect.</p>

  <p>There were no sects in the divine kingdoms, but there were many large clans instead. Back in the Central Region, third-grade clans were considered the strongest. And there had never been a fourth-grade clan.</p>

  <p>In the Crane City, however, there were quite a few fourth-grade large clans, and even several fifth-grade clans. The masters of those clans were generally at the fourth or even at the fifth level of the Life and Death Realm.</p>

  <p>Since Lord Randy's mansion possessed life stones, Zheng believed that he could get more of these stones from those large clans in the Crane City.</p>

  <p>If they were willing to exchange those stones with life vitality crystals, he wouldn't hesitate to make the deal.</p>

  <p>So once he was done with his daily cultivation, he spent all his spare time inquiring about the life stones.</p>

  <p>However, the result was quite disappointing.</p>

  <p>The life stones could replenish one's life energy, so they were an irresistible temptation for every warrior. They were a must-have for everyone. When they were fortunate to obtain it, most of these people would instantly consume their life stone, so there were rarely any reserves of these precious life stones.</p>

  <p>With the said scarcity, Zheng had to stop thinking about purchasing life stones. He could only wait for the exploration of the Feather Holy Sea.</p>

  <p>He had no final say on when he would go to that place because only the four divine kingdoms had the rights to allow warriors to enter the Feather Holy Sea.</p>

  <p>Half a month later, Lord Randy suddenly paid a visit to Zheng. Without even bothering to exchange pleasantries, he commanded directly, "Come and follow me! I'll introduce my teammates to you!"</p>

  <p>"Your teammates?" Zheng was curious.</p>

  <p>He didn't ask further and just followed Lord Randy straight to the Jade Martial House.</p>

  <p>The Jade Martial House occupied a wide area. There were countless pavilions and halls around the place. The other warriors they met as they passed by were very respectful when they saw Lord Randy. They all bowed and silently made way for him.</p>

  <p>Soon after, they finally arrived at a pavilion inside the martial house.</p>

  <p>There were two men and one woman waiting for them to come in. All of them were at the late stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm.</p>

  <p>Zheng casually glanced through them and sensed that they all had powerful strengths. So he assumed and considered them as divine-level talents.</p>

  <p>As soon as Lord Randy entered the pavilion, those three warriors simultaneously opened their eyes from their meditations. The woman sitting at one side was about twenty years old. Smiling sweetly, she addressed the Lord, "You're finally here, sweet little Randy!"</p>

  <p>"Sweet little Randy?" Zheng was taken aback. He couldn't understand why she called Lord Randy that.</p>

  <p>Lord Randy pretended to be angry as he said, "I've told you many times!</p>

  <p>Don't call me that!"</p>

  <p>"Our sweet little Randy looks even cuter when he gets angry!" The woman, however, wasn't alarmed at all. She still had the same smile on her face. It was self-evident that she had a lively personality.</p>

  <p>The other two men both admonished her, "Camilla, don't be so rude to Lord Randy!"</p>

  <p>Ignoring their advice, the girl called Camilla turned her gaze towards Zheng. Her round, beautiful eyes stopped at him as she asked, "Sweet little Randy, who is this guy?"</p>

  <p>Lord Randy smiled and patted Zheng's shoulder as he replied, "Let me introduce him to you. This is Tianxing. He will temporarily join us."</p>

  <p>He then faced Zheng, "Tianxing, they are all members of my team. They are Camilla, Renzo, and Barry. Then including both of us, we now form a team of five!"</p>

  <p>There was no specific limit to the number of people exploring the Feather Holy Sea. But after scouting it for so many years, the warriors from four divine kingdoms gradually optimized their team size.</p>

  <p>Based on previous experience, the best strategy to explore the Feather Holy Sea was to form small teams that were comprised of five warriors.</p>

  <p>And every year, each divine kingdom would send many teams of such size to tour the area.</p>

  <p>Both Lord Randy and the crown prince were secretly forming their own teams. However, compared to the crown prince, Lord Randy was obviously at a disadvantage, and it was quite a distinct one.</p>

  <p>Randy's talent and strength were probably on par with that of the crown prince. But his original three teammates were incomparable to Gregory and Edwin under the crown prince.</p>

  <p>That was the main reason why Randy wanted Zheng to join his team.</p>

  <p>"We form a team of five? With him? Randy, are you serious?" Camilla asked, her eyes staring at Zheng with disdain.</p>

  <p>Not only these three were all from the fifth-grade clans in the Crane City, but also they were all top-level members of their clans.</p>

  <p>Even though their strengths were inferior to that of Gregory, they still ranked top of the second-tier warriors of the Jade Martial House. After they were selected by Randy, they didn't even have to participate in the test. They also all secured Harlen tokens through his help.</p>

  <p>During this period, they usually gathered together to train their teamwork, preparing to set off for the Feather Holy Sea.</p>

  <p>But now, Randy suddenly brought a cultivator at the middle level of the Virtual Tribulation Realm to join them. They were all completely at a loss as to why he wanted to do so.</p>

  <p>There were many warriors at the late stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm in the Jade Martial House. Even if Randy wanted a stopgap or a stand-in, it should never be this guy in front of them.</p>

  <p>Hearing Camilla's words, Randy of course understood her meaning. It was clear that she looked down on Zheng's low cultivation base.</p>

  <p>"Tianxing, please do not take offense at it," Randy was afraid that Zheng would get angry.</p>

  <p>Camilla, on the other hand, rolled her eyes and pointed out, "What's there to be worried about? Being able to attract your attention and join us is already his fortune. But Randy, I still don't understand why you want to recruit such a burden."</p>

  <p>Randy smiled, "Tianxing is not a burden. If I am not mistaken, he might be the mainstay of our team!"</p>

  <p>Renzo's and Barry's expressions immediately changed as they glanced at each other when they heard Randy's words.</p>

  <p>Even though their characters weren't as lively as Camilla, they also had some pride in being able to work with Lord Randy. Due to their exceptional talents, they were always the one in a million.</p>

  <p>Zheng's cultivation base was only at the middle stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm. He was a nobody in their eyes.</p>

  <p>But since Randy was regarding him in such high praise, then it only meant that he was not so weak as he looked like. The mainstay of their team? Randy was always the one they regarded as the mainstay of their team. They pondered over Randy's words and wondered, 'Is it possible that this Tianxing is more powerful than Lord Randy?'</p>

  <p>Camilla scoffed as she looked at Zheng with a provocative gaze and grumbled, "I don't believe it! Sweet little Randy, you are making fun of us for nothing."</p>

  <p>"You really think so?" Randy knew that if Zheng didn't show his real strength, it would be difficult to convince them. "If you think I'm making fun of you, you can spar with Tianxing and get your answer!"</p>

  <p>As soon as Randy finished speaking, they all stared at Zheng with keen interest. It was apparent that they all wanted to challenge him.</p>

  <p>A trace of helplessness was revealed on Zheng's face. "There's no need for this, is there?"</p>

  <p>"You are not the one to decide!" As soon as Camilla let out those words, she suddenly charged at him as she extended her slender hand to slap him.</p>

  <p>The moment she moved, thousands of hands suddenly appeared in Zheng's eyes, and she was like the Thousand-hand Bodhisattva. In the blink of an eye, she had slapped over a thousand times, blocking all of his escape routes.</p>

  <p>"She is unreasonably fast!" Zheng's eyes beamed with surprise. He unexpectedly discovered that there was a special Law Power that had erupted from this woman's body. He had never seen this kind of Law Power before.</p>

  <p>"Time Law?"</p>

  <p>He knew that the two most powerful Laws in this universe were the Time Law and the Space Law.</p>

  <p>He had grasped and mastered the Space Law, but he had never seen anyone seizing the Time Law. He never expected that he would see it from this woman called Camilla.</p>

  <p>And it was all because of the effect of the Time Law that this woman was able to attack him so many times in a span of a blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>"Camilla! Lord Randy only allows you to spar with him! Don't hurt him severely!" The warrior called Renzo warned from the side.</p>

  <p>Knowing Camilla who habitually lacked a sense of propriety, Renzo was afraid that she might get blamed by Randy if she heavily injured Zheng, who was only at the middle stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm!</p>

  <p>Randy looked quite calm as if he wasn't worried about Zheng at all.</p>
