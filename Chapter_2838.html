  <p>
</p>

  <p>"He finally fulfilled his promise..."</p>

  <p>Lorena murmured with a wry smile. She had never expected to be in such a situation.</p>

  <p>Nicholas had refined almost everything, including himself...</p>

  <p>She blinked and floated over to the body.</p>

  <p>The moment Lorena's head touched the body, they were fused together.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>A faint light enveloped her and the body.</p>

  <p>As the light gradually dissipated, the color of the body changed.</p>

  <p>The original red clothes were bright and new!</p>

  <p>The exposed arms and legs were white and delicate and as smooth as jade.</p>

  <p>This body didn't merge with the True Demon Body as Nicholas had wished, but he already had refined too many things.</p>

  <p>He had refined the Holy Beings, Demi-holy Beings, Zheng's Shadow Bearing Sword, various kinds of treasures and eventually even himself.</p>

  <p>Lorena lifted her hands and studied them for a while. Then she held out her hands and a crimson light cone shot out from the tip of her slender fingers.</p>

  <p>"The Blood Body?" Lorena was astounded.</p>

  <p>This Blood Body was inherited from the Source World and she had not expected that Nicholas would refine and create it.</p>

  <p>She reckoned that it might be the Yellow Emperor Guards who had taught this method to Nicholas.</p>

  <p>But she was wrong. Nicholas had obtained the method to refine the Blood Body from the Sea of Truth and not from the Yellow Emperor Guards.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>With a flick of her finger, Lorena sent the crimson light cone towards the void in a dazzling momentum.</p>

  <p>"Congratulations, Mother," Zheng said with a smile.</p>

  <p>Although this Blood Body was not her mother's original body, it was a pretty good body. Judging from the light cone that his mother shot out, the Blood Body was extraordinary and very powerful.</p>

  <p>Lorena nodded. Her gaze once again fell on the pyramid in Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>"What is this? Why can it read people's memories?"</p>

  <p>Lorena had come across certain methods of reading peoples' memories. She knew that there were some experts in the Source World who could secretly read memories.</p>

  <p>Now Nicholas didn't exist anymore, but the pyramid could allow her to read his memory. She thought it was miraculous!</p>

  <p>"This is the Reincarnation Soul Weapon. It should be controlled by our Nine Li race," Zheng replied. "Those who have pure Nine Li blood can awaken the Memory Flames of all the people of Nine Li race."</p>

  <p>"What?" Lorena was surprised to learn this.</p>

  <p>Rosie, too, was shocked.</p>

  <p>They had been staying in the divine land, but Chiyou had built this ship and did not reveal this magic to his descendants.</p>

  <p>The divine land was the last hope of the Nine Li race. Chiyou's ultimate goal was that the Nine Li race would not get exterminated, and he also hoped that there would be a miracle in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Chiyou arranged the divine land as a deserted land to let his descendants stay in a relatively cruel environment, cultivate and grow...</p>

  <p>If it weren't for the Yellow Emperor Guards, the numerous people in the divine land would all be members of the Nine Li race. There would also be disputes, power division and life-and-death struggles.</p>

  <p>However, during the competition, there were still some super talents appearing from generation to generation.</p>

  <p>It was a pity that the Nine Li race had been destroyed by the Yellow Emperor Guards. Chiyou had hidden many secrets in the divine land and left treasures for the Nine Li race to discover. But many of them had not yet been discovered.</p>

  <p>For example, the Reincarnation Soul Weapon was one of the treasures. If one controlled it, it would be equivalent to taking control of the reincarnation. This meant that one would control everyone's fate in the divine land.</p>

  <p>This treasure had the power to decide whether people died forever or could be reborn.</p>

  <p>It was a really incredible ability.</p>

  <p>"But if I want to take full control of the Reincarnation Soul Weapon, it needs the pure blood of the Nine Li race," Zheng explained. "So, I have to hand this treasure over to you."</p>

  <p>"Why?" Lorena felt confused. She didn't think there would be anything wrong with Zheng's blood.</p>

  <p>Zheng shrugged and said casually, "My blood is not pure enough."</p>

  <p>"Why is that?"</p>

  <p>Lorena stared at Zheng in surprise. Zheng had told her some secrets to clear up some of her confusion. But she still had so many questions to ask him.</p>

  <p>Back then, she had thrown him out of the divine land in order to save his life.</p>

  <p>So how did Zheng manage to return?</p>

  <p>And why did he get involved in the Abyss Demon Region?</p>

  <p>It was not easy to pollute the pure blood of the Nine Li race. So how did Zheng's blood become impure?</p>

  <p>"It's a long story..." Zheng narrated everything that had happened after he had been thrown out of the divine land, including the episode with Timotheus, Emily and the others in detail.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, on the top of the divine land, an overwhelming amount of power was erupting from the space whirlpool.</p>

  <p>Just one tenth of that power would be enough to instantly kill a Holy Being.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>After a while, Emily jumped out of the space whirlpool looking exhausted.</p>

  <p>She spoke through her life vitality, "It's your turn."</p>

  <p>Right on cue, another Other Shore Realm warrior of the Snake Goddess race jumped into the whirlpool.</p>

  <p>The space barrier outside the divine land was designed well. Even if they destroyed a part of the space barrier, it would slowly heal after a period of time like a beast's wound.</p>

  <p>Therefore, it was important to constantly attack the space barrier. The Other Shore Realm warriors present took turns in attacking it, all day and night.</p>

  <p>As soon as Emily landed on the ground, she felt a vibration under her feet.</p>

  <p>Rumble!</p>

  <p>The vibration was extremely loud, as if something was collapsing.</p>

  <p>Not far away, Ramzi knelt down and pressed his ear to the ground. After a while, he said, "It seems that a collapse takes place in a huge space."</p>

  <p>"Huge space..." Emily's eyes flashed. "Is this a universe that Zheng had mentioned?"</p>

  <p>Zheng had revealed the divine land's internal structure once. It was not difficult for the Other Shore Realm warriors to understand that. The methods of building a universe and keeping Holy Beings immortal were also spread in the Source World.</p>

  <p>"It might be a so-called Holy Being dying," Leopold said with a faint smile, looking disdainful.</p>

  <p>After all, in their eyes, Holy Beings were only at the True God Realm, and they were simply not qualified to become their opponents.</p>

  <p>As the Other Shore Realm warriors dissected it, heated discussions broke out on all Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>A muffled voice rang out from the sky and resounded through almost all of the regions in the divine land.</p>

  <p>The Floating Islands were in the middle of the divine land, and people there could hear the explosion very clearly.</p>

  <p>"A Holy Being's universe has collapsed!"</p>

  <p>"Oh my God! Which Holy Being was so unlucky? There is no war taking place in the universe, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Someone was actually able to cut off a Holy Being's connection with the universe? This has only happened once a few years ago."</p>

  <p>At that time, Lorena had killed a few Holy Beings by using the Lethal Fire Magma. So what happened today reminded people in the powerful clans on the Floating Islands of that same event.</p>
