<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The other emperors had originally intended to stop War Emperor York, but none of them expected Zheng's counterattack could actually send him flying while bleeding out of his mouth.</p>

  <p>In the previous battle, Luo Zheng had relied solely on his own strength to wreck Logan's space armor. It was known to everyone that Luo Zheng had the strength that was more powerful than that of ordinary martial artists. However, they didn't have it in prospect that his abilities could stretch out even further. His strength was impeccable.</p>

  <p>Silence had reigned at the scene once again. How enormous was the difference between a warrior at the Virtual Tribulation Realm and a powerful master at the Soul Sea Realm? It was beyond imagination. A warrior at the Virtual Tribulation Realm had managed to scathe a powerful master at the Soul Sea Realm. It was quite hard to grasp.</p>

  <p>Even the old freaks who had lived for tens of thousands of years had never heard of such a thing.</p>

  <p>The higher one's cultivation was, the deeper insight one had regarding laws and strength, but it had made it more difficult for the cultivator to challenge warriors at higher levels.</p>

  <p>For a nature creature to challenge a warrior at the Illuminating Soul Realm, it wasn't such a difficult task for many divine-level talents. If a warrior at the Virtual Tribulation Realm challenged a master at the Life and Death Realm, it was believed to be difficult. But for a master at the Life and Death Realm to challenge a mighty warrior at the Soul Sea Realm, it was something impossible.</p>

  <p>However, the mighty warriors at the Soul Sea Realm present at the scene knew War Emperor York's strength all too well. He had been too careless and even underestimated his opponent's abilities. Because Luo Zheng was only at the middle stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm, he didn't bother activating his life vitality to protect himself, nor had he employed the power of his domain.</p>

  <p>If War Emperor York had opened up his domain and used it to his advantage, then Luo Zheng couldn't have been able to fight back. That was his biggest mistake.</p>

  <p>It was pride most likely. A mighty warrior at the Soul Sea Realm who activated his domain just to deal with a warrior at the Virtual Tribulation Realm? If such a thing spread out, his reputation could be stained. It was to be considered ludicrous, a sign of weakness!</p>

  <p>To add, War Emperor York was sent flying several hundred feet away.</p>

  <p>His eyes glinted with a strong intent to murder. If that gaze of his could kill, then Luo Zheng could've already died a thousand times.</p>

  <p>The punch that Luo Zheng launched towards him was so strong that he started to bleed. Wiping the blood from the corner of his mouth with one hand, he felt humiliated. It was witnessed by so many people, including the divine-level talents and princes of the York Divine Kingdom.</p>

  <p>"Although you're only at the Virtual Tribulation Realm, the strength that you have is enough to become my opponent," War Emperor York coldly said, the previous murderous expression on his face now replaced with a strong sense of fighting spirit.</p>

  <p>As he reached the Soul Sea Realm, his warrior spirit had been thoroughly baptized through numerous battles. He knew the ropes of that life, as it was the only life he knew. He had full control of his state of mind and kept it in check at all times. War Emperor York handled his emotions quite well.</p>

  <p>At that particular moment, he no longer belittled Luo Zheng. After all, no matter how much he looked down on the guy, it was undeniable that he had managed to injure him. Thus, War Emperor York did the honorable thing of acknowledging Zheng's strength. Even if he was only at the Virtual Tribulation Realm, War Emperor York regarded him as an important opponent.</p>

  <p>"Fighting with a mighty warrior of the Soul Sea Realm can be a precious experience for you. Let me show you my domain!"</p>

  <p>War Emperor York said, with a small smile playing on his lips. Then, white threads began to float in the air around him. Those threads began to intertwine with one another, forming small cocoons.</p>

  <p>"Cloud Thread Domain!"</p>

  <p>A mighty warrior of the Soul Sea Realm could set his own rules within a limited range, but the warrior could never ignore all the earthly and heavenly rules.</p>

  <p>Once a warrior reached the Soul Sea Realm, his strength could develop in two different directions. The warrior could make his own rules. The better the warrior could control his domain, the stronger the power of his domain could become. The other choice for the warrior was to follow the heavenly and earthly rules, which meant to comprehend rules at higher levels in both the heavens and earth.</p>

  <p>The situation in which one was able to control one's domain according to one's own rules was called "defiance of the natural laws", while the situation in which the warrior grasped the rules at the higher levels in the heavens and earth was called "compliance of the natural laws".</p>

  <p>In the Upper World, there were martial artists that defied the laws of nature. They abandoned all the rules of the heavens and earth and focused on arranging their own domains and creating new rules instead.</p>

  <p>At the same time, they excluded all other rules of the heavens and earth.</p>

  <p>However, it was extremely difficult for a martial artist to completely do so.</p>

  <p>As for the martial artists who chose to follow the laws of nature, they were to give up on developing their domains and wholeheartedly learn to comprehend seven, eight, and even nine layers of the Original Law, but the higher layers of Law Power were usually unfathomable and thus more difficult to comprehend.</p>

  <p>Whether it was to defy or follow the laws of nature, they were both approaches for warriors to become more powerful. However, the vast majority of martial artists practiced both at the same time.</p>

  <p>Since War Emperor York had finally brought out his domain, it only meant that he was more determined to kill Luo Zheng than ever. No matter what Zheng's capabilities were, it would all be useless if he were to be enclosed in War Emperor York's domain.</p>

  <p>Zheng's face darkened. Although he had merged with the will of the great world, it didn't necessarily mean that he was invincible. The domain of a powerful master at the Soul Sea Realm was enough to cut off his connection with this great world. 'Am I going to die this time?' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>At that very moment, Turner appeared right in front of Luo Zheng. He then turned to War Emperor York and said, "Lucien, why are you so eager to kill such a young kid?"</p>

  <p>Because Luo Zheng had inherited the talent of the little monster, War King Wind and Scott also stepped forward. Unlike Turner, they didn't stand before Luo Zheng. Instead, they spoke for Turner.</p>

  <p>"Lucien, Tianxing didn't do anything wrong. Why must you go for the kill?''</p>

  <p>"You mentioned earlier that after the little monster broke through, his innate talent could help us break through as well. It is true that the little monster's soul was destroyed by Tianxing and he now amounts to nothing.</p>

  <p>But since he has inherited the little monster's talent, isn't Tianxing our only hope to break through now?"</p>

  <p>Thanks to the little monster, the York Divine Kingdom had gained countless benefits over the years. The powerful warriors of the Soul Sea Realm had been impatiently waiting for the little monster to break through to the Life and Death Realm. He was dead for sure, but Luo Zheng had somehow managed to obtain his talent.</p>

  <p>For War Emperor York, that was an unacceptable circumstance. To the other powerful warriors of the Soul Sea Realm, it didn't matter where the person was from as long as they got the help they needed to break through. Perhaps that Tianxing was more reliable than the little monster.</p>

  <p>What War King Wind and Scott said echoed in the thoughts of the other powerful masters at the Soul Sea Realm as they all nodded their heads in what seemed to be an agreement.</p>

  <p>The expression on War Emperor York's face changed. He looked at Turner who stood in his way and said, "Those who get in my way shall die!"</p>

  <p>Seeing that War Emperor York was persistent and didn't plan on backing down, Turner was enraged. He had always been a yes-man among many of the powerful warriors of the Soul Sea Realm. He was amiable and wasn't one to do something rashly.</p>

  <p>Back in the day, Turner had tolerated War Emperor York for countless times. Now that he stood in front of Luo Zheng, he had no other intentions but to protect him. It surprised him how War Emperor York still spoke to him so insolently.</p>

  <p>"Die? Lucien, should we have a fight just to see who dies first?"</p>

  <p>Turner's eyes flickered as he began to give off a powerful Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>Both Turner and Lucien were on the same level in regard to cultivation.</p>

  <p>They were all at the peak of the Soul Sea Realm. Due to their confinement to the Lower World, there was no way for them to cross that level. But in terms of power, Turner had lived for more than ten thousand years and was more than five thousand years older than Lucien.</p>

  <p>As long as Turner hadn't yet entered the Five Aging Processes, Lucien couldn't just easily defeat him.</p>

  <p>"Is this for real? The powerful warriors at the Soul Sea Realm are going to fight?"</p>

  <p>"From the very moment I was born, I have never seen a battle between two mighty warriors of the Soul Sea Realm. Wouldn't the heavens and the earth be destroyed if all their powers are released for battle?"</p>

  <p>"Idiot! If the Harlen Divine Kingdom really does fight against the York Divine Kingdom then it can provoke a war of the divine kingdoms.</p>

  <p>Everyone will suffer! Maybe one day you'll become nothing but cannon fodder!"</p>

  <p>Seeing such a scene, many of the warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm wondered if the two powerful warriors of the Soul Sea Realm would really begin to fight. Were they to run away to avoid getting hurt?</p>

  <p>Turner's response got rid of War Emperor York's aggression and arrogance altogether.</p>

  <p>It was known that Turner was indeed a good-natured man. He didn't use his own strength to suppress others. However, in terms of strength, he was probably the strongest one among the four rulers present. His abilities were no less than those of the retired Soul Sea Realm masters who lived in seclusion.</p>

  <p>With the knowledge of Turner's powerful strength and his firm stand on the matter, Lucien didn't intend on making a move anymore.</p>

  <p>Coldly glancing at Lucien, Turner announced, "In that case, the warrior from our Harlen Divine Kingdom has won this battle!"</p>

  <p>Lucien glared at Luo Zheng. He was extremely displeased about the outcome of their duel. He snorted coldly and walked up to the stairs.</p>

  <p>Both War King Wind and Scott also took one last glance at Luo Zheng. War King Wind even gave him a kind smile as he returned to the stairs as well.</p>
