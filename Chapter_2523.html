<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"One must be a body refiner of a higher level in order to become a Wild God. Your body doesn't seem strong enough."</p>

  <p>Zelda had noticed that Zheng knew nothing about it. So Zheng decided to learn more by asking questions.</p>

  <p>A body refiner needed to have a strong body.</p>

  <p>And Zheng could become a body refiner only if he cultivated his body to what seemed at the moment to be a terrifying level.</p>

  <p>Even though Zelda exuded a strange power, her body wasn't strong enough.</p>

  <p>Zelda glanced gently at Zheng, obviously thinking that Zheng had asked a very stupid question.</p>

  <p>Luther smiled at this. He didn't know what kind of guy he had brought back with him. It looked like Zheng didn't belong to this world. What was more, he seemed to have minimal to no common sense when it came to worldly things.</p>

  <p>Fortunately for Zheng, Zelda was patient. She turned to him and said, "If you don't know anything about the Wild God, you can follow me."</p>

  <p>She then walked out of the thatched hut.</p>

  <p>Zheng followed her without hesitation.</p>

  <p>In the ground outside the thatched hut, Zelda turned at her waist to look at Zheng, smiled sweetly, and made to untie her clothes.</p>

  <p>"What?" Zheng was shocked, unable to understand what she wanted to do.</p>

  <p>To his surprise, she cast off her thick clothes to reveal a brown bodysuit that hugged her body and outlined her exquisite figure.</p>

  <p>The surface of this suit was lined rather strangely.</p>

  <p>She let out a strong breath.</p>

  <p>"Hooo..."</p>

  <p>The breath left a visible light in its wake that was pale yellow in color.</p>

  <p>Zheng still looked at Zelda, confused and wondering why she was doing this.</p>

  <p>Zheng could feel a primitive energy surging through Zelda, touching almost every part of her body.</p>

  <p>There were very few people in the divine land who could use power like this. Most of them used their life vitality on blades.</p>

  <p>For example, if Zheng used his strength source, his power wouldn't have spread all over his body like the way Zelda's power was flowing through her.</p>

  <p>And then, Zelda said, "Grow!"</p>

  <p>At this command, her body began to swell rapidly.</p>

  <p>Zelda was only about four feet tall, but she quickly outgrew Zheng.</p>

  <p>Eight feet!</p>

  <p>Ten feet!</p>

  <p>Fifty feet!</p>

  <p>One hundred feet!</p>

  <p>The girl who had previously looked weak had instantly turned into a hill, and was now looking down at Zheng.</p>

  <p>The force in her body turned violent, and her temperament changed almost instantly. She seemed to have turned into a beast from the depths of the savage land.</p>

  <p>"What is going on?" Zheng exclaimed, shocked.</p>

  <p>He had witnessed skills that changed the size of a person or thing in question. Some treasures or weapons could also do that.</p>

  <p>There were also a few special theurgies that could do this. Creatures with a special blood power could make their bodies swell in a short time.</p>

  <p>Zheng's body would become larger even when he poured the strength source into his body.</p>

  <p>But the method that Zelda had used was completely different from the other existing theurgies.</p>

  <p>As her body swelled, every part of her body became larger, and her aura grew stronger to fit her huge form.</p>

  <p>She had taken off her clothes because she knew that when she grew larger, her clothes would strain against her growing bulk and be ripped apart.</p>

  <p>The bodysuit she was wearing could expand along with her figure. It still clung to her.</p>

  <p>"This is the power of the Wild God," she said, looking down at Zheng.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Zelda's fist was bigger than Zheng's.</p>

  <p>But the changes that were taking over her body and the increase in her size seemed to be beautifully harmonious.</p>

  <p>Luther was accustomed to such scenes.</p>

  <p>Zelda was the one who took care of every single trouble that they faced.</p>

  <p>Zelda was the God of War and was responsible for guarding the tribe.</p>

  <p>Without her, the tribe would have long been destroyed.</p>

  <p>And since Zelda was so powerful, no one in the tribe could defeat her. It was also because of this that every time the tribe wanted to chase Luther away, Zelda would stop them.</p>

  <p>"Zelda, you can spar with him!" Luther chuckled.</p>

  <p>Zelda's eyes flashed at this.</p>

  <p>With her insight, she knew that Zheng's strength was something. After all, he was a True God.</p>

  <p>However, this was a world where most warriors cultivated to become Wild Gods, and cultivating to become a True God was just an auxiliary method.</p>

  <p>"We can have a try," Zheng said, smiling.</p>

  <p>Zelda nodded. "Be ready then. I'll attack you soon. Also, you need to be very careful. I have great strength," she reminded him.</p>

  <p>She then turned her body abruptly, causing a violent wind to sweep across the tribe's thatched huts.</p>

  <p>"Hooo..."</p>

  <p>Zelda's fist, which was about ten feet wide, came crashing down towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyebrows twitched as he saw her fist make its way towards him.</p>

  <p>Zelda wasn't kidding. Her strength had indeed increased multi-fold once she had turned into a giant!</p>

  <p>Zheng stood still, his arms curved in front of him to protect his body.</p>

  <p>The strength source in his body suddenly exploded with a bang.</p>

  <p>His fist had collided with Zelda's huge one!</p>

  <p>Zelda was of the opinion that people who focused on cultivating to become a True God were weak, which was why she had deliberately suppressed her own strength of the Wild God and only used about forty percent of it.</p>

  <p>The young man, Zheng, seemed to know nothing and his background seemed strange. But he had saved Luther and she thought that it would be inappropriate if she slammed him into pieces.</p>

  <p>But when their fists collided, she could feel an immense power radiating from this young man, the force of which seemed so irresistible!</p>

  <p>Once Zheng had blocked Zelda's fist, he suddenly pulled back his elbow.</p>

  <p>The strong force moved along his arm, and Zelda's huge body began to retreat.</p>

  <p>Every time she took a step backward, the ground shook and a muffled sound could be heard.</p>

  <p>Her body expanded in size to become dozens of times bigger, but she was still very agile. She took a few steps backwards before turning and steadying herself. She stared at Zheng's gleaming eyes and said, "You have such a strong power!"</p>

  <p>She was no longer looking down upon Zheng and had become even more cautious.</p>

  <p>This time, she unleashed ninety percent of her strength towards Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>The two collided again.</p>

  <p>Zheng stood still, the muscles on his arm bulging. He was blocking Zelda's punch with just one hand.</p>

  <p>Luther's eyes bulged at the sight of this.</p>

  <p>Zheng hadn't even turned into a Wild God! Nor did he have the power of a Wild God. But he was using his own strength to resist Zelda's all-out blow. And this was confusing the heavens out of Luther!</p>
