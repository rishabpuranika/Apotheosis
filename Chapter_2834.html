<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"How can you break my furnace without finding the array eye? This... this cannot happen! No!"</p>

  <p>At that moment, almost half of Nicholas' physical body had already been crystallized.</p>

  <p>His legs and the lower half of his torso had already been transformed into countless small yet incredibly spiky red crystals, rendering them useless.</p>

  <p>The only things that made him look human were his upper torso and head, but the crystals were fast approaching them too.</p>

  <p>Now that he had reached the last stage of refining, he definitely wouldn't allow Zheng and Tianming to break the furnace.</p>

  <p>"Keep shrinking! I don't think you can hold on!"</p>

  <p>Nicholas' rage-filled eyes widened as he activated the internal momentum of the Truth of Dark and Light Chaos to its limit.</p>

  <p>It seemed that he had put a fire in the furnace.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the Eight Diagrams above him as well as the huge whirlpool below him once again shrank greatly.</p>

  <p>The whole whirlpool was now only about three hundred feet wide!</p>

  <p>The Eight Diagrams, on the other hand, was now looking incredibly different from how it looked when the battle started, and it started to move downward.</p>

  <p>But as the whole Furnace of Dark and Light shrank, the power inside the Eight Diagrams was becoming greater than ever!</p>

  <p>Buzz... buzz... buzz...</p>

  <p>The killing power produced by the Dark and Light energies was transmitted to Zheng and Tianming respectively.</p>

  <p>The two warriors absorbed the strong power and transferred it to each other.</p>

  <p>A few moments later, they started condensing the red lotus flowers and ice flowers once again!</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the red lotus flowers and ice flowers they released were even assimilated to the Dark and Light energies, effectively being part of them.</p>

  <p>One could say that the two auras of the Eight Diagrams were actively resisting the forces exerted by Zheng and Tianming.</p>

  <p>'It can't go on like this! We need a better plan!' Zheng thought to himself, his mind racing to find a solution.</p>

  <p>Since the two girls were connected to each other, Tianming understood what Zheng was thinking.</p>

  <p>"But the Eight Diagrams doesn't have an array eye, Zheng. How will we be able to break it?" Tianming asked, also feeling a little anxious.</p>

  <p>Zheng did not answer back, but he continuously released the red lotus flowers, lost in thought as to what to do next.</p>

  <p>Bromley had also cultivated the Dark and Light energies.</p>

  <p>Zheng had come into contact with such energies on the True Path. During that time, all of the enemies he encountered were all formed by the Dark and Light energies.</p>

  <p>Because Bromley still hadn't finished cultivating the complete Truth of Dark and Light Chaos at that time, Hallet and Augustus were only able to master a part of it.</p>

  <p>What shocked Zheng the most was the Eight Diagrams Chart of Fuxi.</p>

  <p>The Eight Diagrams Chart had the ability to make any technique evolve quickly and perfectly. It also helped Zheng reach the consummation of the Emotion Closing Godly Way in a short period of time.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, there was a huge gap between this Eight Diagrams and the Eight Diagrams Chart of Fuxi.</p>

  <p>But what Zheng didn't know was that the Eight Diagrams and the Truth of Dark and Light Chaos were both created by Fuxi.</p>

  <p>For the longest time, the Eight Diagrams Chart had been considered as the most precious treasure that came from the ancient divine era.</p>

  <p>Although Nicholas was considered an incredible talent by many of his peers, he still had not been able to successfully reach the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>So while the furnace that he had sacrificed himself to create was powerful, it still had numerous fatal flaws.</p>

  <p>Powerful warriors such as Emily and Timotheus could identify these flaws at a single glance.</p>

  <p>'Eight Diagrams Chart... Eight Diagrams Chart... Eight Diagrams Chart...'</p>

  <p>Zheng chanted in his head as he tried to recall something.</p>

  <p>The infinity gave birth to the supreme ultimate which then turned into two modes.</p>

  <p>And those two modes represented the Dark and Light energies!</p>

  <p>The Dark and Light energies had the ability to turn into four different images, but it was difficult to make one thing contain the other.</p>

  <p>Currently, the two holes of the Eight Diagrams had the Dark and Light energies mixed with each other.</p>

  <p>It should be difficult for Nicholas to cultivate the Truth of Dark and Light Chaos to the perfect level right now!</p>

  <p>'There might be an opportunity there...' Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>"The two holes!" he suddenly shrieked out. Excitedly, he turned to Tianming and said, "Release the transformed energies into those two holes!"</p>

  <p>"What? Why? What are you planning to do?" Tianming asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"Just do what I say!" Zheng replied, his tone urgent.</p>

  <p>Tianming was taken aback by what was happening.</p>

  <p>'What is this guy thinking?' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>But now that they were pressed for time, Tianming had no choice but to follow Zheng without questioning him. 'As long as this works, I guess I really don't have to worry about anything at all!'</p>

  <p>Soon enough, his body started floating towards the dark energy.</p>

  <p>The people below saw that the Eight Diagrams started to rotate slowly and that the black and white colors were beginning to become integrated.</p>

  <p>Both Zheng and Tianming were also starting to rotate along with the Eight Diagrams. Zheng was on the white light energy's side, while Tianming was on the dark energy's side.</p>

  <p>After exerting incredible efforts, the two warriors soon found the two holes.</p>

  <p>"Here it is!"</p>

  <p>Zheng proclaimed as he went into the black hole. With a wave of his hand, numerous red lotus flowers spread into the hole!</p>

  <p>Scratch! Scratch! Scratch!</p>

  <p>The moment the red lotus flowers flooded into the black hole, they started to be absorbed by it.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Tianming was working on the other hole. He carefully released the ice flowers into the white hole, and just like the red lotuses inside the black hole, they were quickly absorbed.</p>

  <p>"This seems to be useless, Zheng!" Tianming shouted, visibly nervous.</p>

  <p>Zheng stared at the black hole in front of him and murmured, "The Eight Diagrams relies on these two holes in order to absorb energies and turn them into the Dark and Light energies. These two holes are the reasons why the balance of the Eight Diagrams is maintained."</p>

  <p>Something flashed in Zheng's mind. With eyes wide, he floated towards the other side of the Eight Diagrams.</p>

  <p>The Eight Diagrams was only a few hundred feet in size. Zheng adjusted his position and came to Tianming's side.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing here?" Tianming asked, completely confused by what was happening.</p>

  <p>"Let's put the energies inside this together," Zheng replied, visibly excited.</p>

  <p>"That way maybe we can break the balance!"</p>

  <p>"Do you know that for sure or are you guessing again?" Tianming asked again, skeptical about Zheng's plan.</p>

  <p>"I'm just guessing!" Zheng replied, nodding.</p>

  <p>And truly, this time around, Zheng was right.</p>

  <p>The Dark and Light energies were being converted in these two holes ceaselessly.</p>

  <p>Previously, everyone joined hands to attack and cracked the Eight Diagrams a bit. However, as the Eight Diagrams spun crazily, the power of their attacks was distributed between these two holes and then turned into the Dark and Light energies, becoming a part of the Eight Diagrams. Because of that, the crack or any damage that the Eight Diagrams sustained was quickly fixed.</p>

  <p>If they wanted to break the balance, they should only attack one point of the Eight Diagrams.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>Slowly, the red lotus flowers released by Zheng and the ice flowers released by Tianming rushed into the white hole.</p>

  <p>They were then transformed into Dark energies. Because of that, an imbalance was starting to occur: the Dark energies were more than the Light energies. "Finally!" Zheng shouted, noticing that his plan was working.</p>

  <p>From below, it seemed that the area of the white side on the Eight Diagrams was constantly decreasing, and the area of the black side was constantly increasing!</p>

  <p>"You two..."</p>

  <p>Nicholas looked confused and shocked.</p>

  <p>He had no idea how Zheng figured out the method to break the balance in such a short time.</p>

  <p>'His method is undoubtedly effective!' he thought in disbelief.</p>

  <p>After breaking the balance of the Furnace of Dark and Light, it became extremely difficult to control.</p>

  <p>The entire Eight Diagrams even started to deflect.</p>

  <p>"The Dark energies can turn into Light energies! Let me see how you can still break the balance!" shouted Nicholas.</p>

  <p>Now that he was at the last step of refining, how could he let them cause his failure?</p>

  <p>The superfluous Dark energies started to flow towards the white hole.</p>

  <p>Because of what was happening, in the eyes of Sword Chen and the others, the Eight Diagrams' shape was becoming more and more bizarre...</p>

  <p>What Nicholas did was not normal, but he had no choice— he had to do that. Unconventional as it might have been, in the end, the balance was maintained.</p>

  <p>But this time, Sword Chen had no strength to see what was happening above. The other Holy Beings also couldn't hold on any longer and they all fell into the center of the huge whirlpool. They were then absorbed by Nicholas and immediately turned into the red crystals.</p>

  <p>Now, only Sword Chen, Samuel, the woman, and Samuel's clone were left in the huge whirlpool.</p>

  <p>Apparently, Sword Chen had consumed almost all of his strength. Even if he tried his best to activate the Emotion Closing Godly Way, he would not be able to resist the increasing power from the Furnace of Dark and Light.</p>
