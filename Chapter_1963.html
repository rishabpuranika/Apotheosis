<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Maha's eyes narrowed as he stared at the fairy palace in front of him. He stood motionless for a long time and then, in a very cold tone he said,</p>

  <p>"I'll let my father take action."</p>

  <p>The Sacred race was a centralized society, and this was the only force in the Murphy Universe.</p>

  <p>The status of Supreme Lords wasn't equal. Rather, they were arranged like a pyramid. Maha's father was the strongest Supreme Lord in the Sacred race.</p>

  <p>In his mind, he was certain that there was something he could do about a mere space treasure.</p>

  <p>Just as he finished speaking though, a ripple of Space Law descended upon the fairy palace, causing it to fall downward.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the fairy palace had completely disappeared.</p>

  <p>Once again, Maha and his group found them stunned out of amazement.</p>

  <p>They looked at each other in dismay.</p>

  <p>One after the other, they began attempting all sorts of different techniques in order to search for the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>Despite their greatest efforts, there was simply no sign of the fairy palace. It was clear that it didn't matter how hard they tried.</p>

  <p>Maha had to come to terms with what was happening. His enraged roar rang out from the hillside, booming the Ultimate Immortal City.</p>

  <p>In the fairy palace, Luo Zheng held a Teleportation Token in his hand, and presented a faint smile on his face.</p>

  <p>The token of mountain and the Teleportation Token, combined together, allowed him to bring the fairy palace anywhere in the universe.</p>

  <p>That was when Luo Zheng brought the fairy palace into the space created by the Teleportation Token. In this space, he had the will to choose any supreme world to descend upon.</p>

  <p>Behind him, on the square in the fairy palace, stood a group of people.</p>

  <p>Their eager gazes were all turned in his direction.</p>

  <p>The last time Luo Zheng had returned to the great world, he had installed all his relatives from the Cloud Hall in the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>The universe was filled with a multitude of dangers. The fairy palace was most likely the safest place in the universe.</p>

  <p>More so, the fairy palace was completely under Zheng's control. It could be said that even if the universe collapsed, the fairy palace would still remain intact. As long as he didn't connect the fairy palace's projection to this place, no one else would even be able to find it.</p>

  <p>Amongst the crowd, Yudie's beautiful eyes were fixed on Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Over the past decade, she seldom had the chance to meet Luo Zheng. Every time they crossed paths, they'd have to part again soon. However, she never complained because she knew her husband carried a great destiny. Since she couldn't help her husband, she could only quietly wait in the fairy palace, but there was no one who could listen to the pain in her heart.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng..."</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie tiptoed lightly and rushed to Zheng's side in a flash. Her ice-cold hand touched Zheng's face, and her eyes were filled with love and boundless tenderness.</p>

  <p>Watching the scene, Imogen and the others felt gratified. At least Luo Zheng had returned safely.</p>

  <p>After returning to the fairy palace, Luo Zheng wasn't in a rush to join the Celestial Position race. Instead, he decided to stay there temporarily.</p>

  <p>After embracing Ning Yudie for a while, Luo Zheng asked softly, "Where's Geoffrey?"</p>

  <p>He hadn't seen his son in the square.</p>

  <p>Four years ago, when Luo Zheng met Geoffrey, he was only seven years old.</p>

  <p>Now, four years had passed, and Geoffrey had already turned eleven.</p>

  <p>At that time, Geoffrey had still been a young, careless kid. Luo Zheng wondered how he was doing now.</p>

  <p>As Ning Yudie heard Zheng's question, her face displayed a look of rebuke. Luo Zheng wasn't a qualified father, but she still couldn't bring herself to criticize her husband.</p>

  <p>"He's at the library," Ning Yudie replied with a smile.</p>

  <p>"The library?" Luo Zheng asked, astonished. Prior to leaving, he had given Ning Yudie the token for the library, so they could visit and leave freely.</p>

  <p>They had to hide in the fairy palace for a few years and it was impossible to forever keep them in the square. It was only natural that they'd get bored.</p>

  <p>Yudie's face and eyes twinkled with pride. "You'll see after you go to the library."</p>

  <p>At Yudie's reaction, Luo Zheng felt even more confused and curious. He turned on his heel and headed straight for the library.</p>

  <p>The moment he entered the library, he saw Geoffrey seated before a massive book. From the looks of it, he was currently contemplating the book's contents.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng was about to speak, Immortal Book beside him hurriedly made a gesture of silence. Ning Yudie also quickly extended two slender fingers and pressed them against Zheng's mouth.</p>

  <p>"Don't disturb him," Ning Yudie hastily said.</p>

  <p>Zheng's face was filled with astonishment. What had his son been doing over the past few years?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had spent little time with his son since he was born, and the first time they met four years ago, they had only been together for a few short months. This, of course, had no effect on how much he truly loved his son.</p>

  <p>Because both Immortal Book and Ning Yudie had stopped him from disturbing Geoffrey, Luo Zheng withheld his desire to say anything and waited instead.</p>

  <p>After a long while, Geoffrey exhaled slightly. He lifted his head and his eyes shot in Zheng's direction. His eyes flickered and a heroic look surfaced on his face.</p>

  <p>He smiled and greeted Luo Zheng, "Father, you're back!"</p>

  <p>Hearing Geoffrey call him father, Luo Zheng was moved with emotion. He had this weird feeling that his son had grown up overnight, and was overjoyed.</p>

  <p>Immortal Book also chuckled. "Geoffrey, did you learn anything today?"</p>

  <p>Geoffrey nodded. "From memory, I can now write down the contents of this book."</p>

  <p>Immortal Book appeared very satisfied with Geoffrey's statement. With a wave of his hand, a few pieces of paper floated toward Geoffrey. "Do it now. Otherwise, you'll forget about it later."</p>

  <p>Geoffrey smiled politely. "You clearly know that I am gifted with an extraordinary memory. I won't forget anything I see. I know you just want to test me."</p>

  <p>Immortal Book didn't blush, although he was caught red-handed in his lie. He laughed away the awkward atmosphere. "The palest ink is still better than the best of memory. This sort of thing has to be written down.</p>

  <p>After all, it involves so many subjects."</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng listened to the conversation between the two, the doubt in his mind increased, causing the features on his face to deepen. What was Geoffrey doing?</p>

  <p>He walked up and asked, "What does Geoffrey have to write?"</p>

  <p>Immortal Book glanced at Luo Zheng and exclaimed at once, "Your son is extraordinary!"</p>

  <p>"Extraordinary?"</p>

  <p>In Zheng's memories, Geoffrey did seem to have some talents for divine textures. Ever since his birth though, Luo Zheng had never imparted him any of the divine texture techniques.</p>

  <p>Why did Immortal Book say Geoffrey was extraordinary? Luo Zheng was completely unable to understand what was going on.</p>

  <p>Seeing Zheng's expression, Immortal Book asked faintly, "Luo Zheng, do you know the origin of the Grand Weapon Refining Method?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng hadn't been sure before, but after his trip to the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, he had discovered such for himself.</p>

  <p>"The Grand Weapon Refining Method should come from those who are referred to as extraordinary creatures," Luo Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>Immortal Book chuckled once again. "The concept of extraordinary creature was suggested by my master. The person who told you that is probably Holy Jay, right? Correct me if I'm wrong."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng just nodded.</p>

  <p>"Every golden Sanskrit word of the Grand Weapon Refining Method records a large amount of information. In addition to the Grand Weapon Refining Method, there are also several other cultivation techniques.</p>

  <p>However, my master failed to decipher all of them," Immortal Book said.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know," Luo Zheng nodded in agreement.</p>

  <p>Although the Grand Weapon Refining Method was still working on Zheng's body, Bromley, Holy Jay and Luo Zheng himself didn't know the meaning of the golden Sanskrit.</p>

  <p>They only knew several words.</p>

  <p>"For the past four years, Geoffrey has been staying in the library. With time, he has managed to decode nine golden Sanskrit words!" Immortal Book's face revealed pride. Pure pride. Geoffrey's interest in the Sanskrit words in the library was clearly directed and delegated by him.</p>

  <p>At first, a few years back, Geoffrey was very mischievous and treated the library as a place to play hide-and-seek. However, Immortal Book had shown him quite a number of interesting toys, and he quickly became deeply engrossed.</p>

  <p>Every day, after a short period of cultivation, he spent the rest of his time in the library, constantly reading Holy Bromley's books and also trying to study the golden Sanskrit words, as if they had a unique magical attraction on him.</p>

  <p>Despite the benefits of the library for Geoffrey, Ning Yudie had her doubts and remained worried. Imogen had even stopped Geoffrey from going there for a while.</p>

  <p>Immortal Book, on the other hand, was convinced of Geoffrey's extraordinary talent in this area, and he persuaded Ning Yudie and Imogen by telling them the golden Sanskrit words' importance. If Geoffrey was successful in this area, his achievements would be far greater than Zheng's.</p>

  <p>In Yudie's eyes, her husband was an existence that could never be surpassed, but Immortal Book had said that Geoffrey just might.</p>

  <p>If she could really nurture Geoffrey into a talent like her husband, then of course, she'd be willing to do so.</p>

  <p>And over the years, aside from trying to understand Bromley's speculations, Geoffrey also attempted to decipher the golden Sanskrit words - at which, he was truly successful.</p>

  <p>This was something that Immortal Book had never thought completely possible.</p>

  <p>"You mean... Geoffrey can decipher the golden Sanskrit words?" Zheng's eyes widened as he looked at Geoffrey, standing not very far off, with an expression of disbelief.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey couldn't help but smile shyly upon seeing his father's shocked expression.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie and Immortal Book were also pleased to see Zheng's surprise.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was exceptionally outstanding in all aspects, but Geoffrey's ability to decipher the golden Sanskrit words far surpassed Zheng's. Therefore, Ning Yudie felt proud. Proud and accomplished.</p>

  <p>"Quick, show me the Sanskrit words you've deciphered!" Luo Zheng said excitedly. He began to feel a little anxious, as he was well aware of what this meant.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey's expression was very calm. After taking out a writing brush and paper, he began to write down the contents that he had deciphered. It hadn't taken him very long at all to get through over a thousand words.</p>
