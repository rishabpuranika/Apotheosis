<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Over a hundred Corpse Spirit Sun Crows were scattered above Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Is it okay, Emperor Charm?" Zheng asked just as he was about a thousand feet away from the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows at the bottom.</p>

  <p>Emperor Charm nodded. "Yes."</p>

  <p>Green light flashed in the emperor's slender eyes and Zheng began to feel something press onto his mind.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>Seven or eight Corpse Spirit Sun Crows at the bottom looked down as a trace of green light also flashed in their eyes. Zheng felt the existence of these Corpse Spirit Sun Crows within his mind just as the connection was made.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes widened in wonder! "It's done!"</p>

  <p>He continued to fly towards the higher layer where there were more than ten Corpse Spirit Sun Crows waiting. Zheng noticed how they had to maintain a certain amount of distance between them owing to their incredibly huge sizes.</p>

  <p>This time, before he even started to make a request to Emperor Charm, the eyes of these Corpse Spirit Sun Crows flashed green and their consciousness connected with his mind.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh...</p>

  <p>At that moment, sharp, whistling sounds came from high above.</p>

  <p>More than twenty Divine Lair women were quickly descending on the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows and their target was obvious: Zheng.</p>

  <p>It wasn't a problem for him to kill one or two Divine Lair women given his strength, but it was a rather different story if there were more than twenty of them.</p>

  <p>"Descend."</p>

  <p>Zheng heard Emperor Charm's voice echo in his head.</p>

  <p>Even without this reminder, Zheng wasn't willing to continue his ascent.</p>

  <p>As he descended, Zheng noticed that the Sun Crows commanded by Emperor Charm remained in the air in their original positions. They even continued spitting out their blue flames.</p>

  <p>The Divine Lair women who were hot at his tail were none the wiser and simply ignored these Corpse Spirit Sun Crows. They did not notice any abnormality whatsoever and continued to chase solely after Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Catch him!"</p>

  <p>"Don't let him escape back to the Sky Net!"</p>

  <p>"You think we'll let you go this time?" "We'll definitely catch you!"</p>

  <p>These demon women that chased after Zheng were all elites in the Divine Lair. Their individual strength could easily suppress an outstanding Oneness Sky Palace warrior.</p>

  <p>There was really no need to send so many people after someone like Zheng and all his pursuers were confident that they'd be able to catch him even with their eyes closed.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth watched the spectacle from high above as she sat on the back of a Corpse Spirit Sun Crow.</p>

  <p>These Corpse Spirit Sun Crows were all controlled by her and she suddenly felt the loss of her connection with the ones below.</p>

  <p>There was no way someone could've severed her connection with these Corpse Spirit Sun Crows. Her power over them was absolute, unless Emperor Charm was involved.</p>

  <p>To think that something like this could happen...</p>

  <p>Though they continued to spit out blue flames, Elizabeth couldn't help the apprehension that rose to her chest as she looked down at the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows below.</p>

  <p>"This..." she muttered through gritted teeth. It was supposed to be impossible but she couldn't deny that her control over them had been entirely severed. "Damn it! Come back! All of you!" she shouted. Her voice instantly spread to the minds of all the demon women that pursued Zheng.</p>

  <p>These Divine Lair women were all created by Elizabeth and they obeyed her completely. With her command, they ceased their pursuit and ordered their mounts to hover in the air.</p>

  <p>They were now on the same level as the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows controlled by Zheng.</p>

  <p>"It's time..." Zheng muttered to himself with a smile as he descended.</p>

  <p>His chance had come!</p>

  <p>The Corpse Spirit Sun Crows, who were continually spouting jets of blue flame, turned in unison. The blue flames were like sharp swords that came at the demon women.</p>

  <p>Sizzle, sizzle, sizzle...</p>

  <p>These flames were harmless to the other Corpse Spirit Sun Crows but the same could not be said to the Divine Lair women. The moment the flames licked their bodies, their Chaotic Source Spirits instantly fell into fatigue and they quickly turned to ashes.</p>

  <p>Those who were lucky enough to see this quickly reacted and abandoned the Sun Crows in an effort to escape.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, there were more than twenty Corpse Spirit Sun Crows in the air and their flames scorched through everything. The Divine Lair women who tried to escape never stood a chance.</p>

  <p>Pearce, who was standing on top of the Lofty Sword a hundred miles away, whooped, "Well done!"</p>

  <p>"Great job!"</p>

  <p>"He killed all those demon women whilst snatching away more than twenty Corpse Spirit Sun Crows! It's amazing!"</p>

  <p>"Amazing! It's truly amazing!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's feat was so astounding that Auden, Athemar, and Goran couldn't help but shower him with praises.</p>

  <p>"Maybe..." Pearce began as he looked at the scene in front of him in awe.</p>

  <p>"Maybe what, Pearce?" "Maybe he can force the fellows hiding in the dark to appear!"</p>

  <p>This was once an unrealistic hope but now, Peace couldn't help but feel that there might now be a possibility for this to happen.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the Vastness Array</p>

  <p>"Why is Elizabeth so lame?" Gethin asked.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth was considered as the most powerful figure in the Divine Lair of the Sun Crow race and with so many powerful demon women with her, there was no excuse for her to have let Zheng get away!</p>

  <p>Someone calculating like Gethin would naturally choose to be on the stronger side of the war.</p>

  <p>The scene he had just witnessed suddenly made him doubt the Sun Crow race's strength.</p>

  <p>"That Zheng is too cunning," Natasha muttered beside him. "Maybe he used some sort of special method?"</p>

  <p>When they had caught Zheng back in the Vastness Mountain, she had been the one to interrogate him.</p>

  <p>His skills definitely left a deep impression on her.</p>

  <p>A group of warriors considerably stronger than him couldn't do anything to him at that time.</p>

  <p>Had Zheng's strength grown to the point that he could now face off against Elizabeth?</p>

  <p>"I swear I'll kill you today!" Elizabeth snarled angrily at Zheng.</p>

  <p>She had already forgotten her own duty.</p>

  <p>In her angered state, Elizabeth manipulated all the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows to spit their blue flames towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>Facing the barrage of so many blue flames, even the mightiest warriors would choose to dodge.</p>

  <p>All eyes were on Zheng at that moment.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, run!"</p>

  <p>"You've already stolen twenty Corpse Spirit Sun Crows! That's enough..."</p>

  <p>"It's too early for you to fight against Elizabeth!"</p>

  <p>"It should be easy for him to dodge while controlling his mount!"</p>

  <p>Even the warriors of the Azure Mountain, the Bright Mountain, and the Ivory Mountain were paying close attention to him once they realized that he could determine the trend of this entire war.</p>

  <p>The Sky Net had almost reached its limit and would not be able to withstand any more power. However, when the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows stopped releasing fire, it began to repair itself.</p>

  <p>As he faced the oncoming flames, Zheng suddenly had a bold idea. "How would you react if I took away all the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows?!"</p>

  <p>He did not command his mount to carry him to safety. Instead, he made it rush headfirst into the flames.</p>

  <p>In just a few moments, he, along with the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow, disappeared into the blue flames...</p>

  <p>Everyone was stunned into silence.</p>

  <p>Save for a small number of people who knew the truth about Zheng, most people viewed his actions as suicide!</p>

  <p>"What is he doing?!"</p>

  <p>"Is he asking for death?!"</p>

  <p>"He has no reason to do so!"</p>

  <p>All the leaders of the seven mountains along with all the powerful warriors in the seven arrays could only look on in confusion.</p>
