  <p>
</p>

  <p>Over a hundred Corpse Spirit Jin Wu were scattered above Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Is it okay, Emperor Di Jun?" Luo Zheng asked just as he was about a thousand feet away from the Corpse Spirit Jin Wu at the bottom.</p>

  <p>Emperor Di Jun nodded. "Yes."</p>

  <p>Green light flashed in the emperor's slender eyes and Luo Zheng began to feel something press onto his mind.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>Seven or eight Corpse Spirit Jin Wu at the bottom looked down as a trace of green light also flashed in their eyes. Luo Zheng felt the existence of these Corpse Spirit Jin Wu within his mind just as the connection was made.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes widened in wonder! "It's done!"</p>

  <p>He continued to fly towards the higher layer where there were more than ten Corpse Spirit Jin Wu waiting. Luo Zheng noticed how they had to maintain a certain amount of distance between them owing to their incredibly huge sizes.</p>

  <p>This time, before he even started to make a request to Emperor Di Jun, the eyes of these Corpse Spirit Jin Wu flashed green and their consciousness connected with his mind.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh...</p>

  <p>At that moment, sharp, whistling sounds came from high above.</p>

  <p>More than twenty Divine Lair women were quickly descending on the Corpse Spirit Jin Wu and their target was obvious: Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>It wasn't a problem for him to kill one or two Divine Lair women given his strength, but it was a rather different story if there were more than twenty of them.</p>

  <p>"Descend."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng heard Emperor Di Jun's voice echo in his head.</p>

  <p>Even without this reminder, Luo Zheng wasn't willing to continue his ascent.</p>

  <p>As he descended, Luo Zheng noticed that the Jin Wu commanded by Emperor Di Jun remained in the air in their original positions. They even continued spitting out their blue flames.</p>

  <p>The Divine Lair women who were hot at his tail were none the wiser and simply ignored these Corpse Spirit Jin Wu. They did not notice any abnormality whatsoever and continued to chase solely after Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Catch him!"</p>

  <p>"Don't let him escape back to the Sky Net!"</p>

  <p>"You think we'll let you go this time?" "We'll definitely catch you!"</p>

  <p>These demon women that chased after Luo Zheng were all elites in the Divine Lair. Their individual strength could easily suppress an outstanding Taiyi Heaven Palace warrior.</p>

  <p>There was really no need to send so many people after someone like Luo Zheng and all his pursuers were confident that they'd be able to catch him even with their eyes closed.</p>

  <p>Phoenix watched the spectacle from high above as she sat on the back of a Corpse Spirit Sun Crow.</p>

  <p>These Corpse Spirit Jin Wu were all controlled by her and she suddenly felt the loss of her connection with the ones below.</p>

  <p>There was no way someone could've severed her connection with these Corpse Spirit Jin Wu. Her power over them was absolute, unless Emperor Di Jun was involved.</p>

  <p>To think that something like this could happen...</p>

  <p>Though they continued to spit out blue flames, Phoenix couldn't help the apprehension that rose to her chest as she looked down at the Corpse Spirit Jin Wu below.</p>

  <p>"This..." she muttered through gritted teeth. It was supposed to be impossible but she couldn't deny that her control over them had been entirely severed. "Damn it! Come back! All of you!" she shouted. Her voice instantly spread to the minds of all the demon women that pursued Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>These Divine Lair women were all created by Phoenix and they obeyed her completely. With her command, they ceased their pursuit and ordered their mounts to hover in the air.</p>

  <p>They were now on the same level as the Corpse Spirit Jin Wu controlled by Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"It's time..." Luo Zheng muttered to himself with a smile as he descended.</p>

  <p>His chance had come!</p>

  <p>The Corpse Spirit Jin Wu, who were continually spouting jets of blue flame, turned in unison. The blue flames were like sharp swords that came at the demon women.</p>

  <p>Sizzle, sizzle, sizzle...</p>

  <p>These flames were harmless to the other Corpse Spirit Jin Wu but the same could not be said to the Divine Lair women. The moment the flames licked their bodies, their Chaotic Source Spirits instantly fell into fatigue and they quickly turned to ashes.</p>

  <p>Those who were lucky enough to see this quickly reacted and abandoned the Jin Wu in an effort to escape.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, there were more than twenty Corpse Spirit Jin Wu in the air and their flames scorched through everything. The Divine Lair women who tried to escape never stood a chance.</p>

  <p>Pearce, who was standing on top of the Lofty Sword a hundred miles away, whooped, "Well done!"</p>

  <p>"Great job!"</p>

  <p>"He killed all those demon women whilst snatching away more than twenty Corpse Spirit Jin Wu! It's amazing!"</p>

  <p>"Amazing! It's truly amazing!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's feat was so astounding that Auden, Qiu Yinhe, and Goran couldn't help but shower him with praises.</p>

  <p>"Maybe..." Pearce began as he looked at the scene in front of him in awe.</p>

  <p>"Maybe what, Pearce?" "Maybe he can force the fellows hiding in the dark to appear!"</p>

  <p>This was once an unrealistic hope but now, Peace couldn't help but feel that there might now be a possibility for this to happen.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the Vastness Array</p>

  <p>"Why is Phoenix so lame?" Gethin asked.</p>

  <p>Phoenix was considered as the most powerful figure in the Divine Lair of the Jin Wu and with so many powerful demon women with her, there was no excuse for her to have let Luo Zheng get away!</p>

  <p>Someone calculating like Gethin would naturally choose to be on the stronger side of the war.</p>

  <p>The scene he had just witnessed suddenly made him doubt the Jin Wu's strength.</p>

  <p>"That Luo Zheng is too cunning," Natasha muttered beside him. "Maybe he used some sort of special method?"</p>

  <p>When they had caught Luo Zheng back in the Vastness Mountain, she had been the one to interrogate him.</p>

  <p>His skills definitely left a deep impression on her.</p>

  <p>A group of warriors considerably stronger than him couldn't do anything to him at that time.</p>

  <p>Had Luo Zheng's strength grown to the point that he could now face off against Phoenix?</p>

  <p>"I swear I'll kill you today!" Phoenix snarled angrily at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>She had already forgotten her own duty.</p>

  <p>In her angered state, Phoenix manipulated all the Corpse Spirit Jin Wu to spit their blue flames towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Facing the barrage of so many blue flames, even the mightiest warriors would choose to dodge.</p>

  <p>All eyes were on Luo Zheng at that moment.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, run!"</p>

  <p>"You've already stolen twenty Corpse Spirit Jin Wu! That's enough..."</p>

  <p>"It's too early for you to fight against Phoenix!"</p>

  <p>"It should be easy for him to dodge while controlling his mount!"</p>

  <p>Even the warriors of the Azure Mountain, the Bright Mountain, and the Ivory Mountain were paying close attention to him once they realized that he could determine the trend of this entire war.</p>

  <p>The Sky Net had almost reached its limit and would not be able to withstand any more power. However, when the Corpse Spirit Jin Wu stopped releasing fire, it began to repair itself.</p>

  <p>As he faced the oncoming flames, Luo Zheng suddenly had a bold idea. "How would you react if I took away all the Corpse Spirit Jin Wu?!"</p>

  <p>He did not command his mount to carry him to safety. Instead, he made it rush headfirst into the flames.</p>

  <p>In just a few moments, he, along with the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow, disappeared into the blue flames...</p>

  <p>Everyone was stunned into silence.</p>

  <p>Save for a small number of people who knew the truth about Luo Zheng, most people viewed his actions as suicide!</p>

  <p>"What is he doing?!"</p>

  <p>"Is he asking for death?!"</p>

  <p>"He has no reason to do so!"</p>

  <p>All the leaders of the seven mountains along with all the powerful warriors in the seven arrays could only look on in confusion.</p>
