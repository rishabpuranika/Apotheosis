<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2301 The Astronomical Transit Day </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The divine land had existed for countless years, so it went without saying that the talents there had diligently studied the effects of the divine might coins as much as they could.</p>

  <p>But in the end, all they were capable of using the coins for was to change the rules on the Ruling Slate. This meant that the True Gods could not wield the true power of the coins.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, who was no stranger to experimentation, used his strong power to crush the coins, but all he ended up with was a handful of black powder.</p>

  <p>He was unable to release the Faith Energy in the coins.</p>

  <p>He even tried sprinkling the black powder onto his Godly Tile as well as into the chaotic sea, but the powder didn't react with anything.</p>

  <p>During his time in the inner world, he exhausted all sorts of strange and bizarre methods to try to release the true power of the coins. The Evil God gave him advice and suggestions as well. But in the end, he had no choice but to temporarily give up on this endeavor.</p>

  <p>There were certain facts that he might have ignored. It was possible that the Faith Energy constructed by the chaotic energy in the divine land could not be directly used.</p>

  <p>Whatever it was, Luo Zheng didn't feel upset or disappointed. After all, now that his Godly Tile was condensed, he had become a True God. This improvement in his cultivation had also caused a great increase in his strength.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng ordered the Evil God to stop the secret sect for the time being after his avatar left.</p>

  <p>At this stage, he was unable to use the Faith Energy, so it was useless to collect it in the statues. Moreover, the extra Faith Energy would automatically form divine might coins.</p>

  <p>After he gave the order, his consciousness returned to the practice room.</p>

  <p>Although he had spent a lot of time in his inner world, only a few hours had passed in the divine land.</p>

  <p>When he opened the door to go outside, he saw that it was already past dawn.</p>

  <p>He hadn't seen Joy in recent days.</p>

  <p>After all, the Dongfang Clan had started to look for him, the anonymous man. His performance in the Arena of Legends had almost made them sure that he was a member of the Purple Soul Hall, so Joy was doing her best to avert suspicion.</p>

  <p>"It's time to leave the Floating Island," Luo Zheng said, staring at the tumbling clouds in the sky.</p>

  <p>The rankings of the Floating Islands had been reorganized yesterday, so the channels to the forbidden lands would be open today.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng left the Purple Soul Hall and went to the Holy Emperor City again.</p>

  <p>Traveling by flight and spatial transference was prohibited in the Time Sea. This was a rule stipulated on the Ruling Slate.</p>

  <p>However, in order to monopolize the forbidden lands, the Hall of Holy Beings had revised this rule. They had built transmission channels that were directly connected to the forbidden lands on the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>The inhabitants of the Floating Islands could directly travel to the forbidden lands by spatial transference via the channels.</p>

  <p>Moreover, these transmission channels on the Floating Islands had become the only entrances to the forbidden lands.</p>

  <p>It was precisely this reason that had made the True Gods of humble birth in the divine land grind their teeth in hatred.</p>

  <p>Because of this revised rule, True Gods like Master Evil had lost the opportunity to enter the forbidden lands. Cultivating, discovering divine might coins, and looking for opportunities in the forbidden lands had all become the privileges of the disciples of powerful clans on the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>This hindered the progress of the divine citizens.</p>

  <p>In the past, True Gods of humble birth had had opportunities to become consummate True Gods and even Holy Beings. But now that they had lost access to the forbidden lands, it was almost impossible for them to come across such opportunities to develop themselves.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng arrived at the northern part of the Holy Emperor City, he saw a row of guards of the Han Clan standing in front of a broad square and blocking the path of the True Gods.</p>

  <p>"The rankings of the Floating Islands have been settled."</p>

  <p>"Why can't we go to the forbidden lands today? I made a great effort to earn enough points. I must go to the Everest Spirit Mountain!"</p>

  <p>"What happened? How strange!"</p>

  <p>The True Gods of all ranks who were gathered there were complaining among themselves.</p>

  <p>Seeing this scene, Luo Zheng frowned slightly.</p>

  <p>He looked behind the guards and saw that the square they were guarding was where the transmission channels were. The transmission channels set up by the Han Clan were a row of stone walls. Luo Zheng didn't know if the transmission channels of the other powerful clans also looked the same.</p>

  <p>"Bro, we should be able to use the transmission channels to go to the forbidden lands today, right?" Luo Zheng asked a True God.</p>

  <p>The True God glanced at Luo Zheng and said bitterly, "I thought there would be a lot of divine might coins inside the forbidden lands since no one has entered them for a while, but we are not allowed to enter. Who knows why?"</p>

  <p>Divine might coins were what all these True Gods were after. The forbidden lands had been explored for decades. As soon as a divine might coin appeared, it would immediately be taken away by an explorer who was lucky enough to chance upon it. But since no one had been able to enter the forbidden lands in the past few days, there must be a lot of divine might coins ripe for the picking.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded. The Faith Energy in the divine land was not infinite. Only when the Faith Energy was sufficient would the divine might coins be condensed.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng suddenly had a bad feeling. Was this ban from entering the forbidden lands aimed at him?</p>

  <p>It was highly possible.</p>

  <p>If the Mu Clan or the Dongfang Clan were insistent on finding out the identity of the anonymous man, they would probably exert pressure on the Han Clan. If that was the case, it would only make sense for the Han Clan to close the transmission channels until they found the anonymous man.</p>

  <p>While Luo Zheng was worrying about this, he heard a resounding ring in the air.</p>

  <p>Clang!</p>

  <p>The ring had not come from the Floating Island, but from the depth of the clouds.</p>

  <p>All the people immediately raised their heads to the sky. Just then, a golden light penetrated the clouds and swept across the Floating Islands before shining on the surface of the Time Sea. After it reached the surface of the sea, it bounced back and reflected a magnificent and colorful ray of light.</p>

  <p>At the sight of the golden light, enlightenment dawned on many of the True Gods' faces, including the face of the True God next to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Oh! I see! No wonder we can't enter the forbidden lands today. Today is the Astronomical Transit Day," the True God said.</p>

  <p>"The Astronomical Transit Day?" Luo Zheng raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>He hadn't expected that the Astronomical Transit Day of the Sun Blind race would come right after the rankings of the Floating Islands were rearranged. No one would be able to use the transmission channels on the Astronomical Transit Day.</p>

  <p>It was the grandest festival of the Sun Blind race.</p>

  <p>On this day, even the sailing on the Time Sea would come to a halt.</p>

  <p>It was customary for the mysterious race on the sea to invite a few important people from the powerful clans. Luo Zheng was also invited.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the words that an old man from the Sun Blind race had told him flashed in his mind. The old man had said that Zheng's Mu Ning resembled the terrifying Mu Ning of the Emperor Resentment, a monster that resided in the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>"Alas! Today is the Astronomical Transit Day. The only people who are invited are the principal figures of each clan. Of course, none of us stands a chance!"</p>

  <p>"We can leave now and come back another day!"</p>

  <p>"It's said that attending the Astronomical Transit Day will bring unimaginable benefits, and that the participants can even explore the secrets of time."</p>

  <p>In the eyes of the world, the Sun Blind race had always been covered by a mysterious veil. These True Gods would never be able to participate in the Astronomical Transit Day, so naturally, there were all sorts of guesses thrown out among them.</p>

  <p>None of them knew exactly what the Astronomical Transit Day was.</p>

  <p>After a few minutes of complaining and speculating about the festival, the True Gods gradually began to leave.</p>

  <p>"Should I take part in the Astronomical Transit Day?" Luo Zheng wondered hesitantly.</p>

  <p>The biggest problem for him now was not the Mu Clan. Although they were interested in finding the anonymous man, they would not be able to connect Luo Zheng to the anonymous man. Besides, Murphy, the only person who had seen his true identity, was still being punished by the Ruling Slate.</p>

  <p>As for the Dongfang Clan, they didn't have any malicious intention by looking for him. They just wanted to recruit him as a member of their Floating Island.</p>

  <p>If he faced the worst situation, he could activate the token of mountain and return to the fairy palace in the Swirl Forest.</p>

  <p>With this thought, Luo Zheng made a decision.</p>
