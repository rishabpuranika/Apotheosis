<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Now, looking at their momentum, Zheng was very conflicted.</p>

  <p>Back then, when Estelle left the fairy palace, the enchanted barrier failed to stop her.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng had no idea whether she escaped because she had broken the enchanted barrier or perhaps she had a secret method to go through it.</p>

  <p>If a consummate True God could tear open the enchanted barrier, they could easily connect the space of the divine land with that of the fairy palace which would cause some grave consequences.</p>

  <p>As he worried about what could happen, Saul came out to console him,</p>

  <p>"Master, don't worry. They can enter this enchanted barrier freely."</p>

  <p>Hearing Saul's words calmed down Zheng, allowing him to focus on other things.</p>

  <p>His family resided in the fairy palace. They were the most important people to him. Naturally, he could not allow any accidents to happen.</p>

  <p>As the two men gradually approached the enchanted barrier, their speed did not decrease at all.</p>

  <p>Gus, who was rushing in the front, suddenly flipped his hand and a small token appeared in his hand.</p>

  <p>A wind token!</p>

  <p>Zheng saw the token immediately and gave it a good look.</p>

  <p>The eight tokens-- of water, fire, thunder, wind, mountain, valley, earth, and heaven--all had different uses and advantages. Among them, the wind token was the first token Zheng had obtained, and the only use of this token seemed to be to dodge the two huge puppets in the fairy palace, so that he could enter the fairy palace safely.</p>

  <p>After Zheng obtained the recognition of Saul, the wind token didn't have much use to him anymore. Moreover, he had already managed to enter the fairy palace several times by passing through the space node in the valley of the Eastern Region. Later, after he got the mountain token, he could then eventually return to the fairy palace directly.</p>

  <p>He never would have guessed that the wind token would have such use.</p>

  <p>As soon as Gus took out his token, he headed straight towards the enchanted barrier. As the indestructible enchanted barrier slightly fluctuated, it somehow engulfed Gus' body entirely.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the boy riding the cyan ox also raised a wind token and entered through the enchanted barrier in a similar manner.</p>

  <p>"Bang, bang, bang!"</p>

  <p>Just then, the apes that chased after them arrived and left big gaping holes on the ground outside the enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>Among them, several golden apes looked quite indignant. They pounded hard on their chests and showed their teeth to the two people at the other side of the enchanted barrier, trying to provoke them.</p>

  <p>"Wow... These damn apes are really hard to deal with." The long haired man gasped.</p>

  <p>"Gus, Hal, long time no see," said Saul, greeting them with smiles.</p>

  <p>Gus was the shortened version of Augustus, while Hal was the nickname of Hallet. Quite familiar with them, Saul addressed them with their nicknames to show friendliness.</p>

  <p>After Augustus and Hallet greeted Saul, they never lost their focus on Zheng. Then they looked at Joy who was beside Zheng, and then they saw Yudie, Xun behind him. Not far away, Freya and Aura also heard the news and rushed over to see it for themselves.</p>

  <p>"Isn't this Zheng? Shouldn't you have gone to the Everest Spirit Mountain?</p>

  <p>Why are you in the fairy palace? This... You are the Demi-holy Being of the Han clan!" Augustus' widened his eyes at the sight of the legendary Zheng. He was no stranger to Zheng's rising fame and success.</p>

  <p>Hallet was also stunned, trying to keep his jaw from dropping.</p>

  <p>After they heard Harold's words from the Floating Island, they began to act.</p>

  <p>They left the Floating Island of the Gu Clan with no clue what had happened in the Time Sea. All things considered, the last person they thought they'd meet was Zheng in the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>"Long time no see!" Joy nodded at them.</p>

  <p>She also knew Hallet and Augustus quite exceptionally.</p>

  <p>"Augustus and Hallet, nice to meet you!" Zheng cupped his hands and greeted them with good intentions.</p>

  <p>Although he had heard of them long ago, this was the first time the three had ever gathered in person.</p>

  <p>After the short greeting, Zheng casually invited them inside to have a friendly chat.</p>

  <p>"Wait," Augustus suddenly waved his hand and took a look at Zheng with fierceness in his eyes. "Zheng! I remember I said before that after you went to the divine land, I would spar with you!"</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Hallet curled his lips. He knew Gus' personality: always ready to get what he wanted without ever caring about the appropriateness or the occasion.</p>

  <p>However, Hallet didn't stop him. Augustus was rash, but he also knew when to stop. For some reason, Hallet was also curious about Zheng's strength, and if he was worthy enough to be entrusted with the entire fairy palace.</p>

  <p>But before Zheng could even answer, Augustus' body disappeared in a flash and reappeared right behind Zheng.</p>

  <p>The clone left in the True Path by Augustus was not that powerful.</p>

  <p>Now, he was fighting Zheng with his level of a consummate True God!</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>As soon as Augustus appeared behind Zheng, he flipped his hand and brought down his arm without any hesitation.</p>

  <p>In the Time Sea, Zheng had relied on the jade seal to suppress all of the consummate True Gods, but he was only a low-rank True God who had proven a Godly Way recently. The gap between his strength and the strength of a consummate True God was enormous. He had no idea how he could avoid this upcoming attack.</p>

  <p>Before he could react, Augustus' hand had hit Zheng's back with a huge pounding force.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>With the huge force against him, Zheng's entire body involuntarily fell forward.</p>

  <p>Seeing that he was about to fall, he put his hands on the ground, did a somersault, and then stood firmly onto the ground like nothing had happened, "Gus, now is not a good time to spar."</p>

  <p>However, it was as if Augustus didn't hear a thing. He gritted his teeth and laughed sinisterly. "You didn't give me a chance to talk last time!"</p>

  <p>On the True Path, Zheng was afraid that Augustus would counterattack, so he cut off the body Augustus had left on the True Path. It was not until the body which was formed by Dark and Light energies only had half part left that Zheng allowed Augustus to speak. Ever since then, Augustus had borne a deep "grudge" against Zheng which was not going away anytime soon.</p>

  <p>All he wanted to do was teach Zheng a lesson.</p>

  <p>Once he finished speaking, Augustus disappeared once again.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>A punch to Zheng's stomach sent him flying backwards and against a wall.</p>

  <p>But before Zheng could even land on the ground, Augustus flashed and actually appeared under Zheng. He then threw a forceful uppercut that sent Zheng on another whirlwind of pain.</p>

  <p>"Bang! Bang! Bang..."</p>

  <p>Augustus' body constantly flashed in the air. Zheng was like a ball in the air, thrown by him back and forth, without any strength or willpower to fight back.</p>

  <p>"Zheng seems to have nothing special," said Hallet with a chuckle as he looked at Zheng in the air. "He seems to only be good at sustaining beatings."</p>

  <p>"Hey! Stop it! Who do you think you are! How could you beat him as soon as you met each other? That's just immature." Seeing things unfold so quickly, Yudie felt very sad for Zheng who was being made into a ball.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Xun didn't say a thing. Although she couldn't tell how powerful the two were, she didn't feel that Augustus bore any ill attention. Despite how it seemed, she could tell that his attacks were well controlled and not intended to harm Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Bang! Bang! Bang..."</p>

  <p>As Zheng was hit back and forth like this, he began to feel a little nauseated.</p>

  <p>It was a good thing that he had the Redemption Armor, so he wasn't hurt by Augustus' attacks.</p>

  <p>But despite this, he was not at all pleased to be fooled around in such manner.</p>

  <p>However, he couldn't even see Augustus considering his speedy movement. How could he fight back?</p>

  <p>'He's at the back!' Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>As he struggled in midair, he turned around and tried to grab Augustus by the neck.</p>

  <p>He was thinking of all the things he'd do to Gus when he finally captured him.</p>

  <p>Lucky for him, Zheng was right. However, Augustus began to float away from Zheng and appeared above him. He was about to stomp on Zheng!</p>

  <p>"Eight Smoky Melodies!"</p>

  <p>Because he was so dizzy and tired of this game, Zheng had no choice but to use Eight Smoky Melodies. He floated like a piece of paper.</p>

  <p>"Does it work? Remember this is the cultivation method I recommended for you!" Augustus let out a loud laugh, trying to stomp onto Zheng's body with no mercy.</p>

  <p>But the moment his foot collided with Zheng's body, he felt something wrong. He saw a trace of incomprehensible truth from Zheng, and his face began to show fear instead of excitement.</p>

  <p>With that trace of truth, together with the bodily movement skills of the Eight Smoky Melodies, Zheng dodged Augustus' foot with no extra movements. Just then, he stretched out and gripped Augustus' leg firmly.</p>

  <p>"Gus." He smiled. "I guess it's my turn now!"</p>
