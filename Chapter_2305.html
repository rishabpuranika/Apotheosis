  <p>
</p>

  <p>The dragon-bone ship slowly went ashore under everyone's gaze.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng jumped off the ship and landed on the shore, his eyes fell on the people from the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>Aleyna gave Luo Zheng a playful smile, to which Luo Zheng responded with a nod before shifting his gaze to her sister, Liusu.</p>

  <p>When Liusu's striking eyes met Luo Zheng's, she raised her eyebrows slightly, revealing a trace of anger, before turning away.</p>

  <p>It seemed that she was still angry at him. Luo Zheng smiled bitterly and then found a place to wait.</p>

  <p>When Aleyna noticed the expression on her sister's face, she became lost in thought, wondering if something had happened between her and Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Most of the True Gods' eyes were still focused on Luo Zheng, and they murmured among themselves about where he'd come from.</p>

  <p>"This guy doesn't seem to be from the Han Clan."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I think so too..."</p>

  <p>It was apparent from the way Luo Zheng didn't greet Alfredo, Pascal, or any of the others that he was not familiar with the Han Clan at all.</p>

  <p>However, someone present did recognize Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"It's him again! He has actually become a low-rank True God in such a short time!" A gloomy voice came out of nowhere. The one who had spoken was Langston from the Leng Clan.</p>

  <p>"Langston, do you know this guy?" Nelly asked, confused.</p>

  <p>"Humph, he is the one who killed Sheridan. His name is Tianxing Luo. He's also the one who caused the wound on my forehead! I didn't expect that he would break through in his cultivation and condense a Godly Tile in such a short time after entering the Floating Island," Langston said coldly with a murderous hint in his eyes.</p>

  <p>He still felt a lingering fear when he thought of how he had gotten his wound. If he hadn't responded so quickly that day, he would have been killed by that guy.</p>

  <p>And if it weren't the Astronomical Transit Day of the Sun Blind race today, he probably would have attacked him.</p>

  <p>"You were struck by a proving godly warrior. You were too careless," said Nelly indifferently.</p>

  <p>Hearing what Nelly said, Langston felt annoyed. His cultivation was a level higher than Nelly's; how could he tolerate her undermining him like this in front of everyone? He immediately retorted, "Even you may not be a match for him. Sheridan wasn't much weaker than you but he was still killed by that guy!"</p>

  <p>Rachelle, who had been silently listening to the conversation between her sister and Langston, suddenly had a thought flash through her mind.</p>

  <p>'His surname is Luo? A new talent of the Han Clan?'</p>

  <p>With her eyes on Luo Zheng in the distance, she asked, "He was only a proving godly warrior and he killed Sheridan? Didn't the Xie Clan cause trouble for the Han Clan?"</p>

  <p>The death of Sheridan had indeed caused a big ruckus back then, but Rachelle had been too busy to notice it. During that time, she had been preparing for the battle with Harold and hadn't had the time to care about anything else. Now, after hearing about this mysterious Tianxing Luo, she had a vague guess in her heart that she wanted to verify.</p>

  <p>"Yes, they did. But that guy seems to be a member of the Purple Soul Hall. He was under Joy's protection," said Langston coldly. He couldn't help but feel annoyed when talking about this matter.</p>

  <p>"Purple Soul Hall? Did he just recently join the Purple Soul Hall?"</p>

  <p>Rachelle asked again.</p>

  <p>Rachelle had always been a being of few words. As a consummate True God of the Mu Clan, she seldom talked to juniors like Langston. So naturally, Langston found her sudden interest in this topic odd. However, he didn't comment on it and instead said, "I checked his background. It's true that he only recently joined the Purple Soul Hall."</p>

  <p>As soon as those words left Langston's mouth, his eyes lit up in realization. A mere proving godly warrior had killed Sheridan and had had Joy to protect him...</p>

  <p>Langston immediately began to reevaluate Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Rachelle, do you suspect that he is the anonymous man?" he asked in a low voice.</p>

  <p>Langston was a mid-rank True God. Although he had heard that there was a great anonymous man in the Hall of True Gods going up against low-rank True Gods, he hadn't taken it seriously at that time as he had been busy winning points against mid-rank True Gods. Until now, he had never connected Luo Zheng to the anonymous man.</p>

  <p>But now, after hearing Rachelle's questions, it had suddenly dawned on him.</p>

  <p>Nelly's small mouth was slightly open in surprise and her sharp eyes were fixed on Luo Zheng. She was trying to match Luo Zheng with the anonymous man in her heart.</p>

  <p>"It's very likely," Rachelle said with an icy smile.</p>

  <p>Of course, what Langston didn't know was that she didn't care whether Luo Zheng was the anonymous man or not.</p>

  <p>The anonymous man was just someone who had been chosen by the Dongfang Clan. As for whether the Dongfang Clan could bring the anonymous man to their Floating Island, it had nothing to do with her.</p>

  <p>What she wanted to verify was something else...</p>

  <p>Not long ago, when she had lost to Harold, she had reported to her father Murphy about the news that the Everest Spirit Mountain would not be open to the Mu Clan anymore.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing that, her father had asked her to pay attention only to the Han Clan, because that was where the stowaways were most likely to be.</p>

  <p>The stowaways had entered the divine land two years ago. Now, there was an extremely strange anonymous man that had suddenly popped out of the Han Clan. Before, she had wondered if the anonymous man did not dare to reveal himself because of his sensitive identity.</p>

  <p>Now, she had even confirmed that the anonymous man's surname was Luo!</p>

  <p>The time, surname, and talent all almost matched the information she had gotten about the stowaways. Such a person could never have come from the group of ordinary divine citizens...</p>

  <p>At this moment, she was almost a hundred percent sure that Luo Zheng was one of the two stowaways, but she still needed to confirm it.</p>

  <p>Although she was suspicious, she didn't let it show on her face.</p>

  <p>Today was the grand Astronomical Transit Day of the Sun Blind race, so it was not the time for her to catch Luo Zheng, torture him, and force him to tell her his real identity. What was more, it was only a guess; she didn't have any proof. Anyway, she would have a lot of chances to observe him during the Astronomical Transit Day celebration. If she could confirm that he was one of the stowaways, she would definitely kill him without any hesitation.</p>

  <p>In the Floating Island, Luo Zheng had indeed considered the possibility that someone would see through his pretense.</p>

  <p>However, after weighing the pros and cons, he had decided that attending the celebration was worth the small risk. Besides, he planned to immediately leave the Floating Island after the celebration ended and head for the forbidden land.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was only this confident because he had never considered the possibility that someone would talk to Murphy. But since Rachelle had had a conversation with Murphy, she had become a lot more vigilant. So as soon as Luo Zheng had just showed up, he immediately caught Rachelle's attention.</p>

  <p>As everyone waited, Sun Blind members constantly arrived with guests on the ships.</p>

  <p>After a long time, about seven members of the Sun Blind race came over and saluted the crowd. The Sun Blind member in the front said politely,</p>

  <p>"Today is the Astronomical Transit Day. We are very honored to invite all of the True Gods here. Please follow me..."</p>

  <p>With the Sun Blind members leading the way, all the True Gods left the port and headed into the island.</p>

  <p>On the surface, the island of the Sun Blind race looked like an extremely ordinary island. Judging by the surroundings, the living environment was almost the same as the living environment of ordinary divine citizens.</p>

  <p>But after entering the island, the True Gods could feel strong Time Law spreading out almost everywhere, ranging from small plants to rocks around the island.</p>

  <p>The Time Sea could tear apart anything, but this small island was somehow able to resist its devastating power. It was an extremely peculiar feat. This gathering place of the Sun Blind race was probably the only island that existed in the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>Soon, everyone arrived at a flat and wide open space.</p>

  <p>The open space was surrounded by Sun Blind members of all ages. All of them prostrated on the ground devoutly, and no one looked up at them. What they were worshiping were the nine well-shaped stone pagodas in the center of the open space.</p>
