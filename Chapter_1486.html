<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Looking in horror as the old man fell to the ground, everyone from the Board of Elders seemed like they had just been hit by a truck.</p>

  <p>Never in their wildest dreams would they have thought that Yao would actually have the guts to put them down, let alone their leader.</p>

  <p>"If you insist on continuing with this nonsense of yours, I don't give a rat's ass about killing each and every single of you."</p>

  <p>After stating that, Yao went ahead and took Enzo as well as Supreme Lord Gunter away. In any case, she just couldn't afford to waste her precious time on these over-the-hill fellows of the Board of Elders.</p>

  <p>At first, she actually intended to have a bit of fun in this game of cat and mouse between her and Xun. That being said, in the case of Crown of Destiny, she was fully cognizant of the fact that it was about time for the game to reach its conclusion.</p>

  <p>"Enzo, tell Maddox and Tanya to finish the job without delay. And as for the Crown of Destiny, if they happen to locate it, then bring it back to me right away." Yao gave out her order.</p>

  <p>"Crown of Destiny?" Enzo was in a state of shock, with his eyes completely glued to Supreme Lord Gunter.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Gunter simply nodded his head to reaffirm it. "A Crown of Destiny has suddenly appeared. There's a good chance that it's with Xun."</p>

  <p>"I see." Enzo had always been quick on the uptake, so there was no need for them to say anything more.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in a star in the universe.</p>

  <p>There was a storm raging incessantly within the star. From afar, it was much like a scar on the surface of the star, stretching out for millions of miles. Little by little, it moved around on the star's surface.</p>

  <p>In truth, this storm was actually a fusion of thunder and fire. What was more, it had not faltered at all for a million years.</p>

  <p>Under such extreme conditions, not a living being could ever hope to pull through.</p>

  <p>Be that as it might, there was one person who was sitting in the very eye of the storm. With his arms outstretched, he had been continuously making calculations using his fingers!</p>

  <p>"Not here."</p>

  <p>Upon making that statement, he proceeded to raise his hand once more and carried on with his calculations! His mind was completely engrossed in finding something.</p>

  <p>"Not here either!"</p>

  <p>Then, he simply started calculating again.</p>

  <p>And before one could say "knife", that person opened his eyes, revealing a radiant glow that was like that of the stars. "I've done it! Ha-ha, it's making its way to me! This Crown of Destiny... It's destined to be in my hands!"</p>

  <p>When he was done speaking, his silhouette vanished into the massive storm. At that exact same time, the storm started to die down bit by bit!</p>

  <p>In the vast universe, a great many Supreme Lords had been trying to calculate the current position of the Crown of Destiny.</p>

  <p>For each of those Supreme Lords, their methods of calculating it might have varied, but all of them were perfectly capable of figuring out the location of the Crown of Destiny. This could only indicate that they had all locked on to Zheng's whereabouts and were already starting to adopt measures.</p>

  <p>This was something that even Zheng himself was not able to foresee!</p>

  <p>Indeed, he had a lot of faith in his fairy palace. However, that was just when he was holding his ground against Yao. If Supreme Lords were to actually come to him personally, there was no telling what could happen.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately for Zheng, he was totally oblivious of the fact that his location had already been figured out by a number of Supreme Lords. At the moment, he still had his hands full with operating the fractured Reincarnation Plate and moving through the deep space heading north.</p>

  <p>There was an innumerable amount of stars in the universe. In a supreme world, if a man was to look up at the stars in the heavens, he might think that the distance between them was not that far. But after personally journeying into the deep space, he would start to think otherwise and comprehend the actual distance.</p>

  <p>The Reincarnation Plate was moving at intense speed. At the rate that it was moving, even if Zheng were to unleash his maximum speed, it was highly unlikely that he would be able to reach so much as a hundredth of its current speed. In spite of that, even though he had already been flying for a full month, he had only moved a small distance in the deep space.</p>

  <p>Meaning to say, he was still a long way from the Northern Sky Region.</p>

  <p>The key was that there was no space channel in the deep space, and the distance between one star to the next was unthinkably great. Only warriors who cultivated in spatial transference were capable of moving around freely within it. Apart from that, because of the spatial transference's complex principles, only those at the level of world lord or higher could actually cultivate it.</p>

  <p>With that in mind, Zheng continued making the Reincarnation Plate head north and began to cultivate as well.</p>

  <p>In that span of time, a small vortex started taking shape right in the middle of the chaotic sea within Zheng's inner world.</p>

  <p>Ever since the moment the World Tree seed entered his elixir field, it had been gradually absorbing his chaotic energy without stopping.</p>

  <p>At present, Zheng had already managed to establish a connection with the seed. And he could tell that right after absorbing the chaotic energy, the seed had somehow transformed it into a special kind of energy.</p>

  <p>The new energy didn't seem to be life vitality, nor was it the pure Law Power. As for what it truly was, even Zheng found it hard to tell.</p>

  <p>The truth was that he had actually asked the cyan dragon as well as Xun about this before, but the two of them were totally in the dark.</p>

  <p>To be fair, the chaotic energy was related to something they could not comprehend. In the beginning, the cyan dragon actually had misgivings whether the tree seed would be able to hold out against the chaotic energy and successfully take root in Zheng's body. The results proved that he had been worrying over nothing. Despite that, Zheng was now having some strange reactions, and it was something he had to make sense of by himself.</p>

  <p>After one and a half months had passed</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Without a warning, the enormous Reincarnation Plate began to tremble violently.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Zheng immediately opened his eyes and thought, 'They're here!'</p>

  <p>As soon as he got to his feet, his eyes swept the area around the Reincarnation Plate. It wasn't long before he saw a man and a woman from the Demon Night standing in front of the Reincarnation Plate.</p>

  <p>'The strength that these two possess probably isn't much too different from that of Viveca, Elspeth, Salvador, and Aneisha.'</p>

  <p>Furrowing his eyebrows just a tad bit, Zheng knew that he was still far too weak. In the state that he was currently in, putting up a resistance against these strong people was definitely out of the question.</p>

  <p>This was all because Xun had gotten exposed much too soon. Zheng didn't really have enough time to bump up his strength whatsoever. And right now, he was about to be backed into a corner by such powerful enemies. No amount of talent would ever be able to help him hold his ground against these mighty world lords in just a short amount of time.</p>

  <p>Whoosh...</p>

  <p>In spite of sustaining a rather severe blow from the other party, the Reincarnation Plate was showing no signs of stopping at all. On the contrary, Zheng was actually dead set on still making his way through the deep space!</p>

  <p>"Our queen told us to go all out. First, we're going to tear this Reincarnation Plate apart, and then we'll end that boy's life, and finally, we'll take away the Crown of Destiny as well!" the woman from the Demon Night said, sounding as though it was just nothing.</p>

  <p>A faint smile crept onto the face of the man wearing a long robe. "This is going to be a cakewalk. Just you watch!"</p>

  <p>Immediately after he was done talking, a light purple crystal sword materialized in his hand. Starting off as just a light shaking, the crystal sword started vibrating uncontrollably!</p>

  <p>Buzz... Buzz... Buzz...</p>

  <p>In just a blink of an eye, the crystal sword split into two, and then two split into four, and the four into eight...</p>

  <p>In just a span of five minutes, through this fission process, a countless number of crystal swords had filled the space above the Reincarnation Plate.</p>

  <p>"Spirit Crystal Rain!"</p>

  <p>The moment the male Demon Night member's voice drifted away, all of the crystal swords floating above plunged straight toward the Reincarnation Plate one after the other!</p>

  <p>Pfft!</p>

  <p>It was hard to say where these crystal swords really came from. Even the exceedingly durable outer shell wasn't able to withstand the penetrating power of these crystal swords!</p>

  <p>The first crystal sword penetrated the plate with ease, leaving a bowl-sized opening on its surface. After that, the second one followed suit, then the third one, the fourth one... It appeared that there was no stopping that attack whatsoever.</p>

  <p>Pfft pfft pfft pfft...</p>

  <p>To put it simply, these crystal swords were much like a relentless rainstorm. It didn't take too long before the whole Reincarnation Plate became riddled with holes.</p>

  <p>On top of that, after piercing right through the Reincarnation Plate, they actually managed to penetrate even the bottom of the plate as well as bounce back.</p>

  <p>After that vicious onslaught, the crystal swords shifted their direction, hurling once again into the Reincarnation Plate.</p>

  <p>Pfft!</p>

  <p>And just like that, the Reincarnation Plate was now chock-full of crystal swords.</p>

  <p>As Zheng was seated at the bottom of the plate, a crystal sword pierced right through the palace and was coming straight at him.</p>

  <p>Because he was sitting on the ground, Zheng went hell for leather in order to evade the crystal sword. All he could do was watch as the crystal sword disappeared into the ground, but after that, he simply moved back to his original position. He still persistently operated the Reincarnation Plate. Throughout all of that, the expression he had on his face never shifted, not even once.</p>

  <p>There was no doubt that this Reincarnation Plate was indeed such a high-grade space tool, but considering the current level of Zheng's strength, there was no way for him to prevent it from receiving damage. The best he could do at this point was to just make the most of what was left by having it go as far as it possibly could!</p>

  <p>Pfft pfft pfft...</p>

  <p>While Zheng was still preoccupied with maneuvering the Reincarnation Plate, another set of ten or so crystal swords made their way into the palace. In response, Zheng's figure flashed one more time as he went on and continued to concentrate on navigating the plate.</p>

  <p>As these crystal swords ceaselessly hurtled to and fro, the Reincarnation Plate had become perforated all over.</p>

  <p>"The time is now. Let me do it myself." At this point, the woman held a ten-foot-long saber parallel to ground behind her, and a cold light suddenly enveloped the blade.</p>
