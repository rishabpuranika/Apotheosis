<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Previously, King Manard had asked Luo Zheng to help him find the human race on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>However, ever since Luo Zheng entered the Other Shore, he had never heard of the existence of any human. Even the Green Jade Spirit, who had been in the upper stages of the Other Shore before, had not known the existence of any human there.</p>

  <p>According to King Manard, humans were not born in this round of chaos by chance. Instead, it was an inevitable phenomenon. It was the reason why he was very affirmative that Luo Zheng should be able to find them somewhere on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>The human civilization was many, many years older than the Green Jade Civilization, and anything could have happened in such a long period.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng really wanted to find an answer, he could only seek it from the supreme human warriors.</p>

  <p>He originally wanted to return to the Taiyi Heaven Palace to see Eastern Emperor Taiyi. But now that he had seen the Snake Goddess, he thought that he could bring up this matter to her.</p>

  <p>The moment Luo Zheng raised the question, the face of the Snake Goddess suddenly looked serious.</p>

  <p>Her smiling face turned quite pale and it was evident that she felt somewhat uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>"Why are you asking this question?" the Snake Goddess asked as she stared directly into Luo Zheng's eyes.</p>

  <p>Yan couldn't help but blink repeatedly in wonder.</p>

  <p>She had stayed with the Snake Goddess for quite a long time, and this was the first instance that she had seen her exhibit a mood swing.</p>

  <p>'Is Luo Zheng's question strange?' she wondered inwardly.</p>

  <p>Since there were all sorts of races on the Other Shore, it might not be that uncommon if humans also dwelt there.</p>

  <p>"I just want to know," Luo Zheng said calmly.</p>

  <p>Before getting a certain answer from the Snake Goddess, Luo Zheng didn't want to tell her his connection to King Manard.</p>

  <p>"It's just out of curiosity? Or is there something else?" the Snake Goddess asked as she tried to fish for some secrets to be spilled.</p>

  <p>"Well, yes, there are other reasons. Some are related to the Truth of Divine Dao that I'll be showing." As Luo Zheng answered, he stretched out his hand and the red, yellow and blue energy beams began spiraling up above his palm.</p>

  <p>The energy beams were interwoven with each other and gradually formed a small sculpture of Yan.</p>

  <p>"That's amazing! You created it out of nothing!"</p>

  <p>Yan had been in the Li Shan mountain for quite some time and had seen a lot of skills performed by the people there. As she witnessed Luo Zheng's skill, she knew that this one was extraordinary at first glance.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had used the Truth of Three-Energy Construction when he fought against the Evil God, but the void construction was showy and not substantial. Thus it was not tactical to be used in defending against the enemy.</p>

  <p>A glimmer of surprise flashed across the Snake Goddess's eyes as she intently stared at the statue in Luo Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>Void construction could be accomplished with the help of some special Other Shore Tokens, and the things that were created this way were quite powerful. However, there was a huge limitation in this kind of void construction, which was far from what Luo Zheng had demonstrated.</p>

  <p>"If you're going to give me any information regarding the human race on the Other Shore, I will tell you the origin of this Truth of Divine Dao. That's not bad for a deal," Luo Zheng asserted.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had given his word to King Manard and wouldn't go back on it.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng finished speaking, he handed the statue to Yan.</p>

  <p>Yan held the statue in her hand and played with it for a while. The statue was very lifelike and she loved it so much.</p>

  <p>Seeing Luo Zheng was pretty determined, the Snake Goddess couldn't help pursing her lips.</p>

  <p>It had been many years since she last met a young man who could be so firm in what he wanted. For that, Luo Zheng really deserved the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed. He had such a firm character likened to the Lord of Weapons.</p>

  <p>As the wind blew, the sea of clouds in the distance billowed like waves. The Snake Goddess stood on the jadeite platform and looked at the panoramic view of the magnificent scenery.</p>

  <p>She looked into the distance and said, "The birth of humans in this round of chaos was planned."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's heart skipped a beat. It was the exact same thing that King Manard said.</p>

  <p>"Actually, not only humans but also super forces like the Ear Mice and the Separate Abyss race were planned to be born. If the Other Shore hadn't intervened in the development of the chaos, there should have already been a ruling civilization in this round of chaos."</p>

  <p>"A ruling civilization?"</p>

  <p>After going through so much, Luo Zheng had come to understand how powerful ruling civilizations could be.</p>

  <p>The Dreaded Eye Demons and the Green Jade Civilization, for example, used to be rulers in chaos.</p>

  <p>However, in the current chaos, there existed so many large races that not a single super force could rule the entire chaos. Thus, a ruling civilization didn't exist.</p>

  <p>"What kind of interference did you mean?" Luo Zheng asked as he became more curious.</p>

  <p>"It means that they forcibly introduced other civilizations that don't belong to this round of chaos. If it weren't for the existence of the Ear Mice, the Jin Wu, the Separate Abyss race, and the Snake Goddess race, the Celestial Wolf race would be the one ruling the chaos," the Snake Goddess finally revealed.</p>

  <p>"The Celestial Wolf race?" Luo Zheng's eyes narrowed in surprise. "How is that possible?"</p>

  <p>A while back, he had met the Celestial Wolf race in the Chaotic Source World. Although they truly were a large race, they were never considered as a super force.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess let out a faint smile. "Well, it's simple. It's because they were the designated ruling civilization in this chaos. Unfortunately, because of our existence, we completely suppressed them. Now, it's impossible for them to grow stronger," she replied.</p>

  <p>"They were the designated ruling civilization?" As he couldn't believe what he just heard, Luo Zheng asked No. 9527 in his mind, "How come you didn't know about this?"</p>

  <p>No. 9527 was a part of the Chaos Ancient God, a creature that had existed in the last round of chaos. That was why Luo Zheng became a little confused that it didn't know this piece of information.</p>

  <p>"You can't blame it. After all, it's just a soul avatar. It can't bear all of Gerald's memories," the Snake Goddess explained.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked at the Snake Goddess who was wearing a charming smile on her face. It was as gentle and innocent as that of a child and as shy and vivacious as that of a teenage girl. Moreover, she had the wisdom and the bearing of a goddess. Luo Zheng could just imagine a female's entire lifespan by just looking at her.</p>

  <p>"You? You are snooping on my soul," Luo Zheng uttered the words with an embarrassed expression.</p>

  <p>Both the Snake Goddess and King Manard didn't like it when there were people stealthily eavesdropping on them. King Manard even forced No. 9527 and the Green Jade Spirit out back then.</p>

  <p>"No, I am not. I just felt your consciousness fluctuation and read it," said the Snake Goddess softly.</p>

  <p>"The Snake Goddess can read one's spiritual sense and messages conveyed through life vitality," Yan reminded her brother.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess could even read one's memories if she wanted to, but she wouldn't do that to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"In the ancient times of this chaos, there was only one human force.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the birth of this very human force was indeed related to me and my brother."</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess's eyes began to glow, as if she had returned to the memories of those savage days. Back then, the chaos was newly created and people didn't know much about the primitive land.</p>

  <p>And the "brother" that she was referring to was Fuxi.</p>
