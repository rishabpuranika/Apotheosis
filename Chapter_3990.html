  <p>
</p>

  <p>It was already dusk and the village was being engulfed by darkness little by little.</p>

  <p>Earlier, some rays of light were strongly shooting into the thatched hut. But as the sun went down, the small hut was also enveloped in darkness.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, everyone possessed good eyes that they could still use to see their surroundings clearly, even in the pitch darkness.</p>

  <p>"Waah! Waah!"</p>

  <p>Soon after, loud howls were heard outside.</p>

  <p>Just then, a ball of light was seen not far away. It was so bright that everyone could see it even through the thick thatches of the hut.</p>

  <p>"Cover your ears quickly!" Fuxi ordered urgently.</p>

  <p>Just after the ball of light appeared, piercing screams resounded. "Waah!</p>

  <p>Waah!"</p>

  <p>After a while, the screams stopped.</p>

  <p>"So, that's a Treacherous Being?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi asked as he pointed at the ball of light seen roaming outside.</p>

  <p>When they looked through the thatches, they found that the ball of light had a rather irregular shape and that the piercing screams actually came from it.</p>

  <p>"That's right. It seems that they have begun to move," the Snake Goddess replied with a nod.</p>

  <p>While they were still conversing, another Treacherous Being appeared from the distance.</p>

  <p>And like the first one, it also let out shrilling screams.</p>

  <p>As time passed by, more and more Treacherous Beings appeared.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, they were still able to bear the head-splitting howls, but as the Treacherous Beings grew larger in number, the howls seemed to be endless and it was as if their energies were being drained.</p>

  <p>Soon, their faces contorted badly and turned blue as they became distressed.</p>

  <p>"Is it going to continue for the whole night?" Luo Zheng asked in a low voice, holding his aching head.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess smiled bitterly and said, "One thing is for sure, it's just the beginning. There is a division of labor among the Treacherous Beings.</p>

  <p>Every night, they will gather together and howl desperately. These deafening screams could actually be heard even from faraway places."</p>

  <p>The howls had been so terrifying. If ordinary people were on the receiving end, they would surely drive them crazy.</p>

  <p>This was because it wasn't just a simple howl, but an aggressive spiritual attack.</p>

  <p>"I don't think we can bear this for several hours. Is there something that we can do?" Ying asked with a livid face. Her heart was thumping so fast because of restlessness.</p>

  <p>"Destroy your hearing," Fuxi blurted out of nowhere. "We can still use our spiritual senses to communicate with each other. We just need to repair our hearing tomorrow morning."</p>

  <p>Fuxi's words made sense to everyone. Ying quickly raised her hands and stabbed her eardrums with her fingers.</p>

  <p>Her hearing was instantly destroyed as a stream of blood came out from her ears. Immediately after, her face relaxed and a clear expression of relief was seen.</p>

  <p>Without thinking twice, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, King Ieuan, the Wing King, and the three Eternal Realm Hunters also followed suit and stabbed their eardrums.</p>

  <p>It would be pretty easy for them to restore their damaged hearing afterward, so there was no point in enduring a senseless struggle. It was more accurate to say that they "turned off" their hearing rather than "destroyed them".</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, what about you? Can you still bear the howls?" The Snake Goddess asked as she took a glance at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'm fine," Luo Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>"You don't have to be stubborn. The Treacherous Beings' howls go against nature. They can make you collapse. You have to destroy your hearing before it takes a greater toll on you," the Snake Goddess warned.</p>

  <p>"Okay," Luo Zheng answered.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the last of the Treacherous Beings walked past the hut and let out a sharp howl. After this, the village fell into a brief silence again.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi and the others had already destroyed their hearing, so they didn't have any reaction to the sudden change in the surroundings.</p>

  <p>However, for Luo Zheng and the others that still had their normal hearing, the sudden tranquility didn't seem natural.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the silence didn't last for long.</p>

  <p>Through the thatches, they saw from a distance that the white balls of light were gathering again. In just a matter of seconds, the next wave of deafening howls resounded through the sky.</p>

  <p>Previously, the Treacherous Beings howled in rapid succession, but this time, they howled in groups. The sharpness was the same as before, but the power they contained was much stronger.</p>

  <p>"Woof?"</p>

  <p>The Augury Dog barked in a low voice and looked at Fuxi with a pitiful face.</p>

  <p>Fuxi then gently tapped the dog's ears with his fingers, and also damaged his hearing.</p>

  <p>It was the turn of Fuxi and the Snake Goddess to "turn off" their hearing.</p>

  <p>Before doing so, Fuxi turned to Luo Zheng again and said, "Why are you hesitating? Hurry up and just do it."</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng's endurance was much stronger than the others, he still felt tortured as the howls grew louder and louder.</p>

  <p>He decided to follow Fuxi and also stabbed his eardrums with his fingers.</p>

  <p>As he pierced his eardrums, a brief rumbling sound reverberated in his head. Then, the entire world surrounding him became quiet. There wasn't a single sound to be heard.</p>

  <p>However, just then, he felt a cool sensation hovering in his ears.</p>

  <p>Then, he realized that his hearing had completely recovered.</p>

  <p>This time, the ear-piercing howls sounded so much louder than before. It was as if the noise was drilling through his skull.</p>

  <p>When Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and the others saw Luo Zheng desperately holding his head with a facial expression of excruciating pain, they were shocked and confused.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, what's wrong?" the Snake Goddess asked through her spiritual sense.</p>

  <p>"My hearing is restored," Luo Zheng answered as he endured the pain he was experiencing.</p>

  <p>"What? How?" The Snake Goddess was bewildered at what just happened to him.</p>

  <p>Then, she started to realize that it must have something to do with his bloodline.</p>

  <p>'Don't tell me? The bloodline restored his hearing?' the Snake Goddess thought as she narrowed her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Waah! Waah!"</p>

  <p>The Treacherous Beings outside once again let out a wave of high-pitched howls which seemed to be ten times louder than before.</p>

  <p>The piercing screams started to mess up Luo Zheng's mind, so he stabbed his ears and destroyed his hearing. In an instant, he became deaf again.</p>

  <p>Just when he thought that there was silence again, his hearing was restored at a faster rate this time.</p>

  <p>The howls resounded in his ears again.</p>

  <p>"Damn it! Again!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stabbed his ears again.</p>

  <p>However, this time, his hearing was restored before he even felt the pain of stabbing himself in his ears.</p>

  <p>When everyone saw him repeatedly stabbing his ears, they were confused and worried. They used their spiritual senses to ask the Snake Goddess about what happened. After knowing what happened, they were rendered speechless, and they looked at Luo Zheng with sympathy.</p>

  <p>After stabbing his own ears for over a hundred times, Luo Zheng finally chose to give up and just let the howls resound in his ears.</p>

  <p>Currently, the ancestry-level bloodline was still unable to replace him.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, it wouldn't need such a troublesome method to make him suffer.</p>

  <p>However, there must be other reasons for it to do so.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng gritted his teeth and sat with his legs crossed. He gathered his resolve and wore a serious face.</p>

  <p>Since he couldn't avoid hearing the howls, he had no choice but to do his best to bear them.</p>

  <p>Neither Fuxi nor the Snake Goddess knew how devastating the Treacherous Beings' howls could be. Every night, they would destroy their hearing before they experienced a much more intense level of the howls.</p>

  <p>An hour hadn't even passed but the intense pain had already been unbearable for Luo Zheng. The entire night would last for twenty hours. That meant his suffering would be unimaginable.</p>

  <p>While everyone was staring at Luo Zheng with a worried face, they still maintained sharp vigilance.</p>

  <p>If the Treacherous Beings found out where they were hiding, it meant immediate death for them.</p>

  <p>They also had to keep watch on Luo Zheng. If the moment came that he wasn't able to control himself and started wreaking havoc because of the pain, they would need to stop him at all costs.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Luo Zheng's pain and suffering only lasted for about four hours. As the painful expression on Luo Zheng's face gradually disappeared, it was replaced by a suspicious look.</p>

  <p>He knew that there was something wrong going on. The howls had changed and turned into low chanting sounds.</p>
