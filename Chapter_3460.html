<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>



  <p>
</p>

  <p>The cyan light spread out from Zheng and mixed in with the strangely-colored world summoned by the Evil God. Soon enough, the area started to change.</p>

  <p>The rough, brownish-yellow ground became extremely smooth, and it seemed that a layer of emerald green glaze covered its surface. The Regal Jade Crystals were like precious ores as they grew and formed jade flowers.</p>

  <p>The strangely-colored world was shone brightly by the cyan light, which made the space more strange and unique, and possess a peculiar clean feel to it.</p>

  <p>A second world had descended! The two different worlds merged together!</p>

  <p>Everyone present were stunned as they looked around with awe in their faces.</p>

  <p>"Another world?"</p>

  <p>"This is too crazy! Did Zheng make this?"</p>

  <p>"Is Zheng also the spokesperson of a civilization?"</p>

  <p>Even the leaders at the gate of the Chaotic Source World were also speechless and dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>After all, the current situation in the Chaotic Source World was completely beyond their imagination.</p>

  <p>Everyone should be able to exert their own abilities to dig out the Chaotic Source Spirits, and then reach the Chaotic Source Realm.</p>

  <p>Yet at that moment, everyone's attention was not on the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits, but on Zheng and the Evil God.</p>

  <p>When Winchell saw the cyan light shine brightly and the world descend, he felt slightly relieved.</p>

  <p>If Dorothy had really died in the Chaotic Source World, then a storm would arise on the Origin Mountain. Given Yasamin's strong-headed attitude, it was very likely that she would hunt the Black Ship on her own.</p>

  <p>"What a surprise!" As soon as Fuxi saw the cyan light world as well, his lips stretched into a helpless smile. "It seems that in addition to Gerald, there is another civilization that has chosen you. I wonder where this civilization ranks," he murmured to himself.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, there were a lot of civilizations that hid on the Other Shore. Some of them were strong, and some were weak. All of them were vastly different from each other.</p>

  <p>The civilizations ranked outside the top 100 were weaker, and those ranked far behind were quite frail. However, undoubtedly, the top 100 civilizations were quite powerful.</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade Civilization hadn't left many footprints on the Other Shore, and even their Regal Jade Temple had once been destroyed. Since the civilization had been hiding in Stage Thirteen of the Other Shore, no one present had recognized the origin of such a world.</p>

  <p>That was why Fuxi had no idea that the Regal Jade Civilization was as powerful as the top ten civilizations!</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Mount gazed at the beams of cyan light that charged towards him. His blank, emotionless face finally changed and he didn't know if he should laugh or cry. He had thought that Zheng would definitely lose, but things went on differently. It was out of his expectation.</p>

  <p>More to his surprise, Zheng was able to summon a world!</p>

  <p>"For some special reasons, I didn't want to summon this world, nor did I want to use the Inheritance of World," Zheng spoke.</p>

  <p>His voice suddenly sounded quite ethereal, like it had come from a distant cave sometimes far away, then sometimes very close.</p>

  <p>Ever since he had fused with the Civilization Artifact, he had realized that he was able to summon a Regal Jade World and even greatly strengthen himself by using the Inheritance of World. That was the support from a civilization, not just a Regal Jade chessboard.</p>

  <p>Yet, once he had used that ability, it would cause a huge sensation. Thus, Zheng had never tried using it previously.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the Regal Jade Spirit had reminded him that there was still the hostility between them and the Nihility race. Had it not been for the fact that he had no other choice, he would've tried his best not to reveal the Civilization Artifact. Therefore, Zheng had kept it up to the last moment.</p>

  <p>It was only when Dorothy was about to sacrifice herself, that he summoned this Regal Jade World.</p>

  <p>Rumble!</p>

  <p>A Regal Jade Crystal grew from a thorn on the ground. It gently lifted Dorothy up as it grew, then stretched up to a distance of several thousand feet, before it sent her to the other side.</p>

  <p>Then, another Regal Jade Crystal grew from the crater and slowly lifted Zheng up.</p>

  <p>"I gave you freedom, because I wanted you to watch the world carefully.</p>

  <p>You are a great talent, and you are entitled to ask for what you want from the world. Unfortunately, you're greedy and bloodthirsty, which greatly disappointed me..."</p>

  <p>As Zheng spoke, he gently did a tapping motion towards the Evil God. A Regal Jade Crystal suddenly grew out of the ground and hit the Evil God hard.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>As the Evil God's body was thrown into the air, another Regal Jade Crystal stretched out of the ground and hit him again.</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade Crystals grew out of the ground and extended up to thousands of feet, and repeatedly hit the Evil God.</p>

  <p>The Evil God could have avoided such attacks, but he didn't have the slightest intention of dodging. He just allowed the Regal Jade Crystals to hit him.</p>

  <p>Upon closer observation, it could be seen that the Evil God's face was full of excitement and ecstasy.</p>

  <p>Ever since Zheng had entered the Chaotic Source World, his weakness had been the Evil God's greatest disappointment. But after another world had descended, Zheng had finally shown the strength that made him worthy to be his opponent!</p>

  <p>After the Evil God had been hit dozens of time, bones spurred out of his arms and intertwined around him at a confusing speed. All the Regal Jade Crystals that hit him broke into pieces and fell on the ground.</p>

  <p>"Save your tricks," said the Evil God.</p>

  <p>In turn, Zheng glanced coldly at him. The Regal Jade Crystals under his feet started to grow again. This time, they didn't lift him up, but wrapped him inside them.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Just then, a halo appeared around the entire Regal Jade World.</p>

  <p>The light circle shrank continuously until it converged in the center, and finally merged in Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Next, another light circle flashed on the surfaces of all the Regal Jade Crystals and quickly gathered in the center as well.</p>

  <p>With the support of the Regal Jade World, Zheng was indeed able to contend with the Evil God.</p>

  <p>To defeat the Evil God, however, he had to use the Inheritance of World.</p>

  <p>Now, Zheng was unwilling to waste his time either.</p>

  <p>As the light circles converged, his body had undergone considerable changes.</p>

  <p>First, his eyebrows glittered with dark cyan crystals, then so did his hair, skin, and flesh.</p>

  <p>The Inheritance of World entailed changing oneself completely by the use of the power of the descended world.</p>

  <p>While Zheng endured the baptism of cyan light circles, his entire body became thoroughly crystalized!</p>

  <p>Cyan feathers grew from his back one after another. He slightly opened his eyes, and diamond-shaped crystals also appeared in his pupils.</p>

  <p>At that moment, his aura had also undergone a tremendous change. Apart from his appearance that was still fifty percent similar to his original look, everything else was different. His voice, breath, and the characteristics that defined him all disappeared!</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>He shook his body slightly, then the crystals wrapped around him shattered.</p>

  <p>His dark cyan feathers rose slightly, which made him glide freely in midair as if he had integrated himself with the space.</p>

  <p>The members of the Separate Abyss race, the Ear Mice, and disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace and the Pear Hill could only look up at him in silence.</p>

  <p>"Is he Yan's brother?! The way Yan described his strength is an understatement!" exclaimed Natalie, whose jaw dropped in shock.</p>
