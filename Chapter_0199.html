<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 199 The Attack From The Demon (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>To avoid making the same mistake of the imperial army protecting the Heaven Tower and Earth Tower alone, all of White Emperor City's people took it upon themselves to act accordingly. They dared not lower their guard and seriously took the demon's attack.</p>

  <p>"The four demon kings who attack the White Emperor City this time are very strong, especially Aldrich and Oceiros. The power of these two demon kings is currently unknown and unfathomable. If the war starts, I suggest that some of us try to hinder Aldrich...." Spencer continued and recommended some guys among them. All the officers, especially those who were mentioned listened attentively.</p>

  <p>As he spoke, Spencer gently pressed his hand flat before him on the tabletop. Then, in the middle of the table appeared some screen pictures.</p>

  <p>The said table was a huge Picture Slab. Displayed on the slab were the names of the four demon kings, and their respective strengths and weaknesses.</p>

  <p>Based on this information, they started to discuss and work out their plan of action. Suddenly, Spencer's face changed, and his lips curved up into a wry smile. "It seems the meeting couldn't continue. I felt a few giant evil spirits flying straight to the White Emperor City!"</p>

  <p>He didn't have to explain anything further. All of them knew that the huge, incoming evil spirits must be from the four strong demon kings Spencer had just talked about.</p>

  <p>"In that case, let's just knock them down first!" an old man said. He had been standing nearby and hadn't said a word the whole time, until now.</p>

  <p>Spencer nodded in agreement and said, "Let's get ready and fight!"</p>

  <p>All of them obeyed Spencer's order and stood up to get ready. They dashed quickly out of the room, and some of them flew out from the roof of the governor's house like fast streams of light.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Yolande did not move and stood in her original place. After a while, she too flew out with a tilt of the head, as if to remember something. But instead of flying through the roof opening, she rushed out through the house door and hovered low on the ground's rocky surface.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Luo Zheng and the military officers with him walked not too far away.</p>

  <p>"You have to wait in the office these days when the demon attacks the city. Don't worry. I can see that the governor doesn't want to make trouble for you," one of the officers said.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng heard the words of the officer, he nodded his head. It was better than staying with Yolande, regardless of where he went. It was really difficult for Luo Zheng to stay with Yolande as his body suffered to the point of curling up limply for a long time. He'd rather die when he thought about this possibility.</p>

  <p>But suddenly, Luo Zheng heard a whistling wind behind him. His heart pounded nervously. His sense of danger prompted him to turn around and look, and there he saw Yolande flying towards him. Before Luo Zheng and the officers were even able to react, Yolande stretched out her little fist and punched Luo Zheng in the belly.</p>

  <p>Although Yolande looked light, with a weight of less than a hundred pounds, her fist was really powerful and packed a punch.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng's body was like spiritual weapon, the strong assault of Yolande's fist made him curl inward like a shrimp. The pain began to spread from his lower belly throughout his body.</p>

  <p>"Pock! Pock! Pock!"</p>

  <p>A few transparent enchanted barriers covered Luo Zheng once again and pinned him down on the ground.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing Luo Zheng trapped again in the enchanted barriers, one of the officers who escorted Luo Zheng shot Yolande a disapproving look and said,</p>

  <p>"Yolande, it is the governor's order to keep Luo Zheng in the Military Office.</p>

  <p>What are you going to do?"</p>

  <p>"I felt worried about this man. It's better for him to stay with me,"</p>

  <p>Yolande replied simply in return.</p>

  <p>"But Yolande, the demon is attacking the city now. Are you sure you want to take this guy with you? How could you deal with those demon kings with such a burden?" one of the officials said. The official refused to give up and still wanted to persuade Yolande not to take Luo Zheng away.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, he did not know what feedback to report to Spencer.</p>

  <p>"This is none of your business!" Yolande shrieked, stretching out her hand and waving towards Luo Zheng. Both of them hovered above the ground, and instantly flew away. Yolande flew deftly like a swift fairy and controlled the direction of Zheng's flight.</p>

  <p>"Ah......!" the sound of Zheng's yell echoed loudly and then became distant bit by bit, as their flying figures began to disappear in the sky.</p>

  <p>Up high in the atmosphere, Luo Zheng felt the sky and earth spin around in his vision and he saw White Emperor City below him. It became smaller and smaller until it was a tiny speck on the ground. They flew quite fast that they were already thousands of feet above the ground in a short time.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng turned back to face Yolande. He wanted to scold this woman severely. However, considering that she didn't care about anything, it would be useless to scold her. Luo Zheng decided to shut his mouth when he thought of this. Since right now he was like a delicate fish on the chopping block, he could only bear whatever Yolande wanted to do with him.</p>

  <p>As they rose to a higher altitude, Luo Zheng could see the edges of the whole White Emperor City became ablaze with fiery red flames, and countless black spots began to rise up towards the city wall.</p>

  <p>The black spots turned out to be fleets of demon soldiers and demon generals attacking the city.</p>

  <p>Among the masses of dark figures, huge bursts of fiery flames continuously bombed everywhere. The imperial army's firing catapults and firing cannons sent balls of explosions to counterattack against the demon horde.</p>

  <p>"Have the disciples of Drizzle Peak been evacuated or not?' Luo Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>He was deeply worried for his companions when he saw the horrible battlefield below. While the White Emperor City had never been broken through, there was so much uncertainty now. Even though the White Emperor City wasn't occupied, the strength of Drizzle Peak's disciples wasn't that strong enough and it was hard to ensure their own safety in combat.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was still thinking of Drizzle Peak's disciples when he heard the sound of a tightly drawn bowstring, followed by a "t'chi, t'chi, t'chi" puff.</p>

  <p>It was the sound of arrows being continuously shot from the longbows that greeted his ears.</p>

  <p>The arrows apparently came from a flock of demon birds, who were just beside Luo Zheng and made him their target.</p>

  <p>However, he did not worry at all when he saw the arrows coming at him.</p>

  <p>He did not know what kind of material the transparent enchanted barriers were made of, but seeing that his strength couldn't even break them, those arrows should have no impact on him and the barriers.</p>

  <p>"Twang! Twang! Twang!"</p>

  <p>Just as he expected, the arrows that were fired onto the enchanted barriers didn't leave any traces of damage. They all simply slid downward against its transparent surface.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Yolande flew above Luo Zheng. Her snow-white dress billowed like a floating cloud around her. Her long, straight legs loomed below her dress, and her wooden clogs felt shaky on her feet. It seemed that the clogs would fall any moment now, but they still clung on to her feet.</p>

  <p>The demon birds targeted her too, but the arrows all seemed to hit an invisible wall around her and fell down uselessly to the ground.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a faint light gleamed through the whites of her eyes.</p>

  <p>She squinted her eyes in response. No one knew what kind of thing she had done. However, the transparent enchanted barriers around her body seemed to burst into pieces and began spread out. The fragments of the invisible wall broke into irregular shapes like triangles and circles. An invisible force pushed them towards the demon birds and scattered around them like crystal clear raindrops.</p>

  <p>"Swish! Swish! Swish!"</p>

  <p>The fragments immediately stabbed the demon birds. The crystal-like formations hacked the demons' bodies into pieces, their wings and other parts falling down in rapid succession.</p>

  <p>"Clang-quack-clang-quack..."</p>

  <p>Many demon birds burst into a shrill cry. They were even lucky to have had screamed out as most of them were instantly sliced and killed into pieces, their scaly limbs falling down to the battlefield below.</p>

  <p>The sight of the falling demon birds made Luo Zheng shake his head. He took an almost gleeful delight in seeing the demon birds killed violently by Yolande. "Oh, demon birds, why didn't you find another rival instead?</p>

  <p>Why did you choose to provoke Yolande. You even did not have chance to fight!' he thought, and it made his heart feel somewhat happy.</p>
