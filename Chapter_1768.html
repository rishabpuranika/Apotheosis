  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng frowned. He had already waited for a really long time but there was still no response from Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, has Master Ning ascended as well?" Tianming asked. He had ascended before her so he naturally did not know what happened in the Central Region after his departure.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'm sure she has ascended?"</p>

  <p>"Heaven rewards the good. Master Ning is a good person. Moreover, the sorcerer race does not have the strength to challenge the Humanity Alliance. She'll be fine?" Tianming said in an attempt to console him, though he had no idea why Luo Luo Zheng was so sure that Ning Yudie had also ascended.</p>

  <p>"Yes! Ning Yudie will be okay!" Mu Ning followed, also trying to ease his worries. At this moment, she didn't dare to say anything that would annoy him.</p>

  <p>The others were quick to understand that this Ning Yudie was an extremely important person to him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng thought for a moment before turning to Master Feng. "I need to go and find someone."</p>

  <p>Master Feng was just about to make some arrangements for them but it seemed Luo Luo Zheng was in no way willing to participate.</p>

  <p>The old man also noticed the worry in his eyes. "You are going to look for the girl named Ning Yudie?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded. "Yes. I'm sorry but she's my wife."</p>

  <p>Mu Ning couldn't help but feel a pang of hurt when she heard Luo Luo Zheng refer to Ning Yudie as his "wife." Although she referred to Luo Luo Zheng as her husband, she was not officially married to him?</p>

  <p>"Does she have any unique features?" Master Feng inquired.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords in this universe possessed extremely powerful calculation abilities.</p>

  <p>However, they were not necessarily omnipotent.</p>

  <p>There were only 128 Crowns of Destiny. When a Crown of Destiny appeared in the universe, there was a high probability for Supreme Lords to perceive its location because of its uniqueness. That was the reason why so many of them swarmed towards Luo Luo Zheng when he activated a Crown of Destiny back then.</p>

  <p>A Supreme Lord could locate the whereabouts of any warrior using their calculations but this would be extremely hard without any knowledge of the characteristics and important identifiers of the person being sought.</p>

  <p>There were too many living creatures in this universe after all.</p>

  <p>Master Feng's willingness to help ignited the hope in Luo Zheng's heart.</p>

  <p>"She is an ascended warrior from the Lower World and she may have arrived not long ago?" Before entering the Illusion Battlefield, Luo Luo Zheng took the liberty of going through the memories of the great world's will.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie was still in the great world at the time but she promptly disappeared upon his departure from the Illusion Battlefield. That meant she must have ascended.</p>

  <p>Those were the only clues Luo Luo Zheng could offer and Master Feng frowned at the scarcity of information. This was going to be a bit difficult since she did not have any obvious or unique features to help narrow down his search. In other words, this was going to be like looking for a needle in a haystack.</p>

  <p>"Let me read your soul then?" Xenia, who was beside Tianming, offered.</p>

  <p>"Read my soul?" Luo Luo Zheng repeated, a bit stunned at her proposal.</p>

  <p>The soul searching technique normally caused irreversible damage to one's soul but it was an option Luo Luo Zheng had already considered to pinpoint Yudie's location in the event that they were unable to think of any other solution.</p>

  <p>However, he wasn't aware that there was another method known as the soul reading technique.</p>

  <p>A few select people possessed the ability to read souls in this universe.</p>

  <p>The Saint Lord of the Pure Jade Sacred Place, for example, had the ability to verify the truth of Yudie's statements without causing her any harm.</p>

  <p>Xenia also possessed such ability and hers was even more advanced.</p>

  <p>Hearing her explanation of her technique, Luo Luo Zheng did not show any bit of hesitation in accepting her proposal.</p>

  <p>Sure, he had a few secrets he wouldn't want others to know but Luo Luo Zheng did not really have the luxury to care about such things. Finding Ning Yudie was a paramount concern at that moment.</p>

  <p>Xenia walked in front of Luo Luo Zheng and stared up at him with her delicate eyes.</p>

  <p>She curled her little and ring fingers on both her hands and then reached out. Her thumbs, index and middle fingers were pressed against Luo Zheng's temples. "Try your best to think about... Yudie's features."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng closed his eyes and did as she said.</p>

  <p>Xenia closed her eyes as well. Slowly, strings of lightning segments began to appear on her hands and spiral all the way towards Luo Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>The lightning power entangled and rose from Luo Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>Her soul reading technique was way superior compared to other people's.</p>

  <p>She could use lightning to draw out the memories she had to read.</p>

  <p>However, this wasn't anything special. It was only an extension of nature. A warrior, so long as they mastered the spiritual projection method, could use life vitality to perfectly duplicate whatever they visualized. This wasn't very difficult for Xenia who was already a high-level warrior.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, Yudie's exquisite figure gradually appeared and floated above Luo Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>"Master Feng, please calculate as soon as possible," Xenia said, still with her eyes closed.</p>

  <p>Master Feng stared at Yudie's appearance and nodded in affirmation. He held out a wrinkled finger where many colorful beads began to burst forth.</p>

  <p>The beads were the size of a fingertip and were extremely colorful, like stars floating in the universe.</p>

  <p>The calculation methods of each person varied. There was the Purple Star Astrology, the Eight Diagrams, and the Ten Heavenly Stems and Twelve Earthly Branches. However, Master Feng's method of calculation was rather unique. It was called the "Fantasy Star Calculation Technique".</p>

  <p>He was looking for Ning Yudie: a newly ascended female warrior from the Lower World.</p>

  <p>These were the only clues Master Feng could work with but Xenia's visualization of Yudie's physical features was of great help to him. His calculations were sped up since he now knew what she looked like.</p>

  <p>After a few moments, a strange expression appeared on Master Feng's face.</p>

  <p>"How is it?" Luo Luo Zheng asked, seeing the anxious expression on the old man's face.</p>

  <p>"This woman has indeed encountered some trouble. It seems that the sorcerer race have invaded the supreme world she is in," he replied.</p>

  <p>"Which supreme world? Is she injured?" Luo Luo Zheng asked. After finding out her current situation, he really wanted to rush to her side as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>"The Pure Jade Sacred Place of the Humanity Alliance. But?" Master Feng paused. Luo Luo Zheng planned to use the Teleportation Token to instantly travel to where she was but he waited until Master Feng finished what he had to say.</p>

  <p>"It seems she is planning to go back to the Lower World soon to take refuge there."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes flashed. "Go back to the great world?"</p>

  <p>Tianming's eyes brightened. "This is indeed a good idea!"</p>

  <p>Now knowing where Ning Yudie was, Luo Luo Zheng finally felt slightly at ease.</p>

  <p>It was fortunate for him that both Xenia and Master Feng were willing to help him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was already quite dissatisfied with the Celestial Position though he knew that the race had no intention of harming him. They just tried their best to hide vital information away from him.</p>

  <p>"Something's not right. There seems to be something following them into the ascending passageway," Master Feng continued. "Why is the sorcerer race chasing after these people..."</p>

  <p>His words caused Luo Zheng's heart to beat nervously. "Can you calculate which great world they're heading to?"</p>

  <p>He had already seen the entirety of the universe through the use of his Teleportation Token. He knew for a fact that the ascending passageways of each supreme world were connected to many great worlds below and he needed to know their position before he could set off.</p>

  <p>Master Feng nodded and immediately resumed his calculations. After a few moments, he was able to come up with the conclusion that Ning Yudie was going to be returning to the great world she originally came from.</p>

  <p>However, it would take over ten days to travel in the ascending passageway before they could reach the Lower World.</p>
