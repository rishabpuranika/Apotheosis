<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3379 Pouring Out </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The hurricane swirled, the black smog within it looking dangerous as it went.</p>

  <p>In the hurricane, two Divine Lair women spread out their wings and began to fly downwind.</p>

  <p>They couldn't ignore the power of this hurricane, but they could sometimes control their direction and the distance they covered as they flew downwind.</p>

  <p>The first woman's eyes flashed before she turned to the other and said,</p>

  <p>"Brylee, Did you feel that?"</p>

  <p>"Yes." Brylee nodded. "If my memory serves me right, it should be a member of the Lofty Mountain race who sent out the signal."</p>

  <p>"Your memory is good, Brylee," Lesly said with a smile. "The key is that Zheng guy is right there."</p>

  <p>Her voice had turned cold with hatred at the mention of Zheng's name.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth wasn't the strongest among the warriors in the Sun Crow race but every woman in the Divine Lair had the utmost respect for her.</p>

  <p>And Zheng had committed the unforgivable sin of offending Elizabeth.</p>

  <p>The Bearing race had included Zheng in the kill list. They would kill every warrior they thought might be Tianxing. So irrespective of whether or not Zheng was Tianxing, they would kill him in the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>The Sun Crow race hated Zheng even more because they respected Elizabeth greatly.</p>

  <p>"Should we go there?" Brylee asked.</p>

  <p>"Of course! He's not that far away. Also, someone else will be joining us,"</p>

  <p>Lesly replied. She paused before continuing, "The hurricane is still blowing, and many people can't move in this situation. But once the hurricane stops, a lot of people will approach him. The target will probably take shelter somewhere or hide in some cave."</p>

  <p>Saying thus, Lesly spread out her golden wings and took off, closely followed by Brylee.</p>

  <p>Inside the cave...</p>

  <p>Zheng had finally managed to kill all the ants that had emerged from the pillar.</p>

  <p>But Chaim and the others were still scared of approaching the pillar.</p>

  <p>Zheng had only managed to kill a small number of the ants. There were more where they had emerged from. And no one wanted to risk their lives before the ants were cleared out.</p>

  <p>The ants, that had emitted red light from the holes of the pillar, were now hiding so that the people standing outside couldn't see them.</p>

  <p>"They are not coming out?"</p>

  <p>Zheng said, confused, looking into the holes that were now pitch dark. He couldn't see anything, try as he might.</p>

  <p>But when he used his spiritual sense to try and perceive what was going on in there, he found that something in the stone pillar was blocking his spiritual sense.</p>

  <p>It didn't matter if the ants weren't coming out. Zheng wasn't about to show them any mercy.</p>

  <p>He took a step back and a short pause later, he suddenly pulled out the power of the Strength God Totem in a mighty burst. As the surging power gathered at his fist, he threw a punch at the stone pillar.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The Chaotic Source Spirits hidden in the stone pillar completely absorbed the power of his punch. The pillar shook slightly before returning to normal.</p>

  <p>Zheng might have failed in his attempt to break the pillar, but he wasn't discouraged.</p>

  <p>The stronger this pillar was, the higher the number of Chaotic Source Spirits there were in it.</p>

  <p>He would reap more benefits when the pillar finally broke.</p>

  <p>Dong!</p>

  <p>Dong!</p>

  <p>Dong!</p>

  <p>Zheng punched the stone pillar again and again, the Other Shore Power he was releasing in the process becoming more powerful with each punch.</p>

  <p>Chaim was amazed at the power in Zheng's fist. No wonder Zheng was the champion of the Seven Mountains Meeting. Chaim wondered which level his sword skill had reached.</p>

  <p>Zheng's punches were powerful but they weren't strong enough to break the defense of so many Chaotic Source Spirits gathered together.</p>

  <p>As he continued to punch the pillar, a dull sound reverberated around them.</p>

  <p>Sally's Iridescent Stone smashed into the stone pillar.</p>

  <p>Zheng turned and found Sally nodding at him, smiling. She then reached out, causing the Iridescent Stone to fly back to her.</p>

  <p>She didn't dare approach the pillar but she could still help Zheng.</p>

  <p>A member of the Celestial Wolf race had also summoned his own Other Shore Token, a dark gray spear that probably came from a race on the Other Shore since it was not naturally formed. It was exquisite and seemed to have been carved from a special material.</p>

  <p>This member of the Celestial Wolf race didn't want to be left behind, given that Sally was also helping Zheng to break the pillar.</p>

  <p>If he contributed his strength right now, he could demand a share of the Chaotic Source Spirits when the pillar finally broke.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The member of the Celestial Wolf race threw the spear. It whistled as it cut through the air before stabbing the pillar.</p>

  <p>Snap!</p>

  <p>The pillar trembled, but the spear failed to make even a small mark on it.</p>

  <p>This was why the Chaotic Source Spirits were deemed powerful.</p>

  <p>No one was able to hurt them before the Chaotic Source Spirits had gotten tired. These Chaotic Source Spirits could help the Chaotic Source Realm warriors to absorb any harm that came their way. The stone pillar was obviously a Chaotic Source Realm master.</p>

  <p>As Zheng, Sally, and the member of the Celestial Wolf race took turns to attack the pillar, the ants were no longer flying out of the holes, which caused the other creatures to become braver.</p>

  <p>Even if they didn't have the descending type of Other Shore Tokens, they could still use other methods to launch an attack. And even though their attacks weren't too powerful, as the saying went, "When everybody adds fuel, the flames rise high." Everybody was trying their best to help.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Dong! Dong! Dong!</p>

  <p>For one wild moment, everyone began to display different kinds of theurgies and rumbling noises echoed throughout the cave.</p>

  <p>The attacks from the crowd lasted for about three minutes. The ants hiding in the stone pillar couldn't stand it anymore.</p>

  <p>Red dots of light emerged from the fist-sized holes.</p>

  <p>The warriors became vigilant as they saw the red light that the ferocious ants were releasing. Chaim said, "Everyone! Be careful. Run!"</p>

  <p>Chaim had barely finished warning everyone when the ants came pouring out of the stone pillar, flying in all directions. There were probably thousands of them.</p>

  <p>Most of the ants came to surround Zheng, taking him as their first target, since he was nearest the pillar.</p>

  <p>But several hundred ants had scattered and they went flying towards Chaim and the other warriors. Chaim retreated abruptly, trying to escape the cave.</p>

  <p>They weren't like Zheng, who could stand there and resist being bitten by the ants.</p>

  <p>They'd be doomed if the fierce ants were to bite them.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh...</p>

  <p>The warriors of the Celestial Wolf race and several other nonhuman creatures began to run towards the entrance of the cave alongside Sally.</p>

  <p>They might not be as afraid of these ants in the open space outside.</p>

  <p>But as Chaim walked along the rugged path in the cave, the howling of the wind stirred a bad premonition within him.</p>

  <p>The moment he arrived at the entrance of the cave, the hurricane poured in, blowing him aside and smashing him into the wall.</p>

  <p>It was now blocking the cave's exit.</p>

  <p>With their strength, it would be next to impossible for them to go up against the wind.</p>

  <p>The warriors' hearts sank at this sight.</p>

  <p>Behind them, the wings of the ants vibrated and hummed. If they couldn't get out of the cave, all of them would die here today.</p>
