<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The fiery evil spirits could be divided into various kinds. The ones living in the Sea of Raging Fire weren't really big, but as for this one in the furnace, it was considerably stronger than the typical fiery evil spirits.</p>

  <p>Even a small fiery dragon spirit which was as big as a man's arm had been condensed from the flames. When it went higher up, the heat that was radiating from it was so insufferable. But as luck would have it, the ice phoenix which had just been released by Tia from her precious gem was just as powerful.</p>

  <p>As a result, the fiery dragon spirit and the ice phoenix got tangled up with each other, binding and resisting the other. Ice is capable of obliterating fire, while fire, on the other hand, could also melt ice.</p>

  <p>For every instance that the ice phoenix descended onto the dragon, the heat and light emanating from the fiery dragon spirit seemed to be weakening a little bit. But in that same moment, flame suddenly rose from the furnace, and once it had coalesced into the dragon's body, the heat and light would both be restored in no time.</p>

  <p>And each time the fire dragon spirit set off for an attack, the ice crystals over the ice phoenix's body got thawed a little, and the phoenix gradually decreased in size.</p>

  <p>When she noticed that the melting of the ice phoenix had already reached a certain point, Tia instinctively grabbed her precious jade and stroked it with her candle-like fingers. Then, a cold air condensed using the life vitality began to drift away. When the cold air reached the body of the ice phoenix, the phoenix would dramatically increase in size in an instant.</p>

  <p>The battle between the ice phoenix and the fiery dragon spirit appeared to have reached an impasse. The ice phoenix had Tia's help in replenishing the cold air, while the fiery dragon spirit also had help, for as long as the flame in the furnace didn't die out, the fiery dragon spirit wouldn't die just as well.</p>

  <p>"While I'm fighting against this fiery dragon spirit, you should go ahead and find a way to break the enchanted barrier," Tia relayed over to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"The enchanted barrier?" Luo Zheng asked under his breath.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, he saw a blanket of dull purple light materialize around the stove. The stove was located in the farthest depths of the body of the flood dragon puppet, and there were several protections surrounding it.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng began thinking what Tia said was true. If this crystal key was not of great importance, then why would there be a need for placing multiple layers of protection?</p>

  <p>Clenching his fist, Luo Zheng then hit the enchanted barrier as hard as he could, channeling the strength from the dragon scales he had with him.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The sound that was emitted by Zheng's fist striking the enchanted barrier seemed as if he had actually hit an iron wall and the barrier still remained unscathed.</p>

  <p>"Relying on your physical strength alone wouldn't be able to cut it," Tia remarked. "This isn't just any common enchanted barrier, it has been constructed utilizing the force of space, so basically, it's actually a thin compressed layer of space."</p>

  <p>Tia's explanation left Luo Zheng completely dumbfounded. "You mean to say, what I have to do is to break a thin layer of space? Just how am I supposed to pull that off? I hope you're not forgetting that the Internal Elixir Realm is not my specialty."</p>

  <p>Putting a crack on that thin blanket of space would be quite hard even for a cultivator at the Internal Elixir Realm, shattering it, even more so.</p>

  <p>Although, it could be possible if a cultivator at a higher level within this realm gave it a shot.</p>

  <p>"Stop overthinking things! Of course, it's not an actual enchanted barrier of space, since the space has just been compressed to a very thin sheet. If it was really an enchanted barrier made from space, there's no way I would have bothered coming here in the first place, because then I'd just be wasting my time from trying to do the impossible."</p>

  <p>Truth be told, she originally intended to have Frank break the enchanted barrier using his spear. Frank was the best among the warriors she had met prior to that point.</p>

  <p>The spear's capacity to penetrate something had the greatest force compared to every other weapon. Furthermore, the Spear of Annihilation, the skill which Frank had mastered, had immense power that it had the greatest potential to penetrate the enchanted barrier. Down the line, however, Tia realized that it would be best to choose Luo Zheng instead, because he had already cultivated the Heavenly Ogre Fist, an ability which could let him transform the life vitality an immeasurable number of times. And she, fortunately, possessed such an enormous amount of life vitality that could easily be transferred to him.</p>

  <p>"This would be the best time to make use of your Heavenly Ogre Fist!</p>

  <p>I'm going to transfer my life vitality to you," she instructed. Then, a stream of pure, thick life vitality began pouring toward Luo Zheng coming from her hand.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing the life vitality seeping from her hand, Luo Zheng remembered what the cyan dragon had told him. Such a dense and powerful life vitality undoubtedly wasn't something a cultivator at the Illuminating Soul Realm could possess. Despite the fact that her cultivation level had already been lowered down and her strength was still in a weakened state, she was still significantly much stronger than him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng unleashed a demonic phantom at once, allowing the demonic life vitality of the phantom to merge with Tia's life vitality.</p>

  <p>The instant it was consumed by Zheng's demonic life vitality, the color of Tia's life vitality changed into a shade of purple-black.</p>

  <p>She transferred her life vitality at an intense speed, and Zheng's demonic life vitality was reconstructing it at full tilt just as well without having any trouble keeping up with her at all. In just a short period of time, Luo Zheng had already produced a mass of purple-black life vitality hanging around him.</p>

  <p>"Isn't that enough already?" Luo Zheng wondered. The enchanted barrier standing before him was so unyielding. Thank the heavens he hadn't forgotten about his Emerald Crystal, which happened to be designed for breaking enchanted barriers.</p>

  <p>"Not yet. But we're almost there," Tia kept shaking her head. "That's it!</p>

  <p>Just a little bit more!" Tia insisted, taking out four pieces of supreme life vitality crystals. She clutched the supreme crystals tightly to draw up the life vitality contained within them.</p>

  <p>The life vitality bottled up inside the supreme crystal was so pure and intense that there was a chance Zheng's belly might not be able to handle even one of the crystals' vitality. Even so, Tia was a bit special, for she could absorb four at the same time. That being said, it wouldn't be so hard to picture out just how strong her belly's bearing ability truly was.</p>

  <p>As expected, immediately after absorbing the life vitality from the supreme crystals, she transferred everything again so she could supply Luo Zheng with enough force.</p>

  <p>This was the new plan Tia came up with. There could also be a possibility that Frank's spear might not be able to pierce the enchanted barrier, but Zheng's Heavenly Ogre Fist gave them better odds of pulling it off, so long as the power provided by the life vitality was adequate.</p>

  <p>Zheng's demonic life vitality devoured every bit of the life vitality that seeped from her and transformed them into the purple-black form. Just as he was about to drain the last bit of life vitality she had, she took out a few more supreme life vitality crystals, shattering them to absorb the life vitality.</p>
