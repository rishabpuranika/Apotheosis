<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2819 Unable To Attack </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The man who launched the sword attack was Tianming.</p>

  <p>The fight in the void was quite fierce. Tianming knew very well to himself that he couldn't directly fight with the Holy Beings. Although he had some secret weapon to rely on, he didn't get involved before.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Samuel used his Spear of Supreme Harmony to slash and almost slaughter everyone, he chose to immediately stay away.</p>

  <p>He fled a distance away and surprisingly noticed another person. It was Pascal.</p>

  <p>Since the very beginning, Pascal had never gotten involved with the fights.</p>

  <p>He quietly stayed far away like a puppet.</p>

  <p>Tianming observed him further, and an idea formed into his mind.</p>

  <p>The truth was that the True Demon Body could only be inherited by a consummate True God. No matter how powerful Samuel was, it would be impossible for him to inherit the True Demon Body by himself.</p>

  <p>As for the Han Clan, the only person they could rely on was Pascal.</p>

  <p>Thinking of this, Tianming lurked and stayed near him.</p>

  <p>The result of the fight was exactly the same as what he had expected.</p>

  <p>Samuel had successfully obtained the True Demon Body in the fight.</p>

  <p>Tianming's plan all along was to precisely choose this timing to attack.</p>

  <p>"Lowell?"</p>

  <p>When Nicholas saw this scene, a touch of joy appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>He didn't expect that Lowell was so vigilant that he had waited by Pascal's side in advance.</p>

  <p>They knew that Pascal was not himself and was completely controlled by Samuel.</p>

  <p>Seeing Tianming's sword radiance, Samuel frowned and had to dodge it. He immediately conveyed the idea to Pascal.</p>

  <p>Pascal was quick to turn around and step back, managing to dodge the slash.</p>

  <p>Tianming transformed into a beam of light and flew towards the girl with blue eyes, pulling her into his arms.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>Samuel cursed. His face turned cold when he saw Tianming's actions.</p>

  <p>He stabbed the Spear of Supreme Harmony in his hand in the air.</p>

  <p>"Swish!"</p>

  <p>A space wave spread out.</p>

  <p>He wanted to pull the blue eyed girl and Lowell over.</p>

  <p>However, the woman was at the same time quick to act as well. When Samuel stabbed his spear out, she had also given instructions to his clone to do the same.</p>

  <p>Two space waves rushed to Tianming.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>The two space waves collided against each other and were then neutralized.</p>

  <p>Tianming knew that he was taking a huge risk, but he had no choice.</p>

  <p>In the universe, he had to shoulder so many responsibilities. He felt pressured, which made him realize that his future was definitely not optimistic, opposite of what he was hoping for.</p>

  <p>Since he was already caught up in such a situation, it was not possible to change his fate even though the alliance of the powerful clans had suffered a great loss because of Samuel.</p>

  <p>Over the years, Tianming's state of mind had changed greatly.</p>

  <p>He persisted until the end. Either for himself or for Iris, he could not die. He didn't want to die.</p>

  <p>He only had one goal and that was to control the Abyss Demon Region. If he could do so, perhaps everything would take a favorable turn.</p>

  <p>"How to refine this girl?"</p>

  <p>The blue eyed girl had used up her energy and could not be refined through the red eyed girl.</p>

  <p>But he had no idea what he should do to refine the supreme treasure of belief.</p>

  <p>"Spiritual sense!"</p>

  <p>Almost subconsciously, his spiritual sense had poured into the mind of the blue eyed girl. As soon as his spiritual sense was poured into her mind, he had sensed that panic and fear were hidden in the young soul of the girl.</p>

  <p>"Don't be afraid. Calm down. I... I can protect you!"</p>

  <p>Tianming tried to soothe the blue eyed girl.</p>

  <p>He kept his focus, as a crisp sound rang out above his head.</p>

  <p>The space channel created by Samuel was once again counter attacked and destroyed by the woman.</p>

  <p>"You want to possess the True Demon Body as well. Are you going to let that brat get it?" Samuel quickly spoke, exasperated.</p>

  <p>The woman sneered, "It's better than letting you get it!"</p>

  <p>The clone beside her was prepared to attack as Samuel was about to thrust out his Spear of Supreme Harmony again.</p>

  <p>He gritted his teeth in agitation that all his spear attacks had been completely destroyed by the clone. He once again made a move in caution.</p>

  <p>As the Spear of Supreme Harmony emitted a light, he disappeared from where he was and was about to teleport himself.</p>

  <p>But the moment he disappeared, the clone thrust his spear into the air. The spear seemed to strike at nothing, but it was proven wrong as a zigzag space crack had suddenly appeared in the void. Soon, Samuel fell from the crack.</p>

  <p>He glared at the woman as he realized that he couldn't teleport himself.</p>

  <p>If the woman built a space channel, he would choose to destroy it too at the first time.</p>

  <p>He suddenly remembered that Pascal was still under his control. He kept his guard against the woman and secretly gave out orders.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Back to Tianming, he was entirely focused on refining the girl with blue eyes.</p>

  <p>Pascal had drawn back but he could have another chance to attack.</p>

  <p>Pascal gave a murderous look, and a short silver sword appeared in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Five Elements Cracking the Air!"</p>

  <p>Pascal forcefully increased his strength. In terms of pure strength, there was a certain gap between him and the ordinary consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>But now that Samuel was controlling him, the situation was different.</p>

  <p>The short sword in his hand showed the internal momentum of Five Elements and shot towards the vital parts of Tianming's body.</p>

  <p>'The True Demon Body belongs to me. If you dare to snatch it, you have to pay with your life!' Samuel sneered in his heart as he watched Tianming's incoming doom.</p>

  <p>Tianming had already wrapped his arms around the blue eyed girl.</p>

  <p>The girl did not have a strong killing intention. She knew little about the world and would be scared at the mere rustle of leaves in the wind, so she counterattacked violently.</p>

  <p>Moreover, she was powerful enough to cause terrible consequences.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry. I mean no harm.</p>

  <p>I will answer all your questions.</p>

  <p>This world is very beautiful."</p>

  <p>While comforting the blue eyed girl, Tianming was still aware of the attack behind him.</p>

  <p>As Pascal's short sword was getting closer and closer to him, he frowned slightly and his eyes flashed a sharp light.</p>

  <p>A milky white light rose from the surface of his body.</p>

  <p>The short sword in Pascal's hand was already at a close distance to Tianming's body, but he strangely discovered that no matter how hard he tried, the sword could not stab Tianming. It seemed like there was an invisible barrier in between.</p>

  <p>"What's going on?"</p>

  <p>Samuel was flustered at the change of situation. He was still standing far away and had a puzzled look on his face.</p>

  <p>At this moment, he had an illusion that Pascal was disobeying his order.</p>

  <p>As his puppet, how could Pascal disobey his order?</p>

  <p>"Kill him!"</p>

  <p>Without any clue, Samuel urged further and gave the order in his mind.</p>

  <p>Pascal had now used both hands to hold the short sword, and fiercely stabbed Tianming's back.</p>

  <p>The short sword, which flickered with the five colored sword radiance, was already only half an inch away from Tianming. But then the tip of the sword desperately shook. In such a short distance, however, no matter how hard Pascal tried, he just couldn't give a blow. It was useless.</p>

  <p>"Will you protect me?" the blue eyed girl then spoke after Tianming had carefully soothed her.</p>

  <p>She felt even more insecure than the red eyed girl.</p>

  <p>"Of course I will," Tianming answered with a smile.</p>

  <p>"That's great."</p>

  <p>Just then, he felt that the blue eyed girl opened her heart to him and at the same time, a unique energy began to blend. A connection was quickly formed between him and the girl.</p>
