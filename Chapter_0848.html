<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had grasped the general idea of how the Talent Tablet worked in testing the talent and skills of the examinees.</p>

  <p>He found out that the first screening was to test the comprehension skill of a martial artist with regards to laws. Then the testing of the strength of corporeal body followed suit by gauging the physical power of the examinees through exerting immense pressure on them!</p>

  <p>So far, these were all that he knew about the test system. Other than these, he had no idea what other mysterious testing methods the Talent Tablet contained. But one thing was clear to Luo Zheng that when it came to the physical talent, he definitely wouldn't lose to anyone!</p>

  <p>His body differed from that of an ordinary person. Even a body refiner couldn't measure up to him, let alone any martial artist that cultivated life vitality. Once his body made a breakthrough and became the sacred weapon or reached a higher level, his body would become even more terrifying.</p>

  <p>Moreover, he would reach an incredible level in no time with great potential.</p>

  <p>Apart from the test on the physical body, the third test was a test on the soul. Luo Zheng had also passed this test painstakingly!</p>

  <p>Now that Luo Zheng had passed all the three tests, he was assuming that the test was finally over.</p>

  <p>His eyes darted pensively to the closed door on the wall facing him. The space surrounding him was so dark that it gave him an eerie feeling that it was not yet the end of the test. Trusting his gut feel, he knew that there was something more that lay ahead.</p>

  <p>'What else should I be tested? Don't tell me I will get a cultivation method this time!' Luo Zheng thought as he chuckled to himself.</p>

  <p>This idea might sound absurd, but it was deemed possible. It could still be considered a way to test him. Knowing that the cultivation method given by the Tower of Sin would not be simple, he was still quite happy if he would get a cultivation method as a part of the test. But these were only blind and disorderly conjectures that crossed his mind.</p>

  <p>Just as he stood there in deep contemplation, wondering about what might happen, a pair of eyes suddenly appeared in the dark space in front of him.</p>

  <p>In this vast and diverse world, there were many different types of creatures with different looks and shapes. But no matter how much they differed, they had one thing in common— they all had eyes.</p>

  <p>Like for example, the Genuine Dragon had eyes, the Blue Phoenix had eyes, and humans also had eyes. It was a characteristic shared by all living creatures!</p>

  <p>When several rays of light became visible and gradually formed like a pair of eyes in front of him, he was flabbergasted. "Who are you?" Luo Zheng gawked at the pair of eyes as he asked.</p>

  <p>Another dot of light popped up in the darkness. It gently danced in the air and eventually formed a mouth. Soon after, a distant and ancient voice rang out, "Human, I am the weapon spirit of this Tower of Sin! "</p>

  <p>"Weapon spirit!" Zheng's eyes flashed with awe as he shook his head in amazement.</p>

  <p>"Yes!" The melodious voice continued, "As a weapon spirit, I've already existed in this tower for a million years…"</p>

  <p>"A million years!" Luo Zheng exclaimed, cutting off the weapon spirit in midsentence. He was shocked to hear that.</p>

  <p>In the Central Region, the Ancient Tycoon who had lived over a thousand years was already considered much of a freak. But as for anyone who had lived a million years, then what must it be called? To Zheng's knowledge, since the dawn of time, there had never appeared such a being. Only immortals could have such a long lifespan.</p>

  <p>Even the immortal Mist only had a lifespan of tens of thousands of years, yet this weapon spirit had existed within the Tower of Sin for a million years! The mere thought of this made Zheng's heart tremble in shock!</p>

  <p>But after a million years, even a sacred weapon would turn to ash. Since this weapon spirit had existed for so long, it meant that the Tower of Sin had been in existence for at least a million years.</p>

  <p>"There's no need to be surprised. I am from the Heavenly Soul race. We exist in a form that is different from you," the voice interjected lightly. "We don't have a body. The way we exist is equivalent to that of consciousness.</p>

  <p>So basically, we will not age. I won't die as long as this tower exists."</p>

  <p>So that explained it! The world was big and full of wonders. The longevity of the Heavenly Soul race was something unimaginable for Luo Zheng, who had only lived for a dozen years.</p>

  <p>As long as the physical body existed, there would be a constant need for energy to sustain its metabolism. Even it was an immortal who went on fasting and didn't eat anything, he still had to absorb other forms of energy to sustain himself.</p>

  <p>Since the creatures of Heavenly Soul did not have a body, their lifespan was countless times longer than that of humans.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng assumed that the weapon spirit existed in a way that was similar to his sword spirit, Lily. The difference was that Lily was attached to Zheng's body, while this weapon spirit was attached to the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>"You...what do you want with me?" Luo Zheng probed.</p>

  <p>The weapon spirit fell silent for a moment before saying, "Your talent is the best in a million years."</p>

  <p>Hearing such high praise from the weapon spirit, Luo Zheng revealed a proud smile with the corner of his lips slightly uplifted. He didn't interrupt the weapon spirit and waited for it to continue instead.</p>

  <p>"You have passed the three tests in the Talent Tablet. However, we still can't see the limit of your real strength after those tests. So I want to ask you, are you willing to take a further test?" The weapon spirit asked.</p>

  <p>"There is one more test behind?" Zheng's eyes flashed with surprise.</p>

  <p>The weapon spirit said, "Yes. Up until now, this test has never been activated. You are the first to take the test."</p>

  <p>"What can I gain if I pass this one?" Luo Zheng asked with a smile.</p>

  <p>"The owner of this tower built this place so that the members of his race could increase their strength through tests and battles. Every living being that passes the tests of the Talent Tablet will receive certain benefits." The weapon spirit faintly said, "If you can pass this test, then the benefits will be greater as compared to what other living creatures had got."</p>

  <p>Before this, Luo Zheng had already heard from Olivia that this Talent Tablet was a magical thing. After passing the test, the Talent Tablet would even increase and boost the talent of the examinees!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had never thought that one's talent could be magically enhanced, so he was very interested in the Talent Tablet.</p>

  <p>Now that Luo Zheng heard this weapon spirit say that there was a possibility he could get more benefits than others, he showed more interest and couldn't wait to get a try.</p>

  <p>"I agree!" Luo Zheng nodded without hesitation. "However, I have one more question."</p>

  <p>"You may ask any questions, young man," the weapon spirit replied.</p>

  <p>"You mentioned the owner of the Tower of Sin just now. What kind of race is the owner from?". Luo Zheng queried curiously.</p>

  <p>He had always been very interested in the origins of the Tower of Sin. After all, the most important reason for him to come all the way here was to get the inheritance at the bottom of the tower. The immortal Mist did not reveal much to him about the Tower of Sin other than giving him a token.</p>

  <p>To satiate his inquisitiveness, Luo Zheng could only dig more information about the Tower of Sin himself.</p>

  <p>However, the races in the Sea God Continent knew nothing much more than Luo Zheng did about the Tower of Sin. How the Cursed Land appeared and where the Tower of Sin originated were distinctly still gray areas to them.</p>

  <p>Hearing Zheng's question, the weapon spirit hesitated for a moment. Then he spoke slowly, "The master did not say that I am not allowed to answer such a question. So I can tell you, he belongs to the Celestial Position."</p>

  <p>"Celestial Position?" Luo Zheng blurted out, looking more eager.</p>

  <p>"Yes, the master belongs to the Celestial Position," the weapon spirit repeated.</p>

  <p>"What kind of race is that? Are they humans?" probed Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"No, the Celestial Position is a very powerful race, and it is not human race.</p>

  <p>Sorry, I can't explain to you any further," the weapon spirit stated blandly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng secretly rolled his eyes out of a bit of impatience. He didn't get much information, as the weapon spirit didn't say much about his query. But at least, he knew there was a race called Celestial Position. This fact somehow settled him at ease for the moment. He probably had to rely on himself to find the answers. Or maybe after he got the inheritance from the bottom of the Tower of Sin, he would then be able to find out everything!</p>

  <p>"I have answered your question. Now, the ultimate test is about to begin.</p>

  <p>Young man, I hope you can pass it. Good luck! "</p>

  <p>As the weapon spirit's voice faded away, the light in the surroundings started to change constantly. Simultaneously, Luo Zheng quickly fell, and he felt as if he was sinking into a starry sky!</p>

  <p>Mysterious various patterns consistently appeared and soon engulfed him.</p>

  <p>These patterns were very abstract, and each one was different. The Mu Ning exuded from them made Luo Zheng feel awed as he looked at them with reverence.</p>

  <p>This sense of overwhelming feeling seemed to come from his instinct!</p>

  <p>"What are these patterns?" Luo Zheng intently looked at the patterns in confusion.</p>

  <p>"Is this the final test? Then what exactly is this supposed to test me on?"</p>

  <p>While Luo Zheng seriously pondered over these questions, the first pattern quickly moved and approached him. The feeling was somewhat familiar. It dawned on him that it was similar to the way that his consciousness approached a star when he had cultivated the Stellar Body.</p>

  <p>This time, however, Luo Zheng was not moving towards the pattern, but rather, the pattern was crushing down on his head!</p>

  <p>As the pattern slowly approached, Luo Zheng felt extremely small. In the face of this pattern, he was like a grain of sand!</p>

  <p>"It made me feel bad!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's brows furrowed as the energy within his body exploded out, colliding with the pattern.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>A person appeared in front of Luo Zheng as a sudden white bright light flashed.</p>

  <p>The person was wearing a Taoist robe and had a short sword made of jade in his hand.</p>

  <p>As if everything was in sync, the weapon spirit's voice rang out. "This is the Soul Symbol. The one in front of you is the Soul Symbol left after this master died."</p>

  <p>"And then?" Luo Zheng hastily asked as he raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Defeat him," the weapon spirit replied nonchalantly.</p>

  <p>"How strong is he?" Luo Zheng countered, seemingly anxious.</p>

  <p>"When he was alive, his strength was equivalent to a human master in the Soul Sea Realm," the weapon spirit expressed.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing the weapon spirit's words, Luo Zheng turned speechless. Was this a joke? He mused that no matter how strong he was, he was not powerful enough to stand against a Soul Sea Realm master. It would take not many efforts for the Soul Sea Realm master to crush him with one hand.</p>
