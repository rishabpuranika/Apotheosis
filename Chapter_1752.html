  <p>
</p>

  <p>It wasn't very difficult to treat the injuries on Luo Zheng's hands.</p>

  <p>He also had some pills to help regenerate his muscles, but the reborn flesh and blood would be quite different from his original flesh and blood.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, Luo Luo Zheng thought that they would give him some sort of magic pills.</p>

  <p>However, the only reason they had come here was for one thing, and that was to get exceptionally accurate measurement.</p>

  <p>This measurement included the fracture of Luo Zheng's muscles as well as the thickness and width of his bones.</p>

  <p>After busying themselves for four to six hours, the three warriors left.</p>

  <p>Freya and Luo Luo Zheng were also confused, and wondered whether this group was really there to help him.</p>

  <p>One day later, the leader of the group returned and took Luo Luo Zheng outside. He measured the distance and then walked a dozen steps out of the door.</p>

  <p>"Come over here."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng walked over and stood in the spot indicated by him. He did not know what was going on.</p>

  <p>Although he had passed the Celestial Position race's examination, he did not know much about the race and the methods they used.</p>

  <p>The warrior grabbed Luo Zheng's arm and adjusted his position. Then, he nodded mysteriously, took two steps back and made a gesture towards the sky...</p>

  <p>The cloudless blue sky suddenly filled with dark clouds. Within the layers of dark clouds, two stripes of green lightning streaked across the sky, like two green dragons that flashed faintly across the clouds!</p>

  <p>"Crack..."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng gazed up at them and barely had time to react before the two green bolts of lightning descended and landed on his hands!</p>

  <p>The powerful force of lightning caused Luo Zheng's hair to stand on end. Even his thoughts came to a halt, rendering him incapable of thinking.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was aware that some kinds of thunder and lightning actually contained a powerful life energy. These streaks of thunder and lightning could give birth to life in the Soul Sea. However, he did not expect the Celestial Position to use this method to cure his hands...</p>

  <p>The meridians in his hands stretched out endlessly, crawling all the way from his arms to the back of his hands. They were like small worms that coiled around the back of his hands and followed the crevices of the bone on his fingers, extending all the way to his fingertips.</p>

  <p>They continued onward spreading to his muscles, tendons, skin, and so on.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng felt a tingling sensation in his hands and was unable to exert any strength. Apart from this, he also felt an invisible force twisting his hands, and preventing him from falling to the ground.</p>

  <p>After the streaks of green lightning were exhausted, the power suddenly disappeared. Under the sudden whipping of the lightning energy, he, too, fell to the ground, temporarily incapacitated.</p>

  <p>The warrior walked out and grabbed Luo Zheng's hands. He flipped them over, studied them briefly, and then nodded expressionlessly. "They should be fine, but they are still not perfect. Someone will help you nurse them.</p>

  <p>Try not to exert too much for the next two days."</p>

  <p>After advising him thus, the warrior flew away without looking back, leaving Luo Luo Zheng and Freya standing there dumbstruck. The two just looked at each other in consternation.</p>

  <p>These Celestial Position warriors were really weird.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stretched his hands. There was a prominent line at the meeting points of his arms and hands. The top half was black, while the skin that had just grown was snowy white. His hands looked like a woman's well-manicured hands.</p>

  <p>It looked like he'd take a while to get used to it, which made Luo Luo Zheng feel a bit helpless.</p>

  <p>Not long after, another member from the Celestial Position race was sent there. This time it was no other than Master Feng, the head of the Celestial Position race.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was pleased to see Master Feng, as he had a lot of questions to ask him. For example, why did Tianming and the others come to the Celestial Position? Had the top 10 warriors of the Illusion Battlefield arrived?</p>

  <p>What was their reason for sending him to the Celestial Position?</p>

  <p>Master Feng, on the other hand, was crafty and didn't directly answer Luo Zheng's question. "This time, I've come to help you recover that girl's damaged soul." With that, he pointed at Luo Zheng's chest.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng felt his body shudder, and the red light ensconced within his body poured out.</p>

  <p>These specks of light were the sword spirit's most primitive form. As they continued to condense, the red light dissipated and eventually turned into Xun's body.</p>

  <p>As she fell into a deep slumber, she hugged her knees, her eyes tightly shut. She was curled up in a fetal position like an infant.</p>

  <p>Master Feng took out a small incense burner, burnt the incense and put the furnace in a corner of the room. Luo Luo Zheng didn't know what incense was burning, but it seemed to have an extremely strong effect as it nourished the soul. From the incense burner, a small amount of light-purple smoke began to slowly waft around. Luo Luo Zheng absorbed the smoke by accident, and felt instantly refreshed. Even though Master Feng didn't tell him, Luo Luo Zheng knew that this was extraordinary and invaluable.</p>

  <p>A majority of the purple smoke flowed into Xun's body.</p>

  <p>"Don't take her back into your body during this period. Just let her stay in this room," Master Feng instructed.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded. He couldn't stay a long distance away from Xun, but he could still move around. "I want to ask..."</p>

  <p>He had just begun to speak when Master Feng held up a finger to silence him. He smiled lightly and said, "All the problems will be solved. I will come back in ten days to have your blood changed. That's when I will talk to you about your dragons..."</p>

  <p>Seeing that Master Feng was about to leave, Luo Luo Zheng realized he had no way of detaining the Supreme Lord. In a moment of desperation, he said darkly, "If you don't explain this clearly, I refuse to join the Celestial Position race!"</p>

  <p>The doubts in his heart had arisen after encountering this old fellow.</p>

  <p>Although nothing major had happened in this period of time, what he had seen and experienced was so weird and different from his point of view and imagination.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng felt like he was going crazy in this strange and mysterious environment!</p>

  <p>Master Feng smiled slightly and his silhouette became more and more blurry. When his shadow almost completely disappeared in front of Luo Luo Zheng, he spoke, "We are proving our sincerity. The final decision is in your hands."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng curled his lips as he looked at Xun. He had a calm expression on his face, but he was pondering over the words in his mind.</p>

  <p>Indeed, Luo Luo Zheng did not completely trust the Celestial Position race. They were currently trying to prove their sincerity to Luo Luo Zheng and win his trust.</p>

  <p>'What is the purpose of this?</p>

  <p>Are they doing this just to ensure that I will be loyal to them in the future?</p>

  <p>That doesn't sound right...' Luo Luo Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>He would only follow his own wishes and plans. As long as no one went against his principles, he would not do anything to let down the Celestial Position race. Such was Luo Zheng's personality.</p>

  <p>If he were to come across some extremely difficult choices in the future, then the "sincerity" displayed by the Celestial Position would influence his decision.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng kept analyzing everything in his mind.</p>

  <p>After thinking about it for a while, Luo Luo Zheng finally calmed himself down. No matter what, the right to choose was in his hands. Perhaps his fate would be secretly influenced by some force, but in the end, he would still solve the mystery.</p>

  <p>His gaze rested on Xun again.</p>

  <p>Even though she was curled up into a ball, her beautiful figure was not hidden. Her thick eyelashes fanned out like a pair of paintbrushes and trembled.</p>

  <p>Xun was straightforward. In the past, her behavior had not been strange. She had stayed with him and helped him progress in cultivation, and in return he would help her ascend to the throne once again.</p>

  <p>Now it seemed that the matter wasn't as simple as it appeared.</p>

  <p>Xun's previous words were a bit obscure, as if she was hiding something, particularly Yao's motive for killing her.</p>

  <p>According to her, Yao was preparing to directly make a move on her, but what was her motive? If she really was to going to gain control of the entire Demon Night, then Yao also needed to kill Ying. However, Ying was safe and sound all the time.</p>

  <p>Ying was certain that Yao wanted to monopolize the Demon Night, but she still dared to reincarnate and turned into Shania. She didn't seem to be afraid of Yao's methods.</p>

  <p>This was a very contradictory situation. It didn't make any logical sense.</p>

  <p>After Xun woke up, Luo Luo Zheng would have a good, long talk with her. He thought that she wouldn't hide such matters from him...</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, have some spirit tea," Freya uttered, serving Luo Luo Zheng a cup.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng took the teacup from Freya. However, instead of taking a sip, he just kept staring at Xun. He didn't notice that Freya, who stayed behind him, looked hesitant. She wanted to say something, but on second thought, she changed her mind. Her black eyes, like two stars in the night sky, were gleaming in a strange way.</p>
