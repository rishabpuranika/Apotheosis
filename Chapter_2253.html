<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2253 Gossip </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>After entering the Hall of True Gods, Luo Luo Zheng won three consecutive battles, and his ranking steadily increased by more than a hundred places.</p>

  <p>However, his ranking could only be seen within the Hall of True Gods by the ranking of his room door. Since he hadn't lost even a single battle, it was impossible to find him on the Jade Wall of Legends.</p>

  <p>Now that he had put a space of a hundred ranks between himself and the low-rank True Gods just now, he had shattered all their expectations.</p>

  <p>There was a rule that participants could only challenge warriors within a hundred rankings from themselves, so these low-rank True Gods were no longer qualified to challenge Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Luo Luo Zheng had already shown his strength by defeating three low-rank True Gods in a row.</p>

  <p>People could claim that Luo Zheng's first victory had been a matter of luck.</p>

  <p>They could explain his second victory away as well by claiming that his opponent had taken him lightly. But after Luo Zheng's third victory, it would be downright stupid to downplay his skills and take him as a mere proving godly warrior.</p>

  <p>No one took the initiative to challenge Luo Luo Zheng again, and Luo Luo Zheng also tried to choose his opponents randomly. Anyway, they were selected according to their rankings, so at his current level, Luo Luo Zheng wouldn't face any opponent who was ridiculously strong.</p>

  <p>His fourth opponent turned out to be Fletcher Li, a disciple of the Li Clan which ranked 17th among all the Floating Islands. His Divine Dao was the Great Manipulating Way. The Great Manipulating Way could help one manipulate everything in the world. It was similar to the puppet techniques that Luo Luo Zheng had seen before. It could also be considered the peak method of the puppet techniques. However, the Great Manipulating Way was much more overbearing, and one could exert thousands of invisible silk threads to break into an opponent's mind and manipulate their soul.</p>

  <p>This time, Luo Luo Zheng didn't let the silk threads enter his mind. He knew that Fletcher would make every effort to turn him into a puppet. If he allowed that to happen, he would face a lot more than a defeat. Once his soul was invaded, his opponent would be able to see his true identity and his deepest secrets. It would be his biggest problem.</p>

  <p>The Great Manipulating Way was indeed very special, but its combat effectiveness was not very strong. Perhaps it was because there was no powerful puppet in Fletcher's hands. Some of the golden puppets he was using could not block Luo Zheng's attacks at all.</p>

  <p>In the end, after a cautious battle, Fletcher was defeated and he left the Arena of Legends unwillingly. Because of the special nature of the Great Manipulating Way, Luo Luo Zheng was unable to absorb this Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>If the Infinity Ruler could be activated freely, Luo Luo Zheng would not be in such trouble. With the Infinity Ruler, he did not need to take any risks to take in the internal momentum of his opponent; he only needed to use his golden pupils to see through the internal momentum of his opponent.</p>

  <p>Just thinking about it made him feel depressed.</p>

  <p>There was no day or night in the Hall of True Gods. All the disciples of the Floating Islands were picking opponents to battle. The spiral doors would occasionally emit blue lights while changing their positions. If a door went up, it meant that the warrior had won; if it slid downward, it meant that he or she had been defeated.</p>

  <p>After the fourth battle, Luo Luo Zheng received an extra reward of more than 500 points. What Joy had told him was right; the extra reward for challenging higher-level warriors was really huge. According to his calculation, he would probably get an extra reward of thousands of points in his tenth battle.</p>

  <p>The higher the rank of his room was, the stronger the opponents he would encounter, and the harder it would be to obtain points.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did not continue to challenge a new opponent, but instead returned to his room and left the Jade Wall of Legends.</p>

  <p>Letting the Infinity Ruler take in the Divine Dao was a crucial thing for Luo Luo Zheng. As he pondered over the Infinity Ruler, he hoped that he would be able to fill all the scales of it while earning points in the Arena of Legends.</p>

  <p>To his surprise, as soon as he left the Jade Wall of Legends, he saw Joy standing behind him, crossing her arms and staring at him with a pair of soft and beautiful eyes that looked like they held deep meaning behind them.</p>

  <p>Seeing her eyes made Luo Luo Zheng feel embarrassed. He turned his head and saw Han Liusu standing in plain clothes at one side of the hall. Judging by her red face, Luo Luo Zheng guessed that she'd been talking about something with Joy just now.</p>

  <p>"The Princess Royal of the Han Clan has come to see you in person.</p>

  <p>Why don't you come and greet her?" Joy asked teasingly with a smile.</p>

  <p>Hearing that, Han Liusu complained with a shy smile, "Aunt Joy! Isn't it too much for you to say that he should greet me? It's not necessary."</p>

  <p>Joy was not actually Liusu's aunt. But since Joy was a Demi-holy Being and much older than her, Han Liusu had to respect her by calling her "Aunt Joy". However, in terms of seniority in the family, Han Liusu was in fact Joy's grand aunt. After all, Han Liusu was the eldest daughter of the Holy Emperor. Although she was much younger than Joy, she was Joy's senior in the Han Clan. Han Liusu didn't know her rank clearly, and anyway, no one cared about it.</p>

  <p>Whenever the direct descendants of the Han Clan met Joy, they would all call her "Aunt Joy" due to respect.</p>

  <p>Obeying Joy's words, Luo Luo Zheng bowed to Han Liusu with his hands clasped in front of his chest and said, "Tianxing Luo from the Purple Soul Hall paying his respects to Your Highness."</p>

  <p>A hint of displeasure flashed in Liusu's eyes when she heard these words. The formal way Luo Luo Zheng was addressing her drew a distance between them. With her lips curving up into an evil smile, she blinked and said, "I don't know who Tianxing Luo is. I only know..."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng immediately became nervous. He knew that if he let her continue to speak, she would probably let the cat out of the bag and reveal his true identity.</p>

  <p>When she paused, he winked and hurriedly changed the subject. "Your Highness, I've already participated in battles of challenging warriors at a higher level in the Jade Wall of Legends. If I meet Your Highness someday in the future, please show mercy."</p>

  <p>Han Liusu sulked as she glanced at Luo Luo Zheng. She hadn't really been about to expose Luo Zheng's identity in front of Joy. After all, she would never do anything to annoy Luo Luo Zheng. Instead, she cooperated with him and talked about other things.</p>

  <p>Joy didn't know that Luo Luo Zheng and Han Liusu had known each other in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>Before Luo Luo Zheng had arrived, Joy had been teasing Han Liusu. She had told Han Liusu that if it weren't for her marriage with the Leng Clan, she could consider Tianxing Luo to be her fiance. She hadn't avoided talking about the matter at all and had kept talking about how excellent Luo Luo Zheng was.</p>

  <p>But what Joy hadn't known was that she had said Liusu's thoughts aloud, and that was why Liusu's face had gone red.</p>

  <p>Han Liusu had never had feelings for Langston. And after the incident this time, she hated him for being self-centered. How could she agree to marry him? She had made up her mind and had the courage to move forward.</p>

  <p>Han Liusu looked gentle and lovely, but once she made a decision, it was impossible for anyone to change it.</p>

  <p>When Han Liusu had told her that she'd come here today to pay a visit to Luo Luo Zheng, Joy had thought that Han Liusu just wanted to show her gratitude to Luo Luo Zheng. But now her strange conversation with Luo Luo Zheng raised Joy's doubts.</p>

  <p>"Thank you for saving Aleyna a few days ago. This is my gift to you," said Han Liusu. With a light flick of her finger, she made a small brocade box appear. The box was crystal clear and exquisite, and there was a light green pill inside.</p>

  <p>"Han Liusu, you are so generous. The seven times refined God-turning Pill. It's a rare thing." Joy smiled when she saw the light green pill.</p>

  <p>The God-turning Pill could be integrated into the cinnabar field to activate the life vitality sea in the body, which would make it easier to atomize the seawater and also accelerate the condensation of the Godly Tile. However, these kinds of pills were usually two or three times refined; few people would make the seven times refined God-turning Pill. The seven times refined God-turning Pill was used only to accelerate the condensation of the Godly Tile. Only wealthy clans like the Han Clan would refine these pills for direct disciples. And since it was specially refined, it was, of course, rare.</p>

  <p>Even Master Evil gasped in admiration at the extravagance of the wealthy clans when he noticed the seven times refined God-turning Pill.</p>

  <p>"Thank you." Luo Luo Zheng politely took this delicate brocade box from Liusu's hand.</p>

  <p>As their hands brushed against each other, Han Liusu pinched his finger with great force. However, she'd forgotten that Luo Zheng's corporeal body was much tougher than a supreme primordial weapon. Luo Luo Zheng didn't show any reaction whereas she felt a dull pain in her fingertips.</p>

  <p>And although Han Liusu had tried to be subtle and secretive, this gesture didn't go unnoticed by Joy's keen eyes. But Joy didn't want to question Han Liusu about it now.</p>

  <p>"May you prove a Divine Dao as soon as possible and make a contribution to my Han Clan," Han Liusu said to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Now that I have become a disciple of the Han Clan, I must make a contribution..."</p>

  <p>After exchanging a few conventional remarks with Luo Luo Zheng in front of Joy, Han Liusu said goodbye and left. As soon as she turned around, the smile on her face disappeared without a trace. It was replaced by an expression of extreme disappointment, and even a little anger.</p>

  <p>When she had come to see Luo Luo Zheng, she had been hoping to have an opportunity to talk to him alone. She hadn't expected Joy to directly bring Luo Luo Zheng to her palace.</p>

  <p>Han Liusu had even implied that she would have a talk with Tianxing alone, but Joy had pretended not to understand her words and had shown no signs of leaving. In addition to giving the gift to Luo Luo Zheng, Han Liusu had wasted her time.</p>

  <p>After Han Liusu left her palace, Joy stared at Luo Luo Zheng with great interest and asked, "Tianxing, have you ever met Princess Royal outside the Floating Island?"</p>

  <p>Seeing Joy's strong desire to get the truth out of him, Luo Luo Zheng sighed in his heart. Even though Joy was a Demi-Holy Being, she still liked to gossip.</p>

  <p>This was very abnormal.</p>
