  <p>Maha possessed a lot of backup plans.</p>

  <p>He retained the ability to protect himself even if he happened to come across a Supreme Lord within the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>However, killing Luo Luo Zheng with these backup plans would not be easy. He knew that if he wasn't careful, he would die in Luo Zheng's hands.</p>

  <p>In challenging Luo Luo Zheng, his intention was not to engage in a fair fight, but to take over the Evolutionary Universe. This was a war conducted between two Holy Beings under the established rules.</p>

  <p>Maha knew that he was just Murphy's pawn just as all living beings were merely the pawns of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>For the moment, Maha no longer paid any attention to Luo Luo Zheng. Instead, he closed his eyes and concentrated on his chanting.</p>

  <p>The Heavens-suppressing Object possessed by every Holy Being was extraordinary.</p>

  <p>After one became a True God in the divine land, and created their own perfect inner world, their dependence on the life vitality would slowly decrease until it reached the point where they no longer consumed the life vitality at all.</p>

  <p>After all, consuming the life vitality was in a sense destroying the inner world.</p>

  <p>Warriors at the world lord level would painstakingly build up their inner worlds and produce several divine kingdoms and sacred places. If they then fought with others and had to drain the life vitality from their cinnabar fields, all the divine kingdoms and sacred places would be destroyed, and all creatures would die. This could be an incredibly painful loss.</p>

  <p>After one became a True God, it was possible to condense a Godly Tile within the inner world before using the momentum within the inner world.</p>

  <p>What was called 'momentum' was in reality a method of applying the Faith Energy at a higher level. For example, the creatures which inhabited the Evolutionary Universe were unaware that Mike existed, but that didn't stop Mike taking advantage of the momentum at will.</p>

  <p>A True God used a Godly Tile to control the 'momentum', while a Holy Being employed a Heavens-suppressing Object for the same purpose. In both the Evolutionary Universe and the Murphy Universe, the Heavens-suppressing Object would become a Heavenly Destiny and seek out a representative of the Holy Being to become its owner. It was through this Heavenly Destiny, that someone could borrow the momentum held within the universe.</p>

  <p>Master Feng possessed the Evolution Lotus Flower and was able to borrow the momentum from within the Evolutionary Universe. In the Murphy Universe it was Maha's father that the Sacred race called the Grand Supreme Lord who could borrow the momentum. He held the spinulose wood fern, the Heavens-suppressing Object within the Murphy Universe.</p>

  <p>This spinulose wood fern had a great origin. It had been born from a great ceremony before being controlled by Murphy.</p>

  <p>To keep Maha safe, the Grand Supreme Lord of the Sacred race tore off a branch from the spinulose wood fern before turning it into a spell and sending it into Maha's body. By activating it, Maha was able to use the 'momentum' from the Murphy Universe to kill his opponent.</p>

  <p>Of course, whether it was the Grand Supreme Lord, Master Feng, or Maha, none of the momentum they could borrow by using the Heavens-suppressing Object could be compared to the momentum used by a Holy Being. The momentum was, after all, the power of a Holy Being, and they were only borrowing it. Despite this, the small amount of the 'momentum' which they controlled was still a force to be reckoned with.</p>

  <p>For now, Maha didn't pay the slightest attention to Luo Luo Zheng. It didn't matter how hard Luo Luo Zheng pulled on the other side of the chain, all that he was able to do was to make Maha continue to travel through the air.</p>

  <p>After activating the Phantom Teleport Skill with the Grand World Technique, he had made an invisible maze, and all the paths within this maze were isolated from Luo Luo Zheng. The result of this was that no matter how Luo Luo Zheng pulled on the chain, Maha would simply fly around Luo Luo Zheng and could never approach him.</p>

  <p>"Eternity, happiness, self, clearness, reflection, killing, clarity..." As he chanted, Maha's heart became calm.</p>

  <p>He no longer felt affected by Luo Zheng's influence.</p>

  <p>A gentle Mu Ning began to spread out from his body as his chanting continued.</p>

  <p>It was not long before the shadow of a large tree appeared.</p>

  <p>This tree was so completely green in color that it appeared as if it had been adorned with jade. After appearing, it slowly rotated in the air, its broad leaves embedded with golden Sanskrit words.</p>

  <p>"Golden Sanskrit!" Upon seeing this spinulose wood fern, Luo Zheng's eyes were filled with shock, as a sense of impending danger almost overwhelmed him. The Mu Ning gave Luo Luo Zheng the sense that he was facing a Holy Being.</p>

  <p>The image of the spinulose wood fern was becoming increasingly real, and the gentle Mu Ning grew stronger and stronger.</p>

  <p>At that moment?</p>

  <p>All of the Sunflower Water World was affected by the imposing Mu Ning from the tree. All of the martial artists, mortals, vicious beasts, and other creatures could feel the air around them become viscous. It was as if they were being submerged in water.</p>

  <p>"I must admit that I'm quite jealous of you." Maha's smile grew even broader as he felt the increasingly thick Mu Ning. "I never expected that there would ever be someone with greater talent than me among the secondary creatures. This is really not fair."</p>

  <p>The Sacred race had spent a huge amount of resources cultivating Maha.</p>

  <p>His mother was the most outstanding Supreme Lord of the entire Sacred race. She had even carried the child in her womb for more than 700 years. During all of that time, the Grand Supreme Lord of the Sacred race had begun to pour an endless amount of resources into the still unborn Maha.</p>

  <p>There was no one in the Murphy Universe who had ever been treated in this way.</p>

  <p>Murphy's interest had been aroused because the Grand Supreme Lord had been so intent on fostering Maha. Perhaps Murphy wanted Maha to be his disciple in the future. He had certainly thought highly of Maha's talent and had given him a lot of support behind the scenes.</p>

  <p>How helpless and puzzled must Maha have been feeling to find that, such a richly endowed person as himself was actually being outclassed by Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>What Maha did not know was that although Luo Luo Zheng had indeed been born within the Evolutionary Universe, he was not a secondary creature, strictly speaking. His father was the owner of the Evolutionary Universe, and his mother also came from the divine land. Her status was extraordinary, and she had given birth to Luo Luo Zheng and Yan because of a fortuitous encounter.</p>

  <p>When a peerless genius encountered a genius who was even more monstrous than him, he normally only had two options. The first option was to surpass the other.</p>

  <p>However, Maha had already strained the limits for a secondary creature.</p>

  <p>Perhaps in the inner worlds of many Holy Beings within the divine land, it would be difficult to find someone as talented as Maha, and no one was able to surpass Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The other option open to him was to eliminate the opponent. This meant that he would have to kill this genius.</p>

  <p>Now, Maha planned to use the 'momentum' of the Murphy Universe to kill Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"I hate things that are unfair, so... How about you going to hell now?"</p>

  <p>Maha smiled a cold smile and lightly pointed in Luo Zheng's direction.</p>

  <p>The spinulose wood fern that had appeared out of nowhere began to slowly rotate</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The sticky Mu Ning spread out like a flowing tide in all directions.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the Sunflower Water World was not the only world affected. The Dead Water World to the north of the Sunflower Water World, the Clear Sky World in the south, and the Yellow Dragon World to the west of the Sunflower Water World all felt the effects of the Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>"Kill him, Father," Maha said indifferently.</p>

  <p>In theory, it should have been impossible for Maha to control the Heavens-suppressing Object. He could do no more than summon the spinulose wood fern. The only one with the power to control this Heavenly Destiny was his father, the Sacred race's Grand Supreme Lord in the Murphy Universe.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Without warning, the spinulose wood fern shook. The giant tree started to sway and golden beams of light were emitted from its trunk.</p>

  <p>"Use glass as the ground. The sacred tree is solemn. Use gold as a rope.</p>

  <p>To make eight boundaries..." Maha chanted.</p>

  <p>This spinulose wood fern was the chief of all the trees in the land of bliss. And at this moment, this tree was rushing straight towards Luo Luo Zheng with a loud bang.</p>

  <p>Faced with such power that was entirely beyond his comprehension, Luo Luo Zheng was unable to determine a good way to fight it. All he could do was to rely on the power of the Nine Divine Stars.</p>

  <p>The nine stars within his body began to spin intensely. The chaotic sea surged, and the central continent quaked uncontrollably.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's world wasn't large enough. Activating the Nine Divine Stars too much would cause the inner world to undergo a drastic change. At this point, Luo Luo Zheng was out of ideas, and he didn't have a good solution to the problem, so he didn't have the time to pay attention to the myriad of living creatures in the inner world any longer.</p>

  <p>All of this time, the Sacred race's Supreme Lords remained standing there, unmoving.</p>

  <p>However, within the Dead Water World, the other Supreme Lords in the Evolutionary Universe had started to panic.</p>

  <p>"Master Feng! Shouldn't we take action at this point?" Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment asked, his voice full of concern.</p>

  <p>"With Nathan dead, no matter how, we must not allow Luo Luo Zheng to be killed!"</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord of Oracle also said.</p>

  <p>"Supreme Lord Leroy, take me over there." Xun had her brows knit together. Her actual cultivation was only at the level of a grand world lord, so she was not able to teleport continuously through multiple supreme worlds in the way which a Supreme Lord could. Right now, she felt the power of the strange tree and understood that Luo Luo Zheng might be unable to withstand the coming blow.</p>

  <p>Maha was able to use the Heavens-suppressing Object, and Master Feng was also able to use the Heavens-suppressing Object. But at this time, Master Feng still quelled all of the Supreme Lords' restlessness.</p>

  <p>He simply stared at Luo Luo Zheng from a distance, before saying resolutely,</p>

  <p>"Now? is not the right time."</p>

  <p>    </p>
