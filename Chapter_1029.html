<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As a technique of the Transcendent Divine Might, the Stellar Body was far more difficult to cultivate than other martial skills.</p>

  <p>Just the thought of using the perception to traverse through the great universe alone was enough to stop almost all the martial artists. After that, communicating with the stars was even more difficult.</p>

  <p>Once one successfully mastered it and used the power of the stars to fight, coupled with his forceful energy, his power would be far beyond what an ordinary martial artist could imagine.</p>

  <p>Back in the days, the Lord of Stars was invincible in the Upper World with his Stellar Body technique.</p>

  <p>The first move of the Stellar Body technique, star shakes the earth, was only its most basic application. Even so, it was enough for Luo Zheng to deal with the top-level war lords when he was a war general.</p>

  <p>The second move was a lot more complicated. It required the user to combine the energies of several types of stars to produce a much stronger power. Many stars had completely different characteristics. Some were unusually gentle while some were restless. When the forces were combined, they could reject each other. Once the warriors had mastered the second move, their power would increase exponentially.</p>

  <p>So far Luo Zheng had only managed to combine two stars. The more stars Luo Zheng could combine in the future, the stronger his power of the second move would be.</p>

  <p>In truth, the second move alone could be used as a separate martial skill and therefore it would take a long time to cultivate.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng separated his hands, the purple and orange star lights became intertwined. The two different types of star powers, like boiling water, formed a small body of light. A faint colorful mist was emitting from within and it looked like it could erupt at any moment.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng cultivated, he had mixed the two star lights together, but he could extract only very little power, about the size of a grain of rice. Even then, the power that erupted from it was difficult to imagine. Luo Zheng struggled to control it and almost blew himself up several times.</p>

  <p>Now these two types of star lights mixed together and could form a small ball the size of a fist that was constantly boiling. If it exploded in his hands, even if he had his body like a high-grade fairy weapon, he would be turned to ashes in an instant.</p>

  <p>Overall, the success rate of the Double Star Brilliance was only about 40%.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng hadn't fully grasped it yet, so this was a great risk for him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng carefully stabilized the star lights in his hands. He saw the two bright yellow Life and Death Winds slowly approaching him.</p>

  <p>His eyes flashed and he threw the fist-sized star light ball at Eddie.</p>

  <p>Whir...</p>

  <p>Time started to slow down and even came to a stop. The light in the sky became dimmer and dimmer and all the fights stopped.</p>

  <p>Everyone saw the two winds easily pass by the ball of light and how Eddie and Luo Zheng exchanged angry looks.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng feared the Life and Death Wind. He didn't know what it was or what it could do. It didn't seem to possess a great power but a gentle blow could kill everyone.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Eddie was afraid of the small ball of light that was rapidly flying towards him. The ball of light that Luo Zheng had thrown contained power that he could not imagine. Even though he had turned into a fiend and his body had reached the limits of life, he still would not be able to block it.</p>

  <p>If he was hit by it, he would probably die.</p>

  <p>When this thought flashed past Eddie's mind, he didn't dare to stop for even a second. He began to retreat rapidly.</p>

  <p>In just a few seconds, the small ball of light split open.</p>

  <p>Years later, this fight became known among the warriors in the Central Region as the Defense Battle of Oracle City, and those who had participated in this battle would always bring up the moment of the fight between Luo Zheng and Eddie. This had been an unforgettable moment for hundreds of thousands of warriors. Not even time could erase it from their memories.</p>

  <p>This story had become a legend to be passed down from generation to generation in the Central Region.</p>

  <p>Everyone saw the two-color ball of light burst apart and two different star lights shooting up to the sky. The sky lit up and a massive fireball appeared in the sky.</p>

  <p>Eddie was standing at the center, and everything within a radius of a few miles around him disappeared, including a section of city wall.</p>

  <p>A piece of land and everything on it disappeared in a blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>Those who survived the blast had been imminently hit by its sound and thundering strength which caused blood to trickle down their ears.</p>

  <p>All the martial artists fixed their eyes on Eddie's frightening power and ignored Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The two Life and Death Winds were like true Death Gods as they blew in front of Luo Zheng and Ning Yudie. They were unstoppable and could pierce through everything, including space and time.</p>

  <p>Desperate thoughts crossed through Zheng's mind. 'What should I do? How can I defeat the Life and Death Winds? Would Xun know how? Would the knowledgeable and talented cyan dragon know how to fight this?'</p>

  <p>Just as these thoughts ran through his mind, the two winds hit him and Ning Yudie separately as if consciously targeting each one of them.</p>

  <p>"Puff! Puff!" There was a faint sound that could barely be heard.</p>

  <p>There was no way out.</p>

  <p>When the Life and Death Wind possessed Zheng's body, he felt completely powerless. He turned around and looked at Ning Yudie. He saw her staring back at him with frightened eyes.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng felt that his life force was slipping away at an alarming rate, and so did Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>She no longer looked like the authoritative leader of the Could Hall. Her face was filled with panic, just like a lost little girl searching for her home.</p>

  <p>She kept staring at Luo Zheng without saying a word but looking as scared as ever.</p>

  <p>Out of nowhere, Luo Zheng heard a faint voice talking to him. It was the cyan dragon in his head. "I remember now. The Life and Death Wind contains a trace of the Law of Causality, so it is powerful. I wonder if the Heavenly Fragment can resist it."</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon was speaking in his mind but his voice sounded like it was coming from far away, as if he was speaking from the horizon.</p>

  <p>"What is the Law of Causality?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng asked, but he found that he couldn't pass on his consciousness to the cyan dragon. He stood there helplessly looking at Ning Yudie when, suddenly, as if pushed by an invisible force, she was thrown into his arms and they both fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>"The Law of Causality is a principle that states nothing can happen without a cause. Life is the cause and death is the effect. Therefore, if one touches the Life and Death Wind, he will die," Xun said. She continued, "Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng! You have to use your life vitality to open your space ring and take out the Heavenly Fragment."</p>

  <p>Her voice also sounded far away and unreal. Luo Zheng felt his body become numb and rigid. He thought he was slowly dying.</p>

  <p>Xun couldn't use his space ring because it had his mark. If she forced it open, the entire Sumeru Space would explode. In this instant, Luo Zheng felt too weak to use his life vitality. He was so tired and sleepy. Right now all he wanted to do was to curl up and sleep.</p>

  <p>His father hoped his journey of life never ended. Could this be the end of his life journey?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng struggled to open his eyes. He saw Ning Yudie lying in his arms with a serene face as if asleep and having a beautiful dream. Luo Zheng felt grateful.</p>

  <p>'Maybe this is a good ending. Maybe this is a good way to go without pain, ' he thought.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng! Use your life vitality! Just a little is enough!" He could hear Xun's voice again. "Do you want to die? Use it now! Think about your sister! She's still in Eddie's hands! Even if Eddie dies, the others will never let her go. Do you want that to happen?"</p>

  <p>Yan Luo!</p>

  <p>As he heard his sister's name, his heart started beating again. It was a weak and faint beat, but he had come back from the dead. He woke up. He had to save Yan. He couldn't give up now!</p>

  <p>A wisp of life vitality came out of his belly and flew through his meridians, directly pouring into the space ring. The seal that had once locked the ring had been broken and it had become ownerless.</p>

  <p>Xun quickly took out a small fragment from the ring. This fragment had a phoenix pattern engraved on it. As carefully as possible she activated the power within the fragment.</p>

  <p>The Law of Causality reigned all other laws. It was an unreasonable and tyrannical law that stood above all powers when compared with the various Original Laws of the world.</p>

  <p>The natural law was the foundation of all causality, but even Xun wasn't sure if the fragment could destroy the causality that formed the Life and Death Winds.</p>
