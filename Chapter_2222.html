</p>

  <p>It did not take much time for Luo Luo Zheng to conclude the fight and emerge victorious.</p>

  <p>Watching this feat, all the female disciples in the Nameless Hall were amazed.</p>

  <p>It was beyond them to understand how Luo Luo Zheng had won all both the battles with such ease. Were his opponents really too weak to hold on even for merely a few minutes while fighting with Luo Luo Zheng?</p>

  <p>"Is it possible for Tianxing to be more powerful than Shauna?"</p>

  <p>"No, of course not! He cannot be compared to her! Shauna has mastered a Divine Dao. Moreover, her points at that time were high, and the opponents she encountered were much more powerful."</p>

  <p>"They are in completely different league zones. Tianxing has just entered the Jade Wall of Legends, and the opponents he encounters won't be that powerful."</p>

  <p>The entire time, the female disciples were discussing among themselves in hushed tones.</p>

  <p>Shauna, about whom they were discussing, was once considered the best cultivator among the proving godly warriors in the Purple Soul Hall. Not long after entering the Purple Soul Hall, she had shown her extraordinary talent. She easily won every battle after she entered the Arena of Legends.</p>

  <p>Recently through her achievements, she had become a True God.</p>

  <p>Despite all these accomplishments, they could not help but compare Shauna with the newcomer, who was showing some remarkable skills.</p>

  <p>Madam Moon was not expecting this at all. With her typical skeptical attitude towards anything, she actually thought that there was something wrong with the Jade Wall of Legends. She was not ready to accept the fact that Luo Luo Zheng completed two battles so quickly, with one lasing for a minute and the other less than 30 seconds.</p>

  <p>The opponents that Luo Luo Zheng encountered could not be really that weak. After all, this was the Floating Island, and his opponents weren't those ordinary divine citizens outside of the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>It only meant that Tianxing's strength was far too powerful, and the difference in strength was enough to pulverize his opponents to mere pulp.</p>

  <p>Madam Moon had in fact accepted Luo Zheng's strength, but she didn't say it out loud. She continued to frown as she said, "Go and fight again!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng said nothing, as he turned to activate the jade token again.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng was enveloped by a gentle light, Madame Moon began to count the time in her mind.</p>

  <p>She still wanted to see if Luo Luo Zheng was really that outstanding. Would it take only seconds for him to take every opponent down?</p>

  <p>One, two, three...</p>

  <p>In fact, Madam Moon was not the only one who was counting the time.</p>

  <p>The female disciples were also curious about how long it would take for Luo Luo Zheng to finish this battle.</p>

  <p>By the time they reached the 18th second, the figures on the Jade Wall of Legends changed. The gentle light that enveloped Luo Luo Zheng disappeared, and he retreated from the Arena of Legends.</p>

  <p>"Eighteen seconds."</p>

  <p>"He has yet again won another battle and accumulated twelve points in total."</p>

  <p>"His points surpassed even mine!"</p>

  <p>In the Arena of Legends, the points were obtained from their opponents.</p>

  <p>Technically speaking, the more the battles a warrior won, the higher the points they would receive, thereby, receiving a higher ranking.</p>

  <p>The three female disciples who had been punished by Madam Moon all had negative points, so they were ranked in the last three hundred in the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>To be specific, they were ranked within the last three hundred among the proving godly warriors.</p>

  <p>In the Arena of Legends, the battles were divided into five levels. The first level were battles between proving godly warriors, the second level between low-rank True Gods, the third level between mid-rank True Gods and the fourth level between top-rank True Gods.</p>

  <p>The last level was between the Martial Kings. The warriors that fought in the Battles of Martial Kings were the powerful ones like Harold, Augustus etc.</p>

  <p>In fact, as Luo Luo Zheng had successively won the battles in the level of proving godly warriors, the opponents that Luo Luo Zheng would be facing would get even stronger. However, in the level of battles between proving godly warriors, Luo Zheng's first opponent was Herman, who was qualified to be ranked top among the proving godly warriors.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's strength had long surpassed the strength of Herman or all the other proving godly warriors. All it remained to see was that if the warriors who had the highest points among the proving godly warriors, were able to defeat him.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng did not collect sufficient points right now, so it was not possible to meet those people.</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng had fought three battles, Madam Moon's perception towards Luo Luo Zheng completely changed.</p>

  <p>Madam Moon was extremely strict, and was loathed by many proving godly warriors and True Gods. However, she was extremely loyal and devoted, and all she did was for the sake of her master Joy.</p>

  <p>Now that she realized Luo Zheng's true value, she would definitely refrain from speaking ill about him.</p>

  <p>This time, however, before Madam Moon could speak, Luo Luo Zheng activated his jade token again.</p>

  <p>And the time that he used to end the fourth round was much shorter.</p>

  <p>From the time he entered the arena to the time he came out, it merely took six seconds.</p>

  <p>This was an impossible feat! In such a short period of time, there was hardly any time to act. Even then, Luo Luo Zheng managed to win one more match and gain 8 more points, totaling to 20 points.</p>

  <p>As the light faded away, Luo Luo Zheng looked at the baffled expressions of the crowd and gave an embarrassed smile. He explained, "I met the first opponent again. He actually admitted defeat without fight."</p>

  <p>It turned out that Luo Luo Zheng met Herman, his first opponent, in the Arena of Legends.</p>

  <p>After Herman was defeated by Luo Luo Zheng in the first round, he had two consecutive wins. With his strength, he was quickly able to accumulate points by defeating ordinary proving godly warriors. He didn't expect that he would encounter Luo Luo Zheng again after two consecutive wins. He could only attribute this to his bad luck.</p>

  <p>Herman was a wise man. Although he was very confident about his own strength, he was well aware about Tianxing's strength. He knew that he would not have a chance to win, so he might as well admit defeat directly.</p>

  <p>Therefore, in the eyes of Madam Moon and the others, Luo Luo Zheng had made a record that shocked everyone.</p>

  <p>As per the promise made to Madam Moon, Luo Luo Zheng completed all five battles. She did not ask Luo Luo Zheng to continue. Instead, she asked him to put away his jade token. At the same time, she said to the female disciples present, "You can enter the Arena of Legends on your own."</p>

  <p>Hearing the order of Madam Moon, those female disciples took out their jade tokens and stepped forward to put them into the grooves beneath the Jade Wall of Legends.</p>

  <p>This Jade Wall of Legends was as wide as a thousand feet and could allow three to four hundred people to enter into the Arena of Legends at the same time. Moreover, on the Floating Islands, there were numerous such kinds of Jade Walls.</p>

  <p>"The master has sent Mae to personally bring you here. She definitely has an eye for exceptional individuals. Tianxing, you were outstanding today," Madam Moon said with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>Hearing her words, Luo Luo Zheng muttered to himself, 'Just a while ago you doubted your master's judgment and were going to drive me out of this island. And now you completely contradict yourself!'</p>

  <p>"This hall is for all the disciples to cultivate. If you face any challenges in your cultivation, feel free to ask anyone in the Purple Soul Hall. If you have time, I suggest you come here more often and earn more points in the Arena of Legends", Madam Moon said.</p>

  <p>"What are the benefits of earning points?" Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Honestly speaking, Luo Luo Zheng wasn't interested in coming into the Arena of Legends every day to challenge those proving godly warriors.</p>

  <p>At this stage, all Luo Luo Zheng was interested in was to break through his bottleneck and condense his Godly Tile.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did not want to enter the Arena of Legends just to earn points in order to help the Han Clan to improve the ranking of their Floating Island.</p>

  <p>"Benefits of earning points?" A strange smile appeared on the face of Madam Moon. She then said in a stern tone, "Don't you know that the statuses of all of the Floating Islands on the Time Sea and all of the clans are decided by the Jade Wall of Legends?"</p>

  <p>As Master Evil had said, the only reason they wanted to enter the Floating Islands was that all the entrances to the forbidden areas were controlled by the noble clans of the Floating Islands. It was extremely difficult for True Gods who were from the grass root level to enter the forbidden areas. They probably wouldn't get a chance even in their whole lifetime.</p>

  <p>The warriors and True Gods in the Floating Islands had to fight to get a chance to enter the forbidden areas. The number of points they got was one of the conditions that could help them gain the qualification to enter those forbidden areas, and the requirement for the number of points varied in different forbidden places.</p>

  <p>The points could not only help warriors obtain the qualifications to enter the forbidden areas, but the Han Clan would also offer very attractive rewards and even privileges according to the rankings of the warriors' points.</p>

  <p>It could be said that the points in the Arena of Legends were only second to the divine might coins for the warriors on the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, they were even more important than the divine might coins.</p>

  <p>Madam Moon patiently explained all the details to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Understood." Luo Luo Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>It had to be appreciated that the powerful clans on the Floating Islands did find an effective method to motivate everyone to work hard after countless divine eras' exploration.</p>

  <p>The Arena of Legends did not involve the Holy Beings. But if the strength of True Gods in a Floating Island weakened, the ranking of the Floating Island would also decline, which forced those Holy Beings to do their best to train the warriors on the Floating Island as well as their own disciples.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng would definitely earn the points in the Arena of Legends, but before that, he wanted to see the reward the Han Clan had to offer to the warriors.</p>
