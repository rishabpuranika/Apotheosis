<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng had always been observing the Evil God with the omniscient power.</p>

  <p>He could hear the conversation between the Evil God and the downgrader as clear as day.</p>

  <p>He tensed up and was on guard when he heard the downgrader mention Clarence. He knew very well the sort of temperament the Evil God had and how he could explode in a rage at any moment.</p>

  <p>Now that the Evil God knew Clarence was in Zheng's body, he would no doubt make a move. But Zheng was ready for it, ready to react.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>The Evil God's eyes flashed in surprise at the sight of the broken energy ring.</p>

  <p>It was not only Zheng's quick reaction that had shocked him, but also the fact that the energy ring was the Controlling Field, and Zheng should not have been able to combat the energy of the sixth-grade world.</p>

  <p>That Zheng could crush the Controlling Field with a mere gentle pinch was inconceivable.</p>

  <p>The Evil God soon calmed himself; he also possessed the omniscient power. With a quick search through his mind, the image of Zheng trying the energies of the higher-grade worlds came to him.</p>

  <p>"How about we take this elsewhere?" Zheng suggested.</p>

  <p>"No need!" the Evil God replied.</p>

  <p>Lightning flashed from one of his hands. Two triangular plates flashed with lightning.</p>

  <p>"Lightning Weight!"</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The lightning that struck out from the strike of his palm was a million times brighter than the sun, and contained enough energy to destroy the Source World three hundred thousand times, let alone this courtyard in the fairy palace. It would have turned an Eternal Realm warrior such as Fuxi to powder by its immense power.</p>

  <p>As the triangular plates made contact with Zheng's body, a small Space Weight appeared in each of the four corners of the small courtyard. All the energy that had erupted from the Lightning Weight was sealed within the courtyard.</p>

  <p>The fairy palace shook only slightly, and the Snake Goddess, Fuxi and the others didn't even feel it at all.</p>

  <p>Zheng noticed that the Evil God was about to make another move and stretched a hand towards the sky.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>The black ship crashed into the side of the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven, Shera and Edna all looked on at the Snake Goddess and her companions in the fairy palace in a daze.</p>

  <p>"Now why don't we go somewhere else?" asked Zheng defiantly.</p>

  <p>"Are you threatening me?" The Evil God's eyes burned with danger.</p>

  <p>"What if I am?" Zheng asked, grinning.</p>

  <p>The Evil God had once not cared about anything, but things might have changed.</p>

  <p>His figure silently and gradually vanished, instantly appearing at the other end of the chaos.</p>

  <p>Zheng knew his location by way of the omniscient power and appeared in front of him.</p>

  <p>They were in an absolute void, where there was not even a speck of dust for trillions of miles.</p>

  <p>"We won't need to hold back here," announced Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, the Evil God was in no hurry to make a move. He seemed to be lost in thought. After a long while, he said, "I will not kill you. All you need to do is ask Clarence to come out and let me devour him. I'm sure I'll find a way to end the downgrading from him."</p>

  <p>Zheng grinned, beaming with amusement, as if he'd been told a joke. Just as he was about to offer his retort, a light emerged from his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>It was a gentle and soft ball of light, which made both Zheng and the Evil God feel as though they were bathing in a spring breeze, calm and serene.</p>

  <p>"You will not be able to find a way to end the downgrading from me. But you may still have a chance if you merge with Zheng."</p>

  <p>It was Clarence's voice that came from the ball of light. He did not seem angered by the Evil God's remarks, and instead attempted to patiently persuade him.</p>

  <p>"It seems that you have this idea, too?" inquired the Evil God.</p>

  <p>"Yes," answered Clarence.</p>

  <p>"Then..." The Evil God's eyes sparked with an idea. "Let's fight with our own abilities then!"</p>

  <p>Before he could get a response, he threw a hand towards Zheng and a blood red vine shot out. This was the Cube energy of the ninth-grade world.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Zheng disappeared faster than the blink of an eye and retreated more than a thousand miles. But with the power of omniscience, locating him was easy work for the Evil God and he followed closely behind Zheng's teleportation.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng was omniscient as well. Faced with the blood red vine, he retaliated by materializing a long black sword with the Cube energy. He raised his hand up and slashed down hard.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The black sword sliced the blood red vine, releasing a diamond shaped light that spanned hundreds of thousands of miles.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>When the black sword slashed the vine once more, Zheng and the Evil God had already moved a million miles away and another huge diamond shaped light spot exploded.</p>

  <p>The Evil God kept up his attack, while Zheng continued defending.</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish! Swish!</p>

  <p>They began clashing more and more, faster and faster and the number of diamond shaped light spots increased as well.</p>

  <p>Within a few seconds, they had already clashed tens of thousands of times and crossed a trillion miles of space, and the diamond shaped lights had turned to tiny needles in the distance behind them.</p>

  <p>"Was this strength given to you by Clarence?" asked the Evil God as he continued his fierce assault.</p>

  <p>"Does it make a difference?" Zheng asked back.</p>

  <p>"Even if you possess the power of the higher-grade worlds, you are still weak!"</p>

  <p>He gently drew back the blood red vine as he spoke. A chill then spread and threads of ice as thin as hair rushed at Zheng's head. He had put the Cold Phase to use.</p>

  <p>Zheng felt as if his blood was about to freeze as he was overtaken by the overwhelming coldness.</p>

  <p>However, when the Evil God had used the Cold Phase, Zheng's eyes were already burning with flames of the Fire Phase of the tenth-grade world.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>The Fire Phase produced very ordinary flames, no different from those from normal wood.</p>

  <p>But with a roll of the flames, all the ice threads melted and were burnt to nothing.</p>

  <p>This caused the Evil God's brow to furrow.</p>

  <p>Zheng had been defending passively.</p>

  <p>But no matter what sort of energy he threw at him, Zheng was able to effortlessly and rapidly deflate it. He suddenly felt as if all was not right and that he might be in danger, as if he had been seen through.</p>

  <p>"Go on," Zheng said calmly.</p>

  <p>The Evil God made up his mind and released even more terrifying energy.</p>

  <p>Thick scales surfaced from his body and wrapped him tightly.</p>

  <p>The scales, created by the Ghost Hand race with the Frequency energy, were harder than any other. With his new armor on, the Evil God pounced once again.</p>

  <p>"Shatter!"</p>

  <p>Zheng clasped his hands together and a small square appeared between them.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The small square exploded along with the Evil God's armor.</p>

  <p>The Evil God then burst into laughter. He had darted above Zheng's head and already had a long spear pressed against his forehead.</p>

  <p>The spear was made of the Annihilation Coke. As the strongest destructive force in the twelfth-grade world, nothing could block it.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>He thrust the spear down and the Restriction Field at the edge of the chaos disappeared.</p>

  <p>As long as the Restriction Field was still there, this area was a part of the Source World, and the Evil God and Zheng would be omniscient and revived infinitely.</p>

  <p>To Kill Zheng, the Evil God would have to remove the Restriction Field and destroy the primitive land.</p>

  <p>His long spear pierced through Zheng's forehead, just as the Restriction Field was withdrawn.</p>
