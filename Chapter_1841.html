<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, the six sacred places for trial contained different original powers.</p>

  <p>For instance, the Kaleidoscope race controlled the Original Laws, the Harmony race controlled the soul source, and the Skyland race controlled the vitality source.</p>

  <p>A crack extended all the way down from the bottom of the Sacred Spring Mountain. It turned out that it was the entrance that led to the strength source.</p>

  <p>The sounds of footsteps receded as Chapman and some of the elders of the Collapsing Mountain race stopped in front of the entrance.</p>

  <p>The amount of strength source one could obtain depended on many things such as luck, strength, knowledge, and anything else, really. But with all those factors, one still had to rely on oneself.</p>

  <p>According to the usual practice, the first to enter were the Collapsing Mountain warriors, followed by the warriors from the other races.</p>

  <p>However, this time was an exception.</p>

  <p>This time, Luo Luo Zheng was the first to enter, followed by the Collapsing Mountain warriors, and finally the martial artists from other races.</p>

  <p>There was no trace of hesitation on Luo Luo Zheng at all. He had unintentionally trespassed the Collapsing Mountain race's territory and got to be assisted by the race, but this was an incomparably precious opportunity.</p>

  <p>He knew that if it wasn't for this, he would have been still working hard in the teleporting area. He would also have to pay a hefty price if he wanted to enter any of the six great trial places, and time was the one thing he couldn't afford.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the Sacred race had already crossed the Sighing Wall.</p>

  <p>The entire universe was in a precarious state, even though it was unclear why their True Gods had not appeared. In any case, Luo Luo Zheng had to seize every chance to improve himself.</p>

  <p>The fabric of Luo Zheng's clothes fluttered. He already felt the wind that blew from the inside of the huge cave before he even got close to it.</p>

  <p>However, this gale's speed wasn't considered fast, or at least it was far from the point where it could produce wind blades. Such a gale was only a gentle breeze to martial artists, and posed no threats at all.</p>

  <p>Yet just as Luo Luo Zheng came into contact with the gust of the cold wind, his whole body quickly retreated backwards!</p>

  <p>The seemingly insignificant gust of cold wind had pushed him hundreds of feet away from the cave's entrance.</p>

  <p>"There is a great power hidden within this wind?"</p>

  <p>When Chapman saw what happened, he couldn't help but say, "Luo Luo Zheng, the wind and strength source are in a convective flow, which is combined with the weak wind formed by the strength source. You can't fight against it with your strength, but the wind is intermittent."</p>

  <p>"Thank you for reminding me," Luo Luo Zheng said and nodded.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was polite enough to thank him because even if Chapman hadn't said anything, he would still be able to figure out the crux of the matter.</p>

  <p>Now, Luo Luo Zheng was much more careful the second time he entered. He quietly approached the cave from the other side as his whole body clung to the mountain wall, and tried his best to avoid being blown by the weak wind.</p>

  <p>Then, he stretched out an arm when he neared the edge of the cave.</p>

  <p>It was at that moment when Luo Luo Zheng didn't feel the wind, nor did he rush in.</p>

  <p>Instead, he waited patiently at the side. Since he knew that the weak wind was intermittent, he'd have to estimate the wind's interval.</p>

  <p>"Whirl, whoosh..."</p>

  <p>The hairs on Luo Zheng's arm swayed slightly at the faint breeze. Then, he immediately felt a strong force which pushed his arm away.</p>

  <p>Even though Luo Luo Zheng had only used one hand to sense the wind, the force sent his body flying in a circle before he slammed heavily against a mountain wall on the side.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Luo Zheng's physical body was not what it used to be. Otherwise, he would have been seriously injured.</p>

  <p>Still, Luo Luo Zheng was shocked as he crawled up from the ground. Was the power contained within the strength source actually that terrifying to such a degree?!</p>

  <p>Soon enough, Luo Luo Zheng no longer dared to use his hand to feel the weak wind.</p>

  <p>Instead, he lightly pulled down a strip of cloth from his waist and threw it at the cave's entrance.</p>

  <p>"Pfft!"</p>

  <p>Since the piece of cloth was almost weightless, Luo Luo Zheng assumed that it could flow with the wind. Alas, the power contained in the strength source had quickly torn it into shreds.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Luo Luo Zheng tore open a few more strips of cloth and stretched them towards the entrance of the cave to probe.</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng had used about ten strips of cloth, he stretched another piece of cloth towards the cave entrance once again. This time, there was no more reaction from the inside.</p>

  <p>"Now is the time!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng wasted no time as he quickly transformed into a beam of light and entered the cave.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh?"</p>

  <p>He did not know the cave's terrain, but he didn't have the time to observe the surroundings--he just relied on his instincts to rush forward.</p>

  <p>There were times when Luo Luo Zheng slammed into the cave's silver walls, and bounced off to the other side with a dull thud before he continued onward.</p>

  <p>In a mere blink of an eye, Luo Luo Zheng had traveled about three hundred feet already. It was then when Luo Luo Zheng discovered that the way ahead stretched quite far ahead, but there was a large, dark pit nearby.</p>

  <p>His subconscious led him into the pit!</p>

  <p>There was a whistling sound behind Luo Luo Zheng the moment he entered. It sounded like a weak wind that blew through several stones in the cave.</p>

  <p>"Whew, that was close. If I didn't hide in this pit, I might've been blown away by this strange wind again!"</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng stopped in the huge pit for a while and confirmed that the weak wind had stopped, Luo Luo Zheng continued on his way in a flash.</p>

  <p>During his travel time, Luo Luo Zheng discovered that there were large pits that someone must've dug up on both sides of the long tunnel. These pits were around ten feet deep, and even the Collapsing Mountain warriors wouldn't have any problem getting inside them.</p>

  <p>The Collapsing Mountain warriors must've dug the pits, so that newcomers would have a temporary place to hide.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng continued to travel and whenever the wind came, he simply dipped down and hid in the pits, then came out when the wind stopped. He then proceeded forward in a roundabout manner.</p>

  <p>This Sacred Spring Mountain didn't look that big, but Luo Luo Zheng was surprised to find that the cave was so deep. Perhaps he had already passed the Sacred Spring Mountain and now travelled underground.</p>

  <p>"Hooo... hooo... hooo..."</p>

  <p>An hour later, the wind's howls grew louder. It was the point when Luo Luo Zheng didn't even need to probe around to know if the wind had stopped or started.</p>

  <p>'Am I close to the eye of the wind?' Luo Luo Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>If he passed through the eye of the wind, then he wouldn't be blown away anymore.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng noticed that he still had a way to go until he reached the eye of the wind.</p>

  <p>In addition, the intervals between the winds got shorter the closer he got to the eye. However, it would still be hard for him to cross the distance by taking advantage of the winds' intervals with his speed.</p>

  <p>No matter how difficult it was, Luo Luo Zheng would never give up. Yet after some consideration, he wasn't that confident that he could actually do it.</p>

  <p>"Hooo... ? hooo... ? hooo..."</p>

  <p>Three intervals had passed while he waited.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Luo Zheng's eyes flashed. His body was as light as a feather as he pushed off the ground and flew forward like a flying shuttle.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had never set a limit for himself. Even if he couldn't do it, he would still at least give it a shot!</p>

  <p>His body was a blur as he dashed towards the eye of the wind at an extremely fast speed!</p>

  <p>He had covered only two-thirds of the distance, when he heard a wind's sharp whistle out of the blue.</p>

  <p>"Hoo..."</p>

  <p>The closer he got to the eye of the wind, the more concentrated the wind was. The strength source contained in the weak wind wasn't really strong in the first place.</p>

  <p>Yet when the weak wind blew, Luo Luo Zheng felt as if a hammer had been smashed into his chest. The strong force immediately pushed him backwards.</p>

  <p>"I failed?"</p>

  <p>His face dimmed, and there was a trace of doubt in his eyes.</p>

  <p>He knew that his speed wasn't slow. If he couldn't break through the eye of the wind, then what more for the others?</p>

  <p>He suddenly raised his head at the exact moment the weak wind hit and blew him away.</p>

  <p>He had done his best, but he still couldn't break into the eye of the wind.</p>

  <p>The problem was not on him, so he must have overlooked something!</p>

  <p>"Up there!"</p>

  <p>When he raised his head, he saw that there was another cave above him.</p>

  <p>Apparently, the wind was split into two. One wind blew horizontally in the cave where Luo Luo Zheng travelled, and the other wind blew towards the cave that was above him!</p>

  <p>In other words, Luo Zheng's destination wasn't actually the eye of the wind--but the cave above!</p>

  <p>Once Luo Luo Zheng had realized the situation, he stomped his feet on the ground.</p>

  <p>He took advantage of the wind's force that was smashing on his body, then forcefully knocked himself into the cave above him.</p>

  <p>"Bang! Bong!"</p>

  <p>The force of the wind blew so hard that Luo Luo Zheng was like a kite that bumped around the cave. He finally rushed upwards, but the wind's power didn't decrease at all.</p>

  <p>He didn't know how many times he got hit, but he landed on the ground of the cave he aimed for when the wind stopped.</p>

  <p>Although his body was a divine weapon, such a violent collision still made him dizzy.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Luo Zheng stopped and before he could get up from the ground, he was greeted by a stream of rainbow-colored water that gushed out right in front of him. The spring water's beauty was simply indescribable.</p>

  <p>Moreover, just a glimpse of it made Luo Luo Zheng feel that he was full of strength.</p>
