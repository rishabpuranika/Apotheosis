<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 885 The Negotiation Broke Down (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>In the end, everyone's gaze completely fixated on Zheng.</p>

  <p>Wearing a deadpan look on his face, Zheng appeared as if his mind was wandering somewhere else.</p>

  <p>Upon catching a glimpse of Zheng's expression, Maurice, as well as the other ogre war lords, all had to force themselves to remain composed, patiently waiting for him to say something.</p>

  <p>These war lords had been living for dozens, and some even hundreds, of years. At this point, each and every single one of them was gazing at a man who was barely even twenty years of age, anticipating what he was going to say. Truly, this was such a peculiar event.</p>

  <p>The ogres all had fiery tempers even from the time of their birth. One of the top-level war lords couldn't take it any longer and outright said, "Brat, haven't you made up your mind already? Five seats should already be more than adequate to give face to the human race!"</p>

  <p>The name of this top-level war lord was Bradley, and he belonged to the top ten top-level war lords of the ogres. Out of the 128 seat owners, he was ranked fourth, meaning to say, the power and standing he held were second only to Maurice within the ogres.</p>

  <p>Taking a brief apathetic look at the top-level war lord, Zheng was still thinking about what would be the best course of action to take. A hint of a scornful smile even slipped onto his face.</p>

  <p>"We can discuss this matter the easy way or the hard way. However, it's quite apparent that you'd rather choose the latter. If you continue acting like this, then you can just forget about those five seats. Even if it is just one seat, we still have to consider it carefully. And it's five seats that we're talking about here." Noticing the contemptuous smile on Zheng's face instantly ignited a fire inside Bradley's heart. He was beginning to fume with rage.</p>

  <p>As everyone around them would know, ogres tended to have a short fuse.</p>

  <p>That was in their nature.</p>

  <p>Realizing that the state of affairs wasn't looking good, Fabian and Jarrod became all strung up right away. Just where in God's name could Zheng be planning to go with this?</p>

  <p>Even though they were both thinking that, at this moment, they really couldn't say or do anything about it. Considering the fact that they were in the middle of a negotiation, they couldn't really afford to let the other party think that they didn't have much faith in themselves. So, they had no choice but to zip it.</p>

  <p>However, Fabian failed to keep it all to himself. As discreetly as he possibly could, he told Zheng through the use of his life vitality, "Zheng, maybe it would be best for us to agree with what they're offering. After all, we're already quite satisfied with having those five seats."</p>

  <p>Zheng was able to hear him clearly, but he simply acted as though he never heard anything.</p>

  <p>"Brat!" Eventually, it was Bradley's turn to lose his patience. He sprung up from his chair, feeling so irritated.</p>

  <p>It was at this moment that Zheng finally opened his mouth. Staring intently at Maurice, he remarked, "Peaceful coexistence?"</p>

  <p>Then, he proceeded to jeer at him, saying coldly, "When I stepped foot onto the first floor of the Tower of Sin, it didn't look like you wanted to live in peace with me. When I entered the second floor, it still didn't seem to be that way either. The third...the fourth...And even when I finally reached the tenth floor and went out of the Talent Tablet, it still didn't seem like you were intending to live in peace with me. It was only after I used the power of the Cursed Land to kill the two war sages of the ogres that you suddenly changed your mind. Now, you're telling me that you want to consider having a peaceful coexistence?"</p>

  <p>After hearing Zheng's remarks, Fabian and Jarrod instantly became even more ill at ease. It was made clear that they got a completely wrong idea, because, at first, Fabian simply thought that Zheng was intending to ask for even greater benefits for the human race.</p>

  <p>He never would've imagined that Zheng would be planning to do something entirely different. What could he possibly have in mind?</p>

  <p>There was a bizarre look on Esther's face, as she was wondering whether her ears were just playing tricks on her. 'It appears that Zheng's thirst wouldn't easily be quenched. He still couldn't be satisfied with just getting those five seats. But that somewhat makes sense. After all, he is a man that our mighty queen has been fond of. How far into the future is he peering? He never really has his eyes dead set on such an insignificant Tower of Sin in the first place. I guess it would be safe to say that even the seemingly boundless Sea God Continent wouldn't be enough for him to make the most of the talent he possesses.</p>

  <p>The stage which has been destined for this person must be the entire universe, and nothing less than that!'</p>

  <p>Esther thought to herself. Compared to the humans, she was pretty calm.</p>

  <p>A smile had been displayed on Maurice's face all this time. He had already tried his best to look friendly. After Zheng finished speaking, Maurice's expression gradually turned gloomy. "Since you don't intend to live in peace with us, what do you want?"</p>

  <p>The corner of Zheng's mouth slightly rose. "The ogres give up all their seats and get the hell out of the Tower of Sin!"</p>

  <p>As the words were coming out of his mouth one by one, Fabian, as well as the other humans present, had all been kept at the edge of their seats, holding their breaths. Esther, on the other hand, lowered her stance, preparing herself in case something happened, worrying that the ogre war lords might not be able to take it anymore and start a fight. And it wasn't just Esther, but all the other war lords of the Demon Night obviously became apprehensive, with their hearts pounding uncontrollably.</p>

  <p>The statement Zheng had just made left everyone around him in shock. Ogres went there, genuinely intending to cooperate with humans, and yet there he was, asking all of them to leave the Tower of Sin. The audacity this brat had! How could this be happening?</p>

  <p>Through all of that, Maurice was still unyielding in his huge seat. And despite the grim look he had on his face, he still wasn't showing any signs of being upset.</p>
