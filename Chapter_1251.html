  <p>
</p>

  <p>Although Mu Ning seemed rather stupid while dealing with most things, she was very clear on matters regarding affection.</p>

  <p>She was keenly aware that she could not monopolize Luo Zheng. She did not want other women to get close to him, but she also knew that Luo Zheng was promising and would become someone remarkable in the future. He had already become the strongest person in the Central Region at such a young age. Certainly, he would not be limited to the small Central Region in the time ahead.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning would be deeply satisfied if she were to marry such a famous talent. But how could she possibly attempt to control him?</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie had gone off in a huff, but Mu Ning just ignored her. Mu Ning was not someone to be trifled with. She could not sympathize with Ning Yudie, but she understood that Ning Yudie was important to Luo Zheng. She had said the words because she did not want to see Luo Zheng upset.</p>

  <p>"Why? What should I do if I go there?" Luo Zheng asked, forcing a smile.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning returned a smile, whispering into Zheng's ear, "Don't all women want to be coaxed? She is the hall leader, but she is still childish when it comes to affection. She will be happier if you coax her with a few nice words..."</p>

  <p>Margaret's voice sounded soft and pleasant as she talked to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled and kissed her lightly on the forehead. "You sound like you're very experienced."</p>

  <p>Margaret's face turned red, her eyes rolling as she shot Luo Zheng a coquettish glance. "Well, I'm not that experienced! I'm just giving you some advice!"</p>

  <p>However, Margaret's words calmed Luo Zheng down a little. Although he felt that it was not easy to deal with this matter, he still knew that there were some things that he had to face on his own.</p>

  <p>After arranging a place for Mu Ning to stay, he was prepared to enter the Cloud Hall. However, suddenly, the Ancestral Dragon in the spirit beast bag on Zheng's back stuck out its small head and let out a 'quack' toward Mu Ning. The dragon's face revealed a friendly expression.</p>

  <p>"This little dragon..." Luo Zheng began, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>When he had been in the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place, the Demon Night members had gifted him a small spirit beast bag.</p>

  <p>Normally, a Sumeru Space could not keep living creatures. However, the space of the spirit beast bag had been specifically designed and arranged for them. Although there wasn't much of it, it was enough for the young Ancestral Dragon to live inside.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the little dragon wanted to come out and get some fresh air after being stuffed up in the spirit beast bag for so long. This time, when it saw Mu Ning, it cried out to her and left the spirit beast bag to pounce at her.</p>

  <p>Besides considering Luo Zheng as its family, the Ancestral Dragon seemed to like Mu Ning very much. Luo Zheng was puzzled. Could it be because Mu Ning had the Purple Power Body? Or was it something else he did not know of? Luo Zheng could not afford to ponder on this at the moment. He decided to temporarily leave the Ancestral Dragon in Margaret's care. Transforming into a beam of light, he then flew toward the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>Although the Cloud Hall's sect-protecting array was still open, Luo Zheng chose to bypass a shortcut and straightaway went through the main entrance.</p>

  <p>Several guards were keeping watch at the main entrance of the Cloud Hall. When they saw Luo Zheng, they respectfully released a part of the enchanted barrier to let him in.</p>

  <p>After the battle between the Oracle City and the Heavenly Evil Sect, Luo Zheng returned to Cloud Hall after an entire year. However, he was still very familiar with its surroundings. As he went through the main hall, he swiftly made his way toward the Ice Palace.</p>

  <p>Just as he arrived at the entrance of the Ice Palace, Luo Zheng felt waves of cold air seep out from the inside.</p>

  <p>Observing the milky-white breath for a while, he walked deep into the cold air.</p>

  <p>However, just as Luo Zheng entered the palace, a few loud sounds broke through the air.</p>

  <p>'Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh!'</p>

  <p>Three dark blue ice spikes suddenly shot toward him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled as he watched the ice spikes rapidly come at him. His body flashed as he dodged them easily. However, just as he did so, another three ice spikes zoomed over.</p>

  <p>This time, Luo Zheng did not dodge the attack. Instead, he caught the ice spikes in his hand and threw them to the ground, resulting in a cracking sound.</p>

  <p>Ice spikes continued to shoot out from the white mist as Luo Zheng advanced, still getting attacked. As he continued to move toward the Ice Palace, he caught more than a hundred ice spikes along the way.</p>

  <p>They were getting faster and faster, their attacks getting stronger.</p>

  <p>"This..." Zheng's face betrayed a wry smile. It seemed that Ning Yudie was very annoyed with him this time. She seemed to have lost her temper. An ordinary Life and Death Realm warrior would not be able to withstand such sharp ice spikes.</p>

  <p>To Luo Zheng, however, these attacks were nothing special. In this great world, only the Soul Sea Realm masters could threaten him by making use of the domain. Life and Death Realm masters would not be able to kill him no matter how powerful they were, unless they destroyed the entire great world.</p>

  <p>'Whoosh!'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng quickened his pace and rushed into the depths of the Ice Palace.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie sat on the ground, her feet bare. Thousands of ice spikes floated in the air around her.</p>

  <p>When she saw Luo Zheng appear, she grew even more furious, a trace of grievance and disappointment on her face. She waved a hand callously and all the ice spikes shot toward Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Luo Zheng simply stood there without moving, his eyes closed.</p>

  <p>However, when she noticed that Luo Zheng stood still, not dodging them, Ning Yudie was astonished and frightened. The ice spikes that she had just released were powerful enough to kill ordinary Life and Death Realm masters. Ning Yudie knew that Zheng's physical body was strong and different from those of ordinary warriors, but no matter how strong and sturdy he was, he would not be able to withstand such an attack.</p>

  <p>She had initially thought that Luo Zheng could dodge easily, but she did not expect him to suddenly stand still. The ice spikes she had shot out were not far away from him now. She immediately screamed at him, "Dodge!</p>

  <p>You can't withstand them!"</p>

  <p>Clang, clang, clang…</p>

  <p>Thousands of ice spikes rushed to Luo Zheng at the same time and crashed into his body, turning into blue ice crystals and releasing sharp sounds.</p>

  <p>In no time, the shattered pieces of ice had buried Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie was scared witless. Although she hated Luo Zheng right now, she still cared for him. Running barefoot toward the pile of ice dregs in panic, she forgot that she could remove them easily. After all, the ice spikes had been transformed from her life vitality. With just a thought, she would be able to turn them into her life vitality once again.</p>

  <p>She used her bare hands to quickly dig into the pile of ice dregs as she kept shouting his name, "Luo Zheng? Luo Zheng!" Panic was written all over her face.</p>

  <p>However, just as Ning Yudie was digging with all her might, a hand suddenly stretched out from the pile of ice dregs and grabbed her waist, pulling her up to the dregs. Luo Zheng slowly climbed out.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Luo Zheng was safe and sound, Ning Yudie was both surprised and happy. However, anger and grievance replaced the emotions again.</p>

  <p>She had indeed been very worried just now. After all, her strength had increased manifold after she reached the Life and Death Realm. Her attack had been intense, but she did not expect Luo Zheng to emerge completely unharmed.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie was aware that since Luo Zheng had become a Life and Death Realm warrior, his strength had increased by a lot. She did not think that it would grow to this extent.</p>

  <p>"You... Get your hands off me!" Ning Yudie was shy and furious at the same time. Her small and soft body struggled in Zheng's embrace.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng wasn't willing to let go of her. He wrapped his arms around Yudie's waist even more tightly, holding her by his side. With Zheng's current strength, how could Ning Yudie break free?</p>

  <p>After struggling for a while, Ning Yudie was exhausted. Her stiff body relaxed, but she still had on a long face as she stared at Luo Zheng with hatred.</p>

  <p>An idea suddenly struck her. Streams of life vitality burst out from her body, condensing into a large number of ice crystals that wrapped around Luo Zheng and transformed into a huge ice coffin. As the ice crystals accumulated one layer at a time, the coffin got larger and larger, tightly freezing the two of them inside.</p>

  <p>The cold was indeed piercing, but Yudie's ferocious face only escalated Zheng's desire for her.</p>

  <p>It could be that Luo Zheng was unable to coax Ning Yudie with some nice words, but he could use his actions to prove his affection for her.</p>
