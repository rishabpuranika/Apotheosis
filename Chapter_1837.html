<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1837 Refusing Kennan's Food (Part One) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Since Kennan had found Han Liusu, he would simply take her away.</p>

  <p>However, Han Liusu refused to leave with him. Kennan soon found out that the crux of the problem came from Luo Luo Zheng. It was obvious that the Princess Royal still believed that flower vendor and thought that Luo Luo Zheng could take her to the Soul Suppressing Cliff.</p>

  <p>"Friend, I'm afraid that I'll have to ask you to go with us this time,"</p>

  <p>Kennan said as he stared indifferently at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Last time, Kennan had gotten too close to death because of the Formless Sky Python. His Wishing Spell hadn't been unlocked yet, until now.</p>

  <p>While it was true that the Wishing Spell could greatly increase his strength in a short period of time, he would have to realize the wish he had made if he used the technique. It also meant that if he couldn't kill the Formless Sky Python, then he'd be unable to use the Wishing Spell again. Moreover, he would have a flaw if he didn't realize his wish, which could be detrimental to him in the future.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had only wanted to protect himself on that day, so he had kidnapped the Princess Royal and fled all the way to the Collapsing Mountain race.</p>

  <p>Kennan and the warriors with him naturally didn't know what to think of Luo Luo Zheng--but now that they had found the Princess Royal, they would bring him back, too.</p>

  <p>An authoritative air enveloped Kennan as he spoke to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Why should I go back with you?" Luo Luo Zheng asked with a faint smile. He had just got a firm foothold in the Collapsing Mountain race. There was no way he'd leave so easily.</p>

  <p>Besides, Kennan wasn't Han Liusu who actually had something to ask of him. Thus, he coldly shot back, "I'm afraid it isn't up for you to decide. Danyaal, Douglas, take him away!"</p>

  <p>In his opinion, a secondary creature at the Spirit Supreme Realm was not qualified to bargain with him.</p>

  <p>Once Kennan was done speaking, the two martial arts practitioners behind him prepared to take Luo Luo Zheng away.</p>

  <p>But before the two of them could even move, a group of warriors from the Collapsing Mountain race suddenly appeared behind them. Their bulky bodies looked like small mountains as they surrounded the others, and they certainly did not look friendly.</p>

  <p>Now that Luo Luo Zheng was considered as the Collapsing Mountain race's distinguished guest and they had something to ask of him, how could they allow him to leave?</p>

  <p>The Collapsing Mountain warriors looked quite intimidating that even though Kennan and the other warriors with him were world lords, they still felt a lot of pressure.</p>

  <p>"Respected heroes of the Collapsing Mountain race, I am Pascal's subordinate, and on behalf of the master of our clan, I'd like to extend my thanks to you for taking good care of our Miss at your place,"</p>

  <p>Kennan said calmly while he cupped his hands.</p>

  <p>An old man from the Collapsing Mountain race smiled faintly at him. "It seemed that the Miss of your Han Clan has not yet submitted her trial tally, yet we still let her in. We have already shown our respect to Pascal by that!"</p>

  <p>In return, Kennan gently flipped his arm and two purple jade symbols appeared in his hands. The jade symbols were shaped like small knives and flashed with a mysterious color.</p>

  <p>The most important things in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land were the trial tallies. All of the trial tallies were divided into five colors: black, purple, red, green, and white. They functioned both as the keys to the small and large sacred places for trial, and as the currency of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. Therefore, they could be circulated and traded.</p>

  <p>The black trial tallies were ranked first and were the most difficult to obtain in the entire Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. The purple trial tallies were second and were the tickets used to enter the six sacred places for trial, so they were considered very valuable. Since Han Liusu enjoyed a special status, she had purple trial tallies. Meanwhile, ordinary martial artists and even those who came from the divine land would have to exert more effort to obtain a purple trial tally.</p>

  <p>Just as Kennan had brought out the trial tallies, the old man from the Collapsing Mountain race raised his hand and stopped him. "No need.</p>

  <p>Pascal had made contributions to our race in the past, so there is no need for these purple trial tallies. However, you cannot take this human kid away," he said.</p>

  <p>"Why?" Kennan asked. His lips curved into a slight frown.</p>

  <p>"Because this person is very important to our race," the old man said flatly.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Kennan looked at Luo Luo Zheng in shock.</p>

  <p>If his memory served him right, this man just came to the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land quite recently?</p>

  <p>It was known that it wasn't easy for the newcomers in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land to enter a sacred place for trial such as the Collapsing Mountain race. Not to mention, Luo Luo Zheng was only at the Spirit Supreme Realm. It was all thanks to the Princess Royal that he was able to enter this place.</p>

  <p>Was this man really that important to the Collapsing Mountain race?</p>

  <p>Kennan found it truly hard to believe what the old man had said.</p>

  <p>Although the members of the Collapsing Mountain race had always been unreasonable, they had one great merit? they never lied.</p>

  <p>If they said that Luo Luo Zheng was important to them, then it must be true.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Kennan found himself in a difficult situation. The Princess Royal must be brought back, or else Kennan wouldn't be able to bear the wrath of the Holy Emperor.</p>

  <p>Then again, it would be hard for them to convince the Princess Royal to go with them if they chose not to take Luo Luo Zheng away. She was too stubborn.</p>

  <p>Since she refused to go obediently with them, Kennan had no choice but to use force. Kennan turned his head and met Liusu's eyes. The Holy Emperor had instructed them that if the Princess Royal became too rebellious, they could forcefully bring her back for her safety. After all, her safety was the first priority.</p>
