<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1718 Heaven Opening Sword Book </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Since Luo Luo Zheng had never stepped into the Divine Dao, his Chaotic Gods-intimidating Strike had never been completed and it still had a flaw.</p>

  <p>He also knew that the sword in his hand was doing its utmost to make up for this flaw.</p>

  <p>But since this flaw was from his Emotion Closing Divine Dao, something he had yet to completely comprehend, it was impossible for the sword to completely fix the flaw.</p>

  <p>What was more, Tianming's sword was way too sharp, beyond anyone's imagination.</p>

  <p>His keen observation of Luo Zheng's flaw had helped him break Luo Zheng's Chaotic Gods-intimidating Strike pretty easily.</p>

  <p>However, things were different at the moment.</p>

  <p>He could sense that the cold power had an incomparably powerful internal momentum.</p>

  <p>And it wasn't from the Emotion Closing Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>But the internal momentum had almost made up for the flaw once it had been infused into the Chaotic Gods-intimidating Strike.</p>

  <p>Perhaps it could no longer be described as making up.</p>

  <p>The internal momentum was far purer and much more powerful than Luo Zheng's Emotion Closing Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>So much that it had completely changed the attributes of Luo Zheng's sword.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng slashed his sword at Tianming, causing an immense coldness to emanate from the sword.</p>

  <p>The sword light was divided into three layers. While the outermost layer was the icy blue sword light, the innermost layer contained the Metal Law and chaotic energy, and thus was the metal and gray sword light.</p>

  <p>As he faced this strike, the fighting spirit in Tianming's eyes exploded like two balls of flames and had begun to burn.</p>

  <p>It was close to impossible for him to resist this blow.</p>

  <p>But just because he could not resist it didn't mean that he would give up.</p>

  <p>He stretched out his hand and grabbed the Soaring Snake Sword as his other hand swept towards the edge of the sword.</p>

  <p>Boiling hot blood burst into the air in a fountain, clotting almost instantly.</p>

  <p>The Heaven Earth Board was freezing, with the temperature as low as it could get.</p>

  <p>Tianming's eyebrows furrowed as a flame appeared in his hand. He grabbed the blood clot and melted it, using the blood as the paints.</p>

  <p>Thirteen blood runes appeared before him in the air with a hiss.</p>

  <p>All these blood runes were Tianming's blood essence.</p>

  <p>Activating these blood runes with his blood essence was also a method he had learnt from Chiyou's treasure.</p>

  <p>Soon after they were formed, the blood runes began to rise rapidly into the air, forming streams of blood mist that began to swirl around the Soaring Snake Sword.</p>

  <p>The moment he gripped his sword, a blood-red light, filled with Tianming's will, shot up into the sky.</p>

  <p>Tianming's face, which was originally pale, turned blood-red as his Mu Ning changed abruptly.</p>

  <p>At this, Tianming's mind filled with memories of what he had witnessed.</p>

  <p id="top_15">The first year of the breaking of the chaos.</p>

  <p>Ever since the chaos had been broken, it had only been a divine era.</p>

  <p>Chiyou said it was too crowded here.</p>

  <p>The Creating Axe had shattered years ago and to open up more space was simply too difficult.</p>

  <p>Then, Chiyou climbed to the top of the grand tower, fused the Soaring Snake into his sword, combined the sword with the token of wind and thunder, released the Heaven Opening Sword Book, and struck in the south.</p>

  <p>The strike spread thirty million miles.</p>

  <p>And with this, Chiyou had opened thirty million miles of the chaos.</p>

  <p>But he thought it was still not enough, which was why he had been launching strikes for several months.</p>

  <p>He had launched a hundred thousand slashes so far.</p>

  <p>Chiyou alone had opened nearly half the southern divine land. He had asked someone to plant the Hidden Wood to help stabilize the space.</p>

  <p>The sword in his hand was probably the Heaven Opening Sword.</p>

  <p>Even someone like Chiyou had been exhausted and fallen into a deep sleep after launching a hundred thousand slashes.</p>

  <p>This sword had the power to open the heaven, and so did the Soaring Snake.</p>

  <p>?</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Sword Illustration, however, was merely an essence of the Heaven Opening Sword Book.</p>

  <p>It was like a key, being passed around with the wind. And then, Tianming had picked it up.</p>

  <p>And from the moment he had picked up the key, his fate no longer remained ordinary.</p>

  <p>He consolidated it all, step by step, starting from the Eastern Region. He trained for a few years before finally obtaining Chiyou's treasure.</p>

  <p>It wasn't just a treasure, but was also an inheritance that he had to obtain.</p>

  <p>This fate was nailed into his future once he had comprehended the Heavenly Sword Illustration.</p>

  <p>Whatever it was, the Heaven Opening Sword Book was simply too complicated.</p>

  <p>The opening of the heaven was not limited to just the current round of heavens.</p>

  <p>Although the universe was vast, it was not infinite.</p>

  <p>In the face of the endless chaos, it could even be said to be insignificant.</p>

  <p>For Chiyou, the Beginning Swordsmanship was the most basic swordsmanship.</p>

  <p>Tianming had cultivated and broken through the preliminary level. He could perhaps even break through to the perfection stage.</p>

  <p>He had made fast progress.</p>

  <p>But until now, Tianming had only comprehended half a move from the Heaven Opening Sword Book.</p>

  <p>"This move is called the Flawless South Strike."</p>

  <p>On that day, Chiyou fell into a deep sleep and slept for the entirety of a divine era.</p>

  <p>The time of the gods was different from what Tianming had known before.</p>

  <p>He had only known that the time that a divine era spanned was unimaginable to him.</p>

  <p>Once he woke up, Chiyou saw the blue sky and a rainbow. The waterfalls were like white clothes floating into the sky. And he had had an epiphany for the one hundred thousand slashes, so he named this sword move 'Flawless South Strike', by which he meant to say that the new space he had opened in the south was flawless.</p>

  <p>Although it was only half a move, Tianming had no choice but to use it when faced with Luo Zheng's strike.</p>

  <p>He did not care that he would lose a lot of his blood essence. After all, the loss of blood essence in the Illusion Battlefield wasn't a big problem.</p>

  <p>If he missed this battle with Luo Luo Zheng, it would be hard to find another opportunity.</p>

  <p>The Soaring Snake Sword floated into the air as the color of the blood light suddenly changed, emitting a thousand different colors.</p>

  <p>A rainbow appeared suddenly out of nowhere. Under it was a beautiful world made of jade. It was marvelous, like a wonderland that everyone yearned for.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning knelt on the stone. She had originally wanted to praise the wonderful scene unfolding before her, but the Mu Ning that Luo Zheng's body was releasing made it difficult for her to say that.</p>

  <p>It was obvious that the warriors outside the painting wouldn't be suppressed by Luo Zheng's Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>"It's so beautiful!" a number of women said admiringly.</p>

  <p>The moment their gazes landed on the rainbow, they just couldn't take their eyes off of it. It was as if they were glued to the rainbow. The painting of the wonderland seemed to have a strange, devilish quality.</p>

  <p>No matter which realms they were at, no matter how weak or strong their souls were, nobody could take their eyes off the scene.</p>

  <p>They seemed to feel that they would regret it for the rest of their lives if they missed watching the scene for even three seconds.</p>

  <p>Tianming stood tall on the scene, his brows like swords, eyes like stars, lips like a red rose, and teeth like snow. Many people in the universe were strongly attracted to him right now, especially the thousands of females watching.</p>

  <p>He waved the sword.</p>

  <p>The Flawless South Strike.</p>

  <p>The essence of the Heaven Opening Sword.</p>

  <p>It was just half a move, but its perfection was beyond imagination.</p>

  <p>The streak of rainbow was suddenly swept out of Tianming's Soaring Snake Sword.</p>

  <p>An outline of a peerless wonderland formed wherever the rainbow passed by.</p>

  <p>But it was incomplete.</p>

  <p>If complete, a wonderland shining light would appear, and the scenes within would dance endlessly.</p>

  <p>Tianming had only managed to cultivate half of this skill, so all he could show was a still, peaceful scene.</p>

  <p>To him, it was inflexible. But to others, it was absolutely stunning.</p>

  <p>But this scene did not last long.</p>

  <p>Because the Flawless South Strike soon collided with the Chaotic Gods-intimidating Strike with an almighty clang.</p>

  <p>When the two sword strikes collided, the scene before them began to tremble violently.</p>

  <p>The two streaks of sword light did not have the time to enter a stalemate.</p>

  <p>It took only an instant for the stronger strike to become obvious.</p>

  <p>Tianming was unable to break Luo Zheng's strike.</p>

  <p>He could not break the Chaotic Gods-intimidating Strike, which had been sealed with the complete Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's sword attack had been executed with the help of the power of the Instant Godly Tile.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was still far from being able to compete with a True God, but he was definitely not someone Tianming could contend with.</p>

  <p>The icy-blue sword light slashed through Tianming's Flawless South Strike like a pair of scissors.</p>

  <p>Every scene was shattered and cries of alarm rang throughout the universe at this.</p>

  <p>This beauty had been short-lived, just like fireworks had only bloomed for an instant.</p>

  <p>Many martial artists closed their eyes. They didn't want to acknowledge that the scene was broken.</p>

  <p>The Chaotic Gods-intimidating Strike had struck through the wonderland.</p>

  <p>Tianming was still brandishing his sword, reeling from being unable to withstand the attack. But he still wanted to use the edge of his sword to tear at Luo Zheng's sword light.</p>

  <p>But when he swung his sword downwards, it did not even break through the icy blue layer on the sword light.</p>

  <p>And before he knew it, the sword light had pierced through his chest.</p>

  <p>There was no sign of regret on Tianming's face.</p>

  <p>He had already done his best and in the end, had lost to Luo Luo Zheng. But even though he had lost to Luo Luo Zheng, fighting Luo Luo Zheng would still be a joyful thing to him.</p>

  <p>One couldn't lose one's target and Luo Luo Zheng had been one of Tianming's most important targets.</p>

  <p>He believed that such an opportunity would present itself to him again.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had won this battle!</p>

  <p>This had depressed a lot of people in the universe.</p>

  <p>They hadn't believed in Luo Zheng's strength and had seemed to believe more in Tianming.</p>

  <p>All big and small bankers in the universe would make a fortune in this round.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the gamblers who had bet on Tianming were on the verge of tears.</p>
