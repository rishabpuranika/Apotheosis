<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The old man's figure shrank rapidly, and he stared at the Cave of Wildness with deep and searching eyes.</p>

  <p>He had thought that Luo Zheng's appearance was an opportunity, but it had turned out to be just a fleeting one. "Luo Zheng's life energy has disappeared,"</p>

  <p>Ramzi murmured disappointedly.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the exiles were completely unable to sense any life energy inside the Cave of Wildness. Luo Zheng's body was lying in the cave like a corpse.</p>

  <p>"What the hell is going on? Why are the cracks in the Cave of Wildness suddenly closed? The Chaos Ancient God hasn't made any movement for countless years. Why is this suddenly happening?" Leopold asked with a sigh.</p>

  <p>Although this huge skeleton had fallen here, no one actually believed that the Chaos Ancient God had really died.</p>

  <p>Such an existence had already surpassed the conventional definition of life.</p>

  <p>However, the Chaos Ancient God hadn't made a movement in countless years.</p>

  <p>It couldn't be a coincidence that something like this had happened just after Luo Zheng had entered the bone tower.</p>

  <p>As the old man repeated Leopold's questions to himself, he calmed down.</p>

  <p>What did the Chaos Ancient God want to do?</p>

  <p>It was not difficult for a powerful being like the Chaos Ancient God to kill Luo Zheng or even all the creatures in the bone tower.</p>

  <p>So why was he aiming at Luo Zheng?</p>

  <p>Looking up at the ceiling of the cave, the old man recalled the last recorded abnormal movement in the bone tower and suddenly thought of something.</p>

  <p>"All of you can leave now. The Cave of Wildness is closed for the time being," he announced flatly.</p>

  <p>The old man was the dominant elder of the Nine Li race, and as such, all the Nine Li people had to obey him unconditionally.</p>

  <p>Now that the cracks in the cave had been sealed, no one was allowed to cultivate here for the time being.</p>

  <p>Adele left with the Nine Li people. However, Ramzi, Leopold, and the other exiles remained behind.</p>

  <p>The old man stepped onto the sealed crack in the Cave of Wildness, squatted down, and took in a deep breath. "I smell blood."</p>

  <p>"Blood?" Ramzi echoed in confusion. He squatted down beside the old man and sniffed the sealed crack as well. "Is Luo Zheng submerged in blood?</p>

  <p>Where has the blood come from?"</p>

  <p>"It must be from the bone tower," Leopold said affirmatively.</p>

  <p>"Then...is it the blood of the Chaos Ancient God?" Ramzi's eyes suddenly brightened.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, there had been cracks all over the huge bone tower, but by the time these exiles had come into the tower, the blood marrow had already disappeared from the cracks.</p>

  <p>With his strength, the Chaos Ancient God could control every part of his body. It was only natural that he could, and would, hide his blood marrow. Why would he let an ordinary person get his blood?</p>

  <p>"It's very possible," the old man replied with a bitter smile. "At a crucial moment when Luo Zheng is going through the Body Tribulations, the Chaos Ancient God has let his blood marrow submerge Luo Zheng. Is he trying to integrate his blood marrow with Luo Zheng's?"</p>

  <p>Of course, they didn't know that the Chaos Ancient God had observed every living being in the world, including the old man himself. Every exile had been chosen by the brain masters of the Chaos Ancient God, but none of them was qualified.</p>

  <p>"Ten shares of blood wild bones plus the blood marrow of the Chaos Ancient God... The Chaos Ancient God is giving Luo Zheng additional trouble!" A helpless expression appeared on Ramzi's face.</p>

  <p>These exiles had all been hoping to possess the bloodline of the Chaos Ancient God.</p>

  <p>It was said that all of the ancient gods' bloodlines contained the energy of origination. So far, no one had been able to obtain the energy of origination.</p>

  <p>But no matter how precious the bloodline of the Chaos Ancient God was, it was not the right time to integrate his blood with Luo Zheng's. Luo Zheng was going through his Body Tribulations, and he could die because of this.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had the purest Chiyou's blood, but it was definitely not a bad thing to have the blood of the Chaos Ancient God as well.</p>

  <p>Even in the Source World, it was the dream of many powerful people to have the blood of a Chaos Ancient God.</p>

  <p>However, giving Luo Zheng the blood of the Chaos Ancient God when he was going through the Body Tribulations would be fatal.</p>

  <p>Even these exiles weren't confident that they could survive the integration of foreign blood with their own when they were going through the Body Tribulations, let alone Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The old man stood silently in front of the Cave of Wildness like a sculpture.</p>

  <p>The other exiles also waited quietly behind him. They did not dare to believe that a miracle would descend, but nevertheless, there was a glimmer of hope in their hearts.</p>

  <p>After all, Luo Zheng was the grandson of the Grand Chieftain. If anyone could survive this, it was him. They refused to believe that Luo Zheng would simply die this way.</p>

  <p>One day passed in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>The Cave of Wildness was still deathly quiet. The exiles had used their spiritual sense numerous times to scan Luo Zheng's life energy, but every time, they sensed nothing.</p>

  <p>After a few days, the exiles slowly started leaving one after another.</p>

  <p>Finally, Leopold left, followed by Ramzi.</p>

  <p>Only the old man remained where he was, silently guarding the cave.</p>

  <p>Once he was all alone, the old man sighed and said, "Our Nine Li race is not the most powerful race in the Source World. Ever since the day we were born, we have been badly bullied and beaten, but none of us has complained. We have grown up in a land full of savage miasma and in an abyss of resentment. We are born soldiers. Even if there is only one left, we will not give up... If what you told me is true, I will fulfill your last wish as well..."</p>

  <p>With these words, the old man turned around to leave.</p>

  <p>But just then, he heard a sound coming from the inside of the Cave of Wildness.</p>

  <p>It was barely audible, but the old man's senses were extremely sharp. At once, he sent his spiritual sense into the Cave of Wildness to check on Luo Zheng again.</p>

  <p>Inside the cave, Luo Zheng was still lying lifelessly on the ground.</p>

  <p>"Alas." The old man shook his head in disappointment. But just as he was about to withdraw his spiritual sense, an intense aura began emanating from Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>"He isn't dead!"</p>

  <p>The old man's eyes flashed with excitement.</p>

  <p>The breath of life was getting stronger and stronger. Even though the Cave of Wildness was sealed, the old man could detect the breath of life even without using his spiritual sense.</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish! Swish!</p>

  <p>The blood marrow in the cave came to a rapid boil and began to flow into Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>When the last drop of blood marrow was infused into Luo Zheng's body, all the wounds in his body healed in an instant, and his broken bones were instantly reshaped. Even his meridians were connected again.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>The originally sealed cracks in the Cave of Wildness opened slowly.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng turned into a beam of light and shot out of the Cave of Wildness, floating in the air.</p>

  <p>At this moment, he felt an unprecedented sense of relief. His corporeal body had been completely reborn!</p>

  <p>"My body... Nine Li Wild Body!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng felt that something was about to emerge from his body.</p>

  <p>And indeed, his bones, flesh, and blood all underwent a marvelous transformation.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, he became a giant ten thousand feet tall.</p>

  <p>At the same time, two other heads and four other arms emerged from his body.</p>

  <p>One of the heads had a vicious look on its face while the other one was smiling.</p>

  <p>"Wow! The imperial-grade bloodline is so unique! He has three heads and six arms," the old man exclaimed in surprise and looked at Luo Zheng's enormous form with joy.</p>
