<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The puppet wasn't a sentient creature. Obviously, Luo Zheng wasn't idiotic enough to think that he would be able to get rid of him just by cutting his neck.</p>

  <p>However, the maneuver did achieve one thing. Once he crushed the puppet's head with his foot, the headless corpse could no longer move. It stood still on the stone pillar.</p>

  <p>Then Luo Zheng calmly took away his long, dark, golden bow. It stood as high as a person, and there were several lines drawn on it in a bright shade of gold. The Mu Ning emanating from it was mysterious and powerful. Luo Zheng still didn't know what material the bowstring was made from. Although it was as thin as a human hair, it was still incomparably flexible and remarkably sharp. When Luo Zheng merely pinched it lightly, Brianna's finger got cut.</p>

  <p>"This is a semi-divine weapon, but pitifully, it's a bow." Luo Zheng had never used a bow as a weapon before, and had no experience with it. But such a long-range weapon could sometimes have miraculous effects.</p>

  <p>After observing the bow in his hand for a while, Luo Zheng reached out and his hands easily extricated the quiver from the back of the puppet.</p>

  <p>"Divine-level arrows!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng almost shouted out in his ecstatic excitement. Though the arrows didn't have any special abilities, the power that they shot out was extremely terrifying. Not only could they easily kill mighty warriors of the Soul Sea Realm, they could also penetrate through giant shields made of magnetic stones.</p>

  <p>According to what Brianna had said, if her body was hurt, she wouldn't be able to escape either. This meant that Luo Zheng had to be careful.</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately, there aren't enough arrows in here." Luo Zheng sized up the innards of the quiver. There were only about eight black colored arrows in it.</p>

  <p>Although these black arrows were divine weapons and therefore, extremely powerful, they were still for one-time use only, just like the Heavenly Thunder Halberds. Luo Zheng only had enough for eight shots.</p>

  <p>But something happened the moment his hand touched the quiver. His eyes flashed as he felt the Mu Ning of the Space Law transmit from it.</p>

  <p>"The Sumeru Space?"</p>

  <p>Normally, Sumeru Space recognized its own master only, but the Dragon Lineage Archer was just a puppet. This meant that removing his mark wasn't the least bit difficult. Luo Zheng easily erased the mark from the quiver and then probed it with his own consciousness. Soon after, a look of pleasant surprise appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>In the Sumeru Space of the quiver, were not eight, nor eighty, but hundreds of black arrows.</p>

  <p>There were not only black arrows, but also arrows in another two colors.</p>

  <p>One of them was entirely red, with a small ghost head embedded in the front, and the other was a shade of dark green, as if it was filled with a strong life force. Luo Zheng wondered what these arrows could do.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was still investigating inside the quiver when a few more arrows flew towards him, trailing some blue light behind them.</p>

  <p>However, their aim went south as Luo Zheng flashed agilely and returned to his original spot. The two arrows with the Dragon Arsenic that had been shot at him lost their aim and fell into the golden sea.</p>

  <p>Clearly this was not a place where treasures were to be examined. Once Luo Zheng had quickly stored the bow and quiver he had just found into his space ring, he flew up high into the air and once again stepped onto the Road of Saints.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p id="top_8">The Dragon Lineage Archer was already dead, but there were still countless dragon statues which were rising and falling, spitting out blue arrows nonstop in vain at their ever-moving target.</p>

  <p>Most of these arrows landed on the giant shields, and others went astray, but none of them hit Luo Zheng as he dashed forth towards his friends.</p>

  <p>"Open the shields!"</p>

  <p>War King Wind roared an order amongst the chaos. When the other masters saw that Luo Zheng had killed the humanoid puppet and returned safe and sound, an expression of great joy appeared on all of their faces.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng waved his hand and remarked in a soft voice, "You guys continue forward. I'll just fly."</p>

  <p>With the physical body of a Spirit Supreme Realm master, other than the black arrows of the Dragon Lineage Archer, these ordinary blue arrows would not pose any threat to Luo Zheng. Thus, he had no need to stay in the narrow and crowded box that the company had made up using their shields. Though the box was enormous, it had gotten crowded inside with so many people.</p>

  <p>Under the command of War King Wind, the box continued on the Road of Saints against the rain of arrows. This time, it was moving much faster than before.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng rose to a greater height, floating and flying in the air. Maintaining himself at this height would allow him to avoid the rain of arrows from the dragon statues. There was another advantage. He could see farther than his companions. The narrow Road of Saints extended into the distance, and at the end of the road was a huge cave.</p>

  <p>There was also a very strange sight to behold.</p>

  <p>When the seawater on both sides reached the end of the Road of Saints, it would stop flowing and retreat, as if an invisible force was cutting it all off. Not a single drop of the mighty water body entered the cave, so a sort of sea abyss was formed.</p>

  <p>"Is the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land located in the abyss?" As Luo Zheng saw this, he exclaimed in his heart. He couldn't figure out just how the Dragon Lineage Human had managed to stop the flow of seawater.</p>

  <p>Further still, he wasn't sure about the depth of this abyss. And even if he wanted to, he couldn't see the bottom of the abyss even from ten thousand feet above sea level with extremely powerful sight.</p>

  <p>However, he was in no hurry to learn everything at once. Leisurely floating around in the air, he waited patiently for the small box below him to slowly move ahead and reach the cave. At the same time, he observed carefully if there were any more Dragon Lineage Archers around. Luckily, that didn't seem to be the case. He must have killed the only one. Therefore, the company moved smoothly along the Road of Saints.</p>

  <p>When they reached the second half of the Road of Saints, the number of arrows started to fall down. Farther along the road, it fell exponentially with distance. As they reached the last one-fifth part, the Soul Sea Realm martial artists began to put away their giant shields.</p>

  <p>Without the threat of arrows, the group began to run wildly down the Road of Saints. It only took them a few seconds to arrive at the end of the road, and Luo Zheng descended down slowly as well when he saw them reach the end.</p>

  <p>At the end of the Road of Saints was a fan-shaped platform. Its size was a wonder to behold in itself and slap bang in the middle of it was a road that was inlaid with a right angle of 90 degree above the abyss.</p>

  <p>The seawater flowed all the way to the two sides of the platform and then started flowing downwards at a 90 degree angle. They were standing at the top of a cliff formed by the seawater.</p>

  <p>"How do we proceed further? Do we jump down from here or what?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>War King Wind replied with an amused smile, "Just follow me!"</p>

  <p>After he finished speaking, he started walking towards the edge of the platform. At the edge of the platform was a bottomless abyss and there was no way around it. Since War King Wind had occupied a corpse, he was unable to use his life vitality to fly. This meant that with his next step, he would definitely fall into the abyss. However, he confidently took that step.</p>

  <p>The moment he moved forwards, a strange sight greeted their eyes.</p>

  <p>Instead of falling down, War King Wind somehow stood horizontally on the vertical road. The entire gravity around him seemed to have shifted its base.</p>

  <p>From Zheng's angle, he seemed to have suction pads on his feet since he was easily standing horizontally below him, his feet adhering to the surface of the road.</p>

  <p>The other powerful warriors of the Soul Sea Realm also took a step forward. Everyone changed his or her angle and stood on the road perpendicular to the earth below them.</p>

  <p>Seeing this scene, Luo Zheng also took a step. When he walked towards the abyss, he suddenly felt a drastic change in the gravity around him. Like everyone else around him, he did not fall into the abyss, but instead stood on the vertical road.</p>

  <p>From Zheng's current angle, it was as if he was standing on the entrance to a giant, round cave. Along with the road underneath his feet, golden seawater was also flowing slowly above his head, entering the cave from his left and right.</p>

  <p>"The Dragon Lineage Humans were extremely smart. They managed to somehow change the gravity of the world and established their core sacred place here!" Luo Zheng couldn't help but sigh. No wonder the seawater was down here. Since the gravity and its direction were completely changed now, the direction in which the seawater would flow accordingly changed too.</p>

  <p>When Turner heard Zheng's sigh, he smiled and told him, "The Heavenly Stellar Secret Land has many miraculous things, but it also has numerous dangerous places, so we have to be careful. Especially after arriving at the Heavenly Stellar Sacred Place, we have to obey the orders. Do not act rashly."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded as he looked into the distance. The road under his feet once again extended outwards and they saw a huge city in front of them.</p>

  <p>Was this their first glimpse of the Heavenly Stellar Sacred Place?</p>

  <p>The eighth grade sacred place of the Dragon Lineage Human was called the Heavenly Stellar Sacred Place. After their fall, their sacred place had become a secret land for the four divine kingdoms to explore.</p>

  <p>There was no danger in front of them right now. Along with many other Soul Sea Realm martial artists, Luo Zheng and the others followed the road under their feet and proceeded towards the Heavenly Stellar Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>The road was only 50 to 60 miles long. After rushing forwards for less than five minutes, they arrived in front of the sacred place. At the end of the road was an arched gate made up of a dragon statue.</p>

  <p>After passing through this arched gate, they would enter the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land. However, the dragon carving on top of the gate had a bewitching red look in its eyes as it stared at the crowd. It seemed that it wouldn't be easy to pass through this gate.</p>
