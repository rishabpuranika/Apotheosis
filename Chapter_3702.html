<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The dots of light that Geoffrey had turned into shuttled through a seemingly chaotic mass of light dots he found himself surrounded by.</p>

  <p>From one point of view, it seemed as though it was not Geoffrey that moved, but the mountain formed by the light dots moved.</p>

  <p>But in the Abstruse Energy World, perception and depth were not as ordinary people understood them. In this world, it was actually Geoffrey who was moving.</p>

  <p>He soon left the mountain.</p>

  <p>As he continued moving through, the light dots circled him like water, forming a sort of river as he saw it.</p>

  <p>It flowed past his body and circles of light dots then appeared in front of him.</p>

  <p>They now seemed very orderly, as if carefully arranged.</p>

  <p>He observed this phenomenon for a while and frowned, the dots of light representing his eyebrows drawing closer together.</p>

  <p>These arranged light dots looked like some sort of three-dimensional plain.</p>

  <p>He could understand it, and yet he could not describe it because he had never seen or heard of anything like it and thus had nothing to compare it to. This place was not the chaos after all.</p>

  <p>This plain attracted something deep inside him. He couldn't help but walk towards it, like a moth to a flame.</p>

  <p>After only a few steps, he felt the rope he was tied to became taut.</p>

  <p>He shook his body slightly and the rope was untied.</p>

  <p>At the entrance to the cave, the rope began to shake and the runes on the surface began to flicker.</p>

  <p>Ziya saw the change in the runes and his expression shifted in turn.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had worried about sending Geoffrey into the Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>He saw the expression on Ziya's face and immediately asked, "What's wrong?"</p>

  <p>"The other end of the rope has loosened!" said Ziya in a slight panic.</p>

  <p>"How could this be?" asked Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"There are only two possibilities. The first is that Geoffrey was attacked by something on the other side," Ziya revealed seriously.</p>

  <p>"Something on the other side?" Luo Zheng asked as his heart sank.</p>

  <p>Nobody knew what was in the Abstruse Energy World...</p>

  <p>It was simply incomprehensible. If monsters of some sort did exist there, what they were and how they behaved and attacked were still left only to the imagination.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Ziya. "My disciples were attacked when travelling through the mountain. They never returned..."</p>

  <p>Ziya was unsure of their condition but he felt it safe to assume they had died.</p>

  <p>"What is the other possibility?" Luo Zheng asked hoping for good news.</p>

  <p>"Geoffrey untied the rope himself," replied Ziya. "But the possibility of that is very low. Those who enter the Abstruse Energy World have no sense of direction, nor can they distinguish their shapes. It would be impossible to untie the rope."</p>

  <p>Ziya's meaning was quite clear. It was highly probable that something had gone wrong for Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's face darkened. He had thought that the Abstruse Energy World was safe and that something like this could not happen.</p>

  <p>"It could just be an accident. I'll go and have a look!"</p>

  <p>After tying a rope to himself, Ziya jumped up and turned into many dots of light that then spread out.</p>

  <p>Among them, Ziya knew the Abstruse Energy World the best and was the only one who could save Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>The creatures in the Source World had little understanding of the Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>Even though Ziya had been immersed in this world and researched and figured out many of its rules, he was still easily lost.</p>

  <p>He barely entered the mountain and was already at his limit. He hoped Geoffrey just accidentally fell into the mountain, and he was confident he could then bring him back.</p>

  <p>As Ziya was searching hard, Geoffrey slowly entered the plain.</p>

  <p>At first Geoffrey needed to decipher the light dots he saw, just like deciphering Sanskrit words.</p>

  <p>The first thing he saw was the golden Sanskrit word, and the second was the hidden information within the Sanskrit word.</p>

  <p>But as he went deeper and deeper in the Abstruse Energy World, the light dots also began changing in his eyes. Each dot had its own meaning and in combination they revealed a great substance.</p>

  <p>He could see a piece of lush green grassland with undulating mountains and in the center were a whole bunch of light dots.</p>

  <p>As for the substance formed by the light dots, Geoffrey failed to understand it. It could have been that there was no corresponding substance in the chaos.</p>

  <p>There were also stairs formed by light dots. In the center of a whole lot of them, some light dots had gathered together to create a small ball.</p>

  <p>He was unable to tell what the 'ball' was, but in his subconscious he knew this was what had attracted him here.</p>

  <p>His heart skipped a beat. He walked up the stairs and reached out to grab the ball of light dots.</p>

  <p>Ziya had cultivated for countless chaotic eras to learn how to retrieve things from the Abstruse Energy World, and he could still only barely do it.</p>

  <p>But for Geoffrey, it was a piece of cake.</p>

  <p>He didn't need to adapt or practice, it was as if he was born here.</p>

  <p>He grabbed the ball and looked out into the distance.</p>

  <p>Farther away, there were still light dots scattered chaotically.</p>

  <p>They moved at such speed that even Geoffrey was unable to distinguish them.</p>

  <p>But as he continued staring into the distance, he saw an eye emerge from the light dots, staring right back at him.</p>

  <p>He was not the kind of person who was totally fearless. This eye sent a pang of angst through him.</p>

  <p>Without hesitation, he grabbed the ball and ran back in the direction he had come, countless light dots dancing and intersecting as he did.</p>

  <p>He soon found the rope at the edge of the grassland and moved quickly along it, crossing the river and the mountains.</p>

  <p>Ziya searched a long while, but could still not find Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>He had no choice but to return to the cave.</p>

  <p>"Have you found my son?" Luo Zheng asked with concern when Ziya returned.</p>

  <p>He would never be able to forgive himself if something bad happened to Geoffrey. Besides, he wouldn't know how to face Yudie.</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately..."</p>

  <p>Ziya sighed. He was about to speak when he caught a glimpse of the rope beside him. His eyes widened in disbelief as he said, "How is this possible?</p>

  <p>The rope seems to have recovered to the normal state again."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Luo Zheng asked anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Your son is still on the other end of the rope. That's impossible. Did he break free from the rope and tie himself back again?"</p>

  <p>Ziya was at a loss for words when many dots of light began gathering at the entrance of the cave.</p>

  <p>And the next moment, Geoffrey appeared in the cave.</p>

  <p>"Ah! It's so hot!"</p>

  <p>Geoffrey entered, still holding the ball in his hand. He felt a scorching pain and instinctively reacted and threw the ball on the ground.</p>
