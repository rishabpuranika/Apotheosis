<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Moreover, Luo Zheng never felt a strong hostility from the girl. Although she treated everyone like food, she spoke just like a child. Perhaps they could reason with her.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng also knew that it was impossible for these people to patiently communicate with these two girls.</p>

  <p>After all, everyone wanted to have the True Demon Body. They would end up competing with each other overtly or covertly. Conflicts also arose between that woman and the powerful clans, and between Samuel and Nicholas.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Hearing that crisp chirping sound, Luo Zheng automatically turned to see the countless ice flowers moving towards them like fast growing weeds.</p>

  <p>"Be careful!"</p>

  <p>Shouting loudly, Luo Zheng started to retreat.</p>

  <p>The joint attack just ended and those warriors were about to observe the situation of the girl with red eyes, and prepare for the second round.</p>

  <p>Hearing Luo Zheng's warning, they all turned to see what was going on, their expressions drastically changing.</p>

  <p>"That girl with the blue eyes is also taking action!"</p>

  <p>"Damn it! Retreat!"</p>

  <p>"Like the two light balls, the two girls are able to relay energy towards each other!"</p>

  <p>The light balls didn't know how to release the energy, and the energy would finally crush them.</p>

  <p>However, the girl knew that kind of thing.</p>

  <p>The woman's face turned gloomy as she looked at the ice flowers coming towards them, but she had no choice but to retreat.</p>

  <p>However, the woman and those duplicates of Holy Beings were near the right side of the girl with blue eyes. Three of the duplicates failed to dodge in time, directly getting pierced through by the ice flowers.</p>

  <p>Soon, the surface of the three duplicates of Holy Beings was covered by a layer of frost and they were frozen to death.</p>

  <p>As those people continued to retreat, the blue-eyed girl fluttered in the void like a ghost, chasing after the Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>"You can't escape!" the girl with red eyes warned, as she gently patted on the lotus flowers with her little hands, a smile appearing on her face.</p>

  <p>As both girls acted at the same time, the blue line attracted everyone's attention again.</p>

  <p>"The two girls rely on this thread to convey energy towards each other,"</p>

  <p>Murphy concluded, staring at the thread.</p>

  <p>"Find a way to cut this thread off," Zeke shouted.</p>

  <p>Right after Zeke's order, Jeremiah waved his fist towards the blue thread.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>The Mysterious Ice Divine Dao formed into a huge ice saber and slashed against the thread.</p>

  <p>However, this blue thread was like an ethereal space channel. The ice saber crossed it, but no damage was made.</p>

  <p>As they all knew, all the powers of Space Law had been suppressed in the Abyss Demon Region. Even the Holy Beings couldn't activate the Grand Teleportation technique, so they also couldn't break this thread.</p>

  <p>Actually, they all saw it coming. After all, when the girl with red eyes was attacked, all kinds of strong energy surrounded her completely, which should have already broken the thread if it could be destroyed.</p>

  <p>"The space here is not letting us tear it apart! We can't break their connection!"</p>

  <p>"Unless someone can cut through space to break it."</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings, Demi-holy Beings and the consummate True Gods constantly escaped in the void.</p>

  <p>With a gleam shining in his eyes, Samuel couldn't help pinching the ring on his thumb.</p>

  <p>He was sure that the Spear of Supreme Harmony could cut the blue thread.</p>

  <p>In other words, the Spear of Supreme Harmony was the key to get the True Demon Body!</p>

  <p>Those Holy Beings, such as Nicholas and Murphy, were too confident in their own strength.</p>

  <p>They initially thought that with their cultivation base as Holy Beings, they could defeat everything and conquer the entire Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>However, it never occurred to them that after they entered this void, they only reached a stalemate. Perhaps, it was Samuel's time to shine. At this stage, it seemed that only Samuel could get them out of this bad situation.</p>

  <p>Ahhh!</p>

  <p>The sound caught everyone's attention. Apparently, two consummate True Gods, who initially fled, slowed down and got trapped in the lotuses.</p>

  <p>Their scream lasted for less than three seconds. Afterwards, they had already been burnt into ashes.</p>

  <p>While Samuel was watching how the others were doing, a faint smile appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>Now was not the time for him to make a move.</p>

  <p>Even if he took action at this time, he couldn't win over both Nicholas and that woman.</p>

  <p>It would be better to act after almost everyone died.</p>

  <p>"Help me, Master." The call was too hard to dismiss.</p>

  <p>Looking around, Samuel saw a Demi-holy Being from the Leng Clan was trapped in the ice flower.</p>

  <p>It was actually meaningless to cry for help now, as he was already frozen in place at a blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>The two girls continued to fly around the space faster than the Holy Beings, initially causing exhaustion and later on death.</p>

  <p>Everyone's heart sank at the thought of it. Only Samuel felt relaxed. In his heart, he wanted those warriors to die quickly.</p>

  <p>During that moment, Samuel sensed someone's eyes were set on him. He looked around and realized it was Luo Zheng, who was standing a thousand feet away.</p>

  <p>Looking at Luo Zheng's reaction, he felt a little unhappy. Luo Zheng commented, "I remember that the Holy Being of the Han Clan used a faith weapon when he chased after me. He should have gained it from the Abyss Demon Region, right? He is even able to ignore the rules of the Abyss Demon Region and use the Grand Teleportation technique. I wonder if he could also break off the connection between these two girls."</p>

  <p>Hearing what Luo Zheng had said, Samuel scolded him angrily in his heart.</p>

  <p>If that woman hadn't been protecting Luo Zheng all the time, Samuel would have found an opportunity to kill him.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you're talking about. We all know that the Abyss Demon Region can restrict the use of Space Law, and I've never used the Grand Teleportation technique here," Samuel answered in his defense.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha. In the area of dark water earlier, this Holy Being was using a very powerful spear, and I saw it myself," said Sword Chen.</p>

  <p>The truth was that Luo Zheng's words might not be convincing.</p>

  <p>But now that there were two of them supporting that claim, the situation was naturally a little different.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, are you serious about what you say?" the woman couldn't help asking, surprised.</p>

  <p>Although this woman was in charge of the area of dark water, she had been busy dealing with the fiend race and the alliance of Floating Islands. Since she did not see the scene being discussed, she naturally knew nothing.</p>
