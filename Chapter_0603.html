<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 603 Like Father, Like Son (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Most of the disciples who had chosen the Death Road had survived and come out from the Cloud Road. The result wasn't as they expected because Luo Luo Zheng was the first one who got out, but both Lady Long from Iridescence Sect and the old man from Auspice Sect were still satisfied since their disciples made it out of the Death Road alive. It was generally a happy ending for everyone.</p>

  <p>While the rest were celebrating their own victories, the leader of Brumous Sect was quite displeased. He could not help but frown and then asked, "Hold on, Zade is still not here. Where is he? Why isn't he here?"</p>

  <p>Hearing Zade's name rang a sad bell in the ears of every disciple present at that moment. Everyone stared at the leader of Brumous Sect in silence.</p>

  <p>Their eyes were speaking, but they couldn't seem to find words to express what they knew. Frank looked around to see who would break the news about Zade. However, when he realized that no one was brave enough to say a thing, he finally spoke, "The Death Road has claimed his life.</p>

  <p>Zade was swallowed by the Dark Devil Phantom when he was picking a herb."</p>

  <p>When the disciples started to come out from the Cloud Road one after the other, the leader of Brumous Sect had the bad feeling that Zade didn't make it. As he watched the disciples come out, he was becoming more convinced that Zade didn't survive the Death Road. He knew already, but he wanted to hear it from the disciples, and Frank's words were the closure he needed.</p>

  <p>The world of cultivators was cruel. Even the toughest disciple in the world could meet his demise at any moment with one wrong judgment.</p>

  <p>Though Zade was courageous enough to try for the Death Road with Frank, his strength was not enough to survive given that he was only at the fourth place in Brumous Sect.</p>

  <p>It was a gamble for Zade to take the Death Road this year. He could win and if he did, he could at least be in the sixth place in the Cloud Road.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, luck wasn't on his side this time and being part of Frank's team didn't assure him of success. He failed at the expense of his own life.</p>

  <p>The leader of the Brumous Sect was disappointed, but he couldn't do anything at this moment. He didn't know that Zade's greed would cost him his life. If only he wasn't so greedy to pick the black herb, he would still be alive by now.</p>

  <p>After telling what he knew, Frank then turned his gaze at Luo Luo Zheng. He vowed that he wouldn't let him get away with it easily. Moreover, he was curious at what happened to Luo Luo Zheng at the Death Road. Everyone else also fixed their eyes at Luo Luo Zheng. They were still saying nothing, but their gazes were saying so much that got Elder Fernandez wondering. Frank noticed the change in Elder Fernandez's expression and took the liberty to explain, "Elder Fernandez, forgive me for speaking. But I would like to tell you the reason we're all staring at Luo Luo Zheng. From what we have witnessed in the Death Road, he is supposed to be dead. But it's a wonder that he's here with us now unharmed."</p>

  <p>"Dead? What do you mean? What happened to him in the Death Road?"</p>

  <p>Fernandez asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"The last challenge in the Death Road was to climb up the floating stones in a huge abyss. We were all there taking that last challenge and we saw him being dragged down by a Cloud Hall disciple. We couldn't be mistaken. It was him, and I believe everyone else saw it, too!" After he spoke those words, Frank looked at Luo Luo Zheng and slyly smiled. He knew that Luo Luo Zheng would not tell him the truth if he asked the latter himself. But Luo Luo Zheng wasn't stupid to defy Elder Fernandez. Frank was sure that Luo Luo Zheng would tell the elder the truth if the elder asked Luo Luo Zheng directly.</p>

  <p>"I see. Well, Luo Luo Zheng said that he fell into an abyss, but he missed that part where he was dragged down by someone," Fernandez said as if trying to comprehend what really happened.</p>

  <p>Earlier, Luo Luo Zheng didn't want to tell everyone about what happened, and Fernandez respected his decision. But now that they heard half of the truth about what happened, everyone else including Fernandez became curious. The ball was now in Luo Zheng's hands to say something about him being dragged down by a mysterious Cloud Hall disciple.</p>

  <p>The attention the topic was getting fired up Frank. He liked that Luo Luo Zheng was not in the hot seat and the fact that the latter could not lie in Fernandez's face. He slyly smiled again and continued, "Again, pardon me for saying.</p>

  <p>But it is also likely that Luo Luo Zheng hasn't told you about the flood dragon down the abyss."</p>

  <p>"A what?" Fernandez was surprised upon hearing this. He hadn't moved on from the fact that Luo Luo Zheng was dragged down by a mysterious Cloud Hall disciple, and now he was hearing another amazing event at the Death Road.</p>

  <p>Earlier, Fernandez and the leaders of each sect had learned from the Picture Slab that there was a huge dragon on the Cloud Road. They saw the rays of lights appeared in the sky and the Cloud Road seemed slightly different.</p>

  <p>They had never expected that the flood dragon was originally down in the abyss.</p>

  <p>"As soon as we entered the abyss, we were chased by that flood dragon.</p>

  <p>Apparently, the flood dragon wanted to devour us, and our instinct told us to run. Luo Luo Zheng, on the other hand, was dragged down to the mouth of the flood dragon by that Cloud Hall disciple. We didn't know why, and we assumed that they both died. But we were surprised to see that he had not only survived but also completed the trial ahead of us all. It was strange, but I am not in the position to ask Luo Luo Zheng myself," Frank said to Elder Fernandez. He was suggesting that Elder Fernandez had the right to ask Luo Luo Zheng about what happened. Frank grinned at Luo Luo Zheng and was waiting for his response.</p>

  <p>But to Frank's dismay, Luo Luo Zheng remained calm and indifferent as if he didn't hear a thing that Frank said.</p>

  <p>Unlike with Luo Luo Zheng, Frank's word aroused Fernandez's curiosity and that of the rest of the sect leaders.</p>

  <p>From what Frank had said, they concluded that Luo Luo Zheng had a connection with the flood dragon and the Cloud Hall disciple. If not, how could Luo Luo Zheng have survived that fall unharmed?</p>

  <p>Even Fernandez himself would avoid such a full-grown flood dragon at all cost. With his strength, Fernandez could survive that flood dragon, but not without a scratch. So, how did Luo Luo Zheng survive from the mouth of the dragon unharmed? Perhaps Luo Luo Zheng was indeed lucky. Even so, he could at least have some scratches, or wouldn't finish ahead of everyone. The only viable reason was that Luo Luo Zheng had some connection with the flood dragon.</p>

  <p>Kenneth became curious about it as well. He was eagerly waiting for Fernandez to ask the question so they could all finally hear the truth from Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Without waiting for Fernandez to speak, Luo Luo Zheng took the initiative to explain himself. First, he made a palm-and-fist salute, then said, "Elder Fernandez, please forgive me. It's not that I don't want to tell you the truth, but I made an oath with that disciple not to tell anyone anything."</p>

  <p>It was clear that Luo Luo Zheng wouldn't say anything. It seemed that he wasn't lying either about the oath. And with that, everything that Frank said to get the truth from Luo Luo Zheng was put in vain. Luo Luo Zheng knew what Frank was thinking and thought that it was naive for Frank to do such a thing.</p>
