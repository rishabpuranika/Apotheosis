  <p>
</p>

  <p>Over twenty platforms, all of different sizes, filled the Sunrest Wood Spring.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng reacted almost instantly. As soon as he had alighted, he landed on one of the largest of the platforms. Naturally, this attracted the attention of the others present.</p>

  <p>Only one of them spoke, however. It was Brendan Tang, a top-rank True God of the Tang Clan.</p>

  <p>He was intimidating to behold. Standing over 2.5 meters tall and with skin of deep bronze, he was in the top thirty among the top-rank True Gods in the Arena of Legends. His strength could not be overstated.</p>

  <p>The Tang Clan, including the branch of the clan Brendan Tang belonged to, was famous for their mastery of weapon refining.</p>

  <p>Thus, he valued the Sunrest Wood Spring even more than the other True Gods did.</p>

  <p>Brendan Tang was a little slow to react, however. As he saw these guys starting to occupy the platforms, he began feeling anxious.</p>

  <p>When his eyes swept the platforms, he realized that Luo Zheng was standing on the biggest one, and he was overwhelmed with outrage.</p>

  <p>"What a fool!"</p>

  <p>Seeing that Brendan Tang was about to give Luo Zheng a hard time, Duke swore quietly in his mind.</p>

  <p>Before the debate over the Divine Dao, those consummate True Gods of the alliance of wealthy clans, and the True Gods that accompanied them, had conspired together.</p>

  <p>And they had concluded that it was not the time to make a move yet.</p>

  <p>Even though the Dongfang Clan was the leader of the union of wealthy clans, Duke himself was just a top-rank True God.</p>

  <p>Donne Tang and Gage Tang from the Tang Clan were doing fine.</p>

  <p>An impulsive man like Brendan Tang, however, would probably not want to join Duke.</p>

  <p>"Your place?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng glanced at Brendan Tang with total indifference.</p>

  <p>Yan, who had been hovering just behind Luo Zheng, quietly leaned against his shoulder. A trace of ridicule appeared on her face as she sneered, "You asked Luo Zheng to get away? Do you want to flirt with death?"</p>

  <p>Brendan Tang's face darkened at her words. Although Yan had displayed her use of a special method, and had been successful at trapping all the Fanged Cicadas, he couldn't quite gauge her real strength. In fact, he might not have to be afraid of her and Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>But he was not confident enough to fight the two alone.</p>

  <p>He raised his head and shouted, "Gage Tang, Donne Tang! Are you here to watch a show?"</p>

  <p>Two other people not far away suddenly shot towards him.</p>

  <p>The middle-aged man with a flushed face was Gage Tang; the rather handsome young man was Donne Tang.</p>

  <p>"Who is the one flirting with death, then?" Having summoned the two members of the Tang Clan, Brendan Tang felt more confident. He smiled sardonically at Yan.</p>

  <p>Though Brendan Tang felt confident, he was visibly not completely at ease.</p>

  <p>Gage Tang and Donne Tang, on the other hand, looked much calmer.</p>

  <p>"Brendan, the Sunrest Wood Spring is indeed valuable. But it still isn't all that important!" Gage Tang said.</p>

  <p>"That's right. We have more important things to do." What Donne Tang said was not an understatement.</p>

  <p>Their most important goal was to prevent the others from obtaining the skeleton in the debate venue.</p>

  <p>Whether they themselves could manage to obtain the skeleton was not so important. What was crucial was that no one else managed to get their hands on it, especially not anyone from the Luo Clan.</p>

  <p>However, Brendan Tang was stubborn. He felt like Donne Tang and Gage Tang were trying to sabotage his glory. This made him resent them.</p>

  <p>"There is no bigger a coward than you in the whole Tang Clan," he swore angrily, deciding that he would fight Luo Zheng on his own. He thought that if he did it himself, Donne Tang and Gage Tang would not stand by watching the battle.</p>

  <p>Besides, once Luo Zheng and Yan entered the fight, the True Gods of the Dongfang Clan and the Fang Clan would most likely join in.</p>

  <p>After all, it was best to kill Luo Zheng and Yan first.</p>

  <p>Judging from his behavior, one would think Brendan Tang was a fool.</p>

  <p>However, that was far from the truth. He had taken all these aspects into consideration.</p>

  <p>He had made one mistake, however. He had underestimated Yan.</p>

  <p>Just as Brendan Tang finished his sentence, a smile appeared on Yan's face.</p>

  <p>The purple light in her eyes was like a snake's flickering tongue, like a dancing purple flame.</p>

  <p>This purple light was extremely dangerous.</p>

  <p>"If you are not a coward, then go ahead," Yan said. Her expression was indecipherable.</p>

  <p>"Oh?" Of course, the hot-headed Brendan Tang couldn't tolerate Yan's provocation. He prepared to make his move.</p>

  <p>Then a single word escaped Yan's mouth.</p>

  <p>"Break."</p>

  <p>Brendan Tang stretched out his enormous arm, and a shadow of a large hammer formed slowly in his hand.</p>

  <p>The hammer must have been his life's treasure.</p>

  <p>When the hammer shadow was only half formed, Brendan Tang suddenly felt a warm sensation coming from his neck.</p>

  <p>For a moment, he felt strange and light headed. Then, his entire body seemed to break in two at the point just below his neck. That feeling of warmth had been the feeling of blood gushing out from the breaking point.</p>

  <p>The bones of the top-rank True Gods were unusually dense.</p>

  <p>Even a fracture of a small finger bone would emit a deafening sound. They were comparable to the supreme primordial weapon without any rank.</p>

  <p>Consequently, it was verging on impossible to cut through the neck of a top-rank True God.</p>

  <p>It was testament to Yan's power that, with a single word, she had managed to sever Brendan Tang's head. Everyone, including Luo Zheng, was shocked.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had never thought that Yan would attack him like this without warning.</p>

  <p>With a weapon in hand, Luo Zheng was almost certain he could slice off Brendan Tang's head himself.</p>

  <p>However, the technique that Yan had used was completely incomprehensible to him.</p>

  <p>How did his neck break?</p>

  <p>"Brendan!"</p>

  <p>"Brendan!"</p>

  <p>Gage's and Donne's faces, previously calm, were now twisted in horror.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Brendan Tang had been beheaded, Gage Tang immediately ran downwards and grabbed his body.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Donne Tang held onto his head.</p>

  <p>Beheading was not immediately fatal to a True God, but if the head and the body were allowed to stay separated for too long, the physical body and the inner world would be affected.</p>

  <p>"No need to save him," Yan said gently, her expression cold. She pointed at Brendan Tang's head.</p>

  <p>"Kill," she uttered, her voice calm and quiet.</p>

  <p>As she spoke, Brendan Tang's face suddenly lost all vitality, his eyes still wide open and filled with fear.</p>

  <p>All the life energy vanished at once. He was dead.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"You!"</p>

  <p>Both Gage Tang and Donne Tang had fallen into a panic.</p>

  <p>Reinhard, who stood by with the crowd, looked on with incredulity, still reeling from witnessing Yan make her lethal move.</p>

  <p>With only two words, Yan had killed a top-rank True God. Not only was this girl too powerful, she had no reservations about using her powers, and did so ruthlessly.</p>

  <p>Duke, not far away, remained calm. The faces of other clans' True Gods darkened. They knew they could not complete their task with Yan present.</p>

  <p>She was too strong.</p>

  <p>Yan's face was calm.</p>

  <p>However, there was coldness in her eyes flashing purple light.</p>

  <p>She slowly sat down on the edge of the platform and looked at the True Gods present. "No matter what your goal is, if you provoke Luo Zheng, you will come to the same end as this guy," she said nonchalantly.</p>

  <p>Enoch stared at Yan, and his heart sank.</p>

  <p>The girl had looked gentle and adorable. He hadn't expected that she would be so ruthless and cold blooded when someone provoked her or Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Even Luo Zheng himself did not expect Yan's reaction to be so intense.</p>
