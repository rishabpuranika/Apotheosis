<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2038 The Rule Set By Maha </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As Zheng hightailed over to the place, he witnessed two martial artists battling it out. On the sidelines, human and Sacred warriors alike had their eyes glued to the fight, their gazes alight with interest. Zheng deduced that the two martial artists were engaged in a one-on-one battle.</p>

  <p>But his aim in rushing over to the Sunflower Water World was not to become another spectator to the battle, but rather he had to put an end to the challenge posed by Maha. As for the unwritten rule, he had no intention of abiding by it.</p>

  <p>Only the weak ones obeyed rules. The strong ones called the shots and created the law. They were brave enough to break them when need be.</p>

  <p>"Boy! Are you courting death?"</p>

  <p>"In the Sunflower Water World, you can only indulge in a one-on-one fight. Otherwise, our Sacred race would have long since exterminated your human race!"</p>

  <p>"If you are wise enough, you will run from here with your tail tucked between your legs!"</p>

  <p>As the Sacred martial artists noticed Zheng step closer, their voices rose to a clamor.</p>

  <p>"Who made this rule?" Zheng glanced around slowly as he rubbed his fingertips together.</p>

  <p>"It has been set by our Godly Genius, Maha, and rightly so!" one of the martial artists spat out arrogantly.</p>

  <p>Most of the human martial artists who entered the Sunflower Water World intended to confront and challenge Maha. However, there were simply too many of these human adversaries. It was impossible for Maha to fight them individually by himself. Thus, the Sacred martial artists lent a hand in fighting them.</p>

  <p>The corner of Zheng's mouth curled up slightly. "So that's how it is. I see."</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's how it is. Now make yourself scarce!" a Sacred martial artist shouted.</p>

  <p>Zheng shook his head. "But that is Maha's rule, not mine."</p>

  <p>The martial artist spluttered at this unexpected reply. "And pray tell, what is your rule?" he asked incredulously.</p>

  <p>The Sacred martial artists present were clueless as to how they should react to this dissenter. Their race had the absolute advantage in the Sunflower Water World, and the human martial artists who challenged the Sacred warriors were mindful of it, which was why they were usually compliant with the rules.</p>

  <p>"My rule is not to follow any rule while fighting the Sacred race!" As he finished speaking, Zheng's eyes narrowed in timely warning. Swiftly, his figure flew in the air like a nimble swallow and shot toward that Sacred warrior.</p>

  <p>The Sacred warrior had not imagined that Zheng would dare make a move such as this. His vision blurred and turned hazy as Zheng flashed past him.</p>

  <p>Zheng had stunned the Sacred warrior. Before the latter could even react, an Ice Soul Flame bloomed on his chest and rapidly trickled into his body. A cold chill pervaded his insides inch by slow inch, spreading through his meridians until it finally invaded his deep inner world.</p>

  <p>The inner world of the Sacred martial artist was engulfed in ice and snow. As the temperature plummeted even more, a number of creatures within froze into chunks of ice. Along with the living beings formed out of life vitality, the martial artist's own life vitality sea iced over. Caught unawares in this situation, he was unable to activate his life vitality or use a cultivation method to resist the insidious chill.</p>

  <p>Within moments, the Ice Soul Flame blazed with incredible intensity, devouring his entire body. Before the others knew it, the Sacred martial artist's body had turned into a solid ice sculpture. The shocked expression on his face, now frozen forever, was jarring to witness.</p>

  <p>"How dare you!"</p>

  <p>"You dared launch a sneak attack?!"</p>

  <p>"Brothers! Let's kill this human warrior!"</p>

  <p>Zheng had caught the Sacred martial artists completely off-guard. They would have never expected a human warrior to have the audacity to launch an attack on one of them out of the blue.</p>

  <p>After all, the Sacred race dominated the Sunflower Water World. They had never come across such a foolhardy human, who was willing to butt horns with a mightier adversary. Evidently, the Ice Soul Flame in Zheng's hand was extraordinary, but they still pounced on Zheng in anger for they had a clear advantage in terms of numbers.</p>

  <p>The human martial artists, on the other hand, watched wide-eyed as Zheng stunned his opponent. Thoroughly impressed, they wondered where Zheng had come from. Not only was he strong, he was also proving to be more talented and arrogant than the Sacred warriors themselves.</p>

  <p>Just as these human warriors were hesitating on whether they should help Zheng out or not, the latter bolted to the Sacred warriors to stun them.</p>

  <p>His body was like a ghost and the Ice Soul Flame in his palm was alluring like a bewitching flower. Each time he passed by a Sacred warrior, his other hand brushed the Ice Soul Flame lightly.</p>

  <p>The azure ice flame transferred onto the bodies of the opponent warriors where it spread dangerously, simultaneously unleashing the unstoppable chill.</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...</p>

  <p>The Sacred martial artists tried to fight back, but they could not even reach him. Each of them turned into ice sculptures, raging ice flames wildly burning around them. The scene was daunting. Zheng sauntered out from between these ice sculptures, a faint smirk hanging on his lips.</p>

  <p>He could kill the Sacred world lords so easily, which bewildered the human martial artists. As they saw Zheng walk out, they could not help but stumble a few steps back, their faces revealing the reverence they felt deep down.</p>

  <p>"How far is Iron Moon City from here?" Zheng asked without ceremony.</p>

  <p>"About two million miles..." a human martial artist replied. This warrior too had the cultivation base of world lord, but before Zheng he felt that he was far inferior, as if he was facing a Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>"Thank you." Zheng nodded. The sole of his foot tapped against the ground before his body circled up like a bird, using the Grand Teleportation technique to journey forward.</p>

  <p>After Zheng left, the human martial artists breathed a collective sigh of relief...</p>

  <p>"He is truly a world lord!"</p>

  <p>"Even an ordinary grand world lord would be unable to do such a thing.</p>

  <p>Could it be that he is a Godly Genius?"</p>

  <p>"Humph. Are you all blind? He was Zheng!" A human warrior had immediately identified Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng had once challenged the talents of the universe in a painting of the Illusion Battlefield, for which reason many in the universe were well aware of his appearance.</p>

  <p>The journey to the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land had done wonders for Zheng's cultivation base and had made it soar. His aura had undergone a drastic change. Surprisingly, some of the human warriors had not recognized him despite his popularity. Now that Zheng's identity was pointed out, these warriors got excited.</p>

  <p>"I cannot believe he was Zheng!"</p>

  <p>"He has cultivated to such a high level! His method with the ice attribute was particularly terrifying."</p>

  <p>"I believe he is currently making his way to the Iron Moon City to challenge Maha. It will be a good show! Let's head to the city!"</p>

  <p>Thrilled at the prospect of witnessing the battle, the human warriors also flew toward Iron Moon City, following Zheng.</p>

  <p>An ordinary mortal would never be equipped to cross a distance of two million miles in their lifetime. But for world lords, the stretch was quite short.</p>

  <p>After travelling for about five minutes, a range of bumpy hills appeared before Zheng.</p>

  <p>As his calm eyes scanned the scenery slowly, he saw that at the end of the hills lay a city in the shape of a crescent moon, built around the hills rather picturesquely.</p>

  <p>Whoosh...</p>

  <p>Zheng put his foot forward and entered Iron Moon City in a flash of blazing white light.</p>

  <p>No city lord resided in Iron Moon City anymore. The no-fly ban and divine textures that were originally installed here had long since been abandoned. In fact, even if these prohibitions were once again activated, they would not be able to stop the fierce and ambitious world lords.</p>

  <p>Currently, Iron Moon City was filled to capacity with world lords from both the human race and the Sacred race. A section of the warriors had come merely to watch the battles among the world lords, but most of them were there to participate in the fights themselves. They reveled in provoking and challenging each other.</p>

  <p>After Maha had killed Nathan, the Sacred martial artists become rather vainglorious. They took pleasure in goading the martial artists of other races in Iron Moon City. As for the martial artists of the human race, the Demon Night race, and the ogre race, they were only indignant and eager to take action at any moment.</p>

  <p>As soon as Zheng stepped into the place, he attracted the attention of several Sacred martial artists.</p>

  <p>"It is a new human world lord. Ha-ha!" someone roared, booming in raucous laughter.</p>

  <p>"Humphrey, go challenge him!"</p>

  <p>"Let me try..."</p>

  <p>The Sacred martial artists had similar condescending smiles on their faces as they stared at Zheng. One of them strode toward him. "Hello, human brat! Have you come to Iron Moon City for..."</p>

  <p>Before the Sacred martial artist could even finish his question, Zheng passed by him indifferently. The moment he did so, a blue ice flower fell on the warrior's shoulder.</p>

  <p>Zheng looked rather placid...</p>

  <p>The Ice Soul Flame burned with intensity.</p>

  <p>Before any of the Sacred martial artists could realize what was happening, Zheng had already increased his speed. The Ice Soul Flame was like the sickle of death and Zheng the grim reaper. He wasted no time in taking the lives of these Sacred martial artists.</p>

  <p>Puff, puff, puff...</p>

  <p>One after another, the Ice Soul Flames began to bloom. They stirred in the air, releasing distinct sounds. In the bat of an eye, the group of seven Sacred warriors turned into motionless ice sculptures.</p>

  <p>Zheng did not slow down in the slightest as the warriors fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>He continued to go deeper into Iron Moon City.</p>

  <p>Because of his action, Zheng attracted the attention of the martial artists in Iron Moon City. Another group of Sacred world lords stormed out, and as they took in what had happened, they were utterly furious. Countless challenges had occurred outside of Iron Moon City, but this human martial artist before them had broken the cardinal rule!</p>

  <p>They could not possibly tolerate such impudence from a human world lord!</p>
