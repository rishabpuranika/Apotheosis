<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng just kept quiet as he waited for the Evil God to finish his shrilling laughter.</p>

  <p>"I'm really happy that you're still alive," the Evil God said as he looked at Zheng's huge primitive land in the distance. "You have such a huge primitive land, huh? Is that the world where I used to live?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Zheng replied with a nod.</p>

  <p>"Are my children still there?" the Evil God asked casually.</p>

  <p>"Yes. They're still top masters of that continent," Zheng answered.</p>

  <p>When the Evil God heard this, a strange smile suddenly appeared on his face. "So, are you planning to use them to threaten me?"</p>

  <p>Zheng frowned and scoffed slightly, "You know what kind of person I am.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, I know your nature. I wouldn't waste my time doing such meaningless things. Just tell me what you want to do."</p>

  <p>Of course, Zheng wouldn't even think of doing such a detestable thing. He also knew that with the twisted personality of the Evil God, even if he used the important people in the life of the Evil God to threaten him, it wouldn't affect him at all.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! So straightforward." The Evil God laughed awkwardly and pointed downwards. "Down there. That's where our common enemy is!"</p>

  <p>He was actually pointing towards the vast chaos.</p>

  <p>Without the chaos clouds covering the area, it was just an empty space.</p>

  <p>Occasionally, there would be some heads wandering around that must have escaped from being devoured.</p>

  <p>"Common enemy? Who are you talking about?" Zheng was quite confused with the Evil God's statement.</p>

  <p>"Who? The Snake Spirit King and the downgrader behind him of course," the Evil God replied with a grin. "They have created an immense primitive land that looks like a huge pyramid. Currently, it is already bigger than mine, and of course, much bigger than yours!"</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, the process of the primitive lands in devouring the heads could be likened to rolling a snowball.</p>

  <p>Originally, the Source World should have the most advantage, because it had the largest size. Thus, its efficiency in devouring the heads was far greater than the other two competitors.</p>

  <p>However, the Evil God was so late in understanding the meaning of the downgrade and also didn't know how to deal with the overwhelming heads that suddenly appeared in the Source World. In fact, before he came up with a solution, a lot of parts of the Source World were already devoured by them.</p>

  <p>When the Evil God had finished dealing with the trouble in the Source World, Zheng's primitive land and the pyramid-like primitive land had already caught up in terms of size. Thus, even though the Source World was originally the largest, it was now left behind.</p>

  <p>"The huge pyramid?" Zheng stared at the void with a worried expression in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Now, if you want to deal with it, I suggest that we better join hands. It'll be easier that way," the Evil God recommended.</p>

  <p>Previously, when Zheng led the Monkey Spirit Sect to the Jade Pure Realm, he deemed it necessary to form a temporary alliance with the Bird Spirit Sect. In this current situation, it seemed reasonable for him to join hands with the Evil God who controlled the Source World, but he was quite hesitant.</p>

  <p>He thought that the Evil God was much harder to deal with than the Bird Masters. So, he couldn't help but smirk and ask, "Join hands? How are we going to do that?"</p>

  <p>"We join our forces. We will integrate your primitive land with my Source World," the Evil God said indifferently.</p>

  <p>Zheng was again quite baffled with what the Evil God said. "Can primitive lands merge together?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, it's simple. We'll just let my Source World devour your primitive land," the Evil God said it like it was common knowledge.</p>

  <p>"Why do you think I should agree to that?"</p>

  <p>Zheng's expression started to become serious. At the back of his mind, he kind of knew that it was how it was done, but a trace of anger still surfaced from his heart.</p>

  <p>As the Evil God noticed Zheng's faint anger, a condescending smile appeared on his face. "Isn't it obvious? It's because I'm stronger than you."</p>

  <p>"Oh? What makes you think so?" Zheng's eyebrow slightly raised as his expression became colder.</p>

  <p>"Well, we can test it out if you want," the Evil God continued to provoke Zheng with a sinister smile.</p>

  <p>Without waiting for Zheng's response, he suddenly bent a finger and a colorful light flashed from his fingertip.</p>

  <p>It turned out to be the Ways-blending Energy.</p>

  <p>As the Evil God gently flicked his finger, the ray of light swiftly shot towards Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>Facing the sudden attack, Zheng wasn't fazed at all.</p>

  <p>Just before the ray of light hit him, his body became blurry and completely disappeared.</p>

  <p>The colorful light that missed its target hit the flying ship from afar and instantly turned into a dazzling white energy ball. The entire ship was annihilated, and not a piece of debris could be found.</p>

  <p>The Evil God didn't even need to use his eyes when he fought. With a wave of his hands, a long whip formed from the Ways-blending Energy spread out from his fingers and lashed violently at the void.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Zheng's figure kept moving in the space. After dodging several attacks from the whip, he seized the right chance and grabbed it with his bare hand.</p>

  <p>"Explode!" the Evil God shouted.</p>

  <p>The long whip instantly turned into a blazing white ball of light and enveloped Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, before the ball of light continued to expand, it suddenly shrank at an incredible rate and fully dissipated.</p>

  <p>As Zheng's image emerged, he said, "Although the Ways-blending Energy is strong, it is still the power of a third-grade world. This is your innate limitation."</p>

  <p>"Ha, are you sure about that?"</p>

  <p>The Evil God showed a defiant grin and quickly dashed towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>He raised his hand and suddenly brandished a long whip again. However, this time, the whip was not formed through the Ways-blending Energy, but by three energies that emanated green, black, and red lights.</p>

  <p>Zheng calmly grasped the end of the whip again and analyzed the energies that were flowing in it.</p>

  <p>But as soon as he realized the source of the energies, the corners of his eyes twitched slightly.</p>

  <p>'These energies?</p>

  <p>They are bloodline powers.</p>

  <p>They are from the fourth-grade world.</p>

  <p>And there are actually nineteen kinds of them?'</p>

  <p>Dealing with nineteen kinds of bloodline powers was still actually a piece of cake for Zheng, but he was still surprised that the Evil God could actually handle and master them. After Zheng analyzed it, a faint yellow energy surfaced from his fingers. The yellow energy wrapped around the tricolored whip, like a spider web, and rapidly disintegrated it.</p>

  <p>The Evil God didn't just stand idly. He then waved his hand, releasing a surge of brown ripples from his palm. As the brown ripples came in contact with the yellow energy, they instantly devoured the energy until not a single trace was left.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing the capability of the brown ripples, Zheng was actually shocked.</p>

  <p>It was not that big of a deal to use several kinds of bloodline powers simultaneously. However, the difficult thing to do was to quickly analyze the bloodline powers contained in a weapon or skill and then find out the corresponding energy that could restrain them. Originally, Zheng thought that he was the only one who could do that. If the Evil God could also do the same, he started to think if the Evil God had also mastered all the bloodline powers.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>As the brown ripples were hurled directly towards Zheng, he pointed his finger at them, unleashing thin bolts of lightning that instantly disintegrated the brown ripples. These bolts of lightning also charged towards the Evil God at an astonishing speed.</p>

  <p>The two of them released all kinds of blood powers to restrain each other.</p>

  <p>They exchanged blows and skillfully countered everything that was thrown against both sides.</p>

  <p>After several rounds, the Evil God got a little bored because no one was getting the upper hand. "You're right. The innate limitation is the most horrible thing. So, I've been studying how to break out of it. Yes, three hundred and seventy-three bloodline powers are undoubtedly strong, but it's still not enough?"</p>

  <p>Upon saying that, he drew a circle in the air using his other hand, and a white hexagonal snowflake emerged from the circle.</p>

  <p>After its formation, the Evil God knocked on the hexagonal snowflake.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Just with that gentle knock, the snowflake shattered.</p>

  <p>Soon after, every part of it dissipated in the air.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Zheng couldn't shake the feeling that something dangerous was about to happen.</p>

  <p>The next moment, the figure of the Evil God also disappeared, but his voice could still be heard.</p>

  <p>"If I want to, I can kill you a thousand times or even ten thousand times.</p>

  <p>I can put you in an illusion that time is frozen.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, you won't comprehend the beauty of this state. You'll only feel bemused.</p>

  <p>How pitiful you are."</p>

  <p>Zheng felt a little weird as he heard that the sentences of the Evil God were overlapping. It was as if he was speaking them at the same time.</p>

  <p>When he finished speaking, the Evil God suddenly appeared in front of Zheng, and also behind him, and even at both his sides.</p>

  <p>Then, the Evil God stopped about one foot away from him, and said,</p>

  <p>"This is the Stasis Extreme Form."</p>
