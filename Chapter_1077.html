  <p>
</p>

  <p>Randy was talking to Luo Zheng in a really polite way.</p>

  <p>As a superior Lord who hailed from a royal family, he had never lowered himself to cooperate with others before. Luo Zheng was the only exception.</p>

  <p>Although the crown prince had won over divine-level talents like Gregory and Edwin, along with the other talents from the two major martial houses, they weren't that friendly to one another. They could only be regarded as the crown prince's followers.</p>

  <p>Any powerful prince only wanted to train their own followers. But for Randy, he wanted to work with Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng heard Randy's words, his eyes were filled up with surprise.</p>

  <p>He lightly sipped his tea and looked at the scenery outside the palace. It was quite a sight, so he couldn't help but allow his thoughts to wander.</p>

  <p>The moment he came to the four divine kingdoms, he didn't plan to depend on any of the forces. However, if someone chose to cooperate with him, he wasn't to refuse. After all, both sides could benefit from it.</p>

  <p>Despite Randy's indisputable arrogance and conceitedness, he was still an honest man in Zheng's eyes. Besides, he was a prince of the Harlen Divine Kingdom. Luo Zheng refused to be anyone's follower, but it was undoubtedly very suitable to act jointly with Randy.</p>

  <p>The only hindrance was the dispute between Randy and the crown prince, but that wasn't Zheng's concern at that point in time. He wasn't going to stay in the four divine kingdoms for long anyway.</p>

  <p>Upon noticing Zheng's hesitance, Randy spoke, "It looks like you still fear my brother. Am I right?"</p>

  <p>Initially, Zheng's response was to roll his eyes at Randy's straightforwardness. He smiled and said, "I choose to work side by side with you. I'm here for the life stones in the Feather Emperor Secret Land."</p>

  <p>It was no secret that Luo Zheng was looking for the life stones, so there was no harm in telling Randy.</p>

  <p>"Oh? The life stones?"</p>

  <p>There was a meaningful smile plastered on Randy's face. "Why didn't you just say so earlier?"</p>

  <p>Zheng's heart skipped a few beats as he heard Randy's words. He had traveled for miles on end just to find those things. If he could get them from Randy, then it could save him a great deal.</p>

  <p>In one clap of his hands, a servant girl made her way to Randy in small strides.</p>

  <p>"Bring me the life stones,"</p>

  <p>Randy said softly, his voice almost sounded like a whisper.</p>

  <p>After the servant girl received Randy's order, she bowed her head slowly and then exited the room carefully.</p>

  <p>There was burning excitement that was brewing inside of Zheng's heart. It was too extreme that he couldn't conceal it himself. If Randy possessed the life stones, he was willing to pay any price in exchange for them.</p>

  <p>The expression on Zheng's face brought a smile on Randy's face. "It seems that the life stones are of utmost importance to you. You want to save someone, right?"</p>

  <p>Life stones could replenish a human's life force. However, life force wasn't the same as lifespan. It was completely different from the pills that could increase one's lifespan.</p>

  <p>Since he was quite young and only in his twenties, Randy had concluded that it wasn't him who needed such.</p>

  <p>"You're right," Luo Zheng nodded as he replied.</p>

  <p>After the two of them waited for a while, the servant girl returned with a wooden tray which was covered with a layer of silk.</p>

  <p>Randy slowly stood up and reached out to grab the hem of the silk. He lightly pulled on it, revealing the stones placed delicately on the wooden tray.</p>

  <p>The stones were the same ancient jade pieces that Luo Zheng had seen before.</p>

  <p>A pure Mu Ning of life channeled through the stones. Anyone who went near them could feel the energy of life that they effused.</p>

  <p>Back then, Luo Zheng was worried. He knew very well that Francis, whom he enslaved, didn't dare to deceive him. But what if what Francis said was wrong? What if the life stones were not produced in the four divine kingdoms?</p>

  <p>Now, he was a hundred percent sure.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the number of life stones on the wooden tray was still not enough.</p>

  <p>There were only twelve of them in total.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng also remembered that there was only a small amount of life force in one life stone.</p>

  <p>The Life and Death Wind that hit Ning Yudie took her life force out of her.</p>

  <p>Twelve of them were far from enough.</p>

  <p>Seeing a streak of regret in Zheng's eyes, Randy instantly knew what was on his mind. He chuckled and said, "We seldom keep life stones at home.</p>

  <p>These are all I have. They're not enough, I reckon?"</p>

  <p>"I don't mind." Luo Zheng shook his head and continued, "It's just that I need a lot more than these. Lord Randy, are you willing to sell them to me for a price?"</p>

  <p>With him were a bunch of supreme life vitality crystals. He was confident that he could afford to pay for the precious life stones.</p>

  <p>"There won't be any negotiation. As long as you agree to work with me all the way, consider these life stones as my gift to you." Randy was as straightforward as always.</p>

  <p>There was no way Luo Zheng could refuse such an offer. He could see Randy's nature. If he really wanted to pay for the life stones instead, then it could cause a bicker between him and Randy. Even though the life stones were small in number, each one of them was essential.</p>

  <p>With one sweep of the hand, Luo Zheng collected the life stones from the tray into his space ring.</p>

  <p>Randy then said, "Since you need more life stones, you must enter the Feather Emperor Secret Land to mine ores. With your strength, you shall get in easily, but the mining process can exhaust you to the greatest extent."</p>

  <p>"Mining? Were life stones dug out from the secret land?" Luo Zheng obviously didn't know much about the Feather Emperor Secret Land. Neither did Francis.</p>

  <p>Even though Francis himself was a Life and Death Realm master and had a high cultivation level, he didn't meet the qualifications to enter the Feather Holy Sea when he reached the Virtual Tribulation Realm.</p>

  <p>There was an obvious grin on Randy's face. "The four divine kingdoms keep the information regarding the Feather Holy Sea a secret. Like you, most people don't know much about the four secret lands. The Feather Emperor, Divine Emperor, Mysterious Dream, and the Heavenly Stellar Secret Lands are all different from each other. The Feather Emperor Secret Land is actually a vein."</p>

  <p>"A vein? You mean a vein that produces life stones?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng asked, his curiosity at its peak.</p>

  <p>However, Randy shook his head. "The vein within the Feather Emperor Secret Land is very rare and the treasures it produces are also very strange. It was once unearthed by the Dragon Lineage Human for tens of thousands of years. Even the four divine kingdoms had their fair share of digging for a long time, but the mineral deposits are still very rich!</p>

  <p>Besides the life stones, it can also produce other beneficial items!"</p>

  <p>With such a vein, the four divine kingdoms never wasted any time and went on with mining.</p>

  <p>"I see." Luo Zheng nodded. "I wonder what the other two secret lands have."</p>

  <p>"The Divine Emperor Secret Land actually serves as a cemetery. Buried there are the corpses of many dead members of the Dragon Lineage Human. Those bodies have been preserved using a secret technique, so they will not rot for ten thousand years."</p>

  <p>"Cemetery?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng frowned. "Then why is it referred to as a secret land? What treasures are hidden beneath it?"</p>

  <p>"There's nothing," Randy replied. "Nothing but corpses. It really is just a cemetery. What kind of stuff could you acquire from that sort of place?"</p>

  <p>"But..." As that was revealed to Luo Zheng, he wanted to know if exploring the place could reward him in some way.</p>

  <p>Before Luo Zheng could even finish his words, Randy began to laugh. "But the corpses inside are the most precious treasures!"</p>

  <p>Corpses were treasures?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was confused all the more.</p>

  <p>The Feather Holy Sea was the gathering place of the Dragon Lineage Human. Many of them were killed in the blood sacrifice, so it had become a dangerous place for anyone.</p>

  <p>There was a long period of time when the four divine kingdoms were unable to enter the Feather Holy Sea.</p>

  <p>At some point, the Feather Holy Sea was considered more oppressive and powerful than the Cursed Land in the entire Sea God Continent. At the very least, living beings under the level of war sages could enter the Cursed Land, but it wasn't the same for the Feather Holy Sea.</p>

  <p>However, no matter how dangerous the place was, there was still a way to break it. The legacy left behind by the Dragon Lineage Human was like fat meat in the eyes of the four divine kingdoms. How could they sleep soundly when they knew there was fat meat at their doorsteps?</p>

  <p>After searching again and again, they finally found a way to enter the Feather Emperor, the Divine Emperor, and the Mysterious Dream Secret Lands.</p>

  <p>The four divine kingdoms had gained so much from those secret lands.</p>

  <p>Finally, their eyes fell onto the last one � the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Stellar Secret Land was the core of the Dragon Lineage Human, which was more impossible to enter compared to the first three secret lands. It had puzzled the four divine kingdoms for countless years.</p>

  <p>In order to explore it, countless martial artists in the four divine kingdoms had given their lives. Among them were many Soul Sea Realm masters.</p>

  <p>Finally, the four divine kingdoms compromised. They found themselves unable to enter all. The power of blood sacrifice within the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land was not something that they could just brush off their shoulders.</p>

  <p>Thus, they shifted their focus onto the corpses in the Divine Emperor Secret Land.</p>
