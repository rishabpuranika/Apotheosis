<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Look, the match is on. The candidate chosen by Vulture Peak is Tan Tian. He has defeated three of the outer disciples from Drizzle Peak already. I hope Wurth can beat him!"</p>

  <p>"Alas, it's hard to say. Yes, Wurth is strong. But even if he defeats Tan, what's the use? Tan has already proven to be too strong for our disciples.</p>

  <p>But he only ranks 16th at Vulture Peak. Even if Wurth defeats Tan, Vulture Peak will send a higher ranking person next. Then how will we deal with it?"</p>

  <p>The outer disciples of Drizzle Peak were talking about the challenge.</p>

  <p>Obviously, they thought that the prospects of Drizzle Peak were not good.</p>

  <p>At this time, Zheng saw a man jumping into the battle ring. He was six feet tall and as thin as a rail. He must be Tan Tian.</p>

  <p>As soon as Tan jumped into the battle ring, he looked around. Arrogance shimmered in his eyes. He leisurely surveyed the outer disciples of Drizzle Peak, and then he fixed his gaze on Wurth. He sneered and with a curl of his lips said, "Is there anyone better in Drizzle Peak? Why send a butterball here?"</p>

  <p>"Wow ..."</p>

  <p>To challenge one of the other peaks was to stand and fight on someone else's turf. In general, challengers tended to keep a low profile, even if they were sure to win.</p>

  <p>After all, if they enraged all disciples of that peak, they would be at the risk of being attacked by the bystanders. No matter how powerful they might be, they couldn't withstand the attacks of a crowd of cultivators.</p>

  <p>Though the rules of Cloud Sect were strict, they couldn't punish numerous offenders. So if Tan were beaten to death by an angry crowd, perhaps no one would be held responsible for his death.</p>

  <p>But Tan didn't rein in his arrogance. Winning three games consecutively seemed to have increased his ego. After hearing what Tan said, the outer disciples of Drizzle Peak got angry and burst out a storm of abuses.</p>

  <p>Tan, without the slightest fear, stood on the edge of the battle ring and shouted, "Why do you abuse me? If you have the guts, come up to the arena and challenge me. I'm waiting for you. No matter how many of you come, I'll defeat you. Drizzle Peak ranks last every year, and there are no outstanding disciples in it. I think it would be better to remove it from the 33 peaks!"</p>

  <p>Zheng frowned when he heard what Tan said. At the same time, the outer disciples of Drizzle Peak were getting even more hostile, and the name-calling became louder. Things were going to get out of control.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Wurth, who had been smiling and standing silently in the battle ring, suddenly raised his hand.</p>

  <p>At the moment, his expression grew serious and all traces of his smile disappeared. It was a weird thing to see a smiling, fat man showing such a calm expression.</p>

  <p>His action immediately caused the other disciples to stop.</p>

  <p>Wurth stood at the seventh rank from among the outer disciples at Drizzle Peak.</p>

  <p>He was unassuming and easy to get along with. He hadn't offended anyone in Drizzle Peak.</p>

  <p>He was a quiet and under-the-radar guy.</p>

  <p>But it was clear to all that the strength hidden under the fat body was astonishing.</p>

  <p>Some people still remembered what had happened when he had entered Cloud Sect and become an outer disciple of Drizzle Peak. At that time, a few disciples thought he was weak and could be bullied easily. But when they went to cause trouble, they were easily slammed to the ground.</p>

  <p>Only then did they realize that this fat man, who looked kind and harmless to all, was definitely a fierce man.</p>

  <p>His strength was stable ever since. No one had been able to take his rank at Drizzle Peak.</p>

  <p>But many disciples suspected that Wurth had concealed his real strength.</p>

  <p>If he did his best, he would be in the top five.</p>

  <p>"Tan, the challenge between two peaks is a very ordinary competition in Cloud Sect. It's unacceptable for you to talk like that," said Wurth with a straight face.</p>

  <p>Wurth was a good-tempered man. If anyone else had been contesting Tan, he would have been scolding Tan. But Wurth wouldn't do that. As a matter of fact, people who really knew Wurth could say that despite his pleasant demeanor, Wurth was furious at the moment. They knew that Wurth displayed his anger differently from others.</p>

  <p>However, Tan couldn't detect Wurth's anger at all. He shook his head and with a contemptuous sneer asked, "But I did speak like that. Now, what are you gonna do? And what's wrong with what I said? I think you should give up right now. If there's no one stronger, we Vulture Peak will win the challenge. It's a real pity that I can't find an outstanding disciple from Drizzle Peak to fight. It disappoints me to see a fat man up here."</p>

  <p>"We will play, and then you can tell us who is more powerful. Let's stop talking and get started. I really don't like the way you guys whine. So much for Vulture Peak," Wurth shook his head and retorted.</p>

  <p>"Don't want me to whine?" Tan laughed and said, "OK, then, let's begin.</p>

  <p>I'll give you a good hiding and ensure that you have no power to fight back."</p>

  <p>Then Tan raised his hands and burst out brown life energy. With a sudden and loud shout, he put the brown life energy into the ground of the battle ring.</p>

  <p>"Sacred Wood Thrust!"</p>

  <p>"Peng, Peng!"</p>

  <p>When Zheng saw this, his brows shot up in surprise. Tan's life energy seemed to have a strong affinity for the metal element. He was able to put his life energy into the battle ring made of gold and iron.</p>

  <p>Then, a shining brown light appeared at Wurth's feet. Two brown wood stakes started to come out from where he stood.</p>

  <p>Tan was only a half-step into the nature level. The Sacred Wood created by his life energy was half virtual and half real, as it had not yet congealed into a physical form. If he had reached the nature level, the stakes rising from the battle ring would be pieces of real Sacred Wood.</p>

  <p>Even so, the attack power of these pieces of Sacred Wood should not be underestimated. If the Sacred Wood hit Wurth, he would be severely wounded and would lose half of his life. Zheng was getting nervous at this scene.</p>
