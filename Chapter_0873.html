<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 873 Two Bitches </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Now it was just Luo Zheng and his sword spirit in the empty palace.</p>

  <p>The innate queen's Mu Ning slowly vanished from Xun's body. Now she was like an ordinary young member of the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>After Xun had spoken in the Tower of Sin, there hadn't been much interaction between her and Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He thought for a while before asking, "The weapon on this statue is a spear, so why is it that your sword was stuck in the Killing Sword Mountain?"</p>

  <p>"That is the Heavenly Fate, the holy spear of my clan. Before I turned 18, I was a swordsman," Xun replied.</p>

  <p>So that explained it!</p>

  <p>Xun's simple answer immediately solved the mystery in Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>If Xun was the queen of the Demon Night, then she should be able to climb the peak of the mountain with her powers. Surely she wouldn't just insert her sword halfway up the Killing Sword Mountain.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had assumed that when she had attained the Consummate Sword Intent, her cultivation level was not very high, and therefore, she couldn't reach the mountaintop.</p>

  <p>"But why did you become like this..."</p>

  <p>Before Luo Zheng could complete his question, Xun interrupted him. "There's no need to ask. You'll know in a while," she said without any emotion.</p>

  <p>She walked towards the azure blue statue and raised her hand. A faint ray of light emitted from her hand and a strange rune appeared in the light. She then slammed it down hard on the statue!</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>The statue glowed with a brilliant blue light.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes had been baptized by the sap of the divine tree, so he was able to see the changes on the statue clearly despite the blinding blue light.</p>

  <p>"This is�"</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes were wide open. The statue seemed to be alive! She blinked her eyes a few times and the blue light gradually dimmed. Then, a faint smile appeared on her face.</p>

  <p>"Xun must be communicating with another queen of the Demon Night," he guessed. It was possible that the many sacred places of the Demon Night in the Lower World maintained contact with the Upper World through these three statues.</p>

  <p>This method was very useful. Although the Upper World might not be able to transfer its resources to the Lower World, it could at least convey classified information to the Lower World, such as refinement techniques, through these statues.</p>

  <p>Was Xun seeking the help of another queen?</p>

  <p>But that notion was dispelled when Luo Zheng heard Xun speak to the statue in an unbelievably audacious tone. "Bitch, you didn't expect me to still be alive, right?" Xun mocked.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha-ha!" The statue seemed to be alive as she covered her mouth and laughed. "You bitch, you aren't dead yet, huh? You still have one soul, and it's someone else's sword spirit."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng could not believe what he was hearing.</p>

  <p>The azure blue statue queen was responsible for handing out punishments in the Demon Night, while Xun was the one in charge of killings. Luo Zheng didn't expect these two to be abusive towards each other like a couple of shrews. How could Luo Zheng endure this? No wonder Xun had ordered all her clansmen to leave the palace.</p>

  <p>However, she didn't care about what Luo Zheng thought at all. Her face was contorted with fury. "So what? I only need one soul to kill a slut like you!"</p>

  <p>The statue sized up Xun, her face carrying a hint of ridicule. "Your real body has been destroyed by me. How can you kill me? Oh, I remember.</p>

  <p>Now you're a sword spirit. You used to be a swordsman, so your soul must have been hiding in the Killing Sword Mountain, right? You're attached to the body of a human boy at the Internal Elixir Realm. In your current persona, I'm afraid that you can't leave the world you are in, let alone fight your way back!"</p>

  <p>The statue's words pierced Xun's heart. Her expression darkened and a cold smile spread on her face. "Oh? Really? Bitch, look at the person beside me, and tell me whether I can leave this world or not!"</p>

  <p>The statue turned her head slightly and looked at Luo Zheng. "Hah! He's just a human at the Internal Elixir Realm. Do you think that�"</p>

  <p>The statue looked at Luo Zheng carefully and the words left her lips. The conversation suddenly came to a halt.</p>

  <p>"Bitch, open your eyes and look carefully!" Xun sneered.</p>

  <p>The smug smile that had appeared on the statue queen slowly disappeared, and was replaced by resentment. "I really didn't think that your luck would be so good! You have actually met someone who has the fate to lead the world of chaos!"</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! Why? Are you jealous of me? You bitch!" Xun cursed coldly.</p>

  <p>The statue shouted hysterically, "Yes! I'm jealous of you. I've been jealous of you since we were young! Why are you always luckier than me? I'm not inferior to you in any way, but the things you get are always better than mine! That was why I had to destroy you! So what if you find a man who has the fate to lead the world of chaos? You no longer have the ability to turn the tables!"</p>

  <p>Xun snorted derisively, "We will see!"</p>

  <p>"We'll see? Do you think I'm going to give a bitch like you a chance?" said the statue raising her eyebrow. The statue queen suddenly moved. She swung the meteor hammer in her hand towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng felt like his head was about to explode with all the swearing that was going on between the two queens. He didn't expect the statue to attack him, and it actually gave him a fright.</p>

  <p>Just as the meteor hammer was about to touch Zheng's head, his eyes flashed and he suddenly swerved his body, avoiding the blow. However, a huge crater had appeared on the ground.</p>

  <p>After the statue pulled the hammer out of the crater, a few of the spikes on the hammer broke.</p>

  <p>The statue queen wasn't a fairy or sacred weapon after all. Hard weapons like that couldn't be carved. She had used theurgy to attach herself to the statue, but because of her material, she wasn't a big threat to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>When the statue brought the meteor hammer down a second time, Luo Zheng threw out a punch, smashing it to pieces.</p>

  <p>However, he didn't say anything at this point. The grudge between these two women was a bit strange for him. It would be unwise for him to get involved.</p>

  <p>"Give me the sword!"</p>

  <p>Xun stretched out her hand towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng understood that she wanted the huge black sword of the Blood Fiend Emperor. He nodded and threw it to her.</p>

  <p>Xun jumped up with the sword in hand and floated above the statue's head. She clicked her tongue twice before speaking, "You want to kill someone who has the fate to lead the world of chaos with this dumb statue?</p>

  <p>Bitch, you've always been so naive!"</p>

  <p>The statue snorted, "So what? In the end, I won. As soon as I kill your last soul, the Demon Night will choose a new Queen of Killings, and you will become history!"</p>

  <p>"Oh yeah? Give it your best shot, slut!" Xun challenged. She raised the huge sword high up and hacked down the statue's head. The statue was split into two and the broken pieces fell onto the ground.</p>

  <p>Only half of the statue was left, but she still spoke, "Then I'll be waiting for you. You bloody�"</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The black sword smashed the remaining half of the statue's head into pieces. Xun stabbed the sword heavily into the ground. Her anger dissipated and she looked at Luo Zheng miserably.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stood there agape. He really didn't know what to say.</p>

  <p>After a while, Luo Zheng asked, "You, you came here just to fight with her, didn't you?"</p>

  <p>Xun nodded. "Yes!" she admitted frankly.</p>

  <p>Hearing their squabble, Luo Zheng was certain that Xun had come here looking for a fight, but he had never heard of such a bizarre way of fighting.</p>

  <p>"But�" Luo Zheng threw up his hands and looked at Xun's face. He wanted to say something to comfort her, but he didn't know what had happened between Xun and that woman.</p>

  <p>"You'll help me, won't you?" Xun stared blankly at Luo Zheng. This was the first time she had ever asked him for a favor.</p>

  <p>This was an internal conflict of the Demon Night. It was definitely not a good idea for Luo Zheng to get involved.</p>

  <p>The Demon Night race wasn't inferior to the Genuine Dragon.</p>

  <p>The three statues in front of him were the queens of the Demon Night, and their strength was beyond anything Luo Zheng could imagine.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I'm not strong enough," Luo Zheng replied, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>Although he had just stepped into the war general level, he was obviously not powerful enough. Not to mention the queen responsible for punishments, even Amber of the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place and many other warriors of the Soul Sea Realm could crush him with a single finger.</p>

  <p>Xun stared at Luo Zheng and said, "It's true that you're not powerful enough now, but you are the most important chess piece in this game and will eventually return to your position!"</p>
