<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 399 Righteousness Song (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Dick, no longer scrupled by the demonic phantoms, kept on writing with much determination. And the words were getting more and more powerful, lively and vigorous!</p>

  <p>After a while, the demonic phantoms failed to break his defense song, and Dick had written down the entire Righteousness Song neatly!</p>

  <p>"Done!" Dick proclaimed in a confident tone.</p>

  <p>The brush in the hand gently glided gracefully as he drew the finishing point.</p>

  <p>"Droning droning droning..."</p>

  <p>A whole song was suspending?at?Dick's side, constantly shaking and singing. The written words, with black ink, gradually emitted a radiating golden sheen.</p>

  <p>Dick was now like a great ancient saint, sending out the sense of a power that usually made people bow to him, without the slightest resistance from the heart.</p>

  <p>Dick's gaze swept across those demonic phantoms. The next moment he pointed a finger, and a golden light shot out from the Righteousness Song! This gleaming golden light ran through the demonic phantoms directly!</p>

  <p>"Flip-flop!"</p>

  <p>Within a flash, the demonic phantoms cracked, turned?into flashes and condensed into new demonic phantoms yet again.</p>

  <p>"This is not possible. I can't believe that the life vitality is imperishable.</p>

  <p>Having been broken for so many times, they should be unable to recover..." Dick said in an indifferent tone as he immediately sprung his fingers continuously Under Dick's control, flashes of golden light?seamlessly shot at the demonic phantoms. After being shattered repeatedly again and again, the demonic phantoms?were doggedly restored to their former condition each time.</p>

  <p>Facing?Dick's attack, Zheng's mind too was spinning at full speed.</p>

  <p>Of course, those phantoms?were not immortal!</p>

  <p>Between heaven and earth, everything was affected by the law of time, even life would come to an end eventually. Although, natural creatures were longevity, they could not live over three hundred years. The life of the?Illuminating Soul Realm?masters too was long, but it too could last only 500 years. While mysterious weapons could be preserved for 100 years, spiritual weapons could be preserved for 500 years and fairy weapons could be preserved for thousands of years.</p>

  <p>But...</p>

  <p>Compared to the world's vast history spanning over millions, even hundreds of millions, or even billions of years, these would all just be a fraction of a second.</p>

  <p>The demonic phantoms kept being shattered, restored, and shattered, and restored...The cycle?continued in almost a vicious manner breaking hope.</p>

  <p>The demonic life vitality inside?was constantly consumed. If the demonic?life vitality?was consumed to a certain process, in the end, the demonic phantoms simply could not escape the fate of cracking!</p>

  <p>'How to break his Righteousness Song?' Luo Zheng thought in confusion.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng gritted his teeth and looked at the rows of words, then a thought hit him in the head. He immediately controlled the six demonic phantoms to rush towards the Righteousness Song.</p>

  <p>While Dick remained calm, abstracting the righteous spirit of Righteousness Song in an orderly manner, and preparing to launch an attack towads the demonic phantoms.</p>

  <p>The demonic phantoms would be crushed every time they flew out for a certain distance. However, the distance between them and the Righteousness Song would always be?close. In such an extremely difficult and tense situation, the demonic phantoms finally came to the top of the Righteousness Song.</p>

  <p>Dick?was puzzled about what Luo Zheng was trying to achieve.</p>

  <p>Once Righteousness Song was condensed out, there would be an endless righteous spirit. Moreover, on the Righteousness Song's surface, the words were also coated with a golden glory, which was also coming from the righteous spirit in a bid to protect this Righteousness Song.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng wanted to use the demonic phantoms to smash the Righteousness Song, it would remain a mere fantasy!</p>

  <p>With his unshakable confidence on the Righteousness Song, Dick didn't even bother to move the song in front of him. Instead, he just concentrated on crushing the demonic phantoms one by one.</p>

  <p>But after those demonic phantoms?were?shattered, they didn't form any new demonic phantoms, but flashes of?life vitality appeared.</p>

  <p>"So does this mean the damn demonic phantoms have finally shattered?" thought?Dick in his mind. But before he could take a sigh of relief, the scene before him rendered him speechless as he was gripped with a glimmer of fear and shock.</p>

  <p>The flashes of demonic life vitality did not crack, and they did not re-condense into the demonic phantoms, but twined around every word of the Righteousness Song.</p>

  <p>If the words were only twined by?life vitality, it was not worth Dick's concern.</p>

  <p>The golden color on the Righteousness Song's surface?was the condensation of the righteousness spirit, and it remained unharmed by attacks from swords and cutters, even the mighty fairy weapons.</p>

  <p>But as the demonic life vitality twined around it, it was swallowing up the golden light entirely!</p>

  <p>"Swallow the golden light? No way!" Dick suddenly panicked, he did not expect that Zheng's demonic life vitality?would be able to swallow the light entirely. It was swallowing his?Righteousness Song. Upon seeing many words on the Righteousness Song's surface slowly dim down, Dick was scared that the Righteousness Song?would be swallowed up entirely soon...</p>

  <p>Dick suddenly looked at Luo Zheng, realizing that he should not have bothered himself dealing with the demonic phantoms before, instead, he should just beat Luo Zheng?with the Righteousness Song sooner. As long as Luo Zheng?was defeated, these demonic phantoms would fall back immediately.</p>

  <p>Finally, Dick was clear about everything. He stretched out his hand and a thick and big golden light shot out from the Righteousness Song. It was almost six times bigger than the former light, which went straight towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>In the face of Dick's frontal attack, Luo Zheng sped up and suddenly dodged aside as if he was the wind itself!</p>
