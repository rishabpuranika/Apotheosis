<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>This sort of conflict was not something that an ordinary martial artist could participate in.</p>

  <p>Yolande was not apt to do it, and so was the case with Kyron.</p>

  <p>However, being incompetent did not mean that they did not pay heed to it.</p>

  <p>The three great human powers— the Humanity Alliance, the Thoughtless Minds, and the Blessed Buddha Land— were all watching closely.</p>

  <p>The Demon Night, the ogres, the Celestial Position, and the thousands of other Upper World races were also paying close attention in silence.</p>

  <p>It could be said that the entire universe was focused on this place. On this day, they had memorized a name, and the name belonged to a warrior who was only at the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>The faces of the Supreme Lords gradually darkened, revealing their frustration.</p>

  <p>As the other Supreme Lords looked at the black and white light band, they turned deathly pale. At the same time, they felt relieved that they had not been caught by it.</p>

  <p>The situation in front of them had suddenly turned chaotic.</p>

  <p>Among the five Supreme Lords, only one could live.</p>

  <p>These five Supreme Lords were closely related to the others. For example, Addison and Ranell were from the same sect and race. If Addison decided to attack, Ranell would undoubtedly help him out.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, if Supreme Lord Gunter were to make a move, Yao, Queen of the Demon Night, would not just stand by and watch.</p>

  <p>The price of a duel to the death would be too high. It might even cause the entire universe to be thrown into turmoil.</p>

  <p>The trouble was that even after paying so much, they did not receive anything, owing to Zheng's trickery. He was just some kid at the Soul Sea Realm. How could the Supreme Lords be willing to accept this?</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords present thought things through. They chose not to act. Instead, they looked toward the grain of sand. The black and white light band had come out of the grain.</p>

  <p>A faint smile rested on Addison's face. With one leap, he appeared right before the grain of sand. Just as he was about to open his mouth, he stopped, not knowing what to say.</p>

  <p>To plead with a nobody at the Soul Sea Realm was indeed embarrassing for a Supreme Lord like Addison. After mulling over it for a while, he finally spoke up. "Your name is Luo Zheng, correct?"</p>

  <p>"Supreme Lord Addison. What is it?"</p>

  <p>Zheng's indifferent voice resounded through the universe.</p>

  <p>Addison raised his head and looked at the sky. In his heart, he cursed Luo Zheng viciously. 'This kid apparently wants all creatures of the hundred thousand supreme worlds to know that I'm groveling before him.'</p>

  <p>In the end, to Addison, his life was more important than his dignity.</p>

  <p>The other four Supreme Lords watched with cautious expressions on their faces, wondering how this negotiation between Addison and Luo Zheng would turn out.</p>

  <p>"I see no point in using this Desperate Melee. Could you remove the black and white light band?" Addison used a gentle tone as he spoke to Luo Zheng, clearly placing a request.</p>

  <p>The ogres were known to be arrogant and ruthless. Even an ordinary martial artist of the race would not be so amiable, much less a Supreme Lord. Addison was indeed putting his dignity on the line.</p>

  <p>"Remove it? Heh! I do not have control over it, so naturally, there is no way to remove it," Luo Zheng replied once again, his voice echoing through the universe.</p>

  <p>Before deciding to release Desperate Melee, Luo Zheng had asked Saul if it could be revoked.</p>

  <p>The answer he got was a resounding 'no'. Saul had told him that Desperate Melee had been devised by his master. Unless his master personally came here to remove it, only one person among the people confined within the light band would survive.</p>

  <p>Hearing Zheng's answer, Addison took a slow deep breath. He was visibly disturbed. "You mean..."</p>

  <p>"Only one person will survive. Only one Supreme Lord. There is no other way." Zheng's indifferent voice once again sounded like it came from the heavens. The faces of the other four Supreme Lords darkened at the same time. This was not the answer they had been hoping for.</p>

  <p>A faint killing intent was visible within Myles' eyes. If only one of them could outlive the others, then that person should be him! In this kind of situation, it was best to make the first move.</p>

  <p>Of course, at this moment, it was not only Myles that had the killing intent. So did the other Supreme Lords who had the same thoughts.</p>

  <p>Their lives were too precious. They had finally reached the top-level of martial arts with much struggle and inherited their Heavenly Destinies.</p>

  <p>None of them was willing to be tricked and killed by Luo Zheng in such a manner.</p>

  <p>'Die, all of you must die! The one who lives should be me!' Each of them was thinking along the same lines.</p>

  <p>But they still waited.</p>

  <p>After all, they only had one in five chances of surviving. They wanted to confirm if there were other ways to save themselves. If there were none, they could only fight.</p>

  <p>Right now, in the deep space below the Middle Sky Region, the atmosphere crackled with apprehension.</p>

  <p>Although Addison had a faint smile on his face as he talked to Luo Zheng, he was still on his guard. Once the others took action, he should be prepared to protect himself.</p>

  <p>"What if the five of us stay here for the rest of our lives?" Addison gave this idea after thinking for a while.</p>

  <p>The black and white light band had confined these Supreme Lords, but it did not disturb their minds. What if they lived in harmony with each other?</p>

  <p>The lifespan of the Supreme Lords was unimaginably long. If they stayed here for a million years, would the Desperate Melee's light band restrain them for that period of time?</p>

  <p>Hearing this question, Luo Zheng once again turned to Saul, who was standing to the side. As he explained the situation to Luo Zheng, Luo Zheng activated the Roaring Token.</p>

  <p>"The colors of this black and white light band will tell you the time you have left. When the white of the light band completely disappears and this band turns black, the five of you will die."</p>

  <p>As soon as Luo Zheng finished speaking, the Supreme Lords present focused their gazes on the black and white band of light. The black and the white, each occupied half of the area of the band. But if one looked carefully, they could see that the two colors were transforming quietly.</p>

  <p>The white on the light band was slowly being eroded by the black.</p>

  <p>At first, the black and white had taken up equal spaces on the band. In a short time, the black had occupied sixty percent of the area, while the white was constantly shrinking. Now, only about forty percent of the band was white.</p>

  <p>"How long do we have?" Addison asked again.</p>

  <p>"Six hours," Luo Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>No one could say for sure whether or not this black ribbon would take the lives of the five Supreme Lords, but they were not willing to take the risk of testing it when their lives were at stake. Thus, just as Luo Zheng finished speaking, someone could not help but take action.</p>

  <p>The first to attack was Myles. A faint water pattern appeared on his body and a water ring appeared behind him. A spine-chilling Mu Ning began to emit outward.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Myles' first target was Addison himself!</p>

  <p>Myles had considered it before making a move against Addison. He was a mid-rank Supreme Lord and was stronger than the four in front of him.</p>

  <p>If there were only the five of them without the other twenty-odd Supreme Lords watching, then his chances of winning would undoubtedly be the greatest. But Supreme Lord Ranell was still backing Addison up. Ranell was also a mid-rank Supreme Lord who was not weaker than Myles.</p>

  <p>Sooner or later, Myles would face Addison, and Ranell would help the latter. Rather than leaving Addison to the last, it would be better to kill him first. Once Addison died, Ranell would be upset, but he might not act on it.</p>

  <p>This was why he chose Addison to be his first target.</p>

  <p>"You!"</p>

  <p>Amongst the Supreme Lords, Addison feared Myles the most. He also had a plan in his head. Once the Supreme Lords were almost done fighting, he would fight the survivor together with Ranell. This way, his chances of victory would be much higher.</p>

  <p>However, he had not expected Myles to choose him first. It was obvious from Addison's face that he was both shocked and angry.</p>

  <p>As soon as Myles moved, Gunter attacked at the same time.</p>

  <p>As for the other two Supreme Lords, they were not slow either.</p>

  <p>When a Supreme Lord attacked, the power released was very intimidating.</p>

  <p>The battle of these Supreme Lords was enough to shatter a supreme world.</p>

  <p>What was more, they were bound within a hundred miles.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>With a deafening explosion, the battle finally began.</p>
