<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1773 The Father-son Talk </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>For the past few days, Luo Luo Zheng had been sitting cross-legged in the Ice Palace with his eyes closed in rapt attention as he monitored the movements of the entire great world minutely.</p>

  <p>Even after Luo Luo Zheng had ascended to the Upper World, he still had a mysterious connection to this great world. It was just that he was unable to transfer power to the great world.</p>

  <p>On his return, he once again linked to the will of the great world, only to discover that there was a change in this will.</p>

  <p>The entire great world was rhombus-shaped. If one were to look down at it from a high vantage point, they would see that it looked like a scale of a vicious beast. However, this time, he noticed something strange in it. It seemed that there was an opening on the edge of the great world.</p>

  <p>As for the will of the great world, even Luo Luo Zheng himself wasn't sure what it was exactly.</p>

  <p>The will of a martial artist was determined by their mental state when they reached a certain goal. Under normal circumstances, that state would be manifested through words and actions.</p>

  <p>But for the great world, words did not exist. Otherwise, when Luo Luo Zheng connected to the will of the great world, it would be able to communicate with him.</p>

  <p>And as for actions, the only action of the great world was that when Luo Luo Zheng was on the Divine Kingdom Continent, the great world formed an incarnation, hoping to use it to make up for the ascending passageway.</p>

  <p>The result, however, was the complete opposite. The will of the great world had been swallowed up by Luo Luo Zheng, and the Upper World's martial artists had been the ones to repair the ascending passageway.</p>

  <p>From then on, the will of the great world did not have any actions; it could only help Luo Luo Zheng transfer power that hit him.</p>

  <p>But this time when he returned to the Lower World, Luo Luo Zheng detected a hint of movement.</p>

  <p>He didn't know if the barrier of the great world broke by itself, or if there had been a sudden and unexpected issue.</p>

  <p>The will of the great world had actually entered into the neighboring great world. However, the will that entered the neighboring great world was not widespread. Luo Luo Zheng could only sense a small area of the vast sea, and there were some common beasts in the sea.</p>

  <p>He had never been to any other great world, but he imagined that it would be about the same as this great world.</p>

  <p>If he had the time, he would want to see the edge of the great world. The barrier was broken, and it seemed as if it was a gateway into another great world. Something like this had never happened before.</p>

  <p>However, at this stage, he naturally wasn't in the mood to go exploring.</p>

  <p>After the other Godly Geniuses had settled down, they decided to walk around. They had never been to the Lower World before, and although this place could not compare to the Upper World, they were curious about the local customs and traditions of this place.</p>

  <p>After staying by Luo Zheng's side for a day, Mu Ning decided to go back to the Ethereal Spirit Sect. Her relatives were still in that sect, after all, and now that it had been rebuilt, they were on the verge of gaining prominence. If Mu Ning returned, it would help the sect much more.</p>

  <p>After all, she was already at the Soul Sea Realm, and, in terms of strength, no one in the great world could be a match for her.</p>

  <p>On this day, Luo Luo Zheng continued to monitor the entire great world.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, a small head popped out near the entrance of the palace. A pair of eyes, resembling the eyes of a young Luo Luo Zheng, shone with curiosity.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian's image of his father only existed in his imagination.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng had ascended to the Upper World, his stories were already deeply engraved in every corner of the Cloud Hall. As a result, Luo Nian had heard many legends about his father.</p>

  <p>Once when he was younger, he really wanted to see his father. So he swore that he would ascend to the Upper World and go find his father.</p>

  <p>But now that his father had come back, Luo Nian was greatly disappointed.</p>

  <p>He had been mercilessly reprimanded when he met his father for the first time. In his young mind, the heroic image of his father had suddenly collapsed, and his father had turned into a terrifying monster. He was not pleased with his father.</p>

  <p>It had to be known that there was nobody in the Cloud Hall who dared to discipline Luo Nian.</p>

  <p>Earlier, when Ning Yudie was around, she had been able to control the kid.</p>

  <p>However, after she ascended, Imogen coddled the little boy. Thus, he had a free rein.</p>

  <p>In Luo Nian's tiny mind, the only opinion he had of Luo Luo Zheng was that he hated him.</p>

  <p>Still, Luo Luo Zheng was his father, and he couldn't suppress his curiosity about him.</p>

  <p>After being sullen for two days, he finally sneaked up to the highest floor of the Cloud Hall and secretly sized up Luo Luo Zheng from a corner.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng did not open his eyes, his formless sensing power detected Luo Nian. Luo Nian's figure, appearance and size were all visible in Luo Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had to admit that although this child was naughty, he was precocious. His cultivation foundation was quite solid!</p>

  <p>When he was younger, he could not have caught up with Luo Nian.</p>

  <p>In the end, the Luo Clan was no match for the Cloud Hall in terms of resources. On the other hand, while foundation was important, the arduous efforts of a warrior also played a decisive role.</p>

  <p>For example, the backgrounds of Nathan, Lucille, and the others were already incomparable in the entire universe. However, this did not mean that they could easily obtain first place. They also needed to cultivate very hard.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng himself was a fine mix of both and therefore the best example.</p>

  <p>That was why he felt that he needed to discipline his son and make him an honorable and hard-working person.</p>

  <p>However, his first interaction with his son had been harsh. He must have been scared out of his wits.</p>

  <p>In the end, it was still the result of Imogen's pampering. Luo Luo Zheng realized he couldn't blame Luo Nian.</p>

  <p>As he contemplated this, Luo Luo Zheng raised his knees slightly, and his figure disappeared from where he sat.</p>

  <p>"Huh?"</p>

  <p>Luo Nian's eyes were filled with curiosity. He immediately understood that Luo Luo Zheng had sensed him, so he quickly turned around to leave. However, when he looked back, he found that his father was already standing behind him with a kind smile on his face.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng had a smile on his face, the boy still appeared timid.</p>

  <p>"Luo Nian," Luo Luo Zheng called out to him softly.</p>

  <p>"Hmm?" Luo Nian subconsciously replied. His eyes darted around with uncertainty as he said, "Dad?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng reached out and held Luo Nian in his arms.</p>

  <p>His mind was flooded with memories of Luo Nian's childhood. If he wanted to, he could find out what had happened in this great world with the help of the world's will.</p>

  <p>However, this memory belonged to the great world and not to Luo Luo Zheng. This strange feeling between him and his son could not be ignored.</p>

  <p>When he heard Luo Nian call him "Dad," a peculiar feeling filled his heart. He grabbed the little boy and said, "I'll take you out!"</p>

  <p>He lovingly placed Luo Nian on his neck, and with a sudden flash, he flew into the sky.</p>

  <p>Although all the warriors in the Cloud Hall took great care of Luo Nian, none of them were his father. At this moment, Luo Nian sensed a completely different feeling, one that he had never had before.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha!" He laughed gleefully.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng soared across the air and they quickly closed in on the enchanted barrier above the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>"We're about to collide!"</p>

  <p>Luo Nian shrieked. He was very familiar with this enchanted barrier. This one looked like a layer of water, but it would be bad to collide with the barrier.</p>

  <p>"Close your eyes," Luo Luo Zheng instructed.</p>
