<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3215 Searching The Mountain </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The intelligence agency had plenty of tried and tested torture methods under their sleeves. They did not think that someone like Zheng could withstand them.</p>

  <p>Natasha, however, disagreed. "We already broke the rules when we took Zheng to the Vastness Mountain," she said with a light shake of the head. "If he gets tortured under our watch, I'm sure it would be a big deal."</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng guessed, the people of the Vastness Mountain could only capture him, but they wouldn't dare to hurt him.</p>

  <p>Gethin waved his hand and said, "We need to be careful. We can't just torture him. I think we should leave him to Barnaby."</p>

  <p>The Vastness Mountain was one of the top three among the seven mountains. They were known as a force full of great talents.</p>

  <p>Barnaby was among them. He was a powerful man who worked for Gethin, and his Other Shore Token possessed great power. It could penetrate an opponent's soul and send them into deep confusion. Compared to Arjun, Barnaby was much better. They would have better luck if they sought his help.</p>

  <p>"But Barnaby is..." Natasha muttered with a surprised look on her face.</p>

  <p>"Alright, invite him back," said Gethin with a glimmer in his eyes. "We don't have much time left. This is a rare opportunity."</p>

  <p>Then, the tension in the room was disrupted by a muffled sound outside the Vastness Mountain.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>A loud noise similar to the sound of thunder erupted.</p>

  <p>Gethin and Natasha tensed at the sound of the muffled thud.</p>

  <p>A black armed guard rushed inside the Mighty Sword Hall. "Emperor Gethin," he started as he knelt down in front of Gethin. "Two Oneness Governors are trying to destroy our mountain protecting array!"</p>

  <p>"It must be Athemar and Goran. Are they out of their minds?" Natasha frowned.</p>

  <p>From the shadows, the voice of a man sneered, "Is it because we've been too modest recently? Are they really willing to go this far? How dare they break into the Vastness Mountain?!"</p>

  <p>Gethin's face darkened. His gaze turned stone cold. "We must have underestimated Zheng's importance to them. Natasha, quickly ask Barnaby for help."</p>

  <p>"Yes!" Natasha nodded as she ran out of the hall.</p>

  <p>Gethin turned to the guard in black. "Remove the mountain protecting array," he ordered. "Fetch the two Oneness Governors and take them here."</p>

  <p>Outside the Vastness Mountain, bright light covered the sky.</p>

  <p>Upon careful observation, one could see that thousands of long swords glittered the heavens. This was the protecting array of the Vastness Mountain.</p>

  <p>This array was powerful, but the two men that hovered were not going to back down so easily.</p>

  <p>Athemar spread his long arms and a huge seal covered his back.</p>

  <p>It was the original Imperial Sword Seal.</p>

  <p>Behind Athemar, over one hundred long swords floated. When he activated the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, the original seal on his back released many rays of large sword radiance, each extremely powerful.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>A ray of sword radiance flew right into the mountain. It trembled as its protecting array was harmed.</p>

  <p>Beside him, Goran held a long sword. He quietly tried to sneak an attack.</p>

  <p>His eyes shone like torches.</p>

  <p>Each time the mountain trembled in weakness, Goran waved his sword.</p>

  <p>The sword strike caused immense pressure to the array.</p>

  <p>Athemar and Goran were Oneness Governors. It was unwise of them to attack the protecting array of the Vastness Mountain directly.</p>

  <p>But they needed a quick way to rescue Zheng. He was of great value to them, after all.</p>

  <p>He was the only one who had deciphered the Truth Enlightenment. His special knowledge made him extra special to their group.</p>

  <p>Just now, they politely requested to see Gethin outside the Vastness Mountain.</p>

  <p>But the guards merely answered no. They said that the mountain was closed and no outsider was allowed to enter it.</p>

  <p>With great rage, Athemar caused further damage to the Vastness Mountain as he continued to attack it.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>The mountain protecting array shook violently. Only a few hits and it would surely be destroyed.</p>

  <p>Then, an armed guard ran towards them. "Stop!" he shouted with a pleading voice. "Don't attack the array anymore! Emperor Gethin agreed to meet you!"</p>

  <p>Then, the light faded as the array was removed.</p>

  <p>Athemar put away the Imperial Sword Seal, with his head held high.</p>

  <p>Goran also put away his long sword. He smiled and said, "We already did so much harm to the mountain. I'm sure Gethin is furious. I doubt the negotiation would go smoothly."</p>

  <p>Athemar stood his ground firmly. "As long as he hands over Zheng, then things are fine. Otherwise, get ready to fight."</p>

  <p>Goran shook his head. Athemar was acting like a typical member of the Flow Sword Sect: stubborn and rash. But Goran knew that even if they worked together, they would not be strong enough to win against the Vastness Mountain.</p>

  <p>The two of them rushed towards the mountain top and entered the Mighty Sword Hall.</p>

  <p>Athemar tried to conceal his anger with a curt smile. "Greetings, Emperor Gethin," he greeted as he reached his hands out.</p>

  <p>Oneness Governors were normally perceived as inferior to a mountain master. However, Oneness Governors were conferred by Eastern Emperor Taiyi himself. Because of that, they were considered powerhouses. They did not have to humble themselves too much in front of Gethin.</p>

  <p>Gethin sat on the golden throne. He ignored Athemar's salute and instead slapped his hand on the throne's armrest. "That is the way how you greet me? By trying to destroy my mountain protecting array?"</p>

  <p>Gethin's attitude amused Goran, but Goran tried his best to maintain a serious face. He knew that Gethin was being exaggerated.</p>

  <p>Athemar didn't buy his reactions as well. "Well, I didn't come here for niceties as well. We know Zheng is here and we merely want to rescue him.</p>

  <p>Your mountain protecting array was obviously in the way so I did what I had to do. We hope you could forgive us."</p>

  <p>Athemar could tell that Gethin was merely stalling for time.</p>

  <p>"Forgive you? Why would I forgive you so easily?" Gethin sneered.</p>

  <p>Athemar remained unfazed. "I don't care whether you forgive me or not," he remarked. "Just hand over Zheng today. Let's deal with the damages next time."</p>

  <p>Gethin was sensing just how significant Zheng was to them. He knew they wouldn't give up without a fight. He just didn't expect Athemar to be so rude.</p>

  <p>With a straight face, Gethin said, "Zheng is not here. You must have come to the wrong place."</p>

  <p>"Don't lie. I know he's here. If we search the mountain, I'm sure we can find Zheng," Athemar insisted.</p>

  <p>"Search the mountain?" Gethin's face grew red with fury. A terrifying aura filled the Mighty Sword Hall. He said in a sinister tone, "The Vastness Mountain is as old as the Oneness Sky Palace. I've lived far longer than Eastern Emperor Taiyi in the Bloom Divine Province! No one dares to threaten me like that! No one is allowed to search my territory!"</p>

  <p>Goran tried to keep a straight face, but Gethin's strong aura was starting to suffocate him.</p>

  <p>"Well," Athemar sneered, "I guess today's an exception."</p>
