<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Sealing Machine was set up by Master Evil and it was quite ingenious, to say the least.</p>

  <p>Once the Sealing Machine itself was sealed, it only gave one chance to be opened. If someone attempted to open it using the wrong order, the entire Sealing Machine would self-destruct, including everything inside it.</p>

  <p>At the time, Master Evil had sealed an extremely important treasure, one that he had obtained himself and buried it beneath the Black Wind Ridge.</p>

  <p>Even if someone was determined enough to try stealing it from its spot, they wouldn't obtain anything anyway.</p>

  <p>After the seven divine eras had passed, the first thing Master Evil did after he returned was retrieve his treasure. Clearly, through his actions, one could tell that this treasure was extremely important to him.</p>

  <p>What Master Evil hadn't expected though, was that someone would be waiting for him in the Vast Sky Region. Even more so, that same person had waited for a full seven divine eras.</p>

  <p>And yet, Zheng had been staying in Misty Mountain Village the entire time.</p>

  <p>Never had he noticed the presence, let alone the existence of such a character.</p>

  <p>To have the capacity of hiding within Misty Mountain Village and completely avoiding Zheng's sharp spiritual sense could only mean that this person was strong. Perhaps even stronger than Master Evil. And what was to say of his courage, showing up here at such a time?</p>

  <p>With a squeak, a house door amidst the Misty Mountain Village creaked slowly open. A figure walked out. He was thin and handsome and carried a feather fan in his hand. As he walked, he spoke and smiled arrogantly.</p>

  <p>"To be honest, I never actually expected you to come back, you evil old dog. This Sealing Machine is so ingenious - I've studied it myself for so many years. I even asked someone to seal it with the Timing Godly Way so that I could take out its content after triggering it. Unfortunately, I just didn't dare take the risk, for fear of destroying the Sealing Machine. My only option was to sit and wait, possibly forever. And now, the day has finally come!"</p>

  <p>Master Evil's face was covered in a coldness. He stared at the person with his bean-sized eyes as words came out of his mouth, "Yorick Yin!</p>

  <p>Humph! You really are fucking patient!"</p>

  <p>Seeing Master Evil's expression, the smile on Yorick's face quickly began to spread. His eyes twinkled and he said, "Of course! For something of such importance, trust me, I could've afforded to waste even more time. What's a mere seven divine eras? Make me wait for seventy! Then we'll talk patience."</p>

  <p>As Yorick spoke, his eyes indifferently glanced behind Master Evil on several occasions. "But I'm curious, this little fellow named Tianxing standing behind you, where does he come from?" he asked. "Among proving godly warriors, Tianxing can be considered absolutely outstanding.</p>

  <p>Could it be that he came from a wealthy clan on a Floating Island?"</p>

  <p>Yorick continued.</p>

  <p>Zheng frowned, but said nothing in return. Yorick knew his name was Tianxing, thus he must have been lurking here for at least a few days, not to say secretly watching and observing him. This made Zheng suddenly feel quite uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>In Yorick's mind, only the wealthy clans of the Floating Islands could nurture such a proving godly warrior.</p>

  <p>And judging by Zheng's background, he was indeed a member of a wealthy clan on a Floating Island. After all, the Luo Clan had once owned a Floating Island in the Time Sea, and the Luo Clan's Floating Island was actually ranked quite high. Unfortunately, because Mike declined, the Floating Island was taken over by other clans, and a thousand disciples on it were driven away.</p>

  <p>Master Evil was in no mood to have to explain this to Yorick. He had already activated the Sealing Machine, and his mind was quickly spinning. His cultivation level was the same as Yorick's, but Master Evil had been locked in a prison for many, many years. Although his cultivation level might not have decreased, chances were, his strength had.</p>

  <p>Although Yorick was also a mid-rank True God, he had definitely made significant progress in the past few years. In such a battle situation, the difference in strength between the two of them would probably be quite large.</p>

  <p>"So you've got patience, that we know, but I'm wondering... Do you even have the ability to get the treasure?" Master Evil gathered his inner power, and then he jumped back abruptly. Black smoke curled up around him and his entire body appeared to be transforming into an illusory figure.</p>

  <p>"Heinously Evil Way!"</p>

  <p>The black smoke lingered for a moment before Master Evil's snow-white hair suddenly turned black. The wrinkles on his face were so deep that they seemed to have been carved out by a knife, and two illusory devil claws appeared on his hands. Master Evil charged towards Yorick at an extremely high speed. So fast that he could barely be seen.</p>

  <p>Master Evil wasn't very tall, in fact, he was nearly a whole head shorter than Zheng. Because of his old age, he was also quite small and skinny.</p>

  <p>Ultimately though, he was still a True God. Once he made his move, it would be a fatal one.</p>

  <p>The pair of devil claws quickly condensed and charged toward Yorick.</p>

  <p>Of course, this attack was extraordinarily sharp. From Zheng's point of view, even though Master Evil's grab seemed rather ordinary, the power it contained still came as a shock. At the very least, due to Zheng's current strength, he wouldn't be able to withstand such a move.</p>

  <p>Yorick seemed to be quite familiar with Master Evil's movements. More importantly, he knew how powerful Master Evil's move truly was and therefore, he didn't choose to face the attack head on. As he retreated instead, he gently waved the feather fan in his hand, and his entire body suddenly became extremely nimble. He left an afterimage behind him as he moved and dodged Master Evil's attack.</p>

  <p>When these two True Gods began to fight, Zheng didn't even care about watching the show. If he wasn't careful, he could get hurt. Instead, he quietly jumped on top of a house to the side of the ongoing action. From his safe spot, he heard the buildings in the Misty Mountain Village collapse one by one, and the surface of the ridge started to show signs of disintegration.</p>

  <p>Zheng was glad that he had evacuated the villagers of Misty Mountain Village. If he hadn't done so, when these two True Gods fought, the villagers would have been in deep trouble.</p>

  <p>Before, in the universe, he had seen True Gods fight, and it was safe to say that their strength could even destroy a world, since their power was hundreds of times more tyrannical than a Supreme Lord's. Now though, these two True Gods had only just destroyed a single mountain. It seemed that the restraints of strength throughout the divine land were quite great.</p>

  <p>The feather fan in Yorick's hand was both like a knife and a shield. Not only could it block Master Evil's claws, it could also slash out back at him.</p>

  <p>A strong power was condensed in the light feather fan. The power turned into a sharp blade of light, and chopped towards Master Evil. This sharp light was fast and fierce. On quite a few occasions, Master Evil had been completely unable to dodge it, and a bone-deep wound immediately appeared on his body.</p>

  <p>The smile on Yorick's face grew increasingly wider. Back in the day, he had been struck hard by Master Evil and ended up in a miserable state.</p>

  <p>After silently hiding for seven divine eras, not only did he now have the opportunity for revenge, but he also had a sense of pride in the idea that he was going to obtain that important object.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Zheng was at a loss. He had encountered Master Evil in the divine land and wanted to help him. But who knew that Master Evil would run into a powerful enemy right after he had returned to Vast Sky Region? Zheng hadn't seen it coming.</p>

  <p>In a battle of this level, even watching the fight was a great risk for Zheng, much less going forward to help. Right now, the wisest decision for him was to leave. His strength was nowhere near being up to par.</p>

  <p>"Humph! You evil old dog! Back when you stole my good fortune, you never expected this day to come, did you?"</p>

  <p>Yorick suddenly turned around with mighty speed, once again dodging Master Evil's grab with ease. He waved the feather fan and slammed it down heavily on Master Evil's body.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Master Evil's frail body suddenly smashed into the whole of Misty Mountain Village. The ridge, originally a maze of cracks, ultimately collapsed with a loud crash. The hill that Misty Mountain Village was on was now a hollow ditch.</p>

  <p>After the small hill collapsed, the houses and pavilions that had been built there rapidly sank into the hill and fell into a huge, dark cave. Zheng also involuntarily fell into the cave.</p>

  <p>As Zheng fell into the depths, an overwhelming feeling of depression washed over him. 'It's truly inconvenient for a person in the divine land to be unable to fly, ' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>As for the warriors of Sun Moon Village, those that were standing outside guarding Misty Mountain Village, they were all dumbstruck as well. How could they dare step foot into Misty Mountain Village after Master Evil told them not to go inside? Thus, they stayed where they were and remained ignorant to what went on within Misty Mountain Village.</p>
