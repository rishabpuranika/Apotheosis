<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3880 The Purple Lightening Hammer </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Cyan Misty Sword cut through space silently and sent a straight cyan light from the void which hit the Cloud Light Sail.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>With the Cloud Light Sail slashed, a large hole appeared in the center as it began to collapse from the inside out.</p>

  <p>Fuxi and the Snake Goddess had just sped up but now came to sudden dead stop.</p>

  <p>"Those two fakes are really quite powerful," remarked the Grandmaster of Heaven. "But that's it. I've had enough!"</p>

  <p>He had once feared the real Fuxi.</p>

  <p>But since joining the Nihility race, he had improved his strength immensely and could now kill ordinary warriors at the Eternal Realm effortlessly.</p>

  <p>Now, even the real Fuxi was no match for him, let alone his avatar.</p>

  <p>But the two avatars' tenacity exceeded the Grandmaster of Heaven's expectations.</p>

  <p>He raised the Cyan Misty Sword and the sword radiance soared up into the sky. From his body burst an intense aura powerful enough to pierce through the heaven and earth.</p>

  <p>A mark of Eight Diagrams then covered him, just as he brandished his sword.</p>

  <p>Fuxi had quick fists and so the fist radiance would be released as soon as the mark of Eight Diagrams appeared.</p>

  <p>Before the Grandmaster of Heaven even knew what was going on, he had already been struck by Fuxi's terrifying fist radiance.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Caught off guard, the Grandmaster of Heaven was flung in the distance.</p>

  <p>"Seal!</p>

  <p>Limitless Power!"</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The Eight Diagrams disk above Fuxi's head rotated and countless marks of Eight Diagrams, both small and large, condensed all over the Grandmaster of Heaven's body.</p>

  <p>Fuxi was like a beast rushing at its prey; every muscle in his body swelled and his shoulder blades raised high like little wings.</p>

  <p>The Limitless Power was one of the Eight Diagrams disk's unique techniques. He could use the Eight Diagrams disk to maximize his bloodline and summon triple his base power in a short period of time.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess interlocked her fingers and strands of crimson light flowed and flashed from her fingertips.</p>

  <p>"Faceless Phantom!"</p>

  <p>Sizzle!</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a dark faceless figure appeared on the other side of the Grandmaster of Heaven. Although it had no visible face, its appearance and aura were the same as Fuxi's.</p>

  <p>This was the effect of the Faceless Phantom; it could create an identical phantom within a certain range which possessed all the power of its real counterpart. In this way, Fuxi could double his attack power.</p>

  <p>The air froze for around three seconds and he paused. Then, his hands transformed into numerous shadows, charging at the Grandmaster of Heaven at blistering speed, the phantom mirroring both him and his speed.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>The fist radiance exploded when it came into contact with the marks of Eight Diagrams. The shock waves that resonated from the impact tore everything in the surrounding spaces apart and decimated them to pieces as small as a grain of sand. They were so small that they looked like smoke as they shot and spread out in all directions.</p>

  <p>Fuxi kept this relentless pummeling up for five minutes straight.</p>

  <p>Spurred on by the Limitless Power, a single punch could seriously injure an Eternal Realm master, and it would take five punches at most to kill him for sure.</p>

  <p>In five minutes, he had struck out heaps of times.</p>

  <p>When the Limitless Power was depleted, the Eight Diagrams disk floating above Fuxi's head dimmed. The swelling in his muscles went down and he shrunk to his normal height, breathing heavily and exhausted as he returned to his ordinary state.</p>

  <p>The eruption of such incredible power caused his body to emit a ridiculous amount of heat. A piece of raw meat would be scorched instantly if put anywhere near him.</p>

  <p>The sand sized fragments slowly dissipated, gradually revealing the Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>Fuxi's eyes widened when he saw that he had come out of it unscathed.</p>

  <p>He was well aware that he was powerful and so he had held nothing back.</p>

  <p>He thought that even if he could not kill the Grandmaster of Heaven, he had certainly done enough to make him suffer.</p>

  <p>But the truth was far from what he had imagined.</p>

  <p>"Well," began the Grandmaster of Heaven, smiling ever so slightly, "in comparison to the rest, you may very well possess the most strength during the last several hundred chaotic eras. I think it's safe to say you're powerful enough to be the Son of Truth in the next round of chaos."</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately, there won't be a next round of chaos," he continued, shrugging his shoulders.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>He lifted his Cyan Misty Sword and countless cyan lights rained down on the Snake Goddess and Fuxi like a storm.</p>

  <p>They fell in straight lines and were so scattered that some of them were not aimed at them.</p>

  <p>But then, a small cube formed in the Grandmaster of Heaven's eye and those cyan lights changed their path and headed straight for Fuxi and the Snake Goddess.</p>

  <p>"Keep your distance from the lights!"</p>

  <p>With Luo Zheng in one hand and the other holding the Snake Goddess, Fuxi flew downward to avoid the cyan lights.</p>

  <p>They then refracted once more, turning and shooting at Fuxi.</p>

  <p>Unable to dodge, he lifted Luo Zheng and placed him on his head.</p>

  <p>Da! Da! Da!</p>

  <p>The cyan sword lights came down Luo Zheng's body like a dense rainfall. His body absorbed the sword lights' energy like a black hole and was left barely damaged.</p>

  <p>However, as he had already absorbed the cyan sword lights before, no new light column rose in the Eternal Divine Courtyard.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, the Grandmaster of Heaven frowned and shot more cyan sword lights, at the same time flashing the cube in his eye and refracting the cyan sword lights further to let them come at Fuxi from all directions.</p>

  <p>Fuxi spun Luo Zheng in his hands, rotating him like a wheel. He couldn't quite come up with a way to deal with the Grandmaster of Heaven. But with Luo Zheng as an invincible shield, he could defend himself rather well.</p>

  <p>Da! Da! Da!</p>

  <p>No matter how many times the cyan sword lights were refracted and no matter which angle they came from, Luo Zheng took them all.</p>

  <p>"It seems that you've gotten ahead of yourself, Grandmaster of Heaven,"</p>

  <p>Fuxi said, shrugging with a smile.</p>

  <p>They hadn't confirmed the Grandmaster of Heaven's identity until they had heard how Claire addressed him. They then had a rough idea of who he was.</p>

  <p>Even at an absolute disadvantage and on the defensive, Fuxi didn't panic.</p>

  <p>Instead, there was a shrewd smile across his face.</p>

  <p>Obviously, the Grandmaster of Heaven was as powerful as the Chaos Ancient Gods. He had possibly even slightly surpassed them. If Fuxi hoped to defeat such an opponent, he would have to remain on the defensive and wait patiently to exploit his few flaws once they were exposed.</p>

  <p>When Fuxi had finished speaking, his smile slowly retreated and his intense seriousness returned.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven stretched out his hand and a big purple hammer materialized in it. It was another of his powerful magic treasures, the Purple Lightening Hammer.</p>
