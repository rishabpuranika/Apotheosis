<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Cloud Sect arranged for this task of slaying demons on an annual basis.</p>

  <p>Humans and demons had fought with each other for generations. Since demons hadn't stepped into the Burning Sky Empire for many years because of the protection of the Burning Sky Palace and Cloud Sect, most disciples were not aware of the danger posed by demons.</p>

  <p>To train the disciples, it was necessary to teach them to bring their strength into play without being suppressed by the demon's evil spirit during a fight.</p>

  <p>Since such experience necessitated confronting a real demon, Cloud Sect allowed for the disciples to hunt demons in the Sky Forest. As with any fight, there was always a life and death situation. It truly sounded terrifying.</p>

  <p>But in fact, during the trial to chop the demon every year, it was rare for some disciples to die as only ordinary demon soldiers would be in Sky Forest to explore the way.</p>

  <p>A demon soldier was not powerful. At least, all the inner disciples who could pass the test and enter Sky Forest were able to fight against them.</p>

  <p>And the disciples of Lady Peak volunteered for the task this time as they had allied with the inner disciples from Blackrock Peak.</p>

  <p>The disciples of Blackrock Peak were willing to protect the female disciples of Lady Peak.</p>

  <p>Blackrock Peak was ranked second among the thirty-three peaks at Cloud Sect. Even if those who took the trial to chop the demon were not the most powerful at Blackrock Peak, their strength was sufficient for the task. Some of them were not highly ranked at Cloud Sect yet, but they were famous at Cloud Sect for their strength.</p>

  <p>But when they explored Sky Forest, a demon general mixed himself inside the group.</p>

  <p>"A demon general disguised himself and followed your group?" Zheng frowned and asked.</p>

  <p>Nina nodded, and sorrow was reflected on her face, "Yes. That demon general ate a disciple of Blackrock Peak and hid in his body. Later, he killed another one in a sneak attack. Other disciples of Blackrock Peak fought against them and protected us. They let us run away, but..."</p>

  <p>When she spoke, several female disciples lowered their heads as tears filled their eyes.</p>

  <p>When facing a demon general, the disciples were in an unfavorable position.</p>

  <p>The most powerful inner disciples who took this trial were grade 4 or 5 in the nature level. They couldn't be compared with a demon general, who was essentially more powerful.</p>

  <p>In this situation, it was very noble of the disciples from Blackrock Peak to sacrifice themselves so that the disciples of Lady Peak could escape.</p>

  <p>The camp was silent now. All the people were lost in thought. They fixed their eyes on the fire and gently shook their heads.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry. I will protect you this time!" Zheng suddenly smiled and broke the sadness.</p>

  <p>After Zheng finished speaking, surprise was reflected on the faces of the female disciples of Lady Peak. They stared at him in a daze.</p>

  <p>If Cleve from Drizzle Peak had said that, they wouldn't be surprised.</p>

  <p>But Zheng was only a half-step into the nature level, and not outstanding among the disciples from Drizzle Peak. However, they knew that Zheng had said that just to comfort them.</p>

  <p>Cleve saw that and said with a bitter smile, "We also met a demon general. Zheng killed it himself. Without him, all disciples of Drizzle Peak would probably have been killed."</p>

  <p>Many female disciples displayed a doubtful expression on the face after hearing Cleve's explanation.</p>

  <p>Nina looked Zheng up and down with her pretty eyes and smiled. She shook her head and stated, "I don't believe that!"</p>

  <p>"Nina, I don't believe it, either!" Another female disciple shared the same opinion as the leader from Lady Peak.</p>

  <p>Cleve smiled bitterly. If he hadn't witnessed Zheng's victory over the demon general, he wouldn't have believed that a warrior who was a half-step into the nature level could accomplish such a feat either.</p>

  <p>But, it was a fact even though the female disciples didn't believe that he had spoken the truth.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't deny or admit to killing the demon general. He had reassured the disciples from Lady Peak just to break the ice.</p>

  <p>A despairing soldier would surely be defeated. Anyone couldn't lose his courage at any time. As Zheng saw it, Nina must have more than one powerful hidden weapon with which to protect herself. If she didn't lack the courage, she would certainly have the chance to win against a demon general.</p>

  <p>As the night wore on, the thick crown of the spruce trees blocked the faint moonlight. It was dark in Sky Forest. Except for the light from the fire, the disciples couldn't see anything around them.</p>

  <p>Occasionally, a giant beast would skim past the camp, rustling leaves and branches of the foliage.</p>

  <p>Nina and other female disciples were exhausted after what had happened to them earlier that day. They leaned against each other and fell asleep.</p>

  <p>The disciples of Drizzle Peak took turns guarding the camp and taking some rest.</p>

  <p>The night seemed to drag on longer than usual. Not only was the disciple on guard filled with anxiety, but the ones who were sleeping couldn't rest well, either. Their nightmares would wake them.</p>

  <p>During their torment, the darkness of the night only served to make the disciples more despondent. However, the night went by without any further incidents.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't sleep the whole night. His soul had entered a realm that common people couldn't match. Even if he didn't rest for several days and nights, he would be in high spirits.</p>

  <p>He sat with his legs crossed and practiced the second move of the Heavenly Ogre Fist, which was called Swarm of Ogres Surging.</p>

  <p>When the sun rose the next morning, he was still sitting with his legs crossed. Zheng opened his eyes as demonic life energy spread slowly. After meditating the whole night, Zheng thought he had mastered more about Heavenly Ogre Fist.</p>
