<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3362 Large Races Gathered </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng's gaze swept around the spacious square, and landed at some giant figures standing on the left side of the area.</p>

  <p>"They are the Separate Abyss race," he muttered.</p>

  <p>He had previously seen the Separate Abyss race on the Other Shore several times.</p>

  <p>Although he wasn't able to see clearly how they looked back then on the Other Shore, the silhouettes of their Souls of Light showed the outline of their figures. Thus, he had recognized them in one glance.</p>

  <p>The members of the Separate Abyss race were all seventy to eighty feet tall, which made them look like small mountains when they stood there.</p>

  <p>Every single one of them wore a special layer of golden armor. Their big eyes emitted a strong malicious aura, that they even looked down on everything quite condescendingly as they gazed around.</p>

  <p>They were born with huge size and strong bodies. They were indeed superior to other races in terms of physical strength, which was why they were extremely arrogant.</p>

  <p>Not far from them were the Ear Mice who sat up straight on the ground.</p>

  <p>All of them wore masks and kept silent. They were much more low-key.</p>

  <p>Everyone else thought that the Ear Mice weren't that strong when it came to combat strength, but that was because they rarely had conflicts with other races. They preferred to use divine crystals and soul pills to solve everything.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, Zheng's observation of them on the Other Shore indicated that their combat strength shouldn't actually be underestimated.</p>

  <p>After all, all the best Other Shore Tokens were traded through their dealings--so the Other Shore Tokens they had merged with naturally couldn't be bad.</p>

  <p>Aside from those two races, there were also the Rain race, the Celestial Wolf race, the Purple Ape race, and so on.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, one could tell the strength of a certain race from the number of creatures they had.</p>

  <p>The stronger a race was, the higher authority they had, and the more tickets they could get.</p>

  <p>For example, there were more than five hundred warriors of the Separate Abyss race. They currently had the largest number of warriors present.</p>

  <p>Thus, they obviously obtained the highest number of tickets to the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the small races like the Celestial Wolf race and the Purple Ape race with about only twenty to thirty members, had a relatively weak overall strength.</p>

  <p>The average super forces could get more than two hundred tickets, but this time, only a total of more than one hundred and eighty warriors from the seven mountains of the Oneness Sky Palace had come. It meant that as of now, they were disadvantaged when it came to the distribution of tickets.</p>

  <p>Once Athemar had entered the square, he cupped his hands towards the large races. Then, he found a corner and instructed the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace to wait there.</p>

  <p>The disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace sat on the ground with their legs crossed. They looked around just like Zheng.</p>

  <p>Of course, they couldn't help it because the creatures present were their potential competitors.</p>

  <p>Not long after the disciples sat down, another whooshing sound came from the sky. dozens of flying ships flew across the clouds. One of them was so shockingly enormous that it looked like a floating city instead of a ship. In the center of this flying ship was a huge bear painted on the surface.</p>

  <p>"The warriors of the Bearing race have come," whispered the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>Hutton, Sally and the other Nine Li members had been silently following behind Zheng. When they saw the flying ship which was as huge as a city, their curious looks turned into trepidation.</p>

  <p>They had never seen the Bearing race in the real world. This was their first time to meet them.</p>

  <p>To be honest, they had already subconsciously regarded the Bearing race as a terrifying opponent. Now that they saw their grand entrance, they felt the fear and pressure rise in their hearts even more.</p>

  <p>The most affected one was Sally, who unknowingly squeezed in beside Zheng.</p>

  <p>When Zheng felt that Sally became a little nervous, his lips moved slightly and using his chaotic energy, he told her, "The Bearing race are also humans like us. Don't be afraid."</p>

  <p>"But they have killed so many of our Nine Li people," Sally answered through her life vitality.</p>

  <p>"Of course, blood will have blood. Fear can't solve anything," said Zheng.</p>

  <p>The journey of cultivation was like going through a single-log bridge. No matter how high one stood, they had to get rid of the fear from below-- otherwise, they would fall down and die.</p>

  <p>Therefore, it was very important to keep calm and have a strong belief in oneself.</p>

  <p>"But they are very powerful," Sally lamented.</p>

  <p>"You'll become more powerful one day," Zheng said with a smile.</p>

  <p>Sally bowed her head and thought for a while. Then, she looked up again and determination flashed faintly in her beautiful eyes.</p>

  <p>In fact, she was a very optimistic girl. It was just that the environment where she grew up in had always depicted the Bearing race as a horrible enemy.</p>

  <p>Now, Zheng also knew that it was hard for him to reduce the fear of the remaining members of the Nine Li race with only a few words. However, he only needed to prove that Bearing race were not invincible, and the fear in their hearts would be easily dissolved.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, the flying ships had descended and the members of the Bearing race flew over through the stone pillars.</p>

  <p>The warrior at the helm was an old man with a straight back. His eyes glinted fiercely and his every move indicated that he was vigorous and strong. He also cupped his hands towards the many large races, then led the members of the Bearing race to a corner.</p>

  <p>After the arrival of the Bearing race, the members of the Sun Crow race, New Moon race, and the Divine Farmer race all followed one after another.</p>

  <p>Over the years, the power of the human race, with the Bearing race as the leading force, had continued to expand.</p>

  <p>The human race, which had originally appeared to be the weaker ones, now had the tendency to surpass the other super races. If the few super powers of human race were to unite, their strength would probably surpass that of the Separate Abyss race.</p>

  <p>The Sun Crow race's leader was Elizabeth.</p>

  <p>She sauntered towards the front, her slender waist swaying lithely as she did so. A pure, golden pair of wings fluttered gently behind her back and overall, she exuded a breathtaking charm.</p>

  <p>All the creatures present focused their eyes on her.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the sight of Elizabeth caused Zheng to frown a little.</p>

  <p>This woman's Illusory Projection had almost killed him back when he was in the Mountain Viewing Province. He didn't expect to meet her again this time.</p>

  <p>However, they were at the entrance of the Chaotic Source World, and he had nothing to fear since he had the elders like Athemar to protect him.</p>

  <p>After Elizabeth had walked around the square once, she walked towards them with a cold smile on her face.</p>

  <p>This prompted Athemar to step forward and stand in front of the disciples.</p>

  <p>He cupped his hands towards Elizabeth and said, "Master Elizabeth, I wonder what you came here for."</p>

  <p>Elizabeth's gaze landed on Elvinia, and with a smile she spoke, "Nothing. I just want to see the traitor of our Sun Crow race. She will actually accept the Chaotic Source Reinforcement today. How time flies."</p>

  <p>Elvinia's face darkened upon hearing those words. She stood up and hissed,</p>

  <p>"Dare you say it again!"</p>

  <p>The years Elvinia had spent in the Divine Lair were nightmares that she would never want to look back all her life, but Elizabeth actually took the initiative to provoke her. Naturally, she was furious.</p>

  <p>"Elizabeth, watch your mouth!" Athemar warned. He too, was displeased.</p>

  <p>All of them gathered for one purpose: to enter the Chaotic Source World, and not to stir up trouble.</p>

  <p>Still, Elizabeth ignored him and continued, "I didn't say anything wrong.</p>

  <p>Your mother is a traitor, and you are a traitor as well. It's fine if you continue to hide in the Oneness Sky Palace like your mother. Since you dared to come to the Chaotic Source World, you must be mentally prepared for the fact that you might not be able to come back."</p>

  <p>The light in Elvinia's eyes dimmed further. Just as she was about to retort, Zheng suddenly stopped her and said, "There is no need to be so worked up on these birds."</p>

  <p>Elizabeth hadn't noticed Zheng at first. As soon as she saw Zheng, she remembered that moment in the Mountain Viewing Province. Her face suddenly turned sour. "It's you?!"</p>

  <p>She had performed the Illusory Projection several times to kill Zheng but he had successfully escaped each time, so he left a deep impression on her.</p>

  <p>At that time, however, Zheng had only recently stepped onto the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Therefore, she was surprised that he would now be able to accept Chaotic Source Reinforcement after just a short amount of time.</p>
