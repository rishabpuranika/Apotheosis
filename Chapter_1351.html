<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1351 Beg Me And I'll Stop Talking </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng told her what happened after she fell asleep, he barely had enough time to go into detail. As he first explained what unfolded, the Roaring Token was missing from his narration.</p>

  <p>But Xun was someone Luo Zheng trusted absolutely— he had no need to hide anything from her.</p>

  <p>Of course, Xun was rather taken aback to have heard that Luo Zheng was in possession of a Roaring Token.</p>

  <p>But even the Roaring Token wasn't something all too precious in Xun's eyes.</p>

  <p>She was the queen of Demon Night, after all. Although she wasn't the strongest, she was still the Demon Night's spiritual totem— even the Supreme Lords had to bow before the three queens.</p>

  <p>In the past, she had over three hundred Roaring Tokens, much more than what many Supreme Lords possessed.</p>

  <p>Even though it wasn't much to her, a single Roaring Token was already extremely valuable to ordinary warriors or Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was someone Xun believed to know very well. While it certainly wasn't difficult for him to earn life vitality crystals, it wasn't too long ago when he ascended to the Upper World. A Roaring Token was worth a year's expense of a tenth-grade sacred place— how could Luo Zheng have possibly obtained one?</p>

  <p>"Did Yolande give it to you?" Xun asked after a moment of thought.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng only shook his head. "No, it's mine." With that, he handed her the token and said, "Feel free to use it. I'm not fit to speak…"</p>

  <p>"What? Why?" Xun asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"You'll know in a while," Luo Zheng said with a smile as he shook his head.</p>

  <p>The fact that Luo Zheng had used the Roaring Token to curse Supreme Lords had escaped Xun. He even had used it to count the numbers merely to kill time— most people should have remembered his voice.</p>

  <p>But there were tens of millions of creatures in the universe— any two people could easily have similar voices.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng were to use the Roaring Token at this moment, it was likely that Yao would suspect him. With that, he decided to let Xun speak for herself.</p>

  <p>Under Xun's odd gaze, Luo Zheng helped her activate the Roaring Token.</p>

  <p>She coldly said through Roaring Token, "Yao, who said that I don't have a Roaring Token? I want to see how long you can keep being so arrogant, you bitch! I, Xun, as the Queen of Killings of the Demon Night, will forever be queen. I will not die so long as the Demon Night race exists. And, I will definitely remove you from the throne!"</p>

  <p>The sound of her voice rang through the entire supreme worlds through the Roaring Token.</p>

  <p>Since she thought she only had one token, it was her only chance at speaking to the entire supreme worlds— she had to make the most of it.</p>

  <p>"Xun, you really came back! Where are you?" In an instant, Supreme Lord Leroy's voice came through.</p>

  <p>Queen of Punishment Yao's voice followed closely behind Supreme Lord Leroy's voice, "Huh, you little bitch! You actually managed to get a Roaring Token…it seems I've underestimated you. Hmph! Since you're already in the Upper World, prepare to die at any time!"</p>

  <p>When Xun heard Yao's words, her expression turned cold.</p>

  <p>Thinking that the Roaring Token in her hand had already been used and that she wouldn't be able to respond to Yao, she had no intention of responding.</p>

  <p>But the token in her hand seemed to still be intact.</p>

  <p>"This Roaring Token hasn't shattered. What's going on?" Xun was utterly bewildered.</p>

  <p>Normally, when the Roaring Token was used, the Law of Causality inside it would be activated, spreading the sound throughout the universe. After that, the entire Roaring Token would dissolve into a pile of dust. But the token in her hand was still intact.</p>

  <p>With a smile, Luo Zheng stretched out his hand to activate the token once again.</p>

  <p>"You can continue and curse her freely, now!"</p>

  <p>"Ah!" in her astonishment, Xun couldn't help but cry out.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Zheng had activated the Roaring Token, the scream of surprise resounded throughout the entire universe…</p>

  <p>At that moment, Supreme Lord Leroy, Yao, and the other members of the Demon Night all put on a strange expression.</p>

  <p>What was going on? Did Xun have more than one Roaring Token up her sleeve?</p>

  <p>Given Xun's current condition, it was unlikely that she would waste the Roaring Token this way.</p>

  <p>Looking at the token in her hand, Xun was stunned still for a moment before recovering her senses. "Luo Zheng! Your Roaring Token…"</p>

  <p>"You can use it as many times as you want…there's no limit to its uses."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng merely shrugged his shoulders and lightly laughed.</p>

  <p>"Ahh…"</p>

  <p>Xun screamed once more.</p>

  <p>When the cyan dragon found out the specialty about the Roaring Token, he was also rather shocked. While Xun had a similar reaction, her expression was rather exaggerated.</p>

  <p>Zheng's words frightened her. She was well aware of what it meant to have a Roaring Token that could be used limitless times.</p>

  <p>Of course, Xun had high expectations for Luo Zheng. So long as he was given enough room to grow, one day, he would be able to stand at the highest point of the universe and look down upon it.</p>

  <p>But never did Xun expect that Luo Zheng would actually obtain such an incredible thing right after he ascended— she almost couldn't believe her own eyes.</p>

  <p>Zheng's mouth curled into a smile. Normally, Xun maintained a nonchalant expression as if there was nothing in the world worthy of her surprise— this was mainly because her status was too high. But the fact that she was greatly astounded couldn't be denied. Luo Zheng was rather proud that he managed to surprise this supreme queen.</p>

  <p>Without bothering to answer Supreme Lord Leroy's question or talk back to Yao, Xun held the Roaring Token in her hand and carefully examined it. After a long moment, she sneered and said, "Good. Finally, I can freely scold this slut in front of everyone in the universe!"</p>

  <p>"Haha! Xun, you little slut… it seems that you've gone insane. You only have two Roaring Tokens in your hands, don't you? Or are you having fun with some man? No wonder you released such a scream!"</p>

  <p>Yao coldly said.</p>

  <p>Xun's expression turned cold. "Help me activate the Roaring Token!"</p>

  <p>With a wave of his hand, Luo Zheng activated the Roaring Token for Xun…</p>

  <p>"Bitch, I don't only have two Roaring Tokens. You're the one who should watch out…you'd better save your nonsense. I'm sure it must hurt for you to use one…but I can waste as many Roaring Tokens as I like. So what?"</p>

  <p>Xun said with a cold voice.</p>

  <p>Before Yao could respond, Xun continued, "I want to announce to the members of the Demon Night that this slut isn't suitable for the position of the Queen of Punishment. Back then…"</p>

  <p>"..."</p>

  <p>"..."</p>

  <p>Xun's every remark resounded loud and clear throughout the universe.</p>

  <p>Most of it was to insult Yao, with the occasional response to Supreme Lord Leroy.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, Yao used the Roaring Token to refute Xun's curse, but the number of Roaring Tokens in Yao's hand was limited.</p>

  <p>After using over a hundred Roaring Tokens, she looked at the mere dozens of tokens in her space ring. Suddenly, she felt powerless.</p>

  <p>Just where did Xun get so many Roaring Tokens?</p>

  <p>The spitballing of words lasted for two hours, four hours, six hours…</p>

  <p>Still, Xun didn't feel tired, so she continued using the Roaring Token to bombarding Yao's ears.</p>

  <p>In the depths of the Mist Palace, Yolande was still enjoying her bath. The moment she heard the sound, the corners of her mouth tugged up. She couldn't help but shake her head, 'This Luo Zheng is truly vicious…'</p>

  <p>As for the Supreme Lords of the other races, they could only keep their mouths shut.</p>

  <p>The argument between the two queens of the Demon Night had nothing to do with them, but many races were rather entertained to see the scene.</p>

  <p>Although the Demon Night race wasn't high in number and they didn't occupy that many supreme worlds, they were an extremely powerful race. The more intense their internal strife was, the smugger the other races could be.</p>

  <p>But all the other races also found it rather strange— wasn't the Queen of Killings close to demise? Where on earth did she get so many Roaring Tokens? Why did it feel like the Roaring Tokens kept losing their worth?</p>

  <p>At first, the mysterious woman appeared, followed by another mysterious youth. And now, it was the Queen of Killings of the Demon Night who squandered the Roaring Tokens. Just how did they obtain so many of them?</p>

  <p>And now, Yao seemed like she was going crazy.</p>

  <p>In the middle of it all, Yao already regretted that she had started the verbal war with Xun— the latter seemed to have endless Roaring Tokens.</p>

  <p>In the hall, Yao covered her ears, desperately trying to stop the voice from reaching her ears. But the sound of the token was impossible to avoid— it was pouring directly into her mind.</p>

  <p>"Enough!"</p>

  <p>Shouting as loud as she could, Yao activated a Roaring Token.</p>

  <p>"Enough? Beg me! Beg me and I'll stop talking," Xun returned coldly.</p>

  <p>"You're a wisp of soul at its last breath. Do you really think you deserve me begging you? You must be dreaming!" Yao replied resolutely. How could she go and beg for Xun's mercy in front of the entire Demon Night race?</p>

  <p>"Then… I'll go on," Xun's voice resounded.</p>
