<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Seven people stood at the gate of the Sacred Mallow Temple, while another team gathered on the side of a cliff.</p>

  <p>They, however, seemed to be waiting for something, making no intentions of entering the temple.</p>

  <p>The group looked animated upon seeing Zheng, Hammer and their group.</p>

  <p>Dorothy knew these people's purpose immediately. She smiled faintly and murmured, "It seems like they want to take advantage of you."</p>

  <p>"Poor wretches..." Hammer grumbled to himself.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore Key of Stage One was precious for most people, despite being easy to obtain.</p>

  <p>Right now though, none of them had the Other Shore Key. All they could do was wait patiently outside the temple.</p>

  <p>As soon as the door opened, there followed a window of time in which it wouldn't close. By then, only particularly powerful forces would be able to stop them.</p>

  <p>"After it opens, how long would it take before it closes?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Every temple is different. The Sacred Mallow Temple, for example, will stay open for about an hour," Hammer replied.</p>

  <p>When the Souls of Light first came to the Other Shore, the first temple they encountered was the Sacred Mallow Temple, so it had been visited frequently, with most of the treasures inside already taken away.</p>

  <p>"Let's go over there," Dorothy said, pointing towards the temple entrance.</p>

  <p>Over ten people on the cliff followed as they walked towards the temple. As they neared, the seven who blocked the entrance parted, making way.</p>

  <p>One of them chuckled and said, "I've been waiting here for half a month.</p>

  <p>Finally, you guys come to open the door."</p>

  <p>Hammer ignored the remark and walked straight to the temple's gate.</p>

  <p>On the right side of the door was a small square that sported unusual patterns. As Hammer slapped it with his palm, the door frame began to glow faintly.</p>

  <p>"Ahahah..."</p>

  <p>The temple door gradually vanished as the light shone brighter.</p>

  <p>"The door's open!"</p>

  <p>"Let's go!"</p>

  <p>The group that was blocking the door earlier entered in a frenzy, completely oblivious of Hammer who stood still.</p>

  <p>Zheng couldn't see Hammer's face, but he imagined a scowl forming.</p>

  <p>"Am I too kind? Should I teach them a lesson?" Hammer sneered.</p>

  <p>Hammer was one of the three pioneers during the process of approaching the Other Shore this time. He had been in the Sea of Truth for many years, amassing much more experience and strength than ordinary people.</p>

  <p>Even Zheng felt vaguely threatened by the soul aura emanating from him out of anger.</p>

  <p>"Just ignore these reckless idiots, Hammer. They will die inside anyway,"</p>

  <p>Harding said as he tried to comfort his brother.</p>

  <p>Hammer closed his eyes and took a long breath. Although he was still glaring, he quietly joined the other four as they entered the temple.</p>

  <p>As soon as he entered the temple, Zheng felt a suppressed aura harboring strong energy.</p>

  <p>"Since the temple is built with objects from the Other Shore, can we use the bricks and stones as Other Shore Tokens?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Dorothy laughed, her voice low. "The temple seems uncharacteristically spotless inside and out, don't you think?"</p>

  <p>The temple itself was dilapidated, but Dorothy was right. As Zheng scanned his surroundings, he could see no broken thing.</p>

  <p>"We can certainly use the bricks and stones here as Other Shore Tokens, but our Souls of Light will have quite the trouble destroying them," Dorothy answered as she shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Then why is the temple in such a dilapidated condition?" Zheng inquired further.</p>

  <p>Dorothy blinked and replied, "It can't be destroyed now, but it doesn't mean that proved true in the past. You know, people could cross the Sea of Truth with their bodies long ago."</p>

  <p>It was a common practice in the past. Since the truths in the chaos had changed, however, nobody was able to do such a thing again.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing the story, Zheng seemed to have figured something out. "If we break off the bricks and stones here..."</p>

  <p>"We can sell them at a good price," Dorothy finished.</p>

  <p>The two of them shared suggestive smirks.</p>

  <p>The three who were walking in front of them looked at one another in confusion. If anything, breaking off the temple bricks and stones seemed more like wishful thinking.</p>

  <p>The Origin Mountain thought highly of Zheng, but unlike others, it was not his talent of Instant Enlightenment that caught their eyes. Instead, it was the possibilities he could do by having his body on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Navigating the inner part of the temple was complicated business. The five of them had to avoid not only the many places that had collapsed, but large gaping holes that were everywhere as well.</p>

  <p>Zheng took note of thousands of strange statues he passed by along the way.</p>

  <p>They were neither statues of humans nor of any other beasts he had encountered. They had eyes, but no other feature suggested they had appeared in this era.</p>

  <p>'What race built this temple?' Zheng thought to himself.</p>

  <p>At this moment, a voice from up front claimed excitedly, "Look! The Heavenly Cobweb! We seem to be very fortunate!"</p>

  <p>"The Heavenly Cobweb?" Hammer's face darkened as the three of them quickly strode forward.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Cobweb was one of the most impressive Other Shore Tokens of Stage One. More importantly, it was hard to come by.</p>

  <p>Hammer couldn't let the first few men get it.</p>

  <p>A fine cobweb hung on a corner. The seven people who scurried past Hammer earlier stood beneath it in amazement.</p>

  <p>"We opened the Sacred Mallow Temple! This Other Shore Token should belong to us. Don't claim it for yourselves!" Hammer and his two brothers silently climbed up the stairs, stopping at the narrow corridor.</p>

  <p>"Who do you think you are?" one of the group sneered. "The temple is open for everyone. We grab the treasures by our abilities. What we find belongs to us!" Obviously, they didn't plan to surrender.</p>

  <p>Countless visitors had taken many of the treasures inside the Sacred Mallow Temple. The Heavenly Cobweb was rare enough that no one wanted to give up easily.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>A tense atmosphere pervaded the temple as everyone released their soul auras. They glared at each other with hostility, signaling the start of a battle of the Souls of Light.</p>

  <p>Just then, the third team arrived and immediately saw the Heavenly Cobweb. Naturally, they knew of its rarity and wanted to grab it as well.</p>

  <p>Warriors fighting each other for Other Shore Tokens was a common occurrence.</p>

  <p>"Are we going to help them?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Hammer and his brothers had invited Zheng and Dorothy to the temple, so it was only right that they helped.</p>

  <p>Dorothy hesitated. She said, "The Heavenly Cobweb is made by the Heavenly Spider. But the Heavenly Spider shouldn't have appeared on the first floor."</p>

  <p>Just as she said this, a snow-white spider thread started falling near the temple's entrance.</p>

  <p>It wound around the statues on both sides of the entrance. As the thread twisted them, the statues' heads rotated left and right.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, the eyes of all the statues inside the temple glowed white.</p>
