<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was not interested in the internal strife within the divine kingdom.</p>

  <p>He only cared about getting the Harlen Token.</p>

  <p>After passing the test today, the warriors had to return to the courtyard they had previously registered in. After passing the test, Luo Zheng had become a member of the Jade Martial House.</p>

  <p>The woman at the Internal Elixir Realm who was in charge of registration looked curiously at Luo Zheng. She wondered how Luo Zheng passed the test given that his cultivation was only at the middle stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm.</p>

  <p>The woman took Zheng's bamboo token back and gave him another purple token. This purple token was still not the Harlen Token. She informed him that from now on he was allowed to enter the Jade Martial House to study and practice, as well as to obtain a portion of the resources of the Jade Martial House.</p>

  <p>Other independent martial artists would be honored and excited at the chance to have access to the Jade Martial House's materials and training facilities. The cultivation for independent warriors was extremely arduous, so it was a great opportunity for them to join a martial house to advance further. Luo Zheng, however, was not interested in studying nor using the resources of the Jade Martial House. Luo Zheng didn't lack cultivation techniques or pills. He had completely relied on himself to improve his cultivation and, as of now, the martial house would not be of much help to him. The only thing that could help him was the Harlen Token.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng left the Jade Martial House and met Francis who had been waiting outside for a while.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had given him an order beforehand, telling him to wait there for him so that they would return to his residence together. Francis did as he was told. He didn't dare disobey Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Along the way, Luo Zheng played with the purple token in his hand. After thinking for a while, he asked, "How long do you think it will take me to get the Harlen Token and enter the Feather Holy Sea?"</p>

  <p>Francis smiled and replied, "One of the three secret lands will open every year but I'm not sure which one will open this year."</p>

  <p>The Feather Holy Sea contained the Feather Emperor Secret Land, the Divine Emperor Secret Land, the Mysterious Dream Secret Land, and the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land. Except for Feather Emperor Secret Land, Luo Zheng didn't care about any other secret lands. He was expecting the Feather Emperor Secret Land to open this year, or else it would be extremely disappointing.</p>

  <p>"Is there a way to know which secret land will open this year?" Luo Zheng asked with a frown.</p>

  <p>"I guess so, but the opening of a secret land is controlled by the rulers of the four divine kingdoms. It is up to them to decide which secret land will open. I don't know if it is possible to approach the rulers and ask them about this. I believe it will be a little difficult to get this information," Francis replied.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng took a deep breath. If the Feather Emperor Secret Land didn't open this year, he would have to wait for another year. He couldn't wait that long. He didn't have much time left. What should he do? Luo Zheng was not strong enough to influence the decisions of the rulers of the four divine kingdoms.</p>

  <p>"I see. You can leave now," Luo Zheng told Francis.</p>

  <p>He nodded and left the room.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng sat cross-legged and slowly directed his strength to spread out his life vitality. He was prepared to cultivate for a while.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon in his mind began to speak, "Luo Zheng, aside from the Feather Emperor Secret Land in the Feather Holy Sea, there is another secret land you must enter."</p>

  <p>"Hmm?" Zheng's eyes flickered. He was confused with this new information coming from the cyan dragon.</p>

  <p>Everything he knew about the Feather Holy Sea and the secret lands had come from Francis. It was the first time the cyan dragon mentioned them. Could these secret lands and the cyan dragon be somehow related?</p>

  <p>Zheng's goal was to get to the Feather Emperor Secret Land where the life stones came from. He wasn't interested in the other secret lands.</p>

  <p>"There are the Feather Emperor Secret Land, the Divine Emperor Secret Land, the Mysterious Dream Secret Land, and there's also the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land, right? You must enter the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land," the cyan dragon continued to say.</p>

  <p>"Is there something you need from the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng knew that the nine Genuine Dragons came from the Genuine Dragon World. What he didn't know was why these nine dragons attached themselves to the mysterious furnace and why they had turned into a page of a book and got into Zheng's mind. These were mysteries he was eager to solve.</p>

  <p>Once he asked the cyan dragon but he avoided the questions and instead gave him a vague answer. There was a secret around this and Luo Zheng needed to know what it was.</p>

  <p>Back when Luo Zheng first entered the Genuine Dragon World through the Dragon Soar Arena, the cyan dragon had acted all mysterious and didn't want to reveal his identity to the martial artists of the Dragon Lineage Human.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng started wondering if the cyan dragon held a grudge against the Genuine Dragon race, or if there was a great enmity between them.</p>

  <p>These were only his wild guesses. If the cyan dragon didn't want to reveal his secrets, then Luo Zheng shouldn't insist.</p>

  <p>Even when Luo Zheng entered the Sea God Continent and practiced the martial arts there, the cyan dragon hadn't offered his opinions or made any requests. This time, however, he was asking Luo Zheng to enter the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land. So there must be something important there or something he needed. Could it be related to the nine dragons?</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon smiled bitterly and said, "Have you heard the story about the origins of the Feather Holy Sea?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shook his head.</p>

  <p>He hadn't even heard of the name Feather Holy Sea, not until recently when Francis told him in return for Luo Zheng sparing his life.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng traveled across the Chaotic Ocean of Stars and arrived in the Harlen Divine Kingdom, he was surprised to know there was a vast inland sea in the continent surrounded by gigantic towering city walls.</p>

  <p>He wondered why the four divine kingdoms had put so much effort into accomplishing such a huge project. What did they do it for? What was the purpose of this construction?</p>

  <p>"The Feather Holy Sea used to be ours. It was the territory of our Genuine Dragon race," the cyan dragon said with a hint of sadness.</p>

  <p>"Your Genuine Dragon race's territory?" Zheng's eyebrows twitched as he asked with a soft voice as if feeling the cyan dragon's sadness.</p>

  <p>"To be more precise, this territory belonged to a branch race of our Genuine Dragon race, that is the Dragon Lineage Human," the cyan dragon said.</p>

  <p>In the past, the Dragon Lineage Human were the rulers of this continent.</p>

  <p>They occupied the most central region of the entire Divine Kingdom Continent� the Feather Holy Sea. At that time humans had seven divine kingdoms.</p>

  <p>These divine kingdoms joined forces and fought against the Dragon Lineage Human.</p>

  <p>This war went on for tens of thousands of years. It was a horrific war taking the lives of millions.</p>

  <p>Finally, under the relentless joined attacks of the seven divine kingdoms, the Dragon Lineage Human used a blood sacrifice to open up a space channel. From this space channel came a Genuine Dragon that annihilated three divine kingdoms with a single blow.</p>

  <p>At that time, the seven divine kingdoms had the support of the human race from the Upper World. The four divine kingdoms that survived in the end had destroyed the entire Dragon Lineage Human. So now the continent was ruled by the four divine kingdoms. The blood sacrifice had come at a great cost and didn't help the Dragon Lineage Human to achieve their final victory.</p>

  <p>"The four secret lands are, in truth, the remnants of the Dragon Lineage Human's legacy in this world. Before the members of the Dragon Lineage Human were exterminated, they used the power of blood sacrifice once again to seal off the entire Feather Holy Sea with the cost of the lives of the entire race. They wouldn't allow the inheritance of the entire Dragon Lineage Human to be exterminated," the cyan dragon added.</p>

  <p>"Now, after so many years, the power of the Dragon Lineage Human's blood sacrifice has begun to weaken. The four remaining divine kingdoms took the legacies of the Dragon Lineage Human as their own treasures and have slowly developed into the powerhouses they are today. I never thought that some small sixth-grade divine kingdoms would develop so much and so quickly."</p>

  <p>In the past, the seven divine kingdoms were considered sixth-grade sects but now the four divine kingdoms could be considered eighth-grade sects.</p>

  <p>It was a huge difference and upgrade even with just two grades in between.</p>

  <p>The Demon Night sacred place located in the Sea God Continent with Amber as the leader could only be considered a seventh grade sacred place.</p>

  <p>"What exactly is in the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land?" Luo Zheng asked curiously. He was wondering what the cyan dragon was looking for and why he wouldn't just tell him once and for all.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon answered, "In the past, the Dragon Lineage Human of the Lower World summoned a Genuine Dragon through blood sacrifice.</p>

  <p>That Genuine Dragon is our eldest brother."</p>

  <p>"Eldest brother?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was shocked at the revelation.</p>

  <p>There were nine Genuine Dragons drawn on the mysterious furnace.</p>

  <p>These nine Genuine Dragons were of different sizes and lengths, and had different powers. But underneath the furnace lay the strongest and most intimidating Genuine Dragon. He had been asleep all this time and until now only the cyan dragon and red dragon had awaken.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Our Genuine Dragon race spread throughout a million worlds. Not everyone could use the blood sacrifice and successfully summon a Genuine Dragon to come for help. The reason why my eldest brother personally answered the call was because the Dragon Lineage Human had discovered an Ancestral Dragon Egg in their world. This Ancestral Dragon Egg is currently in the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land of the Feather Holy Sea!" the cyan dragon finally revealed what he was looking for.</p>

  <p>"An Ancestral Dragon Egg? What is that?" Luo Zheng felt confused and astonished at the cyan dragon's words. He had never heard of the Ancestral Dragon Egg before.</p>

  <p>The red dragon laughed. "It's very simple to understand. The Ancestral Dragon Egg is the egg of the Ancestral Dragon. There is only one Ancestral Dragon in this world and it is immortal. After it dies, a new Ancestral Dragon Egg will be born and then it will hatch and the dragon inside will become the new Ancestral Dragon."</p>
