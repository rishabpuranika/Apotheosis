<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1035 The Situation Reversed </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Everyone was paying close attention to Eddie's movements. So when he spoke, his words broke the hearts of the warriors of Oracle City.</p>

  <p>They realized that Eddie must have found where Luo Zheng was hiding.</p>

  <p>And this meant that their last sliver of hope would be shattered to bits.</p>

  <p>Eddie didn't hesitate. He took a step forward, making his fist radiance shine, and as he threw this powerful punch, it hit the space node with a resounding bang.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Eddie's face contorted as his fist hit the space node.</p>

  <p>A sharp sword suddenly emerged from the space node, instantly shattering Eddie's fist radiance and directly stabbing his fist.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had a top-grade sacred weapon in his hand. Even though Eddie's fist was covered with a layer of solid black scales, it wasn't enough to block the sacred weapon's attack.</p>

  <p>The long sword followed its path through Eddie's fist and pierced his arm.</p>

  <p>A huge force emanated from the sword, pushing Eddie backwards.</p>

  <p>The long sword emerged from the space node, followed by Zheng's right hand that held it, and then his entire body.</p>

  <p>Since the nerves of the fingertips are linked with the heart, piercing his fingers left Eddie with a painful expression on his charred face.</p>

  <p>Tianming's sword had cut off his other hand, making it impossible for him to pull out the sword assaulting his hand. All he could do right now was keep retreating.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did not give Eddie a chance to shake the sword off; he firmly held onto the sharp sword and pushed forward. He wanted to use the sword to nail Eddie to the city wall.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning was carrying Ning Yudie as she followed Luo Zheng out of the space node.</p>

  <p>"It's Luo Zheng! He is not dead!"</p>

  <p>"I told you so! He has been always lucky. No matter how dangerous the situation is, he can still escape. I really don't know how he recovered this time. It looks like he wasn't hurt at all!"</p>

  <p>"The leader of the Cloud Hall is still lying immobile on the ground. Is she dead?"</p>

  <p>A sudden furor of discussion began among the warriors on the walls of Oracle City.</p>

  <p>They'd been in despair because they thought that there was no one in the Central Region who could fight Eddie.</p>

  <p>Zheng's Double Star Brilliance had previously completely convinced them that he was the only one who could come even close to fighting Eddie.</p>

  <p>And now, Luo Zheng had returned, full of vigor and vitality, looking like he hadn't sustained any injuries at all.</p>

  <p>"Kill Eddie, Luo Zheng! Go for it!"</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, we support you!"</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, I support you! Mentally!" Lewis shouted at the top of his lungs.</p>

  <p>Patrick smiled helplessly at this. Tianming had fainted, thankfully, or he would have taught Lewis a little lesson or two.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and Eddie charged towards the city wall; they were separated by a long sword, its upper half still nailed to Eddie's arm. Eddie's blood continued to spill as they ran.</p>

  <p>"You're lucky that even the Life and Death Wind can't kill you!" Eddie said coldly.</p>

  <p>Even he didn't have complete control over the Life and Death Wind.</p>

  <p>However, today's battle was not only related to the fate of the Cloud Hall and the World Commercial Alliance, but also was crucial in deciding the fate of Eddie and the Heavenly Evil Sect. That was exactly why he had decided to use the Life and Death Wind to deal with Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Eddie had never heard of the Law of Causality, so he couldn't figure out how the Life and Death Wind killed his opponents. He only knew that any creature that the Life and Death Wind blew at, would die instantly. And there was absolutely no doubt or exception to this. Even the strongest creatures would avoid the Life and Death Wind since they didn't want to be killed.</p>

  <p>Eddie had been trying his best to find the space node because he knew that Luo Zheng had always been lucky, and Eddie couldn't be at ease if he did not see Luo Zheng die with his own eyes.</p>

  <p>He had believed Luo Zheng to be dead.</p>

  <p>But the result was completely unexpected. It looked like the Life and Death Wind hadn't done any harm to Luo Zheng. Eddie was greatly shocked to see Luo Zheng looking so energetic. He pretended to be calm, not wanting his opponent to see through him.</p>

  <p>'What kind of weirdo is Luo Zheng? Looks like I can't kill him, no matter how hard I try!' he thought.</p>

  <p>He felt a sense of helplessness rising up within him. He had been an independent warrior when he started cultivation and now that he had risen to establish a divine kingdom. His warrior spirit had become firm as a rock.</p>

  <p>He was cold-blooded, cruel, decisive, and determined. He would not give up until he had reached his goal.</p>

  <p>But as he faced Luo Zheng, he realized all of a sudden that he had lost all confidence.</p>

  <p>In a fight between two warriors, especially those with similar strength, the decisive factor was more often than not their willpower. As the saying went,</p>

  <p>"The braver one will win in an inevitable confrontation." Warriors needed to believe in themselves. Strongly.</p>

  <p>When Eddie had chased Luo Zheng, it had affected Zheng's warrior spirit. Ning Yudie had used the icy Mu Ning to calm him down. And he had quickly recovered under her consolation and encouragement. But now, who was there to help Eddie?</p>

  <p>Eddie had made sure to master many methods to deal with Luo Zheng. But even though the Life and Death Wind was the enemy of all creatures, it had failed to harm Luo Zheng, even in the smallest of ways.</p>

  <p>Right now, no matter what path his mind took, Eddie couldn't figure out a way to kill Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng's perception was quite sensitive.</p>

  <p>A trace of sadness flashed across Eddie's eyes, something that Luo Zheng easily comprehended.</p>

  <p>Eddie was Zheng's biggest rival, and one that Luo Zheng had to kill. If Eddie revealed any flaws, even unintentionally, Luo Zheng would grab at them with both hands.</p>

  <p>Now that Eddie's warrior spirit was affected, Luo Zheng would definitely not let the opportunity go.</p>

  <p>"Kill me? Eddie, you are not qualified!" Luo Zheng sneered.</p>

  <p>"Is that so? You are just a warrior at the Virtual Tribulation Realm. You think I can't kill you?" Eddie was not a fool. He was quickly correcting his state of mind as he spoke.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng was unfazed. He quickly said, "Yes! You're too arrogant. You want to establish a divine kingdom and ascend to the throne. But don't you know? Whether a sacred place or a divine kingdom, you need to have a few warriors at the Soul Sea Realm. You haven't reached the Soul Sea Realm yet. How are you going to rule your divine kingdom? With your talent?"</p>

  <p>In order to establish a divine kingdom or a sacred place, a few warriors at the Soul Sea Realm were a must. For instance, although the Purple Heart Sacred Place was one of the lowest ranked sacred places on the Sea God Continent, it still had three warriors at the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>And if the whole of the Central Region became united, they could establish a divine kingdom. But Eddie simply wasn't qualified enough to be the emperor of it.</p>

  <p>As long as a divine-level talent didn't die, he or she could steadily enter the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>Divine-level talents were not rare on the Sea God Continent, but in the Central Region, they were very rare. In recent years, a few divine-level talents like Eden and Brent had appeared in the Central Region.</p>

  <p>Eddie's talent couldn't be ranked as divine level. He could only be a heaven-level talent at most.</p>

  <p>It was possible for a heaven-level talent to enter the Soul Sea Realm, but the difficulty would be much higher. His own talent had always been a pain in the ass for Eddie. When he first found out that his son was a divine-level talent, he had naturally nurtured him with great care.</p>

  <p>"Talent doesn't matter at all. I don't give a damn about it. Once my Lustful Demon Array is set up, I will� " As Eddie spoke, Zheng's hand turned and the tip of the sword twisted accordingly inside Eddie's arm, causing his face to pale.</p>

  <p>"There's no chance for that. I've said it before. You dared to take Yan away, which is why you must die." Luo Zheng had barely finished talking when the two of them crashed into the wall.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>A large part of Oracle City's wall had already collapsed, and this collision smashed another great hole within it. Pieces of brick fell off one after another.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng pulled the sword out of Eddie's arm at the moment of impact and stabbed it into his chest.</p>

  <p>Now that one of Eddie's hands had been cut off and the other shattered by Zheng's top-grade sacred weapon, he completely lost his ability to fight back.</p>

  <p>His only option as he faced Zheng's sword was to retreat. So he chose to run through the gates and into the city, gathering speed as he ran.</p>

  <p>The city wall was made up of a variety of huge rocks and beams. As Eddie bumped into the wall as he ran, these rocks and beams began to collapse in the direction that he was fleeing in.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did not hesitate. The sword intent in his hand spiraled upwards and reduced the nearby beams and rocks to dust. He chased Eddie down the entire way.</p>
