<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 123 Jesse Liu (Part Two) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>If Drizzle Peak was defeated, it might affect the mood of its outer disciples for a short time. However, it would also help them to understand that they must work harder to catch up.</p>

  <p>To achieve this, the disciples needed to understand, through personal experience, that only the weak could be beaten. That was why Master Su accepted the challenge.</p>

  <p>Master Su's mouth crumpled as she looked at Luo Zheng. "This outer disciple accepted the task of killing blade locusts in the south and then left Drizzle Peak. I didn't expect that he would return in half a month.</p>

  <p>Besides, his strength has grown incredibly quickly. I am surprised..."</p>

  <p>"What? A disciple at the marrow refining level went to kill blade locusts? Did I hear it correctly? However, the strength of this kid is indeed enough for that kind of task," Mia Mu looked helplessly at the battle ring. "Such a ruthless kid. Every time he defeats his opponent with just a punch! It looks like he is humiliating them."</p>

  <p>Hearing what Mia Mu said, Mu Ning Su's lips lifted in a smug smile. Then she said, "That's because the disciples from your peak are too weak!"</p>

  <p>"You are naughty. I am helping you to motivate your disciples. But you are laughing at me! Although Luo Zheng is powerful, Vulture Peak is not short of talent. The last one to battle should be Jesse. He is ranked number one at Vulture Peak, and he's already a nature creature. As long as Jesse joins the battle, there is no way that Luo Zheng can win," said Mia Mu.</p>

  <p>"A nature creature? Then why is he still an outer disciple?" wondered Master Su with surprise. Generally speaking, many outer disciples were promoted to the status of inner disciples every year. Many of these disciples were half-step into the nature level. It was thus, surprising that a disciple at the nature level had not been promoted.</p>

  <p>Mia Mu smiled. "Is it possible that only Drizzle Peak has a genius?</p>

  <p>Vulture Peak also has talents. Why are you so surprised? Actually, Jesse broke through to the nature level about half a year after he entered Vulture Peak. Before we transfer him to an inner disciple, he is an outer disciple."</p>

  <p>A nature creature? Master Su wasn't sure how she felt about this revelation. On the one hand, she really wanted to see if Luo Zheng could defeat a nature creature; while on the other hand, she didn't want Luo Zheng to win.</p>

  <p>'Alas! Let me see what will happen first.' Mu Ning sighed.</p>

  <p>On the other side of the battle ring stood another disciple. This was the fifth disciple sent by Vulture Peak. He should be the strongest outer disciple at Vulture Peak.</p>

  <p>And he was Jesse Liu, a nature creature, who was now going to battle Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Jesse didn't have an imposing manner. In fact, his features and his body structure were ordinary. If he walked on the street, people would barely remember what he looked like.</p>

  <p>After Jesse Liu entered the battle ring, disciples from Drizzle Peak thought that they were going to win the challenge. Jesse, who was standing in front of them, seemed utterly inferior to the previous disciples sent by Vulture Peak.</p>

  <p>But when they saw that Jesse condensed life vitality and formed a hoop in his hand, their expressions changed dramatically.</p>

  <p>"A nature creature! This guy is actually a nature creature! Is he an outer disciple?"</p>

  <p>"That's unreasonable. Luo Zheng is an outer disciple. How can an inner disciple be sent to challenge Luo Zheng? This is a violation of the rules! If the other peak sends an inner disciple, we should also send an inner disciple!" said some indignantly.</p>

  <p>Many people had turned their eyes to those disciples dressed in black robes. They had been standing close to the arena, watching the matches.</p>

  <p>Since they were inner disciples of Drizzle Peak, they should have stepped forward for this challenge.</p>

  <p>The nature level was a hurdle for ordinary cultivators.</p>

  <p>There was a big difference between life energy and life vitality.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng used one blow to defeat every challenger from Vulture Peak.</p>

  <p>But to fight with someone at the nature level? That was hugely unfair!</p>

  <p>Only a nature creature should challenge a disciple at the same level.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, the battle would be too unsporting.</p>

  <p>Everyone noticed this gap in Jesse's and Zheng's abilities and commented on the underhanded match.</p>

  <p>"Jesse is ranked first at Vulture Peak. He has just stepped into the nature level. And there just wasn't enough time to promote him to inner disciple status! Of course, he is still an outer disciple. How is it against the rules?</p>

  <p>If you can't beat him, then just give up!" Jesse was the biggest hope for Vulture Peak now. Hearing what the disciples from Drizzle Peak said, the remaining disciples from Vulture Peak retorted sarcastically.</p>

  <p>The two sides were arguing, and the crowd once again became chaotic.</p>

  <p>But the two men in the battle ring completely ignored the riots outside the battle ring.</p>

  <p>The hoop in Jesse's hand swirled slowly. He said indifferently, "You are really strong. You have defeated three disciples who are half-step into the nature level. This is something that I have never heard of."</p>

  <p>"Thank you for the compliment," said Luo Zheng as he saluted.</p>

  <p>"However, you have humiliated Vulture Peak. Even though I will be suspected of bullying you, as I have the advantage of being a nature creature, I must win the challenge. Otherwise, it will be greatly embarrassing for the outer disciples of Vulture Peak, and there will be no foothold for us in Cloud Sect," said Jesse in a calm tone. There was no excitement and contempt in his voice. It seemed as though he were having a casual chat.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng also smiled calmly. "Please show mercy during the following battle."</p>

  <p>"Relax. I will only make you incapable of resisting. I will not hurt you!"</p>

  <p>Jesse Liu smiled lightly before gently tossing the golden hoop that was condensed by his life vitality toward Luo Zheng.</p>
