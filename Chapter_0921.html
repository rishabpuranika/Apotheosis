<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 921 Ninety-nine Cycles Of Reincarnation </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The battle lasted a whole day and night. Corpses lay all over the Burning Sky Imperial Capital, surrounded by fiery light. The war had plunged the people of the empire into suffering and misery.</p>

  <p>Zheng had killed ten masters of the Internal Elixir Realm with his strength alone. Only Aura had been able to escape.</p>

  <p>After that, Zheng led a troop of soldiers to the Burning Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>In the end, he successfully ascended the throne that he had fought for day and night. He stood at the top of the Burning Sky Palace, overlooking the world.</p>

  <p>A million strong soldiers dressed in golden armor were kneeling in front of Zheng with great respect. It was a spectacular scene to behold and the peak of Zheng's life.</p>

  <p>Aura, the last remaining descendant of the Su Clan, had been captured.</p>

  <p>"Is this another life of mine?" Zheng frowned. Although these scenes were an illusion in Zheng's eyes, they were still vivid in his mind. He could see all the details. Everything seemed real but absurd.</p>

  <p>"I should be the one to kill the last princess of the Su Clan!"</p>

  <p>With that, Zheng leaped up with his golden blade in hand and slashed at Aura.</p>

  <p>However, just as his blade was about to touch Aura's skin, a ray of sword light shot toward him!</p>

  <p>Ding!</p>

  <p>The sword light knocked Zheng's golden machete away from Aura.</p>

  <p>"Tianming?" Zheng saw Tianming dressed in a white robe and looking at him with an indifferent expression. Although Tianming was standing before one million strong soldiers, there wasn't the slightest trace of fear on his face.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" Zheng couldn't help but ask.</p>

  <p>Tianming smiled faintly. "Who am I? I'm a swordsman."</p>

  <p>"Why have you come here?" Zheng asked again.</p>

  <p>"The Burning Sky Empire is an ally of the Cloud Sect, and the Cloud Sect is under the jurisdiction of the Cloud Hall. I come from the Cloud Hall,"</p>

  <p>Tianming said nonchalantly. "If you want to usurp the throne, you have to ask the Cloud Hall members for their approval first!"</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!" Zheng roared and rushed toward Tianming.</p>

  <p>Ding, ding, ding!</p>

  <p>The two of them attacked each other, exchanging thousands of strikes in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>In the end, Tianming retreated one hundred feet and raised his long sword. At that moment, the color of heaven and earth changed. The sky was overrun by dark clouds and smoky fog. The momentum of Tianming's sword strike suppressed that of one million strong soldiers.</p>

  <p>"With your strength, you are far from qualified to be able to take over this country!" After Tianming finished speaking, he stabbed Zheng with his sword.</p>

  <p>This sword strike was so powerful that Zheng wasn't able to block it. Tianming's sword easily cut off Zheng's head from his body.</p>

  <p>The moment he was killed, Zheng felt resentment, anger, helplessness, and other sorts of emotions swarming his mind.</p>

  <p>"Is this... my fate in another life?"</p>

  <p>The scenes gradually disappeared, and Zheng found himself immersed in darkness once again. Now, he somewhat understood the meaning of the Gate of Samsara.</p>

  <p>No wonder he'd been able to cultivate his warrior spirit through the Gate of Samsara. It seemed that it had the ability to create an endless cycle of birth and death. After personally experiencing it, he would be able to absorb the emotions of his different lives and gain insights in the cycle of reincarnation. This way, he could experience life or death situations and learn something from them.</p>

  <p>This mysterious item that existed in the Upper World was truly miraculous.</p>

  <p>This method of cultivating the warrior spirit had indeed broadened Zheng's horizons. He found it incredible.</p>

  <p>Soon after, a golden vortex appeared in front of him, followed by new scenery.</p>

  <p>In this life, Zheng wasn't a warrior, but a cook guarding the stove. He was busy at the stove every day, surrounded by smoke. One day, he slaughtered a wild dog and found a magical jade pendant inside it.</p>

  <p>It was this jade pendant that changed his life. Then, he became a warrior again.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng didn't enter the Cloud Sect. Instead, he was an independent warrior and rapidly rose to prominence in the Eastern Region. Then, he founded a great sect that was comparable to the Cloud Sect and became its head.</p>

  <p>In the third cycle of reincarnation, Zheng was a great learned scholar who had a great reputation in the Eastern Region! In the face of the demon's attack, he decisively chose to become a leader and led the White Emperor City soldiers to resist the demon's attack.</p>

  <p>The fourth cycle of reincarnation...</p>

  <p>The fifth cycle of reincarnation...</p>

  <p>The sixth cycle of reincarnation...</p>

  <p>Scenes from numerous cycles of reincarnation zoomed past Zheng one by one.</p>

  <p>Everything he had experienced during these cycles of reincarnation left a deep impression on him.</p>

  <p>The more things a person experienced, the more profound his thoughts would be. He would also become increasingly insightful. After experiencing these cycles of reincarnation, Zheng's warrior spirit slowly rose to a higher level.</p>

  <p>As the cycles of reincarnation kept rotating and changing, various fates flashed by as well. From the beginning to the end, Zheng experienced each of the unique aspects of different fates.</p>

  <p>The beginning of each new reincarnation was the end of an old one. In this short period of time, Zheng experienced ninety-nine cycles of reincarnation!</p>

  <p>When it was all over, Zheng walked out of the Gate of Samsara feeling stunned.</p>

  <p>He had viewed so many cycles of reincarnation in such a short time that he wasn't able to digest all the information yet. However, its effect on his warrior spirit was obvious. After experiencing all these different lives, Zheng thoroughly comprehended life and death, glory, power, and desire.</p>

  <p>"How many cycles of reincarnation did you experience?" Esther asked Zheng.</p>

  <p>Everyone looked at him, waiting for his answer.</p>

  <p>Zheng was slightly taken aback. "Why are you asking me such a question?</p>

  <p>Isn't the number of everyone's cycles of reincarnation the same? How much time has passed?"</p>

  <p>"Two hours," Xun said with a smile.</p>

  <p>"That long?" Zheng was stunned.</p>

  <p>Just now, many warriors had wondered if Zheng had died since he hadn't come out for a long time.</p>

  <p>"The number of cycles of reincarnation one sees in the Gate of Samsara is determined by the strength of his warrior spirit. The stronger a person's warrior spirit is, the greater his number of cycles of reincarnation will be,"</p>

  <p>Yolande explained.</p>

  <p>Every cycle of reincarnation would have a great impact on a warrior. If one's warrior spirit wasn't strong enough, he would gradually lose himself in one cycle after another. After a point, he wouldn't be able to tell the difference between reality and a cycle of reincarnation.</p>

  <p>Therefore, when a warrior tried to cultivate through cycles of reincarnation, the moment his mind showed some sign of losing its way, the reincarnation would disappear and he would be released from the Gate of Samsara.</p>

  <p>"I experienced nine cycles of reincarnation," Fabian said.</p>

  <p>"I only had six cycles of reincarnation," Jarrod uttered.</p>

  <p>Esther remarked, "I went through thirteen cycles of reincarnation. What about you, Zheng?"</p>

  <p>"Me? I seemed to experience ninety-nine cycles," answered Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Ninety-nine cycles?!" Fabian's eyes nearly popped out of his head when he heard Zheng. "How did you experience so many cycles? Didn't you lose yourself after a point?"</p>

  <p>"Lose myself? How can that happen?" Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Esther and the others were bewildered. It seemed that Zheng's warrior spirit was just too strong.</p>

  <p>"Zheng's warrior spirit is indeed much stronger than an ordinary warrior's. The Gate of Samsara is made from the power of the six paths of reincarnation.</p>

  <p>Although it can't replace the real path of reincarnation, the power of the samsara is enough to make many warriors lose themselves. The maximum number of cycles a warrior can experience in the Gate of Samsara is ninety-nine." Yolande seemed to know everything about the Gate of Samsara.</p>

  <p>"I see..." Zheng finally understood why he had gone through reincarnation ninety-nine times. However, from the beginning to the end, he hadn't felt like he was losing his warrior spirit at all.</p>

  <p>Looking at the Gate of Samsara, Fabian smacked his lips and said, "It really is a magical treasure. If only I could take it to the Purple Heart Sacred Place."</p>

  <p>Xun sneered, "Take it to the Purple Heart Sacred Place? Do you really think you'll be able to keep the Gate of Samsara there?"</p>

  <p>"What makes you think we won't be able to keep it?" Fabian was slightly indignant.</p>

  <p>"If a treasure of this level leaves this place, the aura it emits will not be hidden by the Cursed Land. The Gate of Samara might attract supreme masters from the Upper World. With their powerful strength, those masters can easily destroy the entire Sea God Continent and take it away," Xun uttered indifferently.</p>

  <p>Hearing Xun's words, Fabian went pale in shock.</p>

  <p>Xun was right. Some inheritances within the Dark Nether Cave were too powerful and precious to be kept by a small force of the Lower World.</p>

  <p>Zheng looked at the Gate of Samsara. He was still slowly digesting and comprehending the complex emotions that he had experienced in the cycles of reincarnation. At this moment, he said, "Since that's the case, let's continue our exploration!"</p>

  <p>Although the Gate of Samsara was magical, it wasn't the inheritance that Mist had mentioned.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid you won't have the chance to continue the exploration now!" A deep voice rang out, loud and deafening enough to make everyone's ears tingle.</p>

  <p>Zheng was shocked to hear this familiar voice. He looked in the direction where the sound had come from and saw Malcom's burly figure some distance away.</p>
