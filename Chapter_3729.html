  <p>
</p>

  <p>The reason Luo Zheng found the Creation Myth Temple was because of the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed.</p>

  <p>At first, he obtained the seed in the hopes of increasing the blood of the Ancient Chaos God in his body.</p>

  <p>But since the Snake Goddess didn't even ask about it, Luo Zheng decided it would be best to not report to her.</p>

  <p>"I did find them, and I also found you," Luo Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess's eyes widened, surprised with his response.</p>

  <p>Pearce mentioned that the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi had appeared beside Luo Zheng, and this left her confused. If this was possible, could it be that there was another Snake Goddess? However, Pearce failed to explain clearly, so the Snake Goddess was just assuming based on a whim.</p>

  <p>Just then, Luo Zheng transmitted his voice into his inner world.</p>

  <p>Within a few moments, three faint figures floated right out of Luo Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>The two figures on the left and right were the Snake Goddess and Fuxi respectively and the Primeval Lord of Heaven was in the middle.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess looked at her real self before her, studying each and every part. She brought her fingers to her mouth, shocked that her real self had the exact same aura, appearance, and expression as hers.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Fuxi frowned at the sight of his real self.</p>

  <p>At the same time, he couldn't help but notice how free and easy his real self was.</p>

  <p>"You... You are me?" the Snake Goddess asked.</p>

  <p>The real Snake Goddess nodded politely with a soft smile, "Yes. I've heard that Li Shan mountain led the many seeds we sowed before. You're quite extraordinary, if I do say so myself."</p>

  <p>"Are you praising yourself or praising me?" The Snake Goddess let out a small chuckle.</p>

  <p>"Both."</p>

  <p>The two Snake Goddesses got along so easily, as if they were the best of friends. The Fuxis, on the other hand, had not moved since their eyes met.</p>

  <p>Their eyes were wide and both of them appeared speechless, making it really awkward.</p>

  <p>After a few minutes, the Primeval Lord of Heaven introduced himself and explained the situation of the Other Shore to the Snake Goddess.</p>

  <p>When Fuxi heard that the Civilization Artifact was carried by Luo Zheng, a look of sadness washed over his face.</p>

  <p>It seemed that Luo Zheng was becoming more and more significant to the human race.</p>

  <p>"I actually had a gut feeling when I initially planted these seeds," the Primeval Lord of Heaven explained. "If it weren't for the intervention of the Element Spirit Civilization, the human race would have already had the largest, most absolute advantage."</p>

  <p>It was known that the Primeval Lord of Heaven found and used a loophole that helped him sow the seeds of the human race. Though other races used this tactic as well, it was no match for the Primeval Lord of Heaven's plan.</p>

  <p>At this time, the Element Spirit race's progress was relatively slow, but they were still able to use Divine Farmer, Xuanyuan and Emperor Di Jun.</p>

  <p>They ended up taking half of the human forces.</p>

  <p>With the assistance of the Element Spirit race, the half human forces had potential to dominate the entire Source World.</p>

  <p>Although the Li Shan mountain was not weak, with the strongest warriors of the Taiyi Heaven Palace being trapped on the Other Shore, the overall strength of the other half proved to be weaker.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't mean that we can't put up a fight," Fuxi expressed with ferocity.</p>

  <p>His sudden snap made everyone turn to look at him. It seemed that Fuxi pointed out something no one had thought before.</p>

  <p>"Okay, I came here to ask Luo Zheng for something," Fuxi strayed away from his earlier topic.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng blinked his eyes a few times. "And what is it that you want?"</p>

  <p>"The golden red Chaotic Source Spirits."</p>

  <p>At the mention of the golden red Chaotic Source Spirits, Luo Zheng's eyes shot up and pierced through Fuxi.</p>

  <p>The first time he came across the golden red Chaotic Source Spirits, Luo Zheng had high expectations. However, after a long while, he could not figure out how to use them. They didn't seem to be used to strengthen physical bodies.</p>

  <p>In order to speed up the process, Luo Zheng left some for Yan to study. Luo Zheng's eyes softened as he responded, "Master Fuxi, have you figured out how to absorb the golden red Chaotic Source Spirits?"</p>

  <p>Fuxi rolled his eyes. "It is obvious that you want to absorb everything. But you don't know that the golden red Chaotic Source Spirits are not used to strengthen your body- they are used to support the Descending Rings."</p>

  <p>"The Descending Rings?"</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven and his two companions couldn't help but shake their heads and exchange looks of confusion.</p>

  <p>The crystals produced by the Chaotic Source Spirits had effects on strengthening the Other Shore Realm warriors. This was the information the Snake Goddess had obtained from the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Tree, and it was passed down by the Primeval Lord of Heaven himself.</p>

  <p>However, he and other humans from the Other Shore knew nothing about the Descending Rings, and the golden red Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>When the Snake Goddess saw that the Primeval Lord of Heaven was a little confused, she immediately said, "Primeval Lord of Heaven, it seems that you are unaware of the change in the Chaotic Source Sea. The Element Spirit race used a method to interfere with the Chaotic Source Spirits, and that is what caused the Descending Rings to appear. Divine Farmer obtained six rings, the Black Ship got three, and Fuxi got the rest three, but... "</p>

  <p>She went on to explain everything she knew.</p>

  <p>Once she finished speaking, the eyes of the real Snake Goddess, the real Fuxi and the Primeval Lord of Heaven glowed, it was so bright that it resembled starlight.</p>

  <p>Seeing this phenomenon, the Snake Goddess's jaw dropped. She had forgotten the desire of the Other Shore creatures to descend...</p>

  <p>There was no way that the creatures on the Other Shore could descend from the Other Shore. This law was tough as stone, and had existed since the early years of the Element Spirit Civilization. No one had ever come close to breaking it.</p>

  <p>This also meant that the truth would never be violated.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven shook his head to the news. "The Descending Rings? Did any Other Shore creature actually descend with it? "</p>

  <p>"Yes," Fuxi said as he nodded. "Divine Farmer attempted to make a Moon Fire Slave descend, but he was quickly killed by the truth."</p>

  <p>He knew this after he'd seen the Moon Fire Slave descending through the memory of Thunder Dimorphodon.</p>

  <p>"Killed by the truth..." the Primeval Lord of Heaven murmured to himself, trying to understand what had happened. "This only means that the restrictions were never lifted."</p>

  <p>In fact, the biggest problem of the creatures on the Other Shore was not descending. The Primeval Lord of Heaven had taken several opportunities to make uses of the loophole to help the creatures descend.</p>

  <p>However, the consequence of being erased by the truth was the problem. No matter what descended, it would be erased by the truth. This kind of descending was meaningless.</p>

  <p>Eventually, when the Primeval Lord of Heaven discovered another loophole, his agenda was no longer to "descend". Instead, he sowed the seeds of the human race, which was how the greatest human forces emerged: the Li Shan mountain, the Taiyi Heaven Palace, the Bearing race, and the Divine Farmer race.</p>

  <p>"He was killed by the truth due to the lack of golden red Chaotic Source Spirits. Exactly the ones in Luo Zheng's hand," Fuxi added. "If the Descending Rings could cooperate with the golden red Chaotic Source Spirits, the Other Shore creatures would dodge the truth and completely descend, unharmed."</p>

  <p>With a gentle wave of his hand, Luo Zheng held out his palm to expose the golden red Chaotic Source Spirits he kept. "I didn't realize these Chaotic Source Spirits have such an effect."</p>

  <p>Fuxi stepped forward and grabbed one from Luo Zheng's hand, and smiled. "Well, it's just a really good deduction. Next thing we have to do is make sure I'm right."</p>
