  <p>
</p>

  <p>The sky turned from vivid purple to deep blue as night fell on the Night View Island.</p>

  <p>When the light dimmed, the light spots in the Abstruse Energy World looked more like stars.</p>

  <p>Then, the members of the Wooden Leaf race all went back to their own caves.</p>

  <p>Inside one large cave above, Pearson brought out the grey Ghost Powder and divided it among the group.</p>

  <p>Although he had already distributed the Ghost Powder, they were not in a hurry to use it.</p>

  <p>King Ieuan stood at the entrance of the cave, where a large eye floated beside it. It was the Heavenly Eye Vine's eye, which could separate from its body if necessary.</p>

  <p>The spiritual sense could not detect what happened in the distance, but the eye could.</p>

  <p>There was a vine from the eye on King Ieuan's forehead, and it could see the top of the mountain when it stood on one side of the cave.</p>

  <p>An hour ago, Pearson had turned into a spider thread and quietly left the cave. He climbed to the top of the mountain, took out two Grass Bulls from his spirit beast bag, and put them there.</p>

  <p>Even though the Grass Bulls were from the Other Shore, they were not intelligent and did not have any token. However, their flesh was very delicious. Pearson caught them for his meals.</p>

  <p>To prevent them from escaping, he rendered them unconscious first then fixed them on top of the mountain. Then, he evenly spread some Ghost Powder on one bull. When it became white, he quietly returned to the cave.</p>

  <p>Now, King Ieuan saw two motionless Grass Bulls on top of the mountain with the help of the eye. One was black, and the other was white.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Once the light on the Night View Island was dim to a certain extent, it seemed that a door in one corner of the island had opened. An unpleasant aura rushed forth from the door and spread throughout the island.</p>

  <p>King Ieuan's eyes lit up. "Squeak! It's the Treacherous Being's aura," it said.</p>

  <p>Everyone in the cave sat in meditation, but the moment the aura descended, they all opened their eyes.</p>

  <p>Fuxi somersaulted and walked towards the entrance of the cave.</p>

  <p>"Did you see anything?" he asked. King Ieuan shook its head, "Not yet.</p>

  <p>Squeak!"</p>

  <p>Even if it did not see the Treacherous Being, the truth was it still felt scared.</p>

  <p>A resentment-level Treacherous Being could not cover the entire island with its aura. It was most likely the hatred-level Treacherous Being that could release such an aura.</p>

  <p>"When can I return to the spirit beast bag?" the Heavenly Eye Vine asked.</p>

  <p>The horrifying aura made it a little uneasy.</p>

  <p>It had thought that Luo Zheng and his group had successfully entered the Supreme Pure Realm, but it never occurred to it that they would reach the Jade Pure Realm directly. It naturally did not want to stay in such a terrible world.</p>

  <p>"Not now."</p>

  <p>Just as King Ieuan spoke, its bean-sized eyes suddenly widened to twice their size, as if it saw something shocking.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Eye Vine turned to look, and it was also stunned.</p>

  <p>Fuxi arched his eyebrows. "What did you see?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Some white things fell from the sky. They look like hairs," King Ieuan answered. Indeed, white hairs that emitted a faint white light fell one by one.</p>

  <p>When they piled up to a certain amount, they merged and formed a human-shaped white-haired monster.</p>

  <p>It was clear that the white-haired monster found the Grass Bulls and crawled towards them.</p>

  <p>However, it hesitated for a moment when it passed by the white bull.</p>

  <p>Eventually, it gave up and quickly walked towards the black bull.</p>

  <p>King Ieuan attentively watched the scene. The moment the white-haired monster touched the black bull, the bull's head disappeared. The white-haired monster had eaten it.</p>

  <p>Blood gushed out from the black bull's neck and splashed on the white-haired monster's body. But as soon as the blood touched the white-haired monster, it disappeared without a trace at all. Naturally, the monster also drank it.</p>

  <p>As the monster continued to move, it ate the entire black bull.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>Soon enough, the monster dissipated with a loud bang and turned into thin white hairs that scattered on the ground.</p>

  <p>Then, the white hairs slowly disappeared. King Ieuan saw a few transparent crystals which did not disappear with the white hairs.</p>

  <p>"What are these crystals?" King Ieuan asked curiously.</p>

  <p>White hairs also appeared about ten feet away from it.</p>

  <p>Up close, they looked like pure winter snow? beautiful but fatal.</p>

  <p>It was not until then that King Ieuan remembered its mission. It grabbed the spirit beast bag and gently put the eye back into the bag. Then, it quickly turned around and returned to the cave. "Everybody, hurry up!</p>

  <p>Apply the Ghost Powder!" "The black bull is dead?" Pearson asked.</p>

  <p>"Creak! Yes! Hurry up!" King Ieuan confirmed and applied the Ghost Powder on its body.</p>

  <p>In turn, Luo Zheng, the Snake Goddess, and the Eternal Realm Hunters applied a layer of Ghost Powder on their bodies.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng wasn't sure if Treacherous Beings devoured each other, but they had quite a lot of Ghost Powder. Thus, Campbell also applied the Ghost Powder to his body.</p>

  <p>As soon as they finished, four human-shaped monsters arrived in the cave.</p>

  <p>They kept looking around, as if they were looking for something.</p>

  <p>Moreover, they exuded such an intimidating aura that everyone tried their best to resist the urge to escape.</p>

  <p>After the white-haired monsters had searched for a while, one of them suddenly turned and looked at Luo Zheng, then strode towards him.</p>

  <p>He only frowned and did not move, but every muscle in his body tightened.</p>

  <p>Even though he did not know how to deal with the monster, he would never wait for death.</p>

  <p>When the monster finally approached him, it stretched out its hand, brushed past his ear, and slapped the wall.</p>

  <p>He carefully turned his head, only to see that the monster had targeted the plant that just sprouted on the wall.</p>

  <p>No wonder the sloth sprinkled the Ghost Powder on the trees! The white-haired monsters also ate plants.</p>

  <p>Then, the white-haired monsters searched every corner of the cave and made sure that there was no "living creature" left for them to devour.</p>

  <p>Afterward, they exploded into a pile of messy white hairs and gradually disappeared.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi let out a sigh of relief. "They finally left."</p>

  <p>"Squeak! They won't come back again," said King Ieuan.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the Snake Goddess frowned in thought. "They rely on the life energy to find their prey, right? After we apply the Ghost Powder, we are like dead people," she stated.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, the Eternal Realm warriors present had sharp senses.</p>

  <p>Today, however, they became too nervous because of the Treacherous Being. They had not realized that fact until the Snake Goddess reminded them.</p>

  <p>The Ghost Powder almost entirely blocked the life energy. In other words, if someone applied the Ghost Powder on their bodies and lay motionless on the ground, they would look like corpses.</p>

  <p>"I think so," Pearson said with a nod.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess thought for a while and said, "I'll try again. Please don't shake off the Ghost Powder on your bodies."</p>

  <p>"Don't..." Before Pearson could stop her, she had already removed the Ghost Powder on the back of her hand, which revealed her white and delicate skin.</p>

  <p>Just then, white hairs slowly began to pile up not far away from the cave.</p>

  <p>Not long after, the white-haired monsters appeared again and rushed towards the Snake Goddess.</p>

  <p>Yet, she remained calm. She wasn't even in a hurry to reapply the Ghost Powder. Instead, she raised her hand and retreated slowly, luring the white-haired monsters to follow her.</p>

  <p>'What a crazy woman!' Pearson thought helplessly.</p>
