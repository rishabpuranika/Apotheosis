  <p>
</p>

  <p>As Zheng thought things over, Feng Ge directly asked the Shape-shifting Spirit,</p>

  <p>"Don't you have the ability of shape shifting? Why don't you transform into your master so we can have a look what your master looks like?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, that sounds like a good idea." Zheng patted his head. The monster before them called itself Shape-shifting Spirit, so turning into the form of its master should be no problem for it.</p>

  <p>The "Zheng" in the cage hesitated. It seemed to be terrified of its master.</p>

  <p>"Well, come on! Change!" Feng Ge ordered, the impatience clear in her voice.</p>

  <p>Although the iron house slightly piqued her interest, Feng Ge didn't want to waste her time exploring it like what Zheng and the Regal Jade Spirit wanted to do. In fact, Zheng was the only reason she had enough patience to stay.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>The ball of light Feng Ge held in her palm began to twitch. What appeared as a harmless light source to Zheng and Feng Ge ended up being extremely dangerous to the Shape-shifting Spirit.</p>

  <p>"I? Alright, I'll do it!"</p>

  <p>The Shape-shifting Spirit finally compromised. Right then and there, its body, which was in Zheng's form began to soften and become pliable and sticky to the touch like clay before changing into a round sphere.</p>

  <p>It was translucent, and there were gently flickering flames burning within it.</p>

  <p>It possessed no eyes, ears, mouth, or nose.</p>

  <p>"This is what your master is like?" Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"Yes. This is what he looks like," the Shape-shifting Spirit replied.</p>

  <p>Zheng and Feng Ge had a hard time confirming this since they had never seen its master before. But then, the Regal Jade Spirit that had been watching them secretly finally said in a serious tone, "This? is a member of the Element Spirit Civilization. "</p>

  <p>"Element Spirit Civilization?" Zheng was stunned.</p>

  <p>He had heard about this particular civilization before through the Regal Jade Spirit. The Instant Civilization was the first civilization to ever exist. It was also the civilization that had initiated all the civilizations in the entire chaos.</p>

  <p>For a long time, everyone doubted its existence because there was little to no proof of it. Therefore, everyone acknowledged the second civilization? the Element Spirit Civilization? as the first one instead. What was more, the last flaw of the Ways-blending Energy should also be in their hands.</p>

  <p>"The Element Spirit Civilization has five big branches, which are metal spirits, wood spirits, water spirits, fire spirits and earth spirits," the Regal Jade Spirit enlightened. "What the Shape-shifting Spirit is showing us is a fire spirit, hence the flames encased within it," the Regal Jade Spirit continued.</p>

  <p>Even during the peak of the Regal Jade Civilization, they were no match against the powerful Element Spirit Civilization. In fact, the latter had already become a dominant power on the Other Shore at that time.</p>

  <p>And as the second civilization, they were presented with numerous advantages.</p>

  <p>The first civilization that was naturally formed in the chaos...</p>

  <p>The first civilization to enter the Other Shore...</p>

  <p>The first civilization that produced a Chaos Ancient God...</p>

  <p>With their abundance of first titles, they were able to cover some truths in the long time of their development. There was no mistaking the great power they held.</p>

  <p>"The energy vortex has served as a bridge between the Desire World and the Lust World. For countless years, numerous beings from various civilizations traveled through it with extreme caution. But I never thought that the Element Spirit Civilization was always guarding it." The Regal Jade Spirit heaved a sigh.</p>

  <p>With them guarding, they could let anyone pass.</p>

  <p>As for how to enter the iron house, the civilizations following it were clueless as to how it was done.</p>

  <p>If it wasn't for Feng Ge? the purified being that triggered the counterattack on the entire energy vortex? Zheng would've never found the iron house.</p>

  <p>Even if someone found it, it'd be impossible for them to enter since the Sanskrit words etched in the door were difficult to decipher. Luckily, Zheng had Geoffrey in his inner world who was able to easily decipher Sanskrit words.</p>

  <p>By some strange circumstances, Zheng was able to break in.</p>

  <p>Zheng's questions were finally answered by the Regal Jade Spirit.</p>

  <p>He blinked his eyes before proceeding to ask the Shape-shifting Spirit,</p>

  <p>"Since your master is the guard of this iron house, he can control the energy vortex as well, correct?"</p>

  <p>"I..."</p>

  <p>It was clear that the Shape-shifting Spirit didn't dare to reveal too much.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge began to threateningly toss the ball of light in her palm up and down. Her control of the Great Sanskrit Light was growing better every day.</p>

  <p>Splash...</p>

  <p>The Shape-shifting Spirit quickly changed back to its original form. Then, it began to say, "Indeed, my master can control the energy vortex. Every once in a while, he closes the passageway. Once, it was closed for a very long time?"</p>

  <p>"It's true," the Regal Jade Spirit informed Zheng in his mind. "The energy vortex has been closed for many times, but every time it was closed, it was soon opened. It is said that it was closed for a long time, during the 750th chaotic era. Then suddenly, it opened once more and no one knew what had happened."</p>

  <p>"Where does your master control the passageway?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Within the iron house, except for the cages hanging on the wall, it was almost empty.</p>

  <p>"Above there," replied the Shape-shifting Spirit.</p>

  <p>Zheng looked to the corner of the wall that it pointed at which was covered with a dozen Sanskrit words.</p>

  <p>"My master could go up once he activates the Sanskrit words. I've never been there. You probably won't be able to go up either?"</p>

  <p>Although the Shape-shifting Spirit was proficient in the languages spoken by many races and could change into various forms, it was incapable of understanding Sanskrit words.</p>

  <p>"Really?"</p>

  <p>Zheng's lips curled up as he walked towards the corner of the wall and stood in front of the Sanskrit words.</p>

  <p>"What is that human doing?" asked the Shape-shifting Spirit.</p>

  <p>"Trying to decipher the Sanskrit words, probably," Feng Ge informed it with a shrug of her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"That's impossible! Sanskrit words are never easy to decipher!" The Shape-shifting Spirit exclaimed, doubting Zheng's success.</p>

  <p>"Nothing is impossible. Don't forget how we came in," Feng Ge reminded it coldly.</p>

  <p>The Shape-shifting Spirit had been confined in this iron house for countless years, and it had forgotten that there were still those Sanskrit words set outside the iron house. The door wouldn't have been opened if those Sanskrit words were not deciphered.</p>

  <p>"So you're saying?he really can decipher the words?" As the Shape-shifting Spirit stood still in disbelief, Zheng reached out towards the Sanskrit words and began to press them.</p>

  <p>"Buzz buzz buzz buzz?"</p>

  <p>As Zheng pressed a finger to each word, it began to glow. Soon, after he pressed ten times, a green light glowed on each word in the dark and the sound of metal grinding against each other could be heard. A metal staircase slowly began to descend from above.</p>

  <p>"You?you did it?"</p>

  <p>The Shape-shifting Spirit was left speechless.</p>

  <p>Ever since it was trapped here, no one had successfully managed to break into the iron house. Now here it was witnessing an individual with great ability doing exactly what its master could do.</p>

  <p>Where did he learn to decipher Sanskrit words so effortlessly?</p>

  <p>It had never seen such a thing happen before.</p>

  <p>As the staircase drew closer to Zheng, Feng Ge drew near him as well.</p>

  <p>Zheng furrowed his brows as soon as he stepped on the stairs. He turned his head and stared at the Shape-shifting Spirit.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, what's wrong?" Feng Ge asked.</p>

  <p>She worried that the Shape-shifting Spirit might've told a lie and would eventually lead them right into a trap.</p>

  <p>Zheng quickly walked to the iron cage and asked, "You... have seen humans before?"</p>

  <p>The Shape-shifting Spirit was different from other creatures on the Other Shore. It could morph into various creatures. Zheng was sure it was only the first time that it had morphed into him, yet it mimicked him perfectly, with the exact appearance, movement, and language. It meant this was by no means the first time that the Shape-shifting Spirit had become a human.</p>
