  <p>
</p>

  <p>For cultivators, destiny was only an illusion.</p>

  <p>But many cultivators tended to believe in destiny. That was why in the cultivators' world, there had been a profession related to destiny. People engaging in this profession were called destiny masters and they claimed to help cultivators improve their destiny.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, most cultivators sneered at destiny masters and thought that all theories about destiny were false. For the lack of a better word, destiny masters were swindlers. Many cultivators spent a great deal of money in hiring destiny masters to better their fate before they took on adventures in some mysterious areas but still were often heard to have died tragically and miserably.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the existence of destiny was still rather controversial and no definite conclusion had been reached.</p>

  <p>People in the same rank as Kenneth and Fernandez usually believed in the existence of destiny. But it was impossible for them to find "destiny masters", who dared not to cheat on them either.</p>

  <p>Speaking of this, Luo Luo Zheng had been able to escape from that puppet's assaults just because of his own destiny.</p>

  <p>People with good destiny were always not that easy to kill. They could even survive on the verge of death.</p>

  <p>The sect heads and Fernandez had great admirations for Luo Zheng's destiny aside from his success for having gained the silver treasure box.</p>

  <p>This big world was full of wonders. There were mysterious, dangerous, and ominous places. Despite great dangers, there were great opportunities to be gained from these areas. The higher the risk, the greater the rewards could be. It would all depend on if one would be willing to risk his own life to get the rewards.</p>

  <p>"Some years ago, the head of Cloud Hall opened the silver treasure box.</p>

  <p>Today, Luo Luo Zheng will open one as well," Fernandez said, heaving a long and heavy sigh. Soon enough, he added, "I feel that I have to report this to my superior."</p>

  <p>When Kenneth heard these words out of Fernandez's mouth, his heart got filled with great joy. If Luo Luo Zheng could have a great reputation, that only meant more benefits for Kenneth. There was no doubt that Kenneth would benefit more if Luo Zheng's performances could arouse the interests of the Cloud Hall head.</p>

  <p>Standing in front of the silver treasure box, Luo Luo Zheng could not hide the excitement on his face.</p>

  <p>Lennon knew about the value of this silver treasure box, but Luo Luo Zheng didn't and had no idea that the first silver treasure box was opened by the Cloud Hall head.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng only knew that he got the silver treasure box as a fruit of all the hardships he had gone through.</p>

  <p>He would surely think highly of the treasure chest because it was obtained through hardships and efforts.</p>

  <p>"Clatter!"</p>

  <p>The click of opening the box was like music to Luo Zheng's ears. It was the sweetest he had heard so far.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was expecting to find inside the box something that he could directly integrate into his body to enhance his physical strengths. But beyond his expectation, he found a dark green jade slip inside.</p>

  <p>The color suggested that it was made of the purest jade.</p>

  <p>"Is this a rare book about cultivation methods?" Luo Luo Zheng asked himself, his eyebrows arched up and down out of his curiosity.</p>

  <p>As he was about to pick up the dark jade slip, Luo Luo Zheng felt something strange.</p>

  <p>Instantly, the jade slip diffused into streaks of dark green light and spiraled up along his arms to his brain.</p>

  <p>'What kind of jade slip is this? How could it penetrate directly into my brain?' muttered Luo Luo Zheng. He was totally stunned and felt rather confused.</p>

  <p>It wasn't the first thing that had infiltrated his brain in the course of the Cloud Road trial. When Luo Luo Zheng obtained the red treasure box, he found something black inside it. It was a type of overpowering drug for a soul.</p>

  <p>Thereafter, he obtained the blue treasure box which contained blood vigor of a nine-headed dragon. Both items were a type of energy that penetrated his brain.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng was surprised to see that the jade slip could diffuse into streaks of green light and slip into his brain. It was the most baffling and confusing thing he had seen in the Cloud Road.</p>

  <p>After his brain absorbed the diffused jade slip, it was as if all texts of that slip got transferred to his brain.</p>

  <p>Each word looked deadly desolate and depressed as though each stroke had the ability to kill people.</p>

  <p>"Malicious Wheel of Life and Death. A tier five cultivation method.</p>

  <p>As Blood Fiend Emperor, I have developed this cultivation method based on what I have comprehended all my life. This cultivation method can drive an enormous amount of malicious Mu Ning. It can kill gods and Buddhas.</p>

  <p>Malicious Mu Ning originates from the curses of living creatures. It mustn't be used to..."</p>

  <p>It was a book about a tier five cultivation method!</p>

  <p>The person who created this cultivation method was known as Blood Fiend Emperor. The name rang a bell, but Luo Luo Zheng could not figure out who that man was.</p>

  <p>However, he was very clear that the word "Emperor" in that person's name had a different meaning from the Emperor of Burning Sky Empire.</p>

  <p>In a secular world, there was always an emperor that ruled ordinary people. But the term emperor had different meaning in the cultivators' world.</p>

  <p>The word "emperor" in the Blood Fiend Emperor symbolized the crowning glory for a cultivator. Only leading and top masters were qualified for the title of emperor in the big cultivators' world.</p>

  <p>Blood Fiend Emperor was an emperor level master. This land was an ancient relic and Blood Fiend Emperor was perhaps the former owner of this relic.</p>

  <p>This ancient land was so vast that it was possessed by a top sect. As tens of millions of years passed, the relic had gradually eroded. Luo Luo Zheng didn't know if the Blood Fiend Emperor was still alive or not. But at least, the Blood Fiend Emperor had recorded his own cultivation method on the jade slip and placed it here in order that his cultivation method could be further inherited.</p>

  <p>This jade slip had been stored there for many years. It was so amazing that Luo Luo Zheng was the one that had opened this silver treasure box at last. Was a book on the same cultivation method also stored in other silver treasure boxes?</p>

  <p>The fact was that each silver treasure box contained a jade slip of different cultivation method. All of them were Blood Fiend Emperor's inheritable cultivation methods but Malicious Wheel of Life and Death was the best one.</p>

  <p>The head of Cloud Hall had gotten the second best cultivation book, namely the Fiendish Blood Cultivation. So far, this cultivation method had turned into one of the most powerful tactics for the head of Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>These dark green jade slips were categorized as soul jade slips because all the characters were engraved by their owners' soul.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Luo Luo Zheng felt like all the words on the jade slip had shown up in his brain. In fact, the soul jade slip was extraordinary. It would be impossible for Luo Luo Zheng to write down the cultivation method verbatim from his brain on a piece of paper because of some taboos added to this soul jade slip. Luo Luo Zheng would find it difficult to remember the words even if he forced himself to write down the cultivation method. He would either fail to convey the meaning of the cultivation method or wrote it down wrong.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng would be unable to impart the cultivation method carved on this soul jade slip to anyone else unless he could skillfully cultivate and master it.</p>

  <p>This jade slip could prevent others from stealthily acquiring Luo Zheng's cultivation method.</p>

  <p>Therefore, even if someone who was far more powerful than Luo Luo Zheng showed any interest in this rare book and coerced Luo Luo Zheng to write down all content of that cultivation method, it would be highly impossible for Luo Luo Zheng to do so.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, who had owned a book about a tier five cultivation method, clearly knew how powerful and mighty tier five cultivation methods were.</p>

  <p>Although he had not thoroughly comprehended the Heavenly Ogre Fist, no one clearly knew how dreadful the demonic life vitality was other than him. By using the demonic life vitality, one was capable of engulfing and possessing others' life vitality. Meanwhile, the demonic phantom was helpful for battling. These amazing effects could be only achieved by people who practiced tier five cultivation methods.</p>

  <p>In addition, Luo Luo Zheng had gone to the Killing Sword Mountain. To acquire, practice, and master the killing way, one would require malicious Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>Now, Luo Luo Zheng had stored some malicious Mu Ning in the Killing Sword Mountain. To give play to the might of malicious Mu Ning, Luo Luo Zheng had to practice a cultivation method related to it. Thus, the Malicious Wheel of Life and Death proved to be very useful for Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng badly wished that he could sit down right away to practice the Malicious Wheel of Life and Death, but since he was now on the Cloud Road, it was unrealistic for him to cultivate there.</p>

  <p>It was not until this moment that Luo Luo Zheng suddenly felt his hands and feet itchy. Only after this did he notice that the wounds on both his hands and feet were even healing slowly.</p>

  <p>"Hey, these wounds are healing fast!" mumbled Luo Luo Zheng out of astonishment.</p>

  <p>Earlier, that puppet's four claws had left large wounds on Luo Zheng's wrists and limbs and he never expected the wounds to heal quickly. But now, the blood had started to coagulate, and scabs began to form on the wounds.</p>

  <p>All this should be attributed to blood vigor of the nine-headed dragon. It was said that even if one head of the dragon was cut off, the dragon could still survive and the head would regenerate. The most amazing gift of it was its ability to regenerate. With the help of his mighty power and blood circulation, Luo Luo Zheng physically could recover faster. Thus, his wounds healed more quickly.</p>

  <p>Letting his wounds heal on their own, he now shifted his attention to his next target, the gold treasure box.</p>

  <p>But this time, Luo Luo Zheng acted more cautiously. He wanted to obtain not only the gold treasure box, but also the black one, because he was now sure that each box had something that would benefit him.</p>

  <p>Having put his life in danger to obtain the silver treasure box let Luo Luo Zheng know what to expect in obtaining the gold and black treasure boxes. He guessed that it would be more difficult to get these boxes.</p>

  <p>Did he have to take even these two boxes? Or would he be contented with the silver box he had just obtained?</p>
