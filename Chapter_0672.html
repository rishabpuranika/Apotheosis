  <h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 672 Yudie Ning </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>That was when he saw a young woman floating closer. He stared at her long legs which were bent as though she was reclining. He followed the fit looking limbs up, gazing at her torso and the near perfect curves the woman had. He looked higher, finding it impossible to look away from the flawless oval face. With a pert nose and full lips, she appeared a vision. Her high cheekbones served to draw attention to the seductive allure of her doe-like emerald eyes framed by her ideally arched brows.</p>

  <p>As she stared back at Zheng, she narrowed her captivating eyes flirtatiously.</p>

  <p>Blood rushed to Zheng's face as he gazed at the young lady, and he felt an irresistible impulse to do anything she asked wash over him.</p>

  <p>"Wow! Her flirtation skill is frighteningly strong!" exclaimed Zheng kitting his browline curiously. A slight quiver went through his soul before he felt his body return to normal, the fog in his brain cleared, and he could see clearly once more.</p>

  <p>"Huh?" Lady Poison-blood uttered, as a bewildered look crossed her face. Her flirtation skill was exceptional, and it was especially potent against young men! 'That's odd?! Based on his bone structure, he's seventeen, eighteen the oldest. That's when boys are becoming men, and lacking experience. They are already easily swayed by the opposite sex, and unable to resist my flirtation skill! He was only affected for a few seconds and managed to break the enchantment. How's that possible?' deliberated Lady Poison-blood, baffled.</p>

  <p>Naturally, she didn't realize that Zheng's soul was at the Fighting Soul Level! It would be nearly impossible for anyone with such a powerful soul be bamboozled by her flirtation skill!</p>

  <p>"What I am doing is not your business!" snapped Zheng grimacing.</p>

  <p>"It's–it's none of my business? The man you injured was my Bloodwood Cliff disciple! Do you really believe you can leave here, unscathed? Are you delusional?" she spat out venomously. A wicked gleam in her eyes, her voice became a purr as she continued,"If you like dreaming that much, why not come dream with me?</p>

  <p>After the wet dream we conjure up, there won't be anything but you, in a state of complete satiated relaxation..." After her proposition, Lady Poison-blood's raunchy laughter filled the air.</p>

  <p>It was obvious to Zheng that her flirtation skill was an unhanded method of sucking the vitality from men, and he was unmoved. He deduced that a wet dream with her would leave a corpse in place of a man.</p>

  <p>Lady Poison-blood's flirtation skill was extremely intoxicating! She could use the skill while laughing. As her sweet, alluring voice flooded the air, the other men present, including Fred, felt their blood boil.</p>

  <p>The effect was more pronounced on the low-level practitioners that were in earshot. Hearing her voice reverberating, the men became flushed and had a glazed, dreamy look in their eyes. As the delirium washed over the men, they stared, unable to think straight, with their mouths hanging open and zombie-like at the beautiful young woman.</p>

  <p>Staring at Lady Poison-blood, Zheng grinned smugly and said,"You remind me of a poem I read. You are an attractive, striking lady, but..."</p>

  <p>"I'm touched by your high praise! Tell you what, I'll make you feel delightful and important."</p>

  <p>"But.... No, I'm not interested in older women. I'm sorry," Zheng annunciated each word slowly. His voice was cold and even.</p>

  <p>What Zheng said stilled Lady Poison-blood's seductive manner, and her beautiful face twisted in rage. Within seconds, she went from a delicate, graceful looking butterfly to a venomous scorpion as wave after wave of malicious aura poured from her.</p>

  <p>"You're nothing more than a boy at the Illuminating Soul Realm. I was gracious and kind, as a way of giving you credit, and you dare to be rude?!" screeched Lady Poison-blood wickedly. "You! Young man, you are courting death!" As the leader of Bloodwood Cliff, Lady Poison-blood was one of the most formidable practitioners in the Central Region, and a junior practitioner of the Illuminating Soul Realm had humiliated her! A spectator could only imagine how infuriated that made her!</p>

  <p>As her malicious aura got closer, Fred's face changed! How could Zheng or he deal with someone at the Virtual Tribulation Realm?</p>

  <p>Fred was a bit of a stickler in many ways. While the members of Mysterious Luna Hall, Bloodwood Cliff, and Ethereal Spirit Sect quietly burned their message runes, Fred did not!</p>

  <p>Thankfully, unbeknownst to anyone, Zheng had the foresight to contact Tia by activating the communication token. He had faith she would arrive soon!</p>

  <p>Even though Lady Poison-blood was intent on slaying Zheng, his back was to the Dragon Soar Arena, and if Zheng flew again, he could lure her into the Genuine Dragon World! If that happened, Lady Poison-blood would be imprisoned for a thousand years because she wasn't a Dragon Lineage Human and had no blood of the Genuine Dragon.</p>

  <p>Additionally, the leader of that Dragon Abyss Palace had given Zheng an amulet. Of course, he would only use that when there was a crisis.</p>

  <p>As he was alert to a possible surprise attack, Zheng's eyes were pinned on Lady Poison-blood! With his current strength, it would be a great test for Zheng to fight someone at the Internal Elixir Realm, so, he knew he needed to remain vigilant facing a master at the Virtual Tribulation Realm! He planned on returning to the Dragon Soar Arena as soon as Lady Poison-blood made her move!</p>

  <p>Just then another old man, dressed in black and wearing a mask, appeared in the sky. His voice boomed as he shouted,"Lady Poison-blood, if your wish is to slaughter this boy, you will have to wait until after I ask him a question!"</p>

  <p>"Seriously? Raven, you're interfering in my affairs again?" shrieked Lady Poison-blood as her face darkened.</p>

  <p>The masked Raven grinned evilly and answered,"It's not my intention to interfere. But, what he knows about the Dragon Soar Arena matters!</p>

  <p>How could I stay away before hearing the secret?"</p>

  <p>"He's my prey though!" argued Lady Poison-blood passionately.</p>

  <p>Raven didn't seem moved by her pleas. "He's the prey of whoever catches him! Is it written across his face that he is yours? He isn't a member of your Bloodwood Cliff!" Raven turned, and staring at Zheng threateningly said,"Boy, I advise you, to come with me and give me the secret of the Dragon Soar Arena. If you do, I promise to give you a quick, clean death, or if you don't, I will brutally torture you! I'll make you regret your birth!"</p>

  <p>The old man before Zheng was a master at the Virtual Tribulation Realm!</p>

  <p>Fred's face paled. At this point, he remembered he needed to inform the hall leader quickly, but before he could reach for his message rune, Zheng whispered,"I already asked for help!"</p>

  <p>Zheng hadn't said anything to Tia, but he did have a communication token, and once it was activated, a sound rang out, nonstop, that would lead Tia straight to Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Okay, good!" Fred replied, becoming a little calmer. His reaction was beyond reproach. After all, he had only reached the ultimate level of the Illuminating Soul Realm, and was not even at the Internal Elixir Realm, which meant, he wasn't a match for these old weirdos at the Virtual Tribulation Realm. In this case, he had to call on the hall leader to save them. However, what would they do if the leaders from Bloodwood Cliff and Black Mountain Sect attacked them now?</p>

  <p>Just as Fred was becoming flustered again, he heard a clear crisp, ethereal yet cold voice.</p>

  <p>"Regret? Do you think our Cloud Hall disciples would regret so easily?"</p>

  <p>Crystal clear snowflakes fell haphazardly from the sky, and an invisible chill quietly spread.</p>

  <p>With steely, sharp eyes, Tia glared at Raven and Lady Poison-blood while she slowly floated down near the Dragon Soar Arena.</p>

  <p>Her strength had grown immensely over the last three months. Her abilities were largely improved. Three months ago, Tia was in the final stage of the Internal Elixir Realm, now though, her strength was at the Virtual Tribulation Realm. Since she was originally at the Virtual Tribulation Realm, it wasn't a breakthrough.</p>

  <p>"Yudie Ning, do you believe you can intimidate me because you are back up at the Virtual Tribulation Realm? You know, you're still no match against me, right?" shouted Raven frostily.</p>

  <p>'Oh yeah, Tia's full name is Yudie Ning, ' Zheng reminded himself silently.</p>

  <p>Yudie sneered, and chuckling in a low tone, she stated,"True, I haven't finished practicing the Sutra of Empyrean Goddess, and my cultivation hasn't fully recovered, yet. You're not afraid of me, but..." Yudie dramatically paused before she continued,"Are you afraid of my master?"</p>

  <p>At Yudie's words, the color drained from Lady Poison-blood's and Raven's faces.</p>

  <p>Lady Poison-blood, Raven and Yudie were both leaders of grade four sects. However, the Black Mountain Sect and Bloodwood Cliff were ordinary grade four sects, while the Cloud Hall was an elite, top grade four sect!</p>

  <p>There was a gap between the elite top sect and ordinary ones.</p>

  <p>It wasn't Yudie but her master that made the Cloud Hall the elite, top grade four sect! However, her master had gone into seclusion and abdicated. She had little involvement in the Cloud Hall's day to day affairs and appointed Yudie, as the leader in her absence.</p>

  <p>When Yudie finished practicing the Sutra of Empyrean Goddess, she would be able to promote the Cloud Hall to a higher level. Then, the Cloud Hall would be the second grade five sect in the Central Region.</p>

  <p>Lady Poison-blood and Raven might not be afraid of Yudie, but they didn't dare offend her master.</p>

  <p>"Even if your master is here, you can't take Zheng. He's part of a major event that involves the Dragon Soar Arena operations. He has no choice but to share the secrets with us!" said a new arrival as he led a group toward them. They were from the Ethereal Spirit Sect, and it was clear they had come on foot.</p>

  <p>When Yudie saw them approaching, she furrowed her brow line.</p>
