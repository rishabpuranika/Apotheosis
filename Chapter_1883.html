  <p>
</p>

  <p>At Kaydan's question, Luo Luo Zheng snorted and threw Isaiah several dozens of feet away. "What absurd rules you have in the Skyland race! You should ask him what has happened!" Luo Luo Zheng growled.</p>

  <p>He had used the hidden strength he possessed when he threw the boy on the ground. Isaiah tried to soar into the sky but as he made a move to stand, his legs buckled under him and he fell on his back once more.</p>

  <p>"How dare you!" Isaiah's father, Roy, growled when he saw his son be thrown like a dead dog. He started to march towards Luo Luo Zheng when he heard Kaydan's cold commanding voice.</p>

  <p>"Roy," the leader said.</p>

  <p>Roy was no fool. He knew Kaydan very well and he knew the man would only act like this in front of a person with remarkable background.</p>

  <p>Just who was this Luo Luo Zheng guy, really? Surely, being a flame-proof warrior wasn't enough to earn the respect of Kaydan, was it?</p>

  <p>As far as he knew, warriors of the six great races in the entire Divine Refinement Forbidden Land did not act polite towards martial artists from other races. This was, after all, the territory of the six great races.</p>

  <p>Even someone like Quentin would have to pay a price in order to gain the Skyland race's favor.</p>

  <p>He was curious as to where Luo Luo Zheng came from.</p>

  <p>"Isaiah," Kaydan turned to the boy after he had gotten up. "Tell us what happened. How did you offend our esteemed guest?"</p>

  <p>When they heard Kaydan refer to Luo Luo Zheng as an "esteemed guest", Roy, Isaiah, and everyone else's hearts began to sink. Even the warriors from the divine land were stunned.</p>

  <p>This group of warriors from the divine land had been trying to gain the Skyland race's favor for years now and not a single one of them had come close to being an esteemed guest.</p>

  <p>How could Luo Luo Zheng, a mere secondary creature, be called an esteemed guest?! They were all astonished.</p>

  <p>Lucille, Kurt, and Lone who were standing behind Luo Luo Zheng looked at each other in shock.</p>

  <p>Before, they had been worried the Skyland race would take revenge on Luo Luo Zheng. But now, that worry had vanished into thin air. This was Kaydan, the leader of the Skyland race, speaking!</p>

  <p>What in the world did Luo Luo Zheng do to make the Skyland race's leader treat him so nicely?</p>

  <p>Lucille couldn't help but sigh. She had worked hard to enter the Skyland race within a certain time period in order to absorb as much Pristine Life Vitality as she could. She had always felt fortunate that she was fast and lucky enough but seeing Luo Luo Zheng now, the achievements she worked so hard to attain felt nothing but a joke.</p>

  <p>Back in the Illusion Battlefield, Lucille had been defeated by Luo Luo Zheng. And perhaps she had been unwilling to accept the result at the time because they were all Godly Geniuses and there was always a chance to improve their strength. In the future, who could say for sure who would beat who? But now, after seeing what just happened, Lucille was absolutely positive that Luo Luo Zheng was indeed stronger than her.</p>

  <p>The same thoughts ran through Kurt's and Lone's heads.</p>

  <p>How could Isaiah tell the truth? After he was thrown out by Luo Luo Zheng, blood and adrenaline surged through his veins and the tide in his inner world surged. Right now, he felt extremely uncomfortable and being put in the spot by their leader was not helping at all. "Sir," he immediately said. "I was just acting according to the rules of the race forbidding martial artists from fighting. Luo Luo Zheng and the others were fighting for the territory of the Tidal Surge. I was only doing my duty to stop him and expel him from the Skyland race. I didn't expect him to start attacking me..."</p>

  <p>Hearing his son's argument, Roy turned to their leader and pointed to Luo Luo Zheng with an accusing finger. "My son is only following the race's rules so he wasn't at fault. Sir, I hope you will uphold justice and punish this fellow as is written in the law!"</p>

  <p>Kaydan frowned. He didn't believe Isaiah's words for even a second but he had to hear all sides of the story. "Our respected friend Luo Luo Zheng," he said.</p>

  <p>"Is what Isaiah said true?"</p>

  <p>All the martial artists present had witnessed what happened between the two and knew Isaiah was lying. They also felt that Kaydan would be more willing to believe Luo Luo Zheng over Isaiah; perhaps it was because he didn't want to offend Luo Luo Zheng. Ultimately, they knew that if Luo Luo Zheng were to explain himself then neither Roy nor Isaiah would be able to do anything to him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng turned to Isaiah and laughed, a slight air of arrogance radiating from him. "He's right! It's exactly as Isaiah says. I wonder how you are going to deal with this."</p>

  <p>Once again, everyone was stunned as Luo Luo Zheng openly admitted to Isaiah's lies so easily.</p>

  <p>"Is he serious?"</p>

  <p>"Why did he play along with Isaiah's lie instead of telling the truth?"</p>

  <p>"What is he thinking...?"</p>

  <p>In their opinion, Luo Luo Zheng had done nothing wrong. It was no secret that Isaiah was biased towards the martial artists of the divine land. In fact, everyone, even Kaydan, was aware of this. And some of the rules were even set by Kaydan!</p>

  <p>Kaydan was always well-informed; how could he not know that Isaiah was lying?</p>

  <p>In this Tidal Surge, there weren't a lot of excitement that could happen so it wasn't difficult to figure out the whole thing.</p>

  <p>Kaydan asked Luo Luo Zheng for his side because he wanted him to defend himself and give his reasons for his action. Then, everyone would have a way out of the situation. He would punish Isaiah for appearance's sake and the matter would be settled.</p>

  <p>He didn't think Luo Luo Zheng would not defend himself and instead second Isaiah's statement.</p>

  <p>"Aleyna, did you see that?" Han Liusu suddenly said to the woman beside her. "This man is a thousand times better than that Quentin. I just want you to see that there are a lot of good men in the world. That Quentin is a clown!"</p>

  <p>The woman in purple was Aleyna Han, Liusu's younger sister.</p>

  <p>She had momentarily forgotten her conflict with her sister as she looked at the scene with confusion. "Why did he play along with what Isaiah has said?"</p>

  <p>Han Liusu only smiled. "Because he doesn't care."</p>

  <p>"Doesn't care about what?" Aleyna Han asked again, not getting what her sister meant.</p>

  <p>"He doesn't care whether he's justified or not so it doesn't matter if he tells what really happened or not. No matter what happens, he knows Kaydan will let him go," Han Liusu explained. "This so-called justice is only a line that the powerful ones draw for the weak ones. The weak ones are confined by the line while the strong ones... ignore it!"</p>

  <p>Compared to her sister, Alayna Han was simple-minded. She was, after all, still a young girl fantasizing about love and romance. However, while she didn't understand everything that Han Liusu had said, she got something from it, and now she looked at the young man with fresh eyes.</p>

  <p>Simply put, Luo Luo Zheng was making it clear to Isaiah that he was bullying him and he was disobeying the rules. Isaiah couldn't do anything to Luo Luo Zheng after all.</p>

  <p>When he heard Luo Zheng's answer, Kaydan wished for lightning to strike Luo Luo Zheng as soon as he stepped out of the place.</p>

  <p>This fellow was determined to make things difficult for him!</p>

  <p>"How dare you!" Roy bellowed. "Since you admit it, it's clear you hold no value for your life. Perhaps you'd want me to end it for you?" Roy didn't think too much about what was coming out of his mouth. Luo Luo Zheng admitting to it was him courting death, and Roy was only willing to send him on his way, Roy's outburst however, only caused more trouble for Kaydan as he was looking for an excuse to let Luo Luo Zheng go. It would be best if he could both keep the rules of the Skyland race and not cause discomfort for Luo Luo Zheng. He was well aware that Luo Luo Zheng was not a person to be trifled with.</p>

  <p>And yet, Roy kept adding fuel to the flame. "Roy," Kaydan said, his expression dark. "Take your son and leave Tidal Surge!"</p>

  <p>"W-why...?" Roy asked in disbelief. No matter what, he was still an elder of the Skyland race!</p>

  <p>"Roy, the leader asked you to leave so it's best to do what he says. If you have anything to say, you can say it later," someone spoke up.</p>

  <p>Seeing several elders wink at him, it dawned on Roy that the matter wasn't simple. Gritting his teeth, he turned around and glared at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>And if looks could kill, Luo Luo Zheng would be dead already. With a last sneer, he grabbed his son and flew away.</p>

  <p>But even Roy and Isaiah had left, Kaydan was still in a dilemma. He even wanted to grit his teeth and turn away to leave all the awkwardness behind. Fortunately, there just wasn't a lack of calculating eyes in this world.</p>

  <p>"Sir!" a warrior from another race suddenly jumped up and called. "I witnessed the entirety of what just happened here and it was definitely because Quentin provoked first that Luo Luo Zheng fought back in anger! Isaiah was partial towards Quentin which led to the conflict with Luo Luo Zheng..."</p>

  <p>As he listened to the man explain, Kaydan couldn't help but nod and relax his expression. "So that's how it is. Isaiah was at fault and our respected friend Luo Luo Zheng has been wronged! I'll be sure to deal with Isaiah later!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng decided to let the matter drop. From the beginning, Kaydan had been on his side and was trying hard to accommodate his every need. Besides, Kaydan had nothing to do with this. If Luo Luo Zheng continued to cause trouble for the man, it would be too much already.</p>

  <p>As the commotion ended, Kaydan was ready to leave. However, Kaydan thought of something and turned to the man from the crowd and asked for his name.</p>

  <p>"Haroon Han, sir!" the warrior cupped his fists and replied happily.</p>

  <p>The warriors of other races cultivating in the Tidal Surge however, looked disappointed. They had all witnessed the scuffle but only Haroon Han had spoken up to help Kaydan. This person would definitely be given special treatment in the future when he cultivated in the Skyland race.</p>

  <p>Kaydan was about to lead the people in the area to leave when suddenly, the black water started to surge!</p>
