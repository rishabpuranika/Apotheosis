<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Renzo and Camilla stood on either side of Randy, while Barry stood behind him.</p>

  <p>'Is Lord Randy trying to join forces with the others and fight alongside them?' Luo Zheng thought. Luo Zheng glanced at the group curiously. Since he had already agreed to join Randy's team, he was supposed to be integrated into it. As he thought this, his figure flashed as he charged towards Randy.</p>

  <p>Before Luo Zheng could even get close, Renzo extended his hand and waves of life vitality which were colored faintly purple surged out of his body and kept circling Randy swiftly and constantly.</p>

  <p>Camila smiled. She waved a slender hand and a thin curtain of light appeared immediately. When Luo Zheng rushed towards the light curtain, he felt everything around him, including his own speed, slow down.</p>

  <p>'It's the Time Law! And right now, all three of them are in complete support of Lord Randy!' Luo Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>Randy's figure flashed suddenly and appeared behind Luo Zheng. With a flip of his hand, he had placed a sharp dagger at Zheng's neck. It was a combined effort of several people, but it looked like they had done a perfect job.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng was swift to react. Camilla's comprehension of the Time Law wasn't deep, and with a slight twist of his body, he slipped away from Randy's grip like a fish. A cocky, confident smile found its way to his face as he reached out, ready to snatch the dagger from Randy's hand.</p>

  <p>In that instant, Luo Zheng felt a great tremor within his mind, as if an axe with the power to split a mountain apart had slashed through his head. Barry had launched a soul attack on him!</p>

  <p>Anyone else probably wouldn't have been able to block this soul attack after these multiple attacks. Even if they managed to block it with a lot of effort, they'd probably have become distracted. And how could they block Randy's attack when distracted?</p>

  <p>But Barry hadn't realized or even imagined that Zheng's soul had almost entered the Jasper Fighting Soul Realm. The attack felt more like an itchy spot for Luo Zheng than a powerful spirit attack.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, however, didn't want to reveal his full strength. He feigned a groan as he leaned forward, once again finding Randy's dagger at his neck.</p>

  <p>Randy smiled smugly, thinking he had defeated Luo Zheng. He wanted to prove to Luo Zheng that their combined strength was far greater than Zheng's individual strength.</p>

  <p>Randy hadn't expected that the four of them combined would still not be a match for Luo Zheng. But since they had only come here to spar, Luo Zheng didn't want to reveal too much of his strength.</p>

  <p>"Sweet little Randy! Kill him!" A proud smile appeared on Camilla's face when she saw that Randy had managed to restrain Luo Zheng. It was still obvious that her grudge against Luo Zheng hadn't disappeared because of his previous offence.</p>

  <p>Randy, on the other hand, only wanted to show Luo Zheng the power of a team and didn't pay heed to Camilla's words. He smiled as he took the dagger away from Zheng's neck.</p>

  <p>"There isn't much time left. Once we enter the Feather Holy Sea, we will face a lot of competition. If you have the time, you can try to practice with Camilla and the others and break in. The five of us must obtain the best results on this trip to the secret land!" Randy said, his eyes gleaming with great anticipation.</p>

  <p>The crown prince had always suppressed him and he had always looked for an opportunity to turn the situation around.</p>

  <p>Although the crown prince was powerful, he wasn't powerful enough to do everything. If Randy could gain his father's favor, the crown prince would definitely restrain himself at Randy's rising influence.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded. After all, Randy's goal didn't contradict his own. If he could achieve his goal and help Randy at the same time, he would not back out of doing so.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stayed in the Jade Martial House to practice with the other three.</p>

  <p>He slowly familiarized himself with these three people. Renzo was docile and easygoing while Barry was stiff and not very talkative.</p>

  <p>Camilla, on the other hand, was always cheerful and carefree.</p>

  <p>With his increasing understanding of the techniques they practiced, Luo Zheng now knew why Randy had chosen the three of them.</p>

  <p>Neither Renzo, Barry, nor Camilla were good at attacking. It looked like the cultivation techniques that they specialized in were all about auxiliary skills.</p>

  <p>For example, the Time Law that Camilla had cultivated was only able to slow down the opponent's speed. When she displayed the Time Law, the opponent would become incomparably slow for just an instant. And that instant would be enough for the opponent to lose their life.</p>

  <p>Renzo was adept at creating many obstacles for his opponents. And Barry cultivated a refinement technique that could disturb one's mind.</p>

  <p>Their path of implementing martial arts was completely different from that in the Central region or even the Sea God Continent.</p>

  <p>In the Central Region and the Sea God Continent, people attached great importance to individual strength. They rarely cooperated with others.</p>

  <p>If the warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm worked together, the overall effect could be quite overwhelming. But if five or six powerful masters at the Soul Sea Realm collaborated with each other, the result would be unimaginable! An individual master at the Sea God Continent, like Amber, was very powerful. But if five powerful masters of the Soul Sea Realm on the Sea God Continent fought against five powerful masters of the Soul Sea Realm in a divine kingdom, it would be more likely that the masters of the divine kingdom would win. Because they were better at the art of cooperation.</p>

  <p>In this hall, when Luo Zheng cultivated with them, they would occasionally communicate with each other, asking and clarifying each other's doubts about the martial arts.</p>

  <p>But it was Luo Zheng who asked the others for advice most of the time.</p>

  <p>The inheritances of the divine kingdoms were much richer than those of the Central Region. What was more, a considerable part of their inheritances came from the human race of the Upper World.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Luo Zheng didn't know which force of the Upper World's human race their inheritance came from.</p>

  <p>As time passed, Randy also became busier. Since he was busy with matters of the royal house, he rarely appeared in the martial house.</p>

  <p>Three months later, the Jade Martial House had gathered all the martial artists who had passed the test, including Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had conjectured that the Jade Martial House had probably gathered them because the Feather Holy Sea was about to open. The Feather Holy Sea was like a treasury of the four divine kingdoms, at a similar position as the Dark Nether Cave in the Sea God Continent. He didn't know how they were going to send the warriors into the Feather Holy Sea.</p>

  <p>Camilla, Barry, and Renzo, however, weren't there. They belonged to Randy's forces, so they hadn't participated in the test. They would probably set out with Randy.</p>
