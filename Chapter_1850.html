</p>

  <p>When compared to a warrior of the same level as he, Zheng's physical body was obviously much stronger than most. In terms of his body's capacity though, he sometimes found himself facing certain limitations. Now was one of those times.</p>

  <p>The numerous strength source surrounding Zheng was constantly and continuously absorbed by his body. The strength filled him in the deepest places of his inner self, including his bones, muscles, organs, and spine.</p>

  <p>This form of strength absorption created an ultimate increase of power within Zheng. It was as though his body and mind were always alert and crystal clear. He felt inexhaustible, invincible and most of all, Zheng felt abundant.</p>

  <p>At the moment though, the strength source to be absorbed was far greater in amount than Zheng had ever faced before. His body worked hard, the numerous strength filling him more and more. It didn't take too long before the feeling of wonderful abundance began to transform into the harsh sensation of being full.</p>

  <p>And he recognized the feeling of fullness. He knew what it meant, too. It meant his capacity of absorption had nearly reached its limit - and yet, so much strength source remained.</p>

  <p>This sensation had overcome him once before, when he had borrowed the dragon scales' power. With so much strength to be contained within one single person, Zheng's body couldn't bear the load. He had stopped just in time back then.</p>

  <p>Zheng equally knew that if he forcibly absorbed the strength source, his body wouldn't hold and would easily disintegrate. Of course, this was something he had to avoid at all costs. But what to do now?</p>

  <p>Staring out at the strength source before him, Zheng realized he had absorbed less than a ten thousandth of it all. He was drenched with a stressed sweat and felt overwhelmingly discouraged. His feeling was comparable to a person leaving a treasure mountain empty handed; the problem was, there were simply too many treasures to choose from.</p>

  <p>"The strength source here can help you break through the Eight Path Platforms. This is a one of a kind opportunity, so make the most of it..."</p>

  <p>A faint voice spoke from the depths of Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>Was this the cyan dragon reaching out to him? It had to be!</p>

  <p>After the nine Genuine Dragons had been awakened, they had since maintained their silence in his mind. So much so that even when he tried reaching out or speaking to them, they wouldn't respond. This was different though. Zheng knew with certitude that the cyan dragon had spoken.</p>

  <p>'They really don't want me to waste this opportunity, ' Zheng thought to himself.</p>

  <p>Zheng hadn't been refining his body for very long, nor had he gotten very far. At the time, he had only managed to forge one Path Platform. And he had had the help of the Cloud-chasing Lion's bone, at that.</p>

  <p>Now the cyan dragon had spoken his word which had wiped Zheng free of any doubts or insecurities. This time, he didn't hesitate.</p>

  <p>Sure, it was true that these nine Genuine Dragons had other intentions, of which he had been warned. Zheng still chose to believe them, though. He knew this was important.</p>

  <p>Now that the power had pierced directly through the center of his eyebrows and had hit his mind, a torrent of strength source washed over him. The power was so strong and unexpected that it instantly destroyed the Path Platform forged with the Cloud-chasing Lion's bone.</p>

  <p>"Whoa! What the hell! What's going on?" Momentarily stunned, Zheng let out a deep breath and regained his composure. He had definitely not been expecting something so intense!</p>

  <p>While he floated, a bold and crystal clear smile was transmitted from the depths of his mind. Now, it was the red dragon's voice he heard. "Our big brother has taken a stand," the voice boomed. "Thus, I shall act as an obedient little brother!" It now became obvious to Zheng that what was happening here was definitely an extraordinary opportunity. This wouldn't happen twice, that he was also sure of it. If he missed out on it, then he might never get his chance again.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes caught something moving just above his level of sight. He lifted his eyes only slightly and saw the complex pattern of steam emanating from his forehead. Now that the red dragon had spoken his word, Zheng was now empowered with a spiritual force.</p>

  <p>"Now, young man, you must follow the steam and guide the strength source. Strength, that is extremely pure and without fault. In its natural form, it is countless times better than the Cloud-chasing Lion's bone!</p>

  <p>Trust me, a Path Platform forged from this strength source is nothing the Cloud-chasing Lion could ever compare to. Do as I say."</p>

  <p>Without a moment's hesitation, Zheng closed his eyes and immediately obeyed what the red dragon had told him to do.</p>

  <p>Putting all his concentration toward the strength flow, vortexes soon began to appear. They formed in Zheng's hands, his legs, head, chest, back and even his cinnabar field! What was happening now?</p>

  <p>Frantically, and thankfully for Zheng, the vortexes that he had just formed began to absorb the strength source, as if doing it for him! Zheng felt a sudden and enormous sense of relief.</p>

  <p>On his own, before the dragons had reached out to him, Zheng had easily absorbed over ten thousand drops of the strength source. Now though, the eight vortexes he created were each capable of absorbing just as much if not more than his own body could. He watched them, completely amazed at how powerful he had become.</p>

  <p>Despite the astonishing work the vortexes created, there was too much strength source surrounded Zheng, and too much energy remained. A lake as large as this one simply had too many absorbable drops of strength source.</p>

  <p>Zheng took the time to assess the situation. Currently, he felt perfectly fine.</p>

  <p>Having absorbed a hundred thousand drops of strength source himself now had virtually no consequence. And yet before, he had felt so full!</p>

  <p>Zheng brought his focus and strength back to absorbing the strength source.</p>

  <p>Path Platforms, sparkling and enticing with a dazzling shine, appeared at the opening of the eight vortexes.</p>

  <p>The Eight Path Platforms of body refiner often twisted off and formed different shapes, but most of them were milky white Path Platforms. This was because most body refiners would form their own Path Platforms based on the rare white bones. However, Zheng's Path Platforms were seven-colored.</p>

  <p>This strength source was so enormous, so great, it was indescribable.</p>

  <p>Assuredly, no such strength source could exist within the universe. If something of the kind did exist, then it was no doubt much, much smaller in size. And of course, there wouldn't be half as many drops of strength source to be absorbed!</p>

  <p>It would be completely impossible for an ordinary warrior to find such a large amount of strength source. Even if Liusu's brother got really lucky or had great karma going for him, there was no way he would ever find such an amazing amount of strength source. In other words, her brother couldn't even compare himself with Zheng's gaining.</p>

  <p>Straightly put, Zheng had to spend every drop of strength source he could muster in order to build his Eight Path Platforms and form his most solid foundation.</p>
