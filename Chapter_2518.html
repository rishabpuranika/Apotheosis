</p>

  <p>The Lethal Fire Magma could just burn down anything, but the big black pot floating above it looked intact.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Lorena jumped up and stood upright on the pot, looking outside of the cave.</p>

  <p>Although the divine land was huge, it was still too small for the Holy Beings. They could easily reach the remotest corners of the land in a short span of time.</p>

  <p>Lorena was well aware that as long as she went unnoticed, she was safe.</p>

  <p>Once she exposed herself, there would be no way out.</p>

  <p>Although she had some tricks up her sleeve, her slowness might bring her down. She had no choice but to send Zheng away.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>Soon a figure flew over. She realized that it was Nicholas.</p>

  <p>When Nicholas saw Lorena standing on the pot, his astonished face lit up. "Lorena!" He exclaimed in delight.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Instantly, a dozen figures appeared behind Nicholas.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings were slightly stunned, seeing Lorena. That was when it struck them Nicholas' purpose.</p>

  <p>It turned out that he came for this woman.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings started to talk in whispers.</p>

  <p>Once they became Holy Beings, they controlled the universes, so much so that they could create lives and other objects prevailing in the universes, as per their liking.</p>

  <p>For them, women were of little importance. That was why they were stunned that Nicholas could be so obsessed with a woman.</p>

  <p>However, this woman was no ordinary one. She possessed a special status. If they caught her, probably many of their problems could be solved.</p>

  <p>After all, it was a good sign for the alliance of wealthy clans.</p>

  <p>Lorena glanced at Nicholas coldly and curled her lips. A cold smile appeared on her face as she said, "You've been looking for me for a long time. Am I right?"</p>

  <p>Nicholas nodded in agreement.</p>

  <p>For years he tried to locate Lorena, but was unsuccessful.</p>

  <p>Hence, he came hastily, as soon as he got the news from Hamish.</p>

  <p>"Your talents and skills are still a bit weak. Even if someone taught you those, there is still the Sea of Truth for you to cross," Lorena said lightly.</p>

  <p>Nicholas smiled hearing her words. "I'm just a step away from it. Very soon I will cross the Sea of Truth and reach the Other Shore Realm!"</p>

  <p>Clark, Murphy, Jeremiah and other Holy Beings were astonished at Nicholas' claim.</p>

  <p>Although they were all loyal to Nicholas, they each had their own selfish motives. All of them vied for an equally strong personality.</p>

  <p>More or less, they all had some abridged Truths of Godly Ways.</p>

  <p>However, these abridged articles were not enough to master the Truths of Godly Ways, let alone cross the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>Since ages, there had been no one who succeeded in becoming an expert of the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>It had always been a far reaching hope for the Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>That was why they were all stunned when Nicholas claimed he was close to success.</p>

  <p>Although Nicholas was now strong, he was still at par with other Holy Beings present. If he really reached the Other Shore Realm, they would have to look up to him in the future. It was something that they were really not looking forward to.</p>

  <p>"That's wonderful! Congratulations!" Lorena said with a cold smile.</p>

  <p>Even if Nicholas heard her sarcasm behind her compliment, he did not react to it. Instead, he said, "You can go back with me. After I reach the Other Shore Realm, I will take you back to the Source World."</p>

  <p>"What did you say? Take me back to the Source World?" Lorena sneered at him. "And then what? Join the Yellow Emperor Guards?"</p>

  <p>Nicholas' smile froze when he heard her words.</p>

  <p>He was well aware about the dispute between the Nine Li people and the Yellow Emperor Guards.</p>

  <p>Actually to be fair, so far his progress had been successful only because of the support of the Yellow Emperor Guards.</p>

  <p>"What kind of person are you? Do you realize that you are merely a pawn for them?" Lorena countered him. Her hair which was a thousand feet long danced wildly in the wind.</p>

  <p>Nicholas' eyes flashed for a second. He controlled himself and tried again to drive sense into her. "As far as I know, your race's day is over in the Source World, and your only hope of sanctuary in the divine land has long been destroyed. There is no need for you to be so stubborn."</p>

  <p>"Crack! Crack! Crack!"</p>

  <p>Several cracks appeared inside the cave, and soon Lethal Fire Magma popped out of each of them.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings were also equally stunned when they witnessed this explosion.</p>

  <p>Although they wouldn't really die because of the existence of universes, they would have to pay a heavy price to recover.</p>

  <p>Naturally, none of them wanted to be affected by the Lethal Fire Magma.</p>

  <p>"None of the nine tribes of my race is willing to live in humiliation.</p>

  <p>Maybe this will be the last battle of my race, and nobody knows who will emerge as the winner. Maybe even I won't be alive to see that day, but whatever the consequences, we would never keep our dignity and pride at stake! Chaos Ancient God, please bless my race!"</p>

  <p>Her voice turned cold and there was a coquettish and charming smile on her beautiful face.</p>

  <p>She waved her hand, and a strong wave veered around her.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings became alarmed as they knew what was coming next.</p>

  <p>"The space is locked by her."</p>

  <p>"We can't move an inch!"</p>

  <p>"What does she want from us?"</p>

  <p>Lorena glanced at the Holy Beings and said lightly, "All of you are going to die with me!"</p>

  <p>"Rumble!"</p>

  <p>The cave started to collapse.</p>

  <p>The Lethal Fire Magma poured in with force and surged in all directions.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, the Holy Beings turned deadly pale.</p>

  <p>"This woman really wants us to die with her!"</p>

  <p>"Back off!"</p>

  <p>"We can't! There is also Lethal Fire Magma behind us!"</p>

  <p>Since Lorena moved the cave to the lowest layer, she had prepared for the worst.</p>

  <p>At the moment, she locked the space within the cave and led the Lethal Fire Magma in to take the Holy Beings with her down to the bottom of hell.</p>

  <p>She might not be able to truly kill these Holy Beings, but it would take them a long time to recover. That way, she could buy more time for Zheng, Yan, and Harold.</p>

  <p>Without any hesitation, Lorena tapped her tiptoe gently in the pot and jumped into the Lethal Fire Magma.</p>

  <p>However, just as she was about to jump into the Lethal Fire Magma, Nicholas had rushed over towards her.</p>

  <p>"Humph!" Lorena sneered coldly. Her hair shot towards Nicholas like arrows.</p>

  <p>When Nicholas' hand touched the air, an invisible energy turned into a shield and protected him in front.</p>

  <p>"Tuk-tuk."</p>

  <p>Lorena's arrows were unable to penetrate the shield.</p>

  <p>At that time, Nicholas reached out to grab her arm.</p>

  <p>Lorena continued to smirk at Nicholas.</p>

  <p>Suddenly her upper torso, barring her head, turned into brown mud, which clung to Nicholas' body like an octopus.</p>

  <p>"If it weren't for you, my husband might have succeeded." Lorena, with only her head left, stared at Nicholas with hatred. "That is why I am going to kill you today!"</p>

  <p>The mud flowed around Nicholas and towards his elixir field.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of the True Gods of the divine land, the Holy Beings were indeed indestructible, unless their universes were destroyed.</p>

  <p>But that didn't mean Lorena couldn't kill the Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>In fact, she could cut off the connection between Holy Beings and their universes.</p>

  <p>"You!"</p>

  <p>Only then did Nicholas realize that he had fallen into a huge crisis.</p>
