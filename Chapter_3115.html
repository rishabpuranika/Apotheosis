<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3115 Confusion </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As Mary and Bella saw this, disdain emerged in their gazes.</p>

  <p>In their eyes, this didn't at all seem like a desperate fight put up by people struggling to survive.</p>

  <p>If their opponents were strong enough, they would take them seriously.</p>

  <p>But their opponents' cultivation levels were so ridiculously low that they did not deserve their attention at all.</p>

  <p>"They have already given up on themselves. Let's make our move." Bella stretched out her arm and gently waved it in the air. Another golden ball was formed out of nowhere.</p>

  <p>At the same time, golden flames rose from Mary's wings and flew towards the array, leaving a curved fiery trail in the air, which was a sight to behold.</p>

  <p>"Everyone, let's get started!"</p>

  <p>The green light columns narrowed, and then condensed on the group's long swords.</p>

  <p>The moment the light started to condense on everyone's swords, Luo Zheng quietly shook his hand. In no time, the fake Soaring Snake Sword in his hand was already replaced with the real one.</p>

  <p>This was the way he conjured his Soaring Snake Sword if he had to use it.</p>

  <p>He had spent two hours practicing it and even placed a small hidden array on the sword so that no one could see how he changed the sword.</p>

  <p>Once the Soaring Snake Sword in his hand was successfully changed, green light started to condense on the blade.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the truth aura in his body flowed into the Soaring Snake Sword in an unending stream and was continuously absorbed by the array.</p>

  <p>"Nine-Sword Strike! Go!"</p>

  <p>At this moment, Cailen had put down the array plate in his hand. He was determined to fight to the death, so there was no need to change the array anymore.</p>

  <p>While he shook his sword, everyone else also lifted theirs fiercely to the air.</p>

  <p>Sizzle!</p>

  <p>Nine green rays of sword radiance rose from the ground, gathered together, and formed a huge green sword.</p>

  <p>Everything went just as Cailen had expected.</p>

  <p>In the next second, however, something astonishing happened.</p>

  <p>Eight of the nine sword radiance rays within the giant green sword all had remarkable power. After all, weapon refiners' swords were of high levels, and no one would be foolish enough to hide their strength when they were hovering between life and death.</p>

  <p>But the last one was thin and curvy. It was just like a little intelligent snake wiggling inside the green sword.</p>

  <p>"What's that?" Cailen was taken aback.</p>

  <p>The little snake swallowed all the other rays of sword radiance. It grew more and more powerful with each ray it swallowed.</p>

  <p>"Is it a weapon soul?" a weapon refiner from the Taiyi Heaven Palace blurted out.</p>

  <p>"How is that possible? What the Nine Edges Heaven Slaughtering Array sets in motion is sword radiance. It's impossible for a weapon soul to enter the array." Ableson shook his head.</p>

  <p>"What do you think it is then?"</p>

  <p>Weapon souls were not something rare. Every weapon refiner present could easily refine one.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, just as its name suggested, a weapon soul was a soul. The sword radiance in the array, on the other hand, was pure energy. No matter how powerful a soul was, it would turn into ashes if it entered the array.</p>

  <p>These weapon refiners were all seasoned people, but they unexpectedly could not tell what it was at a glance.</p>

  <p>To put it mildly, even if it was a weapon soul, what kind of weapon soul could give off such an oppressive vibe?</p>

  <p>Before they could regain their composure, the sword radiance inside the green sword had been completely devoured by that little snake.</p>

  <p>Only the curvy snake was left within the huge green sword.</p>

  <p>Soon afterward, under the little snake's control, the green sword flew away at a lightning speed.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>On the other side, Mary was also rapidly approaching the array, but before she could make a move, a giant green sword that had a little snake in it emerged in her line of sight.</p>

  <p>The snake had two soybean-sized, emotionless eyes. For some reason, Mary felt that it had an extremely strong dangerous feel to it.</p>

  <p>She subconsciously flapped her wings and flew backward. The divine flames covering her body burned even fiercer.</p>

  <p>But by the time she realized the danger, it was already too late.</p>

  <p>The green sword was much faster than her. In the blink of an eye, it was already right in front of her.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The last thing she saw before her vision went dark was her abdomen and head getting pierced by the tip of the huge sword. Before she knew it, her body was already cut in half by the huge sword.</p>

  <p>Her body temperature was high, and her blood was always boiling.</p>

  <p>Now that she died, the two halves of her body had completely been engulfed by the golden flames before they even reached the ground.</p>

  <p>What happened to Mary completely took Bella by surprise.</p>

  <p>She didn't even have the time to hurl the golden ball in her hand. She just threw it away casually as she fled.</p>

  <p>She flapped her wings, turned into a golden light, and zoomed away.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, the green sword was obviously several times faster than her.</p>

  <p>In a flash, it had covered the distance of several thousand feet between them.</p>

  <p>Slash!</p>

  <p>With a slash from the green sword, Bella's body also turned into two masses of flames that burned fiercely.</p>

  <p>The green sword floated in the air for a while before it gradually dispersed.</p>

  <p>The little snake within the sword also disappeared without a trace.</p>

  <p>The people inside the Nine Edges Heaven Slaughtering Array were all dumbfounded, standing frozen as if they had just seen a ghost.</p>

  <p>They looked at each other and saw the shock in each other's eyes.</p>

  <p>Once Cailen snapped out of his stunned state, he looked at Luo Zheng and fixated his gaze on the Soaring Snake Sword in Luo Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>The other weapon refiners followed suit.</p>

  <p>Just now when Luo Zheng finished brandishing the Soaring Snake Sword, he had stealthily put it into his space ring and took out the replacement. What they were seeing now was nothing but the fake sword the Su Clan made.</p>

  <p>In fact, Luo Zheng himself was also shocked by what happened.</p>

  <p>The Imperial Sword Seal and the Nine Edges Heaven Slaughtering Array seemed to have completely different effects.</p>

  <p>Was it because of the difference between the arrays?</p>

  <p>Or was it the Snake Spirit in the Soaring Snake Sword that controlled the effect?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng knew little about this Grand Nature Treasure, and he had yet to talk to the Snake Spirit.</p>

  <p>"The weapon soul? It was a snake!"</p>

  <p>"Is his sword really made by the Su Clan?"</p>

  <p>"Sir, could you please show us your sword?"</p>

  <p>It was impossible for a primary Profound Blood Treasure to release such a terrifying power, so the weapon refiners felt it was very strange.</p>

  <p>The confusion had even dissipated the joy of escaping death. Logically speaking, since the crisis had not been resolved, they should run away.</p>

  <p>However, everyone only thought about dispelling the doubt they had over this matter.</p>

  <p>"You mean this sword?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng raised the fake Soaring Snake Sword gently and handed it to Cailen.</p>

  <p>Cailen turned the sword over and over, spending a while observing it. When he spotted the mark on the hilt, he handed it to one of his younger brothers and said, "This sword was made by you. Take a look."</p>

  <p>His brother took the sword and examined it for a while. Baffled, he said, "It was indeed made by me, but it's just a fake sword."</p>

  <p>"Was the weapon soul not formed by the sword?" a weapon refiner from the Taiyi Heaven Palace said with a puzzled face.</p>

  <p>Cailen shook his head and said, "Absolutely not."</p>

  <p>He returned the sword to Luo Zheng, glanced at him with an extremely complicated expression, and then said, "It seems that one of us has an amazing magic weapon. Whoever it is, since he doesn't want to show it to us, we don't have to ask further. However, we have to thank him for using the array to save our lives. Now, we'd better leave here as soon as possible."</p>
