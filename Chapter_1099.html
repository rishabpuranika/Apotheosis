<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1099 The Battle Began </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Where there were people, there was also struggle. The four great divine kingdoms were closely related and mutually dependent on each other.</p>

  <p>There had never occured a large scale war among them.</p>

  <p>However, that didn't mean they didn't compete with each other.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, because the four divine kingdoms maintained a close relationship with each other and couldn't annex each other's territories into their own, the covert competition among them got intense.</p>

  <p>It was also the reason why the divine kingdoms had established so many martial houses. Each one of them was interested in cultivating new talents.</p>

  <p>As the ruler of the Harlen Divine Kingdom, Turner was aware of how valuable Zheng was. Although he still hadn't seen Zheng's true strength, he knew that Zheng was at the middle stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm and that his soul was close to the Jasper Fighting Soul Realm. It meant that he had become very powerful.</p>

  <p>Turner spoke kindly, but he wasn't afraid of War Emperor York.</p>

  <p>In the past few years, the York Divine Kingdom had developed the most.</p>

  <p>It was ranked first among all kingdoms in terms of overall strength, while the Harlen Divine Kingdom, being the weakest, was ranked fourth.</p>

  <p>Still, if the strength of the divine kingdom kings were to be compared, Turner was not so inferior to Lucien.</p>

  <p>Hearing what Turner said, Lucien grew annoyed. "Turner, what do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"My meaning is clear," he replied calmly. "No matter if he is Zheng or Tianxing, he is the member of the Harlen Divine Kingdom, for he is from the Jade Martial House of the Harlen Divine Kingdom!"</p>

  <p>A trace of a cold smile appeared on Lucien's face. He harrumphed, saying, "Since you say it like that, does it mean that my son died in vain?"</p>

  <p>The corner of Turner's mouth curled up slightly as he responded to this accusation. "If I'm not wrong, Lucien, you have more than twenty thousand descendants, right?"</p>

  <p>Some divine kingdom rulers were fond of women and had many sons.</p>

  <p>Each ruler had fathered a great many number, for as leaders of the kingdoms, the more sons they had, the better it was for them. Only then would they be able to choose an outstanding one to be heir to the throne.</p>

  <p>However, Lucien had more sons than the other divine kingdom rulers.</p>

  <p>He was extremely fond of women. His imperial harem stretched over a million square miles, equivalent to a medium-sized city. Tens of thousands of beauties were a part of it.</p>

  <p>The number of princes his wives had given him was probably close to twenty thousand. He probably didn't even remember the names of all his sons...</p>

  <p>The princes weren't worth a lot in the divine kingdom.</p>

  <p>They all had to rely on talent and strength alone in order to prove themselves and be in their father's good graces. Most princes of inferior talent were eliminated cruelly from the competition.</p>

  <p>From a certain point of view, the lives of these incompetent princes were worse than those of ordinary people.</p>

  <p>"I indeed have many sons. Among them, Daniel was extremely talented and remarkable. I deeply favored him and he had a good relationship with the Holy Maiden. I'm his father, can't I gain some compensation for his death?" Lucien asked Turner coldly.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Turner sneered silently, realizing that Lucien was finally revealing his true colors.</p>

  <p>Among the four rulers, Lucien was notorious for being deceitful and foxy. It was clear that in saying all this, he just wanted to extort something from Turner.</p>

  <p>"I will make it up to you. But believe me when I say that Tianxing is a warrior from the Harlen Divine Kingdom." Turner moved aside slowly, saying to Zheng, "Tianxing!"</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled and cupped his hands before Turner. "Yes, I'm here!"</p>

  <p>"My son, Randy, wants you to represent him in the battle. Do your best!</p>

  <p>Please be careful." After saying so, Turner returned to the elevated platform.</p>

  <p>He was the divine kingdom's ruler. It was kind of him to favor Zheng. After all, Zheng was just a Virtual Tribulation Realm warrior.</p>

  <p>He had warned Zheng to be careful of the warrior of the York Divine Kingdom. After what he said to Lucien, the latter naturally would not make a move against Zheng again.</p>

  <p>However, the strength of the York Divine Kingdom's younger generation warriors could not be underestimated. If the warrior were to accidentally kill Zheng, Turner would not be able to protect him anymore. If such a thing happened, it would only establish that Zheng was not all that powerful.</p>

  <p>He was going to represent Lord Randy in the battle.</p>

  <p>The Harlen Divine Kingdom was under the control of the Zhou Clan.</p>

  <p>Lord Randy's full name was Randy Zhou.</p>

  <p>Zheng was moved by Turner's warning. After all, he was not truly a warrior from the Harlen Divine Kingdom. But Turner was willing to protect Zheng, even though he was just a Virtual Tribulation Realm warrior. It quite exceeded Zheng's expectations.</p>

  <p>Lucien had stopped his attacks on Zheng for the moment. Zheng turned around and flew toward the enchanted barrier in the air, his gaze finally landing on Logan.</p>

  <p>The corners of Logan's mouth curled up, his smile exuding confidence.</p>

  <p>"Your soul is very powerful!" he said lightly. "However, I wonder about your true strength."</p>

  <p>Now that Zheng had the Fighting Soul, he had a bigger advantage over other ordinary Virtual Tribulation Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>Even Logan, who was doubtlessly confident in his own abilities, was a little worried. He possessed a magic treasure to protect his soul, but he wasn't certain that he would be able to tolerate Zheng's soul attack.</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled at him. "Don't worry! I won't use the soul attack!"</p>

  <p>These words surprised Logan. He wondered if the young man before him was more arrogant than even himself!</p>

  <p>Zheng clearly had an unparalleled advantage in one aspect, but apparently he had decided not to make use of it. Moreover, he had already witnessed Logan's strength before. It looked like Zheng was confident of defeating Logan.</p>

  <p>"Goodness, he is confident. Logan, you must try your best to defeat him!" Lucien shouted out.</p>

  <p>The meaning behind his words could not be more obvious. He wanted to prevent Zheng from using his soul to suppress the opponent. As such, Zheng would have to challenge Logan with his own strength.</p>

  <p>Logan nodded confidently. Since Zheng had given up his advantage of the soul attack, Logan was confident of his triumph. He had always believed he could not find a powerful Virtual Tribulation Realm opponent who could outmatch him, for he was the most invincible one among the Virtual Tribulation Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>However, after hearing Lucien's words, Logan understood that Lucien didn't want him to merely break one of Zheng's arms. He wanted Logan to go ahead and kill Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng drew out a long sword from his body. It flashed with a faint golden glow in the sunlight as he swung it.</p>

  <p>"A top-grade sacred weapon?" Seeing Zheng's sword, Logan raised his brows, his eyes alight.</p>

  <p>Even within the Harlen Divine Kingdom, a region famous for weapon refiners, top-grade sacred weapons were rare. Even if they did exist, they belonged to the royal family. It was unheard of for an ordinary warrior to obtain them.</p>

  <p>So when Turner saw the top-grade sacred weapon in Zheng's hand, he too got curious. "Randy, was this top-grade sacred weapon a gift from you?"</p>

  <p>Randy shook his head. "Zheng didn't ask me for the sacred weapon. It must be his own."</p>

  <p>Turner shook his head and smiled. "I'm afraid this boy is a mystery. He may not just be an ordinary warrior born in the Sky Northern Region."</p>

  <p>The reasoning behind his speculation was simple. The Sky Northern Region was a poor place, so it was impossible to cultivate a weapon refiner there who was capable of refining a top-grade sacred weapon.</p>

  <p>There might be a few of those there, but none of them could have found the materials required to refine a top-grade sacred weapon in the Sky Northern Region.</p>

  <p>Turner was a weapon refiner himself. He was well aware of the costs involved in forging a top-grade sacred weapon.</p>

  <p>Randy nodded. "I understand. However, Tianxing is a good, kind man, and we get along well with each other. We have a similar character and the same hobbies. Therefore, I gave him the life stones as a gift."</p>

  <p>"Well done. If a person like him is willing to stay in our Harlen Divine Kingdom, the benefits he would bring to us in the future are incalculable," Turner said.</p>

  <p>Listening on to this conversation between Randy and Turner, the crown prince, Bram, sunk in his seat, visibly displeased.</p>

  <p>Bram and Randy Zhou had competed for a long time, and now Randy Zhou had become the Lord. Even though Bram was the heir to the throne, he knew the competition between Randy and himself had not yet ended. Unless he could step into the Soul Sea Realm in the future and his father stepped down from the throne, Randy still had the chance to fight him for the position as the heir to the throne.</p>

  <p>And now, Bram's hopes seemed to be dashing. The nervousness that Zheng's presence brought him could be well imagined.</p>

  <p>While they were talking, the battle began.</p>

  <p>Logan had toned down his contempt. He manifested layers of space armor while the Space Chopping Sword in his hand swung in the space.</p>

  <p>It was as if countless ripples broke through the surface of air, emitting rays of various colors in the sunlight.</p>

  <p>Logan took a step forward and a string of figures appeared in the sky.</p>

  <p>Strangely, he then materialized next to Zheng.</p>
