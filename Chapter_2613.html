  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luckily, the broken sword that Lone possessed was already familiar with the Thunderstorm Mountain.</p>

  <p>He had managed to resist all of the attacks at the periphery of the mountain range using his own strength.</p>

  <p>After he had successfully entered the inner circle of the Thunderstorm Mountain, the golden thunder had become stronger and faster. Lone's current strength level was not enough to let him cross this place.</p>

  <p>However, the broken sword was well prepared for this journey.</p>

  <p>The Thunderstorm Mountain had an ancient history.</p>

  <p>It used to be the ancestral property of a large clan in the divine land. This clan also had Holy Beings, and they had been above the Time Sea dozens of divine eras ago. They had become a powerful clan above the Time Sea, and were famed across the divine land at that time.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, their honor and fame did not last too long.</p>

  <p>This clan was sidelined by the alliance of the powerful clans on the Floating Islands. As its foundation was not solid, the alliance of the powerful clans managed to quickly drown its Floating Island in the Time Sea. Naturally, the ancestral land was also affected and the members of this clan were exterminated.</p>

  <p>Now Lone's sword was to guide him to obtain all the inheritances of this clan.</p>

  <p>The broken sword carried this hatred within it.</p>

  <p>But it was just a sword, and there was no way for it to take revenge.</p>

  <p>Years later, when Mike obtained this broken sword, he allowed it to choose a swordsman in the Evolutionary Universe for itself. In the end, the sword pinned its hopes on Lone.</p>

  <p>Lone was just a Godly Genius, so it was impossible for him to help the sword take revenge. However, the sword's goal was consistent with Mike's so the only reason it assisted Lone was to help itself!</p>

  <p>Lone entered the inner circle and a strange blue rune flashed on the blade of the sword. When the rune flew into Lone's mind, a blue path appeared in his eyes.</p>

  <p>The blue path winding through the mountain extended a long distance.</p>

  <p>When Lone followed this path, he discovered that all the golden thunderbolts seemed to be paying special attention to him, and each and every one carefully avoided him.</p>

  <p>No matter how intense the thunderbolts on both sides of the path were, not one of them hit him! It was as if he had invisible halo of protection around him.</p>

  <p>He entered the inner circle of the Thunderstorm Mountain with ease and reached the end of the path, where there was an unremarkable cliff.</p>

  <p>Many True Gods had passed by this cliff but they didn't notice anything unusual about it.</p>

  <p>The history of the Thunderstorm Mountain was spread far and wide in the divine land. Many True Gods hoped to dig out some relics, gain benefits from the ancestral land of the noble clan, and perhaps even chance upon some forgotten valuable inheritance.</p>

  <p>But they had found nothing over the years.</p>

  <p>That was because they didn't have the extraordinary broken sword.</p>

  <p>When Lone casually brandished the broken sword, he opened the door to the great clan's ancestral land.</p>

  <p>Soon his figure disappeared from the cliff.</p>

  <p>Many shocking things had happened in the divine land during these years.</p>

  <p>On the face of it, the entire divine land looked calm and peaceful, but in fact, there were many crises going on in it.</p>

  <p>During this period of unrest, the Ruling Slate shook constantly and the 833rd rule recorded on the Ruling Slate had been triggered several times.</p>

  <p>In the past, the Jiang Clan would have reacted strongly to this kind of thing.</p>

  <p>After all, it was the Jiang Clan that was responsible for guiding warriors to the divine land and managing the entrance between each universe and the divine land.</p>

  <p>But after Harold issued the warning, this clan became silent, turning a deaf ear to complaints in such matters.</p>

  <p>They knew clearly that the Evolutionary Universe was the root cause of such things, but in such a delicate situation, the Jiang Clan chose to be silent.</p>

  <p>Three Holy Beings from the alliance of the powerful clans on the Floating Islands had died and the universe built by the Holy Being of the Liu Clan had collapsed completely. They were in a state of crisis.</p>

  <p>However, two of the three Holy Beings who had died could be resurrected, while the Holy Being of the Liu Clan could not be brought back from the dead because of the collapse of his universe.</p>

  <p>So the legend that the Holy Beings were immortal was proved wrong again. And this time, the effect was far more shocking.</p>

  <p>The only way to kill a Holy Being was to destroy their universe!</p>

  <p>However, someone had succeeded in severing the connection between the Holy Being and his universe, thereby easily killing the Holy Being.</p>

  <p>This method had never been used or even heard of before.</p>

  <p>Soon the news spread among the great clans on the Floating Islands. It was said that Nicholas had found a woman in the ancestral land of the Han Clan, and that this woman caused the Lethal Fire Magma to erupt from the ground and take the lives of three Holy Beings. It was this woman who had the token that caused one of the Holy Beings to die, and, at the same time, cut the connection between the Holy Being and the universe, which caused the collapse of the universe.</p>

  <p>It was on this day that the Ruling Slate trembled again.</p>

  <p>In the Cyan Demon Region, far away from the Time Sea, a woman in a light blue cotton dress fell out of the transmission channel and landed with a heavy thud on the grass.</p>

  <p>"Ouch!"</p>

  <p>She felt a sharp pain upon impact with the ground. Standing up, she looked around the desolate place sadly.</p>

  <p>"Where am I?"</p>

  <p>She tried scanning her new environment, confusion replacing the sorrow on her face.</p>

  <p>Before she successfully stole into this place, Wynn had informed her that it would be easy for her to find the Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng might be waiting for her in the Immortal Mansion and she was looking forward to seeing him.</p>

  <p>But there was no Immortal Mansion in sight.</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!</p>

  <p>While she was trying to get her bearings, a ray of light appeared in the distance.</p>

  <p>Eight burly men rushed over to her.</p>

  <p>Most of the men were proving godly warriors. One of the two men in the lead was a low-rank True God, and the other was a mid-rank True God.</p>

  <p>It was indeed very rare to see a mid-rank True God in such a remote place.</p>

  <p>"What is a woman doing here?"</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! This must be arranged by the fate for our master!"</p>

  <p>"Let's take her back and hand her over to our master!"</p>

  <p>The men got very excited when they saw the woman. They surrounded her immediately.</p>

  <p>Amazingly, the woman was not frightened at all. Instead, she just stared at the men blankly and asked, "What place is this?"</p>

  <p>"This is the Cyan Demon Region," answered the mid-rank True God who was leading the team.</p>

  <p>"The Cyan Demon Region?"</p>

  <p>The woman repeated and appeared more confused than before.</p>

  <p>She vaguely recalled that the Immortal Mansion was located in the Swirl Forest.</p>

  <p>After she entered the divine land, she had to go into the Swirl Forest before she could find the Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>"Where is the Swirl Forest?" the woman asked the hulks around her.</p>

  <p>"Swirl Forest? Ha-ha! It's not far from here, but it's not a place you can enter," the mid-rank True God laughed wickedly as his gaze wantonly swept over her.</p>

  <p>The Swirl Forest kept expanding much like other forbidden lands.</p>

  <p>Now, almost three quarters of the Cyan Demon Region had been swallowed up by the forest. All clans, large and small, which once lived in the Cyan Demon Region, had already moved away, and the ones gathered in the Cyan Demon Region were all notorious gangsters of the divine land.</p>

  <p>"Why can't I enter it?" the woman asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Seeing the woman's puzzled expression, the mid-rank True God laughed in a sinister way. "If you want to know the reason, just follow us!"</p>

  <p>If it was another woman in this situation, she would definitely be very vigilant. No woman would go away with strangers in an unknown land.</p>

  <p>However, this woman was different. After she thought for a moment, she blinked her pure and elegant eyes, nodded without hesitation and said,</p>

  <p>"Okay, let's go!"</p>
