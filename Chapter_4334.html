  <p>
</p>

  <p>The chaos remained empty, save for the Immortal Mansion and the black ship.</p>

  <p>Restoring a secondary world was a simple matter for Luo Zheng, but he needed to maintain order and decide what to revive and what no longer needed to be revived.</p>

  <p>"The Li Shan mountain!"</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>Loose earth and rubble gathered back together into boulders and land forms.</p>

  <p>Trees and plants sprouted from the soil and grew rapidly.</p>

  <p>Buildings rose from the ground until entire cities were made whole again.</p>

  <p>The human race, the Snake Goddess race, all manner of creatures, great and small, were resurrected in a flash.</p>

  <p>The Li Shan mountain had been destroyed not by the downgrading, but because of the erosion of the Extreme Form energies and the invasion of the Troubled Creatures from the Burial Land.</p>

  <p>The newly revived creatures were thus still so gripped by fear of the already vanquished Troubled Creatures that they just milled around warily.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded to the Snake Goddess. "It's your turn," he said.</p>

  <p>"Okay."</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess' eyes lit up. The Li Shan mountain meant everything to her.</p>

  <p>She had been devastated to see it destroyed. But now it had been revived, so had her zest for life.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>In a flash, the Snake Goddess stood on the jadeite platform.</p>

  <p>"My dear people, the worst is over for the Li Shan mountain!"</p>

  <p>The people in the Li Shan mountain were unaware of what had happened, but they began to realize that the Troubled Creatures had disappeared. The Snake Goddess' words were the final assurance to put them at ease.</p>

  <p>What happened next still left them too dumbfounded to celebrate, however. "Source World, restore!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had revived the Source World. And the Li Shan mountain was returned to its original place in it!</p>

  <p>The inhabitants of the Li Shan mountain gasped as a blue cover reappeared in the clear sky above them.</p>

  <p>"Are we back in the Source World?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, my God! I can't believe it!"</p>

  <p>"It must be a miracle!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had chosen to bring everything back to the way it was after the Evil God had killed the Xuanyuan and the Divine Farmer. The Source World and its countless creatures now continued on with existence as if nothing had changed.</p>

  <p>"The divine land, restore!"</p>

  <p>"The Ruin Graveyard, restore!"</p>

  <p>"The Other Shore, restore!"</p>

  <p>"The chaos, restore!"</p>

  <p>"The chaotic energy, restore!"</p>

  <p>"The six Chaos Ancient Gods, restore!" Luo Zheng brought everything back in quick succession.</p>

  <p>He recognized that even the chaos and the chaotic energy played an important role in the ecosystem of the world. Luo Zheng, however, saw no need to bring back the Burial Land, the downgrader, or the Snake Spirit King.</p>

  <p>They were better off in oblivion.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng waved his hand, recreating the bodies of the Primeval Lord of Heaven, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord, Ziya, the real Snake Goddess, the real Fuxi, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Zhurong, Gonggong, and the real Emperor Di Jun then infusing them with their energy souls. They materialized in the Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>Then Luo Zheng proceeded to bring back Chiyou and the Nine Li race. Even restoring people from different eras like that proved no difficulty for him.</p>

  <p>People were shell-shocked upon resurrection. Ziya, for one, clearly remembered dying in the fourth-grade world. Now, he suddenly found himself in the Immortal Mansion. Everyone was caught in a state of bewilderment. It took some time before it finally sank in, and for the joyful revelries to begin.</p>

  <p>It was three days before Luo Zheng could hold a banquet in the Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>Nearly a thousand people showed up to join the celebrations.</p>

  <p>Among them were Ying and Concubine Yan, who busied themselves all throughout dinner playing matchmaker for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Hence, three months later, a grand wedding banquet was held in the Bloom Divine Province of the Source World.</p>

  <p>Dignitaries from the various provinces traveled thousands of miles from across the Source World to attend. Nearly a hundred thousand people witnessed the momentous occasion.</p>

  <p>Three years later, Luo Zheng had six new children, three boys and three girls.</p>

  <p>Life was good and completely at peace for the next three decades.</p>

  <p>One day, Luo Zheng was at the top of the Deep Space.</p>

  <p>He stared thoughtfully at the gray soil before him, hands behind his back.</p>

  <p>In the past thirty years, he had studied the gray soil closely. Based on his memories, Clarence had done the same before.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, like any other human, had an infinite desire for knowledge.</p>

  <p>He hadn't understood before why Clarence had created Mastema, but now he had.</p>

  <p>For Clarence, there was no difference between the World of Nothingness and the perfect land.</p>

  <p>If there was no choice or challenge to freedom, it just started to feel like a boundless imprisonment.</p>

  <p>In the past thirty years, there had been no limits to what Luo Zheng and his loved ones could pursue. However, none of these pursuits made him feel fulfilled.</p>

  <p>He spent more and more time on the gray soil, searching for something he could not quite understand.</p>

  <p>The search had proved futile so far.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng sighed.</p>

  <p>He sat cross-legged in the air, hovering in deep thought over the gray soil.</p>

  <p>It was then that he noticed a thin black crack over the earth.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes widened. He floated hurriedly down to the crack.</p>

  <p>The crack couldn't have just appeared naturally. The gray soil was rock-hard and didn't easily break. As Luo Zheng came closer, he realized there was a dark green liquid seeping out of the crack.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng reached out his hand. The moment his fingers made contact with the liquid, Clarence's voice rang out in his mind.</p>

  <p>"I have left the perfect land, Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>I knew you would be curious about the world outside the perfect land eventually, so I left this message for you through the liquid, the only thing that can penetrate the gray soil.</p>

  <p>I couldn't find where the black soil ends, but I did find an underground cave of unknown depths.</p>

  <p>By the time you receive the message, I would have already left through this secret passage.</p>

  <p>If you also ever want to leave the perfect land, the only way out for you is to turn to the Evil God."</p>

  <p>The message ended there. The dark green liquid quickly solidified and turned into ashes. The black crack quickly closed and disappeared, as if it had never been there.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng mulled over what Clarence had said. "The Evil God, huh?" Luo Zheng murmured to himself.</p>

  <p>He disappeared from the spot, reappearing the next moment at the hillside of the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>In a clearing in the forest stood a simple thatched hut. This had been Edna's residence for the last thirty years.</p>

  <p>All this time, she had just been waiting for the Creator to fulfill his promise of reviving the Evil God.</p>

  <p>She had never thought to pressure Luo Zheng, however. She chose to wait patiently. She could wait for endless years.</p>

  <p>Edna was startled to see Luo Zheng, but the surprise on her face soon gave way to a faint smile. "Is it time to revive him?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded. "Yes."</p>

  <p>"But he's very dangerous," Edna reminded.</p>

  <p>"Danger gives meaning to life," Luo Zheng replied, with a small shrug.</p>

  <p>Energy began to surge in the void.</p>

  <p>Substances began to condense.</p>

  <p>A body began to take form.</p>

  <p>A heart began beating.</p>

  <p>The man opened his eyes slowly, a knowing smirk pulling at the corners of his lips.</p>
