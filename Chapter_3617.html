  <p>
</p>

  <p>Upon entry to the Creation Myth Temple, the Moon Fire Slaves wanted to grab the book.</p>

  <p>However, that plan was cut short when the Primeval Lord of Heaven killed the Moon Fire Slaves with a single finger.</p>

  <p>Of course, Luo Zheng knew that the book was probably one of a kind. "You seem to have cultivated several Truths of Divine Dao, right?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, there are three Truths of Divine Dao in total," Luo Zheng answered with a nod.</p>

  <p>In reality, he had cultivated five Truths of Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>The only thing was that the Truth of Three-Energy Construction and his physical body's Truth of Divine Dao could not carry the Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>Now, he had already guessed that the Primeval Lord of Heaven intended to ask him to fuse with that book.</p>

  <p>"This book is the Civilization Artifact of our human race. You can fuse with it by means of the Truth of Cultivation Nature," the Primeval Lord of Heaven stated.</p>

  <p>"Well, it..." At that moment, Luo Zheng began to hesitate.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid it's not appropriate." "Why? Do you know the meaning of the Civilization Artifact?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven questioned with a smile.</p>

  <p>Not many races could leave Civilization Artifacts behind on the Other Shore. That was why the Primeval Lord of Heaven thought that Luo Zheng didn't know the meaning of the Civilization Artifact.</p>

  <p>"I know," Luo Zheng answered.</p>

  <p>Aside from being an authoritative figure, the Primeval Lord of Heaven also had a vast knowledge and abundant experience.</p>

  <p>Thus, his understanding of the Other Shore and the chaos should be far better than that of the Green Jade Spirit and No. 9527.</p>

  <p>Not to mention the function of the human race's Civilization Artifact, it would already be a good thing for him if he could have the Primeval Lord of Heaven's guidance! "Then why is it not appropriate?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"Because my Truth of Cultivation Nature has already carried another Civilization Artifact," Luo Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>After the Primeval Lord of Heaven heard those words, the eyebrows of his lifelike statue slightly shot up.</p>

  <p>Truth be told, the test of the Creation Myth Temple wasn't very strict because only one Other Shore Key was given out, and there was only one chance to choose a suitable person.</p>

  <p>Therefore, many of the powerful warriors in the civilization met with Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Most of them followed the same rule to do so, and some of them even took the opportunity to teach him a token.</p>

  <p>It could also be said that they subconsciously did not take Luo Zheng's strength seriously.</p>

  <p>After all, the human civilization in the past was a civilization where talents were born for generations. In the following rounds of chaos, however, it was almost impossible to produce a talent like them.</p>

  <p>Yet, here was Luo Zheng, who had surprised the Primeval Lord of Heaven once again with his answer.</p>

  <p>Whatever civilization that could hide on the Other Shore must be a strong ruling one, but even so, it was difficult for a ruling civilization to reach the higher stages.</p>

  <p>Still, a civilization that could make a Civilization Artifact was already considered extremely powerful!</p>

  <p>All in all, was such a civilization really willing to choose this young man from the human race? "Which civilization does the Civilization Artifact belong to?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked again.</p>

  <p>"The Green Jade Civilization," replied Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Once again, Luo Zheng's answer took the Primeval Lord of Heaven aback.</p>

  <p>It was true that when the Green Jade Civilization was at its peak, it was one of the ten great civilizations.</p>

  <p>"It is a great opportunity for you to obtain a Civilization Artifact," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said with a nod. "Fortunately, the Civilization Artifact is rather complicated, and there usually are more than one Truth of Divine Dao that it can match with. If you have cultivated the Truth of Goodwill and Malice, you can use it to bear this Civilization Artifact too."</p>

  <p>A red flush rose on Luo Zheng's flustered face. He simply said, "Well, my Truth of Goodwill and Malice also carries a Civilization Artifact..."</p>

  <p>The Civilization Artifact of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization still released tasks every day and night. Since Luo Zheng had been quite busy recently, he had not paid attention to it.</p>

  <p>But when necessary, it was completely fine to extract several thousand Jun of force from it.</p>

  <p>The corners of the Primeval Lord of Heaven's eyes slightly twitched in shock when he heard Luo Zheng's words.</p>

  <p>To fuse with one Civilization Artifact was already a great blessing for anyone. Yet, this man in front of him had already fused with two Civilization Artifacts, and now he was going to fuse with the third...</p>

  <p>Just then, the Primeval Lord of Heaven turned his head and his gaze fell on Chiyou's statue.</p>

  <p>Chiyou's statue glowed with a red light, and all of the three heads had a gentle smile.</p>

  <p>Although the seeds they had sowed failed to meet their expectation, he was a little proud that such a young man had appeared in the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, even though he was not Chiyou in the Source World, the blood of the Nine Li race that Luo Zheng had inherited was genuine!</p>

  <p>"Then you only have the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent left," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said. Then, this time he cautiously asked, "Has this Truth of Divine Dao fused with another Other Shore Token?"</p>

  <p>"No. The Truth of Eternal Sword Intent carries the Strength God Totem.</p>

  <p>This Other Shore Token needs to be replaced," Luo Zheng answered.</p>

  <p>"Perfect! Let's begin to bear the Civilization Artifact now," the Primeval Lord of Heaven exclaimed.</p>

  <p>With a wave of the Primeval Lord of Heaven's hand, both Feng Ge and the human woman were thrown out of the starry illusion not far away.</p>

  <p>He glanced coldly at the woman and said, "I won't kill you not only because the rules prevent me from doing so. Though I can't kill you inside the temple, it's still easy to trap you to death with the illusion."</p>

  <p>Naturally, the woman was shocked and her face was immediately drained of color.</p>

  <p>She knew that they couldn't kill her in the Creation Myth Temple, but the illusion was under their control. There must be many other ways to deal with her, but she still foolishly went inside the illusion...</p>

  <p>"The Snake Goddess has already told you what you need to know.</p>

  <p>Remember to relay those words to my junior fellow disciple. You can leave now," the Primeval Lord of Heaven hissed.</p>

  <p>After the human woman had passed the tests of six desires, she met the energy soul of the Snake Goddess. Since the two of them were members of the same race, the Snake Goddess was clearly the suitable being to inform the woman of those words.</p>

  <p>Before the human woman left, she looked at Luo Zheng with an unreadable expression. She wanted to remember his appearance.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, his figure was blurry so she couldn't see him clearly. Sadness filled her heart, and she walked out of the Creation Myth Temple.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng was also dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>The junior fellow disciple of the Primeval Lord of Heaven?</p>

  <p>Based on the memories that the Primeval Lord of Heaven had given him, he knew that he had a senior fellow disciple and a junior fellow disciple. His senior fellow disciple was the leader of the Human Sect, and his junior fellow disciple was the leader of the Interception Sect, Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>'Did the Grandmaster of Heaven betray the human race on the Other Shore and become a member of the Nihility race?' Luo Zheng guessed.</p>

  <p>As his thoughts flooded his mind, the human woman was already gone.</p>

  <p>Then, the Primeval Lord of Heaven held the blue book in his hand and gently raised it towards the sky.</p>

  <p>"Boom! Boom! Boom..."</p>

  <p>There was a deep rumbling sound as the entire temple began to shake.</p>

  <p>The strategy the human race had chosen was quite similar to that of the Green Jade Civilization, but there was also an essential difference between them.</p>

  <p>The Green Jade Civilization hid in the lower stage.</p>

  <p>The human race was even stronger, so they stood on Stage Seventeen. In fact, those large races still didn't have an effective way to deal with the temple of the human race!</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Feng Ge felt quite tense when she saw what happened around her. Her lips quivered nervously as she walked towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>She had passed the tests of six desires as well, and also saw Emperor Di Jun afterwards.</p>

  <p>He was the man who shared the same bloodline as her. As always, his handsome face was pleasant and enchanting.</p>

  <p>Even though Feng Ge had the bloodline of the Jin Wu, she resented and loathed them very much.</p>
