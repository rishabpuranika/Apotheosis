  <p>As they sensed the smell of blood flowing from Bryson, all the children of the Luo Clan fell into shock.</p>

  <p>"What a dense smell of blood! This is not a cultivation method of our Luo Clan!"</p>

  <p>"Bryson has been practicing the Purple Light Fist, hasn't he? But why did he suddenly switch to another one?"</p>

  <p>"It seems to be... Blood Evil Force!" "Isn't it the cultivation method that the Blood Prisoner is infamous for? Why would Bryson adopt this wicked method?"</p>

  <p>Hodge and the others all turned pale.</p>

  <p>A while ago, when the C County government attempted to hunt down Blood Prisoner, a criminal infamous for his dark cultivation method, they released a detailed order for arrest that contained an elaborate description of Blood Prisoner's appearance, physical characteristics, and the cultivation method he usually employed.</p>

  <p>Judging by the scent of blood coming from Bryson, his cultivation method was practically the same as the description of the Blood Evil Force that was written on the official notice. However, Hodge was not perfectly certain about his assumptions, therefore he did not want to jump into conclusions.</p>

  <p>After all, Hodge and the other members of the Luo Clan had never seen Blood Prisoner in person. Also, the details from the order of arrest were insufficient and quite vague for them to correctly identify and recognize the wanted criminal.</p>

  <p>Although they could not exactly pinpoint the relationship between Bryson and Blood Prisoner, Hodge was sure of one thing, and it was the fact that the cultivation method Bryson was practicing was definitely indecent, dark and forbidden.</p>

  <p>The sound of swinging swords against each other filled the air. "Swish, swish, swish."</p>

  <p>After Bryson moved his fingers, 12 swords suddenly rose up behind him and shot up to the sky as they left 12 streaks of their trajectory in the air.</p>

  <p>Fear struck in the eyes of the members of the Luo Clan. Looking at the terrifying sight of the flying swords above their heads was like facing Death himself.</p>

  <p>As the swords continued to soar in the sky, the vile smell of dark blood grew stronger as if demons were flying all over the heavens.</p>

  <p>Many of the Luo Clan members had their hearts jump up to their throats as they watched the swords come after Luo Luo Zheng to take his life. They all grew cold in terror. They thought,"Can Luo Luo Zheng really fend off those swords? As strong as his power is, is he truly an equal match against Bryson?"</p>

  <p>But they all knew Luo Luo Zheng would head on no matter what. 'Now that Luo Luo Zheng wants to reestablish the Luo Clan and save it from falling apart in this abyss, the most crucial task for him is to defeat Bryson!</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng fails to do so, then all he has ever said will only be empty words.</p>

  <p>Surely, we, who follow Luo Luo Zheng would suffer too.' Considering Bryson's temper, perhaps all the people present in the Martial Arts Hall today would be persecuted!</p>

  <p>'So, can Luo Luo Zheng really make it?' they wondered.</p>

  <p>Back then when Luo Luo Zheng tried to run away from the Luo Clan, it was Bryson who forced him back using his flying swords. As each sword came at Luo Luo Zheng, he had to take a step back, because at that time, Luo Luo Zheng did not have the guts to fight against those swords.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng saw things differently now. Though the scarlet life vitality attached to those swords gave off the strong, sickening odor of blood, Luo Luo Zheng could sense that the smell was not pure enough. This only meant Bryson led a half-hearted attack with the swords.</p>

  <p>Even the life vitality of any collateral descendant from a small noble clan in the Imperial Capital would be far purer than Bryson's.</p>

  <p>While the frightened Luo Clan members fearfully saw the flying swords like serpents descending from the sky, Luo Luo Zheng saw them differently. To  Luo Luo Zheng Luo, the blood-stenched swords of his uncle Bryson were merely tiny bugs he could easily crush.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng keenly watched as the 12 swords separated and swooped down and bolted towards him. With a cold smirk on his face, he effortlessly leapt down from the roof, his feet light as a feather. He landed on the courtyard wall, and quickly rushed to Bryson.</p>

  <p>The swords darted at Luo Luo Zheng one after another, trying to impede him as he charged towards Bryson.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng was as agile as a monkey. Whenever the swords were about to hit him, Luo Luo Zheng always managed to dodge them by a fraction of an inch.</p>

  <p>The members of the Luo Clan were in awe? amazed at what they saw that they almost threw into panic. After all, as far as they were concerned, if Luo Luo Zheng made the slightest mistake, he would instantly have 12 holes in his body.</p>

  <p>The most powerful seniors in the Luo Clan were very impressed with Luo Zheng's fighting skills.  Luo Luo Zheng Luo earned their utmost respect when he showed his unfaltering fearlessness as he swiftly moved through the rushing swords that flew past him, dodging them with the finest precision and timing.</p>

  <p>"Only a man who has absolute confidence in his swiftness and moving techniques dare to face 12 flying swords of death! Luo Luo Zheng? ... is already that powerful?"</p>

  <p>After running all the way to the end of the wall despite the dangerous attacks, Luo Luo Zheng leapt towards a small platform. Just before Luo Luo Zheng landed, Bryson let out a sneer.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, do you really think you can escape from my swords? Your confidence blinds you. You're too predictable. I calculated that you will be stepping on this platform. Well, now I'll watch how you get away with this one!"</p>

  <p>As Bryson's remark faded, the 12 swords abruptly shot towards that platform. At this point, Luo Luo Zheng was still up in the air, unable to duck anywhere.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!" Bryson angrily shouted. Bryson flashed a mocking smile as he watched Luo Luo Zheng struggle to fight through his swords. He thought to himself, 'This kid is still too young. If Luo Luo Zheng had practiced martial arts in Cloud Sect for at least a decade or so, then I'm afraid he could surpass me and I wouldn't be able to equally match him as rival.</p>

  <p>But now, even though Luo Luo Zheng has improved greatly, I have achieved a milestone as well. I have inherited the Blood Evil Force from no other than Blood Prisoner himself. Now I am not only stronger, but my skills and power have been enhanced as well!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, you are not my equal!'</p>
