<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2148 Heavenly Han House </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng informed the guards which space channel he wanted to use, disbelief was written all over their faces.</p>

  <p>For the guards, a person who owned a hundred divine might coins could buy themselves a house in Mirror City, take a True God as their master, and buy some land to cultivate. For a proving godly warrior, a hundred divine might coins were extremely precious. The fact that Luo Luo Zheng was willing to spend that much just to enter the space channel was horrendous.</p>

  <p>At that point, the guards thought that Luo Luo Zheng merely came here to joke with them.</p>

  <p>However, the moment Luo Luo Zheng took out the coins, their attitudes changed immediately.</p>

  <p>It seemed this young man truly did have money.</p>

  <p>These guards would never be able to understand. Ordinary True Gods would never be able to teach Luo Luo Zheng anything. He wasn't going to be able to find growth in Mirror City and the Six-Burden Divine City was a mere detour. He had to go to the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>The guards had no choice but to lead Luo Luo Zheng towards the space channel. As the gate on the stone wall opened, Luo Luo Zheng found himself staring at a familiar place: deep blue space that spiraled rapidly, leading to an endless abyss.</p>

  <p>He sneaked himself from the Evolutionary Universe to divine land by using this kind of space channel before.</p>

  <p>He stepped inside the space channel without any hesitation.</p>

  <p>He was gone in less than a minute.</p>

  <p>In the center of Mirror City was a resplendent building, on top of which stood two, sage-like men.</p>

  <p>This tall building held a special position in Mirror City given that its owner was from the Qian Clan - the main controller of the city.</p>

  <p>"Looks like another rich kid of a Floating Island has run away from home," one of the old men lightly remarked.</p>

  <p>"Very few wealthy clans are willing to let their disciples go to the wild these days. It's extremely risky with no guarantee of good results," his companion said.</p>

  <p>The nurturing of true elite disciples in the Floating Islands was usually done within the clans. Most of the outstanding geniuses would first be sent to the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. They would spend quite some time there before they were directly brought back to the Floating Islands. Geniuses in the middle level would be directed to the ancestral lands while those in the lower level would be sent to an ordinary divine city.</p>

  <p>However, it couldn't be avoided that some disciples had wild and untamed natures. These disciples would be sent out to wander freely, to be 'one with the wild.'</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng had completely restrained his soul, the two elders of the Qian Clan could feel his nature through their extraordinary senses. They immediately knew that Luo Luo Zheng was not just an ordinary person and the fact that he was willing to spend a hundred divine might coins to enter a space channel had them think that he came from a wealthy clan from the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>"His background is suspicious. He's not from any wealthy clan. What is his purpose in heading to the Six-Burden Region? Do you want to notify the Han Clan?"</p>

  <p>"He is nothing but a mere low-level proving godly warrior. Just let him be, he looks harmless enough. Besides, it's better not to meddle in other people's business."</p>

  <p>In the space channel...</p>

  <p>"Since they cannot exercise the use of Space Law in the divine land, how was the space channel built then?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng wondered, feeling a strange sensation as his body moved in a circular motion. He was currently unable to move and simply let the channel take him to where he needed to go. Fortunately, he was still able to communicate with Master Evil in his mind.</p>

  <p>"Who told you that Space Law can't be used? Those top-rank True Gods and Holy Beings are able to use Space Law to a certain degree. The only reason you can't use it is because your strength is too low," Master Evil said.</p>

  <p>"Is it also because of the Ruling Slate?" Luo Luo Zheng asked, feeling a spark of inspiration.</p>

  <p>"Of course. I truly don't know what those Holy Beings were thinking during the remote ages. They made up so many strange rules and made the divine land like this," Master Evil lamented.</p>

  <p>One of the biggest problems in the divine land was migration. Many of the True Gods, unable to use the Space Law, had limited range of their movements. This led to the obstruction of growth of divine citizens in terms of cultivation.</p>

  <p>"It's to make sure the wealthy clans from the Floating Islands remain on top," Luo Luo Zheng murmured in frustration.</p>

  <p>The rules of the divine land were strict and stable but it caused stagnation to its people. Very few geniuses appeared so it was natural that only a few individuals were able to become Holy Beings. The wealthy clans, on the other hand, remained unchanged and in power.</p>

  <p>"Indeed so, but there are always people trying to break through this barrier. Holy Jay, for example, established the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. Hilarious!" Master Evil burst out in laughter.</p>

  <p>After establishing his inner world, Holy Jay opened the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land to the outside world. The wealthy clans of the Floating Islands did not really care at first but eventually grew concerned at the number of people it managed to attract, with most of them being from the grassroots.</p>

  <p>When those in the lowest strata of society began cultivating in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, they immediately reached their peak. This kind of development caused quite a stir in the divine land. The wealthy clans then fixed their eyes on the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land and sent their elite warriors there to train in secret.</p>

  <p>After hearing what Master Evil said, Luo Luo Zheng came to realize that there was more to the story. It was no wonder that he encountered so many geniuses in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land who came from the divine land.</p>

  <p>After five days of floating within the space channel, Luo Luo Zheng was taken aback to see a sudden flash of light engulfed him. He immediately braced himself, ready to fall at any minute, learning from his experience back when he sneaked in from the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>However, he immediately relaxed when he realized that he was already slipping down.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>From the top of the slipway, Luo Luo Zheng whooshed down to the bottom in a peaceful manner. Once he was at the bottom, he stood up slowly and made sure that his body was in tip-top condition.</p>

  <p>"Wow! The treatment here that one person gets after spending money is quite different," Luo Luo Zheng exclaimed from disbelief.</p>

  <p>He then turned around and discovered a huge stone wall behind him with all sorts of beautiful carvings. It was even more exquisite than the one in Mirror City.</p>

  <p>"Is this Six-Burden Divine City?" Luo Luo Zheng asked in wonder.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Master Evil affirmed. "This is the Han Clan's ancestral land as well as their central divine city. It is a hundred times larger than Mirror City."</p>

  <p>The divine cities only had three levels. Ordinary divine cities were small cities like Mirror City while some central divine cities like the one in the Vast Sky Region were larger ones. The largest were central divine cities in the wealthy clans' ancestral lands, like Six-Burden Divine City.</p>

  <p>"You have now arrived. Please avoid lingering in the space channel and leave immediately!" a harsh voice announced, shocking Luo Luo Zheng momentarily. It came from one of the Six-Burden Divine City guards.</p>

  <p>'This Six-Burden Divine City is even stricter than Mirror City, ' Luo Luo Zheng thought, bowing to the guard as he walked away.</p>

  <p>The guard couldn't help but watch Luo Luo Zheng as he left. 'This is quite strange.</p>

  <p>Why would a proving godly warrior use the space channel?'</p>

  <p>Despite being a hundred times larger than Mirror City, the Six-Burden Divine City was still a bit smaller compared to the tenth-grade sacred places Luo Luo Zheng had seen in the Evolutionary Universe. The scale of the divine cities was based on slates: Six-Burden Divine City had a Thousand Commandments Slate but this slate's influence was still limited.</p>

  <p>Under Master Evil's guidance, Luo Luo Zheng spent his first few days exploring.</p>

  <p>There seemed to be many proving godly houses in the divine city.</p>

  <p>These proving godly houses were about the same as the martial arts schools and martial houses in the universe. Most of the divine citizens who entered the divine city would most often go into one of these proving godly houses to comprehend the Divine Dao. Their goal was to one day successfully obtain limitless lifespan.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, these proving godly houses were useless to Luo Luo Zheng. If it was to learn the Divine Dao, Luo Luo Zheng wasn't confident that he would match up to the True Gods in the proving godly houses. But as for the pure understanding of martial arts, he believed that many True Gods would first have to acknowledge Luo Luo Zheng as their teacher.</p>

  <p>After exploring, Luo Luo Zheng made sure to ask around and gain some information.</p>

  <p>It was through his dialogue with the locals that Luo Luo Zheng was able to find the largest proving godly house in the Six-Burden Divine City: the Heavenly Han House, set up by the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>Those who entered the Heavenly Han House had a slight chance of getting selected by the Han Clan to receive their training. If one was lucky enough to get selected and train, then there was a slight chance of becoming the Han Clan's personal disciple and getting sent to the clan's Floating Island.</p>

  <p>Of course, these chances were extremely slim and ordinary divine citizens did not even dare dream of such a thing. It was understandable that most of the people Luo Luo Zheng asked gave him strange looks because of this.</p>

  <p>Armed with this kind of information, Luo Luo Zheng then made his way to the Heavenly Han House. As soon as he arrived on the premises, he immediately saw tens of thousands of proving godly warriors sitting cross-legged on the floor, two feet apart from each other, with expressions of the utmost respect on their faces.</p>

  <p>At the forefront of these proving godly warriors was a chanting old man who sported a moustache. The old man held his hands behind his back and swayed unsteadily as he chanted. "Life, death, regret, and ...."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did not have the slightest idea of what he was talking about but since he had a certain level of understanding towards the Divine Dao, he figured that the old man was most probably teaching the Five Elements Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>    </p>
