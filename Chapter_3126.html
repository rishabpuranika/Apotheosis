  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Sword Tower was divided into three floors, and each floor symbolized the difficulty level, the third floor being the hardest. In most cases, only the Alliance Chiefs would enter the third floor.</p>

  <p>The first time Luo Zheng went to the Sword Tower, he cultivated on the first floor.</p>

  <p>Each ordinary long sword there held the power equivalent to a divine megaton of force.</p>

  <p>While every long sword on the second floor had four Jun of force. As for those on the third floor, each one was equal to ten Jun of force.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng recalled his first visit to the Sword Tower. He was cultivating on the first floor and got hit by one of the long swords. It was so impactful that it left him wounded and scarred.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng acquired the Shade Stone, it had cloaked his entire body as if it were his own skin. Luo Zheng wanted to assess its resistance in the Sword Tower.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>A long sword rushed to Luo Zheng at a swift pace.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>A speck of golden light shot out from the collision.</p>

  <p>The robust sword, containing ten Jun of force, was deflected by the resistant black skin of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Good job..."</p>

  <p>A satisfied smile appeared on Luo Zheng's black face.</p>

  <p>The Shade Stone he had absorbed accidentally was surprisingly effective.</p>

  <p>Feeling invincible, he began taking long strides as he advanced further down the path in front of him.</p>

  <p>The swords dancing above his head came loose and rained down on him one after the other at every step he took.</p>

  <p>"Bang! Bang! Bang! Whizzing..."</p>

  <p>Tiny spots of light sparkled at every collision of the swords with Luo Zheng's skin but to no avail. Each long sword that aimed at him was deflected effortlessly by Luo Zheng's body. None of them caused him the slightest harm. He continued moving forward unscathed.</p>

  <p>Sellers was guarding the Sword Tower. If he had witnessed this scene unravel, he would have been shocked to his very core.</p>

  <p>Soon as Luo Zheng approached the entrance of the practice room, huge swords above his head dangled loosely and aimed at him.</p>

  <p>These huge swords were more robust than the ones he had faced so far. Luo Zheng did not dare confront them when he was exploring the third floor of the Sword Tower last time.</p>

  <p>Doubts flooded his mind as he questioned whether he should go forth or not. But then, he fixed his posture looking determined and continued moving forward. Despite all the attacks, he wanted to test how durable the Shade Stone was, without caring about getting wounded in the process.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>Soon, a dozen powerful swords came swooping down on Luo Zheng, each of them containing ten Jun of force, and they hit his shoulders rapidly one after the other.</p>

  <p>Even after the continuous attacks, the black skin covering Luo Zheng showed no signs of damage. He was completely unharmed from the outside.</p>

  <p>But, when the powerful swords struck Luo Zheng, the force they contained was absorbed into his body and caused his internal organs to tremble from the impact.</p>

  <p>As durable as the Shade Stone was, it could only protect him from the outside.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng's strenuous efforts on resisting the powerful swords raining down on him, he began to stagger and felt his body turn frail.</p>

  <p>Instead of hastening his steps towards the door, he withdrew back to the cushion.</p>

  <p>This time, the time limit for practicing in the Sword Tower was a month. He had no intention of leaving right now.</p>

  <p>After suppressing the Shade Stone, Luo Zheng sat up on the cushion and let out a deep breath.</p>

  <p>Soon he would have to go up the Taiyi Mountain.</p>

  <p>When he fantasized about going there, the vague image of Milo emerged in his head.</p>

  <p>To avoid breaking the rules of the palace, Milo did not kill Luo Zheng when he had the chance.</p>

  <p>Once he went to the mountain, he would surely avenge himself, for Milo had broken his sword in their last encounter.</p>

  <p>However, he still needed to deal with some things in the Dragon City.</p>

  <p>With his mind overflowing with thoughts, he cast them aside in a single breath and began to recite the Truth of Goodwill and Malice.</p>

  <p>There was only one demonic eye in his body. Previously, he had merged himself with the demonic eye by relying on the Truth of Cultivation Nature in the Sacred Mallow Temple.</p>

  <p>Since it was his first time to merge with an Other Shore Token, Luo Zheng was not familiar with the process. Plus, no one in the Dragon City had ever informed him about this. Thus, he thought that he would own an Other Shore Token as long as he was successful in merging with it.</p>

  <p>Such a fusion was not perfect yet, and he later realized that he had superficially used the demonic eye.</p>

  <p>Only the most suitable Truth of Divine Dao could help him fuse with it successfully and later bear it in his inner world.</p>

  <p>To bear an Other Shore Token required one's inner world to be a Sanskrit Land. The same was true for bearing an Other Shore Treasure.</p>

  <p>Originally, before a True God could reach the Other Shore, they couldn't form the Sanskrit Land. But, there were a few exceptions who could build the Ten Sanskrit Land. There was also only a handful of them who could make the Hundred Sanskrit Land. Regardless of the probability of such occasions, Luo Zheng was a True God who had formed the Thousand Sanskrit Land.</p>

  <p>To name a few, in the entire Nine Li race, the ones who owned the Thousand Sanskrit Land were Chiyou and his nine brothers.</p>

  <p>If an analogy were applied, the Ten Sanskrit Land corresponded to a primary Other Shore Treasure, the Hundred Sanskrit Land to an intermediate one, and the Thousand Sanskrit Land to a premium one.</p>

  <p>To fuse with the demonic eye completely, Luo Zheng had to perfect the Truth of Goodwill and Malice this time.</p>

  <p>In contrast to Luo Zheng's compatibility with the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, his compatibility with the Truth of Goodwill and Malice was not so firm.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, it wasn't weak. Three days had passed in the Dragon City since Luo Zheng had left the cultivation room, and he returned.</p>

  <p>As the days progressed, it was now three months since Luo Zheng had been in the cultivation room.</p>

  <p>After he uttered the last word of the Truth of Goodwill and Malice, the truth aura reacted to his words and began to surge.</p>

  <p>The Truth of Cultivation Nature was the kind that could match most of the Other Shore Tokens. However, in many cases, it could only have an Other Shore Token not reject it.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Luo Zheng was able to fuse with the demonic eye and use its Other Shore Power, but he couldn't go any further than this.</p>

  <p>Similarly, he couldn't hold the demonic eye completely.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng exerted the Truth of Goodwill and Malice, the demonic eye reacted to it in his body and suddenly flashed a red light.</p>

  <p>When the demonic eye blinked within Luo Zheng, a massive amount of messages and memories flowed through Luo Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>'New words...</p>

  <p>New ways of thinking...</p>

  <p>Food...</p>

  <p>Reproduction...</p>

  <p>Power...'</p>

  <p>From the messages that flowed into his memories like a river, he saw the entire Dreaded Eye Demon race.</p>

  <p>In that dark world, the Dreaded Eye Demons appeared in various shapes and forms.</p>

  <p>As he read the information, he subconsciously raised his brows, feeling amazed.</p>

  <p>Generally, there wouldn't be much difference in appearance between members in the same race.</p>

  <p>However, the Dreaded Eye Demon was all unique from each other from their size to features. Some of them looked like snakes, some were as big as cattle, and some were like birds, flying in the air.</p>

  <p>The only common feature was that each of them had one eye.</p>

  <p>"It's not right..."</p>

  <p>As he continued looking through, he began to connect the pieces of the puzzle to make out what was going on.</p>

  <p>He concluded that they did not exist in various shapes and forms, but they were more of a parasite race. Furthermore, the different forms and bodies were not their own. In fact, it was the eye! The eye was their main and true body!</p>

  <p>In that dark world, the Dreaded Eye Demon race was a formidable race.</p>

  <p>Moreover, this race also seemed to believe in the Finale Way!</p>

  <p>"The biggest eye is embedded in a huge mountain. It is their leader, whose name is... Uday."</p>

  <p>Upon realizing this, Luo Zheng recalled how much No. 9527 used to look down upon this race. Yet, there was only one that gained its recognition. It was probably this "Uday", which was a real extraordinary creature.</p>

  <p>But how did Uday enter the Other Shore? Why did they build a temple for the Dreaded Eye Demons on the Other Shore?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng hadn't gotten the answers he needed from the information.</p>

  <p>After having a rough understanding of it, Luo Zheng controlled the demonic eye to move toward his elixir field.</p>
