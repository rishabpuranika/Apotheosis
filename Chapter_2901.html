<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Before the Swirl Forest was being invaded, Mike led the others away to safety.</p>

  <p>For their sakes, he led them into the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>Harold and Augustus stayed within the Evolutionary Universe, while Zheng, Marsh, Moon, and Mike arrived at the outside of the divine land.</p>

  <p>Even with Mike's prediction that "danger came from outside the divine land," it was the safest place before the Mountain of Holy Beings was opened. At the very least, the Yellow Emperor Guards wouldn't dare to leave the divine land to hunt them.</p>

  <p>This pleased Timotheus and Emily. After all, they had instructed Mike to let Lorena and Zheng stay with them during their last meeting.</p>

  <p>A few days later, Samuel managed to finally break the Swirl Forest's restriction. However, this was the exact situation at the Everest Spirit Mountain all over again. Not a single person in the forest remained except for numerous fierce creatures.</p>

  <p>This enraged Samuel so much that he soon began to destroy the entire fairy palace.</p>

  <p>"I've told you that they definitely would escape in advance due to the strength of their reinforcements," Hamish reminded.</p>

  <p>With disappointment twisting his features, Samuel stated, "They may have escaped to the outside of the divine land, but they can't take the universes with them. I'll change the rules of the Ruling Slate and destroy Mike's Evolutionary Universe!"</p>

  <p>Countless universes hovered above the divine land. Everyone was prohibited from going against any of them unless they wished to receive a severe punishment from the Ruling Slate.</p>

  <p>The Ruling Slate divided its rules into different levels with some rules added by the divine land's powerful warriors.</p>

  <p>However, the rules which governed the universes existed since the Ruling Slate's inception was set up by none other than Chiyou.</p>

  <p>To remove these rules was quite challenging. Even when Nicholas changed a single word in the rule regarding the universe wars, it cost him a lot of divine might coins.</p>

  <p>If Samuel wished to eliminate that rule, then he'd have to sacrifice a hefty portion of his divine might coins.</p>

  <p>Following Nicholas' death, the Han Clan forced the Floating Islands' other powerful clans to surrender their divine might coins. Left with no choice, the powerful clans forced their respective first-tier and second-tier clans to hand in their coins. It was safe to say that the Han Clan had robbed majority of the entire divine land.</p>

  <p>Luckily, Samuel indeed had enough divine might coins to shut out that rule.</p>

  <p>Hearing Samuel's words, the other Holy Beings looked confused.</p>

  <p>It was these same rules on the Ruling Slate that somewhat hindered the Holy Beings from fighting each other to the death. If Samuel managed to eliminate this rule, then the Holy Beings would be free to kill each other, leading to the divine land's downfall.</p>

  <p>"Don't even think about it! Those divine might coins your Han Clan looted belong to Leyton," Hamish warned coldly. "They're just Holy Beings. It's not a big problem for them to have fled. They're not worth these divine might coins."</p>

  <p>They were still afraid of what would happen next in spite of Hamish being able to find strong reinforcements through the Yellow Emperor Magatama.</p>

  <p>For example, the Nine Li Guards might break through the space barrier and enter the divine land ahead of time.</p>

  <p>Leyton's Sea Cracking Skull was ready for combat. With extra protection from the Ruling Slate's rules, their chances of winning increased. How could he allow Samuel to waste the divine might coins on some Holy Beings?</p>

  <p>Seeing Samuel still unconvinced, Hamish patted him on the shoulder and said, "All right. Leyton has prepared everything. No one, including the Other Shore Realm warriors, can leave alive!"</p>

  <p>Samuel raised his eyebrows upon hearing these words.</p>

  <p>He fully knew that those Yellow Emperor Guards were terrified of people from beyond the divine land. To make up for it, they invested their time into various plans such as letting the Sea Cracking Skull consume blood, establishing an alliance with powerful clans, and creating new rules on the Ruling Slate.</p>

  <p>But now, Samuel felt weird about Hamish's sudden confidence. He asked,</p>

  <p>"Has Leyton already come up with a plan against them? What is it?"</p>

  <p>Hamish nodded with a smile. "Don't ask too many questions. There's nothing to fear. It won't be long!"</p>

  <p>His reply calmed Samuel down.</p>

  <p>He had intended to attack and occupy Soul Wilderness as well, but then he gave up on the idea.</p>

  <p>Two months passed quickly.</p>

  <p>During these days, more Demi-holy Beings and consummate True Gods went to the Mountain of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>"The Mountain of Holy Beings will open in three days!"</p>

  <p>"It appears the rumor is true. The Floating Islands have yet to take action!"</p>

  <p>"In that case, our chances of becoming Holy Beings have risen!"</p>

  <p>The consummate True Gods and the Demi-holy Beings chatted while observing the Mountain of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>Although they got along with each other now, they would become rivals after entering the Mountain of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>Previously, many good friends, even brothers had fought for the chance to become a Holy Being.</p>

  <p>At that moment, a few black dots flew over from not too far away.</p>

  <p>"I see the consummate True God of the Bai Clan. Damn it, here they come!"</p>

  <p>"Who says the wealthy clans won't fight for the chance to become Holy Beings?"</p>

  <p>"There are fewer people this time."</p>

  <p>The flying black dots quickly approached and then landed on the other side.</p>

  <p>Most of the consummate True Gods and Demi-holy Beings of the alliance of wealthy clans led by Nicholas were slaughtered in the Abyss Demon Region. Only those who stayed on the Floating Islands survived, which was why only a few people from the wealthy clans were present.</p>

  <p>The consummate True Gods and Demi-holy Beings normally portrayed quite dominant auras. Now, their silence and the sullen look plastered on their faces were a far cry from it.</p>

  <p>Those coming from the powerful clans received the same order. Apart from scrambling for the Holy Being positions, they had another goal— to kill Tianming and Zheng.</p>

  <p>During the battle in the Abyss Demon Region, news regarding Tianming and Zheng came from Holy Beings who returned alive. The pair were stronger than Demi-holy Beings and could even fight against a Holy Being. Any consummate True God or Demi-holy Being that crossed paths with them would be asking for death.</p>

  <p>However, even their clans' Holy Beings didn't dare to disobey Samuel's order. How could they?</p>

  <p>This left them feeling depressed.</p>

  <p>However, the Holy Beings of their respective clans also informed them that the alliance of powerful clans was conjuring up a plan to stop the pair from reaching the Mountain of Holy Beings. If they succeeded, then there would be nothing to worry about anymore.</p>

  <p>These three days seemed calm. In secret, however, all sorts of forces were quietly observing undetected.</p>

  <p>In the Time Sea, Leif had already awakened the Emperor Resentment.</p>

  <p>A thousand miles north of the Time Sea, Estelle and Holy Jay lurked deep within the mountains.</p>

  <p>Outside the divine land, Emily brought Zheng, Tianming and Sword Chen to the area of sky that hovered above the divine land's center.</p>

  <p>Of course, Mike and the other Holy Beings were there as well.</p>

  <p>All of them were prepared. Once the Mountain of Holy Beings opened, Holy Jay, who was observing the mountain, would inform Mike immediately.</p>

  <p>Emily outstretched her arm and pointed her finger. Out of it burst the Truth of Void Destruction. A wide, fluctuating circle began to gently envelop the surface of the divine land.</p>

  <p>While she could make a space channel with ease, it was unfortunately blocked by a barrier that prevented her from passing through.</p>
