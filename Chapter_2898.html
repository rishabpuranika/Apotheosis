<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2898 Attack </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Samuel dragged his broken body and hurriedly retreated. His eyes narrowed in hatred.</p>

  <p>"How dare you launch a sneak attack on me?"</p>

  <p>Harold's power was indeed tremendous. However, Samuel was confident that if they ever fought, they would be on par.</p>

  <p>He was caught off guard, and that was the only reason Harold managed to land a hit.</p>

  <p>The loss of more than half of the body was nothing to a Holy Being. Even if Harold had smashed his entire body to pieces, he would still be able to return to the universe and get revived.</p>

  <p>Still, it was such a great shame for him to be defeated by Harold, and in front of so many people too!</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Harold looked on indifferently. He appeared bored and impassive, as he stood behind the light enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>"Let's fight together and destroy the Everest Spirit Mountain!" roared Samuel angrily.</p>

  <p>Murphy, Clark, and Zeke secretively exchanged glances. There were faint smiles on their faces. They were happy to see what happened, but they didn't want to be too obvious. It could offend the Yellow Emperor Guards.</p>

  <p>Around them, many Holy Beings were attacking the light enchanted barrier of the Everest Spirit Mountain, but they were not making significant changes.</p>

  <p>Various attacks bombarded the light enchanted barrier. It didn't seem to do anything, as the barrier only trembled slightly.</p>

  <p>Harold could sense the state of the entire forbidden land. He watched them indifferently from behind the light enchanted barrier, watched as they kept on attacking with no significant effect. Their attacks were too weak, they wouldn't even shake the foundation of the Everest Spirit Mountain.</p>

  <p>Before long, Samuel asked Pascal to take action.</p>

  <p>Up to now, Samuel hadn't figured out the full potential of that ring. Even so, he could not underestimate the ability that it could display.</p>

  <p>Pascal spread his two black wings, while wisps of black smoke swirled around. It quickly turned into sharp arrows that shot straight towards Harold.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>Every black arrow hit the light enchanted barrier, but none of them caused much damage. The broken light arrows left minuscule black rings on the light enchanted barrier. On closer inspection, these rings were slowly corroding the barrier.</p>

  <p>Since the power of the Abyss Demon Region could even tear apart the Mixed Element Seal, its power was naturally immense.</p>

  <p>Harold frowned thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>When he was connected with the Everest Spirit Mountain, his consciousness integrated with the consciousness of the mountain. Now, he could sense that the black energy had caused damage to the mountain, and this damage was irreversible. If this continued for a long time, the Everest Spirit Mountain would be torn apart sooner or later.</p>

  <p>"We have watched this farce for a long time. Let's move," Hamish said to Salim and Lorcan, who were both standing behind him.</p>

  <p>They didn't want to waste too much time there.</p>

  <p>Salim and Lorcan nodded readily at the same time. At last, the three powerful masters at the Other Shore Realm finally decided to move.</p>

  <p>When Harold saw this, he closed his eyes and sighed lightly. Finally, he turned and disappeared into thin air. A few moments later, he reappeared in the transmission array he had built.</p>

  <p>Marsh and some other Holy Beings had arranged for all the members of the Sword Clan and the Luo Clan to enter the transmission array. Marsh was waiting beside the transmission array when he arrived. He smiled when he saw Harold and asked, "How is it going?"</p>

  <p>"It would take some time before they could break through the Everest Spirit Mountain, but it's going faster than I expected," replied Harold.</p>

  <p>"And even if we enter the Swirl Forest, I'm afraid..."</p>

  <p>Marsh trailed off, worried. He thought that even if they retreated to the Swirl Forest, they still wouldn't be able to defeat the Yellow Emperor Guards.</p>

  <p>"The master has a plan. Let's get there first, and then we'll discuss this," said Harold with a smile.</p>

  <p>Without another word, Marsh walked into the transmission array and disappeared.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Harold didn't leave immediately. He wanted to buy more time for them, thus he needed to stir more trouble for these people.</p>

  <p>According to Harold's speculations, even with the powerful strength of the Yellow Emperor Guards, it would still take a long time for them to break through the Everest Spirit Mountain. It would be extremely difficult for them to break through a sixth grade forbidden land within a month.</p>

  <p>However, the power that Pascal displayed after he took control of the Abyss Demon Region was beyond his imagination. That power could easily suppress the enchanted barrier of the Everest Spirit Mountain.</p>

  <p>As Harold sat beside the transmission array, his thoughts had gone back to the Everest Spirit Mountain.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, a slithering sound echoed deep within the Everest Spirit Mountain.</p>

  <p>It was a huge snake, around one million feet long. It slithered out from a huge crack at the bottom of the mountain.</p>

  <p>It was the Black Wind Snake. It could be found all year round in the Ghost Brook, at the bottom of the Everest Spirit Mountain. It was a dangerous beast in the eyes of the disciples from the powerful clans on the Floating Islands. Its power was comparable to the powerful beasts in the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>All these years, Harold fed it enough Faith Energy so it would grow stronger. He was hoping that it would be useful in critical moments.</p>

  <p>Only a master of a forbidden land was qualified to distribute the Faith Energy. This was why, for the past few years, it had been difficult for low-level fierce beasts in the Everest Spirit Mountain to obtain Faith Energy.</p>

  <p>Harold distributed most of the Faith Energy to powerful fierce beasts.</p>

  <p>"Woo-oo-oo!"</p>

  <p>The giant birds that were circling over the Everest Spirit Mountain all descended towards Harold. They circled him, as soldiers that were waiting for orders.</p>

  <p>These giant birds were called Dream Birds, and they were powerful.</p>

  <p>Although they could not fight against Holy Beings, they were a force to be reckoned with.</p>

  <p>As soon as Harold pointed at a direction with his finger, they immediately flew towards that direction.</p>

  <p>In addition to the giant birds, there were also dozens of golden tigers, which were about a thousand feet high. Highly poisonous black geckos were also present. All kinds of ferocious beasts crawled all over the Everest Spirit Mountain.</p>

  <p>Even if these beasts were killed, they could still be reborn. Now, it was time to release their power, and Harold would not hold back.</p>

  <p>Three days later...</p>

  <p>A violent vibration shook the Everest Spirit Mountain. The light enchanted barrier of the Everest Spirit Mountain was finally broken.</p>

  <p>As soon as this transpired, Harold promptly stepped into the transmission array.</p>

  <p>At the same time, under his control, the fierce beasts of the Everest Spirit Mountain fought with the Holy Beings and the Yellow Emperor Guards.</p>

  <p>Even the Abyss Demon Region failed to resist the Holy Beings. It was even more difficult, now that there were powerful masters at the Other Shore Realm. The fierce beasts were at a distinct disadvantage. Soon enough, the beasts were torn to pieces and turned into streams of Faith Energy.</p>

  <p>When Samuel got injured, he should have returned to the universe. That would have been the fastest way to repair his physical body. However, he let his hatred guide his actions. He dragged his broken body and fought his way into the Everest Spirit Mountain, instead.</p>

  <p>He took Pascal and bypassed the ferocious beasts. They directly entered the Everest Spirit Mountain.</p>

  <p>They used the Grand Teleportation hundreds of times in the Everest Spirit Mountain, but they found nothing. The only thing they found was a destroyed transmission array. Exasperated, Samuel poured his anger out on the Everest Spirit Mountain.</p>

  <p>However, the Everest Spirit Mountain was so huge that Pascal barely made a dent even he had gone all out. He only managed to create a million-footlong crack. This crack was insignificant compared to the huge Everest Spirit Mountain.</p>

  <p>After he poured out his anger, he had no choice but to leave with the alliance of powerful clans.</p>

  <p>"We'll go to the Swirl Forest now. I won't stop until I find out where he's hiding!" Samuel said angrily.</p>

  <p>Hamish dissuaded him, "You'd better go back to the universe and rebuild your body first. You can recover in one or two days. It's not proper for you to just fly around like this with only half of your body."</p>
