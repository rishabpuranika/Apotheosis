  <p>Quentin's cultivation might not be as high as theirs, but after he displayed his great Wishing Spell, his strength should be several times higher than theirs. No world lord would be a match with Quentin if he was powered up with the help of his Wishing Spell.</p>

  <p>But he even used the Sky Pearl! With such a secret and powerful treasure supporting him, the young master's strength should be far above any world lord present!</p>

  <p>The problem for the world lords was that Quentin had used the Sky Pearl and was still defeated. He had also activated the escape ring to save his life. The strength of the secondary creature that defeated Quentin was truly at a level that they could not comprehend.</p>

  <p>They could not believe that such an incident really happened.</p>

  <p>As he noticed their expressions, Quentin's rage grew even worse. "Don't you believe me?" he asked with an angry voice.</p>

  <p>"We have no right to question you, young master. However, please understand that this situation is very hard for us to believe." A world lord lowered his head and responded with an apologetic tone.</p>

  <p>"No matter who the strange creature is, we have to go to the Skyland race to capture this person. We must make sure that the young master fulfills his vow." another world lord said like a politician who offered a solution to a problem.</p>

  <p>Quentin lost to Luo Luo Zheng even though he activated his great Wishing Spell for the demise of Luo Luo Zheng. If Quentin did not kill him, then in the future, Quentin's cultivation would not be able to progress. Therefore, regardless of who the other party was, Quentin should kill the secondary creature that he vowed to murder.</p>

  <p>"There's no need to hurry. This person's origin is quite problematic. Even the Skyland race is protecting him. I'm afraid that we will not be able to capture him so easily," Quentin said with a frown. His rash use of the great Wishing Spell had created a hidden danger for him. A gamble was made, but there was still hope if he could just murder Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Normally, once a warrior used the great Wishing Spell, they would only end up in a situation where they would not stop until they died. They only had to kill the other party to avoid the backlash from the great Wishing Spell.</p>

  <p>"The Skyland race protects a secondary creature!"</p>

  <p>It was only then that the Qin Clan's warriors realized the gravity of the problem. The Qin Clan could do anything they wanted in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, but they still had to behave themselves in front of the six great cultivation sacred places. After all, they were the owner of this area, so they could only curry favors with them.</p>

  <p>After Quentin's quick escape from the Tidal Surge, the members of the Skyland race and Collapsing Mountain race left.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng landed back on the platform. At that moment, the black water below the platform started to move again and a second tide current finally appeared.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>The water flowed harshly through the tide. Then, the whirlpools began to converge towards the platforms.</p>

  <p>The warriors who watched the fight were surprised by the sudden rise of the tide. In response, they immediately turned their attention to their feet.</p>

  <p>No matter how strong Luo Luo Zheng was, it didn't matter to them. Everyone still diligently wanted to refine their Pristine Life Vitality.</p>

  <p>The group of warriors from the divine land that had been driven off the platform by Luo Luo Zheng earlier now occupied their respective positions on the other platforms. Some warriors from other races did not dare to confront the warriors from the divine land since they were not as powerful as Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>They understood that they should shut their mouths and pray that the warriors from the divine land would leave them alone.</p>

  <p>At the central platform, Luo Luo Zheng no longer chased Han Liusu and Aleyna away. He wasn't even fazed with his fight with Quentin. As for Lucille and the other two, they stayed on the platform to refine the Pristine Life Vitality with Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Lucille, Kurt, and Lone were extremely excited. Their smiles reflected their glee and enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>The largest platform was somewhere Lucille, Kurt and Lone had never dared to set foot in before. Finally, they were able to refine the Pristine Life Vitality here.</p>

  <p>Moreover, not only did they stand up on this platform, but all of the other warriors from the divine land had been driven away by Luo Luo Zheng. The largest platform belonged to them now. They never imagined that they would be so lucky.</p>

  <p>The black crystals were continuously refined through the divine texture under their feet. Each warrior had managed to refine quite a few black crystals. Luo Luo Zheng only infuse a small amount of chaotic energy into the divine texture this time, since these black crystals were of no use to him.</p>

  <p>He just wanted to do Lucille and the others a favor.</p>

  <p>As such, Lucille and the other two already obtained more than a thousand black crystals in such a short span of time. Their expression was a mix of delight and surprise.</p>

  <p>Previously, they had only refined a few black crystals, and there were less than a hundred crystals per day. However, with the help of Luo Luo Zheng, each refinement they made was almost equivalent to the sum of the black crystals refined in the last three months.</p>

  <p>The three of them were extremely excited. The precious Pristine Life Vitality was constantly being swallowed up by them and continued to add fuel to the fire for their inner worlds! The concentration of life vitality in their bodies increased so fast that the results were visible to the eyes.</p>

  <p>While a warrior was moving through the Soul Sea Realm, the Spirit Supreme Realm, and the Spirit Transformation Realm, their inner worlds were continuously experiencing changes.</p>

  <p>As one's inner world developed and expanded, one's cultivation would also steadily improve. At this rate, he or she would be able to break through to the Spirit Transformation Realm in just a few days!</p>

  <p>After they absorbed the Pristine Life Vitality, the three of them gathered around Luo Luo Zheng, curious to hear more about his experiences along the way.</p>

  <p>Their faces were decorated with delightful smiles and eager eyes.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng briefly recounted the details of what happened in the Collapsing Mountain race. Even though Luo Luo Zheng had missed out on many details and hid some information from the three of them, they were still dazzled by what they heard. They continued to listen to Luo Zheng's discussion with curious minds, eager for knowledge and improvement.</p>
