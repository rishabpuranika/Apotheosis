<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Weapon House was quite spacious, but the dome above Zheng was only about two hundred feet high.</p>

  <p>If it weren't for this powerful gravitational pressure, any martial artist would be perfectly capable of reaching the top of the dome if they wanted to.</p>

  <p>When Zheng had risen to fifty feet high, the gravitational pressure was almost equal to that of a huge mountain weighing down on his body.</p>

  <p>This wasn't a problem to Zheng. He was able to maintain his speed as he rose and he wasn't even breaking a sweat. He kept his focus on the blue dot of light at the very center of the dome— that was his target.</p>

  <p>When Zheng rose by another twenty feet, he was already able to touch the white dots of light on the lowest layer.</p>

  <p>When Zheng saw the secondary third-rank weapons of all kinds wrapped in the white light dots, he didn't let himself get attracted. He just shifted his gaze and continued to rise. He could only take one weapon in this attempt. If he caught any of the white light spots, he would be most likely pulled down.</p>

  <p>The gravitational force had already doubled when Zheng reached a height of seventy feet, and it began to cause more pressure for him.</p>

  <p>However, the pressure was still very minimal as he continued to slowly rise.</p>

  <p>When Zheng reached one hundred feet, the pressure from the gravitational force became even greater. At this point, what floated around him were third-rank divine weapons now.</p>

  <p>He continued to go up…</p>

  <p>When he reached one hundred and twenty feet, the gravity increased yet again. The specks of light around him were secondary second rank divine weapons now…</p>

  <p>He continued to rise...</p>

  <p>As this happened, all the warriors in the Weapon House were silent.</p>

  <p>It was only then that they realized that Zheng's calm demeanor wasn't an act.</p>

  <p>Even if he wanted to fake it, he couldn't because he needed the strength.</p>

  <p>When Rhydian had reached this height before, his face had turned red due to the pressure of the gravity. However, there was still no signs of changes on Zheng's face. He didn't show any signs of struggling with the pressure either.</p>

  <p>The elder was shocked to witness this and it was written all over his face.</p>

  <p>"A boy has reached such a height and he's still able to maintain his speed. Normally, the gravity should be having some effect on him already."</p>

  <p>When other warriors tried to obtain a weapon from the dome, it was normal to maintain speed as the warrior rose in the beginning. But Zheng had already reached a height of one hundred and twenty feet. At this height, he was still able to easily control his speed. If his strength were to suddenly erupt sending him into a rush towards the dome, up to what height could he possibly reach?</p>

  <p>The elder had actually wanted to discourage Zheng from trying. Zheng had taken out 100 life vitality jades just to get the weapon he wanted in the dome. However, when he saw the look on Zheng's eyes, he knew Zheng was persistent and determined.</p>

  <p>Young people needed to have the drive and ambition to do the impossible. And every time they failed, they just could get back up stronger than ever. Zheng was in his twenties but to the elder, he was just an infant. It would do good for Zheng to experience some failure.</p>

  <p>So the elder placed the Thunder Wind Divine Sword into the dome as Zheng had wanted.</p>

  <p>However, he didn't think that Zheng would even come close to obtaining the first rank divine weapon.</p>

  <p>Even as the elder watched Zheng, he still refused to believe that Zheng would be able to do it. However, with Zheng's current momentum, he might be able to obtain a weapon wrapped in the red speck of light, which was a first rank divine weapon that Rhydian had paid for to put there.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, it was still quite a feat. It was rare even in the other 12 palaces that someone would obtain a first rank divine weapon in their first time at the Weapon House, let alone in the Mist Palace.</p>

  <p>"He was still able to maintain speed even at the height of 120 feet. I'm betting he won't be able to hold on when he reaches 140 feet because the gravitational force will immediately increase once he reaches 140 feet."</p>

  <p>The elder was curious as to up to what height Zheng could reach.</p>

  <p>The elder was so caught up in his thoughts that he hadn't noticed that Zheng had already surpassed 130 feet at a moderate speed.</p>

  <p>When he started to near 140 feet, he suddenly felt the gravitational force double!</p>

  <p>The gravitational force that pressed on Zheng's body was terrifying. It was constantly multiplying and it had risen to another order of magnitude which was unbelievably heavy.</p>

  <p>Zheng's body slightly trembled in response to this change.</p>

  <p>The initially quiet Weapon House was suddenly buzzing with conversation. Still, the martial artists lowered their voices.</p>

  <p>Even though they could never obtain any of those divine weapons themselves, they were crossing their fingers for Zheng. They wanted to see what grade of divine weapon this newbie would be able to obtain.</p>

  <p>Of course, not everyone believed Zheng could do it.</p>

  <p>For example, the brothers Rhydian and Matteo along with the other warrior who just joined the Mist Palace...</p>

  <p>When they saw Zheng rise to a height of 140 feet, their looks on their faces shifted.</p>

  <p>Especially Rhydian who had entered the Weapon House many times before. Rhydian was nowhere near the elder in terms of judging people but he knew that Zheng could definitely obtain a secondary first rank divine weapon. Perhaps he could still obtain a first rank divine weapon for himself!</p>

  <p>He'd spent years in the Ice Cloud House and still he couldn't compare to this young man who had just recently ascended to the Upper World. It definitely irked him.</p>

  <p>In fact, he regretted staying to watch Zheng reach great heights with such ease. It was such a big blow to his confidence. He'd been working so hard for so long and yet here came Zheng who looked much weaker than him but achieved something that he couldn't even do after years of hard work and training. Who wouldn't be upset to see this?</p>

  <p>In addition to that, Rhydian had gone as far as to consume a precious pill and even burn his blood essence in the process.</p>

  <p>Only someone who wanted to give it his all and sacrifice anything would go as far as to burn his blood essence. He wasn't feeling as great as Zheng probably was.</p>

  <p>As for Matteo, he had nothing to say. The gap between him and Zheng was incomparable. He was numbed in shock as he watched Zheng. He couldn't help but worry about his brother when he saw the look on his brother's face. However, he kept his mouth shut and didn't bother to try and comfort Rhydian.</p>

  <p>The elder let out a sigh of relief when Zheng's body trembled. The kid finally couldn't take it anymore.</p>

  <p>If Zheng could maintain that speed and continue to rise then he would just be a freak!</p>

  <p>Fortunately, that wasn't the case here which the elder was pleased to find out.</p>

  <p>However, just as he was thinking of all of this, he was suddenly met with another surprise. The calmness in his eyes was replaced with astonishment.</p>

  <p>"This kid..."</p>

  <p>It seemed as if Zheng was able to adapt to the force of gravity even at 140 feet. The tremble his body did earlier was just his body adapting. He was still rising while maintaining his speed!</p>

  <p>The elder was dumbfounded. Who had recruited this boy into the Mist Palace?</p>

  <p>Should he inform the leader of the palace about this?</p>

  <p>He knew it was the right thing to do. He immediately took out a message rune and as it burned, he recorded a voice message.</p>

  <p>"Master, there's a young boy here whose purpose is to obtain a weapon.</p>

  <p>It looks like he just joined the Mist Palace. I was wondering who recruited him here. The boy is actually..."</p>

  <p>Before the elder could finish speaking, Yolande's indifferent voice interrupted him, "I know."</p>

  <p>"How do you know?" The elder was surprised. He hadn't even finished what he was going to say and the leader wasn't even here in the Weapon House. How could she already know who he was referring to?</p>

  <p>"I was the one who brought Zheng into the Mist Palace. Let him take whatever he can get from there…" When Yolande finished speaking, she cut off the message right away. Since she had promised Zheng that she would help him recover Xun's soul, she had no intention of going back on her word.</p>

  <p>As for the elder's words, Yolande didn't take them to heart.</p>

  <p>Zheng surely wasn't the only martial artist entering the Weapon House at this time. However, Yolande was certain that the only person who could make this old man suddenly talk to him was Zheng. As for the two fellows Timothy had brought, they just couldn't surprise the old man.</p>

  <p>No matter what, she still had a lot of confidence in Zheng…</p>

  <p>After Yolande cut off the message rune, the elder looked at Zheng and realized that he was the boy who had been personally brought in by the leader of the palace.</p>

  <p>Even if it was the leader who had personally brought him in, that still wasn't an explanation as to why Zheng was so amazing. The elder thought this over. The thirteen palaces were intended to be the places where talents for the alliance were discovered and honed. Every year, leaders and vice leaders from every palace brought in so many talents and they were all amazing. However, even so, Zheng's talent was still too rare.</p>
