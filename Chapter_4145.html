<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>A part of the Jade Pure Realm was occupied by the Snake Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>Its entire northern area was the base of the Snake Spirit Sect, while the central area was the most critical.</p>

  <p id="top_19">It was not easy to get there.</p>

  <p>"Why do you want to go to the center of the Jade Pure Realm?" Dale asked in confusion.</p>

  <p>For him, Luo Zheng should have focused on developing his primitive land instead of thinking about other things.</p>

  <p>"Someone asked me to," said Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Who? The Monkey Spirit King?" asked Dale.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shook his head.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King didn't know anything. He couldn't even give any useful advice at all.</p>

  <p>"Master Dale, you have also entered the Eternal Scroll Painting, right? Do you know who built it?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"The brush-wielder," Dale answered quickly.</p>

  <p>It wasn't long before he was introduced to this name. After his master traveled through the main world, he found out about all the passageways to the secondary worlds being controlled by the brush-wielders.</p>

  <p>The brush-wielders knew many secrets. Once, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord had secretly supported a talented creature in Stage Thirty-two on the Other Shore. He helped him enter the Eternal Scroll Painting with a subtle motive?he wanted to contact the brush-wielder.</p>

  <p>The creature successfully passed through the Eternal Scroll Painting and reached the Eternal Realm, but he didn't see the brush-wielder.</p>

  <p>When the creature failed, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord decided to give up his plan.</p>

  <p>Dale was filled with excitement as Luo Zheng mentioned the brush-wielder.</p>

  <p>"How about you? Have you seen him before?" he wondered.</p>

  <p>"Yes." Luo Zheng nodded. "He is the one who asked me to go to the center of the Jade Pure Realm."</p>

  <p>After thinking for a while, Dale frowned. "That was all he said?" His tone changed as if he was expecting more.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Luo Zheng replied. "Should there be anything else?" he asked while scratching his head.</p>

  <p>The brush-wielder did not reveal too much information. Even the conflicts in the Four Spirits Sect were pieced together by Luo Zheng later.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha!" Dale sneered. "It seems that the brush-wielder has no idea. We can't enter the center area now. Our efforts will only be in vain even if we overcome many obstacles in entering it."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked in confusion.</p>

  <p>"My master has been there," said Dale.</p>

  <p>During the long war between the Snake Spirit Sect and the Bird Spirit Sect, it was not only the Snake Spirit Sect that always had an advantage.</p>

  <p>There were several times that the Bird Masters almost reached the Heavenly Square City.</p>

  <p>Their goals were completely different from the Snake Masters'. Their objective was not to occupy the Jade Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>Instead, they all had a strong desire for destruction. They aimed to stop everything so they could annihilate the Snake Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>Under normal circumstances, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord had no chance to leave the bubbles.</p>

  <p>However, when the Bird Spirit Sect suppressed the Snake Spirit Sect, an opportunity presented. The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord successfully broke into the center of the Jade Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>"Did the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord find anything?" Luo Zheng asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>Dale glanced at him and replied, "A huge altar was buried there. My master tried his best to enter, but a door stopped him."</p>

  <p>"A door?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and the Primeval Lord of Heaven looked at each other.</p>

  <p>"There was a sound behind the door. A strange song, as if someone was whispering in a soft voice," said Dale.</p>

  <p>"It is Sanskrit," said Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Dale nodded. "It was a pity that my master couldn't understand Sanskrit.</p>

  <p>Aside from the sound being nearly inaudible, he didn't know what it was about."</p>

  <p>Among the creatures in the chaos, only Luo Zheng and his son could communicate in Sanskrit.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian could even freely travel within the main world.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Luo Zheng relied on the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization to decipher Sanskrit quickly.</p>

  <p>Although the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord had traveled through the main world, it was not an ordinary tour. Elder Xue created a huge illusion for him. The illusion showed him everything about the Four Spirits Sect, yet he was still unable to understand Sanskrit.</p>

  <p>"My master tried every means but still failed to open the door," Dale said regretfully. Only a few doors could block the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>"Later, my master speculated that the one behind the door was probably the Human Spirit King, Kincaid," said Dale with a suspicious face.</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately," he sighed, "we can't find the key."</p>

  <p>"I have that key," Luo Zheng blurted out.</p>

  <p>"What?" Dale said, astonished.</p>

  <p>"I said I have the key," Luo Zheng repeated seriously.</p>

  <p>He opened the Sumeru Space and took out a key then handed it to Dale.</p>

  <p>The key looked unremarkable. It didn't even appear to be anything special.</p>

  <p>After running his fingers through the key in his hand, Dale stared at Luo Zheng in disbelief. He felt as if he was being fooled.</p>

  <p>"It's true. You can ask the Primeval Lord of Heaven if you don't believe me. I got it from the cabin on top of the Soul City," Luo Zheng said convincingly.</p>

  <p>Dale turned to look at the Primeval Lord of Heaven. "It's absolutely true," the latter confirmed.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven never lied. Dale took a deep breath and headed to leave. "I'll go report it to my master now!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and the Primeval Lord of Heaven wanted to go to the Jade Pure Realm with Dale, but he rejected them. He insisted on going alone.</p>

  <p>The Bird Spirit Sect and the Snake Spirit Sect were fighting fiercely in the Jade Pure Realm. It was a complicated situation.</p>

  <p>Dale relied on his bloodline talent to quietly pass through the Jade Pure Realm. If he took Luo Zheng and the Primeval Lord of Heaven with him, they would be exposed.</p>

  <p>They had to wait for the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord to make a decision.</p>

  <p>Not long after Dale left, a visitor arrived in the Night View Island.</p>

  <p>It was the Wing King followed by one hundred and ninety-nine Treacherous Beings swarming towards the land.</p>

  <p>These Treacherous Beings were the human spirits living on the Whining Road. They were also known as the world builders.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng woke Campbell up, he had cleared the Pure Sky Platform of trouble and made it easier for the other human spirits to awaken.</p>

  <p>At that time, he had to hurry to the Night View Island so he entrusted the challenge to the Wing King.</p>

  <p>The Wing King thought it was easy in the beginning. As long as the human spirits possessed other creatures, they could run to the Pure Sky Platform by themselves. The Wing King only needed to carefully follow them all the way and when they woke up, he would tell them the truth.</p>

  <p>But the problem was the human spirits' wishes were different. The wishes of some of them were not on the Pure Sky Platform, so the Wing King and the awakened human spirits had to spend more time helping others wake up.</p>

  <p>For the past years, the two hundred human spirits had been living in a daze.</p>

  <p>They felt indescribable emotions as they met again in the Night View Island.</p>

  <p>After Campbell, the first human spirit to awaken, told them about the situation of the Four Spirits Sect and the chaos, they were furious and swore to avenge the Human Spirit Sect and Kincaid. dozens of them were already positioned, preparing to rush out.</p>

  <p>"You think you're stronger than the Monkey Spirit King? Even the Monkey Spirit King hasn't taken any action. Are you really going to launch an attack now?" Luo Zheng stopped the human spirits with his voice resonating from his inner world.</p>

  <p>Although his inner world had transformed, the continents had been completely preserved.</p>

  <p>The core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization remained, helping Luo Zheng communicate in Sanskrit.</p>

  <p>The human spirits were just hostility-level Treacherous Beings. They were proficient in building the secondary worlds, but they were weak.</p>

  <p>Dealing with them might be difficult because they wouldn't die, but the Light of Annihilation emitted from a Holy Stone was enough to shatter their souls.</p>
