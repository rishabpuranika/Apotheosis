  <p>
</p>

  <p>As Brent's comments left Philip at a loss for words, Xander heaved a sigh and said, "What a pity for such young talent! I'm afraid he won't get through today. Yudie is still too young and inexperienced. I wonder why she sent him to take part in the Martial Arts Contest."</p>

  <p>He was heavy-hearted as he obviously also believed that Zheng would not be able to break Marilyn's Purple Power Domain and that he was bound to lose in the end.</p>

  <p>Among the spectators in the grandstand, Tianming and Patrick looked stern as they intently watched Zheng's unsuccessful attacks.</p>

  <p>He seemed to be having a hard time knocking off his opponent. He even resorted to using the Space Law to approach Marilyn nimbly, like a bat out of hell. But he would not be able to pose any threat to her. What should he do?</p>

  <p>Extreme tension clearly filled the air as the atmosphere in the arena had gotten intense. No one dared to move.</p>

  <p>As luck would have it, Zheng was able to teleport after mastering the first layer of the Space Law.</p>

  <p>More often than not, some warriors could teleport by relying on their speed and agility. However, no matter how fast these warriors were, their move still took time. It could be three seconds, or it could be in a blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>Zheng's teleportation, however, was a way to move through space!</p>

  <p>Theoretically, the time had no real essence in moving across space.</p>

  <p>And this kind of mysterious movement method gave Zheng a clear-cut advantage in his face-off against the majority of the Internal Elixir Realm warriors. However, it didn't quite work with Marilyn, who was in the Purple Power Domain.</p>

  <p>Thus his attempts became futile and came to naught as he failed to cause any harm to her. Marilyn quickly disappeared in a puff of purple smoke whenever he made a move in front of her to punch her. Only the reverberating sound of her peals of crisp laughter could be heard right after she vanished.</p>

  <p>"You won't be able to hurt me." Marilyn appeared behind Zheng and said with a teasing smile.</p>

  <p>Sensing her presence, Zheng immediately turned around and kicked her, but she became invisible again and reappeared further away. She shook her head, looking at Zheng playfully as if she was teasing a puppy.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Out of nowhere, three flying knives, coming from different directions were hurled, aiming towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>But this time, Zheng didn't dodge. With a flash of silver light in his hand, a flying knife was shot out. It swirled around Zheng.</p>

  <p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p>

  <p>The three flying knives from Marilyn were instantly cut down by Zheng's broken flying knife.</p>

  <p>Actually, these knives could never cause much damage to Zheng from the very beginning. It was only a tactic. He intentionally let himself be hurt by the flying knives because he thought it would make Marilyn drop her guard.</p>

  <p>And by then, he would take her by surprise and launch a fatal attack.</p>

  <p>Never did he imagine that he would be unable to kill her in the Purple Power Domain.</p>

  <p>He realized that this was going to be too troublesome.</p>

  <p>Every time Marilyn was attacked, she would disappear in a puff of purple smoke. Zheng ransacked his brain hard about this, trying to get a clue.</p>

  <p>After brief contemplation, he finally deduced that perhaps the Marilyn who kept visible in front of him was not her real body. Since the time that Marilyn had set up this Purple Power Domain, her real body had already been hidden somewhere in the arena!</p>

  <p>"That should be the case!" He had been misled right from the start. Marilyn was only an illusion formed by a purple smoke. She never ceased in mocking him, provoking him to attack her.</p>

  <p>So where was Marilyn's real form in this arena?</p>

  <p>Zheng suddenly used his soul force to scan every corner of the arena. After he slowly released his soul force, he got more confused based on what he got on the outcome of his search.</p>

  <p>He could sense no waves of energy!</p>

  <p>Where exactly did Marilyn hide her real form?</p>

  <p>"You are using your soul to find where I am? Good idea, but it's still useless." The voice sounded chilling as the purple smog got thicker and thicker in front of him. Right there and then, Marilyn became visible in front of him, well within his reach.</p>

  <p>"With your knowledge and strength, you can't possibly know what the Purple Power Domain is. For you, this is a predicament with no solution."</p>

  <p>Soon after, another purple smoke floated in the air, forming another Marilyn roaming freely beside him. She even got so close to him and whispered in his ear.</p>

  <p>Seeing these two Marilyn, Zheng struck out his palm and instantly split them into two streams of purple smoke.</p>

  <p>However, more Marilyn appeared on the arena--One, two, three, four and it went on and on! All of them wore the same expression on their faces. And with faint smiles etched on their lips, they looked at Zheng absent-mindedly.</p>

  <p>But they were not illusions! They could actually hurt him. He found this so annoying that he couldn't do anything.</p>

  <p>Zheng's face darkened as he mused where her real form was. He was totally puzzled.</p>

  <p>"Ha! Ha! Ha! This is the power attribute of someone who has completely activated the properties of the Purple Power Body. And this woman's real body is now in the Purple Power World." The faint voice of cyan dragon once again rang out in Zheng's ears.</p>

  <p>"Purple Power World?" Zheng asked with confusion.</p>

  <p>"Yes, the Purple Power World is such a small place; it's not a big world.</p>

  <p>Any creature, who has the Purple Power Body and has activated it, will be able to form a connection with the Purple Power World. It is a little similar to the connection you have with the Killing Sword Mountain. The only difference is that you can only store the malicious aura inside the Killing Sword Mountain, while this woman can even hide in the Purple Power World, making her safe forever." The cyan dragon continued, "You also have to note that although the Purple Power World is not big, some people forged 990 billion huge swords inside it. Anyone who has the Purple Power Body, can use these swords to defend against the enemy. And the higher her cultivation level is, the greater the number of swords she can use. It is also said that when one reaches the peak of the Purple Power Body, one can summon 990 billion swords at the same time which have the power to destroy the world… Look, they are coming!"</p>

  <p>As soon as the cyan dragon finished speaking, a huge sword appeared like a speed of light above Zheng's head. It was about 10 feet wide and 60 feet long.</p>

  <p>Its blade was neither made of gold nor copper, and there was even a layer of green rust on its surface as if it had been stored there for thousands of years!</p>

  <p>The huge sword appeared vertically in the horizon, but it hacked down ruthlessly towards Zheng at warp speed.</p>

  <p>Bam!</p>

  <p>Zheng dodged in the nick of time! As a loud thud was heard, a large crack surfaced on the ground. This wide arena was solidly built, but it was still unable to withstand the gigantic sword's slash! Likewise, even Zheng's body was exceptionally strong, he wouldn't be able to survive the attacks from the sword.</p>

  <p>The huge sword eventually vanished. But soon after, another two huge swords appeared above Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>Two deep ditches appeared on the arena as they missed the target and hit the ground.</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng swerved away from the two giant swords, another three swords appeared above his head!</p>

  <p>This Purple Power Body was truly difficult to deal with!</p>

  <p>According to what the cyan dragon had mentioned, Purple Power World wasn't a big world, but there were 990 billion huge swords within it. With Marilyn's current cultivation base, she definitely could not mobilize so many gigantic swords!</p>

  <p>But apparently, she didn't need to take 990 billion swords to kill him.</p>

  <p>Judging by the current situation, if there were only dozens of them or hundreds of swords coming down at him, Zheng would probably be smashed into pieces!</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>Four huge swords abruptly smashed down, immediately hacking four ditches on the ground.</p>

  <p>Outside of the arena, the warriors in the grandstand were flabbergasted.</p>

  <p>They couldn't believe what they were seeing--huge swords that kept on crushing down on Zheng.</p>

  <p>"What the fuck is this?! How did such huge swords suddenly appear out of thin air?"</p>

  <p>"Where did all these huge swords come from? Each of them must be worth a lot of money. Right?"</p>

  <p>"The number of swords swooshing down is constantly increasing. It seems that Zheng won't make it through."</p>

  <p>Five swords fell at the same time…</p>

  <p>Six swords fell down simultaneously...</p>

  <p>Another ten swords jolted out synchronously...</p>

  <p>As more and more swords began to fall from above Zheng's head, the space in which he could evade the attacks became more limited.</p>

  <p>"Is that I can't do anything if she's hiding in the Purple Power World?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Not really. Everything has a solution," the cyan dragon coolly said with a slow smile curled up.</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you say it earlier?" Zheng said angrily in his mind.</p>

  <p>"You didn't ask..."</p>

  <p>Bam!</p>

  <p>A gigantic sword almost grazed past Zheng's forehead as it whooshed down.</p>

  <p>The huge blade forcefully thrust into the ground of the arena. Then, it slowly disappeared in front of Zheng.</p>

  <p>"If you don't say it now, I'm going to die!" Zheng once again crossed through space and teleported to another corner of the arena. However, that damn sword was like a shadow following him and did not give him a chance to catch his breath. Just as he passed through space and arrived at another side, another twenty swords appeared above his head!</p>

  <p>"Ha! Ha! Ha! This is how my brother is like! He always dawdles and does everything unhurriedly. This woman is merely an Internal Elixir Realm cultivator, so of course, she couldn't travel through different worlds. If you think that she is capable of that, then you are wrong. Actually, people with the Purple Power Body could create special space nodes and communicate with the Purple Power World! Her real form is in that special node, so all you need to do is to find that space node!" The red dragon was of impatient disposition. So he explained the whole thing in one breath.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>Zheng once again traversed through space, ducking the twenty swords above his head.</p>

  <p>At this time, the entire battle arena was in a mess. There were thick cracks and ditches everywhere, creating a chaotic scene.</p>

  <p>"Space node, where is it?" Twenty-one gigantic swords appeared side by side above his head, just as he finished asking.</p>
