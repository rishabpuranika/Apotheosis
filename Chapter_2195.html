<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Across all the divine land, only top-rank True Gods and those above their level had the right to fly in the skies.</p>

  <p>In the past, Luo Zheng had never known very much about the rules set by the Holy Beings. It wasn't that proving godly warriors and low to mid-rank True Gods couldn't fly, but that their abilities were actually limited.</p>

  <p>Thanks to Master Evil's explanation though, Luo Zheng was capable of solving the doubt he felt in both heart and mind.</p>

  <p>The wealthy and powerful clans on the Floating Islands that had entered the Time Sea first were all bent on consolidating their status. Therefore, they would without a doubt use all sorts of methods in order to hinder the other clans from rising to prominence.</p>

  <p>For this reason, back in the middle ages, many wealthy and powerful clans on the Floating Islands teamed up together in order to establish such a rule on the Ruling Slate. It was thus stipulated that only those on and above the level of top-rank True Gods could fly in the air, and that furthermore, only those on and above the level of consummate True Gods could use the Space Law.</p>

  <p>Due to this rule, the newcomers naturally lost many opportunities. After all, there were many forbidden areas within the divine land that would be very difficult for them to explore if they weren't allowed to fly.</p>

  <p>Therefore, very few newcomers had been bestowed the title of Holy Being over the past few years. Becoming a Holy Being was now quite a challenge.</p>

  <p>Someone suddenly flew down from the sky and steadily landed without hesitation in the main hall.</p>

  <p>Immediately after his arrival, a faint sense of majesty spread throughout the hall. Although he didn't release any soul pressure, he did give off a very natural force. The force itself didn't come from him in fact, but from his inner world.</p>

  <p>As a top-rank True God, his inner world had already been perfected. It had become a huge entity, and therefore he radiated a sense of majesty.</p>

  <p>Similarly, Estelle on the second floor of the dungeon gave Luo Zheng an inexplicable sense of mystery.</p>

  <p>The individual who had just landed looked extremely young, but his face faintly revealed a sense of lethargy. It was almost certain that in reality, he must have lived for a long time, and he must be unimaginably old.</p>

  <p>Malloy, Luke, and Declan stood up and saluted him. Upon seeing them do so, Luo Zheng equally followed suit. Despite the fact that the Heavenly Han House seemed to want to expel him, he still had to be polite and show his respect, at the very least.</p>

  <p>The arrival was Bentley Han, the man whom Malloy had mentioned earlier. He was the leader of all the Han Clan's sub-branches, and thus, the twenty-seven sub-branches were all under his command.</p>

  <p>It was just a few days ago that he had heard about Luo Zheng. Not long afterward, he came to find out that Luo Zheng was born in a strange place, and therefore, he presented himself today in order to decide what should be done.</p>

  <p>Once Bentley had pleasantly greeted everyone present, his gaze shifted directly to Luo Zheng. When he noticed Zheng's Redemption Armor, his eyes opened wide as he asked, "What kind of treasure is this robe you're wearing?"</p>

  <p>Malloy and the other two also paid attention to Zheng's robe as Bentley asked this question. From the outside, Zheng's dark robe didn't look like anything special. In fact, even ordinary True Gods wouldn't be able to see any difference.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled thinly. Before he could say anything, Bentley stretched his hand out at once and formed numerous abnormally sharp red thorns between his fingers. Seconds later, they were clawing toward Zheng's chest.</p>

  <p>Although Bentley wasn't using his full strength, he was still a top-rank True God, and had already reached the upper level of the Godly Way.</p>

  <p>This sudden attack from him was shockingly fast and absolutely powerful nonetheless. Not only did Luo Zheng not have the chance to react, but even Malloy and the others weren't expecting such an attack at all.</p>

  <p>Creak!</p>

  <p>Bentley was like a hungry black bear whose only intention was to dig Zheng's heart out. His thorn attack was so extreme that if it was directed at a True God, even his heart would be ripped out in an instant.</p>

  <p>But when these ferocious thorns reached Zheng's Redemption Armor, they did nothing but let out a sharp scraping sound. Even more surprisingly, the attack didn't even scratch Zheng's robe. In fact, it didn't even leave a mark.</p>

  <p>As the leader of the Han Clan's sub-branches, Bentley's strength was unquestionable. So much so that it was safe to say that the power contained within his grab was something that even ordinary True Gods found hard to resist. In order to become consummate True Gods, many top-rank True Gods began to condense the Nine Divine Stars. Bentley had even condensed six stars that contained strength source.</p>

  <p>The eyes of Malloy, Luke and Declan all shone brightly as they watched this scene play out before them.</p>

  <p>It had never crossed any of their minds that Luo Zheng could have been wearing such a protective treasure.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng took a few steps backward and his dashing eyebrows creased as he bore the brunt of Bentley's attack.</p>

  <p>Limited by the rule stated on the Thousand Commandments Slate, warriors couldn't fight as they pleased in Six-Burden Divine City. If two warriors wanted to challenge each other here, they would have to pay a divine might coin. However, Bentley, the top-rank True God standing before them, acted as if he was not bound by the Thousand Commandments Slate in any way at all.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng felt somewhat annoyed, but his anger soon subsided. Only a select few people were born with the right to disrespect the rules. And Luo Zheng wasn't stupid. Of course, he didn't think that everyone from the Han Clan would be nice, and he knew very well that the weak would stand as an easy prey to the strong. However, the fact that he entered Six-Burden Divine City alone and displayed a certain level of talent and strength was, in and of itself, quite an adventure.</p>

  <p>Now though, he had to endure.</p>

  <p>If he truly succeeded in pissing these people off, he might not ever be capable of leaving Six-Burden Divine City.</p>

  <p>"Now, what's that supposed to mean?" Luo Zheng asked, frowning.</p>

  <p>"Well, I just wanted to test your abilities. You're quite quick to react, I must say." Bentley chuckled and once again transformed into a blurry shadow, charging towards Luo Zheng, regardless of whether Luo Zheng agreed or not.</p>

  <p>His attack's speed far exceeded Zheng's reaction speed. Before Luo Zheng could prepare himself, a pair of claws had already reached his chest again.</p>

  <p>On the one hand, Bentley wanted to test Zheng's reaction and strength. And on the other hand, he seemed to be trying to determine the exact material of Zheng's robe.</p>

  <p>Despite whatever he was trying to do though, he was certainly being rude. Luo Zheng remembered the rule stated on the Thousand Commandments Slate and didn't know if he even had the right to retaliate. As a top-rank True God, Bentley could tease Luo Zheng as easily as an eagle trying to catch a baby chick stuck on the ground.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was reclining backwards almost instinctively, his body twisting back like a carp. At the same time though, he took a Sword Step forward, displaying an unimaginable pace.</p>

  <p>Bentley's claws swept straight past Zheng's chest, but they didn't touch Luo Zheng at all. Luo Zheng had succeeded in dodging them cleverly.</p>

  <p>"Hmm?"</p>

  <p>Bentley didn't manage to catch Luo Zheng with his second attack. He took a few steps forward. There was an awkward expression on his face as he pinched his fingers tightly together.</p>

  <p>Although he had originally acted in a playful manner, his grab was definitely not something a mere proving godly warrior could have avoided. Let alone Luo Zheng, had it been Malloy, Luke, or any of the others, it wouldn't have been easy for them to avoid Bentley's grab.</p>

  <p>"Sir, I have already passed the Heavenly Han House's test, but you still want to test me..." A hint of anger could be heard in Zheng's tone of voice.</p>

  <p>"Your movement technique is amazing! It's absolutely intriguing and interesting to me!" Bentley didn't heed Zheng's words and turned his body in order to charge at him once again, his speed increasing by thirty percent.</p>

  <p>And just as before, Luo Zheng performed a set of footwork and even used the Eight Smoky Melodies in order to avoid the attack. His entire body danced in the air like a willow catkin, but Bentley's speed far exceeded the range that Luo Zheng could cope with. When he used the Eight Smoky Melodies, his greatest fear was absolute speed. In the blink of an eye, Bentley flashed behind Luo Zheng and quickly grabbed his lapel, throwing him into the distance.</p>

  <p>Whir!</p>

  <p>Zheng's body spun in the air and plummeted toward the other side of the main hall.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Bentley had shown a little mercy. Luo Zheng twisted his body in the air and glided along the ground for quite a few yards. He stood up as soon as he could and turned himself around.</p>

  <p>As he was standing there though, he began to feel an irresistible force coming from behind him, pushing him forward by several steps and almost knocking him down again. Luo Zheng suddenly looked very miserable.</p>

  <p>Malloy, Luke, and Declan quickly looked at each other. Their expressions were wild, their hearts in turmoil.</p>

  <p>They had invited Bentley to decide whether or not to keep Luo Zheng. After all, Bentley was the leader of sub-branches. They hadn't expected the fact that Bentley had never asked them about Zheng's origins and background, nor had he discussed whether to keep Luo Zheng with them. Instead, as soon as he had arrived, he had begun teasing Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>After all, he was a top-rank True God. Was there really any point in fooling around with a proving godly warrior? Did he not feel shameless?</p>

  <p>Moreover, Luo Zheng had been very tough when they threatened to expel him earlier. Would Bentley offend him by acting in such a way?</p>

  <p>Malloy was unsure of all this. After a moment of hesitation, he stretched out his hand and shouted, "Master Bentley..."</p>

  <p>Bentley ignored him and simply smiled with relish instead. "You haven't fallen yet? Then watch this!" With that, he once again turned into a gust of wind and floated toward Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>This time, Zheng's eyes flashed with a fierce light. He respected Bentley as a top-rank True God, but these repeated attacks were too much for him to handle right now. He didn't dodge the attack this time and only used a single hand to swipe at Bentley.</p>

  <p>Bentley's face revealed a look of contempt. In his opinion, a proving godly warrior was just as weak as a baby. He reached out his left hand in an attempt to brush away Zheng's right hand.</p>

  <p>However, just as he reached outward, Luo Zheng abruptly changed his hand's direction and firmly grabbed Bentley's arm like a pair of iron pincers.</p>

  <p>Given his reaction and speed though, it was very easy for Bentley to avoid Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Despite that though, he didn't attempt to dodge Luo Zheng at all. Instead, he planned to use brute force in order to break free from Zheng's grasp once he had caught his arm.</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, just as he tried to struggle free slightly, his expression suddenly froze.</p>
