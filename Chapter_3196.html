  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Sus and the Xus all had their mouths wide open as they saw Marco stand on the huge drum.</p>

  <p>Clueless young men from the Xu Clan were especially excited at the sight of Marco.</p>

  <p>"It's our young master! He is fighting Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>"Why is he fighting on our behalf?"</p>

  <p>This question was met with silence.</p>

  <p>For the Xu Clan members, Marco was a legendary figure. The Ripple Pavilion seemed too little for him to still fight for it.</p>

  <p>People from the Su Clan overheard the Xus' discussion and finally gained clarity.</p>

  <p>Cailen frowned and rubbed his chin. "The Xu Clan isn't after us. They're after Luo Zheng."</p>

  <p>Gant nodded in agreement. "The Xu Clan has figured out that we will ask Flag Master for help," he said.</p>

  <p>"The Xu Clan head doesn't look like he's fully onboard. Perhaps he was forced to do this. Maybe Luo Zheng had offended Marco?" Ruben assessed.</p>

  <p>"This is not good. As a direct descendant of Vastness Mountain, Marco's strength is extraordinary," Reid lamented.</p>

  <p>It was obvious that Marco intentionally arranged everything to trick Luo Zheng into fighting him. There was something going on between them. He couldn't possibly just want to teach Luo Zheng a lesson.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell the Flag Master just to admit defeat!" said Gant.</p>

  <p>However, Cailen stopped him. He shook his head helplessly and said, "This is already out of our hands now. It's too late for Luo Zheng to find a safe exit."</p>

  <p>Members of the other clans felt the tension as well.</p>

  <p>Since their first encounter, Marco had the urge to kill Luo Zheng. If Dorothy hadn't been around to stop him, he would have already done it.</p>

  <p>Since then, he had made sure to give Luo Zheng a hard time.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng thought that, after being hit by Milo, Marco would have been less motivated to go on full offensive. Yet he followed him all the way to Clear Lake.</p>

  <p>"You really are persistent," muttered Luo Zheng coldly.</p>

  <p>"There's only one way out for my enemies: death," Marco declared arrogantly. He pulled out a long sword with three dots of lights floating around it.</p>

  <p>Marco found Luo Zheng to be a nuisance. He wouldn't allow his life to be dictated by him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's brows furrowed, his expression sending a chill down some onlookers' backs. He found himself motivated to kill. If he did not kill this person, he would always be a trouble for him.</p>

  <p>The Snow Sword shook gently in Luo Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>Flashes of light danced all over it.</p>

  <p>Marco's Spirits Trinity released strong Other Shore Power.</p>

  <p>The water level of the Clear Lake rose, and with it came the drums in the water.</p>

  <p>Marco stomped.</p>

  <p>With a loud rumble, his body disappeared.</p>

  <p>In an instant, he was floating directly above Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Three-colored sword radiance was slashing towards Luo Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>With a swift raise of his arm, Luo Zheng blocked the attack with his Snow Sword.</p>

  <p>The two swords collided.</p>

  <p>"Speed!" said Marco.</p>

  <p>Red, green, and black rays shone from his sword light.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the red and black rays dissipated and the entire long sword turned into pure green.</p>

  <p>Then, he sped up.</p>

  <p>In a flash, Marco slashed his sword numerous times. The sword turned into swift curved lines. Anything that it touched broke into pieces.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng gazed at the slashing of the sword with a serious face.</p>

  <p>"Nine-Flash Light-splitting Swordsmanship!"</p>

  <p>This cultivation method was not destructive, but it was fast.</p>

  <p>The Snow Sword in Luo Zheng's hand shone like a snowflake.</p>

  <p>In a matter of three seconds, the two swords collided into each other over and over again. Neither Marco nor Luo Zheng was willing to pull back.</p>

  <p>"What quick strikes! Young Master is awesome!"</p>

  <p>"That's the Speed Spirit of the three spirits. It greatly increases speed."</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng is better, I think. He has only used the Truth of Divine Dao to block Marco's attacks."</p>

  <p>The spectators held their breath. It wasn't every day that they witnessed such an intense battle.</p>

  <p>Marco was starting to look distressed as he was constantly blocked by Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He already lost to Luo Zheng last time. He knew he relied on a strengthening type of Other Shore Token, but he didn't expect him to have cultivated the Nine-Flash Light-splitting Swordsmanship.</p>

  <p>The fight lasted for half a minute.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was still calm and composed, while Marco started to retreat.</p>

  <p>With a soft touch on his sword blade, he declared, "Absorb!"</p>

  <p>In an instant, the Speed Spirit disappeared.</p>

  <p>The green light on the long sword vanished and, in its place, stood a blood sword.</p>

  <p>With a sly smile, Marco stepped forward.</p>

  <p>His long sword emitted a red light which slashed directly towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Marco's movements were slow, but the demonic red blood sword seemed to contain some strange power.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng tried to block the attack with his sword, Marco's eyes shot up.</p>

  <p>His lips curved into a sinister smile. "Stupid," he murmured.</p>

  <p>The two swords met.</p>

  <p>Then, to Luo Zheng's surprise, the Other Shore Power in his sword faded quickly.</p>

  <p>Marco's red long sword was like a black hole, constantly absorbing his power!</p>

  <p>"This is..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes widened as he drew his sword away.</p>

  <p>"Nine-Flash Light-splitting Swordsmanship!"</p>

  <p>Rays of white light dashed quickly towards Marco again in full speed.</p>

  <p>He was trying to force Marco to back away.</p>

  <p>However, Marco stood his ground unfazed. He was determined to maintain his proximity with Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's sword radiance was quick, but Marco's long sword acted as a shield.</p>

  <p>All of Luo Zheng's attacks were effectively blocked.</p>

  <p>Apart from that, the long sword also weakened Luo Zheng's Other Shore Power.</p>

  <p>Every time their swords touched, Luo Zheng's sword weakened.</p>

  <p>"Young Master is using Absorption Spirit!"</p>

  <p>"It can directly absorb the Other Shore Power of the opponent."</p>

  <p>"Doesn't that make him invincible?"</p>

  <p>People in the audience began to speculate.</p>

  <p>The Spirits Trinity was one of the best Other Shore Tokens in the Lust World. It was also one of the rarest. Luo Zheng was definitely on the losing end.</p>

  <p>A round of intense attacks did not break Marco's defenses. Instead, Luo Zheng's Other Shower Power had weakened immensely. In desperation, Luo Zheng flew away. He wanted to be as far away from Marco as possible.</p>

  <p>However, Marco remained strong and motivated. He was definitely not going to let Luo Zheng escape that easily.</p>
