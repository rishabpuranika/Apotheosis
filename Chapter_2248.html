<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>In Luo Zheng's eyes, a Demi-holy Being was almost an omnipotent existence.</p>

  <p>'What does she want from me?' he thought.</p>

  <p>"Last time, you motivated the disciples of our Purple Soul Hall, and their rankings have risen significantly in the Arena of Legends, but? It is far from enough!" Joy said lightly.</p>

  <p>The Purple Soul Hall was highly important to Joy. Thus, how could she bear to expel those disciples?</p>

  <p>Everyone had their own ambitions, and a Demi-holy being was no different.</p>

  <p>"It's far from enough, but what does it have to do with me..." asked Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>There were more than thirty thousand people in the Purple Soul Hall. It was too many of them.</p>

  <p>Thus, she couldn't rely on Luo Luo Zheng alone to increase the Purple Soul Hall's total number of points, could she?</p>

  <p>He did earn a lot of points recently, but it was just a drop in the bucket compared to the entirety of the Purple Soul Hall.</p>

  <p>"I want you to earn more points," Joy gazed at Luo Luo Zheng and said with a smile.</p>

  <p>"More? How many?" he asked incredulously. He was clearly quite speechless. He never expected that his speculation would turn out right.</p>

  <p>Perhaps, Joy really planned to pin all her hopes on him to turn the tables around.</p>

  <p>"You need to earn one million and two hundred thousand points more.</p>

  <p>That is equivalent to every Purple Soul Hall disciple earning forty points on average. If that still doesn't work, then I will have no choice but to eliminate the ten percent of the disciples who are ranked at the bottom,"</p>

  <p>Joy calculated as her lips curved up into a charming smile.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng almost choked in disbelief as he heard the number. He paused for a while before he repeated, "One million and two hundred thousand points..."</p>

  <p>To his surprise, Joy replied flatly, "Yes. Is it difficult? Back then, I earned three million points in the Arena of Legends!"</p>

  <p>"What was your cultivation level at that time, Master?" asked Luo Luo Zheng. "A consummate True God!"</p>

  <p>"??"</p>

  <p>There was a pause. Luo Luo Zheng couldn't help but roll his eyes at her.</p>

  <p>Of course, the True Gods at the consummate level naturally had many, many points.</p>

  <p>They had so much that the top masters recorded on the Jade Wall of Legends had over a million points!</p>

  <p>It was safe to say that the several consummate True Gods from some clans could directly determine their clans' rankings!</p>

  <p>However, there were only a few consummate True Gods in each clan.</p>

  <p>Unlike the battles of ordinary True Gods, which were usually held three times every month, a battle between consummate True Gods often drew great attention. So much that sometimes, there wasn't a single fight between consummate True Gods once every few years.</p>

  <p>Since the points of powerful warriors at the top rarely had significant changes, many clans focused on the True Gods at the bottom to improve the overall points. It was a more practical and stable way to keep their rankings. After all, some consummate True Gods might lose hundreds of thousands or even over a million points in one battle.</p>

  <p>"Defeating a proving godly warrior in a battle only earns me several hundred points, and that already includes the extra points as a reward.</p>

  <p>Wouldn't it be ridiculous to ask me to earn so many points?" Luo Luo Zheng asked calmly. He felt much more relaxed now in front of Joy, now that he had discovered that she was easy to get along with.</p>

  <p>It was true that he could win several hundred points in a match, which included the points that rewarded by consecutive wins. Without those extra points, he would've only ended up with three points in the next fight--and that was if he won.</p>

  <p>A lost match meant a great reduction of his points, and even if he won all the time, he couldn't get the one million and two hundred thousand points Joy asked of him. Such a request was equivalent to asking an ant to carry a mountain. It was impossible.</p>

  <p>However, Joy continued, "You don't fully understand the rules of the Arena of Legends..."</p>

  <p>Upon hearing her words, he shrugged his shoulders in agreement and sat down on the stairs to listen attentively.</p>

  <p>"By this time, after you've won a series of consecutive matches, your points have already surpassed that of the proving godly warrior who is ranked first. In fact, you can apply for the battles at the level of low-rank True Gods to compete with the ones at a higher level," she said.</p>

  <p>It was known that the rules of the Jade Wall of Legends were relatively complicated. Although Luo Luo Zheng somehow understood them, almost all his knowledge about the rules came from Madam Moon. Thus, he hadn't thoroughly comprehended them yet.</p>

  <p>He couldn't believe his ears. "To compete with the ones at a higher level?</p>

  <p>You want me to challenge those True Gods who are a level higher than I am?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, and not only that, you also need to maintain your winning streak,"</p>

  <p>Joy finished with a smile.</p>

  <p>It was immensely difficult to earn points in the Arena of Legends, but the rewards for consecutive wins were quite great. It was just like rolling a snowball. The more consecutive wins one had, the more points one could get.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng thought deeply. He could steadily earn a lot of points in the battles against proving godly warriors, but the points earned from battles fighting warriors at the same level were far from enough, even with the extra reward included.</p>

  <p>However, the battles against warriors at higher levels was a different story!</p>

  <p>The basic reward for a proving godly warrior to win against a low-rank True God was as many as one hundred points.</p>

  <p>And since it was very difficult for a proven godly warrior to defeat a low-rank True God, the reward for consecutive wins was even greater.</p>

  <p>Two consecutive wins had an additional prize of over a thousand points, and winning three times in a row had an additional prize of two thousand points. If one managed to repeatedly stack up such numbers, they would clearly have a staggering number of points.</p>

  <p>Obviously, such a reward meant more than hard work. It was very difficult for a proven godly warrior to have consecutive wins in the battles challenging low-rank True Gods.</p>

  <p>Even a Demi-holy Being like Joy had been defeated by her opponents after winning four battles in a row back when she had challenged low-rank True Gods as a proven godly warrior.</p>

  <p>In the records of the divine land, there were a few Holy Beings who had achieved an impressive number of consecutive wins.</p>

  <p>For example, the Holy Emperor of the Han Clan had managed to snag sixteen consecutive wins, and as a proven godly warrior, he had accumulated more than a hundred thousand points in one go. It had greatly shocked many powerful clans at that time.</p>

  <p>However, that wasn't even the most surprising. There had once been a genius who had completed twenty-seven consecutive wins, and accumulated three hundred and ninety thousand points in one go. Even some of the extremely powerful top-rank True Gods, who had been working hard in the Arena of Legends, could only gain about two hundred thousand points. Consecutive wins could actually make a big difference.</p>

  <p>However, one could dissect how difficult it was to achieve so many consecutive wins. As one accumulated more points, they would also be faced with more powerful True Gods. Thus, it was almost impossible for a proving godly warrior to win all the time by relying only on their cultivation.</p>

  <p>"You defeated Keenan and killed Sheridan. They are the best of the low-rank True Gods. I believe it is possible for you to achieve that goal with your strength," Joy said and smiled.</p>

  <p>'So that explains it, ' Luo Luo Zheng thought as realization hit him.</p>

  <p>The reward for competing with those beyond his level, plus the additional reward for consecutive wins?</p>

  <p>When combined together, he thought that he did have the potential to accumulate a lot of points in a short time.</p>

  <p>Points were very important to him. Moreover, he also wanted to break through to become a True God! Furthermore, he was also determined to get the reward from the Han Clan. He needed the mud, which was in that treasure that the Han Clan offered as a reward. More importantly, he needed enough points to go to Everest Spirit Mountain. To top all of those off, he also had to prove his worth to Joy and the Han Clan, since Joy was now protecting him.</p>

  <p>"I see," he said and nodded.</p>

  <p>"Give me your jade token," Joy suddenly said and reached out to him.</p>

  <p>His hands fished out the jade token from his pocket and handed it to her.</p>

  <p>Then, Joy gently stroke the token with her slender fingers until it glowed green. She gave it back to him and said, "Now, when you go into the Arena of Legends, your opponent can't find out your name. In other words, it is like you're anonymous."</p>

  <p>"Really? Can it even work in this way?" he asked. Curiosity filled his mind as he took back his jade token.</p>

  <p>"It's normal. Some warriors from the rich and powerful clans would do so when they don't want to attract attention. But the anonymous function only works on your opponents that challenge you. Once you lose, your name will appear on the ranking list," Joy said. "And... From now on, you can enter the Arena of Legends from here," she added.</p>

  <p>As soon as she was done, she clapped her hands.</p>

  <p>The hall began to vibrate slightly as the Jade Wall of Legends, which was thirty feet tall, rose from the ground. This Jade Wall of Legends was rather small compared to an ordinary one, but it was possible for three people to enter the Arena of Legends at the same time.</p>

  <p>Joy was a little tired after she had finished her arrangement. A yawn escaped her lips, then she said, "You can enter the Arena of Legends at any time. I've already helped you apply for the battles to challenge warriors at a higher level. I'll have to rest first..."</p>

  <p>Once she was done speaking, her body emanated a purple mist that surrounded her. The mist soon dissipated, and so did she.</p>

  <p>'I can't believe a Demi-holy Being would feel sleepy. She must be acting; it's too obvious, ' Luo Luo Zheng thought as he pursed his lips.</p>

  <p>After a few moments, he walked towards the Jade Wall and inserted his own jade token into it.</p>

  <p>"Buzz-"</p>

  <p>The Jade Wall of Legends started to tremble, and some information about him began to appear on it. Just as what Joy had said after she helped him to become anonymous, his name was blurry, and there was no way for anyone to know it.</p>
