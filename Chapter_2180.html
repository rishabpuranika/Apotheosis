<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Upon noticing Malloy's expression then, Luo Zheng realized that something was definitely wrong. At the same time though, Master Evil came to his mind with a reminder. "Luo Zheng, you have to be careful. You seem to have triggered the Thousand Commandments Slate," he said.</p>

  <p>Before, in the Mirror City, Luo Zheng had already witnessed the Ten Commandments Slate's power. The Thousand Commandments Slate in the Six-Burden Divine City was much more powerful than the Ten Commandments Slate. Nevertheless, never had he thought that the Heavenly Han House would be so careless. They obviously knew the danger of triggering the Thousand Commandments Slate, and yet they still held such a test!</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>The ear-piercing claps of thunder were approaching, coming from the horizon and heading straight toward the Heavenly Han House.</p>

  <p>Many intelligent warriors seemed to come to their own conclusions on what was going on and scattered in all directions in an attempt to avoid Luo Zheng. They were afraid that they would be implicated in the Thousand Commandments Slate's punishment. It wasn't before long that the ball lightning broke through the Heavenly Han House's enchanted barrier and plummeted toward Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>The power contained within this lightning ball was enough to heavily injure and even kill a True God. The second it plummeted into the Heavenly Han House, the powerful thunder energy formed a strong electric field, causing the hair of the hundred thousand proving godly warriors to stand on end.</p>

  <p>Everyone had one same thought in their minds: this guy, who also went by the name of Tianxing, was absolutely doomed!</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, most people didn't have any conflicts with Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>After they understood the whole of the situation, they usually felt nothing but pity for him. Luo Zheng had easily set an incredible record and his great talent would have, without a doubt, promised him a bright future. It was an unfortunate tragedy that he would die because of the Heavenly Han House's negligence.</p>

  <p>To the contrary of most though, in Eric's and Zane's perspectives, Luo Zheng simply deserved it.</p>

  <p>From the moment Luo Zheng triggered the Thousand Commandments Slate to the moment the Thousand Commandments Slate imposed its punishment, less than a total of six seconds had passed.</p>

  <p>Elder Chen was ready to use the Veto Token as Malloy had asked him to.</p>

  <p>In fact, even if Malloy wouldn't have promised to compensate him with a new one, he would still have saved Zheng's life without hesitation. As the greatest True God of the Heavenly Han House, he still held this responsibility on his shoulders!</p>

  <p>However, as he patted his waist though, the features on his face began to distort themselves again. He forced an embarrassed and bitter smile as he said, "I didn't bring the Veto Token with me..."</p>

  <p>Upon hearing Elder Chen's words, Malloy's heart sank and he felt overwhelmed with defeat. It seemed that Luo Zheng was truly doomed this time.</p>

  <p>The lightning ball was zooming in on Luo Zheng, and it was about to hit him.</p>

  <p>Something had to be done! It was a critical moment.</p>

  <p>In one of the far corners of the place, a girl could be seen wearing green clothes and blinking her eyes. She tilted her head slightly as she swayed her slender arm, and a token suddenly appeared in her hand. This token had the same shape of the White Jade Token, but the color and material were different. In the middle of the token, the word 'Veto' was written in big.</p>

  <p>This was the Six-Burden Divine City's Veto Token! Unbelievable!</p>

  <p>The Veto Tokens were made by the Han Clan, and generally speaking, they could negate most of the rules on the Thousand Commandments Slate.</p>

  <p>Of course, the Han Clan knew that if there were too many Veto Tokens, the Thousand Commandments Slate would become nothing more than a decoration— no one would take it seriously anymore. This mattered to the safety of the Six-Burden Divine City, and thus, the Han Clan only made very few Veto Tokens. A Veto Token could sell for over twenty thousand divine might coins in the Six-Burden Divine City.</p>

  <p>Even if someone could pay such a sky-high price, they'd still find it difficult to actually obtain a Veto Token. Currently, even the sub-branches of Han Clan only had three Veto Tokens in their hands. None of them belonged to Malloy.</p>

  <p>Elder Chen, on his behalf, had made a great contribution for the Heavenly Han House by discovering two excellent disciples for the Holy Emperor. That was why the Han Clan had rewarded him with a Veto Token. However, he had neglected to bring the Veto Token with him, therefore he couldn't offer to save Luo Zheng from the danger.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The lightning ball was no more than three feet away from Luo Zheng now.</p>

  <p>Malloy and the other True Gods of the Heavenly Han House had all subconsciously closed their eyes, partially in fear of what was to come and partially because they were all unwilling to watch his tragic death.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was already prepared to use his Redemption Armor in order to protect his body and then use his greatest strength to defend against the lightning ball. Even though he felt that his chances were slim, he knew he had no other choice. Despite this, a bitter feeling still arose in his heart. He never expected that his life would end like this, in such a ridiculous way!</p>

  <p>Right at that moment, the Veto Token in the girl's hand, who was still standing in the corner suddenly emitted a red light, and with an incomparably fast speed, the token flew out of the Heavenly Han House, crossed half of the Six-Burden Divine City in the blink of an eye, and struck the Thousand Commandments Slate straight on. Simultaneously, the lightning ball strangely stopped above Zheng's head, kind of just hovering there, just a couple of feet away from him. Even the lightning surrounding it, which resembled thousands of little snakes, had frozen like statues.</p>

  <p>Following a slight flash of light from the Thousand Commandments Slate, the rule was temporarily negated. The lightning ball began to disperse rapidly, and all the energy contained within it quickly disappeared without a trace.</p>
