  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Nine Li members chose to believe Luo Zheng, irrespective of whether Luo Zheng was joking or not.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had proved himself to be a member of the Nine Li race. They couldn't test his blood lineage on the Other Shore, let alone test his blood purity. But the best proof lay in the fact that he had three heads and six arms.</p>

  <p>"Tianxing, you belong to the royal family. How did you become a member of the Taiyi Heaven Palace?" Sally's brother asked again.</p>

  <p>Their curiosity about Luo Zheng had surpassed that about the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>The Ear Mice had addressed Luo Zheng 'Tianxing' at the entrance of the Grand Sky Temple. Thus, those Nine Li members thought that that was his real name.</p>

  <p>"It's a long story," Luo Zheng said cautiously. "I hope you will ask the elders of Nine Li race to come to the Taiyi Heaven Palace someday. I want to meet them if possible."</p>

  <p>Both sides had tried to trust each other but were still far from reaching a place where they could share everything.</p>

  <p>Sally's brother would not disclose the location of the remaining members of the Nine Li race, nor would Luo Zheng tell them where the divine land was.</p>

  <p>"I will report this to the elders of our race," Sally's brother said.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng was really Lorena's son and possessed such amazing abilities, the remaining members of the Nine Li race would fall over themselves to meet him in the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>The Nine Li race and the Taiyi Heaven Palace had never been enemies. The beliefs that they had chosen to follow were the same, which meant that the Taiyi Heaven Palace could still ensure their safety and peace.</p>

  <p>These people then introduced themselves to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"My name is Hutton," Sally's brother said.</p>

  <p>"My name is Sally. It's so nice to meet you, Tianxing," the girl said with a smile.</p>

  <p>Once all the members had introduced themselves to Luo Zheng, Hutton said to him, "Tianxing, you can't break the wall with just brute force. Forcing it open will only lead you into fatal trouble."</p>

  <p>Both Luo Zheng and Dorothy had been through what Hutton was describing.</p>

  <p>Even Luo Zheng's corporeal body was unable to resist the two armors. A Soul of Light would definitely suffer grave consequences if fighting against the armors.</p>

  <p>"Do you know how to get inside?" Luo Zheng asked Hutton.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Hutton replied.</p>

  <p>He was beginning to trust Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Although they didn't completely trust each other, it wouldn't be so bad to explore the Dark Region together. After all, even Hutton wasn't confident about exploring the Dark Region. All he got were the clues that the Nine Li race had left behind.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng gestured wordlessly towards the square entrance of the basement.</p>

  <p>Hutton nodded before walking to the entrance with Sally and the other members of the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>"Oh, here you are!"</p>

  <p>A cold voice rang out from the entrance of the tower.</p>

  <p>The group became nervous at the voice. Dorothy frowned.</p>

  <p>It was Feng Ge, leading the disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>When they were about to enter the temple, Chaim and Feng Ge wanted to follow Luo Zheng. But Luo Zheng refused them. He had agreed to cooperate with the Ear Mice and brought only Dorothy to enter it.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge, Chaim, and many other disciples walked through another passageway.</p>

  <p>They explored the yard for a while before choosing a tower to enter.</p>

  <p>Some of the Souls of Light, who had entered the Grand Sky Temple, had died in the passageways. Half of the others had died in the basement, and the other half had gone into the towers like Feng Ge's group did.</p>

  <p>Feng Gei and Chaim were unlucky. Their exploration had dug up nothing, thanks to the many traps in the tower. Feng Ge had finally suggested that they move to another tower.</p>

  <p>As soon as she arrived here, she saw Luo Zheng and Dorothy.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing here. Chaim, please take her away," Dorothy said coldly.</p>

  <p>Her face turned gloomy the moment she saw Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>Before Chaim could say anything, Feng Ge burst out at Dorothy. "What do you think of yourself? You think this is your Origin Mountain? Is it Princess Dorothy who has the final say?"</p>

  <p>"You are right. It is me!" Dorothy stared at her fiercely.</p>

  <p>The fight between the two women confused the people around them.</p>

  <p>Hutton looked at Luo Zheng, a little worried. Only Luo Zheng could make the final decision here.</p>

  <p>"Dorothy, now that we have entered the Grand Sky Temple, don't we have the right to choose where we continue our exploration? We are all from the Taiyi Heaven Palace and are on the same side. If anything should happen, we can take care of each other. Tianxing, what do you think? Am I right?"</p>

  <p>Chaim tried to broker the peace between Dorothy and Feng Ge, with a hard but polite smile on his face.</p>

  <p>He had seen the square entrance the moment he entered the tower.</p>

  <p>Though he didn't know what had happened here, he guessed it was probably related to the way leading to the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>Chaim didn't want to miss such an amazing opportunity.</p>

  <p>Dorothy pursed her lips, not knowing how to respond.</p>

  <p>It would have been fine if Feng Ge hadn't been with the group. Dorothy wouldn't have minded Chaim and the other disciples from the Taiyi Heaven Palace going with them.</p>

  <p>"Yes, we are on the same side. We can take care of each other as we explore this place together," Luo Zheng said, nodding.</p>

  <p>The Souls of Light of the Ear Mice were all dead by now. Luo Zheng could trust both the group from the Taiyi Heaven Palace and the Nine Li members. If Dorothy were to disagree even now, there would eventually be a collision between the Origin Mountain and the Taiyi Mountain.</p>

  <p>Dorothy knew she shouldn't cross the line. Now that Luo Zheng had made his decision, all she could do was reluctantly agree with him.</p>

  <p>Hutton and his group were also reluctant, but they were more careful about expressing their thoughts.</p>

  <p>"Come with us then," Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>Hutton, Sally, and the other members of the Nine Li race went in first. Luo Zheng and Dorothy followed them, while Chaim, Feng Ge, and the disciples came last.</p>

  <p>As they walked through the passageway, Chaim questioned Luo Zheng about the whereabouts of the Ear Mice. Luo Zheng sighed and said, "They're all dead."</p>

  <p>"The Ear Mice... All dead?" Chaim froze.</p>

  <p>He couldn't believe what he was hearing. All the Ear Mice were cunning.</p>

  <p>Many of them had entered the Grand Sky Temple, but now they were all dead. How was that possible?</p>

  <p>"Not only them. More than a thousand non-human Souls of Light also died in this basement," Luo Zheng said, and then proceeded to tell them what had happened in the basement.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge, Chaim, and the disciples stopped short, shocked at Luo Zheng's revelations.</p>

  <p>If this basement was that dangerous, did it mean that anyone who entered it would be courting death?</p>

  <p>"You don't have to follow us if you are afraid," Dorothy said as she turned to look at Feng Ge. Her voice had a provoking bite to it.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge couldn't stand ridicule. She merely snorted and continued on her way.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng laughed. "Don't be nervous, Chaim. We are safe in the basement, because they've a solution," he said.</p>

  <p>"The solution..." Chaim looked doubtfully at Hutton's group and asked,</p>

  <p>"Which force of the human race do these people belong to?"</p>

  <p>Both the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race had been expelled. All the other human forces were small ones. If these people really knew the way to the Dark Region, it was impossible that they were from those small forces.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng said with an easy smile, "Don't ask improper questions if you want to follow us to explore the Dark Region."</p>
