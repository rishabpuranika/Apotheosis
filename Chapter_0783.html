<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 783 Worry (Part One) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The woman clothed in black robes stood atop the disc as her gaze locked once more on the dice positioned in the middle of the abyss. As they all held their breath in anticipation of her next outcome, the dice began to rapidly spin once again.</p>

  <p>After a while of tossing and turning, the dice gradually slowed to a stop.</p>

  <p>One of the spectators gasped in wonder as the number that appeared on top of the cube was yet another success. "It's six again!"</p>

  <p>"How is she so lucky?" another person wondered.</p>

  <p>By this point, everyone watching the affair had more or less understood that they were engaging in a special game of Mist Celestial Tomb. As for why Mist had specifically designed this game, no one had a definite explanation.</p>

  <p>However, since everyone playing the game arrived at the same starting line, all they could think about was not falling behind the other participants.</p>

  <p>Before the woman had started, the highest number of dots that a martial artist had thrown was a six. As luck would have it, this strange woman managed to obtain a second chance at throwing the dice right after throwing it once. It was indeed a subject of fascination to everyone who had witnessed the perplexing phenomena.</p>

  <p>'Who would have thought that she would roll the dice and get another six?' an onlooker contemplated by himself as he scratched his chin absentmindedly.</p>

  <p>Not a long moment had passed by when another six discs appeared in front of the nonchalant woman dressed in black. Moreover, the last disk that emerged seemingly still had a faint golden glow surrounding it, as if a halo of yellow light had encircled the object.</p>

  <p>Glancing at the newly materialized disk, the woman casually strode towards it without preamble. Immediately after she had fully stood on it, that voice rang out again.</p>

  <p>"Throw the dice again."</p>

  <p>Upon hearing this, almost everyone in the arena had groaned in great displeasure. "Really, again?" one of them grumbled in dissatisfaction and palmed his forehead. It seemed to be the case that they were having the same realization; this woman appeared to be even luckier than Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps, is she cheating?" a member of the audience whispered conspiratorially to the person standing beside him.</p>

  <p>"That would be impossible since this tomb was set up by an immortal. It is literally impossible to cheat here," the martial artist near him confirmed as he tapped his foot impatiently.</p>

  <p>"Maybe these people from the divine kingdom have grasped some trick that we do not know about! Otherwise, how else would they have such good luck?"</p>

  <p>As his ears picked up on the doubtful conversations from the people around him, the elegant man scoffed and rolled his eyes. "She is our clan's Holy Maiden," he snapped at them. "How can her luck even be compared to you ants'?" the man insulted, his face adorned with a confident sneer.</p>

  <p>The admittedly handsome man's sudden assertions seemingly offended all the martial artists in the Central Region. As they all turned away from the self-assured male with disdain and annoyance, the fighters started to avoid speaking too loudly in his presence.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng covered his mouth bemusedly as he smiled faintly at the exchange.</p>

  <p>Such a typical conversation never failed to entertain him.</p>

  <p>Perhaps it was unusual for the elders and heads of large sects to have a firsthand experience of being provoked and blatantly looked down upon just like the man had recently done. However, Luo Luo Zheng knew more than anyone else at the tomb that it was pointless to give too much unnecessary attention to a bumbling overconfident idiot. After having encountered too many people who exhibited the exact same kind of behavior, he had almost completely grown insensitive to this kind of stupid provocation. When Perrin had deeply aggravated him before, Luo Luo Zheng immediately became frustrated and found himself not being able to restrain his anger as much as he could now.</p>

  <p>However, meeting such like-minded fools for the past few years enabled him to let go feelings of ire and infuriation, as Luo Luo Zheng now settled with mild exasperation when dealing with them.</p>

  <p>The young man's experience for the past few years did not only help him strengthen his physical capabilities and power, but also help him grow with emotional and mental maturity.</p>

  <p>Glancing briefly at the proud man amidst the scattered martial artists, he smirked at himself and shook his head. Every single guy that had the same attitude was one and the same through and through; they would be that sort of person who would only beg for mercy if they were suddenly slapped hard across the face. Until that moment when they had realized that they were worth close to nothing, their words would always be exceptionally sharp and close to being tyrannical.</p>

  <p>Therefore, when Luo Luo Zheng had heard the loud booming voice of the confident man's words, he did not bother to react at all.</p>

  <p>While the commotion with the baseless dignified man was happening, the beam of light in the middle from the dice began its process of spinning again.</p>

  <p>Apart from Ning Yudie and the Holy Maiden from the divine kingdom, there were a couple of other individuals who had received good rewards. An exhibit of this would be the disciple of Ethereal Spirit Sect having obtained a golden page from the contest. Although no one was too certain of what the purpose of the golden page was, they had guessed that the page might be about some kind of special cultivation method, or maybe it might actually be a treasure in itself.</p>

  <p>However fortunate Ning Yudie, the woman in black, and some other people might have been, they could not deny that more warriors were being punished.</p>

  <p>The Bloodwood Cliff, even the Black Mountain Sect, as well as the Mysterious Luna Hall had distressingly lost six people each in the first round itself.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng was lucky enough to be the second person to be pointed at, he had only taken two steps himself and was actually a bit behind, which slightly annoyed him.</p>

  <p>While he observed the radiant light beam as it spun continuously, the cyan dragon hummed and started to speak. "Luo Luo Zheng, I think I know what this is."</p>

  <p>Intrigued, Luo Luo Zheng straightened his posture and uttered, "Tell me."</p>

  <p>The man had deeply contemplated by himself ever since the event had started about the possible reason why Mist would design such a game that resembled the act of gambling.</p>

  <p>"This may look like a game, but strictly speaking, it should be a Wheel of Fortune," the cyan dragon stated straightforwardly.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng tilted his head to one side, his confusion becoming apparent as he asked once more, "Wheel of Fortune? What does that mean?" The man inquired with a new sense of boundless curiosity.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon replied with a resolved tone, "Look at it this way, Luo Luo Zheng. In the eyes of martial artists, fortune may appear to be a bit mysterious, but it really does exist. In the Central Region, martial artists are usually assessed in two aspects. The first is their talent; the second is their willpower."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded in understanding at what the cyan dragon had said. It was an accurate presumption that strengthening one's willpower was equally important if a martial artist wanted to get stronger. Otherwise, even if a martial artist had prodigious talent, he would only indulge in pleasure and meaningless desires if he had mediocre willpower. No matter how much potential a cultivator might have or how many battles he might go through, it would definitely be impossible to succeed if he didn't have a strong willpower.</p>

  <p>With this inconceivable fact, all sects' first choice when recruiting disciples would be based on testing their individual talent, with the second being their willpower.</p>
