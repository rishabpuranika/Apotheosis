  <p>Both Raleign and Leacock flew into an unprecedented rage.</p>

  <p>The two of them were well-known in the Murphy Universe given their status as grand world lords. They were only second to Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>The difference between a Supreme Lord and a grand word lord was a single Heavenly Destiny.</p>

  <p>Both of them had been promoted to generals by the Sacred race and in turn, led their armies into the Evolutionary Universe. They left nothing but destruction in their path and feared no one in the entire Evolutionary Universe, save for human Supreme Lords of course.</p>

  <p>Just a year ago, the grand world lord of the Sunset World used a Roaring Token to challenge Raleign to a battle to the death. The two exchanged thousands of blows and the fight ended in Raleign's favor.</p>

  <p>That grand world lord who unfortunately perished was the one who gave Luo Luo Zheng the reward when the latter participated in Passing the Torch.</p>

  <p>The difference between a world lord's strength and a grand world lord's power was great.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had just reached the cultivation level of a world lord. However, he was able to rely on his cultivation to break apart a Blood Curse Array and kill four warriors of the Sacred race. He didn't even try to escape and even managed to destroy another Blood Curse Array. How could Raleign and Leacock bear this?</p>

  <p>They did not care about the Blood Curse Array at that point; all they wanted was to capture Luo Luo Zheng and make him pay the price for playing around with them like this.</p>

  <p>The world lord who held the lightning-introducing stone had no way of knowing what the two grand world lords were thinking about. All he did was watch the lightning bolts descend upon and shatter the Blood Curse Array before him.</p>

  <p>The two grand world lords had already used the Grand Teleportation to chase after Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, when they arrived the blood pool north of the city, they didn't see Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The two of them exchanged glares and quickly pinned the blame on each other for the failure of their chase.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, on the other hand, had moved to the blood pool east of the city.</p>

  <p>Raleign quickly noticed and gritted his teeth in anger. He immediately rushed towards the east side.</p>

  <p>"Don't!" Leacock stopped him. "His goal is to destroy the Blood Curse Arrays above these four blood pools. He'll come to us sooner or later. We just need to wait and catch him off guard to kill him easily."</p>

  <p>Leacock was the more level-headed of the two. Luo Luo Zheng had effectively launched sneak attacks and caught the four world lords off-guard.</p>

  <p>Leacock then decided to have Luo Luo Zheng taste his own medicine and use his own strategy against him.</p>

  <p>"That brat is a mere world lord. Do we really need to be sneaky to kill him?" Raleign complained.</p>

  <p>"I don't think he's an ordinary world lord, do you?" Leacock shot back.</p>

  <p>Raleign stiffened at Leacock's question.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had just broken the Four Images Time Barrier, a famous Sacred race's enchanted barrier that could only be destroyed by a special method. Not even Leacock and Raleign were able to break it when they tried using brute force.</p>

  <p>It wasn't just them. No one else in the Murphy Universe could break such a thing using brute force, yet Luo Luo Zheng did it so effortlessly.</p>

  <p>This seemingly ordinary world lord had shattered a supposedly unbreakable barrier with just brute force.</p>

  <p>"Since he dared to attack the Ultimate Immortal City, he surely has someone powerful backing him up. We have to be careful in dealing with him." Leacock then raised his head and watched as lightning struck and shattered the third Blood Curse Array in the distance.</p>

  <p>"He should be coming," he murmured.</p>

  <p>Raleign couldn't help but agree with Leacock's words. He had initially regarded Luo Luo Zheng as a mere rat that wanted to cause trouble.</p>

  <p>He had been toyed by this rat so he naturally felt vexed.</p>

  <p>However, Leacock's reasoning enlightened him. He had to calm down and understand just how terrifying their opponent was.</p>

  <p>The two reached an understanding. They quickly spread out their perception, covering the blood pool and waited for Luo Luo Zheng to make his move.</p>

  <p>A few seconds later, the two of them felt a wave of energy fluctuation from the left front. Suddenly, a bright light flickered.</p>

  <p>"He's here!" Leacock couldn't help but sneer at the thought of finally eliminating Luo Luo Zheng. With a light sweep of his finger, black thorns appeared from thin air and circled around him. These thorns then formed a huge cage that completely covered the places where they felt the fluctuation of Space Law.</p>

  <p>Raleign's hands had now transformed into fiery, giant claws, ready to slash his opponent.</p>

  <p>However, the fluctuation lasted only for a moment and then disappeared.</p>

  <p>"He didn't come?"</p>

  <p>"This kid is too smart!"</p>

  <p>Once again, the two of them had gotten played by Luo Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>At that moment, a voice spoke from behind them. "Are you waiting for me?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled faintly as he looked at the two grand world lords who were clearly shocked at his sudden presence.</p>

  <p>The two grand world lords turned around at the same time, their faces revealing surprise. Raleign gave him a hideous smile. "I thought you had escaped."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smirked. "Why would I run away?"</p>

  <p>"You are indeed brave!" Leacock said. "However, mere courage is not enough. To not know when to retreat is courting death!"</p>

  <p>"If I were to face a mighty warrior, to not know when to retreat would indeed be courting death. However, am I not faced against two nameless people whose strength is not even worth mentioning?"</p>

  <p>The two of them froze at Luo Zheng's words.</p>

  <p>There was something that didn't sit right with the human world lord before them. He was definitely stronger than what they had anticipated.</p>

  <p>Only an arrogant idiot would dare say those words to his opponents, or a fellow who truly possessed extraordinary strength.</p>

  <p>From the looks of it, this young man was the latter.</p>

  <p>So did he really think he had the capacity to defeat two grand world lords?</p>

  <p>"Kill him," Leacock said.</p>

  <p>Raleign had been itching to do just that. He rushed towards Luo Luo Zheng like a black roc and used his fiery red claws to swipe at him.</p>

  <p>"Ghost Claw Strike!"</p>

  <p>Red scales, containing boundless power, appeared on his hands. The hands contained boundless power!</p>

  <p>Leacock, behind him, was drawing nonstop in the air. Small green circles of light spread out from his fingertips one after the other, enveloping both Luo Luo Zheng and Raleign.</p>

  <p>"Finger Burst!"</p>

  <p>This was a token that could only be used with the Truth Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>Leacock's Divine Dao was the Truth Divine Dao, the same as Nathan's.</p>

  <p>However, he wasn't a Godly Genius.</p>

  <p>Each universe had a different symbol for a Godly Genius.</p>

  <p>In the Evolutionary Universe, a warrior became a Godly Genius if he activated the 36-petal Lotus Flower.</p>

  <p>In the Murphy Universe, a warrior should be able to grow leaves on the spinulose wood fern? a black, withered tree. If one had an understanding of the Divine Dao, a leaf would grow from the tree.</p>

  <p>It was only after 3, 000 leaves growing on the tree would one be considered a Godly Genius.</p>

  <p>Leacock's spinulose wood fern only had 2, 300 leaves and it had not grown another one for the past thousand years. It was hopeless for him to ever become a Godly Genius.</p>

  <p>Before the invasion, he had been summoned by the Supreme Lords. That event really motivated him in proving himself.</p>

  <p>He was someone who wanted to accomplish great things. Right now, he hoped the Sacred race would bestow a Heavenly Destiny upon him so he could become a Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>Some Supreme Lords of the Sacred race might possibly perish in the war which meant the potential appearance of new Crowns of Destiny.</p>

  <p>Leacock knew he was qualified to inherit one Heavenly Destiny if that ever happened.</p>

  <p>As the green circles spread out, countless thin lines and dots appeared in the space.</p>

  <p>He was immediately able to find three flaws on Raleign's body? two lines and a dot to be exact. When he shifted his gaze to Luo Luo Zheng though, his face immediately froze.</p>

  <p>The thin lines represented one's flaws while the dots represented one's dead points.</p>

  <p>Leacock's understanding of the Truth Divine Dao might not be as good as Nathan's but he knew how to use it better.</p>

  <p>So it was with great shock and horror when he realized that he couldn't find any flaws on Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Does he have the Flawless Divine Body?" he murmured in disbelief.</p>
