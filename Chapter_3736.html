<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Under this circumstance, Dorothy was left no other choice.</p>

  <p>All she could do was to follow this tall and strong monster.</p>

  <p>They walked through more than ten thousand feet of passageway with rooms on either side filled with monsters with long hair.</p>

  <p>At every room she passed, the monsters would rattle the bars in their excitement and anger.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Dorothy felt deep inside her that she had a debt to pay them.</p>

  <p>Perhaps she owed them something in her previous life and now was the time to repay them for it...</p>

  <p>They walked ten thousand feet more when a faint voice came from a room on the left. It was the one who had given the order.</p>

  <p>Dorothy approached the cell and saw a long-haired monster whose hair had turned white. Its body was half the size of an ordinary long-haired monster, and it seemed weak and frail.</p>

  <p>But the white-haired monster appeared to be highly respected. At the very least, the others obeyed it.</p>

  <p>It observed Dorothy for a moment before asking, "Have you really forgotten everything?"</p>

  <p>Dorothy nodded and replied honestly, "I remember nothing but this door..."</p>

  <p>"Hoo..."</p>

  <p>The white-haired monster sighed. "That makes sense. If you remembered anything, you would have come here a long time ago. Coming here is your only way to get home."</p>

  <p>"Get home?" Dorothy's eyes widened. "Was I born here?"</p>

  <p>The white-haired monster shook its head and pointed not far ahead where there was a fork in the passageway.</p>

  <p>At the fork was a door on the left and a door on the right.</p>

  <p>"The door on the left is your way home," the white-haired monster said.</p>

  <p>Dorothy blinked in uneasiness, her heartbeat quickening, and she asked,</p>

  <p>"What about the door on the right?"</p>

  <p>"That door leads to Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore," the white-haired monster replied.</p>

  <p>Dorothy narrowed her eyes on hearing this.</p>

  <p>Upon learning her grandmother was in danger, she wanted little else other than to enter Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>But she knew this was impossible for her.</p>

  <p>She first had to become an Eternal Warrior and she might never even achieve that.</p>

  <p>All her hopes were now placed on that door.</p>

  <p>She did not expect there to actually be a path leading to Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>"If I want to step into Stage Thirty-three, I must become an Eternal Warrior and reach the Eternal Realm. Can I do that in my current state?" Dorothy asked.</p>

  <p>"Of course not." The white-haired monster laughed.</p>

  <p>"You do not want to go home, you want to go to Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore?" The long-haired monster asked, hovering behind Dorothy as she looked forward down the passageway.</p>

  <p>Dorothy was their race's only hope.</p>

  <p>Just now, the long-haired monster and the white-haired monster had discussed whether they should tell her the way home.</p>

  <p>If they told her, would she move on and leave them behind?</p>

  <p>Should they explain to her what had happened in that world?</p>

  <p>What if she insisted on doing as she pleased?</p>

  <p>They had prepared a detailed explanation, but it seemed that Dorothy was not interested in the way home at all!</p>

  <p>And so the long-haired monster couldn't help but ask her that question.</p>

  <p>"I have to go to Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore," Dorothy replied firmly.</p>

  <p>The long-haired monster and the white-haired monster looked at each other, their eyes twinkling with surprise.</p>

  <p>If she wanted to remove the curse, she would also have to go to Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>No matter what Dorothy's purpose was, at least she was headed in the same direction as them!</p>

  <p>"It is true that in your current state, you are unable to step into Stage Thirty-three, but I have a way to get you in," said the long-haired monster. "But you have to tell me your purpose of going there."</p>

  <p>"To save my grandmother!" Dorothy blurted out.</p>

  <p>The long-haired monster nodded. "We can help you with this matter, but we ask that you please keep your previous promise."</p>

  <p>"To help you remove the curse?" Dorothy inquired.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>Dorothy had already made up her mind as she walked down the passageway.</p>

  <p>Her current fate seemed to have been determined in her previous life. She had no other choice but to fulfill that promise.</p>

  <p>She would not refuse these monsters' requests.</p>

  <p>Now they revealed they could help her save her grandmother in Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore!</p>

  <p>If they really could help her, she would risk her life if she had to. She would obviously not hesitate to agree with them.</p>

  <p>In the Crane Blood Province</p>

  <p>The Star Crane City was the most prosperous city of the Bearing race.</p>

  <p>Three ancient towers were like pillars stretching out of the city to the sky.</p>

  <p>Each ancient tower had thousands of floors, and housed the core disciples of the Bearing race. The Ji Clan was located in the Supreme Memorial Tower, between the other two towers.</p>

  <p>Two hundred Other Shore Realm warriors had lined up on the capacious top floor of the Supreme Memorial Tower.</p>

  <p>The Ji Clan had posted a notice some time ago, announcing they planned to select some strong Other Shore Realm warriors to join the Yellow Emperor Guards.</p>

  <p>This was an excellent opportunity for the Other Shore Realm warriors scattered among the ordinary citizens to show their potential.</p>

  <p>Joining the Yellow Emperor Guards would mean obtaining better resources and even some powerful Other Shore Tokens!</p>

  <p>Naturally, since the notice had been posted, more and more warriors flooded this place with hopes of becoming a Yellow Emperor Guard.</p>

  <p>But now, their faces filled with confusion as they began muttering to themselves...</p>

  <p>They were unsure of the reason for their being sent here. This was the headquarters of the Ji Clan, a place that was difficult for even the most powerful warriors in the Crane Blood Province to enter.</p>

  <p>A huge gap existed between the Ji Clan and ordinary people.</p>

  <p>Why would the warriors who applied to be one of the Yellow Emperor Guards be sent here?</p>

  <p>"Enter!"</p>

  <p>The guards escorted the warriors into a palace.</p>

  <p>A moment ago, they had smelled the faint scent of the wood in the corridor, but that was replaced with a strong smell of blood after they entered the palace, so strong that some almost passed out.</p>

  <p>After they had entered, they saw a young man with black hair curl up in the corner of the palace.</p>

  <p>He was naked, covered in blood, and his eyes flashed with a fierce light.</p>

  <p>When the Other Shore Realm warriors saw him, they were instantly overtaken with a sense of foreboding.</p>

  <p>Some wished to retreat...</p>

  <p>Some wondered what was going on...</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the door closed behind them and the guards shouted, "If you kill that young man, you qualify to join the Yellow Emperor Guards!"</p>

  <p>"That young man doesn't appear to have even reached the Other Shore Realm!"</p>

  <p>"He is at most a consummate True God. He can't even possess the power of one divine megaton."</p>

  <p>"I will kill him!"</p>

  <p>It was obvious how big the gap between the Other Shore Realm warrior and the True God was.</p>

  <p>Such a large gap dispelled the fear in some hearts.</p>

  <p>Others still kept a cool and collected head, not getting ahead of themselves.</p>

  <p>If killing this man was easy, why were two hundred Other Shore Realm warriors sent here all at once?</p>

  <p>Those who recognized something was not quite as it seemed retreated to the corner, and some even looked for ways to escape...</p>

  <p>But with the means of the Ji Clan, how would the mere Other Shore Realm warriors be able to escape?</p>

  <p>The black-haired boy stood up and a sinister aura began filling every corner of the room. Then, like a wolf ravaging a flock of sheep, he pounced on the crowd!</p>

  <p>Streams of blood spurted and sprayed on every wall as the warriors were ruthlessly killed.</p>
