  <p>
</p>

  <p>A strong killing intent surfaced on Xi Youqin's elegant features.</p>

  <p>Purple River Sword Array?</p>

  <p>Her master had told her that the Purple Power World was an independent world and did not belong to the universe.</p>

  <p>It had once been the cultivation place of a True God and was a world that he had created himself. However, the rules of the heavens could not reach the place, so the Purple Power World could only be considered a broken plane. Things such as Roaring Tokens and the Illusion Space which contained the Law of Causality could not be passed on to the Purple Power World.</p>

  <p>The Purple Power World had inherited the general sword array, which was the Colorful Sword Array?</p>

  <p>The Colorful Sword Array was indeed powerful, and any girl with the Purple Power Body could cultivate it.</p>

  <p>However, other than the Colorful Sword Array, there were three more powerful sword arrays in the Purple Power World.</p>

  <p>One of them was the Purple River Sword Array, which could only be cultivated by women with a Purple Power Body at least at the third rank.</p>

  <p>Four thousand and two hundred warriors in the Purple Power World could cultivate this sword array.</p>

  <p>The second of the three powerful sword arrays was known as the Two Modes Sword Array, which women with a Purple Power Body at least at the second rank could cultivate. Over eighty women in the Purple Power World could perform the array.</p>

  <p>The last one was the Gods Killing Sword Array, which was the legacy of the True God who had created the Purple Power World. Until now, the only one qualified to inherit his sword array was none other than Mu Ning herself. That was to say, only Mu Ning was able to cultivate this sword array and she was the only one who had successfully mastered this sword array in the entirety of the Purple Power World.</p>

  <p>Ever since Mu Ning had entered the Illusion Battlefield, she had not used these three very powerful sword arrays.</p>

  <p>In the previous fights, she had only used the Colorful Sword Array as a defensive maneuver against the attacks of her opponents?</p>

  <p>Mu Ning was not a person who liked fighting. Ever since her childhood, she never liked swords or sabers or the like. Even though she came from a martial family, she was more interested in needlework and cooking.</p>

  <p>Just now, she had been completely flustered and put in a passive stance.</p>

  <p>However, while Ulysses had been forcing her back all the way, she became more aware that if defeated by him, she would probably be wiped out from the battlefield. Not only would her master be disappointed, but it was possible that she would not be able to accompany Luo Luo Zheng here?</p>

  <p>In truth, even if she lost in this battle, she would not be eliminated.</p>

  <p>However, Mu Ning was ignorant of this.</p>

  <p>When the purple river in the sky spread out, the many ace talents on the stones looked on, their eyes lighting up.</p>

  <p>"She's fighting back. That's what a fight should be like..." one of the ace talents said as he gazed at the purple river.</p>

  <p>Previously, Mu Ning had been trying to escape. Obviously, her heart was not fully in the battle, nor did she have a strong desire to win. The three hundred warriors were all of great backgrounds. With her low strength, they felt that she did not deserve to stand with them.</p>

  <p>However, what they did not know was that Mu Ning did not even wish to be alongside them.</p>

  <p>With the sudden activation of the Purple River Sword Array, seven swords flew into the river.</p>

  <p>A mysterious gesture from Mu Ning had the surging purple river coming down from the skies. As the purple river flowed downward, it transformed into a magnificent waterfall. However, what formed this waterfall was not water, but rather purple sword shadows.</p>

  <p>Under Xi Youqin's control, the purple sword shadows came to her. As her ten fingers flicked away, the purple sword shadows charged straight toward Ulysses.</p>

  <p>Ulysses had planned to end the battle as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>To him, it was meaningless to fight it out with such a weak human girl.</p>

  <p>Defeating her would not bring him honor in any way.</p>

  <p>However, when he saw the sudden appearance of the purple river, his pupils dilated as a sense of danger rose in his heart.</p>

  <p>He focused attentively on what he was about to face. Without hesitation, he swung the black pike in his hand. The two totems behind him suddenly flew out and hovered in the air.</p>

  <p>"In the name of my ancestors, reinforce my body!"</p>

  <p>Countless specks of light shot out from the two totems in the air.</p>

  <p>These specks of light were the souls of the many ancestors of the Saya race that had accumulated over generations.</p>

  <p>As the dots of light floated out, Ulysses' figure began to glow with a dazzling light. He still held the black pike in his hand. With the support of the ancestral power, the Mu Ning emitted from him began to change.</p>

  <p>In this moment, Ulysses was no longer alone. He was now fused with the ancestors of the Saya race.</p>

  <p>Both Ulysses' physical body and strength were enhanced to their limits.</p>

  <p>Right now, he was even capable of competing with the martial artists of the ogre race.</p>

  <p>"It is just a sword array. See how I break it!"</p>

  <p>Ulysses took a step forward. He did not dodge nor evade the attack, instead, he charged straight at the Purple River Sword Array.</p>

  <p>Waves began to surge in the river formed by the streams of purple sword shadows. They headed straight for Ulysses.</p>

  <p>Ulysses was like a reef within a river, but he was unafraid. The purple sword shadows, despite being sharp, instantly shattered upon colliding with him?</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Ulysses once again stepped forward.</p>

  <p>"The ancestral power of Ulysses can sense his ancestor, Drake!"</p>

  <p>"Before he entered the Illusion Battlefield, he was unable to do so. I never thought that after entering the Illusion Battlefield to hone his skills, he would make such a progress!"</p>

  <p>"The sword array of that human girl is indeed mysterious, but compared to Ulysses, she is far too inferior. Hah!"</p>

  <p>However, a strange expression appeared on Xi Youqin's face.</p>

  <p>'My master told me before that it is impossible for anyone to use brute force to break the Purple River Sword Array?</p>

  <p>The Purple River Sword Array is not a changeable one. Usually twenty-seven or eighty-one types of variations are common for a sword array.</p>

  <p>Some of them even have a thousand variations. However, there are only three variations in the Purple River Sword Array, and it's because of the lack of rich variations that there are almost no loopholes for it to be broken.</p>

  <p>But this man... he dared to charge ahead and try to break it up just like that...'</p>

  <p>Mu Ning pursed her lips. Thinking some more, she waved her finger.</p>

  <p>She decided to transform her sword array.</p>

  <p>The Purple River Sword Array had three variations.</p>

  <p>The first was the 'Array Charge', which could be used to attack opponents with purple sword shadows.</p>

  <p>This was the first movement of the sword array. The power of the Purple River Sword Array itself was strong, but the 'Array Charge' was not anything extraordinary.</p>

  <p>However, the moment the second transformation began, everyone could tell that it was meant to kill.</p>

  <p>"Spinning Trap!"</p>

  <p>Buzz, buzz, buzz ?</p>

  <p>The purple river, which had been rushing ahead, now changed directions.</p>

  <p>The purple strip formed into a vortex that spun non-stop around Ulysses.</p>

  <p>After Mu Ning transformed the array, he foresaw that something terrible would happen.</p>

  <p>With the support of ancestral power, his state of mind underwent a drastic change. Right now, he should be invincible. However, the purple river turned into a whirlpool, trapping him within it.</p>

  <p>"I refuse to believe that I can't break this sword array!"</p>

  <p>Ulysses roared out once again. The two totems floating in the air rotated faster and faster, and the radiance on his body grew brighter.</p>

  <p>However, after being trapped in the purple river, he discovered that the sword array could be as firm as a rock, or as soft as jelly. He had no way of breaking free at all. Annoyed, he cursed himself for being so easily trapped by Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing this, many of the other ace talents stared at Mu Ning and her sword array, their eyes full of dread.</p>

  <p>In their eyes, although Ulysses of the Saya race was an ace talent, he was not a very powerful one?</p>

  <p>Still, this girl, Mu Ning, had easily trapped him within her sword array.</p>

  <p>The power of the sword array itself was extraordinary.</p>

  <p>"Now... You can be the one to admit defeat," Mu Ning said to Ulysses in a low voice as she stepped out of the sword array.</p>

  <p>Defeating the person in front of her had not been too difficult a task, but there was no happiness on her face, as this victory was completely meaningless to her.</p>

  <p>"I haven't lost yet!"</p>

  <p>Ulysses could not accept this result.</p>

  <p>Because the warriors of the Saya race worshipped and believed in their ancestors, they attached great importance to honor.</p>

  <p>After all, in their hearts, their ancestors were always by their side.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning blinked, her fingers enacting a profound sword tactic. Her face was marred with exasperation. "Then I will change the sword array again..."</p>

  <p>The third transformation of the Purple River Sword Array began and a cold killing intent burst out from the center of the purple river.</p>

  <p>The seven swords suddenly reappeared and transformed into a gigantic sword shadow, chopping down at Ulysses' head?</p>
