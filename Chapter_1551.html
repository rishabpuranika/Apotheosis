<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1551 Competing Against Luo Luo Zheng </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>At the macro level, measuring a warrior's strength was to measure his momentum and might.</p>

  <p>But at the micro level, a warrior's true strength was measured by their ability to control their power and movement speed. This ability could be regarded as the absolute control of strength.</p>

  <p>As a sort of test, some warriors placed birds in their hands. When the birds were about to fly away, the warriors would move their hands slightly, making the birds unable to move their feet, causing them to fall back into the palms. Such was a sign that warriors had mastered the skill of absolute control.</p>

  <p>But such a method wasn't flawless. Even the early-stage warriors, still going through body refinement, would be able to grasp what was known as the "skill of stopping birds".</p>

  <p>Some warriors who were more skilled could even place the bird on their heads, shoulders, and chest. Even in these positions, the warrior could stop the bird from flying away.</p>

  <p>Some could even stop not only birds, but also flies and mosquitoes.</p>

  <p>As mosquitoes were much smaller, the warriors had to be able to sense and withdraw the force that supported them the moment they flew away.</p>

  <p>This test was more difficult than stopping a bird.</p>

  <p>But compared to what Luo Luo Zheng was currently doing, stopping a mosquito was a mere side trick.</p>

  <p>When Lucille was looking down on Luo Luo Zheng from high up in the sky, watching his strikes and skill in movement during his performance in the sword rain, she already noticed how remarkable he was.</p>

  <p>As she tried stabbing him with her sword, she suddenly realized the mysteries within it. Luo Luo Zheng maintained a distance of three inches from each of the descending golden swords, circling the sword that she thrust out.</p>

  <p>This was a display of his absolute control of strength and movement speed.</p>

  <p>Never had Lucille seen control to such an extent.</p>

  <p>How did Luo Luo Zheng do it?</p>

  <p>After witnessing his strange movement skill, Lucille decided to take Luo Luo Zheng on as an opponent qualified to face her.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Not giving Lucille a chance to consider anything else, he flew backward and swung the Thunder Wind Divine Sword directly toward her.</p>

  <p>Facing his sword strike, Lucille didn't dodge.</p>

  <p>Given the situation, all of her attention was focused on his movement skill, but she wanted to find out what method he used to control his distance so exactly.</p>

  <p>When the blue sword light struck down, Lucille raised her right hand and grabbed onto his sword.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Lucille's right hand was adorned with the Five-element Finger Chain, connecting with her five fingers, forming a layer of protection.</p>

  <p>As she stretched out her hand, she made use of the chain to grip the sword firmly in her hand.</p>

  <p>While fighting warriors at the same cultivation level, Luo Luo Zheng had always been the only one to grab hold of others' swords? perhaps, Lucile was the first one to hold his.</p>

  <p>The moment she gripped his sword, the rings on her five fingers began glowing with a strange light, very similar to the color of the Magnetic Sacred Mountain. It was the power formed from the fusion of the five Original Laws' powers.</p>

  <p>But Lucille's cultivation base wasn't high enough? the power she fused was inferior to that of the Magnetic Sacred Mountain.</p>

  <p>Even so, the use of the five elements was already extremely powerful.</p>

  <p>With that, Lucille believed that it was impossible for Luo Luo Zheng to escape after grasping his sword.</p>

  <p>But in the next moment, her eyes suddenly lit up in surprise.</p>

  <p>As she gripped the blade, she could feel the power on the sword increase explosively. Was that power from Luo Luo Zheng? The sharp increase in power took her aback.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the dragon scales were being lit up one after another.</p>

  <p>Great power quickly rushed into the Thunder Wind Divine Sword.</p>

  <p>Initially, she had relied on the power of the five elements in her finger chain to gain the upper hand. She was about to say that Luo Luo Zheng was outstanding enough to force her to employ the power of all five elements.</p>

  <p>After all, it wasn't ideal for her to display her full power at that moment? she only intended to make use of it when she fought other ace talents in the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>But the power that spread out from the Thunder Wind Divine Sword astonished Lucille, forcing back the words she had for Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The Thunder Wind Divine Sword was only four inches wide and four feet long, but the power within it had the weight of a star.</p>

  <p>Under the suppression of this power, Lucille began sinking inch by inch.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng gripped his sword tightly and unmovingly, looking down at her indifferently.</p>

  <p>When facing warriors of the same rank, Lucille was always the one to look down on the others. Now that she had to look up at Luo Luo Zheng, her originally cold expression finally turned stubborn.</p>

  <p>Because there were too few with the ability to stand a chance against her, she didn't seem too keen on competing with anyone.</p>

  <p>Being an ace talent of the Ji Clan, she was extraordinary, holding such a high status? not anyone could just compete with her.</p>

  <p>As she was unwilling to risk being at a disadvantage, the sea of life vitality within her inner world began rolling crazily. A massive tsunami of life vitality rolled out in her Soul Sea with an irresistible force.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, a massive whirlpool appeared.</p>

  <p>There seemed to be no limit to the speed at which the life vitality could be extracted.</p>

  <p>So when warriors used some powerful moves that excessively consumed life vitality, it would take quite a long time to prepare.</p>

  <p>But Lucille's inner world was a bit different? her Soul Sea was extremely special, with the ability to suck out all the life vitality in a short period of time.</p>

  <p>This sort of Soul Sea was called the Night Tide Sea? out of the trillions of Soul Sea Realm warriors, she was the only one with such.</p>

  <p>The seawater formed by the life vitality within Lucille's inner world turned into a massive whirlpool as it was pulled out from her body. She then poured the life vitality into her Five-element Finger Chain, triggering the five rings to shine brilliantly as she kept a tight grip on Luo Zheng's long sword.</p>

  <p>They were competing in strength, but Lucille wouldn't let herself fall inferior to any man.</p>

  <p>Under the influence of the five elements' power, Lucille gradually gained the upper hand. Her body rose higher and higher, reaching an altitude beyond where Luo Luo Zheng was.</p>

  <p>But she managed to keep that up for barely three seconds.</p>

  <p>Her pupils widened in surprise as she felt the power from the sword? it increased unexpectedly by leaps and bounds.</p>

  <p>What was the limit of Luo Zheng's power? How could he still increase it by so much?</p>

  <p>Previously, Luo Luo Zheng had only pushed forth with the power of six thousand dragon scales.</p>

  <p>When he felt the boundless power of the five elements, he activated the power of another six thousand dragon scales, meaning he had instantly doubled his power to twelve thousand dragon scales.</p>

  <p>Lucille had no idea he could do such a thing.</p>

  <p>In the past few years, Luo Luo Zheng had once again smelted the sacred and divine weapons that he hadn't been using in order to obtain a lot of heavenly essence.</p>

  <p>Currently, Luo Luo Zheng had already ignited the power of forty thousand dragon scales.</p>

  <p>But he didn't have that much heavenly essence? during his experiment, he found that his divine weapon body could easily withstand the power of forty thousand dragon scales.</p>

  <p>The only problem was the lack of heavenly essence.</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng ascended to the Upper World, he had no time to rest during his journey. Naturally, he didn't have the time to buy any fairy or sacred weapons, so he thought it was quite a shame.</p>

  <p>Once, Luo Luo Zheng had every intention of asking Livingston to forge some weapons for him to melt.</p>

  <p>But Livingston was completely immersed in refining weapons and wholeheartedly tried to turn the sword embryo into a real one. In the past few years, he barely left the weapon refining workshop.</p>

  <p>Facing Luo Luo Zheng who had doubled his power, Lucille fell once again.</p>

  <p>This time, it became clear to her how stupid it was to fight against Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>And she had another issue? the life vitality in her body had already been completely used up. As the life vitality in her inner world was just sucked out, over 99% of her life vitality sea had already been depleted.</p>

  <p>"It should be over, right?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled faintly as the sword intent suddenly appeared in the Thunder Wind Divine Sword. The sword intent moved along the blade and flew straight at Lucille in an instant.</p>

  <p>If she was hit by it, she would have already been beheaded and would've had to return to the main city for revival.</p>

  <p>It wasn't that Luo Luo Zheng was merciless, but in order to get the Illusion Points, he had no other choice but to kill her.</p>

  <p>"Hmph!"</p>

  <p>Lucille only snorted coldly. Before Luo Zheng's sword intent could reach her, a golden wind swept over and Lucille's figure disappeared once again.</p>

  <p>Not even Luo Luo Zheng could match her speed.</p>

  <p>Keeping her balance, Lucille lightly patted her wrist and pulled out dozens of life vitality jades. The moment she brought them out, she crushed them in her hands, releasing the life vitality, turning it into white fog. Quickly, she absorbed it all and replenished the life vitality within her body.</p>

  <p>Relying on only her speed, she already made herself invincible as she faced Luo Luo Zheng just then. But in the contest of pure strength, Luo Luo Zheng clearly had the upper hand.</p>
