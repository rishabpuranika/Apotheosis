<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 374 Breaking Your Enchanted Barrier (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Eh?</p>

  <p>Why another Drizzle Peak disciple? I seem to be destined to take on the whole of Drizzle Peak today." At the sight of Luo Luo Zheng, Mack faked an innocent smile. Beneath the harmless expression lay his brutal, unconcealable nature.</p>

  <p>"Yeah, it's sort of destined," Luo Luo Zheng responded coolly. Although the disciple did not show much emotion when he witnessed Yehudi being tormented by Mack, in truth, a strong impulse took hold of him? to rush to the center of the arena and smash Mack to pieces. Still, this was the All Peaks Competition. With several saints, elders, and even head of the sect present, Luo Luo Zheng couldn't dare to charge and attack Mack as he wanted to, no matter how confident he was about his explosive force.</p>

  <p>Licking his lips maliciously, Mack asked, "That guy named Yehudi? he's the best in Drizzle Peak, isn't he?</p>

  <p>Did you see how he ended up? If you're scared, don't worry, you can admit your defeat right now!"</p>

  <p>As he taunted Luo Luo Zheng, Mack pointed at the referee to the side of the battle ground with an genuine smile on his face.</p>

  <p>No one could deny that Mack seemed like a sanguine boy. His tanned skin and strong build made him look very healthy and full of vitality.</p>

  <p>However, his style of fighting entirely contrasted his image.</p>

  <p>"Admit my defeat?" With a drastic arch of his brows, Luo Luo Zheng strolled up to Mack, cracking his knuckles. "I sure want to see what on earth you can do to make me admit my defeat."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's body was nearly as hard and strong as a medium-grade spiritual weapon, so the periosteum in his knuckles was also peerlessly firm and tenacious? a loud crack could be heard from every flex of his knuckle.</p>

  <p>Snap!</p>

  <p>Snap!</p>

  <p>Snap!</p>

  <p>The cracks reverberated across the arena like thunderclaps.</p>

  <p>Although the other eight pairs already started battling and their weapons crashed and clattered against each other, still, their crashing sounds, shouts, and barks were all drowned out by the cracking of Luo Zheng's knuckles.</p>

  <p>Many disciples darted curious looks at Luo Luo Zheng, hardly able to imagine that a man could cause such loud, thundering sounds as he flexed his knuckles.</p>

  <p>"That's nothing impressive! For a man who focuses on refining his body, the highest level he can reach is the marrow refining realm. Even if your corporeal body is strong, how much stronger can you possibly get? Ha!"</p>

  <p>As Mack's smile disappeared, a flag appeared in his hand which he then tossed onto the ground before rapidly drawing back.</p>

  <p>Technically, Mack's combat ability was not outstanding compared to all the others who had reached the nature level consummation. If he took on Luo Luo Zheng purely with force, he was bound to lose.</p>

  <p>Still, Mack held Luo Luo Zheng in contempt because ultimately, the most pivotal factor the combatants of the Eastern Region counted on was life vitality.</p>

  <p>When a man reached higher realms, he could strengthen his body to the extreme by solely exercising his life vitality. This would give him the power to destroy an entire land with a single blow. With that kind of power in mind, the combatants of the Eastern Region chose to refine their bodies only because they were getting their bodies prepared for the entry to the nature level.</p>

  <p>Once they entered the level and acquired the power to control life vitality, no one would want to spend their time and energy refining their bodies, would they?</p>

  <p>Given that, Mack was rather dismissive about body refinement. In fact, most of the martial arts practitioners in the Eastern Region had the same thought.</p>

  <p>After shooting a look at the flag on the ground, Luo Luo Zheng felt the corners of his mouth twitch. He then stomped his feet hard and abruptly darted towards Mack. Taking Yehudi's failure as a lesson, Luo Luo Zheng definitely wouldn't let Mack set up his magic array so easily.</p>

  <p>"Barging Fist!"</p>

  <p>In the group stage, Luo Luo Zheng had no intent to utilize his Heavenly Ogre First, so he accordingly adopted the most ordinary fist skill.</p>

  <p>Although the Barging Fist was of the common kinds, when paired with Luo Zheng's horrifying force and speed, it was rather menacing.</p>

  <p>When Mack saw Luo Luo Zheng hurtle directly at him like a whirl of wind, a hint of terror flitted across his face but he recovered quickly. After all, the biggest threat to a magic array was not a powerful opponent. No matter how strong the enemy was, Mack could always find a way to win the fight as long as he manipulated the array properly.</p>

  <p>What a magic array master feared the most was the lack of an opportunity to set up an array during a fight. Without it, he would be like a swordsman without a sword or a saberman without a saber. At that point, Mack was totally at his wit's end.</p>

  <p>When he detected Luo Zheng's speed, his life vitality began surging in his hands. The man stuck out a finger and gently pointed at the flag on the ground as he exclaimed, "Grow!"</p>

  <p>A bright light flew over the flag. Against the strong wind, it instantly grew into a huge flag and positioned itself in front of Mack to shield him.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng didn't give a damn about the flag. He simply sidestepped and dashed straight into Mack. Much to Luo Zheng's surprise, though, the flag swooshed in front of his eyes the moment he swept past the flag and now he was left in a circle once again.</p>

  <p>"Huh?</p>

  <p>There's something funny about this flag?"</p>

  <p>Clearly heading forward, Luo Luo Zheng could see that the flag billowed, guiding him to walk around it. If he hadn't experienced kinds of magic himself, he would have thought the flag to be quite eerie.</p>

  <p>"So this is also a kind of magic array? I'll just destroy your flag and see what else you've got? Do you want that?" At this track, Luo Luo Zheng stopped and immediately punched a fist into the flag of magic array.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Under the immense impact of Luo Zheng's punch, jets of emerald green emerged below the flag? there was an enchanted barrier attached to the flag, keeping it protected.</p>

  <p>"By the way, this magic array flag of mine is a top-grade spiritual weapon, called Star-shifting Flag. How could you possibly damage it?"</p>

  <p>Mack yelled smugly.</p>

  <p>Now, he had bought himself plenty of time to lay out a large-sized magic array to handle Luo Luo Zheng. His smirk was replaced with a languid expression as he took out another flag in no hurry, ready to build a new magic array.</p>

  <p>"You said I can't damage it?"</p>

  <p>With a sneer, Luo Luo Zheng landed a ruthless blow on the Star-shifting Flag.</p>

  <p>Wham!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's left hand slammed hard into the flag. Apart from the pure force, he added a bit of energy from the Emerald Crystal in it.</p>

  <p>The enchanted barrier of such little magnitude was nothing to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Compared to the enchanted barrier of Yolande, this one was a far cry from it.</p>

  <p>With that in mind, Luo Luo Zheng believed that only a tiny amount of the Emerald Crystal energy would be enough.</p>

  <p>In almost no time, red cracks began sprawling across the flag and its enchanted barrier collapsed in an instant.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>Across the arena, Mack still had several flags in his hands that had not yet been arranged in the proper positions. At the astonishing scene, Mack's eyes went so wide as if they could fall out of his eye sockets at any moment.</p>
