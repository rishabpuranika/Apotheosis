<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3009 Disciples' Gains </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Truth Competition was a must-have activity in the cultivation palaces.</p>

  <p>These sword-shaped patterns reflected the level of the disciples' comprehension of the Truth of Godly Way. When disciples at the same level battled against each other in the Truth Competition, their desire to win would be aroused, and they would gain more insight about the Truth of Godly Way in the process.</p>

  <p>In fact, it was common for disciples to make a breakthrough during the Truth Competition.</p>

  <p>For example, Elgin and Beldene had been participating in the Truth Competition from the very beginning, and both of them had been trying their best to win. In just a short period of time, they had already surpassed a large number of disciples who had started cultivating at the same time as them, and become the most outstanding star disciples in the Sword Light Palace.</p>

  <p>However, the disciples whose sword-shaped patterns were gathering around Zheng's were quite hostile to him.</p>

  <p>In particular, the disciples of the top two cultivation palaces, the Demon Sword Palace and the Burial Sword Palace, intended to uphold their reputation.</p>

  <p>They wouldn't be nearly as hostile toward Zheng if he was from another cultivation palace. However, he was a disciple of the Sword Dance Palace, which was regarded by all the other disciples as nothing but a trash heap.</p>

  <p>Besides, Zheng was not from the Qiu Clan or the Yuebai Clan. The fact that he was allowed to participate in the Truth Competition was like an insult to all of them.</p>

  <p>"Overtake him and step on him!"</p>

  <p>"Force him to slow down!"</p>

  <p>"If he continues to move up, I will stop and defeat him!"</p>

  <p>These several people had also comprehended more than 3, 000 words of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent. Their sword-shaped patterns were similar to Zheng's, and some of them were even a little stronger.</p>

  <p>As the sword-shaped patterns gathered together, the aura around the Lofty Sword became several times denser.</p>

  <p>Bang! Clank! Clank! Clank!</p>

  <p>When the sword-shaped patterns of the other disciples clashed against Zheng's, crisp metallic sounds resounded in the area as if their weapons were physically colliding with each other. Wisps of truth aura passed through the cyan thread into Zheng's soul.</p>

  <p>Ordinary disciples would have a tough time standing their ground if they were attacked by many people at the same time. They would feel a sharp pain in their heads and would have to stop.</p>

  <p>Zheng, however, only slowed down a bit in the face of these attacks. He held a translation in one hand, and his voice became more and more sonorous.</p>

  <p>His sword-shaped pattern exuded a pure truth aura, sending the other sword-shaped patterns flying backward as soon as they came into contact with it.</p>

  <p>As the sword-shaped patterns scattered into the air, Zheng's truth aura was transmitted to the minds of the several disciples through the cyan threads.</p>

  <p>Following that, a few screams came from the platforms where the disciples of the Burial Sword Palace and the Demon Sword Palace were.</p>

  <p>Those disciples squatted down and covered their heads with their hands, their faces contorting in pain.</p>

  <p>"This guy..."</p>

  <p>"He is almost unhurt!"</p>

  <p>"Is it really the first time he's cultivating the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent?"</p>

  <p>"That's for sure. The Lofty Sword is never wrong."</p>

  <p>The sword-shaped patterns on the Lofty Sword reflected how much the cultivators had comprehended the Truth of Godly Way. Now it seemed that Zheng's sword-shaped pattern had grown really fast.</p>

  <p>"Well, let's attack him too!"</p>

  <p>"If this guy really has a thorough comprehension of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, then it will also benefit us greatly!"</p>

  <p>"We might be tortured for a while, but maybe it will help us break through the bottleneck!"</p>

  <p>Seeing this scene, the disciples who had comprehended over 3, 000 words were now eager to challenge Zheng as well.</p>

  <p>The reason why the Sword Light Palace encouraged disciples to take part in the Truth Competition was that they could absorb the truth aura from their opponents in the process. In turn, the comprehension of their opponents would also be imprinted in their minds. This way, they could make a faster breakthrough during the competition.</p>

  <p>The fiercer the opponent's attack was, the better the effect would be.</p>

  <p>Most disciples from the cultivation palaces would be able to comprehend about 3, 000 words, but after that, they would be stuck at that stage for a long time. In general, it was very difficult to break through the bottleneck of the Truth of Godly Way by using external force.</p>

  <p>At this time, they all changed their opinions about Zheng. Their notions of suppressing Zheng completely disappeared, and instead, they took him as a great tonic. With a fanatic desire, they rushed to him.</p>

  <p>As Zheng read the translation, he glanced around and, to his shock, caught a glimpse of a group of sword-shaped patterns coming straight toward him all of a sudden.</p>

  <p>Were these guys crazy?</p>

  <p>Anyway, he had no choice but to react.</p>

  <p>What he had to do was to comprehend the Truth of Godly Way at such a fast speed that his sword-shaped pattern would rise and leave the area where 3, 000 words indicated. However, he was already reading at almost the maximum speed. How could he dodge the sword-shaped patterns coming toward him?</p>

  <p>Cling! Cling! Cling...</p>

  <p>Over ten sword-shaped patterns surged toward Zheng one after another. Each time, there was the crisp sound of swords colliding with each other, followed by the scream of a disciple.</p>

  <p>A strange spectacle suddenly appeared on the platforms of the twelve cultivation palaces.</p>

  <p>The disciples on the platforms were shrieking in pain while covering their heads with their hands, and some of them passed out from the pain. Two of them even lost their balance and plummeted toward the abyss.</p>

  <p>Of course, the palace leaders wouldn't really let their disciples fall into the abyss...</p>

  <p>The officiant of the Sword Light Palace watched this scene in utter awe.</p>

  <p>"This disciple called Zheng seems to have a natural affinity with the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent..." he remarked breathlessly.</p>

  <p>"It's not just the affinity. His soul is also very powerful... After all, he has been in the Sea of Truth..." Laura pointed out with a hint of appreciation in her voice.</p>

  <p>For anyone else, it would have been almost impossible to avoid so many attacks at the same time. However, since Zheng had been in the Sea of Truth, he could resist their attacks with his own soul.</p>

  <p>Ingram nodded in agreement, but added, "Although his soul is powerful, he still won't be able to easily withstand attacks with just his soul."</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished his words, a voice full of surprise came from the platform of the Burial Sword Palace. "Haha. I got it..."</p>

  <p>The man who had spoken was Wade Yuebai. He was the first disciple of the cultivation palace to challenge Zheng.</p>

  <p>Just now, when his sword-shaped pattern had hit Zheng's, the truth aura had shot into his mind and produced a sharp pain, as if it was ripping his soul apart. However, when the pain finally faded away, he realized that he had been enlightened.</p>

  <p>After he had comprehended 3, 100 words, his progress had been at a standstill for two whole years. After attacking Zheng, however, he had been able to make a breakthrough easily. It was no wonder he was so excited. He almost couldn't wait to sit down cross-legged and silently read the translation. At this moment, his sword-shaped pattern on the Lofty Sword really started to grow.</p>

  <p>And he wasn't the only disciple that this had happened to. Two other disciples had also gone through the same experience. With an incomparable excitement, they began to verify the comprehension in their minds.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>The leaders of the cultivation palaces were shocked by the peculiar behavior of these three disciples.</p>

  <p>In order to make it possible for their disciples to enter the Sea of Truth, the palace leaders had done everything they could to cultivate them. However, no matter how much effort they put into it and how many methods they used, they hadn't been able to achieve their goal. Now, to their surprise, it seemed that these disciples had broken through the bottleneck just by competing against Zheng during the Truth Competition.</p>

  <p>"Maybe it's just a coincidence that these three disciples were able to make it..." Dalton, the leader of the Burial Sword Palace, said in a low voice.</p>
