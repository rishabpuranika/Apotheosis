<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Every consummate True God usually cultivated a Godly Way to its max.</p>

  <p>So they had the ability to control the Godly Ways in whatever way they pleased.</p>

  <p>With a large number of consummate True Gods coming together, even a Holy Being could not deal with them!</p>

  <p>But when it came to monsters, they needed their combined power to destroy them. If it was the Spiritual Mountain Monster— the sixth-grade fierce beast in the Everest Spirit Mountain, or the Vicious Ghost— the sixth-grade fierce beast in the Soul Wilderness, they did not need to work together to attack it.</p>

  <p>However, the Time Elk's theurgy was related to time, so it was really difficult to kill it.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>An ice spear was released by a consummate True God. It went straight for the Time Elk.</p>

  <p>"Snow Divine Spear?"</p>

  <p>Zheng looked up at the icy spear with a confused expression.</p>

  <p>He had suffered a lot because of the Snow Divine Spear in the Arena of Legends. The one who had shot the Snow Divine Spear was Moore, the fat man from the Moon Clan.</p>

  <p>It was no different today. The consummate True God who used the Snow Divine Spear was also from the Moon Clan.</p>

  <p>"This Snow Divine Spear is as powerful as that of Moore." Astonishment was written all over Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>The True God released a second Snow Divine Spear, then a third one, followed by a fourth one...</p>

  <p>Each spear was just as lethal as Moore's Snow Divine Spear.</p>

  <p>The consummate True God was a formidable foe. And he was, of course, far more powerful than an ordinary low-rank True God.</p>

  <p>What happened next jolted Zheng out of his musing.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, more and more Snow Divine Spears were released by the consummate True God. The power of the fifth Snow Divine Spear was far greater than the fourth one. Subsequently the sixth Snow Divine Spear, and the seventh one were even more powerful... By the time the thirteenth Snow Divine Spear was released by the consummate True God, the power contained within it had grown manifold!</p>

  <p>Even if one wasn't stabbed by the deadly spear, just a light touch was enough to smash them to pieces.</p>

  <p>This was the power of the consummate True God! Zheng was shell-shocked.</p>

  <p>The other True Gods were just as fearsome.</p>

  <p>The flowing internal momentum in the sky transformed into a variety of attacks aimed at the Time Elk in the distance!</p>

  <p>"I can absorb all of this internal momentum!"</p>

  <p>Zheng was quite excited at the prospect.</p>

  <p>Perhaps no one would notice him in the chaos.</p>

  <p>It was possible that some Holy Beings outside the Time Sea Forbidden Land would notice his actions, but he had already exposed almost all of his skills as he was in great danger now. It was meaningless to hide anything anymore.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>His eyes quietly lit up and a golden circle of light was visible in them.</p>

  <p>He started to absorb the internal momentum in the valley!</p>

  <p>No matter how complicated the internal momentum was, he could understand it with the help of Infinity Ruler. He lit up a scale on the Infinity Ruler, and then a streak of light shot out from it and zoomed into a cube on his Godly Tile. It turned into a light beam containing the internal momentum, surging at a certain point in his inner world.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng understood these Godly Ways, it didn't mean that he could openly display them.</p>

  <p>These theurgies employed by the consummate True Gods were almost at the sixth or even consummate level. If he did not become a top-rank True God, Zheng couldn't practice any of these theurgies.</p>

  <p>However, there were no requirements for high cultivation base for the theurgy beyond way. For example, Zheng could easily perform the Snow Divine Spear, the theurgy beyond the Snow Godly Way. Its cultivating way was similar to that of the Ice Soul Flame that Zheng cultivated before, because the Ice Soul Flame was also a theurgy beyond way.</p>

  <p>However, he could only create four or five Snow Divine Spears at the most just like Moore had done. It was impossible for him to release thirteen Snow Divine Spears in an instant!</p>

  <p>Zheng was concentrating on reading the internal momentum when he heard Reginald shout, "Everyone, be careful!"</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>A huge fire dragon had been summoned by a consummate True God and it had struck the Time Elk. The flames swept over.</p>

  <p>The consummate True Gods were naturally not afraid of the aftermath of the flames, but could some of the other True Gods withstand this raging fire?</p>

  <p>"Promise of Absolute Beginning!"</p>

  <p>Seeing the fierce flames rushing towards them, some of the True Gods realized that they wouldn't be able to resist it. So they gritted their teeth and activated a Promise of Absolute Beginning. The outer layer of their bodies suddenly shone with a layer of golden light. This golden light was like a protective covering, which would shield them from the energy formed by the internal momentum.</p>

  <p>"Who has a defense weapon?"</p>

  <p>"The Promise of Absolute Beginning is too precious to be used like this!"</p>

  <p>"We could lose our lives. Do you really think it's a waste to use it at this moment?"</p>

  <p>Many of the True Gods were watching.</p>

  <p>The flames surging towards them were powerful, but it was indeed a waste to use the Promise of Absolute Beginning to resist them.</p>

  <p>The True Gods present were the core members of the rich clans on the Floating Islands. Surely, someone would have some powerful body protection weapons or armors.</p>

  <p>"I have a body protection bell."</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The True God activated his weapon, and a large golden bell appeared and immediately enveloped him. However, this big bell could only protect him and not the others.</p>

  <p>The other True Gods would have to think of their own ways of protecting themselves.</p>

  <p>"Tianxing, come here!"</p>

  <p>Kelsey yelled at Zheng. She had a small ring in her hand. It appeared to be an extraordinary defensive treasure.</p>

  <p>"He might not need it," Liusu said with a mysterious smile.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded to Kelsey. The flames were fatal, but they were unable to destroy his body.</p>

  <p>Then Kelsey turned to the golden ring and cried, "Grow, grow!" The ring began expanding and soon enveloped the three women of the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>"Wow!"</p>

  <p>Soon, the flames engulfed the entire valley.</p>

  <p>The True Gods resisted the attacks using their body protection weapons.</p>

  <p>Some of them had no other way to defend themselves and could only activate a Promise of Absolute Beginning. Zheng was the only one who was able to absorb the flames with the golden light emanating from his entire body.</p>

  <p>Holy Drew helped Zheng refine his body in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, and raise his physical body to a new level. His body became more selective of the flames. However, Holy Drew didn't give any clue as to whether his body could still be strengthened.</p>

  <p>"What's with the golden Sanskrit words on this guy's body?"</p>

  <p>"Oh wow! He's absorbing Isaac's Demon-burning Flame!"</p>

  <p>"He's not even afraid of the flames released from the consummate True God! What a guy!"</p>

  <p>Although the fire was not as fierce as it was in the beginning, it could not be ignored completely.</p>

  <p>Some of the True Gods' body protection weapons were also burned to ashes. They had no choice but to use the Promise of Absolute Beginning to resist the flames.</p>

  <p>Everyone was so confounded when they saw Zheng standing in the midst of the flames.</p>

  <p>After several tense moments, the flames finally dissipated.</p>

  <p>Zheng's body returned to its normal state as well. He raised his arm and observed it. Absorbing the Demon-burning Flame did not benefit his body in any way.</p>

  <p>All of the True Gods looked at the eastern part of the valley.</p>

  <p>Everyone had the same thought in the minds: there was no way that the Time Elk would have survived such a fierce attack.</p>

  <p>"Is it dead?" asked a True God, who was staring intently at it.</p>

  <p>Zheng's gaze was also focused on the Time Elk, which was sprawled out on the ground motionless.</p>

  <p>Its body was covered in darkness, and the wide wings on its back were also riddled with holes. It didn't look like a savage beast anymore, and seemed to be dead.</p>

  <p>The consummate True Gods warily moved towards the Time Elk.</p>

  <p>But just as they approached the creature, the indestructible beast suddenly opened its eyes scaring the living daylights out of everyone present.</p>

  <p>Its colorful eyes exuded a new level of ferocity.</p>

  <p>The light flew along every piece of its flesh, muscle and blood vessels, soon converting into numerous sharp thorns and shooting out in all directions!</p>

  <p>Swish, swish, swish!</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the Time Elk had transformed into a giant hedgehog.</p>

  <p>And each colorful thorn was formed by the power of time.</p>

  <p>This phenomenon had occurred all of a sudden!</p>

  <p>Rachelle was the first one to react. Almost in an instant, she used the spatial transference. Just as her figure disappeared, the sharp thorns had pierced into her chest!</p>

  <p>The next moment, she appeared in another place of the valley. A fist-sized hole had formed in her chest and blood was gurgling out of it.</p>

  <p>The other consummate True Gods also reacted swiftly. Most of them were injured, save for a few, who managed to escape quickly.</p>

  <p>The consummate True Gods of the Zhao Clan and the Qin Clan were killed. Their heads were pierced by the sharp thorns. The formidable power of time destroyed their souls and their bodies were also pierced through. They died on the spot.</p>

  <p>The mighty Time Elk staggered to its feet.</p>

  <p>It seemed to be unable to use the Time Backing, so it let out a desperate roar.</p>

  <p>All the spikes flew back to its body, and at the same time, a colorful halo spread out from its feet.</p>

  <p>The Time Elk was sucked into the halo immediately.</p>

  <p>Everyone was still frozen in fear, but they saw a small jade seal appearing in the center of the halo.</p>
