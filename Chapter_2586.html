</p>

  <p>When the elders of the Yellow Emperor race heard Adele's voice, they were all stunned.</p>

  <p>As specified in the agreement, each race had sent five members to participate in the battle.</p>

  <p>Since four of the five Nine Li warriors had been defeated, the Yellow Emperor race didn't take the remaining warrior of the Nine Li race seriously.</p>

  <p>After all, even Elsa, the most powerful Nine Li warrior they knew, had been defeated by them. So, they had simply ignored their fifth opponent.</p>

  <p>"I apologize for my negligence," said Lancelot. As long as the Nine Li race was willing to fulfill the agreement, there was nothing for him to worry about. "In that case, Lisa, fight again," he announced, his expression relaxed.</p>

  <p>"As I have already told you, there're many losers among the Nine Li race, many more than those five. Even if fifty of them banded together, they would still be at a disadvantage. Honestly, I don't know what they are thinking, getting involved in this. With each battle they fight, they just bring more disgrace on themselves," said David, speaking slowly.</p>

  <p>The members of the Yellow Emperor race responded with nothing but a chilling silence.</p>

  <p>Her expression unchanging, Lisa slowly stepped out of the crowd again, the black sword in her hand. Without further ado, she transformed herself into a towering giant, a Wild God, and stood still, waiting for her foe.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, we are counting on you now!" said Romeo, who was sitting on the ground, tending to his wounds.</p>

  <p>Adele, Giacomo and the other elders also looked at Luo Zheng expectantly.</p>

  <p>They didn't yet know how much potential Luo Zheng had.</p>

  <p>Yet, as Romeo said, Luo Zheng had already successfully killed mid-rank Wild Gods in the Immemorial Wilderness.</p>

  <p>And that was before Luo Zheng had undergone the Body Tribulations. Now he had the Nine Li Wild Body, his strength would have grown to an unimaginable degree. It would be unwise to underestimate him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded, gently stroking the emerald green long sword in his hand as he walked towards the center of the deserted land at a slow but determined pace.</p>

  <p>"Grow," he muttered to himself as he walked. As soon as the word left his lips, he began to grow rapidly.</p>

  <p>In what seemed like no time at all, his body had reached a height of more than ten thousand feet.</p>

  <p>However, focused on the transformation, he had completely forgotten about the sword in his hand. As his body shot upwards, the sword slipped from between his fingers and fell.</p>

  <p>This was the first time Luo Zheng had used a wild weapon. Giacomo had told him that the wild weapon would grow together with his body. However, what he hadn't told him was that in order for that to happen, he should have first transfused the Wild God Power into the sword.</p>

  <p>Using a weapon and making it cooperate with one's body was as natural as eating food and drinking water for the Wild Gods. Giacomo must have assumed Luo Zheng knew the details.</p>

  <p>Lisa, in the meantime, was still standing in front of Luo Zheng. She dithered for a while before realizing what had happened.</p>

  <p>The Yellow Emperor warriors roared with laughter.</p>

  <p>"Really? This guy can't even use a wild weapon?"</p>

  <p>"What the hell was the Nine Li race thinking? Why did they send such a fellow to fight?"</p>

  <p>"I bet they sent him as a joke."</p>

  <p>"I bet Lisa can destroy that guy with just a flick of her little finger."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's clumsiness confused many people. This was the kind of mistake a complete novice, who had never seen a wild weapon before, would make. Many concluded that Luo Zheng was just a clumsy Nine Li warrior.</p>

  <p>Little did they know, it was indeed the first time Luo Zheng had used a wild weapon.</p>

  <p>The Nine Li warriors' faces darkened as they saw Luo Zheng's sword fall.</p>

  <p>Although many of them had been looking forward to Luo Zheng's performance, they couldn't help but feel embarrassed to see their representative make such a simple mistake.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," Luo Zheng said with a small smile, appearing completely unperturbed by the situation.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter," Lisa said, shaking her head. She stared at Luo Zheng, a mixture of curiosity and anxiety in her eyes.</p>

  <p>Calmly, Luo Zheng dispersed his Wild God Power and found the long green sword he had lost. Now, having learnt from his mistake, he siphoned the Power into the sword, and it grew with him.</p>

  <p>"I'm ready," he declared.</p>

  <p>Holding the sword in one hand, Luo Zheng turned to look at Lisa.</p>

  <p>He hadn't yet activated the Nine Li Wild Body. He wanted to test Lisa's strength.</p>

  <p>Lisa nodded, her fingers pinching the black sword one by one. "Since you're ready, then I'll start!" she said softly.</p>

  <p>As soon as she had finished speaking, her eyes lit up, glowing with a sharp light.</p>

  <p>"Swish!"</p>

  <p>The long black sword, over 4, 000 feet long, suddenly swung towards Luo Zheng's face like a striking snake.</p>

  <p>She had impressive control over her body despite how huge it was. She exerted just the right amount of strength to deal with Luo Zheng, not more, not less. She kept a perfect distance from him, neither too far nor too close.</p>

  <p>Her simple sword strike might have looked ordinary to a layperson, but in fact, it required skill and precision to master.</p>

  <p>Many Wild Gods would have chosen to retreat if they saw their opponent use this sword strike, as the only way to avoid having one's face sliced in half was to step back.</p>

  <p>However, it was a trap. If one stepped back, one would become stuck and be crushed by Lisa's next attacks coming unstoppable like a tidal wave.</p>

  <p>This was Lisa's formidable power and control. She knew how to read her opponent and how to take advantage of the rhythm of the battle.</p>

  <p>Everything she did had a reason, and she knew how to make the battle go her way.</p>

  <p>In absolute terms, Elsa's strength was not inferior to Lisa's. But Elsa was no strategist. She could be careless, so she could fight, but she was no match for Lisa. It was no wonder she had lost. Her strength could not compensate for her predictability and lack of strategy.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng was not Elsa.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng refused to retreat.</p>

  <p>Standing still, he slightly tilted his head to one side.</p>

  <p>The black thin sword flew past his cheek, missing it by about a foot. This might seem like safe distance, but both Luo Zheng and Lisa stood towering over ten thousand feet tall.</p>

  <p>To a Wild God, a foot was no more than a hair's breadth.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, Luo Zheng had dodged Lisa's attack with enviable confidence.</p>

  <p>Calm and unflinching as Lisa seemed, she was, in spite of herself, impressed.</p>

  <p>'How is that possible?</p>

  <p>Is it out of sheer dumb luck?' wondered Lisa in disbelief.</p>

  <p>'The distance between us was so small...I would surely have chopped his head off with my sword if he had made the tiniest of mistakes. And yet, he didn't. He dodged it!'</p>

  <p>A smile danced on Luo Zheng's face. Unlike Lisa, he was the embodiment of calm, inside and out.</p>

  <p>Seeing that, Lisa seethed with fury, even though her face remained deadpan.</p>

  <p>Her thin sword was immediately ricocheted and once again swung towards Luo Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>This time, Luo Zheng threw back his head. The thin black sword swept across the air just above his head. Again, it was just a foot away, and the sword severed a few of the hairs on his head.</p>

  <p>'This guy... He is not just relying on his luck!'</p>

  <p>Lisa was shocked at this revelation. She had thought Luo Zheng's achievements were nothing more than a fluke.</p>

  <p>She had the best proprioception and body control among her peers from the younger generation. She outperformed even her brother, Jerome.</p>

  <p>But even she didn't have the level of command that Luo Zheng had.</p>

  <p>Panic gripped her heart. She realized that the man in front of her was no ordinary person.</p>

  <p>As her mind raced, the thin black sword danced even more quickly.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng didn't make a single step. He stayed rooted to the spot, leaning away from Lisa's advancing attacks. He resembled a birch tree, its flexible, strong trunk bending in the storm.</p>

  <p>Far away in the distance, the elders of the Yellow Emperor race watched, and their eyes widened in surprise.</p>

  <p>These elders had fought many battles and witnessed many more. They knew how strong Lisa was, and how difficult it was to dodge her attacks.</p>
