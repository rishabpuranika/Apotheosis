<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The intersecting stalagmites pressed heavily from all directions. The five Ear Mice squeaked as the passageway closed.</p>

  <p>One of the Ear Mice took out its Other Shore Token, an iron house.</p>

  <p>"Everyone, get in the house! Hurry up! Take cover!"</p>

  <p>Such tokens of descending type were rare and unpopular on the Other Shore. This token could be used to imprison opponents. It could also be used as a defensive shield due to its durability.</p>

  <p>Without hesitation, the other four Ear Mice sought refuge.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>The stalagmites extended rapidly until they were pushing at the surface of the iron house.</p>

  <p>Clank! Clank! Clank!</p>

  <p>Under the great pressure, the iron house made a grating sound.</p>

  <p>"The iron house can resist three thousand Jun of force. The stalagmites are heavy, but they are not enough to break it! Don't worry!" the first Ear Mouse said.</p>

  <p>"Squeak! Squeak! Squeak!"</p>

  <p>"Squeak! Squeak! Squeak!"</p>

  <p>The other four Ear Mice echoed.</p>

  <p>In terms of cultivation methods and theurgies, the Ear Mice were weaker than the other super forces, but their Other Shore Tokens had always been the strongest.</p>

  <p>But the relief didn't last long. After a few seconds, the foundations of the iron house couldn't bear the load any longer. It was crushed by the great force.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The five Ear Mice in the iron house were crushed into minced meat in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>The stalagmites in the cave continued to grow rapidly. Even though the group had passed through the narrow place, they still couldn't afford to stop running.</p>

  <p>"Speed up! You can't resist these stalagmites," Luo Zheng reminded.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had tried to prevent the growth of those stalagmites, but even he couldn't restrain the power contained within them.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>They all silently rushed onward.</p>

  <p>The stalagmites grew faster and faster. From time to time, some even shot out from the flanks. Any carelessness would cause death.</p>

  <p>Through this, the advantage of the Ear Mice was revealed.</p>

  <p>They were small and flexible. Even if a stalagmite suddenly shot down from above, they could easily dodge it.</p>

  <p>Sally had never experienced such danger. Her round eyes wide open, she kept flying up and down. Suddenly, a stalagmite shot down from above. It was as sharp as a sword, and it was indestructible.</p>

  <p>Anyone hit by it would feel like they were being stabbed with thousands of Jun of force, except excruciatingly slower.</p>

  <p>The stalagmite shot out toward Sally's head.</p>

  <p>"Look out!"</p>

  <p>Chaim, who was flying on the right, knocked Sally aside, pushing her a few feet away.</p>

  <p>Just like Luo Zheng, Chaim paid attention to everyone while flying, but he cared about Sally the most.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The stalagmite missed Sally, but it pierced Chaim's right shoulder. He had tried to avoid it but failed. His muscles cut by the stalagmite, he bled profusely.</p>

  <p>"Chaim, you..." Sally was shocked to see Chaim's large wound.</p>

  <p>"Don't space out! Keep running!" Chaim shouted in a loud voice.</p>

  <p>The stalagmites in the cave grew more and more quickly. There was no time to waste.</p>

  <p>After tens of thousands of feet, the stalagmites finally stopped shooting out.</p>

  <p>Everyone had passed through in peace.</p>

  <p>Hutton and the others gasped for air.</p>

  <p>Sally cleaned the wound on Chaim's shoulder.</p>

  <p>Darth and the other Ear Mice looked back with lingering fear. The passageway they had come through was now crammed with stalagmites.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked back at the stalagmites and walked toward them.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, what are you doing?" Dorothy asked.</p>

  <p>"I want to check them out. They are too strange," Luo Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>No less than a million stalagmites had grown along the way. If each of them needed a Chaotic Source Spirit to support it, then there must be over a million Chaotic Source Spirits. But this was obviously impossible.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng approached the stalagmites. He lightly touched one of them, poking a hole right through it.</p>

  <p>"Sure enough," Luo Zheng muttered.</p>

  <p>"The stalagmites have become fragile," said Darth, agape.</p>

  <p>"Yes." Luo Zheng nodded as he raised his head to look at the cave ceiling. "The Chaotic Source Spirits came all the way with us. They stayed in the stalagmites and used them to attack us."</p>

  <p>"They must have kept moving ahead of us to merge with new stalagmites, abandoning the ones we've already passed," Darth remarked. "The Chaotic Source Spirits moved fast through these rocks!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't care about this. He narrowed his eyes. "So why have they given up now?"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Darth was puzzled by Luo Zheng's words.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng turned to look at the deep passage ahead. "If there is an end to the cave, the Chaotic Source Spirits just need to wait there to make sure we can't break through quickly. Then the other Chaotic Source Spirits can use the stalagmites to assassinate us. Since we can't use the Grand Teleportation, we would surely die."</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng finished his words, a chill went through his companions.</p>

  <p>No one would be able to escape such a maneuver, if true.</p>

  <p>"Master Luo Zheng, don't give them ideas! The Chaotic Source Spirits are intelligent and they can understand human language!" said Darth anxiously.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled calmly. "Precisely because they are intelligent, they must have already thought of this. The only reason why they didn't push through it is they have other ways to deal with us, and they are confident that they can capture us."</p>

  <p>With these words, Luo Zheng pointed forward.</p>

  <p>Rocks in the distance started to move. They separated from the walls and turned into rock giants.</p>

  <p>An ordinary rock giant wouldn't have been a threat. But those possessed by the Chaotic Source Spirits were indestructible.</p>

  <p>Dong! Dong! Dong!</p>

  <p>Huge rock giants emerged from all directions and charged toward the group.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Dorothy, Feng Ge, Chaim, and the Ear Mice scrambled to take out their Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>A flower spun above Dorothy and took her shape. This was the unique Twin Blossoms. The two Dorothies, hearts connected, both carried a sword. The power of Dorothy's Origin Swordsmanship would thus be twice as strong.</p>

  <p>The Warrior of the Stone Hill floated in the air beside Feng Ge, with a sword in one hand and a thousand swords in the other.</p>

  <p>Chaim also deployed his Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>Strong warriors like them were not afraid of fighting head-on. What they feared most were ambush attacks in the dark. But now that the Chaotic Source Spirits had decided to confront them face-to-face, they would definitely fight to the end.</p>
