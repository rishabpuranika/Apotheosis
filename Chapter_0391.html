<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 391 The Reasonable Disciple Of Blackrock Peak (Part One) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The competition continued.</p>

  <p>The disciples with poor strength were weeded out, while those with distinguishable power moved on with the competition.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was already halfway through the competition, but he hadn't encountered a strong and remarkable competitor yet.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, there were two disciples who underestimated Luo Luo Zheng when they first saw him. One was from Azure Peak, and the other from Blackrock Peak. Although the two of them were at nature level consummation, both had prominent and notable capabilities since they had been selected to participate in the famous All Peaks Competition.</p>

  <p>At first, they were under the impression that Luo Luo Zheng had defeated Cecil just because of luck, so they were confident that they could beat Luo Luo Zheng easily on the field. However, to their astonishment, the result of the competition was not what they thought it would be. The constant blow and strike of Luo Zheng's hard fists gave them no chance to fight back at all. In the end, they ran out of power and spirit and lay on the floor exhausted.</p>

  <p>There was only silence when the two fights were concluded. Everyone was astonished and amazed at how strong and powerful Luo Luo Zheng was. They didn't know yet which realm he belonged to, but they were certain that the only person who could match his strength was Tianming.</p>

  <p>The remaining part of the competition went on smoothly for Luo Luo Zheng. Most of his competitors would just show up to the stage and fight him for a short time then eventually give up. A few of them would instantly admit their defeat by not showing up to the stage at all. They all knew the gap of their strength with Luo Luo Zheng and didn't want to end up injured or wounded, so they wouldn't dare try. As a result, the competition became more like an amusement to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>As the competition continued, the strengths of the talented disciples from thirty-three peaks were gradually revealed.</p>

  <p>So far, Luo Luo Zheng had eleven consecutive wins without any defeat, which evidently was an extremely notable score among all the competitors.</p>

  <p>Some of his fights brought the interest and applause of the people like the ones with Mack and Cecil.</p>

  <p>Like Luo Luo Zheng, Tianming was also winning consecutively. But in contrast, Tianming's strike was more definite and intense than Luo Zheng's. Also, he had defeated some strong and competitive opponents that made his demonstration much more significant than Luo Zheng's, no matter if it was the competition with Kim Yue from Jade Peak, the one with Shawn Xu from Ninety-foot Peak, or the one with the only one candidate of the Illuminating Soul Realm of Vulture Peak: Marvin Ma. None of those could easily be underestimated.</p>

  <p>And what made Tianming even more dazzling and attractive was the fact that he did not pull out his sword in the whole competition.</p>

  <p>A swordsman who didn't use his sword but defeated his opponents with his bare fists was unbelievable and amazing. Moreover, he gave everyone the fantasy of how quite powerful he must be if he used his sword.</p>

  <p>People started to exchange their opinions enthusiastically about the result of the whole competition. Some even predicted that Tianming would get the final success in All Peaks Competition as a disciple of nature level consummation realm. The result would break the record of the whole Cloud Sect history.</p>

  <p>As for Luo Luo Zheng, much as he had displayed the remarkable outburst of his strength, he didn't draw as much attention from the audience as Tianming did in his rounds. It wasn't only because he was in a lower realm and was not sufficiently experienced, but because comparing to Tianming, he encountered some comparatively weaker competitors. People assumed that if he had faced a strong competitor like a disciple of Illuminating Soul Realm from Skytop Peak or from Blackrock Peak, he wouldn't have that consecutive wins.</p>

  <p>Apart from Luo Luo Zheng and Tianming who were maintaining the consecutive wins, Jill from Lady Peak was having exceptional performance as well. Like Luo Luo Zheng, she was not even in the nature level consummation realm. She was currently in Grade 9 of nature level, so having taken down quite a few competitors of nature level consummation realm and one of Illuminating Soul Realm made her look extraordinary and notable among all the disciples.</p>

  <p>As lots of the participants were ruled out and the competition was close to the next stage, only thirteen persons kept winning throughout the whole competition. Aside from Luo Luo Zheng, Tianming, and Jill who were nature creatures, the remaining nine persons were: Wing and Sheeny from Skytop Peak, Even and Dick from Blackrock Peak, Jason from Azure Peak, Marshall from Daylily Peak, and Hansel from Skyrain Peak.</p>

  <p>The audience got more excited and thrilled than ever. They were looking forward to seeing the competition take place between any two of these thirteen ever-victorious disciples.</p>

  <p>The audience was expecting that the participants would demonstrate their best capabilities that would make the competition much more interesting than before. It would be unlikely to see some give-up scenario among these top participants.</p>

  <p>As if hearing their hearts' desire, Cloud Sect announced the groups for the next round.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's competitor was finally assigned.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng from Drizzle Peak will compete against Dick from Blackrock Peak," the referee announced.</p>

  <p>The announcement instantly brought a din of hot discussions amongst the crowd.</p>

  <p>"I don't think Luo Luo Zheng can hold onto his consecutive wins any longer now that he's going to fight Dick. Dick is not only a top disciple of Blackrock Peak, but also on the top fifty Cloud Sect list."</p>

  <p>"The result is so predictable. I'm placing my bet on Dick. But it seems the compensation rate is low because many people have already placed theirs on Dick. What if I place mine on Luo Luo Zheng? Any chance he can win?"</p>

  <p>"There is no way Luo Luo Zheng can defeat Dick. I guess Luo Luo Zheng will just give up this time. To him, the consecutive wins is already a success. He has already earned the glamour and reputation from the competition. There is no point in confronting Dick and getting his ass kicked. Do you remember how hard Luo Luo Zheng hit Blackrock Peak's disciple Mack last time? If Luo Luo Zheng doesn't give up, then he is bound to be tortured badly. It will be more like a revenge than a competition to Dick."</p>

  <p>In spite of how well Luo Luo Zheng had performed in the previous rounds, no one was confident that he could beat Dick Zhou in this round.</p>

  <p>The impression became even clearer when the final compensation rate came out. In this match, if Luo Luo Zheng defeated Dick, the compensation rate would be one to nine. But if Dick won, it would be one to one. People booed at the vivid contrast of the compensation rate because it was as if the result had been fixed in ahead. Almost everyone bet on Dick.</p>

  <p>After the referee's announcement, Luo Luo Zheng prepared to get onto the stage.</p>

  <p>Master Wen, who had been sitting next to Luo Luo Zheng, was upset and worried by the time the competition was about to begin. As he was ready to remind Luo Luo Zheng, the latter stopped him by waving his hand and smiled awkwardly.</p>

  <p>"Master Wen, please stop smothering me," he said.</p>

  <p>Master Wen had always been protective of Luo Luo Zheng. He was like a nagging mother, reminding and giving him advice all the time. But it was the same sermon that Luo Luo Zheng would always receive. "You must learn to protect yourself. It does not matter if you lose. If you think you cannot defeat him, just give up. You have already been promoted into the next round anyway."</p>
