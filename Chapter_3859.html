<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3859 The Growing Light Column </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>In the far northwest of the Source World, there was a unique copper tree.</p>

  <p>The roots of the tree reached deep into the ground. After growing for a long time, it was now able to extract a very special type of copper ore from the deep underground and absorb the ore into its core.</p>

  <p>This copper was very flexible, and its raw form, which was viscous liquid, gave it the name "water copper".</p>

  <p>The water copper could be cut with a knife easily.</p>

  <p>But once a huge force came into contact with it, it would automatically become solid and extremely hard in an instant. All in all, instead of a type of ore, it could also be described as a kind of liquid with magical properties.</p>

  <p>Based on these properties, the captain of the Black Ship finally built the Combat Dragon Pillar for the brass man.</p>

  <p>The brass man had wanted to test the effect of the Combat Dragon Pillar before, so he used the Power Transfer Lens and the Withering Power to exert a force of nearly three hundred thousand Jun on the pillar. The result was satisfying for him? the pillar could take on the force easily.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the stronger the force the Combat Dragon Pillar received, the stronger it'd become.</p>

  <p>Had the brass man possessed three hundred thousand Jun of force before, Divine Farmer wouldn't have been able to cut the Combat Dragon Pillar.</p>

  <p>But at that time, the brass man had only relied on his own strength when he used the Combat Dragon Absorb, so the Combat Dragon Pillar was naturally destroyed by Divine Farmer with a casual strike of his ruler.</p>

  <p>Now, however, the brass man's weapon wasn't the "Combat Dragon Pillar"? his weapon now was a human's body.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng was basically an Eternal Realm warrior, a force of three hundred thousand Jun wasn't a laughing matter. Even a warrior like Luo Zheng would still have his body crushed if his body was struck by such a force!</p>

  <p>Everything the brass man did just now was done on the spur of the moment and without any further consideration at all. Now that he calmed down, he realized that what happened didn't at all make any sense.</p>

  <p>On Luo Zheng's Three Purities Stone in the Grand Plain Stage, Luo Zheng's anchor bodies changed.</p>

  <p>The force exerted on Luo Zheng's real physical body had been transmitted to his anchor bodies.</p>

  <p>One's anchor body was connected to the Eternal Scroll Painting, and the Eternal Scroll Painting was connected to the Eternal Divine Courtyard.</p>

  <p>When the force was transmitted to Luo Zheng's anchor bodies, an imperceptible wave of energy was also transmitted to the sacred cup in the Eternal Divine Courtyard at an unimaginable speed.</p>

  <p>Pa!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's body shook. Consequently, even the entire sacred cup shook.</p>

  <p>After the tiny ripples on the surface of the thick blood in the cup died out, the map in the circle of light on the ground began to change.</p>

  <p>There were originally two light columns rising in the map. Each of them respectively represented the bloodline of Chiyou and the bloodline of the Chaos Ancient God. These two light columns both had a life attribute, so they were in the lower left area.</p>

  <p>However, after Luo Zheng took on the three hundred thousand Jun of force, another light column grew several inches tall in the fan-shaped area on the lower right side, the area which represented destruction!</p>

  <p>Complicated expressions appeared on the faces of the four bronze statues on the square.</p>

  <p>It was already hard to believe that this guy was able to perform the Blood Merge Reconstruction.</p>

  <p>Now, he also wasn't playing by the rules?</p>

  <p>Generally, even if a qualified person succeeded in obtaining the recognition of the ancestry-level bloodline, the shape of the map would be set in the shortest amount of time and wouldn't change again.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had been lying motionless in the sacred cup for a long time, so why did the light column in the map grow again?</p>

  <p>This looked like he was cheating.</p>

  <p>However, as long as there was a light column connected to the edge of the circle of light, it meant that he was acknowledged by the ancestry-level bloodline and also obtained the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>There were 373 light columns in total. How great the potential of the ancestry-level bloodline one merged with was would depend on how much potential the warriors in the sacred cup had and how many light columns they connected.</p>

  <p>"Something seems wrong with the ancestry-level bloodline, don't you think?"</p>

  <p>"If this light column can also reach the circle of light, then this kid will have three light columns connected to the circle of light..."</p>

  <p>"The best record in the Eternal Divine Courtyard is fourteen light columns.</p>

  <p>It happened a very long time ago, and unlike what he's doing now. The warrior, who made that record, made the fourteen light columns grow in one go?"</p>

  <p>The four bronze statues were all staring at Luo Zheng. A faint trace of excitement was apparent in their eyes.</p>

  <p>Their sense of duty made them wish that everything would go as usual, so when Luo Zheng first appeared, they were quite hostile to him.</p>

  <p>At this moment, however, their thoughts had somewhat changed.</p>

  <p>The Eternal Divine Courtyard had been abandoned for a long time...</p>

  <p>Sealed by the Time Lock, what was left of the nearly eternal time might remain this way forever, and that would mean endless boring years for them.</p>

  <p>Although no one said it out loud, deep in their hearts, they all hoped that something would break this stagnant eternal state. And now, this strange thing appeared.</p>

  <p>Divine Farmer stared pensively at Luo Zheng, who was carried on the brass man's shoulder.</p>

  <p>Even though he couldn't figure out what was going on, he now fully understood why the Element Spirit race wanted to win Luo Zheng over.</p>

  <p>But he'd gone this far, so he didn't intend to give up.</p>

  <p>With a slight wave of his right hand, the already twisted Divine Farmer Ruler was hidden inside his body.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>A terrifying bloodline power was released from Divine Farmer's body. A split second later, a green, horned, bull-headed shadow appeared behind him.</p>

  <p>The shadow let out a strange cry and disappeared in an instant. The moment it disappeared, it started materializing within Divine Farmer's body.</p>

  <p>In addition to using their own bloodline to condense a lifeblood weapon, Eternal Realm warriors also had their own bloodline theurgies.</p>

  <p>For example, the golden sword of Eastern Emperor Taiyi and the Nine-Sun World Destruction of Emperor Di Jun were both their bloodline therugies.</p>

  <p>Divine Farmer named his bloodline "Weird Blood". As one of the root-level bloodlines, the Weird Blood was extremely powerful, not at all inferior to the bloodline belonged to Xuanyuan, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Emperor Di Jun, or other Eternal Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>However, very few people in the Source World had seen the bloodline token of Divine Farmer because he very rarely used it.</p>

  <p>The Weird Blood could transform him into three different mutants, which were all indestructible. During the transformation process, however, Divine Farmer's consciousness would be hazy. Moreover, the more he used his blood token, the longer he would stay in his mutant form.</p>

  <p>He was worried that one day, he might lose the ability to transform back to his original form and become a strange monster without wisdom, so he was very careful in using this bloodline token of his.</p>

  <p>In fact, he didn't want to use his bloodline token in handling the members of the Black Ship.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, upon seeing the strange characteristics of Luo Zheng's body, he felt the urgency to activate his blood token.</p>

  <p>His body began to lengthen, and two horns grew on his head. His feet also turned into a pair of strong hooves...</p>

  <p>It was a mutant in the form of a goat monster... Divine Farmer's consciousness was gradually fading.</p>

  <p>The goat monster was the most ferocious of his three mutant forms, but it was also the form that Divine Farmer hated the least.</p>

  <p>The only thing that Divine Farmer could do to control this goat monster was to plant a purpose in his mind? he must take Luo Zheng back.</p>

  <p>A second later, the consciousness in the goat monster's eyes completely disappeared. After a moment of haziness, it let out a strange howl.</p>

  <p>The brass man standing not far away had been observing for a long time.</p>

  <p>Seeing that the goat monster was still a little confused, he immediately carried Luo Zheng and smashed at the monster with Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>The strike still contained a force of three hundred thousand Jun.</p>

  <p>While the goat monster was still howling, it was directly thrown down from the air, creating a huge crater in the ground.</p>

  <p>However, the almost indestructible goat monster suffered no injury at all. It turned over, ran a few steps on the ground with both hands and feet, and pounced on the brass man.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>With Luo Zheng on his shoulder, the brass man once again smashed Luo Zheng towards the ground. He didn't believe that the mutant transformed from Divine Farmer wouldn't really be killed.</p>

  <p>However, what the brass man didn't know was that every time he carried Luo Zheng and smashed him, the third light column in the area symbolizing destruction under the sacred cup in the Eternal Divine Courtyard would grow taller.</p>
