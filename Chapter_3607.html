<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng couldn't help the burst of admiration that flooded his heart as he stared at the path flanked by countless footprints.</p>

  <p>If the red mist hadn't lured out all these footprints, he would've never seen it.</p>

  <p>The human woman whispered something to another red ball and Zheng watched it zoom straight onto the path.</p>

  <p>"This way please," she said to him with a smile.</p>

  <p>The path was winding and zigzag. If she entered first, Zheng might flee behind her. There was also the possibility of the Moon Fire Slaves abducting him.</p>

  <p>Zheng and Feng Ge looked at each other with alert, but they still stepped on the path in silence.</p>

  <p>The human woman originally wanted to walk behind Zheng and Feng Ge but No. 12 beat her to it, shrinking his body and situating himself behind them.</p>

  <p>The fight had ceased on the three sides but they still remained on guard against each other.</p>

  <p>Since it didn't really matter, the human woman chose to just let it be and settled herself at the very back.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>Thunderous footsteps echoed around them as invisible feet stomped on both sides of the path, trampling the gobi into pieces and only leaving the path they were walking on intact.</p>

  <p>This winding path wasn't long and with the red ball leading them, they were able to pass through in just about three minutes.</p>

  <p>As the human woman walked out of the path, she drilled out the red ball, placed her palm on her lips, and sucked in the air.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh</p>

  <p>All the red fog got sucked into her mouth!</p>

  <p>When it disappeared, the energy soul stopped attacking and the messy gobi resumed its original form as if nothing happened at all.</p>

  <p>"You can open the temple now," the woman said to Zheng indifferently.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded and walked towards the temple gates.</p>

  <p>The temple wasn't small by any means. Zheng considered it very large in comparison to the ones he'd seen.</p>

  <p>As he stared at the gates, he couldn't help but gasp in shock.</p>

  <p>A huge part of the gates had been charred!</p>

  <p>Not only that, but there were also numerous scratches and irreparable damage on both sides of the gates.</p>

  <p>A lot of effort had gone towards opening the gates, Zheng had no doubt about that.</p>

  <p>"Is the temple so impenetrable?" he asked. The damage it had taken was dire but it didn't look as if it yielded at all. "None of you can open it?"</p>

  <p>As far as Zheng knew, destroying a temple shouldn't be that hard. The Grand Sky Temple in Stage Thirteen, for example, could definitely be opened with brute force if he was given enough time. Was this temple before him different then? After all, many powerful masters had descended from higher stages, trying to open it before.</p>

  <p>These masters came with their own methods, and it couldn't be that none of them ever succeeded.</p>

  <p>Zheng's question was ignored by the Moon Fire Slaves but the human woman smiled. "Of course nobody could open it. What's the point in waiting for you then if it could be easily opened?" she replied. "Many people have perished in trying to destroy this temple. A Spirit King even met his end here."</p>

  <p>Back then, a Spirit King from the Element Spirit race had come to Stage Seventeen. At that time, the race had personally brought a purified being into this place in hopes of invading the temple.</p>

  <p>Both the Spirit King and the purified being died in the end.</p>

  <p>This piece of news was top secret within the Element Spirit race and the human woman overheard it through a special channel. Now, she wanted to seize the chance to verify it from the Moon Fire Slaves.</p>

  <p>After all, the death of a Spirit King was a horrible loss to the Element Spirit race.</p>

  <p>"Cut the crap and open the temple!" one Moon Fire Slave snapped, glaring at her coldly.</p>

  <p>She let the attitude pass and continued to talk to Zheng. "This temple is extremely sturdy but that's not the only reason why people can't enter. It is, in fact, possible to destroy it but doing so will incite calamity and destruction upon those who try."</p>

  <p>A trace of fear crossed her features as she recalled what happened when the Nihility race had tried to get inside the temple.</p>

  <p>She had been an ordinary member of the Nihility race back then. Though she didn't have a high position, she was present in their attempt to invade the temple and witnessed the instant death of all the elites who were there.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded, taking her words to heart. There was definitely a reason why the temple stood here for countless years.</p>

  <p>As he walked to the gates, Zheng could see a square stone that protruded in the center of them, engraved with stripes that corresponded to the lines on his palm.</p>

  <p>It was a peculiar feeling, finding the key to a door that had long since been unopened. The temple had been closed-off for countless years but now its secrets would finally be revealed. It was understandable for the Moon Fire Slaves and the human woman to be anxious.</p>

  <p>"Feng Ge, stay close to me," Zheng muttered in a low voice.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge nodded and quietly moved closer to him.</p>

  <p>Nobody knew what waited for them inside but Zheng knew that his life would only be valuable before he opened the gates. Once that was done, the temporary balance between them would break and chaos could ensue. They had to be on guard for this.</p>

  <p>With a deep breath, Zheng stretched out his hand and pressed it upon the square stone.</p>

  <p>It was a perfect fit!</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>A ray of blue light suddenly emerged from the stone, extending along the entire surface of the gates.</p>

  <p>His arm tightened on the stone and the gates let out a dull sound.</p>

  <p>Rumble! Rumble! Rumble!</p>

  <p>As the gates opened, the Moon Fire Slaves and that human woman took a step back.</p>

  <p>That step back had been necessary because of the heavy wave of killing intent that suddenly washed over them. Although Zheng had used the Other Shore Key to open the gates, they remained on high alert.</p>

  <p>Zheng, on the other hand, felt no fear. He didn't even bother assessing the situation before grabbing Feng Ge and heading straight inside.</p>

  <p id="top_16">The temple was dark but the moment they stepped inside, golden dots of light appeared like fireflies and illuminated their way.</p>

  <p>As these dots of light appeared, numerous candles also lit up and illuminated the entire hall.</p>

  <p>Around forty statues stood in front of them, most were human-shaped but a few were of strange forms. Zheng's eyes were immediately fixed on the sixth statue from the left.</p>

  <p>This statue had a human body and a snake tail. It was a member of the Snake Goddess race.</p>

  <p>It wasn't surprising to find this statue in a human race's temple since both races were related by blood.</p>

  <p>However, the statue in front of them looked exactly like the Snake Goddess Zheng had met in the Pear Hill.</p>

  <p>Seeing the Snake Goddess's statue here was one thing but the one next to it confused Zheng even more. There, in full-glory with three heads and six arms, stood Chiyou's statue.</p>
