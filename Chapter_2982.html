<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2982 The Sword Light Palace </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Beyond Wild Goose Pass, from Sweltering Desert to Excellence City and Cyan Brocade Plain, all these areas belonged to the Gracious Province.</p>

  <p>It was a very vast province. Excellence City was merely a springboard to get to other cities. All the large commercial flying ships passing by would quickly replenish themselves in the city and leave for the next destination.</p>

  <p>After staying in the Excellence City for a few days, Zheng had a rough understanding of the city.</p>

  <p>"Kenelm, according to you, it sounds like it would take a lot of work to move from one province to another one," said Zheng.</p>

  <p>Kenelm confirmed, "Indeed. The Source World is said to be a complete and integrated world, but actually each of its provinces is like a smaller world.</p>

  <p>Most of the warriors and even the True Gods find it hard to travel between provinces!"</p>

  <p>Zheng had believed that the Source World was a complete world like the divine land, but now he realized that he had been wrong.</p>

  <p>In comparison, the layout of the Source World was similar to that of the great worlds.</p>

  <p>Each of the provinces was equivalent to an independent world, and each province was distinctive.</p>

  <p>"In which province is Pear Hill located? Is it far from here?" Zheng inquired.</p>

  <p>"Pear Hill, you ask?" Kenelm seemed surprised. "It is located in Clapper Province, which is very far away from here. Are you planning to go there?"</p>

  <p>Kenelm had only known Zheng for a few days. Now he was sure that Zheng came from outside the Source World as he seemed to lack a lot of common sense about this world.</p>

  <p>Zheng shook his head. He did intend to go to Pear Hill sooner or later, but not today.</p>

  <p>Kenelm continued, "Consummate True Gods like us don't have the qualifications to travel between provinces, unless we join a large sect of a provincial scale."</p>

  <p>"A sect of a provincial scale?" Zheng repeated. "Does Pear Hill count?"</p>

  <p>Shaking his head, Kenelm answered with a smile, "It sure doesn't. For True Gods, a sect like Pear Hill is a legendary force! A sect of a provincial scale is one that controls an entire province such as the Sword Light Palace."</p>

  <p>There was a look of yearning in Kenelm's eyes when he spoke.</p>

  <p>"So, does that mean that the Gracious Province is controlled by Sword Light Palace?" Zheng asked in curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Wild Goose Pass is one of the exits of the Source World. Thus, the Gracious Province doesn't allow itself to be controlled by any sect. The Sword Light Palace controls the Seven-Star Province, which is next to the Gracious Province," elaborated Kenelm.</p>

  <p>"So how can I join Sword Light Palace?" Zheng asked with keen interest.</p>

  <p>Kenelm was glad to see that he had Zheng's attention on this matter. His eyes gleamed triumphantly.</p>

  <p>As a consummate True God, Kenelm was a little weaker than Zheng. Still, as a member of the Source World, he had sharp eyes. Just like him, Zheng was also a consummate True God, but Kenelm could tell that Zheng had mastered Truth of Godly Way, which meant Zheng had already been to Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>Kenelm had been trying hard to befriend him to take advantage of his strength.</p>

  <p>Kenelm elucidated, "To be honest, I have been longing to join Sword Light Palace all my life, but it's too difficult for people from Gracious Province to do so. The Sword Light Palace opens up places for recruits in Gracious Province every year, but it's almost impossible for warriors of Excellence City to snag a spot at any of these places. However, a month ago, we got some news." His expression became serious now. "Some time ago, a Stinger Guard of Sword Light Palace died in one of the caves in the west of Cyan Brocade Plain. The Sword Light Palace sent word that anyone who could find the Stinger Guard's tomb and belongings would be qualified to join the Sword Light Palace."</p>

  <p>"Since you're aware of this story, you must have tried to find it, right?" Zheng asked, intrigued by the story too.</p>

  <p>A wry smile appeared on Kenelm's face. "I did, of course! Half a month ago, I invited a few other consummate True Gods of Excellence City to explore the cave with me. We ended up encountering a lot of trouble in that cave. The Stinger Guard has become an evil ghost in the tomb and even killed a consummate True God."</p>

  <p>"Kenelm, since you have brought it up, do you want me to go there with you?" Zheng asked with a sparkle in his eyes.</p>

  <p>By now Zheng had gathered that Kenelm must have approached him with a purpose, but he couldn't figure out what it was.</p>

  <p>Kenelm nodded, "Zheng, although you haven't shown me your true strength, I know you have entered Sea of Truth before. Your Soul of Light must be far stronger than mine, and you should be able to take on the evil ghost."</p>

  <p>Kenelm also had a Soul of Light, but he hadn't been to the Sea of Truth before, so his soul hadn't been tested by the Sea of Truth. Obviously, there was a huge gap between his and Zheng's soul force.</p>

  <p>Zheng chewed on this for a while and then nodded slightly. "In that case, I'll go with you!"</p>

  <p>Although he was now in the Source World, a world full of powerful warriors, Zheng believed that he would be able to take care of himself as long as they did not encounter Other Shore Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>Kenelm was pleased at Zheng's decision. "Great! I'll summon my buddies and we will set off tomorrow!"</p>

  <p>In the early hours of the next morning, Kenelm led Zheng to the entrance of Excellence City.</p>

  <p>Three consummate True Gods had already gathered at the gate of the city.</p>

  <p>These three people looked very young, but Zheng could see that they were two to five thousand years old.</p>

  <p>Just like Kenelm, these True Gods had never entered the Sea of Truth either.</p>

  <p>Kenelm made introductions and then asked one of them, "Where is Tanner?"</p>

  <p>One of them sighed and said, "After you took him there last time, he had been thinking about it all the time. He informed some people in the port. I don't know what benefit he promised them, but it seems a few people went there with him yesterday!"</p>

  <p>Kenelm's expression changed dramatically. "He what? How could he do that! That traitor!"</p>

  <p>"The people he had recruited are the guards of the commercial groups who are recuperating in Excellence City. They are a strong bunch. I think even if they do find the Stinger Guard's belongings, Tanner won't be the one getting them," the man sighed.</p>

  <p>"Well, let's go now!" Kenelm's anxiety was high.</p>

  <p>These people had always dreamed of joining the Sword Light Palace. It was the only way for them to grow their cultivation base and move beyond the consummation of True God Realm. If they failed in joining the Sword Light Palace, they would never reach the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't say anything. He figured that Tanner might be one of Kenelm's friends, and it was common for people to betray their friends for benefits.</p>

  <p>However, he also understood that if he joined in the exploration of the cave of the Stinger Guard, it would become more complicated.</p>

  <p>Eventually, the five of them, including Zheng, flew towards the west of Excellence City under Kenelm's leadership.</p>

  <p>Half a day later, Zheng came upon a stretch of grassland.</p>

  <p>He had seen this plain in the scene that the Ear Mouse had shown him before. It must be the Cyan Brocade Plain.</p>
