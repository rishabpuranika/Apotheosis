<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Jago had been staring at Luo Zheng with his eyes wide open for a few seconds.</p>

  <p>After a while, he was jolted back to his senses by his desire to live.</p>

  <p>As soon as he had lifted himself off the ground, he bolted straight towards the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow and jumped on its back.</p>

  <p>"Flag Master, forgive my ignorance. But why are you able to command the Sun Crow?" Jago looked thoroughly awestruck as he asked Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>It went without saying that he knew how terrifying a Corpse Spirit Sun Crow was. It seemed incredulous that Luo Zheng was able to control it.</p>

  <p>The Corpse Spirit Jin Wu were enormous. Moreover, they were aggressively assaulting the Sky Net above. The warriors of the Other Shore Realm as well as the Taiyi Guards were not even qualified to be the opponents of these magnificent and powerful Corpse Spirit Jin Wu.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng remained standing straight on the back of the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow.</p>

  <p>He was controlling it to spew out blue flames constantly. As he heard Jago's question, he seemed amused. "You can do the same," he replied calmly.</p>

  <p>"What? That can't be right!"</p>

  <p>Jago was utterly bewildered at Luo Zheng's answer. Meanwhile, the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow flapped its massive wings splendidly and swiftly soared forward.</p>

  <p>Most of the Corpse Spirit Jin Wu had already gathered above. They charged fearlessly towards the Sky Net as commanded by Phoenix. There were only a few Corpse Spirit Jin Wu left to deal with the Taiyi Generals inside the Mountain Sea Pass.</p>

  <p>"Wow! That looks terrifying," Jago exclaimed as he observed their movements.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, a stream of blue flame hurtled down from the sky. It narrowly missed Sinclair as he rolled on the ground to dodge it. However, the heat of the flames had singed his hair.</p>

  <p>He had the protection of the Chaotic Source Spirits to thank. Without it, his body would have been badly burned by that attack.</p>

  <p>As he was dodging the flames from above and on the ground, Sinclair brandished his long sword and slashed three times towards the direction of the sky.</p>

  <p>"Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!"</p>

  <p>"Three Consecutive Punishment Slashes!" Sinclair shouted at the top of his lungs.</p>

  <p>Three rays of sword radiance broke through the air. They dragged the traces of countless space cracks and slashed at the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow above.</p>

  <p>Surprisingly, the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow didn't dodge his attack at all. It seemed like it wasn't taking Sinclair's three slashes seriously.</p>

  <p>"Puff! Puff! Puff!"</p>

  <p>The token of swordsmanship that Sinclair cultivated was an extremely offensive technique. However, the sword radiance didn't even damage the feather of the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow as his attack landed.</p>

  <p>"Unbelievable. These Corpse Spirit Jin Wu really are too strong. I can't stand against them..."</p>

  <p>As Sinclair admitted this, a look of complete disappointment registered on his face.</p>

  <p>When he was guarding the Mountain Sea Pass, he was very much aware of the fact that he would have to fight to the death.</p>

  <p>There were so many of his companions that had met their demise in the Grand River Fortress. He was very lucky to have been able to escape and survive this long. He thought it was enough for him to have lived for more days than his companions.</p>

  <p>As he thought of this, his fighting spirit declined significantly. He felt quite hopeless and dejected now. However, he was still fighting.</p>

  <p>"What a foolish human! You will end up the same way as your companions no matter how much you struggle. Give up now!" a demon woman mocked and taunted Sinclair as she stood on the back of the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow.</p>

  <p>The Corpse Spirit Sun Crow opened its huge beak once more and spat out blue flames towards Sinclair.</p>

  <p>Sinclair was now facing death as a stream of flames shot towards him from above. He didn't have any option left other than to escape and run away once more.</p>

  <p>"Swoosh..."</p>

  <p>At that very moment, Sinclair spotted another huge shadow sweeping past the corner of his eyes.</p>

  <p>"What rotten luck. Here comes another Corpse Spirit Sun Crow. It's such a waste of energy for such powerful existences to deal with me, a mere Taiyi General. Alas..." Sinclair sighed deeply. He was starting to accept that he would most probably lose his life here.</p>

  <p>He couldn't even stand a chance against one Corpse Spirit Sun Crow. One was already more than enough to kill him, let alone two of those powerful beings.</p>

  <p>The demon woman of the Divine Lair who stood on the back of the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow was also surprised to see another one of these creatures.</p>

  <p>She thought she would be able to dispose of the Taiyi General with ease.</p>

  <p>Therefore, she didn't need anyone else to interfere. However, she noticed that the other Corpse Spirit Sun Crow was soaring at her direction at an extremely fast speed. It showed no sign of slowing down. Soon enough, the demon woman finally realized that something wasn't quite right.</p>

  <p>It was too late. She didn't have any time to redirect her Corpse Spirit Sun Crow out of the way. The other Corpse Spirit Sun Crow was flying so fast towards her that she wouldn't be able to dodge the attack. Moreover, she couldn't quite see who was controlling it. She only saw a manly figure dismounting the other Corpse Spirit Sun Crow and rushing in front of her at lightning speed.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no..." She only had one choice now.</p>

  <p>The demon woman left her mount without the slightest hesitation. But as soon as she dismounted and flew upwards, the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow on the opposite instantly raised its massive wings and slashed at her from a very suitable height.</p>

  <p>"Puff..."</p>

  <p>The wings of the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow were extraordinarily strong. Even Luo Zheng could hardly withstand their attack. In the blink of an eye, the demon woman was chopped into pieces.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng soared towards the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow and resumed his position on its back. He turned around and smiled at Jago. "I told you you could do it too."</p>

  <p>What Luo Zheng told him was true. It was not that difficult to control a Corpse Spirit Sun Crow. Jago was able to enter the Other Shore Realm. Thus, it meant the strength of his soul was more than enough to command it.</p>

  <p>When they went over to where the second Corpse Spirit Sun Crow was, Jago was the one who controlled the first one. Luo Zheng just frightened the demon woman enough to make her leave her mount. In this way, they got the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow very easily.</p>

  <p>"Incredible! I can control it too!"</p>

  <p>Jago exclaimed excitedly.</p>

  <p>Never in his wildest dreams did it occur that he would be able to take control of such a powerful and magnificent existence.</p>

  <p>While he was pondering on this newfound ability, the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow under his feet suddenly spurted blue flames towards the distance.</p>

  <p>They effectively burned thousands of Jin Wu to ashes.</p>

  <p>Below them, Sinclair couldn't believe his eyes. He was completely dumbfounded when he saw Luo Zheng grab a Corpse Spirit Sun Crow with such ease.</p>

  <p>Putting aside Luo Zheng's peculiar means, he knew it was impossible to take hold of Corpse Spirit Jin Wu. These were known as powerful weapons used by the Jin Wu. However, Luo Zheng was able to put the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow under his control as soon as he gently leapt on its back. It was simply unbelievable.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng stepped lightly on the back of the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow, it descended to the ground smoothly. "General Sinclair, please get on." He smiled encouragingly.</p>

  <p>"I... I can get on it too? Incredible." Sinclair felt completely flattered and amazed.</p>

  <p>"Of course! Come with me and let's grab another Corpse Spirit Sun Crow!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng replied graciously.</p>

  <p>When they launched a broad attack, Queenie ordered three Corpse Spirit Jin Wu to target the Mountain Sea Pass. Now, there was only one Corpse Spirit Sun Crow chasing the other Taiyi Generals in the Mountain Sea Pass.</p>

  <p>As soon as Sinclair stepped on the back of one, the two Corpse Spirit Jin Wu flew upwards once again.</p>

  <p>They soared high up in the sky towards the other Jin Wu.</p>

  <p>Nearly a hundred Corpse Spirit Jin Wu were spurting out blue flames simultaneously. The swirling flames poured onto the Sky Net above.</p>

  <p>The defensive power of the Sky Net Array should not be underestimated. It was highly regarded as one of the most powerful skills of the Taiyi Heaven Palace. No matter how wildly the blue flame burned, the Sky Net remained unmoved and unharmed.</p>

  <p>The blue light of the flames shone on Phoenix's face. Her beautiful eyes were full of confident calmness.</p>

  <p>She believed that no matter how tough the Sky Net was, it would eventually collapse. If they continued to burn it like this, it would only be a matter of time before they broke through it.</p>

  <p>Once the Sky Net Array was broken, the Jin Wu would charge forward. Then, they would launch an all-out attack.</p>

  <p>Phoenix thought that as long as she attacked the Sky Net, all the powerful warriors in the seven mountains would be drawn out.</p>

  <p>She had commanded the Corpse Spirit Jin Wu to burn the Sky Net for quite a while now. However, the strong warriors in the seven mountains still did not take any action. It was only the Taiyi Guards and the Taiyi Generals stationed in the twelve passes that rushed out of the Sky Net and fought with the Jin Wu.</p>

  <p>After the blue flames had continued burning the Sky Net for five minutes, streaks of sword light shot into the sky from behind it.</p>

  <p>"Well, well. So you finally lose your cool?" Phoenix's mouth curled into a taunting smile.</p>

  <p>"Impressive!" she remarked as she observed the streaks of sword light.</p>

  <p>A hundred thousand feet long ray of sword radiance unfolded from afar. It seemed to be able to cut the sky in halves as it passed through the Sky Net without resistance. Moreover, it accurately slashed toward Phoenix's direction.</p>

  <p>Phoenix remained sitting upright on the back of a Corpse Spirit Sun Crow.</p>

  <p>It was as though she was merely sitting on a small boat that was moving with the tide. She gently swayed to the side to avoid the sword radiance.</p>

  <p>Just like Phoenix, the other Corpse Spirit Jin Wu hovering in front of her easily avoided the sword radiance. It seemed like they were not in the same space at all.</p>
