<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3904 The Strength Of The Statue </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The nearest cave on the plain was only a few hundred feet away. With a few strides, Geoffrey arrived in an instant and went in.</p>

  <p>The caves on the plain seemed to be empty, but each one had a very unique and terrifying interior.</p>

  <p>There was one which was filled with corrosive liquids, another containing poisonous gases floating within, and another one with a scorching hot interior as if a sun was stored in it.</p>

  <p>Closely behind, a statue was chasing after him at an incredible speed.</p>

  <p>Before he knew it, the statue was just about ten feet away from him.</p>

  <p>Without any hesitation, he jumped into the nearest cave, dragging Ziya along.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The statue's goal was to hunt down the intruders. Even after Geoffrey successfully left the pillar, the statue still chased after him and was determined to kill him.</p>

  <p>As Geoffrey and Ziya jumped in, the statue followed them.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>Thousands of light dots, like a torrential rain, drilled into the cave below.</p>

  <p>The two quickly turned into their normal forms, as they continued to fall into the cave.</p>

  <p>Ziya instantly analyzed their situation, quickly grabbed the rope around his waist, and pulled Geoffrey towards him.</p>

  <p>Just as he steadied himself, a whistling sound came from above. He saw that the statue stretched out its big hand and tried to grab his head.</p>

  <p>The statues on the pillars didn't possess extraordinary abilities. However, their bodies were extremely sturdy, and their movements were incredibly fast. With just brute strength and speed to rely on, they still couldn't be underestimated.</p>

  <p>Ziya knew that if the statue got a hold of his head, it would be crushed easily.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, he was a smart man. He never took his opponents lightly and was always alert at his surroundings.</p>

  <p>He instantly realized that the statue was not easy to deal with.</p>

  <p>With his quick reflexes, he drew his head back, and the statue missed.</p>

  <p>At the same time, he did not waste the opportunity for a counterattack. With a wave of his hand, a golden whip shadow shot towards the statue.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The moment the God Lashing Whip touched the statue, a deafening explosion resounded.</p>

  <p>It was so loud that Geoffrey couldn't help covering his ears as he shouted in pain. Blood started dripping to his fingers that were covering his ears.</p>

  <p>Ziya immediately saw Geoffrey's condition so he reached out his hand, grabbed him, and stuffed him into the space channel. Now, he could focus on dealing with the statue with no restraint. The power within his body quickly surged towards the God Lashing Whip.</p>

  <p>To his surprise, the statue managed to withstand his attack. Never had he seen such a solid statue before that couldn't be destroyed by his mighty whip.</p>

  <p>"Death to the invaders!"</p>

  <p>The statue regained its balance after being sent away with the impact caused by the God Lashing Whip. It rushed towards Ziya again, but what waited for it were endless whip shadows.</p>

  <p>Golden whip shadows drew an arc of tens of thousands of feet from left to right. They lashed the statue at lightning speed, creating space ripples in rapid succession.</p>

  <p>In just a few seconds, Ziya had cracked his whip for more than a thousand times.</p>

  <p>The statue's speed became useless in the face of Ziya's attacks. It could do nothing but rely on its sturdy body to withstand the strikes.</p>

  <p>Clap! Crack!</p>

  <p>The loud sound of whipping reverberated throughout the entire cave.</p>

  <p>The more Ziya attacked, the more he got surprised.</p>

  <p>He knew that the power of his whip was absolute.</p>

  <p>In the chaos, no matter how powerful his opponents were, there was no way that they could withstand such an astounding volume of attacks.</p>

  <p>The statue wasn't even a special being, but it could actually endure an allout attack for a long time.</p>

  <p>'What material is this statue made of?!' Ziya was getting impatient.</p>

  <p>Clap! Crack!</p>

  <p>Ziya continued his furious attacks. Soon, he noticed that the statue was already showing signs of collapse. Eventually, one of its arms got destroyed.</p>

  <p>Soon, the other arm, legs, torso, and the head were also torn apart by the golden whip shadows.</p>

  <p>Ziya was relieved as he defeated the seemingly indestructible statue. He then grabbed the air and released Geoffrey from the space channel. While he was treating Geoffrey's wounds, he asked with a serious expression, "Did that statue run down from one of the four pillars?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Geoffrey answered as he stared at the remains of the statue that were now nothing but scraps of metal. He knew that the statue was indeed powerful since Ziya took quite some time before he could destroy it.</p>

  <p>"Did it attack you as you climbed up the pillar?" Ziya asked. Since he was not aware of the passage of time in the Abstruse Energy World, he didn't know how long Geoffrey had stayed on the pillar.</p>

  <p>"Actually, no." Geoffrey shook his head while his brows were furrowed.</p>

  <p>"I'm thinking maybe it attacked because I moved something that I shouldn't," he continued.</p>

  <p>"Wait. What do you mean? What was on the pillar?" Ziya asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Then Geoffrey told him about the pages and the threads of light on the pillar.</p>

  <p>"What are you saying? The threads of light here are connected to the Other Shore?" Ziya was so shocked that his mouth remained wide open.</p>

  <p>There were actually several various theories about the Other Shore. One of the most popular ones was that its energy was flowing and coming from the Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>Right at this moment, Ziya finally confirmed this theory.</p>

  <p>There were a lot of things that entered his mind as he discovered this secret.</p>

  <p>He was kind of trembling and was pacing back and forth.</p>

  <p>With this discovery, it meant that all the powerful, sacred, and terrifying forces on the Other Shore actually relied on the four huge pillars.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, it seemed that the situation on the Other Shore of the other worlds was just the same.</p>

  <p>In Ziya's mind, he couldn't help but think that the four pillars might be the origin of everything.</p>

  <p>He was even more puzzled when he heard Geoffrey saying that the positions of the threads of light and the nature of the Other Shore Tokens could be changed at will.</p>

  <p>"I remember it clearly. The statue didn't make a move the first time I made changes, but when I did it for the second time, the statue chased after me. I guess there's more than one statue on the pillars," Geoffrey explained. He thought that he could just do whatever he wanted, but it turned out that it wasn't that simple.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing his sullen face, Ziya smiled and said, "You can go to the pillar again and lure the other statues down."</p>

  <p>Ziya clearly knew about the function of the four pillars, so he didn't want this opportunity to slip by.</p>

  <p>"You want me to lure them down? But what if I can't escape?" Geoffrey said in a trembling voice.</p>

  <p>The first statue was shabby, and its intellect wasn't so high. If Geoffrey encountered a statue that possessed a high level of intelligence, it might be difficult for him to escape.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry. Just deal with them the same way as you did with the first one." Ziya stretched out his hand, and the Truth of Three-Energy Construction began to operate. The rope that tied him and Geoffrey continued to lengthen.</p>

  <p>The plan was Ziya would stay behind while Geoffrey returned to the pillars.</p>

  <p>If something unexpected should happen, he could tell Ziya immediately through the rope so that he could pull him back instantly.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, on the Dark Haze Peak of the Li Shan mountain, a droplet of blood dripped from the wound on Luo Zheng's fingertip.</p>

  <p>The droplet of extremely thick ancestry-level blood fell into a clear pool.</p>

  <p>As it splashed into the water, the blood continued to sink without dispersing.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the droplet of blood stopped sinking, jumped out of the pool, and rushed back towards the wound on Luo Zheng's finger.</p>

  <p>Like a small red bug, Luo Zheng flicked the droplet back into the pool.</p>

  <p>It splashed into the pool again. This time, it wandered around the pool and sank into the bottom.</p>

  <p>Immediately after, the temperature within the entire pool rapidly rose.</p>

  <p>Due to intense heat, a thick white mist began springing up.</p>

  <p>Soon after, the clear water in the pool had completely evaporated.</p>
