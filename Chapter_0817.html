  <p>
</p>

  <p>Suspicions regarding the Tower of Sin clouded Luo Zheng's mind once again.</p>

  <p>Now he understood why the immortal Mist had told him that he couldn't go to the Tower of Sin. That was because Mist's strength far surpassed that of a warlord in this continent. According to the rule, he too would be cursed to dearth in this Cursed Land.</p>

  <p>The killing power of the Cursed Land had actually intimidated someone as powerful as the immoral Mist. It was unbelievable!</p>

  <p>Speaking of this, what was the connection between the Cursed Land and the Tower of Sin? Why would they appear on this continent? These were just some of the many questions Luo Luo Zheng had.</p>

  <p>"Actually, this is what the Tower of Sin is like. It has always been flipped upside down ever since it appeared. There's nothing strange about that!"</p>

  <p>Phoebe explained, "Actually, only a small part of the Tower of Sin is above the surface; most of it is buried deep beneath the ground." Phoebe smiled.</p>

  <p>How could anyone build a tower like that?</p>

  <p>It was a huge tower and it wasn't possible that it was built by digging a huge pit and then constructing floor by floor.</p>

  <p>Most probably, someone had grabbed the tower and inserted it deep into the ground by hand! Somehow, this strange thought suddenly popped into Luo Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>Of course Phoebe didn't know what was going on in Luo Zheng's mind. She only told him what he needed to know before entering the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>As they approached the Tower of Sin, they met more and more creatures.</p>

  <p>In fact, the Tower of Sin was surrounded by a small town. In the middle of the Sea God Continent, which was usually filled with battles and massacres, the small town appeared exceptionally serene. This was because the Cursed Land was a place where no one could fight and all kinds of races coexisted peacefully.</p>

  <p>Phoebe brought Luo Luo Zheng into the small town, and they soon found themselves in front of a building which belonged to humans.</p>

  <p>"Every race has a registration center where you have to go and get a token before you can enter the Tower of Sin," Phoebe told him. "This is the registration center for your human race."</p>

  <p>When he saw that several human cultivators were coming in and out of the building, Luo Luo Zheng walked in without hesitation.</p>

  <p>In the center of the lobby he had entered into, there was a huge table where a human cultivator was sitting by. According to the ranking of strengths in the Central Region, this human cultivator would have been classified as an Internal Elixir Realm warrior. But in the Sea God Continent, he was known as a war general.</p>

  <p>When the human war general saw Luo Luo Zheng, he smiled scornfully. "Don't tell me a human war fighter of the seventh level wants to enter the Tower of Sin as well!"</p>

  <p>"What's the problem with that?" Luo Luo Zheng asked with a frown.</p>

  <p>"I admire people with great courage. But believe me, what you are doing right now is the same as courting death. Even if you're a genius from the Purple Heart Sacred Place, you will only end up dead if you enter the Tower of Sin," the human war general calmly replied.</p>

  <p>The human race had two major advantages in terms of cultivation. Firstly, they were great in number; and secondly, their capabilities were more suitable for cultivating life vitality system, which was bestowed upon them by nature.</p>

  <p>However, on the Sea God Continent, these two advantages of humans did not do them any good.</p>

  <p>In the Central Region and the four divine kingdoms, there was an abundance of resources, which were almost inexhaustible and always available for use. The great number of humans in those areas had helped them to make full use of these resources and achieve higher rankings.</p>

  <p>However strong you were, there was always someone stronger and more gifted than everyone else, and there was always an abundance of resources for these talents to use and grow.</p>

  <p>However, the resources of the Sea God Continent were extremely scarce. In such a situation, the huge number of humans was no longer an advantage.</p>

  <p>What was more, before becoming a war sage, almost all the masters of the Sea God Continent were dependent on the resources they got from the Tower of Sin to grow stronger.</p>

  <p>In the Tower of Sin, only the power of the individual really mattered.</p>

  <p>Compared to the Demon Night, the demons, the ogres, and all other races too, humans did not have any advantage. Because of this, very few humans could enter the Tower of Sin, which made it even more difficult for the young generation of humans to stand out and achieve more. This also resulted in their currently low status in the Sea God Continent.</p>

  <p>Although the Purple Heart Sacred Place was known as a sacred place, it was still much weaker than the sacred places of other races.</p>

  <p>"I must enter the Tower of Sin," Luo Luo Zheng replied firmly without any extra words for explanation.</p>

  <p>The human war general nodded and said no more. He helped Luo Luo Zheng complete the registration and then threw a steel token to him. "Then? Good luck."</p>

  <p>Since he had failed to talk Luo Luo Zheng out of the deadly adventure, he could only wish him good luck with a smile, showing much pity for him. From his point of view, a guy like Luo Luo Zheng who didn't know where he stood in this world wouldn't survive even the first night in the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>"Did you get the token?" Phoebe immediately went up to him and asked as soon as she saw him walk out of the gate.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng waved the token in front of her eyes and said: "Here it is. Let's go!"</p>

  <p>There were also a few marketplaces and auction houses within this small town. However, Luo Luo Zheng was not interested in them. After traveling through the small town for a while, they finally arrived at the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng could see the enormous tower from afar. When he got near it and looked at the gigantic tower, he felt overwhelmed.</p>

  <p>Since the Tower of Sin was upside down, someone had built a staircase right next to it. After going up the stairs, two tall and sturdy giants stopped Luo Luo Zheng and Phoebe.</p>

  <p>These giants were more than twice the size of ogres and were at least sixty feet tall. If they were humans, then it was clearly visible that both of them probably had innate superhuman strength.</p>

  <p>"Show me your token," one of the giants ordered in a muffled voice Luo Luo Zheng and Phoebe took out their tokens at the same time. Luo Luo Zheng noticed that Phoebe's token was completely different from his own. There seemed to be a purple and gold layer on its surface.</p>

  <p>"Phoebe, why is your token different from mine?" Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"The token for each floor of the Tower of Sin is different. The token in your hand is for the first floor. If you have the qualifications to enter the next floor, you will need to change it. You will know about it once you enter,"</p>

  <p>Phoebe smiled as she replied.</p>

  <p>After checking their tokens, the two giants pushed open the huge doors for them. Luo Luo Zheng finally stepped into the first floor of the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>His very first step inside made him feel as though he had entered a huge palace. They first had to travel through a long and narrow corridor, and then suddenly, a gigantic platform appeared in front of them. On the platform, two creatures were engaged in a fierce battle, fighting desperately to death.</p>

  <p>The battle between them was rapidly increasing in intensity, each one trying to kill the other.</p>

  <p>The platform itself was surrounded by spectators. Most of the creatures here were war fighters like Luo Luo Zheng, and the fighters on the platform were also war fighters by the standards of the Sea God Continent.</p>

  <p>"Is it allowed to fight in the Tower of Sin?" Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Phoebe nodded, "Yes. To put it more precisely, it is allowed to fight inside the arena of the Tower of Sin! Actually... It would be more accurate to say that this is a place for battles rather than a place for cultivation. It is actually a microcosm of the various races of the Sea God Continent! All the cultivation resources are obtained through battles. Only the most powerful warriors who can live through the Tower of Sin and grow stronger can be counted as true masters!"</p>

  <p>"These guys are only war fighters. Why is it so that the human registration officer kept telling me not to enter the Tower of Sin?" Luo Luo Zheng could clearly see that the majority of cultivators, including the ones in the arena and those among the spectators were war fighters, and none of them was a war general.</p>

  <p>"That's because you're a human," Phoebe giggled. "This is very common in this place. Human war fighters and war generals are usually weaker. Back when I entered the Tower of Sin for the first time, I was a war fighter too.</p>

  <p>But no one ever told me not to enter the Tower of Sin!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes revealed surprise. Were humans so weak in this godforsaken place?</p>

  <p>The battle on the arena was finally winding down.</p>

  <p>It was a battle between an ogre and a short but very robust orc.</p>

  <p>Both of these creatures had cultivated the body refining method. When their forceful energies burst out, they crashed head-on! With every collision, the audience would erupt in shouts and cries. The eyes of the two creatures in the arena were bloodshot with a determination to kill. They were using a completely barbaric way to fight, a hand-to-hand combat!</p>

  <p>In the end, the ogre war fighter finally gained an upper hand and with a fierce strike of his elbow, he knocked the orc unconscious. Then he grabbed his enemy's body and tore off his head with pure, brute force.</p>

  <p>Blood spurted out like a fountain and got splashed all over on the arena.</p>

  <p>The audience seemed to have gotten used to such bloody scenes and in fact, it seemed to make them even more excited. "Borgan! Borgan! Borgan!"</p>

  <p>Borgan was probably the name of that ogre war fighter. He casually waved the head of the orc in his hand and roared, "Who else dares to challenge me!? Challenge our ogre race! You load of trash of low races!"</p>

  <p>His words provoked an uproar from the audience. On one hand there were cheers from the ogre race, and from the other side came angry curses of other races.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng wasn't too bothered about such provocations. However, he did notice that the blood stains on the arena soon disappeared. What was going on?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stared at the arena with a puzzled glance.</p>
