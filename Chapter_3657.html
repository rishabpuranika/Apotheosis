<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3657 Defeat The Vastness Mountain </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Soon enough, the Other Shore Treasure that protected Gethin's body was shattered and he could only resist attacks with his physical body.</p>

  <p>He did have strong Chaotic Source Spirits inside his body, but the force he could bear was limited.</p>

  <p>In desperation, he intended to burn his Other Shore Token to attack, but given the current situation, he eventually gave up.</p>

  <p>Perhaps he could still put up a fight, but he still wouldn't be able to evade death and had to bear the indescribable pain.</p>

  <p>He never actually thought that he would pass away during the war between the two great races, the Jin Wu and the human race.</p>

  <p>Even if he didn't burn the Other Shore Token, one of his subordinates did.</p>

  <p>The one who did so was Holden, the old man who took Luo Zheng away from the Taiyi Mountain before. His own Other Shore Token was a golden monkey.</p>

  <p>It was known that anyone who burned the Other Shore Token would receive the punishment of the truth, which was extremely painful.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, it wasn't only the violator of the rule who would suffer? but the Other Shore Token as well.</p>

  <p>It wouldn't have been a problem if the Other Shore Token was lifeless, but Holden's golden monkey was still alive.</p>

  <p>A loud, ear-splitting scream filled the air as the golden monkey burned hotly. A second later, its body grew to the size of a huge mountain and swallowed Holden in whole.</p>

  <p>That Other Shore Token had just killed its master!</p>

  <p>The furious golden monkey continued to burn and tried to tear everything around it apart.</p>

  <p>If there had been ordinary masters around the area, the golden monkey would've killed them.</p>

  <p>Luckily, those who were present were by no means ordinary.</p>

  <p>For instance, both Pearce and Micah were second only to those most powerful warriors.</p>

  <p>Although the golden monkey was quite powerful, it was still under the control of several people. In the end it burned to death and left only a smoky smell, and finally it disappeared in the sky.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! "This thing from the Other Shore is really horrible after it descends!" Pearce said after they got rid of the golden monkey.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, who was not far away, heard Pearce's words and his heart skipped a beat. "Elder Pearce, the Other Shore Token has been burnt. Why did you say that it descended?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Pearce looked at him and explained, "The true essence of burning the Other Shore Token is to make it descend.</p>

  <p>The constant burning is just an appearance." "Is it because the truth rule is triggered?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Exactly," Pearce answered and glanced at Luo Zheng. Then he realized that the younger warrior knew as much as he did.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng simply nodded.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore was indeed a level higher than the chaos from a certain point of view. At the very least, the flowers and plants that lived on it had powerful energy. Even the sand in Stage One contained one divine megaton of force, which was way more than those in the Source World and the chaos.</p>

  <p>Five minutes later, Gethin, the ruler of the Vastness Mountain, died.</p>

  <p>Two leaders of the intelligence agency were defeated and died as well.</p>

  <p>In the end, only Barnaby and the other three masters from the Vastness Mountain were left.</p>

  <p>One of the strong cultivators of the Azure Mountain used the chain that his Other Shore Token had formed to tie up Barnaby and the three masters.</p>

  <p>Finally, their fates rested in the hands of the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>Barnaby passed by Luo Zheng and looked at him with dull eyes. After all, he still couldn't come to his senses from the huge change.</p>

  <p>Regret was evident in his face.</p>

  <p>Although he hadn't figured out why, he had clearly heard that the members of the Jin Wu followed Luo Zheng's orders.</p>

  <p>It was because of Luo Zheng that the Vastness Mountain had ended up like this! "I should've killed you at that time?" Barnaby hissed.</p>

  <p>Back when Holden had brought Luo Zheng into the Vastness Mountain, he didn't know how to deal with Luo Zheng. Therefore, he ended up asking Barnaby for help. They didn't obtain the Truth Enlightenment, because Concubine Yan and Ying soon found out what happened.</p>

  <p>If Barnaby had already killed Luo Zheng, there wouldn't have been so much trouble.</p>

  <p>Despite Barnaby's hateful stare, Luo Zheng only flashed a small smile. Then, Barnaby was taken away.</p>

  <p>"Gethin asked for the moon. If it wasn't for Luo Zheng, he could've easily broken my array with the help of the Jin Wu. Furthermore, he could've broken the other mountains' arrays one by one," said the leader of the Azure Mountain.</p>

  <p>"That's for sure," Qiu Yinhe said, smiling at Luo Zheng with satisfaction.</p>

  <p>Even he himself couldn't believe that Luo Zheng could turn the tables on his own.</p>

  <p>"What should we do next?" the leader of the Azure Mountain asked as he looked at Phoenix and her clansmen. An idea suddenly popped up in his mind. Could Luo Zheng control all the members of the Jin Wu?</p>

  <p>"Hurry up to the next array," Luo Zheng answered.</p>

  <p>Of course, everyone knew his intentions.</p>

  <p>Phoenix pursed her lips. It was clear that she was unwilling. She wasn't convinced as Luo Zheng had controlled her for some reason.</p>

  <p>Then came the Bright Array, the Golden Array, and the Ivory Array...</p>

  <p>As more and more members of the Jin Wu followed behind Luo Zheng, it became easier to deal with the remaining members that put up a struggle in their deathbed. Now, Luo Zheng's team had the absolute advantage since they were large in number.</p>

  <p>While Luo Zheng subdued the members of the Jin Wu, Pearce, Qiu Yinhe, and even Li Bianxue secretly observed him.</p>

  <p>It wasn't long before they discovered some rules.</p>

  <p>It seemed that in order to control the members of the Jin Wu, blood was needed. Those who had been controlled by Luo Zheng all had such kind of blood.</p>

  <p>However, they were still confused about Emperor Di Jun's shadow, which suddenly appeared above Luo Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>Was that really Emperor Di Jun?</p>

  <p>If so, why would he help Luo Zheng?</p>

  <p>If not, why could he control the members of the Jin Wu?</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, they were overjoyed.</p>

  <p>The Taiyi Heaven Palace had a difficult time in the battle, but they won in the end.</p>

  <p>The moment they arrived at the Ivory Array, Luo Zheng had already subdued more than eighty warriors of the Jin Wu. They were originally their race's main fighting forces.</p>

  <p>Beside the Ivory Array was Springer, who led about eight members of the Jin Wu to fight.</p>

  <p>Yet, his plans were suddenly cut off when he saw Phoenix and the other members of the Jin Wu who stood on his opposite side. He couldn't believe his eyes.</p>

  <p>Phoenix stepped forward and persuaded him to surrender.</p>

  <p>Everyone in the Jin Wu knew that Springer had always refused to obey Phoenix.</p>

  <p>He refused to surrender from the start. No matter how many opponents he faced, he could hold on for a long time as long as he had the Inheritance of World.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Luo Zheng asked Emperor Di Jun to personally persuade him to surrender.</p>

  <p>Although Springer and the other members of the Jin Wu hadn't been injected with the blood yet, they began to doubt their own position as soon as they saw Emperor Di Jun. After all, eighty percent of their warriors, including Phoenix, Bagot, and Micah, had already surrendered to him.</p>

  <p>After a few moments of hesitation, Springer let out a helpless sigh. He gathered the remaining clansmen to surrender and let Phoenix infuse her blood into his body.</p>

  <p>Just when he was about to retrieve the world that he summoned, he looked towards the southeast with an unreadable expression.</p>

  <p>"Eh, these Fickle Demons..."</p>

  <p>The world that he summoned had a range of three million miles, and there were some Fickle Demons that loitered around in it.</p>

  <p>Most of the Fickle Demons were quite weak, and only a few of them in the east had grown to the size of a small mountain.</p>
