<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2609 Consideration </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The figure in black replied, "It's very simple. You only have to kill two people."</p>

  <p>"You mean the siblings?" Spark asked, the corners of his mouth lifting.</p>

  <p>"Yes," the figure in black said, nodding.</p>

  <p>The Yellow Emperor race had an information system that was much more advanced than those of other races. That was how Spark knew about what went on within the Snake Goddess race and the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>What was more, the Snake Goddess race and the Nine Li race didn't hide what they were doing, which made it easy for him to find information.</p>

  <p>Spark looked at the black figure in front of him with great interest and said, "So you really are scared. I can tell that the siblings are very important, so you have no choice but to kill them."</p>

  <p>After a short silence, the black figure answered, "Yes."</p>

  <p>The exiles were very intelligent. They often only needed a few details to see the truth. It was difficult to deceive them.</p>

  <p>So the figure in black had no choice but to admit the truth.</p>

  <p>Spark's lips curled. "I'm afraid this price is too high for me. After all, the Snake Goddess race and the Nine Li race are trying their best to protect the siblings. It's going to be very difficult to kill them. The Nine Li race may be displeased if I choose to join them, but I can still do that if I pay a certain price," he said as he stared at the figure.</p>

  <p>Although he couldn't see the expression on the figure's face, he could guess what he was thinking.</p>

  <p>"You are indeed qualified to join them. But if you do so, it will still be impossible for you to leave this world," the figure said. "I know you're testing me, but I'm telling you that even if they find us through the siblings and try to cut off the Curse Chains, we'll destroy this world. And then, none of you will survive, even if you hide inside the bone towers."</p>

  <p>Spark's eyebrows went up at this.</p>

  <p>He was trying to gauge whether the black figure was telling the truth or lying.</p>

  <p>He would absolutely not join the Snake Goddess race if the Warden race was capable of doing this. He didn't want to die with that group of people!</p>

  <p>But if it turned out to be a lie...</p>

  <p>This was a hard choice!</p>

  <p>Then again, any choice he made would be easier than leaving this world.</p>

  <p>Sensing Spark's hesitation, the figure in black continued, "We will help you if you agree to help us. Moreover, I believe there are many exiles, besides us, who are willing to follow you."</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess race had only invited the larger, higher ranked races.</p>

  <p>But there existed a number of lower ranked, smaller races in addition to these. Although the smaller races weren't that powerful, they had a lot of exiles, and they could be a strong force if they were to come together and cooperate.</p>

  <p>Besides, the Warden race would stand behind them.</p>

  <p>The Warden race would probably choose not to directly participate in the battle. But the world was under their control and they would definitely be of great help.</p>

  <p>Spark hesitated for a long time before answering firmly, a glimmer of determination in his eyes, "Okay, I agree."</p>

  <p>He wouldn't have hesitated if he were facing just the Nine Li race. But since they had allied themselves with the Snake Goddess race and other races, he was being prudent.</p>

  <p>It was a great chance and he had to seize it.</p>

  <p>The Warden race was persuading exiles in other bone towers and hidden places of this world.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, the Warden race had found it difficult to persuade them. After all, no one dared fight against the top ranked large races.</p>

  <p>That was why the exiles were ambiguous in their responses. They wanted to join the Snake Goddess race, and that was the only option they could see in that moment.</p>

  <p>But since the Yellow Emperor race had agreed, exiles with relatively weaker strength had responded quickly. After all, the Yellow Emperor race would take the lead, and they were okay with following.</p>

  <p>In the Snake Goddess race...</p>

  <p>At the center of the large square that was supported by six edges, the bands of pale red light intertwined to form a complex pattern.</p>

  <p>Luther was hanging upside down at the center of this pattern, his eyes closed.</p>

  <p>Above him loomed a huge shadow of Snake Goddess, holding him in its hands.</p>

  <p>Emily and Timotheus had come to an agreement.</p>

  <p>They had set the time to two years in the future, which was when the Light of Adjudication would arrive.</p>

  <p>Emily was responsible for forging Luther's inner world and enhancing his strength.</p>

  <p>And she had to do it before that time came!</p>

  <p>As the huge shadow of Snake Goddess began to glow, a strong energy gathered in Luther's belly.</p>

  <p>The energy was so violent that if a fragile belly were to remain under its impact, it would, sooner or later, be torn to pieces.</p>

  <p>Luther was calm, his eyes closed. But as the energy was throbbing through him, his eyes flew open and his handsome face contorted with pain. His hands flailed around.</p>

  <p>Emily looked at Luther approvingly. Luther's talent was much better than she had imagined.</p>

  <p>"Luther!"</p>

  <p>Zelda was worried about her brother.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry. Nothing will happen to him with Master Emily here," a Wild God from the Snake Goddess race comforted Zelda.</p>

  <p>"But general cultivation methods aren't so painful," Zelda said, frowning.</p>

  <p>The people of the Warden race also cultivated the True God system.</p>

  <p>Back then, Zelda hadn't had a chance to cultivate it, but from what she had heard and seen, she knew that it wouldn't be painful to create the Soul Sea.</p>

  <p>"Because there is not enough time," the Wild God said, eyes flickering.</p>

  <p>She stared admiringly at Luther. "Master Emily directly helps Luther establish a world, so he will naturally feel a lot of pain. It's a welcome opportunity for many core disciples in our race."</p>

  <p>The Wild Gods of the Snake Goddess race rarely received such treatment. Many of them were now looking at Luther with blatant envy.</p>

  <p>Zelda was relieved at the Wild God's words.</p>

  <p>The Wild God continued, "Master Emily has told me that I can transplant the blood of our race into you if you want. I can also give you wild bones and blood wild bones, so you can cultivate well during this time."</p>

  <p>"Transplant the blood of your race into me?" Zelda was surprised.</p>

  <p>She had lived in the Immemorial Wilderness, so she knew how precious the blood was.</p>

  <p>One blood wild bone alone could be used in exchange for numerous resources, many of which were unimaginable. But one must have the corresponding blood to devour the blood wild bones.</p>

  <p>Blood was naturally rarer than blood wild bones. What was more, she could now get the blood of the Snake Goddess race, the most powerful blood in this world!</p>

  <p>Despite this, she still refused after careful consideration.</p>

  <p>She wanted to become stronger, and although her free faction had betrayed the Warden race, she still needed to preserve her own blood.</p>

  <p>But since the Snake Goddess race was offering her a massive amount of wild bones, she wouldn't refuse the offer.</p>
