  <p>
</p>

  <p>Feng Ge didn't want to see these abominable monsters at all.</p>

  <p>There were more than one iron cage on the wall. As the ball of light on her fingertips exploded, another blazing white light shot forward and illuminated another iron cage.</p>

  <p>A snake-like creature was locked in the second cage. It had a terrifyingly strange face on its head.</p>

  <p>When the light shone on the cage, the snake screamed and ran around frantically in the cage. It made strange noises that sounded like sizzling screams. Then at last, it was completely annihilated under the inescapable blinding light.</p>

  <p>Seeing how the two creatures ended, the monsters in the other cages suddenly jumped up and down in the cages.</p>

  <p>They had been locked here in the cages for quite a long time. But even if that was the case, it was better to be a living dog than a dead lion. In the end, they didn't want to be completely destroyed by the light.</p>

  <p>For a moment, all kinds of weird and horrifying shrieks could be heard from the iron cages.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge didn't show any signs of mercy at all. With a flash of light in her hand, she was about to eliminate the monsters in the iron cages one by one.</p>

  <p>At this time, Luo Zheng quickly reached out his hand and stopped her.</p>

  <p>"Listen to me, don't kill them now," Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>"But they..." Feng Ge frowned in confusion.</p>

  <p>"Only the first monster had attacked us. These other monsters are not attacking us, and they are locked in cages," Luo Zheng said seriously.</p>

  <p>These monsters weren't hostile to them at all. Moreover, if they wanted to really know more about this iron house, then they would probably need to start with these monsters.</p>

  <p>Under Luo Zheng's persuasion, Feng Ge decided to stop what she was about to do.</p>

  <p>With her personality, she would never show mercy or listen to others.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng's words really persuaded her. She then showed a sweet and understanding smile and asked, "Then what should we do next?"</p>

  <p>"Let's go inside first and have a look," Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>She didn't know if these monsters were intelligent or not, but she thought it would be best if they could somehow communicate with her.</p>

  <p>She released two rays of light to cover the both of them, then they stepped into the darkness.</p>

  <p>Because of the Dark Region's characteristics, even if he was very near something, he still could not see it. So, Luo Zheng couldn't see the situation of the cage that he was approaching.</p>

  <p>After thinking about their situation for a while, Luo Zheng suddenly said, "Take out the Darkness Fruits."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's physical body was unable to carry the Sumeru Space. So the last time he left the Dark Region, he had asked Feng Ge to keep the candles and the Darkness Fruits.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge took out two Darkness Fruits and each of them swallowed one.</p>

  <p>Then, the darkness in front of them slowly faded away. Although their surroundings were still filled with darkness, Luo Zheng was able to clearly see in the dark without the help of Feng Ge's light.</p>

  <p>The iron cage in front of Luo Zheng had a palm sized lizard locked inside. It curled up at the farthest side of the cage, trembling with fear.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng tried to communicate with the lizard, but the little creature was obviously clueless. It didn't respond to Luo Zheng at all.</p>

  <p>He gave up on the lizard and walked to the next cage.</p>

  <p>The monster in the next cage was even stranger. It just looked like a plain purple cube. Its body seemed sticky and it stayed motionless at the center of the cage.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng approached, the "cube" suddenly trembled. Then, two big round eyes popped at the center of the cube and stared at him curiously.</p>

  <p>When he saw this, Luo Zheng asked, "You... Can you speak at all?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did not expect this "cube" to speak like humans, but he hoped that it could give at least a meaningful response.</p>

  <p>But at the next moment, the reaction made by the cube exceeded Luo Zheng's expectations.</p>

  <p>The sticky cube suddenly dissolved and gradually turned into a pool of mucus. The pool of mucus was constantly rising and it seemed like it was forming itself into a figure. Finally, it turned into a human shape, complete with a nose, two eyes, a mouth, and a body...</p>

  <p>Soon, a person who looked exactly like Luo Zheng appeared in the cage.</p>

  <p>"What? This thing, it can turn into human shape..." Feng Ge stared at the Luo Zheng in the cage with a strange and curious look.</p>

  <p>"Kof, kof, kof..."</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the thing in the cage coughed a few times and took a few short breaths. After adapting to its new form, it finally opened its mouth and said,</p>

  <p>"I, I can turn into any creature..."</p>

  <p>When he heard this, Luo Zheng raised his eyebrows suddenly and asked, "You know human language?"</p>

  <p>"Of course." After the thing adapted to its new body, it spoke more fluently and naturally. It sounded like it was nothing different from an ordinary human being. "This is the talent of Shape-shifting Spirits. We can imitate the language of countless races, including the human race."</p>

  <p>"Well, I think it's a great thing that we can communicate. Do tell us, what is this place?" Feng Ge asked, as she stared into the iron cage. Her fingertips began to flash white light again. Her face looked intimidating.</p>

  <p>The "Luo Zheng" in the cage seemed to be instinctively afraid of the Great Sanskrit Light. It subconsciously took a step back away from the light. With a terrified look, it said, "I'm just a pet. Please don't kill me!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stopped Feng Ge again, shaking his head. Then he said, "We came here by accident. Could you tell us where we are?"</p>

  <p>The "Luo Zheng" in the cage breathed a sigh of relief and replied, "You'd better leave now. This is the Bleak Center, and my master might come back at any moment. Although I don't know how you got here in the first place, I am sure that you will die if my master finds out!"</p>

  <p>"Bleak Center?" Luo Zheng's eyes narrowed slightly when he learned this new information. "How long has it been since your master left?"</p>

  <p>"It's been more than ten thousand years," said the "Luo Zheng" in the cage seriously.</p>

  <p>Over ten thousand years was only a short period of time for the Other Shore creatures that were easily able to live through several chaotic eras.</p>

  <p>However, the master of this place hadn't returned for ten thousand years.</p>

  <p>How could he possibly return now, at this exact moment?</p>

  <p>When he heard this, Luo Zheng quickly relaxed. He continued to ask, "What kind of place is this Bleak Center? What is it used for? And who is your master?"</p>

  <p>The "Luo Zheng" in the cage looked a little hesitant. It seemed to be very cowardly, especially after it saw the Dark Region creatures in the previous cages die under the blinding light. It was frightened by the two humans in front of it, especially by Feng Ge who stood next to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Tell us at once!" Feng Ge commanded fiercely and directly.</p>

  <p>The other "Luo Zheng" glanced at the light that was shining in Feng Ge's hand and said, "The Bleak Center is the place to build the passageway to the Desire World. My master is only a guard and he has been guarding here for many years. But in the last tens of thousands of years, he often went out and left us. This is all I know."</p>

  <p>The monsters in the cages were nothing more than pets that gave the master company and pleasure while he was guarding this place. Naturally, they didn't know too much.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng still got a piece of important information from its words. The passage to the Desire World was not formed naturally, but it was built by this iron house!</p>

  <p>In theory, it was the Instant Civilization that had created the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Every stage and every passageway, including the energy vortex and the Star Doors, should be created by the Instant Civilization. Luo Zheng wondered if the master of the iron house was one of the members of the Instant Civilization.</p>
