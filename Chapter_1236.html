<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"I see. That's how it is," Luo Zheng said as he nodded.</p>

  <p>At that exact time, a massive flame suddenly blazed up in the sky. The sudden explosion was shaped like a volcano, and the heat waves it emitted scorched the plants in the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>They weren't the only things affected by the blaze, however. Even the war sages weren't able to withstand the heat that was coming from the flames. Every one of them hid behind something, hoping to be spared by the fire's power.</p>

  <p>As the flame spread out, an ogre slowly arose from it. On the ogre's head was a three-pronged crown. He was wearing a golden armor and was holding a dark golden ghost staff in his hand. To say that he looked magnificent would be an understatement.</p>

  <p>A blue-clothed woman was who he was after. Her slender body was enveloped in a light blue Water Pattern Domain, blocking all of the flames outside its protection. However, no matter how hard she tried, she just could not get rid of the ogre chasing after her.</p>

  <p>"Lacey..." Seeing this, Esther became worried.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had met Lacey before. She was a Soul Sea Realm expert from Demon Night.</p>

  <p>The Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place had occupied the Tower of Sin for the longest time as they had three Soul Sea Realm experts more than the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place. That advantage, however, was easily cancelled by Amber, as she was more than a match for three or four ogres at the Soul Sea Realm. With her being able to easily overpower them, the two sides had been able to maintain a delicate balance.</p>

  <p>Lacey, on the other hand, was obviously not as lucky as her. Right now, she was being suppressed by the ogre at the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>Esther and all the other Demon Night war sages who were in the middle of a fierce battle with the ogre war sages, had dejected looks on their faces the moment the scene unfurled in front of their eyes. It greatly undermined their morale.</p>

  <p>"Lacey, Lacey, Lacey," the ogre said, chuckling, "the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place is destined to be removed from the Sea God Continent, so there's no point resisting. All of you are beautiful— you can just be us ogres' concubines. That's way better than being killed. Am I right?"</p>

  <p>Amidst all this shaming, Lacey remained calm and the Water Pattern Domain around her stayed sturdy. "Even if you successfully destroy the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place, the moment Amber returns, you ogres will sure pay a heavy price," she said coldly. "Lamar, do you really think Amber will let you off?"</p>

  <p>Amber was looked up to in the Sea God Continent as much as Luo Zheng was idolized in the Central Region. Both were considered the strongest warriors of their respective areas. With that, everyone knew that as long as Amber had the chance, she would not hesitate to kill all the Soul Sea Realm experts of the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place.</p>

  <p id="top_10">Lacey's threat, however, didn't scare Lamar one bit. Instead, he laughed even more arrogantly. "Amber? Do you really think that she's going to come back here and save your sorry ass?" he said, sneering. "I know that she went to the Hundred-mile Island to undergo tribulation! Did you really think you could keep it secret from us?"</p>

  <p>Hearing these words, Lacey was evidently taken aback.</p>

  <p>Indeed, Amber quietly left for the Hundred-mile Island in order to undergo her tribulation. Only a few members of the Demon Night knew about this, so how did Lamar know? 'Who told him?' she thought.</p>

  <p>As she was sure that no member of the Demon Night would betray the sect, this only meant that the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place had been tracking Amber's activities for some time now. To martial artists, undergoing tribulation was extremely dangerous— they could not be disturbed at all as they were in their most vulnerable states. If the ogres had known of Amber's whereabouts, she might be in grave danger now.</p>

  <p>"You..." Lacey's expression began to darken. The Water Pattern Domain she put around herself as a protective barrier began to move erratically.</p>

  <p>Amber was the only hope of the Demon Night. If she died, the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place would not stand a chance against the ogres, and would lose all its chance to be able to be rebuilt.</p>

  <p>Amused by the reaction he was able to solicit from Lacey, Lamar continued his verbal attack. "Do you think that the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place was the only one taking action? Uh-oh little missy, you're mistaken! The people from the Dread Ogre Sacred Place have already been going after Amber for a long time. Haha! I have already told Harlow to keep Amber's severed head and soak it in the ogres' secret medicine. With her beauty, she could be the perfect ornament for the Flaming Ogre Palace!"</p>

  <p>As they were talking, six war sages of the Demon Night were killed by the ogres. Waves of mournful cries resounded throughout the entire Heavenly Feather Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>Lamar became fired up as he saw how gallant the ogre war sages had been. His eyes were burning with passion as he stared at Lacey.</p>

  <p>Chuckling, he said, "If you don't surrender, I will cut off your head and place it in my bedroom!"</p>

  <p>With that, he wielded the ghost staff in his hand and charged at Lacey once again. The raging flames on his body became even more intense.</p>

  <p>The Water Pattern Domain around Lacey's body, on the other hand, became increasingly unstable as this happened. It seemed like she was going to be defeated.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Luo Zheng took out his dark golden longbow and three black arrows from his space ring.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng!" Esther called immediately in an attempt to stop him from doing whatever he was planning to do.</p>

  <p>While Luo Zheng was an undoubtedly powerful being, Esther didn't think that he had a chance of defeating a powerful warrior at the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>To rashly attack someone with that kind of level was suicide.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng's expression told her that he would not back down. Soon, he already had the three black arrows notched on his longbow.</p>

  <p>Buzz, buzz, buzz...</p>

  <p>The bowstring began to hum softly.</p>

  <p>Afterwards, Luo Zheng launched the three black arrows into the air. They all turned into three streaks of black light, all coming towards Lamar at an incredibly fast speed.</p>

  <p>Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh!</p>

  <p>At first, the three flying arrows weren't easily noticeable. After all, the entire sky above the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place was a complete mess, and the three black rays of light did not particularly stand out.</p>

  <p>Because of that, Lamar did not notice the three arrows rapidly approaching him. He continued running towards Lacey with a crazed smile. "It's useless to resist!" he roared. "We ogres are destined to trample on all the other races in the entire Sea God Continent! Give u-"</p>

  <p>But before he could even finish what he was trying to say, he heard three extremely loud cracks.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>Puzzled, he turned his head to look for their source. As he did so, he heard another three cracks.</p>

  <p>The sound came from the arrows as they accelerated through the air. At that point, they were already coming towards Lamar faster than the speed of light.</p>

  <p>"What are those?" Lamar asked, confused and stunned, as he felt the speed and power of the three black lights coming towards him. Terror suddenly took a hold of him.</p>

  <p>Lacey, who was struggling to hold on to her protective barrier, also noticed the three black lights that were fast approaching. Her eyes were suddenly filled with surprise and uncertainty. Quickly, she traced where the black lights came from and saw a young human.</p>

  <p>'Luo Zheng! Why is he here?' she thought, confused.</p>

  <p>The three black lights were coming on so fast that Lamar gave up the idea of dodging them. 'I'll take this head on!' he thought, preparing for the impact. His bronze-colored arm, which was as thick as a human torso, swung the giant ghost staff, which was as big as a tree trunk. He violently smashed it towards the three black arrows.</p>

  <p>The ogres were indeed powerful, but the development of civilization in the Sea God Continent was far inferior to that of the Divine Kingdom Continent. It was even slower than that of the Central Region. The ogres could, at most, refine a mid-grade sacred weapon. On the other hand, weapon refiners from the four divine kingdoms could even make divine weapons. Of course, refining a divine weapon usually required help from the Upper World. Without the Reverse Spirit Channel, the four divine kingdoms wouldn't have the ability to forge those kinds of weapons.</p>

  <p>Thus, the ghost staff in Lamar's hand was only a top-grade sacred weapon.</p>

  <p>While Lamar was swinging his ghost staff at the three black arrows, trying to prevent them from hitting him, he heard three muffled sounds.</p>

  <p>Then, out of the blue, the three sharp arrows pierced his body.</p>

  <p>Lamar never underestimated the power of the three black arrows. The moment he saw them, he immediately dropped his attack on Lacey, and instead, focused all his energy on blocking them.</p>

  <p>However, the moment the black arrows penetrated his ghost staff, he realized that despite all the precautions he made, he still severely underestimated their power.</p>
