  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was a powerful warrior at the Other Shore Realm. Even if he was poisoned, he could cut off his arm for survival.</p>

  <p>But the deadly poison of the fierce ant could take all the lives in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>A member of the Celestial Wolf race was bitten by one of those ants. He died instantly. There was no chance to treat the wound or slow the poison.</p>

  <p>When Chaim and the others saw that, they were scared out of their wits.</p>

  <p>None of them was willing to risk death to rescue Luo Zheng. He was done for.</p>

  <p>But while everyone watched, Luo Zheng wrenched the jaws of the giant ant away from his arm. Then, he shifted his grip and grabbed the creature's head.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng's squeeze wasn't enough to crack its hard shell. It could withstand three hundred Jun of force.</p>

  <p>"Hey..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled helplessly, and squeezed harder with five hundred Jun of force.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The young warrior managed to crush the ant.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng smashed his foe to smithereens, the other ants hovering around the scene became even more manic. They dived at Luo Zheng at breakneck speed.</p>

  <p>Chaim, Sally, and the members of the other races all stared at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Some of them were silently counting down the seconds, making bets on how long Luo Zheng would last. He'd been bitten, after all.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng didn't seem to be suffering any ill effects. It almost like he hadn't been poisoned by that bite.</p>

  <p>His figure was still as ethereal as usual, shuttling freely to and fro, fending off the siege of those fierce flying ants.</p>

  <p>Seizing the moment, Luo Zheng stretched out his arms and caught an ant. He shredded it and watched the pieces drop to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Is, is he really poisoned?"</p>

  <p>"Did we make a mistake just now?"</p>

  <p>"He doesn't seem to be any weaker."</p>

  <p>The warriors stared at Luo Zheng intently, as if they wanted to see the venom coursing through Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>"Maybe our eyes were playing tricks on us." Chaim smiled wryly.</p>

  <p>"We'll see in a minute. Look!" Sally said, pointing at Luo Zheng's back.</p>

  <p>The swarm of ants circled around Luo Zheng like a cyclone. One of them landed on Luo Zheng, and sunk its poisonous mandibles into his back.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng merely slapped at the ant.</p>

  <p>The vermin was crushed to pieces by several hundred Jun of force.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Luo Zheng was still alive, Chaim, Sally and the others finally realized that Luo Zheng was not afraid of the poison at all. He might even be immune. That was why he dared to charge fearlessly forward.</p>

  <p>"Is he a puppet?" a non-human stranger speculated.</p>

  <p>There were some amazing puppet-making skills in the Source World, with which the carvers could make the most realistic-looking marionettes.</p>

  <p>The puppets were not made of flesh and blood, so they wouldn't have to worry about any kind of venom.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng's no puppet," said Sally proudly. "He has special talents. The ants' poison can't kill him."</p>

  <p>How could a puppet without a soul enter the Other Shore? How could Luo Zheng be a puppet?</p>

  <p>As the young master of the Nine Li race, he was strong and powerful.</p>

  <p>When the others saw the expression on Sally's face, they couldn't help but curl their lips. She was worried about Luo Zheng a minute ago, but now she seemed like she was cheering him on.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the non-human stranger at the rear of the group had a wicked light in his eyes. No one noticed, because he stood behind everyone. Their gazes were fixed on Luo Zheng while he battled the ants.</p>

  <p>The stranger was from the Lofty Mountain race. He had mighty-looking limbs, and resembled a gorilla.</p>

  <p>The Lofty Mountain race was a minor race in the northern part of the Source World. Since they were so few in number, they had no power. Few in the Source World even knew of them. In the past, one of their race, an evil ape, had been one of the supreme masters there.</p>

  <p>He died before the Lofty Mountain race could expand and conquer. So the Lofty Mountain race had fallen into obscurity over the years and had almost been forgotten.</p>

  <p>In the past few years, the Bearing race expanded along the Pearl Islet to the north, and occupied the territory of the Lofty Mountain race.</p>

  <p>The Lofty Mountain race couldn't mount any kind of resistance. They either paid allegiance to the Bearing race or were exterminated. In the end, they had become a tributary clan of the Bearing race.</p>

  <p>But it was good for them, actually.</p>

  <p>It was very difficult for them to get tickets to the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>Over several decades, maybe a hundred years, only one or two members of the Lofty Mountain race were able to enter the Chaotic Source World to cultivate.</p>

  <p>However, when the Chaotic Source World opened this time, the Bearing race had very generously given the Lofty Mountain race three tickets, so they were overjoyed.</p>

  <p>If it weren't for the Bearing race, he wouldn't be standing here now.</p>

  <p>The non-human stranger did not hate the Bearing race for occupying his race's territory. Instead, he was full of gratitude.</p>

  <p>As long as he was useful to the Bearing race, he would be able to reap lavish rewards. The loot was more than he had ever imagined. No wonder the Bearing race was a super force.</p>

  <p>Before they set out, the Bearing race made a list. On that list was a record of the disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace that they had to pay special attention to.</p>

  <p>The members of the Bearing race, the Jin Wu, the New Moon race, the Divine Farmer race, the Lofty Mountain race and a dozen of other small races had all obtained the list.</p>

  <p>Ling Shuang, Efrain, Chaim, Milo, and a few others from the other mountains were in the second row.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge was in the first row.</p>

  <p>The man named Tianxing had destroyed the Bearing race's temple. Moreover, they had been defeated by him for several times on the Other Shore, so they had long been seeking revenge.</p>

  <p>They didn't know whether Tianxing was a disciple from the Taiyi Heaven Palace, but since he was in Stage Thirteen of the Desire World, he would definitely enter the Chaotic Source World to cultivate. It was likely that he would come here with the palace.</p>

  <p>Therefore, they planned to eliminate the exceptional disciples from the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>At first, there was only one name on the first row of the list: Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge made her appearance at Stage Thirteen as a denizen of the Other Shore, so they already knew who she was. That was why the Bearing race made her the first target.</p>

  <p>But just before the Chaotic Source World opened, there was another person's name occupying the first row of that list. That was Luo Zheng, the guy in front of the stone pillar.</p>

  <p>While everyone was gobsmacked at Luo Zheng's immunity to the poison, the nonhuman stranger quietly crushed a rune.</p>

  <p>The members of the Bearing race could communicate with each other with the help of the Yellow Emperor Magatama, but this non-human stranger was not important enough to have one.</p>

  <p>However, the Bearing race had been well prepared when they issued that list.</p>

  <p>On the list, next to those names were runes with different colors. The nonhuman stranger crushed the rune next to Luo Zheng's name.</p>

  <p>When he crumbled the rune, the soul marks of certain races tingled. The Bearing race, the Jin Wu, the Divine Farmer race, and the New Moon race all felt it.</p>

  <p>Atop a mountain, a silver haired young man stabbed a spear into the ground and stood still.</p>

  <p>The hurricane kept blowing around him.</p>

  <p>It was almost unthinkable, but the hurricane with several thousand Jun of force was unable to blow him away!</p>

  <p>Of course he could not resist such a powerful hurricane. If you looked carefully, you could see tiny currents surging and circulating around him.</p>

  <p>He had made himself one with the wind.</p>

  <p>By doing this, he made the hurricane forget him. This was his way of cultivation.</p>

  <p>He wouldn't miss this opportunity to strengthen himself.</p>

  <p>At this moment, he suddenly opened his eyes, looking off in the distance.</p>

  <p>"That didn't take long," he muttered. "They found the man named Luo Zheng. But he's too far away from me. I'll spare his life for now."</p>

  <p>Then he closed his eyes again. He stood still in the wind like an iron tower.</p>

  <p> </p>
