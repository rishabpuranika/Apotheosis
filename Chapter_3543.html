  <p>
</p>

  <p>The two light rays were condensed at high speed.</p>

  <p>To the creatures in the Light Region, they were almost harmless, but to the creatures in the Dark Region, they were lethal.</p>

  <p>The two green-skinned men stayed frozen to their spot, unable to move at all. If they attempted to flee, the light rays would slice them in half.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge walked forward with a grim expression. She was about to ask why the two dared to attack them, but abruptly stopped in her tracks. Turning to smile at Luo Zheng, she said sweetly, "You ask."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded. Taking a step forward to face the two green-skinned men, he said, "We're just passing by. Why did you attack us?"</p>

  <p>The two green-skinned men looked Luo Zheng up and down. Compared to Feng Ge, this man didn't look so scary.</p>

  <p>One of the green-skinned men opened his mouth and squeaked. He gestured with his hands, trying to explain himself. But Luo Zheng shook his head, unable to understand a word he said.</p>

  <p>"You don't speak the human language?" Luo Zheng frowned.</p>

  <p>The human language was commonly used both on the Other Shore and in the Source World. It was quite rare for a creature to be unable to speak it.</p>

  <p>"If you don't speak the human language, then you are of no value to us. Go to hell!" Feng Ge spat, her eyes flashing coldly.</p>

  <p>While Feng Ge was very conscious of her image around Luo Zheng, these two green-skinned hooligans were getting on her nerves.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>Countless light awls extended from Feng Ge's fingertips, like shining fingernails. Just as they were about to hit one of the green-skinned men, he hurriedly cried out, "Don't kill me! Don't kill me!"</p>

  <p>Feng Ge stopped. Turning again to smile at Luo Zheng, she said sweetly, "You ask."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded, but he was secretly amused by Feng Ge's behavior. He could tell that Feng Ge was trying to make a good impression on him.</p>

  <p>"So, you do speak the human language. Tell me. Why did you try to attack us secretly?" Luo Zheng asked once more.</p>

  <p>"We're insect catchers," one of the green-skinned men answered. "We are trying to catch the Dark Nether Bug. If you stay here, you will scare it away. Then our tribe will be damned!"</p>

  <p>The two green-skinned men were skilled at catching insects. After setting up a candle, they had used a special method to cover up their own auras.</p>

  <p>If other insects showed up, they would have captured them too, but their ultimate goal was to catch the Dark Nether Bug.</p>

  <p>"Please let us go. We really need to catch the Dark Nether Bug," another green-skinned man pleaded pitifully.</p>

  <p>"Withdraw the light," Luo Zheng said to Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge rolled her eyes and reluctantly tapped her finger. The light that pinned down the legs of the two green-skinned men vanished in an instant.</p>

  <p>The two green-skinned men let out a sigh of relief. But before letting them go, Luo Zheng asked, "I want to inquire about something. In the Dark Region..."</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng spoke, suddenly a wind began to blow from the gloomy forest nearby. The crowns of the trees swayed ominously, and a strong scent of blood permeated the air.</p>

  <p>"What's that smell?"</p>

  <p>A strange expression appeared on Luo Zheng's and Feng Ge's faces when they smelled the blood.</p>

  <p>As the metallic scent filled their nostrils, their heart beat quickened. For some reason, they felt a hint of desire for that blood.</p>

  <p>"It's the Dark Nether Bug!"</p>

  <p>"Oh my God! It's coming!"</p>

  <p>The two green-skinned men's faces turned ghastly pale. One of them flipped his hand, and a bamboo tube appeared. Pouring some brown powder from it onto his palm, he begged Luo Zheng and Feng Ge, "The Dark Nether Bug is the key to our survival. It has a keen sense of smell. If it smells you, it will flee immediately." Raising his powder-covered palm to the two humbly, he asked, "Please, let me sprinkle this powder on your bodies!"</p>

  <p>The other green-skinned man bit his lip anxiously, while eyeing the gloomy forest before them.</p>

  <p>After a while, Luo Zheng slowly nodded.</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish!</p>

  <p>After the green-skinned man sprinkled the brown powder, he asked Luo Zheng and Feng Ge to hide in the grass on the other side. In a low voice, he whispered,</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you two want to know, but after we capture the Dark Nether Bug, we'll definitely oblige you."</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, the trees in the dense forest in the distance parted to both sides.</p>

  <p>A bug emerged from the forest.</p>

  <p>The bug was completely white, with a crystal clear shell. Through the transparent shell, they could see its blood vessels pumping steadily.</p>

  <p>The bug was not big, roughly half a person high. But even so, it was releasing such a powerful aura as it crawled forward.</p>

  <p>The moment their eyes landed on the bug, the strange feeling in Luo Zheng's and Feng Ge's hearts grew stronger. Strangely enough, their stomachs began to growl, as though they were starving.</p>

  <p>"It's strange..." Luo Zheng was very surprised. He had long forgotten the feeling of hunger, since he had stopped eating completely. Yet now, he stared at the bug as though it was the most delicious thing his heart desired.</p>

  <p>But he quickly managed to suppress this weird feeling.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge, on the other hand, was different.</p>

  <p>Her eyes were fixed on the white bug, as though it had captured her soul.</p>

  <p>Opening her mouth slightly, she drawled as though in a trance, "I... I want to eat that bug..."</p>

  <p>As she spoke, she was about to stand up, but Luo Zheng quickly pulled her down.</p>

  <p>"Feng Ge, what's wrong with you?"</p>

  <p>"Hush!" the two green-skinned men said anxiously.</p>

  <p>Because of this, the Dark Nether Bug that had been slowly crawling forward abruptly stopped. Raising its head to survey its surroundings, its beady eyes darted about vigilantly.</p>

  <p>After a while, it let its guard down and continued crawling slowly towards the candle.</p>

  <p>One of the two green-skinned men held a long and thin bamboo pole, and the other clutched a rope. Once the Dark Nether Bug crawled into the range of the candlelight, they were ready to catch it.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng eyed Feng Ge worriedly.</p>

  <p>She was still fixated on the Dark Nether Bug. The smell of blood emanating from the bug was a fatal attraction to her.</p>

  <p>If it weren't for Luo Zheng, she might have pounced on the Dark Nether Bug by now.</p>

  <p>"It's almost there! Get ready!" one of the green-skinned men hissed in a low voice.</p>

  <p>The other green-skinned man clutched the rope tightly in anticipation. Just as he was about to throw the rope at the bug, the forest trees swayed to the side once more. Three more Dark Nether Bugs emerged, each one twice as big as the first one and as tall as an adult human!</p>

  <p>When the two green-skinned men saw the three Dark Nether Bugs, their expressions fell.</p>

  <p>Their plan had been to catch only one Dark Nether Bug. But now, with the addition of three more, the situation suddenly became extremely complicated.</p>
