  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng frowned at the sight of the three demon mice. "The Ear Mice?"</p>

  <p>Qiu Yinhe nodded and said, "They are everywhere, always hiding in the darkness."</p>

  <p>Shortly after Luo Zheng had entered the Source World, he had seen the power of the Mice League.</p>

  <p>They were everywhere in the Source World and could obtain most of the secrets of the Source World they infested. Because of this, the Mice League had made a lot of money.</p>

  <p>Almost all large races hated them.</p>

  <p>For instance, the first thing the human race and the Jin Wu would do after occupying part of the Mountain Viewing Province was annihilate the Ear Mice in the province.</p>

  <p>Most of the demon mice in the Mountain Viewing Province had been killed, but there were always some that managed to escape.</p>

  <p>It was probably Luo Zheng's Wind Cloud Escape that had caused a great change in the air and attracted the attention of the three mice. They had been hiding in the dark to spy on him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was unaware of this and did not notice them. But it was impossible for them to escape a figure as powerful as Qiu Yinhe.</p>

  <p>Qiu Yinhe looked at the three fat demon mice and clicked his tongue twice.</p>

  <p>As he extended his hand, the corpses of the three mice floated towards him.</p>

  <p>He remained silent. He skinned the mice with consecutive flicks of his fingers.</p>

  <p>He then bent down and fiddled with something on the ground. When he stood up, a small fire array was burning, on which he placed the bloody corpses and grilled them.</p>

  <p>As the corpses burned in the fire, he took out several bottles.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't know what was in the bottles, but they were probably condiments.</p>

  <p>"Oh, this man!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng muttered. His jaw had dropped at the matter-of-fact manner in which Qiu Yinhe was behaving.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's impression of Qiu Yinhe was of an elder who had an extraordinary aura and put on solemn airs.</p>

  <p>But the Qiu Yinhe before him was completely different from what he had imagined.</p>

  <p>He had molested Phoenix when he fought with her. He was grilling the demon mice that he had captured and was about to heartily devour them.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng couldn't believe that he was actually the dignified Oneness Governor.</p>

  <p>How could the Taiyi Heaven Palace tolerate such a wicked man?</p>

  <p>Qiu Yinhe noticed Luo Zheng's amazed expression, laughed, and said, "I have three hobbies: eating, mating, and playing. All are bad hobbies, right? Don't look at me like that."</p>

  <p>"You can do whatever you want, as long as you are happy," Luo Zheng said as he nodded.</p>

  <p>"Hey..." Qiu Yinhe smiled at Luo Zheng's questioning statement. He paused before he answered, "There should be some things I can't do, of course. But the world is fraught with unforeseen events. I just seize the moments as they come to enjoy myself."</p>

  <p>He sprinkled the condiments onto the mice's corpses as he spoke.</p>

  <p>The meat of the corpses turned golden as it grilled and began to emit a strange smell. It didn't look tasty, but Luo Zheng, who had fasted for many years, felt his appetite stir the moment he smelled the meat.</p>

  <p>Qiu Yinhe noticed Luo Zheng's expression and handed him a cooked mouse.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng hesitated before reaching out to take it.</p>

  <p>He had killed many fierce nonhuman creatures, but this was the first time he had eaten the meat of a nonhuman creature.</p>

  <p>Just as they began to gobble down the delicious food, Qiu Yinhe said, "Not many people know about your existence in the Taiyi Heaven Palace. Just me, Goran, and a few others in the Origin Mountain. Milo might know about you, but I have warned him not to say anything."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng took a bite of the meat, the aromatic oil oozing out of it. He wiped it off before asking, "Why?"</p>

  <p>"On one hand, I want you to have more opportunities to train yourself. On the other hand, you've been trying to hide your background, and I must find out where you come from," Qiu Yinhe said, looking into the distance.</p>

  <p>"Latent Theurgies, the Exhausting Power and the Wind Cloud Escape.</p>

  <p>They come from the Divine Pulse Deadwood and the Ghost Wind Mountain.</p>

  <p>There are few people in the human race who can obtain such Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>There are some people in the Taiyi Heaven Palace who have the Divine Pulse Deadwood, but no one has the Ghost Wind Mountain. The blind guy from the Bearing race has the Ghost Wind Mountain, but no one in the race has the Divine Pulse Deadwood. If my memory serves me right, there are two people in the Nine Li race that have these two Other Shore Tokens,"</p>

  <p>Qiu Yinhe said, analyzing the situation as he ate the mouse meat.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes flashed as he listened to Qiu Yinhe's analysis.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was nervous that Qiu Yinhe had guessed the truth. But he pretended to be calm and asked, "What do you mean by that, Master Qiu Yinhe?"</p>

  <p>"I would indeed be reckless if I guessed your background by relying on this information alone. But I know you did a little trick to change the sword you were using when you operated the Nine Edges Heaven Slaughtering Array,"</p>

  <p>Qiu Yinhe said, a knowing smile on his face.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyebrows went up at this.</p>

  <p>He had been exposed even though he had planned everything so carefully!</p>

  <p>No, that was not right...</p>

  <p>If Qiu Yinhe was present at the time, why hadn't he made a move to stop the enemy?</p>

  <p>How could he just sit by and watch Phoenix kill Cailen and the others?</p>

  <p>The Shade Stone had still been in Cailen's hands at the time.</p>

  <p>Qiu Yinhe seemed to have read Luo Zheng's mind as he said, "The Oneness Guards and the people of the Su Clan all have their own Rebirth Lands. I'm not worried about them dying."</p>

  <p>After one was granted a Rebirth Land, their main body wouldn't be destroyed as long as the Rebirth Land remained intact. This was the method through which the Holy Beings made themselves indestructible.</p>

  <p>"That explains it!" Luo Zheng exclaimed with a snap of his fingers.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng suddenly realized why Cailen had been unwilling to hand over the Shade Stone when the Jin Wu had threatened to kill everyone. He had even risked his life to keep the stone.</p>

  <p>At the time, Luo Zheng had thought that Cailen and the others were willing to sacrifice themselves for the human race. He now realized how wrong he was. Fact was that they would never really die.</p>

  <p>He had been blind to follow them.</p>

  <p>"I care even less about other ordinary people. Even the Shade Stone is just a small stone for weapon refining," Qiu Yinhe continued as he ate. "Your background is more important than all of that."</p>

  <p>He had rushed to the Mountain Viewing Province the moment he had heard about the incident.</p>

  <p>From the moment Luo Zheng had entered the Dragon City, Qiu Yinhe had sent his capable men to tail Luo Zheng, observe his every move, and send detailed reports to him every day.</p>

  <p>There were also people that secretly followed Luo Zheng when he had gone to the Mountain Viewing Province and the Blue Cloud City.</p>

  <p>But none of them had showed up or helped him when he was in danger.</p>

  <p>If it hadn't been for the unexpected change in the battle that had attracted Phoenix, Qiu Yinhe wouldn't have showed up in person.</p>

  <p>"It looks like you got what you wanted," Luo Zheng said somewhat unhappily.</p>

  <p>Who'd be happy to know that they had been spied on by someone in the dark? It didn't matter that Qiu Yinhe didn't have any malicious intentions.</p>

  <p>"Don't be angry." Qiu Yinhe handed another cooked mouse to Luo Zheng, as if trying to please him. To his surprise, Luo Zheng pushed it away. Qiu Yinhe shrugged and said, "Our Taiyi Heaven Palace never had any conflicts with the Nine Li race and we don't have any hatred against each other. When we saw an orthodox force of human race being annihilated, we felt sorry too, but our Eastern Emperor did not choose his way at that time..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was a little relieved at Qiu Yinhe's words.</p>

  <p>He had inquired about this when he had entered the Dragon City, and it was true that the Taiyi Heaven Palace had no conflicts with the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>If the Taiyi Heaven Palace was standing opposite from the Nine Li race, Luo Zheng would have probably found an opportunity to leave a long time ago.</p>

  <p>"Choose his way? What way do you mean?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>He had no idea what Qiu Yinhe was referring to. Was it the Divine Dao that he was saying, or anything else?</p>

  <p>Qiu Yinhe studied Luo Zheng, a strange expression on his face. He thought Luo Zheng's talent to be extraordinary and since Luo Zheng had the Soaring Snake Sword, he had assumed that Luo Zheng was a descendant of the Nine Li race. He then said,</p>

  <p>"It sounds like you don't even know why Chiyou and the Xuanyuan fought each other?"</p>
