  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng frowned at the sight of the three demon mice. "The Ear Mice?"</p>

  <p>Athemar nodded and said, "They are everywhere, always hiding in the darkness."</p>

  <p>Shortly after Zheng had entered the Source World, he had seen the power of the Mice League.</p>

  <p>They were everywhere in the Source World and could obtain most of the secrets of the Source World they infested. Because of this, the Mice League had made a lot of money.</p>

  <p>Almost all large races hated them.</p>

  <p>For instance, the first thing the human race and the Sun Crow race would do after occupying part of the Mountain Viewing Province was annihilate the Ear Mice in the province.</p>

  <p>Most of the demon mice in the Mountain Viewing Province had been killed, but there were always some that managed to escape.</p>

  <p>It was probably Zheng's Wind Cloud Escape that had caused a great change in the air and attracted the attention of the three mice. They had been hiding in the dark to spy on him.</p>

  <p>Zheng was unaware of this and did not notice them. But it was impossible for them to escape a figure as powerful as Athemar.</p>

  <p>Athemar looked at the three fat demon mice and clicked his tongue twice.</p>

  <p>As he extended his hand, the corpses of the three mice floated towards him.</p>

  <p>He remained silent. He skinned the mice with consecutive flicks of his fingers.</p>

  <p>He then bent down and fiddled with something on the ground. When he stood up, a small fire array was burning, on which he placed the bloody corpses and grilled them.</p>

  <p>As the corpses burned in the fire, he took out several bottles.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't know what was in the bottles, but they were probably condiments.</p>

  <p>"Oh, this man!"</p>

  <p>Zheng muttered. His jaw had dropped at the matter-of-fact manner in which Athemar was behaving.</p>

  <p>Zheng's impression of Athemar was of an elder who had an extraordinary aura and put on solemn airs.</p>

  <p>But the Athemar before him was completely different from what he had imagined.</p>

  <p>He had molested Elizabeth when he fought with her. He was grilling the demon mice that he had captured and was about to heartily devour them.</p>

  <p>Zheng couldn't believe that he was actually the dignified Oneness Governor.</p>

  <p>How could the Oneness Sky Palace tolerate such a wicked man?</p>

  <p>Athemar noticed Zheng's amazed expression, laughed, and said, "I have three hobbies: eating, mating, and playing. All are bad hobbies, right? Don't look at me like that."</p>

  <p>"You can do whatever you want, as long as you are happy," Zheng said as he nodded.</p>

  <p>"Hey..." Athemar smiled at Zheng's questioning statement. He paused before he answered, "There should be some things I can't do, of course. But the world is fraught with unforeseen events. I just seize the moments as they come to enjoy myself."</p>

  <p>He sprinkled the condiments onto the mice's corpses as he spoke.</p>

  <p>The meat of the corpses turned golden as it grilled and began to emit a strange smell. It didn't look tasty, but Zheng, who had fasted for many years, felt his appetite stir the moment he smelled the meat.</p>

  <p>Athemar noticed Zheng's expression and handed him a cooked mouse.</p>

  <p>Zheng hesitated before reaching out to take it.</p>

  <p>He had killed many fierce nonhuman creatures, but this was the first time he had eaten the meat of a nonhuman creature.</p>

  <p>Just as they began to gobble down the delicious food, Athemar said, "Not many people know about your existence in the Oneness Sky Palace. Just me, Goran, and a few others in the Origin Mountain. Milo might know about you, but I have warned him not to say anything."</p>

  <p>Zheng took a bite of the meat, the aromatic oil oozing out of it. He wiped it off before asking, "Why?"</p>

  <p>"On one hand, I want you to have more opportunities to train yourself. On the other hand, you've been trying to hide your background, and I must find out where you come from," Athemar said, looking into the distance.</p>

  <p>"Latent Theurgies, the Exhausting Power and the Wind Cloud Escape.</p>

  <p>They come from the Divine Pulse Deadwood and the Ghost Wind Mountain.</p>

  <p>There are few people in the human race who can obtain such Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>There are some people in the Oneness Sky Palace who have the Divine Pulse Deadwood, but no one has the Ghost Wind Mountain. The blind guy from the Bearing race has the Ghost Wind Mountain, but no one in the race has the Divine Pulse Deadwood. If my memory serves me right, there are two people in the Nine Li race that have these two Other Shore Tokens,"</p>

  <p>Athemar said, analyzing the situation as he ate the mouse meat.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes flashed as he listened to Athemar's analysis.</p>

  <p>Zheng was nervous that Athemar had guessed the truth. But he pretended to be calm and asked, "What do you mean by that, Master Athemar?"</p>

  <p>"I would indeed be reckless if I guessed your background by relying on this information alone. But I know you did a little trick to change the sword you were using when you operated the Nine Edges Heaven Slaughtering Array,"</p>

  <p>Athemar said, a knowing smile on his face.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyebrows went up at this.</p>

  <p>He had been exposed even though he had planned everything so carefully!</p>

  <p>No, that was not right...</p>

  <p>If Athemar was present at the time, why hadn't he made a move to stop the enemy?</p>

  <p>How could he just sit by and watch Elizabeth kill Cailen and the others?</p>

  <p>The Shade Stone had still been in Cailen's hands at the time.</p>

  <p>Athemar seemed to have read Zheng's mind as he said, "The Oneness Guards and the people of the Su Clan all have their own Rebirth Lands. I'm not worried about them dying."</p>

  <p>After one was granted a Rebirth Land, their main body wouldn't be destroyed as long as the Rebirth Land remained intact. This was the method through which the Holy Beings made themselves indestructible.</p>

  <p>"That explains it!" Zheng exclaimed with a snap of his fingers.</p>

  <p>Zheng suddenly realized why Cailen had been unwilling to hand over the Shade Stone when the Sun Crow race had threatened to kill everyone. He had even risked his life to keep the stone.</p>

  <p>At the time, Zheng had thought that Cailen and the others were willing to sacrifice themselves for the human race. He now realized how wrong he was. Fact was that they would never really die.</p>

  <p>He had been blind to follow them.</p>

  <p>"I care even less about other ordinary people. Even the Shade Stone is just a small stone for weapon refining," Athemar continued as he ate. "Your background is more important than all of that."</p>

  <p>He had rushed to the Mountain Viewing Province the moment he had heard about the incident.</p>

  <p>From the moment Zheng had entered the Dragon City, Athemar had sent his capable men to tail Zheng, observe his every move, and send detailed reports to him every day.</p>

  <p>There were also people that secretly followed Zheng when he had gone to the Mountain Viewing Province and the Blue Cloud City.</p>

  <p>But none of them had showed up or helped him when he was in danger.</p>

  <p>If it hadn't been for the unexpected change in the battle that had attracted Elizabeth, Athemar wouldn't have showed up in person.</p>

  <p>"It looks like you got what you wanted," Zheng said somewhat unhappily.</p>

  <p>Who'd be happy to know that they had been spied on by someone in the dark? It didn't matter that Athemar didn't have any malicious intentions.</p>

  <p>"Don't be angry." Athemar handed another cooked mouse to Zheng, as if trying to please him. To his surprise, Zheng pushed it away. Athemar shrugged and said, "Our Oneness Sky Palace never had any conflicts with the Nine Li race and we don't have any hatred against each other. When we saw an orthodox force of human race being annihilated, we felt sorry too, but our Eastern Emperor did not choose his way at that time..."</p>

  <p>Zheng was a little relieved at Athemar's words.</p>

  <p>He had inquired about this when he had entered the Dragon City, and it was true that the Oneness Sky Palace had no conflicts with the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>If the Oneness Sky Palace was standing opposite from the Nine Li race, Zheng would have probably found an opportunity to leave a long time ago.</p>

  <p>"Choose his way? What way do you mean?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>He had no idea what Athemar was referring to. Was it the Godly Way that he was saying, or anything else?</p>

  <p>Athemar studied Zheng, a strange expression on his face. He thought Zheng's talent to be extraordinary and since Zheng had the Soaring Snake Sword, he had assumed that Zheng was a descendant of the Nine Li race. He then said,</p>

  <p>"It sounds like you don't even know why Chiyou and the Yellow Thearch fought each other?"</p>
