  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did not return to the main city of the Demon Night with Aurora and Amber.</p>

  <p>The speed at which they traveled through the Deadwood Gate and received Illusion Points wasn't at all slow, where ordinary martial artists were concerned, but it was still far from enough for Luo Luo Zheng. His quest for success was insatiable, and he would only accept the very best and fastest.</p>

  <p>Another consideration was that after Luo Luo Zheng came to the Deadwood Gate, the Illusion Points that had been distributed to Aurora would naturally decrease. She probably didn't want him to stay either.</p>

  <p>Outside the Deadwood Gate, many of the Demon Night warriors witnessed Luo Zheng's transformation into a streak of light that headed north.</p>

  <p>Amber watched Luo Zheng's departure with a complicated look on her face.</p>

  <p>Aurora glanced over at Amber and knew instinctively what she was thinking.</p>

  <p>After all, he probably represented the last sliver of a chance for her to regain her freedom, and that had meaning, no matter how small that chance was.</p>

  <p>"I feel that Luo Luo Zheng is already strong enough to fight the ace talents of the major powers. He might even be able to fight for a place in the top one hundred of the Illusion Battlefield," Aurora said by way of encouragement.</p>

  <p>The top one hundred of the Illusion Battlefield, no matter where those martial artists were placed in the top one hundred, would be considered exceptional and without par!</p>

  <p>They would be considered to be the blessed ones of the world!</p>

  <p>Some of them had rare and special bloodlines. Some had no peers to their innate talents. Others even had heaven-defying karmic luck.</p>

  <p>Out of a vast multitude of martial artists, only these kinds of warriors were qualified to be called the ace talents.</p>

  <p>Amber was silent for a long time, her eyes fixed on the disappearing streak of light. When Luo Luo Zheng had completely disappeared from sight, she said, "Luo Luo Zheng will win in the Illusion Battlefield."</p>

  <p>When Aurora heard her words and sensed the power of her conviction, a peculiar color appeared in her eyes.</p>

  <p>'Win? Contest for first place?</p>

  <p>Amber is a bit too optimistic, ' Aurora thought realistically.</p>

  <p>Admittedly, Luo Zheng's strength was amazing, far surpassing that of an ordinary warrior of the Soul Sea Realm. With the strength that Luo Luo Zheng had displayed now, even an ordinary Spirit Supreme Realm warrior wouldn't be able to last one round against him.</p>

  <p>But the competition he faced now was even more terrifying!</p>

  <p>There were the ace talents from various races.</p>

  <p>For instance, the strength of Eunice from the Demon Night was unfathomable. It would definitely not be easy for Luo Luo Zheng to win, added to which, there were so many races in the universe. Every one of them had a strong competitor. Luo Luo Zheng would have to face and best them all to win the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>Amber's faith in Luo Luo Zheng was a bit too blind.</p>

  <p>However, Aurora wasn't going to point that out. If Luo Luo Zheng was truly able to do it, she would be happy for Amber. Perhaps, he could really rescue Amber out of that purgatory in three years!</p>

  <p>It would take about twelve hours to open the Deadwood Gate again, after its fruits had been taken away.</p>

  <p>During this period of time, Aurora decided to bring the warriors from the Demon Night back to the city to rest. Now, they were on their way back.</p>

  <p>Finally, Luo Zheng's Teleportation Token could be used again.</p>

  <p>However, every time he used the Teleportation Token, he would have to wait a long time before he could use it again. Now that he knew with certainty that there would be a main city to the north, he naturally would not want to waste a single teleportation opportunity.</p>

  <p>As he took off into the sky, his body trembled violently. After shaking off the bothersome small skulls that were swarming around him, he immediately turned into a flash of light and swiftly sped forward!</p>

  <p>Unimaginably, these small skulls chased after him nonstop with an almost primal need to slaughter Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>In addition, their speed was almost the same as Luo Zheng's. No matter how fast he flew, they would fly as fast and match him. When he paused for a moment, those small skulls would bare their white teeth and bite him, which was more annoying than painful. However, Luo Luo Zheng didn't know how to defeat them, or make these skulls abandon their pursuit of him.</p>

  <p>He was helpless against them!</p>

  <p>After flying for roughly ten thousand kilometers, a towering main city appeared ahead of them.</p>

  <p>Just by looking at the structure of the city walls, and the supporting buttresses and columns, Luo Luo Zheng knew that this was a main city of the ogres.</p>

  <p>He slowed down for a bit and carefully observed his surroundings.</p>

  <p>At the same time, a series of coughing sounds came from behind him, as the skulls had caught up and were biting his back once more.</p>

  <p>'Forget it. I'll just try and see if I can get rid of these skulls first.' Luo Zheng's body trembled, and the force which he exuded pushed the skulls away.</p>

  <p>He once again turned into a streak of light and charged towards the main city.</p>

  <p>Outside of the main city, many ogre martial artists were still fighting ferociously.</p>

  <p>The ogres were a bloodthirsty and warlike race. The current hostile environment would only increase their fighting spirit!</p>

  <p>According to Luo Zheng's plan, now that he had obtained the Teleportation Token, he would travel back and forth between the main cities and fight outside these cities.</p>

  <p>However, right now, he was still in a hurry to get rid of the gnawing trouble behind him!</p>

  <p>Therefore, he didn't even spare a glance at the ogre martial artists dueling outside of the city. Instead, he dashed straight towards the main city!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The speed of his passage as a light beam was extremely high! As the beam of light flew past, it produced a loud crackling roar.</p>

  <p>The ogre martial practitioners who were fighting suddenly saw this beam of light, and a look of surprise flashed across their faces.</p>

  <p>There was actually a swarm of skulls following the light. These ogre martial artists didn't understand the situation!</p>

  <p>"What is that thing?"</p>

  <p>"The one at the front seems to be a human warrior who has transformed into light?"</p>

  <p>"What is he doing here?"</p>

  <p>The ogre martial artists inside and outside of the main city began discussing the scene before their eyes with concern and curiosity.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng ignored their marveling gazes and flew on towards the main city...</p>

  <p>However, just as he approached the main city, an ogre martial artist flew out with a giant spear resting on his shoulder and said with an evil grin on his face, "Hey, where did this human brat come from? If you want to escape to the main city, then leave behind your ?"</p>

  <p>Before he finished speaking, and under the gazes of many ogre martial artists, the beam of light created by Luo Luo Zheng swiftly arced its flight, winding towards the ogre martial artist!</p>

  <p>Pfft!</p>

  <p>A stream of brown blood burst forth in a great spray!</p>

  <p>The ogre martial artist that was about to block Luo Zheng's way had been cut in half!</p>

  <p>The vast majority of the ogre martial artists didn't even see clearly what kind of method Luo Luo Zheng had used to kill him!</p>

  <p>By the time they snapped to and tried to react, Luo Luo Zheng had already arrived at the edge of the city wall!</p>

  <p>This scene immediately caused the ogre martial practitioners present to twist their faces in fear. Those who had been discussing this matter were immediately and completely silenced. They were afraid that Luo Luo Zheng would look upon them as his next target.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's expression was extremely calm. He would not waste any more time here than necessary. He stepped onto the city walls, turned around, and looked back. He wanted to see what would happen to the small skulls. Would they be killed by the rules of the city?</p>

  <p>In next to no time, the gloominess in his eyes intensified.</p>

  <p>The small skulls were still grinding their white teeth, but they did not enter the main city. Instead, they lingered outside the city walls, as if the main city had a special force that repelled them and kept them outside the main city!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng gritted his teeth and walked off the city wall. But, as he left, the small skulls acted like a school of sharks smelling the scent of blood, as they rushed towards Luo Luo Zheng once again ?</p>

  <p>When the small skulls bit onto his body, Luo Luo Zheng once again entered the main city. The invisible force protecting the city once again isolated the small skulls from him, by keeping them outside!</p>

  <p>As for the ogre martial artists inside and outside of the main city, when they saw this bizarre scene, they stared at each other blankly.</p>

  <p>"What is this fellow doing?"</p>

  <p>"At first, I even thought that those skulls were his weapons. It seems that he wanted to bring those skulls into the main city."</p>

  <p>"I don't understand..."</p>

  <p>Only moments before, Luo Luo Zheng had used a thunderous method to kill an ogre expert. So while they were discussing him, they cautiously lowered their voices, awed by his power.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng thought for a while with a frown etched on his brow. He was standing on top of the city wall, when he suddenly stretched out his hand and grabbed a small skull with lightning fast speed. He then pulled the snapping skull towards himself!</p>

  <p>He had originally been standing on the edge of the main city. If he took one step forward, then he would be outside of the city; and if he took one step back, then he would be inside of the city.</p>

  <p>However, when Luo Luo Zheng pulled the skull inside over the edge of the city wall, he immediately felt an obvious resistance!</p>

  <p>This power obviously did not emanate from these small skulls because Luo Luo Zheng could throw them tens of thousands of feet away if he caught them.</p>

  <p>There seemed to be a forbidden zone over the main city, resisting the entry of these small skulls!</p>

  <p>Aurora was right!</p>

  <p>If he could bring these small skulls into the main city, he could indeed rely on the powerful rules of the main city to kill them.</p>

  <p>The problem now was that he couldn't get them in at all!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stood on top of the city wall, gripped the small skull tightly and dragged it towards the city wall. The resistance was powerful, and the veins bulged on Luo Zheng's burly arms as he used his awesome physical strength, yet still the skull did not come any further into the city. During this process, Luo Luo Zheng also slowly activated the power of the dragon scales!</p>
