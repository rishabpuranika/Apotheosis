<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The various palace leaders looked at the lord of the Sunset World in confusion. One of them opened his mouth and asked, "What's going on?"</p>

  <p>The world lord's gaze was fixed on the golden snakes as he spat out,</p>

  <p>"Luck-devouring Snakes!"</p>

  <p>"Luck-devouring Snakes? Do those creatures truly exist?"</p>

  <p>"Now that I think about it, they do seem somewhat similar to the legendary Luck-devouring Snakes."</p>

  <p>"The Luck-devouring Snake Tribulation. That is a legendary tribulation.</p>

  <p>How could a Life and Death Realm warrior encounter it?"</p>

  <p>The palace leaders did not recognize the origins of these golden snakes, but they immediately understood what this meant after hearing the world lord's words.</p>

  <p>The warriors of the 100, 000 supreme worlds had a much clearer understanding of fate than those who belonged to the Lower World.</p>

  <p>Warriors could defy the Nature Law and change their fate through mere cultivation. Eventually, they could become immortals.</p>

  <p>Ordinary people had short lives spanning a few decades. However, after cultivation, they could live for much longer, and this defied the Nature Law. The heavens would naturally punish warriors once they entered the Life and Death Realm, by using the Heavenly Tribulations.</p>

  <p>Warriors could also change their fates through cultivation. Although almost everyone's fate was sealed, warriors could use every possible method to change it.</p>

  <p>Every single one of the warriors was constantly in an attempt to rewrite his or her own fate.</p>

  <p>A mortal might come face to face with a bucket of water that could not be lifted, an indestructible city, or a cup of poisoned wine that a king gave him which he could not refuse.</p>

  <p>But what a warrior faced was far worse? a mountain that he could not break, an opponent he could not defeat, or a Heavenly Tribulation that he could not subdue, even if he exhausted all of his strength.</p>

  <p>This was also the reason why the warriors of the Upper World attached great importance to the Lotus Flower. It was because the fate of all creatures was decided by the heavens? from the stars to the insects and the ants. But the Lotus Flower determined a warrior's talent, which was also the possibility whether the warrior could shake off the control of the heavens.</p>

  <p>If one could withdraw from the control of the heavens, then his fate was in his own hands and he would secure true freedom. If one could not change his fate, however, then he would be reincarnated again and again.</p>

  <p>He might have been a human in this grand era, but in the next, he could be a Supreme Lord, or a speck of dust. In the end, he would not be able to escape this loop.</p>

  <p>The more petals one's Lotus Flower sprouted, the stronger one's luck was. This was a widely accepted conclusion in the Upper World.</p>

  <p>Although the Lotus Flower was not a symbol of talent, it was often more important than even that.</p>

  <p>The lord of the Sunset World looked at Luo Luo Zheng, then looked at the Luck-devouring Snakes, and finally at the Mahayana Lotus Flower hanging over his head. "What sort of fate does Luo Luo Zheng have? Why is the heavens sending down Luck-devouring Snakes to destroy him?" he murmured.</p>

  <p>Hearing his doubt, Yolande said confidently, "Luo Luo Zheng has two kinds of fate.</p>

  <p>Strictly speaking, his fate to lead the world of chaos is a false one. No one can predict his real fate."</p>

  <p>The world lord was slightly startled, his eyes revealing a strange expression. "It seems that I have to inform the people from the Gauze Pavilion about this!"</p>

  <p>Yolande pursed her lips and smiled. "Let's wait for him to pass his tribulation first!" The Gauze Pavilion was indeed a good place for Luo Luo Zheng to go to, but he had already taken on too many responsibilities.</p>

  <p>"But can he really survive the Luck-devouring Snake Tribulation?" The world lord's face betrayed worry.</p>

  <p>The Luck-devouring Snake Tribulation was different from an ordinary Heavenly Tribulation. These snakes could swallow one's luck. Apart from his or her talent, luck was most important to a warrior.</p>

  <p>A warrior with good luck could survive many a crisis and even gain great benefits. They could turn unfavorable situations into blessed encounters. Wherever they went, they traveled unhindered. On the other hand, even though those with bad luck were cautious, they had to face death with every step that they took.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng's luck was devoured by the Luck-devouring Snakes, then things would become much more troublesome for him.</p>

  <p>At this time, as Luo Luo Zheng watched the golden snakes slither in the sky, a bad premonition rose in his heart.</p>

  <p>These golden snakes did not possess much power and were far inferior to Thunder Tribulation, Fire Tribulation, and Nightmare Tribulation.</p>

  <p>However, at the sight of them, a sense of foreboding struck him, as if these golden snakes could take away his most valuable asset.</p>

  <p>When the golden snakes crossed a certain distance, they opened their mouths as if devouring something in the air.</p>

  <p>"What are they eating?" Luo Luo Zheng murmured.</p>

  <p>Doubt was written all over his face.</p>

  <p>"They are having a feast on your luck," Xun said. "These are the Luck-devouring Snakes. They can devour the good luck of warriors.</p>

  <p>Quite unique creatures!"</p>

  <p>"Having a feast on my luck?" Luo Luo Zheng was shocked. The reason he had been able to come so far was not his cultivation methods or the treasures he possessed. Rather, it was his willpower, talent, and luck. These three were the most important to him, and at no point should he be lacking in them! It was not just Luo Luo Zheng who knew this to be true. Anyone who wanted to reach the peak of cultivation had to have these three assets.</p>

  <p>Ever since he had left the Eastern Region, Luo Zheng's luck had always been good. His good fortune not only benefited himself, but also the people around him. This had been the case for the people close to him. For example, the moment Mu Ning entered the Purple Power World, she was able to become the disciple of the Apeiron Tower. It was due to the influence of Luo Zheng's luck.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie, Mu Ning, and even Tianming had their own lucky incidents happen to them. They were all affected by Luo Zheng's good fortune.</p>

  <p>Changing a person's fate was not easy.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had once participated in the Wheel of Fortune test in Immortal Mist's celestial tomb, where he was cursed by the holy maiden of the York Divine Kingdom. When Luo Luo Zheng rolled the dice, the worst would happen, as if the curse had truly changed his good luck.</p>

  <p>In truth, Immortal Mist had only changed the Wheel of Fortune, not Luo Zheng's fate. According to the rules set by Immortal Mist, as long as one was cursed, no matter how good his luck was, the outcome would not be in his favor.</p>

  <p>And now, these Luck-devouring Snakes were devouring Luo Zheng's luck, one bite after another. As his good luck depleted bit by bit, there would soon be no way to make up for the loss.</p>

  <p>'Why is there such a strange Heavenly Tribulation? Luck cannot be seen or touched, but it can apparently be swallowed up by these golden snakes!'</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng thought of this, he no longer had any hesitation as he suddenly leaped up and rushed toward the Luck-devouring Snakes.</p>

  <p>Anyone who found out that his luck was being devoured could not just sit by idly and do nothing.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Never would Luo Luo Zheng have thought that upon charging ahead, he would actually pass through the golden snakes. The golden snakes were a form of illusory existence.</p>

  <p>The other warriors, including Layla, did not understand what was happening in front of their very eyes. To them, the golden snakes that had descended from the sky were no match to the Heavenly Tribulation that the warriors themselves had encountered before.</p>

  <p>The lord of the Sunset World and the other palace leaders, however, were clearly worried.</p>

  <p>A warrior who was in the process of undergoing the Heavenly Tribulation could not rely on the help of outsiders. They could only depend on their own strength to bear through the trial.</p>

  <p>The world lord had assumed that Luo Luo Zheng had a plan to deal with this, but when he saw the scene before him, he knew that Luo Luo Zheng did not know how to handle the Luck-devouring Snakes.</p>

  <p>The Luck-devouring Snakes paid no attention to Luo Luo Zheng. They continued to slither in the air after Luo Luo Zheng shifted his position, as if changing their direction again. Then they continued to devour his luck.</p>

  <p>"A Luck-devouring Snake isn't a creature. It can be said that it exceeds the existence of any living being." The lord of the Sunset World fixed his eyes on Luo Luo Zheng as he continued, "If I remember correctly, I've seen an example of this in the records of the grand eras. Countless grand eras ago, another warrior had encountered the Luck-devouring Snakes.</p>

  <p>Anyone qualified to attract the Luck-devouring Snakes naturally possesses good fortune. After the Luck-devouring Snake Tribulation descended on him, however, he could only watch helplessly as the snakes devoured his luck without encountering any sort of resistance!"</p>

  <p>A palace leader could not help but shake his head. "In other words, Luo Zheng's struggle is futile."</p>

  <p>"What a pity! I was really looking forward to seeing the extraordinary future this little fellow would otherwise have!" Another palace leader sighed in disappointment. Although Luo Luo Zheng did not come from this particular leader's palace, the latter cherished talents. He could not help but be silently dejected at the prospect of witnessing the end of such a talent.</p>

  <p>As for Yolande, her expression remained calm. To her, Luo Luo Zheng was a warrior who turned unfavorable situations into miracles. She still believed that he, who had turned things around so many times, could do it once again.</p>
