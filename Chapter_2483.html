  <p>
</p>

  <p>If it weren't for Duke, they never would have been put in such a difficult position. So they did not hesitate at all.</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!</p>

  <p>Everyone stabbed Duke's body with the Calamity Swords one after another.</p>

  <p>The swordsmanship of the disciples from the Sword Clan was brilliant.</p>

  <p>The Calamity Swords had pierced through Duke's body, but they had avoided his vital parts, and he did not even bleed much.</p>

  <p>Duke had also tried his best to retaliate during this period of time.</p>

  <p>The only way he could resist this attack was to self-destruct. But just as the idea popped into his head, the woman with long hair discovered his intention.</p>

  <p>He felt a slight pain in his belly, and a thin hair penetrated through his cinnabar field. Instantly Duke lost contact with his cinnabar field and was unable to end his own life.</p>

  <p>The eleven Calamity Swords had pierced Duke's body, making him look like a hedgehog.</p>

  <p>He couldn't understand what these people wanted to do and had given up resistance despairingly.</p>

  <p>That was when the long haired woman waved her hands gently and cast a spell, from which a strange aura burst out.</p>

  <p>"This aura..." Luo Zheng's eyes narrowed suspiciously.</p>

  <p>He had felt the same aura when he faced the Luck-devouring Snake Tribulation.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's faith in destiny was steadfast at the very beginning.</p>

  <p>However, Tianming's words made him doubt the destiny later.</p>

  <p>When he found out that everything was his father's arrangement, he rejected the destiny. It turned out that his life was pre-arranged by his father.</p>

  <p>"The so-called misfortune is just a special energy, right? Or is it that the three crises and three calamities are actually a counterattack from the Calamity Swords?" Luo Zheng couldn't help but ask.</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, she shook her head and said, "No, this is the punishment of the previous luck."</p>

  <p>"Does luck really exist?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The spell in the long haired woman's hand was constantly changing. The aura gushed into the eleven swords, which was going to divert the three crises and three calamities to Duke.</p>

  <p>At the same time, she answered Luo Zheng's question in seriousness, "Of course, it exists! This is an authority in the divine land."</p>

  <p>"Really? This is an authority?" Luo Zheng was stunned.</p>

  <p>The long haired woman gazed at her son with tenderness. "Of course this is an authority. If you have enough divine might coins, you can change your luck on the Ruling Slate. It's not very difficult. The real trouble is..."</p>

  <p>She pointed at the Calamity Swords and continued, "The Calamity Sword, which is formed by the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, can take your luck to a higher level. Therefore, even the Holy Beings of the divine land can't do anything about it."</p>

  <p>"A higher level you say? Mother. Do you mean the extraordinary creatures?" Luo Zheng was stumped by all the things he was learning from his mother.</p>

  <p>Whenever she heard Luo Zheng refer to her as 'mother', there would be undisguised happiness on her face.</p>

  <p>"You could say that, but the Calamity Sword is not complete. If a warrior at the Other Shore Realm released the Misfortune Sword, then it wouldn't be so easy to transfer the consequences," replied the long haired woman.</p>

  <p>Now Luo Zheng got a lot of clarity on the matter.</p>

  <p>No matter how talented the disciple of the Sword Clan, who created the Calamity Sword, was, the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent comprehended by him wasn't complete. The Calamity Sword wasn't so difficult to resist.</p>

  <p>However, the Truth of Divine Dao was passed down from the extraordinary creatures, which came from the boundless chaos outside the divine land.</p>

  <p>The creatures in the divine land had no solution to this. Even the Holy Beings could not break it.</p>

  <p>So if his mother could make it, did it mean that she was from outside the divine land?</p>

  <p>Or, did it mean that she also had the strength of the Other Shore Realm?</p>

  <p>And if she was so powerful, why was she hiding in the underground world?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's heart was riddled with doubts.</p>

  <p>'My mother shouldn't have anything to hide from me, I should really ask her about these things, ' Luo Zheng thought to himself.</p>

  <p>However, he felt that his questions could wait until she transferred the misfortune of the Calamity Swords.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng saw that she had crossed her hands and her fingers were continuously bouncing on the eleven Calamity Swords.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The Calamity Swords were roaring and Duke's face revealed a look of extreme pain.</p>

  <p>The invisible power flowed into Duke's body like a tidal wave.</p>

  <p>However, a few seconds later...</p>

  <p>The invisible force vanished.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the center of Duke's forehead had already turned dark. There was an indescribable and unclear energy hidden in that dark spot.</p>

  <p>"You all can pull out your swords now," the long haired woman said casually.</p>

  <p>To be honest, she didn't care about the lives of anyone here. Duke or Reinhard meant nothing to her.</p>

  <p>She only cared about Luo Zheng's emotional state.</p>

  <p>If the disciples of the Sword Clan died, she was worried that Luo Zheng would blame himself for it. As his mother, she would not hesitate to help him.</p>

  <p>By the time Reinhard and the others drew out their Calamity Swords, the blood red light had completely disappeared and at the same time, they felt relaxed, and the invisible pressure that was attached to them disappeared.</p>

  <p>They all looked at her in amazement.</p>

  <p>In the Sword Clan, it was widely-known fact that there was no solution to the Calamity Sword.</p>

  <p>The four Holy Beings of the Sword Clan were unsuccessful in breaking it, but the long haired woman broke it with relative ease.</p>

  <p>Not only were their lives saved, but they also completed their task smoothly. Now, they were overjoyed.</p>

  <p>"Let's go."</p>

  <p>Without so much as glancing at them, she turned around and left with Luo Zheng in tow.</p>

  <p>The disciples of the Sword Clan were indeed happy, but they also felt a sense of alienation from the long haired woman, as if she was not willing to build a rapport with them.</p>

  <p>They couldn't address this issue with her so they just trailed behind her thousand feet long hair and didn't dare to get too close to her.</p>

  <p>They had left Duke alone.</p>

  <p>"How come they let me off so easily?"</p>

  <p>Duke stared dumbly at the group of people walking away. He still could not believe his eyes.</p>

  <p>After they left, Duke felt that something was amiss. It seemed that an invisible ghost was approaching.</p>

  <p>...</p>

  <p>Soon Luo Zheng and the others heard Duke's gut-wrenching shrieks echoing in the distance.</p>

  <p>So awful were the screams that even at a distance, it was terrifying.</p>

  <p>Hearing the cry, Luo Zheng, Reinhard and Solomon turned around and saw a cloud of black smoke enveloping Duke.</p>

  <p>No one could fathom what kind of torture he might have suffered in that vicious black smoke.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng showed no mercy towards Duke because he had almost killed him and Yan.</p>

  <p>As he walked by his mother's side, he suddenly thought of a weird question. He turned to her and asked, "Mother, I don't know your name yet."</p>

  <p>It was indeed strange that he didn't even know his mother's name.</p>

  <p>"My surname is Li..." She shook her head and smiled wryly, "Actually, Li is not a surname. Have you heard of the phrase 'Nine Li people'?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I've heard of it," he replied.</p>

  <p>In the universe, they referred to those mortals as Nine Li people.</p>

  <p>In the divine land, Nine Li people meant divine citizens.</p>

  <p>"In fact, the Nine Li people has been collectively used to describe people in the world, without anyone bothering to investigate the real meaning behind it. It is a race in the wider world outside the divine land. And I am a member of the Nine Li people," she said softly to Luo Zheng.</p>
