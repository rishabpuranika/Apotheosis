  <p>
</p>

  <p>The self-destruction of the three big fiends blew open a huge hole.</p>

  <p>The air from the bottom surged upwards and swirled with the hot air above the magma, creating whistling air currents.</p>

  <p>"The three big fiends have blown themselves up."</p>

  <p>"I can't believe it."</p>

  <p>"I don't think any of the beasts remaining can fight against us, not for any reason they might have!"</p>

  <p>The consummate True Gods and the Demi-holy Beings discussed the situation among themselves.</p>

  <p>Tianming had also been dumbfounded as the scene unfolded in front of his eyes. An inkling of doubt made its way into his heart.</p>

  <p>During their confrontation on the Desperation Plain earlier, the big fiend called Gallio had exploded into pieces, and they had been totally confused.</p>

  <p>This was the fiends' home territory. Gallio could have escaped or even asked other fiends for help even though he couldn't defeat Nicholas.</p>

  <p>If the four big fiends had joined forces and fought together, Nicholas and his companions wouldn't have had a chance to win against them.</p>

  <p>The current situation had gotten unbelievably out of hand. The three big fiends that had just arrived had chosen to self-destruct.</p>

  <p>'They... They must have been forced!'</p>

  <p>The idea had come so suddenly into Tianming's mind.</p>

  <p>But who had the power to force them to commit suicide? What had been the motive behind it?</p>

  <p>If such a being, or even a certain force, had existed that had the power to command them to sacrifice themselves, it must have been extremely powerful.</p>

  <p>"They were forced to explode,"</p>

  <p>Nicholas confirmed when Tianming had come to this conclusion in his mind.</p>

  <p>"Right." Murphy nodded slightly in agreement. "It was obvious that it was not their own will."</p>

  <p>Nicholas narrowed his eyes and looked forward. "The bottom of the Abyss Demon Region is a huge trap. Something is definitely luring us into this trap, but its intention evades me."</p>

  <p>The faces of Zeke, Clark, and the other Holy Beings darkened in foreboding.</p>

  <p>All of them agreed with Nicholas.</p>

  <p>They needed to be in control of the Abyss Demon Region during this trip.</p>

  <p>They had to push through this path even though they already knew that there was a trap set for them.</p>

  <p>The only other choice that they had was to retreat and leave the Abyss Demon Region immediately. There were several of them that had thought about leaving, but they were afraid to voice it out directly.</p>

  <p>After he took a deep breath, Murphy bravely suggested, "How about we give up for now?"</p>

  <p>Nicholas' eyes had scintillated slowly as they turned a pensive color.</p>

  <p>More than a few moments later, he shook his head and said, "Give up? We can't afford to give up now."</p>

  <p>The masters that Zheng had brought back with him had been waiting on standby outside the divine land, and they could have charged into the divine land at any given time.</p>

  <p>It had been very difficult for Nicholas to rely for help on Yellow Emperor Guards like Hamish. If worse came to worst, he had to utilize the power of the divine land. He had almost reached his destination in the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>It would have been preposterous to give up now for any possible reason!</p>

  <p>"I don't care what awaits us ahead. Whatever it is, I will burn it!" Clark laughed when he heard Nicholas' words. "What are you afraid of?"</p>

  <p>"You have a point. We are in the divine land, after all. The beasts would always be weaker than us!" Murphy's eyes lit up.</p>

  <p>It had cost them a lot of their power to deal with a big fiend, but they still hadn't used their trump cards.</p>

  <p>If they had been forced to use their full power, their collective strength would not have been something to underestimate.</p>

  <p>"Nicholas, I'll always be by your side even if I have to risk my life!"</p>

  <p>"At the worst case scenario, we can always rebuild our bodies in the universes!"</p>

  <p>"?"</p>

  <p>Since these three Holy Beings had already made up their minds, the other Holy Beings also took a stand for their positions regarding the matter. The Holy Beings had nothing to lose as they could not really be killed. The worst that could have happened was for them to return to the universes to rebuild their bodies.</p>

  <p>However, the Demi-holy Beings and the consummate True Gods were hesitant.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings had not been afraid of death as they wouldn't have died anyway.</p>

  <p>Based on their strength, Demi-holy Beings and consummate True Gods were much inferior to Holy Beings. If they had died, they wouldn't have had a way to be resurrected.</p>

  <p>'If they already know it's a trap, why do they want us to join them?'</p>

  <p>'Anyway, we can't offer much help now. We'd better leave.'</p>

  <p>'Do they want us to die with them?'</p>

  <p>These had been the thoughts that went through the minds of the Demi-holy Beings and consummate True Gods. They didn't really want to go on, but none of them had dared to voice out their thoughts.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings had always been sensitive to things. They knew what the Demi-holy Beings and consummate True Gods had thought even though they didn't speak out.</p>

  <p>Nicholas looked back at the others and told them, "This trip is a very risky gamble. If we lose in our gamble, there is a high chance that we might die.</p>

  <p>You can't return to life if you die. If you want to back out now, you may choose to leave."</p>

  <p>With those words, he had glanced at Troy and Tianming. He told them, "Troy, Lowell, I need you to go with me. Don't worry. I will protect you."</p>

  <p>Troy and Tianming nodded in confirmation.</p>

  <p>The forbidden lands could only be controlled by consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>For Nicholas to succeed, he would have needed a consummate True God.</p>

  <p>"Rachelle, come with me," Murphy said.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Father," said Rachelle, as she took a step forward and into the air.</p>

  <p>The other Holy Beings likewise had given their orders. Every one of them had to have a consummate True God as a companion.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid no one is able to leave,"</p>

  <p>Samuel whispered to himself as he had been watching the thick fog rolling in the sky.</p>

  <p>The thick fog had drifted over the Abyss Demon Region for innumerable years already. It was like a thick piece of cotton gauze that obstructed all the light in the sky.</p>

  <p>Throughout the years, the thick fog had been unchanged. But then, it slowly began to swirl as it formed a huge whirlpool.</p>

  <p>The center of the whirlpool had been directly above the Holy Beings' heads.</p>

  <p>At the same time, a wave suddenly stirred up on the surface of the Sea of Meditation.</p>

  <p>The surface of the black water had been as smooth as a mirror. The strength of the force did not matter; it would have just disappeared into the black water without any trace.</p>

  <p>But at that moment, unseen tornadoes had forced the black water into the air and formed an amazing spectacle of a dragon siphoning water.</p>

  <p>The black water had touched the gray fog, and similar to a drop of ink that dripped into rice paper, it had made a large area of the fog black. The sky of the Abyss Demon Region had considerably darkened a bit more.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>A dazzling beam of light suddenly shot out from the fog and landed in an area not far from where everyone had stood.</p>

  <p>After the three fiends had self-destructed, a large opening had been opened on the road in front of them. That opening was the entrance to the seventh stage of the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>When the white column had struck down, the cold air rushed in. It had cut the space behind the group and blocked their way completely.</p>

  <p>"Hmm. It seems that you are determined to win." Murphy had looked at the entrance to the seventh stage of the Abyss Demon Region as he spoke, a cold smile upon his lips.</p>

  <p>It had been an undoubtedly arrogant challenge to them to have their route of retreat cut off in such a grand gesture!</p>

  <p>"We will see who will laugh in the end," Nicholas said coldly.</p>

  <p>He had immediately transformed into a streak of light, his hands behind his back, and shot forward.</p>

  <p>The other members of the group had been really hesitant to go forward in this trip. But since their retreat had been cut off, they were left with no other choice but to follow Nicholas.</p>
