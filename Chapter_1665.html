  <p>As she yelled that, the faces of the ace talents and Godly Geniuses present all revealed a superlatively strange look.</p>

  <p>These warriors did not give credence to the private matters of others.</p>

  <p>They had not paid much attention to the intimate relationship which Mu Ning and Luo Luo Zheng shared. They felt it strange because they had thought that the two warriors had only met here in the Illusion Battlefield and it was too soon for them to be so intimate.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha!"</p>

  <p>Looking at the confused expressions on the faces of the warriors, Tianming couldn't help but laugh.</p>

  <p>Even the girl in pink turned to look at Mu Ning in bewilderment.</p>

  <p>However, her face was blurry and her expression remained indistinct.</p>

  <p>As for those in the outside world, the gathered warriors were also discussing this development among themselves.</p>

  <p>"Is that woman Luo Zheng's wife?"</p>

  <p>"They both made it to the top three hundred. This is too strange to be a coincidence!"</p>

  <p>"Ah, Luo Luo Zheng is so lucky. How can a country bumpkin that ascended from the Lower World have such a beauty by his side?"</p>

  <p>"Humph, they most likely hooked up recently in the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>A woman, who so easily hooks up with a man, is most likely not of fair virtues!"</p>

  <p>Countless warriors were discussing this development. There were those who sighed, those who admired, and even those who despised the couple for it.</p>

  <p>When Preston heard Xi Youqin's voice resonating from the Illusion Space, he immediately glanced over at Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie looked away and cursed in a darkly muttered voice, "Shameless!"</p>

  <p>Preston felt a faint smile spread on his face. He had lived for so many years. How could he not understand this situation?</p>

  <p>Since even the Saint Lord of their sacred place was certain that Ning Yudie was Luo Zheng's wife, then Mu Ning would most likely be his concubine. Also, from the looks of the situation, Luo Luo Zheng might not even have told Ning Yudie about Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, who was originally walking tall on the Heaven Earth Board, nearly staggered when he heard Xi Youqin's intimate cry in front of the assembled audience.</p>

  <p>At this moment, he was only 300 feet away from Norvin, so he covered his distraction by speeding forward. The previous battles had set the tone of the contest, and Luo Luo Zheng would not disappoint the audience by failing to beat his opponent.</p>

  <p>Nathan had used his palm strike to annihilate Norvin.</p>

  <p>The Otherworldly Swordsman had used his sword strike to hack Norvin to death.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was a pride man and didn't want to lag behind.</p>

  <p>With this sudden increase in speed, the dragon scales' power within his body began to rapidly effervesce.</p>

  <p>'One used a palm strike, and one used a sword strike? Then I shall kill him with one punch!' Luo Luo Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>Puff! Puff! Puff!</p>

  <p>The closer he drew to Norvin, the faster Luo Luo Zheng moved. The dragon scales' power that continued to pour from his right fist became more majestic and intensified with killing intent.</p>

  <p>"Do you think that Luo Luo Zheng can also deal with Norvin in one move?"</p>

  <p>"No, I don't think so. Someone has already started to take bets. The odds of a single move against the enemy is one to four hundred! It is so high!</p>

  <p>The possibility of that is definitely too small..."</p>

  <p>"I don't think that's possible either. I don't know how strong Luo Luo Zheng is, but Norvin has lost his courage after being defeated twice already. He has chosen to defend himself this time, instead of attacking. But who knows, maybe his strength is even stronger than Luo Zheng's!"</p>

  <p>"Besides, Luo Luo Zheng has given Norvin enough time to prepare. He still wants to kill him with one move? In his dreams!"</p>

  <p>From their point of view, Luo Luo Zheng had truly amassed quite a bit of strength, though he had come out of nowhere.</p>

  <p>They thought he was only of roughly the same strength as a few ace talents from the large clans, but when compared to Nathan, Lawson, and Lucille, there still seemed to be a large gap.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Luo Luo Zheng was oblivious to the thoughts and comments of those watching from the sidelines. He didn't care about those things either.</p>

  <p>If one punch wasn't enough to kill his opponent, then he would use two punches. If two punches didn't work, then three punches...</p>

  <p>As for Norvin, he had indeed lost his will to fight. He cowered and didn't even dare to fight back.</p>

  <p>Once he fought back, it would mean that he would have to reveal his flaws, and once he did so, it was very likely that he would continue to make the same mistake again and be defeated by Luo Zheng's single move. This was the last thing he wanted.</p>

  <p>Therefore, at this moment, he was completely on the defensive.</p>

  <p>Although this perfect but cowardly defense was very humiliating, he used it since he was truly afraid of being crushed. Even though he might lose again, he didn't want to lose in just one move again!</p>

  <p>As he watched Luo Zheng's punch come crashing down on him, he hurriedly beat a retreat while fiercely defending himself.</p>

  <p>"Tear him apart! Norvin, you are the ace talent of our ogre race. How can you be so cowardly?"</p>

  <p>"That brat did not even put his life vitality into that punch. What are you afraid of?"</p>

  <p>"I think Norvin shouldn't have been chosen to participate in the Illusion Battlefield this time."</p>

  <p>As this scene spread to the outside world, it made countless ogre warriors turn sour and restless, and they all angrily scolded Norvin.</p>

  <p>In the midst of these curses, Luo Luo Zheng had already moved closer. No matter how fast Norvin retreated, he could never be faster than Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng's similarly unremarkable punch broke through Norvn's defenses and landed on his arm, Norvin's expression changed. At this moment, Norvin didn't know who to curse anymore, and contemplating surrender, he could only curse the heavens for his misfortune.</p>
