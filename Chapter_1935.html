<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Valley of Time was usually the last stop for foreign martial artists in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>Time here had been compressed evenly. There were almost no fluctuations at all. More importantly, the vitality between heaven and earth was in a calm state.</p>

  <p>That was the reason why most people would try to break through their bottleneck here.</p>

  <p>In fact, those who entered the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land were either top talents from the universes or elite martial artists from the divine land. All of them were gifted in martial arts, and they could easily break through their current cultivation level, a feat that was insurmountable for most ordinary warriors.</p>

  <p>After those Godly Geniuses left other cultivation sacred places, they entered the Valley of Time one by one and began a year-long cultivation in seclusion.</p>

  <p>The valley was beautiful and quiet. The Dragon Flyer race had created a special incense using their secret skill. This incense had the ability to calm the soul and as it continued to burn, its fragrance would spread throughout the valley.</p>

  <p>In this valley, caves of varying shapes and sizes existed. The highest, most powerful caves had a time compression of around 80 times; the middle ones had a time compression of 50 times; and the lowest ones had a time compression of 20 times.</p>

  <p>Since this place maintained a stable time flow rate all year round, naturally, it would be impossible to recreate the scenario Luo Luo Zheng experienced: time compression that had reached a terrifying rate of thirty million times. After all, maintaining such a high rate was strenuous, even for Holy Jay.</p>

  <p>After the Godly Geniuses left other cultivation places, the Dragon Flyer race's prophet invited them to the Valley of Time. The Godly Geniuses then began their year of secluded cultivation. Of course, they did that in the valley's best caves.</p>

  <p>This move caused many groups of martial artists from the divine land to get angry and become indignant. They didn't understand why the Dragon Flyer race had given such preferential treatment to a group of outsiders.</p>

  <p>"Secondary creatures," some described them.</p>

  <p>It was a very quiet year.</p>

  <p>Since time in those caves was compressed by eighty times, a month's time outside of it would mean that seven years had already passed inside.</p>

  <p>Before that, the Godly Geniuses had already accumulated a lot of experience through many trials in the sacred places. Coupled with several skills they had inherited from the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, they were able to cultivate their own unique characteristics to their highest level.</p>

  <p>But the ones who had the fastest breakthroughs were Tianming and Nathan!</p>

  <p>They were able to go from the Spirit Supreme Realm to the Spirit Transformation Realm within the first month. Nathan even took less time than it took Tianming to complete the process.</p>

  <p>After breaking through, Nathan left the cave to ask about the other Godly Geniuses' situation. When he heard that he was the first one to step into the Spirit Transformation Realm, he felt pleased with himself. In his heart, he proudly thought that he was the strongest amongst the Godly Geniuses.</p>

  <p>After the two broke through, they only left their caves for a day of rest before continuing their cultivation. As a day passed outside, they spent two and a half months in the cave. Their goal was to become a world lord, so they had to utilize every second they had inside the cave.</p>

  <p>Xenia was the next to break through to the Spirit Transformation Realm.</p>

  <p>She was able to do it in the third month, and she became the third Godly Genius who was able to reach this realm.</p>

  <p>When the fourth month came, in addition to Luo Luo Zheng, all the other Godly Geniuses were able to reach the Spirit Transformation Realm.</p>

  <p>The process of going from the Soul Sea Realm to the Spirit Supreme Realm and then the Spirit Transformation Realm meant that one was expanding his or her inner world.</p>

  <p>After a warrior entered the Soul Sea Realm, his or her inner world would constantly expand, continuously forming many laws.</p>

  <p>The key reason why Luo Luo Zheng had his breakthrough after other Godly Geniuses already had theirs was because of others' Pristine Life Vitality.</p>

  <p>The other Godly Geniuses had absorbed a massive amount of Pristine Life Vitality from the Skyland race. This sort of special life vitality could cause a martial artist's inner world to become even more stable, and could also greatly benefit them as they tried to break through to the next realm.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Zheng's body was filled with chaotic energy, which was an energy that was denser than the life vitality, breaking through to the Spirit Transformation Realm was much more difficult for him.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng had fully utilized his chaotic energy's special properties. During the fifth month? that was almost thirty-five years for him? he continuously devoured the vitality between heaven and earth that was available in the place he was in and skillfully transformed it into chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>Although the efficiency of this transformation was low, it was still progressing step by step. On the last day of the fifth month, Luo Luo Zheng finally broke through to the Spirit Transformation Realm.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's inner world had undergone a tremendous change.</p>

  <p>It had nearly doubled in size, and the World Tree in it had already grown to a height of ten thousand feet. The Heavenly Spirit race on the World Tree had already become an extremely large race.</p>

  <p>As for the Howe Clan and the Totem Clan, they had already become two divine kingdoms. Some of their members had even reached the Virtual Tribulation Realm and the Life and Death Realm.</p>

  <p>Also, a peculiar kind of ice silkworm had grown from the ice tree. This kind of ice silkworm looked like a transparent block of ice. It was virtually indestructible if it was on the tree, but once it left, it would immediately melt. As for what it could evolve to, Luo Luo Zheng had no idea.</p>

  <p>According to the three-year agreement, he still had seven months? about fifty years for him left. Whether or not he would become a world lord, he wasn't too confident.</p>

  <p>The other Godly Geniuses all had predecessors who had paved a good path. They only needed to rely on their talent to run on the road. As for Luo Luo Zheng who practiced the Primal Chaos Technique, he had been on his own.</p>

  <p>His path was filled with hardships and problems that could not be solved by mere talent.</p>

  <p>To become a world lord, the martial artist had to turn their body into a world. That meant that his or her inner world must expand to become a great world.</p>

  <p>This path had already been walked by countless creatures. Every world lord was the ruler of a great world, but whether the Primal Chaos Technique would help Luo Luo Zheng to expand his inner world and to turn it into a great world was a question that still didn't have an answer.</p>

  <p>But when Luo Luo Zheng reached the Spirit Transformation Realm, his inner world changed drastically.</p>

  <p>As the World Tree that he planted grew, its top began to shoot upwards.</p>

  <p>Its roots, however, were deeply rooted at the bottom of the sea of chaotic energy!</p>

  <p>Those roots continued to extend downwards, and they finally broke through Luo Zheng's inner world!</p>

  <p>This kind of thing was prohibited to ordinary martial artists.</p>

  <p>The World Tree in the inner world was like a magic cudgel that could stable a sea. It could store life vitality. If an ordinary martial artist were to plant a World Tree, then his or her life vitality would increase by half as much as that of an average martial artist.</p>

  <p>However, no one would let the World Tree's trunk extend outside of their inner world because, which meant that their cinnabar fields would be penetrated, which would bring great damage to a martial artist!</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the roots of the World Tree were extremely tough. It was like a tiny seed that could forcefully grow against a rock.</p>

  <p>Therefore, if a martial artist owned a World Tree, they would always make sure that they would prune its roots.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng allowed the World Tree to grow as it pleased. In the end, the roots stubbornly pierced through his inner world.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's inner world was not his true inner world. His inner world was actually in chaos. It only established an unfathomable link with Luo Luo Zheng through the Cross-world Theurgy.</p>

  <p>After the roots of the World Tree reached the bottom of Luo Zheng's inner world, it continued growing and even extended into the chaos!</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng discovered this, instead of being alarmed, he became very interested.</p>

  <p>The Primal Chaos Technique was not a complete cultivation method and had never been reviewed by anyone. When Luo Zheng's master, who was called Bromley by Holy Jay, wrote it, he admitted that it was his idea but said that he could not guarantee how far this cultivation method could help the martial artist that would use it.</p>

  <p>The biggest flaw of the Primal Chaos Technique was that it was hard to replenish the chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>Both the universes and the divine land were filled with vitality between heaven and earth. A martial artist could freely absorb it or replenish it with life vitality crystals. It was the way martial artists practiced and survived.</p>

  <p>And where could Luo Luo Zheng go to find the chaotic energy?</p>

  <p>Previously, Luo Luo Zheng had come up with an alternative plan? use the characteristics of the Heavenly Ogre Fist he had practiced in the past to endow the chaotic energy with the ability to devour things. However, it was not efficient nor enough to transform the life vitality he was devouring to chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>This was also the reason why Luo Zheng's speed at breaking through to the Spirit Transformation Realm was slower than the other Godly Geniuses.</p>

  <p>But when the World Tree penetrated his inner world and extended its roots into endless chaos, Luo Luo Zheng knew that it opened up a brand new path!</p>

  <p>"It is said that the four divine trees in the divine land could absorb chaotic energy. If that is the case, then this World Tree will also become the divine tree of my inner world!" Luo Luo Zheng murmured in excitement.</p>

  <p>Before, he thought that he had a small chance of becoming a world lord.</p>

  <p>But now, he was filled with confidence. Being able to absorb a huge amount of chaotic energy was the foundation of his confidence.</p>
