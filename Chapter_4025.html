<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4025 Another Accident </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Gianni's wail echoed for a few seconds. At last, the black giant had finally collapsed.</p>

  <p>Its huge body completely disappeared, and a human-shaped coral slowly descended from midair. When it reached the ground, its armor and spear fell off with a loud clatter.</p>

  <p>Everyone stared at the human-shaped coral uneasily.</p>

  <p>Could this be Luo Zheng?</p>

  <p>Not long after, strands of tissue and muscle started to grow on the human-shaped coral.</p>

  <p>They intertwined with each other to form muscles and bones, and then layers of flesh rapidly formed, till finally the human-shaped coral transformed back into Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>When she realized it was indeed Luo Zheng, the Snake Goddess sighed in relief.</p>

  <p>Just now, she had been so nervous that she didn't realize she was holding her breath. Now, she could rest easy.</p>

  <p>The three Eternal Realm Hunters' jaws dropped in shock. They could not understand what was going on.</p>

  <p>They had seen many unique and magical creatures in their time, but they had never encountered such a powerful creature with such a strange form.</p>

  <p>Campbell was the first to step forward.</p>

  <p>Back then, on the Whining Road, he had instinctively chosen Luo Zheng's physical body because he had a feeling that Luo Zheng was stronger than the people around him.</p>

  <p>After awakening, Campbell knew he made the right choice. After all, Luo Zheng was a talent who could be chosen to enter the Eternal Divine Courtyard.</p>

  <p>However, even now Campbell kept discovering that he constantly underestimated Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's bloodline power must've been far stronger than he ever imagined.</p>

  <p>"Your ability comes from the life quadrant of the ancestry-level bloodline, right? Such a powerful recovery ability may be the combination of several abilities in the life quadrant. You might even be a general of the Ten Directions House!" Campbell exclaimed excitedly.</p>

  <p>In his eyes, the generals of the Ten Directions House were invincible.</p>

  <p>And it was true. No matter what trouble the world builders encountered, as long as the Ten Directions House sent their generals out, there was no problem that couldn't be solved.</p>

  <p>This was also the reason why Campbell was so respectful to Gianni.</p>

  <p>"The life quadrant?" Luo Zheng thought for a moment. "Maybe..."</p>

  <p>When he was enveloped in the red light, he felt the ancestry-level bloodline surging within him.</p>

  <p>The ancestry-level bloodline was not under Luo Zheng's control. At the beginning, it analyzed the information contained in the fluctuation and passed it to him.</p>

  <p>When he came into contact with any energy, the ancestry-level bloodline would also analyze it and then gave him the energy to restrain it.</p>

  <p>However, over time, the ancestry-level bloodline started to become cold to him. Now, if it wasn't a fatal threat, it wouldn't offer any help.</p>

  <p>Just now, Luo Zheng fought the black giant head on because he wanted to activate the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>Campbell didn't ask Luo Zheng more questions about his bloodline. He turned around and looked at the other Pure Sky Platform. "But what on earth has General Gianni gone through? Why has he become so violent? Why is he so intent on throwing me back to the Whining Road?"</p>

  <p>"The situation must be more complicated than you think," Luo Zheng said with a shrug.</p>

  <p>On the Pure Sky Platform in the distance, Gianni was freed from the extreme pain, and his face darkened.</p>

  <p>Campbell had awakened by accident, which was why Gianni rushed over.</p>

  <p>However, that wasn't the only accident that happened. A lowly human had managed to kill a resentment-level Treacherous Being! How inconceivable!</p>

  <p>The Human Spirit Sect and the Ten Directions House always welcomed extraordinary talents, which was also the foundation for their growth.</p>

  <p>However, some human spirits, like Gianni, looked down upon the human beings from the secondary worlds. In their eyes, although these human beings had inherited their looks and were very close to them in many aspects, they were still inferior.</p>

  <p>And yet, that human was able to not only kill a resentment-level Treacherous Being, but also was reborn unharmed! How did he do it? What magic did he use?</p>

  <p>A mass of black material floated up from the Pure Sky Platform where Luo Zheng and his companions were.</p>

  <p>It was a remaining part of the black giant.</p>

  <p>Then, the black material changed shape in accordance with Gianni's hand movements. Soon, it formed the shape of Gianni's head.</p>

  <p>The head was about the same size as an ordinary head, and the aura of Treacherous Being contained within it was very weak.</p>

  <p>The space of the Three Purities Stage was very special. Both energies and materials would disappear after they left the Pure Sky Platforms. Sounds worked similarly. Thus, this was the only way Gianni could use to transmit his voice.</p>

  <p>"How many light pillars have you triggered in the Eternal Divine Courtyard? Which light pillars are they?" Gianni asked.</p>

  <p>The ancestry-level bloodline had three hundred and seventy-three abilities, and they could combine with each other to create many other abilities. The Four Spirits Sect had studied the ancestry-level bloodline for such a long time, but they were still unable to completely figure out its abilities.</p>

  <p>The ability that Luo Zheng had displayed was very powerful, so Gianni wanted to figure it out.</p>

  <p>"Sorry, I can't tell you that," Luo Zheng replied bluntly.</p>

  <p>Gianni's expression hardened. "Aren't you afraid of death?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe," Luo Zheng replied honestly.</p>

  <p>Gianni's expression softened at his words. "You are of great value to us. I can spare your life, but you have to kill everyone else."</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Campbell raised his eyebrows indignantly.</p>

  <p>The others couldn't understand what Gianni was saying, but seeing Campbell's expression made them nervous.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng restrained his temper. With a smile, he asked, "Us? Who do you refer to? The Ten Directions House? Or the Human Spirit Sect?"</p>

  <p>"You don't need to know too much. Just do as I say," Gianni said dismissively.</p>

  <p>"Sorry, I'm not interested." With that, Luo Zheng summoned the long spear in his hand and pointed it at Gianni's head.</p>

  <p>"Wait, wait!" Gianni said hurriedly. He didn't expect Luo Zheng would suddenly turn hostile.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng didn't give him a chance to finish his words.</p>

  <p>The Light of Annihilation had pierced through the floating head and it burst into a cloud of smoke.</p>

  <p>The long spear then flashed and pointed straight at the opposite Pure Sky Platform. Luo Zheng smiled faintly.</p>

  <p>What he was interested in was Gianni's background. Since Gianni didn't want to tell him, there was no need for them to keep talking.</p>

  <p>Gianni's eyes were filled with rage. He never thought Luo Zheng would attack him like that. This made him feel like he'd been fooled, and it was a lowly human who was fooling him!</p>

  <p>"Contact the people of the Joy House and ask them to help!" Gianni ordered in a low voice.</p>

  <p>A brown shadow appeared beside him. It was a kind of Treacherous Being that could transmit messages.</p>

  <p>The surface of the Treacherous Being flashed for a while, and then it said,</p>

  <p>"Master Gianni, the people of the Joy House said they can't help right now.</p>

  <p>The Treasure Bottle Platform is being attacked."</p>

  <p>"How dare they attack the Treasure Bottle Platform?" Gianni shouted indignantly.</p>

  <p>"Even the Black House has rushed there, as the Joy House asked for help," said the Treacherous Being. "They are determined. They all want to obtain the energy that was extracted."</p>

  <p>Gianni's expression darkened.</p>
