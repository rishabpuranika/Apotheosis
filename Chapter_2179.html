  <p>When the short halberd hit the invisible barrier, the sky above the Heavenly Han House began transforming into an illusion of colors, as if various colors of inks had been dropped into water and were now bleeding and intertwining together.</p>

  <p>Just as the Han Clan disciple had said, the restrictive power over the Heavenly Han House was actually an enchanted barrier that had been created by borrowing the Thousand Commandments Slate's power.</p>

  <p>This said barrier completely covered the sky above the Heavenly Han House. Generally speaking, the barrier wasn't visible to the naked eye. In fact, nobody was capable of seeing it unless there was an enemy attack? then the barrier would activate itself!</p>

  <p>However, warriors who were qualified to fight in the Six-Burden Divine City were top-rank True Gods, at the very least. True Gods on Master Evil's level were considered powerless against the Thousand Commandments Slate.</p>

  <p>Two divine eras had already passed since the last time the barrier had activated itself due to an enemy attack.</p>

  <p>Everyone in the Heavenly Han House, including the True Gods and the proving godly warriors, all stared blankly at the sky. Only a few of the True Gods who had lived for a long time already had seen the barrier being triggered in the past. This though, was the first time the young warriors witnessed such a wondrous scene!</p>

  <p>"Oh gosh!"</p>

  <p>When Malloy noticed the flowing, blending lights, he suddenly remembered something important and his expression changed at once.</p>

  <p>At the same time, he spun his head to the side and roared, "Elder Chen!</p>

  <p>Hurry up! Use the Veto Token! I'll give you a new one later!"</p>

  <p>The True Gods of the Heavenly Han House, including the old man surnamed Wu, had gathered together on a small corner of the land. Every one of these True Gods was equally paying close attention to each of Luo Zheng's movements.</p>

  <p>"Tell me, was it truly this young man who taught you the technique of breaking the Five-element Divine Dao limitations?" asked a True God.</p>

  <p>Master Wu nodded his head, "At the time, I couldn't think of any other way to repay him, so I only gave him a White Jade Token. I never expected that he'd ever really have the strength to join the Heavenly Han House, so originally, I had the intention of compensating him with other treasures. That said though, his strength surpassed everyone's possible expectations!"</p>

  <p>As Master Wu spoke, the other True Gods heard Malloy's voice coming from the other side.</p>

  <p>Elder Chen, the person that Malloy was speaking to, was the True God who was considered to have the most experience and prestige in the Heavenly Han House.</p>

  <p>As Elder Chen heard Malloy's words, his expression quickly changed as well. He too was reminded of something important that had otherwise been overlooked by everyone!</p>

  <p>Beneath the cover of the Thousand Commandments Slate, nobody in the entire Six-Burden Divine City had the permission to fight. Here, any powerful energy fluctuation could lead to the Thousand Commandments Slate's punishment.</p>

  <p>Despite this cover, during the Heavenly Han House test, the rules of the place were much more lenient. Thus, the concerned proving godly warriors were capable of extracting their life vitality from their inner world and throwing the White Jade Token into the sky without the risk of suffering the slate's punishment.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, on the other hand, threw the short halberd so high up into the air that it struck the barrier covering the sky. Such a powerful act was equivalent to triggering the barrier! Although the blow from the short halberd hitting the barrier wasn't enormous, it was still recognized by the Thousand Commandments Slate as an invasion signal. Hence, the barrier launched its highest-level counterattack.</p>

  <p>The Thousand Commandments Slate was of extreme power. If it were to attack with all its strength, even Malloy would be burnt to ashes.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng's strength and talent were excellent, there was no way in hell he'd withstand such a powerful attack. He would be eliminated in seconds!</p>

  <p>Never in the past had there been a proving godly warrior who could throw the White Jade Token to a height of 990 feet!</p>

  <p>Even a mid-rank True God would find it difficult to accomplish such a feat, let alone a proving godly warrior. This was due to the fact that, at the height over 900 feet, the restrictive power doubled every 10 feet. As the multiple continued to increase, by the time it reached 990 feet in height, the restrictive power within the space became extremely terrifying.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng had clearly managed to do so, and this had astonished Malloy to the greatest extent. In his perspective, Luo Luo Zheng was probably on par with the geniuses of the Floating Islands. Luo Luo Zheng was the proving godly warrior with the most powerful strength that Malloy had ever seen.</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng really did die from the Thousand Commandments Slate's punishment, Malloy would probably regret the latter until his own death.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>At the center of the Six-Burden Divine City, a cyan slate could be seen floating in the air. On the slate were a thousand rules written in small, golden words. These golden words were personally handwritten by the Holy Emperor of the Han Clan, and these rules had been set long ago by the ancestors of the clan.</p>

  <p>Any time someone violated the rules of the Thousand Commandments Slate, the small golden words would begin to shine brightly.</p>

  <p>Right now, the words of a paragraph located in the middle of the slate began to flicker with light.</p>

  <p>At the same time, a sliver of lightning suddenly appeared above the slate.</p>

  <p>As the lightning continued to circle in the air, it slowly began to condense itself, finally forming a small ball of lightning.</p>

  <p>As the golden words continued flickering with light on the slate, the ball of lightning rapidly grew in size. From no bigger than a closed fist, it quickly became the size of a house!</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>The outer layer of the lightning ball was a deep shade of indigo, while the inner layer was midnight black. This pitch black layer contained the thunder tribulation's ultimate power.</p>

  <p>Once the lightning ball was completely formed, it flew straight toward the Heavenly Han House, leaving nothing behind except a terrifying series of rumbling thunder in the air!</p>
