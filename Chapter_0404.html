<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 404 Extremely Arrogant (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The competition between Jacques and Stanley wasn't so thrilling. Most of it was pretty boring since Jacques was overwhelmingly superior to Stanley in every aspect and dominated him every step of the showdown.</p>

  <p>There was little Stanley could do to protect himself against Jacques.</p>

  <p>However, that did not mean that the elites of all the thirty three peaks and all the personal disciples present ignored the fight. Instead, they observed it carefully.</p>

  <p>It was worth noting though, that the majority of them focused their attention on Jacques and did not care what happened to Stanley.</p>

  <p>Three years ago, Jacques had become one of the top 100 warriors when he was just at grade two of the nature level, landing him in the list of legends of the Cloud Sect. Although Luo Luo Zheng had already broken his record now, no one dared to ignore Jacques and his strength.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Jacques had retreated to practice for three years and he was at the Illuminating Soul Realm at present. No one had seen him fighting over the three years, and no one knew how powerful he was now. That was the reason why those elites and personal disciples paid a lot attention to Jacques, who was one of their potential opponents.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Stanley was defeated so fast that Jacques only had a chance to show off his incomparably sturdy armor.</p>

  <p>But the set of white bone armor he was wearing was already strong enough to attract all elites and personal disciples' attention. Its defensive ability was comparable to a common fairy weapon, which could resist almost all damage inflicted upon it. Jacques, hidden and protected in the armor, could definitely win the competition, especially considering the fact that if the white bone armor couldn't be broken by his opponent, then there was no way to inflict damage directly upon him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, standing outside the battlefield, also paid attention to Jacques all the time, but he believed that he had a few countermeasures in his pocket to attack the white bone armor. Though the armor looked completely impenetrable, there were means such as the soul attack and flying knife which could break it. He was thinking that the flying knife with its sharp and penetrative tip might be strong enough to crack the white bone armor. There was also the rather strong fear and belief that the white bone armor wasn't Jacques's only ace in the hole. The only way to learn more about Jacques was in a fight itself.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng knew it wasn't easy to climb to the head of the list in the All Peaks Competition. Jacques wasn't necessarily the strongest of the personal disciples, but was already too powerful to be defeated easily. In addition, he had to compete with all the elite contestants from every single peak if he wanted to be the first.</p>

  <p>Even though it was extremely difficult to compete with those disciples of great power, Luo Luo Zheng was utterly indomitable. And instead of being the least afraid, he was immersed in a contradictory state of mind that was both exciting and calm. The thrill of the chase helped enhance his sense of fighting and kept him excited, and the calmness he possessed could help him assess his opponents clearly. Only when he was calm could he win a fight easily.</p>

  <p>The round-robin competition came one after another.</p>

  <p>Due to the participation of personal disciples this time, the round-robin phase was several times fiercer than the group phase. The contest between elites from every peak and the personal disciples was known to be one of the most wonderful and terrible attractions.</p>

  <p>In the Cloud Sect, the status of the personal disciples was undoubtedly much higher than anyone else present. However, only a few lucky ones who were chosen by the elders and saints of the Cloud Sect had the chance to become their personal disciples.</p>

  <p>And since it was considered bad form, they didn't show their discontentment on the surface, but in reality, they were always resentful of the personal disciples. 'Personal disciple? So what? Even the normal disciples of our thirty three peaks can also punch your shining teeth through the back of your skull. Doesn't matter that we don't have personal teachers, we are undefeatable!' the other disciples always thought in their mind. Therefore, the vast majority of disciples hoped that the personal disciples would lose in the competitions.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, these personal disciples were always superior to the inner disciples, and it was really tough for even the elites to stay in a fight with them and beat them. In the previous four competitions, three elite inner disciples had been defeated badly by these personal disciples.</p>

  <p>When it was the time for the fifth competition, the referee announced,</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng from the Drizzle Peak against the personal disciple, Vale!"</p>

  <p>Vale?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's brows frowned tightly as soon as he heard the name. Vale!</p>

  <p>Vale had tried to force Luo Luo Zheng to kneel down to him with great power on the day he had gone to the Hell Mountain! However, Luo Luo Zheng had taken advantage of the strength of the dragon scales and his strong physical body to hold the pressure, and the Heavenly Ogre Fist had burst upon him under that enormous pressure!</p>

  <p>But even if Luo Luo Zheng had comprehended the Heavenly Ogre Fist at that time, he was no match for Vale at all. It wasn't to be forgotten that Vale had reached the Illuminating Soul Realm at that time and Luo Luo Zheng wasn't even a nature creature!</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Mu Ning had come to help Luo Luo Zheng out of danger in time, otherwise his fate wasn't hard to imagine.</p>

  <p>That was only one of the reasons why Luo Luo Zheng was angry. What made him even more annoyed was that Vale didn't want to beat him but actually wanted to be together with his sister, Yan!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng gradually unlocked his frowned brows at this thought and assigned a cold look to his face instead. He had never worn such an expression on his face ever since taking part in the All Peaks Competition.</p>

  <p>Standing next to Luo Luo Zheng, both Master Wen and Yehudi noticed that Luo Luo Zheng didn't look good. After being together with Luo Luo Zheng for a while, they now knew clearly Luo Luo Zheng would never look cold no matter how strong his opponent was, and he would never concede the competition to anyone, not even the personal disciples. So, they guessed that there was something behind Luo Zheng's change of expression.</p>

  <p>"Are you okay, Luo Luo Zheng?" Yehudi asked carefully.</p>

  <p>With a brilliant smile on his face, Luo Luo Zheng replied, "I'm fine. I'm just in a bad mood, and I want to kick someone's ass right now."</p>

  <p>"Kick someone's ass?" Yehudi repeated and gave a gasp of surprise at what he had just heard. He then turned around and looked at the empty battlefield. It seemed that Luo Zheng's opponent hadn't come out yet.</p>

  <p>"Yes!" Luo Luo Zheng replied in a firm tone. Keeping cold expression of his face constantly, Luo Luo Zheng walked towards the battlefield step by step.</p>

  <p>Vale wasn't at the scene of the All Peaks Competition, and he didn't show up until it was his turn to fight.</p>
