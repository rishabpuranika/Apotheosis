  <p>
</p>

  <p>Geoffrey was greatly interested in the vast Source World. Zheng had promised him that once he became a consummate True God, he would allow him to leave.</p>

  <p>The powerful warriors he would encounter in the outside world were unmatched compared to those he met in Zheng's inner world. He needed more strength to go further into the Source World.</p>

  <p>His father had told him that the Regal Jade Spirit was one of the strongest warriors in the chaos, piquing his interest.</p>

  <p>"We have a deal," replied the Regal Jade Spirit.</p>

  <p>Soon after, the dispersed Blood Essence Power slowly gathered and formed the Sanskrit word once again.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey wasn't eager to decipher it— he did it after Zheng had already copied it on the paper.</p>

  <p>But something unusual happened— the word formed by the Blood Essence Power dissipated once he began deciphering the copied word on the paper.</p>

  <p>"What's going on?" Zheng asked with furrowed brows.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey was deciphering the Sanskrit word on paper— why was the one formed by Blood Essence Power still dissipating?</p>

  <p>"Quite an interesting reaction," said the Regal Jade Spirit, seemingly unbothered. "No matter when and where you decipher a copy of this word, the Blood Essence Power will dissipate rapidly, even if it's half a chaos away."</p>

  <p>To decipher it, the Regal Jade Civilization had gone through painstaking efforts. But it was all in vain apart from how they gained a thorough understanding of its nature.</p>

  <p>Gripping the copy firmly in his hands, Geoffrey levitated, deep in thought.</p>

  <p>The two Sanskrit words of the Truth Enlightenment were known to be highly complex, but this one seemed to be the extreme opposite— it was almost too simple.</p>

  <p>When it came to these words, though, the simpler they were, the more difficult it was to judge and decipher— there were countless possible meanings behind a simple word.</p>

  <p>For most decipherers, such a situation meant a dead end. But Geoffrey was rather exceptional.</p>

  <p>After five minutes passed, Geoffrey rolled the paper in his hands as his lips curled up into a smile.</p>

  <p>"Did you pick up any clues?" Zheng asked, his brows raised at the other's expression.</p>

  <p>"Even better— I've deciphered it," he responded proudly.</p>

  <p>Both Zheng and the Regal Jade Spirit were shocked and wide-eyed. "How is that possible…"</p>

  <p>"Nothing is impossible," Geoffrey said, pursing his lips. "But it records a mere sentence— there is very little information in this word."</p>

  <p>"What does it mean?"</p>

  <p>"What information?"</p>

  <p>The other two eagerly asked after him.</p>

  <p>While it was possible that Geoffrey was fooling them, the two still hoped to gain some information, no matter how minute.</p>

  <p>"The Element Spirit Civilization has committed despicable theft— they stole the sacred fire, making the world grow cold and silent," he read, according to what he deciphered. Even he was confused by it. "What does that mean?"</p>

  <p>"The Element Spirit Civilization? Is that a ruling civilization?" Zheng questioned.</p>

  <p>But 'civilization' carried a broad definition.</p>

  <p>Several civilizations resided in Zheng's inner world. There were even signs of the developing human race forming different civilizations.</p>

  <p>If one could become the ruling civilization, such a group must be a hegemony in the chaos.</p>

  <p>Even Zheng himself didn't know exactly what the Element Spirit Civilization was— it was less likely that Geoffrey knew of it. Now that the two were certain that Geoffrey wasn't deceiving them, they thought hard about the deciphered sentence.</p>

  <p>"The Element Spirit Civilization is the second ruling civilization," the Regal Jade Spirit said.</p>

  <p>"The second… that means it also appeared very early on," Zheng said, rather shocked.</p>

  <p>The first civilization was the Instant Civilization— it must have had some strong warriors who then became Chaos Ancient Gods in the second civilization. These two civilizations were closely linked.</p>

  <p>"That's right. The Instant Civilization was short in time while the Element Spirit Civilization had no form. In essence, they were both formed by energies that gathered," said the Regal Jade Spirit.</p>

  <p>When in the process of growing extremely powerful, some energies produced fire spirits, water spirits, and other creatures of different elements.</p>

  <p>These creatures had no physical form— such was what formed the Element Spirit race in the second chaos. This race stood out among the rest because they had many different kinds of elements.</p>

  <p>"It says that the Element Spirit race stole the sacred fire…but what is it?"</p>

  <p>Zheng asked again, still confused.</p>

  <p>"I'm not sure," muttered the Regal Jade Spirit. "It says that they made the world cold and silent— it perhaps refers to the chaos. The sacred fire must be another flaw in the Ways-blending Energy…"</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes lit up at that. "You mean…the flaw was taken away by this race?"</p>

  <p>"Most likely," the Regal Jade Spirit replied.</p>

  <p>"But what's the situation of the Element Spirit race now…" Zheng wondered, looking concerned.</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade Spirit only laughed and said, "This race is ranked third on the Other Shore. It's a powerful and ancient race that consistently dominates the upper stages."</p>

  <p>"So this civilization is truly very powerful…" Zheng frowned as he considered it. "If so, doesn't that mean that the other civilizations have no chance to climb up the stages?"</p>

  <p>"Let alone on the Other Shore, even everything in the Source World is the result of their deliberate plan. Those powerful races in the Source World are supported by the Chaos Ancient Gods, who are supported by the civilizations hiding on the Other Shore. The top-level masters in the Source World serve as mere spokespersons of the civilizations," explained the Regal Jade Spirit.</p>

  <p>"Spokespersons of the civilizations?!" Zheng was utterly shocked to hear such a thing.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 had told him that the Bearing race had a Chaos Ancient God to support them— they wouldn't have risen so fast otherwise. But to think that the Chaos Ancient Gods had relied on the civilizations from the Other Shore…it was truly inconceivable.</p>

  <p>"Did you really say that the top-level masters in the Source World are their spokespersons?" Zheng asked again in disbelief.</p>

  <p>"Yes," the Regal Jade Spirit affirmed. "The chaos has experienced many rounds of destruction and rebirth— the powerful civilizations have long since been skilled at the game. As soon as the chaos was born, they began planning."</p>

  <p>According to what the Regal Jade Spirit said, Eastern Emperor Taiyi also had a civilization behind him for support? And to think that the Snake Goddess and Fuxi were the same…</p>

  <p>While Zheng was lost in thought, the Regal Jade Spirit smiled and said, "Don't forget, you are now the spokesperson of our Regal Jade Civilization."</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade Civilization was once a powerful civilization that ranked among the top ten. But because they were hidden at Stage Thirteen, they didn't get much attention.</p>

  <p>"I see," Zheng nodded slightly. "So, to find the so-called sacred fire, I must find this Element Spirit Civilization?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, but you're not strong enough to do so right now…" The Regal Jade Spirit sighed and continued, "Even if it was Wing King who led us, it would be impossible for us to wage a war against the Element Spiritual race. The top three civilizations on the Other Shore are all as solid as rock in their positions. They have advantages, so the other civilizations couldn't possibly contend against them."</p>
