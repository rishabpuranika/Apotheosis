  <p>
</p>

  <p>Over a hundred Formless Sky Pythons were moving towards them, like huge mountain ranges closing in? it was a horrible scene.</p>

  <p>The massive creatures surged forward. It was as if a chaotic world was pouring down at the warriors.</p>

  <p>"What are you waiting for? Quickly now, run!"</p>

  <p>"There's no time left!"</p>

  <p>"We're waiting for death by staying here!"</p>

  <p>Some of the martial artists from the other races couldn't endure the ordeal. How could they possibly be willing to wait and die? After bypassing the black sphere, they fled in all directions.</p>

  <p>Though they were well aware there were all kinds of dangers in this interior world, it was better to flee than wait for their impending doom.</p>

  <p>But most of the martial artists of the other races hadn't left, including Luo Luo Zheng and the Han Clan warriors. The three great races hadn't left either, placing their hopes on Kaydan.</p>

  <p>"Let's go fight them!"</p>

  <p>Chapman roared.</p>

  <p>Several Collapsing Mountain warriors of the Divinity Hunt Squad shot out towards the Formless Sky Pythons as they moved in closer.</p>

  <p>The Collapsing Mountain warriors that had managed to enter the Divinity Hunt Squad were the race's strongest elites. Their power was beyond imagination.</p>

  <p>Dong, dong!</p>

  <p>Under their combined efforts, they managed to strike the first python down to the ground.</p>

  <p>"Follow me!"</p>

  <p>As Chapman gave his order, he rushed to the bottom of the Formless Sky Python that they struck down, placing both his shoulders under the scales of its midsection. It was an unbelievable sight? he actually wanted to lift the python on his own two shoulders.</p>

  <p>Chapman's body was much larger than that of ordinary humanoid creatures. But compared to the Formless Sky Python, he was like an ant in front of an elephant. His move was rather astonishing.</p>

  <p>Apart from Chapman, the members of the Divinity Hunt Squad joined in.</p>

  <p>With brutal force, the enormous Formless Sky Python was lifted.</p>

  <p>It kept wriggling, struggling its way off the warriors' shoulders. In spite of its size, it couldn't get out of the tiny warriors' control.</p>

  <p>"Throw it far out!" Chapman ordered.</p>

  <p>All the Divinity Hunt Squad warriors' veins popped out, and their muscles tensed, looking tougher than steel.</p>

  <p>In the past few years, they rarely met such dangerous situations in the Collapsing Mountain race, and rarely had they used their full strength to fight. But at this moment, they didn't have the luxury of holding back their strength in the slightest.</p>

  <p>As they exerted simultaneous effort, they forcibly threw the python out.</p>

  <p>The colossal creature then seemed like a log, rolling back towards its fellow pythons.</p>

  <p>Both sides carried an overwhelming amount of momentum. By throwing a Formless Sky Python at an army of pythons, the several warriors indeed delayed them a bit. But in the face of the pythons' charge, the lone one they managed to throw out was completely smashed.</p>

  <p>Boom, boom?</p>

  <p>Splash...</p>

  <p>After the python was broken into pieces, the blood from its body gushed like floodwater, splashing like a waterfall. The blood was probably enough to flood an entire continent.</p>

  <p>Being chased by so many of the pythons, the warriors present were scared out their wits, and their morale had lowered considerably.</p>

  <p id="top_1">But the Collapsing Mountain race's counterattack produced strong momentum, giving everyone some hope.</p>

  <p>The Harmony race and Skyland race had also organized their strongest counterattacks. Led by Kennan, even the world lords of the Han Clan attempted to contribute to the resistance.</p>

  <p>The combined efforts of hundreds of warriors formed a strong defensive line, potentially stopping the pythons.</p>

  <p>But their powers were too limited.</p>

  <p>The pythons weren't afraid of death. With the one goal to kill their enemies, the pythons rushed over. The line of defense lasted a mere moment until the Formless Sky Pythons launched another attack.</p>

  <p>"Are you done yet? Kaydan!" Chapman was roaring.</p>

  <p>The nagging made Kaydan frown as he firmly pressed the jade seal onto the black sphere. More and more lines appeared on its surface, gradually spreading on to the sphere's entire surface.</p>

  <p>"Almost!" Kaydan shouted back.</p>

  <p>In his hand was the Heavenly Jade Seal.</p>

  <p>It wasn't a genuine jade seal, but a sort of replica that Kaydan had made with his life vitality.</p>

  <p>A thousand years ago, the first time he entered the interior world, he had wandered off from the other warriors of the Skyland race and accidentally stumbled into a cave. On a stone platform within, he discovered a picture? a Contemplation Picture. In the picture was the Heavenly Jade Seal.</p>

  <p>Back then, Kaydan still felt excited, as though he had obtained some priceless treasure. So he kept the Contemplation Picture for himself.</p>

  <p>After a long period of contemplation, he managed to visualize the Heavenly Jade Seal with life vitality.</p>

  <p>Over the next few hundred years, Kaydan continued pondering on how the jade seal could be used.</p>

  <p>The interior world served as the foundation of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. Kayden believed that the Heavenly Jade Seal contained great secrets.</p>

  <p>But after pondering for hundreds of years, he still failed to figure out anything. Only when he entered the interior world for the second time did he unravel this secret.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Jade Seal allowed him to enter any one of the nine black spheres.</p>

  <p>But the solution to this mystery only led to more confusion.</p>

  <p>Once again, he searched for the cave atop a cliff somewhere in the interior world where he had found the Contemplation Picture before.</p>

  <p>After entering it again, he made his way to that very cliff, but there was no cave above it? it had completely disappeared.</p>

  <p>To find the cave, Kaydan almost shattered the cliff. But the cave was nowhere to be found as if it had never even existed in the first place.</p>

  <p>With Kaydan's impeccable memory, it was impossible for the cave to have been an illusion. It definitely existed before, but it must have been tampered with.</p>

  <p>When he thought about it more carefully, more doubts grew within him.</p>

  <p>He first found the cave because of a beautiful white fox. Such a strange beast didn't exist in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, so Kaydan couldn't recognize the creature. Only after he used his own memories to condense the white fox's image with his life vitality did the divine land martial artists help him dispel his doubts and told him about the white fox.</p>

  <p>It was because he was chasing after the white fox that he accidentally fell off the cliff and landed on an ancient pine tree in the middle section of the cliff. Coincidentally, he chanced upon the cave and obtained the Contemplation Picture.</p>

  <p>In other words, someone had it all planned, leading him all the way there.</p>

  <p>The purpose behind it, Kaydan still had no idea. All he knew was that after activating the black spheres, he could travel freely among the nine spheres. Only then did he discover that the nine black spheres were connected to each other.</p>

  <p>But there was nothing inside them.</p>

  <p>After exploring all the spheres, Kaydan was left disappointed. He had such high expectations for them, hoping he would find some sort of inheritance within the spheres. But in the end, it was all false hope.</p>

  <p>Even the Heavenly Jade Seal in his hand turned useless. Apart from being able to open up the black spheres, it seemed to have no other uses.</p>

  <p>Never did Kaydan expect to make use of the Heavenly Jade Seal under such circumstances. Now, this black sphere was their last hope.</p>

  <p>But time was running out? even though he was calm, more beads of sweat rolled down his temples. It wasn't something that could be rushed.</p>

  <p>All the warriors continued retreating? even Chapman looked fatigued.</p>

  <p>No matter how powerful the Collapsing Mountain race's strength was, it wasn't limitless. The Divinity Hunt Squad warriors' hands and legs were already shaking with exhaustion.</p>

  <p>The warriors from the Collapsing Mountain race had no choice but to retreat.</p>

  <p>"How long will this take?" Chapman roared again, "If you don't open it soon, we're all finished!"</p>

  <p>It was Kaydan's most critical moment? he focused all his energy into pouring life vitality into the black sphere, trying to speed it up.</p>

  <p>Soon, the Harmony race ended up retreating. The pressure weighing down on them was a huge psychological burden, slowly draining their energy.</p>

  <p>Having lost the support of the two great races, the Han Clan had no choice but to retreat.</p>

  <p>And with that, the defensive line they had built so carefully had fallen apart.</p>

  <p>Rumble?</p>

  <p>Over a hundred Formless Sky Pythons raised their thick heads, ready to launch their strongest wave of attacks.</p>

  <p>At this moment, everyone was filled with despair. Even if they wanted to escape, they couldn't avoid the pythons' attack. Seeing the terrifying mouths come down on them, the warriors were struck with fear.</p>

  <p>It was said that within the body of a Formless Sky Python lay a great space and no one could come out from it alive once they were devoured by the beasts.</p>

  <p>No one alive knew what the internal space of the Formless Sky Python was like.</p>

  <p>And no one was really willing to go in and explore. But now, it seemed like they had no choice.</p>

  <p>Seeing the Formless Sky Pythons lined up side by side, crushing down simultaneously, the warriors turned pale. It was like they could foresee their fate in the very next moment.</p>

  <p>Liusu's face fell. Subconsciously, she glanced at Luo Luo Zheng, catching him as he spread out his arms.</p>

  <p>A strange scene followed.</p>

  <p>When all the pythons had made it halfway towards them, they suddenly stopped? some kind of invisible force had blocked their path somehow.</p>

  <p>At least forty Formless Sky Pythons were piled up in front of the group.</p>

  <p>Such a large number of pythons pressing down had to be of tremendous weight? their individual bodies were already unimaginably heavy, in addition to the powerful inertia and impact they brought along as they descended from the sky.</p>

  <p>Just how much strength was enough to block them?</p>
