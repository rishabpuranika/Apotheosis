<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 913 Zheng's Decision </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The outbreak of the Tide of Chaos this time was an opportunity for Esther.</p>

  <p>However, the route she had planned was for the outer area of Dark Nether Cave.</p>

  <p>She wanted to explore new places that she thought would lead to great opportunities. Those places were originally inaccessible, but then, a path opened to these places after the Tide of Chaos arrived.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Fabian had the same thoughts.</p>

  <p>Even without the Tide of Chaos, being fully prepared to enter the inner area wasn't even something to think about at all, for the chances of survival in the inner area were simply too low.</p>

  <p>The danger level inside it even went worse now that the Tide of Chaos arrived. No one dared to enter the inner area nowadays.</p>

  <p>"Then let's enter the inner area," Zheng said in a serious tone, blinking his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Entering the inner area now is courting death!" Fabian replied.</p>

  <p>Zheng looked at the dense mass of monsters behind them and then gazed at the two Purgatory Fire Snakes that were coiling not far away. He shrugged his shoulders and said, "Staying here is courting death too."</p>

  <p>That made everyone upset. Only the strange women, Xun and Yolande, were able to retain their calm expressions.</p>

  <p>Zheng was actually right. Behind them was an overwhelming number of Swallowing Birds and Azure Wolves. There was no doubt that these monsters could tear them to shreds. The two Purgatory Fire Snakes there didn't look as powerful as the birds and wolves. However, it was also clear to Esther and Fabian that passing through those two snakes would not be safe.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, they had no choice.</p>

  <p>"Let's enter the inner area!" Esther immediately said in a stern voice after hesitating for a while.</p>

  <p>All of the top-level war lords present had grown up from killing and were very decisive at critical situations. Moreover, making a choice at this moment wasn't even that hard. There was no other safer choice but to enter the inner area. Escaping would be futile for them if they delayed their decisions any longer.</p>

  <p>The moment Esther's voice faded, everyone chose the right path and sprinted forward.</p>

  <p>The Swallowing Birds and Azure Wolves were getting closer and closer to them.</p>

  <p>"Speed up!"</p>

  <p>All of them sprinted towards the inner area with all their might.</p>

  <p>"They are coming!" someone exclaimed in terror. The thousands of Swallowing Birds were now hovering over them and began diving sharply.</p>

  <p>"Ahhh!"</p>

  <p>One of the war lords of Demon Night was drowned out by the Swallowing Birds and his miserable cries instantly stopped.</p>

  <p>The scene magnified everyone's terror to the extent that their hairs stood!</p>

  <p>They sped up their paces as much as they could.</p>

  <p>"We can't do this! I don't think we'll be able to break into the inner area,"</p>

  <p>Fabian complained.</p>

  <p>"We are so close! Let's charge in the inner area in one go!" Esther screamed back determinedly. Her eyes were focused on whatever was before her.</p>

  <p>There was a dividing line ahead of them and everyone could still make out what was outside that line. However, the area beyond that line looked grey.</p>

  <p>It was as if the whole world beyond that barrier was eaten by grey.</p>

  <p>The group of Swallowing Birds and Azure Wolves were rushing behind them again after feasting on the top-level war lord. The closest flock from them was only twenty to thirty feet away.</p>

  <p>"Hurry!"</p>

  <p>"We'll be safe once we rush in!"</p>

  <p>"Go for it!"</p>

  <p>Everyone encouraged each other.</p>

  <p>The black flock of Swallowing Birds swooped down and finally hovered over everyone. Some of them even opened their mouths and started devouring Zheng and the others.</p>

  <p>Immediate death awaited everyone since being caught by these birds would mean no survival.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>As Zheng sprinted forward, he spun and released the black flame in his forehead.</p>

  <p>It had been a long time since he had used his black flame. After all, he hadn't encountered anything as dangerous as this. He just ran out of choices.</p>

  <p>It was actually against his will to use his black flame and reveal it to the others.</p>

  <p>The wisp of black flame circled Zheng and then shot up into the sky.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Just like that, the wisp of black flame lightly flared up and instantly pierced through several dozens of Swallowing Birds. The birds' miserable shrieks echoed in the whole place.</p>

  <p>He killed at least fifty to sixty Swallowing Birds in an instant.</p>

  <p>Fabian and Jarrod had already witnessed the might of Zheng's black fire. Even the tongue of the Bull-like Giant Toad couldn't withstand the burning of the black flame, let alone these Swallowing Birds.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, all the other top-level war lords of the Demon Night and Esther were left with horrified expressions. What was this black flame? It was too fierce.</p>

  <p>Although the Swallowing Birds were afraid of fire, a normal fire wouldn't be enough to destroy them even if it stayed burning for two hours. It was a shock to everyone that the birds showed no resistance against Zheng's black flame at all. They just instantly burned to nothingness at the slightest contact.</p>

  <p>It was with that action that Zheng succeeded to create some leeway for everyone.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the space between them and the monsters wasn't that big.</p>

  <p>More so, these monsters weren't that smart too. Although they saw their companions killed, none of them understood the danger and still rushed to get closer to their prey, filling the distance between them in an instant.</p>

  <p>It was a miss by second! None of the birds was able to catch anyone since everyone had already passed through the dividing line successfully.</p>

  <p>Quack! Quack! Quack! Quack!</p>

  <p>The Swallowing Birds surged like a tidal wave against the dividing line but then ended up rolling back when they neared the line. These birds didn't dare enter that inner area again.</p>

  <p>Just like the Swallowing Birds, the Azure Wolves rushed to the side of the line and stopped in their tracks. Their eyes flickered dangerously as they stared at the group of creatures across the line. Some wolves howled as if they felt pity for Zheng and the others running away.</p>

  <p>Zheng stood in the grey area and turned his head to look at the monsters. He was gasping for air. Not only him, but even Esther, Fabian, and all the other top-level war lords were also heaving. The sprint they did almost took the best of them.</p>

  <p>Everyone rested for a while. The Azure Wolves and Swallowing Birds remained to block the path with no signs of leaving soon.</p>

  <p>"We will wait here. I don't believe that these monsters will stay here forever!" Jarrod sat down.</p>

  <p>He guessed that these monsters would eventually get tired of waiting. They could leave the inner area after the monsters left.</p>

  <p>Fabian and Esther also agreed with this plan. It was safer to stay on that spot than to enter the inner area any further.</p>

  <p>However, just as Zheng stepped into the inner area, he suddenly felt the space ring on his chest begin to heat up.</p>

  <p>Curious, he tried to check what was going on with his space ring. He poured his consciousness to it. But then he was suddenly startled by what he saw. A small butterfly was hovering around inside his space ring. It was beautiful but it was blazing in flames.</p>

  <p>"What's going on?"</p>

  <p>Of course, Zheng recognized it. This was the Jade Butterfly that Immortal Mist had given to him. According to Immortal Mist, with this Jade Butterfly, Zheng would be able to obtain the incomparably important inheritance in the Dark Nether Cave.</p>

  <p>He had been in the Dark Nether Cave for such a long time and all this while, this butterfly just remained staying there quietly with no reaction.</p>

  <p>It was only after he got into this place that the Jade Butterfly moved and worse, flared! From the looks of it, it seemed that the inheritance Immortal Mist had talked about was here in this place— the inner area.</p>

  <p>Fabian and the others were planning to stay there. They had decided to go back through the same route they used to come in. Obviously, none of them had any intention of exploring the inner area.</p>

  <p>Zheng actually agreed with their judgment. There was nothing more valuable for a warrior than his life after all. Everything would be nonsense if they lost their lives.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, he had never expected the Jade Butterfly to react to this place.</p>

  <p>Thus, he had no choice but to reconsider his thoughts. He was compelled to explore the inner area.</p>

  <p>Logically speaking, it wasn't a problem if Zheng would enter the Dark Nether Cave again next year. A year should be enough for him to become a top-level war lord. His Stellar Body would have probably matured by that time.</p>

  <p>More so, with the power of the Transcendent Divine Might, he might even be able to fight against a war sage.</p>

  <p>He would be more confident about entering the Dark Nether Cave by then.</p>

  <p>It was just that Zheng knew that he didn't have much time left.</p>

  <p>"You guys stay here." Zheng shot a glance at Esther and Fabian. "I want to continue exploring the inner area."</p>

  <p>With a flick of her spear, Xun silently followed behind Zheng. Yolande also followed them without saying a word.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Fabian and Esther were instantly worried about what they heard. They quickly sprinted before Zheng and blocked him. "Zheng, no matter what, I won't let you continue to barge in!" Fabian said firmly.</p>

  <p>Esther then knelt on one knee and said to Xun, "Queen, please think twice!"</p>
