<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1727 Another Heavenly Fragment </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>If Luo Zheng had only relied on the Magnetic Sacred Mountain, Nathan probably wouldn't have been at a disadvantage. But Luo Zheng cultivated the Ji Clan's secret technique.</p>

  <p>Nathan got a stifling feeling in his heart.</p>

  <p>First of all, he didn't specialize in strength. And in terms of speed, he wasn't that much faster than Luo Zheng. His strong point was the power in his spear arts� now, this strength was completely restricted by his opponent.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng broke through the first purple spear shadow, his figure turned and headed straight for the second purple spear shadow, then the third�</p>

  <p>After successfully shattering the three spear shadows, he lingered for a moment before dashing at Nathan again. In his hand, he grasped the sword that glowed with golden light, while his other hand held onto the crystal shield formed by the cyan light.</p>

  <p>Since the magnetic power easily broke through Nathan's spear strike, Luo Zheng no longer needed to escape. It was Nathan who had to find a way out of it.</p>

  <p>"Die!"</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng charged at him, Nathan ruthlessly thrust his spear. Purple spear light bloomed like flowers as the strong Law Power flowed unceasingly.</p>

  <p>Such was the power of truth, the foundation of all laws. But at this point, Nathan didn't have the ability to construct the laws himself.</p>

  <p>Still, destroying the laws was much easier than constructing them� Nathan had a chance.</p>

  <p>But this spear strike that was supposed to be able to break through all laws now seemed hollow and powerless in front of Nathan's opponent.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng blocked it easily. "It's my turn now."</p>

  <p>Behind the crystal shield, Luo Zheng wore a faint smile on his face. The broken sword was like a bolt of lightning as it shot toward Nathan.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>From the top to the bottom of the mountain, Luo Zheng unleashed four sword strikes in a row.</p>

  <p>Though Nathan managed to figure out the flaws of the two sword strikes, the third sword pierced Nathan's chest, leaving a foot-long wound. It was deep enough to expose his bone.</p>

  <p>And the fourth slash pierced right through his chest.</p>

  <p>Scarlet blood splattered the Heaven Earth Board in a line. Covered in wounds, Nathan finally staggered away from Luo Zheng as he stood in a corner of the board.</p>

  <p>Clad in a brocade robe, Nathan looked somewhat pitiful. His left shoulder was broken with the bone exposed and the wound in his chest wouldn't stop bleeding. He no longer looked like a handsome man.</p>

  <p>"You can admit defeat," Luo Zheng stated indifferently.</p>

  <p>The double-colored sword beam condensed above the broken sword once again, hovering over the sword.</p>

  <p>Nathan's expression turned sad at Zheng's words. His eyes were filled with resistance as his body trembled.</p>

  <p>No one had expected Nathan's loss.</p>

  <p>"It's finally over."</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng won the first place in the end!"</p>

  <p>"Nathan's been suppressed to such an extent that he doesn't even have the strength to fight back! I think he's even inferior to Tianming. The odds are against him having to go against Tianming for second place!"</p>

  <p>The crowd started to clamor. It seemed that the outcome of the battle had been decided.</p>

  <p>Now, the Xuanyuan Clan remained silent.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord of Original Sin was wrapped in a thick robe, an impenetrable black mist appearing before his eyes, hiding his expression.</p>

  <p>"Nathan's defeat is a good thing," he explained in a low voice. There seemed to be some kind of special magic in his tone, something filled with unparalleled majesty. Anyone who heard it would have to submit to it.</p>

  <p>"According to the fate displayed by the Heaven Earth Board, first place belongs to him. None of the variables should affect him. But a man without destiny has appeared, and that is none other than Luo Zheng. He seems to be the biggest variable now," someone beside Supreme Lord of Original Sin sighed.</p>

  <p>"Fate isn't something that can be decided in the first place. No one can predict the future." As Supreme Lord of Original Sin spoke, he saw Nathan drop the spear in his hand. When he stretched out his hands, a small fragment appeared before his chest.</p>

  <p>Above the fragment was a ball of Nathan's blood essence.</p>

  <p>'Heavenly Fragment!'</p>

  <p>When it came into his view, Luo Zheng looked at it strangely.</p>

  <p>'So Nathan also possesses a Heavenly Fragment, ' he thought.</p>

  <p>Previously, Luo Zheng had obtained one at the bottom of the Tower of Sin, but he didn't know how to use it correctly. According to what Xun said, each Heavenly Fragment was different according to the rules recorded within.</p>

  <p>If he wanted to stimulate the power of the fragment, he probably needed a Supreme Lord's help.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had yet to figure out what the true purpose of his Heavenly Fragment was.</p>

  <p>At this moment, he had no intention of stopping Nathan� he wanted to see how the latter would use it.</p>

  <p>Though Luo Zheng didn't stop him, someone else stopping him couldn't be avoided.</p>

  <p>"Nathan! Stop!"</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord of Original Sin suddenly roared when he witnessed the scene.</p>

  <p>And this roar seemed ten times louder than the one triggered by the Roaring Token.</p>

  <p>All the hidden beasts in the universe began stirring. Many of them were awakened by the thundering sound.</p>

  <p>Countless martial artists instinctively covered their ears.</p>

  <p>The sound broke through even the boundaries of the Illusion Battlefield, reaching into the picture scroll, reverberating unceasingly through the world inside the scroll.</p>

  <p>"Nathan... Stop... Stop... Stop..."</p>

  <p>The sound seemed to come from very far away. Once it was transmitted into the painting, it grew faint.</p>

  <p>The voice made Nathan's hands tremble slightly, and he could barely hold onto the fragment as it tumbled onto the board. The ball of blood essence wrapped around the fragment fell as well, splattering a flower of blood onto the board.</p>

  <p>At this point, Nathan was reeling from the shock of hearing the sound, conflicted.</p>

  <p>He wasn't willing to lose to Luo Zheng like this.</p>

  <p>The world of chaos would indeed bring a great disaster, but it would also bring an unimaginable fortune.</p>

  <p>And only he could be the center of this good fortune, no one else.</p>

  <p>His confidence was built on this sort of mindset. He believed that he was the number one warrior in the entire universe.</p>

  <p>But when he faced Luo Zheng, a warrior he couldn't defeat, his confidence wavered wildly.</p>

  <p>To protect his very state of mind, he had to use the Heavenly Fragment.</p>

  <p>It was his sole chance of winning.</p>

  <p>But Supreme Lord of Original Sin's roar came as a shock, snapping him back into reality.</p>

  <p>Pulling out the Heavenly Fragment there was already considered taboo.</p>

  <p>Was he still willing to use it?</p>

  <p>Determination grew in his eyes. So long as he used the fragment, Luo Zheng didn't stand a chance.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord of Original Sin, the patriarch of the Xuanyuan Clan, had poured so much effort into merging the fragment with Nathan because the Heavenly Fragment involved the Xuanyuan Clan's future plans.</p>

  <p>If the Heavenly Fragment was used there, the clan's future plans would be exposed to the universe. It was simply too great of a risk for the clan.</p>

  <p>"Nathan! Don't! Don't use it!"</p>

  <p>The next moment, the patriarch's voice resounded once again, somehow both dignified and pleading.</p>

  <p>Nathan looked pained and conflicted. The tangled emotions in his heart were almost clearly visible.</p>
