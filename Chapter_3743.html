<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3743 Two Civilizations </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Phoenix had always been careful ever since she set foot on the upper ice field, but now she was finally feeling a little bit radical.</p>

  <p>"Come on! Let's go over there and have a look!" she excitedly said to the other two.</p>

  <p>At this moment, however, Luo Zheng became extremely cautious and wary. "Wait a moment. There are still some ice blocks that haven't fallen off. It's not a joke when you get hit by these ice blocks."</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, another large chunk of hard transparent ice fell from above. With a clash, it created a massive hole in the ice field.</p>

  <p>The three of them waited at a distance for some more time. They didn't continue their slow approach until there was a clear sign that there would no longer be any solid ice falling.</p>

  <p>The door outlined by the light was still closed like before.</p>

  <p>Fearing that the metal box would be too cold to touch, Phoenix immediately released a divine flame of the Jin Wu.</p>

  <p>The divine flame was burning the surface of the metal box, but it did not extinguish quickly. It was like any ordinary flame, burning for a while before it quietly dwindled.</p>

  <p>"There is no problem with the metal box, but how can we get in?" Phoenix asked as she shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Look! It seems that the center of the door is somewhat sunken," said Li Bianxue, who was by their side.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and Phoenix shifted their eyes to the center of the door at the same time. It was not until Li Bianxue pointed out that they noticed that the center of the black metal door was indeed sunken.</p>

  <p>"I wonder, what can be put in this sunken area?" Phoenix asked. She looked really confused.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng's heart skipped a beat at that same moment.</p>

  <p>Judging from the size and shape of the sunken area, it was completely the same with the size and shape of the Civilization Artifact of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization. It seemed that the movement of this huge metal box had something to do with the Civilization Artifact under his control.</p>

  <p>"I think I may know," Luo Zheng said with a smirk.</p>

  <p>Phoenix and Li Bianxue curiously looked at Luo Zheng at the same time. Of course, the two girls hadn't imagined that all of this had been caused by Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>It was still a little troublesome to take out an Other Shore Token that had already been carried before.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng prepared for a little while, a metal cubic box appeared in his hand.</p>

  <p>"This box..."</p>

  <p>"It seems to be just the right size!"</p>

  <p>Li Bianxue's and Phoenix's eyes abruptly lit up with excitement.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng pushed the Civilization Artifact into the sunken area. The Civilization Artifact perfectly fitted and matched with the sunken area.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>Then, the red light around the door became brighter. With a click, the Civilization Artifact bounced out, and the black door automatically opened.</p>

  <p>"It's open..."</p>

  <p>Phoenix said in disbelief.</p>

  <p>Things went on almost unimaginably smoothly.</p>

  <p>It was as if the path of the upper ice field was made specifically for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>After absorbing the Civilization Artifact into his inner world, Luo Zheng was cautious enough to not rush into the metal box immediately. Like Phoenix, he released a fire column first to test the temperature inside the metal box.</p>

  <p>After the fire column went inside, the temperature did not change that much. Only then did Luo Zheng enter with the shield for caution.</p>

  <p>The inside of the metal box was pitch black as if it was an unending void.</p>

  <p>Rays of green light could be seen, which made the inside of the metal box look like there were little snakes wandering along the wall.</p>

  <p>Li Bianxue looked around and asked curiously, "This metal box is not a temple.</p>

  <p>It's simply an empty house. What's the use of an empty house like this?"</p>

  <p>Phoenix shook her head as if she was saying that she didn't know the answer to Li Bianxue's question. She had also never encountered a thing like this before.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was quietly observing the faint light that was flowing on the wall. At the same time, he was also paying close attention to the Civilization Artifact in his inner world.</p>

  <p>"You have completed the task of entering the core of Heavenly Obsession Civilization, and your reward for this is the activation of the core of Heavenly Obsession Civilization."</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>When the Civilization Artifact made this sound, the number of rays of green light on the wall greatly increased. As thousands of rays of green light flowed on the wall, the entire metal box was immediately reflecting in an eerie green glow.</p>

  <p>Phoenix and Li Bianxue warily looked around as they squeezed beside Luo Zheng with nervous expressions on their faces. If there was a trap, then they would all be doomed.</p>

  <p>Not to mention other things but even if a Cold Prison covered them, they would all be frozen to their core.</p>

  <p>"Don't, don't be afraid..."</p>

  <p>Being squeezed by the two girls, Luo Zheng was at a loss for words. He could only say, "It's me who activated the light."</p>

  <p>"You?" Phoenix was stunned by what Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>"Yes, this place is called the core of Heavenly Obsession Civilization. It was left behind by the Heavenly Obsession Civilization," said Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"So, what's the use of this place then?" Phoenix inquired again.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng just shook his head and said, "I haven't figured out that part either."</p>

  <p>Just as the two of them were discussing, a ray of light suddenly shot out from a wall right in front of them.</p>

  <p>The light swept across Phoenix, Luo Zheng, and Li Bianxue. Then a green shadow slowly appeared on the wall in front of them. Judging from the curvaceous silhouette, it should be a shadow of a human woman. Its size and form were actually remarkably similar to that of Phoenix.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng looked at the green figure from head to toe, it suddenly spoke in a tuneful voice.</p>

  <p>"Hello..."</p>

  <p>This voice was incredibly special. It was neither a voice of a woman nor a man, neither a voice of a child nor an elder. It sounded as if there were multiple people? males and females, young and old? speaking at the same time. Judging by the sound ray alone, it was terribly like the Civilization Artifact of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" Luo Zheng asked gently.</p>

  <p>"Me?" The green figure was deep in thought for a moment. "I'm a consciousness created by the Heavenly Obsession Civilization."</p>

  <p>"A consciousness that was created? Are you a soul fragment?" Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven, who was listening in Luo Zheng's inner world, also had a strange look on his face.</p>

  <p>With the theurgies on the Other Shore, all sorts of things could be created.</p>

  <p>However, a consciousness could never be created.</p>

  <p>Just like what Luo Zheng thought, he also thought that the green figure was a soul fragment.</p>

  <p>"No, I am not a soul fragment. I am not attached to anyone. I am an independent individual and I was created," the green figure replied affirmatively. Obviously, it understood what a soul fragment was, but it didn't think it was a soul fragment.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was still a little confused at what the green figure was saying. He could only make it clear if he asked it from another perspective, "So you are not a living creature but a puppet?"</p>

  <p>"I am not a puppet either. Give me a moment to think about how I can explain it to you more clearly..."</p>

  <p>The light that formed the green figure flickered and then suddenly disappeared.</p>

  <p>All the rays of green light in front of them lined up, forming a protective green curtain.</p>

  <p>A moment later, the green curtain began to emit other colors. Then, a picture appeared in front of them. It was a picture of three people in another completely different world.</p>

  <p>When the three of them saw this scene, shock and disbelief appeared on their faces.</p>

  <p>"What is this? Isn't this an illusion?" Phoenix excitedly exclaimed in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"I am not sure but it seems to be a scene formed by scrolling pictures,"</p>

  <p>Li Bianxue said.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded his head, then said, "All of the scenes are made up by constantly changing the light. I've never heard of this means before..."</p>

  <p>All kinds of illusions and magic arrays in chaos were very ordinary theurgies.</p>

  <p>Now, countless rays of light constantly changed to reflect complicated scenes. In the eyes of Luo Zheng, Phoenix, and Li Bianxue, it was a difficult and thankless thing to see. Even if it could be done, it was meaningless to do so.</p>

  <p>"The means may seem very difficult for you to do, but it's extremely simple for us," the green figure said.</p>

  <p>At this moment, a primitive land appeared on the curtain, and many small insects were born on that land. At the same time, the green figure spoke again with its eerie voice. "The Heavenly Obsession Civilization was actually the second chaotic era we have experienced. The experiences in that round of chaos have been annihilated in history. But I think you must have heard of the first chaotic era we have experienced. That was the Calculation Civilization."</p>
