<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Illuminating Soul Realm warriors were sitting straight and upright in rows. Even when there wasn't any trouble around, they were alert. So when Luo Zheng plummeted before them, the expressions on their faces changed drastically.</p>

  <p>They didn't know much about him, but they were afraid of him. Even the three Virtual Tribulation Realm warriors, who had gathered the life vitality of over ten thousand Illuminating Soul Realm warriors, didn't stand a chance against him. How could the likes of them resist his powers then?</p>

  <p>Besides, Darius had given out a strict order that no one was allowed to retreat without permission. They had to stay there even if they had to be killed. Those who violated such an order were to be executed without mercy.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng moved rapidly downward, those Illuminating Soul Realm warriors were his targets of slaughter. Since he was too powerful, they were only like a bunch of ants in his eyes, ready to be crushed in one stomp of his feet.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng kept on attacking and killing those warriors in the River Wave City.</p>

  <p>Wherever he went, severed limbs and fresh blood flew in the air, forming a clear line of blood as if a giant picked up a paintbrush and drew one stroke of a shaky line using his red ink.</p>

  <p>At first, those Illuminating Soul Realm warriors could still hold on. The deterrence of the Heavenly Evil Sect was still very strong for these independent warriors who had just joined the sect. However, as Luo Zheng continued to kill more of them, countless of malicious Mu Ning burst out of his body and those Illuminating Soul Realm warriors who were sitting still on the ground could no longer endure Zheng's attack.</p>

  <p>No one wanted to be killed by Luo Zheng like ants.</p>

  <p>"That guy is mad!"</p>

  <p>"If we stay here, we'll all die!"</p>

  <p>"Flee!"</p>

  <p>In the beginning, there were only a few warriors who tried to run away. The supervisors on both sides brandished their sabers to prevent the warriors from escaping, and those who dared to flee were all killed by them.</p>

  <p id="top_18">However, more warriors decided to escape as time flew. Eventually, most of them shot out in every direction of the River Wave City.</p>

  <p>Tens of thousands of Illuminating Soul Realm warriors scattered everywhere. Even Darius couldn't control them. He didn't have the ability to kill them all by himself.</p>

  <p>Seeing as the situation had already gone amiss, the Internal Elixir Realm warriors in the middle layer didn't want to stay in their original place anymore. They also began to flee the city.</p>

  <p>Those independent warriors did not have much loyalty, to begin with. The reason why they chose to join the Heavenly Evil Sect was that the Heavenly Evil Divine Kingdom had a lot of power and the warriors could get some benefit if the Heavenly Evil Divine Kingdom took control of the Central Region in the future. Ultimately, their lives were the most important.</p>

  <p>If the warriors in the low layer didn't provide enough life vitality, how could the six Virtual Tribulation Realm warriors be able to catch Ning Yudie?</p>

  <p>The giant rune covering Ning Yudie gradually dissipated. Then, Ning Yudie slightly raised her hand, and bits of snow-white light condensed in her hand, quickly forming a large ice halberd.</p>

  <p>Looking coldly at Darius, she said, "Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>Upon seeing that things really weren't going well, Darius hurriedly retreated towards the outskirts of the River Wave City. But how could he escape from Ning Yudie?</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie gently waved her large ice halberd, and as her figure flashed, the long feathers of the ice phoenix stretched out from her back, with a length of over ten feet. They continuously fluttered in the air.</p>

  <p>"Huff, huff, huff..."</p>

  <p>When Ning Yudie was one hundred feet behind Darius, he suddenly felt his movements become sluggish. Not only his flying speed but also the circulation of his life vitality within his belly became extremely slow.</p>

  <p>As Darius slowed down, Ning Yudie approached him in an instant. As she stared at him coldly, she pursed her lips and blew a mouthful of air towards him.</p>

  <p>In just a blink of an eye, a layer of frost enveloped Darius, freezing him into a block of ice.</p>

  <p>Before Darius fell to the ground, Ning Yudie had already flourished the ice halberd in her hand and struck at the human-shaped ice block furiously.</p>

  <p>"Clang!"</p>

  <p>Instantly, Darius was smashed into pieces of ice flowers.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng was unceasingly chasing down the six Virtual Tribulation Realm warriors. The six warriors also felt helpless and upset when they saw that the situation had taken a turn for the worse. They all had chosen to escape at that time, fleeing towards six different directions.</p>

  <p>Afraid that Ning Yudie might leave him again, Luo Zheng stopped chasing after the other warriors when he had already killed two of them. But with his current speed, he could have taken down at least three or four.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng had expected, Ning Yudie glared at him from a distance after she had just killed Darius. Then, she turned into a white flash of light and flew towards the south.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Luo Zheng let the forceful energy within his body erupt, increasing his moving speed to the maximum to chase after Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>As for Tianming and the rest, they could only blankly watch Luo Zheng and Ning Yudie quickly leave. They all looked at each other in dismay.</p>

  <p>"What should we do?"</p>

  <p>Lewis asked with his eyes wide open.</p>

  <p>"There's no need to chase after them. We'll go back to report this matter. We have succeeded in attacking the River Wave City, which might be the best news we can tell in a long time!" Tianming responded immediately. It was evident that there was a conflict between Ning Yudie and Luo Zheng, but it seemed as if the situation wasn't as bad anymore. Moreover, they moved at very high speed, so it was impossible for others to catch up to them. It was better for the rest of them to go back and report the matter immediately.</p>

  <p>Although Ning Yudie flew very fast, Luo Zheng also moved at great speed. One after the other, the two streaks of light drew an arc across the air over the Central Region.</p>

  <p>Seeing that she couldn't get rid of Luo Zheng, Ning Yudie suddenly stopped in midair, pointed her ice halberd towards Luo Zheng and asked, "Why are you following me?"</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng saw Ning Yudie stopping, he slowly approached her. At the same time, he said flatly, "As the leader of the Cloud Hall, you should not act so recklessly on the battlefield! Have you ever thought about the interests of the Cloud Hall?"</p>

  <p>Upon hearing Zheng's inquisition, Ning Yudie gritted her teeth. "What I do has nothing to do with you!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng slightly smiled and continued to approach Ning Yudie carefully.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie shook her large ice halberd and shouted, "Don't you come any closer!"</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng only ignored Yudie's warning. He was still slowly walking towards Ning Yudie, and his gaze also gradually became gentler.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng got too close, Ning Yudie swung her weapon and struck Luo Zheng pretty hard.</p>

  <p>"Bam!"</p>

  <p>The impact of the ice halberd on Zheng's body caused him to heavily dive downwards like a shooting star.</p>

  <p>Even if Ning Yudie did not employ her life vitality to hit him, her attack was still quite powerful. She was a Life and Death Realm warrior, after all, a force to be reckoned with.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>With a loud noise, Luo Zheng fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>If it was just another Virtual Tribulation Realm warrior that was struck by Ning Yudie, he could have ended up suffering a serious injury.</p>

  <p>But Zheng's body was strong, so only wisps of primordial energy appeared.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the attack didn't cause him any major harm. Ning Yudie knew that, too. Despite all that they had gone through, she couldn't let Luo Zheng die.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng crawled out of the large hole that his own falling had created, he once again flew towards Ning Yudie with a determined expression on his face.</p>

  <p>This time, just as Luo Zheng was about to get close, Ning Yudie suddenly swung the ice halberd in her hand and hit Luo Zheng for the second time, dropping him to the ground once more.</p>

  <p>"I told you not to come any closer!"</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie yelled.</p>

  <p>Persistent, Luo Zheng still refused to listen and continued to rush towards her.</p>

  <p>Over and over again, he was thrown to the dirt. Gradually, a number of holes caused by Zheng's impact on the ground could be seen.</p>

  <p>As they continued like so, more and more pits appeared on the ground.</p>

  <p>Finally, Ning Yudie thought it was time to stop hitting Luo Zheng. She let her ice halberd hang in the air and gazed at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Calmly, Luo Zheng flew towards Ning Yudie again and slowly passed by her ice halberd. This time, Ning Yudie did not hit him.</p>

  <p>They got closer and closer to each other. Then, Luo Zheng stretched out his hand towards her and pulled her into his embrace. "Stop being so stubborn," he whispered.</p>

  <p>Yudie's petite body suddenly tensed up, and the rage that was filling up her head went away. Her pair of beautiful eyes were filled with tears, and then she nodded and uttered, "Okay."</p>

  <p>They didn't say anything else, just silently embracing each other like that.</p>

  <p>Three days later, Ning Yudie finally returned to Oracle City.</p>

  <p>The news about the River Wave City being destroyed by Ning Yudie and Luo Zheng had already spread throughout the entire Oracle City. Since the start of the war with the Heavenly Evil Sect, the River Wave City had been difficult to attack as it was strategically located. Back then, the Oracle City's refusal to send troops to attack the River Wave City was based on various considerations, and the biggest scruple was that they were afraid that Eddie would directly fight a decisive battle with the allied forces of the Cloud Hall and the World Commercial Alliance.</p>

  <p>Since the Heavenly Evil Sect had become more powerful at the time, both the Cloud Hall and the World Commercial Alliance were no match even if combined. Now, both sides were saving up their strengths for the battle.</p>

  <p>However, just after the River Wave City had been attacked, the thing that the Oracle City members feared the most had happened at last.</p>

  <p>As expected, Eddie indeed lost his patience. Enraged, he led the army of the Heavenly Evil Sect and rushed straight towards the Oracle City.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of the World Commercial Alliance members, Eddie chose to take action at that particular time mainly because the River Wave City had already been destroyed.</p>

  <p>What they did not know was that Eddie did so because of Luo Zheng. He wanted to take the secret away from Luo Zheng and possess it before Master Wallace crossed the Chaotic Ocean of Stars.</p>

  <p>No matter what, the decisive battle that spanned over half of the Central Region was about to begin, and all the warriors in the Oracle City were about to engage themselves in it. The atmosphere turned heavier by the day.</p>
