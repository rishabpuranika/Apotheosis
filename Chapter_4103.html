  <p>
</p>

  <p>The process Zheng went through in order to inherit the ancestry-level bloodline was very abrupt and quite strange.</p>

  <p>Although he thought himself already quite talented, he knew there was a great gap between him and the human spirits.</p>

  <p>Judging from the reactions the four statues in the Eternal Divine Courtyard had when they saw Zheng absorb the ancestry-level bloodline, they were also quite shocked. It was virtually impossible for such a freak like him to exist in this world.</p>

  <p>The Human Spirit King, the Monkey Spirit King, the Snake Spirit King, the Bird Spirit King, and all other geniuses had failed to do that, yet a human from a secondary world, had achieved such a feat.</p>

  <p>Coupled with surprise was also a bit of confusion on Zheng's part.</p>

  <p>Was it because his physical body was special? His body was essentially a weapon but then didn't the Four Spirits Sect have skills that enabled them to create anything?</p>

  <p>Those people created the chaos from which even the Metal Civilization appeared.</p>

  <p>It shouldn't be that difficult for them to have forged a body similar or even superior to Zheng's.</p>

  <p>So why in the world did the ancestry-level bloodline favor Zheng?</p>

  <p>It was only when he looked through the human spirit's diary that Zheng was able to find some clues.</p>

  <p>"If that is the case, Zheng, then I'm afraid your physical body becoming such a weapon is part of someone's plan," the real Snake Goddess said with a frown.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid that the Bold Conjecture House had found the solution. Go on and continue reading the diary," the Primeval Lord of Heaven urged.</p>

  <p>Zheng decided it best to continue deciphering the contents on the stone tablet.</p>

  <p>"We tried thousands of containers but discovered that the ancestry-level bloodline repelled most of the materials.</p>

  <p>Even dead wood and soil were rejected.</p>

  <p>However, we've discovered that if the wood is burnt until it turns into charcoal or if the soil is heated until it becomes solid brick, then the repelling force would disappear!"</p>

  <p>"Alvaro went out to the Eternal Divine Courtyard again. He had a fight with the statues that were guarding it. Even if the human spirits, monkey spirits, snake spirits, and bird spirits each have a statue there, they actually follow the Snake Spirit Sect's orders! These damned fellows!</p>

  <p>They did let him in eventually. Alvaro finally found the reason why we failed. His Infinite Eyes can see what is normally too far or too little to be seen. According to him, there are very small living creatures in the soil and wood which have gone unnoticed by ordinary people. These creatures are very weak and would promptly die if subjected to the smallest of flames.</p>

  <p>This way, it was made clear to us that the ancestry-level bloodline repels all living creatures but not dead creatures.</p>

  <p>Elder Xue forwarded this assumption and hypothesized that there might be a condition for absorbing the ancestry-level bloodline. According to him, it may require a creature that is both alive and dead at the same time.</p>

  <p>That doesn't make any sense, though! What's dead will remain dead and what is alive shall continue to live until death. How can a creature be both at the same time?</p>

  <p>Our puppet technique can construct puppets that look and move the exact same way as a living, breathing person but, at the end of the day, those puppets remain dead things. If we put the ancestry-level bloodline into a puppet's body, it would be as good as pouring it all into the sacred cup.</p>

  <p>This is not absorbing the ancestry-level bloodline, nor can we use the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>We can also create metal creatures but when we tried putting the ancestry-level bloodline in them and even in creatures made of other different elements, they'd promptly explode and die.</p>

  <p>Elder Xue remained persistent and began to teach us lessons again. Master Kincaid even got scolded. He said there were too many unknown and incomprehensible things in the main world and though the Four Spirits Sect was powerful, it was not omniscient.</p>

  <p>Elder Xue disappeared the next day. He only left a letter behind saying he was going to try and find a solution.</p>

  <p>That old man is very stubborn. He must have gone to the Deep Space.</p>

  <p>There are a lot of strange things up there like the Time Vessel. The place is simply too dangerous. Master Sheeran almost lost his life when he went there. How can Elder Xue dare go there alone..."</p>

  <p>The diary ended there and made no further mention of Elder Xue's fate.</p>

  <p>Further entries expressed records of dissatisfaction of the Bold Conjecture House with the Snake Spirit Sect who began to change the rules of entering the Eternal Divine Courtyard.</p>

  <p>By their rules, it became increasingly more difficult to gain entry.</p>

  <p>Sheehan had originally taken out the ancestry-level bloodline and made it accessible to everyone in the Four Spirits Sect.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, after the establishment of the Eternal Divine Courtyard, this open access enjoyed by the sect eventually disappeared.</p>

  <p>Over time, the ancestry-level bloodline became a sacred relic to the Four Spirits Sect and was fiercely guarded and protected.</p>

  <p>Save for the time when the Eternal Divine Courtyard opened to allow warriors to get some power, it would normally be impossible for anyone to even look at it.</p>

  <p>A fierce quarrel between Kincaid and Cornelius erupted because of this but the latter ended up gaining the upper hand.</p>

  <p>Nobody knew what sort of method Cornelius used to persuade Sheehan to agree with him but the Four Spirit Sect eventually gave the Eternal Divine Courtyard supreme power in order to facilitate development for the Four Spirits Sect.</p>

  <p>However, taking control of the Eternal Divine Courtyard, the Snake Spirit Sect were selfish, and they devised a few sketchy rules and left a back door for their sect.</p>

  <p>Their sketchy rules made it very difficult for human, bird, and monkey spirits to accept the ancestry-level bloodline's test while their people met no obstructions whatsoever which only led to Kincaid's growing frustration.</p>

  <p>Inevitably, an intense conflict broke out.</p>

  <p>Dissatisfied and frustrated by the current state of things, Kincaid poured his annoyance into his work and soon came up with a method to activate the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>It was a rudimentary method but he still wanted to try it. Everything was well and good until he was stopped by the entrance and was told that he was forbidden from entering the Eternal Divine Courtyard.</p>

  <p>In a fit of anger, he smashed the dome and caused some heavy damage onto the courtyard.</p>

  <p>Elite members of the Snake Spirit Sect all came and surrounded him.</p>

  <p>Cornelius was also there and criticized Kincaid for what he had done.</p>

  <p>Afraid of the brewing fight between the two kings, Orlando immediately rushed over.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Monkey Spirit King unconditionally stood by the human spirits' side.</p>

  <p>It was after the Monkey Spirit King involved himself that a gap in strength was observed. Cornelius had no choice but to concede and allow Kincaid to continue his experiment.</p>

  <p>However, the former made it clear that this was the only exception and that it wasn't a privilege that would be granted to him ever again.</p>

  <p>That made Kincaid unhappy.</p>

  <p>However, he had no choice but to grit his teeth and agree. Nobody was exempt from the rules, not even the four kings.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, despite all the ruckus he caused to touch the ancestry-level bloodline, Kincaid's method ultimately failed.</p>

  <p>The ancestry-level bloodline showed no reaction at all.</p>

  <p>This result confused Kincaid since he was quite sure that his method would've been very effective.</p>

  <p>How could the ancestry-level bloodline show no reaction at all?</p>

  <p>Was it perhaps resistant to Kincaid? That seemed to be the only logical explanation. Since magical blood was sentient, it could reject external interference.</p>

  <p>Kincaid's method was recorded on No. 17 stone tablet.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes lit up when he read this.</p>

  <p>"No. 17 stone tablet!" he cried out.</p>

  <p>He had deciphered sixteen stone tablets and No. 17 stone tablet was up next.</p>

  <p>This tablet contained Kincaid's method and the real Primeval Lord of Heaven and Snake Goddess became extremely interested when they realized this.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, Zheng picked up the tablet.</p>

  <p>This one was very different from the ones he held before.</p>

  <p>There were only four Sanskrit words on the tablet and they glowed a dull blue.</p>

  <p>Zheng also noticed that the way these words were written was very strange with extremely thin lines twisted together.</p>

  <p>The core of Heavenly Obsession Civilization deciphered the tablet for him and the Primeval Lord of Heaven and Snake Goddess patiently waited for him to speak.</p>

  <p>After a minute or so, Zheng pursed his lips. "They're undecipherable..."</p>

  <p>The core of Heavenly Obsession Civilization relied on a large amount of calculation to decipher words. However, the problem was that these four Sanskrit words were in a form that it had never seen before so it had no idea how to calculate it.</p>
