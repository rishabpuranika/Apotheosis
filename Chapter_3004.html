<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3004 Observing The Lofty Sword </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Faced with Zheng's sudden attack, Chadwick flew into a rage.</p>

  <p>The Sword Light Palace was actually a sect that attached great importance to battle rules. In other words, they despised a sneak attack more than anything else.</p>

  <p>Even if the two were engaged in a fair competition, Zheng was almost sure that he'd defeat his opponent without too much struggle. However, he didn't want to waste both his time and energy by getting into a fight with this man.</p>

  <p>It just wasn't worth it. What Zheng wanted, in fact, was only to solve the problem as quickly as possible.</p>

  <p>Followed by Chadwick's shocked and confused expression, Zheng's palm was already pushing against his opponent's jaw. In a split second, Chadwick heard a loud roar coming from his very own head. White light flashed before his entire body went limp and unconscious.</p>

  <p>Zheng cast a last glance at the unconscious Chadwick before turning to look at Faegan and Jago. He smiled faintly and asked, "Do you still want to fight me?"</p>

  <p>As Faegan and Jago watched the scene played out before their very eyes, their faces turned ghastly pale. If it were anyone else, how would they dare fight back?</p>

  <p>Despite everything, they had come here aggressively. How could they retreat now, after having come so far? That would be nothing less than humiliating. The two of them couldn't help but feel completely embarrassed.</p>

  <p>"Fight!" Faegan shouted loudly.</p>

  <p>They were well prepared for today's fight. Maybe they still had a chance, Faegan figured.</p>

  <p>It took no more than five minutes before thirty or so disciples were lying down on the ground once more.</p>

  <p>This time, Zheng had restrained himself a lot. He simply knocked them out one by one, causing very little damage to the Sword Dance Palace.</p>

  <p>In a private Sword Dance Palace room, Ingram's lips spread into a smile as he observed the ongoing scene. He couldn't help but admire Laura's foresight.</p>

  <p>After travelling to the Gracious Province, Laura not only brought the former leader's personal effects back with her, but she also brought back a genius— Zheng. Ingram believed that Zheng would still be a top disciple if he were in the Burial Sword Palace. Perhaps this time, the Sword Dance Palace would be capable of flourishing thanks to Zheng.</p>

  <p>Previously, Ingram was dissatisfied with being relegated to the Sword Dance Palace. But now, he was looking forward to the palace's future.</p>

  <p>It wasn't until they were taught two lessons in a row that Faegan, Jago and their followers finally understood what was happening to them.</p>

  <p>The clans that they relied on no longer provided them with assistance. Even Chadwick, the strongest one among them, wasn't a near match for Zheng.</p>

  <p>There were no resources on their side that could help them fight back.</p>

  <p>After understanding the problem clearly, they finally chose to accept their destiny, ultimately deciding to get along with Zheng and his followers.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, the best room of the Sword Dance Palace has been kept for you!"</p>

  <p>"As for the others, you may choose your rooms according to the rules."</p>

  <p>On his behalf, Zheng wasn't very comfortable.</p>

  <p>Why the sudden change in their attitudes?</p>

  <p>'That's good. At least this way, they won't be thinking of revenge at all times, ' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>Although the disciples were all arrogant and unruly, once they accepted Zheng and his followers, it was much easier for them to get along.</p>

  <p>They were rich and loyal to their friends. In the past few days, they had invited Kenelm and Zheng to travel around the Seven-Star City. Through this, Zheng had learned a little history about the Sword Light Palace.</p>

  <p>That said though, these disciples didn't cherish the cultivation resources at all.</p>

  <p>Disciples like Faegan and Jago had talents that weren't too bad. They were born into big clans, and their status was much higher than that of the others.</p>

  <p>Under the care of their families, it was naturally difficult for them to have great ambitions regarding the cultivation.</p>

  <p>In contrast, people such as Kenelm worked much harder than the rest. Most of their time was spent reading the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent translation.</p>

  <p>Zheng was only a disciple of the Sword Dance Palace, and there was no need or reason for him to teach these guys to concentrate on cultivation.</p>

  <p>However, it remained strange that these disciples indeed changed a lot, notably so after he defeated them twice with his irresistible strength.</p>

  <p>At the very least, they hoped to become stronger, and therefore, their interest in cultivation had no choice but to develop as well.</p>

  <p>Faegan and the others had asked Zheng a few questions, such as why he was much stronger than them even though they were at the same cultivation level. Their questions were rooted in reason and curiosity.</p>

  <p>Zheng would certainly offer the truth to the questions that could be answered, but there were certain questions that involved his own secrets, and in such cases, he held his silence.</p>

  <p>Not even a month later, the Sword Light Palace organized their very first sword observing activity.</p>

  <p>Those observing the sword would be the disciples of all thirteen palaces under the Sword Light Palace.</p>

  <p>The Seven-Star City was surrounded by mountains in all directions. So much so, in fact, that it was generally considered a mountain city. Countless magnificent palaces were lined up, one after the other, around the huge Seven-Star Mountain. Looking down from the top of the mountain, people felt woozy.</p>

  <p>The Lofty Sword, seven hundred thousand feet high, was stabbed into the mountain peak, emitting an indescribable aura.</p>

  <p>Even a powerful Other Shore Realm warrior would feel a sense of solemnness and fear when the sword came into view.</p>

  <p>On the platform beneath the Lofty Sword, a middle-aged man dressed in cyan and wearing a cyan hat called out, "Disciples of the Burial Sword Palace, get onto the platform."</p>

  <p>Although his voice was low, it traveled for thousands of miles in pristine clarity.</p>

  <p>The platform where the middle-aged man stood actually stretched outward and connected to many other platforms, each of which could accommodate over a thousand people.</p>

  <p>As soon as his voice transmitted out to the others, the center of the platform suddenly showed slight signs of space fluctuations.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, three hundred disciples appeared on the platform, all at once. Every single one of them sat cross-legged, holding the same posture.</p>

  <p>The disciples were dressed in the same cyan clothes, and each of them emitted a sharp aura. From their eyes down to their gestures, they showed their arrogance on every level. They were the disciples of the Burial Sword Palace, and also the best group of talented disciples in the Sword Light Palace. It was no wonder they acted in such a way.</p>

  <p>"Disciples of the Demon Sword Palace, climb onto the platform," the middle-aged man called out once again.</p>

  <p>On another platform appeared five hundred disciples, who were equally sitting in the same cross-legged position. The Demon Sword Palace was second only to the Burial Sword Palace. Over the years, it seemed that the Demon Sword Palace was about to surpass the Burial Sword Palace, but it hadn't quite happened just yet. These two palaces had been secretly competing against each other.</p>

  <p>As soon as the disciples of the Demon Sword Palace appeared, they looked at the platform where the Burial Sword Palace disciples were. Their eyes were full of provocation.</p>

  <p>"Disciples of the Broken Sword Palace, get onto the platform."</p>

  <p>"Disciples of the Sword Anger Palace, get onto the platform." And this kept going.</p>

  <p>Disciples of different palaces appeared on different platforms, one after the other. The disciples appeared in numbers of hundreds.</p>

  <p>The middle-aged man looked at the smallest platform on one side. Just by the looks of it, it was several times smaller than the other platforms and could only accommodate about a hundred warriors. This platform belonged specifically to the Sword Dance Palace.</p>

  <p>Back in the beginning, only twelve palaces existed in the Sword Light Palace, and this platform was later added for the Sword Dance Palace.</p>

  <p>Compared with other palaces' platforms, this one looked somewhat ridiculous in appearance.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, although the platform was small, it had never been full in the past. Sometimes, the platform was completely deserted, in fact. After all, the disciples in the Sword Dance Palace weren't interested in cultivating.</p>

  <p>Even if the chance of observing the sword was very rare, they still wouldn't cherish it in the least.</p>

  <p>When it came to tradition though, the middle-aged man would still call them over.</p>

  <p>"Disciples of the Sword Dance Palace, get onto the platform."</p>

  <p>As the middle-aged man's voice spread out once again, waves of space fluctuation suddenly spread outward on the platform as well.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>In unison, more than forty people from the Sword Dance Palace appeared on the platform.</p>

  <p>The middle-aged man was rather taken aback upon seeing so many warriors appear on the platform at once. In fact, he had never witnessed such a scene before.</p>

  <p>As the other disciples watched their sudden appearance, they too, portrayed expressions of confusion.</p>

  <p>The Sword Dance Palace disciples' bad reputation was known to the other palaces. The Sword Dance Palace disciples were arrogant and domineering, but they all had strong family backgrounds that couldn't afford to be offended.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the thirteen palaces were all established separately. The disciples from each of the twelve palaces wouldn't provoke the Sword Dance Palace disciples, and in this way, not many conflicts rose amongst them.</p>

  <p>In the past sword observing activities, most often, there weren't any disciples from the Sword Dance Palace in attendance. At times, there were seven or eight disciples attending the activity. They didn't observe the sword carefully, but clamored instead. More so, they had been expelled several times.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the Sword Dance Palace platform was completely empty the last three times. More than forty people came here today, which made the others feel rather strange.</p>
