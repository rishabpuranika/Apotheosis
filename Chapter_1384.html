  <p>
</p>

  <p>To be safe, Luo Luo Zheng only stretched out one hand.</p>

  <p>If these flames could really incinerate his body, then he would be able to retreat in time. Losing one arm was better than losing his entire body.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was being naive, though.</p>

  <p>The moment he touched the purple flames, they spread from his arm throughout his body at a speed that far exceeded his imagination. There was no time for him to react at all.</p>

  <p>The scorching heat from the flames poured directly into his body, spreading to every bone and every organ.</p>

  <p>"This is bad..." Luo Zheng's face darkened. He hadn't thought that these purple flames would be so powerful.</p>

  <p>He gritted his teeth while bearing the scorching heat of the purple flames. As for whether or not he would succeed, it was up to the heavens.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had been tempered by flames before, but this time his body reacted way faster and much more violently.</p>

  <p>Under the burning of the flames, his body turned red, as if he was a statue that was melting into molten steel.</p>

  <p>At the same time, golden vortexes appeared on the surface of his body and started to spin quickly.</p>

  <p>When the golden vortexes began to absorb the purple flames, Luo Luo Zheng started to feel relieved.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng felt confident, he couldn't help but worry that the flames left behind by the Supreme Lord were too powerful. It was true that his physical body was comparable to a sacred weapon, but these flames were impressive. He knew that if he were to throw a sacred weapon into the fire, it would instantly turn into molten metal.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng never thought that these flames would be so fierce. He felt relieved that his body reacted incredibly fast, or he wouldn't have been able to withstand the heat.</p>

  <p>Now that he had already absorbed some of the purple flames, he decided to wait before crossing the flame pool until his body had settled.</p>

  <p>As the dense golden vortexes were crazily absorbing the purple flames, he soon found out that there was something wrong.</p>

  <p>The golden vortexes were absorbing the flames too fast, just like a starving boy wolfing down his food. Each time the golden vortexes were activated, they would be able to completely absorb the flames within a short period of time. They were just like vicious beasts that had starved for a thousand years, and were extremely greedy for the flames.</p>

  <p>Now, even though his body had been absorbing the flames for so long, the purple flames on his body would not disappear. They kept on burning even more brilliantly making Luo Luo Zheng shine.</p>

  <p>From a distance, Luo Luo Zheng looked like a burning pillar of fire. A long tower of fire soared up above his head, charging straight to the top of the Enchanted Barrier Tower.</p>

  <p>"These purple flames keep coming. It seems like I will never be able to absorb all of them."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng placed his hands in front of his chest and looked at the purple flames that continuously coiled around him. A worried and cautious expression appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>"This is the Immortal Profound Flame left by the Supreme Lord of Profound Flame. It will not be easy to extinguish it," Xun said calmly.</p>

  <p>"The Immortal Profound Flame?" asked Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Yes, the Immortal Profound Flame has a great history. It wasn't created by the Supreme Lord of Profound Flame himself, but came from the Divine Flame World," Xun continued.</p>

  <p>"The Divine Flame World?" Luo Luo Zheng was caught by surprise. He had never heard of this supreme world. However, he hadn't been in the Upper World for long, so there was no way he could know everything about it.</p>

  <p>The Divine Flame World was an independent supreme world within the universe.</p>

  <p>The special thing about this supreme world was that it was filled with all sorts of blazing fires.</p>

  <p>It was not suitable for living beings to live in, and only a few fire-resistant or special-shaped creatures could survive here. Truth was, the flames were the indigenous inhabitants of the Divine Flame World.</p>

  <p>In fact, fires and thunders would all gradually turn into spirits and slowly acquire wisdom.</p>

  <p>The golden wind blades that Luo Luo Zheng had encountered before in the storms of the Chaotic Ocean of Stars also possessed their own intelligence.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the Immortal Profound Flame was extremely rare to find in the enormous Divine Flame World.</p>

  <p>Back then, in order to obtain this flame, the Supreme Lord of Profound Flame had personally entered the Divine Flame World. It had taken him dozens of years before he could capture a single wisp of it. He had nurtured it carefully afterwards, until it eventually became strong and vast.</p>

  <p>The most important characteristic of the Immortal Profound Flame was that it could never extinguish.</p>

  <p>Most of the power left behind by the Supreme Lords in the Law Storm had gradually disintegrated into law fragments. Yet, the Immortal Profound Flame was still burning fiercely. Even though it was much weaker than it had been back then, it still burned brightly.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng became anxious when he heard that the fire couldn't be extinguished.</p>

  <p>"But... if the Immortal Profound Flame can't be extinguished, will it always be burning on my body? Will this ever end?" asked Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"The Immortal Profound Flame can burn on your body for tens of thousands of years. Walking around with this flame on your body for tens of thousands of years is indeed very eye-catching." Xun laughed.</p>

  <p>It seemed that as a sacred weapon, Luo Zheng's physique could withstand the burning of the Immortal Profound Flame. After absorbing the immortal fire, it was very likely that his body would become even stronger and complete a new round of transformation.</p>

  <p>The problem was that the flames couldn't be extinguished. Would Luo Luo Zheng really have to walk around with the flames burning on him? He wouldn't even be able to wear clothes.</p>

  <p>Moreover, he always carried with him his spirit beast bag, space ring, and other personal belonging, which now had been put somewhere near him.</p>

  <p>If he couldn't extinguish the Immortal Profound Flame, he wouldn't be able to take those things with him. The space ring that Ning Yudie had given him wasn't of a high grade. If it was burned by the Immortal Profound Flame, it would melt instantly.</p>

  <p>Now, Luo Luo Zheng was stumped.</p>

  <p>However, he suddenly felt that something was amiss. He realized that Xun's tone was extremely relaxed.</p>

  <p>She supported Luo Luo Zheng. As she already knew about the characteristics of the Immortal Profound Flame, she should have spoken up to stop him when he was trying to refine his body with the Immortal Profound Flame.</p>

  <p>However, she didn't say a word, and her tone right now was very casual.</p>

  <p>It looked like she already knew a way to solve the problem.</p>

  <p>"All right. Stop teasing him. Luo Luo Zheng, you forgot about the Ancestral Dragon.</p>

  <p>Although it is still in its infancy and has no fighting power, it possesses some abilities that you can make use of," the cyan dragon said slowly.</p>

  <p>"The Ancestral Dragon?" Luo Luo Zheng was slightly surprised.</p>

  <p>The baby dragon was still in Luo Zheng's spirit beast bag. However, ever since Luo Luo Zheng had ascended to the Upper World, it had been sleeping a lot. When he was in the Mist Palace, Luo Luo Zheng would let it roam around, but the little guy did not seem to be interested in him. Every time it was out of the bag, it would look for Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>The Ancestral Dragon loved her food, so it kept following her. And even though it wouldn't help it grow, it really liked the flavor of her food.</p>

  <p>When the cyan dragon brought the Ancestral Dragon up, Luo Luo Zheng realized that the Ancestral Dragon seemed to be able to ignore all laws.</p>

  <p>When he was in the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land, Luo Luo Zheng had been unable to take out the Ancestral Dragon egg. The Ancestral Dragon had been able to easily ignore the limit of the spatial refraction. However, Luo Luo Zheng and the Spirit Supreme Realm warriors of Celestial Position couldn't enter the refracted space.</p>

  <p>"The Ancestral Dragon..."</p>

  <p>A light flashed through Luo Zheng's eyes as he looked at the spirit beast bag.</p>

  <p>But he didn't reach out to take the spirit beast bag. He lightly flicked his fingers towards the bag from a distance and, in a flash, the baby dragon dashed straight towards him and pounced into his arms.</p>

  <p>The little guy had spent most of its time in Luo Zheng's spirit beast bag.</p>

  <p>Although the interior space of the spirit beast bag was big, it still felt stuffy and had to run outside to take a stroll.</p>

  <p>It simply jumped onto Luo Zheng's body, ignoring the Immortal Profound Flame just like it had ignored the spatial refraction before. The Immortal Profound Flame indeed did not cause any harm to the Ancestral Dragon.</p>

  <p>'This little guy is immune to all Original Laws.'</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng held out his hands in front of the Ancestral Dragon. The purple flames on his hands continued to burn, without any sign of weakening.</p>

  <p>When the Ancestral Dragon saw this it opened its small mouth and swallowed the flames burning on Luo Zheng's hands.</p>

  <p>Before long, Luo Luo Zheng began flying across the flame pool. He would still catch the Immortal Profound Flame while flying, and he did not let the Ancestral Dragon clean the flames on his body. He wanted to wait until after he had covered these two hundred miles.</p>

  <p>Just then, the warriors outside the Enchanted Barrier Tower discovered that Luo Luo Zheng had once again advanced!</p>
