<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1793 Smoky Heart-locking Curse </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Everyone in the crowd gasped as they saw the sky crack. Time seemed to stop as a black figure emerged from within the fissure and as the figure slowly stepped into the light, they saw his body covered with jagged barbs.</p>

  <p>"It's a grand sorcerer!"</p>

  <p>"His cultivation level is that of a war lord's!"</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, hurry and activate that damn thing of yours! Take us out of here!"</p>

  <p>Lawson roared.</p>

  <p>"I already said none of you can leave and yet you still try!" The grand sorcerer's voice boomed as he brandished his bone cane. Black mist rose from the tip of the cane, which then shot straight to Luo Zheng's group, striking eight people in the chest. "Ahhh, you can try to escape..." The grand sorcerer began. "But I must tell you, it will be futile. Your hearts will explode before you can leave this place."</p>

  <p>This was the Smoky Heart-locking Curse from the ancient sorcerer race.</p>

  <p>Unless the person who cast the curse was killed, the black fog would never be lifted. At this point, it was as powerful as the Desperate Melee.</p>

  <p>The only catch was that its power depended on the person who cast the spell. Unfortunately for them, this grand sorcerer clearly believed he had the power to crush all eight Godly Geniuses.</p>

  <p>"Let's get rid of him first!" someone shouted. "Leave the Cloud Hall!" another screamed. With a flash of light, Tianming summoned the Soaring Snake Sword as he dashed toward the grand sorcerer.</p>

  <p>The warriors who had come to visit the Cloud Hall were in chaos. None of them thought they'd be involved in a battle with this level and magnitude. All they could do was run and try to escape in panic at the moment Tianming spoke.</p>

  <p>However, the grand sorcerer was not interested in the ordinary warriors.</p>

  <p>All of his attention was directed towards the eight Godly Geniuses.</p>

  <p>"Evacuate everyone in the Cloud Hall, then leave this place with Luo Nian,"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng instructed before charging after Tianming.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Lucille, Kurt, and Lone also unleashed their own techniques on the sorcerer.</p>

  <p>Unable to stand in the background, Nathan and Lawson gritted their teeth and rushed forward.</p>

  <p>Although almost all of these eight Godly Geniuses were in the Spirit Supreme Realm, it wasn't impossible for them to defeat Spirit Transformation Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>Which meant that while this grand sorcerer had the power of a war lord, and the chances were slim, if the eight geniuses united, they could actually defeat the sorcerer!</p>

  <p>A blinding beam of light shot to where the grand sorcerer was standing and Tianming suddenly appeared at the end. Like lightning, he thrust his Soaring Snake Sword forward!</p>

  <p>"Hey!" the grand sorcerer scowled. "You deserve your reputation!" He lightly tapped his cane on his palm and with a sudden swing, a black demonic claw formed and grabbed at the Soaring Snake Sword.</p>

  <p>Clang!</p>

  <p>The force of the sword colliding with the claw sent Tianming back. None of them knew what the claw was but it must have been very strong if even the Soaring Snake Sword was unable to cut through it.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!" The grand sorcerer sneered and spun his bone cane in a circle, the shadow of an insect emerging from its tip and crawling towards Tianming. This was the Deadly Cane Strike of the sorcerer race.</p>

  <p>One hit meant instant death. This was how merciless the sorcerer race was in taking lives.</p>

  <p>"In your dreams!" Tianming shouted, narrowly evading the attack.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng rushed toward the grand sorcerer as the power of his dragon scales was activated. Luo Luo Zheng was like an ancient beast from savage land. Right now, under Luo Zheng's hit, even a world lord would not be able to handle this power, not to mention a grand sorcerer whose race wasn't good at hand to hand combat.</p>

  <p>Having no choice but to give up killing Tianming at the moment, the sorcerer waved his cane causing more black claws to emerge from the black fog surrounding him. Two of the claws turned into fists and shot toward Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Puff, puff!</p>

  <p>With two muffled sounds, Luo Luo Zheng turned the two black claws into smoke.</p>

  <p>The power contained in them however, was much more than what Luo Luo Zheng expected and the force caused him to be blown back a good five feet from where he was.</p>

  <p>Lucille, Lone, and Nathan followed Luo Zheng's lead and launched their first round of attacks.</p>

  <p>While they were itching to leave this place already, they were still chained by the Smoky Heart-locking Curse and needed to kill the grand sorcerer first.</p>

  <p>BOOM!</p>

  <p>The Cloud Hall, which was floating high up in the sky, suddenly began to shake violently!</p>

  <p>Although they had focused all their power on the grand sorcerer, his power was still too great. In the end, the Cloud Hall was not able to resist such terrifying power and threatened to fall apart.</p>

  <p>Nathan's spear missed and flipped over the roof and flew over to the enchanted barrier of the Light of Water.</p>

  <p>In the past, Eddie was naturally helpless against the enchanted barrier of the Light of Water but when Nathan marched his spear forward, the enchanted barrier began to ripple and crack. And before the power of the spear light could spread throughout the barrier, the whole Light of Water shattered.</p>
