<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1640 Who Is That Woman (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Now the competition for the rankings in the Illusion Battlefield reached the most intense stage.</p>

  <p>The name and ranking of each warrior showing on the pyramids in the outside world continued to change erratically. The outside world became quite fascinated by it, and everyone had their favorites among the participants.</p>

  <p>"Lawson's in the first place! Unbelievable! Didn't he previously rank the 200th?"</p>

  <p>"Nathan is now back in the top three! That was quick!"</p>

  <p>"Who is Zola? I've never heard of this name before. The person is now in the top ten! This is crazy!"</p>

  <p>Being in the top 100 in the Illusion Battlefield would be a great achievement. The warriors who made it to the top 100 were considered as the top talents of the universe. All the creatures in the universe paid attention to the names that would make it on the list as they were rooting for their respective races.</p>

  <p>The entire Illusion Battlefield was divided into fifty supreme worlds, and each supreme world had many mighty warriors in it. But until now, these warriors had yet to face each other. Thus, at this point in the competition, it was still undetermined how these warriors would rank in terms of strength and power.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, as Ning Yudie was supplying her life vitality, she kept looking at the names on the pyramid.</p>

  <p>When she spotted Zheng's name among the top one hundred warriors, she felt at ease.</p>

  <p>Based on her knowledge about the Illusion Battlefield, she could comprehend her husband's current state and prospects.</p>

  <p>Each warrior competing in the Illusion Battlefield aimed to be on the top 100 list. There was a lot at stake in being one of the best in this competition. The top 100 warriors were favored by the universe. Those who made it to the list were highly valued by their respective races because it was believed that the future Godly Geniuses would be born from these people. And from those Godly Geniuses would the True Gods be born.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie recalled hearing from Luo Zheng about the world of chaos. It was the first time she had ever heard of such.</p>

  <p>And what was exactly the world of chaos?</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie didn't know and when she asked Luo Zheng about it, he wasn't certain about it either.</p>

  <p>She did her research and from what she learned, she concluded that the world of chaos was the Godly Way.</p>

  <p>However, Ning Yudie didn't know that her understanding of the world of chaos was quite shallow.</p>

  <p>Most of the warriors in the entire universe lacked deeper knowledge and understanding of the world of chaos.</p>

  <p>From what they knew, after the arrival of the world of chaos, talents would spring up like wild mushrooms. In effect, the talents would no longer be rare. If the universe became saturated with talents, the standard for such would become higher, discerning the less impressive talents as ordinary.</p>

  <p>But how could one be considered as a talent? A talent possessed an innate gift. They had mastery of incomparable skills amongst their peers.</p>

  <p>An ordinary warrior could master a skill through rigorous practice and perseverance, while a talent could easily unleash that potential once they embraced their gift.</p>

  <p>Thus, if the number of talents in the world of chaos was to increase, those born as ordinary talents would no longer be considered as talents.</p>

  <p>In the current universe, the only considered true talents were the ace talents of the major powers and races.</p>

  <p>These were the ones who had already activated the Mahayana Lotus Flower. Only when their Mahayana Lotus Flower had reached the perfection state could they become Godly Geniuses. Then, they would have the possibility of becoming True Gods.</p>

  <p>And aside from the possibility of becoming True Gods, these talents also carried the destiny of the universe.</p>

  <p>But as the world of chaos continued to evolve, a crisis was always bound to happen to the universe sooner or later. Even the best warriors could not escape the crisis brought by the evolving world of chaos.</p>

  <p>All the past grand eras fell into the hands of the inevitable crises.</p>

  <p>A grand era would last for 3.6 billion years, and every grand era had suffered its crisis. In the last era, for example, stars had fallen, and the Fire Demon had descended.</p>

  <p>While in the grand era before that, a plague erupted like God's punishment.</p>

  <p>And the crisis from three grand eras ago was the stars falling and hitting the universe, killing millions of creatures. No one could predict what the crisis would be for a grand era and when it would come.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, there were no historical records of the crisis that had happened four grand eras ago because it wasn't until the last three grand eras when the historians started to record the crises. Still, the recorded crises from the previous three grand eras were far from being complete and accurate.</p>

  <p>After all, the crisis could wipe out a civilization, which would result in the extinction of the grand era. Thus, only a few things would have been passed on to the next grand era.</p>

  <p>"Which force does Mu Ning belong to? How did she get to the 60th place?" someone exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie started to feel frustrated about the result. How could Mu Ning best Luo Zheng in the Illusion Battlefield rankings?</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I am not familiar with her. However, I heard that this woman has some strong background. If my memory serves me right, she seems to be from the Purple Power World," someone replied.</p>

  <p>"Purple Power World. Purple Power Body. So that's how it is!" Ning Yudie remembered that Mu Ning possessed the Purple Power Body and that she had once controlled several great swords with her astonishing power.</p>

  <p>But what Ning Yudie didn't know was that the Purple Power World had a say in the Upper World that Mu Ning could rank in the top 100 in the entire universe.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie was in her deep thoughts when the shadow of a whip suddenly flew towards her.</p>

  <p>Pak!</p>

  <p>The shadow of the whip exploded before Yudie's face!</p>

  <p>Although the whip did not physically hit her, the force from the blast pierced towards her like a sharp knife.</p>
