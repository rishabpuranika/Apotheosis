<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1258 Sword River </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The fact that the swords weren't returned immediately after being borrowed was a nuisance. Instead, they had been pulled down from the Southern Sky Region, attracting the attention of the purple-robed woman.</p>

  <p>'Could it be that someone is practicing the Colorful Sword Array?' she thought curiously.</p>

  <p>The Colorful Sword Array was a kind of sword array in the Purple Power World. For a cultivator to practice it, eleven thousand colossal swords had to be used.</p>

  <p>But what happened soon after made her disregard the assumption completely— the number of gigantic swords that were pulled out of the deep sky before her increased.</p>

  <p>At first, only one or two swords fell. In the next moment, the number grew to dozens, then hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands…</p>

  <p>There had to be over a hundred thousand swords coming down— the number of great swords left in the sky of the Southern Sky Region was dwindling.</p>

  <p>"So many are coming down. Is the person taking them as some kind of food?" The woman's expression shifted entirely.</p>

  <p>Although there was a great number of swords in the Purple Power World, there were also quite a lot of martial artists that possessed the Purple Power Body. Countless great swords would be borrowed out every day.</p>

  <p>But usually after these swords fell and fulfilled the task, they would be returned immediately. It was a rather normal thing to witness the swords constantly flying away and coming back.</p>

  <p>Very few people would ever attempt to summon all 99.9 billion great swords in one go— such a person who could do that would need to at least possess the first-rank Purple Power Body, which was the black- purple body. But warriors at such a level were already powerful in themselves and normally didn't need to use the swords. Although the weapons were powerful enough to destroy a great world, they weren't much of a threat to the most powerful masters. In dealing with the masters, these swords only served as an intimidation tactic.</p>

  <p>In the instance of two masters fighting against each other, if one of them had the ability to summon numerous swords, then the warrior could wipe out all the disciples and supporters on the other side.</p>

  <p>Still, it was a rare occurrence. A year ago, the giant swords in the Southern Sky Region had once been summoned away on a large scale.</p>

  <p>Although it wasn't clear who had done it, the astonishing number of swords being summoned away was enough to attract the attention of the powerful masters of the Purple Power World.</p>

  <p>Only when a high-rank Purple Power Body appeared could it be possible. At the very least, a third-rank blue-purple body or a second-rank exact-purple body warrior would be able to achieve it.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, many people were sent to search through the Purple Power World, hoping to find which Purple Power Body was responsible.</p>

  <p>But the search was fruitless and the powerful masters were left puzzled and at a loss.</p>

  <p>After a Purple Power Body had woken up, it instinctively had a sense of belonging to the Purple Power World. Clearly, the woman whose Purple Power Body just woke up didn't stay in the Purple Power World for long.</p>

  <p>It was an unusual thing as the person left no clues as to who she really was. In the end, they left the matters unsettled. If the woman didn't appear on her own accord, it was impossible for them to find her via space nodes.</p>

  <p>'Is this the woman who summoned the swords a year ago?' the purple-robed woman suspected.</p>

  <p>Generally, the warriors of the Purple Power World were well aware of the rules— unless one borrowed the great swords to practice the sword array, one wouldn't pull the swords down for no reason. It would take an extremely high-ranking martial artist to effortlessly control the swords.</p>

  <p>But this woman controlling the swords was going beyond anyone's imagination— she wasn't following the usual rules. Naturally, the purple-robed woman associated it with the matter from a year ago when flocks of swords went away and came back.</p>

  <p>As she pondered, she gently stomped her feet, making the ship turn around and take a dive.</p>

  <p>Whoosh… whoosh… whoosh…</p>

  <p>The swords were still raining down. Some were about to run into her ship, so she had no choice but to avert the ship and avoid a hit.</p>

  <p>"Oh… this hateful woman!" As she dodged the swords, she grew more and more agitated. Even if the person summoning the swords didn't know about the rules, she should at least have had some common sense.</p>

  <p>What the hell was she doing by pulling all the swords down there? Was she going to eat them all? They weren't food! After everything, she would have to return the hundreds of thousands of swords back to where they came from— that was no easy task.</p>

  <p>Following the swords' trajectory, the ship dove at an increasing speed.</p>

  <p>Soon after, the woman on the bow of the ship saw something that left her shocked and wide-eyed.</p>

  <p>Millions of gigantic swords were gathered below. It became clear that the woman in white hadn't only pulled down swords from the Southern Sky Region, but also a great number from the Northern, Western, and Eastern Sky Regions.</p>

  <p>Millions of weapons spiraled in the air, making more evident the river of swords. In spite of everything, it was a spectacular sight.</p>

  <p>"This…"</p>

  <p>Summoning the swords from other planes was a simple process— once a cultivator summoned them, they would simply slash down by inertia before disappearing. The Purple Power Body owner didn't need to operate anything after the summoning.</p>

  <p>But these huge swords formed a river, each of them moving under someone's precise control. When every weapon reached the end of the flow, they would turn around, merging into the river like a nimble fish.</p>

  <p>On top of that, a terrifying fact was how they did not make even a hint of noise as they surged. What did that mean? While controlling the millions of weapons, the person hadn't caused any two swords to clash together even once.</p>

  <p>The scene before the purple-robed woman was all too strange and shocking. She wondered how strong a power could be that it could control this volume of weapons to such a degree.</p>

  <p>Rolling up her sleeves, Margaret revealed her fair-skinned wrists. As she waved up toward the sky, her slender fingers trembled.</p>

  <p>At that point, she had yet to understand how she should practice her skills. On the one hand, she controlled the swords by mere instinct, but on the other hand, she was feeling rather bored.</p>

  <p>With a faint smile, she spoke to the Ancestral Dragon. "How was the show, little dragon?"</p>

  <p>"Caw, caw!" The dragon gave a long look at the river of swords flowing through the sky and suddenly shook its tail.</p>

  <p>With that response, Margaret smiled. "Then I'll show you more!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly, she stopped waving her hands and raised ten fingers upright.</p>

  <p>"Hooo… hooo… hooo…"</p>

  <p>All the swords stood upright in unison at her gesture.</p>

  <p>"Turn!"</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The several million swords formed a circular vortex in a slow rotation.</p>

  <p>Back on the ship, the scene left the purple-robed woman speechless.</p>

  <p>The Colorful Sword Array was an extremely powerful sword array among all in the universe.</p>

  <p>A beginner who had just begun to learn the skill had to learn to control eleven hundred gigantic swords.</p>

  <p>Once someone completely mastered the skill, one could control one hundred and ten thousand great swords with ease. The swords, of course, were not of top-grade— if warriors in the Spirit Supreme Realm happened to be rich enough, they could forge one hundred and ten thousand low-grade sacred weapons to be used in the sword array.</p>

  <p>But many masters in the Purple Power World could control 1.1 million great swords simultaneously— all of which were top-grade sacred weapons.</p>

  <p>As for the super masters, they were able to control as many as eleven million great swords. In the eyes of these super masters, however, the divine weapons weren't of much value. But because they couldn't find eleven million divine weapons, they could only mix in a few divine weapons in the array.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the one performing the stunt could control millions of gigantic swords with ease.</p>

  <p>What was even more unbelievable was how the sword array changed according to a certain pattern. Through continuous practice, one could control the sword array more accurately— the weapons didn't form the shape of a massive sword but instead formed varying figures.</p>

  <p>Whoosh…</p>

  <p>The purple-robed woman adjusted the angle of the ship and passed right by the densely packed bunch of swords. A woman in white stood below her, wearing a big smile— she controlled the swords with astonishing facility.</p>

  <p>'Indeed… she's merely playing with them…' The sight was rather disturbing to the purple-robed woman. 'She's a young girl at the Internal Elixir Realm. How could she be doing this?'</p>

  <p>Jealousy surged within her— usually, it was easy for women to fall victim to envy when faced with someone stronger than themselves. An Internal Elixir Realm martial artist was considered as weak as a newborn baby as far as the Upper World was concerned. Strictly speaking, a warrior at such level couldn't even be considered to have passed the threshold of martial arts. Nonetheless, the girl before her was freely controlling all the swords as she pleased. It was too unfair, she thought.</p>
