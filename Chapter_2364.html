<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng was ready to burn his bridges with his choice to fight back against a consummate True God.</p>

  <p>He had gone all out with the slash, nearly activating the strength source to the limit that his body could bear.</p>

  <p>In this world, Zheng couldn't use the internal momentum, so he couldn't fight using the Emotion Closing Godly Way. Despite that, he wasn't scared of Rachelle. His swordsmanship alone bested hers any day, and she couldn't use the Godly Way either.</p>

  <p>The terrifying power of the strike formed a heavy pressure in the air that Rachelle could feel, the thick sword blade ringing with the force.</p>

  <p>Rachelle snorted, a look of contempt appearing on her face.</p>

  <p>Instinctively, she twisted her left arm and raised her right arm.</p>

  <p>The sound of metal clashing rang through the air.</p>

  <p>Her short sword and machete had blocked the Great Weighty Sword in midair.</p>

  <p>Her momentary triumph was soon over, her face contorting in shock. The power from the Great Weighty Sword was nearly unbearable. Her arms became heavy and her feet sank into the yellow sand.</p>

  <p>She had no choice but to lower her weapons.</p>

  <p>The moment she had lowered her arms, Rachelle was left unguarded.</p>

  <p>Zheng seized this opportunity to charge forward. He brought the sword back to him, and readied to swing again. There was sharp whistle through the air as he swung it at Rachelle.</p>

  <p>The Great Weighty Sword was not effective at stabbing due to its weight, but that didn't change the fact it was still difficult for Rachelle to dodge the attack. Her only choice was to retreat.</p>

  <p>Zheng could not let Rachelle off so easily.</p>

  <p>Rachelle fled at an extremely fast speed, leaving a trace of a thin line in the desert sand.</p>

  <p>Zheng gathered an immense amount of power at his feet.</p>

  <p>Dust and sand clouded the air, a deep hole appearing under his feet. By taking advantage of the great force, Zheng turned into a sharp arrow. In this form, his speed was not inferior to Rachelle's.</p>

  <p>"Dream on if you think you can take me down!"</p>

  <p>She rarely took any weak consummate True God seriously, and would never take a low-rank True God as a serious threat.</p>

  <p>Only five or six Consummate True Gods in the rich clans could compete with her!</p>

  <p>To be forced away by a low-rank True God was shameful for such a proud woman as her.</p>

  <p>Even if she couldn't use her Godly Way, she could still subdue this brat with just her technique and strength.</p>

  <p>After retreating for more than one hundred feet, she suddenly lowered her body and used the short sword to circle the Great Weighty Sword.</p>

  <p>She gently lifted it and intended to use a mysterious and dexterous sword skill to deflect Zheng's Great Weighty Sword, and then to use the machete to cut off Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>In a battle between two gods, martial arts and hand-to-hand combat skills did not determine any kind of outcome. It was why True Gods never paid much attention to them.</p>

  <p>Even so, such bodily skills and martial arts were practiced among the True Gods of the large clans and they were quite good at them. These skills could often have a great effect in certain circumstances, such as now.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng was incredibly strong and powerful, the slash was easily deflected by Rachelle. A grin broke across her face, and pride swelled in her chest.</p>

  <p>The smug expression only lasted for a moment.</p>

  <p>Rachelle had no idea that Zheng's weakness lay in the Godly Ways. He hadn't dared to use the Emotion Closing Godly Way he cultivated, and in this world, there was no way for all of them to use it.</p>

  <p>But when it came to swordsmanship alone, Zheng wouldn't lose to anyone.</p>

  <p>Not even Rachelle.</p>

  <p>As soon as the Great Weighty Sword was deflected by Rachelle, the heavy sword swung back around and returned to point at her head.</p>

  <p>If Rachelle had insisted on dashing towards Zheng before her short machete was ready, the blade of his sword might have pierced her head.</p>

  <p>The attack that Rachelle had planned was easily countered by Zheng's Great Weighty Sword. She stopped herself from attacking once more, flustered by having had to dodge Zheng's attack.</p>

  <p>She would not accept this. After dodging the sharp blade, she turned her body once more and changed her moves to attempt a different attack.</p>

  <p>To her surprise, Zheng simply held his sword and casually pointed it at her again.</p>

  <p>Zheng had seen through Rachelle and her attempt. She was baffled, and now in a serious dilemma.</p>

  <p>One, two, three ...</p>

  <p>For several consecutive attacks, Zheng remained calm and stoic. He was like powerful master who was easily able to fluster and anger Rachelle.</p>

  <p>Rachelle felt like she was going crazy.</p>

  <p>Shahn, Walton and some others stood on the scorching sand with their arms crossed, and watched the fight.</p>

  <p>"This young man, surnamed Luo, can actually stand against Rachelle with his own sword technique?" Walton's face was slack jawed in surprise.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the consummate True Gods didn't mainly rely on such unimportant moves to fight, but those who had become consummate True Gods were by no means weak. Even if there were some weak consummate True Gods, they would not be worse than a low-rank True God.</p>

  <p>"His swordsmanship is very mysterious. With one technique, he could break tens of thousands of attacks. Rachelle was right. That boy is most likely from a universe," said Shahn flatly.</p>

  <p>Those who were able to escape from the universes were generally very talented. It could be said that these warriors, who had become ordinary creatures by relying on their own abilities, would be very popular in any Floating Island.</p>

  <p>However, Shahn and the others with him felt disdain for the secondary creatures that came from the universes.</p>

  <p>These secondary creatures had one common weakness - they paid too much attention to skills.</p>

  <p>Such as sword skills, martial skills, bodily movement skills and so on.</p>

  <p>In fact, ways were much more important than skills.</p>

  <p>The ways in the divine land naturally referred to the three thousand Godly Ways. Those secondary creatures in the universes were mostly focused on practicing skills. After entering the divine land, many of them would still indulge in practicing them. Actually, it was the same as losing substance for the shadow.</p>

  <p>The divine citizens had more access to the Godly Ways than secondary creatures. Naturally, they did not pay much attention to the comprehension of skills. Therefore, when Zheng had entered the divine land, he felt surprised seeing the awful martial arts skills that the divine citizens had cultivated.</p>

  <p>With Zheng and Rachelle locked in battle, the leaders of the Swallow, Eagle and Roc races were incredibly anxious.</p>

  <p>The three races had been with the Heavenly Wheel Snake for many years, and knew well about the habits of the snake. That beast's temper was very volatile, and if it felt the slightest disrespect, it would become enraged. Once angry it would release one or two Heavenly Wheel Bugs which would go on a rampage.</p>

  <p>The three races harbored deep hatred towards the snake, but it controlled the lives of all the people in this world. In front of the Heavenly Wheel Temple, they could only pay absolute respect to it for fear of retaliation.</p>

  <p>One of the Roc members couldn't hold back his anger any longer. He rushed to Shahn and spoke to him in the Roc language.</p>

  <p>Among this group of consummate True Gods, only Shahn was proficient in the language of the Roc race.</p>

  <p>Listening to the Roc member, Shahn furrowed his eyebrows. The man had relayed to him that the Heavenly Wheel Snake was becoming suspicious and cautious. If alerted, it would most likely not come and collect any tribute.</p>

  <p>If the fight between Rachelle and Zheng messed up anything, all their efforts would be in vain.</p>

  <p>With that thought in mind, Shahn strode quickly towards Rachelle.</p>

  <p>Rachelle's body was like a blood red shuttle, zipping around Zheng and looking for an opening to attack.</p>

  <p>Her speed still held an advantage, but every time she launched at Zheng, the unpredictable heavy sword would be ready for her to hit it. She would retreat with gritted teeth.</p>

  <p>This time, as Rachelle readied to rush Zheng, Shahn seized her wrist and pulled her back.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing?" Rachelle shouted in fury at Shahn.</p>

  <p>"If you continue to fight with that brat here, I'm afraid you'll alert that thing," he said, pointing at the huge statue of the Heavenly Wheel Snake.</p>

  <p>Rachelle was determined to kill Zheng however. She said in a cold voice,</p>

  <p>"Since that's the case, why don't you help me? Are you afraid that Troy will get angry and give you trouble?"</p>

  <p>Shahn considered her words for a moment, glancing at Zheng. "You're right."</p>

  <p>Shahn, Walton and the others didn't care whether Zheng was alive or dead.</p>

  <p>All they wanted was for Rachelle to stop making a fuss. Although Zheng had showed great strength in the world by virtue of his own advantages, the strength Zheng had displayed was nothing at all if the several consummate True Gods acted at the same time.</p>

  <p>When Zheng caught wind of this, ice chilled the blood in his veins. His middle and ring fingers curled up slightly. The two fingers were adorned with the rings which had belonged to the consummate True God of the Sword Clan. If these consummate True Gods were really going to attack him together, he would probably have no choice but to go all out to fight for his life.</p>

  <p>"We will help you finish this brat. After we return to the Floating Islands, you must make sure to offer some benefits to us though," said Walton, carrying a large machete and walking slowly towards them.</p>

  <p>The three consummate True Gods moved to surround Zheng. Clearly, they were planning to cut the Gordian knot to finish Zheng off quickly.</p>
