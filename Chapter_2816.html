  <p>
</p>

  <p>Watching the Truth Boats leave, Luo Zheng began to swim slowly.</p>

  <p>"Alas, unfortunately, the Sea of Truth cannot hide people. You will soon be found," No. 9527 declared, heaving a deep sigh.</p>

  <p>"Why do I need to hide?" Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>After staying in the Sea of Truth for a while, Luo Zheng had met over ten warriors, which meant there were many people crossing the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>"You still don't know what it means to roam in the Sea of Truth with the physical body," No. 9527 explained. "It won't be long before people in the entire Source World start discussing about this matter. Fortunately, they can't trace who you are unless you tell them. Remember that, otherwise, you will have endless troubles."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded slightly, acknowledging its advice.</p>

  <p>Although he knew nothing about the Source World, he knew that the Nine Li race was in a dangerous situation. Since his identity was so sensitive, he must be very careful about divulging information.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>Looking out of the sea, he asked, "How wide is the Sea of Truth? Do you know how long it will take to get across?"</p>

  <p>"How long?" No. 9527 repeated, thinking. "Travel time varies among people. Some might need several thousand years, or even over one million years, while some people might be able to cross the sea in just half a year.</p>

  <p>This is still a matter of talent and opportunity."</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, the Sea of Truth did not have a fixed width. For some people, it was probably impossible to cross it within their lifetime, but some people would be able to reach the Other Shore on the first try.</p>

  <p>"What about me?" Luo Zheng queried.</p>

  <p>"The Sea of Truth is divided into nine sections. I suggest that you try and see if you can make it through the first section," No. 9527 replied.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded, his expression reflecting his hesitation. "But I'm afraid the time is not enough."</p>

  <p>He did not forget that he was still in the void at the bottom of the ice coffin.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, those Holy Beings were still fighting fiercely. If he spent too much time here, who knew what would happen in the void?</p>

  <p>"Don't worry," No. 9527 said indifferently. "The time flow rate in the Sea of Truth is different from that of the outside world."</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, the smaller the world was, the slower the time flow rate would be. This was one of the truths in the chaos.</p>

  <p>For the same reason, time ran extremely slow in the chaos.</p>

  <p>The time flow rate in the Sea of Truth was slower than that in the Source World. On the other hand, the time flow rate in the divine land was faster than that in the Sea of Truth and the Source World.</p>

  <p>The time flow rate in the universe was extremely fast, while the time flow rate in a consummate True God's inner world was even faster.</p>

  <p>The time flow rate within a Soul Sea Realm warrior's inner world was extremely fast and everything developed in a blink of eye.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded, lowering his head to swim.</p>

  <p>Waving his arms faster, he sped up. Galloping in the sea like a flying fish, he rapidly advanced, leaving behind a series of long and narrow ripples.</p>

  <p>Soon, Luo Zheng was able to catch up with the boats that set out ahead of time.</p>

  <p>When Stanley and the others saw Luo Zheng quickly catching up with them, they felt a little nervous. With no intention to attack them, Luo Zheng quickly approached the boats, finally leaving them at ease.</p>

  <p>As her Truth Boat came closer to Luo Zheng, Sophia asked in a crisp voice, "Sir, why don't you have a Truth Boat?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng heard the girl but ignored her. He continued to swim forward.</p>

  <p>However, who would have thought that Sophia would actually push the Truth Boat forward? She came to him and asked, "How can your soul wander within the Sea of Truth?"</p>

  <p>Sophia came from a great clan and enjoyed a high status. Even after she entered the Taiyi Heaven Palace, she was favored by the elders. Finding that Luo Zheng seemed to be a kind person, she kept following behind him.</p>

  <p>"Sophia!" Seeing that Luo Zheng remained silent, Stanley shouted at her, "Don't disturb the master!"</p>

  <p>Stanley knew that it was a taboo to pry into others' secrets.</p>

  <p>This man swimming in the sea was indeed a kind person, but Stanley was afraid that Sophia would end up offending him. Moreover, Luo Zheng just ignored Sophia all the time.</p>

  <p>After Sophia was called out for her behavior, she felt a little morose. To add to that, Luo Zheng started swimming faster than before, making her fall behind after following for a while.</p>

  <p>Looking at Luo Zheng's figure shuttling through the sea, Sophia said to Stanley, "I don't think he is a master."</p>

  <p>"No matter who he is, we should not provoke any conflicts. The less trouble the better!" Stanley had always been a diligent learner. Compared with the others, he was more aware of what it meant to swim in the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng went further on the Sea of Truth, he felt that the magma around him became increasingly thick. Though the heat of the magma didn't cause him any trouble, the feeling of pain started striking him harder.</p>

  <p>Several hours later, he started feeling numerous sharp thorns stabbing into his body whenever he moved.</p>

  <p>He knew that the pain was not real. At least, his body wasn't hurt, but the feeling was enough to slow him down.</p>

  <p>"It's getting more difficult to move forward," Luo Zheng said with a frown.</p>

  <p>"You perform so well," No. 9527 announced with a faint smile. "Those guys behind you have almost given up."</p>

  <p>Far behind Luo Zheng, he could see the Truth Boats slowly moving forward.</p>

  <p>Sophia, Stanley and the others all gritted their teeth as the boats moved forward.</p>

  <p>What tested them was not the thick magma sea, but the gusts of wind that could go deep into the soul and even blow away the boats. For most of them, it was their first time to step into the Sea of Truth, so they would have no choice but to leave after suffering for a few days.</p>

  <p>After swimming another few miles ahead, Luo Zheng found a dividing band in front of him. After the magma crossed that band, it turned into dark red!</p>

  <p>At this point, the pain that Luo Zheng felt on his body had reached an unbearable level.</p>

  <p>He felt that his body went stiff. He had tried his best to activate all his strength, but his body was somewhat disobedient.</p>

  <p>"Let's stop here," No. 9527 said. "Once you pass the first section, the pressure will multiply. Your body will not be able to withstand it. And you will end up dissipating like the Soul of Light."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded. Floating on the surface of the sea, he stretched his body, hoping to ease the pressure his physical body had to bear.</p>

  <p>After a moment, he asked breathlessly, "How can I leave the Sea of Truth?"</p>

  <p>"I'll teach you," No. 9527 said with a grin.</p>

  <p>It had been said that the Sea of Truth was really illusion. Perhaps there were some special skills required to leave it.</p>

  <p>After a short while, Luo Zheng felt dizzy, his surrounding starting to spin a little.</p>

  <p>Once again, he saw himself in a sea of fire.</p>

  <p>His vision regained its focus with the red-eyed girl floating in front of him, her innocent eyes set on him.</p>
