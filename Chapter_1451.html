<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Each wind tunnel had a different trajectory, but the final destination for all would be on the other side of the cave.</p>

  <p>Zheng wasn't the first warrior to change the wind tunnel. For example, Lincoln and some other warriors had also changed the wind tunnel several times.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng's change in direction this time was completely incomprehensible to the other warriors. They believed that he had gone completely off course.</p>

  <p>Whether it was Lincoln or the other warriors, they were all rushing upward. Their goal was clear, since their only goal was the seed of the World Tree.</p>

  <p>This time, Zheng had switched from one wind tunnel to another, but his position was getting lower and lower.</p>

  <p>"Now, switch again!" Xun's voice came again, as a series of sharp barked commands.</p>

  <p>With a stomp of his feet on a towering stone pillar, Zheng broke away from the wind tunnel and once again changed his path! It was a combination of Zheng's physical prowess and Xun's dynamic directing.</p>

  <p>"Right! Now!"</p>

  <p>"To the left."</p>

  <p>With the crispness of Xun's series of orders, Zheng had almost completed a dazzling acrobatics performance! His body was a whir against the air as he darted and thrust, changing direction like a bird in flight.</p>

  <p>He leaped into the cave with the help of the wind, but he still stayed at the bottom of the cave.</p>

  <p>"Look at this guy. Is he here for doing acrobatics?" a warrior said as he looked at Zheng in a stunned daze.</p>

  <p>Even now, Zheng still hadn't been able to claim a single treasure. However, his movements made many warriors silently admire him in their hearts.</p>

  <p>If it were them, it would be difficult to have managed such aerial maneuvers, especially when they were all being swept away by the strong gales.</p>

  <p>After changing between wind tunnels thirteen times, Zheng arrived at the very center of the cave.</p>

  <p>When Zheng reached the center, a strange phenomenon occurred.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Zheng was neither advancing nor retreating. He was floating, suspended in the middle of the air. And around him, there seemed to be a slowly rising current of air that wrapped around his entire body, and made him float ethereally towards the seed of the World Tree at the top of the cave!</p>

  <p>"What… What's going on?"</p>

  <p>"This guy can't be flying by himself, right? This place clearly doesn't allow us to fly!"</p>

  <p>"I think there is a rising wind that is directly lifting Zheng up!"</p>

  <p>Witnessing this scene, Freya became extremely excited. The difficulty of getting the seed of the World Tree was so great that Freya did not even dare to think about it. There seemed to be nothing now that could stop Zheng!</p>

  <p>A look of excitement also appeared on Lincoln's face. Although he had not obtained this seed of the World Tree, Lincoln had always been in awe of the people who were stronger than himself. Lincoln could only respect him for doing what they had thought impossible!</p>

  <p>As for the warriors of the three sacred places of the Dark World, their eyes were almost spitting fire as they were also calculating Zheng's strength at the same time. In any case, this guy didn't belong to their three sacred places, so no one would back him, even if they killed him. They would not let him take the seed away. They began to plan how they could take the seed away from Zheng once he came down again.</p>

  <p>Outside the underground palace, the three sacred places' Saint Lords all had gloomy looks on their faces. This was not an outcome that they had envisioned.</p>

  <p>In fact, the Saint Lord of the sacred place of the ogres really wanted to send a message into the underground palace to ask his warriors to snatch that seed of the World Tree away from Zheng!</p>

  <p>His inner world had already solidified, and this World Tree's seed was no longer of use to him. However, if he were to offer this seed of the World Tree to another high ranking warrior, he believed that he would obtain a good return.</p>

  <p>But since that young man had obtained the World Tree's seed, he definitely wouldn't be so foolish as to keep it. He would definitely swallow it as soon as he got it. Then it would be out of the Saint Lord's reach forever.</p>

  <p>The look on the face of the Saint Lord of the human sacred place immediately became indifferent, but his eyes revealed an appreciation that couldn't be hidden. However, he was extremely confused about just how this young man had found that way to make the ascent?</p>

  <p>There were over a hundred wind tunnels in this cave, and there were loads of changes. However, Zheng had been able to switch between the wind tunnels and accurately reach the center of the cave. He even knew that there was a gentle, slowly ascending whirlwind. This was definitely not a coincidence. He must have had some prior knowledge.</p>

  <p>This suspicion also existed in Zheng's heart.</p>

  <p>When he was lifted up by this light whirlwind, Zheng asked, "Xun, how did you find this way?"</p>

  <p>Xun smiled, "In the past when I came to explore this cave, I already knew the principle of this cave. I also used the scented fog to outline the tracks of over a hundred wind tunnels, and only then did I realize that the wind tunnels in this cave were actually arranged in accordance to a certain array!"</p>

  <p>This array was an ancient array. When Xun had brought a group of clansmen into the underground palace, there was naturally someone who had recognized this array. It had soon become apparent that one had to enter the heart of this array if they wanted to obtain the seed of the World Tree.</p>

  <p>However, even though Xun had understood the wind array, she hadn't been proficient in it back then. Although she had seen through the flaw in the wind array, a single speculative error had made her float to the opposite side of the cave. The chance to gain the ultimate treasure was lost then.</p>

  <p>Xun had regretted it because she didn't get this World Tree's seed.</p>

  <p>After leaving the underground palace, she had learned more about this array. Even though it was not long ago, Xun had learned the lessons from her past, and with Zheng's precise coordination, it was easy for him to pass!</p>

  <p>Soon, Zheng arrived at the top of the cave, where the World Tree's seed was hanging from the vine.</p>

  <p>Under the envious gazes of the crowd, Zheng reached out his hand and grabbed the seed of the World Tree. With a light tug, the withered vine broke apart and the seed finally landed in Zheng's hand. He smiled in jubilation as he grasped the priceless treasure.</p>

  <p>As the seed nestled on the palm of his hand, Zheng examined it closer. The seed was extremely smooth, like a pebble that had been washed by water.</p>

  <p>He studied it closer but didn't notice anything special. It seemed like any other seed to the uninitiated eye. He asked, "Can I just directly devour this seed of the World Tree?"</p>

  <p>Xun nodded. "After you swallow it, you have to draw it into your cinnabar field. The seed will take root, and sprout in your internal world..."</p>

  <p>"But there is a problem," Zheng said, with worry etched on his face.</p>

  <p>"What problem?"</p>

  <p>"Since this seed of the World Tree is planted in the inner world, it will grow by absorbing the life vitality, right?" Zheng asked again.</p>

  <p>After some thought, Xun said, "You're right. Are you worried that it will not absorb your chaotic energy?"</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>Xun shrugged, indicating that she didn't know either. After all, even Xun had never heard of such a situation, where one could have no life vitality in his cinnabar field.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't think too much about it. He couldn't possibly give up on this World Tree's seed because of a minor worry, right? He wasn't that stupid.</p>

  <p>However, just as Zheng was about to swallow the World Tree's seed, a tall and sturdy warrior from the ogres roared from the other side of the cave,</p>

  <p>"Human brat! Put down the seed, and I can ensure your safety when you leave the underground palace later! But if you dare to swallow it, I can guarantee that this underground palace will be your grave!"</p>

  <p>Zheng floated at the top of the cave, looking down at the ogre warrior with ridicule on his face. He did not place much stock in the brute's threat.</p>

  <p>Just now, this ogre warrior was the one who had snatched away Freya's ice lotus!</p>

  <p>Zheng had already decided earlier, when the ogre had offended Freya, to kill this ogre warrior. However, this fellow still dared now to threaten him. Besides laughing in ridicule, Zheng could only sneer!</p>

  <p>With a grin, Zheng swallowed the seed in one gulp. Then, he drew out a beam of the chaotic energy from his cinnabar field, which allowed him to hook this seed down into his internal world. Zheng paused then and waited for a reaction.</p>

  <p>The chaotic sea in Zheng's body was still calm, not even a ripple could be seen!</p>

  <p>As for the other warriors, whenever they activated their cultivation methods, the Soul Sea within their bodies would stir up great, stormy waves. But, this rarely happened to Zheng's chaotic sea.</p>

  <p>This chaotic sea, which was condensed of chaotic energy, seemed to be much thicker than the life vitality seas which other warriors commanded.</p>

  <p>"Pop."</p>

  <p>After the seed of the World Tree had fallen into his cinnabar field, it went straight into Zheng's chaotic sea. There was only a ripple on the calm surface before it sank and disappeared.</p>

  <p>"That's it?" Sensing this continuing stillness, Zheng asked Xun.</p>

  <p>Xun shrugged and said, "What else do you want? The seed has already fallen into your cinnabar field. No matter what you do, you can't take it out now. Just wait and see. It will take some time for the seed of the World Tree to take root and sprout."</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Zheng nodded, and his eyes once again turned to that ogre warrior!</p>

  <p>As the ogre warrior saw Zheng swallow the seed of the World Tree like that, he felt a great pain in his heart, which made him feel like his heart had begun to drip with blood. Of course, it wasn't just him who was in a bad mood, the other warriors weren't happy either. They had all coveted the World Tree's Seed.</p>

  <p>Most people had this mentality. When they were unable to obtain something, they often wished for others to be unable to do so as well!</p>
