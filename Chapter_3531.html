<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>All of the golden blood around Zheng's body started to circulate, and the sclerites continued to unfold. His hands instantly became much thicker and stronger. The sclerites on his back broke through his skin, turning into sharp thorns.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the sclerite at the end of his backbone spread out completely and extended into a strong tail.</p>

  <p>The tail was similar to that of the Ghost Scorpion on the Other Shore. There was even a black needle embedded on its end!</p>

  <p>"What happened to me? Why did I change into this?" he complained. He awkwardly stood there like a fool as he observed the changes in his body.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, No. 9527 and the Regal Jade Spirit were used to the change of form. After all, they knew that the physical body was just a vessel.</p>

  <p>Zheng, however, was still unable to accept it at the moment. If he had three heads and six arms, at least he maintained the human shape, but now he was like a monster.</p>

  <p>"It's normal to change into the form of the Chaos Ancient God. Don't forget that my master, Gerald, is actually a huge scorpion. In the last round of chaos, he belonged to the Spiritual Scorpion Civilization," No. 9527 comforted him.</p>

  <p>Zheng had previously seen Gerald's initial appearance in the illusion created by the Snake Goddess, which was in the form of a huge scorpion. Still, he didn't expect himself to turn into a scorpion.</p>

  <p>He thought for a while, and then a helpless smile graced his lips. "You are right. I will not show my strange appearance in front of others!" he declared.</p>

  <p>He unfolded his hands again, and the green vortex began to gather between his thick palms.</p>

  <p>Square Truth Crystals appeared between his hands and quickly accumulated in the vortex. As he placed his hands above his head, a bright green star was formed.</p>

  <p>Despite his efforts to suppress it, it was already a thousand times more powerful than the previous Falling Star Palm. If the star fell, the training room would probably be destroyed completely. Thus, he was careful not to drop it.</p>

  <p>The energy aura of truth level the vortex had released carried a strong penetrating power. The Land of Sword Grief's training room could block most of the energy aura, but no one expected that someone had cultivated the truth-level theurgy inside it during the time it had been designed.</p>

  <p>Even the disciples on the first floor had sensed the energy aura. They were utterly surprised when they felt it.</p>

  <p>"What's going on in the first room?"</p>

  <p>"What kind of energy aura is that? Why can't the array of the training room block it?"</p>

  <p>"It's so strange. The array of the training room was designed by a great master. But why..."</p>

  <p>Although they were confused, they didn't dare enter the training room to check what happened. Nevertheless, they became more curious about Zheng.</p>

  <p>The energy aura lasted for only nine seconds. Zheng had absorbed all the energy in the vortex into the sclerites. At the same time, all the sclerites turned over and shrank back. He reverted back to the human form in the blink of an eye, and all the blood power of the Chaos Ancient God had returned inside the sclerites.</p>

  <p>To tell the truth, Zheng could also use the Chaos Ancient God's blood power even if he didn't activate his form. But if he wanted to try his best, he did have to turn into the strange appearance, which was like a scorpion.</p>

  <p>Now that he had a complete set of blood power, he could continue to cultivate Gerald's theurgy. The Falling Star Palm was just Gerald's basic theurgy, but the way the Truth Crystals would be utilized in the future was up to No. 9527.</p>

  <p>Yet, at that point, Zheng found that something was wrong with the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed he had swallowed.</p>

  <p>"The Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed is supposed to disappear after being refined, but why did this happen?" he asked curiously. Naturally, he was confused.</p>

  <p>The originally unfolded seed had fully divided into two parts inside his body. Between those two parts floated countless lines of various lengths.</p>

  <p>At that moment, his eyebrows suddenly shot up to his forehead. "These lines are the same as those of the Other Shore Key!"</p>

  <p>As he thought about it for a little while, the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed that he had swallowed before went up along his belly, and then he spat it out.</p>

  <p>After he had refined the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed, the inside of the seed was completely empty. When he placed the two parts of the seed together, those lines appeared again!</p>

  <p>"Apart from copying bloodline, does the seed have any other uses?" Just then, his eyes immediately flashed.</p>

  <p>As he recalled the Snake Goddess' reaction that day, he remembered that she had shown a rare, hesitant look when they discussed the matter of the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed.</p>

  <p>If it could only be used to carry the blood power, the Snake Goddess shouldn't have reacted like that.</p>

  <p>The thought of it made him even more interested in those lines!</p>

  <p>He stretched out his hand and flipped on the space ring, and a divine crystal appeared in his palm. Then, with a pinch of his hand, the divine crystal was shattered and the internal energy flowed onto the lines.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>A beam of pale blue light glowed, and the divine crystal had finally activated the Other Shore Key. A map appeared, along with a Sanskrit word!</p>

  <p>"It's true that there is an Other Shore Key inside this small Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed. It's amazing!" Zheng could not help but shout.</p>

  <p>Not only Zheng but also No. 9527 couldn't understand that.</p>

  <p>In the past few years, the Pear Hill had closely protected the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Tree so that the outsiders couldn't reach it. Only Fuxi and the Snake Goddess in the whole Source World knew the secrets contained in the seeds.</p>

  <p>At first, the Snake Goddess didn't want to hand over the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed, but over the past few years, there was no important information discovered from the seeds. Of course, it made Fuxi and the Snake Goddess disappointed. After all, the last seed was hung on the tree as their beacon of hope. They had never picked it off, and at last they gave it to Zheng.</p>

  <p>They didn't expect that there was an Other Shore Key hidden in the last seed!</p>

  <p>Zheng carefully protected the seed, and then sent it into his inner world to let Geoffrey decipher it.</p>

  <p>By now, Geoffrey was quite familiar with such things. After he had deciphered the Sanskrit word on the Other Shore Key, he said, "Stage Seventeen of the Other Shore..."</p>

  <p>Since Zheng now had the map and also knew that the temple was located on Stage Seventeen of the Other Shore, it would be easy for him to accurately confirm its position. The other words Geoffrey had said seemed to be meaningless, but they were similar to the Truth of Godly Way. With those words, he could bring the Other Shore Key straight to the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, he had done something similar on Stage One of the Other Shore. "Stage Seventeen of the Other Shore?" he said as his eyes narrowed slightly.</p>

  <p>Stage Seventeen was not far from Stage Fourteen. His current abilities could allow him to dash there in a snap.</p>

  <p>But, why was an Other Shore Key of Stage Seventeen hidden in the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed? Who had put this key inside? What did it have to do with the Pear Hill?</p>

  <p>After Zheng settled down in Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore, he decided to investigate this matter.</p>
