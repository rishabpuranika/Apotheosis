<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 191 Five-Clawed Golden Dragon (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>He pulled out the dagger fiercely, splattering blood on the dead leaves that surrounded Josef's body on the ground. Luo Zheng was not someone who condoned killing, but if he hadn't known how to use the Spiritual Thorn, he would have been the one dead right now. He could not afford to show mercy to anyone who wanted to take his life.</p>

  <p>"You are dead!" The general from the imperial army sprinted to him, his life vitality surging up and turning into a Five-Clawed Golden Dragon. It was burning in red-hot flames. The heat waves rushed to Luo Zheng, crackling with terrifying power.</p>

  <p>"Illuminating Soul Realm!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng twisted his lips. This was the second refiner at the Illuminating Soul Realm he had encountered.</p>

  <p>He had confronted Vale before, who was also an Illuminating Soul Realm refiner. Luo Zheng was weak before his formidable energy. He had no chance to fight back.</p>

  <p>The Illuminating Soul Realm could burn life vitality and magnify its power by more than ten times. It could kill the nature creatures as easily as an ordinary person could kill an ant.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng clearly knew very well how potent the refiner at the Illuminating Soul Realm was. He could only step back and retreat.</p>

  <p>But the Five-Clawed Golden Dragon, created by life vitality, seemed to have anticipated it. It pursued Luo Zheng forcibly, not giving up until it had swallowed him down its throat.</p>

  <p>Just then, Luo Zheng heard Nina shout at him. "Luo Zheng, get down!"</p>

  <p>Without hesitation, Luo Zheng leaned forward and rolled down to lie flat on the ground.</p>

  <p>With a roar, the Shock Dragon flew above Zheng's head and abruptly collided with the Five-Clawed Golden Dragon.</p>

  <p>Nina's Shock Dragon was equivalent to a full attack of an Illuminating Soul Realm refiner, but she didn't have the ability to fully control it.</p>

  <p>Thus, powerful as the hidden weapon was, it couldn't hit the target accurately.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng leaned forward. The Shock Dragon crashed into the Five-Clawed Golden Dragon.</p>

  <p>The attacks of the two strengths of Illuminating Soul Realm suffered a head-on collision at full speed. Undeniably, the power it produced was immense and terrifying. As the two dragons clashed, a gleam of bright light blazed forth. The disciples of the Cloud Sect and the imperial army soldiers shut their eyes instinctively.</p>

  <p>As the light disappeared, the general of the imperial army walked over to Luo Zheng, his jaw clenched and his eyes livid. "Even if it seems that someone from the Zhu clan is backing you, you still owe me an explanation. Why did you kill Josef?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stood his ground and stared back at the general defiantly. Stepping forward, he coldly said, "He deserved it!"</p>

  <p>"It's not up to you to decide whether or not he deserved it. His allegiance was with the imperial army, and only the army gets to decide his fate."</p>

  <p>Life vitality sparked in his hands. Soon, another mini Five-Clawed Golden Dragon took shape and hovered on his palm. "If you can't find an explanation, you must die!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng spat out a mouthful of blood on the ground. The collision between the dragons had released too powerful an energy to withstand, and the after effects had injured him. "What? Do you mean to tell me I should not have fought back when he placed the dagger on my neck? Do you expect me to just sit around and wait for death?"</p>

  <p>"The imperial army has millions of soldiers who are stationed at the White Emperor City. We have a strict code of discipline. If Josef wanted to kill you, he must have legitimate reasons!" the general said seriously.</p>

  <p>"Ha, I'm surprised you can say such shameless things so casually to my face. If that's so, why do you ask me to give you an explanation? You can just kill me straight away!" Even as he said this, Zheng's body was on high alert. The demonic life energy circulated inside of him, zapping through his spirit and bones.</p>

  <p>It was true that the person he currently faced was at the Illuminating Soul Realm, but he would not sit still and await death.</p>

  <p>"Oh? Then prepare to die." The general waved his hand, and the mini dragon took to the air and swelled into a gigantic Five-Clawed Golden Dragon. Flapping its strong wings, it circled the sky, emanating prodigious power.</p>

  <p>With a roar, the general of the army pressed his hands forward in the air and the Five-Clawed Golden Dragon ignited into flames and hurtled toward Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The dragon was born out of life vitality, and once the life vitality flared up, it was several times more powerful than normal.</p>

  <p>Watching the sight in front of them, Cleve, Lenard and the rest of the people standing at the gates of the barrack went pale and wide-eyed in shock.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was definitely capable of beating a demon general, and in their eyes, he had unmatched strength and skill. But would his power prevail against an opponent who was a refiner at the Illuminating Soul Realm?</p>

  <p>Between the half-step into nature level and the Illuminating Soul Realm, there was an entire realm that stood like a wall.</p>

  <p>The gaps between different strengths could be narrowed by other means, like super weapons, unique cultivation methods, talent, and technique.</p>

  <p>But the gap between Luo Zheng and the general was a broad moat with no way to close the distance, and taking all things into consideration, it was impossible for him to surpass it.</p>

  <p>The general of the imperial army declaring a war on Luo Zheng was equivalent to a death sentence.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stood before the daunting Five-Clawed Golden Dragon and felt his life energy surging out of his body through his navel, like high tidal waves forging ahead, finally gathering into his fists.</p>

  <p>"Heavenly Ogre Fist -Ogres Shaking the World!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had once used this punch to block the full blow of a refiner at the Illuminating Soul Realm before.</p>

  <p>His strength and his technique must have risen up by several notches since then. He felt far less anxious facing the general than when he battled Vale. Luo Zheng figured that the general was not on the same level of strength as Vale.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng struck the powerful blow with his fist, the demonic life energy gathered forward and molded itself into a purple-black shadow of a tight fist, smashing hard at the gargantuan dragon.</p>
