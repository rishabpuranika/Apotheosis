<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng was in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, his body had been tempered by Liusu's preternatural flames.</p>

  <p>Because of this, he was valued by the members of the Collapsing Mountain race. Otherwise, it would have been difficult for the two of them to leave the Collapsing Mountain race.</p>

  <p>Maybe because the smell of the Calamity Dispelling Fragrance could stimulate the most primitive instincts of any creature, the image of her and Luo Zheng hugging each other was deeply imprinted in Liusu's mind. It was fresh in her memory and was just one of the many indicators that she had been missing Luo Zheng all this while.</p>

  <p>But she was also certain that Luo Zheng was destined to be just a passerby in her life.</p>

  <p>He had carried a great mission, had incredible talent, and had great ambitions. But he was now going to complete something that seemed impossible.</p>

  <p>Even though Han Liusu was fully aware of this, she met Luo Zheng again and confirmed to herself that Tianxing and Luo Zheng were the same person. It was then that all her hesitation fell away and Han Liusu began to try her best to help Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>But she hadn't expected things to go like this. Luo Zheng had first killed Sheridan, and then Langston had wanted to kill Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>She had told Grant to ask her brother, Pascal, to come over to her as soon as possible. But Pascal had still not arrived.</p>

  <p>In a moment of desperation, Han Liusu hugged Luo Zheng. She then activated her Godly Tile and drew the blue unearthly fire from her inner world, letting the flames envelop Luo Zheng and her.</p>

  <p>"Oh my God! If she keeps doing this, she will burn Tianxing to death!"</p>

  <p>Aleyna exclaimed, looking at the fire in blank shock.</p>

  <p>But Kelsey whispered, "I wonder if Tianxing can bear the flames."</p>

  <p>"How can he resist her flames? Have you forgotten how formidable her flames are?" Aleyna retorted.</p>

  <p>They were the people closest to Han Liusu, so they knew her preternatural blue flames the best. Ever since Aleyna was a child, she had been warned not to get too close to Han Liusu. But Aleyna seldom heeded the warning and continued to run after Han Liusu.</p>

  <p>Whenever Aleyna was with Han Liusu, the unearthly fire that she could not control hadn't erupted.</p>

  <p>But several outbursts of Liusu's preternatural flames had left a horrible impression on Aleyna. Some members of the Han Clan had even died because of Liusu's flames, and there had been a period of time that no one in her clan had dared to serve her.</p>

  <p>Kelsey and Aleyna stared at this scene, shocked. Luo Zheng was only trying to help them, but now, their sister's flames were slowly burning him to death. They felt sorry for him.</p>

  <p>Langston and the disciples from other rich clans also believed that Luo Zheng would be burned to death.</p>

  <p>They had heard of Liusu's magical flames, and some had even lost to her many times in the Arena of Legends because of her flames.</p>

  <p>The blue flames circled Han Liusu.</p>

  <p>The others felt the temperature of the unearthly fire but couldn't see what was going on inside it. No one could go through it despite their great powers of perception. And strangely enough, Han Liusu didn't look like she was going to stop.</p>

  <p>Langston stared into the flames for a long time. He hated Luo Zheng to the core, so much that although Luo Zheng had probably burnt to ashes, he wanted to see that with his own eyes. But Han Liusu didn't have the slightest intention to stop the fire.</p>

  <p>Since she had the cultivation base of a low-rank True God, she could effortlessly keep the fire going for ten days.</p>

  <p>"Enough, Han Liusu!" Langston said, fighting to maintain the calm in his voice. The resentment in his eyes had simmered down a little.</p>

  <p>He had been very excited to see Zheng's end, but he had calmed down enough to think about the Leng Clan as a whole and not his own personal vengeance. He had been impulsive and had forgotten what his father had taught him. But now, he began to realize that his impulsive behavior would spoil the great plan.</p>

  <p>Once the Leng Clan's plan was carried out, the Han Clan would turn to nothing.</p>

  <p>The flames were still crackling fiercely, drowning out any other sound in the vicinity.</p>

  <p>"If you don't stop the fire, I will extinguish it forcefully," Langston threatened Han Liusu.</p>

  <p>He couldn't put the fire out completely, but he could split the fire in half to see what was going on.</p>

  <p>But Han Liusu didn't pay him any heed.</p>

  <p>Within the flames, Han Liusu hugged Luo Zheng tightly again.</p>

  <p>She hadn't experienced a lot in her life. She was the first daughter of the Holy Emperor of the Han Clan, was regarded as his beloved daughter and was treated much better than her brother, Pascal. But she had spent most of her time being lonely and helpless. She had hated the unearthly fire in her body ever since she could remember. She had always been regarded as an alien because of this fire.</p>

  <p>But nowadays, many young people of the rich clans envied Liusu's talent. With the extreme power of her unearthly fire, Han Liusu easily ranked third among the low-rank True Gods, and she still kept making progress. But they didn't know how much she had hated her talent in the past.</p>

  <p>The fire that enveloped Han Liusu and Luo Zheng had two layers.</p>

  <p>Han Liusu now had better control over the flames. The flames on the inner layer spun rapidly and could almost protect them from everything.</p>

  <p>But she was still a little worried. If Langston really wanted to break her flames, he could probably do it.</p>

  <p>She touched Zheng's face lightly, as she took in his golden body. The tiny golden Sanskrit words were still rotating and absorbing her flames.</p>

  <p>At first, Han Liusu had not been so sure that Tianxing was Luo Zheng. But she was now confident of this fact. Only Luo Zheng would be unharmed in her unearthly fire.</p>

  <p>A feeling of happiness crept up on Han Liusu at this.</p>

  <p>She liked Luo Zheng not because he had excellent talent or strength, but because she had a feeling that they were destined to meet and be together.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng seemed to be born to refine his body with flames, and could become stronger in the process of burning. On the contrary, Han Liusu was born to release this strange fire. She felt that she and Luo Zheng were a perfect match.</p>

  <p>Women always believed this when they were in love and there was no doubt that Han Liusu was at this stage.</p>

  <p>"Why did you have to change your identity in the Han Clan's Floating Island? Why didn't you look for me?" Han Liusu asked in a low voice.</p>

  <p>If Kelsey hadn't gone to the Han Clan's ancestral land and they hadn't encountered such an incident, Han Liusu would never have known that Luo Zheng had entered the Floating Island.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't say anything. Instead, he looked at her innocently, as if he didn't know her.</p>

  <p>At first, Luo Zheng had intended to deny his identity, so that Han Liusu would have nothing to do with it. Never had he thought that he would eventually need this woman to protect him. And his physical body was undergoing some changes as it burned in this unearthly fire. But now, he couldn't deny his identity anymore, since Han Liusu had figured it out on her own.</p>

  <p>"Were you afraid that I would betray you?" Han Liusu asked, fuming.</p>

  <p>She did know Zheng's identity and some of his secrets, but it didn't mean that she would sell him out to the Hall of Holy Beings. She had no intention of doing that. Instead, she would try her best to help Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>At the earnest expression on her face, Luo Zheng said in a low voice, "No. I'm just afraid you'll be implicated."</p>

  <p>In fact, Luo Zheng thought that Han Liusu and Aleyna were the uncontrollable factors to his plans. But he was also afraid of getting them into trouble.</p>

  <p>Because once the elders of the Han Clan came to know the truth, they would not take Zheng's side anymore. And then, it would be even more difficult for Han Liusu to deal with the situation.</p>

  <p>At Zheng's answer, Han Liusu looked up at him and said softly, "If I were to be involved, I would be in a much better place than the one I am in right now."</p>
