<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Since the girl's uncle was able to dig out this piece of mud, there was a very high possibility that there would be another. Hopefully, there would be a third, or maybe even more.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng also had a headache due to that little girl's character. She was simply a girl who saw only money. Without any hesitation, she had already tricked Luo Luo Zheng once. If he went to her directly, he would probably be ripped off again.</p>

  <p>However, the condensation of his Godly Tile was the most important thing for Luo Luo Zheng at that moment. If he really could find the other pieces of mud, then he would have to accept it no matter the cost. The condensation of his Godly Tile was worth more than mere divine might coins.</p>

  <p>As he thought about it, Luo Luo Zheng could no longer stay calm. A conflicted expression appeared in his face. After he lifted the seal on Master Evil, he asked, "Do you know where that little girl came from?"</p>

  <p>Master Evil was surprised by Luo Zheng's query. With a curious tone, he asked Luo Luo Zheng, "That piece of mud, is it really effective on you?" When Master Evil saw Luo Zheng's expression, he naturally understood that Luo Luo Zheng had bought the right thing. However, he was still confused about the use of that piece of mud.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded, "Yes, it is very important to me!"</p>

  <p>"That young lady claimed to be from the Tie Clan. It must be the Tie Clan outside the Six-Burden Divine City," Master Evil said as he recalled.</p>

  <p>As the ancestral land of the Han Clan, the Six-Burden Region was much larger than those small regions. However, the surname Tie was not a great one, and even Master Evil only knew one Tie Clan in the Six-Burden Region. It was a rather small and unknown group. Master Evil smiled and said, "The Tie Clan is not even considered as one of the third-tier clans in the Six-Burden Region, so they can't force their way into the Six-Burden Divine City. After so many years, there seems to be no sign of them to rise to prominence."</p>

  <p>The great and small clans in the divine land all aimed to control the divine cities. Once they controlled any random divine city, they could receive a large number of divine might coins every year without any risks. As such, if they could take over any divine city, a clan would be more powerful and wealthier. Every clan's leader had always wanted to become a city lord.</p>

  <p>However, the number of divine cities was limited. As such, the various great clans moved to the central divine cities under the control of the wealthy clans on Floating Islands. Each wealthy clan possessed a vast number of divine cities. They would sometimes let a great clan take control of it with a certain negotiation. For example, the divine cities of the thirty-six regions were all controlled by the Han Clan. To get a divine city, all smaller clans needed the Han Clan's permission.</p>

  <p>The Tie Clan was not qualified to enter the city. Moreover, they even relied on a small stall in Money Alley. Their influence was not really big.</p>

  <p>As such, Master Evil concluded that the development of the Tie Clan was not very good.</p>

  <p>After he got a rough comprehension of the situation of the Tie Clan, Luo Luo Zheng planned to go to the Money Alley to look for the little girl.</p>

  <p>Master Evil faintly smiled, "Although I know that the mud is very important to you, you seem to have forgotten that the divine land is different from the Evolutionary Universe."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was confused for a moment. After a few seconds, an expression of realization painted his face as he immediately understood what Master Evil meant.</p>

  <p>Previously, Luo Luo Zheng had spent quite a bit of time traveling from the Misty Mountain Village to the Mirror City. Although the Tie Clan was located outside of the Six-Burden Divine City, the distance between them shouldn't be too close, especially with Luo Zheng's current speed. Even if he rushed to the Tie Clan, it would still take a lot of time. Additionally, the test of the Heavenly Han House was very near. He couldn't afford to travel such a far distance.</p>

  <p>"Since that's the case, we shall wait for the exam to be over before we consider it," Luo Luo Zheng nodded his head.</p>

  <p>The divine land was endless. Without a Roaring Token, Luo Luo Zheng was like an ant that pathetically crawled under the leaves of a primal forest. The divine land was too vast for him, and right now, he couldn't even communicate with his father's disciples. He was stuck in an unfamiliar environment.</p>

  <p>If he could be accepted by the Han Clan, not only could Luo Luo Zheng borrow Han Clan's resources to cultivate, he could also approach the Floating Islands as fast as he could. Both of these goals were equally important to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>As such, the dilemma still conflicted with his mind.</p>

  <p>A few days later, the Heavenly Han House's test finally began. Countless warriors were eager to prove their abilities.</p>

  <p>This year's hot spots had already been listed and posted in the Six-Burden Divine City.</p>

  <p>All the proving godly warriors from first to third place all had the same surname, Han.</p>

  <p>Though those warriors were all merely disciples from the Han Clan's branches, their surname was still something they could be proud of. In reality, the people who managed the Han Clan's ancestral land all belonged to the small branches of the Han Clan. Some of them who were in-laws even took the initiative to change their surname to Han.</p>

  <p>The real Han Clan had long gone to the Floating Island. Luo Luo Zheng had met the two Han sisters in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. Both of them radiated beauty and prestige. Even in the real Han Clan, their status was extraordinary.</p>

  <p>However, even if it was just the Han Clan's branch family, they were still far more powerful than the ordinary second-tier and third-tier clans. In the past, the five most popular people in the Heavenly Han House usually had the surname Han.</p>

  <p>However, there were some exceptions this year. The nameless young man who defeated Eric in one move in the Brilliant Moon Restaurant was ranked fourth. Everyone was still in awe of how the nameless young man defeated Eric.</p>

  <p>The vast space within the Heavenly Han House was now filled with a sea of people. Countless warriors wanted to be a part of the Heavenly Han House.</p>
