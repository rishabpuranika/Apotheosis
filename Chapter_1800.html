  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng had a plan. As the universe was in turmoil, he would gather all of the important people around him into the fairy palace when he returned to the Lower World.</p>

  <p>While they remained under the protection of the fairy palace, they would be absolutely safe.</p>

  <p>However, because of the space imprisonment, this plan could not work.</p>

  <p>The seven people filed silently behind Zheng. Despite their silence, he could sense their nervousness.</p>

  <p>Although they were powerful, they were still too young and inexperienced for what laid ahead of them.</p>

  <p>The growing tension among the group caused their hearts to pound until they were clanging like fifteen buckets in a single well as they trudged along.</p>

  <p>The depressing atmosphere weighed heavily on Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>Tianming had told him that the idea of destiny was only a beautiful lie, but he wouldn't let that stop him. Since they had made it this far, he had to ensure that they made it through to the end.</p>

  <p>By this time the outline of the Cloud Hall was faintly discernible in the clouds. When Zheng approached, he found that the hall was now empty and almost all the warriors had left.</p>

  <p>Considering the ferocity of Supreme Lords' fights, this sort of retreat was meaningless.</p>

  <p>If the Torch Dragon and Supreme Lord Mirage had wanted to fight in the Central Region, in only a few moves, the entire Central Region would have collapsed.</p>

  <p>In the face of such absolute strength, weak warriors were unable to resist.</p>

  <p>They were like fish on a chopping block.</p>

  <p>Given Zheng's current cultivation level, the warriors of the Central Region were unable to catch up with him. However, it did not change anything.</p>

  <p>It did not take long for Zheng to find Yudie in the Ice Palace at the top of the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>She sat cross-legged in the middle of the palace, focusing on her cultivation.</p>

  <p>The life vitality in the Lower World was far too thin. The cultivation speed of warriors at the Soul Sea Realm was far below those in the Upper World.</p>

  <p>Zheng descended along the Ice Palace's patio with the other seven Godly Geniuses following closely behind him.</p>

  <p>Startled by the commotion, Yudie opened her eyes and glanced around her.</p>

  <p>Her face was etched with the signs of a sleepless night. She had been busy all night but her exhaustion was mental rather than physical.</p>

  <p>She found herself continually tense. There were so many things that scared her.</p>

  <p>She was worried that Zheng would not return, that the powerful warriors would destroy the Central Region, and that something bad would happen to her son Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>When her eyes saw Zheng, a smile spread across her tired features.</p>

  <p>"Where's Geoffrey?" Zheng asked softly.</p>

  <p>"My master has taken him to the east. He should be safe there," Yudie replied.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, the seven Godly Geniuses thought within themselves. Safe?</p>

  <p>There wasn't anywhere in this great world that was safe. No matter where they hid, unless they were careful, they could still be affected by the Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>Silently Zheng agreed with them. He had personally used his power transfer to destroy a piece of the savage land. He knew that hiding was useless.</p>

  <p>However, he wasn't planning to let the disciples of the Cloud Hall return.</p>

  <p>It was just what people thought. Even if they knew that there was no escape, they would still stubbornly look for a safe place to hide away.</p>

  <p>Zheng did not make a specific suggestion for the next step.</p>

  <p>His followers waited quietly in the Ice Palace, meditating.</p>

  <p>Margaret didn't meditate. She fell asleep while leaning against Zheng.</p>

  <p>Yudie threw her eye on Margaret, wondering how she could fall asleep at a time like this.</p>

  <p>Lone and Lucille refused to give up. After an intense discussion, they each proposed a solution to their predicament.</p>

  <p>Lucille was considering eliminating the effects of the Moon Shrouding Stone and using the repelling force of the great world to force them out.</p>

  <p>Quickly, she took action.</p>

  <p>Once she released the Moon Shrouding Stone, the repelling force of the great world bore down on her body.</p>

  <p>The irresistible force would bring her all the way into the ascending passageway. This gave the other Godly Geniuses a ray of hope. Perhaps they could use the ascending passageway to break free from their space imprisonment.</p>

  <p>However, things did not go as they had hoped. Lucille lightly flew off into the sky but soon stopped in midair. The ascending passageway failed to appear.</p>

  <p>With a sigh, they realized that they should not have been surprised. The ascending passageway was a manifestation of the Space Law, and now that the space had been locked, it was naturally impossible for the passageway to appear.</p>

  <p>Lone's solution was even more direct.</p>

  <p>Since they were trapped in this great world, unable to use the Space Law, then they should be able to directly pierce through the gale stratum.</p>

  <p>Although the gale at the top of the world was immensely powerful, they still had a way to resist it.</p>

  <p>They considered that there was a high chance that this plan could succeed. After Lone had suggested it, Lawson immediately agreed.</p>

  <p>Then, the two of them, along with Kurt, set off from the top floor of the Cloud Hall and headed upwards.</p>

  <p>Four hours later, the three of them returned to the Cloud Hall in low spirits.</p>

  <p>Just by looking at their expressions, Zheng knew that they had failed.</p>

  <p>"We encountered an impenetrable space after passing the gale stratum.</p>

  <p>We tried everything we could think of, but we still couldn't pass through it," Lawson said gloomily.</p>

  <p>Zheng uttered a few words of consolation. They had no choice now but to wait.</p>

  <p>Unknown by them, the night had passed and the sky was quickly lightening.</p>

  <p>Tianming quietly stood up and unsheathed his Soaring Snake Sword. With a light wave of his sharp sword tip, a small crack appeared in the air.</p>

  <p>The other side of the space was normally dark. Even when a crack was opened, it should have been hard to see anything.</p>

  <p>However, now the situation was different. The Torch Dragon was fighting with Supreme Lord Mirage and Tianming wanted to take a closer look.</p>

  <p>When Lucille saw his movement, she asked nervously, "What's the situation like?"</p>

  <p>Tianming shook his head. "I can't see anything."</p>

  <p>There were no obstructions at the back of the space, so the Torch Dragon and Supreme Lord Mirage had gone far away.</p>

  <p>Everyone was relieved by his reply.</p>

  <p>At the very least, they were already a long way from the Central Region, even if the distance was only a single step for the Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Zheng sensed a powerful aura descending. The other Godly Geniuses had the same feeling, including Yudie. Moreover, all of the life forms in the Central Region had also felt it, so they subconsciously looked towards the sky.</p>

  <p>As that majestic aura seemed to fill the sky, the hearts of hundreds of millions of lives below throbbed in expectation.</p>

  <p>The clouds at the top of the Cloud Hall continued to surge and rapidly dissipated to their surroundings like a huge, reverse vortex.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, seven figures descended to the ground. The Godly Geniuses raised their heads to take in the seven figures as they approached.</p>

  <p>"Patriarch!"</p>

  <p>Nathan was blind but that did not stop him sensing the aura of Supreme Lord of Original Sin.</p>

  <p>Since yesterday, he had been in a state of panic, but now as he felt the aura of the patriarch of his clan, he found himself able to relax.</p>

  <p>As far as he was concerned, Supreme Lord of Original Sin was the strongest warrior in the universe. Since he was here, his safety was no longer in doubt.</p>

  <p>Nathan was not the only one reassured. Lucille, Kurt, and the others also let out a long sigh. It no longer mattered whether or not this great world was a trap. It would be much safer now as their elders had joined them.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord of Original Sin was not alone. He had arrived with Master Feng, Supreme Lord of Oracle, Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment and others.</p>

  <p>To judge by outward appearance, all the troubles caused to the universe by the sorcerer race had been solved. However, the Supreme Lords all appeared grim, including Master Feng who was always amiable.</p>

  <p>Obviously, the situation was more troublesome than they had thought.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord of Original Sin swept his gaze over the Godly Geniuses.</p>

  <p>After confirming that they were all present, he said lightly, "Take them away."</p>

  <p>At once, Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment raised his sleeve, a bag immediately appeared and sucked in Nathan and the others one by one.</p>

  <p>When it was Zheng's turn, he jumped to one side and said sullenly, "I won't leave."</p>
