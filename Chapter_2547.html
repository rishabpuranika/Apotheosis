<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2547 Different Methods </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>After giving Luo Zheng a warning, Amos started looking for wild bones.</p>

  <p>Sarah and Hiram followed suit.</p>

  <p>These people all had different methods when it came to searching for wild bones. While Sarah held a small, round mirror in her hand, there was a slight fluctuation of Wild God Power from it. Through the object, she could identify the general direction of the wild bones.</p>

  <p>But the precision of such a method was undoubtedly low. Even if she managed to determine the position, it took a long time to find the actual bone.</p>

  <p>In contrast, Hiram's method was much more violent.</p>

  <p>He pulled out his one thousand-foot long rake from his space ring and activated the Wild God Power in his body. Then he turned into a thousand-foot tall giant.</p>

  <p>Wielding the rake, he pressed it into the ground and continued turning over the bones in the soil.</p>

  <p>Deep furrows appeared on the plowed ground? the rake struck the bones and they were attached to it.</p>

  <p>It was quite an efficient way to look for wild bones.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Sarah and Amos gazed at Hiram's thousand-foot long rake with admiration.</p>

  <p>He belonged to a large sect under the command of the Nine Li race. His rake was not something any ordinary Wild God could possess.</p>

  <p>Since the other three had already started, Luo Zheng couldn't just sit by idly.</p>

  <p>Compared to the other warriors' skills, his only reliance was his spiritual sense.</p>

  <p>The others were not on the same level as Luo Zheng in terms of using spiritual sense.</p>

  <p>After choosing an area, Luo Zheng, standing above the heap of bones, bowed his head and unfocused his eyes as an invisible spiritual sense spread from his figure.</p>

  <p>He could then spot every piece of bone within a dozen miles? he saw their shapes, sizes, and properties.</p>

  <p>"It's... It's..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's pupils contracted as he came upon a pleasant surprise.</p>

  <p>He had already observed the place when he flew into the air.</p>

  <p>The Immemorial Wilderness was indeed rich with wild bones. But he wasn't expecting them to be abundant in the area Amos chose, beyond his imagination.</p>

  <p>Using his spiritual sense, he found that over a thousand wild bones were there, and within the depths of the ground, there was one over ten feet long!</p>

  <p>Having come to the wilderness many times already, Amos and the others were rather experienced? they knew where they could gain many wild bones safely.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's figure flashed by as he extended a hand towards the ground.</p>

  <p>An invisible force drilled into the ground along the cracks of the bones, including the wild bones.</p>

  <p>Then, he lifted his hand.</p>

  <p>Splash... dozens of wild bones shot towards his right hand and Luo Zheng merely pulled them all up.</p>

  <p>Turning his right hand, he activated the space ring so the bones could go straight into it smoothly.</p>

  <p>Both Sarah and Hiram often relied on their luck to dig out the wild bones. Luo Zheng's method was incomparably more precise and efficient.</p>

  <p>In less than five minutes, Luo Zheng had dug up almost all the wild bones in the area. At last, he stopped at an open space.</p>

  <p>"The ten-foot-long wild bone is buried ten thousand feet underground. If I want to dig it out, it'll cause a lot of noise and draw attention to myself."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was looking quietly at Sarah, Hiram and Amos who were standing far away from him.</p>

  <p>An invisible force suddenly formed a high-speed spinning spiral and started drilling down.</p>

  <p>"Crack, crack, crack..."</p>

  <p>The high-speed spiral of the strength source instantly threw numerous bones into the air.</p>

  <p>And in the blink of an eye, Luo Zheng had created a huge pit.</p>

  <p>The loud noise immediately drew the others' attention.</p>

  <p>Sarah shook her ponytail in surprise.</p>

  <p>With a smile, Hiram focused on his own work and kept waving his long rake.</p>

  <p>"What the hell is that guy doing?"</p>

  <p>From nearby, Amos pulled a long face as he walked towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>On his shoulder was a small squirrel observing its surroundings. It was rather lovely, with golden hair and a talent for being very sensitive to the Wild God Power. Many people who looked for the wild bones tamed the squirrel and brought it along with them like Amos, who relied on the little creature to sniff out wild bones.</p>

  <p>Splash...</p>

  <p>More and more bones of all shapes and sizes were pushed from the pit and piled around it.</p>

  <p>In less than three minutes, the pit had reached eighty feet deep.</p>

  <p>"It's almost done!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stood at the very bottom of the pit and spread out his hands. His strength source entered over two thousand feet underground and quietly turned into an invisible ring of power, tightly clinging to the ten-footlong wild bone.</p>

  <p>"Rise!"</p>

  <p>Dragging along the huge wild bone, Luo Zheng ascended slowly.</p>

  <p>Numerous bones were pressed on the large one and it took Luo Zheng quite a lot of effort just to pull it up.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Amos stood at the edge of the pit and looked down.</p>

  <p>He was utterly dissatisfied about Luo Zheng making such a big move. In his eyes, Luo Zheng had no means of finding wild bones, so this could only make things worse.</p>

  <p>This wilderness was extremely dangerous? if anyone was discovered by the Yellow Emperor race, it was likely to cause a calamity of death. He intended to warn Luo Zheng thoroughly about not messing around.</p>

  <p>But confusion struck him when he looked down.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng seemed to be struggling to drag something up. The huge bones at the bottom of the pit were also pushed aside, as though an enormous monster was about to emerge.</p>

  <p>"What the hell is going on?" Amos muttered, staring into the pit.</p>

  <p>Soon, he realized what was going on? a huge bone peeked out from the bottom of the pit. Luo Zheng was pulling it up himself!</p>

  <p>The larger the bone was, the more powerful its Wild God Power was.</p>

  <p>As soon as Amos got a glimpse of it, he felt a great Wild God Power immediately.</p>

  <p>"This is a wild bone, about ten feet long!" Amos' eyes gleamed with shock. "How is that possible? How did he find one?"</p>

  <p>In the Immemorial Wilderness, the bones first found were generally on the earth's surface.</p>

  <p>Some of them were huge and some were over ten thousand, or even a hundred thousand feet long.</p>

  <p>But the huge wild bones had long been occupied by the powerful warriors of the bone towers. It was difficult for ordinary Wild Gods to search for any of them.</p>

  <p>There were always some sort of huge wild bones hidden deep underground, waiting to be taken away.</p>

  <p>It was difficult for ordinary Wild Gods to find such bones with ordinary methods. Both Amos' squirrel and Sarah's bronze mirror failed to sense anything that deep underground.</p>

  <p>It was also impossible for Hiram to plow the entire Immemorial Wilderness thoroughly enough with his rake. The wild bone was about ten feet long.</p>

  <p>It was equal to nearly three thousand wild bones.</p>

  <p>At the thought, greed filled Amos' eyes.</p>
