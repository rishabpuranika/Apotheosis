<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>After being enlightened by the Dipamkara Buddha, Jeffery had only one thing in his mind right now? to find a place where he could put his newly discovered wisdom and knowledge into practice.</p>

  <p>It had become his top priority? even more important than obtaining Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>"I guess it's also time for me to leave. I'll see you around!" Hailey bid the others goodbye. Judging by the tone of her voice, she had no plans of staying in the main city anymore and she was ready to leave any moment with no intention to look back.</p>

  <p>With all the words said, they all knew that it was the end of this so-called team. Short-lived as it might be, but they were all grateful for whatever friendship they had made. Indeed, all good things must come to an end.</p>

  <p>While everyone was saying their goodbyes, Janet just stood there, silently petting the little flame kitten in her arms. When she noticed the sudden silence around her, she looked up and saw everyone looking at her. She then turned to Luo Luo Zheng and saw the look on the latter's face as if asking her about her plans. She tilted her head, smiled, and said to him,</p>

  <p>"I'll just follow you around!"</p>

  <p>"Why would you do that?" Luo Luo Zheng asked. Luo Luo Zheng was no master of concealing his feelings. It was obvious just by looking at his face that he was baffled by Janet's plan.</p>

  <p>"Nothing fancy. I just want to watch how you will defeat other warriors, that's all!" Janet replied with a sweeter smile.</p>

  <p>Although he was used to being alone, Luo Luo Zheng also wouldn't mind some company. He figured that the Illusion Battlefield would soon change significantly so before that happened, he would keep on challenging other warriors. So instead of arguing with Janet about her decision, he would just let her tag along.</p>

  <p>Besides, he intended to save all his energy for his end game. Despite having a very high ranking, it wasn't good enough for Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>His final goal was to complete the Illusion Battlefield. Looking back, Luo Luo Zheng had already obtained interesting rewards in the Hall of Causality. So, he figured that the final event would be bigger and would mean more marvelous rewards. Of course, he didn't know for sure. But since he was already here, there was no harm in completing the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, several warriors could be seen from a distance. They were casually walking towards the direction of Luo Zheng's group. Each was from a different race, and the one leading them was a male member of the Demon Night race which was quite an unusual sight to see. As the group of warriors finally approached them, their leader said in a frivolous voice, "Hey, look who we have here! What a coincidence! I didn't expect to see you here, Hailey!"</p>

  <p>The man who greeted Hailey stood out among his companions with his undeniably rare features? green curly hair, a dark red mole on his forehead, and most especially his pair of narrow demonic eyes.</p>

  <p>Hailey was about to leave when she suddenly heard the man's voice. Her body trembled as she slowly turned around to see him and her face darkened at the same time.</p>

  <p>From the look on Hailey's face, Janet, Jeffrey, and the others already knew? this man was no friend and had ill-intentions towards Hailey.</p>

  <p>"Mmm-Ma... Malachi..." Hailey said. Her voice trembled and she couldn't almost speak. Of all people, Hailey didn't expect to meet Malachi? to think that the Illusion Battlefield was so massive that the chances of them bumping to each other was little! Fate must have brought them here!</p>

  <p>Hailey's performance in the Hall of Causality was quite exemplary.</p>

  <p>Although she rarely spoke to others, she had impressed them all with her calmness and alertness. But it seemed that the Hailey they knew suddenly disappeared. It was surprising to see Hailey so anxious and restless in front of this Demon Night male. Her face looked like she had seen her worst nightmare.</p>

  <p>While the others were stunned, Luo Luo Zheng remained calm and composed. He quietly stood on the side, rubbing his nose as he observed everyone's action and anticipated the turn of events.</p>

  <p>Malachi nonchalantly strode towards Hailey. He examined her with his malicious eyes, licking his upper lip like a mad dog. Then, to everyone's surprise, he reached out his hand to her chest.</p>

  <p>Demon Night females were naturally attractive and had alluring figure.</p>

  <p>And so, with Hailey's tight and fitted leather armor, these features were highlighted even more.</p>

  <p>Everyone could not believe what Malachi was doing to Hailey. He was casually teasing her bosom with his hands like a child playing with a toy.</p>

  <p>Hailey was disgusted with what Malachi was doing to her, but she couldn't resist. Her fear overpowered her disgust.</p>

  <p>"I can't believe it. It's been months since I last saw you! But those breasts haven't grown. You disappointed me. You know that, don't you?"</p>

  <p>Malachi said as he shook his head. He lifted Hailey's chin and saw the killing intent glimmering in her eyes, but he didn't even bother. He continued, "Now, what's with that look, my sweet Hailey! I thought you loved it when I play with your body like this? Don't you remember the feeling of us enjoying in each other's arms? You don't need to pretend in front of your friends, do you?"</p>

  <p>"Asshole!"</p>

  <p>Hailey shouted. She finally had gathered the courage to resist Malachi's harassment.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng and the others knew the introverted and short-spoken Hailey.</p>

  <p>Although they had fought side by side with her in the Hall of Causality, they had little knowledge of where she came from. They didn't even bother asking because they respected her decision to keep that side of her to herself.</p>

  <p>But today, they had finally discovered something about her background.</p>

  <p>They figured that Malachi had something on her, otherwise, she wouldn't have tolerated his outrageous behavior.</p>

  <p>But that part was still unknown to them. Would they ever find out? No one knew for sure?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng wasn't interested in knowing such things. He already considered Hailey as a friend because she was once there to cooperate and help him.</p>

  <p>Now, in her time of need, it was only fitting that he returned the favor.</p>

  <p>He was about to move when suddenly, to his surprise, Jeffrey and Janet moved to Hailey's side. Even Coleman and Ansel, who were the timidest among the group, came to Hailey's rescue.</p>

  <p>Malachi noticed the warriors that formed behind Hailey. He indifferently swept his gaze over each one. His disdainful eyes looked at them as if he could see through their souls. He looked at Hailey once again, locked his eyes with hers trying to intimidate, then his eyes moved to her chest once more. "So," he continued as he glanced sideways to Hailey. "They're your companions who passed through the Hall of Causality with you, aren't they?"</p>
