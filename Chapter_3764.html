  <p>"You can go to Stage Thirty-one of the Other Shore through the star rings in the ice castle, but the star rings have been provided for the creatures from the chaos. I don't know if you can pass through one," Zheng said to the bald giant.</p>

  <p>Each star ring corresponded to a race. Only members of a race could ascend from their star ring.</p>

  <p>It was unlikely that the Colossus race had an exclusive star ring. The members of the Element Spirit race had probably used some other means to bring the bald giant to where he was at the moment.</p>

  <p>In addition to this, the bald giant was also facing another problem. He had become the ruler of the Blooming Jade Stage. According to the rules of the Other Shore, once he became a stage ruler, he would forever be bound to this stage of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge and Zheng had become stage rulers in succession, but they had not become bound to their respective stages of the Other Shore. This confused Zheng, who wondered if the bald giant would be accorded such treatment.</p>

  <p>The bald giant nodded and took a step forward. He lifted the roof of the ice castle into the air, revealing the star rings neatly placed within.</p>

  <p>He grabbed at the star rings, spilling them all over the ice.</p>

  <p>"These things are so small. How can I get into them?" the bald giant said, frowning.</p>

  <p>"Just step into a star ring," said Zheng.</p>

  <p>The star ring was similar to a transmission door. No matter how large an individual was, a star ring could accommodate them.</p>

  <p>Even the star rings for races with huge figures, such as the Abyss Spirit race, were about the same size as that for humans.</p>

  <p>The bald giant stared at a star ring before taking a deep breath and then stepping forward into it.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>The star ring sucked him in with a whoosh, emitting white light as it did.</p>

  <p>"He seems to be going through the star ring for the Ear Mouse race. Is it possible?" Libby asked, worried.</p>

  <p>Zheng shrugged and said, "I don't know. He has to try it himself."</p>

  <p>Zheng had communicated a lot with the bald giant on their way here.</p>

  <p>He had established a certain friendship with the giant after multiple rounds of battle. They had more to talk about with each other now and the Primeval Lord of Heaven also took the opportunity to tell Zheng to ask him some questions.</p>

  <p>The bald giant was called Pompeo, a name that had a far more complicated pronunciation than it looked.</p>

  <p>To the disappointment of the Primeval Lord of Heaven, the Colossus race seemed to be a primitive race. Pompeo could read a few Sanskrit words, but he didn't know a lot about the Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>He only knew that the Colossus race controlled ten mountains, each of which was vast and boundless. He lived at the top of one of the mountains all year round and fell to the Other Shore when he went hunting one day.</p>

  <p>He had no idea about the other races and their geography and culture in the Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>He had a vast knowledge about hunting skills and all kinds of beasts in the mountain. Zheng had seen these beasts, which were the monsters that were also imprisoned in the Cold Prisons.</p>

  <p>At these answers, Zheng and the Primeval Lord of Heaven looked disappointed.</p>

  <p>At this point, they only knew that the area outside Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore was mountainous and that was where Pompeo's clansmen lived. They knew nothing else.</p>

  <p>But when Zheng began to inquire about the colorful Starry Roc-fish, Pompeo looked at him with a newfound respect. He told Zheng that the Starry Roc-fish was a sacred beast of the Colossus race. Whenever the sacred beast appeared, no matter what the clansmen were doing, the priest of the Colossus race would lead all of them to kneel down before it.</p>

  <p>This sacred beast had, however, never descended. It only floated back and forth in the sky.</p>

  <p>It was easy for a primitive race to form a faith. According to the Primeval Lord of Heaven's judgment, the members of the Colossus race might not have any inner connection with the Starry Roc-fish. But for some reason, the Starry Roc-fish had been circling in the sky of the Three Purities Stage and flying over the ten mountains. This had resulted in the members of the Colossus race taking it as their faith.</p>

  <p>This was all that Zheng had heard from Pompeo.</p>

  <p>The star ring for the Ear Mouse race suddenly began to tremble violently, and it spat out a ray of white light.</p>

  <p>Pompeo's body came flying out of the star ring and smashed into the surface of the ice not far from them, tumbling in several circles before he came to a stop and got to his feet.</p>

  <p>"He failed!"</p>

  <p>Libby's and Elizabeth's eyes flashed.</p>

  <p>They had both anticipated this result. It would have been incredible if he had ascended from the star ring for the Ear Mouse race.</p>

  <p>"I couldn't ascend," said Pompeo, touching his bald head.</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled and said, "Try another star ring."</p>

  <p>Taking Zheng's advice, Pompeo stepped into another star ring.</p>

  <p>It wasn't long before he was thrown out again.</p>

  <p>It was not until he had tried several star rings in succession and failed every single time that Zheng sighed and said, "It looks like we'll have to use some other means to send you up."</p>

  <p>"What other means?"</p>

  <p>Pompeo asked helplessly. He had always wanted to return to his race and was unwilling to stay on the Other Shore any longer.</p>

  <p>"We'll have to find some means from the Element Spirit race," said Zheng.</p>

  <p>"I can't go to the Three Purities Stage!" said Pompeo anxiously.</p>

  <p>"But I can. I will help you find a way to step into the Three Purities Stage,"</p>

  <p>Zheng said.</p>

  <p>Pompeo looked grateful at this. "What can I do?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Help us control the Blooming Jade Stage and suppress the Element Spirit race," Zheng said.</p>

  <p>Because of Pompeo's actions, the Element Spirit race had chosen to temporarily retreat. Except for the Five-Element Slaves that Pompeo had killed, the remaining members of the Element Spirit race had all retreated to Stage Thirty-one of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Although all the ice castles in the Blooming Jade Stage had been swept away, there was no doubt that the Element Spirit race would make a comeback once Pompeo left.</p>

  <p>But if Pompeo were to stay here, he would be able to help the humans gradually take control of the Blooming Jade Stage.</p>

  <p>Zheng had come up with this idea before, but he wouldn't keep Pompeo here if he could ascend.</p>

  <p>Now that Pompeo couldn't leave by himself, Zheng had to make good use of this situation. In return, he would help him find a way to ascend to the upper stages.</p>

  <p>Pompeo blinked his huge eyes and nodded, agreeing with Zheng's suggestion.</p>

  <p>The Colossus race was a primitive race, but Pompeo was not stupid. He knew that Zheng would not help him for no reason. He himself had helped Zheng because they had the same enemy and they could make use of each other.</p>

  <p>"Elizabeth, would you like to stay in the Blooming Jade Stage to assist Pompeo?" Zheng turned to ask Elizabeth.</p>

  <p>By asking Elizabeth to assist Pompeo, he intended for Elizabeth to take charge instead since Pompeo would be fighting most of the time.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth didn't refuse, but she was hesitant as she said, "But I can't communicate with him."</p>

  <p>Now, the only person who could communicate with Pompeo was Zheng.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter. I'll talk to him about everything in advance. He'll follow your orders," Zheng said.</p>

  <p>Pompeo needed to kill all the members of the Element Spirit race who entered the Blooming Jade Stage, or anyone that Elizabeth considered a threat. She only needed to give simple orders for him to do her bidding.</p>
