<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The presence of Harold guaranteed the safety of Yan, who had been receiving much training over the past few years.</p>

  <p>Although this kind of training was nowhere near the battles of life and death, it was still necessary to train Yan and make her a formidable warrior.</p>

  <p>Facing the Giant Thunder Rhinoceros, when most of the top-rank True Gods chose to run away, Yan was able to deal with it calmly because of her many years in training.</p>

  <p>Zheng stood behind his sister without ever moving.</p>

  <p>Since Yan was so confident, he knew he had no power to stop her anyway.</p>

  <p>But he always made sure to keep an eye on the situation. If he found anything wrong, he would save her without hesitation.</p>

  <p>As the Giant Thunder Rhinoceros inched closer and closer, Yan and her avatar suddenly separated from each other, and they stood at either side, ready to fight.</p>

  <p>Because of this, the Giant Thunder Rhinoceros began to charge toward Zheng instead.</p>

  <p>"Huh? Yan? What is going on?"</p>

  <p>Looking at the angry Giant Thunder Rhinoceros, Zheng was stunned to see it coming after him. He thought Yan was deliberately asking him to deal with it.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>As Yan and her avatar moved to either side, her avatar suddenly waved its sword towards the giant horn of the Giant Thunder Rhinoceros.</p>

  <p>"How dare her avatar attack the Giant Thunder Rhinoceros's horn!"</p>

  <p>"What a fool! She's trying to die, right?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I have never seen anyone attack the Giant Thunder Rhinoceros's horn."</p>

  <p>The most solid part of the Giant Thunder Rhinoceros was its horn.</p>

  <p>The thunder rings on the horn were powerful, and the horn itself was extremely strong. Actually, it was considered a top-grade material for weapon refining in the Everest Spirit Mountain.</p>

  <p>However, no one ever wanted to harvest the horn because it drove the creature mad. No one wanted to deal with a mad Giant Thunder Rhinoceros.</p>

  <p>So even the consummate True Gods would avoid the horn when they faced the Giant Thunder Rhinoceros. But for some reason, Yan had enough confidence and motivation to attack the horn deliberately.</p>

  <p>Clang!</p>

  <p>After a ringing sound, the Giant Thunder Rhinoceros stopped in its tracks and its eyes flushed with redness. It roared and rushed towards Yan's avatar desperately.</p>

  <p>The avatar of Yan was on the right, while Yan herself was on the left.</p>

  <p>As the Giant Thunder Rhinoceros twisted its neck and dashed towards the avatar, Yan kicked the ground lightly and gently lifted off the ground, floating into the air.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Within the next moment, she stood securely on the creature's neck.</p>

  <p>Seeing Yan's bold action, many True Gods were stunned. Was she really confident enough to do this?</p>

  <p>They had never seen anyone who dared approach a Giant Thunder Rhinoceros this way. Everyone was always too afraid.</p>

  <p>In history, the most common way to deal with the Giant Thunder Rhinoceros was to let a True God with unusually fast speed lead the Giant Thunder Rhinoceros, and then a group of True Gods would come and attack the Giant Thunder Rhinoceros together.</p>

  <p>Being approached by the Giant Thunder Rhinoceros just meant a death sentence.</p>

  <p>Instead of dodging the creature, Yan placed herself on top of the Giant Thunder Rhinoceros. To others, it looked like she just wanted to die.</p>

  <p>Roar! Roar! Roar!</p>

  <p>The Giant Thunder Rhinoceros shook its head crazily, trying to get the girl off its back so it could devour her.</p>

  <p>However, the Giant Thunder Rhinoceros's neck was short and thick. No matter how hard it resisted, it was unable to attack Yan.</p>

  <p>The True Gods were terrified by this scene, hoping for Yan to just retreat and save herself.</p>

  <p>Zheng was also very nervous as he watched his sister. Although he believed Yan had the ability to subdue the beast, he was still very worried when seeing her climb up the beast's neck.</p>

  <p>The Giant Thunder Rhinoceros wriggled continuously, but failed to throw Yan off its back. Just then, the thunder rings on its horn began to flash rays of light.</p>

  <p>Sizzle! Sizzle! Sizzle!</p>

  <p>It began to emit a rare purple thunder from every pore of its body.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>Just before the purple thunder bloomed, the necklace hanging on Yan's chest began to flicker.</p>

  <p>Just then, all of the purple thunder that the creature excreted was absorbed by the necklace.</p>

  <p>Her necklace was able to absorb all lightning and thunder energy from the rhinoceros! This sort of precious treasure was extremely rare.</p>

  <p>"Is this some thunder arrester?"</p>

  <p>"It can absorb the thunder of the Giant Thunder Rhinoceros completely. Is this a supreme treasure of belief?!"</p>

  <p>"There's no way this can be an ordinary supreme primordial weapon!"</p>

  <p>"No wonder she could come so close to the Giant Thunder Rhinoceros."</p>

  <p>The once unimpressive necklace immediately drew everyone's attention.</p>

  <p>Then, Yan circled around the Giant Thunder Rhinoceros's neck, with a purple light flashing vigorously in her hand.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," she whispered, her eyes revealing a trace of sadness and pity.</p>

  <p>Even though she received training in the Everest Spirit Mountain, Yan rarely killed the creatures there. Through the ability given to her by Harold, she even communicated with the ferocious beasts and treated them as her own friends.</p>

  <p>Everyone else feared the Giant Thunder Rhinoceros, but deep inside, she felt sorry for it. She didn't have the heart to hurt it.</p>

  <p>A word came out of her mouth.</p>

  <p>"Strengthen!"</p>

  <p>As the purple light condensed, it gradually formed into a purple thorn.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>She stabbed the thorn into the bottom of the ear of the Giant Thunder Rhinoceros.</p>

  <p>Just as the thorn was inside the creature halfway through, a dazzling lightning burst out from the Giant Thunder Rhinoceros.</p>

  <p id="top_7">Boom!</p>

  <p>The lightning instantly engulfed not only the Giant Thunder Rhinoceros, but Yan as well.</p>

  <p>"Yan!"</p>

  <p>Zheng took two steps forward.</p>

  <p>As the lightning continued to surge outward, even he was unable to charge in. All he could do was wait.</p>

  <p>The lightning lasted for about twenty seconds before it stopped completely.</p>

  <p>When Zheng saw it clearly, he let out a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>The furious Giant Thunder Rhinoceros dropped to the ground, lifeless.</p>

  <p>There was a small hole in the bottom of its ear, and the bloodstains around it had been dried up by the lightning.</p>

  <p>Yan stood on the Giant Thunder Rhinoceros, looking helpless.</p>

  <p>"She is so powerful."</p>

  <p>"It only took her a few seconds to kill the Giant Thunder Rhinoceros. Even a consummate True God wouldn't have been able to do that."</p>

  <p>"Four years ago, I entered the Everest Spirit Mountain with three consummate True Gods of my clan. We attempted to get the Giant Thunder Rhinoceros's horn, and it took us nearly an hour to kill it!"</p>

  <p>Although many True Gods knew Yan to be an extraordinary girl, they felt that she had learned some special abilities and she wasn't strong without them.</p>

  <p>Only now did they realize that this girl was not as simple as they imagined.</p>

  <p>After a few moments, Yan floated gently and landed in front of Zheng. There was purple lightning constantly flowing back and forth in the necklace around her neck, as if the lightning that erupted from the Giant Thunder Rhinoceros had been absorbed by the necklace around her.</p>

  <p>"Yan, you are so powerful. You killed it so easily," Zheng exclaimed. Now he was convinced by the strength of his sister.</p>

  <p>"Actually, I didn't kill it," Yan said calmly. "I just pierced the thunder container in the middle of its neck, letting it kill itself by explosion. If Harold didn't give me the necklace, I probably wouldn't have been able to do that at all."</p>

  <p>The lightning power of the Giant Thunder Rhinoceros was extremely powerful. If it burst out, people standing near it wouldn't have stood a chance.</p>

  <p>However, that necklace was indeed a supreme treasure of belief from the Everest Spirit Mountain— the Sky and Thunder Breaking Necklace.</p>

  <p>Although it was only a first-grade treasure, it had very strong powers to absorb thunder. Apart from a few particular types of lightning in the divine land, all the other lightning could be all absorbed by it in an instant.</p>

  <p>In addition to the necklace, Yan also knew well about the habits and weaknesses of the Giant Thunder Rhinoceros because of her previous training experience. All these things considered, that was why Yan made it seem so easy to kill the creature.</p>
