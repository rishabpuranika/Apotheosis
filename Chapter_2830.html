<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Dark Light World Transformation was powerful.</p>

  <p>But since it was harmful to one's soul, only a few people in the Source World would choose to practice this technique.</p>

  <p>The first and second levels of this technique were still acceptable, since they only caused limited damage to the souls which could be healed after years of rest.</p>

  <p>But its third level, namely the Furnace of Dark and Light, was regarded as a taboo method.</p>

  <p>Using this method at the expense of one's own soul, they could use the Truth of Dark and Light Chaos that they had comprehended all at once.</p>

  <p>In the Source World, it was a method used to refine weapons, and not a method to destroy your enemies.</p>

  <p>In order to create peerless weapons, disciples were specially trained by some great forces on using the Truth of Dark and Light Chaos. Finally, they forced and tempted them to use the Furnace of Dark and Light.</p>

  <p>Some powerful forces had once ordered over a hundred consummate True Gods to use the Furnace of Dark and Light in order to refine some tough materials, which then cost their own lives.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>As the eight-diagram disc rotated, the entire space began rotating along with it.</p>

  <p>"It forces me to go along with it!" a consummate True God exclaimed, staring at the eight-diagram disc in a daze.</p>

  <p>"Does Holy Nicholas intend to refine us too?" a Demi-holy Being with a long face queried.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he wants to sacrifice us all! This is unfair!" Hearing this, terror appeared in Rachelle's eyes.</p>

  <p>No one knew what price Nicholas would have to pay or whether he could be reborn since he employed this technique. Either way, she knew she was doomed to die, anyway.</p>

  <p>Everyone within this space was pulled into the vortex without a choice.</p>

  <p>At the center of the vortex was Nicholas.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Noticing how unfavorable the situation was for them, Luo Zheng and Tianming both thrust their swords at Nicholas.</p>

  <p>However, it seemed too late. As soon as their swords penetrated through Nicholas' body, they collided with each other, making a clanging sound. At the same time, Nicholas' flesh seemed to have turned into nothingness.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and Tianming both felt a strong pull, dragging them into Nicholas' body.</p>

  <p>Tianming tried to pull out the Soaring Snake Sword with all his might, but to his surprise, it didn't move at all.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Tianming was about to be sucked into Nicholas' body, Luo Zheng gritted his teeth, bursting out the power in his body and slamming the Shadow Bearing Sword into Tianming's sword!</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>With his full strength, the Soaring Snake Sword was knocked out from Nicholas' body, while the Shadow Bearing Sword was snapped in half.</p>

  <p>Even though Harper highly valued the Shadow Bearing Sword as a good weapon, it was not as solid as the Soaring Snake Sword. With Luo Zheng's great strength, it broke apart inside Nicholas' body. It was a pity that Luo Zheng still hadn't fully grasped the weapon yet.</p>

  <p>There was no time to hesitate due to this urgent circumstance. Luo Zheng immediately abandoned the sword and fled backward together with Tianming, trying to resist the strong pull and escape.</p>

  <p>Standing steady in the center, Nicholas flashed a crazy smile as he watched them struggling. He didn't attempt to catch them. Instead, he let out a hysterical laugh and said, "Just run, run! Where the hell can you run to?"</p>

  <p>In Nicholas' opinion, there was no way these two could escape anyway. No matter how far they fled, they would eventually be pulled into the vortex.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Everyone in the void was spinning around with Nicholas as the center. The spinning speed was getting faster as time went on, trapping everyone in an invisible vortex.</p>

  <p>"Run towards the edge!"</p>

  <p>Aware that she couldn't just wait for death, Rachelle called out to the remaining people to try to escape.</p>

  <p>The pull was still not difficult to resist. The moment they realized what they were supposed to do, everyone flew towards the edge of the vortex.</p>

  <p>At first, they could still move swiftly.</p>

  <p>However, after covering a certain distance, they started to feel the pull increasing.</p>

  <p>"The pull is getting stronger!"</p>

  <p>"I, I can't move anymore. What the hell is going on?"</p>

  <p>One of the Demi-holy Beings was originally very far away from Nicholas.</p>

  <p>However, after he rushed over a hundred miles, he started to feel the space around him becoming impenetrable. Exerting his full strength with the hope to escape, he was surprised that he couldn't move another inch.</p>

  <p>Soon, they realized that there was an invisible barrier at the edge of the huge vortex.</p>

  <p>It didn't matter what method they tried to use. It was just impossible for them to break this invisible barrier.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, let's go!"</p>

  <p>Seeing this, the woman ordered Samuel's clone to create a space channel. It was enough to cover Luo Zheng and Tianming at the same time. In a blink of an eye, they both reappeared by her side, and Sword Chen approached them as well.</p>

  <p>As Samuel's clone brandished the Spear of Supreme Harmony, he set up a new space channel, connecting it to the outside of the vortex. The five of them then entered the space channel simultaneously.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Samuel stared at Nicholas, a sullen look appearing in his eyes.</p>

  <p>He was hoping that Nicholas and Luo Zheng would fight to death. However, Nicholas had let him down, leaving him no chance to hurt Luo Zheng at all.</p>

  <p>Knowing that Nicholas would probably pay a huge price after he employed such a method, he doubted if Nicholas could even be reborn in his universe.</p>

  <p>It seemed that this would be the end for this sworn enemy after all.</p>

  <p>Still, Samuel didn't feel satisfied with the results.</p>

  <p>Since this was his second chance to be a Holy Being, he believed that he should be the ruler of the divine land. He could not reconcile to let Luo Zheng and Tianming get the True Demon Body. However, he had no confidence to fight them, seeing that even Nicholas was no match for them. It seemed that he would have to wait for an opportunity.</p>

  <p>Keeping this in mind, he brandished the Spear of Supreme Harmony unhurriedly and prepared to leave through the space channel.</p>

  <p>"Samuel, can you please take me with you? I will absolutely express my gratitude after we return to the Floating Islands," a long-haired warrior begged Samuel.</p>

  <p>He was a Demi-holy Being from the Bai Clan.</p>

  <p>Seeing that everyone was trapped in this vortex, he knew that his strength wouldn't be enough to escape on his own. After witnessing how the woman took Luo Zheng and the others away, he decided to ask Samuel's help to leave together in the same way.</p>

  <p>Samuel only snorted in reply. Technically, there was no reason why he needed to help this guy. As the internal momentum of the Space Divine Dao emitted from his body, he immediately disappeared on the spot.</p>

  <p>Moving along the space channel, he suddenly bumped into an invisible wall. With a muffled grunt, he stumbled out from the space channel.</p>

  <p>The expression on his face changed dramatically as he looked around once.</p>

  <p>Apparently, he failed to leave through the space channel. He was still inside the vortex!</p>

  <p>Standing on the other side, the woman, Luo Zheng, Tianming and Sword Chen all had a terrible look on their faces.</p>

  <p>"We can't escape through the space channel," the woman concluded with a frown.</p>

  <p>Looking back at Nicholas from a distance, Sword Chen took a deep breath.</p>

  <p>"Are we really going to die here today?" he asked, sighing helplessly.</p>

  <p></p>
