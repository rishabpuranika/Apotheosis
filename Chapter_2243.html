<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Sensing Liusu's affection, Zheng's heart skipped a beat.</p>

  <p>For him, the trip to the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land was mainly for training purpose. He didn't expect to leave such a long-lasting impression on this woman.</p>

  <p>But keeping in mind what lay ahead, he kept his thoughts to himself.</p>

  <p>Zheng never ever wanted to rely on a woman to help him.</p>

  <p>Ever since he started to cultivate martial arts, he never expected anyone to help him. However, he always remembered those who did help him, assuring them that he had their back at the time of need.</p>

  <p>Later, he found out that his father had been decorating his life secretly, helping him to improve. Zheng was once very depressed, which however was due to his own nature.</p>

  <p>A solemn expression crept upon Langston's face as he walked around the flame.</p>

  <p>He had already heard of this blue preternatural fire, so he found it wise not to touch it.</p>

  <p>But that didn't mean that he couldn't deal with the flame.</p>

  <p>If this woman took that guy in with the blue preternatural fire, it would probably be a great shame for him if this thing spread out. He didn't expect Liusu to behave like this as she didn't even think of his clan's reputation.</p>

  <p>If the guy had been burned to ashes, it would have been quite logical for Liusu to remove the flame. But why did she keep the flame burning?</p>

  <p>The spectators nervously glanced at each other, with a puzzled expression on their faces.</p>

  <p>Langston had had enough. He stretched out his hands and clapped, a series of sharp claw prints spread out from his hands.</p>

  <p>These claw prints rose up in the air and circled Langston. These claw prints would cut anyone who tried to approach Langston.</p>

  <p>The air was filled with sound of the spinning claw prints.</p>

  <p>The claw prints spun faster and faster. They also shrank simultaneously beside his body. All the claw prints turned into many small spirals and gathered on his hands. It looked as if a small top was spinning swiftly on his hands.</p>

  <p>Then he raised his hand and gave it a wave. As a result, the spinning top whooshed over and barged into the flame arranged by Liusu.</p>

  <p>There was a splashing sound as the spinning top collided with the preternatural fire.</p>

  <p>Liusu's preternatural fire could devour everything. However, the spiral made from the claw prints made of momentum was actually a mass of high-speed spinning energy. Once the energy entered the flames, a gust was generated, swaying the flames sideways and a pathway appeared.</p>

  <p>The flames were easily extinguished by the strong gust of air that Langston produced.</p>

  <p>Langston's heart was full of hatred when he saw Liusu holding Zheng so close to her.</p>

  <p>Aleyna and Kelsey were also in awe.</p>

  <p>"Tianxing Luo is not afraid of Liusu's preternatural fire!" Kelsey exclaimed hastily.</p>

  <p>With a twinkle in her eyes, Aleyna stammered, "Liusu, Liusu knew that! This man is, he is..."</p>

  <p>"Who is he?" Kelsey asked, her voice filled with anticipation.</p>

  <p>Much to her disappointment, Aleyna just shook her head and remained quiet.</p>

  <p>Aleyna was quite astonished when she saw Liusu wrap herself and Zheng with the preternatural fire. She thought that this might kill Tianxing.</p>

  <p>Since Tianxing emerged unscathed from the preternatural fire, she immediately understood that Tianxing was actually Zheng.</p>

  <p>She remembered that Aleyna once told her that Zheng was the only person who was not afraid of her preternatural fire.</p>

  <p>However, Aleyna didn't believe her then. She thought that Zheng must have a body protection treasure or a unique cultivation method.</p>

  <p>Liusu's claimed that Zheng had a special body and was immune to most flames.</p>

  <p>She thought that since Liusu used her fire, she already knew that Tianxing was actually Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Interesting! You both are a perfect couple." Langston stated calmly.</p>

  <p>There was a whooshing sound as Langston took off.</p>

  <p>He rushed into the fire sea along the road created by the spiral.</p>

  <p>It was quite dangerous for Langston to break in. But he was a martial artist, and his cultivation base was at a level higher than that of Liusu.</p>

  <p>He intended to kill Zheng regardless of the fact that he was endangering himself by going into the fire.</p>

  <p>He also felt this sudden urge to kill Liusu as well.</p>

  <p>The sole reason of Langston's visit to the Floating Island of the Han Clan was to see Liusu. It was very common for the playboys of the wealthy clans to play a trick or two on Aleyna and Kelsey, but he didn't quite expect Zheng to cause any hindrance.</p>

  <p>Langston made up his mind to kill Zheng nonetheless. He didn't realize that this might not be an easy task, since Sheridan was just killed by Zheng.</p>

  <p>Langston had looked down upon Zheng at the very beginning.</p>

  <p>In most cases, the direct disciples of the wealthy clans regarded very lowly of the disciples of the sub-branches. The strength of the sub-branches' disciples of the wealthy clans was less as compared to that of the direct disciples of the wealthy clans. Although the ordinary sub-branches' disciples wouldn't offend the direct disciples of the wealthy clans, Zheng was no ordinary disciple.</p>

  <p>Liusu was aware of the path that had formed between the flames.</p>

  <p>With a gentle flick of her slender fingers, wisps of blue flames made their way towards Langston.</p>

  <p>It was indeed difficult for a low-rank True God to deal with the flames.</p>

  <p>Countless talents in the Arena of Legends were burnt down by this move of Liusu, but as the fifth-ranked mid-rank True God, Langston knew how to deal with the flames.</p>

  <p>He started waving his hands, giving rise to strong gusts of wind.</p>

  <p>"Dancing wind..." he murmured.</p>

  <p>The spectators were astonished as the mass of wind followed Langston wherever he moved.</p>

  <p>Although Liusu's flames were burning wildly, they couldn't get close to Langston. His face was full of contempt and hatred. He threw a wild look at Liusu as he made his way slowly towards Zheng. "This man lets a woman protect him, and the woman isn't even his own. I have never met such a shameless man before! You must suffer the consequences of acquiring someone else's help. Burn in hell!" Langston raged.</p>

  <p id="top_20">He raised his arm just as he finished speaking. A sharp bright light emerged from between his fingers as he prepared to direct the light towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>With a swift motion, Laguisha got in between Langston and Zheng. She transformed the flame into a snake which shot towards Langston.</p>

  <p>The snake was no threat to Langston. He chuckled as he brushed away the snake with a flick of his hand. Langston suddenly took off and appeared in front of Liusu, much to her dismay.</p>

  <p>"You haven't married into my clan yet, but still you'd be punished according to my clan's rules. Then you'd come to know what the principles of a wife are!" Langston roared.</p>

  <p>Clap!</p>

  <p>Langston slapped Liusu just as he finished talking.</p>

  <p>Liusu did not see the slap coming as she was thrown sideways by its force.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't know how to react. He glared at Langston without saying much. He was too badly wounded to react.</p>

  <p>Master Evil in his mind said, "You young people are way too impulsive."</p>

  <p>Master Evil naturally didn't want him to provoke the playboys of these wealthy clans. And it was a wise decision not to react given his current strength and status. Yet Zheng knew he had to do something. However, he was only a soul that was living in Zheng's mind after all. How could he influence Zheng's decision?</p>

  <p>"You disgusting animal!" Langston looked down at Zheng and weird claw-like prints slowly popped out from his fingers, making their way towards Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>Aleyna and Kelsey watched in horror, their fists clenched. Not knowing what to do.</p>

  <p>Just as the claw prints were about to hit Zheng, the door of the hall was suddenly pushed wide open and a powerful aura rushed in followed by a man who hastily made his way towards Langston.</p>

  <p>There was a loud bang.</p>

  <p>Langston was pushed back by the loud blast and the deafening voice of the man could be heard all over the place, "I just went to the forbidden land for a while, and you all acted wildly in my territory. Do you think the Han Clan is weak?!"</p>

  <p>At the sight of the man, Aleyna heaved a sigh of relief and cheered,</p>

  <p>"Brother! You finally came back!"</p>
