<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>That year, Luo Luo Zheng had left without saying goodbye. Ever since Mist's celestial tomb had been opened, many top warriors of different sects had entered and obtained many golden opportunities, but many had also died.</p>

  <p>The sects in the Central Region had also undergone earth-shattering changes.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had been the first one to pass through the Wheel of Fortune in the tomb. But when the other warriors returned to their sects, they found that Luo Luo Zheng was missing.</p>

  <p>No one knew whether he was alive or dead. The members of the Cloud Hall remained mum about Luo Zheng's whereabouts, keeping the outside world guessing. Because of this, a vast majority of warriors believed Luo Luo Zheng to be dead.</p>

  <p>Many warriors had relied on the enchanted lamps to enter the celestial tomb. Whatever had happened in the tomb could not be kept secret, and news of those unfathomable, terrifying things had reached far and wide.</p>

  <p>This meant that even Luo Zheng's death wasn't something that was hard to accept. After all, even the elders at the Virtual Tribulation Realm were bound to die. And Luo Luo Zheng had only reached the Illuminating Soul Realm at the time.</p>

  <p>"Why is there a rumor that I'm dead?" Luo Luo Zheng said with a wry smile. He really shouldn't have left without saying goodbye. "Forget it. I want to see your leader."</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter whether you are  Luo Luo Zheng Luo or not. You're not a member of our sect, so you'd better leave," a different elder of the Virtual Tribulation Realm said, not interested in the identity of the man before him. Right now, the situation in the Central Region was so unpredictable that it demanded caution at every step from every member.</p>

  <p>Bess said, "Elder Yu, Luo Luo Zheng just saved our lives!"</p>

  <p>"Bess, shut up! You three, come over here!" Elder Yu berated Bess. He then turned to Luo Luo Zheng and said coldly, "Friend, the region is in chaos. If you don't leave now, don't blame me for being impolite."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had come to the Fish Dragon Sect for one thing - for information about the Central Region. But he hadn't expected the elders of the Virtual Tribulation Realm to be so rude. His face darkened and he said coldly,</p>

  <p>"Your disciples tried to take my life while I was recuperating. I think I want to settle this debt with you."</p>

  <p>"Don't cast wild aspersions on my disciples. They wouldn't do that!"</p>

  <p>Elder Yu retorted.</p>

  <p>"Elder Yu..." Bess started, wanting to say something. But the moment she opened her mouth, Elder Yu snapped at her yet again. "Shut up!"</p>

  <p>"Humph! I'm sure you came here to make trouble. Don't be so arrogant.</p>

  <p>The Fish Dragon Sect is a third-grade sect. You are only a warrior at the primary level of the Virtual Tribulation Realm. I wonder what gave you the confidence to do so!" another elder of the Virtual Tribulation Realm sneered.</p>

  <p>There were three elders at the primary level of the Virtual Tribulation Realm in the Fish Dragon Sect. Its leader had reached the middle level of the Virtual Tribulation Realm. In the eyes of these two elders, it was shocking that Luo Luo Zheng had stepped into the Virtual Tribulation Realm at such a young age. But whatever it was, he was only at the primary level. How could he fight against four warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm all by himself?</p>

  <p>"Friend, please leave now." As he said these words, Elder Yu began to direct the dark green life vitality within his body. He was cultivating a poisoning martial art that was difficult to deal with, even if it wasn't as powerful as the Scripture of Five Poisons.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng glanced at Elder Yu. Although there was no killing intent in Luo Zheng's eyes, Elder Yu couldn't help but tremble for some reason. Luo Luo Zheng slowly said, "Make trouble? Fine. Since you believe that I came to make trouble, I'll satisfy you!"</p>

  <p>The moment he finished talking, his eyes flashed, a violent Mu Ning instantly emanating from him. The improvement in Luo Zheng's cultivation meant that his soul had become more and more stable and the power that his soul radiated had become even more terrifying.</p>

  <p>The two elders of the Virtual Tribulation Realm instantly felt like a huge mountain was pressing down on them. The pressure was so powerful that it made it difficult for them to breathe, making them feel like their heads were about to explode.</p>

  <p>Most of Luo Zheng's soul pressure was directed straight ahead, but a small portion of it was spreading in all directions. Bess and two other female disciples who were standing beside Luo Luo Zheng paled as they tried and failed to withstand it.</p>

  <p>They hadn't imagined that this young man, who looked so warm and gentle, would turn into someone so terrifying.</p>

  <p>Bess's face was white as paper. Although her face had turned fearful, her eyes were filled with excitement as she realized that Luo Luo Zheng really did deserve his reputation. He was able to overpower the two elders of the Fish Dragon Sect with his Mu Ning alone. He was young and possessed a strength that automatically made him attractive to any young girl.</p>

  <p>"Well, well. Friend. It looks like you really want to fight!" Elder Yu looked pale, but he wouldn't allow an outsider to show off his might in his sect and succeed. He endured Luo Zheng's pressure and directed all of his life vitality to attack him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng raised his eyebrows, and a moment later, Xun had emerged from his body. She whipped the spear in her hand like a lightning bolt, bringing its tip to rest at Elder Yu's neck. If it moved even a little, Elder Yu's head would fall to the ground.</p>

  <p>Xun's Mu Ning was like that of the queen of all beings. There wasn't the slightest trace of compassion in her incomparably beautiful red eyes.</p>

  <p>Elder Yu knew that if he dared to move a little bit, Xun would surely kill him.</p>

  <p>"Welcome,  Luo Luo Zheng Luo! Sorry I didn't come out to greet you. It is my fault."</p>

  <p>A loud voice rang out. A ray of light shot out from the Fish Dragon Sect and stopped in midair, hovering quietly. "What a rare visitor! What brings you here?"</p>

  <p>The members of the Fish Dragon Sect had suspected Luo Zheng's identity before, but his sword spirit erased any doubts they had about him. They had heard of Luo Zheng's legend and they knew the fact that his sword spirit was a beautiful foreign female. Very few swordsmen in the Central Region had sword spirits, and Luo Luo Zheng was the only one to have a stunning girl as one.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had originally only wanted to pay a visit to the sect's leader, Master Xiao, since Bess couldn't answer his questions. He needed to know what had happened in the Central Region before he went back to Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>He had not expected the two elders of the Fish Dragon Sect to be so stubborn and want to drive him away. Their disciples had tried to kill him. Since they were being unreasonable, he decided to teach them a lesson.</p>

  <p>"Master Xiao." There was no smile on Luo Zheng's face. "A while ago, as I was healing myself in the sea, I was ambushed by three Internal Elixir Realm warriors of your sect. I came here to demand an explanation from you," he said darkly.</p>

  <p>"Is that so?" Master Xiao's expression darkened as he turned to Elder Yu and asked, "How can there be such scum in our sect? Elder Yu, who are they?"</p>

  <p>Elder Yu shook his head. He had no idea either. Master Xiao's eyes flashed angrily. As he spotted Bess, he addressed her, his voice and demeanor stern, "Bess, why didn't you report such a grave matter?"</p>

  <p>Bess was shocked but she recovered enough to reply, apology written large on her face. "It was Elder Yu who didn't allow me to mention it. I tried to report it several times."</p>

  <p>Master Xiao glared at Elder Yu before smiling kindly at Bess and saying,</p>

  <p>"Tell me everything in detail."</p>

  <p>Master Xiao did not know the purpose of Luo Zheng's visit. But he wasn't the head of the Fish Dragon Sect for no reason. He was smart enough to surmise why Luo Luo Zheng was here. There were only a few dozen Internal Elixir Realm warriors in the sect, and a majority of them always remained at home. The independent warriors were obstinate and unruly, so it was possible for them to do such a thing. But if the Fish Dragon Sect hadn't done what Luo Luo Zheng claimed they had, Master Xiao would not stay quiet and allow Luo Luo Zheng to make slanderous charges against them. But if Luo Zheng's claims turned out to be true, it would be a completely different story altogether.</p>

  <p>Bess then recounted the incident when they had found Luo Luo Zheng at the bottom of the sea, moved him onto a reef, encountered Elder Hu and were ambushed by the independent warriors.</p>

  <p>Once Bess had finished talking, Master Xiao cast yet another glare at Elder Yu before addressing Luo Luo Zheng politely, "Luo Luo Zheng, it is indeed my sect's fault. I'm so sorry. Let's discuss the reason behind it in detail in my room."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was actually curious as well. Although the Fish Dragon Sect was only a third-grade sect, it had made a name for itself in the Central Region. The people he saw earlier had exuded a deep killing intent, unlike ordinary sect disciples.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng wouldn't refuse Master Xiao's invitation. Moreover, Luo Luo Zheng hadn't planned on bringing this up but he had to after the two elders of the Virtual Tribulation Realm had made things difficult for him.</p>
