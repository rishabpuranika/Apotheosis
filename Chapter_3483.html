<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It had only been a few years, but Luo Zheng had become one of the top disciples in the Taiyi Heaven Palace. He wasn't on Yan's level, but he was still pretty amazing.</p>

  <p>However, after the Chaotic Source World was closed, the stories that had happened inside this world spread like wildfire in the Source World, and the Li Shan mountain was the first to know.</p>

  <p>After Emily learned what Luo Zheng did in the Chaotic Source World, she was also flabbergasted.</p>

  <p>She could not completely understand what Luo Zheng had gone through to reach this level in a handful of years.</p>

  <p>Today, when Emily saw Luo Zheng again, he was already a Chaotic Source Realm warrior. However, she knew that Luo Zheng was more powerful than anybody that had returned from the Chaotic Source World claimed. He was far stronger than those Chaotic Source Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>"You have greatly improved your cultivation. Truly impressive. You can probably cow Sanjay of the Sky Guard Pavilion now. He surely wouldn't dare to fight you," Emily said, hands behind her back.</p>

  <p>Sanjay of the Sky Guard Pavilion had once chased them at the gate of the Source World, forcing Luo Zheng and Yan to split up to avoid him. Although Sanjay was a Chaotic Source Realm warrior in the Sky Guard Pavilion of the Bearing race, he wasn't even among the top 3, 000.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng could make the Green Jade World descend, and Sanjay was indeed no match for him at the moment.</p>

  <p>"If I meet him one day, I guess I'll have to thank him personally," Luo Zheng said with a smile. He had accidentally joined the Sword Light Palace before, and ended up becoming a disciple of the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>"I'd buy tickets to see that..." Emily uttered.</p>

  <p>With the Inheritance of World activated, Luo Zheng was still not as powerful as Phoenix or Qiu Yinhe, but he would be able to instantly kill many Chaotic Source Realm warriors. His strength was considerable.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng glanced at Emily, and said, "The Chaotic Source World has been permanently shut down. There's no way to reach the Chaotic Source Realm now. What are you going to do?"</p>

  <p>This was a very serious problem, not only for Emily, but also for many warriors of the Other Shore Realm all across the Source World.</p>

  <p>The Chaotic Source World would never be opened again. They would never have a chance to reach the Chaotic Source Realm. If they missed it last time, they would never get another chance, unless the Chaotic Source Spirits appeared in the Source World once more and multiplied there.</p>

  <p>Emily's eyes darkened when he asked the question.</p>

  <p>Not everyone on the Other Shore could master the various skills as rapidly as Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Many people had tried hard on the Other Shore. Only by training their Souls of Light little by little could they cross from stage to stage.</p>

  <p>Emily had been able to reach Stage Twelve only because she had brought Yan back and obtained several finger-size chunks of soul crystal. And even then, she was still not qualified to enter the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>"I have the soul crystal," Luo Zheng continued. "At least it's enough for you to enter the Desire World."</p>

  <p>If one didn't reach the Chaotic Source Realm, even if they made it to the Desire World, it would be difficult for them to fully employ the Other Shore Tokens' power. Just like in the middle ages, they could only choose the descending type of Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>When he made the offer, Emily immediately paid him rapt attention, her eyes wide.</p>

  <p>Those who had devoured the soul crystal knew what it could do. It could increase the level of the Soul of Light. But it was so rare and powerful that few ordinary warriors could own it.</p>

  <p>"I also have Chaotic Source Spirits," Luo Zheng said as he gently turned his hand.</p>

  <p>A handful of amber colored crystals were revealed to Emily, flickering slightly. There were 200 crystals in total.</p>

  <p>When Emily saw the crystals, her eyes were as big as saucers. A lot of talents had sacrificed their lives in the fight for the Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>"No one is allowed to bring the Chaotic Source Spirits out. How could you..." Emily whispered.</p>

  <p>She had a vague feeling that Luo Zheng would give these things to her, but she knew the soul crystal and the Chaotic Source Spirits were very precious. It was too much to comfortably accept.</p>

  <p>But the temptation was too strong. She had to have them.</p>

  <p>"Anyway, no one will care. I brought some with me," Luo Zheng said with a shrug.</p>

  <p>There were tens of thousands of crystals in the body of the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits. After Luo Zheng passed them out to the Taiyi Heaven Palace disciples and the members of the Li Shan mountain, he kept 2, 000 crystals for himself. These crystals were enough for ten people to reach the Chaotic Source Realm.</p>

  <p>Emily had proven herself a loyal companion when they traveled through the chaos. She deserved such a reward, and Luo Zheng thought this fitting.</p>

  <p>"Are you really... going to give these to me?" Emily's eyes shone with hope.</p>

  <p>She had heard that Luo Zheng had come to Li Shan mountain, so she came to see him, but she had never expected that he would show her the crystals.</p>

  <p>"I'll place the soul crystal in the care of the Ear Mouse race on Stage Thirteen. You can ask them for it after you reach that stage," Luo Zheng said as he handed the crystals of Chaotic Source Spirits to Emily.</p>

  <p>"This..." Emily didn't know what to say at all.</p>

  <p>Emily was once an invincible master in Luo Zheng's eyes, and she had a regal bearing.</p>

  <p>Perhaps it was because Luo Zheng had improved his cultivation base and had surpassed Emily that seeing Emily's uneasy expression, he found her kind of cute.</p>

  <p>In the end, Emily accepted the crystals of Chaotic Source Spirits, a wonderful gift that she would not refuse.</p>

  <p>Refining the Chaotic Source Spirits required the array in the Chaotic Source World. Now that the Icy Snow Province had been retaken by the Li Shan mountain, it shouldn't be difficult for Emily, the sect leader, to enter.</p>

  <p>The Li Shan mountain held a banquet to entertain the disciples from the Taiyi Heaven Palace, but Eastern Emperor Taiyi and the mountain leaders of the Taiyi Heaven Palace weren't there, so the Li Shan mountain only sent some sect leaders to accompany the members of the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>After exploring the Chaotic Source World, all the disciples from the Taiyi Heaven Palace were laid back, especially Chaim and Sally. Such exercise was relaxing to them, and kept them active and happy.</p>

  <p>After the banquet, a woman showed up. Her body was half-human and half-snake. She looked at Luo Zheng and announced, "Luo Zheng of the Taiyi Heaven Palace, the Snake Goddess demands to see you."</p>

  <p>Everyone looked at Luo Zheng. Some were in surprise, while some had more complex expressions.</p>

  <p>To the people of the Li Shan mountain, the Snake Goddess was not only a leader but also a spiritual symbol. She was the base of the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>There weren't many who had ever seen the Snake Goddess in person, even in the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>Qiu Yinhe nodded to Luo Zheng, and Luo Zheng stood and left the table. He followed the woman out of the room.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng had departed, the grand sect leader held a glass of wine and toasted Qiu Yinhe. "Yan's arrival has brought honor to our Li Shan mountain, but I didn't expect her brother, the disciple of the Taiyi Heaven Palace, to be just as amazing."</p>

  <p>Qiu Yinhe smiled and returned the toast. His grin was still there as he sipped from his glass.</p>

  <p>Initially, Qiu Yinhe had brought Luo Zheng back to the Taiyi Heaven Palace because Luo Zheng was a talent capable of Instant Enlightenment. But now, Luo Zheng was already the spokesperson of a civilization, which was truly beyond what Qiu Yinhe thought he could do. It had only been a handful of years, so such an achievement was rather spectacular.</p>

  <p>Maybe the Taiyi Heaven Palace should be grateful Luo Zheng joined them.</p>
