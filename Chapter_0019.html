<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 19 Evil Weapon Refiner (Part One) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Evil Lan was a weapon refiner in C County.</p>

  <p>In the Eastern Region, a popular profession was a weapon refiner. Most of the clans treated weapon refiners like exalted guests in the hopes that they would build many remarkable armaments for them.</p>

  <p>However, most of the clans in the Eastern Region loathed Evil Lan. They detested his techniques. Instead of wanting to roll out the red carpet, anyone who knew him yearned to eliminate him.</p>

  <p>There was a reason why so many people were eager to see Evil Lan dead.</p>

  <p>He used notably evil means to build his weapons. Evil Lan would pour blood from living people into his furnace while creating weaponry.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, he would even pull live people straight into his furnace like a sacrifice of some evil religion.</p>

  <p>Although several clans in the Eastern Region attempted to catch Evil Lan, they failed due to Evil Lan's vast power. He also happened to be as slippery as an eel.</p>

  <p>It was quite puzzling to the clan when Evil Lan showed up and grabbed Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Release him Evil Lan! This kid is a member of the Luo clan!" said Bryson.</p>

  <p>His guard was up because even though Bryson was just half of a step into the nature level, Evil Lan was a formidable adversary.</p>

  <p>Snickering Evil Lan asked,"Why would you be pointing your swords at him if he is a member of the Luo clan?" He added,"I want to handle this for you since you want to kill him so badly. Don't you think it would be a better solution?"</p>

  <p>"Damn it, Evil Lan! He is a member of my family and has rebelled against us, so, it should be me who deals with him! Anyone who dares provoke the Luo clan has a bad end. I advise you don't go against me!" Bryson threatened. Floating near Evil Lan and ready to strike were swords imbued with a purple aura.</p>

  <p>"If Mike Luo were here, I would hesitate. But, since it's only you... Ha-ha! I don't care about you! None of the Luo clan deserves my care!" countered Evil Lan while laughing loudly.</p>

  <p>"You weasel! That's complete bullshit! I'll kill you myself!" shouted Bryson. His face was darkening with anger, and with a clear sound, the purple swords shot forward, hurdling at Evil Lan.</p>

  <p>"That's rich! We'll see if you can kill me! Ha-ha-ha!" Evil Lan jumped back into the bronze furnace. His laughter echoed sharply, as the furnace rolled over forward into the crowd of the Luo children.</p>

  <p>Seeing the huge bronze furnace plunging at them, the Luo children scattered, screaming. Several were too slow to escape, and as the furnace struck fleeing children, they bled profusely, making it impossible to know whether or not they would survive.</p>

  <p>While chasing the large metal object, Bryson manipulated the flaming purple swords, hacking at the bronze furnace. Although the swords were eminently sharp, they couldn't even make one dent in the hull and made a series of clinking sounds against the metal target.</p>

  <p>As more and more children were run down, the massive furnace created significant mayhem in the yard. After a while, the bronze furnace turned in another direction and rolled out of sight.</p>

  <p>Watching the contraption roll away, Bryson clenched his teeth. He wanted to give chase, but Ken stopped him and said,"Brother, Evil Lan is dangerous, think of what he could do! Don't go after him."</p>

  <p>"And what about that rebel, Zheng?" asked Bryson flatly.</p>

  <p>Ken sneered,"That maniac, Evil Lan, is insane! When he takes someone, they end up burning to death in the bowels of his furnace, so, there is no chance of survival for Zheng!"</p>

  <p>Glancing around, Bryson nodded. He wasn't sure why, but he had a vague sense of apprehension. Looking at Ken, he snapped,"We need to treat the injured, dispatch my medicine unit!"</p>

  <p>In the yard, there were dozens of injured Luo children who had broken ribs and limbs crying in misery.</p>

  <p>Many uninjured ones looked on the scene, filled with discouragement.</p>

  <p>The ongoing feud between Zheng and his uncles, Bryson and Ken, was adding to the demise of the Luo clan.</p>

  <p>When Zheng's father, Mike, was still alive, evil guys such as Evil Lan never dared to cause trouble like today.</p>

  <p>Many other factors contributed to the downfall of the Luo clan.</p>

  <p>At one time, the Luo clan could boast that it was the top clan of C County, but, it had slipped so far that the tribe wasn't even in the top three.</p>

  <p>In the past, the Luo clan members could walk the streets, and no one dared provoke them.</p>

  <p>Now, they weren't respected or feared in town or at the compound and at times had even to bribe the Luo clan servants to get results.</p>

  <p>None of the Luo children felt the Luo clan would be able to rise above the situation they had fallen into.</p>

  <p>...</p>

  <p>...</p>

  <p>Squatting in the belly of the metal furnace, Zheng remained silent.</p>

  <p>Naturally, as the former young master of the clan, Zheng knew about Evil Lan. His father, Mike, had told him more than once that if he caught Evil Lan, he would slash Evil Lan in half with his cyan-blade sword.</p>

  <p>Zheng heard about many of the monstrous atrocities that Evil Lan committed, including that he performed human sacrifices to build his weaponry.</p>

  <p>After everything else that had happened to Zheng, he thought being taken hostage by Evil Lan, was the worst luck.</p>
