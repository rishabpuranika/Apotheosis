  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng stared coldly at the sword soul, and emotionally, he was in an absolutely calm state.</p>

  <p>The sword soul didn't give Zheng very much time. It only hovered in his mind for a few short seconds. Then, the sword blade rushed toward Zheng with the intent of killing him.</p>

  <p>"Come on!" Zheng roared.</p>

  <p>A light flashed in Zheng's cold eyes at once, which were still as bright as stars.</p>

  <p>In the end, the sword soul of the Shadow Bearing Sword was only a soul - not a real sword. Seeing as it was constantly being consumed, it would certainly eventually be subdued!</p>

  <p>Therefore, Zheng's soul once again shone brightly with an alluring golden light.</p>

  <p>Zheng sat quietly in a secret room. The Sword Clan, Harold, Yan were not capable of sensing the room's abnormality.</p>

  <p>Only Harper silently observed the strangeness.</p>

  <p>That said, Harper was still confused with what he was currently looking at.</p>

  <p>Logically speaking, Zheng simply couldn't conquer this sword with his current strength. In all honesty, it was more likely that he'd become a slave of the Shadow Bearing Sword!</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Harper truly hoped that Zheng could conquer this sword with his own strength and power. This was the only way that Zheng could qualify to obtain his wholehearted assist.</p>

  <p>Two hour had passed.</p>

  <p>Zheng was still sitting quietly on the secret room's floor.</p>

  <p>The Shadow Bearing Sword had the Soul-isolating Seal, which could completely isolate Zheng from the sword soul. Even Harper couldn't understand what was going on in Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>Four hours had now passed...</p>

  <p>Harper was getting more and more anxious.</p>

  <p>If Zheng really became the slave of the Shadow Bearing Sword, it wouldn't matter anymore whether or not Harper went for help. It would simply be too late, and Zheng's soul would be destined to suffer irreversible injury.</p>

  <p>Another hour passed, now making a total of five hours.</p>

  <p>It was then that Harper could no longer ignore his feeling of confusion.</p>

  <p>One way or another, now was the time that the outcome should be decided.</p>

  <p>Soul-level battles weren't like battles using martial arts skills, in which warriors fought each other for several rounds when their strength was approximately of the same level.</p>

  <p>Many soul-level confrontations were usually decided on the spot, and there was no time for special exercises. But Zheng had persisted for more than four hours, and the sword soul of the Shadow Bearing Sword was still in his mind. What were they doing?</p>

  <p>"Never mind. I'd better interfere first..." Harper thought.</p>

  <p>He waved his skeleton arm high up above his head.</p>

  <p>A trace of invisible soul energy immediately swept through the deep well and quickly traveled through the Sunrest Tree.</p>

  <p>It was true that Harper had been cursed and could no longer leave the Sunrest Tree. In several aspects, his fighting capacities had been greatly weakened. That said though, his soul had been the least affected of all...</p>

  <p>In less than a split second, his soul energy had already reached the Heavenly Sword Divine City.</p>

  <p>The moment this strand of soul energy wave flew into the city, Harold's, Marsh's and Gibson's expressions took a turn for the worse.</p>

  <p>Even Yan, Reinhard and the many True Gods equally all felt it.</p>

  <p>"Whose soul force is that? Does anyone know? Why is it so powerful?!"</p>

  <p>With a sudden bright flash, Harold left the palace, a look of vigilance wrinkling his features.</p>

  <p>Gibson and Marsh also followed quickly behind. The two Holy Beings were now ready to fight!</p>

  <p>This soul wave wasn't the most immense, but the energy gathered within it was another story. It was even stronger than that of a Holy Being!</p>

  <p>As for the other True Gods, they were holding their breaths in anticipation.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, it was as if a giant beast - more powerful than a Holy Being - was stomping over in their direction. All the weak creatures faced undeniable fear in their hearts.</p>

  <p>This soul wave appeared in the very center of the Heavenly Sword Divine City. After taking a short pause, it went on its way and headed toward the south of the city.</p>

  <p>"Do you think the soul is coming toward Zheng?" Harold asked.</p>

  <p>His voice was high and shrill, his eyes rimmed with panic. The secret room that the Sword Clan had arranged for Zheng was in the south of the city, and he was currently cultivating in seclusion there right now.</p>

  <p>With another flash, his figure disappeared from where he was standing.</p>

  <p>This time, when Harold reappeared, Marsh and Gibson had also made their way here.</p>

  <p>The three of them looked at each other and looked down in unison. The mansion below was Zheng's secret cultivation room, and that soul force had entered within! Their jaws were clenched with nerves.</p>

  <p>"What should we do now?" one of the Holy Beings asked.</p>

  <p>"Who released the soul force?" questioned another.</p>

  <p>The two Holy Beings gazed at Harold as they waited for a response.</p>

  <p>The soul was so powerful that even if they wanted to block it, they just didn't have the ability - not even the two of them combined.</p>

  <p>"I don't feel hostility coming from this soul," Harold stated calmly.</p>

  <p>If this soul really wanted to destroy Zheng's soul, it would be as easy as crushing an ant. It would be over in seconds.</p>

  <p>The three warriors could only pray that this soul force wouldn't harm Zheng. Or at least, to a bare minimum.</p>

  <p>Over in the secret practice room, Zheng was still sitting in an upright, motionless position. His legs were crossed and he was meditating, completely immersed in the activity of his mind.</p>

  <p>Just as the soul wave approached Zheng and was moments away from entering his mind, Zheng's eyes suddenly shot open. when he came back to himself, the surface of the Shadow Bearing Sword in his hand flashed with a cyan light!</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Originally, Zheng had been sealed by the Soul-isolating Seal of the Shadow Bearing Sword and thus, he was unable to sense anything outside his own mind. It was only normal that he hadn't sensed the soul force sent by Harper.</p>

  <p>Therefore, not even a second after opening his eyes, he grabbed the Shadow Bearing Sword with both his hands almost instinctively and launched a counterattack!</p>

  <p>The cyan sword radiance flashed and slashed at Harper's soul force.</p>

  <p>The strand of soul was caught off guard and in its confusion, Zheng took his opportunity to slice it in half.</p>

  <p>However, once it was halved, the soul didn't disappear as expected.</p>

  <p>Instead, it slowly turned into gray, wispy shadows. These shadows slowly took shape, and finally transformed into Harper's features.</p>

  <p>"Master Harper!" Zheng shouted, feeling stunned.</p>

  <p>Now that he came to think of it, he had felt that the soul's aura was somewhat familiar. In Zheng's defense however, when something suddenly broke into the secret practice room, anyone would choose to attack!</p>

  <p>Harper's phantom floated in the practice room, looking down at Zheng.</p>

  <p>Harper stared at him blankly, trying to hold back the surprise in his expression. It wasn't working for him much. "Did you really tame that Shadow Bearing Sword?"</p>

  <p>"Yes." Zheng nodded his head briskly.</p>

  <p>"How is that possible? How did you succeed something like that?"</p>

  <p>Harper asked in a bewildered tone of voice.</p>

  <p>Harper had thought of two ways to tame the sword. That said, with Zheng's current cultivation, it was just an impossible accomplishment.</p>

  <p>Zheng blinked his eyes a few times and said, "At first, the sword soul was constantly attacking my mind... Then, it fused completely with my own soul after I cut it into pieces with my own two hands..." His voice trailed off.</p>

  <p>As he listened to Zheng, Harper fell silent for a long time before he slowly asked, "Is that all? Just that simple, hmm?"</p>

  <p>"That's all," Zheng said tightly. Zheng pursed his lips and a little displeasure showed on his face.</p>

  <p>How could he say that was simple? How could he be so degrading? Zheng frowned.</p>

  <p>Just like a maniac, the sword soul had attacked Zheng continuously and ferociously without stopping.</p>

  <p>Zheng had clenched his jaw and grinded his teeth hard in order to continuously reactivate his soul force and fight back. He hadn't had an easy time whatsoever.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't even know how he had endured the last few hours.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the light on the surface of the sword soul suddenly dimmed, and at last, it turned into a few pieces of soul fragments before finally integrating into Zheng's soul. Only then did he completely get rid of the Soul-isolating Seal.</p>

  <p>As he repeated what Harper had said in his mind, Zheng felt a little helpless.</p>

  <p>In the end, the Shadow Bearing Sword was so dangerous and Harper hadn't even warned him beforehand. If he had let his guard down even just a little earlier, he might have been the one devoured by the sword soul instead!</p>
