<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Once Luo Luo Zheng began to exhibit his set of Sword Step, the eyes of Woolley, Thomson and a few other children immediately lit up. All of them were in awe of Luo Zheng's magnificent display of skill.</p>

  <p>Due to the Eagle Sword Skill that Woolley had used previously, Luo Luo Zheng had already understood the strangeness of the divine land. The cultivation methods, which were practiced by the disciples supported by the True Gods, were extremely exquisite. Each disciple would cultivate many of those methods in their lifetime. Perhaps those methods were inherited from the comprehension of Holy Beings and later inherited from the Divine Dao!</p>

  <p>However, the distance between divine citizens and those disciples was extremely far. As such, their abilities were also vastly different.</p>

  <p>When the divine citizens finally grew up, they would naturally have incredible strength. Additionally, their perception would be several times better than those of the divine land's martial artists. However, it was difficult for the divine citizens to even get a chance to learn some of the most basic martial arts of the universe! Luo Luo Zheng had no idea how such a situation had developed. Pity and disappointment were in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Perhaps it was because the little mountain village was too remote. Or maybe, it was because the situation had been developed in the divine land for countless years. Nonetheless, their predicament should be addressed as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>Although the divine citizens did not possess any powerful martial arts manuals, their physiques were still powerful and they had extraordinary perception. Each of them meticulously watched Luo Zheng's movements. After Luo Luo Zheng finished his Sword Step, the eyes of Woolley and the children were full of admiration!</p>

  <p>"Hooo... hooo... hooo?"</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng ascended to the Upper World, it was no longer important to fight against a martial artist with sword moves. As such, most of the cultivation methods he had gathered over the years became less useful.</p>

  <p>There were many cultivation methods that he could only discard.</p>

  <p>But since there were so many restrictions within the divine land, Luo Luo Zheng also understood that in a fight against those True Gods, the cultivation methods he had could often be used to reverse the situation!</p>

  <p>After he displayed the Sword Step, Luo Luo Zheng put away the wooden sword. He looked at the children and said flatly, "This set of Sword Step is only the most basic steps of the swordsmanship. However, if you can master it thoroughly, you will be able to lay a solid foundation. You should try your best to comprehend it..."</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng finished his words, Woolley and the other children felt confused. Their eyes, which were earlier filled with admiration, became clouded with bewilderment...</p>

  <p>They had too little knowledge of martial arts. As their little mountain village was too secluded, they would only receive little information and knowledge, or worse, none at all. Although they knew that the Sword Step was profound, how could they comprehend the profoundness behind it in such a short time?</p>

  <p>As he saw their puzzled expressions, Luo Luo Zheng curled his lips. These guys seemed to be even more ignorant than he had imagined. When he first comprehended the Sword Step, he purely followed the rhythm of Tianming's movements to practice it. It could be said that he mastered the Sword Step almost on his own. It seemed that the divine citizens could not understand such things. It must also be the first time they encountered such knowledge from outside the village.</p>

  <p>"I'll demonstrate it again..." Luo Luo Zheng said patiently. The expression on his face had grown rather amused.</p>

  <p>"Wait! I think I can do it Let me have a try!"</p>

  <p>Thomson stood up and asked Luo Luo Zheng for his wooden sword. As Thomson shook the sword lightly, his left leg slid across the ground as if it was gliding over a piece of ice. With this step, he immediately became extremely nimble. His movement could still be improved, but it was a lot better than before.</p>

  <p>"Hooo... hooo... hooo?"</p>

  <p>Thomson's movements were still much slower than Luo Zheng's. After he took the first step, Thomson would have to think for a while before he could continue to slide forward. Additionally, even after he pondered, he would sometimes even take the wrong step.</p>

  <p>However, he had still integrally practiced the Sword Step that Luo Luo Zheng had just displayed! Such a feat was pretty marvelous for his first try.</p>

  <p>After he withdrew his sword, Luo Luo Zheng approached Thomson. With a gentle face, he praised Thomson, "Not bad. Although you are not that nimble, you've already grasped the concept. Otherwise, it would be impossible for you to remember all of my movements. Your comprehension is better than others'!"</p>

  <p>As he heard Luo Zheng's sincere praise, Thomson was so happy that he almost jumped up from the ground.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, his brother, Woolley, had a depressed look on his face. A gloomy atmosphere had surrounded him.</p>

  <p>In the deep mountains of the Vast Sky Region, every village would train their own martial artists. They often raised a warrior to defend their territory. After all, occasionally, vicious creatures would appear in the mountains. Sometimes, those vicious creatures would wreak havoc in the vegetable fields. Some of them would even have disputes with the villagers, which would require the help of the martial artists of the village.</p>

  <p>Woolley was the warrior of the Misty Mountain Village. As such, the village had paid a high price for his cultivation. However, Woolley's talent was average at best. Additionally, the Misty Mountain Village was not rich with resources. The village could barely give him the rare resources he needed. Therefore, Woolley's strength was also mediocre.</p>

  <p>After he saw the talent that his little brother had displayed seemed to far surpass his own, Woolley felt both depressed and happy for his little brother. A mix of admiration and regret crept in his heart. He wondered if he should let his brother become Luo Zheng's disciple...</p>

  <p>Over the next few days, Luo Luo Zheng continued to teach the children the Sword Step. Everyone was very eager to comprehend the profound movements.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng also saw some benefits in his interaction with the villagers.</p>

  <p>He could learn more information about the Vast Sky Region.</p>

  <p>Additionally, since the village provided him a place to stay, he could unravel the black threads in his cinnabar field with ease.</p>

  <p>The villagers of the Misty Mountain Village were all very kind. They knew that Luo Luo Zheng was a proving godly warrior. Additionally, he even taught a few children the swordsmanship every day. Naturally, they were very grateful and always made the best food in the village for Luo Luo Zheng to eat.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the villagers had all sorts of speculations about Luo Zheng's background. His mysteriousness and kind character created colorful rumors about him.</p>
