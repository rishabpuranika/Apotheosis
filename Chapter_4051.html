</p>

  <p>They snuck in and left the cave in under three minutes.</p>

  <p>The members of the Evil Tiger race were not alerted during the entire process.</p>

  <p>Decker had seen these people's theurgies but the methods they used still shocked him.</p>

  <p>How were they able to take the Evil Tiger race's Arcana so easily?</p>

  <p>It was all just a piece of cake for them!</p>

  <p>The series of events was inconceivable to Decker but the others simply went on as if everything was entirely normal.</p>

  <p>As an independent island, the Night View Island had no means to communicate with the outside world, so it didn't have as many Other Shore Tokens. The combat strength was mainly increased through fusions with Treacherous Beings.</p>

  <p>However, even if these Treacherous Beings were powerful, they weren't as good as Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Zheng and his companions still had the Holy Stones and the Light of Annihilation, which made it easy for them to deal with the hostility-level Treacherous Beings that might come their way. Of course, that was their trump card, so they wouldn't use it unless it was truly necessary.</p>

  <p>After they left the Evil Tiger race's territory, Zheng and his group made their way towards another connected mountain.</p>

  <p>Decker was in a good mood. He had proved his value to Zheng and robbed the Evil Tiger race in accordance with the Wooden Leaf race's wishes.</p>

  <p>"The members of the Desert race are living at the foot of the mountain.</p>

  <p>They're our allies," he told them.</p>

  <p>"Is robbing an ally frowned upon here?" Pearson asked. Decker hurriedly waved his hand.</p>

  <p>"I'm very familiar with the Desert race so it would be easier for us to take their Arcana, but they went to the Ghost Mountain not long ago and have consumed all their Arcana. It wouldn't make much sense to go there since you won't really get any."</p>

  <p>The races on the Night View Island were usually shrewd realists.</p>

  <p>Both the Wooden Leaf race and the Desert race acknowledged their weakness so they decided to forge an alliance with each other. Once one of them became a strong force, they would immediately turn friends into enemies.</p>

  <p>"Next," Zheng said dismissively.</p>

  <p>It was entirely possible for Decker to have been lying. There was a high chance that he was taking advantage of Zheng and his group in order to suppress the Wooden Leaf race's opponents.</p>

  <p>Whether this possibility was true or not, Zheng and his group did not really care.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, they arrived at the third mountain.</p>

  <p>Snake-shaped creatures gathered around and flitted here and there.</p>

  <p>These snake-shaped creatures could communicate through telepathy. If one of their members were attacked, the rest would know straight away.</p>

  <p>"I believe in your strength but fighting with these guys may end badly. I hope you reconsider," Decker told them.</p>

  <p>Fuxi shrugged in nonchalance. "Next."</p>

  <p>They were in a hurry to accumulate Arcana and couldn't waste any time dawdling.</p>

  <p>On the fourth mountain, they came upon the sheep-headed men.</p>

  <p>According to Decker, this race was very suitable since they had moderate strength and no doubt had acquired quite a lot of Arcana.</p>

  <p>Zheng and his group quietly observed the comings and goings of the race for about three minutes before they were able to find the opportunity to sneak in.</p>

  <p>It was generally the same process. After they gained control of the huge sheep-headed man, they plundered all the Arcana and left quietly.</p>

  <p>After that, everyone expected things to sail smoothly but that wasn't the case.</p>

  <p>The races they chose afterward were all bust. Either the races had used up all of their Arcana or they had a special way to hide them. Some leaders were also incredibly resolute and would rather die than hand them over.</p>

  <p>In the end, Zheng and his group managed to gather fewer Arcana than they would've liked.</p>

  <p>One thing that they realized during this series of plunders though was that it was a wise decision to have kept Decker by their side.</p>

  <p>His input proved to be extremely useful, especially when they had to deal with troublesome races.</p>

  <p>When night came, the group dug out a stone cave on top of a mountain and settled there.</p>

  <p>They had collected a total of three hundred and forty-two Arcana, including the Arcana that had been traded with the Grass Bull yesterday.</p>

  <p>Zheng pursed his lips as he calculated their spoils. "How many people can enter the Ghost Mountain with these Arcana?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"A person needs two hundred Arcana to enter," Decker answered. "So it means one and a half people can enter now. You have good luck and great strength, and your efficiency is really high."</p>

  <p>In his eyes, their rate of accumulation was already incredible.</p>

  <p>The others, however, thought differently. To them, their efficiency was actually extremely slow and they had to pick up the pace tomorrow and earn more.</p>

  <p>Once darkness completely shrouded the Night View Island, the group settled and began to apply the Ghost Powder on the bodies.</p>

  <p>"This island is full of Ghost Powder. Where did it come from?" Zheng asked in the middle of his application.</p>

  <p>Decker simply shrugged. "Nobody really knows."</p>

  <p>"Hasn't anyone ever investigated this?" the Snake Goddess asked in curiosity. "Of course," Decker told them.</p>

  <p>"Even I've tried investigating it myself. The Ghost Powder is taken out of the sloths' pockets and the sloths are also Treacherous Beings. They usually hang out in the forest quietly."</p>

  <p>"The Ghost Powder in their pockets should be consumed very soon," King Ieuan said.</p>

  <p>"I lived with a sloth for quite a while. The powder in its pocket was almost unlimited. I've deliberately consumed all of it but it would only take a few minutes for its pocket to fill up all over again!" Decker narrated.</p>

  <p>"At first I thought it was collecting the Ghost Powder secretly so I tied it up, but then I saw its pocket swell automatically!"</p>

  <p>"Amazing," the group murmured.</p>

  <p>"Have you seen the inside of its pocket?" King Ieuan asked. "It might be connected with a space channel."</p>

  <p>It was very difficult for the Eternal Realm warriors to construct a space channel within the Three Purities Stage. Instant teleportation was also impossible, but there were a number of creatures who could do it.</p>

  <p>"I tried but then I almost died."</p>

  <p>Zheng couldn't help but frown at Decker's answer. "Why? What happened?"</p>

  <p>"The sloths' pockets are their exclusive domains. They turn hostile if you touch them," Decker muttered in explanation.</p>

  <p>He remembered it quite well. When he tried to open the sloth's pocket, all the sloths within the vicinity began to emanate a strong aura.</p>

  <p>The aura they exuded was much stronger than that of the hostility-level Treacherous Beings.</p>

  <p>Fearing for his life, Decker immediately bolted from that place.</p>

  <p>Those sloths chased him for more than a hundred miles before Decker managed to escape and survive.</p>

  <p>From then on, he never dared to investigate those sloths and their secrets anymore.</p>

  <p>"This island is full of strange things," Fuxi remarked.</p>

  <p>While they talked, white hairs continuously fell outside their cave and formed multiple white-haired monsters.</p>

  <p>Everyone looked much calmer this time and quietly watched the white-haired monsters trudge around.</p>

  <p>When they moved around the cave in a circle, the white-haired monsters suddenly reverted back into a pool of white hairs and gradually disappeared.</p>

  <p>Night soon passed.</p>

  <p>On the second day, Zheng and his group set off to plunder more Arcana off the other races.</p>

  <p>Still, everything went smoothly.</p>

  <p>Their targets were not very strong and were at the second or third tier on the Night View Island.</p>

  <p>Under Zheng's leadership, the group launched several sneak attacks which gave no room for the races to resist.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the spoils of their labor weren't as plentiful as they had hoped.</p>

  <p>The leaders of the races they plundered only held a few Arcana, and some had none at all.</p>

  <p>It would be the same for the oncoming days.</p>

  <p>The reason why these races only had a few Arcana to spare was finally revealed after they caught a race leader who spilled the fact that they had handed them all over to the Red Demon race.</p>

  <p>The Red Demon race was one of the top races on the Night View Island and they abused this position by forcing the other, smaller races to give them their Arcana.</p>

  <p>Since the Red Demon race had already robbed the other races, Zheng finally understood why they got so little during their raids in the past few days.</p>

  <p>On their seventh night, Zheng and his group applied the Ghost Powder on their bodies and rested in the cave.</p>

  <p>However, a shrill scream interrupted their slumber.</p>

  <p>It seemed to have come from a distance and didn't seem to be the last scream they would hear that night. King Ieuan was the first one up. "What was that? Squeak!"</p>

  <p>Zheng listened attentively and pointed out towards the distance. "Over there.</p>

  <p>Over the mountain. It's not just one person, but an entire group."</p>
