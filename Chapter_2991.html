  <p>
</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Kenelm lived alone in his house, far from his family.</p>

  <p>If other people had been living there, they would all have died, crushed under Baber's feet.</p>

  <p>As Kenelm looked over at the old man a small distance away, he realized that Baber was a powerful warrior at the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>He could not understand why this old man hated him so much. He racked his brain for any way he could have offended him, but Zheng's voice cut his thoughts short. "This person is probably a relative of the man in purple,"</p>

  <p>Zheng said seriously.</p>

  <p>Pulling a long face, Kenelm frowned.</p>

  <p>He relaxed his face within a few seconds, however, consoling himself with the thought that he hadn't, after all, killed the man in purple.</p>

  <p>Knowing that there was no way for him to escape, he had no choice but to step forward. He cupped his hands and said to the old man, "Sir, my name is Kenelm Lai. Forgive me if it is due to a lapse in my memory, but I don't think we have ever met before. I am wondering why you came to me..."</p>

  <p>Baber had spent the past few days in a blind rage since he learned of his grandson's death.</p>

  <p>He could only speculate who or what had actually killed his grandson. He thought it might have been the ghost. However, no matter what the true identity of the killer was, he knew for a fact that the dead body of his grandson had been destroyed by Kenelm and his friends. That was enough for Baber to desire their deaths.</p>

  <p>Before the shaking Kenelm could even finish his sentence, a green shadow, shaped like a human hand, appeared on Baber's own right hand. The shadow reached out towards Kenelm, who immediately felt an intense pressure on his entire body.</p>

  <p>Kenelm was completely paralyzed. Then, he was pulled towards the old man like metal to a magnet.</p>

  <p>As Kenelm was being pulled forward, Zheng stepped forward and harnessed the strength source within his body. He touched Kenelm lightly with one hand, using the Power Shaping to form an invisible piece of armor which pinned him to the ground.</p>

  <p>Baber looked shocked. He had not expected to fail in such a simple task.</p>

  <p>Even Baber's guards, who usually showed no emotion, looked surprised.</p>

  <p>"Master Baber didn't use all of his strength, did he?" one of them asked.</p>

  <p>"This brat actually has the power to resist?"</p>

  <p>"Nice try, boy. Don't be too confident in your pathetic skills."</p>

  <p>These guards were hand-picked from the elites of the Qi Clan. Most of them were also consummate True Gods that had entered the Sea of Truth, and they were almost on par with Zheng in cultivation level. They were curious to see how Zheng was able to resist Baber's magnetic pull.</p>

  <p>"Sir, if you have a score to settle with Kenelm, you can tell us first. Why would you want to fight him?" Zheng said dismissively.</p>

  <p>Although Baber was surprised at Zheng's strength, Zheng's words were not enough to stop him. "Huh, why should I explain myself to you, or anyone?" he scoffed.</p>

  <p>The green palm shadow on his right hand flitted slightly, and a strong aura bloomed from it.</p>

  <p>"The aura of the Other Shore Token and divine crystals..."</p>

  <p>Zheng murmured. As he watched the aura spread, he raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>He had met many powerful warriors at the Other Shore Realm and he could tell immediately that the green hand shadow the old man was using was his Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>However, this token was much weaker than those demonstrated by Emily and the others.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, Baber was a force to contend with. The pressure from the blooming aura was very high, even to Zheng.</p>

  <p>Kenelm, meanwhile, stood still, his face ashen.</p>

  <p>The tomb was his only chance, possibly, to climb the social ladder and enter a large sect. Even though he had obtained it accidentally, he had gotten himself into big trouble. If the Other Shore Realm master decided to kill him, there would be no escaping death.</p>

  <p>Unbeknownst to him, some True Gods were hiding in the buildings surrounding Kenelm's now destroyed house, observing the scene that now unfolded. They all somehow felt sympathy for him, even though they were not friends. Being residents of the Excellence City, they more or less knew Kenelm, a consummate True God.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>The green hand shadow suddenly expanded like a devil's claw, before sweeping down, aiming at Kenelm's head.</p>

  <p>Kenelm stood with baited breath, eyes closed, resigned to accepting his apparently inevitable death. However, instead of the fatal blow he was expecting to his head, he felt a hand grab him by the shoulder. With a flash of his eyes, Zheng had pulled Kenelm back by the shoulder, forcibly launching him backwards, away from the huge green hand about to deliver the death blow.</p>

  <p>"Ways-blending Energy!"</p>

  <p>The colorful burst of energy quickly took the shape of a palm that then hurtled towards the hand shadow.</p>

  <p>At the sight of Zheng's retaliation to his attack, Baber's lips contorted into a sarcastic grimace. 'Does a pathetic consummate True God like him really think he has a chance against me? I am an Other Shore Realm warrior! How naive!' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>Although Baber was only in the first stage of the Other Shore Realm, there was a large gap in understanding and control of energy between an Other Shore Realm warrior and a True God.</p>

  <p>The second the palms of the two hands touched each other in midair, Zheng's was crushed as easily as if it were made of paper or dry weeds. The old man's power turned out to be invincible.</p>

  <p>Nobody looked surprised. Zheng, however, did not give up. Staring at the palm in the air, he gave a single command. "Break!"</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>When crushed like this, the Ways-blending Energy lost a lot of its power. It could only release its destructive power when unrestrained.</p>

  <p>The moment Zheng's palm broke, it emitted a streak of blinding light which engulfed Baber's palm shadow completely.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the city lord's mansion, the lord of the Excellence City was taken aback at the sight of the pale-faced woman. He immediately hurried forward and bowed to her. "Master Laura, we are honored to have you, but may I ask why you are here?" he asked, not even daring to look up at her.</p>

  <p>"Are you leaving the Source World?"</p>

  <p>There was the chaos beyond the Source World.</p>

  <p>He could not, for the life of him, imagine a reason why this woman would ever want to come his small city. So he reasoned that she was just passing through, probably taking a shortcut to the Wild Goose Pass.</p>

  <p>"A man called Kenelm Lai discovered the tomb of a Stinger Guard," she said calmly, with a glance at the bowing lord. "I am here to take him back.</p>

  <p>So, take me to meet him."</p>

  <p>'The tomb of a Stinger Guard?' the lord thought, perplexed.</p>

  <p>Realizing the importance and urgency of this woman's mission, the city lord immediately sent his men after Kenelm, or at least news of him. After he had done that, he led the woman to the west of the city.</p>

  <p>At the midpoint of their journey, they encountered a burst of light, bright and intense as a solar flare.</p>

  <p>The aura of the energy coming off this light was very strange. The city lord thought for a second that it seemed to be similar to an internal momentum created by a True God, but it also seemed much more powerful than that.</p>

  <p>When the pale-faced woman and the three men in cyan saw the light, they also looked confused.</p>

  <p>"What kind of theurgy is this?" one of them said.</p>

  <p>"It's not the internal momentum of an Other Shore Realm warrior. It seems to be a True God's," said another.</p>

  <p>"What Godly Way is it? It's so powerful!"</p>

  <p>These Other Shore Realm warriors had also been True Gods once.</p>

  <p>However, to them, cultivating the Godly Ways was a formality, a mere means to reach the Other Shore Realm. It was no surprise that they had little understanding of the energy of the Godly Ways.</p>

  <p>"It is the Ways-blending Energy," the pale-faced woman said in a low voice.</p>

  <p>Her eyes glimmered with curiosity. "And whoever is responsible for this seems to have blended a great many of Godly Ways together."</p>
