<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>He didn't come back to Cloud Sect to participate in this farce.</p>

  <p>"How... how dare you! You dare to revolt against me in public!" Murry saw him leaving and was overjoyed. He could not take on Luo Zheng until now because he didn't have a legitimate reason to kill him before.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng could be in league with the demon. Murry could have put him to death after charging him for this crime, but he didn't have the right to do so within the laws. So he had just convicted Luo Zheng and hoped he would be beaten to death by the cudgels. But Luo Zheng survived easily. Murry wondered what his body was made of, or why he was not fearful of being bludgeoned.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng had obeyed him just now, Murry wouldn't have known how to deal with him.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng just revolted against him in front of an audience. He ridiculed the Commandment Hall, which gave Murry an admissible reason.</p>

  <p>"You dare rebel against the Commandment Hall and try to escape.</p>

  <p>According to the rules, I can kill you!" Murry shouted, a judgment pen in his hand. He moved behind Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>At the same time, he saw a shadow of a figure appearing at the gates.</p>

  <p>The intruder laughed. "I come here by accident. Master Qin, why are you shouting?"</p>

  <p>It was Fren.</p>

  <p>He hated Luo Zheng to the bone.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had beaten Yale almost to death during the trial for slaying demons.</p>

  <p>He killed Josef too, who had been appointed as the counselor to the imperial army with the help of the Zhuge Clan.</p>

  <p>The incident had angered the Zhuge Clan. Their leader had announced that as long as any of them encountered Luo Zheng, they were allowed to take his life straightaway.</p>

  <p>So Fren had come up with a plan. He told Murry to send someone to guard Drizzle Peak. When Luo Zheng finally came by, they took him to the Commandment Mount and charged him with a crime.</p>

  <p>Regardless of whether he confessed to the crime, they decided to find a way to kill him.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng didn't resist, they would beat him to death. If he resisted, it would be even better. In Cloud Sect, it was forbidden to kill one another for no reason.</p>

  <p>But if Luo Zheng disobeyed the order of the Commandment Hall, they were allowed to kill him in Cloud Sect within rights.</p>

  <p>It was a dead end either way, a trap especially set up for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Now Luo Zheng had revolted in public, so Fren naturally "happened to" pass by with an intention to rightfully kill him.</p>

  <p>It was easy for the Zhuge Clan to kill an outer disciple of the Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>"Young master Fren! This guy didn't obey the order of the Commandment Hall. Instead, he has rebelled against us in public and tried to make an escape. I hope you can help me in this," Murry responded, playing along with the act.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng watched Fren for a while and then turned to Murry. "Do you really need to put on an act? I know what's going on," he sneered.</p>

  <p>Fren laughed at him. "It doesn't matter if this is an act. Either way, you are going to die today! We want you to enjoy the show. It will be your very last source of entertainment!"</p>

  <p>As Fren finished speaking, the momentum of his body increased. He was certain that this day was Zheng's last. Even the Gods couldn't save him now.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was cornered. He faced Fren in his front and Murry at his back. Still, he didn't let a hint of panic pass his face.</p>

  <p>Fren was not a master of the Illuminating Soul Realm. Judging from his momentum, it seemed that his strength had increased since they had met last, but he was at about grade nine of the nature level. He had not yet reached the peak level.</p>

  <p>Murry, who was approaching Luo Zheng from behind, was at the same level as Fren.</p>

  <p>As long as they were not the masters of the Illuminating Soul Realm, Luo Zheng could handle them with his current strength.</p>

  <p>The dark life vitality surged quietly from the acupoints on Zheng's arm.</p>

  <p>"Fren, I said last time that my life remains in my hands only. If you want to take it, you can have a try... Unfortunately for you, you've missed the opportunity!" The demonic life vitality leaped out of Zheng's arm. The subtle dark-purple force exuded a kind of darkness that appeared as if it could kill someone at any moment now. "With your present strength, you are not qualified to take my life. But I can take yours any time I like!"</p>

  <p>Back at the auction house, Luo Zheng couldn't have admitted this to Fren, for he hadn't truly been the opponent.</p>

  <p>But today, Luo Zheng had edged through the level and become a nature creature.</p>

  <p>The change from life energy to life vitality was quite qualitative.</p>

  <p>Moreover, he had contemplated on the Sun Moon Stars Picture and grasped the power of the stars. The demonic life vitality had made a spurt of progress.</p>

  <p>The expression on Fren's face betrayed no fear. He could tell that Zheng's body had undergone a transformation, but Fren had a good reputation in the Cloud Sect for his strength. Moreover, lately it had increased. "Hah.</p>

  <p>You arrogant man, you are just at grade one of the nature level, yet you're so conceited? I wonder if someday you get to enter the Illuminating Soul Realm, will you kill everyone in our Zhuge Clan? I doubt you'll get the chance though, because you will be dead today!"</p>

  <p>"Oh? If I enter the Illuminating Soul Realm someday..." Luo Zheng wrinkled his brows as if in thought. "I won't just stop with the Zhuge Clan. If the top seven noble clans make me unhappy, I will take all of their lives!"</p>
