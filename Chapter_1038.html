  <p>Luo Zheng's heart was filled with sadness as he looked down at Yudie's peaceful, unconscious face.</p>

  <p>He was a person who could normally keep his emotions in check but there was no way to hide the sorrow he felt at Yudie's current state.</p>

  <p>He had emerged victorious in his battle with Eddie but it came with a terrible price. Most of Yudie's life energy had been taken away and she was now as good as dead.</p>

  <p>This wasn't something that he could ever have foreseen.</p>

  <p>The people outside continuously shouted his name and hailed him as their hero but Luo Luo Zheng was in no mood to join in the festivities. He silently ignored the fanfare and flew towards Oracle City.</p>

  <p>The three leaders of the World Commercial Alliance followed closely behind him. Right now, they were very concerned about what the boy had said to Luo Luo Zheng regarding the possibility of the York Divine Kingdom sending their people to the Central Region.</p>

  <p>If that truly happened, the Central Region would be plunged into the greatest crisis in history.</p>

  <p>War was not uncommon in the Central Region. In its most chaotic state, the entire continent was made witness to the great sect wars wherein every sect fought for their own, attacking each other relentlessly in hopes of coming out on top. The war that had been started by the Heavenly Evil Sect was by no means unprecedented in Central Region's history.</p>

  <p>However, these sect wars were ultimately internal conflicts.</p>

  <p>The York Divine Kingdom was an entirely different continent and any battle fought with them could be considered a fight against a potential invader.</p>

  <p>One Soul Sea Realm master would be enough to sweep through the entire Central Region.</p>

  <p>Sure, they had Luo Luo Zheng who was unprecedentedly strong but the fact remained that he was only a warrior at the Virtual Tribulation Realm. It would be impossible for him to go up against a Soul Sea Realm master. If a fight broke out between the Central Region and the York Divine Kingdom, who would rise up as their savior?</p>

  <p>This was a genuine concern. The Star Storm in the Chaotic Ocean of Stars had already stopped meaning that Soul Sea Realm masters could now easily pass through and reach the Central Region.</p>

  <p>A crisis loomed on the horizon but they were powerless to stop it.</p>

  <p>Three days later?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng looked up at the sky silently as he stood in front of the palace's entrance doors.</p>

  <p>An old man walked out from the palace and sighed with regret once he saw Luo Luo Zheng waiting for him.</p>

  <p>Oracle City was considered the richest in all of Central Region wherein all famous weapon refiners, alchemists, runic experts and doctors gathered.</p>

  <p>This old man was an example of a famous expert doctor. His name was Zaine Xue and he could be counted as a first-rate, miracle-working healer in the Central Region where famous doctors from all over the world gathered.</p>

  <p>"How is she?" Luo Luo Zheng asked him anxiously.</p>

  <p>But the expression on Zaine Xue's face was enough to answer Luo Zheng's question.</p>

  <p>If the cyan dragon himself claimed that he couldn't do anything, what more a mere doctor in the Central Region could do?</p>

  <p>However, desperation would always trump a person's logic. Despite knowing that it might not work, Luo Luo Zheng could only give Zaine Xue's expertise a try.</p>

  <p>"What Cloud Hall's leader has is not a disease," he declared. Zaine Xue was not someone who knew anything about the Law of Causality, nor did he know that Ning Yudie was hit by Eddie's Life and Death Wind, nevertheless he tried to explain to Luo Luo Zheng his findings according to his own understanding,</p>

  <p>"The life energy in our body has always been constant, right from the very moment we are born and absorb our first bits of energy in our mothers' womb. This is why little kids always give the impression of being full of vitality.</p>

  <p>Our bodies are like buckets filled with life energy, however, this life energy will slowly be consumed over time. In the case of warriors, they are actually able to increase the size of their buckets through cultivation. That way, both the bucket and the volume of life energy contained within would expand by ten, a hundred, even a thousand times which is why a warrior's lifespan is longer than that of a common person.</p>

  <p>As people age, their buckets will slowly decay and the life energy within them will gradually run out. Common people for example, despite not having any diseases, would still die at the age of eighty or ninety because their life energy would have been completely depleted at this time. It is the same with the leader?.</p>

  <p>The life energy in her bucket has almost been depleted and only a little energy is keeping her alive. It's fortunate that her bucket is much larger than that of other martial artists' and that little life energy remained is enough to keep her body from dying.</p>

  <p>However, she's not that different from a dead person now," Zaine Xue patiently explained to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>As one of the oldest and most famous doctors in Oracle City, Zaine Xue's temper was very bad. As the saying went, a person with great talent would always be very proud and insolent on account of their ability. Even the leaders of the World Commercial Alliance were not exempted from Zaine Xue's callous treatment.</p>

  <p>However, he was kind and patient with Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Is there any solution?" Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>He was already aware of everything that Zaine Xue had told him, but what he wanted was a concrete solution.</p>

  <p>Zaine Xue shook his head. "No," he answered firmly. "There are many elixirs in Central Region that can extend a person's lifespan, but they cannot really provide life energy.</p>

  <p>These elixirs can only repair the bucket and reduce the rate at which life energy is consumed. It is an entirely different matter from what the leader is currently facing."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng frowned but had no choice but to concede, "I see?"</p>

  <p>After Zaine Xue left, Luo Luo Zheng entered the palace. Ning Yudie slept on a brown wooden bed with several maids by her side. She had not changed at all. She only looked as if she was peacefully dreaming and stubbornly refused to wake up.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng could only watch her in silence as he looked back at their moments together. Back when they had just returned from the River Wave City, he had promised that if they could go through this crisis, he would marry her and cultivate with her.</p>

  <p>They had gone through the crisis and even defeated Eddie, but who would've ever thought that things would actually end up like this.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng walked towards Ning Yudie. The maids obediently stepped aside. He had originally planned to say something but he bit back the words on his lips.</p>

  <p>Determination flashed in his eyes as he looked at her sleeping figure. 'I won't let you die, ' he silently promised in his heart.</p>

  <p>With this promise, Luo Luo Zheng turned around and walked out of the palace. Back in the World Commercial Alliance headquarters, the three leaders and many Virtual Tribulation Realm warriors eagerly waited for his arrival.</p>

  <p>Once he arrived at the main entrance, Luo Luo Zheng saw Owen dressed smartly in a suit. His green scimitar hung on his waist and he stood ramrod straight, waiting for an order.</p>

  <p>Despite Eddie's death, survivors of his Heavenly Evil Sect still remained.</p>

  <p>Both the World Commercial Alliance and Cloud Hall were currently busy scouring the land to eliminate these independent warriors that had joined Eddie in the war.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, most of the warriors of the Heavenly Evil Sect had all scattered like frightened birds and beasts. Since their leader had died, they all had no choice but to flee for their lives.</p>

  <p>However, the Ethereal Spirit Sect remained as a headquarters for the Heavenly Evil Sect with most of their key items already having been moved there. The group of warriors gathered at the World Commercial Alliance headquarters were assigned to storm the Ethereal Spirit Sect that day.</p>

  <p>Owen couldn't wait to be deployed to this mission. He had heard that Eddie had imprisoned his lover within the Ethereal Spirit Sect after making it his headquarters.</p>

  <p>Although Eddie had been killed, many Virtual Tribulation Realm warriors remained to guard the Ethereal Spirit Sect. And with Owen's current cultivation level at the Internal Elixir Realm, he knew it would be impossible for him to save his lover all by himself. It was fortunate that Oracle City had a mobilizable force ready to go.</p>

  <p>Once all warriors had been gathered, they all advanced towards the Ethereal Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>A few days later, Luo Luo Zheng and several others appeared in the sky above the Ethereal Spirit Sect. Just as they arrived, all of the sect-protecting arrays in the Ethereal Spirit Sect had already been put in operation.</p>

  <p>Despite that the Ethereal Spirit Sect had been taken over by the Heavenly Evil Sect, the sect-protecting array Arnold had left behind had not been completely destroyed. Although Eddie had already died, there had never been a lack of ambitious martial artists in this world.</p>

  <p>The warriors of the Heavenly Evil Sect obviously hadn't given up and actually used the sect-protecting array of the Ethereal Spirit Sect as a last-ditch attempt to prolong their survival.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of some of the Virtual Tribulation Realm warriors of the Heavenly Evil Sect, they only had to hold out until the York Divine Kingdom masters arrived and reversed the situation for them.</p>

  <p>This was the only reason why they had not bothered with dispersing and remained to guard the Ethereal Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>"Arnold's Illusory Array is incomparable but it can only resist Virtual Tribulation Realm warriors," Luo Luo Zheng remarked. "Break the array!"</p>

  <p>The strength of the World Commercial Alliance's three leaders was equal to that of a Life and Death Realm warrior. Together with Luo Luo Zheng, and a lot of other Virtual Tribulation Realm Warriors, breaking the sect-protecting array would be no problem.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Evil Sect was already doomed given that a lot of their Virtual Tribulation Realm warriors had already died or heavily wounded. Most of the warriors that survived had fled in all directions, living the rest of their lives in anonymity. There were not many who were willing to stay in the Heavenly Evil Sect and fight till death.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>The sound was deafening as the Illusory Array crumbled under everyone's continuous attacks.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's figure transformed into a beam of light as he rushed towards the Ethereal Spirit Sect.</p>
