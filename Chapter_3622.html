<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As soon as the woman got out of her room, every disciple on the third floor turned their heads and focused their eyes on her. It was like a royalty suddenly appeared and graced them with her presence.</p>

  <p>There were a total of thirteen disciples on the third floor, twelve of whom were all men. She was the only woman, and she was regarded as the top disciple.</p>

  <p>Her attainments in martial arts surpassed each of the male disciples with a large margin.</p>

  <p>It was said that she was a one in a million talent that no one in the past had ever surpassed, nor would anyone in the future.</p>

  <p>Her name was Libby, the number one disciple of the Land of Sword Grief.</p>

  <p>In terms of gender, she didn't really have a special advantage in cultivation.</p>

  <p>However, when considering her age, she was the youngest amongst every disciple. On top of it, every disciple on the third floor was inferior to her in terms of strength.</p>

  <p>"Oh Libby, have you finished your cultivation?" A handsome man quickly approached her. He was Gabriel Liu, the eldest son of the Bright Mountain's leader, and he ranked seventh among the disciples on the third floor.</p>

  <p>"Where have you gone during your long secluded cultivation? I've been waiting for you in the Soul City but you never showed up," another man with a long hair asked as he tried to get her attention.</p>

  <p>This person was Ahern Ming, the son of the Ivory Mountain's leader.</p>

  <p>As soon as they saw Libby, these men flocked and circled her just to see her gallant face.</p>

  <p>"I didn't go to the Other Shore during my cultivation," Libby answered perfunctorily in a cold tone.</p>

  <p>"Then, did you make progress in your theurgy?" Gabriel inquired, trying to somehow change the awkward mood.</p>

  <p>Libby shook her head as her eyes diverted to the outside of the building.</p>

  <p>"We have to go now. Master Goran has arrived."</p>

  <p>Immediately after she finished speaking, she took a gentle step forward.</p>

  <p>In a flash, she had descended from the third floor to the front of the building, making it seem like the distance between the two spots was just a couple of steps away.</p>

  <p>"Glad to see you again, Master Goran," Libby greeted politely.</p>

  <p>"I'm happy to see you too, Libby," Goran replied with a broad smile across his face.</p>

  <p>Libby was actually recommended by Goran to the Oneness Sky Palace, and since then, they considered her as a gift from heaven.</p>

  <p>It wouldn't take much of her time to reach an equivalent status to that of Goran.</p>

  <p>But with all her achievements, she had always treated Goran with the same utmost respect and politeness as in the older times.</p>

  <p>As they continued in talking, the rest of the disciples from the third floor also jumped down from the windows and landed to where Libby and Goran were.</p>

  <p>They approached Goran and greeted him while bowing down respectfully.</p>

  <p>Soon after, the disciples from the second floor also came down.</p>

  <p>Zheng, who was among them, didn't exactly know what was happening, and just decided to follow his fellow disciples. As he saw who the reason for the commotion was, he hurriedly walked towards Goran with cupped hands and greeted him, "It's been a while, Master Goran!"</p>

  <p>"Zheng! I've heard that you already obtained first place among all disciples on the second floor now. That's incredible progress. You never failed to surprise me!" Goran didn't hold back on his praises.</p>

  <p>As Oneness Governors, Goran and Athemar were tasked with a significant mission of searching for bright human talents.</p>

  <p>The Sword Light Palace, which was founded by Athemar, had already recommended a large number of talents to the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>However, despite the great number of disciples that they endorsed, only a few of them were considered to be outstanding.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Goran eyed for quality over quantity. He had only recommended a small number of disciples since then— one of whom was Libby. But with Libby's endorsement alone, Goran garnered a higher reputation than any of the other Oneness Governors.</p>

  <p>Every time they would talk about Libby's achievements, even Athemar couldn't help but sigh in awe. It was a unanimous belief that Libby was probably the greatest disciple to exist since the establishment of the Oneness Sky Palace. It also came up in conversations that it might be just a matter of time before she became a mountain head.</p>

  <p>Such an excellent disciple was truly unprecedented.</p>

  <p>It was almost carved in stone that the Oneness Governors regarded that no one would ever be able to measure up to her.</p>

  <p>However, all of that changed a few years ago when Goran met another promising disciple who had all the capabilities of surpassing even Libby.</p>

  <p>That was Zheng</p>

  <p>"So that's the disciple who suddenly ranked first on the second floor."</p>

  <p>"Yeah, I've heard about him. On the first day that he joined the Land of Sword Grief, he became the top disciple on the first floor. Then, about two months later, he ranked first among the disciples on the second floor."</p>

  <p>"It's kind of preposterous to say but… his progress is even faster than Libby's."</p>

  <p>The disciples on the third floor had heard the news about Zheng. However, since they rarely came out and halted in their cultivation, this was their first to actually see him in person.</p>

  <p>In Libby's case, she was even more isolated from the outside world due to her long-term closed-door cultivation. Thus, it was her first time to even hear the name of  Zheng Luo.</p>

  <p>For all those who were familiar with the overall prowess and capabilities of the disciples in there, it would be an otherworldly feat to reach the top of the first floor in a day and especially reach the top of the second floor in just two months.</p>

  <p>No one would be able to deny that Zheng's current progressing speed far surpassed that of Libby.</p>

  <p>With this thought in mind, Libby turned her head and took a glance at Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng, who was standing some meters away from her, politely nodded in reply as he noticed Libby's gaze directed at him.</p>

  <p>He had essentially heard of Libby's name several times already on the arena, but he had no idea what kind of person she was or what she even looked like. That was why when he saw that she was actually a petite woman, he wasn't able to hide the hints of surprise in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Are you one of those disciples who have just returned from the Chaotic Source World?" Libby asked with a straight face.</p>

  <p>She believed that Zheng was definitely not a newcomer who had just reached the Chaotic Source Realm, but someone who had joined the Land of Sword Grief by chance. Otherwise, it would be impossible for him to achieve such a degree of improvement in a very short time.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he is one of them," someone butted in before Zheng could answer the question.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing the unexpected answer, Libby's eyes flashed with a sullen look.</p>

  <p>Libby was not born from a great family, but ever since she joined the Land of Sword Grief, she had always been treated like royalty.</p>

  <p>Moreover, even the descendants of the mountain heads weren't given the same treatment that they were giving her.</p>

  <p>However, this new disciple had managed to break her record in a manner that didn't even make it a close competition. Realizing all of this, she naturally felt displeased.</p>

  <p>As an arrogant genius, she believed that even with all Zheng's accomplishments, he wouldn't have the guts to challenge her. She provokingly asked, "The beginning of another month is coming soon. So are you going to challenge me?"</p>

  <p>Neither Libby nor any of the other disciples on the third floor thought that Zheng would even dare to do so.</p>

  <p>It was not like he would be just facing a bunch of slightly powerful Roccos on the third floor.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng managed to easily defeat Rocco, who was supposedly the top disciple on the second floor before he came, the gap between the second and third floor disciples was extremely huge.</p>

  <p>It was the primary reason why Rocco was still held back on the second floor for so long.</p>

  <p>Then, unexpectedly, they heard a response in a nonchalant tone, "Yes, that's exactly what I want to do. Hope you don't mind."</p>

  <p>It hadn't been long after Zheng merged with the Civilization Artifact of the human race. He had been exploring the uses of the book he acquired.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven told Zheng that he would grant various abilities into the book according to his needs.</p>

  <p>In that book, there were the energy souls of the thirty-nine human heroes.</p>

  <p>Although the energy souls were not as strong as their real presences, they had fully inherited their theurgies. Just imagining that all these abilities could be utilized through the book, any opponent during combat would surely tremble.</p>

  <p>However, it was such a pity that Zheng wasn't able to test the book's prowess on the arena in the Land of Sword Grief. However, Zheng had also absorbed a large amount of Body-strengthening Jades. Though his physical body had not yet reached its limits, it wouldn't be long before he could have a breakthrough and reach the Wild God Body Realm.</p>

  <p>'This will be a good chance to test the increase of power in my physical body.' This was the thought inside Zheng's mind as he answered Libby's question with a straight face.</p>

  <p>When it came to the competition to recognize the first place in the Land of Sword Grief, Zheng didn't really pay much attention to it. He had a deeper goal in mind that was of more significance.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, his answer was obviously wrongly perceived by the disciples on the third floor. All they heard was a response from someone full of himself.</p>

  <p>"Hey, did you hear that? He actually has the guts to challenge Libby!"</p>

  <p>"I admit that he is a rare genius, but is he thinking that he could just really be on par with someone from the third floor? This guy is mocking us!"</p>

  <p>"On top of that, of all the third floor disciples, he wanted to challenge Libby! What a sick joke!"</p>

  <p>The male disciples from the third floor hurled out insults in response to Zheng's misplaced confidence.</p>

  <p>Their words reached Zheng's ears, but he didn't seem to mind them in the slightest. "It's kind of funny because the disciples from the first and second floor said the exact same thing when I challenged Cleon and Rocco, and you knew what happened next. I wonder if you would still wear those smug faces, once I make you eat your words," Zheng fired back with a subtle smirk.</p>
