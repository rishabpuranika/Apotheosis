  <p>
</p>

  <p>After adding that stripe, Campbell said, "I have tried this for six times already. And I have failed each and every time. It's quite possible that I'll fail once again."</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, Campbell remained calm and collected. His composure caused Luo Zheng and the Primeval Lord of Heaven sheer anxiety.</p>

  <p>The Treacherous Beings were practically invincible and immortal.</p>

  <p>If Campbell failed once again, he could merely return to the Whining Road and be resurrected.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng and the others would be in big trouble. Therefore, this whole situation was extremely nerve-wracking.</p>

  <p>"If I live through this, your friends might survive as well. But if I fail, you can't blame me..." After he warned Luo Zheng, Campbell pointed his silver spear towards the Snake Goddess' feet.</p>

  <p>"Da!" He began channeling his energy.</p>

  <p>Swoosh...</p>

  <p>The bright silver energy poured down like mercury. Campbell dragged the long spear on the ground and began walking around the Snake Goddess and the others.</p>

  <p>After he walked around, a bright silver circle of light surrounded them. The circle was as thick as an arm.</p>

  <p>"Please tell your friends not to step outside the circle of light," Campbell told Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was only vaguely aware of what was happening outside. He couldn't quite see them clearly. Fortunately, the Heavenly Obsession Civilization's Civilization Artifact was able to instantly decipher what Campbell said.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng understood this, he immediately asked the Wing King if they could see a silver circle of light around them.</p>

  <p>After receiving a positive answer from the Wing King, Luo Zheng told him what Campbell said. The Wing King conveyed Luo Zheng's message to everyone at once. "The Treacherous Being said that this silver circle of light can protect us! We must not step out of it."</p>

  <p>As their group saw the numerous large-headed monsters, they were filled with shock. They were even more surprised when they heard what the Wing King just said. Their expressions showed utter confusion.</p>

  <p>They could not quite comprehend how a small silver circle of light could keep the large-headed Treacherous Beings at bay. These creatures were almost indestructible.</p>

  <p>However, they were quickly running out of options. Even if they were quite skeptical about it, all they could do now was to stay inside this circle of light.</p>

  <p>The large-headed monsters were slowly edging closer towards where they were standing. The nearest monster was only ten feet away from them.</p>

  <p>With that, Luo Zheng bellowed and then gently shook his spear. With a mighty leap, he rose towards the sky like an eagle.</p>

  <p>He soared upwards with such an astonishing speed. In a split second, he was hovering in the air like a silver ribbon.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the large-headed monsters that were moving so slowly on the ground rapidly jumped into the air as soon as Luo Zheng's body soared upwards.</p>

  <p>They were like beasts that smelled blood and went into a frenzy. They turned into black shadows and instantly pounced towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng clutched the long spear tightly in his right hand. Then, he held it out in front of him and it began to spin at such great speed. It almost looked like a spinning silver millstone.</p>

  <p>The first large-headed monster to reach his position charged directly at him.</p>

  <p>It opened its enormous mouth and attempted to bite him.</p>

  <p>"Hey now..." Luo Zheng sneered.</p>

  <p>As it drew closer, a mocking smile appeared on Luo Zheng's face. With the tip of his silver spear, he drew a silver wheel in the air. It instantly surged towards the monster but it merely passed through its center.</p>

  <p>The Treacherous Beings were very tricky to deal with. The main reason was because they could not be easily defeated with ordinary methods. One had to be familiar with their movements and abilities.</p>

  <p>Even if their bodies were twisted, squeezed, or even stretched into noodle-like figures, they could just easily recover from it.</p>

  <p>However, the silver energy emanating from Campbell's armor had a miraculous effect on the Treacherous Beings.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>A ray of silver light streaked across the monster's huge and ugly head. It looked like a sharp weapon leaving a mark at a metal ball.</p>

  <p>The large-headed monster's oval head sustained a deep cut from the tip of the spear. It fell downwards as it struggled with the serious wound on its head.</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish...</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng slightly withdrew the silver spear and it swiftly stabbed backwards from under his right arm.</p>

  <p>Puff, puff, puff! The group heard several gusts of air from above.</p>

  <p>They saw that the silver spear had shot four rays of silver light out consecutively. It looked like four silver dragons that accurately pierced through the four large-headed monsters behind Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The spear light that effectively pierced the monsters extended straight into the distance behind them. It even shot all the way out of the round tray. But in the blink of an eye, the light strangely disappeared.</p>

  <p>As they watched this intense fight, Luo Zheng's companions huddled inside the silver circle of light and were utterly terror-stricken.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the large-headed monsters seemed to choose Luo Zheng as their main target as soon as Campbell used Luo Zheng's body to wage a fierce battle against them.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, there were still six monsters on the ground. They were moving slowly around the silver circle of light. It looked like they were thoroughly wary and afraid of the circle because they didn't even dare step on it. They were staring at the sky as they moved. Their gaze followed Luo Zheng's every movement. They seemed ready to pounce on him as soon as an opportunity presented itself.</p>

  <p>"This silver circle of light is incredibly mystical. The large-headed Treacherous Beings don't even dare step over it. Squeak!" King Ieuan exclaimed in its amazement. It couldn't believe how powerful it was.</p>

  <p>"It's not that they don't dare enter it. They are merely disgusted with this kind of energy," the Snake Goddess uttered.</p>

  <p>"Well, disgust is also rooted from fear," replied the leader of the black-robed men. "This silver energy obviously has an extraordinary effect upon the Treacherous Beings. It's very similar to the energy released by my Black River Gecko!"</p>

  <p>It was true that the Black River Gecko raised by the leader of the black-robed men also bore the same effect. However, the Black River Gecko was too small in size to fight against the Treacherous Beings.</p>

  <p>One after another, the large-headed monsters turned into black shadows and pounced at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, it didn't matter how fast the monsters moved or how wide their mouths were. They would easily be pierced through or taken down by the silver spear light. After receiving serious blows from the silver energy, the large-headed monsters were no longer able to recover. They would instantly fall to the ground and struggle for a while. Then they would collapse and lay there motionlessly.</p>

  <p>Once in a while, a few severely injured monsters would land directly inside the circle of light. The Eternal Realm Hunters would quickly move them out of the circle.</p>

  <p>"Unbelievable. That spear is incredibly powerful!" Thurston commended out loud.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Pearson had a puzzled look upon his face. He asked his companions, "These Treacherous Beings are all at the hostility level. So why is there such a huge gap between their strength and the strength of the one that has possessed Luo Zheng?"</p>

  <p>"The Treacherous Being that has possessed Luo Zheng's body is not the one that's powerful. Rather, it's the silver energy emanating from the spear and armor," the Snake Goddess responded solemnly. "If we can wield that kind of energy, it will also be very easy for us to kill those large-headed Treacherous Beings!"</p>

  <p>When they heard this, the others nodded in agreement. If they could control the silver energy as well, they should be able to deal with the Treacherous Beings effectively too.</p>

  <p>In such a short span of time, Luo Zheng had already killed almost forty large-headed monsters. He annihilated those powerful monsters as easily as if he was merely slaughtering chickens and sheep. Naturally, everyone's despondent and dejected mood disappeared. Their morale had increased significantly.</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh... They heard a rushing noise near them.</p>

  <p>The eight large-headed monsters that had been crawling over not far away also leapt into the air.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng swung his long spear around. All of a sudden, his calm gaze froze. At that point, the silver spear shot out countless small rays of light.</p>

  <p>If one viewed this scene from below, it looked like a shower of silver rain.</p>

  <p>Those large-headed monsters were effortlessly torn into pieces by it. As they were struck by the silver light, they fell straight down.</p>

  <p>However, three more monsters pounced on him from behind as soon as he killed these eight monsters.</p>

  <p>The long silver spear in Luo Zheng's hand appeared as though it had a soul. With just a light flick, it automatically stabbed three times behind him. If he could keep this up without any untoward incident, it would be really easy to kill those monsters.</p>

  <p>But at that very moment, the silver light on Luo Zheng's armor and spear suddenly dimmed. The change in its glow was extremely noticeable.</p>

  <p id="top_10">Poof! Poof!</p>

  <p>The first two strikes were still able to pierce through two of the monsters.</p>

  <p>Upon the third strike, however, the silver light on his armor and spear disappeared entirely.</p>

  <p>They noticed that the power of the third strike was far less than that of the previous ones. The monster blocked it with ease.</p>

  <p>The expression on Luo Zheng's face slightly changed when he failed to pierce through the third monster with his spear.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smashed the large-headed monster into the ground forcefully with the shaft of the spear. He managed to do it in the speed of light.</p>

  <p>But without the massive support of the silver energy, Luo Zheng's attack was unable to cause any substantial damage to the monster. As soon as the monster landed on the ground, it immediately bounced right up and charged towards Luo Zheng once more.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng watched this, he swiftly came down and landed beside the Snake Goddess and the others. Meanwhile, his spear was already pointed at the silver circle of light.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The long spear appeared as though it was a vacuum that was sucking the light in. It absorbed all of the silver energy in the circle!</p>

  <p>Once again, the tip of the spear flashed with bright silver light. Meanwhile, the monster was already closing in on Luo Zheng. It opened its mouth wide and bared its sharp teeth as if it was determined to swallow Luo Zheng whole.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>A mark of Eight Diagrams exploded directly on the face of the monster. It forcefully pushed it dozens of feet away!</p>

  <p>It was Fuxi who launched the attack.</p>

  <p>Campbell, controlling Luo Zheng's body, looked back at Fuxi and nodded with thanks. After that, he pointed his long spear at the monster and slaughtered it.</p>
