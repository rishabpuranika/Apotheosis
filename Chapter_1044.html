<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did not hold anything back from his loved ones. This included his fate to lead the world of chaos with Yan as his guide. He was a little muddled about these things, for they were mere guesses and conjectures, but he wanted Yan to understand that this was their fate.</p>

  <p>If he wanted complete control of his destiny, he needed to have enough strength. Unfortunately, he wasn't strong enough right now. Far from it.</p>

  <p>Because he was unable to change his and Yan's fate, he could only watch helplessly as Yan was taken away.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng slowly narrated the situation while Yan listened on quietly. When Luo Zheng talked about all the dangers he had dealt with, she widened her eyes and covered her mouth with her small hands, a worried expression on her face.</p>

  <p>Yan found it hard to swallow that her brother had experienced so much danger in the past few years, and all of it for her sake.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng finished speaking, Yan let out a long sigh of relief. She vaguely understood their fate.</p>

  <p>The two siblings were destined to walk a life of struggle.</p>

  <p>However, compared to Luo Zheng, Yan was a bit more fortunate, for she only needed to be patient and wait for her brother.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, however, was risking his blood and life to fight his fate. In this journey of destiny, any misstep could lead him to death.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, but I understand now." Yan's eyes were red. She knew that she shouldn't have blamed him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng just smiled. "I should be the one apologizing to you. I'm worthless. If I had enough strength, I wouldn't have let anyone take you away, even if it was God's will. Certainly not that young man."</p>

  <p>Hearing Zheng's words, Yan smiled back. "I believe you. You'll get stronger soon."</p>

  <p>Yan's eyes shone with blinding trust.</p>

  <p>The reunion was short, but the brother and sister cherished every second of it. They strolled in the forest before reluctantly entering the Ethereal Spirit Hall.</p>

  <p>As they walked in, Zheng's gaze landed on the young man's face. "I can allow you to take Yan away," he stated coldly.</p>

  <p>The young man's mouth curved in a faint smirk. "You don't have the ability to refuse."</p>

  <p>A streak of vital light left Zheng's eyes. He fixed his gaze on the young man, replying, "You are right. I'm not strong enough to stop you at the moment.</p>

  <p>But I will be one day. If anything bad happens to Yan before it, you will pay!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't feel that the young man in front of him was very hostile. His reason for taking Yan away was not so bothersome, so Zheng's tone was not too harsh.</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, the young man kept smiling. "I'm looking forward to the day you will be strong enough to be my match."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng frowned. The man was much too stronger than him. Luo Zheng didn't know how many years it would be before he could fight him, so there was no reason in speaking any further.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, something struck him. No one else could solve this problem, but this young man might have a way.</p>

  <p>Yudie's life had been exhausted. It might not be too difficult for this young man to bring her back to life. It should be just a piece of cake for him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was never willing to ask others for help, but since this involved Ning Yudie, he had to swallow his pride regardless.</p>

  <p>"I want to ask you a favor," Luo Zheng blurted out.</p>

  <p>"Go ahead," the young man said, still smiling faintly. Clearly, he was patient.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng quickly informed him of Yudie's situation.</p>

  <p>"The Life and Death Wind and the Law of Causality," the young man said, his smile becoming more irritating by the second. "I can indeed undo this level of the Law of Causality easily, but... I won't help you out."</p>

  <p>"Why not?" Luo Zheng asked, scowling.</p>

  <p>"Because this too is your fate. I cannot interfere too much with it. So far, we have already violated the rules. You must work hard. As for Yan, I'm taking her away."</p>

  <p>'Yudie's situation is also part of my fate?'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng lowered his head in thought. Suddenly, he felt a pair of small, ice-cold hands cradle his neck. Yan kissed him on the cheek.</p>

  <p>After learning about her and her brother's fate, Yan somehow seemed more sensible than before. Perhaps, she understood it now.</p>

  <p>She knew that her brother had already exhausted far too much of his energy.</p>

  <p>Not wanting to burden Luo Zheng any further, she tried to look optimistic. With a smile, she said, "Luo Zheng, do your best."</p>

  <p>Looking at Yan's confident smile, Luo Zheng understood that she was trying to reassure him. Even though he felt depressed, he smiled and nodded at her. If Yan wanted him to be happy, he must be happy.</p>

  <p>Just as the young man was about to leave with Yan, Owen spoke up. "Can you undo the seal on my girlfriend?"</p>

  <p>His girlfriend's six senses had been sealed. The unsealing would be troublesome and could even potentially be dangerous. If this young man could easily unseal her, it would spare Owen a lot of sorrow. His girlfriend would wake up earlier.</p>

  <p>The young man didn't refuse his request. He didn't want to interfere with Zheng's fate, but that wasn't the case with everyone else. With a casual wave of his hand, the seal on the girl was removed.</p>

  <p>Realizing that his girlfriend was cured in the blink of an eye, Owen gasped with joy. He almost knelt down before the young man.</p>

  <p>That young man didn't respond to this. He just held onto Yan's hand and smiled at Luo Zheng. "Work hard, little guy. Don't let me down," he said.</p>

  <p>A moment later, Yan and the young man disappeared from the Ethereal Spirit Hall. They left in a strange manner; there was no spatial passageway or even a space tearing. There wasn't even a trace of any fluctuation of the Space Law. How did the young man do that?</p>

  <p>After they had left, Luo Zheng stood in the great hall for a long time. Not too far away, Owen's face beamed with joy as he whispered in his lover's ear.</p>

  <p>As a divine-level talent, Owen had faced many twists and turns. Back in the Martial Arts Contest, he had almost died at the hands of Marilyn. Now, his wish had finally been granted. His lover was saved.</p>

  <p>With his divine-level talent, he would certainly be valued highly by the World Commercial Alliance in the future. Now that the impeding danger of the Heavenly Evil Sect had been eliminated, he could become one of the most important men in the World Commercial Alliance with his talent.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng saved his sister on this trip to the Ethereal Spirit Sect, but he still had to bid her farewell. He was in low spirits on his way back.</p>

  <p>The problems with the Heavenly Evil Sect had come to an end.</p>

  <p>The war that had wreaked havoc in more than half of the Central Region had ended.</p>

  <p>However, the crisis was not truly resolved yet. The threat from the York Divine Kingdom was a sharp sword that hung over everyone's heads. And now, this sword could drop at any moment.</p>

  <p>Dillon had known that Luo Zheng was worried about his sister even before the latter headed to the Ethereal Spirit Sect, so he had waited to discuss this matter with Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>With Luo Zheng back at the World Commercial Alliance, Dillon wasted no time in approaching him.</p>

  <p>From Zheng's tone before, Dillon deemed that he had found a way to tackle the situation. However, Dillon couldn't figure out how Luo Zheng planned to deal with the Soul Sea Realm warriors from the York Divine Kingdom.</p>

  <p>Perceiving the worries of Dillon and the others, Luo Zheng smiled. "I have a way to deal with the matter. The connections of the World Commercial Alliance are all over the Central Region. Please help me look for someone extraordinary who would be capable of curing Ning Yudie."</p>

  <p>The confident expression on Zheng's face confused the three leaders of World Commercial Alliance. Previously, fighting Eddie had been difficult enough for him. Why was he so confident about facing the powerful warriors of the Soul Sea Realm? What the hell was Luo Zheng up to?</p>

  <p>Could it be that Luo Zheng had retained his strength and was able to face the powerful warriors of the Soul Sea Realm successfully?</p>

  <p>That was impossible!</p>

  <p>But if so, Luo Zheng wouldn't have just let Eddie use the Life and Death Wind, causing Ning Yudie to confront this fate.</p>

  <p>But what else could explain Zheng's utter confidence?</p>

  <p>The three leaders could not come up with an answer to this question no matter how hard they tried. Luo Zheng had never let them down before. They wondered if he truly had a solution.</p>

  <p>Dillon agreed to it, promising that the World Commercial Alliance would mobilize all their connections to find this one extraordinary person who could come up with a way to save Ning Yudie.</p>
