  <p>
</p>

  <p>As soon as Eric finished speaking, a bald man with a strange pattern on his brain stuck his head out from the fourth floor.</p>

  <p>It was Lambert, the man Eric had spoken to.</p>

  <p>"Young Master," Lambert bowed in respect.</p>

  <p>"Give me the money," Eric said calmly.</p>

  <p>"But..." Lambert glanced at Zheng.</p>

  <p>He was a low-rank True God at the top level, much more powerful than ordinary True Gods.</p>

  <p>It was not that he didn't believe in Eric's strength, but was it really wise to take out five thousand divine might coins at once? After all, five thousand divine might coins was an insanely huge amount of money.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Lambert couldn't shake the feeling that Zheng was much more than he let on. Although Zheng was extremely reserved, Lambert could still feel a faintly discernible soul aura coming from him. It was like an unseen double edged sword, vague and powerful.</p>

  <p>"What?" Eric asked as he looked at his servant.</p>

  <p>Perplexed, Lambert frowned.</p>

  <p>Even though he was a True God, he was still just a guard of the Hulan Clan.</p>

  <p>He'd been serving the young master for years, and therefore knew his temper better than anyone. Right now, Eric had already figured that this warrior had a lot of pride and wouldn't fight. And since he had already thrown the thousand divine might coins, giving up now was out of the question.</p>

  <p>If Lambert upset the young master here, he would surely get punished later.</p>

  <p>Having no choice, Lambert could only grit his teeth as he summoned a small gold silk pouch with a clap of his hands and lightly tossed it to Eric.</p>

  <p>Eric caught the pouch and turned to smile at Zheng. He gently twisted his fingers and untied the pouch.</p>

  <p>Pak! Pak! Pak!</p>

  <p>Instead of metal, the divine might coins were made of some kind of wood and made a crisp sound when they landed on the ground.</p>

  <p>Now, Eric had a total of five thousand divine might coins under his feet.</p>

  <p>"Oh my God!</p>

  <p>It's five thousand divine might coins!</p>

  <p>For many third-tier clans, this is a huge sum of money!"</p>

  <p>"He is so confident in his strength. Let's see what the poor guy is going to do to save his face!"</p>

  <p>The people surrounding them all focused on Zheng. It was Zheng himself who had asked for five thousand divine might coins, and now that Eric had actually taken it out, everyone wondered just how Zheng would escape the fight.</p>

  <p>But what they didn't know was that Zheng had already thought of a way out of all possible scenarios before he opened his mouth.</p>

  <p>He first asked Master Evil about Eric's family. He learned that the Hulan Clan was a second-tier clan in the thirty-six regions, and was considered a huge power to ordinary True Gods. He also learned that they had a good relationship with the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>However, even the Hulan Clan couldn't be autocratic in the Six-Burden Divine City. Even if Zheng offended the clan, he'd still be safe in the city.</p>

  <p>Plus, the Han Clan had always been strict with the clan's jurisdiction.</p>

  <p>After Zheng joined the Heavenly Han House, they had no way to deal with him.</p>

  <p>Moreover, even though five thousand divine might coins was not a small amount, it would only be a small loss for the Hulan Clan.</p>

  <p>After weighing the risks, Zheng had asked to raise the stake to five thousand divine might coins.</p>

  <p>He had decided that five thousand was the most suitable amount. If he asked for a larger number, Eric might not be able to offer it.</p>

  <p>"Here is five thousand divine might coins!" Eric sneered. "Don't even dare to fool me. I'm sure you're aware of the consequences of doing so."</p>

  <p>Deep inside, he wanted to hear what excuses Zheng had come up with.</p>

  <p>Everyone else also felt the same. They were curious if Zheng would really dare to fight.</p>

  <p>Zheng slowly stood from his seat. And just as he started to walk away, the girl who served him earlier rushed up and stopped him. "Wait a minute!"</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?" Zheng asked, surprised.</p>

  <p>"You should pay the bill first," she said stubbornly. She feared Zheng would get killed and his bill would be left unpaid.</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled helplessly at the stubborn look in the girl's eyes. "Sorry, please wait a moment," he told Eric apologetically as he took out some divine might coins and paid his bill.</p>

  <p>After the girl had left, Zheng held a divine might coin in his hand. He smiled at Eric. "If you lose, you can't welsh on the bet."</p>

  <p>"You're delirious if you think I'm backing out," Eric said coldly.</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled and threw the divine might coin into the air. "I accept your challenge!"</p>

  <p>ZOOM!</p>

  <p>As soon as the words left his mouth, the divine might coin stopped midair and shot up into the sky with one of the divine might coins Eric had thrown earlier.</p>

  <p>As a result, the restrictions of the Thousand Commandments Slate in the Six-Burden Divine City were lifted temporarily.</p>

  <p>The instant the divine might coins flew upward, Zheng cocked one eyebrow and his eyes flashed with a golden light.</p>

  <p>A stream of his powerful soul shot towards Eric!</p>

  <p>At the same time, Zheng himself dashed towards Eric like an arrow!</p>

  <p>"Watch out!" Lambert yelled. Even though Zheng had only released a small part of his soul pressure, Lambert was still able to feel how terrifying that power was.</p>

  <p>Zheng's attack had caught Eric off guard. And although his reaction was fast, Zheng's attack had still managed to hit Eric and pierce part of his soul.</p>

  <p>The pain was unbearable, but before Eric could even cry out, Zheng had already slammed into him.</p>

  <p>It was like a mountain was falling on him. He wanted to cry out in pain, but because of Zheng's crushing weight, Eric could only let out a muffled groan before he lost consciousness.</p>

  <p>Crash! Crack!</p>

  <p>Eric was thrown backwards, smashing tables and chairs along the way.</p>

  <p>Some of the proving godly warriors watching their fight were caught and injured as well.</p>

  <p>For a moment, the entire first floor of the Brilliant Moon Restaurant was in chaos.</p>

  <p>Eric lay unmoving on the ground, limbs bent at unnatural angles. No one knew whether he was dead or alive.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the entire Brilliant Moon Restaurant fell silent.</p>

  <p>All of them had been surprised when Zheng readily accepted Eric's challenge.</p>

  <p>However, most of them thought that Zheng was only trying to assert himself and would eventually end up dead by Eric's hand.</p>

  <p>None of them had imagined the battle to end like this.</p>

  <p>Zheng had defeated his opponent with only one hit!</p>

  <p>In one corner, the server girl covered her mouth with a shaking hand as she stared wide-eyed at the young man in front of her.</p>

  <p>Although she was only a divine citizen, she had worked in the Brilliant Moon Restaurant for a long time and had witnessed countless fights before. However, she couldn't remember a lot of people who defeated their opponents with a single hit like Zheng did.</p>

  <p>This only happened when the fight happened between two warriors with great gaps in strength and cultivation levels. However, Zheng was a proving godly warrior while Eric was a powerful warrior from the famous Hulan Clan, so the girl couldn't understand why the outcome was like this.</p>

  <p>Zheng smirked and took out the Great Weighty Sword from his waist. He pulled out the scabbard and began to collect the divine might coins on the ground.</p>

  <p>When he entered the divine land, Zheng's space ring had been destroyed, but the Great Weighty Sword and the sword scabbard were made of divine land items so they remained intact. Now, Zheng used the sword scabbard, which was originally a Sumeru Space, in place of the space ring.</p>

  <p>As Zheng was taking the divine might coins, several people led by Lambert of the Hulan Clan jumped down from the fourth floor of the Brilliant Moon Restaurant.</p>

  <p>"Are you really going to take these divine might coins?" Lambert asked with a frown.</p>

  <p>Zheng straightened his body and asked with a smile, "Why not?"</p>

  <p>"Aren't you afraid of offending our Hulan Clan?" Lambert had become suspicious of Zheng's real identity after witnessing his strength and was now asking Zheng these questions in an effort to sound out his background.</p>

  <p>But Zheng had already figured out his intentions.</p>

  <p>He looked into his eyes fearlessly. "Why should I be afraid?"</p>
