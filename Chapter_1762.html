<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1762 The Nine Dragons Woke Up </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Zheng's heart skipped a beat.</p>

  <p>He did not reveal anything about the nine dragons or the Divine Flame Cauldron to anyone else.</p>

  <p>Master Feng had once mentioned some dragon before, but Zheng had thought that it was more likely to be the Ancestral Dragon. Now, Zheng finally realized that these people seemed to understand him more than he did.</p>

  <p>He was a little depressed, but it wasn't a bad thing for him.</p>

  <p>Moreover, if these Supreme Lords truly wanted to harm him, they wouldn't have taken so many detours.</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled faintly and asserted, "I want to ask for their permission first."</p>

  <p>Master Feng nodded, appearing to be notably patient.</p>

  <p>However, before Zheng could utter his question to the cyan dragon, the latter's voice had already rung out.</p>

  <p>"It's time. Our eldest brother has been in a deep sleep for too many years.</p>

  <p>I thought that we'd have to return to the Genuine Dragon World before he'd have the chance to wake up," the cyan dragon remarked unhurriedly.</p>

  <p>"How did the Celestial Position race know about your existence?" Zheng probed curiously.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon kept silent for a moment and then explained, "They are the pawns set up by the Holy Being's disciples, and we Genuine Dragons are the contractual beasts of the Holy Being. They know of our existence, and this is not strange."</p>

  <p>The Genuine Dragons were all contractual beasts of the Holy Being?</p>

  <p>Then wouldn't the entire Genuine Dragon World be a gigantic spirit beast bag?</p>

  <p>Zheng was silent as his thoughts ran wild about his calculated guess.</p>

  <p>Though this conjecture was somewhat uncertain, the most unreliable matter had already happened. With such a massive universe being the inner world of the Holy Being, it was understandable for the Genuine Dragon World, an independent supreme world, to be a spirit beast bag of the Holy Being.</p>

  <p>Just what kind of creature was this Holy Being? Zheng helplessly sighed in his heart, feeling more bewildered than ever.</p>

  <p>The more he knew, the stranger the universe became. Nothing was like what he saw on the surface. Realizing that this distracted him as he delved deeper, he stayed calm.</p>

  <p>Under the watchful eyes of everyone, Zheng made his way to the crystal coffins.</p>

  <p>Solemnity was written all over Master Feng's face. The soul essences in these crystal coffins were still active; they were from vicious beasts and legendary beasts. Over the years, the Celestial Position race hunted them.</p>

  <p>And releasing them now would only mean that the risk of getting Zheng's soul completely devoured was of high probability.</p>

  <p>The value of these soul essences was even hard to estimate. Even the leaders of the great powers, such as Supreme Lord of Oracle and Supreme Lord of Original Sin, revealed an expression of interest when they learned such a large number of soul essences. The Celestial Position race had hunted down such a large number of soul essences in the universe all these years. They had this strong belief that humans' three significant forces were nothing compared to the race.</p>

  <p>"Relax a little. I will wipe out the souls within these soul essences."</p>

  <p>As soon as Master Feng uttered his last few words, he gently stretched out two of his oddly long fingers and pried open a corner of one of the crystal coffins.</p>

  <p>The moment this crystal coffin popped open, all sorts of ghostly wails and wolfish howls reverberated, the sounds coming out from within it. A swelling aura then surged out from the coffin and rushed towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>Once the soul inside a soul essence was removed, the soul essence would gradually dry up and turn into a soul crystal. Although the soul crystals were beneficial to warriors' souls, the effect was significantly reduced.</p>

  <p>The Celestial Position members had been feeding these soul essences after obtaining them.</p>

  <p>The second the soul essences surged out, Master Feng's eyes flashed, and a jade ruler suddenly appeared between his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>The Pure Jade Ruler was Master Feng's own lifeblood treasure.</p>

  <p>After this jade ruler became visible, it suddenly swung towards the soul essences.</p>

  <p>Every wave of the jade ruler was accompanied by a sharp howl. Even if there was only a single soul, it did not wish to be completely wiped out.</p>

  <p>However, facing Master Feng, these souls had no chance of resisting.</p>

  <p>Under the control of Master Feng, the erased soul essences turned into rays of soft orange light and flew towards Zheng's head, instantly entering his mind.</p>

  <p>Pouring soul essences into a warrior's mind was originally a method to train the soul.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, this kind of cultivation method was way too extravagant for many cultivators.</p>

  <p>At any rate, a single Supreme Lord would find it difficult to collect so many soul essences. It had taken countless years for the Celestial Position race to accumulate soul essences, and just raising the soul essences alone equated to overly huge consumption.</p>

  <p>After the soul essences entered his body, they turned into a stream of fresh spring water and gently flowed into the depths of Zheng's soul.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>This stream of spring water continued to expand, finally flowing to the side of the Divine Flame Cauldron.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon's huge dragon head suddenly let out a strange roar. The spring water formed from the soul essences instantly split into nine strands and poured into the nine Genuine Dragons.</p>

  <p>These nine Genuine Dragons required plenty of soul essences.</p>

  <p>However, the Celestial Position race was well-prepared. Soon after the first crystal coffin's soul essences were devoured, Master Feng did not waste time in opening the second coffin, then the third one, then the fourth...</p>

  <p>As the soul essences continued to be poured in, the nine Genuine Dragons that were hovering around the Divine Flame Cauldron also revealed their distinct colors.</p>

  <p>Cyan, red, blue, white, purple, black, and yellow.</p>

  <p>And for a time, the Genuine Dragons occupying the surface of the Divine Flame Cauldron magnificently emitted several splendid, dazzling lights.</p>

  <p>The most eye-catching of them all was the golden Genuine Dragon in the center.</p>

  <p>When the soul essences from the ten crystal coffins had all been poured into Zheng's mind, a faint dragon roar suddenly resounded in his mind.</p>

  <p>This dragon roar immensely contained a boundless emotion that spread out from Zheng's mind and graciously filled the entire cave.</p>

  <p>Hearing the sound of this rare dragon roar, the Supreme Lords were all stirred up.</p>

  <p>Tianming and the rest of the spectators were looking at Zheng with astonished expressions. There was a faint trace of fear in their eyes.</p>

  <p>This dragon roar originated from the Five-clawed Golden Dragon situated atop the Divine Flame Cauldron. It was the most powerful bloodline within the clan and also possessed a unique inheritance.</p>

  <p>Roar!</p>

  <p>Roar!</p>

  <p>Roar...</p>

  <p>The remaining other eight Genuine Dragons also roared simultaneously as if on cue.</p>

  <p>For the longest time, the nine Genuine Dragons had been trapped on the Divine Flame Cauldron. Now under the leadership of their eldest brother, they wantonly began emitting their own intense emotions.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>At this instant, the souls of these Genuine Dragons had been peeled off from the Divine Flame Cauldron one by one. Then they abruptly transformed into illusionary figures that fled out of Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>A Genuine Dragon's body was incomparably big. At this time, however, they reduced their body size many times, eventually disclosing themselves in miniature sizes.</p>

  <p>Subsequently, the nine Genuine Dragons swirled around Zheng, baring their fangs and brandishing their claws as they meticulously scanned the surroundings. Their eyes contained various emotions, such as confusion, lament, dignity, and caution.</p>

  <p>Although there were only nine Genuine Dragon souls, many Supreme Lords were already on their guard. This sort of alertness came from their instincts.</p>

  <p>The strongest of them, the Five-clawed Golden Dragon, naturally coiled himself around Zheng's neck. His pair of golden dragon claws clasped Zheng's shoulders, while his head leaned forward as he stared at Master Feng. "Your body has Harold's scent."</p>

  <p>Master Feng nodded. "The blood in our bodies hailed from Harold's bloodline."</p>

  <p>Roar! "Very good. Harold's plan has finally worked," the Five-clawed Golden Dragon exclaimed.</p>

  <p>However, Master Feng shook his head. "Not enough. Our opponents are much stronger than we imagined. This battle is only the prelude. We can only take one step if we win. However, if we make a small mistake, then we will seriously lose."</p>

  <p>"We don't have a choice," the Five-clawed Golden Dragon said flatly.</p>

  <p>"That's right, we have no choice..." Master Feng looked indifferent. No matter how tough and arduous it was for them, they could only bite the bullet and continue onward. As the saying went, "Man proposes, God disposes."</p>

  <p>"Hold on..."</p>

  <p>At this moment, the silent Supreme Lord Mathias suddenly spoke up. "It sounds as if we were innocently dragged into this crisis? This crisis was brought about by your Celestial Position race. Why do we, ogres, have to participate in it?"</p>

  <p>As Supreme Lord Mathias spoke, the other Supreme Lords of the other races also wore the same expressions of deep agreement.</p>

  <p>Summoning the leaders of the big races was the right decision made by Celestial Position to face the biggest crisis in the universe.</p>

  <p>But from the looks of it, this crisis was caused by Celestial Position race.</p>

  <p>What did the trouble that the Celestial Position race had caused have to do with them?</p>

  <p>Roar! The Five-clawed Golden Dragon roared. His golden eyes stared at Supreme Lord Mathias and he insisted, "You also have no choice! Those who cannot jump out of the heavens cannot choose. If the universe is destroyed, then all of you will turn into life vitality in the end. Think about what will happen to those living beings in your inner world. Ha-ha!"</p>

  <p>If a Supreme Lord perished, the inner world within his or her body would also collapse, and everything within the inner world would once again become the vitality of heaven and earth.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords were the creatures of the inner world of the Holy Being. If the universe collapsed, they would be unable to cross the heavens and escape its shackles. Then, they would be reduced to the vitality of heaven and earth and later on disappear.</p>
