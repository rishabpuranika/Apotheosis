<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 34 Invisible Pressure (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Paved with ordinary limestone slabs and decorated with neatly trimmed verdant grass on both sides, it looked like any other road in the empire. The road turned and twisted, stretching away as far as the eye could see.</p>

  <p>Participants who had registered for the initial exam seemed pretty confident and relaxed as they stood in line. Refining had strengthened their body, so for them, running was child's play. Most of them were quite sure that they would breeze through the exam.</p>

  <p>The white-bearded old man gave a signal, and the exam began.</p>

  <p>All candidates broke into a run. Just then something strange happened. The lead runners stumbled and sank to the ground, making a perfect pratfall.</p>

  <p>Only a few people reacted quickly enough to recover their balance. They pulled themselves together and carried on running forward.</p>

  <p>This incident gave the others an indication that there was something unusual about this road. They were more careful where they set foot on the road. Although no one else fell, since the candidates were being careful, their speed reduced. It looked as if they were carrying a thousand pounds of weight.</p>

  <p>After the first few batches set off on the road, it was Zheng's turn.</p>

  <p>He approached the edge of the square and stepped out slowly. Instantly he felt an invisible pressure. As he tried to lift his foot, he found that his legs felt leaden.</p>

  <p>It was an odd feeling.</p>

  <p>Once he had stepped on to the road, the pressure encased him completely.</p>

  <p>Every inch of his skin felt weighed down. Even his eardrums throbbed!</p>

  <p>Although the road seemed normal, the air pressure seemed much higher.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng had entered the organ refining level, he was able to control his breathing. With enough food to supply his body with energy, he could easily run for ten days.</p>

  <p>But the high air pressure made this simple task seem daunting. The running would wear him out quickly. He wasn't sure how long he would last. Since he had lit up two dragon scales and his body had been refined, Luo Zheng felt as though there was no reason for him not to get a good mark.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng steadied his breathing, then with a light cry he mustered every ounce of strength, tightened every muscle against the pressure, and ran forward.</p>

  <p>Many of the participants had adjusted to the pressure almost instantly. They continued to run at a brisk pace as if the pressure didn't affect them at all.</p>

  <p>But most participants were unable to continue.</p>

  <p>Participants at the bone refining level ran out of strength after only three hundred feet. As their bodies gave up, they fell on the road. They were so exhausted that even raising their heads had become an effort.</p>

  <p>Even though some continued to run, they were panting and staggering. The effort to maintain their pace against the invisible pressure was clearly visible. It appeared as though they would drop at any moment.</p>

  <p>After having run for seven or eight miles, Luo Zheng noticed that some participants began to drop back as time wore on, and the crowd gradually thinned into a line.</p>

  <p>He concentrated on his steps. Then he adjusted his breathing to tune up his body as this was the only way to stay in a condition to cover a longer distance.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked over his shoulder when he heard someone call his name. A silk-robed boy waved to him. It was Nory, the boy he had met the day before.</p>

  <p>His attire was more suitable to the challenge today as compared with yesterday.</p>

  <p>"Hi, Nory!" Luo Zheng replied with a smile.</p>

  <p>"You are doing well!" Nory gasped. "Impressive! Even though you are running under such high pressure, you look as if you are sauntering in your backyard."</p>

  <p>"You are not doing so bad yourself. If I'm not mistaken, you are only at the bone refining level. Not many at your level can keep up with the challenge," Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>The pressure had proved to be demanding for people at the bone refining level. However, participants at the organ and marrow refining levels were easily able to rise above it.</p>

  <p>It was amazing that Nory could stay at the front of the line.</p>

  <p>Nory pulled a face and raised his hand. He showed Luo Zheng a bangle around his wrist. "Last time, I didn't even make one mile in the initial exam. Now, thanks to this bangle, I can run this far. It helps me counteract half the pressure."</p>

  <p>"Bangle?" Luo Zheng glanced at the accessory on Nory's wrist. It looked rather unimpressive as it appeared to be a plain gold bangle. Who could have guessed that it could counteract the invisible pressure?</p>

  <p>"It must be a mysterious weapon, right?" Luo Zheng blinked at Nory as he asked.</p>

  <p>Nory grinned, "Yes. It is a mysterious weapon. It cost me two cubic crystals, almost all my savings."</p>

  <p>"Two cubic crystals? That's all? Is a mysterious weapon that cheap?" Luo Zheng asked incredulously. If what Nory had said was true then he could buy dozens of mysterious weapons, considering that he had hundreds of cubic crystals lying in his space ring.</p>

  <p>"Nah, you misunderstood me," Nory added quickly, "The rent is two cubic crystals. After I pass the exam, I will have to return the bangle."</p>
