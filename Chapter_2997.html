  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Evil God was slightly taken aback by the things he found in the True God's memories.</p>

  <p>'His head is full of crazy nonsense!' he thought, his face flushing with anger.</p>

  <p>He didn't inherently have any morals. Rather, he was fierce and arrogant, like a tyrant.</p>

  <p>However, there was one thing he cared about the most— the human race. Of course, this was probably because of Zheng's influence.</p>

  <p>In Zheng's inner world, there had been the rise of other races, such as the Heavenly Spirit race. However, with Zheng's deliberate suppression and the rise of the human race, the Heavenly Spirit race had gradually been marginalized. In the end, the Evil God had even killed the warriors of the Heavenly Spirit race for the sake of the human race.</p>

  <p>In any case, the Evil God didn't like other races.</p>

  <p>As he continued to look through the True God's memories, he found out about the existence of Sand Country. Soon, he learned about how the people from Sand Country were obedient to the Man-eating Demon Flowers and how a great number of people from the country were sacrificed to the Man-eating Demon Flowers every year.</p>

  <p>'How could the human race submit to plants? Humph! Once I'm strong enough, I'll get rid of these man-eating flowers one by one!' the Evil God thought to himself.</p>

  <p>Then, he found something else in the man's memories that surprised him.</p>

  <p>'The Truth of Godly Way? The Other Shore Realm?'</p>

  <p>When the Evil God had left Zheng's inner world, he had felt a special aura exuding from Zheng that he had never felt before.</p>

  <p>Back then, he had been so eager to rid himself of Zheng's control that he hadn't had the time to ask about the origin of that aura.</p>

  <p>Now, he finally realized that the consummation of True God Realm and the grasp of mixed internal momentum were not the peak of cultivation. If he wanted to become stronger, he would have to reach the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>As an ambitious warrior, the Evil God was thrilled at this realization.</p>

  <p>He laughed wildly for a long time, as if he had lost his mind. Then, he tossed the man from the Sand Country to the ground. The man's soul had been shattered into pieces, leaving him no more than a shell of his original self.</p>

  <p>The Evil God slowly walked toward the desert.</p>

  <p>Although he had found a method to get rid of the sandstorm, he didn't intend to go deep into the desert, because that was where the extremely powerful Man-eating Demon Flowers lurked.</p>

  <p>Despite his arrogance, the Evil God didn't carry any silly notions of being a match for the Man-eating Demon Flowers. He was well aware that if he continued to go toward the depths of the desert, he would undoubtedly be courting death.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, he had found another way to cross the desert in the True God's memories. As long as he traveled along the middle line of the desert, he would be safe. There was another big port at the end of the desert through which he would be able to go deep into the world.</p>

  <p>Three days later, the cyan flying ship that Zheng was traveling in arrived at the border of the Gracious Province. The huge boundary wall stood in front of it, like a gigantic piece of green and cyan glass.</p>

  <p>'The Space Law in this boundary wall is so profound and solid, ' Zheng noted, narrowing his eyes in surprise.</p>

  <p>Boundary walls existed at the border of every great world and universe, with the exception of the various regions in the divine land. Of course, even the divine land had an extremely solid space barrier in its outer layer. That space barrier was so thick that even the combined force of Emily and other warriors wouldn't be able to break it.</p>

  <p>But to Zheng's surprise, the boundary wall in front of him now looked even stronger than the space barrier in the outer layer of the divine land. He wondered how the warriors from the Sword Light Palace intended to pass through it.</p>

  <p>But soon, he realized that he had been worrying about nothing.</p>

  <p>One of the men inside the cyan flying ship lightly jumped into the air and thrust his palm toward the wall.</p>

  <p>A ripple spread out on the surface of the solid wall, and then a complicated golden Sanskrit word appeared.</p>

  <p>When Zheng saw the golden Sanskrit word, his eyebrows arched up. Although all golden Sanskrit words looked similar, some of them had relatively simple structures while others had extremely complicated ones. The golden Sanskrit word in front of him looked somewhat similar to the golden Sanskrit words in his inner world.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, it disappeared before he could commit it to his memory.</p>

  <p>The man who had thrust his palm toward the wall returned to the flying ship and whispered something to two other people. Soon, the air in the cyan flying ship fluctuated and a huge array formed like an umbrella.</p>

  <p>As the light in the array flew, a huge Sanskrit word similar to the one on the wall appeared.</p>

  <p>With that, the flying ship advanced. Zheng braced himself for impact, but to his surprise, the ship smoothly flew through the thick wall as if it hadn't encountered any obstruction at all.</p>

  <p>Kenelm and the rest of his group raised their heads to look around, their faces filled with curiosity. Although they were aware of the existence of boundary walls, they had never left this big province before in their lives.</p>

  <p>"The array was acknowledged by the boundary wall. Unbelievable!" Zheng said in amazement.</p>

  <p>The boundary wall was about ten thousand feet thick, and the flying ship took five minutes to completely pass through the wall. When it finally came out from the other side of the wall, a fit of fresh air greeted everyone.</p>

  <p>The sky ahead of them was a green color, and the whole atmosphere seemed vigorous. This was the Seven-Star Province where the Sword Light Palace was located.</p>

  <p>Zoom!</p>

  <p>As the flying ship sped up again, the surrounding scenery became blurry once more.</p>

  <p>Two hours later, when the cyan flying ship slowed to a stop, the people from Excellence City rose to their feet and looked down at the scenery below.</p>

  <p>"This is the legendary Sword Light Palace!"</p>

  <p>"The Lofty Sword! That is the Lofty Sword!"</p>

  <p>"A warrior can comprehend the Truth of Godly Way with half the effort if they do it in front of the Lofty Sword!"</p>

  <p>Seeing the landmark building of the Sword Light Palace, Kenelm and his group were very excited.</p>

  <p>The Seven-Star Province was a huge city built on a mountain. In the center of the city stood a gigantic sword that was seven hundred thousand feet long!</p>

  <p>Even from such a long distance, Zheng could feel the strong Truth of Godly Way exuded by this stone sword.</p>

  <p>'I'm afraid only a Wild God would be able to wield such a huge sword. But isn't it said that there are no more Wild Gods in the Source World? Then what is the use of this huge sword?' Zheng wondered.</p>

  <p>As the flying ship descended, the Lofty Sword disappeared from everyone's vision. Finally, the ship landed on a platform in the middle of the mountain city.</p>

  <p>The pale-faced woman jumped up first and landed on the rails of the ship.</p>

  <p>She looked at Kenelm and his companions, and then glanced at Zheng with a meaningful look in her eyes. "Galeun, lead them to Sword Dance Palace," she said before rushing into the mountain city.</p>

  <p>"Just follow me," said the man named Galeun Yu.</p>

  <p>Led by Galeun Yu, the group walked through the densely packed buildings in the mountain city and finally arrived at Sword Dance Palace.</p>

  <p>When they arrived at the gate, another two men in cyan slowly walked toward them and bowed to Galeun Yu.</p>

  <p>"These eleven people found a tomb, so Master Laura made an exception to allow them to join Sword Dance Palace," said Galeun Yu.</p>

  <p>The two men in cyan nodded and led the eleven of them into Sword Dance Palace.</p>

  <p>Just when they entered the palace with great expectations, a rough laugh sounded. "Oh, look, what do we have here? Another dozen dregs in our palace. Never mind. Sword Dance Palace has long become a place for trash.</p>

  <p>I don't mind taking in more garbage. I hope you can hold on in here long enough."</p>
