  <p>
</p>

  <p>Weapon Pavilion was the largest shop in the mart.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng knew that real treasures and rare weapons might not appear in such a big shop. However, his goal was not to find rare spiritual weapons.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng intended to buy mysterious weapons.</p>

  <p>He believed that the Weapon Pavilion would stock many mysterious weapons.</p>

  <p>After stepping into the Weapon Pavilion, Luo Luo Zheng saw a variety of weapons.</p>

  <p>There were golden axes, emerald spears, blood-red greatswords, and so on.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng glanced at the weapons, he found that they were low-grade mysterious weapons.</p>

  <p>The business at the Weapon Pavilion seemed very good. Many people shuttled in and out, and dozens of waiters wearing yellow coats were busy greeting customers.</p>

  <p>After hanging out for a while, Luo Luo Zheng wanted to speak with a waiter about the weapons, but no one approached him.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the reason for this strange behavior was that the waiters saw Luo Luo Zheng wearing a white robe, which was characteristic of a Cloud Sect outer disciple. All of the workers in the mart could tell that the outer disciples had only recently joined Cloud Sect. Even if they earned some bonuses from the sect, they had to use their cubic crystals for cultivation. Thus, no waiter paid attention to Luo Luo Zheng as they didn't think he could afford much.</p>

  <p>After waiting for a long time, Luo Luo Zheng noticed that a waiter was free. The man reluctantly walked up to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Sir, what weapons do you want to buy? We have various kinds of weapons. As long as you tell me what you want, I can find it for you,"  said the waiter fluently.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded and said, "I have noticed that you only have low-grade mysterious weapons on display. Could you please tell me where the top-grade mysterious weapons are placed?"</p>

  <p>"Top-grade mysterious weapons?" questioned the waiter as he studied Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Although the waiter assumed that Luo Luo Zheng was perhaps not wealthy enough to afford a top-grade mysterious weapon, he still wanted to take a chance. Sometimes, children from noble clans dressed as though they were poor. The waiter did not want to miss potential business based on an assumption.</p>

  <p>Thus, the waiter smiled warmly and said, "Sir, our top-grade mysterious weapons are not exhibited here. If you want to buy some, I'll take you to another room. This way please!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded and followed the waiter to the depths of the Weapon Pavilion.</p>

  <p>The inner space of the Weapon Pavilion was huge! As Luo Luo Zheng walked deeper, he came across many mid-grade mysterious weapons. Soon these were replaced by top-grade ones.</p>

  <p>"Sir, this is our collection of top-grade mysterious weapons. Each of them is of superior quality!" introduced the waiter proudly, as he led Luo Luo Zheng into a big room.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes wandered along the counters. At a glance, he could not tell whether these weapons were remarkable or not.</p>

  <p>There might be a massive difference in quality between any two top-grade mysterious weapons.</p>

  <p>For example, the weapons that Luo Luo Zheng grabbed from Evil Lan produced only five or six drops of heavenly essence when melted.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng procured fifteen drops of essence from the two short halberds that he took after slaying White Fiend and Black Fiend.</p>

  <p>According to Luo Zheng's observation, these weapons did not appear to be superior.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, if a single one of these weapons could produce five drops of essence when melted, Luo Luo Zheng would be very satisfied.</p>

  <p>"How many top-grade mysterious weapons do you have now?" inquired Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Hearing Luo Zheng's question, the waiter was a bit confused about why he cared about how many top-grade mysterious weapons were in the Weapon Pavilion.</p>

  <p>The waiter pulled out a record book and told Luo Luo Zheng, "We have thirty-two swords, eighteen hammers, twenty-six sabers, and other types of top-grade mysterious weapons that number to over a hundred. In total, we have two hundred and twenty-three."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>While each of these top-grade mysterious weapons had a different price, on average, one could be sold for a hundred cubic crystals.</p>

  <p>"Sir, which one would you like?" asked the waiter patiently.</p>

  <p>"I want all of them," replied Luo Luo Zheng calmly.</p>

  <p>"Pardon me?" exclaimed the waiter.</p>

  <p>The average monthly salary of a waiter was low. A considerable part of the salary came from the mysterious weapons that they sold.</p>

  <p>Therefore, each waiter naturally hoped to sell a substantial number of weapons each month.</p>

  <p>Usually, ordinary people only bought one or two mysterious weapons for themselves.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng had said that he wanted to buy all the top-grade mysterious weapons. 'What a crazy idea, ' thought the waiter.</p>

  <p>"Sir, you are kidding, right? Do you know how much it will cost to buy all of these top-grade mysterious weapons?" asked the waiter. His warm smile was replaced with a sullen expression when he thought that he was dealing with a madman.</p>

  <p>"If each costs one hundred cubic crystals on average, I will spend more than twenty thousand crystals, am I right?" said Luo Luo Zheng with a smile.</p>

  <p>Twenty thousand cubic crystals? Even to the Weapon Pavilion, this was pretty big business.</p>

  <p>The majority of customers that came to the Weapon Pavilion sought low and mid-grade mysterious weapons. Thus, a monthly transaction could amount to over ten thousand cubic crystals.</p>

  <p>"Twenty thousand cubic crystals! Can you show me now? If not, you'd better get out of my sight!" The waiter was livid. As he had seen that no one was serving Luo Luo Zheng, with the best of intentions, he had come to help.</p>

  <p>However, he didn't expect to waste his time.</p>

  <p>"What? Don't you want to sell? Or, aren't you qualified to make decisions? Maybe I should find someone else to serve me," said Luo Luo Zheng as he lifted a sword in his hands and began to stroke it.</p>

  <p>"You can go and find whoever you would like to help you!" mumbled the waiter coldly before turning around and walking away.</p>

  <p>With a smile playing at the corners of his mouth, Luo Luo Zheng stepped toward the end of the counter, where a middle-aged man in brown clothes was doing the accounts.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me. Are you in charge here?" asked Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The middle-aged man glanced at Luo Luo Zheng before asking, "Sir, Can I help you?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng pulled out the token given by Wurth Zhang before saying, "I want to buy a batch of top-grade mysterious weapons."</p>

  <p>When the middle-aged man had noticed the white robe worn by Luo Luo Zheng, he thought the boy was an ordinary customer.</p>

  <p>But when he saw the token in Luo Zheng's hands, his expression changed.</p>

  <p>The man was familiar with the token, even more than Luo Luo Zheng was.</p>

  <p>Blessed Draft Bank had four colors of tokens. Each token color, be it purple, white, green, or golden, represented a value.</p>

  <p>While the purple token was the most common, the golden token was the most honorable.</p>

  <p>The token in Luo Zheng's hands was golden.</p>

  <p>Even if there were no cubic crystals in the token, Luo Luo Zheng could borrow ten thousand cubic crystals from any sub-branch of the Blessed Draft Bank.</p>

  <p>As far as the man knew, only about one thousand people had enough wealth to be given a golden token.</p>

  <p>The man instantly realized that he had met a noble customer. He stepped out from behind the counter and politely said, "Sir, what do you want to buy? Other than these mysterious weapons, we have several spiritual weapons on the second floor for sale. Let me take you to them, please!"</p>

  <p>"No, thanks!" Luo Luo Zheng politely declined. Then he pointed at the row of top-grade mysterious weapons and said, "I want to buy some top-grade mysterious weapons."</p>

  <p>"Oh, okay!" said the man as slight disappointment flashed in his eyes. In his mind, a customer with a golden token from the Blessed Draft Bank could afford to buy a weapon of more value. However, he dared not to say anything to offend Luo Luo Zheng. Perhaps in the future, Luo Luo Zheng would bring them more business. The man smiled warmly and asked, "Sir, which one do you like?"</p>

  <p>"This, this, and this one," said Luo Luo Zheng, while pointing at three weapons.</p>

  <p>"You want these three? Okay, I'll get someone to pack them for you, sir!" said the middle-aged man.</p>

  <p>"Not yet. Aside from these three, I want to buy the other two hundred and twenty weapons that you have in stock... Please pack them all," said Luo Luo Zheng with a quick smile.</p>

  <p>"..."</p>

  <p>The middle-aged man stood rooted to the spot. Luo Zheng's request was so unusual that he was rendered speechless.</p>

  <p>As a shopkeeper In the Weapon Pavilion for so many years, he had served all kinds of customers.</p>

  <p>However, this was the first time that he met a crazy boy who was spending money like water.</p>

  <p>"You're not kidding, are you?" The middle-aged man asked cautiously. If he had not seen Luo Zheng's golden token from the Blessed Draft Bank, he would have instructed someone to drive Luo Luo Zheng out.</p>

  <p>The shopkeeper knew that Luo Luo Zheng was able to buy all the weapons.</p>

  <p>"I am not joking. Now that I am buying so many weapons at one time, will you give me a discount?" asked Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Discount! Of course, I'll give you a discount!" said the shopkeeper with excitement. Now, the shopkeeper was convinced that Luo Luo Zheng intended to buy two hundred and twenty top-grade mysterious weapons, though he didn't know why Luo Luo Zheng was buying so many weapons.</p>

  <p>"Guys, get over here!" the middle-aged shopkeeper ordered the waiters.</p>

  <p>Once eight waiters had gathered around, the shopkeeper said, "Wrap all these top-grade mysterious weapons for our exalted guest!"</p>

  <p>Hearing the shopkeeper's order, the waiters began to take the weapons out of the showcases.</p>

  <p>The previous waiter who had served Luo Luo Zheng was stunned. His eyes widened when he heard the shopkeeper's command.</p>

  <p>At the moment, he was genuinely remorseful.</p>

  <p>He had thought Luo Luo Zheng was a madman who had deliberately annoyed him.</p>

  <p>He didn't expect that Luo Luo Zheng really wanted to buy all the top-grade mysterious weapons.</p>

  <p>To a large extent, his salary depended on the sales of mysterious weapons.</p>

  <p>The commission for selling a top-grade mysterious weapon was equivalent to several months' salary.</p>

  <p>If he had taken Luo Luo Zheng seriously, he would not have to work for the rest of his life!</p>

  <p>But what had been the waiter's attitude toward Luo Luo Zheng?</p>

  <p>Thinking of his stupid behavior, the waiter could only silently curse himself.</p>
