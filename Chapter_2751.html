  <p>
</p>

  <p>The tall space door didn't budge.</p>

  <p>"How can this be?" Leland muttered gloomily.</p>

  <p>The strange fish shuttled back and forth in the door of space, making rattling noises.</p>

  <p>If the Space Law wasn't supporting the door, it would be just an ordinary door. How would it react when the strange fish shuttled back and forth like that?</p>

  <p>"The fiend race has probably sealed the door of space," Zheng said, frowning.</p>

  <p>The alliance of the powerful clans had taken action, but the fiend race must have been preparing for this eventuality for a long time. The moment the Holy Beings entered the sixth stage, the fiends cut off their route of retreat.</p>

  <p>Zheng's route of retreat was also destroyed.</p>

  <p>"What should we do? Can this door of space be reset?" Leland asked.</p>

  <p>Zheng looked at the door of space and saw that countless, complex array textures had gathered around the door frame.</p>

  <p>The Space Law was prohibited in the Abyss Demon Region. It must have taken the fiend race a lot of effort to build a space channel like this. And now that they had cut it off, they couldn't recover it in such a short span of time.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid it can't," Zheng said.</p>

  <p>Leland and the several other True Gods weren't worrying as much. In fact, as long as the alliance of the powerful clans defeated the fiend race, they wouldn't find themselves in any kind of a dilemma.</p>

  <p>But Zheng was different.</p>

  <p>No matter which side won the battle, he would not have the most ideal of endings.</p>

  <p>Zheng was deep in thought when Rachelle's clear voice rang out.</p>

  <p>"Zheng wants to escape from the Abyss Demon Region!"</p>

  <p>Chaos reigned as the Holy Beings fought the fiends.</p>

  <p>But Rachelle's voice, which was filled with life vitality, clearly reached the ears of everyone in the Desperation Plain.</p>

  <p>Rachelle thought that it wasn't difficult to win the battle. Only one Holy Being or Demi-holy Being was enough to stop Zheng. Zheng was too crucial, even more crucial than the Abyss Demon Region. So she decided to spread the news of his presence at this critical moment.</p>

  <p>"Zheng? How could he be here?" Tianming was stunned.</p>

  <p>Even the alliance of powerful clans had paid a heavy price to enter the Abyss Demon Region, resulting in the death of several Demi-holy Beings and consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>How could Zheng explore the forbidden area alone?</p>

  <p>Had Zheng followed the Holy Beings all along? But this sounded even more impossible! The spiritual sense of the Holy Beings was very powerful. He couldn't have followed them for so long without being discovered.</p>

  <p>But when Tianming turned to look, he was shocked to find Zheng standing under the door of space.</p>

  <p>Samuel turned to look, too, and his gaze fell on Zheng, doubt shuttering his eyes.</p>

  <p>Like Tianming, he was also puzzled at Zheng's presence.</p>

  <p>This confusion remained for just three seconds before a brilliant light flashed through his eyes.</p>

  <p>Among the Holy Beings, only Samuel knew the secret of the Reincarnation Land.</p>

  <p>Since Zheng had not followed them into the Abyss Demon Region, he could only enter through a different entrance. That entrance was the Reincarnation Land.</p>

  <p>After all, years ago, Samuel had also left through the Reincarnation Land.</p>

  <p>'I've arranged everything in the Reincarnation Land. Even if Zheng has found the Stone Mouse and entered it, he would definitely die. But how did he leave that place?' Samuel thought, with worry and killing intent in his heart.</p>

  <p>'This guy has to die!'</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>A gigantic fiend commander came smashing towards Samuel, an axe on his shoulder.</p>

  <p>The fiend's skin shone with a chaotic red light.</p>

  <p>His strength was close to that of a Demi-holy Being at the top level. But under the violent red light, he even had the power to fight a Holy Being.</p>

  <p>Since they were matched in strength, the previous fight between Samuel and the fiend commander lasted for dozens of rounds.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Samuel was distracted from the battle, the fiend commander used all his strength to kill Samuel with one blow.</p>

  <p>But Samuel sensed the attack and raised his hand to shield himself.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>So when the huge axe came crashing towards him, he managed to stop it with his bare hand.</p>

  <p>The fiend commander was dumbfounded, his huge eyes filled with disbelief.</p>

  <p>"Crack, crack, crack..."</p>

  <p>A tiny crack appeared on the blade of the huge axe and spread throughout its length.</p>

  <p>The huge axe shattered into pieces, having been blocked by Samuel.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>Samuel's eyes narrowed as he pulled out his sword and flew to attack the fiend commander.</p>

  <p>The fiend commander was smart and knew that the strength of this Holy Being was far beyond his imagination.</p>

  <p>He now understood why this Holy Being hadn't taken him too seriously before.</p>

  <p>As Samuel approached, the fiend, with the huge body, jumped up and flew into the air, wanting to escape.</p>

  <p>But he was much slower than Samuel. He had only flown for a few seconds when he felt a chill emanating from his belly.</p>

  <p>A voice rang out.</p>

  <p>"One destructive sword attack can break heaven and earth!"</p>

  <p>There was a hint of Truth of Godly Way hidden in this sword strike.</p>

  <p>The fiend's body, which was four thousand feet tall, was now cut in half, leaving him no chance to fight back.</p>

  <p>Samuel had made every effort to join the alliance of powerful clans, not just to help Nicholas take control of the Abyss Demon Region. What was more, if he performed so formidably all the time, Nicholas would be cautious about him.</p>

  <p>He hadn't been trying his best when he had fought the fiend commander earlier.</p>

  <p>But now, things were different. He had to catch Zheng first!</p>

  <p>Samuel had just turned to head straight for Zheng when a mighty roar sounded from behind him.</p>

  <p>A figure made its way over to him, shrouded in a bright, strong light.</p>

  <p>At the same time, a huge pit appeared on the plain.</p>

  <p>Nicholas was standing in the pit. He had just withstood Gallio's attack and his clothes were muddy and torn. But his eyes were full of fighting spirit.</p>

  <p>He looked at Samuel and said, "Samuel, your strength is extraordinary, and it's difficult to deal with these fiend commanders. I need your help!"</p>

  <p>The moment Nicholas finished talking, he turned into a gust of wind and headed for Gallio at the end of the Desperation Plain.</p>

  <p>"Such a foxy guy!" Samuel muttered furiously.</p>

  <p>He knew that Nicholas was alert to him. But now, Nicholas, Clark, and Murphy had to deal with Gallio without distractions. This meant it was a great opportunity for him.</p>

  <p>However, it was obvious that Nicholas wanted Samuel to stay at the battlefield.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Zheng was already running towards the left side of the Desperation Plain, Samuel hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Catch him!"</p>

  <p>Liusu, Aleyna, and Pascal were also fighting fiercely with the Abyss Demons. They seemed to be one when they worked together and so in tandem.</p>

  <p>The three of them had just become consummate True Gods, but their powers were far beyond that of a consummate True God.</p>

  <p>But now, the three of them stopped suddenly and stared at the place where Zheng was running off. They looked at each other, a look of understanding passing between them. When they fixed their eyes on Zheng, they jumped into the air at the same time, and rushed towards Zheng at a great speed.</p>
