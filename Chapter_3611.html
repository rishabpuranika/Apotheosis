<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>No proper introduction was given regarding the rules of this world or how to pass the test.</p>

  <p>However, those people had already given Zheng a clear hint.</p>

  <p>If he ate all the food, he would certainly die. His death would mean he'd surely be kicked out of the game.</p>

  <p>This round of the game would test his self-discipline and willpower.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng's tremendous amount of experience had made his soul powerful beyond measure, it did not affect his decisiveness and willpower whatsoever.</p>

  <p>Besides, when one's willpower had increased to a certain extent, it would be difficult for it to advance further.</p>

  <p>Normally, Zheng would've dealt with similar situations by utilizing the Emotion Closing Godly Way. Now that he had lost all his abilities and theurgies, it would be impossible for him to use it.</p>

  <p>A familiar scent wafted through his nose and made him swallow. It was wine. With a newfound determination, he turned around and left.</p>

  <p>In the wilderness, he was still alone.</p>

  <p>His body was exhausted from being pushed to its limit— a constant reminder of his hunger and thirst. It was so bad that he felt his throat was dry and burning with each exhale.</p>

  <p>This worsened once he saw light appear before him again.</p>

  <p>Beneath it was laid a bevy of delicious food. What would've normally been pure pleasure turned into pure torture at that moment.</p>

  <p>The light illuminated a mouthwatering and tempting array of food and wine, which suppressed Zheng's waning restraint.</p>

  <p>He thought to himself a few times that this wasn't just merely a test but an act of torture as well!</p>

  <p>Eight hours passed...</p>

  <p>Ten hours passed...</p>

  <p>Twenty hours passed...</p>

  <p>This mortal body he possessed, although strong, could only take so much. If it reached its limit, then he would die too.</p>

  <p>'If I push this body too much, then I'll never be able to pass the test, ' he thought to himself as he walked onwards like a living corpse.</p>

  <p>When he was lost in his thoughts, everything before him faded into black as his eyes fell shut and his body fell to the ground with a thud.</p>

  <p>It took a while before he gradually regained his consciousness.</p>

  <p>He immediately and quickly took a look at his surroundings as he came out of his slumber.</p>

  <p>He should've been back at the temple if he failed.</p>

  <p>To his surprise, he wasn't in the wilderness nor the temple. Now he sat on a throne within the walls of a golden palace, his body covered in an imperial robe. At the bottom of the steps leading to the throne stood the civil and military ministers.</p>

  <p>"I'm not eliminated. Have I passed the first test?" he asked as he still sat on the throne, a slight hint of joy beginning to wash over him.</p>

  <p>The first round tested his desire for food and drink. What would the second test have in store for him?</p>

  <p>As Zheng gazed down at the ministers gathered before him, his faces held strange expressions. He came to realize something and asked, "Will this round test my desire for power?"</p>

  <p>Since he was aware that everything was merely an illusion, he also knew that the power and wealth surrounding him were fake. He began to wonder how this test could work. Moreover, he never held a desire to possess a high position or vast amounts of wealth.</p>

  <p>This round of test wouldn't be too difficult, then.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng would soon find out that this round would be anything but simple and easy.</p>

  <p>In a limited period of time, tests like this were meaningless.</p>

  <p>However, illusions such as this had the potential to make him feel as though hundreds or even thousands of years had passed.</p>

  <p>Zheng was able to cope with this world with an indifferent attitude in the beginning. But as more time passed, he soon became more convinced that he was indeed the mortal emperor of this world for dozens of years...</p>

  <p>It appeared that his real memories were slowly fading away— as if to give space for his new, mortal memories to take over.</p>

  <p>He became entangled in the various situations of the citizens, ministers, and even concubines. In one way or another, he was involved with all of them.</p>

  <p>Within the temple, the statue located within its center tilted its head to gaze at the starry pattern.</p>

  <p>Among the stars, Zheng, Elvinia, and the human woman were all undergoing different trials.</p>

  <p>The statue, which was a puppet, could still think like a normal person.</p>

  <p>However, it had its limits as well.</p>

  <p>Its current mission was to wait in the temple and choose the most qualified one.</p>

  <p>Deep within its heart, it had already rejected the idea of choosing the woman from the Nihility race or Elvinia from the beginning. If it had it its way, it would've prevented them both from entering the starry pattern and accepting the test in the first place.</p>

  <p>"Will he find his end at this round?" the statue uttered to no one in particular.</p>

  <p>In fact, Elvinia and the human woman were performing better than Zheng.</p>

  <p>The woman from the Nihility race had already managed to pass three out of the six desire tests. What amazed the statue even further was the fact that Elvinia had passed four desire tests in a row, as if none of the desires had great control over her. She seemed to be totally in control of herself.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if they know," the statue said, "that the more complicated experiences one has, the harder it would be to make it through each test?"</p>

  <p>The statue could do nothing more than let out a sigh and see what would happen next.</p>

  <p>In Elvinia's case, her past experiences were vast and unpleasant but far from complicated. Before meeting Zheng, a majority of her life was boring. This gave her the mindset and resistance to be able to pass through the temptations with ease.</p>

  <p>Back in the illusion, Zheng had believed that he had been emperor for nearly a hundred years.</p>

  <p>He seemed to have completely forgotten who he truly was and now believed that he was someone else— the sovereign emperor of an imaginary kingdom.</p>

  <p>Throughout his rule, he had received numerous compliments from his subjects and every word he said was regarded as a law.</p>

  <p>Two hundred years passed...</p>

  <p>Three hundred years passed...</p>

  <p>Five hundred years passed...</p>

  <p>One day, a strange feeling suddenly overcame Zheng.</p>

  <p>His original memories returned and crashed into him like a tidal wave.</p>

  <p>Soon, he recognized the ridiculousness of all that surrounded him.</p>

  <p>While he was realizing this, all the citizens, ministers and concubines turned into skeletons, their crumbling bones turning to dust that was swept away by the wind.</p>

  <p>The huge palace collapsed in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>Only then did Zheng realize that he had been trapped in the test for a long time. It took him hundreds of years to pass the test.</p>

  <p>However, time in the starry illusion passed at a different rate from time in the outside world.</p>

  <p>In reality, Zheng had only been trapped in that kingdom for ten minutes.</p>

  <p>After Zheng passed the test, the entire world began to change once more.</p>

  <p>Before him stood numerous beautiful women. Some of them were coquettish while others were more affectionate.</p>

  <p>"A test of...sexual desire?" Zheng raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>The third test was considerably easier for Zheng. Although he was a mortal now, he had already experienced love. The gorgeous women surrounding him were unsuccessful in tempting him any further.</p>

  <p>While they possessed the most pleasant and seductive voices and smelled of the most enticing perfumes, Zheng was able to restrain himself. Slowly but surely, he passed the third test.</p>

  <p>The fourth test passed...</p>

  <p>The fifth test passed...</p>

  <p>Finally, the sixth test passed...</p>

  <p>Originally, Zheng was lagging behind the other two competitors, in last place to pass the tests. But now that both women were stuck in the test of same desire, he was miraculously in the first place.</p>

  <p>"Now that I've passed the tests of six desires, does this mean that I've passed the entire test?"</p>

  <p>If this was what the starry illusion would always be like, then it should be a piece of cake for Zheng. After all, he only had difficulty in the second test.</p>

  <p>But Zheng remained in this world of illusions. He remained among the stars.</p>

  <p>As if sensing his confusion, the stars began to cover and spin around him once more.</p>

  <p>As a result, the spinning began to project spectacular scenes before his very eyes.</p>

  <p>The grand desolated land, the sea, the mountains...</p>

  <p>As the vision continued, he began to see the entire world before him from a great distance.</p>

  <p>What he initially thought he was staring at was the Source World. However, he later confirmed that this was an entirely different world.</p>

  <p>Whereas the Source World was shaped like a huge egg with numerous provinces within its shell, the world Zheng saw before him at that moment was made up of countless stars.</p>
