<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2108 Stealing Into The Divine Land </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The Heavens-suppressing Object that was in full bloom was still slowly hovering above Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>Bits of light continued to pour down, and eventually turned into a pale golden book that was reflected in Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>On top of the book were three large black words, 'Evolutionary Divine Arts'. The voice that had been transmitting into Zheng's mind was a part of the Evolutionary Divine Arts, and was also Mike's lifelong comprehension.</p>

  <p>The Evolutionary Divine Arts had the miraculous effect of strengthening the soul and spirit. One's soul power became several times stronger than that of an ordinary martial artist once they reached the highest level of cultivation. This meant that the power of Mike's soul was unrivaled among the Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>But Zheng didn't know that the moment he began to comprehend the Evolutionary Divine Arts, the aura emanating from his soul had begun to grow stronger by the minute.</p>

  <p>The Gold Fighting Soul belonged to the strongest realm that a soul could reach in the universe.</p>

  <p>Becoming a Gold Fighting Soul allowed one's soul to freely leave the body to defend it against the enemy. One could even attach their soul to their swords and sabers to increase the power of their weapons.</p>

  <p>The souls of Master Feng, Supreme Lord of Original Sin, and the others were all Gold Fighting Souls.</p>

  <p>However, the True God Soul was stronger than the Gold Fighting Soul.</p>

  <p>The True God Soul was just a generic term for the soul of the True God, but in reality, there was a difference in the strengths of the souls of different True Gods. In the divine land, souls were classified according to their power.</p>

  <p>For example, the souls of Wynn and Murphy's disciple, Marko, were considered to be stronger than those of other True Gods. The souls of Mateo and Pranav were slightly weaker.</p>

  <p>"Zheng's aura... is increasing by a huge margin!" Wynn had already detected the change in Zheng's soul.</p>

  <p>Since a few golden sword shadows were still on Zheng's soul, a sharp aura was now mixed within his soul. When he would release his soul aura, it would be like an arrow made to oppress and threaten.</p>

  <p>Wynn was still comfortable as he faced the waves of sharp aura that Zheng was emitting.</p>

  <p>But Master Feng was beginning to feel uneasy.</p>

  <p>The streaks of formless, formidable aura shot out in all directions, some even piercing Master Feng's mind. The aura penetrated his soul, causing him great pain.</p>

  <p>"This soul's aura is so formidable!"</p>

  <p>Master Feng was so astonished, he retreated 3, 000 feet in one startled jump.</p>

  <p>Master Feng was forced to retreat in surprise because of the aura. If Zheng were to use his full strength and release his soul aura to attack someone, wouldn't he be able to instantly kill their soul?</p>

  <p>But Master Feng was retreating at a slower pace than the speed at which Zheng's soul was strengthening.</p>

  <p>Once Master Feng had retreated to a distance of 3, 000 feet, the imposing aura of the soul became even stronger. A few invisible arrows of imposing aura began to pierce his soul once again. He groaned for a long while before waving a hand and entering the space crack. His body appeared a dozen miles away, from where he looked upon Zheng, his face pale.</p>

  <p>"Zheng's soul is still a Gold Fighting Soul. But his soul's strength is already on par with that of a True God's soul," Wynn said calmly. "Master's method of soul cultivation is unrivaled!"</p>

  <p>In the distance, Master Feng's eyes were filled with reverence. This was the ability of the owner of the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>A person would have the upper hand in battle if their soul was strong.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment had died because of Marko's Soul Searching Flag. He had not been able to fight back even with the power of the Blessed Buddha Land.</p>

  <p>Zheng could easily kill a Supreme Lord with just his soul if he fought them at his current level.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't know that the aura he had unintentionally emitted had forced Master Feng to retreat. He was still lost in his own thoughts.</p>

  <p>The faint light scattered down chaotically. Besides the Evolutionary Divine Arts, a green jade ruler was condensing in his mind as the light gathered together.</p>

  <p>When the jade ruler was completely formed, Zheng's eyes flashed as he saw two large words appear on the ruler.</p>

  <p>'Infinity Ruler?</p>

  <p>Why would such a ruler appear?</p>

  <p>Father said that the Evolution Godly Way is the source of counting. What does it have to do with this ruler?'</p>

  <p>Questions buzzed around in Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>But nobody was able to answer Zheng's questions. The authoritative voice that had recited the Evolutionary Divine Arts could no longer be heard.</p>

  <p>Zheng could only rely on himself to figure out the mystery behind it, if there was any.</p>

  <p>After a while, the faint light from the stamen of the Evolution Lotus Flower finally stopped.</p>

  <p>The Evolution Lotus Flower had spiraled for a while before its petals returned from a state of bloom to their original state.</p>

  <p>"Huff, huff..."</p>

  <p>The Evolution Lotus Flower circled in the air before flying the short distance to Master Feng.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Zheng opened his eyes and turned to look back, only to realize that Wynn and Master Feng had rushed over to him. He smiled.</p>

  <p>"Master Wynn. Master Feng."</p>

  <p>Wynn smiled back as he said, "Congratulations. You must have comprehended something new about the Godly Way."</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded, a look of regret on his face. "It's a pity that I haven't condensed my Godly Tile." As he spoke, his gaze penetrated the darkness and stared at the blue light spot above the dome of the universe.</p>

  <p>Many mortals saw this light spot as a special star that had appeared quite suddenly.</p>

  <p>Some people called this spot the Spider Star, while others called it the Ominous Star. Either way, it was a bad omen.</p>

  <p>Only a few martial artists knew that the light spot was not a star, but a scar left behind on the Sighing Wall by Murphy after he had shattered the Sighing Wall. The Sighing Wall of the universe had the ability to heal itself completely. But it would probably take tens of millions of years for this scar to heal. And this meant that the mortals could not see the light spot disappear.</p>

  <p>As he looked at the light spot, Zheng's heart was filled with a violent killing intent. He couldn't wait to step into the divine land and personally kill Murphy.</p>

  <p>But he didn't know how and when to condense a Godly Tile.</p>

  <p>Wynn smiled. "There's no need to wait so long."</p>

  <p>"What?" Zheng looked suspiciously at Wynn.</p>

  <p>"You have already removed the limits of the heavens. I can now send you to the divine land," Wynn said.</p>

  <p>"You'll send me there? Won't I ascend to the divine land on my own after I condense my Godly Tile?" Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>When Zheng had broken through and reached the Life and Death Realm in the Lower World, he had been rejected by the world itself and forced into the ascending passageway by the world's power.</p>

  <p>And if one could condense a Godly Tile in the Upper World, they would also be rejected by the universe and ascend to the divine land.</p>

  <p>This had been the case for many years.</p>

  <p>Wynn laughed. "That's not really it. True Gods who form their Godly Tiles in the universe are usually led to the divine land by a member of the Jiang Clan. But the guide in the Evolutionary Universe has already been forced to return to the Jiang Clan."</p>

  <p>"The young lady from the Jiang Clan?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Wynn nodded. "The Jiang Clan wrote down this rule through that stone slab a thousand divine eras ago. That's why the Jiang Clan is responsible for guiding the warriors in the universe to the divine land and controlling the heavens. None of the Holy Beings could violate this rule. But this time, we are lucky enough that the young lady was forced to stay back in the Jiang Clan. Even your sister has also contributed to this matter."</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyebrows rose at Wynn's mention of Yan and a sword-like light flashed through his eyes.</p>

  <p>Wynn laughed and said, "Don't get too excited. I'm only guessing at the moment. If I'm not mistaken, Harold might have done something, otherwise the Jiang Clan wouldn't have allowed the controller of the heavens of the Evolutionary Universe to become vacant for so long."</p>

  <p>Zheng calmed himself down. He was too sensitive and did not know where to look for Yan even if he did go to the divine land. But right now, he had another question to pose to Wynn. "Why did the Jiang Clan send their own members to control the heavens?"</p>

  <p>Sending members of the clan to different universes to help other Holy Beings control the heavens was a thankless task.</p>

  <p>"You don't even know that the Jiang Clan's Floating Island in the Time Sea is considered one of the top ten big islands in the first tier! The reason they are able to raise their clan to such a high level is because they rely on the method of controlling the heavens. And this is related to the Jiang Clan's cultivation method. You will gradually understand all of this once you enter the divine land. Now, I can help you sneak into the divine land."</p>
