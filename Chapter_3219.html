<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Oneness Sky Palace was a place where human forces from all over the world gathered. Each mountain had its own bloodline.</p>

  <p>But Feng Ge's bloodline was different. Her blood mostly belonged to the Sun Crow race.</p>

  <p>It was taboo to talk about Feng Ge's bloodline in the Phoenix Palace. Even Flamine took great care not to mention any of it in her daily life.</p>

  <p>Flamine had become furious when Yasamin had mocked Feng Ge's bloodline to her face. And when Yasamin had mentioned Dorothy, Flamine searched Dorothy's face, trying to understand something from it. "The Sun Crow race are blessed by the sun and are favored by fate. Feng Ge's talent is the best among all the women. She has a bright future. How could she be compared to a bumpkin?"</p>

  <p>Feng Ge and Dorothy were both beautiful in their own way. One was noble and lofty while the other was passionate. But it was obvious that Feng Ge was superior to Dorothy in terms of talent.</p>

  <p>Yasamin knocked her cane on the ground, causing the Mighty Sword Hall to tremble.</p>

  <p>"It's just Instant Enlightenment. But my Dora is-"</p>

  <p>Yasamin broke off.</p>

  <p>A huge secret was sealed within Dorothy's soul that was limiting her talent.</p>

  <p>The seal would be removed only when her soul crossed the Lust World, stepped into the Desire World, and then reached the Chaotic Source Realm.</p>

  <p>But she could not reveal this secret now.</p>

  <p>"But what?" Flamine smiled smugly and said, "The Instant Enlightenment is not easy to achieve. There are only fourteen warriors who have become capable of the Instant Enlightenment in the Oneness Sky Palace over the years. Moreover, Feng Ge can not only achieve Instant Enlightenment on the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, she might also achieve Instant Enlightenment on the Truth of Cultivation Nature. It's just that she is too young right now, which is why I don't allow her to practice it."</p>

  <p>There was probably no other talent who could achieve Instant Enlightenment on two Truths of Godly Ways in the Oneness Sky Palace. It really was an amazing ability.</p>

  <p>"So what? Does marriage depend on talent? Because then the couple can fight all day long?".</p>

  <p>Gethin's eyes widened in confusion as he watched Flamine and Yasamin bickering with each other. He had no idea what they were quarreling about.</p>

  <p>He had asked the question to buy more time. He hadn't expected it to start a fight between them!</p>

  <p>The two leaders of the intelligence agency looked on, astonished. It was strange to them that they were fighting for trifles when the two parties were at daggers drawn.</p>

  <p>Who the hell was this Zheng? Why were both the Origin Mountain and the Oneness Mountain so hell bent on wanting him to marry their precious girls?</p>

  <p>Athemar, Winchell, and the others looked on, speechless.</p>

  <p>Athemar knew a little about Zheng and Dorothy's relationship. The Origin Mountain had fought for Zheng because Dorothy had met Zheng before Athemar had. But Athemar had outright dismissed it. After all, Zheng had already joined his Sword Light Palace.</p>

  <p>But what about Feng Ge?</p>

  <p>On the day of the Seven Mountains Meeting, Zheng had defeated Feng Ge. Her defeat had pissed her off and she had left in a huff.</p>

  <p>Why would Flamine favor him?. Athemar cleared his throat and said, "I think we should look for Zheng first."</p>

  <p>Dorothy, who was standing next to her grandmother, couldn't bear for the argument to drag anymore. She was a shy girl and to see her grandmother argue with someone over her marriage depressed her to no end. She shook Yasamin's arm and said, "Grandma, stop it. We don't even know if Zheng is still safe!"</p>

  <p>It was then that Flamine remembered what she had come here for. She turned to Gethin and said, "Gethin, please hand Zheng over to us."</p>

  <p>Gethin had had more time to think as they argued. He was now calmer as he said, "I really don't know about Zheng being brought into the Vastness Mountain. If you still have doubts, you can search the mountain by yourselves."</p>

  <p>Gethin was still playing the fool, something that gladdened Athemar. He sneered as he said, "It's not that difficult to find Zheng."</p>

  <p>Athemar, in order to protect Zheng, had cast a Latent Theurgy on Zheng when he had given him the Flow Swordsmanship.</p>

  <p>This Latent Theurgy was called the Nirvana Strike. Zheng could use this strike to save himself in desperate situations.</p>

  <p>Athemar could feel the Latent Theurgy he had cast on Zheng as long as they were close to each other, which was why he had proposed to search the mountain in the beginning. With his ability, it wouldn't have taken him long to find Zheng.</p>

  <p>But things had gotten rough when Gethin stopped him.</p>

  <p>Athemar flew into the sky.</p>

  <p>He transformed into a light and hovered around the Vastness Mountain.</p>

  <p>He circled the mountain, beginning from the top and towards the bottom.</p>

  <p>Athemar's eyes lit up. He had sensed the Latent Theurgy on the other side of the Vastness Mountain.</p>

  <p>"There he is!"</p>

  <p>Once he had locked on the position, he began to make his way to Zheng.</p>
