<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Everyone began shouting at once. "It's dangerous there!"</p>

  <p>"There is a six-headed eagle!"</p>

  <p>"Get out of here right now!" yelled the son of the leader. His call was echoed by several other men in black behind him. They wanted to stop Luo Zheng from climbing up.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng could not do as they said, even if he wanted to. The Treacherous Being had taken full control of his body. Although Luo Zheng's soul remained intact in his own head, he had no way to communicate with the Treacherous Being, so it was even less likely that the Treacherous Being could listen to anyone else.</p>

  <p>Without hesitation, without getting distracted, Luo Zheng continued to climb up.</p>

  <p>Clearly, the Treacherous Being was targeting the pagoda mountain upon which the six-headed eagles had built their nest.</p>

  <p>The piercing cry of a bird echoed in the air.</p>

  <p>The female eagle stretched out its neck to issue a warning call to Luo Zheng, who was already halfway to his goal.</p>

  <p>The six-headed eagle was very sensitive to danger, and sensed that Luo Zheng possessed a strange and powerful aura. Wary of Luo Zheng, the eagle did not immediately spit out corrosive saliva at him.</p>

  <p>Yet Luo Zheng continued to climb, oblivious to the threat posed by the six-headed eagle.</p>

  <p>"Don't go up! That eagle has deadly saliva that will melt you completely. It has warned you already!"</p>

  <p>"That is weird. The six-headed eagles are always ready to attack without warning."</p>

  <p>"Yes, that female eagle is reacting in a strange way..."</p>

  <p>The men wearing black robes had prepared well. Because they intended to steal the eggs of the six-headed eagles, they had thoroughly immersed themselves in the lore and habits of the eagles, investigating them to discover their patterns of behavior.</p>

  <p>These men had learned that the eagles were quick to attack any creature that dared to approach them, so negotiation was virtually impossible. They would spit on anyone before they could say a word. The men had never seen the eagles hesitate before attacking an intruder.</p>

  <p>So for a six-headed eagle to warn Luo Zheng was very unusual. If it had truly been a warning, then there was only one obvious explanation? something about Luo Zheng must have caused the eagle to be afraid of attacking him directly.</p>

  <p>The black-robed men watched Luo Zheng closely. How powerful was this human youth?</p>

  <p>Everyone subconsciously rejected the idea that Luo Zheng could be very powerful.</p>

  <p>After all, no matter how strong he was, he was still only a human. It was impossible for a human to grow strong enough for a six-headed eagle to be afraid of him.</p>

  <p>The eagle let out another mournful cry. "Aooo!"</p>

  <p>It was obvious that the eagle was trying to warn Luo Zheng to go away, instead of engaging him in direct battle. What was going on? Was a six-headed eagle really afraid of a mere human?</p>

  <p>The people in black robes were confused at the unexpected behavior of the eagle, but there was also a glimmer of hope rising in their hearts.</p>

  <p>Could this human be capable of dealing with the six-headed eagles?</p>

  <p>The eagle got agitated after Luo Zheng ignored its second warning. It reared back and spat out a mouthful of deadly green saliva at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The caustic liquid sizzled upon contact with the air.</p>

  <p>The eagle's saliva corroded everything it touched, even the air, and left behind a green line as it zoomed towards Luo Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, Luo Zheng darted to one side.</p>

  <p>Controlled by the Treacherous Being, Luo Zheng's body had narrowly evaded the missile of deadly spit, dodging to the side with incredible speed and agility.</p>

  <p>This was the first time that the Treacherous Being had avoided an attack!</p>

  <p>It seemed to understand that the green saliva was dangerous to its host body.</p>

  <p>The six-headed eagle hooted furiously. All six heads rose together, and green smoke billowed in their beaks as they all prepared to spit simultaneously at the intruder.</p>

  <p>Huge blobs of corrosive saliva rained down on Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The men in black robes watched in tense silence, wondering how Luo Zheng would respond. Although they had never met him before, they recognized him as someone similar to themselves, and they felt some regret at the thought that he was about to be melted by the six-headed eagle's saliva after all.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng was not about to stand still and wait to die.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng clung like a lizard to the wall of the pagoda mountain. He tilted back his head slightly and opened his mouth, releasing a white substance that fanned out across his body. As the white mass spread out, it thinned, like a white cloth that covered his body to provide protection against the corrosive saliva.</p>

  <p>Although the eagle's spit could still corrode the body of the Treacherous Being, it didn't care.</p>

  <p>The black-robed people were astonished by Luo Zheng's unexpected defensive maneuver.</p>

  <p>"What is that white cloth made of? What a treasure it is, if the eagle's saliva can't corrode it!"</p>

  <p>"I've never seen anything that could withstand the corrosive saliva before..."</p>

  <p>"Where did he learn to do that?"</p>

  <p>Of course, what they didn't know was that the white cloth was the real body of the Treacherous Being, and that Luo Zheng was under its control.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, on another pagoda mountain, the Wing King had descended.</p>

  <p>Everyone on his back had witnessed what had been happening there.</p>

  <p>"A part of the Treacherous Being's body voluntarily left Luo Zheng's body through his mouth. Should we act now?" asked King Ieuan.</p>

  <p>"Act? How? Can we pull that thing out entirely?" Fuxi asked.</p>

  <p>King Ieuan thought for a moment, but could not figure out a plan. Sighing, it said, "So we will just watch and do nothing?"</p>

  <p>"The only thing we can do is wait. We must stay put and see what will happen next," said the Snake Goddess softly. "At least the Treacherous Being was able to protect Luo Zheng's body from the corrosive saliva."</p>

  <p>Indeed, not only had the Treacherous Being preserved Luo Zheng's soul, it protected Luo Zheng's physical body. The situation was bad but not as dire as they had initially imagined.</p>

  <p>The eagle continued to spit at Luo Zheng, who was pinned beneath the white cloth to the wall.</p>

  <p>As the Treacherous Being blocked this wave of spit, it began to develop a rough estimate of the corrosive power of the eagle's saliva.</p>

  <p>Its body was plastered closely over every inch of Luo Zheng's body, so it looked like Luo Zheng's figure was outlined by a layer of wet white cloth.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng lifted one arm, and the white cloth covered his skin closely, protecting him. He began climbing once more.</p>

  <p>With astonishing speed, he drew near to the top of the mountain, where the nest was located.</p>

  <p>The six-headed eagle let out cries of rage and swooped towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The female eagle was angrier than it had ever been, and six heads with their sharp beaks all pecked at Luo Zheng, determined to drive him away.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng lifted his right hand, while continuing to grip the wall with his left. He swung in the air and easily avoided the pecking of the six heads. At the same time, he stretched out his right arm towards the eagle.</p>

  <p>He slashed downwards four times.</p>

  <p>His attack sliced through the necks of the six-headed eagle, and four heads were cut off, tumbling into the nest. The corrosive saliva in their decapitated heads flowed from their open beaks and melted large holes into the nest.</p>

  <p>The female eagle wailed with pain.</p>

  <p>Badly injured, it flew up into the sky, circling the nest from a distance.</p>

  <p>As long as one of its heads remained unharmed, the eagle would stay alive; but if both of the remaining two heads were cut off, then it would die.</p>

  <p>With extreme grief and indignation, it gave up on its nest, deciding to flee the scene. However, at that moment, the male eagle returned carrying a Black Teeth Swallow. After it had caught and killed the swallow, the male eagle had planned to bring the food back to share with the female eagle at the nest. It had never imagined that any creature would dare to break into their nest.</p>

  <p>It hooted loudly as it saw the injured state of the female eagle.</p>

  <p>The female eagle called out mournfully, gliding as close as it could to the nest while staying out of reach of Luo Zheng's attacks.</p>

  <p>For several moments, the two six-headed eagles communicated with each other midair. Then the male eagle flew towards the nest, its eyes burning with anger.</p>

  <p>The six-headed eagles were notoriously irritable, so others didn't dare provoke them. They not only attacked immediately, they were vengeful creatures that plundered everywhere when they were enraged. A six-headed eagle would never forgive or forget a creature that had invaded its nest.</p>

  <p>The eagle sliced through the air as it swooped towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Quickly it rose back up, circling in the air once, then swooped down on Luo Zheng again.</p>

  <p>The only goal of the Treacherous Being was to overturn the pagoda mountain. If it hadn't been provoked first, it wouldn't have fought back.</p>

  <p>After driving away the female eagle, the Treacherous Being was ready to topple down the pagoda mountain.</p>

  <p>When the male eagle came about a hundred feet close to him, Luo Zheng immediately turned and jumped.</p>

  <p>He soared through the air and landed on the back of the outraged eagle, who had been completely unprepared for that move. No one had ever even imagined getting so close to a six-headed eagle before.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng slashed his hand several times, creating an invisible force that was like a sharp sword cutting through the necks of the male eagle.</p>

  <p>Five of its six necks were cut off, leaving only the last one still attached.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had no intention of killing the eagle. Instead, as the eagle veered through the air, emitting cries of pain, he leaped from its back.</p>

  <p>He grabbed onto the top of the mountain and slid down. As he moved, he suddenly pushed it.</p>

  <p>There was a loud clicking sound, like a gear functioning, then the whole pagoda mountain swayed. Everyone stared as the mountain toppled sideways.</p>

  <p>As the pagoda mountain fell to the ground, three bird eggs rolled out of the nest.</p>

  <p>Although the eggs were thrown to the ground from tens of thousands of feet in the air, they were unharmed. Evidently, the eggs were very tough and resistant to damage.</p>

  <p>The eggs rolled on the ground and came to a stop near the leader of the men in black robes.</p>

  <p>The black-robed people were stunned by this sudden stroke of good fortune.</p>

  <p>They stood motionless, staring at the precious eggs, hardly daring to breathe.</p>
