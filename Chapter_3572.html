<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It wasn't long before five hundred words were already put on the paper.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng gently placed the brush down and stored it in his space ring. He turned to Eastern Emperor Taiyi. "I have written down all that I have deciphered, Your Majesty."</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi beamed happily as he gazed at the output.</p>

  <p>He still hadn't figured out how Luo Zheng could decipher Sanskrit words. He thought it was blind guessing, at first. However, Eastern Emperor Taiyi himself was proficient in deciphering Sanskrit words, and he knew one couldn't get this far just by guessing.</p>

  <p>He had no doubt that with Luo Zheng's help, they would soon decipher the full text of the Truth Enlightenment. Eastern Emperor Taiyi was thrilled at the thought.</p>

  <p>"If we can decipher the Truth Enlightenment completely, it will be a great boon to the Taiyi Heaven Palace," Eastern Emperor Taiyi said, a bright smile on his face.</p>

  <p>The Oneness Governors and other high-ranking officials nodded their heads in agreement, proud and excited of this development. None more so than Qiu Yinhe.</p>

  <p>He thought of how fortunate they were that Luo Zheng had joined the Sword Light Palace. Qiu Yinhe had never imagined he would make such great contributions to the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>Given Luo Zheng's talent, he would probably prove even more valuable in the future. Qiu Yinhe looked forward to seeing him accomplish more as time went by.</p>

  <p>"It is my honor, Your Majesty," Luo Zheng responded, modestly.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi turned his smile on Luo Zheng. "But there is another reason why I called you here today."</p>

  <p>At these words, Feng Ge, who had been standing beside Luo Zheng, stared at the ground and began to blush shyly, a rare sight to see.</p>

  <p>"How else may I help you, Your Majesty?" Luo Zheng asked, confused.</p>

  <p>He had noticed that this occasion seemed unusually grand, but the thought had left his mind as he concentrated on his earlier task.</p>

  <p>At this moment, a pleasant voice rang out, "Do you remember that I promised I would reward you graciously?"</p>

  <p>Flamine walked out from the back of the palace.</p>

  <p>She was dressed in fiery red silk, with fire phoenixes hanging at her cuffs and waist. She looked utterly regal and glamorous.</p>

  <p>"Reward me graciously?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had to rack his brains before realizing what Flamine was talking about.</p>

  <p>He had forgotten all about it until she mentioned it again just now.</p>

  <p>Back then, Luo Zheng and Feng Ge were trapped in the Dark Region, facing mortal danger. Only after they were stuck in the light column were they able to leave the Other Shore and come back to the Source World. Even so, they were still in danger then.</p>

  <p>Flamine had asked Luo Zheng then to protect her daughter, promising to reward him for her safe return.</p>

  <p>In fact, Luo Zheng hadn't paid much attention to those words. By the time they left the Dark Region, Feng Ge had already become a purified being, while Luo Zheng had obtained the Civilization Artifact, which was all the reward he wanted.</p>

  <p>There was also the matter of Feng Ge coming back with her Memory Flame in disarray, her intelligence temporarily degenerating to that of a child's.</p>

  <p>Flamine had been very upset about that and forgot the reward thing.</p>

  <p>That she would now bring up it, however, came as a surprise.</p>

  <p>"I do remember you saying something of the sort, Lady Flamine, but what reward will you give me?" Luo Zheng asked, carefully.</p>

  <p>Flamine chuckled and looked at Feng Ge. "The gracious reward is right by your side," she pronounced.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng turned his startled eyes on Feng Ge. Seeing her blush and fidget made him realize what was happening. "Lady Flamine, do you mean...?"</p>

  <p>"I want Feng Ge to marry you," Flamine declared flatly.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Luo Zheng's heart dropped.</p>

  <p>This was starting to look like a complicated mess.</p>

  <p>"Would you take my daughter's hand in marriage?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi asked seriously.</p>

  <p>The high-ranking officials flanking both sides of the hall turned to look at Luo Zheng expectantly.</p>

  <p>They thought it would be a perfect match.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng was cultivating in the Taiyi Heaven Palace, he still joined them as an outsider, since he had the bloodline of the Nine Li race If he married Feng Ge, he would truly be part of the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng straightened up, cupping one hand over the other in front of him respectfully. "Your Majesty, Lady Flamine, I already have a principal wife."</p>

  <p>Feng Ge was the daughter of Eastern Emperor Taiyi. She couldn't compromise her status by being a concubine of Luo Zheng, could she?</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng had been together with Yudie for so long. Surely, he would never forgive himself if he suddenly gave her up for another.</p>

  <p>"Of course I know that," Flamine responded gracefully. "But once Feng Ge marries you, she will have that status. She is, after all, my beloved daughter with Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and can settle for nothing less. Even your principal wife understands this, and has given her consent."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyebrows shot up at these words. "Tia has agreed to this, Lady Flamine? She said this personally?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had been so busy on the Other Shore of late that he had had no time to visit Yudie and the others at the Heart Flow Sect. He remembered, however, Feng Ge telling him that Yudie would be taken to the Phoenix Palace.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng thought it was unusual, at the time, but he didn't worry too much about it. He knew Yudie would be safe in the Phoenix Palace, at least.</p>

  <p>It dawned on Luo Zheng now why Yudie and Xi Youqin had been brought here.</p>

  <p>"Of course. It came directly from her," Flamine said, nodding emphatically.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng glanced at Feng Ge before speaking again. "May I see Tia, then?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng indeed had plans to visit Yudie and the others now that he had also been summoned here to the Phoenix Palace. But the developments of this visit so far had been completely unexpected.</p>

  <p>Flamine blinked slightly before regaining her composure. "They are cultivating in seclusion in the Heavenly Cultivation Palace. They have activated the Soul Fire Swirl. I'm afraid it's not appropriate to interrupt them at this moment."</p>

  <p>The Soul Fire Swirl was a kind of cultivation method in the Heavenly Cultivation Palace. Flamine wouldn't lie to Luo Zheng, would she?</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Luo Zheng thought, she could very easily manipulate others into thinking what she wanted.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge almost looked pitiful by Luo Zheng's side, her wide eyes gazing at him hopefully.</p>

  <p>She desperately wished he wouldn't let her down now. Today, her father had summoned all the high-ranking officials to the palace, supposedly for the deciphering of the Truth Enlightenment. However, his real purpose was to seal the marriage, in front of witnesses.</p>

  <p>"You are overthinking this, Luo Zheng. This is a wonderful thing," Qiu Yinhe told him, gently.</p>

  <p>"That's right! You seem to love each other. What else is there to consider?" another high-ranking official chimed in.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng barely glanced at them before responding to Flamine, "My apologies. I just cannot decide without consulting Yudie myself. Please excuse my leave."</p>

  <p>He turned around and walked out.</p>

  <p>The high-ranking officials in the Phoenix Palace grew abuzz, turning to each other in astonishment and confusion.</p>

  <p>The old man beside Eastern Emperor Taiyi, in particular, was seething. He had gone to countless life-and-death battles with Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>

  <p>The two of them were like brothers.</p>

  <p>It angered him to see Luo Zheng daring to humiliate Eastern Emperor Taiyi like this.</p>

  <p>"Stop, you brat!" the old man roared furiously.</p>

  <p>A terrifying aura rushed from inside the hall, seemingly chasing after Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The guards in golden armor posted outside the hall trembled.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng continued to stride out purposefully even as this threat hounded him.</p>
