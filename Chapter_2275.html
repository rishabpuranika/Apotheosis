<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2275 Imprisoned </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>In the Mu Clan's place, the door of the God-killing Hall swung open with a loud bang.</p>

  <p>The guards on both sides of the gate knelt down on the ground.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, Rachelle left the Mu Clan's Floating Island like a ghost.</p>

  <p>The guards exchanged glances with each other and began discussing in low voices.</p>

  <p>"Miss Mu was quite confident this time, wasn't she?"</p>

  <p>"But she has still been defeated by Harold. Alas, things will not be good for her in the following days."</p>

  <p>"Everyone should be so careful from now on."</p>

  <p>They all knew that Rachelle had a bad temper.</p>

  <p>After leaving the Floating Island, Rachelle stepped on the transparent disk and floated up into the air. Flying was forbidden in the Time Sea and all warriors were banned from using the spatial transference. Even if she reached the consummation of True God Realm, she could not break this rule.</p>

  <p>As she traveled through the thick fog, a dark mountain came into view in front of her.</p>

  <p>The mountain was a hundred thousand feet high and it was very steep.</p>

  <p>Halfway up the mountain stood a huge slate which represented the highest rule of the divine land. It was the Ruling Slate.</p>

  <p>The slate connected the entire mountain with lightning that seemed ordinary but contained strong power that even Holy Beings could not resist.</p>

  <p>Under normal circumstances, no one could climb the mountain or approach the slate.</p>

  <p>Rachelle didn't travel toward the top of the mountain. After looking up at the slate, she moved to the back of the mountain and entered a huge cave.</p>

  <p>In the cave, a figure in a silver robe was bound by the lightning and could not move at all. It was none other than Murphy, who had broken the rules of the slate. After he had attacked the Evolutionary Universe, the Ruling Slate had trapped Murphy in the cave as punishment.</p>

  <p>"Father!" Rachelle shouted.</p>

  <p>"You've lost?" Murphy asked indifferently.</p>

  <p>He knew his daughter's character very well. Judging from the subtle difference in her voice, he could tell that Rachelle had been defeated.</p>

  <p>"Yes." Rachelle nodded, showing a little grievance on her face. But that grievance disappeared in an instant. She already had a cultivation at the consummation of True God Realm and was the hope of the Mu Clan.</p>

  <p>She could not let herself display any negative emotions in front of others, not even her own father.</p>

  <p>"I guess Harold has made some progress on his strength again," Murphy said. Then, he shook his head and added, "He has indeed benefitted a lot from the Everest Spirit Mountain."</p>

  <p>Recalling the strength that Harold had shown, Rachelle felt a chill run down her spine. However, it was no longer important. "Father, Harold has taken complete control of the Everest Spirit Mountain. He announced in the Arena of Legends that the Mu Clan can never step into the Everest Spirit Mountain again."</p>

  <p>"What?!"</p>

  <p>Murphy shouted in shock.</p>

  <p>He knew better than anyone how much the Mu Clan would be affected if the Everest Spirit Mountain was closed off to it. "Is the Mu Clan the only clan that isn't allowed to enter the Everest Spirit Mountain?" he asked, holding his breath in apprehension.</p>

  <p>"No. The Tang Clan and the Dongfang Clan are also not allowed to enter the Everest Spirit Mountain," Rachelle replied.</p>

  <p>"Humph! That brat is so despicable!" Murphy said coldly, but he felt a little better after knowing that the Mu Clan was not alone in its predicament.</p>

  <p>"And he also said that he would allow the Han Clan, the Gu Clan, the Moon Clan, and the Sword Clan to enter the Cloud Dragon Ravine. I think there should be some hint," Rachelle continued.</p>

  <p>In his battle against Mike, Murphy had tried his best to win and had even personally conducted the war in the universe. He knew a lot about Mike and many other things, so Rachelle informed him about all the details.</p>

  <p>"The Gu Clan, the Moon Clan, and the Sword Clan..." Murphy murmured, lost in thought.</p>

  <p>Rachelle stood in silence as well as she pondered about how unacceptable it was that she had lost to a guy 16 times in a row. Seeing Harold become more and more powerful, she guessed that her father might have made a mistake in the past.</p>

  <p>A long time ago, Murphy had destroyed the Luo Clan but he had spared Harold, who had posed a threat to the Mu Clan since then.</p>

  <p>Rachelle knew that she had no right to judge her father's actions, and yet, she couldn't help feeling bitter about it.</p>

  <p>"Harold's words were said to the warrior who has sneaked into the divine land," Murphy said flatly.</p>

  <p>"The warrior who has sneaked into the divine land?" Rachelle raised her eyebrows slightly, and her eyes suddenly flashed.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he probably said those words to give a hint to one of the two warriors who sneaked into the divine land some time ago," Murphy explained.</p>

  <p>In fact, Murphy had started the war in the universe, knowing about the ten Godly Geniuses. He didn't know exactly what Mike was going to do, but he roughly knew that Mike was pinning his hope on these secondary creatures.</p>

  <p>Murphy had once been extremely confused about this.</p>

  <p>Previously, he had thought that Mike had tried his best to train those Godly Geniuses just in order to deal with the war in the universe, and that the affairs in the divine land had been handed over to Harold.</p>

  <p>Only a while later had he realized that Mike had not attached the greatest importance to what his disciples did.</p>

  <p>Of course, Murphy found this illogical. No matter how powerful the secondary creatures in the universe were, it was a joke for Mike to pin all his hopes on them.</p>

  <p>Anyway, the fact that Harold controlled the Everest Spirit Mountain now left Murphy feeling bewildered.</p>

  <p>However, Mike's plans and arrangements had always been enigmatic, and Murphy had never underestimated these Godly Geniuses. Therefore, he had asked his people to investigate into the matter after hearing that Harold had made the guiders from the Jiang Clan withdraw from the universes and that the 833th rule on the Ruling Slate had been triggered.</p>

  <p>The warriors who had sneaked into the divine land must be Godly Geniuses from the Evolutionary Universe; that was the only explanation that made sense.</p>

  <p>In the end, the Mu Clan hadn't found out any clues about the event, and Murphy hadn't paid much attention to it. After all, in his eyes, a proving godly warrior wasn't worth being taken very seriously.</p>

  <p>"The Gu Clan has a very close relationship with the Luo Clan. It's normal for Harold to mention the Gu Clan and allow it to enter the Cloud Dragon Ravine. But I don't think there would be any Godly Geniuses hiding among the Gu Clan. It is too conspicuous," Murphy said, analyzing the situation.</p>

  <p>Then, he continued, "The Moon Clan doesn't have a close relationship with Mike, so it's not likely that any Godly Geniuses would stay there.</p>

  <p>The Sword Clan and the Moon Clan are the same. Harold has just mentioned these two powerful clans in order to confuse the public."</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, Murphy knew more about this matter than other Holy Beings. Although he didn't have much information about it, he could still discern the essence of the situation.</p>

  <p>"The Han Clan," Murphy murmured. "I remember that Joy once cultivated in the Evolutionary Universe. Even after becoming a Demi-holy Being, she still thinks of Mike all the time."</p>

  <p>"Father, are you saying that Harold said those words just to give a hint to someone in the Han Clan? Who could Harold have been speaking to?"</p>

  <p>Rachelle asked in shock.</p>

  <p>Murphy shook his head. "Since I haven't cultivated the Evolution Godly Way, I can't figure that out."</p>

  <p>As he thought about the Godly Geniuses in the Evolutionary Universe, he hesitated a little. It was possible that Mike had trained those Godly Geniuses just to mislead him. After all, Mike's plans had never been straightforward or easy to see through.</p>

  <p>"Anyway, the first thing we should do is to investigate it. Arrange people to observe the Everest Spirit Mountain," Murphy commanded.</p>

  <p>"But we're not allowed to enter the Everest Spirit Mountain anymore,"</p>

  <p>Rachelle reminded.</p>

  <p>"We can hire the True Gods from other rich clans on the Floating Islands to do that," Murphy suggested.</p>

  <p>Rachelle nodded in agreement. Harold hadn't banned all the rich clans from entering the Everest Spirit Mountain, and there were always warriors who would take risks in order to get more divine might coins.</p>

  <p>Compared to the Floating Islands of other clans, the Gu Clan's Floating Island, which was ranked eighth, was a bit smaller.</p>

  <p>There were only a few thousand people in total on the Gu Clan's Floating Island. Among the 36 Floating Islands, the Gu Clan's had the smallest population.</p>

  <p>Bromley did not like to accept disciples, and the Gu Clan did not have many descendants. On top of that, outsiders were not allowed to enter the Gu Clan's Floating Island. With all these limitations, there was barely any growth in the number of people living here.</p>

  <p>After watching the fight between Harold and Rachelle, Augustus left the Jade Wall of Legends. He traveled through the clouds and the mist, and then jumped into a unique courtyard and spoke to his senior fellow disciple. "Hey! Did you watch the open battle between Harold and Rachelle?"</p>

  <p>There was a boy in the courtyard carrying an emerald green fishing rod.</p>

  <p>Under the ray of light that hit the water from the rod, there was a blue fish biting on the bait.</p>

  <p>The boy was not fishing; instead, he was feeding the fish.</p>

  <p>However, Augustus's roar startled the fish, and it hurriedly swam away.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I did," the boy replied impatiently as he glared at Augustus and threw the fishing rod aside.</p>

  <p>"Harold has become more powerful again, and also very domineering.</p>

  <p>He seems completely different from what he used to be." Augustus sighed.</p>

  <p>The boy glanced at him but did not say anything. Harold's quick progress was indeed beyond his expectations.</p>

  <p>Since the boy stayed silent, Augustus continued, "Do you think that he was hinting for us to enter the Cloud Dragon Ravine when he spoke at the Arena of Legends? I think that he can't pass through the Cloud Dragon Ravine on his own, so he wants us to help him. Don't you think so?" At this thought, Augustus giggled.</p>

  <p>"Dream on," the boy said coldly. He then looked at the pool in front of him and said, "It's about to begin!"</p>

  <p>"What is going to begin?" Augustus asked in confusion upon hearing his senior fellow disciple's strange words.</p>

  <p>"Harold's words might have been a hint to our junior fellow disciple."</p>

  <p>The boy narrowed his eyes. "We're also going to take action. We can't fall behind Harold."</p>
