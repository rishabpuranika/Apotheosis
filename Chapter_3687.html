<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3687 Golden Rune Swords </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Emperor Ji stared at Eastern Emperor Taiyi, his dark eyes expressing a strong killing intent.</p>

  <p>"Then I want to see what your little trick is capable of!"</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Emperor Ji stretched out his right hand, and the Starlight Tracking Spear appeared. He pointed his left hand at Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and then a beam of starlight fell and floated above the latter's head.</p>

  <p>"Eastern Emperor Taiyi!"</p>

  <p>Pearce and the other powerful warriors of the Taiyi Heaven Palace immediately panicked at the sight of the starlight.</p>

  <p>They had witnessed how Emperor Ji had used the Starlight Tracking Spear to kill many powerful warriors of the Taiyi Heaven Palace. Of course, they didn't want Eastern Emperor Taiyi to end up the same.</p>

  <p>However, they didn't have time to warn him. The Starlight Tracking Spear had already marked him.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Emperor Ji lifted his spear and disappeared.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Eastern Emperor Taiyi seemed to be still looking at the starlight above his head and thinking of a solution.</p>

  <p>As soon as Emperor Ji vanished, Eastern Emperor Taiyi rushed towards the front of the mountain wall with the Starlight Witness.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Just then, Emperor Ji appeared again and stabbed forward with his spear.</p>

  <p>With his strength, Eastern Emperor Taiyi would never be able to avoid an attack launched behind him. Moreover, this Eastern Emperor Taiyi was just a fake one.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>'Did I stab him?' Emperor Ji thought.</p>

  <p>But he quickly felt that something was wrong. He didn't feel like he had stabbed Eastern Emperor Taiyi. He looked into the distance and was shocked at what he saw.</p>

  <p>In front of him was a huge mountain wall, and his spear had bored a huge hole on its surface.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>There was already a crack on the Taiyi Mountain that continuously expanded. Now that a spear had struck it again, the crack extended even more. There was a rumbling sound, which meant that the mountain could collapse.</p>

  <p>"How did he dodge my attack?"</p>

  <p>Emperor Ji pulled out the Starlight Tracking Spear and looked at Eastern Emperor Taiyi above in disbelief.</p>

  <p>Even the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi couldn't avoid the attack of the Starlight Tracking Spear. How did this fake dodge it so quickly?</p>

  <p>"You..."</p>

  <p>The moment Emperor Ji opened his mouth, Eastern Emperor Taiyi shook his finger at him and said lightly, "The mark can be moved away.</p>

  <p>Your starlight is just a mark!"</p>

  <p>Emperor Ji stared at Eastern Emperor Taiyi with doubt. Suddenly, he raised the Starlight Tracking Spear and charged again.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>A second strike hit the Taiyi Mountain.</p>

  <p>The third strike...</p>

  <p>The fourth strike...</p>

  <p>Emperor Ji had missed his target in five strikes in a row.</p>

  <p>What made it even worse was that Eastern Emperor Taiyi had the chance to counter him while he attacked, but the former had no intention to do so.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi didn't make a move.</p>

  <p>In fact, he just let Emperor Ji stab into the mountain wall every time.</p>

  <p>"Is the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi so powerful?" Luo Zheng asked as he stared at the sky.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! We have lived for over a thousand chaotic eras. We are much more experienced than the clones," Houyi said. "I guess my clone is going to be furious," said the shadow of Emperor Ji above Luo Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>Although these clones had different experiences from their owners, their tempers and personalities were the same.</p>

  <p>For example, Emperor Ji was a serious and stubborn man, and his clone in the Source World was the same.</p>

  <p>Naturally, he couldn't stand someone tricking him in a battle.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the powerful warriors of the Taiyi Heaven Palace looked up and watched Eastern Emperor Taiyi constantly flash and dodge. All of them looked quite excited.</p>

  <p>After all, Emperor Ji had killed dozens of their peers. To say they hated him was an understatement.</p>

  <p>After five failed attacks in a row, Emperor Ji finally calmed down.</p>

  <p>Anger brewed in his dark eyes. He was on the verge of exploding with fury.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, Eastern Emperor Taiyi looked at him calmly.</p>

  <p>The real Eastern Emperor Taiyi had a good relationship with the real Emperor Ji in both the 77th chaos and the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Thus, he knew that the Emperor Ji in front of him was already quite enraged.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>After a moment of silence, Emperor Ji spread his wings and his body began to rapidly expand.</p>

  <p>"It's the Wild God Body..."</p>

  <p>Flamine said as her eyes narrowed into slits.</p>

  <p>In fact, by the end of ancient times, the embryos of the various super forces in the Source World had already formed.</p>

  <p>At that time, there existed the three magnates of the Ear Mouse race, the captain of the Black Ship, the Xuanyuan, the Divine Farmer, the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, Eastern Emperor Taiyi...</p>

  <p>Before the truth changed, these powerful warriors entered the Land of Bone Tribulation on the Other Shore with their Wild God Bodies. There, they obtained the Myriad Tribulations Bodies and subsequently improved their bodies.</p>

  <p>However, the cultivation of the Wild Gods had been prohibited since the middle ages, so the later generations weren't able to catch up with them.</p>

  <p>That was why even if there were many outstanding warriors born in the next generations, there was a natural defect in their physical bodies. The remedy to this defect was to absorb the Chaotic Source Spirits, but the Chaotic Source Spirits had their limits. Even if the younger warriors had reached the late stage of the Chaotic Source Realm, their abilities were still much far from those of the people like Emperor Ji and Fuxi.</p>

  <p>More importantly, there were two conditions to enter Stage Thirty-three.</p>

  <p>One was to enter the Soul City, and the other was to make it through the Land of Bone Tribulation. Therefore, no matter how hard the masters like Athemar, Goran, Winchell, and Phoenix worked, they couldn't enter Stage Thirty-three.</p>

  <p>Of course, they couldn't become the most powerful masters like Emperor Ji and Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>

  <p>Among the people of the Taiyi Heaven Palace, only Ying and Eastern Emperor Taiyi had been to Stage Thirty-three.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>Emperor Ji's body quickly expanded until he turned into a giant with wings and a height of one hundred thousand feet.</p>

  <p>He flapped his huge wings, and a hurricane formed.</p>

  <p>Stones, dust, and other debris flew and rolled around everywhere.</p>

  <p>"Are you serious?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi said with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>He also activated the Wild God Power and his body began to expand rapidly as well.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, he also turned into a giant of one hundred thousand feet in size, standing not far away from Emperor Ji.</p>

  <p>He stretched out his hand and grabbed in the air as he said, "Grow!"</p>

  <p>In turn, the Purple Rainbow Sword grew bigger and bigger.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi had forged the sword with a special material. It was originally six hundred and sixty thousand feet long, but after he forged it with a secret technique, he had shortened its length to six feet and six inches. Now, it had returned to its original size.</p>

  <p>At that point, Emperor Ji had completely lost his patience. His wings shook, and a scorching sun appeared behind him as he flew towards Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi slowly took a step back. The space around him quietly fluctuated, and he moved to a higher height.</p>

  <p>The war between the Wild Gods would easily hurt the innocent. He didn't want to involve Luo Zheng in the battle.</p>

  <p>After Emperor Ji missed his target, numerous blue squares emerged from his huge body, and he began to chase Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>

  <p>Just as he caught up to his opponent, a huge golden sword shadow appeared in the sky.</p>

  <p>The shadow was so big that it almost covered the dome above the Bloom Divine Province.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The shadow spun to the side and turned into dozens of golden swords.</p>

  <p>Then, those swords blocked the sky above the Bloom Divine Province.</p>

  <p>The tens of millions of creatures in the Bloom Divine Province were bathed in the golden light.</p>

  <p>As for Flamine, Feng Ge, and the others in the Phoenix Palace, they all covered their mouths when they saw the scene.</p>

  <p>It turned out that those were the Golden Rune Swords, which were activated by the bloodline power of Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>

  <p>In the past, when Eastern Emperor Taiyi had gone all out, he could only activate three Golden Rune Swords at most. Even then, such a move was still quite powerful, and the other powerful warriors in the Source World were very afraid of it.</p>

  <p>But now, the number of Golden Rune Swords in the sky was more than ten times bigger!</p>
