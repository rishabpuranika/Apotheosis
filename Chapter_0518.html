  <p>Perry's left eye would normally see two colors once he scanned a person's body: black and white.</p>

  <p>The black part would indicate a person's weakness.</p>

  <p>Everybody had their own weaknesses. Even the most unusual defensive cultivation method also had Achilles' heel. If the attack was focused on one's Achilles' heel, one would surely be in critical condition.</p>

  <p>But Perry's eye could only see white all over Luo Zheng's body. There was no hint of black part at all.</p>

  <p>?.</p>

  <p>The same thing had happened before. Perry could see the weakness of the opponent through his dicoria, but it wasn't the case all the time. If the opponent was too powerful like the masters at the top of the Illuminating Soul Realm or a high-rank defensive weapon, he wouldn't be able to see through.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng was just at grade 3 of the nature level. So why couldn't Perry see through him? Could it be that Luo Luo Zheng didn't have any weakness? Or because of his current cultivation level, he couldn't find Luo Zheng's weak point?</p>

  <p>Perry was having a hard time analyzing the situation.</p>

  <p>Perry's diplocoria was a powerful talent, unfortunately, he didn't have a high-level cultivating talent or a powerful soul. If his cultivation could reach the same level as Dick or Jill at Cloud Sect, with his diplocoria, he probably could advance at an equal pace with Tianming.</p>

  <p>After he was accepted by Prince Ray, he cultivated himself with all kinds of panacea and managed with an effort to enter the Illuminating Soul Realm. But with a shaky foundation, the method to forcefully promote his cultivation made it hard for him to make progress to reach a higher level in the future, so he would probably stay at the Illuminating Soul Realm all his life.</p>

  <p>But he mostly relied on his diplocoria talent, which was also the reason that he was valued by Prince Ray.</p>

  <p>However, he couldn't see through his opponent today which he found weird and alarming at the same time.</p>

  <p>What Perry didn't know was that after Luo Luo Zheng cultivated his body to a top-grade spiritual weapon, his weakness became too little. Perry could only see the weak point of a cultivator who was not on a higher level than the Illuminating Soul Realm, or the weapon which was under a low-grade spiritual weapon.</p>

  <p>"Perry, what are you doing? Haven't you seen this guy's weakness clearly yet? If you see clearly, just go and fight!" Someone shouted impatiently.</p>

  <p>Most of the guests present at the banquet knew about Perry's ability. His diplocoria was quite capable and he could see through the opponent's weakness at first glance. Any cultivator would be at a disadvantage if his weaknesses were visible to his opponent. Everyone was convinced about his talent in the beginning.</p>

  <p>They thought that Perry would go ballistic instantly after he took off his eyepatch. But unexpectedly, he stared blankly at Luo Luo Zheng. What happened?</p>

  <p>After a long while, Perry saluted to Luo Luo Zheng, "Sir, you are a special person. I am convinced!" After saying, Perry returned to his seat without looking back.</p>

  <p>"What's going on? Perry just admitted defeat? But they have just exchanged one move!"</p>

  <p>"Perry is not a coward. If there is a slim chance to turn the tables, he will insist. If he admits defeat, perhaps he is really inferior to the guy!"</p>

  <p>"Why does Luo Luo Zheng deserve Perry's compliment?"</p>

  <p>Ray was also surprised. Perry's strength was not the most powerful among all his guests, but it was difficult to find another talent with the same diplocoria as his in the world. If his cultivation was not too weak, he could absolutely be one of Ray's assistants.</p>

  <p>"Perry, can you explain why you admitted defeat?" Ray asked with a smile.</p>

  <p>Perry picked up a liquor cup on the table and chugged the liquor down, then replied, "I can't see through Luo Zheng's weakness. If my guess is right, he has a perfect body!"</p>

  <p>"A perfect body?" Ray was stunned.</p>

  <p>The people were also startled to hear what Perry said. This evaluation was too much.</p>

  <p>How could someone so perfect exist in the world? At most times, perfect was just an adjective. But for Luo Luo Zheng to have a perfect body, it seemed like a big joke for everyone.</p>

  <p>"I can't find any weakness in his body given that his cultivation is only grade 3 of the nature level! Your Highness, do you consider it as a perfect body?" Perry asked in reply cautiously.</p>

  <p>Ray understood Perry's words and nodded. When he looked at Luo Luo Zheng again, he got excited. What Perry said might not be true, but he would still bring in such a person as his subordinate.</p>

  <p>"Your Highness, please allow me to fight against him!" A silver-haired young man stood up.</p>

  <p>But this time, Luo Luo Zheng said, "Your Highness, I come here to see Sky Princess!"</p>

  <p>He was not afraid of fighting against many people one by one. In fact, until now, Luo Luo Zheng hadn't moved a single step or shown any of his real strength. However, he didn't come here to fight against Prince Ray's subordinates.</p>

  <p>"I understand, Luo Luo Zheng. I have sent someone to take Sky Princess here, but it will take some time. This man just wants to learn from you. Please accept it," Ray smiled. He had foreseen this point. Anyway, he was the only one who could bring Mu Ning here. If he wanted to forbid it, Luo Luo Zheng wouldn't see her.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng showed a long face and didn't say anything, but there was some annoyance in his eyes. If he wouldn't beat them hard, these guys probably wouldn't stop. While thinking, Luo Luo Zheng smiled, "If that's the case, please come up, Sir!"</p>

  <p>As the silver-haired young man came up, Luo Luo Zheng suddenly rose to fight.</p>

  <p>This time, Luo Luo Zheng lit up more than 50 dragon scales in his body and started the energy of the Phoenix Crystal on his right arm.</p>

  <p>After raising his speed, Luo Luo Zheng was like a nimble and rapid leopard cat. The young man thought Luo Luo Zheng would stand and resist the attack passively as he did in the last two rounds. But just as the young man prepared to make his move, Luo Luo Zheng was already close at hand.</p>

  <p>He was ready to resist Luo Zheng's attack unwillingly. But as soon as Luo Zheng's punch hit him, he changed his expression. The strength was as powerful as the tide in the sea, and he couldn't cope with it.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Only with one move, Luo Luo Zheng smashed the young man and he flew out. He crashed many pieces of furniture in the Feathery Star Hall where he landed.</p>

  <p>"How dare you!" Seeing what happened, someone shouted at Luo Luo Zheng angrily. This was not a formal combat. But Luo Luo Zheng didn't want to show mercy or respect.</p>

  <p>"What's the fuzz? You must prepare to be beaten before fighting with me. If you can't keep up with me, better not challenge me!" Luo Luo Zheng spoke coldly. If he kept saving his strength, the fight today probably wouldn't end.</p>

  <p>Ray still smiled, "Never mind. All of you just have fun today. Collateral damages can't be avoided when practicing." In Ray's opinion, it was better if they fought more intensely. Only in this way could they force Luo Luo Zheng to show his real strength.</p>

  <p>Since Ray said that, more people volunteered to fight Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"I want to have a fight!"</p>

  <p>Bang</p>

  <p>Another one was punched away by Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Please allow me to fight!"</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p id="top_16">One more was smashed away by Luo Zheng's fist.</p>

  <p>"Can I have a fight?"</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>...</p>

  <p>In just an hour, eight people were punched away by Luo Luo Zheng. He kept throwing punches ruthlessly.</p>

  <p>The first young man punched away by Luo Luo Zheng had no injuries. But the succeeding opponents were beaten up so bad that they spit blood or had broken bones. Prince Ray gave them expensive pills for recovery, but they needed to rest for ten to fifteen days to fully recover.</p>

  <p>In the end, nobody dared to challenge Luo Luo Zheng, and none of Prince Ray's young subordinates could defeat Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The old guys at the top of the Illuminating Soul Realm could defeat Luo Luo Zheng, but they didn't want to lower themselves to "learn from" him.</p>

  <p>After frightening Prince Ray's guests with his own method, Luo Luo Zheng saluted again and expressed in a cold voice, "Prince, if I can't see Sky Princess, I have to leave and look for her by myself!"</p>

  <p>However, Ray was still unhurried and seemed to see through Luo Luo Zheng. He nodded, "Luo Luo Zheng, I have something to show you. And after that, you can see her!"</p>

  <p>Afterward, Ray clapped his hands.</p>

  <p>In no time, a group of maids-in-waiting walked out from behind the palace with brocade boxes of different sizes in their hands.</p>

  <p>The group of maids-in-waiting was followed by three foreign almost nude ladies. The three ladies had nothing on except two bright silver pads to cover their boobs and lower parts.</p>

  <p>They looked different from the ladies in the Eastern Region?with sunken eyes, white skin, slender legs, and special styles. And because they were almost naked and walked with fascinating and mincing steps, they released a deadly charm to the male audience.</p>

  <p>As they walked out, all the men focused their eyes on them. Some men could not resist the temptation as their eyes turned red and their mouths started to dry.</p>

  <p>"Your Highness, what's the meaning of this?" Luo Luo Zheng frowned and questioned.</p>
