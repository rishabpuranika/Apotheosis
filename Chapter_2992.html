<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2992 Go To Hell </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The masters who had reached the Other Shore Realm more or less knew about the fusion of the Godly Ways.</p>

  <p>The fusion of the Godly Ways did increase the strength of the True Gods, but at that point there was a better choice for them, which was to reach the Other Shore. Who would waste time on this kind of a thing?</p>

  <p>Occasionally, there would be a few talents who tried to merge three to five Godly Ways, but these were just casual attempts. Their only goal was to test their own talents. Later, they would concentrate on the Truth of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>The pale-faced woman had never seen so many Godly Ways merged together. She estimated that there must be at least a thousand of them. She had never seen anyone in the Sword Light Palace who was able to cultivate so many Godly Ways.</p>

  <p>"Who the hell are fighting in the Excellence City?" the lord of the Excellence City demanded. He sped up and carried forward as he didn't care about the fusion of the Godly Ways.</p>

  <p>The small Excellence City was under his jurisdiction.</p>

  <p>After being thrown out by Zheng, Kenelm landed heavily on the ground.</p>

  <p>When he got up and looked around, he found that the place before him was enveloped in strong light.</p>

  <p>When the light gradually dissipated, his eyes widened in amazement. Not far away, Zheng stood still, and the green hand of the old man disappeared without a trace.</p>

  <p>'I can't believe that this guy is able to bear the theurgy of an opponent at the Other Shore Realm!' he thought in disbelief.</p>

  <p>The guards brought by Baber all took a deep breath. The seemingly inconspicuous consummate True God had single-handedly blocked Baber's attack. Baber had used his Other Shore Token and it was an all-out blow from a master at the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>Baber, who was standing in front of Zheng, was more shocked than anyone else. His Emerald Palm Shadow was also a good Other Shore Token. He was very confident of the power of the attack that he had just aimed at Zheng, but the attack was soon defended by the young warrior who was a mere True God.</p>

  <p>His face was as white as a sheet.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Zheng's expression was as calm as usual. After all, he had killed several warriors at the Other Shore Realm in the divine land. Even someone as powerful as Clement had been killed by Zheng. Of course, he had relied on the power of the divine land itself to kill Clement.</p>

  <p>However, just because Zheng was able to block the old man's attack did not mean he could win. He had no choice but to fight back just now.</p>

  <p>"Great! How dare you, a mere True God, challenge me!"</p>

  <p>Baber's countenance returned to normal, and a hint of danger was evident in his old eyes.</p>

  <p>Zheng lifted his feet, preparing to flee. He knew that the old man was serious.</p>

  <p>If he couldn't defeat the old man, he would have to escape.</p>

  <p>In truth, he was not really afraid of the old man. It was not easy for the old warrior to defeat Zheng either, especially since Zheng had the Latent Theurgies as hidden weapons.</p>

  <p>Just then, Kenelm suddenly rushed to stand between him and Zheng to protect Zheng. He shouted, "Zheng, you'd better flee quickly. I am responsible for this disaster after all, and it has nothing to do with you!"</p>

  <p>Zheng was slightly moved by Kenelm's gesture. Although Kenelm was not a powerful man, he was loyal to his friends.</p>

  <p>"Neither of you can leave!" Baber spat. How could he let them escape?</p>

  <p>He raised his hands gently and two green palm shadows appeared on his hands once more. The power that emanated from them was fiercer than before.</p>

  <p>Just as Baber was about to make his move, a woman in a cyan robe gently floated down from the air. Her pale lips parted, and she said weakly, "May I know who Kenelm Lai is? I have heard that he has obtained the personal effects of our deceased Stinger Guard."</p>

  <p>The look on Baber's face suddenly changed when he heard this voice.</p>

  <p>The Gracious Province was a small one, so they didn't have any super big force. The talented people in the province therefore hoped to join the Sword Light Palace in the neighboring province. The legend of the Stinger Guards had spread throughout the Gracious Province.</p>

  <p>When Baber got news from the Mice League, he also spotted the Stinger Guard's tomb and his cyan sword.</p>

  <p>His purpose of coming to Kenelm was to avenge his grandson. But at the same time, he also needed to find the Stinger Guard's personal effects.</p>

  <p>However, this was a serious matter, so he would not share this information with others.</p>

  <p>However, people from the Sword Light Palace arrived before he could kill Kenelm. It all happened so fast!</p>

  <p>Baber frowned and made an instant decision. He stretched out his hands gently, and those two dark green hand shadows crawled towards Kenelm like two great pythons. It was obvious that the old man planned to kill Kenelm before the people from the Sword Light Palace found out who Kenelm was.</p>

  <p>However, Kenelm was such a stubborn man that he would rather die than drag Zheng into this. He stayed put, unwilling to leave.</p>

  <p>Zheng was about to throw Kenelm out again when the eyes of the woman flashed slightly. No one saw her use any theurgy, but the two green palm shadows released by Baber vanished without a trace.</p>

  <p>This kind of turn of events was quite strange, and even Zheng was stunned.</p>

  <p>The pale-faced woman glanced at Baber and said angrily, "Trying to kill someone in front of me? How dare you! Fine! Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>Everyone heard her weak voice. It was a voice that didn't make them feel threatened, but instead it soothed them.</p>

  <p>But it had the opposite effect on Baber. She intended to kill him, though this was the first time they had met.</p>

  <p>He paused for a while before raising his head and announcing, "I'm from the Qi Clan of the Flame City..."</p>

  <p>As words left his mouth, he felt a slight shiver. The ashen woman stretched out three fingers to touch him. She said softly, "I won't listen to your nonsense!"</p>

  <p>When she gently pinched her fingers, the sound of the mirror smashing was heard by everyone.</p>

  <p>Baber's body crumbled into several pieces like a porcelain vase and scattered on the ground.</p>

  <p>It was indeed a miserable death, but not even a single drop of blood was shed. If one looked at his broken body carefully, they would see that the cuts on the flesh were as smooth as a mirror.</p>

  <p>The guards of Qi Clan, who were watching the entire drama, were so shocked that they didn't even dare to breathe.</p>

  <p>Even Baber himself had no room for resistance, how could the guards dare to move?</p>

  <p id="top_10">Kenelm, too, was stunned. He didn't answer the woman until she fell from the air. "I...I am Kenelm Lai. And the Stinger Guard's personal effects are here," he stuttered.</p>

  <p>He quickly removed the cyan sword from his space ring, walked two steps forward and presented it to the woman.</p>

  <p>The woman took the cyan sword and held it in her hands for a while. She gently rubbed the blade with her bloodless fingers.</p>

  <p>Although the cyan sword was very old, it was still sharp and immediately cut her finger.</p>
