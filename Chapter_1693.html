  <p>
</p>

  <p>Creak!</p>

  <p>Lawson looked like a demon incarnate as he swung his fist with maximum power.</p>

  <p>The speed of his strike was also no joke. Sharp wind blades surrounded his fist as it got closer to its target. Luckily, the surrounding space within the picture was stable. If Lawson's punch had been done in the outside world, it would most probably tear a huge hole in the fabric of space.</p>

  <p>The Lie Clan had a special training method.</p>

  <p>This method involved the use of their supreme divine weapon: the Hidden Phoenix Dragon Basin.</p>

  <p>This amazing basin spanned ten feet in both height and diameter. It was usually filled to the brim with the blood of all kinds of precious beasts.</p>

  <p>Rare and precious beast blood wasn't normally suitable for absorption since it was either extremely toxic or too unbearable to take in.</p>

  <p>However, this Hidden Phoenix Dragon Basin was able to convert the blood into something suitable for human consumption while still preserving the special properties of the blood essence.</p>

  <p>Every year, the Lie Clan would send out their people to gather beast blood. In fact, many of their sacred places would already have some in store, ready to offer as tribute to the clan.</p>

  <p>The blood was collected and then dumped into the basin. Not everyone could soak in this basin. Only those with high enough qualifications could avail of such a high honor. The Lie Clan was very particular in choosing who could bathe in the basin. They would sometimes extend the honor to lords of supreme worlds or anyone of equal or higher positions. Choosing who got to bathe in the basin was a big deal.</p>

  <p>Not even the leader of the Lie Clan could casually enter the Hidden Phoenix Dragon Basin to soak in beast blood.</p>

  <p>The only ones who could bathe in it without any restrictions were the clan patriarch and Lawson.</p>

  <p>However, the clan patriarch had already become a Supreme Lord. The Hidden Phoenix Dragon Basin wasn't really of much use to him now, but it was still greatly beneficial to Lawson.</p>

  <p>Over the past ten years, Lawson had greatly taken advantage of his unrestricted access to the basin by soaking in it for four to six hours every single day. This habit led to the extreme enhancement of his tendons, blood, bones, and flesh.</p>

  <p>Lawson's entire body had been greatly strengthened by his daily blood baths. There was probably no other ace talent or Godly Genius who possessed a physique as excellent as his.</p>

  <p>He wanted to kill Luo Luo Zheng with a single punch because he knew he could do so.</p>

  <p>However, despite the threat of an extremely strong blow from his opponent, Luo Luo Zheng stood in place. His eyes were calm and there was no trace of distress on his face.</p>

  <p>The Stellar Body was a Transcendent Divine Might that drew its power from the stars. As the number of stars that Luo Luo Zheng could communicate with increased, so did his power.</p>

  <p>"I will not back down from this punch!"</p>

  <p>A blinding stream of pure starlight spiraled around his arm and condensed in his fist.</p>

  <p>If this fight took place in the past, he would've let out a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>Fighting with brute force was his forte, so any opponent who used his fists instead of his weapon would've been such a welcome change.</p>

  <p>However, times had changed and Luo Luo Zheng was not relaxed at all.</p>

  <p>The universe was too big.</p>

  <p>His opponent was a talent who had stood out among the trillions of warriors in this boundless universe.</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng had heaven-defying luck, Lawson wasn't far behind. The young man also had a huge power backing him. His foundation was also nothing to scoff at. The Lie Clan had seen to his growth and gave him the necessary resources to make him stronger than anyone else.</p>

  <p>Caution did not necessarily equate to fear though. Luo Luo Zheng had just assessed his opponent's strength and deemed it worth being wary of. He knew Lawson was strong, so he wanted to reveal the best of his abilities too.</p>

  <p>Was he going to use the Multiple Stars Brilliance? No, not for this fight.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng intended to use another Stellar Body move in dealing with Lawson.</p>

  <p>"Dark Star Devouring!"</p>

  <p>A gentle whirlpool of starlight appeared from the condensed power in his fist.</p>

  <p>This technique seemed far less powerful than Lawson's.</p>

  <p>However, the Stellar Body represented the endless starry sky. It was a space that was even bigger than the seemingly boundless sea.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>At first, everyone thought Lawson held the absolute advantage as he came at Luo Luo Zheng with his powerful punch.</p>

  <p>However, the moment their fists collided, a strange scene appeared in front of everyone's eyes.</p>

  <p>The whirlpool of starlight caught Lawson's fist as if he had punched through another dimension.</p>

  <p>Everyone was rendered speechless by what they had just witnessed. At that moment, however, it was probably Lawson who was the most surprised.</p>

  <p>It never ended well for anyone who ever dared to face him.</p>

  <p>He was well aware of Luo Zheng's tricks and his craftiness. He had been prepared for this guy to dodge his punch or to pull some kind of gimmick at the last moment.</p>

  <p>He never expected Luo Luo Zheng to face him head-on!</p>

  <p>Not only that, but Luo Zheng's counterattack was also very strange.</p>

  <p>It didn't feel that powerful, but it was clear to Lawson that his fist had been cleanly swallowed by Luo Zheng's starlight whirlpool.</p>

  <p>The Dark Star was one of the countless stars in this universe.</p>

  <p>The Dark Star Devouring was a Stellar Body move that required the activation of this specific heavenly body.</p>

  <p>If a star was a bright ball of heavenly light, the Dark Star was the complete opposite. It was a star that constantly devoured anything that came close its vicinity.</p>

  <p>It had a counterpart which was called the Light Star that constantly spat out and expelled objects from within.</p>

  <p>The number of Dark Stars was equal to the number of Light Stars.</p>

  <p>Whatever was taken in must be expelled out the other end. A few mighty warriors used these two kinds of stars as a transportation channel. It was easier said than done because a warrior's body must be able to withstand the extreme pressure if he wanted to utilize these stars to travel through the star fields.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had coincidentally activated a Dark Star a few years ago, which allowed him to learn this move.</p>

  <p>No matter how strong Lawson's punch was, it was still dissolved by the whirlpool that had appeared in front of Luo Zheng's fist.</p>

  <p>A faint smile appeared on Luo Zheng's face. It was his turn now.</p>

  <p>Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!</p>

  <p>He launched his counterattack in an instant!</p>

  <p>The whirlpool that had swallowed up Lawson's fist began to spin in the opposite direction.</p>

  <p id="top_13">"Light Star Ejecting!"</p>

  <p>The Dark Star Devouring essentially devoured the force of Lawson's fist, but the Light Star Ejecting did the exact opposite.</p>

  <p>It brought the power of his punch right back at him. The earlier force from his fist was enough to destroy a 10, 000-mile mountain range.</p>

  <p>That wasn't all.</p>

  <p>As the Light Star Ejecting brought Lawson's force towards him, Luo Luo Zheng also unleashed his own strength.</p>

  <p>The strength of 40, 000 dragon scales!</p>

  <p>It was a counterattack fused with two layers of power.</p>

  <p>Lawson had originally planned to kill Luo Luo Zheng with a single punch, but it seemed the tables had now turned.</p>

  <p>He hadn't been wrong though.</p>

  <p>Had Luo Luo Zheng not done any kind of strange move or used any special technique, then Lawson would've surely won this fight.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng had used a strange and special technique, and now Lawson was going to suffer the consequences.</p>

  <p>It was simply impossible for him to escape.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>The tremendous force caused the Heaven Earth Board to crumble underneath Luo Luo Zheng as his fist smashed into Lawson's.</p>

  <p>At the exact moment their fists bumped, Lawson's arm began to disintegrate into tiny pieces. It was as if his flesh and blood had been burned and scattered into the air like ashes.</p>

  <p>His body that had been nurtured by the blood in the Hidden Phoenix Dragon Basin was turned to ashes by this terrifying power.</p>

  <p>"I..."</p>

  <p>He opened his mouth to say something.</p>

  <p>He wanted to shout that he shouldn't have ended up like this.</p>

  <p>This body refining technique wasn't his strongest move. He still had a lot of tricks and moves to show.</p>

  <p>Killing Luo Luo Zheng would've been easy if he used his strongest method.</p>

  <p>But it was too late now. What a pity!</p>

  <p>There was no medicine for regret.</p>

  <p>As the saying went, "If I know what will happen in the next second, then no one will be my enemy."</p>

  <p>If a warrior had the power to predict his opponent's move, then he would be unmatched in the entire universe.</p>

  <p>Just a peek at the next second would be enough leverage for a warrior to win in a fight.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Lawson did not have such amazing capabilities.</p>

  <p>Even with the help of the Time Law, the most one could do was make time go slower. Nobody had the power to see into the future or retrace their steps back to the past.</p>

  <p>At least in this universe.</p>

  <p>Lawson's body peeled off and dispersed in the wind until there was nothing left.</p>

  <p>In the end, Luo Luo Zheng was the only man left standing.</p>

  <p>The warriors were all stunned at the result of this fight.</p>

  <p>"This is the person known to be only second to Nathan, the favorite of the competition?</p>

  <p>He was literally smashed into smithereens by Luo Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>Isn't the gap between the two of them too big?" someone exclaimed.</p>

  <p>It wasn't just him. The other warriors also thought this way.</p>

  <p>There were always so many variables when Godly Geniuses fought, but why was it that the fight was finished so quickly? Everyone expected this fight to last at least ten minutes.</p>

  <p>To their surprise, it only took an exchange of blows for Luo Luo Zheng to be declared the winner.</p>

  <p>It was just truly absurd! Many warriors in the audience simply didn't know how to react.</p>

  <p>However, there were some warriors who sighed but were not entirely surprised by the results. Lawson was known only second to Nathan, so his strength couldn't be too weak. The problem was he had chosen the wrong way to deal with Luo Luo Zheng.</p>
