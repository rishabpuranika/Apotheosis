<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3470 The Incarnation Of The Evil Will </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Black Ship advanced, without making any stops.</p>

  <p>It didn't matter how many ships there were. Only thirteen people were qualified to join the Black Ship.</p>

  <p>Usman used to be a member of the Black Ship.</p>

  <p>His strength was ranked thirteenth when he joined the Black Ship.</p>

  <p>But he rose through the ranks in just a short period of time. Before long, he was ranked so high that the only person above him was the captain. He had become second best.</p>

  <p>The Black Ship had, at the time, seen its best days, until Usman betrayed them and killed six other members.</p>

  <p>The captain had chased Usman for a long time, even making a concession to let some super forces work together to kill him.</p>

  <p>But that was all history. And since it was related to the Black Ship, news about it hadn't spread out.</p>

  <p>Shera had always felt regretful. If not for Usman's madness that had infuriated the captain and led to his doom, he probably could have taken over the position of captain, and even become the strongest man in the Source World.</p>

  <p>Once Usman had been executed, Shera and the others realized that his birth wasn't a coincidence.</p>

  <p>He was the embodiment of the resentment and hatred of the entire Source World. And because of this aura that he exuded, he was suitable to join the Black Ship. In addition to his astonishing talent and luck, he was also destructive. Chances were high that he would do something harmful to the Black Ship.</p>

  <p>"You mean the Evil God is also the embodiment of the resentment in a world?" Shera asked, surprised.</p>

  <p>In retrospect, there were many similarities between the Evil God and Usman. Their expressions, aura, style, and even madness were the same.</p>

  <p>But the Evil God was at a level lower than Usman.</p>

  <p>On second thought, Shera added, "But he's from the inner world of a man called Luo Zheng, not the Source World!"</p>

  <p>This alone was enough to deny the captain's conjecture.</p>

  <p>The brass man smiled and said, "What if Luo Zheng's inner world is a primitive land?"</p>

  <p>Shera trembled, her red eyes wide. "Is that even possible?"</p>

  <p>The brass man didn't want to waste time arguing with her. He just said, "It's a pity that the Evil God has been collected by his creator. But to be honest, it's difficult for us to control a guy like him. If he becomes powerful one day, there's a chance that he will turn against us and hurt us as Usman did."</p>

  <p>The people of the Black Ship were crazy, but not as crazy as the Evil God.</p>

  <p>He had found the Civilization Artifact that he merged with by himself, but he had burned it without hesitation. He was even more ruthless than Usman had been.</p>

  <p>Shera was torn.</p>

  <p>Back then, she had been infatuated with Usman. And since the Evil God was eerily similar to Usman, she felt drawn to supporting him.</p>

  <p>She had been disappointed when Luo Zheng had taken the Evil God back. She hesitated before saying, "Shall we investigate Luo Zheng?"</p>

  <p>The Black Ship didn't hate Luo Zheng. But now that the Evil God was taken back, it seemed to be a good choice to target him.</p>

  <p>"He is a disciple of the Taiyi Heaven Palace, and it's not wise to offend Eastern Emperor Taiyi. End of story. Maybe the captain has his own plan.</p>

  <p>By the way, the rings that were taken away by the Thunder Dimorphodon are connected to the Other Shore. Should we take action now?" the brass man asked, pulling Shera out of her reverie.</p>

  <p>"We'd better not do anything now. We can intercept the Thunder Dimorphodon once it escapes smoothly," she said, shaking herself out of her thoughts.</p>

  <p>"What if Fuxi doesn't let it go?" the brass man asked.</p>

  <p>"Then give up," Shera said resolutely, her red eyes flashing.</p>

  <p>Offending the Thunder Dimorphodon was better than offending the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and the Evil God, along with Fuxi and the Thunder Dimorphodon, had destroyed the core area, leaving only one third of the magic arrays intact.</p>

  <p>Once the disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace, members of the Li Shan mountain, and the Nine Li people had gotten enough crystals of the Chaotic Source Spirits, they had entered the arrays with satisfaction and began to merge with the crystals.</p>

  <p>"Brother, let me do it first!" said Sally with a smile.</p>

  <p>A magic array could accommodate a lot of people, but only one person was allowed to merge with the crystals of Chaotic Source Spirits at a time.</p>

  <p>The Nine Li people like Sally and Hutton were satisfied.</p>

  <p>Even though their journey to the Chaotic Source World had been extremely dangerous and they had almost died several times, they had still obtained what they had dreamed of in a very simple manner. This was the best that the remaining members of the Nine Li race could have hoped for.</p>

  <p>Hutton was thinking much more than Sally was.</p>

  <p>Everything that Luo Zheng had previously shown them was beyond their imagination. Hutton, on seeing the battle between Luo Zheng and the Evil God, could no longer tell just how strong Luo Zheng actually was.</p>

  <p>What would his grandpa think if he knew this?</p>

  <p>Sally, on the other hand, wasn't thinking about that. She sat down cross-legged and put all the crystals of the Chaotic Source Spirits into her inner world.</p>

  <p>There were many ways to absorb the crystals of the Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>After swallowing them, one could force them into their limbs and internal organs. Or they could absorb them into the inner world, and then let them slip down the meridians.</p>

  <p>The bloodiest way was to press the crystals into the body, one by one.</p>

  <p>Pressing two hundred crystals into one's body would obviously create a bloody mess.</p>

  <p>Even though Sally had chosen the easiest way, the crystals that were the size of a little finger would still cause huge damage when they moved through her meridians while causing her immense pain. Her face scrunched in pain as she endured the process.</p>

  <p>It was not until all the crystals of Chaotic Source Spirits were equally spaced that Sally activated the magic array.</p>

  <p>She was almost immediately surrounded by light.</p>

  <p>The arrays in the Chaotic Source World could catalyze the crystals of the Chaotic Source Spirits and completely merge them with the body.</p>

  <p>The fusion was permanent. The catalyzed crystals had become a part of the body, different from the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits and the queen ant that Luo Zheng had met.</p>

  <p>Therefore, even if a cultivator at the Chaotic Source Realm was killed, no one could take the crystals of Chaotic Source Spirits out from their body.</p>

  <p>Sally's frown began to relax under the effect of the magical array. The crystals that had been planted in her body softened gradually and turned into soybean-sized light spots in her limbs and bones, becoming a part of her body.</p>

  <p>Sally had previously been able to only draw her Other Shore Power to the Iridescent Stone. The power of the Iridescent Stone could reach over a thousand divine megatons when it fully erupted, but she had been unable to draw such a large amount of power to her body.</p>

  <p>Similarly, even if Luo Zheng were to fully activate the power of the Strength God Totem before entering the Chaotic Source World, his physical body would not be able to bear it.</p>

  <p>But after fusing with the crystals of the Chaotic Source Spirits, they could control the Other Shore Power more easily.</p>

  <p>Many cultivation methods that needed to borrow the Other Shore Power could also be freely displayed, instead of just relying on the Other Shore Tokens of descending type.</p>
