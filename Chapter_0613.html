<br/><br/>

  

  <p>When Luo Zheng had entered the Cloud Hall, he honestly wanted to keep out of trouble. He still needed time to think about what he had obtained in the Cloud Road. The best thing to do was to focus on practice and stay away from any distractions.</p>

  <p>However, Tia obviously didn't let him have his way. She had done a bit of a trick.</p>

  <p>The real strength she exhibited in the Cloud Road was only at the level of Illuminating Soul Realm. According to the cyan dragon, she had drawn out her original cultivation base and started over. Since she had just returned to the Cloud Hall only recently, it was impossible for her to level up so rapidly. Thus, Luo Zheng assumed that there must be some Cloud Hall masters who had her back and did a trick to control his body.</p>

  <p>'This hateful woman! Is she going to ruin me?' Luo Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>Then again, he had already made a spectacle, so he had to face the consequences. This was Tia's scheme--she took him by surprise, so now he couldn't escape. Besides, even if he wanted to escape, there was no way he could evade trouble now.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Frank raised his eyebrows and his eyes glinted fiercely.</p>

  <p>He had never hated on anyone since he started to practice in the Cloud School. He had always given off the impression of a young, handsome gentleman and he seemed to have a special Mu Ning around him.</p>

  <p>He never got issues with the others because he never paid attention to those on the same level as him. Moreover, he certainly didn't take whatever they did to him to heart.</p>

  <p>When it came to Luo Zheng however, Frank found it hard to be open-minded.</p>

  <p>He had always thought that he was the best of the best and the most fortunate among everyone. He thought that no one in the same level could be on par with him. However, the journey on the Cloud Road was a big blow for him. He never thought that a strong opponent came from a mere second-grade sect. Based on Zheng's talents or potential, it was highly possible that he might surpass Frank in the future.</p>

  <p>Frank thought that he was the most gifted and talented in the Cloud Hall ever since it was established. He would never allow anyone like Luo Zheng to threaten his position. Thus, he had long planned to find a chance to cause trouble for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Firstly, he wanted to force Luo Zheng to tell him the secret of the Cloud Road.</p>

  <p>Secondly, Luo Zheng had a lot of Devil Phantom essences with him. How did such precious things fall into the hands of a nobody from the Eastern Region? Wasn't that a big waste of the treasure?</p>

  <p>On that day when his father Emanuel had questioned Luo Zheng, Emanuel suddenly received a message through the message rune. He retreated after he got the message, which was strange. Frank had no idea what had happened. But since his father didn't explain anything, he planned to get what he wanted all by himself.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, do you think that you can do anything you want with what you achieved in the Cloud Road? You're not qualified to teach me!"</p>

  <p>Frank's shoe roughly scratched the ground as he stood in an offensive stance. "If you don't believe this," Frank started, lifting his white spear as he pointed it towards Luo Zheng. "Then the spear in my hand will make you believe!"</p>

  <p>Cultivators who sparred with each other for practice and skills improvement seldom directed the point of a spear or a sword at their opponents. It was provocative. Unless it was a real battle or the person just hated his opponent, nobody would act so imprudently in usual cases.</p>

  <p>Frank had felt like the latter. Even if Luo Zheng had shown how strong he was, he was still nothing to Frank.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng cast a cold look at the spear's pointed end. Frank's spear was quite powerful. He realized that this battle was inevitable. Patrick's Green Lotus Karma Fire failed to just burn the Flying Yaksha's skin, but Frank had killed it with his long spear.</p>

  <p>"Fair enough. It's true that it's not my place to decide who can teach a lesson to whom, so let's see if your spear can have the say over my sword," Luo Zheng calmly said as he slowly drew out his Blood Drinking Sword.</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished his words, he struck first to gain the upper hand.</p>

  <p>He stood in a very strange stance and charged with the equally strange Sword Steps. The Blood Drinking Sword cut into the air and shot straight at Frank.</p>

  <p>The spear's advantage lay in its length. "What made one thing stand above others could be summed up to four short words--a little bit more," as the saying went. It was why Luo Zheng had struck first. He wanted to quickly get close to Frank to engage him in a dogfight.</p>

  <p>However, Frank had practiced with the spear for over a decade. How could he not know what Luo Zheng had thought?</p>

  <p>He swiftly turned and made a gesture of attacking. The spear energy suddenly appeared and formed a solid wall, then its irresistible force attacked Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>It was impossible for Luo Zheng to dodge the spear energy, no matter how fast or strong his movements were. Thus, he had no choice but to back down.</p>

  <p>The attack drew a distance between them, so there was enough room for Frank to use his spear in any way he wanted. He wielded it more fiercely as the spear's point flashed silver lights. It constantly charged at Zheng's chest, but Luo Zheng had managed to dodge it with his Sword Steps.</p>

  <p>"Air Stab!"</p>

  <p>"Cycle Stab!"</p>

  <p>"Spiral Stab!"</p>

  <p>Frank swung his spear around and did three movements in a row. He rushed aggressively towards Luo Zheng as the long spear sliced through the air and stirred up a gust of wind.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng grew more cautious as he fought against Frank's quick moves and excellent spear techniques. He constantly used the circle parry to deflect Frank's attacks. However, the building space was limited, and every move Frank did with his spear came too close at Luo Zheng. Thus, Luo Zheng was forced to back down a lot, and was finally cornered when Frank used the three consecutive spear movements.</p>

  <p>Frank's eyes glittered with smugness. He had already gauged Zheng's real strength through the test on the Cloud Road. Luo Zheng was stronger than Tianming, and a little stronger than Patrick. Compared to him however, Luo Zheng still fell behind.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng had already entered the Illuminating Soul Realm, Frank wasn't sure if he could beat him. Unfortunately�</p>

  <p>This guy was too impatient. Luo Zheng was only a nature creature but he dared to challenge Frank. He had recklessly courted death!</p>

  <p>Since he asked for it anyway, Frank decided to satisfy him and make him know how defeat felt.</p>

  <p>"Super Spinning Spear!" Frank shouted.</p>

  <p>He suddenly flew into the air. His body and his spear became one. Then he rushed forward at Luo Zheng who was driven to a dead end.</p>
