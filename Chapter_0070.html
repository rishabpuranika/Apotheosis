<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 70 Hell Mountain (Part One) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The book in Luo Zheng's hands was on fist position. It depended a lot on attacking skills.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng turned to the first page gingerly. What?caught his?eyes was that the page was filled with small and closely-written words. Luo Luo Zheng soon realized that this was a translation of Ogre language.</p>

  <p>The knowledge in this book apparently came from the Ogres, and someone had the skills to translate Ogre language. Luo Luo Zheng was clueless as to who could have translated the text.</p>

  <p>'As per the words, is this a cultivation method for Ogres?'?Luo Luo Zheng was puzzled.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Ogre Body Refining formulation was?a cultivation method for Ogres only.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng knew that cultivation methods for Ogres were highly demanding. To practice them, a person would require strong?physical strength.</p>

  <p>As it was known to all, the strength of the human body would improve greatly after the body had been refined. However, compared to Ogres, humans were still far weaker. The body of an Ogre, obviously, was not on the same level as a human.</p>

  <p>For example, the physical strength of humans at the bone refining level was about the same as that of a four or five-year-old Ogre child.</p>

  <p>Of course, this was just for general people, not Luo Luo Zheng. Evil Lan had refined his body, and the strength of Luo Zheng's body was now comparable to a top grade mysterious weapon.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the demanding body strength?required to practice this cultivation method might be an impossible threshold for most humans, but not for Luo Luo Zheng. It was tailored for him for sure.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng put the Heavenly Ogre Fist book into the space ring and left the chamber.</p>

  <p>When he re-entered the hall for tier 4 cultivation method, Luo Luo Zheng found that an old man dressed in white was looking at him with bright eyes.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng studied the old man. He stood with his hands clasped behind his back, graceful and noble. Luo Luo Zheng felt relieved because he did not sense any hostility from the old man.</p>

  <p>"The power of the Heavenly Ogre Fist is great. But it is extremely demanding on a human's body strength. It is also difficult to cultivate. I am sure you know this. It can be said that your soul's strength is far superior to others as you entered the passageway and returned. If your soul is strong enough, you can choose?methods like the Dark Meditation and Blood Kill. Why would you choose Heavenly Ogre Fist? You know this is a very complicated method for human beings."</p>

  <p>The old man spoke to Luo Luo Zheng in a faint voice.</p>

  <p>"I saw that this cultivation method was placed behind the hall for tier 4 cultivation method. So, I believe it to be more powerful than tier 4 cultivation method..." Luo Luo Zheng replied truthfully. He was not good at lying, and so, he decided to share his reason for selecting the cultivation method with the old man.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's honesty surprised the old man since he did not expect Luo Luo Zheng to be so forthcoming. Then the old man shook his head and said, "It is true that the two books inside the tomb are far stronger than tier 4 cultivation method, but you should practice the cultivation method that suits you.</p>

  <p>You should understand this. I think you had better return the Heavenly Ogre Fist, and choose another one. What do you think?"</p>

  <p>To Luo Luo Zheng, it sounded like the old man?was trying to persuade him not to take Heavenly Ogre Fist. But then again, since he had?chosen this book, and he had not violated any rules, Luo Luo Zheng was unwilling to return the book.</p>

  <p>So, instead of giving the old man a straight answer, Luo Luo Zheng changed the subject and asked, "Is it really far stronger than tier 4 cultivation method? I have heard that all?cultivation methods in the world are divided into four tiers. How can Heavenly Ogre Fist be stronger than tier 4 cultivation methods?" Luo Luo Zheng tried to sound innocent as he put forward this question.</p>

  <p>The old man?smiled a little. He seemed to see through Luo Zheng's trick. "Since you are unwilling to return Heavenly Ogre Fist, then take it as per your wish. As for your question pertaining to the four tiers of cultivation methods, that is what we tell ordinary people. We live in a mysterious world. Its secrets are endless. How can cultivation methods be limited to just four tiers? The book in your hand is a tier 5 cultivation method from the Ogres."</p>

  <p>Tier 5 cultivation method! Luo Luo Zheng was surprised, and his eyes opened wide.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had thought that tier 4 cultivation method was the highest level.</p>

  <p>What he did not expect was that there was tier 5?cultivation method.</p>

  <p>This was beyond his expectation.</p>

  <p>Seeing Luo Zheng's reaction, the old man was not surprised at all. He laughed again. "The higher you stand, the further you can see. Let me tell you.</p>

  <p>The tier 5 cultivation method may not necessarily be the strongest method."</p>

  <p>"Is there a cultivation method much stronger than tier 5 cultivation? method?" Luo Luo Zheng asked excitedly.</p>

  <p>This time, the old man did not answer his question directly. He gave a vague response, "There are no boundaries in humans' capability." As the old man spoke, he placed a finger on Luo Zheng's chest and continued, "Let us not discuss this. Since you have chosen the Heavenly Ogre Fist and insist on keeping it, I will not stop you. This book has been here for a long time. And I never thought that an outer disciple would be capable of taking it. I feel that perhaps it is fate that led you to this book. But this cultivation method involves?many other factors. If someone outside asks you what?you have taken," the old man stopped speaking for long enough to wave at the cultivation method hall. A book from the cabinet flew over to them. With the book in hand, the old man continued, "You should tell them that this is what you have chosen."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng took the?book from the old man and turned it around in his hand. As he looked at the book, Luo Zheng's eyes brightened when he saw the words, Spiritual Thorn, on the cover.</p>

  <p>There were so many books on tier 4 cultivation method on the bookcase in this hall. Luo Luo Zheng had not expected that he would get an opportunity to take two. Luo Luo Zheng laughed with joy before placing the book inside the space ring.</p>

  <p>Then Luo Luo Zheng looked at the old man and thanked him by cupping his hands (left over right) and raising them chest high as a salute. After that, Luo Luo Zheng turned with the intention of leaving the hall.</p>

  <p>Before he could take a step, the old man stopped him, "Wait, you... aren't you curious about my identity?"</p>

  <p>"What?" Luo Luo Zheng stopped and turned to face the old man. In all this time, he had not thought to ask the old man his name. Luo Luo Zheng raised his hand and slapped it on his forehead. "Please forgive my lack of manners. You are..."</p>
