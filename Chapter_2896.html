<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>During the chase of the Chaos Winged Beast, Hamish's messages reached the flying ship one after another.</p>

  <p>Clement already had a general understanding of the divine land, and he was sensitive to the news.</p>

  <p>The capture of the Chaos Winged Beast was a sizable contribution to the Bear race, but Clement treated the achievement like it was nothing.</p>

  <p>If he had known it would take so long to capture the Chaos Winged Beast, he wouldn't have gotten himself involved in the first place.</p>

  <p>He was pleasantly surprised to luckily stumble upon the ship when he pursued the Chaos Winged Beast to the bottom of the chaos. If he managed to bring the divine land to the Source World, it would be a great honor to him, and he might get rewarded by the Yellow Thearch.</p>

  <p>"Thud!"</p>

  <p>Clement again knocked on the bell in his palm.</p>

  <p>"Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!"</p>

  <p>Three more blood arrows shot out from the blood runes.</p>

  <p>The Chaos Winged Beast was familiar with the attacks of the blood runes. It executed a somersault in the air to avoid the three blood arrows.</p>

  <p>However, the attack of the blood runes was not that easy to dodge.</p>

  <p>"Puff, puff, puff..."</p>

  <p>The body of the Chaos Winged Beast was riddled with holes, and one of the blood arrows pierced through its neck.</p>

  <p>Strength all but gone, the beast could no longer lift its head, only flying with its head hanging and a low hiss of breath issuing from its mouth. Its flight speed had drastically slowed down. Evidently, the creature had no more energy left.</p>

  <p>"Well then, I'll leave the rest to you." Clement glanced at the Chaos Winged Beast indifferently and then put away the bell.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Godfrey remained in communication with the divine land.</p>

  <p>With a flick of his wrist, a Yellow Emperor Magatama appeared in Clement's hand.</p>

  <p>Compared to Godfrey's, Clement's Yellow Emperor Magatama was much more exquisite.</p>

  <p>As he activated the Yellow Emperor Magatama, Clement said, "I'm Clement. Who's your leader?"</p>

  <p>In the divine land, the intermittent sounds suddenly became clear, and Clement's voice finally reached Leyton and Hamish.</p>

  <p>"Master Clement! It's Master Clement!"</p>

  <p>Leyton's face registered pleased surprise, while Hamish beside him was confused. He had never heard of Clement before then.</p>

  <p>However, upon seeing how excited Leyton was, Hamish surmised that Clement was no ordinary person, so he dared not to ask questions.</p>

  <p>"I'm Leyton, a three-star Yellow Emperor Guard," Leyton said as self-introduction.</p>

  <p>Clement continued, "If there aren't powerhouses at the Other Shore Realm in the divine land, why do you have to ask for help?"</p>

  <p>In Clement's perspective, Leyton and the other Yellow Emperor Guards could have just brought the divine land back to the Source World secretly to get rewards. After all, the Yellow Emperor Guards also competed with each other fiercely.</p>

  <p>Since they chose to ask for help, they must have come across some trouble.</p>

  <p>Clement was a very cautious person. Although he was confident in his own power, anything could happen in the vast chaos, especially since the divine land was built by Chiyou. Although he had been nailed to death, Chiyou could still kill several warriors at the Other Shore Realm in the divine land with the ease of killing flies if he so desired. Clement wouldn't deliberately put himself in harm's way.</p>

  <p>Leyton instantly understood what Clement meant. He said, "At first, we didn't need your help. However, another group of warriors at the Other Shore Realm suddenly appeared outside the divine land. There was a five-star Nine Li Guard among them."</p>

  <p>"A five-star Nine Li Guard?" Clement asked, an eyebrow slightly raised.</p>

  <p>Star rating was only a title, and no one knew when it became popular. The Bear race had the Yellow Emperor Guards, and the Nine Li race had the Nine Li Guards. The number of stars was nothing more than a reflection of one's contribution to the race.</p>

  <p>However, a Nine Li Guard who could achieve five stars was undoubtedly powerful.</p>

  <p>"How many people are there?" Clement continued with his questions.</p>

  <p>"About a dozen people," Leyton responded with alacrity. "Word of mouth is, some of them belong to the Snake Goddess race."</p>

  <p>Clement nodded. It didn't matter which race they belonged to; he could kill all of them if he wanted to.</p>

  <p>Leyton was worried that Clement would refuse to help, so he said urgently,</p>

  <p>"Master Clement, those warriors at the Other Shore Realm are no match for you. If you go there, you can easily kill them."</p>

  <p>"I see. I will track your positions," Clement said. The light on his Yellow Emperor Magatama disappeared.</p>

  <p>Godfrey asked, "Are we going to the divine land?"</p>

  <p>With hands clasped behind his back, Clement narrowed his eyes and said,</p>

  <p>"It may be difficult for me to deal with those extremely powerful five-star Nine Li Guards. However, the elite troops of the Nine Li race had been killed in Gilt Town, so those wandering outside the Source World are most likely not the core figures. Let's go!"</p>

  <p>As he spoke, the Chaos Winged Beast in front of the flying ship suddenly erupted with a terrifying aura before it died.</p>

  <p>The group of Yellow Emperor Guards tasked to kill the dying Chaos Winged Beast did succeed, but they didn't expect that its ultimate counterattack before death would be so brutal.</p>

  <p>The originally shriveled, flat pairs of wings suddenly swelled. The Chaos Winged Beast was intelligent: it knew that it wouldn't survive, so it chose to take the Yellow Emperor Guards with it to their death.</p>

  <p>The Yellow Emperor Guards revealed a trace of panic on their faces, and each one of them wanted to retreat.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing this scene, Clement jumped up with a calm face, a golden light nestling in his hand.</p>

  <p>"I have chased you for so long. Now I can end your life with my own hands."</p>

  <p>The golden light transformed into a sharp, golden sword, which Clement used to sever the head of the Chaos Winged Beast. The latter was already gasping for its final breath; how could it possibly resist Clement's attack?</p>

  <p>The sword readily pierced through the creature's swollen body, and a huge wound spread from its back to its head. Finally, it was dead.</p>

  <p>In the divine land, Leyton's face registered a tinge of unabashed joy.</p>

  <p>"Leyton, is Master Clement very strong? Is he a five-star Yellow Emperor Guard?" Awash with curiosity, Hamish started quizzing Leyton.</p>

  <p>Leyton slightly smiled. "You know what? He was already a five-star Yellow Emperor Guard when we left. Not only that, he's a member of the Sky Guard Pavilion. Thankfully, I can rely on such a personality to help me out in times of crisis!"</p>

  <p>Upon hearing the name of the Sky Guard Pavilion, Hamish was slightly shocked. With the large population of the Bear race, its members could not easily join the Yellow Emperor Guards, let alone the Sky Guard Pavilion.</p>

  <p>Thus, Hamish admired every member of the Sky Guard Pavilion. No wonder Leyton respected Clement so much.</p>

  <p>"Your mission has been completed. Now, you can join Samuel and drive out the mice from the forbidden land with Salim and Lorcan," Leyton said with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>Everything had been settled, so Leyton had nothing to worry about. The only thing that required constant vigilance on his part was the original will of the divine land.</p>
