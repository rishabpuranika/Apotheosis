  <p>
</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng spoke his last word, the ancestry-level bloodline began boiling within him.</p>

  <p>He sensed that it had used six abilities of the life quadrant, as well as the ability of the space-time quadrant, which ranked a bit lower than eightieth in this quadrant. This was very rare.</p>

  <p>These seven abilities mixed together to form the bloodline.</p>

  <p>"Is this an origin-level bloodline?" Luo Zheng froze for a moment as he pondered.</p>

  <p>These three hundred and seventy-three abilities might have infinite combinations, but the origin-level bloodlines the Eternal Divine Courtyard had were those in the four spaces.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng made an attempt to activate the bloodline ability and almost immediately felt a burning sensation within, as his body began transforming dramatically.</p>

  <p>Thin muscles bulged out and quickly morphed into a layer of thick and solid armor which quickly sank and embedded itself on the surface of his skin, tightly enveloping his entire body.</p>

  <p>The sight of his own body left Luo Zheng in a dismal state. "You didn't provide me with an origin-level bloodline. You did this to prevent me from letting my blood out again!"</p>

  <p>The ancestry-level bloodline seemed unwilling to let Luo Zheng separate from it and now this disgusting armor had overtaken his body to prevent him from harming himself and allowing any of it to leave.</p>

  <p>"This is not enough to fight them.</p>

  <p>Aren't you afraid of being found out by them?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng added a few more threatening remarks, but the ancestry-level bloodline just ignored him and didn't move.</p>

  <p>Rumble...</p>

  <p>The Li Shan mountain still shook slightly.</p>

  <p>Yan's proficiency in attacking with the Energy Shaft was improving greatly and the golden light blades were being released faster and faster. They had now almost dug up an entire moat around the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>Herbert continued driving the growth of the blue pillars. However, as Yan sped up her actions, the blue pillars that surrounded the Li Shan mountain began weakening and a huge gap appeared among them.</p>

  <p>If it went on like this, Yan could possibly completely suppress Herbert.</p>

  <p>As for the balls Othniel had thrown in, Judson had grabbed them all one by one.</p>

  <p>The Li Shan mountain was humongous, but destroying a province was still an easy task for the Chaos Ancient Gods. The energy Othniel and Herbert had released was already enough to destroy the Li Shan mountain several times.</p>

  <p>But under the protection of Yan and the others, the Li Shan mountain remained unmoved.</p>

  <p>On a black ship, the Grandmaster of Heaven finally could take no more and grew irritable.</p>

  <p>After all, Othniel and Herbert were just as much his enemies. The only reason they worked together now was because they shared a common goal.</p>

  <p>These two Chaos Ancient Gods led an attack on the Li Shan mountain and were failing; they were obviously wasting time!</p>

  <p>"Do they intend to keep stalling for time with this pitiful assault?" the Grandmaster of Heaven asked, frowning with annoyance.</p>

  <p>Taking note of his anger, the captain of the Black ship responded, "Perhaps they need someone to finally break through and turn the tables."</p>

  <p>"You mean they're waiting for me to take action?" queried the Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>"I think so," the captain said and nodded.</p>

  <p>"In that case, let me shatter this stalemate..."</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven waved his hand, and the Six Soul Flags floated up into the air.</p>

  <p>As he swayed gently, the black flames on the Six Soul Flags flowed out like endless black snakes entangling with his Cyan Misty Sword.</p>

  <p>He stretched a finger out to point at the Cyan Misty Sword and the aura of the life truth spread out.</p>

  <p>This got the attention of the captain, the members of the Black Ship and even the Evil God as they sensed the aura.</p>

  <p>The members of the Black Ship were bewildered at how the Grandmaster of Heaven was able to use the life truth, but they then remembered he had used the space truth before and so thought nothing more of it.</p>

  <p>None had any idea how the Grandmaster of Heaven had obtained such an ability.</p>

  <p>The Evil God, however, had felt the energy of the Truth Crystal from Luo Zheng, and its aura was exactly the same as that of the Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>Once the black snakes in the Cyan Misty Sword were infused with the energy of the life truth, they began circling the Grandmaster of Heaven as if they had come to life.</p>

  <p>Ten snakes, twenty, thirty, forty...</p>

  <p>In a little more than a moment, he had created more than three hundred black snakes.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>He shook the Cyan Misty Sword gently and flicked his right hand, and many blue space frames appeared on the black snakes' bodies. The Grandmaster of Heaven then sent them into the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>"The Black Ship is taking action as well!" the Snake Goddess announced gravely.</p>

  <p>They had been paying close attention to the Grandmaster of Heaven as they battled the two Chaos Ancient Gods. After all, he was certainly more difficult to handle than these two.</p>

  <p>"I'll deal with the black flames!"</p>

  <p>Gerald had been entangled by the black flames before, and by means of the life truth, a unique formula had been created that extinguished the black flames.</p>

  <p>He had experience with these black flames and so felt confident facing them again.</p>

  <p>But when he let out his spiritual sense and was about to pull the black snakes out, he found himself perplexed. He was unable to detect any traces of the black fire snakes within the range of his spiritual sense!</p>

  <p>Fuxi and the Snake Goddess were having the same trouble.</p>

  <p>The intense energy was usually hard to miss with one's spiritual sense. It now being undetectable was truly strange.</p>

  <p>At that moment, inside the Heavenly Shuttle Sect in the middle of the Li Shan mountain, many members of the Snake Goddess race continued offering the energy they had.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>A black snake appeared seemingly out of nowhere and headed straight for the sect leader.</p>

  <p>The leader of the Heavenly Shuttle Sect was a powerful Chaotic Source Realm warrior. She was still going through the test of the Soul City, and was only one step away from the Holy Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>She knew this snake coming at her was powerful and immediately employed her Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>But the black snake's speed was beyond what she had expected.</p>

  <p>It was too late, because when her Other Shore Token was activated, the black snake had already bitten her on the neck and her body fell lifeless...</p>

  <p>"Master!"</p>

  <p>"Master..."</p>

  <p>The disciples of the Heavenly Shuttle Sect fell into a panic. Some stepped back, some tried to protect the sect leader and some attacked the black snake in vengeance.</p>

  <p>However, the black snake was incredibly quick and they could not track it with the spiritual sense.</p>

  <p>They stood no chance against it; almost all the Heavenly Shuttle Sect's disciples were killed within 30 seconds. Only a few smart and shrewd disciples managed to escape using the Grand Teleportation technique.</p>

  <p>Such massacres were taking place all across the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess, Fuxi and the others couldn't locate the black snakes, but they sensed the hysteria, horror and fear among the commotion.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess and Fuxi were getting agitated as their numbers started dwindling.</p>

  <p>"All sect leaders and mountain leaders, please do whatever you can to kill those black snakes!"</p>

  <p>She issued the order and flashed to the Heavenly Shuttle Sect. Her heart sank and broke when she saw their members fall to the ground, one after the other.</p>

  <p>The black snake hunted for a while and now wished to hide in the mountain. But before it could drill into the ground, the Snake Goddess got hold of it!</p>

  <p>It struggled in her grip and black flames burst out from it, burning the Snake Goddess' white fingers, contorting and charring them. But she seemed to feel no pain. She used the energy of the shadow of Snake Goddess to suppress the snake and smash it to pieces!</p>
