<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3391 Dangerous Situation </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Hutton and Feng Ge's current state was far worse than what Zheng and Sally had first imagined.</p>

  <p>Things were initially going great for Feng Ge after entering the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>The hurricane changed things though. She had tried to resist getting swept up in order to go to Zheng but it proved futile. In the end, the hurricane carried her farther and farther away from him.</p>

  <p>She travelled for over a million miles, almost reaching the other end of the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>Left with no other choice, Feng Ge was forced to explore the world alone.</p>

  <p>The prospect didn't worry her that much though. As the Phoenix Palace's number one disciple, Feng Ge was by no means weak.</p>

  <p>Halfway through her journey, she had already encountered several dangerous situations along with a fight with a demon woman from the Sun Crow race.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge was one out of the two people that remained on top of the Bearing race's hit list so that fight with the demon woman wasn't so strange.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, with her current strength, Feng Ge managed to kill her pursuer with the tiniest bit of effort.</p>

  <p>With that taken care of, she went on to explore the Chaotic Source World for several hours and even obtained three Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>She would've normally advanced towards the core area at that point.</p>

  <p>The core area was smaller than the periphery and all members of the large races would gather there eventually, so Zheng was no exception.</p>

  <p>However, since she was so desperate to find him, she made a bold choice and went along with the hurricane.</p>

  <p>Each time it appeared, it would carry her at least sixty to seventy thousand miles. Feng Ge would activate her bodily movement skill during this time to speed up further.</p>

  <p id="top_3">It was by doing this that Feng Ge managed to go around the entire Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>Hutton went for a much more normal course of action. When the hurricane came, he dug a hole in the ground and hid.</p>

  <p>He was worried about Sally and wanted to join her as soon as possible but, after knowing the fact that she was with Zheng through her soul mark, he quickly relaxed. He knew she would be safe and sound under his protection.</p>

  <p>Not long after that, Hutton bumped into Efrain and other disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>Efrain didn't really know where Hutton was from but considered him as a disciple of the Oneness Mountain since he had come with Zheng.</p>

  <p>This group of Oneness Sky Palace disciples Efrain led moved as a unit that gradually grew in number as more and more people joined them.</p>

  <p>Most warriors preferred to travel alone so their group really stood out, in a good way though. Since they were such a large group, no one dared provoke them.</p>

  <p>Even those from powerful races preferred to avoid any conflict with them.</p>

  <p>Efrain's goal was clear: to head for the core area of the Chaotic Source World as fast as possible.</p>

  <p>His influence in the Oneness Sky Palace wasn't on the same level as Chaim's but the other disciples followed his orders just the same. After all, Efrain was strong and powerful.</p>

  <p>However, just fifty thousand miles away from their destination, their group encountered some trouble.</p>

  <p>That said 'trouble' came in the form of enemy warriors coming from the Divine Farmer race, the Bearing race, and the New Moon race.</p>

  <p>Efrain was ranked third in the second row of these races' hit list.</p>

  <p>A big fight inevitably erupted between the two forces.</p>

  <p>Now, Efrain was strong but he was far outnumbered by the elites that had banded together to defeat him. He got seriously injured after getting hit by their joint attack and thought he was going to die when the hurricane suddenly appeared and carried him to safety. The other disciples following him took advantage of this and also escaped.</p>

  <p>Those from the Divine Farmer race, the Bearing race, and the New Moon race went underground and waited for the hurricane to subside. Only four of their elites chose to ride the hurricane and chase after Efrain.</p>

  <p>When the hurricane stopped, these four elites immediately caught up with several unlucky disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>Hutton was one of those unlucky disciples.</p>

  <p>They wanted to kill him because he was regarded as a disciple of the Oneness Sky Palace by the four elites. However, there was no way he would tell them that he was actually from the Nine Li race. Either way, they'd kill him on the spot!</p>

  <p>As he ran for his life, fate came into play and had him bump into Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>Noticing the four elites hot on his tail, Feng Ge came forward to block them for him.</p>

  <p>Thus, the two of them banded together to fight off these four pursuers.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge was valiant and even managed to gain the upper hand at some point.</p>

  <p>However, just as their four opponents were about to tap out, another warrior of the Bearing race suddenly arrived. He was strong, far surpassing the elites in terms of power, and wielded two powerful sabers as weapons.</p>

  <p>The appearance of this unexpected enemy drove Feng Ge and Hutton in grave danger and they were forced to retreat. Instead of just running aimlessly, they chose the path that could most likely help them escape.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge had run in a circle around the world to approach Zheng. The two of them moved towards each other and the distance between them was beginning to close.</p>

  <p>The young man in a white robe chased after Feng Ge. "I've heard about you in the Bearing race! Your strength is worth your reputation so why do you refuse to fight with me?"</p>

  <p>This man was Adonis Yu, a collateral descendant of the Bearing race.</p>

  <p>He was not a direct descendant but he was extremely valuable to his race owing to his extraordinary talent. In fact, he was ranked in the top three among all young members of the Bearing race and many expected great things from him.</p>

  <p>As a collateral descendant, Adonis Yu put in twice the effort in order to get where he was now. He had to fight twice as hard in order to gain the same level of respect as those with higher status.</p>

  <p>Killing Feng Ge would no doubt raise his prestige even more!</p>

  <p>This was a golden opportunity for him and he was seizing it.</p>

  <p>Adonis knew he had to work fast. The hurricane was bound to come by any time soon and if that happened, he'd have a harder time catching up with Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>Taking the time constraint into account, he tapped his head.</p>

  <p>A small paper boat appeared above him, quickly growing in size and carrying him forward at a faster speed. He left his four companions in the dust and gradually bridged the gap between him and his two targets.</p>

  <p>"I'll catch you no matter how hard you try to escape! Just give up and fight me!" he shouted after them.</p>

  <p>As he got near enough, he leaped from the paper boat and raised his two sabers in front of him. Feng Ge was the closest and he swung a powerful crisscross slash to her back.</p>

  <p>Feeling his intent behind her, Feng Ge controlled the Warrior of the Stone Hill that floated above her head and slapped down!</p>

  <p>As an Other Shore Token of the descending type, the power of the Warrior of the Stone Hill wasn't something that should be underestimated and Adonis knew this.</p>

  <p>He knew that he wouldn't be able to take the blow head-on.</p>

  <p>He quickly jumped back onto the paper boat and avoided Feng Ge's attack.</p>

  <p>He was like lightning, evading the slap and aiming another attack towards Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Feng Ge was alerted by his movements and backed off abruptly, barely dodging the slash that he had intended for her neck. She kept her head but ended up losing her balance.</p>

  <p>There was no way Adonis was going to let this opportunity go!</p>

  <p>Hutton saw Feng Ge in a sticky situation and tried to help her, however, the four elite members after them had already caught up and surrounded him.</p>

  <p>There was no way he could lend a helping hand when he was too busy trying to defend himself.</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish! Swish!</p>

  <p>It was like a dance against death's sharp claws as Feng Ge dodged Adonis's sabers, contorting into awkward stances due to her precarious position.</p>

  <p>Her breath hitched each time the sabers were too close to her.</p>

  <p>It was a game of defense and offense. Feng Ge kept her guard up for a while but eventually, she showed an opening. Adonis seized this chance and hacked down.</p>

  <p>If he landed this strike then he would be able to cut her in half and end this fight.</p>

  <p>At such a critical moment, a beam of colorful light suddenly shot towards him and hit his blade.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>There was a deafening crashing sound as the light hit his saber, knocking it away. That powerful force had come from the Iridescent Stone.</p>
