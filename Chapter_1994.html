<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>If one wanted their voice heard by the entire Demon Night race, a Roaring Token might be used. This was especially useful for announcements like the queen's decree.</p>

  <p>However, the queen's decree was usually issued during a special ceremony. The Demon Night had to do that via the queen's statue as a sign of respect for the queen.</p>

  <p>At that moment, all the members of the Demon Night in the Upper World, the Lower World, and sacred places were all taken by surprise.</p>

  <p>They did not expect what they heard next...</p>

  <p>"It's Leroy! Has Leroy really returned?"</p>

  <p>"Why is he the one issuing the queen's decree on behalf of the Queen of Killings?"</p>

  <p>"What is he trying to do?"</p>

  <p>Everyone couldn't help but discuss this development among themselves...</p>

  <p>The Board of Elders paid especially close attention to this matter. They had to know the current situation, so they could avert any crisis if needed. When they heard the words "queen's order", they quickly realized that another big change was about to happen among the Demon Night!</p>

  <p>"On behalf of the Queen of Killings, I declare that the Queen of Life, Ying, and the Queen of Punishment, Yao, are traitors! They have been brainwashed by the alien race to betray the entire Evolutionary Universe and lead the Demon Night towards annihilation!"</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Leroy's voice reverberated throughout all the sacred places of the Demon Night. There was no one that could not have heard his pronouncement.</p>

  <p>Understandably, all the Demon Night members were shocked. This had never happened before.</p>

  <p>As they heard Supreme Lord Leroy's declaration, they couldn't believe their ears. They never thought that the queen's decree would be so harsh.</p>

  <p>"The Demon Night should know where we stand in the current situation of the universe. The best thing we could do now is to follow the Queen of Killings and retreat from the war. We need to regroup our forces, regain our strength, and try our best to make our race stronger..."</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Leroy delivered the message to the multitudes of Demon Night race that were listening.</p>

  <p>The three queens were equals in the hierarchy of power, so the Queen of Killings was not qualified to pronounce the crimes of the other two queens. This kind of queen's decree was null and void.</p>

  <p>However, Supreme Lord Leroy was sure that the Demon Night members had reached the limit of their patience for Ying's and Yao's impulsive antics.</p>

  <p>The members of the Demon Night were very loyal and faithful to the queens, but even their loyalty and tolerance were not limitless.</p>

  <p>Before this, Xun had never taken any action against the other two even though she disapproved of their actions. By forcefully starting a war, Ying and Yao had already betrayed the trust of the members of their race... The Demon Night members naturally supported and followed their queens unquestioningly. They had no other choice but to obey their queens when Yao and Ying took action together.</p>

  <p>Now that the Queen of Killings had stood up against the other two, it gave them another cause to support. They no longer had to force themselves to go along with the decisions of Ying and Yao.</p>

  <p>If they didn't want to betray their race, the members of the Demon Night race had an easy choice: all they had to do was to follow the Queen of Killings...</p>

  <p>Loraine, the Saint Lord of the Purple Cloud Sacred Place, was also stunned when she heard Supreme Lord Leroy's announcement. She never thought that things would escalate to this level among the queens.</p>

  <p>Loraine knew that since Supreme Lord Leroy led the group here, it would definitely cause a huge commotion and he might meddle in the dispute among the queens. However, she never expected that it was Supreme Lord Leroy who would directly declare the other two queens to be traitors!</p>

  <p>The severity of the situation had far exceeded Loraine's imagination!</p>

  <p>After Supreme Lord Leroy finished his words, Luo Luo Zheng smiled. "I believe that that woman will make her move soon. She has never been able to control her emotions and reactions."</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Leroy looked calm. "I'm just afraid that she won't retaliate. Our race members are very smart, and are the most loyal warriors. They are not idiots; they understand what choice they should make."</p>

  <p>What Supreme Lord Leroy was currently trying to do was to alienate Ying and Yao from the Demon Night race and then think of a way to kill them.</p>

  <p>He had just taken the initial step...</p>

  <p>"Clang!"</p>

  <p>Xun's statue was shattered into pieces. The severed head of the statue rolled in front of Yao, and with a single step, Yao smashed it!</p>

  <p>She was so angry that she wasn't able to control the rage in her heart.</p>

  <p>She grimaced angrily. Her beautiful face was completely distorted!</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Luo Zheng had expected, Yao immediately launched a counterattack...</p>

  <p>All statues of the Queen of Punishment in the Demon Night race's sacred places emitted rays of blue light; lightning also continued to flash across the sky simultaneously. Yao uttered, "Humph, Leroy. You are just a little mouse hiding in your lair. Now you finally dare to come out from your dark corner. What right do you have to represent Xun and issue the queen's order? Even Xun doesn't have the qualifications to declare me to be a traitor!"</p>

  <p>Hearing Yao rant against Leroy angrily, all the members of the Demon Night in the sacred places turned silent... Somehow, they knew that Yao had a valid point.</p>

  <p>Yao gathered all the elites and geniuses from every supreme world. In this senseless war, there was bad news every day especially for the ordinary citizens. The victims who died in the war were the Demon Night members' sisters, brothers, and children...</p>

  <p>This despair spread and accumulated over time. They couldn't do anything about it.</p>

  <p>When Murphy had created the Demon Night race, he had made careful consideration and had given unwavering faith to this race! At the right time, after the Soul-sealing Needles were activated and if the three queens were unified in one goal, the members of the Demon Night race would have no room for doubt. They would have no choice but to put their faith on their queens.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Murphy hadn't counted on this happening: one of the queens had forcefully erased the Soul-sealing Needle and caused a fatal error.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Leroy's voice once again rang through all of the sacred places of the Demon Night race via the queen's statue. He had completely predicted that Yao would strike back. It could even be said that Yao's words were what he was waiting for.</p>

  <p>"You are correct. I am indeed unqualified, and not even Xun can pronounce you as traitors. But the ones who have the power to decide are tens of thousands of members of the Demon Night race! I believe that all of you will make the right choice!"</p>

  <p>When Supreme Lord Leroy finished speaking, Yao looked even more furious. Shania, who led a group of warriors towards Bloody Evil World, also pulled a long face.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Leroy's remarks were so trenchant and caused them undue distress. How dare this Supreme Lord accuse two queens of being traitors to their race?</p>

  <p>Due to their frustration, they weren't even able to refute him!</p>

  <p>At that moment, all members of the Demon Night race realized that they had been given a new way out. Supreme Lord Leroy's words meant that the freedom to make their own choice had been returned to each and every one of them.</p>

  <p>The ordinary Demon Night warriors and even the loyal followers of Yao and Ying began to hesitate. They realized all the things that Yao and Ying did brought their race to ruin.</p>

  <p>"We are willing to follow the Queen of Killings..."</p>

  <p>"Those two despicable queens are bringing us to a dead end!"</p>

  <p>"They have never really cared about us!"</p>

  <p>Yao's body stiffened where she stood. The lightning in her eyes danced unceasingly, and a murderous intent could be seen in them. She wasn't even able to refute Supreme Lord Leroy's words...</p>

  <p>The grand world lord still knelt on the tree trunk. After she heard what Supreme Lord Leroy said, a smile appeared on her face. She saw Yao's stiff back, but the grand world lord felt extremely gratified. In her eyes, Supreme Lord Leroy and Xun had become the saviors of the Demon Night!</p>

  <p>"Buzz, buzz, buzz..."</p>

  <p>A purple ray of light appeared behind Yao. As it flickered, it condensed into the shape of a human. This person was Supreme Lord Leia of the Demon Night race.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords of the Demon Night had a relatively special status.</p>

  <p>Although they were appointed by the queens, they were not absolutely loyal to them.</p>

  <p>Thus, the queens of the Demon Night cultivated those who were loyal to them and let them carry the Heavenly Destiny. For example, Supreme Lord Leroy became a Supreme Lord because of Xun's support, and Supreme Lord Gunter was trained by Yao. However, Supreme Lord Gunter had been trapped in Luo Zheng's Desperate Melee and had eventually perished.</p>

  <p>"Yao, just give up," Supreme Lord Leia said flatly.</p>

  <p>Yao suddenly turned around and stared at Supreme Lord Leia. Her heart was filled with rage. "You also want to betray the Demon Night race?"</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Leia gazed at her and replied, "I will not betray the Demon Night race."</p>

  <p>"Then why do you advise me to give up?" Yao asked angrily.</p>

  <p>"Because I won't be supporting you anymore," Supreme Lord Leia replied.</p>

  <p>In fact, when the Demon Night attacked the ogres, the Supreme Lords of the Demon Night had also strongly opposed. Unfortunately, the two queens had already made up their minds. Even the Supreme Lords had no choice, but this didn't mean that they agreed to it.</p>

  <p>"You want to help that bitch?" Yao asked again.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Leia answered, "Just as Leroy has said, I have the right to decide for myself."</p>

  <p>She did not betray the Demon Night; she just chose to support the other queen...</p>

  <p>Yao glared at Supreme Lord Leia, the thunderbolts in her eyes crazily sparking. The Saint Thunder Meteor Hammer in her hand suddenly shook, and a thick bolt of lightning shot towards Supreme Lord Leia like a giant python!</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Leia nodded slightly and a silver mirror appeared in front of her.</p>

  <p>When the thick bolt of lightning struck the mirror, it rebounded to the sky and disappeared without a trace...</p>

  <p>This mirror was the Heavenly Destiny that Supreme Lord Leia carried, known as "Absolute Reflection". Under the protection of the Law of Causality, Supreme Lord Leia could let almost anything be reflected back!</p>

  <p>"I won't attack you for now." Supreme Lord Leia looked at Yao, her calm eyes already faintly emitting an intent to kill. "However, I will destroy you next time we face each other."</p>

  <p>After Supreme Lord Leia finished speaking, her figure slowly disappeared from where she stood, leaving behind a stunned Yao.</p>

  <p>On the Bloody Plain, the soldiers of the Demon Night started to lose focus. They all poured out of the Purple Feather Trees, and the army that was never afraid of death began to disintegrate.</p>

  <p>They weren't running for their lives; they had just chosen their new leader.</p>
