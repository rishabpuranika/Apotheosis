<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Also, during the recent many years, they were the only two people who had figured out the sword intent of the consummate grade in Cloud Sect, and thus, nobody at Cloud Sect could offer them any useful suggestions.</p>

  <p>Frank's situation was, however, different from theirs. As a disciple of the Cloud Hall in the Central Region, he would have many opportunities to meet well-known masters. Any of them could offer him useful suggestions. Together, with his diligent practice, once he had figured out spear intent of the consummate grade, he would learn how to condense the spear intent easily.</p>

  <p>Therefore, disciples of Cloud Hall were at an advantage in this respect.</p>

  <p>"Super Spinning Spear!" Frank bellowed as he summoned one of his powerful skills.</p>

  <p>As he spun at an extreme speed toward the Flying Yaksha, Frank was integrated with his long white spear. It looked like he had become a part of it.</p>

  <p>The Flying Yaksha also felt the power of Frank's attack. But, as the attack had been launched so suddenly, it didn't have any time to respond.</p>

  <p>It could only cross its arms in front of its chest to resist the attack with the hopes of withstanding the attack with the strength of its corporeal body.</p>

  <p>"Snap, snap, snap…" The sound of something breaking filled the silence.</p>

  <p>The hard gold scales around the arms of the Flying Yaksha shattered.</p>

  <p>Frank's spear, infused with his spear intent of the consummate grade, finally managed to pierce through the Flying Yaksha. Taking advantage, Frank pushed the spear deep inside it.</p>

  <p>After the white spear penetrated the Flying Yaksha's arms, its momentum remained unabated. It then pierced through the Flying Yaksha's chest.</p>

  <p>It was indeed, surprising to see the Flying Yaksha be defeated in such a manner. It looked as though the Flying Yaksha were a skewered shrimp waiting to be grilled!</p>

  <p>"Aaugh, aaugh, aaugh..." the Flying Yaksha roared as pain coursed through its corporeal body.</p>

  <p>It had extremely strong vitality. Even though the spear had penetrated its viscera, it was still alive. Yet, since the spear had impaled its arms, it could not launch an attack. Just as it tried to pull its body out of the white spear with its feet, Frank raised the spear high in the air.</p>

  <p>Then he thrust the white spear rod into the ground. The Flying Yaksha that was still attached to the spear's tip now looked like a flag. It struggled constantly, and its wings fluttered as it attempted to free itself.</p>

  <p>However, its efforts were futile. Over the next few minutes, the Flying Yaksha struggled less and less as it gradually lost its strength. As the Flying Yaksha released its last breath, its head dropped.</p>

  <p>"Frank! You did it!" Lois said with excitement. She rushed toward Frank.</p>

  <p>Such was the confidence she had in Frank that she took it for granted that he would kill the Flying Yaksha.</p>

  <p>Zade Zhou, a disciple of the Brumous Sect, also followed Lois and congratulated Frank on his success with cupped fists, "Frank, you are so amazing! You killed such a fierce beast with your spear! Your highly-skilled martial arts are worthy of admiration. That's right! I admire it so much!"</p>

  <p>Yet, the Cloud Hall's disciple, who had just reminded Frank, still frowned as he said coldly, "The Flying Yaksha is not a particularly powerful fierce beast on the Death Road. Killing it is not a big deal. The real challenges still await us!"</p>

  <p>Hearing his cold words, Lois was unhappy, and she retorted sharply in a cold tone, "Frank tried his best to kill the Flying Yaksha, which means that he saved your life. Now, if you are not grateful to him, we'll not take it personally. What did you mean by what you just said?"</p>

  <p>Then the Cloud Hall's disciple fell silent for a while before he said, "I'm just telling the truth."</p>

  <p>At that moment, Zheng and his companions also walked toward Frank.</p>

  <p>Patrick introduced Zheng and Tianming to Frank in high spirits, "Frank, they are disciples of my sect. On the Death Road, with their help…"</p>

  <p>Without waiting for Patrick to finish, Frank nodded and broke in, "I understand. Now, follow me. And I will protect you all. But remember, don't move out of my protection area!"</p>

  <p>Hearing that, Patrick slightly frowned, while Tianming and Zheng also wore a heavy face. 'Although this guy is not a bad person and his strength is also strong, he is just too cocky, which makes me deeply annoyed.' They all held such thought at that moment.</p>

  <p>Just as Tianming was about to say something, Zheng smiled and once again stopped him. 'The Death Road is full of threats. I'd like to see how far Frank can go. We will always find opportunities to prove our strength.</p>

  <p>Not to rush, ' Zheng's mind was racing fast.</p>

  <p>Frank did not pay attention to the expressions of Tianming and his companions. He shook his long spear, threw the Flying Yaksha's body on the ground, and launched a spear attack toward the Flying Yaksha's chest. After the spear cut through, a demon core fell out of its chest.</p>

  <p>The demon core of a fierce beast was precious. Frank would never miss the opportunity to collect one. After disposing of the Flying Yaksha's body, Frank continued his journey on the Death Road, followed by Lois and Zade.</p>

  <p>Tianming's pride led him to believe that they would have managed fine on the Death Road without Frank. He was convinced that Frank was not the only one who could pass the tests on the Death Road. However, since Zheng insisted that they put up with Frank's attitude and follow him, Tianming had no choice but to go along.</p>

  <p>As for Lewis, his original purpose was not very clear. Thus, he didn't overthink Frank's attitude and followed him like the other people.</p>

  <p>After everyone set out, the Cloud Hall's disciple standing in situ suddenly raised his head, smiled strangely in a certain direction, and then stretched his hand to squeeze something hard between his fingers in the air, as if he were crumbling something into pieces. Then he clapped his hands gently and followed the others.</p>

  <p>The action resulted in the disappearance of the picture being broadcasted on the Picture Slab, which was placed at the entrance of the Cloud Road!</p>
