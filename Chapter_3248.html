<br/><br/>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng's statements had left everyone speechless.</p>

  <p>Most nonhuman creatures had pinned him to be crazy. They thought he had lost his mind.</p>

  <p>It was already a ridiculous thing for Zheng to come over and blatantly demand a hundred million soul pills from the Separate Abyss race. And now he continued to assert his dominance by stating he would raze the territory of the Separate Abyss race to the ground.</p>

  <p>Among the nonhuman creatures, there was a human. He originated from the Divine Farmer race.</p>

  <p>This man had gone all the way from Stage Four to Stage Thirteen.</p>

  <p>However, he had only been on the Other Shore for a short while. Therefore, he hadn't witnessed the scene of Zheng destroying the temple of the Bearing race before he came here.</p>

  <p>But he did hear from his clansmen about everything that had happened in Stage Four, including the fact that Zheng could enter the Other Shore with his physical body.</p>

  <p>"I didn't expect this brat to suddenly come to Stage Eleven. From the looks of it, the Separate Abyss race has offended him as well. Does he really plan to cause a scene in the Separate Abyss race?"</p>

  <p>The Separate Abyss race was formidable. Their strength was not something to be underestimated. Even the Bearing race hesitated to provoke them.</p>

  <p>Anyone who stood and watched began to anticipate the likelihood of something interesting to happen.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing Zheng's arrogant words, the leader of the guards laughed mockingly. "What did you say? You want to destroy our territory? Hahaha!</p>

  <p>What a joke!"</p>

  <p>Initially, the Separate Abyss race wanted to come to a compromise with Zheng on the issue at hand. After all, Zheng was the only one who had arrived at the Other Shore with his physical body. They didn't want to offend him and cause too much trouble for either of them.</p>

  <p>If this matter escalated without coming to a conclusion, a rumor would spread that the Separate Abyss race had demanded an exorbitant price. This would result in a severe blow to their reputation.</p>

  <p>Now that the situation was getting out of hand, they realized the problem couldn't be solved peacefully. Therefore, they changed their attitudes.</p>

  <p>"It's true that it's a remarkable thing to have a physical body on the Other Shore. Other races might be intimidated by you, but, we're not afraid of you!"</p>

  <p>"I'd suggest that you move to Stage Twelve if you know what's good for you!"</p>

  <p>"We share the same origin with the Abyss Spirit race of the Ancestral Glory Stage. Your physical body is no threat to us!"</p>

  <p>There were many creatures of different kinds living on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>The strength and durability of beings increased with a higher stage.</p>

  <p>Naturally, the ones that lived on Stage One to Stage Four were not much strong in comparison.</p>

  <p>Some creatures would even occupy restricted areas where no one else but themselves were allowed on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>There was not much known about these races because they maintained a low profile. They would seldom communicate or interact with the Souls of Light. Similarly, the Souls of Light that roamed the Other Shore would never dare to enter their territories and trespass on them.</p>

  <p>However, the Abyss Spirit race from Stage Eleven was an exception.</p>

  <p>The Separate Abyss race and the Abyss Spirit race enjoyed a healthy relationship. It was said that in the middle ages, the Separate Abyss race was not as powerful as they stood today. When the leader of the Separate Abyss race had entered Stage Eleven, he had come across the Abyss Spirit race by chance. After a few interactions, they became exceedingly acquainted with one another.</p>

  <p>Since the Abyss Spirit race regarded the Separate Abyss race as their allies, they supported them in all aspects of their growth in Stage Eleven. Due to their relentless assistance, the latter soon took control of Stage Eleven on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>It could be said that the Abyss Spirit race had made a significant contribution to their development.</p>

  <p>"Oh, really? Is that so?"</p>

  <p>With swift movements, Zheng grabbed the arm of the man in front of him.</p>

  <p>The immense Soul of Light was weightless in Zheng's grip, and he threw him straight onto the wide square area.</p>

  <p>Watching Zheng launch a direct attack made some of the impulsive members of the Separate Abyss race charge forward to avenge their clansman.</p>

  <p>Chaos ensued when the other races in the line saw this. They began to flee frantically in all directions like a flock of disturbed birds.</p>

  <p>Some people took it as a source of their entertainment, while others were worried since they got involved in the matter for no reason. However, neither of them could get out of this. There was no way to retreat from the Other Shore in this damned place.</p>

  <p>The members of the Separate Abyss race were massive in terms of size, and each of them was innate mighty warriors. Moreover, they cultivated under the watchful eyes of the Abyss Spirit race, who taught them to develop a unique soul method. It was a technique that allowed them to enhance their Souls of Light to an extended degree within a short amount of time.</p>

  <p>At the same time, several members of the Separate Abyss race dashed towards Zheng to strike. Meanwhile, Zheng stood there as he had to bear terrible soul pressure from all of them.</p>

  <p>Each of those members was equipped with a soul spear that they thrust at Zheng mercilessly.</p>

  <p>However, they had underestimated the strength and resistance of Zheng's physical body.</p>

  <p>Although they had increased their soul power substantially, a soul was still inferior to a body. Moreover, Zheng's physical body was far more compelling than that of an average person.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>The soul spears that would usually cause immense damage were like wooden arrows in front of Zheng. The moment they came in contact with his body, they cracked into many minuscule pieces.</p>

  <p>After a full round of countless attacks towards Zheng, he remained tall on his feet completely unscathed.</p>

  <p>Realizing that their attacks had all gone to waste, the members of the Separate Abyss race opened their eyes wide in shock. Their leader felt an undeniable fear build up inside of him.</p>

  <p>"Alright then, it's my turn now," Zheng said as he cracked his knuckles to prepare himself to counterattack.</p>

  <p>He never was ruthless towards the people of his own race; he would show them mercy.</p>

  <p>When he destroyed the temple of the Bearing race, he had spared the lives of all humans.</p>

  <p>However, he didn't consider the members of the Separate Abyss race to be from his race. These intelligent beings were no different from beasts with violent tendencies.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>By stomping on the ground hard with his feet, Zheng boosted himself upwards as fast as an arrow released from its bow.</p>

  <p>When he passed through a tall and mighty warrior of the Separate Abyss race, he gently pressed on his head.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>The man's Soul of Light diminished in an instant!</p>

  <p>However, Zheng did not plan to stop there. He turned his head to find his next target and rushed towards a man close by. Within a split second, Zheng had attacked four people and destroyed their Souls of Light!</p>

  <p>"He's too strong for us!"</p>

  <p>"We can't fight against him!"</p>

  <p>"Hurry and inform the Abyss Spirit race!"</p>

  <p>The remaining members of the Separate Abyss race began to retreat and flee the field one after the other. But they had nowhere to go since the area was sealed shut.</p>

  <p>Zheng stood patiently and didn't bother to follow after them to kill them off.</p>

  <p>After observing the panicked looks on the faces of other races, he turned to them and said, "Find your own star rings and leave this place."</p>

  <p>Without the obstruction of the Separate Abyss race, they were able to leave Stage Eleven through the star rings. And they wouldn't have to pay the heavy fee of ten thousand soul pills.</p>

  <p>All the other races were grateful to Zheng. He had helped them save ten thousand soul pills. And more importantly, he had taught the arrogant members of the Separate Abyss race a good lesson.</p>

  <p>The Separate Abyss race had kept their dominance over small and powerless races in Stage Eleven and the Source World. It was about time someone showed up and put them in their place.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, sir. We are grateful to you for helping us. But you have to be careful with the Abyss Spirit race!"</p>

  <p>"Those living creatures on the Other Shore can also present themselves with their physical bodies."</p>

  <p>"They are very powerful."</p>

  <p>Some people who knew a little about Zheng's approaching enemy gave him all the information they had so he could prepare himself.</p>

  <p>Zheng carefully listened to them and nodded. Then he made his way forward and scanned his surroundings.</p>

  <p>The Separate Abyss race had built an entire city on the Other Shore, not just a temple. The city wall alone stood over a thousand feet high, and the buildings within were at an astounding height of ten thousand feet.</p>

  <p>With careful steps, he walked over to the wall and gently pressed his hands against it.</p>

  <p>As he exerted a little pressure, the wall which was one thousand feet high and one hundred feet wide collapsed with a loud sound that reverberated far and wide. A noticeable gap was formed.</p>

  <p>The members of the Separate Abyss race, who stood behind the wall, were oblivious to the scenario that took place on the other side. They eyed Zheng up in astonishment.</p>
