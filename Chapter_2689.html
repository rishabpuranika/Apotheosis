<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Some of the best resources in the divine land were present at the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>Through the forbidden areas' entrances on the Floating Islands, all sorts of resources were continuously sent to the divine land.</p>

  <p>Hence it was no surprise, that over the years, whenever it came to the talents of the divine land, everyone had their eyes fixed on the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>"So far Mike has been doing really good. I wonder if he has any more tricks up his sleeves," Jeremiah commented.</p>

  <p>"What is the use? He is already dead. No matter how powerful he is, it's useless to use any trump card now," Murphy said indifferently.</p>

  <p>While the Holy Beings were busy in heated discussions, Troy said,</p>

  <p>"There is something strange that needs to be reported!"</p>

  <p>"Go ahead," said Nicholas calmly, nodding in agreement.</p>

  <p>"Although Zheng's physical body was powerful, we still stood a chance to capture him. We could apply the Grand Teleportation technique, provided the space in the region was not blocked."</p>

  <p>Nicholas was confused with Troy's words. He merely smiled and said,</p>

  <p>"You are blaming me for sealing off the regions?"</p>

  <p>Earlier Nicholas had wasted the divine might coins, in order to write the rule on the Ruling Slate. This was done so that the target could not escape.</p>

  <p>However, the consummate True Gods were also restrained by this rule.</p>

  <p>This shocked everyone.</p>

  <p>"Of course not." Troy shook his head and added, "The space in the Snake Spirit Region wasn't blocked. My plan was to use the Topsoil Bell to lock Zheng, thereby allowing everyone to fight together. By then, everyone could freely employ the Grand Teleportation technique except Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, I was about to enter the Snake Spirit Region, when Zheng attacked me suddenly. After stepping into the Snake Spirit Region, he ran away!"</p>

  <p>"You mean to say that Zheng saw through your scheme?" asked Nicholas.</p>

  <p>Troy shook his head, "It's impossible that he identified my plan. He definitely was not aware that I had the possession of Topsoil Bell.</p>

  <p>Moreover, I informed others about my scheme through the life vitality, so there was no way he could hear anything."</p>

  <p>Nicholas's eyes narrowed as he said, "So you mean someone informed him of your plan and that's how he successfully escaped!"</p>

  <p>"Exactly! There is a spy among us!" Troy nodded and looked towards Tianming who was not far away.</p>

  <p>Everyone followed his gaze and stared at Tianming. It was very clear to everyone that Troy strongly suspected Tianming.</p>

  <p>However, Tianming seemed indifferent with the turn in situation. He responded calmly, "I've never met Zheng before. I didn't even know that such a person existed. Merely by your speculations, you consider me a spy! That is a hasty conclusion you have arrived at!"</p>

  <p>Nicholas also smiled slightly. "Troy, I am aware that you have your differences with Lowell. But that does not allow you to term Lowell a spy, after Zheng attacked you."</p>

  <p>Clark also laughed in agreement and said, "That's right. If there's a spy among the consummate True Gods, then everyone comes under the suspicion. Your conclusion is not reasonable!"</p>

  <p>Troy just continued to glare at Tianming.</p>

  <p>It was true that he did not have definite proof to suspect Tianming.</p>

  <p>But going by his intuition, Troy still suspected Tianming strongly.</p>

  <p>At the same, he could not prolong the accusation. Everyone was aware about the ongoing indifference between Tianming and him. So if he insisted, it would definitely go against him and not be the other way round. Besides, it might even leave an image that he took the available opportunity to eradicate his opponent.</p>

  <p>Hence, he did not want to continue the discussion.</p>

  <p>"Forget it. I never thought that the person that returned from outside of the divine land would actually be Zheng. All of you may leave now,"</p>

  <p>Nicholas said to the consummate True Gods, waving his hand.</p>

  <p>The consummate True Gods felt relieved to be out of a sticky situation and quickly left the Goldenrain Hall.</p>

  <p>After the consummate True Gods left, Nicholas said, "Zheng's return is a very small matter to be concerned about. The people outside are the most troublesome!"</p>

  <p>Hearing this, the Holy Beings gathered around and looked tense.</p>

  <p>"The only ones who are able to roam freely in the chaos are the Holy Beings and Other Shore Realm warriors," Jeremiah concluded.</p>

  <p>"Also don't forget the fact that Zheng is with them," added Clark.</p>

  <p>"Aargh! Don't mention that fellow!" Murphy looked disgusted just by hearing Zheng's name.</p>

  <p>Once he had come close in killing Zheng. He had slashed the Evolutionary Universe with his sword, but he hardly could touch Zheng.</p>

  <p>At the gate of the Time Sea Forbidden Land, Nicholas too tried his attempt in killing Zheng, but he was unsuccessful.</p>

  <p>He managed to escape under the siege of dozens of consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>Now when Murphy heard others mention Zheng, he felt very agitated.</p>

  <p>"There is no need to talk about Zheng surviving in the chaos, right now.</p>

  <p>There are other pressing matters at hand. We need to know who are outside the divine land and locate their positions," Nicholas said flatly.</p>

  <p>"We will know when we go and have a look," Clark said.</p>

  <p>Abelard Qin, the Holy Being of the Qin Clan, smiled and said, "Who is willing to take up the challenge and go? Are you ready to go?"</p>

  <p>"Me? There is no way I will go!" Clark vehemently shook his head.</p>

  <p>If there was a probability that the person outside was a Holy Being, then it could only mean that Bromley had come back.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Murphy believed that the people outside the divine land built an indestructible space channel in the Murphy Universe.</p>

  <p>And the one who owned such a method must be very powerful. Whether it was Bromley or someone else, anyone who dealt with it would surely be killed.</p>

  <p>At this moment, a fragile looking old man walked into the Goldenrain Hall.</p>

  <p>The old man looked quite harmless and as he walked, one could get a whiff of herbs from his body.</p>

  <p>Some of the Holy Beings sniffed and realized that the herbs were cheap ones.</p>

  <p>But they did not show any contempt for this old man, as they could not make out his cultivation base.</p>

  <p>The old man slowly walked towards the center of the Goldenrain Hall.</p>

  <p>He respectfully cupped his hands in front of the Holy Beings and said with a smile, "Someone must definitely go out. Anyways with the support of the universes, you are immortal. Even if you are killed, you will be able to revive in a few years. Then what are you afraid of?"</p>

  <p>"Master Hamish." Several Holy Beings such as Nicholas and Murphy exclaimed his name with reverence and bowed to the thin old man.</p>

  <p>"Is he the famous Master Hamish?"</p>

  <p>Abelard and the other several Holy Beings also cupped their hands and bowed.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings of the union of the powerful clans on the Floating Islands had heard stories about Hamish, but very few had seen him.</p>

  <p>"You still haven't realized the gravity of our situation. Since they sent Zheng back, they will definitely try and find other means to enter the divine land. In the past, we were unable to destroy the outer wall of the divine land, so they will face similar difficulty. However, sooner or later, they will try to break through the barrier. Back then, we spent twenty years on such a thing. If they manage to enter, how do you plan to fight against them?" Hamish asked earnestly.</p>

  <p>Hearing Hamish explain, the Holy Beings looked very tense.</p>

  <p>If even Hamish, who was an Other Shore Realm warrior, was afraid of the people from the foreign land, then the Holy Beings had no chance of not fearing at all.</p>

  <p>Just as all the Holy Beings were silent, Hamlin, the Holy Being of the Zhao Clan said, "Well, I can give it a try! Let me go this time."</p>

  <p>The Zhao Clan had just joined the elite clans on the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>With Nicholas' help, the clan's Floating Island was flourishing, but its foundation was still unstable. Thus the members of the Zhao Clan needed to do something to prove their capability to Nicholas.</p>

  <p>Seeing that no one was willing to accept the task, Hamlin had to give a shot.</p>
