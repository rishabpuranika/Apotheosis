  <p>
</p>

  <p>With casual steps, Milo approached Luo Zheng with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>He presented himself as calmly as possible with all his emotions in check.</p>

  <p>"Nice to meet you again," he said, leaning forward with a smirk.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng glanced at him with a sharp gaze. "You still haven't compensated for my sword. You owe me eight million divine crystals."</p>

  <p>"Can't you let it go? I haven't sold any Sword-reading Liquid in the past few months. So you could earn lots of divine crystals," Milo said with his shoulders held back.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked Milo directly in the eye and shrugged. "I relied on my own ability to earn them, not you."</p>

  <p>In the past, Milo had warned Luo Zheng. But when he returned to the Heart Flow Sect, someone also warned him.</p>

  <p>Only a handful of people from the palace were capable of making the Sword-reading Liquid. However, only Milo was given the privilege of selling there.</p>

  <p>Because of this opportunity, Milo had the chance to accumulate unbelievable amounts of divine crystals. But perhaps, it was now time for him to pass this privilege down to Luo Zheng, who had proven himself worthy of it.</p>

  <p>"I can give you millions of divine crystals," Milo continued with arched eyebrows. "But you will have to defeat me first. How long do you think that will take?" Milo raised his eyebrows slightly, provoking Luo Zheng clearly.</p>

  <p>None of the disciples of Heart Flow Sect could compete with Milo.</p>

  <p>In his many years residing in the Heart Flow Sect, no disciple came close to even being able to threaten him. They were worlds apart in strength. In fact, there were only two or three disciples of the same generation as him in the whole Taiyi Heaven Palace who had talents on par with his.</p>

  <p>And now, the count had increased by one more...</p>

  <p>"I'm in no such hurry, but I don't think it will take long." Luo Zheng tilted his head and raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>After hearing what Luo Zheng said, Milo nodded his head and scoffed. "I'll wait for it, but I hope it won't... take forever."</p>

  <p>Then he reached for Kate's hand and casually walked away.</p>

  <p>"Did you hear that? This guy called Luo Zheng seems to be in conflict with Milo?"</p>

  <p>"This is not the point. The point is that he can make Sword-reading Liquid!"</p>

  <p>"It turns out that he is a talent of Instant Enlightenment. No wonder...</p>

  <p>Talented people are extraordinary wherever they are!"</p>

  <p>The news from Milo came as more of a shock to them compared to Luo Zheng reaching the tenth floor of Flow Tower in his first attempt.</p>

  <p>After all, Flow Tower was just a test for the disciples of the Heart Flow Sect, to see if they had ways of resisting the Flame of Soul. However, Instant Enlightenment was a standard. Talents that met with the standard were supposed to possess boundless potential in the future.</p>

  <p>There was a huge population in the entire palace, but there were only a few talents who had the capability of Instant Enlightenment since ancient times.</p>

  <p>"Instant Enlightenment..."</p>

  <p>The glamorous woman suddenly realized it and had an annoyed look.</p>

  <p>Such a rare talent was hard to ignore for the palace, but none reminded her!</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng approached Trish and Carrie, they couldn't conceal their excitement as they welcomed him with glistening eyes.</p>

  <p>"Mr... Mr. Luo..."</p>

  <p>Remembering all the complaints and grudges she held in the past against Luo Zheng, Trish couldn't help but feel flustered.</p>

  <p>"I promised that I wouldn't let you down, didn't I? " Luo Zheng asked with a sweet smile.</p>

  <p>"Of course..." Carrie shook her head with teary eyes.</p>

  <p>"Talents like you don't need to rest and release all emotions. I'm sorry that we were oblivious to this," Trish said, bowing respectfully.</p>

  <p>"All right. Let's go," Luo Zheng said as he gestured them to leave with him.</p>

  <p>As she watched them leave, the glamorous woman called out to them from behind. "Wait."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng turned around and looked at her. "What is it?"</p>

  <p>"According to the rules of Heart Flow Sect, you and Imran should move since you have reached the seventh floor of Flow Tower," the woman said in a very polite manner as she stared at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Even though Luo Zheng was a newcomer, he had proven himself to be on the same level as Milo, maybe even surpassing him. Naturally, she would change her attitude towards him.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, an overjoyed Trish and Carrie exchanged glances between themselves. They were so excited to move that they almost accepted the offer on behalf of Luo Zheng, who stood there blankly.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng shook his head lightly and declined. "No need. I think that house is good enough."</p>

  <p>Trish's and Carrie's jaws dropped to the floor in bewilderment. They had no words to describe Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"This is not the way it should be. This is the rule of Heart Flow Sect.</p>

  <p>Please move, or you'll make things hard for me," the glamorous woman said gently, not taking no for an answer. After all, it was her duty to do this.</p>

  <p>In a dilemma, Luo Zheng curled his lips and looked at the girls. Their big bright eyes seemed to be saying, "Take it, move..."</p>

  <p>Giving in to their needs, he waved his hands in defeat and said, "All right.</p>

  <p>Let's go back to pack up. We'll move..."</p>

  <p>Watching their backs as they left, the beautiful woman named Winnie couldn't help but feel a little jealous.</p>

  <p>Lost in her train of thoughts, she bit her lip so hard that it started bleeding.</p>

  <p>Recalling back to the time when she mocked Trish made her feel horrible as it all later blew up in her face when Luo Zheng proved everyone wrong.</p>

  <p>The other girls in white felt the same emotions as Winnie. They all stood baffled.</p>

  <p>Just two hours ago, they were all collectively sympathizing with Trish and Carrie, believing that they were going to be expelled from the mountain.</p>

  <p>But time changed its course so quickly that they couldn't comprehend what had just happened. After two hours, Trish and Carrie walked alongside Luo Zheng, who was now on par with Milo, making their way to their private courtyard house. The sudden change in their situation felt like heavy hammers raining down on their chest.</p>

  <p>Those courtyard houses were exquisite and lavish.</p>

  <p>Each house had six independent smaller ones and three yards within it.</p>

  <p>For the purpose of enunciating its splendor, it was decorated with pavilions and clear ponds.</p>

  <p>But warriors like Luo Zheng had no interest in lavish living conditions, they only needed a small room and isolation to cultivate in peace.</p>

  <p>A True God could build such a house in four to six hours in any scenic place they wished, but of course not at the top of Taiyi Mountain.</p>

  <p>After exploring the courtyard house for a bit, Trish and Carrie followed close behind Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Since they had moved into a separate courtyard house and their wages had tripled, they were very grateful to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>For ordinary people, the reward of divine crystals was considerable enough.</p>

  <p>However, these women had other plans to show how grateful they were.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Zheng now understood the mechanism of Flow Tower and the importance of "releasing his emotions," he couldn't squirm his way out of this if he wanted to master the Flow Strike.</p>

  <p>Naturally, having the company of such a talented man, young women like Trish and Carrie inevitably admired him.</p>

  <p>Just as they began to fantasize about him, Luo Zheng suddenly asked, "Now that I'm living alone in this courtyard house, can I bring my wives here?"</p>

  <p>Yudie, Xi Youqin, and the others had been staying in his inner world for a long time. It was time for them to come out and breathe a little fresh air.</p>

  <p>"What? Your wives?"</p>

  <p>Trish and Carrie looked at each other with a confused expression. Trish answered, "The courtyard house is allocated to you by Heart Flow Sect.</p>

  <p>The sect won't interfere, but... You have been married?"</p>

  <p>For them, Luo Zheng was quite young. They had never expected him to have been married. The news came as a shock to them.</p>

  <p>"Yes, of course. If so, I'll invite them out," Luo Zheng said as he looked around.</p>
