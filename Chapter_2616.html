<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Pop! Pop! Pop!</p>

  <p>The vicious beasts couldn't resist Harold's fist at all.</p>

  <p>They had encountered such an attack after passing through the Purple Sky Land. Without any time to even react, they had all turned into a pool of blood mist.</p>

  <p>Weaker fierce beasts had been torn apart only by Harold's air waves.</p>

  <p>But even consummate True Gods found it difficult to deal with such beasts.</p>

  <p>In the octagonal pavilion, the scene took Hallet's breath away.</p>

  <p>"This guy� What a strong freak!"</p>

  <p>Back then, Harold was indeed also very powerful, but the gap between him and Hallet wasn't all that wide.</p>

  <p>If Hallet encountered Harold in the Arena of Legends, there would've been a 40% chance of Hallet's victory.</p>

  <p>But now, the strength that Harold displayed had put a great distance between him and Hallet� there was no doubt that it was all because of the Everest Spirit Mountain.</p>

  <p>'After Harold took control of the mountain, his strength has improved remarkably. I wonder about Gus' future progress.' While Hallet was lost in thought, he felt a sudden tremble from the fishing rod in his hand.</p>

  <p>His round eyes flashed as his expression changed. "Gus, the fishing rod is shaking! Attention!"</p>

  <p>The rod was over 10, 000 miles long, but Hallet could still feel its subtle vibration.</p>

  <p>In the lake over 10, 000 miles away, the bobber swayed intensely.</p>

  <p>Augustus held his breath in the void above it.</p>

  <p>It had been several days and nights since he settled there.</p>

  <p>The creature they intended to capture was highly alert, sensitive to every little sound and movement around it. Once it sensed any such movement, it would curl up deep within the lake.</p>

  <p>But now, it finally swallowed the bait.</p>

  <p>Augustus was still rather nervous� if it ran away again, they'd probably lose any chance of finding it again.</p>

  <p>Plop! Plop! Plop!</p>

  <p>The undulation in the water grew more and more violent, indicating the restlessness of the creature there.</p>

  <p>In the fairy palace, Hallet suddenly stood up and raised his arm like a lotus root, tugging hard on the fishing rod. Simultaneously, he said to Augustus through his life vitality, "It is time!"</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>As he pulled the rod, his strength was transmitted over 10, 000 miles away into the lake.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The bobber floated up the lake's surface and was pulled out of the water along with a little yellow creature.</p>

  <p>It was only about the size of a single palm and as round as a calabash.</p>

  <p>Two little dots lay in the center of the calabash, like the eyes of a human, with small limbs around the body� it looked like a small, underdeveloped person.</p>

  <p>The creature was the soul of the Swirl Forest, the key to controlling the forest.</p>

  <p>In the innermost part of the Swirl Forest, the lake and the lairs of several fierce animals lay there.</p>

  <p>Once anyone got close to the lake, the nearby creatures would be alerted.</p>

  <p>Dealing with these beasts was no easy thing� once any movement was detected, the soul of the forest would hide deep within the lake, making it impossible to even see, let alone catch.</p>

  <p>Attempts to obtain this creature usually ended in failure.</p>

  <p>But this time, Joy alone had managed to stop all the fierce creatures from entering the woods.</p>

  <p>No matter how loud the sounds around the lake were, they were completely blocked out by the Purple Sky Land.</p>

  <p>"It's time!"</p>

  <p>At this moment, Augustus turned deadly serious.</p>

  <p>Hallet had poured great effort into getting this one opportunity� if he messed it up, it would have all been in vain.</p>

  <p>The moment Augustus left the void, his hands intertwined as they reached for the soul of the forest.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>He moved extremely fast� when the soul of the forest noticed his presence, it had already been gripped tightly in his hands.</p>

  <p>"Squeak! Squeak! Squeak!"</p>

  <p>The little creature cried out in panic as it struggled to squirm out of Augustus' grasp.</p>

  <p>A layer of pale yellow membrane seeped out its surface, making it so slippery that it slid right out of Augustus' hands.</p>

  <p>"You're still trying to escape?"</p>

  <p>Augustus' face darkened as he squeezed into the void, making a circular space crack appear.</p>

  <p>By then, he had already completely closed the space around the soul of the forest.</p>

  <p>Squeak! Squeak! Squeak!</p>

  <p>The soul of the forest began screaming wildly in its struggle.</p>

  <p>Then, the entire Swirl Forest came to life.</p>

  <p>The trees that towered tens of thousands of feet tall swayed wildly and the eyes of every ferocious beast and bug turned red as blood.</p>

  <p>They rushed to the lake in a frenzy to save the soul of the forest.</p>

  <p>But because of the Purple Sky Land, all the beasts were sent to the fairy palace for Harold to deal with� he was under greater pressure now.</p>

  <p>Even the water in the lake seemed to have its own consciousness� it turned into a pile of sharp water swords and rushed toward Augustus.</p>

  <p>"Humph!"</p>

  <p>Augustus grunted, allowing the swords to stab him as he once again reached out to hold the soul of the forest tighter in his hands.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, he instantly shot dozens of complex fingerprints from his hands.</p>

  <p>A special pattern was formed in the void after each fingerprint was made.</p>

  <p>The more fingerprints there were, the stronger the impact was on the creature.</p>

  <p>When Augustus finished shooting the fingerprints, the soul of the forest finally gave up its struggle.</p>

  <p>A smile then replaced Augustus' grave expression. He sat in the air, crossing one leg over the other, and placed the soul of the forest in front of his elixir field.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>A soft light shot into the sky from the lake's center.</p>

  <p>After a while, the entire Swirl Forest fell into silence once again.</p>

  <p>The originally aggressive beasts calmed down as well and turned around to leave the scene.</p>

  <p>Atop the tree, Joy sighed in relief. It was indeed no easy thing to control a forbidden land.</p>

  <p>Standing in a pool of blood in the fairy palace, Harold gasped for breath.</p>

  <p>The huge square was filled with the acrid smell of blood� the liquid had reached up to his knees. One could only imagine how many beasts he had killed there.</p>

  <p>"It's over. Saul, let Yan, Geoffrey, and the others come out," Hallet sighed heavily in relief.</p>

  <p>At long last, they had fulfilled the heavy task their master had charged them with.</p>

  <p>After being locked up for so long, Geoffrey, Yudie, Yan, Xun, and the others finally left the training tower.</p>

  <p>But the moment they stepped out, the bloody scene before them frightened them.</p>

  <p>"So many beasts were killed!" Geoffrey exclaimed, wide-eyed in surprise.</p>

  <p>Xun inhaled the air� she had missed the taste of blood after killing.</p>

  <p>"Did you succeed?"</p>

  <p>Hallet nodded once and pointed to the air.</p>

  <p>A faint halo of light appeared in the void. Within it was Augustus' body resting quietly.</p>

  <p>After being integrated with the soul of the forest, his temperament had undergone a great change. His long black eyebrows were also stained and now a light golden color.</p>

  <p>But Augustus was wearing a strange expression as he said to Hallet, "I saw the Big Mouth we met in the dungeon. Didn't Zheng release him? Why did he come to the Swirl Forest? It looks like he's with a woman."</p>

  <p>After controlling the Swirl Forest, Augustus could feel every single thing in the forest� he had found Wayne and Margaret at the edge of the forest.</p>
