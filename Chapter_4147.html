  <p>
</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng arrived at the edge of the primitive land, he approached the huge plants which resembled bamboo shoots with great caution.</p>

  <p>When these plants reached their current size, their cyan color faded and was replaced by a golden sheen. They appeared very sturdy and strong.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng was about to move closer, the plants in the shape of bamboo shoots that had intertwined to resemble dog teeth suddenly separated and began to snap at Luo Zheng within a few seconds.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was not prepared and barely had any time to dodge. His whole body was bitten, ground, and chewed to pieces by the teeth.</p>

  <p>Luckily for him, it was just an avatar.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>On the continent at the center of the primitive land, Luo Zheng's avatar condensed again. He appeared angry and disgraced.</p>

  <p>In the past, he had always had complete control over his inner world though it was still quite small.</p>

  <p>Now that it had expanded, he couldn't believe that he was bound to it instead of the other way around.</p>

  <p>"Do you want to fight with me?" Luo Zheng challenged, looking into the blood mist in the sky.</p>

  <p>Just then, a thick cloud of blood mist floated in the air above him like an animal taunting its prey.</p>

  <p>"Then come on!" Luo Zheng's said coldly.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, he had an idea.</p>

  <p>The continents floated in the sky had linked to one another.</p>

  <p>As long as he remained on these continents, Luo Zheng was omniscient. He had to use this to his advantage.</p>

  <p>"Crack, crack, crack..."</p>

  <p>As the continents connected, Luo Zheng stretched out his hand and grabbed in the air.</p>

  <p>The newly combined continent rose and eventually, reached the highest point of the primitive land.</p>

  <p>Before Luo Zheng knew it, the blood mist that came from the ancestry-level bloodline hovered right above his head.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng slowly stretched out his hand and immersed it in the blood mist,</p>

  <p>"Seize it!"</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh...</p>

  <p>A powerful storm formed at the center of Luo Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>With one toss, the storm swept up and with astonishing speed, sucked the floating blood mist within seconds.</p>

  <p>"Hiss, hiss, hiss..."</p>

  <p>The ancestry-level bloodline wouldn't go down without a fight.</p>

  <p>It morphed into blood red winged bugs in an attempt to escape the storm.</p>

  <p>However, a storm created by the all-powerful creator could not be resisted. This was the general rule of any inner world.</p>

  <p>Though this was a special case as the primitive land was wrapped around the inner world, the rule still applied within the range of the continent.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Eventually, as a large amount of the blood mist was sucked into the storm, the storm became tinted with red.</p>

  <p>On that note, the ancestry-level bloodline counterattacked.</p>

  <p>The plants in the shape of bamboo shoots at the edge of the primitive land turned and pierced towards the continent. All of a sudden, thousands of stalagmites sprouted from the bottom of the primitive land and shot straight up into the sky!</p>

  <p>If no one put a stop to the plants and stalagmites, it would only be a matter of minutes until the entire continent would be smashed into pieces.</p>

  <p>However, just as they approached the continent, Luo Zheng's eyes flashed and an invisible space wall appeared at the edge of the continent.</p>

  <p>His almighty abilities made the space wall indestructible.</p>

  <p>"Crack, crack, crack..."</p>

  <p>The plants in the shape of bamboo shoots rushed towards the space wall but could not penetrate it.</p>

  <p>The stalagmites that grew from the ground met the space wall and shattered!</p>

  <p>"Though you are powerful, this is my inner world. I am still in charge here!"</p>

  <p>"Whoosh..."</p>

  <p>The storm that was once a small ball in Luo Zheng's hand spread out and covered more areas. He controlled the continent to move in the primitive land as it absorbed all the ancestry-level bloodline it could find.</p>

  <p>Drip, drip, drip...</p>

  <p>Once the blood mist was completely sucked into the storm, it returned to Luo Zheng's palm and became drops of viscous blood.</p>

  <p>Before, Luo Zheng could do nothing to the ancestry-level bloodline. When the bloodline was driven mad, it took control of Luo Zheng's body without hesitation.</p>

  <p>Now that Luo Zheng brought the ancestry-level bloodline into his inner world, the tables had turned.</p>

  <p>The ancestry-level bloodline that gathered into a ball formed into a bloody human. It reached out and grabbed Luo Zheng's chest.</p>

  <p>"Puff!"</p>

  <p>The hand grasped Luo Zheng's chest and turned into threads that drilled through Luo Zheng's body. He was sliced into a thousand miniscule pieces.</p>

  <p>It was a good thing that this was only Luo Zheng's avatar. Within a moment, another avatar appeared and grinned at the "bloody man".</p>

  <p>"Puff!"</p>

  <p>The bloody man showed no mercy. He raised his hand, gripped Luo Zheng, and began to slice through the avatar once again.</p>

  <p>Not long after, Luo Zheng's third avatar appeared. He decided to go with a different approach. "We should sit down and have a good talk."</p>

  <p>He had a feeling if he'd attacked, the same thing would have happened again. When Luo Zheng spoke calmly, the bloody man calmed down. He did not attack Luo Zheng again, but he did not respond either.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng let out a huge sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>Ever since he fused with the ancestry-level bloodline, Luo Zheng exerted much effort to communicate with it. However, the ancestry-level bloodline always ignored him and acted on its own thoughts.</p>

  <p>Now, the bloodline no longer resisted his communication.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng raised his hand and two chairs appeared before them. He gestured for the man to sit before he made his way to his own chair.</p>

  <p>The bloody man silently looked at Luo Zheng and sat down. The moment he sat down, he mimicked Luo Zheng's body but was still made up of blood.</p>

  <p>"If it weren't for the primitive land, you'd be no match for me," the bloody man spoke out. Not only did he mimic Luo Zheng's body, but his voice, too.</p>

  <p>The ancestry-level bloodline could analyze all kinds of energy and deal with any bloodline power, no matter how strong they were.</p>

  <p>Now that it was connected to the primitive land, it became bound to the rules. This was the main reason Luo Zheng could take it back when it was merely blood mist. If not for the primitive land, even if Luo Zheng were ten times stronger than he was now, he wouldn't have been able to do anything to the bloodline.</p>

  <p>"Ah, so you could talk even before? Why did you keep silent all the time?" Luo Zheng asked with smile.</p>

  <p>Spiritual creatures could gain extraordinary wisdom after they lived a long time. The ancestry-level bloodline was no exception to this.</p>

  <p>"Because I had to observe you well," the bloody man said, emotionless.</p>

  <p>"Observe me for what?" Luo Zheng raised an eyebrow.</p>

  <p>"To see if you are trustworthy," the bloody man nodded.</p>

  <p>After the ancestry-level bloodline was brought back by the Bird Spirit King Sheehan, it had been trapped in the Eternal Divine Courtyard.</p>

  <p>During those years, the Four Spirits Sect kept exploiting its power.</p>

  <p>It had no clue where it came from nor whom it belonged to. The bloodline spent its life aimlessly.</p>

  <p>When it decided Luo Zheng was an excellent host, it wasted no time and immediately integrated with him.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng carried the ancestry-level bloodline, the bloodline reconstructed Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"You have become a part of me. Don't I deserve your trust?" Luo Zheng said welcomingly.</p>

  <p>The bloody man coldly glanced up at Luo Zheng and looked back down. "In a world that has been downgraded, no one could be trusted. Not even you..."</p>

  <p>"Downgraded?" Luo Zheng shook his head in confusion, "What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>The bloody man sighed and continued to explain, "If a creature in the main world becomes a creature in the chaos, it has been downgraded.</p>

  <p>After the Monkey Masters died, they became Treacherous Beings. That, is a kind of downgrade."</p>
