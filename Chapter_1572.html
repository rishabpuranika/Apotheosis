  <p>
</p>



  <p>
</p>

  <p>"There are a total of thirteen giant eyeballs. These eyeballs should represent some kind of vital symbol of the sorcerer race. They might even represent the supreme existence of their tribe..."</p>

  <p>Previously, Luo Zheng had speculated that this enormous Illusion Battlefield could have been constructed according to the omnipotent will of the heavens, and that this will contained the vast expanse of memories from the heavens.</p>

  <p>During this grand era, it contained all of these: the civilizations that were created, the civilizations that were destroyed, and the civilizations that had survived. They all appeared one after another in the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>For example, the temple that Luo Zheng had entered was derived from the Blessed Buddha Land.</p>

  <p>And this Sacred Ailanthus in front of him contained the origins from the sorcerer race.</p>

  <p>In the vast universe, after billions of years had passed, there were countless new civilizations that had formed.</p>

  <p>Some civilizations were short-lived and disappeared into the river of history, becoming mere flotsam in the grand scheme of things. Others grew stronger and thrived, such as the human race, the Demon Night, and so on.</p>

  <p>In that temple, Luo Zheng had obtained a Teleportation Token that had allowed him to freely travel through this supreme world.</p>

  <p>What then awaited him at the top of the Sacred Ailanthus?</p>

  <p>If for being safe and sound, then Luo Zheng could have chosen to not enter this place. Moreover, he could use the Teleportation Token to escape from any predicament, now that he could use it again!</p>

  <p>Actually, there was nothing that would threaten his life, since everyone and everything in the Illusion Battlefield were only projections. But all of the warriors were working hard, and Luo Zheng obviously would not choose to retreat from a fight.</p>

  <p>Moreover, he had just checked his ranking. Although he had obtained over two million Illusion Points, in the end his ranking didn't rise but fell!</p>

  <p>The warriors ranked ahead of Luo Zheng had either used some special methods to plunder more Illusion Points, or had discovered something that Luo Zheng had yet to find.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng didn't want to fight now, his ranking would plummet!</p>

  <p>Outside the gray fog, those huge eyeballs were just quietly floating in the air, without any conscious movement, as if they were just part of a strange background.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng naturally was unworried and didn't care about them. He stood there hesitating for a moment, and then suddenly jumped up!</p>

  <p>Since he was unable to find a way through this maze, he didn't want to waste too much time on it. Thus, with a leap, he flew up into the air.</p>

  <p>No matter how complex the maze was, it could not extend into the sky.</p>

  <p>Besides, there was no ban on flying above the Sacred Ailanthus.</p>

  <p>"Huff, huff …"</p>

  <p>Although there was a thick, gray fog obscuring most of the sky in front of him, with the help of his magic vision ability, Luo Zheng was able to glean a good look at the surroundings above the tree.</p>

  <p>The top of the tree covered a vast space. It was a treetop shaped like a mountain. It sloped upwards at an angle of thirty degrees, and covered an area about the size of a city. Luo Zheng could cross it in a few seconds with his fast speed.</p>

  <p>There was a ball of purple light swaying slightly on the tallest bough of the tree, but Luo Zheng was too far away from that light ball, so he couldn't tell what it was.</p>

  <p>"Huff…"</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng flew along the treetop for a long time, he suddenly stopped mid-air and his gaze instantly froze!</p>

  <p>As he flew, he had used the ball of purple light as a point of reference.</p>

  <p>However, after flying for a long time, the distance between him and the ball of purple light hadn't changed at all!</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng looked down, he saw the three skulls placed together, which marked the starting point of his flight.</p>

  <p>"There is some sort of power spreading throughout this maze that binds me here. Is it formed by the Space Law?"</p>

  <p>It was definitely impossible for an ordinary maze to have such an effect.</p>

  <p>The only possible reason for Luo Zheng to hover in the air was because the maze had been created by the Space Law.</p>

  <p>As he thought of this, Luo Zheng suddenly flashed a step forward. This time, he was moving through space.</p>

  <p>His figure became a long shadow, disappearing from one location and only to reappear in another place.</p>

  <p>After a few more steps, the ball of purple light at the top of the tree was getting closer and closer to Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>"It works?!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was overjoyed at his progress!</p>

  <p>However, just as he was shuttling through space again, he uttered a stifled groan as his body impacted with something, causing him to stagger and fall from space.</p>

  <p>He had bumped into an invisible barrier when he was shuttling through space.</p>

  <p>Then he found himself have returned to his original spot.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the bitter hint of a wry smile appeared on Zheng's face. He was truly helpless! This was a sensation that Luo Zheng was not familiar or comfortable with. Luo Zheng had always found a way to move ahead.</p>

  <p>"Plop, plop …"</p>

  <p>A heartbeat sound made Zheng's eyebrows wrinkle slightly. The predicament before him was indeed a thorny dilemma to deal with.</p>

  <p>Despite the time and efforts that Luo Zheng had expended, he once again descended on the treetop. His eyes were staring at these large skulls, while his mind continued to gnaw at the issues.</p>

  <p>These skulls were twice as tall as Luo Zheng and shaped almost like a house.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had not paid them much heed before, but as he walked back and forth, he realized that the heartbeat sounds became louder or quieter as he came closer to, or withdrew from the skulls.</p>

  <p>It was this slight difference that had caused Luo Zheng to notice the skulls.</p>

  <p>He walked forward and rubbed tentatively at the surface of the skull with his hand.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes flashed slightly, and he then exerted some of the strength in his hands!</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>A crack appeared on the surface of the skull, jaggedly extending from the cheekbone all the way to the top of the skull.</p>

  <p>With his eyes following the fissure, Luo Zheng once again struck out with his palm, and the huge skull finally disintegrated.</p>

  <p>"Boom…"</p>

  <p>The moment the skull split open, a figure was revealed within. The figure was black in color, and looked like it was one-third the size of an ordinary human! It was wrapped in a tattered cloth, and its gaunt body could be vaguely seen through the rags.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh…"</p>

  <p>The figure suddenly disappeared into another skull in a flash, before Luo Zheng could get a closer look at it.</p>

  <p>"This is… a Shadow Creature!"</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng had been in the Lower World, he had seen this type of creature before!</p>

  <p>With a single glance, Luo Zheng had formed a very deep impression of this rugged type of figure. At that time, there had been a group of Shadow Creatures chasing after him and several Celestial Position members.</p>

  <p>Why would he now meet a Shadow Creature here?</p>

  <p>Could it be that this ancient sorcerer race was in fact the Shadow Race that had once been cursed by gods?</p>

  <p>He had barely chased the creature out, and then the heartbeat sounds in his ears also disappeared. It seemed like it was all because of that Shadow Creature.</p>

  <p>Thinking of this, Luo Zheng no longer felt any hesitation. His figure flashed as he stepped in front of the next gigantic skull.</p>

  <p>The skulls of the Giant were not durable in nature at all. Faced with Zheng's divine weapon body, their bones were like paper and he quickly crashed into one skull.</p>

  <p>However, in the moment that Luo Zheng crashed into it, two rugged black shadows appeared from the huge eye sockets of the skull.</p>

  <p>"Two?</p>

  <p>These skulls are all hiding these creatures?"</p>

  <p>"Whoosh …"</p>

  <p>This time, Luo Zheng did not plan on letting the creatures slip into the next skull. He wanted to catch one and launch a thorough investigation.</p>

  <p>These dark figures weren't very big, but their speed was indeed incredibly fast. Although Luo Zheng had activated his bodily movement skill, he was only able to grab a piece of the tattered cloth fluttering behind them.</p>

  <p>"Tss, tss …"</p>

  <p>The strip of cloth in Zheng's hand had suddenly turned into columns of black gas, which ate corrosively at his fingers. This thing also had poison on it.</p>

  <p>If it had been someone else, even their bones would have been corroded.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng's expression did not change at all, and he continued to chase after the black figures.</p>

  <p>"Gila— "</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng chased after one of them, while the other black figure extended its jagged fingers. The curved nails on its fingers were like the claws of a wild beast, and it was chanting an incantation.</p>

  <p>Although he knew that this ancient sorcerer race's spells were powerful, Luo Zheng had no time to care about that right now. He had to capture this thing first!</p>

  <p>Although the dark figure was nimble, its speed was still a lot slower than Zheng's. When Luo Zheng extended his hand, that black figure could no longer dodge. It was firmly pressed onto the ground by Luo Zheng who lifted off its cloak at once!</p>

  <p>The moment the cloak was lifted free, it turned into wisps of black fog that started to dissipate immediately. The figure in front of him did indeed look human, but its entire body was pitch black and there was no skin on its hands and feet. Instead, a shining hard shell covered all of its body.</p>

  <p>"Gila— "</p>

  <p>The thing that Luo Zheng was holding on to ground seemed to know that it could not escape, and was also chanting an incantation in a strange language.</p>

  <p>Two black vortexes appeared next to Luo Zheng, and two palm-sized skulls emerged from the two black vortexes.</p>

  <p>These skulls were exactly the same as the ones that Luo Zheng had seen earlier on the plates. The only difference was that these skulls had opened their mouths and were moving towards Luo Zheng to bite him!</p>
