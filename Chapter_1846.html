<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The barbarian bee queen didn't have any wings, and looked more like a large worm than a bee. Its tail was stuck up like a scorpion's, with a cluster of black thorns on its tip!</p>

  <p>The barbarian bee queen looked bloated and heavy, but its movements were quick. When Luo Luo Zheng blocked its black light, its twelve posterior legs moved rapidly and charged towards Luo Luo Zheng at a tremendously fast speed.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng saw the queen charging forwards, he turned back and ran!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng looked back at Teigan of Collapsing Mountain race and saw that he was already thousand feet ahead. Luo Zheng's lips couldn't help but twitch in a small smile. It seemed that the Collapsing Mountain race wasn't as fearless as they seemed.</p>

  <p>However, Teigan couldn't be blamed. His courage was based on his ability of being able to take a gamble.</p>

  <p>Escaping from the barbarian bee queen was something that anyone with an ounce of sense would have done.</p>

  <p>Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh!</p>

  <p>At that moment, Luo Luo Zheng was also intensely focused. Every step his feet made was executed with extreme precision. His movement speed was even faster than Teigan!</p>

  <p>Teigan was raised in the Collapsing Mountain race since he was born. He was also one of the most outstanding younger generation members. Luo Luo Zheng might even lose to him in a contest of pure strength.</p>

  <p>However, the Collapsing Mountain race was accustomed to only using their strength to its maximum. They did not know much about moves, techniques, etc. In this type of ecological environment, they did not need to master all. Different races lived in various environments, so the path of different races varied.</p>

  <p>As Teigan ran ahead, he occasionally turned his head back to check Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>When he saw the barbarian bee queen behind Luo Luo Zheng, it grimaced as if it ate something bad. Teigan sprinted forward with all his might.</p>

  <p>In general, the test at Sacred Spring Mountain wasn't too risky, but there was still a certain death rate. Every year, during the coming-of-age ceremony, the Collapsing Mountain race would lose three or four people.</p>

  <p>Some of the other races' warriors would also die in Sacred Spring Mountain.</p>

  <p>However, being killed by the barbarian bee queen was even more unlucky. After all, this thing shouldn't have been here in the first place.</p>

  <p>As Teigan ran, his thoughts went wild, and his distracted mind failed to focus on his next step. He missed!</p>

  <p>He was stunned for a moment before he rolled downwards again. He was incredibly curious as to why there was such a huge pit here!</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng saw Teigan's figure disappear suddenly in front of him, he immediately understood that Teigan had fallen down.</p>

  <p>A spark of hope lit up on Luo Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>If he continued on this straight path, he would be caught by the barbarian bee queen sooner or later and be killed for sure! A passageway that led downwards would be the best thing to happen right now.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Along with the sound of the wind that whipped past him, Luo Zheng's heart jolted. He suddenly jumped up, launching himself into the air!</p>

  <p>The faintly discernible beam of black light flashed right past Luo Zheng's lower body. It hit the rock wall on the side and immediately corroded a large hole in it.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng borrowed the momentum from his descent to step into the place where Teigan disappeared. According to Luo Zheng's calculations, this must be a pit that led downwards.</p>

  <p>But as he fell, his expression suddenly changed into one of surprise. He saw Teigan climb up out of the pit. As Luo Luo Zheng fell, he directly stepped on him and landed on his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"You!"</p>

  <p>Just as Teigan was about to speak, he was kicked into the pit by Luo Luo Zheng...</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng used Teigan's shoulder as he leaped up and somersaulted into the air.</p>

  <p>His expression immediately turned sour. The place where Teigan fell was just a huge pit and not a passageway downward!</p>

  <p>Teigan was stomped back into the pit by Luo Luo Zheng, but he quickly crawled back out again. At that moment, he had no desire to blame on Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Fleeing for his life was his priority.</p>

  <p>The two of them continued to run forward. The barbarian bee queen's speed was obviously way faster, and it got closer and closer to them!</p>

  <p>Eventually, the two of them arrived at the end of the road. Their hearts sank at what they saw. The end of this road did not connect with the other caves. It was a dead end...</p>

  <p>The barbarian bee queen was still on their heels. They had already retreated to the end of this road. The silver stone wall behind them was extremely sturdy and seemed indestructible.</p>

  <p>As they looked at the rapidly approaching barbarian bee queen, the two of them became more and more anxious. With their combined strength, they wondered if they had the ability to fight the barbarian bee queen head on. They didn't seem to have a choice!</p>

  <p>"This barbarian bee queen might be the same as the barbarian bees, and its defensive power is not?"</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng was speaking, he suddenly heard the sound, "patter, patter". He looked up and saw that this ten-foot tall Collapsing Mountain race warrior was actually bawling. "What do we do now, hoo woo..."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had originally been extremely nervous, but when he saw that the big guy was actually crying, he couldn't help but roll his eyes. He had planned to cooperate with this fellow just now, but who would have thought that he would break down.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had no one to rely on but himself. His gaze swept over and he summoned a long bow into his hand.</p>

  <p>He drew the string and released the arrow!</p>

  <p>Clap clap!</p>

  <p>The sharp arrow accelerated and flew straight towards the barbarian bee queen.</p>

  <p>However, due to the powerful force of gravity, the arrow's speed was greatly decreased. Before the arrow even reached the barbarian bee queen, its power had already been used up. The barbarian bee queen disgustedly brushed the arrow away with its thin forelegs.</p>

  <p>The barbarian bee queen was angered, most probably due to Luo Zheng's resistance. Perhaps it was aware that the two prey in front still had thoughts of fighting back, so it raised its tail and shot three bee stings at them!</p>

  <p>"Dodge!"</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng ducked down, he saw that the strong man beside him was still bawling his eyes out. With a sweep of Luo Zheng's leg, the strong man too was thrown to the ground!</p>

  <p>Pop, pop, pop!</p>

  <p>Three sharp stings stuck on the rock wall behind them, and caused it to melt continuously.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng lay flat on the ground. He took advantage of his momentum and nocked another arrow. He shook the bowstring and let the arrow loose again!</p>

  <p>It was as ineffective as the one before. Luo Luo Zheng knew that if he didn't counterattack, the barbarian bee queen would've pounced on him immediately.</p>

  <p>Indeed.</p>

  <p>Under Luo Zheng's continuous attacks, the barbarian bee queen halted its advance. After it waved away his arrow, the barbarian bee queen raised its tail once again!</p>

  <p>Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh!</p>

  <p>Another three stings shot forward!</p>

  <p>Although Teigan was extremely depressed at the moment, he didn't want to die. He and Luo Luo Zheng crawled up at the same time and avoided those sharp stings!</p>

  <p>"You want to deplete the stings on the tail of the barbarian bee queen?"</p>

  <p>Teigan seemed to sense a glimmer of hope.</p>

  <p>The stings on the barbarian bee queen's tail were as plentiful as grass, around fifty to sixty of them. It had already shot a portion of them along the way, and now they seemed to be scarcer.</p>

  <p>If they could really deplete the stings on the tail of the barbarian bee queen, they might have a chance of survival.</p>

  <p>However, right after Teigan finished speaking, the barbarian bee queen waved its tail. Long barbarian bee stings grew out from its tail again, and it looked like there were more stings than before.</p>

  <p>"Well, forget it. I didn't say anything?" The flicker of hope that had just ignited in Teigan's eyes was immediately quenched once again.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng also furrowed his brows. He thought of the same thing, but at that moment he suddenly felt a chill behind his back. When he turned around, a strange look appeared on his face!</p>

  <p>"Look behind us, quick!" he reminded Teigan.</p>

  <p>Teigan looked backward and immediately revealed an ecstatic expression.</p>

  <p>The stone wall behind them was the end of the path. As the barbarian bee queen had shot three stings at the wall, a fist-sized hole had been punched into it!</p>

  <p>This hole was so deep that one couldn't see the bottom. A cool breeze blew through it.</p>

  <p>"So this rock wall is actually very thin!"</p>

  <p>Teigan's face was filled with surprise as he smashed his fist against another part of the wall, hoping that he could use his brute force to break it.</p>

  <p>However, this silver rock was too hard for their fists. Even if it was just a thin layer of rock, it wasn't something they could break. Maybe Chapman could break through it.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng shook his head and could do nothing but sigh at the fellow's stupidity. He quietly nocked an arrow onto the longbow again.</p>

  <p>"Prepare to dodge," Luo Luo Zheng said as he released the bowstring.</p>

  <p>He hadn't expected the arrow to kill the barbarian bee queen. He was now luring it to continue shooting its stings so the rock wall would be opened behind them. That would give them a chance to escape!</p>

  <p>Although Teigan's brain was not working at the moment, the barbarian bee queen was even worse. It was its instinct to immediately retaliate after it received an attack.</p>

  <p>The barbarian bee queen was unwittingly extremely cooperative. As Luo Zheng's arrow shot out, it also shot out three beams of black light.</p>
