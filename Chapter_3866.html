<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The eyes of the man in black clothes were devoid of emotions.</p>

  <p>When people looked at him, they got an impression of a tightened bow simmering with a surging power that could be released any time.</p>

  <p>His emotions were like deep water in a tranquil lake. He looked outwardly composed, as if he was merely taking a walk in his courtyard. But everyone could sense that there was great power concealed below the surface.</p>

  <p>No one could see through his real thoughts, not even Othniel.</p>

  <p>"I asked nicely but since it didn't work, I'll have to use my fists," the man in black said in a flat tone.</p>

  <p>It was as if declaring war on a Chaos Ancient God was quite common for him.</p>

  <p>Although Othniel considered him a strong enemy, he had no intention of backing down. He threw Luo Zheng into the void and pointed at him so that a space cage instantly formed around Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Even if Luo Zheng were to suddenly wake up and fight back, he would not be able to escape from the space cage. No one could help him break it from the outside either. It would be a difficult task even for the Eternal Realm masters present.</p>

  <p>But much to the shock of everyone watching, the moment Luo Zheng touched the bottom of the space cage, he completely absorbed the energy shaping the floor and his body was quickly dropped from the cage.</p>

  <p>Everyone was amused and was rendered speechless. Shera couldn't help but snigger.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's physical body had been in such a strange state that even Othniel had made mistakes dealing with it more than once.</p>

  <p>They had so far noticed that Luo Zheng would absorb all the power around him except for the brass man's Combat Dragon Absorb. Perhaps it was a mere coincidence, or perhaps it was because of the inferior power of the Combat Dragon Absorb.</p>

  <p>For what it was worth, Shera's conjecture was very close to the truth.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't really absorb all sorts of power. The process only occurred according to the map on the square. It was true that the power of the Combat Dragon Absorb was not superior enough for Luo Zheng to absorb it.</p>

  <p>Othniel's power on the other hand, was an excellent option. Every time Othniel used the power of space against Luo Zheng, Luo Zheng's body immediately devoured it.</p>

  <p>This occurred multiple times before a new light column appeared in the space-time quadrant of the map, rising rapidly.</p>

  <p>Even when Luo Zheng fell from the sky, the black-clothed man looked to be in no hurry to snatch him.</p>

  <p>Othniel was embarrassed, teleporting almost instantly to Luo Zheng's side. He caught Luo Zheng, flew up to the Xuanyuan, and handed Luo Zheng over to him as he said, "Protect him well."</p>

  <p>And then, Othniel rose back to the same height as the man in black.</p>

  <p>Frowning in confusion, Xuanyuan turned to look at Fuxi and the Snake Goddess, whom Othniel still had in his trap.</p>

  <p>The Li Shan mountain was a great force not only because it had the support of the Chaos Ancient God. Fuxi and the Snake Goddess themselves were very powerful warriors.</p>

  <p>Whatever was happening was heavily disadvantageous to the Snake Goddess and Fuxi. Irrespective of who won, the result would be unacceptable for Li Shan mountain. The best result for them, perhaps, would be for Othniel and the man to fight like Kilkenny cats.</p>

  <p>But Fuxi and the Snake Goddess remained quite calm and composed. Did they have a trump card up their sleeve?</p>

  <p>As Xuanyuan wondered about this, a dazzling blue light, even brighter than the sun, shone out of the sky. Everyone squinted in the sudden glare of light.</p>

  <p>When the blue flare finally disappeared, a long transparent blue saber appeared in Othniel's hand. It was obviously a weapon he had created with the power of space.</p>

  <p>Othniel rarely chose to fight face to face. Most times, he only needed to exile his opponents, the way Mount had exiled Luo Zheng into the Deleting Space.</p>

  <p>Othniel had exiled Gerald as well, when he hadn't been careful enough.</p>

  <p>But this man before him caused a deep need of annihilation within Othniel.</p>

  <p>With a sudden wave of the long saber in his hand, he split the space in front of him in half, creating a huge space crack.</p>

  <p>The space crack extended like the mouth of a huge fish as it loomed over the man in black.</p>

  <p>The man in black raised an eyebrow and gently tilted his body. A wisp of cyan light thick as a finger surged into the sky, shooting up to millions of feet away.</p>

  <p>A three-foot-long thin sword appeared in his hand, his usual weapon, the Cyan Misty Sword.</p>

  <p>"Flash, my sword!"</p>

  <p>The moment the man in black brandished his sword, he disappeared into thin air.</p>

  <p>He and his sword had turned into a cyan glow that spread throughout the sky, shooting towards Othniel.</p>

  <p>The space crack that Othniel had created disappeared the moment it met the cyan glow. The space power seemed unable to withstand even a single blow.</p>

  <p>Othniel was not that shocked even though his first strike had so easily dissolved.</p>

  <p>Instead, he looked up at the sky, trying to track the man in black's position.</p>

  <p>If they were in the same space, no one could ever avoid Othniel's detection.</p>

  <p>It was his talent that neither did he need to search for his opponent's aura nor did he have to use his spiritual sense to scan the space. He simply sensed everything that existed in the space around him. This ability of Othniel's was similar to the one that Usman had.</p>

  <p>To his surprise, though, the man in black seemed to have completely disappeared in the cyan glow. How was this possible? Othniel was gobsmacked for a moment, finding it hard to accept this truth.</p>

  <p>"The space truth is the highest rule in the chaos. You can't completely grasp it even as a Son of Truth. What you've comprehended is only a small part of it."</p>

  <p>The voice of the man in black sounded from behind Othniel.</p>

  <p>Othniel turned around abruptly, bringing the space saber in his hand slashing down in the direction of the voice.</p>

  <p>Others might have misjudged the direction, but Othniel never made such mistakes.</p>

  <p>He struck the sword three times in a row.</p>

  <p>The azure blue space slashes were fast enough to split everything in their path, including the space itself.</p>

  <p>A large number of space cracks emerged as the space slashes swept across the sky. The sky was like a book, and these space cracks were like pages that had been torn off from the book. The space itself looked miraculous under Othniel's formidable power.</p>

  <p>The structure of the space itself was completely destroyed. If the man in black was hiding himself in the space, he would split into countless pieces as well.</p>

  <p>But Othniel still couldn't see any signs of the man.</p>

  <p>"Since what you've grasped is only a part of the space truth, you also have blind spots in space."</p>

  <p>The man's voice echoed again. Othniel lifted the space saber but discovered that he couldn't determine the direction of the voice this time. The man's voice seemed to come from the depths of his mind. How was he doing that?</p>

  <p>Just as Othniel was looking around incredulously, a beam of cyan light suddenly shot out from behind him.</p>

  <p>It pierced through Othniel's back and continued to shoot straight ahead, crossing several provinces, boundary walls, and thick earth along the way before it shot straight out of the Source World and into the chaos.</p>

  <p>Since the cyan light was only as thick as a little finger, it didn't create a hole large enough for the chaotic energy from the outside to flow into the Source World. But it had killed innumerable innocent creatures on its way out.</p>

  <p>The small wound wasn't much trouble for Othniel. He only felt a slight pain in his back, and he brought his saber down behind him a few more times.</p>

  <p>Large areas of space were destroyed, but the man in black seemed not to exist. Othniel's strikes had nearly destroyed everything in the space behind him, but he still failed to touch the man in black.</p>
