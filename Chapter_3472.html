<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Evil God narrowed his eyes a tad bit. He wanted to know what Luo Zheng was up to.</p>

  <p>"To a certain extent, you are me," Luo Zheng continued. "Or rather, you are all the evil thoughts and resentment I have projected onto this world."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was well aware that the world had its own will.</p>

  <p>Before the Evil God's appearance, Luo Zheng's inner world was a mess. Conflicts between various races erupted so often, and even the humans were constantly competing against each other. So long as Luo Zheng wasn't interfering, many ambitious creatures caused much disturbance.</p>

  <p>All the disputes ended, however, with the appearance of the Evil God.</p>

  <p>For a time, Luo Zheng was grateful to him. His inner world had somehow returned to order after the Evil God came to be. No war was breaking out among the empires, and neither resentment nor loathing brewed between the races.</p>

  <p>At the time, Luo Zheng thought it was the Evil God's contribution until the Green Jade Spirit told him otherwise.</p>

  <p>In the end, he got the truth.</p>

  <p>The Evil God was a fusion of all evil thoughts and resentment? his appearance was a tribulation of the world, not a coincidence.</p>

  <p>Such a tribulation was rarely seen? it could only appear in the primitive land. Coincidentally, Luo Zheng's inner world was a small primitive land. After all the resentment and evil thoughts were gathered to form the Evil God, the living beings within the inner world existed in harmony.</p>

  <p>With her jaw slack, Edna looked at the Creator in disbelief. Never did she expect her husband to have such a background.</p>

  <p>But the Evil God didn't seem to care. "So what?"</p>

  <p>"If I kill you, the inner world will fall back into turmoil. It won't do me any good. But if I let you go, you'll definitely get me into trouble," Luo Zheng said, smiling and touching Edna gently. The black dragon-pattern blade was then pulled out from Edna's body. As soon as the blood on her white dress returned to the wound, it began healing rapidly.</p>

  <p>In truth, Luo Zheng probably couldn't kill the Evil God.</p>

  <p>So long as there were creatures in the inner world, disputes, resentment, hatred, and conflicts would continue to exist.</p>

  <p>The Evil God was born along with his inner world. Even if Luo Zheng destroyed him, when the next world tribulation arrived, negativity would gather once again, and the Evil God would be reborn.</p>

  <p>Perhaps, he wouldn't have the memories of his current life. He might even take on a completely different form, but he would still be the Evil God.</p>

  <p>"Are you telling me you can spare my husband's life?" With a glimmer of hope, Edna's eyes lit up.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded before he said, "Remove the barrier of your Rebirth Land and merge it into my world. I can let him off."</p>

  <p>The Evil God threw Luo Zheng a silent glance before laughing. "Even if I don't remove the barrier of Rebirth Land, you still have a way, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"It's not difficult to find a way from you," Luo Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>The Evil God merely sighed. "Let's go..."</p>

  <p>The Evil God's Rebirth Land had always existed within Luo Zheng's inner world, but Luo Zheng had never entered it.</p>

  <p>Later on, the people of the Black Ship had separated the Rebirth Land from Luo Zheng's inner world. Luo Zheng couldn't interfere even if he wanted to.</p>

  <p>As a sudden image flashed in Luo Zheng's mind, he, the Green Jade Spirit, No. 9527, the Evil God, and Edna had appeared in the sky. Nearby there was a space surrounded by cloud and mist, which was the Evil God's Rebirth Land.</p>

  <p>When everyone came to the edge of the mist, the Evil God gently flipped his space ring, pulling out a black token.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>Stretching out his hand, he squeezed the token until it was crushed into pieces.</p>

  <p>After the token broke, the cloud and mist began to dissipate.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng could feel something change? his inner world was once again connected to the Rebirth Land.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>With a wave of his hand, Luo Zheng, the Evil God, and the others disappeared with him once again before appearing in the Rebirth Land in the next moment.</p>

  <p>Over the past few years, the Evil God had managed the Rebirth Land well in Luo Zheng's absence.</p>

  <p>While the space in the Rebirth Land was smaller than Luo Zheng's inner world, the Evil God had made full use of it. The land was vast with nearly no sea at all.</p>

  <p>Many dark mountains were scattered everywhere and at the foot of each was a small country.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng looked down, a strange look came over his face.</p>

  <p>Many of the countries below were engaged in fierce wars? corpses decorated the ground. Even from a hundred thousand feet up in the air, one could smell the strong scent of blood.</p>

  <p>"How can the creatures in your Rebirth Land kill so fiercely?" Luo Zheng asked, frowning.</p>

  <p>The Evil God merely snorted and said, "Only by constantly fighting can the strong be born."</p>

  <p>All Luo Zheng could do was to shake his head helplessly. After a while, his gaze then fell on a high mountain in the corner of the world. Rays of white arc light flashed constantly in the area. The white arc light was the internal momentum of the Divine Dao previously used by the Evil God.</p>

  <p>When the Green Jade Spirit noticed the arc light, his eyes flashed. Then, everyone flew toward the mountain.</p>

  <p>"Crack..."</p>

  <p>Atop the mountain stood a great tree that had been burnt black. A white gem was embedded on the ground at its foot, being the source of the rays of arc light.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, this is the second flaw!" the Green Jade Spirit pointed out excitedly.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Zheng had merged with the Blood Essence Divine Dao, there were only two flaws left in the Ways-blending Energy.</p>

  <p>But the Green Jade Civilization had spent too much time finding the last two flaws to no avail. Fortunately, the Green Jade Spirit, at least, managed to find a clue about one of the flaws through the Sanskrit word of the Blood Essence Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>He had always believed that Luo Zheng was destined to encounter the Green Jade Civilization, but even he was surprised to find out that the creature Luo Zheng released from his inner world had found the second flaw.</p>

  <p>Perhaps Luo Zheng truly was the one who could complete the Ways-blending Energy.</p>

  <p>Even if he couldn't do it right away, he still had the greatest chance.</p>

  <p>"How did you even find this gem?" Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>After completely unlocking the Rebirth Land, Luo Zheng could spy on the Evil God's memory, but he chose not to do that.</p>

  <p>"On Stage Two of the Other Shore," answered the latter.</p>

  <p>"Stage Two..." That was rather surprising.</p>

  <p>Generally, the members and disciples of the super forces didn't stay long on the first three stages.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng and Dorothy had just set foot on the Other Shore, Dorothy was willing to explore the Sacred Mallow Temple with Luo Zheng because he held the secret key. In fact, she had even intended to take him directly to Stage Four at the time.</p>

  <p>If they reached Stage Four, they'd be able to gain the support of their own race, after all. It was much more rewarding than exploring the Other Shore on their own.</p>

  <p>Normally the first three stages were desolate. Only someone who didn't belong to any sect, like the Evil God, ever wandered aimlessly in these parts.</p>
