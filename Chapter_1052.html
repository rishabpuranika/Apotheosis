<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had no idea what was going on in Dillon's mind.</p>

  <p>As he heard Dillon stammering, Luo Luo Zheng knew that he was probably taken aback by Miguel's group.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng tried to reassure him by saying, "Master Shi, I would like to introduce you my friends. We have been fighting side by side for the past two years."</p>

  <p>"Friends..."</p>

  <p>Dillon felt happy hearing that Luo Luo Zheng had made new friends while he was away. He actually felt overjoyed and his worries vanished quickly. With such a group of mighty warriors around, he didn't have to be afraid of the York Divine Kingdom anymore.</p>

  <p>Now he was dying to know where Luo Luo Zheng had been in the past two years to have made such a group of friends.</p>

  <p>And why these mighty warriors would be willing to make friends with a guy who had a much lower cultivation level?</p>

  <p>Hobbes had always been impatient. He wanted to talk to Luo Luo Zheng right away and have him tell him the whole story. But there were over a hundred strong warriors before him, so he remained quiet hoping he would have the opportunity to do so later on.</p>

  <p>As for Haber, he was the quiet one. His expression didn't change much when he saw these mighty warriors. But actually, he was just as shocked to see Miguel's group as anyone else.</p>

  <p>"Friends? Great!" Dillon was stunned for a moment and then, with a smile from ear to ear, he said, "If you are Luo Zheng's friends, you are our friends too.</p>

  <p>Welcome to the World Commercial Alliance. We'd like you to join us for dinner. You will be our honored guests. Please come in."</p>

  <p>Dillon didn't dare to snub Miguel and his warriors.</p>

  <p>However, as he spoke, Miguel and the others didn't react. They didn't even nod or show a polite smile.</p>

  <p>Dillon might be famous in the Central Region as one of the three leaders of the World Commercial Alliance, and was a man of great influence. But in Miguel's eyes, he was a minor character without importance.</p>

  <p>The warriors from the Sea God Continent only respected Luo Luo Zheng and Xun and would not bow to anyone else.</p>

  <p>Dillon was getting more and more embarrassed. He scratched the back of his head and turned to look at Luo Luo Zheng for help.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Dillon was starting to feel embarrassed, Luo Luo Zheng smiled and said,</p>

  <p>"Miguel, you must be tired from your journey. You came a long way from your home. I would like to invite you to a gathering in the city."</p>

  <p>Only then did Miguel nod. He and his group followed Luo Luo Zheng and flew towards Oracle City.</p>

  <p>The grand hall of the Oracle City had been beautifully decorated for the occasion. Over a hundred wide tables were arranged in a single line.</p>

  <p>Beautiful female servants were shuffling through them, and exquisite dishes were being served.</p>

  <p>The World Commercial Alliance put on its utmost dedication to please these mighty warriors. No one had ever seen such grandeur in the history of the World Commercial Alliance.</p>

  <p>The chefs had prepared all kinds of exquisite dishes that were being served one after the other.</p>

  <p>Most of the ingredients were rarities that could only be found at the World Commercial Alliance's warehouse. The meat dishes were sumptuous and delicious, whose raw materials came from level seven or level eight beasts.</p>

  <p>Oracle City was a busy hub in the Central Region where all the people with great talent would go, including the chefs preparing the dinner. Their dishes were naturally of the highest quality.</p>

  <p>Dillon and the other warriors in the Central Region thought that these warriors from the Sea God Continent would act rather indifferent, but they were wrong.</p>

  <p>The warriors from the Sea God Continent could be great at fighting, but they had no manners at the table. They gulped down the food without chewing or savoring it.</p>

  <p>Dillon didn't care about how much they were spending in pleasing them.</p>

  <p>The wealth of the World Commercial Alliance far exceeded that of any sect.</p>

  <p>But he never thought that these warriors at the Life and Death Realm and Soul Sea Realm would behave in such manner. Their backs slumped on the table, and with their heads nearly touching their plates, they devoured every dish in just a few seconds.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, however, knew exactly why they behaved like this.</p>

  <p>Miguel looked down on the cultivation level of the warriors in the Central Region. It was difficult for a warrior to reach the Life and Death Realm in the Central Region, let alone the Soul Sea Realm. Even Eddie, at the Life and Death Realm, had been considered as the number one warrior in the Central Region. But things were different on the Sea God Continent.</p>

  <p>Warriors at the Life and Death Realm were considered war sages. There were simply a lot of war sages on the Sea God Continent.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the entire Sea God Continent had always been in chaos.</p>

  <p>Conflicts were common all across the continent as all the races would fight for the control of the Tower of Sin. Every race needed to fight for survival.</p>

  <p>In all the sacred places on the continent, there was the need for strong warriors. The most important thing for them was to develop their cultivation methods and train warriors that would fight. No one cared about eating good food or drinking good wine. For them, as long as there was food on the table, everything was fine. Even if it tasted bad, they would eat in order to survive.</p>

  <p>In reality, the Sea God Continent possessed many powerful warriors and they were good at battling, but in other areas such as literature, music, arts, and so on, they were poor. Their people had no interest or time to waste in such mundane things, unlike the Central Region. The priority of the warriors on the Sea God Continent was to grow stronger and survive.</p>

  <p>Warriors in the Central Region, however, could focus on their cultivation methods as well as develop their artistic side. After the human race occupied the Central Region, they were not in any danger of surviving.</p>

  <p>There were only disputes among humans, but even these were minor and still gave them time and energy to develop a rich and colorful culture.</p>

  <p>As the night went on, the warriors from the Sea God Continent relaxed and started to enjoy the party. Everyone felt overjoyed and the atmosphere became lively. Miguel was even chatting and laughing with Dillon, asking him about the current affairs of the human race in the Central Region.</p>

  <p>Dillon had a glib tongue, so the two of them had a pleasant chat.</p>

  <p>After all dishes had been served, hundreds of beautiful women wearing long gowns entered the hall. They danced gracefully to the sounds of upbeat instrumental music.</p>

  <p>That night, all the warriors of the World Commercial Alliance exhausted their energy trying to entertain this group of warriors.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was seated at the head of the host's table with a beaming smile on his face. He was enjoying the party but there was something worrying him.</p>

  <p>He was concerned about Ning Yudie. He knew she was being taken care of by the servant girls, but he couldn't help but picture her lying quietly in bed, unable to move.</p>

  <p>After dealing with the warriors of the York Divine Kingdom, Luo Luo Zheng had to personally go to the four divine kingdoms and investigate the origins of the ancient jade. Before doing so, Luo Luo Zheng had to ask Miguel and the others to see if they could treat Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>The party lasted the whole night.</p>

  <p>For warriors like them, even if they didn't sleep for months, their spirits would still be full.</p>

  <p>In the Heavenly Stellar Palace, when Miguel felt Yudie's pulse, he shook his head and said worriedly, "She is not seriously ill, but her life energy is very weak. If you want to save her, you must find something to replenish her life energy."</p>

  <p>"Is there such a thing on the Sea God Continent?" Luo Luo Zheng asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>Miguel shook his head again. "I haven't seen anything like that on the continent and I don't know for sure if something like that exists in the Dark Nether Cave. I will send someone to look for it. If we find it, I'll have people send it to you."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled forcefully. He was grateful for Miguel's efforts, but he was not sure if anyone would be able to find it or if it existed in the Dark Nether Cave. They had no time to waste.</p>

  <p>A person's life energy was constantly being consumed. Although he used Hanson's ancient jades to replenish Yudie's life energy, that wouldn't last forever. They needed to find more ancient jades and do so quickly.</p>

  <p>Right now Luo Luo Zheng had to go to the four divine kingdoms to search for clues regarding that ancient jade.</p>

  <p>After the warriors from the Sea God Continent had settled down in Oracle City, Luo Luo Zheng was filled with anxiety, hoping that Master Wallace of the York Divine Kingdom would come to the Central Region soon.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng would be able to go on investigating the ancient jade once this problem had been solved.</p>

  <p>He had waited for almost a month now, but nobody came. He was very anxious and regretted breaking the Eight-diagram Mirror. He could have used it to provoke Master Wallace, urging him to quickly pass through the Chaotic Ocean of Stars.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng waited anxiously, Miguel and the others were enjoying their time in Oracle City.</p>

  <p>The Central Region might not be the best place for cultivation, but it was a very special place to enjoy life. For the first time in their lives, they didn't need to worry about surviving and could appreciate a leisurely life, experimenting the delicacies and customs of the Central Region.</p>

  <p>As for the warriors of the Demon Night, they weren't in a hurry either. They were accompanying their queen and that was their greatest honor as they were afraid that she would drive them away.</p>

  <p>Miguel and a hundred mighty warriors had stayed in the Central Region for 33 days now.</p>

  <p>Six beams of light were seen swiftly advancing in the sky above the Chaotic Ocean of Stars.</p>

  <p>Passing through the Chaotic Ocean of Stars was not an easy task. Even though the Star Storm had stopped, there were still berserk beasts on the way to face.</p>

  <p>Some of the beasts were level ten, while others were even level eleven.</p>

  <p>Their strength was comparable to warriors at the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>Even a mighty warrior at the Soul Sea Realm like Master Wallace had to be careful and avoid provoking those fierce beasts.</p>
