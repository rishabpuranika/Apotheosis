  <p>
</p>

  <p>A snake-like streak of lightning suddenly extended and twisted from the bright blue windstorm. It rushed towards them, but even Kenneth's heavy life vitality shield couldn't resist it.</p>

  <p>Kenneth was undoubtedly powerful, but even he was afraid of the space windstorm.</p>

  <p>Patrick and Tianming would probably be burned to ashes if they ever came close to it.</p>

  <p>Thus, even Kenneth was shocked for a second. He wondered why this space windstorm had penetrated his life vitality shield without any difficulty at all.</p>

  <p>He was dumbfounded, while Tianming and Patrick were white as a sheet with fright.</p>

  <p>They were the top geniuses of Cloud Sect and had more than enough experience. They had lived in all kinds of crises and even survived challenges on the edge of life and death.</p>

  <p>However, they didn't want to die with any grievances. It was just unfortunate that they were blocked by the space windstorm when they passed the transmission array.</p>

  <p>The three of them stared blankly at the space windstorm that shot into Zheng's eyes. Would it make his head explode?</p>

  <p>After a while, something strange happened. After the space windstorm shot into Zheng's orbs, he didn't react at all, but a blue light shone in his bright eyes.</p>

  <p>"What's going on?"</p>

  <p>"Zheng, are you okay?"</p>

  <p>Tianming and Patrick rushed to Zheng to see if he was fine, but they were still afraid that their voices would alert the dense space windstorm of their presence.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng's eyes were blank. He had heard Tianming's and Patrick's calls, but he only reacted after a while.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what happened…I just stared at this space windstorm, and that's it," he said hesitantly.</p>

  <p>He randomly stared at it for no reason, but was that it?</p>

  <p>Patrick and Tianming didn't believe him at all.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng indeed didn't do anything. He was just curious about the space windstorm and wanted to check if it had hidden secrets.</p>

  <p>But, he was abruptly lost in a trance. It felt like he had understood everything in life. It was like when one suddenly found out the solution and completely understood the obscure arithmetic rules, and then solved the complicated subject in one go.</p>

  <p>There was a pause before Zheng spoke.</p>

  <p>"It seems that I…have understood a little about the space windstorm. I found the rules for their arrangement, but I can't see clearly…" Zheng continued to speak with uncertainty and a blank look in his eyes, but he realized that some things had changed.</p>

  <p>The space windstorm was originally a mess made from countless blue space lines, like a streak of lightning. However, Zheng had now seen that the space lines were in fact, arranged according to certain rules, even if they looked messy.</p>

  <p>Yet Zheng only found a few arrangement rules, which might be just one out of a million or even ten million rules!</p>

  <p>When Kenneth, who had concentrated on stabilizing his life vitality shield, heard what Zheng said, he immediately trembled. Even though he was occupied, he managed to turn his head around and looked at Zheng. He was always calm and steady, but his eyes looked doubtful.</p>

  <p>"What? Zheng, did you say you found the arrangement rules of this space windstorm?" Kenneth asked.</p>

  <p>He couldn't control his shock and his voice shook as he spoke.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded in agreement, but then shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Just a little bit. I can't understand most of it, but I can see a few!"</p>

  <p>A little bit…</p>

  <p>The windstorm that brewed in Kenneth's heart was probably even stronger than the space windstorm outside.</p>

  <p>These things were space rules, and this guy saw through them in a single glance?</p>

  <p>Although it was a bit impressive, it made him too strange.</p>

  <p>The space rule came down from the rule of the world's origin.</p>

  <p>The rule of space and time was everywhere. Every day, when people woke up, time passed, and when they left the bed to walk on the floor, space changed.</p>

  <p>Space and time always accompanied human life.</p>

  <p>However, space was stable at this time, and people felt its existence. But as for the space rule… It was impossible to comprehend it. Anyone could look at a mountain and see its beauty, but nobody could look at the sky and master the artistic conception of space.</p>

  <p>Still, it was different on the transmission array because it had broken the space and built a space passage connected to another transmission array.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the space was made from the energy of the supreme life vitality crystals by force, so the space in it was a bit unstable.</p>

  <p>The unstable space easily showed its weakness. In fact, the space windstorm was made from the weakness and the excess energy produced after the space was broken.</p>

  <p>Such a space windstorm in the short-distance transmission array couldn't be called as a real space windstorm. It was said that a space windstorm in a long-distance transmission array was terrifying, and even Kenneth would instantly turn into dust if he ever faced one.</p>

  <p>Then again, since the space windstorm was the space's weakness, someone might see it through, and maybe even master some space rules.</p>

  <p>It might be...</p>

  <p>It was possible, but it was extremely hard to find little bits of rules from the messy space windstorm. Kenneth found out with his insight that there was no one who had made it.</p>

  <p>But now, it seemed that Zheng had made it? Kenneth doubted what Zheng had said, but there was actually some space windstorm that broke through his life vitality shield and entered Zheng's eyes a while ago.</p>

  <p>His life vitality shield was heavy and thick, without any loophole.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, the little space windstorm might have hanged Patrick and Tianming.</p>

  <p>Thus, Kenneth assumed that the bright blue light was not the space windstorm, but… a few space rules.</p>

  <p>Apparently, Zheng could even master some space rules when he passed an old transmission array. Kenneth was speechless.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Tianming and Patrick didn't clearly see the hidden meaning, nor were they as shocked as Kenneth. They even wondered why Kenneth reacted so strangely.</p>

  <p>It would be weird if Kenneth wasn't surprised.</p>

  <p>He thought of one thing, a task that was once released in Cloud Hall. It was so difficult that he couldn't finish it. If he had twice his current strength, he might have a 20 percent chance of finishing it and probably 80 percent chance of dying.</p>

  <p>If anyone completed such a dangerous and difficult task, he could be rewarded to cultivate in the Sumeru Space of the Cloud Hall for ten days.</p>

  <p>The Sumeru Space was kind of an independent space opened by the Cloud Hall. It was different from the independent space ring, and living people could enter the special Sumeru Space.</p>

  <p>Inside this particular space was a broken stone inscription where some space rules were hidden.</p>

  <p>The reward of this tough task was to cultivate in front of the stone for only ten days. However, the price was too high.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the space rules hidden in the stone inscription were too few. It was quite hard to master the space rules depending on the stone inscription. Only two or three out of one thousand people who had entered the Sumeru Space had mastered the few space rules.</p>

  <p>Those one thousand people were strong enough to have completed such a difficult task, so they qualified to enter the Sumeru Space.</p>

  <p>They were much, much more powerful than Kenneth. Each of them were so perfectly talented.</p>

  <p>It could be said that the space rule was quite precious. It would be a great help for Kenneth if he could comprehend some space rules. So many cultivators more powerful than him scrambled for it.</p>

  <p>However, today, he took Zheng to the transmission array for the first time, and Zheng understood it.</p>

  <p>It was no surprise that Kenneth was really jealous of Zheng for a second.</p>

  <p>He didn't know if he was jealous of Zheng's luck or talent.</p>

  <p>Zheng was at only grade 3 of the nature level, but he had the sword spirit avatar and comprehended some space rules. Kenneth wondered what he did when his cultivation was of the same grade. It was safe to say that this man was abnormal and his extraordinary skills would make anybody jealous.</p>

  <p>"Sir, Zheng said that he had seen some rules. What are they?" Tianming asked.</p>

  <p>He was curious when he saw the astonished look in Kenneth's eyes.</p>

  <p>"Ehem," Kenneth simply coughed and decided not to explain to them.</p>

  <p>The trial on the Cloud Road was about to start. If he mentioned the space rule, it would just frustrate Tianming and Patrick and impact their performances. It was better not to say anything...</p>

  <p>Just then, it got increasingly brighter in the front. Kenneth seized the chance to change the topic and announced, "Get ready. We're arriving!"</p>
