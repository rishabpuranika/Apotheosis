</p>

  <p>"A tower?"</p>

  <p>Dorothea asked with a skeptical expression on her face. There were three towers used for training in her Celestial Position race.</p>

  <p>In order to gain recognition of the Celestial Position, a warrior normally had to pass the Talent Tablet test in one of the three towers.</p>

  <p>However, one of the three towers had been lost, not to be found again.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng suddenly mentioned a tower, Dorothea was convinced a little.</p>

  <p>"What's the name of the tower?" she asked with a frown.</p>

  <p>"Tower of Sin," Luo Luo Zheng continued, his eyes fixed on the Ancestral Dragon egg, yearning for it. More and more cracks were appearing on its surface.</p>

  <p>On the upper half of the dragon's egg, the cracks spread out like spider webs.</p>

  <p>"Tower of Sin... that's not right!" Dorothea shook her head. "It's not what the lost tower is called."</p>

  <p>Hearing her words, Luo Luo Zheng smiled. He knew very well that he wasn't lying, so he was confident that he could use this subject to engage her attention.</p>

  <p>"The Tower of Sin has fifteen floors. I took the Talent Tablet test on the tenth. I still remember the names on the first row of the Talent Tablet... such as Abigail Yun, Odom Gu, Cliff, Fire, and so forth."</p>

  <p>'Odom Gu!'</p>

  <p>Dorothea was surprised to hear Luo Luo Zheng utter the name, her smiling face immediately turning grave. "That was the Tower of Crystal. I believe you have been there."</p>

  <p>"Tower of Crystal..."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng remembered that. "Tower of Sin" was the name given to it by the creatures of the Sea God Continent, but since it was the Celestial Position's tower for training, it was naturally not called the same here. It seemed that it had originally been called the Tower of Crystal.</p>

  <p>The reason why Dorothea was so excited was that she heard a very familiar name escape Luo Zheng's mouth: Odom Gu.</p>

  <p>Her full name was Dorothea Gu. Odom Gu was her father.</p>

  <p>"Where is the Tower of Crystal?" Dorothea Gu asked him.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng heard this, his heart skipped a beat. He seemed to have revealed something that he shouldn't have revealed just to stall for time.</p>

  <p>Tower of Sin was very important to the Sea God Continent. It was the same with the Purple Heart Sacred Place of humans. Although the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place had already developed, the Purple Heart Sacred Place was still relatively weak. If they found out the whereabouts of the Tower of Sin and took it away, it would be impossible for the human race to become stronger than the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place in such a short amount of time. Perhaps that was good news for the ogres.</p>

  <p>Seeing the hesitation on Luo Zheng's face, Dorothea Gu sneered, "This great world's ascension passage has been sealed. The tower of Crystal must be here. It won't be too difficult to find it. If you're so unwilling to answer me, I will not force you, but... You said you received the recognition of the Celestial Position. What row is your talent in? I hope it's not the fourth or the fifth."</p>

  <p>Although the three towers of the Celestial Position had been differently named, their shapes and details were about the same. In fact, the three towers were not only used for trials, but also as weapons of suppression.</p>

  <p>Dorothea Gu had great talent. In the Tower of Illusory, her talent had been ranked in the first row.</p>

  <p>As far as she knew, only the warriors whose talents were in the first two rows in the Talent Tablet test had the potential to be recognized by the Celestial Position.</p>

  <p>As for the martial artists whose talents were below the second row, their names were also recorded on the tablet, but since there were other countless warriors like them in the Upper World, they were not deemed worthy.</p>

  <p>Dorothea Gu's instinct was to disregard Luo Luo Zheng, a young boy who stole a Spirit Supreme Realm warrior's body. How could he be as strong?</p>

  <p>Hearing her question, Luo Luo Zheng smiled faintly. "I don't belong to any rows."</p>

  <p>"Oh..." Her expression dimmed. "A young man whose name is not even listed on the tablet, and who claims that he belongs to the Celestial Position Race. You must be delusional."</p>

  <p>Previously, Dorothea Gu had thought that Luo Zheng's name was in the second row. If that was the case, she could indeed see Luo Luo Zheng as a member of the same race. The Celestial Position warriors were not in great numbers, but they were all elites.</p>

  <p>Amber from Heavenly Feather Sacred Place was a great instance of it.</p>

  <p>After her name was listed in the second row of the tablet, it only took her two hundred years to become the leader of the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place. She even led them in the war against the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>However, ever since the ascension passage was sealed, Amber was unable to break through the Soul Sea Realm. Her lifelong achievements had come to a halt. If the great world's ascension passage was intact, then she would have been able to cultivate to a higher realm and progress even among the many members of the Demon Night in the Upper World.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, however, couldn't even manage to get his name on the tablet. In Dorothea Gu's opinion, he wouldn't make a great talent in any race. The Celestial Position was out of the question. How naive was he to think that he had the recognition of the Celestial Position just because he had been to the Talent Tablet?</p>

  <p>Suddenly, another crack appeared in the middle of the Ancestral Dragon egg. Luo Luo Zheng raised his eyebrows, continuing, "You think I'm delusional? My name is not there in the six rows, but it has been recorded."</p>

  <p>"Recorded? Where?" Dorothea was confused at his reply.</p>

  <p>"Above the names of those such as Odom Gu and Cliff," he said softly.</p>

  <p>"What!" Dorothea Gu spluttered, seemingly losing her composure.</p>

  <p>She took a deep breath. "So you say. What is your title then?" she asked somewhat nervously. "Asura? Rakshasa? Innate? Eight? Which one? Is the name in gold or silver?"</p>

  <p>"Th-there are so many titles?" Luo Luo Zheng was instantly taken aback by Dorothea's words.</p>

  <p>He was aware that the ones who ranked above the first row naturally surpassed the other warriors. However, since his name was the only one there, he didn't know that so many titles existed.</p>

  <p>In truth, a great deal of emphasis was placed on the titles on the Talent Tablet. Moreover, each of them was of a different level. For instance, Asura and the Rakshasa were the two highest titles. Then, there were titles such as Innate, Eight and so on.</p>

  <p>In fact, anyone who could obtain any of these titles was considered to be among the strongest warriors in the universe. The difference between the titles was quite small. But however small, it still made a difference.</p>

  <p>The titles were also classified into gold, silver, and bronze, where gold was the highest and bronze the lowest.</p>

  <p>"You say that you've obtained a title. So tell me, what title did you obtain?" asked Dorothea, staring at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng looked puzzled, "It's none of those that you've mentioned."</p>

  <p>Dorothea Gu frowned. "Is it Young Heart? Or Sea Arriving?" Those two titles were ranked at the very end. However, even so, they were impressive enough. Although Dorothea Gu had been listed in the first row, she hadn't gotten any of those titles.</p>

  <p>"Neither," Luo Luo Zheng said. "If I remember correctly, it was the gold 'Celestial Position.'"</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng said this, the flower in Dorothea Gu's right eye started to whirl. The root of the flower was buried deep in her eye. Seeing the flower spin like this, Luo Luo Zheng wondered if she was in pain.</p>

  <p>What he didn't know was that his words had set off a storm in her heart.</p>

  <p>"How...how is this possible? Celestial Position! Gold Celestial Position!"</p>

  <p>Dorothea Gu found his words incredible.</p>

  <p>As per Luo Luo Zheng, he had been to the Tower of Crystal and indeed taken the Talent Tablet test. If he hadn't seen the words "Celestial Position" inscribed on the tablet, he wouldn't have known that such a title even existed.</p>

  <p>Dorothea Gu knew that for a fact, which was why she found his claim so hard to believe.</p>
