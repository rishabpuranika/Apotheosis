  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Three times?!"</p>

  <p>The crowd couldn't help but exclaim and ask repeatedly if what they heard was correct.</p>

  <p>All of the Eternal Realm warriors that were present had already lived for countless years.</p>

  <p>In those years, they had already used their bloodlines to the fullest, especially the human heroes.</p>

  <p>And in the current civilization, the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, King Ieuan, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Ying, and the Eternal Realm Hunters were in the same situation.</p>

  <p>It actually meant that there was almost no room for further development anymore.</p>

  <p>That was why it was very hard for them to imagine that a Blood-controlling Method could easily increase their blood power by three times.</p>

  <p>After being extremely surprised, expressions of joy instantly filled everyone's faces.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, can you really confirm that?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi asked in disbelief. "Yes. It should be true," Luo Zheng answered confidently.</p>

  <p>"Everyone's bloodline comes from the Four Spirits Sect. Generally, only after one joins the Four Spirits Sect can he or she be taught with the Blood-controlling Method. However, this time, it is sort of a special exception," he continued.</p>

  <p>Currently, the Monkey Spirit King did not have much confidence to deal with the ferocious Snake Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>And although the strength of these human beings was much inferior compared to the Monkey Masters, they became worthy of being favored by the Monkey Spirit Sect. Moreover, Luo Zheng possessed the precious ancestry-level bloodline, meaning that his potential was limitless.</p>

  <p>"I can't believe that there are such methods in this world!"</p>

  <p>"It seems that there is still so much that we don't know."</p>

  <p>"Well, the Blood-controlling Methods are from the main world outside the chaos. We should just be grateful that we can get a hold of this knowledge."</p>

  <p>Everyone talked about it. Even the usually calm ones couldn't help but join the joyous conversations.</p>

  <p>There was a huge cave inside the Heavenly Square City.</p>

  <p>The cave extended from the left side of the Heavenly Square City to the right side. Then it winded its way west.</p>

  <p>It almost extended to every corners of the Heavenly Square City.</p>

  <p>However, none of the rooms of different sizes inside the city was connected to it.</p>

  <p>Cornelius, the Snake Spirit King, dwelled and was hidden in this cave.</p>

  <p>Beneath the Heavenly Square City, his body spread along the cave and to all the corners of the city.</p>

  <p>From the outside, it would look like an ordinary city, but its true face was a lair of Cornelius.</p>

  <p>Sewell entered from the top of the Heavenly Square City and climbed down to the center of the huge cave.</p>

  <p>This was where Cornelius's head was located.</p>

  <p>His head was covered with dark red scales, and each of these scales had unique patterns with red-blood light flowing within them. From these scales, a devastating aura was being constantly emitted.</p>

  <p>On the head of the Snake Spirit King was a peculiar pair of cockscombs.</p>

  <p>Currently, his huge dreadful eyes were closed.</p>

  <p>As Sewell arrived in front of Cornelius, he slightly bit his lip before approaching.</p>

  <p>"My king..." Sewell whispered as he knelt in front of the Snake Spirit King.</p>

  <p>Soon after, Cornelius slowly opened his eyes.</p>

  <p>Two crescent-shaped figures appeared in his pair of huge snake eyes.</p>

  <p>"So, you failed?" Cornelius asked straightforwardly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'm sorry," Sewell replied in a soft voice.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't really matter. We still have a chance," Cornelius said in an indifferent tone.</p>

  <p>"But..." Sewell reluctantly continued. "The Monkey Spirit King has awakened."</p>

  <p>Before escaping from the Ghost Mountain, he had already sent some spies to keep watch in the area. Through them, although he wasn't able to detect every movement in the Ghost Mountain, he still had a general grasp of what was happening on the Night View Island.</p>

  <p>Until now, Sewell was still confused.</p>

  <p>If the Thirteen Teeth Necklace couldn't wake the Monkey Spirit King before, then why were they able to succeed this time using the same item?</p>

  <p>He couldn't think of what mistake he had committed allowing this failure to happen.</p>

  <p>After Cornelius heard Sewell's news, his eyes slightly dilated.</p>

  <p>He seemed to be also surprised at that.</p>

  <p>But soon after, his eyes returned to their normal state. "That monkey is only invincible in the main world. Right here, I can even kill him twice.</p>

  <p>Don't be too depressed about it."</p>

  <p>Cornelius was famous for being cruel, but when it came to his subordinates, he was actually quite lenient.</p>

  <p>With this kind of attitude from the Snake Spirit King, Sewell felt more ashamed of his failure.</p>

  <p>"However, we need to kill the monkey spirits in the Heavenly Square City and remove their coordinates. Do this discreetly," Cornelius strictly instructed.</p>

  <p>In the Heavenly Square City, there were also monkey spirits and human spirits aside from the snake spirits.</p>

  <p>After their leaders had fallen, these monkey spirits and human spirits started treating the Heavenly Square City as the Four Spirits Sect.</p>

  <p>Although they were still on guard against the Snake Spirit King, they had no choice but to stay here and work for the Snake Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>Originally, Cornelius planned to control the Monkey Spirit King. Once their king was already at his disposal, then it meant that he could also control the monkey spirits.</p>

  <p>But now that the Monkey Spirit King had completely awakened, these monkey spirits immediately became hidden dangers that were necessary to be eliminated. They had to do it quickly before the monkey spirits could plot something against the Snake Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>"Consider it done!"</p>

  <p>With that, Sewell immediately withdrew from the cave and planned on how he would execute the task given to him.</p>

  <p>An hour later, all of the monkey spirits in the city were gathered.</p>

  <p>"Master Sewell, what's the matter? We were told that something urgent came up," the leader of the monkey spirits asked.</p>

  <p>He was Alston, one of the previously most powerful warriors in the Monkey Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>"That's right. Your coordinates have been moved to the Supreme Pure Realm," Sewell announced.</p>

  <p>"The Supreme Pure Realm? Why?" Alston asked in confusion. Even the other monkey spirits started murmuring with each other.</p>

  <p>"We actually found some clues about the Monkey Spirit King," Sewell replied.</p>

  <p>The monkey spirits glanced at each other. There were mixed emotions as they heard Sewell's news.</p>

  <p>"He is in the Supreme Pure Realm?"</p>

  <p>"Did he wake up already?"</p>

  <p>The monkey spirits simultaneously asked a lot of questions, expressing concern for their king.</p>

  <p>"No. He's actually trapped on the Night View Island and is being guarded by the bird spirits," Sewell replied. "He needs your help, but the entrance to the Night View Island is sealed. I can help you enter the island, but you can only revive through the coordinates."</p>

  <p>"I'll do it!"</p>

  <p>"Me too! We're going to invade the island!"</p>

  <p>"Hurry up! Kill us now!"</p>

  <p>Looking at the monkey spirits' determined and impatient faces, Sewell almost couldn't suppress his laughter. 'Such a group of idiots! They're actually begging us to kill them?'</p>

  <p>However, he didn't reveal any emotion so as not to get caught. Then, he said, "Everyone, please wait a moment. After we fetch and activate the Light of Annihilation, we will kill you. We have already arranged a large number of snake spirits that will guide you to the entrance of the Night View Island. When you come back to life, we will cooperate together.</p>

  <p>Those birds would surely not stand a chance."</p>

  <p>With a flick of Sewell's tail, hundreds of snake spirits swarmed over.</p>

  <p>Sharp white bones were inserted into their heads, inlaid with the Holy Stones.</p>

  <p>As long as the white bones were stabbed into the bodies of the monkey spirits, the Light of Annihilation would immediately kill those Treacherous Beings.</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute, Master Sewell. May I just ask why are we not informed about the matter of moving our coordinates?" Alston asked.</p>

  <p>The monkey spirits had the strong intuition.</p>

  <p>Although Sewell explained everything clearly, and he didn't show any expression that could harbor doubts, Alston was still quite hesitant. He just felt that something was amiss, and this situation was so rushed.</p>

  <p>"I lurked into the Night View Island and was ultimately repelled by the Divine Hummingbirds, so I had no choice but to arrange your coordinates there in a hurry," Sewell replied.</p>

  <p>Alston's suspicion grew continuously. "But how come there are so many snake spirits here just to kill us? Are you afraid that we will resist?"</p>

  <p>As soon as Alston said this, the other monkey spirits had also become alert. They started to realize that there was something strange going on.</p>

  <p>They were willing to defy all difficulties and danger for the Monkey Spirit King, and they were also ready to be killed just so they could enter the Night View Island.</p>

  <p>It was quite abnormal for Sewell to arrange so many snake spirits that carried the Holy Stones.</p>

  <p>"Come on. You're just thinking too much," Sewell said with a smile and still played it cool.</p>

  <p>"Then how about we go to the Night View Island by ourselves? No matter how troublesome those birds are, I don't think we, the monkey spirits, would be defeated by them," Alston insisted.</p>

  <p>Sewell's lips started to twitch as he became annoyed with the monkey spirits' stubbornness. "You don't need to do that..." He finally forced a smile as he lost his patience. "I've decided. All of you shall die here, right now!"</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, he wagged his tail and immediately ordered the snake spirits to attack them.</p>

  <p>Without the Holy Stones, the monkey spirits were unable to kill the snake spirits even with their monstrous strength. Even if they tore the bodies of the snake spirits into pieces, they would just recover immediately.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, once the monkey spirits were stabbed by the white bones infused with the Light of Annihilation, they would instantly die.</p>

  <p>It turned out to be a cruel massacre.</p>

  <p>The battle was fierce at first but the monkey spirits' resistance was futile.</p>

  <p>The monkey spirits were able to battle it out against the snake spirits for an hour before they were all finally eliminated.</p>

  <p>"Go and erase their coordinates," Sewell said coldly after watching all of the monkey spirits dissipate after the vicious battle. "You brought this to yourselves. I was actually merciful enough to give you a quick death, but you asked for such a tragic one."</p>
