<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4100 The Origin Of The Ancestry-level Bloodline</b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>



  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't expect that the Monkey Spirit King would bring him back to the Ghost Mountain because he needed help regarding the wolf teeth.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King had just awakened.</p>

  <p>The wolf teeth were very important to him. If there was only a chance to infuse the bloodline power into them, he would definitely do it.</p>

  <p>Seeing how Luo Zheng personally repaired the thirteen wolf teeth, he immediately realized that Luo Zheng would be the key.</p>

  <p>Now that he knew that Luo Zheng possessed the ancestry-level bloodline, there was no way that he would let this opportunity slip by.</p>

  <p>However, after being surprised by the Monkey Spirit King's request, Luo Zheng let out a sigh as a slight frown emerged on his face.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I can't do it," Luo Zheng finally said. "Why is that?" the Monkey Spirit King asked as his brows furrowed.</p>

  <p>"The ancestry-level bloodline is not really under my control," Luo Zheng tried to explain briefly.</p>

  <p>He was telling the truth. In fact, he even wanted to ask the Monkey Spirit King on how he could control and use the bloodline.</p>

  <p>As expected, the Monkey Spirit King didn't believe him right away.</p>

  <p>"You know, I don't like to force others. So, you can name a higher price.</p>

  <p>That won't be a problem," the Monkey Spirit King insisted.</p>

  <p>"I apologize, but please believe me," Luo Zheng said with all sincerity. "I don't know if it just chose me by pure coincidence or not, but right now, it's living inside my body and I can't really control it. About the wolf teeth, the bloodline repaired them on its own."</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King didn't really want to accept Luo Zheng's explanation, but he didn't find any reason for Luo Zheng to lie about it.</p>

  <p>"With that, I am actually hoping if you can give me some advice on how I can properly control the ancestry-level bloodline," Luo Zheng added.</p>

  <p>After all, the Monkey Spirit King was one of the heads of the Four Spirits Sect, and also its founder. Naturally Luo Zheng thought that the Monkey Spirit King should know more about the bloodline than him.</p>

  <p>"Really? How could this happen?" The Monkey Spirit King let out a deep sigh as an obviously disappointed expression revealed on his face. Luo Zheng already explained his side of the story.</p>

  <p>Now it was up to the Monkey Spirit King whether he would believe Luo Zheng or not.</p>

  <p>"Well, let me think about it first."</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King raised his head and looked at the ceiling of the inner layer of the Ghost Mountain. He tried his best to search his memories regarding the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng just kept silent and waited patiently and expectantly.</p>

  <p>After a while, the Monkey Spirit King rubbed his chin and said, "Sheehan was the one who obtained the ancestry-level bloodline. Then, Kincaid studied its abilities, and Cornelius built the Eternal Divine Courtyard afterward. Damn it, I'm the only one who doesn't have anything to do with the ancestry-level bloodline!"</p>

  <p>In the beginning, the four sect leaders divided their duties.</p>

  <p>Sheehan, the Bird Spirit King, was the one responsible for the exploration of different things. Kincaid, the Human Spirit King, was the smartest, so he was in charge of studying and making researches. Cornelius, the Snake Spirit King, was also very bright, but what he was known for were his resourcefulness and detailed execution.</p>

  <p>Lastly, the Monkey Spirit King's strength lay in his expertise in dominating battles.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Masters and the monkey spirits didn't possess high intelligence but they were fearsome fighters.</p>

  <p>Wherever the Monkey Spirit King led them, they followed suit, and victory was theirs.</p>

  <p>If new powerful weapons were made in the Four Spirits Sect, the Monkey Spirit Sect had the liberty to use and try them out first.</p>

  <p>That said, the leader of the Human Spirit Sect, Kincaid, was the one who helped the Monkey Spirit King inject the bloodline powers into the Thirteen Teeth Necklace.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng heard the Monkey Spirit King's answer, his mouth almost opened wide as he was rendered speechless.</p>

  <p>It turned out that the Monkey Spirit King actually knew nothing about the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>The omnipotent Monkey Spirit King was apparently the only reckless leader among the four heads of the Four Spirits Sect.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, while Luo Zheng was still in a daze, the Monkey Spirit King seemed to have remembered something helpful. "I think there are still some documents about the ancestry-level bloodline in the Ghost Mountain."</p>

  <p>After all, the Four Spirits Sect shared important resources and ensured that everyone had a copy.</p>

  <p>Whenever the Human Spirit Sect found something new, they would give a copy to the Monkey Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>Thus, the Monkey Spirit King knew that they must have some documents regarding the ancestry-level bloodline somewhere in the Ghost Mountain.</p>

  <p>They just tended to forget because they didn't pay much attention to these documents. The same was true for every member, including Manuel and the other Monkey Masters.</p>

  <p>Back when the Primeval Lord of Heaven was locked up in the Ghost Mountain, he had inquired about the blended bloodlines from Manuel and Tearrag.</p>

  <p>However, they did not remember that the documents related to that topic actually existed. Fortunately, the Monkey Spirit King had a slightly better memory than the Monkey Masters.</p>

  <p>"I see. Then, can I borrow those documents?" Luo Zheng's eyes suddenly lit up.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sure," said the Monkey Spirit King.</p>

  <p>"If it will help you gain better understanding of the bloodline, I'll be more than willing to lend you those," he added.</p>

  <p>He had already been skilled at using thirteen kinds of bloodline power.</p>

  <p>Because of that, he could maximize the power of the Thirteen Teeth Necklace and release tremendous strength.</p>

  <p>And if he obtained twenty-two kinds of bloodline power, he would be able to improve his strength to a whole new level.</p>

  <p>For that, he was hoping that Luo Zheng could control the ancestry-level bloodline and help him.</p>

  <p>It was like hitting two birds with one stone. Luo Zheng was also eager to gain control of the bloodline in his body, so it would be both a win for them.</p>

  <p>"But I'm afraid I won't be able to do it alone. I need two other people to help me with this," Luo Zheng said. "No problem. Do what you got to do," the Monkey Spirit King agreed without hesitation.</p>

  <p>After a while, the Monkey Masters went to the Night View Island to invite the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the Snake Goddess. They were the two people in Luo Zheng's mind that could greatly help him.</p>

  <p>As they didn't know why Luo Zheng was abruptly summoned to the Ghost Mountain, they naturally looked at him with inquiring eyes.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng quickly understood the meaning of their stares, so he told them the overview of the Monkey Spirit King's request.</p>

  <p>As the leader of the Ghost Mountain, the Monkey Spirit King appeared to be very omnipotent in the eyes of the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the Snake Goddess.</p>

  <p>After all, he was a leader of the Four Spirits Sect, the master of everything.</p>

  <p>That was why when they heard everything that Luo Zheng said, they were extremely shocked.</p>

  <p>Apparently, the strongest being in the Four Spirits Sect was the one who didn't know anything about the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven and the Snake Goddess had mixed feelings about what they heard.</p>

  <p>Of course, it was a given that they were extremely surprised, but they were also overjoyed because it meant that they had the chance to read the documents about the ancestry-level bloodline. Gaining knowledge from the esteemed Four Spirits Sect was something that they would absolutely indulge on.</p>

  <p>Soon after, several Monkey Masters had escorted them to the hall at the top floor of the Ghost Mountain.</p>

  <p>As they entered the hall, they instantly saw that it was covered with thick dust. They could just imagine how many years had passed by without anyone setting foot in that place.</p>

  <p>Tearrag also entered and walked towards the end of the hall. As he gently touched a spot on the wall, a rumbling sound was instantly heard. A rectangular stone coffin surfaced from the wall. Inside it, there were multiple square stone tablets, on which distinct Sanskrit words were engraved.</p>

  <p>"These are the records about the ancestry-level bloodline. Study them for as long as you want. However, don't touch the other stone coffins on the wall," Tearrag warned them.</p>

  <p>They assumed that the history, unique skills, and bloodline theurgies of the Monkey Spirit Sect must have been recorded there.</p>

  <p>Although they were well organized, the Monkey Masters never bothered to take time to read them.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven and the Snake Goddess just nodded at Tearrag as their eyes focused on the stone tablets in front of them.</p>

  <p>They had stayed in the Ghost Mountain for a long time so they now had a good understanding of Sanskrit words.</p>

  <p>However, they recognized that it would still take them several hours to completely read all the words on the stone tablets. This would make their work both inefficient and inaccurate.</p>

  <p>This was an important task so the two stared at Luo Zheng after they looked at all the stone tablets.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng quickly knew what they meant. He asked the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization to decipher the contents on the stone tablets for them.</p>

  <p>After they were translated, Luo Zheng told them the words.</p>

  <p>According to the records on the stone tablets, Sheehan managed to obtain the ancestry-level bloodline on one of his explorations.</p>

  <p>Back then, he had lost his way and went into a Time Vessel.</p>

  <p>However, the time and space in the main world were totally different from what Luo Zheng and the others knew.</p>

  <p>Therefore, they weren't able to imagine what the Time Vessel was like.</p>

  <p>They could only guess that it was some kind of vessel that was related to time.</p>

  <p>Then, the records said that the ancestry-level bloodline was obtained in the Time Vessel.</p>

  <p>At that time, the Four Spirits Sect was already quite influential, but it was far from being able to dominate the main world.</p>

  <p>However, after they acquired the ancestry-level bloodline, everything changed. The human spirits, bird spirits, snake spirits, and monkey spirits were endowed with all sorts of abilities, and their strength increased at an incredible rate.</p>

  <p>Realizing that they could obtain more power, Kincaid and Cornelius became greedy and weren't willing to stop at that point. They weren't satisfied with what they had yet, knowing that the energy contained in the ancestry-level bloodline was infinite.</p>
