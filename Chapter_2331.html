  <p>
</p>

  <p>Dark Crows were crushed by the True Gods one after another, leaving a thick layer of divine might coins that blanketed the valley.</p>

  <p>It was an impressive amount even for the rich clans on the Floating Islands but under the suppression of the Great Dominance Technique deployed by Bevan, nobody dared to scramble for the divine might coins.</p>

  <p>Everyone did their best to try and kill the crows in the sky.</p>

  <p>Even though Rhyme Butterflies in the first wave and the Poisonous Wolf Scorpions in the second wave were easy to deal with, the crows in the third wave made them feel some pressure.</p>

  <p>Just five minutes later...</p>

  <p>No more crows appeared from the four entrances of the valley.</p>

  <p>The fight with the third wave of beasts came to an end.</p>

  <p>The light brown gem on Bevan's forehead slowly dimmed and dissipated as he quietly retreated to the side.</p>

  <p>It disappeared along with the powerful aura that emitted from his body.</p>

  <p>With Bevan no longer suppressing the True Gods, they turned to greedily look at the divine might coins.</p>

  <p>If nobody stopped them, then the True Gods would probably be fighting for the coins in just a moment!</p>

  <p>"Don't take any of that! Gather them together!"</p>

  <p>Reginald ordered. His entire body emitted a powerful aura from his fighting intent that was boiling in his body.</p>

  <p>If no one stepped in, the low-rank True Gods and mid-rank True Gods wouldn't get any divine might coins because all of them would fall into the hands of the top-rank True Gods.</p>

  <p>That wasn't difficult for the True Gods to understand and so they didn't act rashly.</p>

  <p>Reginald and the other top-rank True Gods waved their hands and the divine might coins on the ground gathered together, forming a small hill that was as high as forty or fifty feet.</p>

  <p>With those top-rank True Gods guarding the small hill of divine might coins, no one dared to take a move. The pile contained seven or eight hundred thousand divine might coins, and if they were divided equally, every True God would get a good share.</p>

  <p>Under the command of Reginald, all the True Gods got in line and orderly took the divine might coins.</p>

  <p>After distributing the divine might coins, Reginald said, "The first three waves of beasts are only the preliminary levels of the trial. Based on past experiences, there wouldn't be many beasts in the fourth round but they're very powerful. Be careful."</p>

  <p>Many True Gods nodded.</p>

  <p>They didn't know how long they would stay here, but if they persisted and fought one more wave of beasts, they would get more rewards. They would be more resolute because of the expectations in their hearts.</p>

  <p>"Rumble..."</p>

  <p>As soon as Reginald finished speaking, the valley began to tremble again.</p>

  <p>Everyone turned and fixed their eyes on the entrances, and Zheng was no exception.</p>

  <p>A huge sword with flames rose from an entrance and a black huge claw with many sharp thorns on the back that was holding the sword came after.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>Thundering footsteps erupted when a huge figure walked out from that entrance.</p>

  <p>"Bang! Bang! Bang!"</p>

  <p>Each time it took a step, the whole valley shook.</p>

  <p>"What's that?" Surprised, Zheng asked as he raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>It was a monster as high as fifty or sixty feet.</p>

  <p>Compared to the giant monsters in the Swirl Forest, this one wasn't especially tall.</p>

  <p>It wasn't too big but the monster's appearance was just too ferocious, and one look would repulse people. No one wanted to face it!</p>

  <p>There were two huge horns on its head and it had a skinless face. Two dark red eyeballs bulged out of its sockets and its bones were exposed.</p>

  <p>Flames burned on the outer ring of its eyeballs and it emitted the pungent smell of sulfur.</p>

  <p>"It's a monster from the abyss!"</p>

  <p>"The Abyss Demon is coming!"</p>

  <p>"Who'll fight it first?"</p>

  <p>The most terrifying of the four great forbidden areas was the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>The Time Sea Forbidden Land, together with four others were listed as the sixth level forbidden areas. When True Gods explored the Time Sea Forbidden Land, they usually wouldn't go too deep. Because the deeper they went, the more strange the Time Law was. Even consummate True Gods couldn't resist some kinds of Time Law. Ordinary True Gods usually stopped after they explored the second stage, while consummate True Gods could explore the third stage at most.</p>

  <p>Very few consummate True Gods would dare to break into the fourth stage of the Time Sea Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>The fifth and sixth stages weren't opened at all because of the rule set by the leader of the Sun Blind race.</p>

  <p>There wasn't any strange Time Law in the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>However, almost all of the terrifying legends in the entirety of the divine land came from the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>In countless divine eras, billions of divine citizens and True Gods had a rich imagination about death and hell. Those thoughts turned into negative Faith Energy and were constantly gathered in the Abyss Demon Region, creating the most terrifying forbidden area.</p>

  <p>It was said that in the bottom of the Abyss Demon Region, some powerful fiends could even kill Holy Beings!</p>

  <p>The Abyss Demon was a kind of ferocious beast that existed only on the surface of the Abyss Demon Region, but it wasn't something an ordinary True God could fight against. Even Reginald, Bevan, and the other top-rank True Gods felt that it would be very tricky to deal with it.</p>

  <p>"Bang! Bang! Bang!"</p>

  <p>What was worse was that there were four of them.</p>

  <p>They appeared from the four entrances, waving their huge swords of flames and trudged to the Goddess Statue. Their tails made of black bones swayed like a long whip. A diamond shaped sting was at the tip of their tails, one of the most powerful weapons used by the Abyss Demons.</p>

  <p>It was fortunate that the Abyss Demons were very slow in their movements. Step by step, they slowly walked towards the Goddess Statue.</p>

  <p>"I've never been to the Abyss Demon Region before," Reginald stated.</p>

  <p>"Who is experienced in dealing with them?"</p>

  <p>The Abyss Demon Region wasn't a place everyone could go to.</p>

  <p>"I am," replied Soren with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>"What should we do?" asked Reginald.</p>

  <p>"They're very powerful..." Soren shook his head. "No top-rank True God present here can resist any of their blows."</p>

  <p>Some of the True Gods subconsciously looked at the Star Door as their hearts sank at those words. The top-rank True Gods weren't a match for the Abyss Demons and so it was better to run away as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>They already got enough divine might coins.</p>

  <p>"Let's give up!"</p>

  <p>"Even top-rank True Gods won't be a match for them, we'll only be killed if we fight them."</p>

  <p>"We already have had the harvest that has far exceeded our expectations in this Time Sea Forbidden Land. We have no regrets."</p>

  <p>Soren stared at the Abyss Demons which were walking slowly in the distance and spoke, "The Abyss Demons' weakness is that they're very slow. In fact, they're a kind of puppet made up of the bones of fiends and they're not very smart. If we want to kill them, we have to delay them as much as possible and we shouldn't get too close to them."</p>

  <p>Cold air rose from his hands as he spoke, and a handful of ice cocoons appeared in his hands. Exquisite ice butterflies broke out from the cocoons and flew around him. He said confidently, "Do you understand what I mean?"</p>
