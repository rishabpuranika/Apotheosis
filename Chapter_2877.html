<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2877 Crossing The First Line </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The tall and beautiful woman calmed down.</p>

  <p>Dorothy was not a child anymore. She was very clear about the dangers that she could face on the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>With Dorothy's ability, she could cross the first line of the Sea of Truth with just a soul pill, even if she didn't use the Necklace of Mystic Soul.</p>

  <p>"I'll drag her back from the Sea of Truth!" As the strapping man spoke, a soul force burst out from his eyes and formed a soul ring that then began hovering over Dorothy's head.</p>

  <p>With his ability, this man could indeed separate the Soul of Light from the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>However, to employ such a secret soul technique would be a great test for him. At the same time, even though it would save Dorothy, it would hurt her soul.</p>

  <p>Seeing that the man was about to use the secret soul technique, the woman suddenly reached out and gently tapped the soul ring, causing it to break down and disappear.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing?" the man snapped.</p>

  <p>The woman shook her head disapprovingly. "Dorothy has grown up. She's not a child anymore. Crossing the Sea of Truth is just a small training for her. We should believe in her."</p>

  <p>"But she's in danger now!" the man replied anxiously.</p>

  <p>At this, the woman smiled softly. "She will face a lot more life and death situations in the future. You won't be able to protect her every time.</p>

  <p>Anyway, I have a feeling she will cross the first line. And if she really can't hold on, she'll leave the Sea of Truth."</p>

  <p>The man frowned at first, but then he gradually calmed down, finding reason in her words.</p>

  <p>Dorothy, Luo Zheng, and the others were only two hundred feet away from the first line.</p>

  <p>There were only five Truth Boats following Luo Zheng, and Dora's was one of them.</p>

  <p>'Crossing the Sea of Truth isn't as easy as I thought. There are nine lines in the Sea of Truth, and I'm only now crossing the first one...' Luo Zheng thought, taking a glance at the scene behind him.</p>

  <p>As soon as he turned around, another one of the people behind him couldn't hold on anymore and his Truth Boat broke into pieces. But before he could sink, he quickly used the Illusion Breaking Rune and escaped from the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>Now, there were only four boats left.</p>

  <p>"The last one hundred feet!"</p>

  <p>Dora couldn't bear it anymore.</p>

  <p>In fact, she had already done a great job.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had cultivated the Soul of Light for a long time, but Dora had only started cultivating hers after becoming a consummate True God. After that, she had quickly practiced the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent to reach the consummate level. Then, she had immediately stepped into the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>Compared to her, Luo Zheng had a much deeper foundation.</p>

  <p>Surrounded by the pressure of the strong wind and the chill of the Sea of Truth, Dora felt like her Soul of Light was as fragile as a piece of paper.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, her Truth Boat began to shake and was about to fall apart.</p>

  <p>With a sigh, she reluctantly took a soul pill.</p>

  <p>The soul pill was also a body of soul. The moment it was integrated into her Soul of Light, it began to release a pure soul power.</p>

  <p>The soul power that warmed her Soul of Light made Dora feel relieved, which immediately eased more than half of the pressure she was feeling.</p>

  <p>She cast another glance at Luo Zheng, who was still standing at his boat's bow like an iron tower...</p>

  <p>'This guy is really something else...' she thought to herself.</p>

  <p>Before entering the Sea of Truth, she had done some research about it.</p>

  <p>As far as she knew, only a few people could cross the first line just by using their Souls of Light. The most of the warriors needed more than one soul pill, and this was more often the case.</p>

  <p>Naturally, she couldn't believe that a man from outside the Source World was able to resist the pressure with just his Soul of Light.</p>

  <p>As the distance from the line grew smaller, Luo Zheng felt the pressure on him multiply.</p>

  <p>His eyes flashed, and a golden light appeared on the surface of his soul. His gaze turned cold.</p>

  <p>After he entered the state of emotion closing, he found that all the pressure was gone.</p>

  <p>It didn't mean that the pressure had stopped or disappeared; Luo Zheng's mind had just completely blocked it so that he wouldn't feel it. In this state, he still needed to closely observe his Soul of Light. If the Soul of Light showed signs of breaking or if the Truth Boat wasn't able to hold on, he could only choose to swallow a soul pill or leave the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, one hundred feet was a small distance, and in just a few seconds, the Truth Boat crossed the first line.</p>

  <p>The moment Luo Zheng crossed the line, he felt like he left a cold snowfield and entered a warm room. All the pressure vanished.</p>

  <p>"Hooo!"</p>

  <p>Next, Dora also crossed the line, finally letting out a breath that she hadn't even realized she had been holding.</p>

  <p>The other two warriors behind them crossed the line as well.</p>

  <p>One of them was so exhausted that he had to lean against his Truth Boat for support. It was much more exhausting for one to control their soul power than to control the strength of their physical body. If the warrior did not handle the crossing of the line properly, it would cause damage to their Soul of Light.</p>

  <p>Dora stretched her Soul of Light and activated her Truth Boat, and then she moved forward until she was drifting side by side with Luo Zheng. With a smile, she said, "You didn't use soul pills at all! That's really surprising."</p>

  <p>She wanted to add that he must come from some great force, but in the end, she kept mum.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Zheng had kept his background a secret, she knew that the polite thing to do would be to avoid that topic.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng returned from the state of emotion closing and said indifferently, "I don't know how difficult crossing the second line is going to be."</p>

  <p>"Are you going to cross it now?" Dora pouted.</p>

  <p>"Do I need to prepare for it?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Dora nodded in response. "Of course! Don't you know the meaning of the Sea of Truth?"</p>

  <p>"The meaning? I only know that the Sea of Truth is a way to the Other Shore." Luo Zheng shrugged.</p>

  <p>For a moment, Dora was so surprised that she went speechless. Then, she retorted, "You have no knowledge of the Sea of Truth at all! The Sea of Truth is actually a huge place for soul cultivation."</p>

  <p>"A place for soul cultivation?" These words triggered Luo Zheng's curiosity.</p>

  <p>"That's right. As long as the Soul of Light enters the Sea of Truth, it will continuously grow stronger. As it becomes stronger, it will be able to go further in the Sea of Truth. Isn't this a process of cultivation?" Dora said.</p>

  <p>"You're right. That's a good point." Luo Zheng nodded. While bearing the strong winds and the cold air in the Sea of Truth, the Soul of Light would grow stronger and stronger. "But one can only cultivate the soul in the Sea of Truth, right? How can I strengthen my cinnabar field and my physical body?"</p>

  <p>According to No. 9527, no one in the Source World so far had been able to put their body into the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>In other words, when one reached the end of the Godly Way through the Grand World Cultivation Method, their physical body's strength would not be able to increase. Similarly, Luo Zheng wanted to know how to reinforce the inner world.</p>

  <p>"Haven't you ever met an Other Shore Realm warrior?" Dora asked.</p>

  <p>"I have, but I know nothing about them," Luo Zheng replied honestly.</p>

  <p>Emily, Timotheus, and Leopold were all very powerful, but Luo Zheng didn't know where their strength came from.</p>

  <p>"Humph, when you reach the end of this sea, you will understand," Dora said.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng merely smiled at her in response, deciding to stop asking questions. If he really wanted to know more about the Other Shore Realm, he had a lot of ways to do it.</p>

  <p>However, he was confident that he would eventually reach the Other Shore of the sea. Then, he would be able to find out what existed there on his own.</p>
