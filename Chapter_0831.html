  <p>
</p>

  <p>It was known that one's Mu Ning depended on the strength of his or her soul.</p>

  <p>The stronger the soul was, the more oppressive one's Mu Ning would be.</p>

  <p>As for Luo Luo Zheng, he restrained his Mu Ning after his soul had entered the Fighting Soul Realm. Only strong warriors could see how powerful his soul was, whereas normal people wouldn't be able to detect it at all.</p>

  <p>Souls at the Fighting Soul Realm were something that even war sages found difficult to obtain. The ones who could have them were only those who had stepped foot inside the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>The tavern was full of chatter and the smell of food, when a sudden majestic Mu Ning burst out from Luo Zheng's body and spread everywhere like a tidal wave. The surge struck Don first, who was in front of him.</p>

  <p>The surprise hit made Don's eyes widen to the size of saucers. The human war fighter in front of him was truly like a fearless beast.</p>

  <p>But since Luo Luo Zheng had just arrived at the Tower of Sin, he did not attack with his soul. Moreover, there were too few humans in the tower, which made attacking an impossible option. If the other races joined forces to assault him, Luo Luo Zheng would surely lose.</p>

  <p>After all, there were many level ten war lords as well in the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>While Luo Zheng's Mu Ning exploded, his body also released the malicious Mu Ning stored in the Killing Sword Mountain. His soul pressure and surging malicious Mu Ning made him look like a god of slaughter.</p>

  <p>Pak!</p>

  <p>A waiter with a jug of wine came over to serve drinks. When he sensed the Mu Ning Luo Luo Zheng radiated, his knees buckled, then the jug in his hand fell to the floor and shattered into pieces. All the color was drained from his face as he clutched the table beside him to support himself.</p>

  <p>What the waiter was hit with was only the tip of the iceberg. Luo Zheng's Mu Ning continued to burst forth to intimidate the two ogre war lords? Don and his companion.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Don felt like his chest was being squeezed, making him unable to breathe. How did this young human have such a terrifying Mu Ning?</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Luo Luo Zheng gradually increased his malicious Mu Ning. Don's entire body shook with fear and his teeth chattered loudly as he took two steps backward.</p>

  <p>It seemed that Luo Zheng's method worked as both the ogre war lords trembled nervously. Both of them had just made a breakthrough and became war lords. They felt like they had touched upon a new domain and reached the upper echelon of the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>In the Tower of Sin, war fighters were at the bottom, war generals were at the middle, and the war lords were at the upper echelon.</p>

  <p>After Don and his companion became war lords, they heard rumors among the ogres that an extremely powerful human had appeared. With that, they thought that this level eight war fighter deserved to be humiliated. But who would've thought that the human would be so terrifying?</p>

  <p>Regret and embarrassment coursed through their beings. If this had spread, they wouldn't have any faces to show the ogres at all. Two ogre war lords got beaten by a human war fighter? It was so humiliating!</p>

  <p>However, there was no way they could resist now, unless they started a fight.</p>

  <p>Then again, there was a human war lord in the tavern as well. Even if they tried, they might not be able to win.</p>

  <p>As time passed, the two ogres could no longer withstand the pressure of Luo Zheng's Mu Ning. They could only retreat continuously until their backs touched the tavern's entrance door.</p>

  <p>The two ogres looked positively miserable as they balled their hands into fists. They stared angrily at Luo Luo Zheng, but no words came out of their lips.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stored the malicious Mu Ning back into the Killing Sword Mountain and quickly withdrew his soul pressure. His body immediately returned into its previous state as a faint smile graced his lips. He gave off the feeling of a spring breeze, but who would've thought that this young man's Mu Ning had forced the two ogre war lords to retreat just now?</p>

  <p>"Do you still want to humiliate yourselves?" Luo Luo Zheng said lightly when the two ogres had yet to leave.</p>

  <p>Don glared at Luo Luo Zheng with clenched teeth. In the end, he could only leave. He left Luo Luo Zheng with angry parting words, "We'll meet again. Just wait and see!"</p>

  <p>With that said, he and the other ogre war lord left.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng's Mu Ning spread out just now, it attracted many of the surrounding creatures, including war fighters and war generals of various races.</p>

  <p>The moment they saw that it was a human war fighter who forcefully used his soul pressure to drive the two ogre war lords out of the tavern, their jaws dropped in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Is that guy really a human war fighter?"</p>

  <p>"He is indeed a level eight war fighter. His name is  Luo Luo Zheng Luo. He recently entered the Tower of Sin. If we can't defeat him in the arena, he'll ascend to the top floor. I'm afraid that the humans would have another seat!"</p>

  <p>"When did such a talent appear in the human race? Not even the ogres or the Demon Night would have someone as powerful as him."</p>

  <p>"Are you joking?</p>

  <p>This has never happened in our Sea God Continent since the ancient times.</p>

  <p>His soul pressure forced back two ogre war lords? this is simply unimaginable. If it wasn't for the fact that the humans and ogres are not in good terms, I would've thought that they were acting!"</p>

  <p>Many of the creatures chattered among themselves by the door.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Olivia remained seated in her original position and stared blankly at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>She was from the Purple Heart Sacred Place, and used to be a proud girl.</p>

  <p>None of the young men in the sacred place had ever caught her fancy.</p>

  <p>Humans were considered weak on the Sea God Continent. Thus, the talents of the Purple Heart Sacred place rarely went out to gain experience, and Olivia was no exception. When she had just gotten out of the sacred place, she had thought that she was the best warrior in the world, and everyone else was inferior to her.</p>

  <p>However, realization hit her when she and her companions entered the Tower of Sin. Humans were weak compared to the other races.</p>

  <p>The Demon Night, the ogres, the giants were all far more powerful than the humans. Therefore, she naturally felt afraid as she fought in the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, she also wondered if the human race was truly mediocre compared to the other races. For instance, the Demon Night members were innately strong and were born without any impurities in their bodies. They were already nature creatures since birth.</p>

  <p>This mentality was her way of thought until she saw Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The moment she heard about him, she, Dylon, and the others attempted to contact Luo Luo Zheng. This human war fighter who came out of nowhere and had just entered the Tower of Sin recently won a "default victory." When Olivia heard this news, she felt that Luo Luo Zheng was truly a strong warrior.</p>

  <p>The talented war fighters of the grand sacred place never dared to go to the Tower of Sin. It was general knowledge that talents needed sufficient training before they could grow, but the Purple Heart Sacred Place didn't dare send its talents to the Tower of Sin. It was because war fighters died too quickly there, and the grand sacred place clearly didn't want that to happen.</p>

  <p>Thus, it was an extremely impressive feat for the humans when Luo Luo Zheng, a human war fighter, won a "default victory."</p>

  <p>However, Dylon had offended Luo Luo Zheng right from the start.</p>

  <p>And Luo Luo Zheng was indeed cocky, as he didn't seem to take the Purple Heart Sacred Place seriously either.</p>

  <p>However, Olivia, Dylon and the rest of their companions received news from the sacred place which asked them to keep a good relationship with Luo Luo Zheng. If Luo Luo Zheng could really grow, then he might be able to win another seat for the human race. All the races on the Sea God Continent considered the seats in the Tower of Sin of great importance.</p>

  <p>When Olivia came into contact with Luo Luo Zheng again, he had actually defeated Teresa, the divine-level talent of the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>That was truly shocking. This surprising news made Olivia's heart tremble to the core.</p>

  <p>Finally, she felt that there was now a man who could enter her heart.</p>

  <p>So even though she was rightfully furious when Luo Luo Zheng had considered her as a prostitute and asked her how much she could get for one night, she endured it in the end.</p>

  <p>To a strong warrior, arrogance was not a foolish act? it was only his inherent pride.</p>

  <p>At that point, Luo Luo Zheng had already had a big place in Olivia's heart. She thought that even though Luo Luo Zheng was only a level eight war fighter, he could probably fight against a level nine or even a level ten war general.</p>

  <p>She felt that she might have overestimated Luo Luo Zheng with that thought, but never had she expected Luo Luo Zheng to successfully force two ogre war lords to retreat by just relying on his own Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>That was simply unbelievable!</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Luo Luo Zheng became truly mysterious and even unattainable in her eyes.</p>

  <p>Now, majority of the human talents came from the Purple Heart Sacred Place. The remaining human forces came from smaller sects that allied themselves to the sacred place. In that case, where did Luo Luo Zheng come from?</p>
