<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Dick was levels higher than Luo Zheng. But when he saw the latter emitted a powerful life vitality in a short span of time, he started to become serious.</p>

  <p>Dick was surprised to see Zheng's body strength. But he thought that Luo Zheng had only the corporeal body strength, so he still didn't pay too much attention to him.</p>

  <p>Despite Zheng's powerful defense, Dick didn't fear him at all. After all, if Luo Zheng could not break through his power of defense song, Dick would never be defeated.</p>

  <p>But seeing the life vitality Luo Zheng emitted all of a sudden, Dick knew that defeating Luo Zheng wouldn't be easy.</p>

  <p>Dick was still curious as to why Luo Zheng didn't use the life vitality in his previous matches.</p>

  <p>There were only two possibilities. Firstly, Luo Zheng didn't have a powerful life vitality, and Zheng's most powerful shot was his enormous innate superhuman strength.</p>

  <p>Secondly, Luo Zheng had far more power than he had expected, and he'd been hiding his own advantages during his previous fights because he didn't want others to know his trump card.</p>

  <p>But based on his assessment, the first one was nearly impossible. Zheng's body and strength were in such a formidable status so how could his life vitality be weak? Moreover, the two clouds of dark purple life vitality in front of him gave him the clue of how much power Zheng's life vitality had. 'This power is really strong!' Dick thought to himself.</p>

  <p>While Dick was lost in his own thoughts, he was retreating as his hand kept writing swiftly. The words of 'Kill' flew out from his brush pen simultaneously. This fight seemed to go on forever.</p>

  <p>Dick had forgotten that Luo Zheng was only at grade-two nature level. He considered Luo Zheng as the most powerful opponent he had ever encountered in the battle ring.</p>

  <p>"Kill, kill, kill..."</p>

  <p>The words formed and flew out from the end of Dick's brush pen. They made an amazing array and rushed towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Thirteen Kills Array!"</p>

  <p>The Thirteen Kills Array was Dick's most powerful attack move and his absolute killer.</p>

  <p>But this final killer was not originally intended for Luo Zheng. He was reserving this attack move for the personal disciples of the big men.</p>

  <p>The Blackrock Peak was the second-ranked peak in Cloud Sect. And being the top disciple of the Blackrock Peak, Dick had the ambition to be the top one in the All Peaks Competition. The personal disciples of the big men were stronger than most of the disciples from the thirty-three peaks, and Dick had intended to reserve that skill to them.</p>

  <p>But now Dick realized that he needed to use that skill to Luo Zheng or he wouldn't have the chance to win this competition.</p>

  <p>Dick could just admit defeat and give up at that moment. With his undefeated record in all his other fights, he could go on in the competition even if he had lost one or two rounds.</p>

  <p>But Dick wasn't willing to do anything like that. He was a gentleman and he couldn't do such tricks. Besides, his opponent was just at grade-two nature level. If he truly wasn't as strong as Luo Zheng, he would rather lose to him than give up. He was a gentleman and he could not give up without even trying to fight.</p>

  <p>Once the Thirteen Kills Array appeared, the fighting court was filled with killing intent and Luo Zheng felt a sense of oppression as if he was in hell.</p>

  <p>The face of the referee turned pale and hurriedly got out of the stage. The audience was just relieved that the enhanced barrier prevented the killing intent from getting out of the stage.</p>

  <p>"It is the Thirteen Kills Array!" Luo Zheng was surprised to see the array made of thirteen words of kill rushed towards him.</p>

  <p>One word could already have such powerful strength and it could resist his own strength. What was more if there were thirteen words? He then realized that he had to be serious and give it his best.</p>

  <p>"Demonic phantom! Start!" Luo Zheng shouted.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, there were six dark purple figures flowing out from Zheng's back.</p>

  <p>The six demonic phantom figures were in different shapes, but all of them looked like Luo Zheng. And as soon as they appeared, the demonic phantom figures rushed towards the killing array.</p>

  <p>The array made of thirteen kills had power beyond one's imagination. As the first demonic phantom figure reached the array, the thirteen kills began to rotate around it. They formed a garrote around the neck of the demonic phantom figure.</p>

  <p>But the demonic phantom figure was too tough to be broken that easily.</p>

  <p>The clash of the array and the demonic phantom figure created a deafening sound.</p>

  <p>"Cranking! Cranking!"</p>

  <p>It seemed like something hard was put into a huge revolving gear wheel creating a grating sound.</p>

  <p>"Click, click."</p>

  <p>Cracks started appearing on the surface of the first demonic phantom figure. At the same time, three of the thirteen words of the killing array also began to crack.</p>

  <p>As the scene unveiled, Dick's face turned pale.</p>

  <p>The Thirteen Kills Array was powerful. Dick had done a lot of tests after he had successfully created them.</p>

  <p>He tried to garrote wood and it went well. The whole block of tough teak wood was garroted into little pieces and turned into dust.</p>

  <p>After that, he tried them with stones and got the same result.</p>

  <p>Then he moved up with steel, mysterious weapons, and even spiritual weapons.</p>

  <p>During Dick's tests, nothing survived his Thirteen Kills Array.</p>

  <p>But things were different today.</p>

  <p>What was special about Zheng's demonic phantoms was that they remained in shape after being garroted. How did Luo Zheng do it?</p>

  <p>Normally, the life vitality of a warrior could change its shape into a weapon by contemplation, but the weapon couldn't be tougher than any real ones.</p>

  <p>That was why even though warriors could change their life vitality into any kind of weapon, they preferred to use a real weapon instead.</p>

  <p>However, there was an exception to this norm, and that was James Mo.</p>

  <p>His cultivation method was so special that the life vitality sword he made could be as solid as a fairy weapon. That kind of sword needed a great amount of life vitality to support it. Aside from that, the life vitality sword required a lot of time to make. When James created his life vitality sword, he needed to change thousands of weapons and do tons of extra work before he succeeded. In short, it was a long and complex process.</p>

  <p>The fight among warriors only lasted for a few minutes. And if a warrior had a fairy weapon at hand, he needed not to waste a long time to create a life vitality sword.</p>

  <p>The only reason James created a life vitality sword was that Mo's family could not afford to buy a fairy weapon for him.</p>

  <p>But most life vitality weapons lacked defense and they would surely not survive Dick's Thirteen Kills Array.</p>

  <p>Zheng's demonic phantom figure, however, was different from any life vitality weapons. It was not cut into pieces like any spiritual weapons when hit by Dick's killing array. That could only mean that his demonic phantom was nearly as hard as a fairy weapon.</p>

  <p>There was something that Dick didn't know about the demonic phantoms. They were not contemplated by Luo Zheng. That was why they were different from other life vitality weapons. Luo Zheng only contemplated the sparkling starlight inside the demonic life vitality. As for the demonic phantoms, they were the results of Zheng's leveled up Heavenly Ogre Fist.</p>

  <p>'Luo Zheng is really different, ' Dick thought with a bitter smile on his face.</p>

  <p>But soon his smile vanished. As a top disciple of the Blackrock Peak, he couldn't give up just because of Zheng's outstanding demonic phantom.</p>

  <p>Although it was unexpectedly strong, Dick had more tricks up his sleeves.</p>

  <p>He was a warrior at the Illuminating Soul Realm. His life vitality was far greater than Zheng's, so he thought that if he kept fighting with Luo Zheng, the latter would end up consuming all his life vitality.</p>

  <p>"Click..."</p>

  <p>The three kill songs were finally shattered into pieces.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Zheng's first demonic phantom figure was also broken.</p>

  <p>One demonic phantom at the expense of his three kills.</p>

  <p>Dick had thirteen 'kill' words. After three of them were broken, only ten were left and their power was reduced.</p>

  <p>If Dick wanted to break the remaining demonic phantoms, he needed to make more words.</p>

  <p>He waved his brush pen and continued writing the word 'Kill'. Even if he needed more words to break one of Zheng's demonic phantom, he could not be defeated that easily. He could keep up longer than Luo Zheng who was only at grade two of the nature level.</p>

  <p>But before Dick could finish another word, he stopped upon realizing what was happening inside the fighting stage.</p>

  <p>The broken demonic phantom figure changed into dark purple life vitality and it started to shape again. After only a few seconds, it was back to its demonic phantom figure once more.</p>

  <p>"How is it possible?" Dick could not believe what he was seeing.</p>

  <p>Dick was a warrior who had always kept his cool even in tough situations.</p>

  <p>"This is insane!"</p>

  <p>He tried to keep calm, but he was so astonished that he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>For an ordinary warrior, the process of changing his life vitality into a weapon was not reversible. For example, Dick could turn his life vitality into words, but once the words were destroyed, they would turn back into original vitality then dissipated into the world again.</p>

  <p>That was why the original vitality existed in the world.</p>

  <p>During a warrior's cultivation, he would absorb original vitality into his body and turn it into his own life vitality. Once he used his life vitality, it would turn into original vitality again. And this was how it should always be.</p>

  <p>In other words, original vitality was the creative power of nature. Human beings could absorb and use it from nature. It was like borrowing nature's creative powers.</p>

  <p>And nature had always been generous. If the life vitality wouldn't turn back into original vitality, the original vitality would have been used up by now considering that there were a lot of people who absorbed and used it.</p>

  <p>No humans could stop the natural cycle. Everyone would return the original vitality to nature after they had used it as their own life vitality.</p>

  <p>But what did Dick see just now?</p>

  <p>When his killing array broke Zheng's demonic phantom, by nature's law, it should have been turned into original vitality and disappeared into nature.</p>

  <p>But, to Dick's surprise, it gathered together and reshaped into a demonic phantom again.</p>

  <p>It was beyond nature's law and human comprehension.</p>

  <p id="top_10">If Dick could see what was happening, so did the rest of the audience.</p>

  <p>Having a slight knowledge about the Heavenly Ogre Fist, Kenneth wasn't that surprised. Although he could not practice the Heavenly Ogre Fist, he clearly understood the wonders of the cultivation method and had seen other people use it. But that was not the case to Elder Yu. He was astonished and couldn't say a word. He just heard about the Heavenly Ogre Fist, but never expected that it had so much power.</p>

  <p>Also, the disciples who knew little about life vitality couldn't keep their excitement. They all roared in cheers and started discussing amongst themselves.</p>
