  <p>
</p>

  <p>When the three-eyed boy stepped forward, he saw Luo Zheng who stood at the side.</p>

  <p>Every human he met in the past were all in their soul forms on the Other Shore, except for the one he encountered when he had trained in Stage Thirteen.</p>

  <p>The three-eyed boy was well-respected in their race because, over recent years, he was the most promising talent to become an Eternal Realm master.</p>

  <p>Their race, known as the Three Eyes race, sent him to Stage Thirteen after they discovered a large number of Burning Crystal mines there. They both wanted him to fight for the mines and hoped that he would get more training in real combats.</p>

  <p>The competition in Stage Thirteen was exceptionally fierce. Both the Element Spirit race and the Nihility race had grabbed their shares of the pie, so the Three Eyes race would naturally have a hard time taking their cut.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, they had a good relationship with the giant ape in Stage Thirteen. Thus, they had more advantages over the other races with the giant ape's help.</p>

  <p>In the end, the powerful combination of the three-eyed boy and the giant ape continuously defeated the forces arranged by the Element Spirit race and the Nihility race in the Dark Region. The black monkeys that was affiliated with the Nihility race suffered the most damage since the three-eyed boy and the giant ape slaughtered so many of their kind.</p>

  <p>As for the pig-faced monsters affiliated with the Element Spirit race, they pinned their hopes on something else instead? which was to produce a purified being.</p>

  <p>The purified being didn't exist in the Dark Region of Stage Thirteen back then. The pig-faced monsters' plan went smoothly until Feng Ge had interrupted their leader Teague, and all their efforts went to waste.</p>

  <p>After that, Luo Zheng and Feng Ge escaped from the Dark Region, and the three-eyed boy never saw them again.</p>

  <p>Now that the three-eyed boy saw Luo Zheng again in Stage Thirty-two, he realized that Luo Zheng was somehow familiar to him.</p>

  <p>But after Luo Zheng had passed through the Soul City and the Land of Bone Tribulation, his aura had changed tremendously. Therefore, it was difficult for the three-eyed boy to confirm his identity.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the leader of the Three Eyes race noticed the three-eyed boy's curious gaze towards Luo Zheng, so he asked, "Egan, do you know this human?"</p>

  <p>Instead of answering the leader's question, Egan turned to Luo Zheng and asked,</p>

  <p>"Have you ever been to the Dark Region in Stage Thirteen?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled and calmly replied, "Of course I have been there."</p>

  <p>Silence hung in the air for a while, then Egan's lips curved up into a smile.</p>

  <p>"Grandpa, I was once seriously injured in Stage Thirteen. It was this human who helped me heal my wounds at that time!" he exclaimed. 'I didn't expect that he would reach the Grand Plain Stage in such a short time!' he thought.</p>

  <p>He wasn't sure of Luo Zheng's identity at first because he knew that it was very difficult to ascend to the current stage where he was from Stage Thirteen.</p>

  <p>Those who were born in Stage Thirty-two like himself were the exception, but he couldn't believe that someone had passed through the lower stages so quickly!</p>

  <p>Their leader was utterly shocked as well. He stared at Luo Zheng and said in a deep voice, "As far as I know, it has only been three years since you went for training in Stage Thirteen. Am I right, Egan? So you mean to say that he ascended from Stage Thirteen to Stage Thirty-two in only three years?"</p>

  <p>The leader of the Three Eyes race was very surprised at such an achievement.</p>

  <p>"Pearce, is it true that it only took him three years?"</p>

  <p>"What a fast improvement, it's almost a miracle!"</p>

  <p>"It seems that the Taiyi Heaven Palace has discovered an extraordinary talent!"</p>

  <p>The other members of the Three Eyes race behind the leader all remarked in awe.</p>

  <p>Although the Three Eyes race couldn't compare to the large races like the Element Spirit race and the Nihility race, they had a higher status than the Taiyi Heaven Palace in Stage Thirty-two and had a much stronger force.</p>

  <p>The reason the Taiyi Heaven Palace had gotten a foot in the door of Stage Thirty-two was because of the protection mechanism in the stage. If the current chaotic era had ended, Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Ying, the only two Eternal Realm masters of the Taiyi Heaven Palace, weren't enough to protect their temple in Stage Thirty-two.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the warriors of the Three Eyes race never expected that a weak force like the Taiyi Heaven Palace would have such an extraordinary junior.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's fast improvement even exceeded that of Eastern Emperor Taiyi!</p>

  <p>Just as the members of the Three Eyes race had yet to recover from shock, Egan suddenly said, "Grandpa, you are wrong. I met Luo Zheng two years after I entered Stage Thirteen. That was about a year ago."</p>

  <p>The people of the Three Eyes race immediately fell silent. They could not help but look Luo Zheng up and down once again.</p>

  <p>To ascend from Stage Thirteen to Stage Thirty-two in only one year...</p>

  <p>How did the Taiyi Heaven Palace manage to find such an extraordinary talent?</p>

  <p>While the people of the Three Eyes race were stunned into silence, Pearce and the others of the Taiyi Heaven Palace felt overjoyed at their reaction.</p>

  <p>Of course, the people of Taiyi Heaven Palace knew Luo Zheng much better than the outsiders.</p>

  <p>They knew that his fast improvement was just one aspect of his many striking talents. "The Taiyi Heaven Palace must have put a lot of efforts and resources into helping you improve, didn't they?" the leader asked with a smile.</p>

  <p>Pearce wanted to deny what the leader said because he knew that Luo Zheng obtained all those resources through his own efforts. However, Luo Zheng answered before him and said, "That's right! I would've never reached the Grand Plain Stage so quickly without the generous support and abundant resources the Taiyi Heaven Palace had given me."</p>

  <p>If the Taiyi Heaven Palace channeled all their resources to provide Luo Zheng with sufficient soul crystal and Body-strengthening Jades, then Luo Zheng's incredible achievement would seem somehow reasonable.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng expected, the warriors of the Three Eyes race sighed in relief at his answer. His explanation sounded easier for them to accept.</p>

  <p>"The disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace don't have a physical form, just a soul on the Other Shore. You are a rare exception since you have entered the Other Shore with a physical body, so of course, they will do their best to train you," the leader of the Three Eyes race said with a smile. "My grandson had obtained four Holy Soul Imprints and five Bone Tribulation Imprints a long time ago.</p>

  <p>He is the warrior with the most imprints in the history of our race. I believe that he will achieve a good ranking in the Eternal Scroll Painting," he added.</p>

  <p>He shifted the topic to his grandson and forgot to ask Luo Zheng about the number of imprints he had obtained.</p>

  <p>Egan's childish face was full of confidence. "Grandpa, I won't let you down," he assured.</p>

  <p>"This young man from the Taiyi Heaven Palace has helped you a lot. After you have entered the Eternal Scroll Painting, you must help him in return," the leader nodded and said. "It will be my pleasure!" Egan exclaimed and smiled at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Thank you very much, Chief," Pearce said calmly and cupped his hands.</p>

  <p>At that point, the leader of the Three Eyes race cast a curious look at Pearce.</p>

  <p>The people of the Taiyi Heaven Palace were usually overjoyed if the Three Eyes race made them such a promise.</p>

  <p>However, Pearce was calm and composed when he expressed his gratitude.</p>

  <p>It seemed that his grandson's help didn't matter so much to him at all.</p>

  <p>'Maybe I am just overthinking...' he thought.</p>

  <p>He didn't know that although his grandson was talented enough to obtain four Holy Soul Imprints and five Bone Tribulation Imprints, it was nothing compared to Luo Zheng's achievements. They were not even on the same level.</p>

  <p>Once their discussion was over, Egan and the two other members of the Three Eyes race found a Three Purities Stone each. They used the Light Stones and entered the Three Purities Stones to put their bodies and Souls of Light into them.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, the soul and body of the creatures on the Other Shore were always together.</p>

  <p>Two anchor bodies appeared on each of the Three Purities Stones after they came out. One was their physical body, and the other was their soul. If they reached the Eternal Realm, the third anchor body would appear there as well.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, many Other Shore races also showed up and followed suit.</p>

  <p>All of them wanted to put their bodies and souls into the Three Purities Stones before the first volume of the Eternal Scroll Painting opened.</p>
