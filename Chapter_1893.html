<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1893 Cold Flame Poison (Part One) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>The Harmony race controlled the Mind Refining Tower which was a sacred place for cultivating one's state of mind.</p>

  <p>Perhaps it was because the mental states of the warriors in the Harmony race were stable and any traits of cruelty could not be found in them, that they were able to maintain a calm and indifferent attitude at all times. In other words, it was easy to get along with them.</p>

  <p>Now that the three great races had gathered together, it was time to set out.</p>

  <p>The Collapsing Mountain race and the Harmony race had arranged for the strongest elites from their races to arrive at the place. The Skyland race was also prepared. Besides the elites of the three races, a few warriors from other races were also willing to practice with them.</p>

  <p>As the second day dawned, clouds dispersed in the skies, and they began to head in the northern direction of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>The Han Clan too had sent out warriors from their clan. Along with Kennan and some others, more than twenty world lords from the Han Clan had arrived. Han Liusu and Aleyna too were present as they set out with the three great races.</p>

  <p>For the three great races, this was undoubtedly an important exploration.</p>

  <p>No one knew of the means through which the Han Clan had convinced the three races to let the warriors of their own clan join them..</p>

  <p>The attitude of the three great races toward the other warriors varied greatly. The Collapsing Mountain warriors were the most domineering.</p>

  <p>They acknowledged the status of the strong warriors alone, which was why it was possible for Pascal, a warrior from another race, to qualify to be their leader. However, even though Pascal had once been the leader of the Collapsing Mountain race, it did not mean that they would give any special treatment to the Han Clan. After all, It was only Pascal among them who was strong enough.</p>

  <p>The Harmony race got along well with other races. They did not care much for the backgrounds of the warriors. Whether it was the secondary creatures or the martial artists from the divine land, they held them all in equal respect.</p>

  <p>As for the Skyland race, they cared for the exchange of benefits. It was their race that had made the decision to allow the Han Clan to explore along with the three great races.</p>

  <p>As they headed toward the north from the base of the Skyland race, many towers were seen along the way. They walked for about ten miles when the densely packed towers disappeared altogether. They had left the territory of the Skyland race.</p>

  <p>A clear boundary appeared before them.</p>

  <p>On one side of the boundary were calm black waters, but the waters ended abruptly at the boundary, as if someone had drawn a decisive line on the ground to demarcate the area. On the other side of the boundary was a vast expanse of ice field.</p>

  <p>The snow and ice land stretched all the way to the end of the world.</p>

  <p>"Stop!"</p>

  <p>All along, it was the Skyland race that had led the way. They walked in front. At this moment, the leader of the Skyland race, Kaydan, suddenly raised his hand and everyone immediately stopped in their tracks.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng felt it to be strange as well. He had seen many strange things in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. Although the scene in front of him was a sight to behold, it was relatively ordinary. However, Kaydan's expression was one of caution.</p>

  <p>They were, after all, the aboriginals of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. There was reason behind their caution. They had probably learned lessons here that they paid for in blood.</p>

  <p>Following Kaydan's orders, some warriors of the Skyland race pulled out blood-red fruits and began distributing them.</p>

  <p>"The cold flame field is a Land of Extreme Chillness. Once you enter it, you will suffer cold flame poison. These Gold Sun Fruits will help you to resist it. However, this place is also where you can practice. The deeper one goes, the stronger the cold flame poison becomes. If martial artists from other races want to comprehend the profound mysteries of the Ice Law, this is the best place for you to do so!"</p>

  <p>The surface of the blood-red fruit was covered with dense lines that emitted a scarlet glow, as if magma flowed within it. A member of the Skyland race flew over to Zheng's side and threw him a fruit. As he caught the seemingly juicy fruit, he immediately felt its scorching heat in his hand.</p>

  <p>He felt the burning sensation seep through him. As the other martial artists caught their respective fruits, they tossed it from one hand to the other in panic, finally wrapping them in life vitality before stuffing them into their space rings.</p>

  <p>When the crowd first heard of the cold flame poison, they did not think much of it.</p>

  <p>After all, the majority of the martial artists present were at the peak of the Spirit Transformation Realm. They were not concerned about the danger of the Land of Extreme Chillness.</p>

  <p>"Aleyna, you should wear this first," Han Liusu said, fishing out a gown embroidered with fiery clouds and handing it over to Aleyna. The Han Clan had operated in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land for many years, so they were very knowledgeable on the layout of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. They knew how horrible the cold flame field was.</p>

  <p>It could be said that the master of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land had recorded all of his comprehension of the Ice Law on this cold flame field.</p>

  <p>Holy Beings were proficient in all laws and it was impossible for them to overlook anything when creating a universe. However, the master of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land specialized in Ice Law and had his own comprehension of it, so the cold flame field could not be underestimated.</p>

  <p>Han Liusu put the gown on Aleyna and then walked over to Luo Zheng, reminding him in a low voice, "Since they want to cross the cold flame field, their destination would be the interior world of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. I don't know what they want you to get for them, but I must remind you to be careful and not push yourself too hard.</p>

  <p>Your safety must always come first."</p>
