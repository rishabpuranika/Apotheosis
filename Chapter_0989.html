<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Four Virtual Tribulation Realm cultivators attacked Zheng at the same time, two of whom were at the middle stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm.</p>

  <p>This was proof of how wary they were of Zheng.</p>

  <p>Back when Zheng was still in the Illuminating Soul Realm, he had already been able to defeat divine-level talents who had reached the Internal Elixir Realm. And now that he had stepped into the Virtual Tribulation Realm, nobody knew exactly how powerful he truly was.</p>

  <p>But they thought that no matter how powerful Zheng was, it would still be difficult for him to fight four Virtual Tribulation Realm warriors at once.</p>

  <p>Morphens's expression changed when he saw the number of enemy warriors attacking Zheng. He took a step forward as his body began to become translucent and was about to use the Mystical Pace to approach and help Zheng when Emanuel thrust his spear at him suddenly, forcing him back.</p>

  <p>Everyone's eyes were focused on Zheng. Tianming, Patrick, and their companions were worried, and it showed on their faces. It didn't matter that Zheng's cultivation base had risen magnificently in the last two years.</p>

  <p>They still thought that he wouldn't be able to fight four Virtual Tribulation Realm experts by himself.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Zheng's eyes glittered with an excited confidence as he was surrounded by the four Virtual Tribulation Realm experts. His body became vague, like a mirage, constantly stretching and moving like a leaf creating ripples on water.</p>

  <p>"Is that an illusion?"</p>

  <p>"Is he using a bodily movement skill?"</p>

  <p>The four Virtual Tribulation Realm cultivators found themselves thinking as they watched Zheng in exasperation.</p>

  <p>But since they had already made their moves and Zheng hadn't dodged them or made a move, how could they let go of this opportunity and not attack him?</p>

  <p>Different kinds of attacks rained down on Zheng in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>However, a strange scene played out before everyone's eyes. It looked like none of those attacks were touching Zheng and he remained completely unharmed.</p>

  <p>It did look like the warriors' swords and sabers were striking or stabbing Zheng's body, but since Zheng's body looked like something that didn't physically exist at the moment, they seemed to slice through thin air.</p>

  <p>Morphens was fighting Emanuel but as he looked over in Zheng's direction, his concern turned to amazement.</p>

  <p>"He's applying Space Law! And it is the Space Law of a higher layer!"</p>

  <p>Morphens exclaimed, immensely surprised. He wondered rather excitedly, 'Where had Zheng been these past two years? How did he achieve this?'</p>

  <p>Emanuel, too, had his attention on the fight between Zheng and the four other warriors. When he saw Zheng's strange bodily movement skill, he was shocked beyond reason.</p>

  <p>"How is this even possible?" Emanuel muttered disbelievingly. A bad premonition presented itself to Emanuel, telling him that he had probably underestimated Zheng's strength yet again.</p>

  <p>It felt like deja vu, because he had experienced this exact same feeling the very first time he had seen Zheng.</p>

  <p>At first, Emanuel had thought that Zheng was just a lucky fellow who had ascended from the Cloud Sect. He had almost killed Zheng when they had come face to face at the close of the Cloud Road.</p>

  <p>But never had he thought that Yudie would stop him and that she would go on and demand him to scram.</p>

  <p>At the time, Emanuel had set out to kill Zheng but had never gotten the chance. After that, Zheng had quickly risen up to become a martial arts star in the Central Region. His cultivation base had improved at an astonishing speed that was far beyond Emanuel's imagination. Emanuel had felt greatly threatened once Zheng had reached the Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>Because of that exact same reason, Emanuel had rejoiced when Zheng had disappeared. The past two years were bliss for him, but he had never expected Zheng to come back suddenly, as a Virtual Tribulation Realm cultivator and with obvious improvements in all aspects. Emanuel was beginning to wonder if he could still beat Zheng.</p>

  <p>And his mind was throwing up nothing but doubts. It took him a while before the answer became crystal clear to him.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>Zheng had thrown out four punches in quick succession, felling the four Virtual Tribulation Realm warriors who'd been fighting with him.</p>

  <p>The warriors became powerless against Zheng, falling to the ground, moaning, and finding it difficult to get back up again. Their ashen faces betrayed the degree to which they had become injured.</p>

  <p>Zheng had still been a war general when he had become able to fight the top-level war lords in the Tower of Sin. Now that he had reached the Virtual Tribulation Realm and had the strength of a war lord, it had become quite easy for him to deal with these warriors, who were at the primary or middle level of the Virtual Tribulation Realm.</p>

  <p>However, these things that were normal for Zheng were obviously abnormal for others.</p>

  <p>Everyone on the platform was stunned into silence. The scene in front of them made them feel that the person they were fighting wasn't a Virtual Tribulation Realm cultivator but a Life and Death Realm expert. Only a Life and Death Realm expert could pulverize those warriors like Zheng just had.</p>

  <p>Tianming smiled faintly as he remarked, "Looks like he's still the same Zheng. He was always much stronger than others on the same level."</p>

  <p>When he had started out in martial arts, Zheng had been able to fight against an Illuminating Soul Realm warrior when he was still at the nature level. Once he stepped into the Illuminating Soul Realm, he had become powerful enough to easily prevail over an Internal Elixir Realm warrior. Usually, the higher one's cultivation base was, the harder it was to maintain an advantage over others of the same level. After all, every warrior who reached the Virtual Tribulation Realm must be the best of all.</p>

  <p>This was exactly why Tianming, Patrick, and Morphens had been so worried about Zheng.</p>

  <p>They now understood that Zheng still maintained this massive advantage in his fighting abilities. Considering his previous performances, they knew that Zheng was now powerful enough to fight a Life and Death Realm expert.</p>

  <p>Exactly how strong was a Life and Death Realm cultivator? Every cultivator at the Life and Death Realm was the most powerful across the continent. Even Yudie was still trying to break into the Life and Death Realm. Nobody had expected Zheng to possess such terrifying strength, especially after he had disappeared for two whole years.</p>

  <p>Everybody was in awe of his astonishing improvement.</p>

  <p>Emanuel's mind had figured out the answer to his earlier question and it was clear as day now. He now understood that Zheng could absolutely crush him with his current strength.</p>

  <p>His heart sank, just like the other cultivators who had come with him.</p>

  <p>Zheng turned to Emanuel and said coldly, "Stop resisting and you'll be punished less. Or I might have to kill you without mercy."</p>

  <p>Many of the Virtual Tribulation Realm cultivators were stunned. Zheng's display of strength had planted seeds of fear in their hearts and was causing their minds to waver.</p>

  <p>"Even if you give up resisting, he won't let you off that easily!" Emanuel yelled to his warriors, refusing to give up. His words were like a shot of adrenaline to the warriors, who clutched their weapons with renewed vigor at his words. They were carrying out a conspiracy against the sect, and any crime of this sort was basically a capital offense. It was similar to a rebellion in the imperial palace. Anyone planning to subvert the country couldn't expect an atonement after their movement failed.</p>

  <p>Zheng sneered at Emanuel's words and took a step forward, and then another, as he headed straight for Emanuel. He was the source of the chaos, and the event wouldn't end if he didn't die.</p>

  <p>What was happening now was completely different from before. Earlier, Tianming had chosen not to kill Emanuel because even if they had killed him, they wouldn't have been able to change the situation. But now that Zheng had control over the situation, as long as he killed Emanuel, the ringleader of the conspiracy, everyone else would give up resisting.</p>

  <p>Emanuel retreated at full speed as he saw Zheng chasing after him.</p>

  <p>"You want to escape? There's no escape for you today!"</p>

  <p>The Light of Water enveloped Cloud Hall. It was impossible for Emanuel to escape from this enchanted barrier. He had only recently reached the late stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm and his strength was only equivalent to that of a war lord belonging to level eight or nine.</p>

  <p>He was in no way a match for Zheng.</p>

  <p>Emanuel was overcome with regret as Zheng chased him. He had thought that he'd never fail in his plans. But Zheng's appearance had been unexpected and had thrown a spanner in the works.</p>

  <p>As a member of the Cloud Hall, Emanuel was now clear about Zheng's extraordinary talent.</p>

  <p>It wouldn't be long before Zheng would climb to the top of the martial world, and when that day came, no one in the Central Region would be able to match him.</p>

  <p>Emanuel was not God. He had never calculated or even dreamed that Zheng would return at such a crucial moment.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, spare me! Just this once! I will go into hiding and never enter Central Region again!" Emanuel begged for Zheng's mercy as he dodged his attacks.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry but that's not possible. I had already planned to kill you but since you are an elder of the Cloud Hall, I thought it was improper for me to do that. But you forced yourself into this position and now, it's too late for you to beg for mercy," Zheng said coldly as he traveled towards Emanuel, the distance between them decreasing each time he jumped.</p>

  <p>"If you kill me, my Zhuo Family will definitely become an enemy of the Cloud Hall! All the noble clans of Cloudy City will act against Cloud Hall!" Emanuel threatened.</p>

  <p>"You think all the noble clans in the Cloudy City will follow your Zhuo Family that's just a third-grade clan? In your dreams, perhaps!" Zheng retorted. He was now only ten feet away from Emanuel.</p>

  <p>"Then go to hell!" Now that he knew he couldn't escape, Emanuel suddenly turned around and pulled out a black spear from his space ring.</p>

  <p>He stabbed it at Zheng as he yelled, "Sun Extinguishing Spear!"</p>

  <p>The moment he thrust the spear, the tip began to glow so brightly that it felt like it could take away the radiance of the sun and the moon. Being an elder of the Cloud Hall meant that Emanuel was undoubtedly strong.</p>

  <p>But Zheng didn't even budge at Emanuel's full-blown attack. Instead, he sneered as he grabbed the tip of his spear with his bare hands. With just a push, Emanuel's top-grade fairy weapon bent and began to crack into pieces, an ode to Zheng's great strength.</p>

  <p>This was the last straw for Emanuel, his heart sinking into a bottomless abyss. The difference in his and Zheng's strengths was much greater than he had imagined.</p>
