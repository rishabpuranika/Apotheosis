<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 893 A Delicate Situation (Part Two) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>After Luo Zheng and Maurice's negotiations, many of the tenth-level war generals had volunteered to kill Luo Zheng on the arena. However, they had stopped trying to do that in the end.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was a bit puzzled at first. Considering the nature of the ogres, it was highly improbable that they could refrain from challenging him on the arena. Since they were unable to kill him outside in the safe zone, it was a pretty safe bet that this impetuous race would try to deal with him legally.</p>

  <p>In any case, he managed to land a default victory for the next several days and had no choice but to advance to the next floor.</p>

  <p>However, when he saw these two ogre war lords, Luo Zheng understood that everyone on the tenth floor understood that it was very difficult for them to kill him, so they decided not to challenge him here and force him to advance so that more powerful warriors could deal with him on the arena.</p>

  <p>There were fewer war generals on the eleventh floor and above. The vast majority of divine-level talents would stay on the tenth floor. Even if they had the qualifications to enter the eleventh floor, they still preferred to stay on since it allowed them to procure adequate amounts of Lucky Light and training. Only after breaking through and becoming powerful war lords, did they choose to enter the eleventh floor.</p>

  <p>Even if Boris and Cheryl had the ability to fight against level one and level two war lords, they still chose to stay on the tenth floor and continuously absorb Lucky Light. They were bound to break through on the tenth floor eventually and then they would advance to the next floor.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had no choice but to go up to the eleventh floor. In such a situation, the ogre war lords on the eleventh floor could now challenge Luo Zheng and try to kill him.</p>

  <p>It was because of Luo Zheng that all the ogres in the Tower of Sin, including the top-level ogre war lords, had been forced into a passive state. Even the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place were inactive these days, afraid that Luo Zheng would do something terrible to them.</p>

  <p>For the ogres, anyone who managed to get rid of Luo Zheng was going to be their savior.</p>

  <p>As a result, as soon as Luo Zheng entered the eleventh floor, two ogre war lords appeared, trying to be the savior of their race.</p>

  <p>In the face of the provocation from these two ogre war lords, Luo Zheng merely gave a faint smile, and his eyes narrowed slightly. "I accept your challenge, but you must prepare yourself to give up your lives!"</p>

  <p>"There is not a single ogre anywhere in the world who is afraid of death!</p>

  <p>What's more, you're just a second-level war general," an ogre war lord sneered.</p>

  <p>The other ogre war lord also gave a wild laugh and sneered, "That's right.</p>

  <p>As long as you don't use your bullshit ability, you're a dead man walking!</p>

  <p>Ha-ha..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng gently raised his hand and responded, "Are you talking about this ability?"</p>

  <p>As an intangible force wrapped the ogre war lord up, his expressions suddenly changed, the laughter morphing into an ugly, choked expression.</p>

  <p>Although news concerning the death of the top-level ogre war lord, Bradley, had not spread outside, the ogres themselves knew very clearly about it.</p>

  <p>Even if Zheng's finger moved very slightly, the war lord would be torn in half!</p>

  <p>"According to the rules of the Tower of Sin, you are not allowed to attack in the safe zone!" The ogre war lord panicked as his face turned pale.</p>

  <p>"The safe zone?" Luo Zheng laughed coldly. "The rules of the safe zone were set by those who hold the seats in the Tower of Sin, but I think it won't be long before the rules become invalid!"</p>

  <p>"All the races set these rules together. It wasn't just us. Aghhh!" the ogre war lord immediately replied, gagging for breath.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes were gleaming with contempt. With a slight movement of his finger, the ogre war lord fell to the ground with a thud. Luo Zheng then walked towards the arena, and announced as if people around him were his subjects, "I am going to set up some new rules for the Tower of Sin."</p>

  <p>When the creatures of the other races heard this declaration, they began to discuss among themselves.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng is too domineering. He doesn't seem like a human being at all!"</p>

  <p>"What Luo Zheng said isn't wrong. Putting aside his identity of a human, we can even say he is now the person in charge of the Tower of Sin. Who can stand up against him anyway? Who's going to stop him if he really sets some new rules? Esther? Maurice? Perhaps even they would get killed instantly. Luo Zheng could do that in the blink of an eye. This means that Luo Zheng is now the most powerful person in the tower and it won't be wrong for him to draw up the rules!"</p>

  <p>"Whoever is the most influential and has the highest position in the tower has the right to make the rules for the tower. That is the foundation of the Tower of Sin! The Tower of Sin has operated according to this foundation for the past hundreds of years. Isn't that why when the ogres occupied the whole Tower of Sin, no one dared to question or challenge them?"</p>

  <p>As the crowd continued with their discussions, Luo Zheng walked into the arena and pointed at the two ogre war lords. "There are still fifteen days left for the ogres. In these fifteen days, I will also give you the opportunity to challenge me!"</p>

  <p>"I'm going to kill him!" The ogre war lord who had gotten up from the ground had a furious expression on his face. As he finished speaking, he rushed towards the arena.</p>

  <p>For the ogres, there were only two options left. They could either attack and destroy the Purple Heart Sacred Place within the next fifteen days or kill Luo Zheng inside the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, it was inevitable that all the ogres got expelled from the Tower of Sin. This was going to be the greatest disgrace and humiliation they would face ever since the establishment of the two ogre sacred places.</p>
