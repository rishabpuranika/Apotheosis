<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1682 Gods Killing Sword Array </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Nathan had earned a very good reputation among the human forces.</p>

  <p>He had survived a lot of terrible and miraculous experiences since his youth, and he had also relied on his own talent to gain recognition by the Xuanyuan Clan. Thanks to his consistently excellent efforts and persistence, he had reached great achievements and finally enjoyed the fruits of his labor by becoming a Godly Genius.</p>

  <p>However, he had lived a solitary life all this time, without any woman to win his heart.</p>

  <p>There were many beautiful women who had been willing, even keen, to marry him, but his focus was only on the martial arts, and he did not even spare a moment to glance at any woman.</p>

  <p>However, when he suddenly expressed his love for Mu Ning in front of all the warriors in the universe, his words caused an uproar of note among the crowd.</p>

  <p>After the scene unfolded before everyone's eyes, Mu Ning and Luo Zheng stayed beside each other, with a stone between them. They didn't seem to have any intimate behavior.</p>

  <p>However, those warriors who were there at the scene saw that Mu Ning and Luo Zheng often snuggled up to each other. It was obvious that they were a couple.</p>

  <p>The warriors who had been eliminated, and even those who had not been eliminated yet, were all stunned upon hearing Nathan say that he wanted Mu Ning to be his woman. They all thought that Nathan was too daring to say those words in front of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Although Nathan's speculation had made sense, Mu Ning was still Zheng's woman. Anyway, it was not appropriate for him to offer those remarks.</p>

  <p>Besides, apart from Mu Ning, there were still many outstanding women who could be a perfect match for him. There was no need to be desperate. Given Nathan's high status, it was easy for him to have thirty thousand or even three hundred thousand women to accompany him...</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha... Nathan really has a special taste in women," Lawson said to Lucille with a wry smile. His voice sounded rather unpleasant.</p>

  <p>He and Lucille knew Nathan very well. Nathan had never been in a relationship before, and it seemed as if it was hard for him to trust just any woman. However, today his reckless behavior confused Lawson.</p>

  <p>Lucille frowned slightly. Nathan seemed to say those words with an earnest intent to try and persuade Mu Ning to be with him, by taking advantage of their destiny. However, even if his speculations were true, Mu Ning was already Zheng's woman, and he would not have a chance to start a love relationship with her. So he should not have said those words.</p>

  <p>After hearing Nathan's love confession, Mu Ning rudely stated that he was crazy and ignored him. Then she stepped onto the black stone.</p>

  <p>"Mu Ning, please, wait a moment," Nathan rapidly took a step and reached her in an instant, seemingly intent on stopping her.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Mu Ning suddenly wheeled about, and her long hair spiraled upwards as four sword shadows shot out all of a sudden.</p>

  <p>"Swish, swish, swish, swish..."</p>

  <p>The four sword shadows were illusory, so they were not real swords.</p>

  <p>Although they were just virtual shadow swords, there was an extremely fierce intent contained within them.</p>

  <p>Long Vine Sword, Buddha Emperor Sword, Grant Sun Sword, Heavenly Tooth Sword...</p>

  <p>The four swords could create the most formidable array— the Gods Killing Sword Array!</p>

  <p>The four swords didn't exist in the current round of heavens. When Mu Ning cultivated, she had relied on the Purple Power World's secret treasure— the Array Tablet to master this array.</p>

  <p>When the four swords appeared, they etched many small lines in the air below her. These lines were sharp edged and stiff, not soft at all. Only the killing array would make such lines.</p>

  <p>After a sword array was arranged, there would always be a way to break free and escape it; while, for some sword arrays, there was more than one way to get rid of them.</p>

  <p>Therefore, when many warriors chanced upon the sword arrays, they all tried to figure out the weakest points of the arrays to find a way out.</p>

  <p>Those warriors who created the sword arrays didn't like to leave any escape routes for the warriors to break free of them. After all, with more ways to break the sword array, more weak points could be found in the array. But if they wanted their sword arrays to be successful, they had to embed the path of reincarnation within the arrays. It could be said that they had no choice but to do that.</p>

  <p>For example, as with Margaret's Purple River Sword Array, there was also a way to escape it. However, the Purple River Sword Array's attacks were as dense as rain and hid the escape path very well, so it was very difficult for ordinary warriors to escape its deadly attack.</p>

  <p>But there was no any way out from the Gods Killing Sword Array, and this was the reason why it was called the killing array and had become the most formidable array in existence.</p>

  <p>When they saw the Gods Killing Sword Array, many Supreme Lords were shocked.</p>

  <p>"Why is there such a warrior existing in the Purple Power World?"</p>

  <p>"She has the first rank Purple Power Body... It is very lucky for Elder Apeiron to have found such a warrior!"</p>

  <p>"No wonder that this woman was given a chance to compete here..."</p>

  <p>The Purple Power World was not a very powerful world in the scope of the universe.</p>

  <p>The members of this world were all women; hence, it had a small population. Moreover, its warriors had no intention of dominating the universe, so many forces of the universe seldom paid attention to the Purple Power World.</p>

  <p>But it didn't mean that the other worlds could ignore the Purple Power World.</p>

  <p>After all, there was the inheritance from the True God in the Purple Power World. However, this inheritance could only be attained by those who had the Purple Power Bodies. The ordinary warriors were thus unable to claim it. Therefore the value of that inheritance was not fully known.</p>

  <p>The Gods Killing Sword Array's powerful force was not just limited to the universe, and it was also the most effective in the whole divine land.</p>

  <p>As the four swords shot out and formed the sword array, Nathan's eyes sparkled with surprise.</p>

  <p>"Swoosh!"</p>

  <p>Sensing the crisis, Nathan instantly backed away.</p>

  <p>It was a choice not to be trapped in the deadly crisis created by the powerful array.</p>

  <p>Nathan, the most remarkable Godly Genius, was more sensitive about the potential crisis than most.</p>

  <p>Because of his sensitivity, he could feel the terrible strength and intent of the sword array.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, Nathan moved about one thousand feet away. At the same time, he prepared himself to battle. There was a blood-red gleam in his eyes.</p>

  <p>After entering the Illusion Battlefield, Nathan had never fought with great seriousness against the other warriors.</p>

  <p>He had been defeated only once, by Lawson, just because he was tricked by Lawson and as a result the heavens killed him. At that time, he didn't have the chance to display his actual strength. Or rather, he was unwilling to show his strength at all.</p>

  <p>However, when Mu Ning suddenly created a part of the Gods Killing Sword Array, Nathan became fully vigilant.</p>

  <p>The Godly Geniuses on the stones all remained silent at the sight of the sword array.</p>

  <p>The strength that Mu Ning displayed before had not been that powerful.</p>

  <p>The Purple River Sword Array was of course quite impressive, but in the eyes of the Godly Geniuses, it was nothing, and barely worth mentioning.</p>

  <p>So they didn't take Mu Ning seriously or see her as a powerful opponent.</p>

  <p>In fact, they didn't think highly of Luo Zheng either.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng had once defeated Cindy; her Dream Godly Way was not that remarkable. If her opponent couldn't find out what the pivotal item of the dream was and break it, she was invincible; but, if her opponent found it out, she would be defeated in an instant. Even though Luo Zheng had triumphed over her; truthfully, he had not relied on his strength. Besides, his strength might even be as powerful as that of the top ace talents, but he was still greatly inferior to the Godly Geniuses.</p>

  <p>Now, with Margaret's unexpected display of the Gods Killing Sword Array, everyone was astonished by her.</p>

  <p>The killing intent from the Gods Killing Sword Array was indeed formidable, and it could even be regarded as having its own internal momentum. Could it be that Mu Ning had also managed to activate her Mahayana Lotus Flower? Was she secretly also a Godly Genius?</p>

  <p>With four virtual swords floating around her, Mu Ning glanced at Nathan who was not far away from her, and hissed, "Don't get close to me!"</p>

  <p>Then she gently leaped from her own stone and chose to admit defeat.</p>

  <p>In this round of the battle, Mu Ning lost, by choice.</p>

  <p>Nathan stood still, favoring an embarrassed expression on his face.</p>

  <p>At the beginning, he had been so confident and brave to tell others about the destiny he had deduced. But now, he had been scared by the sword array and had backed away, which placed him in an awkward situation.</p>

  <p>He was, after all, the number one Godly Genius!</p>

  <p>Being the most outstanding warrior among his peers, he had never been afraid of anyone or anything before.</p>

  <p>But the killing intent releasing from the sword array moments ago was indeed too terrible to behold. Even when he thought of it now, he still believed that it was the correct choice for him to retreat at the time.</p>

  <p>Nathan might not have been able to break the sword array, and he still thought that if he had been trapped in it, he would surely have been killed.</p>

  <p>When thinking of Mu Ning, he believed that his earlier speculation was proven correct.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning was the only one who could be a perfect match for him, but she just didn't believe that, yet...</p>

  <p>Right at this moment, he raised his head slightly and saw someone on a stone not far away staring at him. That warrior was none other than Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng just looked at him with an extremely calm and meaningful gaze.</p>

  <p>They didn't say anything to each other, but then Nathan returned to his own stone after he gave a brief snort.</p>
