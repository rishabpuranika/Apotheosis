<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Since the Shape-shifting Spirit felt that there was no room for it to bargain, it just told everything it knew.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, the Element Spirit race especially liked to take the Shape-shifting Spirits as their pets.</p>

  <p>It was mainly because the Element Spirit race did not have a stable form.</p>

  <p>In fact, as one of the powerful civilizations, it was easy for the Element Spirit race to shape themselves into any form they wanted.</p>

  <p>When a civilization was born and developed, however, their own consciousness could not change. Therefore, they stubbornly maintained their original state while they admired the wonderful forms of civilizations after them.</p>

  <p>Overall, the entire race had the hobby of collecting pets and imprisoning slaves.</p>

  <p>As it happened, the extremely powerful elites of the Element Spirit race were qualified to detain beings from any race as slaves and pets.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, not all the members of the Element Spirit race on the Other Shore were considered as powerful, and some weak ones couldn't collect enough slaves to entertain themselves.</p>

  <p>So, the easiest method available to them was to raise Shape-shifting Spirits.</p>

  <p>After the Shape-shifting Spirits were trained, they could be transformed into almost anything that the Element Spirit race needed.</p>

  <p>"Before I was sold to my master, I was locked up in a temple in Stage Twenty-five of the Other Shore like other Shape-shifting Spirits. There were many beings from civilized races held inside the temple, including two humans--a man and a woman," the Shape-shifting Spirit said.</p>

  <p>Basically, the Shape-shifting Spirits were treated like a kind of commodity, as the Element Spirit race traded them. To become a qualified "commodity", the Shape-shifting Spirits must first learn to change themselves into many forms before they could become useful to their future masters.</p>

  <p>Thus, the purpose of the many living creatures held in the temple was to serve as a guide for them to imitate. "Stage Twenty-five of the Other Shore?" Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"It's the Long Night Stage," Elvinia said.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded in response. The Long Night Stage was still within the Desire World, which meant that there were humans in the Desire World.</p>

  <p>"How long ago was the time when you were kept in the temple and met those human beings?" he asked again. If it was during the current chaotic era, then the news would be of low value.</p>

  <p>Human beings had set foot on the Other Shore since the ancient times, in the form of physical body.</p>

  <p>At that time, the Element Spirit race could easily capture even members of the Nine Li race. It wasn't even a big deal for them to catch the humans from the Pear Hill, but those races didn't have much to do with the human race of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>"I don't remember. There should be at least ten chaotic eras ago..." answered the Shape-shifting Spirit. Ten chaotic eras...</p>

  <p>If that was the case, then the humans the Shape-shifting Spirit had met in the temple had nothing to do with the humans born in the present era.</p>

  <p>It was safe to say that they were definitely the humans from the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>"What is the name of the temple?" Zheng asked once more. "It's a temple of the Element Spirit race, built by the fire branch of the race.</p>

  <p>It's called the Dark Fire Temple," said the Shape-shifting Spirit.</p>

  <p>Zheng kept the information in mind, then turned to climb the metal staircase.</p>

  <p>Elvinia silently followed him.</p>

  <p>When they reached the top of the iron house, their calm demeanor simultaneously changed into surprised looks.</p>

  <p>The upper floor of the iron house was a completely different world compared to the desolate lower floor!</p>

  <p>Not far away from the stairway entrance was a large tank. Although it was tightly shut, they clearly felt a surge of strong power from it despite the distance. The power felt really pure, without anything messy mixed in.</p>

  <p>Zheng and Elvinia looked at each other and exclaimed, "The soul crystal!"</p>

  <p>It wasn't long before Zheng strode towards the tank and opened the lid.</p>

  <p>His eyes glittered at the sight. The pure soul crystal filled up the large tank!</p>

  <p>"Oh, my God! There's so much of it!"</p>

  <p>Even though Elvinia was good at hiding her emotions, she couldn't help crying out in excitement as well when she saw the huge amount of soul crystal.</p>

  <p>Of course, Zheng was also thrilled.</p>

  <p>According to the Shape-shifting Spirit, those who kept Shape-shifting Spirits as pets had relatively low status in the whole Element Spirit race.</p>

  <p>Thus, how could a guardian of such a low position get so much soul crystal?</p>

  <p>While Elvinia was still in shock over the soul crystal, Zheng had already calmed down and walked into the room.</p>

  <p>There was an iron table beside the large tank, and a row of Sanskrit words were engraved on both of its sides.</p>

  <p>Quite different from the previous dreary Sanskrit words, these Sanskrit words continuously emitted red light.</p>

  <p>In the middle of the two rows of Sanskrit words was a sunken place, inlaid with a strangely shaped metal token.</p>

  <p>Zheng tried to pull out the metal token, but it didn't move at all when he used a bit of strength. He then continued to increase his strength, but it seemed that the metal token was merged with the metal table. He absolutely couldn't pull it out.</p>

  <p>After he thought for a while, he ended up turning to Geoffrey for help again.</p>

  <p>In only a short time, Geoffrey had figured it out and told Zheng what to do through the Regal Jade Spirit. It turned out that there were two ways to use the Sanskrit words. One was to take the metal token out, and the other was to turn it on.</p>

  <p>"Taking it out is easy to understand, but what does it mean to turn it on?"</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, he followed Geoffrey's instructions and pressed the Sanskrit words. When the two rows of the red Sanskrit words shone with a green light, he was able to take out the token from the iron table easily.</p>

  <p>Out of curiosity, he inserted the metal token back into the iron table and pressed the Sanskrit words in another order.</p>

  <p>This time, instead of green light, a colorful beam of light came out of the Sanskrit words--and it was the same color as the energy vortex outside!</p>

  <p>Now, another interesting thing was happening at the same time as well.</p>

  <p>There was a colorful wave of light that began to glow in the middle of the room in the upper floor. Soon enough, a small energy vortex appeared in front of Zheng and Elvinia.</p>

  <p>"This energy vortex..." Elvinia muttered.</p>

  <p>She couldn't help but be surprised once again.</p>

  <p>"Don't be afraid, it's just a phantom," Zheng assured her. This energy vortex had no energy at all, or at least Zheng could not feel any from it.</p>

  <p>Although it was a phantom, the energy vortex in front of them should be in harmony with the large vortex outside. Now, both ends of the channel were closed, just like what Zheng and Elvinia had encountered outside.</p>

  <p>"The guard..."</p>

  <p>"Turning it on..."</p>

  <p>"Control it..."</p>

  <p>The information from the Shape-shifting Spirit and Geoffrey filled Zheng's mind and kept him thinking. A thought flashed in his brain, then he stretched his hand towards the vortex. The area he touched was soft as cotton.</p>

  <p>Just as he was about to pull it, the center of the small vortex twisted.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the center of the energy vortex outside began to twist from the middle.</p>

  <p>He thought more for a while, before he stretched his hands towards both ends of the small and long vortex, then curled it up.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace, who were still waiting on the stone platform of the Desire World, screamed.</p>

  <p>"The energy vortex has changed again!"</p>

  <p>"The passageway is not only closed, it is also completely rolled up. What happened?"</p>

  <p>"Isn't it still changing its shape? The energy vortex has turned into the shape of a human, right? Is it some trick of the eye?"</p>

  <p>The disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace could not understand what was happening.</p>

  <p>Even Dorothy also stared blankly at the energy vortex. She was confident that Zheng was still alive, but she was still worried because Zheng hadn't reached the Desire World by now. It meant that he was still trapped.</p>

  <p>Was the change in the energy vortex related to anything that might be happening to Zheng?</p>
