<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>A body that was almost perfect from head to toe slowly emerged from inside the wall of flames. It was no other than Claire.</p>

  <p>At the same time as her appearance, a white dragon rolled and swam in the wall of flames at an incredible speed.</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...</p>

  <p>The white dragon swiftly moved in a few circles, and then it entered Claire's body.</p>

  <p>This white dragon was also a resentment-level Treacherous Being, which was known for its incredible speed.</p>

  <p>Together with her destructive power, she and the white dragon combined increased her strength by more than two times.</p>

  <p>"I don't know how you found that there are two paths to the Treasure Bottle Platform, but here..." She gestured for them to stop then said, "No pass."</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Holy Wings Armor and the Eye Spirit, who had turned into a giant cat, also charged forward.</p>

  <p>Although there were only a few people of the Element Spirit Civilization present, it didn't mean that they were at a disadvantage.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, they would surely win if they successfully delayed the battle and waited until the warriors of the Black House and General Gianni came.</p>

  <p>If that did happen, it would push the five members of the Nihility race into a desperate situation. However, the Grandmaster of Heaven, Ewing, Phelps, and the others did not look panicked at all.</p>

  <p>"Hand over the Godly Way energy, and I will leave your corpses intact," the Eye Spirit's voice sounded from the giant cat. The giant cat's eyes kept blinking calmly at them.</p>

  <p>The Eye Spirit and the Grandmaster of Heaven had fought with each other for a long time now.</p>

  <p>The Eye Spirit had once suffered a big loss from a fight with the Grandmaster of Heaven, but he later triumphed against the latter. This time, he was determined to deal a heavy blow to the Nihility race.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven could still be revived if he died, but the other warriors that followed him could not.</p>

  <p>If they won this battle, it would be a great blow to the warriors from other races that followed the Nihility race.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha!" Ewing laughed manically.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha!"</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha!"</p>

  <p>Phelps and the others burst into laughter as well, and it was a laughter of victory after they succeeded in fooling their opponents.</p>

  <p>Then, all of their figures became dimmer and dimmer, until they finally became illusions.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the Grandmaster of Heaven's body began to curl up and turn into a mass of white objects. It turned out to be a Treacherous Being in the shape of a starfish, with dreamy-colored tentacles.</p>

  <p>Afterward, the group of people disappeared.</p>

  <p>"Illusory Star!"</p>

  <p>Claire hissed with heavily furrowed brows.</p>

  <p>After she had transformed into a human, she had always adjusted her appearance. Now that she looked almost perfect, her every move and even just her smile was breathtaking.</p>

  <p>"Master Eye Spirit, did you not you see through the illusion created by the Illusory Star with your thousand eyes?" asked Gavyn in the Holy Wings Armor.</p>

  <p>He made sure to say his words in a disappointed tone.</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, all of the giant cat's eyes turned and stared at the Holy Wings Armor. It was the Eye Spirit who gazed at him.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Claire glanced at Gavyn and said nothing.</p>

  <p>Even though Gavyn hid inside the Holy Wings Armor, he still felt a chill run down his spine. He did not doubt that the Eye Spirit would kill him at this moment.</p>

  <p>After a while, the Eye Spirit began to speak.</p>

  <p>"You have good control of the Holy Wings Armor. From now on, you will have power over this armor," he said in a cold voice.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Master Eye Spirit!" Gavyn answered excitedly.</p>

  <p>In the Myriad Pagoda Mountains.</p>

  <p>Under the Primeval Lord of Heaven's guidance, Zheng returned to the northwest and found the first copper pagoda mountain.</p>

  <p>Previously, Campbell had controlled Zheng to push down the pagoda mountain. As a result, the soil on the pagoda mountain's surface fell off and revealed the round, red copper disk inside.</p>

  <p>Then, Zheng went to the back of the copper pagoda mountain and punched the round red copper disk.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack...</p>

  <p>The first pagoda mountain began to tilt.</p>

  <p>After that, he punched several times more in a row. When the pagoda mountain collapsed entirely, he then moved towards the second pagoda mountain.</p>

  <p>He had pushed down the second and third pagoda mountains before.</p>

  <p>However, the fourth pagoda mountain began to change.</p>

  <p>When Campbell saw the route Zheng had chosen, he felt a little surprised at first. Later on, Zheng explained the reason to him, and he didn't say anything.</p>

  <p>As a world builder, he naturally knew about the various changes in the Myriad Pagoda Mountains.</p>

  <p>Since Zheng knew the path he wanted to open up, he would let Zheng do it on his own.</p>

  <p>According to the Primeval Lord of Heaven's instructions, Zheng toppled down the last pagoda mountain after a short while. With a series of mechanical sounds, the underground started to rumble, and the vibration spread to the distance.</p>

  <p>"It really opened!" the Snake Goddess exclaimed joyfully.</p>

  <p>"Where is the entrance?" asked Fuxi.</p>

  <p>"In the north. There is a small wasteland behind the Myriad Pagoda Mountains, and there is a cave-dwelling under the wasteland," Zheng said as he pointed ahead.</p>

  <p>But of course, he had never been to that cave-dwelling before. It was the Primeval Lord of Heaven who provided the information about its exact location.</p>

  <p>"Then let's go!" Fuxi declared.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh…"</p>

  <p>Without much pause, they flew towards the north of the Myriad Pagoda Mountains.</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng had said, there was a barren land on the north of the Myriad Pagoda Mountains. At a glance, the land looked like it was covered in rubble. The scenery never changed even as they traveled ten miles, fifty miles, or even a hundred miles.</p>

  <p>When they had covered two hundred miles, Zheng suddenly stopped and quickly moved about four miles to the west, then landed on the ground.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and the other Eternal Realm warriors rushed over as well, and they also saw something strange.</p>

  <p>A faint crack spread from the direction of the Myriad Pagoda Mountains. It was like a grass snake or a grey thread that continuously appeared and disappeared, also fluctuated.</p>

  <p>However, when it reached Zheng's feet, it turned into a circular shape.</p>

  <p>"Is this the place?" the Snake Goddess asked.</p>

  <p>"We'll know after I give it a try!" Zheng announced.</p>

  <p>Then, he nodded and raised his fist to hit the ground.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>The ground shattered and collapsed.</p>

  <p>Below the rubble, a large hollow cave appeared.</p>

  <p>He stood at the bottom of the cave and saw a big cave-dwelling at its side.</p>

  <p>"You found it! This was the cave-dwelling I've been to before. It's still here as I expected!" the Primeval Lord of Heaven said a bit excitedly from Zheng's inner world.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Zheng looked up and shouted, "Everyone, you can come down now. This is the cave-dwelling we're looking for!"</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh...</p>

  <p>Everyone else followed suit and descended to the bottom of the cave. At the same time, the Snake Goddess asked, "Zheng, you have the human civilization's Civilization Artifact. If those human heroes are in the cave-dwelling, you should be able to communicate with them and sense their location, right?"</p>

  <p>At the Snake Goddess's reminder, Zheng immediately understood what he should do.</p>

  <p>Back then, he had sensed the Wing King's position through the Civilization Artifact of the Regal Jade Civilization. If those human heroes were in the cave-dwelling, the Civilization Artifact of human civilization should be able to sense them.</p>

  <p>"Primeval Lord of Heaven..." Just as he was about to speak, the Primeval Lord of Heaven cut him off.</p>

  <p>"No, they are not there. I've just used the Civilization Artifact to try to find them..." he immediately answered.</p>

  <p>It was the Primeval Lord of Heaven's energy soul that controlled the Civilization Artifact, so he knew better what the Civilization Artifact could do.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, when he had flown into this area, he had tried to communicate with the human heroes, but no one answered from the cave-dwelling.</p>

  <p>"A long time has passed, and some things have definitely changed..." Zheng muttered.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven nodded in agreement. "Maybe they have found a way to go to the Jade Pure Realm in the cave-dwelling," he said.</p>

  <p>In the end, Zheng just told the Snake Goddess and the others about the disappointing result then everyone headed towards the depths of the cave-dwelling.</p>

  <p>The space inside the cave-dwelling was a bit spacious, and natural stone pillars scattered everywhere to support it. Just as everyone moved forward a bit, they heard the sounds of stones rolling down from both sides of the cave.</p>
