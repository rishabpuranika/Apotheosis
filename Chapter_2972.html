  <p>
</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!</p>

  <p>The people on the Trumpet Flying Ship transformed into nothing more than bright flashes of light, flying off toward the Wild Goose Pass.</p>

  <p>When they came into Sanjay's view, a cold smile appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>Taking a step forward in the air, he once again turned into a thin, white thread and his moving speed increased sharply. In the blink of an eye, he caught up with a woman from the Snake Goddess race. More specifically, the woman was Betty who taught Zheng the method to build a Rebirth Land.</p>

  <p>"Where did you even get this Trumpet Flying Ship?" Sanjay, who followed Betty closely, asked flatly, without the slightest killing intent in his voice.</p>

  <p>Despite his monotonous voice, Betty said nothing and chose to ignore his question instead.</p>

  <p>She was very well aware that the man in white was chasing after her; her face was full-blown proof of her panic. With no other choice, she sped up and flew at her highest speed.</p>

  <p>No matter how fast she flew though, getting rid of the man in white trailing behind her seemed completely impossible.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you want to answer my question?" Sanjay prompted gently. He raised his eyebrows slightly and lifted the broad sword in his hand imperceptibly. A split moment later, he had reached Betty's side.</p>

  <p>The broad sword gently swept over her body, and just like the Trumpet Flying Ship, she was swallowed up by the sword light only to disappear without a trace!</p>

  <p>"You've only got one chance. If you won't give me an answer, then go to hell!"</p>

  <p>After he had killed Betty with a single swing of his sword, Sanjay adjusted his direction slightly and caught up with another woman from the Snake Goddess race.</p>

  <p>The woman had seen Betty be killed off so easily like that. She grieved, and her face was in despair.</p>

  <p>"Tell me, who the hell did you steal this Trumpet Flying Ship from?"</p>

  <p>Sanjay's voice was heard once again.</p>

  <p>The woman screamed in terror and turned around briskly. An extremely strong energy spread out from her cinnabar field and a black, stringy spider web shot towards Sanjay at full speed.</p>

  <p>The spider web was actually highly toxic and it reeked of a strong, unpleasant stench.</p>

  <p>She had intended to risk her life. For this reason, she suddenly paused and launched a second, even more violent attack. She was relentless, and as Sanjay matched her speed, he was unexpectedly covered by the spider web!</p>

  <p>"Do you really want to know? Ha-ha! Then first, you should come to that world along with me!"</p>

  <p>As soon as she finished speaking, the black spider web began to burn in a violent manner.</p>

  <p>This specific spider web was actually the woman's Other Shore Token. It was extremely poisonous, and even an ordinary Other Shore Realm warrior would definitely die if they were to get caught in it. What was more, as she burned the Other Shore Token, its power had increased by several times!</p>

  <p>Sizz! Sizz!</p>

  <p>The spider web was suddenly shrouded by black smoke, leaving black traces of soot and ash on Sanjay's body.</p>

  <p>"Bertha..."</p>

  <p>When Emily, who was flying forward, noticed this scene below her, her eyes turned red and she looked overwhelmingly sad.</p>

  <p>For many years in the past, they had stayed in the bone tower together and they had grown in a way that allowed them to treat each other as sisters.</p>

  <p>Moments before though, Betty had been killed by the man in white, and Bertha had burned her Other Shore Token. She was doomed to die, and she was certainly bound to endure more intense pain!</p>

  <p>If they were anywhere else than here, Emily would have rushed up and tried her best to fight the man, without a doubt.</p>

  <p>That said, she had equally promised Zheng that she would protect Yan, before and above anything else. Moreover, there were many members of the Snake Goddess race within her inner world.</p>

  <p>In such a situation, she could do nothing but try to escape...</p>

  <p>"Are you really trying to burn me to death with just a spider web in the third stage of the Other Shore? Ha-ha! Come on!"</p>

  <p>In the spur of the moment, six ghost heads appeared on the surface of Sanjay's broad sword. With the ghost heads howling, the black spider web enveloping Sanjay's body collapsed in an instant. Then, without taking a second glance at Bertha, Sanjay passed right by her and rushed to his next target.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore Token couldn't just stop burning, though. In his eyes, Bertha was already dead to him.</p>

  <p>As the Other Shore Token continued sizzling, her inner world began to catch fire, too. Within seconds, the raging fire had spread throughout her entire inner world and then, moved on to destroying her entire body.</p>

  <p>As this whole process played out, her physical body would become trapped by the Other Shore Token. It was said that its confining power stemmed directly from the truth, and the soul simply couldn't escape it. The pain she suffered before she died was absolutely unbearable, at least to any ordinary person.</p>

  <p>Many of the Other Shore Realm warriors were shocked after they witnessed the miserable situation caused by the burning Other Shore Token. In other words, even if they went all out to fight, they rarely chose to burn the Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>If Sanjay would have just killed Bertha with a single sword strike, then it would have been a relief for her. However, he didn't do that, and instead, she died a death of indescribable pain.</p>

  <p>"After crossing the Wild Goose Pass in front of us, we can use the Grand Teleportation technique. We can run as far as our legs will carry us! And then we can enter the Sweltering Desert. We will meet again in the Excellence City, which is located just north of the desert!" Emily expressed with emotion through her life vitality.</p>

  <p>As long as they rushed into the Wild Goose Pass and employed the Grand Teleportation technique, the man in white wouldn't be capable of catching up with them. They felt like they had good chances.</p>

  <p>Fortunately for them, Bertha chose to sacrifice herself and fought Sanjay for a while, stalling for time. Otherwise, Sanjay, who moved at very high speed, could have caught up with the others and killed at least another four or five people.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Zheng had also activated his internal momentum and cranked it up to the maximum!</p>

  <p>He flapped his thunder wings, and simultaneously, wisps of spiritual wind began to spiral around him whimsically.</p>

  <p>Without thinking twice, Zheng rushed towards the Wild Goose Pass as fast as he possibly could.</p>

  <p>In the center of the Wild Goose Pass was a layer of pale yellow enchanted barrier, which, although it wouldn't block outsiders, could prevent the chaotic energy from entering. When Zheng rushed into the light yellow enchanted barrier, he turned his head and saw Sanjay's broad sword hacking at someone once more.</p>

  <p>Another member of the Snake Goddess race had now been killed by him.</p>

  <p>Zheng stared at Sanjay deeply. It was then that Sanjay raised his head and equally saw Zheng watching him.</p>

  <p>As the only consummate True God among the group of Other Shore Realm warriors, Zheng was very eye-catching and attention-grabbing. When Sanjay noticed Zheng's gaze, his expression filled with surprise.</p>

  <p>The pair looked at each other for a very short period of time. In the blink of an eye, Zheng had already entered the enchanted barrier and disappeared.</p>

  <p>As soon as Zheng made his way into the enchanted barrier, he used the Grand Teleportation technique.</p>

  <p>He didn't know what was waiting for him in the Sweltering Desert, nor what kind of place it could be. In fact, this was Zheng's first time setting foot in the Source World.</p>

  <p>Then Zheng began to travel continuously through the space by means of the Grand Teleportation technique.</p>

  <p>He could cross a distance of several thousand miles every time he moved.</p>

  <p>After moving several hundred times, he finally stopped and took a very well-needed break.</p>

  <p>Although his physical body was strong, he felt extremely tired as he had madly activated the internal momentum in order to escape.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Ultimately, he fell down from his midair hover and smashed into the hot sand, panting.</p>

  <p>After resting for a long time, Zheng slowly got himself up from the sand, and then jumped up to the top of a sand dune. He stared at the grey desert in the distance, but didn't think about how he could eventually leave this location.</p>

  <p>Moments ago, just after he rushed into the Wild Goose Pass, he used the Grand Teleportation technique immediately, not caring about anything.</p>

  <p>Now though, he wondered whether Sanjay could catch up with Emily.</p>

  <p>While he was deep in thought, sand and dust suddenly began flying up in the air in the distance. The seemingly calm desert was now hauntingly terrifying and the rolling sand storm swept towards him.</p>
