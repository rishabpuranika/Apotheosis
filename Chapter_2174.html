<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zane was at a loss for words. Suddenly, a well-built middle-aged man walked to the center of the yard. With a displeased expression, he quickly shouted, "Quiet down!"</p>

  <p>The man's voice was filled with authority as if there was an irresistible force that sealed everyone's mouths. As his voice echoed, the entire Heavenly Han House instantly became abnormally quiet.</p>

  <p>The middle-aged man glared at Zane angrily. Seth, who stood beside the man, shook his head slightly.</p>

  <p>This middle-aged man was called Malloy Han, Seth's uncle.</p>

  <p>Additionally, he was also the leader of the Heavenly Han House, who presided over the entrance exam of the Heavenly Han House.</p>

  <p>When he noticed that the situation didn't look very good, Seth decided to ask Malloy Han out in advance. He didn't want the situation to grow any worse.</p>

  <p>Malloy Han then said, "Only strength matters in the exam of the Heavenly Han House! I believe everyone knows that there have been many Han Clan's disciples who have been eliminated in the past. Guys, I know all of you want to prove the Godly Way and your perseverance is commendable. I feel honored that you choose our Heavenly Han House.</p>

  <p>If someone here proves the Godly Way, they'll be a member of the Han Clan. It would then be possible that they will be selected by the Floating Island and become a disciple of the Holy Emperor."</p>

  <p>His words, combined with the presence hidden in his voice, captivated everyone. A mixture of fear and respect was felt by those who heard him.</p>

  <p>True Gods had always wanted to enter the Floating Islands. Even for a reclusive overlord like Master Evil, he had always hoped to be enrolled by one of the Floating Islands. Nonetheless, it was an unattainable dream for most True Gods.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, what Malloy Han said was not false. The Han Clan had also constantly nurtured their own disciples and talented warriors. The cultivation of those under their care was always supported by the necessary resources and guidance.</p>

  <p>Although the distribution of powers in the divine land was extremely stable and the Han Clan's status was unbreakable, that did not mean that there was no competition amongst the wealthy clans on the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>The Floating Islands' rankings in the Time Sea would change every once in a while. Based on the changes in the rankings, the wealthy clans' prestige and reputation would be affected. On the other hand, the clans' actions would also contribute to their rankings. If a wealthy clan was not replenished with new blood for a long time, its Floating Island's ranking would also continuously drop. What was worse, the clan would gradually lose its discourse power in the Hall of Holy Beings. Its influence would drop along with its ranking.</p>

  <p>The Han Clan also needed to select talented warriors from the thirty-six regions and send the elites among them to their Floating Island. The Holy Emperor would choose the most talented one to be his disciple.</p>

  <p>Only the best ones would have that opportunity.</p>

  <p>Once, Luo Zheng encountered Marko, Mateo, and Pranav in the Evolutionary Universe. Although they were only low-rank True Gods, they were still much stronger than ordinary True Gods.</p>

  <p>Just as Malloy Han finished his remark, a melodious bell chime came from the depths of the Heavenly Han House. It echoed throughout the hall.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>In theory, sound is created by an invisible force and normally speaking, it is not visible to the naked eyes.</p>

  <p>The moment the bell chime rang out, yellow ripples suddenly appeared in the sky. Everyone's eyes were focused on the ripples. The yellow ripples constantly spread in the air, and that was why the melodious bell chime was left in their ears.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>The second and third chimes rang out. The sounds echoed in everyone's ears.</p>

  <p>Malloy Han smiled faintly to the crowd. In an authoritative voice, he said, "The Spiritual Bell has rung. As usual, everyone must throw their White Jade Token high up into the sky and wait for a while. The examination will begin soon after."</p>

  <p>The participants' names were recorded in those White Jade Tokens, and those tokens all had special marks made by the Han Clan, so they couldn't be faked.</p>

  <p>Malloy Han's voice had begun to fade away. Seth, who stood next to Malloy Han, suddenly waved his arm. His White Jade Token shot out from his hand and flew towards the sky above the Heavenly Han House.</p>

  <p>He seemed to have put some sort of strength into the White Jade Token.</p>

  <p>The White Jade Token was enveloped in a layer of green light as it flew straight into the sky. However, it seemed to encounter an invisible huge net. Strong unseen resistance was immediately met by the token. The White Jade Token's momentum rapidly decreased, and eventually, it stopped in the air just like that.</p>

  <p>"This year, Seth Han was the first to make a move. The height of his White Jade Token reached six hundred and seventy feet," a person from the Heavenly Han House announced in a rather formal voice.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng leaned against the wall and stared indifferently at the little white dot in the air. Although he hadn't been in the Six-Burden Divine City for long, he had at least investigated and knew the rules of the test.</p>

  <p>The chance of accomplishment of the examination wasn't equal for the participants. After all, when one hundred thousand people were assessed together, there had to be a sequence. The martial artists at the front naturally held the advantage. As such, every year before the start of the exam, they would throw out White Jade Tokens to determine the order of each proving godly warrior.</p>

  <p>There was an extremely strong restrictive force in the sky above the Heavenly Han House. The higher the White Jade Token went, the stronger the restrictive force became. The only way to go higher was with incredible strength.</p>

  <p>Last year, the highest score that the participants in the Heavenly Han House had achieved was only five hundred and twenty feet. This year, the first participant's result had already surpassed last year's best result.</p>

  <p>The proctors of the exam all had expectant eyes.</p>
