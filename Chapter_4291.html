<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4291 The Final Announcement </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The downgrader was very aggressive. From the moment he had released the needle, he had already planned every step ahead.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, on the other hand, followed a relatively conservative approach. He only fought back at whatever came at him.</p>

  <p>However, the downgrader was able to control the needle, thus he kept the initiative. Besides, he had gained a wealth of experience. He had been in the Deep Space for a long time, so he was much more proficient in the use of all kinds of Extreme Form energies.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha ha-ha... I won't kill you. I'll let you watch as I devour your primitive land..." the Snake Spirit King teased with a smug smile.</p>

  <p>He had a keen awareness of emotions and could sense Luo Zheng's despair.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stopped his counterattacking. It was an exercise in futility to keep killing the Snake Spirit King's avatars in the Burial Land. He could only observe this scene silently.</p>

  <p>The size of each black spiral was comparatively quite small, and the speed of them devouring the primitive land was also limited. However, there were simply too many of them. If this continued, the primitive land wouldn't be able to last for too long...</p>

  <p>On the jadeite platform.</p>

  <p>Everyone swept their eyes over anxiously. They sometimes studied Luo Zheng's real body, while also looking at the fake projection, trying to figure out what had happened.</p>

  <p>Not long after, Luo Zheng's real body finally moved. He gently flicked his finger, and the fake illusion that had been projected onto the jadeite platform disappeared.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, what's going on?" Kincaid was the first to question the events.</p>

  <p>After a moment of silence, Luo Zheng explained, "We're already inside the Burial Land. The Snake Spirit King is maneuvering the Burial Land to devour the outer wall of the primitive land..."</p>

  <p>Although everyone present had been mentally prepared, their faces still darkened after Luo Zheng confirmed their suspicions.</p>

  <p>"Then what can we do?" Ying asked in a low voice.</p>

  <p>This was a situation unlike any they had ever experienced. Even the Snake Goddess, who was extremely intelligent, was at a loss.</p>

  <p>Kincaid questioned, "Hilario, if one world is wrapped up in another world, how will the rules be changed?"</p>

  <p>Although the Bold Conjecture House had performed all sorts of strange experiments, the question Kincaid raised was an unpopular topic that few people would be interested in studying. If one primitive land wrapped up another primitive land, who would then be the real controller?</p>

  <p>Hilario was also stumped by the question. "I haven't conducted any relevant research. I wonder if the other members of the Bold Conjecture House might have some experience. Wait for me. I'll go to the Other Shore..."</p>

  <p>With those words, Hilario returned to the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>After half a minute, a Descending Ring flashed with a golden light.</p>

  <p>However, the one who descended was not Hilario, but a thin human spirit.</p>

  <p>"Greetings, Master Kincaid! I'm Barth from the Bold Conjecture House."</p>

  <p>The human spirit named Barth saluted.</p>

  <p>Kincaid waved away formalities with his hand. "You don't have to be so courteous. Can you answer my question?"</p>

  <p>Barth nodded. "I'm in charge of the research into the secondary worlds.</p>

  <p>I'm an expert in this field, so Master Hilario asked me to descend here.</p>

  <p>Back then..."</p>

  <p>"Get straight to the point!" Kincaid rushed to cut him off from rambling.</p>

  <p>Given the critical situation, Barth was wasting time with nonsense, which left everyone speechless.</p>

  <p>"I once created several primitive lands at the same time, observing as they merged and devoured each other. One of these test cases was similar to what you have encountered? a large primitive land devoured a small primitive land..." Barth continued to unhurriedly explain.</p>

  <p>Kincaid, the Snake Goddess, and the others shared helpless looks on their faces, but they could only let him continue explaining in his meandering way.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, on the other hand, wore a look of concern. "What will happen to me as the controller of the smaller primitive land once it is devoured?"</p>

  <p>"You will not be affected," said Barth with a smile. "Your controlling force and the Snake Spirit King's will become integrated. What's interesting is that as a controller, you can even assert control over the Burial Land in turn. To put it bluntly, you and the Snake Spirit King will fight for control over the whole Burial Land. The winner will take all."</p>

  <p>Hearing this, the Snake Goddess couldn't help but blurt out, "It wouldn't be advantageous for them, right?"</p>

  <p>Barth responded with a smile, "Yes, it's a great disadvantage to them. It's simply stupid to do so. The Snake Spirit King and the downgrader must have never done experiments of this nature. They mistakenly believe that they can control everything by devouring the primitive land, but in fact, the opposite is true..."</p>

  <p>Although this thin man was verbose and rambling on, everyone became more patient to hear what he had to say.</p>

  <p>The situation remained critical, but there was now a chance to fight back.</p>

  <p>It was unclear who would win in the end, anyway.</p>

  <p>However, the primitive land was probably no longer a safe haven, and an unprecedented and fierce war was looming.</p>

  <p>The people on the jadeite platform had already been mentally prepared, but this war involved countless innocent people: the people in the large cities on the Li Shan mountain, the people in the Ruin Graveyard, the people in the divine land, and even the people in various universes who knew nothing about the outside world.</p>

  <p>"I want them to know the truth, so even if they die, they will know the reason..." said Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"What do you plan on doing?" asked Fuxi.</p>

  <p>"Announce it to everyone."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, Luo Zheng tapped his tiptoe on the jadeite platform and launched himself into the air.</p>

  <p>"I'm Luo Zheng, the controller of this primitive land. Whether you hail from the Li Shan mountain, the Ruin Graveyard, the divine land, or the universes, you're all under my protection..."</p>

  <p>While his voice did not have significant penetrating force, Luo Zheng had immediately activated the omniscient power, causing his voice to ring in everyone's ears. It was as if hundreds of trillions of Luo Zhengs were whispering an explanation to countless people.</p>

  <p>"At this moment, the primitive land has encountered a great crisis. A larger world has descended, and the primitive land will fall into turmoil.</p>

  <p>Everyone living within will have no way to escape?</p>

  <p>But I will do my best to protect you all..."</p>

  <p>In the divine land, on the edge of the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>A girl with sad eyes looked up at the sky. She was Yolande.</p>

  <p>She had asked Mike to take back a Heavenly Destiny. Although her cultivation level had returned to that of a world lord for a while, she broke through the shackles and became a True God, finally entering the divine land.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng's voice rang out, she felt as if she was in the Evolutionary Universe once more. At that time, Luo Zheng's voice had often echoed across the universe.</p>

  <p>In the Evolutionary Universe, the Supreme Lord of Original Sin, the Supreme Lord of Oracle, and the other Supreme Lords even thought that Luo Zheng had returned.</p>

  <p>They had been trying to communicate with Luo Zheng through the Roaring Tokens.</p>

  <p>In the Immortal Mansion...</p>

  <p>Inside the Li Shan mountain...</p>

  <p>Humans, nonhumans, and intelligent creatures all experienced different thoughts when they heard Luo Zheng's words.</p>

  <p>Many didn't believe what they heard, while some didn't care, others were sad, and many were crying...</p>

  <p>Whether they were willing or not, they were about to face an inevitable catastrophe.</p>

  <p>Once Luo Zheng returned to the jadeite platform, he began to communicate with the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>After the Heavenly Ring Staff was taken back by Luo Nian, the ancestry-level bloodline took away the spirit in the staff, which was the crystal. The ancestry-level bloodline was trying to find its own memories in it.</p>

  <p>However, the process was not going smoothly. This crystal was in a completely sealed state. The ancestry-level bloodline feared damaging the crystal, so it did not dare to use too much power on the crystal.</p>

  <p>"The outer wall of the primitive land will be broken. No matter what happens, you must return to my body first," said Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The ancestry-level bloodline accepted Luo Zheng's instructions without hesitation.</p>

  <p>The huge blood red sky began to shrink, converging into an extremely thin blood pillar, and then it entered into Luo Zheng's body, taking with the crystal that belonged to the Heavenly Ring Staff.</p>
