<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1549 The Five Elements Divine Dao </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The scene in front of Lucille was totally out of her expectation--she didn't foresee the appearance of a Magnetic Sacred Mountain.</p>

  <p>It wasn't just her. All of the surrounding warriors gasped in shock as well when they saw it.</p>

  <p>"Where did this brat move this mountain from?"</p>

  <p>"Lucille was almost pressed under the mountain! This mountain even destroyed her Earth Element Power..."</p>

  <p>"I can carry an ordinary mountain, but this mountain is especially heavy that it's out of this world!"</p>

  <p>"This mountain has colorful lights and the Mu Ning of the five elements. It seems to be a Magnetic Sacred Mountain!"</p>

  <p>Many warriors also did not expect that Luo Luo Zheng would use such an unreasonable method to break Lucille's Earth Element Power.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Lucille floated in the air and looked down at the Magnetic Sacred Mountain with a shocked but unwavering gaze.</p>

  <p>"This is the Magnetic Sacred Mountain! You have refined it yourself!"</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng just looked at her impassively. Although he had refined this Magnetic Sacred Mountain for a long time, he rarely brought it out to his fights. He also wondered why Lucille was so surprised when she saw him summon the Magnetic Sacred Mountain.</p>

  <p>"Yes, you're right! Why are you so surprised?" Luo Luo Zheng said airily. Back then, Luo Luo Zheng had found the method of refining a Magnetic Sacred Mountain in the Myriad Manifestations of Nature.</p>

  <p>The five elements of the Magnetic Sacred Mountain were mixed, and it couldn't be refined no matter what type of Law Power was used.</p>

  <p>Some warriors in the Upper World had tried to refine ordinary mountains through the Earth Law--but ordinary mountains weren't that hard, so it would be stupid to use them in a battle.</p>

  <p>Besides, a Soul Sea Realm warrior could easily break the earth, and even more an ordinary mountain. Only a sturdy mountain like the Magnetic Sacred Mountain could be used to fight against enemies, but few of people in history had refined it.</p>

  <p>However, the Blood Refinement Technique from the Myriad Manifestations of Nature had a miraculous effect on refining the Magnetic Sacred Mountain.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Luo Zheng owned the Immortal Mansion, he was lucky to find the Blood Refinement Technique in the library. However, he wasn't aware that this technique wasn't passed down in the Upper World.</p>

  <p>Lucille was quite familiar with the Magnetic Sacred Mountain since she had the Five-element Finger Chain, and the combination of the five elements was her cultivation method. The Magnetic Sacred Mountain could evenly combine the laws of the five elements, which made it a wonder of the universe.</p>

  <p>The combination of the five elements was to completely merge the five Original Laws with each other. This was one of the methods to step into the Divine Dao--the Five Elements Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>In this universe, there were several Supreme Lords, several hundred thousand world lords, and numerous martial artists who had surpassed the Soul Sea Realm, the Spirit Supreme Realm and the Spirit Transformation Realm. Yet, only a handful of them had stepped into the Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>All the living beings in the universe were destined to die at some point, including a Supreme Lord. A Supreme Lord's lifespan was around three hundred million years, less than a tenth of the lifespan of a grand era.</p>

  <p>Even if they tried every method imaginable to avoid the advent of the Five Aging Processes, death still awaited them in the end.</p>

  <p>Thus, it could be said that the greatest enemy of all living beings in the universe wasn't their opponents, but themselves. It was time.</p>

  <p>Death will always come to visit in the end. No one can be the exception.</p>

  <p>It was said that "Five Aging Processes" was the name of a sword, which hung over everyone's head. When the time was right, it would take away the lives of many strongmen. It was a sword forged by the heavens, so no one could avoid the power of the sword. It stood at the highest point in the many Laws of Causality in the universe, which meant that it was the supreme rule nobody could ever go against.</p>

  <p id="top_3">There was a small exception to the rule. If warriors could get in the Divine Dao, they could escape the Five Aging Processes, the death sword that hung above their heads, and they could obtain eternal life!</p>

  <p>That was also why the Ji Clan allowed Lucille to cultivate the combination of the five elements. They hoped that if she continued the Five Elements Divine Dao, she would eventually become an existence who surpassed the natural law of the heavens and become a True God.</p>

  <p>Lucille had stepped into the Divine Dao through cultivating the combination of the five elements. If she succeeded in breaking through the Soul Sea Realm, the Spirit Supreme Realm and the Spirit Transformation Realm, she then would be qualified to become a world lord. It would be possible for her to refine a Magnetic Sacred Mountain as well. After refining it, she could draw out the magnetic power from within and continue refining her own five elements.</p>

  <p>In fact, there was already a Magnetic Sacred Mountain reserved for Lucille in the Ji Clan.</p>

  <p>It was also very rare to find a Magnetic Sacred Mountain in the Upper World. The Ji Clan had paid a huge price just to obtain one. However, the price was nothing since Lucille was the ace talent they had!</p>

  <p>The Ji Clan's Magnetic Sacred Mountain was a bit smaller than the one Luo Luo Zheng had summoned. Before Lucille entered the Illusion Battlefield, she had been cultivating inside that mountain.</p>

  <p>With Lucille's current strength, she could destroy a small part of the Magnetic Sacred Mountain with just one palm strike. Other warriors of the Soul Sea Realm would not be able to do that. Even Luo Luo Zheng would not be able to destroy a rock on the Magnetic Sacred Mountain.</p>

  <p>It was because Lucille could split part of the magnetic power in the Magnetic Sacred Mountain and separate the five elements. However, she was far from being qualified to refine a Magnetic Sacred Mountain.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Luo Luo Zheng had never cultivated the combination of the five elements.</p>

  <p>Despite that, he had refined this Magnetic Sacred Mountain.</p>

  <p>How could Lucille stay calm at this?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng could easily control the Magnetic Sacred Mountain whether it was big or small. He had completely refined this mountain!</p>

  <p>Even Ji Clan's patriarch, who had half a step into the Five Elements Divine Dao, most likely wasn't able to refine a Magnetic Sacred Mountain to such an extent.</p>

  <p>However, Lucille could also tell that although Luo Luo Zheng had refined this Magnetic Sacred Mountain, he didn't seem to know how to control the magnetic power inside it. Then again, she didn't expect him to summon the mountain just to throw it at her. Therefore, she didn't know what to say about Luo Zheng's attacks.</p>

  <p>This couldn't be blamed on Luo Luo Zheng, either.</p>

  <p>What Luo Luo Zheng had found written in the Myriad Manifestations of Nature in the library wasn't a type of cultivation method. It detailed how to practice the Blood Refinement Technique, but it did not tell Luo Luo Zheng how to make use of a Magnetic Sacred Mountain. Thus, Luo Luo Zheng had only used the mountain to smash Lucille ever since.</p>

  <p>Although such a method was rather clumsy, its actual power should not be underestimated. Even Lucille was almost hit by the mountain. She would've died had she been pressed under it.</p>

  <p>"You! How did you... What method you used to refine this Magnetic Sacred Mountain?"</p>

  <p>Lucille's heart started to hammer wildly in her chest at Luo Zheng's words.</p>

  <p>She couldn't suppress her excitement at that moment, no matter how cold she was!</p>

  <p>As the ace talent in the Ji Clan, she had to shoulder her whole clan's hopes. It would be of truly great benefit to her combination of the five elements if she could refine the Magnetic Sacred Mountain.</p>

  <p>"Why should I tell you?" Luo Luo Zheng asked with a smile.</p>

  <p>Lucille frowned at this and said, "If you can teach me the method, I'll let you go!"</p>

  <p>"Let me go?" Luo Zheng's lips curved into a scornful grin. "Are you sure you're a match for me?" he added.</p>

  <p>There was no trace of doubt in Luo Zheng's piercing gaze, which slightly shook Lucille. 'This guy... Does he have the confidence to defeat me?'</p>

  <p>However, Lucille still didn't take him seriously, even though his Magnetic Sacred Mountain had broken her Earth Element Power.</p>

  <p>She knew well that this young man in front of her was indeed not bad, but it was impossible for him to defeat her. Hence, Lucille was more curious about him. 'How is this guy so confident?' she thought.</p>

  <p>Lucille paid her last thought no mind and simply said, "You can put forward other conditions, and my Ji Clan will try to fulfill them for you. I am not referring to the Illusion Battlefield, but the outside world!"</p>

  <p>Thoughtless Minds was one of the three great human forces, and the Ji Clan was the third largest family of the Thoughtless Minds. The Ji Clan was still a behemoth even if compared to many other races in the Upper World, not to mention a warrior of the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>In Lucille's eyes, the Ji Clan could easily fulfill any request this youth had.</p>

  <p>"Conditions..." Luo Luo Zheng smiled as he stared at Lucille. "I'm not interested in that. I think a fight between us is much more fun!"</p>

  <p>The Thunder Wind Divine Sword appeared in front of his chest once again as he spoke, and the smile on his face turned hard and serious.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng didn't care about the Ji Clan.</p>

  <p>He could even teach her the Blood Refinement Technique without rewards.</p>

  <p>The Myriad Manifestations of Nature was an essay written by his master.</p>

  <p>It recorded strange happenings and also mentioned this Blood Refinement Technique, which wasn't anything important.</p>

  <p>It was simply because Luo Luo Zheng didn't like this haughty woman's attitude!</p>

  <p>He originally intended to stay outside the main city to get Lucille's Illusion Points, but now she said that she would spare his life for the Blood Refinement Technique. There was no way he'd agree to that!</p>

  <p>At the same time, Lucille's eyes darkened at Luo Zheng's actions. Her voice deepened as she murmured, "It seems that you need a good lesson. Very well, I will make you understand the gap between us?"</p>
