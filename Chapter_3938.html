<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The bright silver sword radiance was unstoppable. All the Diabolic Demons that crossed its path were shredded into pieces and became lifeless blood red Diabolic Earth again.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't feel guilty in the slightest over killing all these Diabolic Demons.</p>

  <p>In his eyes, they were soulless creatures.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Clang!</p>

  <p>Zheng was stunned. To his surprise, his long sword had slashed at the arm of a Diabolic Demon, yet it just bounced off, leaving only a mark.</p>

  <p>It was his first time to encounter a Diabolic Demon that was able to resist his sword strike.</p>

  <p>"It's a purple Diabolic Demon," Zheng muttered as he looked the demon up and down.</p>

  <p>Then, he noticed he was rapidly being surrounded by this new type of Diabolic Demons. Their skin glowed a corpse-like purple, and he knew they were much stronger than the grey ones he had been dealing with till now.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>A bright light flashed in Zheng's eyes, and the power of his sword strike increased dramatically.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The purple Diabolic Demon was instantly cut into two pieces.</p>

  <p>After Zheng became an Eternal Realm warrior, his physical body was further strengthened. With a casual sword strike, he could release three to four hundred thousand divine megatons of force. Ordinary Eternal Realm warriors were no match for him.</p>

  <p>However, despite this, the purple Diabolic Demons were still hard to slay.</p>

  <p>Zheng's pace was slowed down considerably.</p>

  <p>"The purple Diabolic Demons are the backbone of the Land of Diabolic Demons. They are much stronger," the Primeval Lord of Heaven commented.</p>

  <p>"But I don't think they are strong enough," Zheng said with a sneer.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>The half-moon shaped sword radiance lashed out, and three purple Diabolic Demons were sliced in half.</p>

  <p>"Dark brown and black Diabolic Demons are the most powerful. The dark brown ones are the generals of their race, though there are not many of them. The black ones are their kings. It is said that there are only four kings in the whole Land of Diabolic Demons."</p>

  <p>While the Primeval Lord of Heaven was lecturing, a dark brown Diabolic Demon appeared.</p>

  <p>About seven dark brown claws suddenly stretched out from the cave wall above. They were not afraid of Zheng's sword blade. To his surprise, they grabbed onto his blade and started pulling at it.</p>

  <p>Under their joint effort, they were able to yank the sword right out of Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>Seeing that they were about to take away his long sword, Zheng quickly grabbed one end of the sword. Then, he somersaulted backwards, with silver sword radiance twirling around him.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>The sword radiance hit the dark brown sharp claws, but only a crisp sound was heard. The dark brown claws emerged from the attack, unscathed. Not even a mark was left on them.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes widened in shock.</p>

  <p>Libby had told him repeatedly that the three death lands were extremely dangerous, and even the Primeval Lord of Heaven had also warned him since he entered the Land of Diabolic Demons. Yet, he was too consumed with confidence and didn't take them seriously.</p>

  <p>He had fought all the way on the Other Shore. Except for the few stage rulers in the Dark Region, he didn't encounter any other formidable opponents.</p>

  <p>The Diabolic Demons were the creatures on the periphery of the Grand Pure Realm. He had been under the impression that they weren't that strong, since they were just made of earth.</p>

  <p>But this time, Zheng was wrong. There were really no such thing as a weak race in the Three Purities Stage!</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The demons took Zheng's momentary surprise as an opportunity to strike.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, those dark brown sharp claws reached out to grab him from all directions, wrapping around his limbs, body, and neck. It wasn't long before Zheng was completely entangled.</p>

  <p>Then, the dark brown Diabolic Demons emerged.</p>

  <p>"Kof, Kof, Kof..."</p>

  <p>"Goo, goo..."</p>

  <p>They spoke in their own language, so Zheng couldn't understand what they were saying.</p>

  <p>Zheng tried to break free from the claws, but they held him down tightly. Even if he used all his strength, it was futile.</p>

  <p>"I warned you," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said helplessly. "It's irrational to force your way out."</p>

  <p>"But I didn't have a chance to get out of here, anyway," Zheng whined through gritted teeth.</p>

  <p>He wasn't able to tell the direction underground, and when he first arrived, he was instantly surrounded by the Diabolic Demons. There was no way he could've escaped earlier!</p>

  <p>He didn't have the ability to turn himself into water and sneak away, like what Gonggong did.</p>

  <p>Just then, the generals of Diabolic Demons carrying Zheng suddenly bent their bodies slightly. Then, four black Diabolic Demons appeared in the earth in front of the passageway. They were the kings that the Primeval Lord of Heaven had mentioned.</p>

  <p>The black Diabolic Demon in front studied Zheng intently. His ugly face contorted into what looked like a frown. "You caught him, just like that?</p>

  <p>Wasn't it too easy?"</p>

  <p>The kings were all under the impression that Zheng was stronger than this.</p>

  <p>As a result, they were quite disappointed he had been captured so easily.</p>

  <p>They must've overestimated his strength.</p>

  <p>After all, the stronger an Eternal Realm warrior was, the better his bloodline would be.</p>

  <p>What the kings wanted to devour the most were the Eternal Realm warriors with higher-level bloodlines.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng was caught quite easily, which meant he was weak.</p>

  <p>"He didn't use any ability of his bloodline. Strange." Another king shook his ugly head.</p>

  <p>"Maybe his bloodline power just strengthens himself. Don't you think his body is quite sturdy?" a third black Diabolic Demon speculated.</p>

  <p>The other Diabolic Demons could only communicate in their own language, but the four kings could communicate in human language very fluently.</p>

  <p>As Zheng heard what they said about him, his heart sank. "Are you not satisfied with me?" he asked piteously.</p>

  <p>The first king took a step forward. "Of course not. Your bloodline power is of little use to us."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Zheng was stunned.</p>

  <p>"If we devour Eternal Realm warriors, we will get the rewards engraved in their bloodlines, which can greatly enhance us and our entire race," the king said as he stretched out his sinewy hand to wrap Zheng's neck in his sharp ebony claw.</p>

  <p>Zheng was then pulled out of the dark brown claws.</p>

  <p>His neck was tethered, but his hands and feet were free.</p>

  <p>Clasping the king's arm with one hand, he kicked forward violently.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Zheng gritted his teeth. His kick did nothing. The king barely even flinched.</p>

  <p>"You probably just reached the Eternal Realm. It's not bad for you to have such power, but unfortunately, your bloodline is too weak." Once he finished speaking, the king threw Zheng backwards like a rag doll.</p>

  <p>Another two kings grabbed Zheng from the left and the right. The last one grabbed a piece of earth from the wall and smeared it all over his body.</p>

  <p>The Diabolic Earth was the mother of the Diabolic Demon race. It also was honored as their sacred place.</p>

  <p>It was fine the outsiders intruded into the surface of the Land of Diabolic Demons. As long as they were on the ground, they wouldn't irritate the Diabolic Demons and had the chance to escape.</p>

  <p>However, any creature that dared enter the Diabolic Earth was doomed. It was considered grave desecration of their sacred place. Zheng was in great trouble now, since he even dug a path spanning dozens of miles long.</p>

  <p>After Zheng's body was covered with the Diabolic Earth all over, two kings pulled him up and drilled upwards until they reached the surface. The strange thing was that, with his body covered with the Diabolic Earth, he could move freely in the earth without damaging it, just like the Diabolic Demons. It was as though he were water seeping through the mud...</p>
