<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Because of Huey's existence, the other races hadn't even had the slightest chance of winning a seat in the Tower of Sin. Although the members of the Demon Night were born strong, the ogres had still been able to suppress them until Amber appeared.</p>

  <p>However, the true decline of the ogres in the Tower of Sin was because of Huey's sudden disappearance.</p>

  <p>No one knew if Huey was alive or dead. He had mysteriously disappeared from the Tower of Sin without a trace. No one knew where he had gone.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, the ogres had still been able to control the seats in the Tower of Sin. But after the sudden rise of the Demon Night decades ago, the ogres had lost the first seat to them. Since then, Esther had controlled the number one seat while Maurice could only control number two.</p>

  <p>"Huey's disappearance was a great loss to us ogres." Malcom was upset. If Huey hadn't gone missing, the Demon Night wouldn't have been able to suppress the ogres.</p>

  <p>"Don't you think it's strange that Huey went missing just like that?" Yolande asked.</p>

  <p>"Strange? Of course it's strange!" Malcom said with a frown. Then, as he stared at Yolande, he suddenly remembered something. "It's you! You killed him?"</p>

  <p>Yolande nodded and turned around to look at the unimaginably large monster in the distance. "I was the one who killed Huey and turned him into nourishment for the Tower of Sin. His corpse was completely absorbed by the tower."</p>

  <p>"What?" Rehaan was dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>The reason for Huey's disappearance struck Malcom after he recalled that Yolande had appeared out of nowhere around the same time that Huey had disappeared. Malcom had never linked those two events until now.</p>

  <p>The talent Yolande had displayed when she entered the first floor of the Tower of Sin had been extremely terrifying. As a result, the ogres would try their best to get her killed. However, just like Amber, Yolande's strength had far exceeded the expectations of the ogres. No matter how hard they tried to kill her, she was always able to defeat her opponents.</p>

  <p>As a result, Yolande had easily entered the tenth floor of the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>Just when the ogres were preparing to get rid of Yolande with everything they had, she announced that she wasn't going to enter the Talent Tablet.</p>

  <p>Moreover, she didn't seem to have any intention of going to the eleventh floor. Since then, she had stayed on the tenth floor, much to the surprise of the humans as well as the other races.</p>

  <p>After the initial surprise wore off, the ogres continued to observe her for a while, but she didn't stir up any trouble. And they thought that as long as she didn't reach the top floor, she wouldn't pose a threat to them. So although they didn't understand her reasons, they just let her be.</p>

  <p>None of the ogres could have imagined that this level ten war general would have been able to kill the top-level war lord of the ogres without anyone knowing. Huey had been in control of the Tower of Sin for over a hundred years.</p>

  <p>"Why did you kill Huey?" Although Malcom didn't know Huey personally and had nothing to do with him, they were still from the same race, so he was curious.</p>

  <p>"Huey was one of Immortal Mist's puppets. He was in the Tower of Sin waiting for Luo Zheng," Yolande explained.</p>

  <p>It wasn't until now that Luo Zheng finally understood everything. Immortal Mist, who was in the Central Region, didn't know that Huey was already dead. In his eyes, as long as Luo Zheng entered the Tower of Sin, Huey would definitely find him at the first possible moment and bring him into the Dark Nether Cave to fulfill Immortal Mist's last wish.</p>

  <p>As such, Immortal Mist hadn't said much to Luo Zheng, only telling him that he would understand everything after entering the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>If Huey had still been alive, then Luo Zheng would have been able to reach the top floor of the Tower of Sin effortlessly. At the very least, he wouldn't have been suppressed and attacked by the ogres along the way because protecting Luo Zheng had been Huey's mission.</p>

  <p>However, since Yolande had entered the Tower of Sin and killed Huey, she was the only one who could guide Luo Zheng now.</p>

  <p>Yolande blinked and shifted her gaze to Zheng's face. "If Huey had brought you here, he would have told you the same thing. Throw the Jade Butterfly into the chasm, because that is the only way to open the passageway."</p>

  <p>"I see." Luo Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>He didn't know if Yolande was telling the truth or not, and he couldn't tell which power Yolande represented and which power Huey represented. But regardless of who was in the right and who was in the wrong, Luo Zheng would always follow his own path. He wouldn't easily take anyone's side.</p>

  <p>With that thought, Luo Zheng released the burning Jade Butterfly in his hand, letting it fall freely down the chasm.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The sparkling Jade Butterfly collided with the edge of the chasm, sinking into the darkness faster than Luo Zheng had expected. All he could see was a small red dot before it completely disappeared into the darkness.</p>

  <p>"What's going to happen?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Just wait," Yolande said.</p>

  <p>"For how long?" Luo Zheng asked again.</p>

  <p>Yolande shook her head. "There is no end to this chasm, so I don't know where it is."</p>

  <p>"There's no end to the chasm?" Luo Zheng asked curiously. "No matter how deep the chasm is, it should have an end, right?"</p>

  <p>No matter how deep something was, there should be a limit. A thousand miles? Ten thousand miles? It was impossible for it to not have a bottom.</p>

  <p>Xun, who had been quiet all this time, smiled. "If my guess is right, this is an endless chasm. There really is no bottom. Someone once explored this chasm in an attempt to find out where it led to and how deep it was.</p>

  <p>After falling into the chasm for 1, 400 years, he still didn't reach the bottom.</p>

  <p>It took him 2, 000 years to fly back up."</p>

  <p>Yolande nodded. "Indeed. And there is more than one chasm like this in the worlds."</p>

  <p>Everyone but Yolande was shocked at Xun's words.</p>

  <p>A guy had jumped into the chasm and hadn't reached its bottom after 1, 400 years? How had this chasm come about?</p>

  <p>Everyone silently looked at the chasm in front of them. As they stared into the darkness, they began to feel a sense of fear. There were too many secrets in this world, some of them far beyond their understanding.</p>

  <p>However, there were also enough madmen in this world. Someone had actually been willing to spend more than 3, 000 years exploring the depth of this chasm.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng threw the Jade Butterfly down, a full six hours passed before they heard a loud sound from the depths of the chasm.</p>

  <p>"It's coming." Yolande turned and walked away. "Leave the edge of the chasm. It would be bad if we were to be caught by it."</p>

  <p>From inside the chasm came a rumbling voice that sounded like a clap of thunder. Who knew what kind of monster was trying to climb out of the chasm?</p>

  <p>Even if Yolande hadn't said anything, there was no idiot who would have stayed by the side of the chasm. Everyone turned around and followed Luo Zheng, leaving the edge of the chasm to get to a relatively safe place.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" Esther asked.</p>

  <p>No matter what it was, it was probably not much smaller than the Mad Scorpion to be able to create such a huge commotion in the chasm.</p>

  <p>"Actually, you've all seen it before," Yolande replied.</p>

  <p>"We've seen it before?" Everyone was shocked.</p>

  <p>Yolande nodded. "It's the plant that chased us all the way here. What we saw were just the roots protruding out of the ground. Its main body is in here."</p>

  <p>Xun smiled coldly. "It's just a Heavenly Immortal Root!"</p>

  <p>"Why is it coming up?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Yolande, however, only said, "You'll soon understand."</p>

  <p>As the roar became louder and louder, the sound became deafening to all of their ears. Luo Zheng and the others had no choice but to use their life vitality to temporarily seal off their own hearing. As the thing in the chasm got closer and closer to the opening, fear and anxiety became apparent on everyone's face. But despite the loud noise, the Mad Scorpion was still fast asleep.</p>

  <p>"It's here!" Yolande said as she stared into the distance.</p>

  <p>Sure enough, the next moment, everyone saw a giant plant climbing out of the chasm. On top of the plant, there was an incomparably strange and ugly face.</p>

  <p>The most frightening thing was that the strange face was facing them!</p>

  <p>The face of this giant plant wasn't much smaller than the head of the Mad Scorpion. It was around the size of a mountain. However, the two eyeballs on its face were staring straight at Zheng's group!</p>
