<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The air in the backyard seemed to solidify. These rich, evil disciples hadn't expected Zheng to make such a move.</p>

  <p>"How dare you attack Jago!" one of them shouted.</p>

  <p>Zheng turned to smile at the young man. "I'm a fair person," he said with a shrug.</p>

  <p>"Fair about what?" the young man barked, puzzled at Zheng's words.</p>

  <p>"I don't discriminate between people. I'll punch everyone," Zheng said, floating like a ghost towards the other man and slapping him in the face.</p>

  <p>The smack was so heavy it sent the young man spinning several times and flying through the air before he fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>The diabolical disciples finally realized that Zheng wasn't to be taken lightly.</p>

  <p>"The Soul-controlling Bead!"</p>

  <p>One of the disciples pulled out the silver bead again. With a flash of light, the bead sealed the internal momentum in Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>But Zheng hadn't used any internal momentum yet. He could move at a high speed using purely his physical strength.</p>

  <p>The rich, evil disciples all had a high cultivation base, but their actual combat ability was close to zero. They might be good at playing tricks and using their magic weapons to suppress consummate True Gods. But it was impossible for them to defeat Zheng, who was experienced in battles.</p>

  <p>The Soul-controlling Bead blocked his elixir field, causing Zheng to stop and reconsider. And then, in the blink of an eye, he rushed over to the young man.</p>

  <p>He stretched out both his hands like lightning and grabbed the bead with one hand while twisting the young man's arm with the other, shattering it into pieces.</p>

  <p>Zheng sighed as he saw the horror in the man's eyes.</p>

  <p>These people had their cultivation bases and magic weapons, and yet they were so weak that they could hardly cope with anything.</p>

  <p>"Trap him!" someone shouted.</p>

  <p>But it was not easy to trap Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng activated the Truth of Cultivation Nature and moved extremely fast.</p>

  <p>There was no way for his foes to catch up with him.</p>

  <p>As they chased him, houses, rockeries, and walls in the backyard came crashing down. Even the ground shook from time to time.</p>

  <p>The two men guarding the gate of Sword Dance Palace couldn't help but sigh as they heard the noise.</p>

  <p>"What a din! I think they've destroyed the backyard again!"</p>

  <p>"They do this all the time. Every time I see the newcomers, I feel sorry for them. I try my best to persuade them not to join the Sword Light Palace, but they never appreciate my well-intended advice. Now, I don't care anymore.</p>

  <p>Sometimes people only learn after they begin regretting it."</p>

  <p>The ground continued to tremble as they spoke, and the sound in the backyard grew louder by the minute.</p>

  <p>A moment later, a violent explosion sounded from the backyard.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>A dreadful aura spread out, causing the Sword Dance Palace to tremble.</p>

  <p>The two disciples looked at each other, shocked. If they chose to do nothing, they were afraid that the disciples within would tear down the entire Sword Dance Palace.</p>

  <p>"Let's go inside and see what's happening," one of them suggested.</p>

  <p>The disciples were hellraisers, but they had never made so much noise in the past. This time seemed different.</p>

  <p>The two men in cyan went straight to the backyard.</p>

  <p>One of them then walked up to the mountain beside the Sword Dance Palace.</p>

  <p>Ingram Qiu lay in a pavilion in the mountain, drinking.</p>

  <p>Ever since he was appointed as the head of the Sword Dance Palace, Ingram Qiu had been in low spirits most of the time. That was probably why the Sword Dance Palace had been reduced to this state.</p>

  <p>The man in cyan flew into the pavilion.</p>

  <p>"Master, something bad has happened!"</p>

  <p>"What is it? Do those new disciples want to leave because they can't stand it anymore?" Ingram Qiu asked, his words slurring.</p>

  <p>He had anticipated that the newcomers wouldn't be able to stay for long in the Sword Dance Palace, which was why his tone was calm and composed.</p>

  <p>The disciple shook his head. "No, Master. The disciples from the Yuebai Clan and the Qiu Clan have all been knocked out. Faegan has activated a Latent Theurgy. And most of the Sword Dance Palace has been destroyed!"</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>Ingram Qiu yelled, his expression changing to one of shock. The pot of alcohol fell from his grip and he disappeared into thin air.</p>

  <p>He then appeared in the Sword Dance Palace.</p>

  <p>Just as the disciple in cyan had reported to him, the entire backyard of the palace was now in ruins.</p>

  <p>Houses, pavilions, and courtyards were destroyed.</p>

  <p>In the backyard, the newcomers stood safe and sound, while the rich disciples of the Sword Dance Palace looked to be writhing in pain.</p>

  <p>Even the least injured of them had broken arms and legs. Dying people lay on the ground, motionless, half their bodies smashed. The only one among them that was still upright was the long-haired young man.</p>

  <p>A golden eggshell was wrapped around the long-haired young man's body.</p>

  <p>This golden eggshell was a Latent Theurgy that the master of the Qiu Clan had given him. It could be activated for protection when he was in danger.</p>

  <p>It was the golden eggshell that had prevented him from being beaten unconscious by Zheng.</p>

  <p>"You are so dead!</p>

  <p>You have not only offended the Qiu Clan, but also the Yuebai Clan!</p>

  <p>You won't get away with this!" threatened the young man with the long hair, gritting his teeth as he hid behind the golden eggshell.</p>

  <p>Zheng had heard too many threats in his life and this young man's words were hardly a dent on the armor he had brought up around himself.</p>

  <p>"Really?" Zheng said, his faint smile amused.</p>

  <p>He spread out his arms and flew up into the air, drawing a perfect arc as he went.</p>

  <p>This time, Zheng had used eighty percent of his strength.</p>

  <p>The golden eggshell shook under the violent attack, but it still stood strong.</p>

  <p>"Go on! You think you can break my grandfather's Latent Theurgy? You are daydreaming!" the long-haired young man roared.</p>

  <p>Zheng ignored the young man's sarcasm and poured his violent power on the golden eggshell through his punches.</p>

  <p>A crack eventually appeared in the upper part of the eggshell.</p>

  <p>The young man panicked, horrified.</p>

  <p>He knew very well that he was no match for Zheng. Once the golden eggshell broke, he would probably end up like the others.</p>

  <p>Zheng took a deep breath and extracted his strength source so that it gathered in his fist.</p>

  <p>He was about to crush the golden eggshell once and for all when a palm emerged from one side and blocked his movements.</p>

  <p>Zheng's fist hit the palm.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, all the power of his fist vanished.</p>

  <p>"That's enough," said Ingram Qiu, coming to stand before Zheng.</p>

  <p>He looked cautiously at the young man in front of him.</p>

  <p>Strength aside, he was surprised to see that Zheng even had the courage to challenge the troublesome disciples of the Sword Dance Palace. After all, Zheng had just joined the Sword Dance Palace.</p>
