<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Hurry up!" the Primeval Lord of Heaven urged Zheng. "What are you thinking about there?"</p>

  <p>Zheng merely stood on the spot and the Primeval Lord of Heaven saw it fit to get him moving.</p>

  <p>There was no way to distinguish the corpses of the three Other Shore creatures from each other given that they were all covered with black ink.</p>

  <p>Hearing what the Primeval Lord of Heaven had said, Zheng quickly mobilized and began to wildly run towards the opposite direction.</p>

  <p>Moving like a crab in the Eternal Scroll Painting made it extremely difficult for him to run but he was surprisingly fast since it was currently a life-and-death crisis.</p>

  <p>After killing the three Other Shore creatures, the Worm Tapir turned its attention to Zheng who was trying to escape with his life. It straightened its body and only left four, black dots on the Eternal Scroll Painting. These dots were the projection of its four legs.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the black dots disappeared! This was when the Worm Tapir jumped into the air and lunged forward.</p>

  <p>What it actually did was move to a higher space in order to get closer to its prey.</p>

  <p>Zheng witnessed it disappear every now and then but every time he caught sight of it, it seemed to get closer and closer.</p>

  <p>A trace of helplessness appeared on his face. "It's so fast!" he whined and the Primeval Lord of Heaven harrumphed in reply.</p>

  <p>"This is why I told you to leave in the beginning but no! You decided to stand there and watch it approach!"</p>

  <p>Zheng was no stranger to crisis. Ever since he carried the human race's Civilization Artifact, all he seemed to face was crisis, after crisis, after crisis. Through it all though, the Primeval Lord of Heaven was always his source of calm and clarity, however, this didn't seem to be the case for their current situation.</p>

  <p>The reason he could be so calm back then was either because he had something up his sleeve or the trouble was so trivial that Zheng would be able to deal with it by himself.</p>

  <p>This time, however, the Primeval Lord of Heaven was at a loss. The moment Zheng entered the Eternal Scroll Painting, he was already a part of it and subject to its irregularities.</p>

  <p>It didn't help that his current form was very inconvenient. There was no way to escape from whatever crisis the Eternal Scroll Painting was going to throw at them.</p>

  <p>The Eternal Scroll Painting could be entered but to leave it was a different story altogether.</p>

  <p>If some people remained trapped on the first page because they failed to kill enough beasts, they wouldn't be able to leave until the Eternal Scroll Painting was closed.</p>

  <p>There was definitely no form of escape to get away from this Worm Tapir!</p>

  <p>"What should I do now?" Zheng asked in desperation. The distance between him and the Worm Tapir was only less than ten feet now.</p>

  <p>If it went on like this, then there was no doubt that he would die within the next few seconds.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven was currently trying to think of a way to help Zheng escape his current predicament.</p>

  <p>"What you can do is..."</p>

  <p>It could not be denied that he was under so many limitations and there was only so much they could do to get out of this alive.</p>

  <p>There was a large part in the Primeval Lord of Heaven's heart that he simply wanted to tell Zheng to give up and resign to his fate. However, when he opened his mouth to tell him this, all that came out was one word:</p>

  <p>"Run!"</p>

  <p>Heeding this advice, Zheng rushed forward and tried to create more distance between him and his pursuer. At that point, the Worm Tapir was already less than a foot away.</p>

  <p>Its next leap would no doubt reach him!</p>

  <p>From the corner of Zheng's eye, the Worm Tapir disappeared once again.</p>

  <p>Having noticed this, Zheng stopped abruptly and ran in the opposite direction.</p>

  <p>Sure, the Worm Tapir might be able to bridge distances using its method, but there was no way it would be able to predict Zheng's movements.</p>

  <p>This was only a temporary strategy to his problem but whatever bought him time was a welcome solution.</p>

  <p>To his relief, this strategy actually worked!</p>

  <p>As the Worm Tapir reappeared, it suddenly pounced towards Zheng's original spot only to find him already gone.</p>

  <p>Just as it was about to turn its head, a huge, black hand suddenly appeared out of nowhere and snatched it in the air. A crying face also appeared above the Eternal Scroll Painting and announced a gloomy warning. "You can kill anyone else but him."</p>

  <p>The hand seemed to have humbled the Worm Tapir who now curled up like a docile kitten.</p>

  <p>The hand lightly tossed the Worm Tapir away who then fell into another place within the Eternal Scroll Painting where two Other Shore creatures were staying.</p>

  <p>"Aoo..."</p>

  <p>With a loud roar, the Worm Tapir revealed its ferocious tusks and began to rampage once again.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Zheng continued to run.</p>

  <p>His strategy might have worked but the fight wasn't over yet.</p>

  <p>He still needed to make sure he was safely at a distance. Once the Worm Tapir landed, it would no doubt chase after him again, right?</p>

  <p>As he ran, Zheng looked back just to see how far away the Worm Tapir was this time only to find it already gone!</p>

  <p>It had completely disappeared!</p>

  <p>"Primeval Lord of Heaven, where did it go?"</p>

  <p>"I haven't the slightest idea," the Primeval Lord of Heaven replied, also looking around for any sign of the Worm Tapir.</p>

  <p>"Could it be..." Zheng muttered. "Did it fall somewhere else when it pounced?"</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven shook his head and huffed. "Impossible! The Eternal Scroll Painting is a flat plane. Where could it have fallen into?"</p>

  <p>Despite their misgivings, there was no way for them to know where the Worm Tapir went. At least Zheng managed to stay alive.</p>

  <p>Having survived this nightmare, Zheng chose not to linger and continued ambling towards the direction he was headed to.</p>

  <p>He, unfortunately, still did not encounter any beasts along the way though he did see quite a number of dead Other Shore creatures. They were either miserable pools of black ooze or scattered body parts all over the Eternal Scroll Painting.</p>

  <p>"Were they all killed by that Worm Tapir?" Zheng wondered out loud as he looked at all the strewn bodies. Was it even possible for the Worm Tapir to have caused all this carnage?</p>

  <p>Even if it could move really fast and had a large range of motion, there was no way it could've killed all these Other Shore creatures in such a short period of time.</p>

  <p>There was only one explanation for all of this. There was more than one Worm Tapir here.</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng came to this conclusion, a long, thin silhouette emerged from a distance. It was a member of the Violet Cloud race!</p>

  <p>Among all Other Shore creatures, the Violet Cloud race was the fastest.</p>

  <p>Despite their agility, however, they were still no match for the Worm Tapir.</p>

  <p>Since it was fast, the warrior of the Violet Cloud race managed to outrun the Worm Tapir but it also caught the attention of five to six more. These Worm Tapirs followed behind the poor warrior so closely that Zheng was completely ignored.</p>

  <p>The massacre continued for about ten more minutes and the crying face above soon turned into the smiling one. "Ah, many of them have been cleared away..."</p>

  <p>It originally wanted to eliminate more than half of Other Shore creatures but a lot more perished during the disaster. If the Worm Tapirs didn't stop killing, then it was only a matter of time before all of the creatures were annihilated.</p>

  <p>With a wave of the huge hand, all the Worm Tapirs ceased their murderous rampage.</p>

  <p>It was only then that the Other Shore creatures could breathe a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>"What should we do next?" the smiling face asked. "Should we start guiding him now? Or should we get him out directly?" The crying face appeared and shook its head.</p>

  <p>"Don't make it so obvious. Let him enter the second page first," it said.</p>

  <p>With that, the huge hand grabbed the brush and smeared it onto the Eternal Scroll Painting. Beasts began to materialize within the painting and gathered towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>This large pack of beasts headed straight towards him was greatly unnerving but Zheng soon found that they were of normal strength levels. He would be able to beat them with his abilities.</p>
