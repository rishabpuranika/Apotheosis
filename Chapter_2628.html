  <p>
</p>

  <p>The cities that used to be noisy were now completely silent.</p>

  <p>The creatures outside the bone towers had lived in the cities for a thousand years before being wiped out by the Light of Adjudication.</p>

  <p>Nobody knew how many cycles of reincarnation the world had experienced.</p>

  <p>All the races living in the bone towers were accustomed to such scenes and results.</p>

  <p>Previous experience dictated that the Wights would slowly and steadily become intelligent, and then, under the guidance of the races, step into the empty cities, cultivating the Wild God system. Among them, a very small number of excellent warriors could enter the bone towers.</p>

  <p>But this time, the situation was completely different.</p>

  <p>The exiles in the bone towers were eager to take action.</p>

  <p>The shared goal of the big races led by the Snake Goddess race and the Nine Li race, was to defeat the Warden race and escape from this world.</p>

  <p>The races that were led by the Yellow Emperor race also wanted to escape from this world, but their goal was to stop the Snake Goddess race and the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>There was an irreconcilable conflict between the two forces.</p>

  <p>Both sides were clear about the fact that the new cycle of reincarnation that would happen in the next thousand years was destined to be different from those in the past.</p>

  <p>In the Sky Spirit Bone Tower</p>

  <p>All the members of the Nine Li race had gathered in the square.</p>

  <p>Timotheus stood before them, outwardly calm but excited from within.</p>

  <p>"As members of our race, you must have a clear understanding of our race's background," he said, his voice loud and clear. "Ramzi, Leopold,</p>

  <p>...and I came from a wider world, the Source World. It is our hometown.</p>

  <p>I've wanted to leave this world the moment I entered it, but I never had the chance. But now, there is an opportunity."</p>

  <p>The members of the Nine Li race started at Timotheus' words.</p>

  <p>Apart from Luo Zheng and the exiles, all of the Wild Gods were born in this world.</p>

  <p>There probably were a few Wild Gods who were interested in the outside of this world. But there were many who weren't. They had grown up in the bone tower. They were aboriginals and spent their days in a carefree languor.</p>

  <p>"I know that some of you don't want to leave this world," Timotheus continued. "I won't force you to follow me. If you are willing to stay, you can stay in the bone tower."</p>

  <p>The Wild Gods who didn't want to leave didn't relax at this.</p>

  <p>The reason why the Nine Li race could be a leading race in this world was that these exiles were extremely powerful. If they left this world, the rest of the Wild Gods could not maintain the glory of the race.</p>

  <p>Before long, they would lose control of the Sky Spirit Bone Tower and be expelled or worse, killed, by the exiles of other races.</p>

  <p>So even though they were unwilling to leave, they were still determined to follow Timotheus and the exiles.</p>

  <p>"I'll give you six hours to think about it. Those who want to leave should pack your stuff. We will meet outside the Sky Spirit Bone Tower in six hours." With that, Timotheus flew towards the exit of the Sky Spirit Bone Tower.</p>

  <p>Along with him were several exiles, elders, and executives of the race.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was one of them.</p>

  <p>"Yes! The purified air is so different, so fresh, so sweet!"</p>

  <p>Elsa said, taking a deep breath.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled faintly. "Isn't it the same?"</p>

  <p>But Elsa shook her head. "No, it's different! The Light of Adjudication not only purified all living creatures, but also all the dirt in the world."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng also sniffed like she had done, but he didn't find anything different.</p>

  <p>But Elsa's words got Luo Zheng thinking.</p>

  <p>Why had the Chaos Ancient God built this prison? Why had he placed Timotheus, Ramzi, and all the other warriors here?</p>

  <p>Timotheus had once told Luo Zheng that the skeletons in this world were copies of everyone alive. But no matter how much he speculated, Luo Zheng couldn't seem to understand why the Chaos Ancient God had built this prison.</p>

  <p>Other members of the race walked out of the bone tower.</p>

  <p>A vast majority of the race members were well aware of the situation they were in. They could only follow the exiles of their own race. Only a small number of them refused to leave because they believed that the Sky Spirit Bone Tower was their home and they refused to follow the exiles out.</p>

  <p>When all the members of the race had made and shared their choices, a number of huge bone ships rose slowly into the air. Adele, Giacomo, and other elders directed the members towards the north in an orderly manner.</p>

  <p>This world was very small for the exiles, but it was still too large for the Wild Gods. This meant that it would take a long time for such a large number of people to migrate. Timotheus and Emily had agreed to assemble under the Starry Spirit Bone Tower in the north.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, the members of the Snake Goddess race also started to move towards the Starry Spirit Bone Tower.</p>

  <p>The Starry Spirit Bone Tower was located in the territory of the Star Deer race.</p>

  <p>Although Levi of the Star Deer race had tried to kill Luther and had in turn been killed by Emily, the other exiles of this race didn't involve themselves. They were still willing to follow up with the Snake Goddess race.</p>

  <p>The exiles of the Southern Dipper race, Fire Melting race, and the other races also began to move towards the Starry Spirit Bone Tower.</p>

  <p>About three months later, more than ten races and hundreds of thousands of people had finally gathered under the Starry Spirit Bone Tower.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>Zelda called out, her beautiful eyes narrowed as she spotted Luo Zheng in the crowd.</p>

  <p>Zelda had entered the Snake Goddess race and absorbed the Wild God Power of massive wild bones, and in the process, had improved a lot in cultivation. She was now a mid-rank Wild God.</p>

  <p>She was dressed in a long yellow dress, making her features stand out even more. Her temperament had undergone a great change.</p>

  <p>Luther, who was beside her, also looked completely different.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't know what kind of a method Emily had used to improve Luther's cultivation and make him a top-rank True God in such a short period of time.</p>

  <p>Even Luo Zheng marveled at the speed at which Luther had improved. But this didn't mean Luther was more talented than Luo Zheng. It only meant that Emily was able enough that she could efficiently train Luther.</p>

  <p>After a short reunion, they began to move again.</p>

  <p>No one knew where the Warden race was located, apart from Luther and Zelda who led the way.</p>

  <p>Hundreds of thousands of people were still moving north.</p>

  <p>A few months later, they arrived at the northernmost part in the world.</p>

  <p>The land was deserted, devoid of any living creatures.</p>

  <p>Since there was no Immemorial Wilderness here, there was no Wight in this place.</p>

  <p>In fact, before this, many exiles had already explored this place, but to no avail.</p>

  <p>So when Zelda and Luther led them here, the exiles were confused. It was hard for them to imagine that the lair of the Warden race was hidden here.</p>

  <p>They continued to move, and half a month later, they came upon a serrated area. A dark void lay beyond it? the end of the world.</p>
