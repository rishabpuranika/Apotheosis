<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Buddhist cultivation method was a class of its own. Despite being low-key and mysterious, it had its own strong power.</p>

  <p>Since there wasn't any book about the Buddhist cultivation method even in the Heavenly Library of Cloud Sect, nobody knew where Patrick learned these Buddhist cultivation methods.</p>

  <p>Patrick said he would use three moves, but it was only one move. He resisted Wing twice with the impenetrable defense made from his life vitality.</p>

  <p>The move he was about to use for counterattack was called The Samsara of Buddhism.</p>

  <p>The samsara in Buddhism was described as the ultimate destination of a dead person's soul. The soul of a dead person wouldn't just disappear but would be sent to any of the six realms of existence, namely three good realms (heavenly, demi-god, human) and three evil realms (animal, ghosts, hellish).</p>

  <p>At the moment, six small golden balls were suddenly beside Patrick.</p>

  <p>These small balls were bright gold on the surface with different characters engraved on each representing the six realms.</p>

  <p>Patrick hadn't cultivated enough so the small balls were in such a state. If he was able to achieve a higher level of the Samsara of Buddhism from his cultivation, there would be six different small worlds within the balls like the space in the space ring.</p>

  <p>However, there was no living thing in the space ring, while the six small balls had real worlds in them.</p>

  <p>If these small balls could create six worlds, Patrick's strength would be so unimaginably powerful. Even Kenneth would probably be killed in seconds.</p>

  <p>As soon as they appeared, the small balls started to spin rapidly that they formed a whirlpool in front of Patrick.</p>

  <p>Patrick's cultivation method looked nothing special. After he summoned the Samsara of Buddhism, only a gentle and ordinary whirlpool appeared.</p>

  <p>But this was the nature of the Buddhist cultivation–it looked gentle and common, but nobody would dare to deny its strong power.</p>

  <p>"Put on an air! Break it!"</p>

  <p>Wing waved his treasured machete and tried to shatter it.</p>

  <p>The Shura Chop was Wing's strongest attack, but he never used it in his previous matches because the opponents didn't deserve it.</p>

  <p>Wing might be arrogant, but he was no fool to turn a blind eye to Patrick's powerful might. Patrick didn't become the second best in Cloud Sect for nothing.</p>

  <p>So Wing exerted all his strength. Even a lion would use all its strength to capture its prey. And since Patrick was stronger than Wing, the latter must not falter at all cost.</p>

  <p>Wing congealed the cutter intent into a much stronger grey cutter light which was stronger than that made from the life vitality. When Wing finished cultivating this move, he had used it to cut a 200-foot-high mount.</p>

  <p>He cut through the whole mount with the Shura Chop once.</p>

  <p>The machete was one of the top weapons. The warrior cultivating to the extreme could even split the mountain and ground effortlessly.</p>

  <p>As soon as the fierce cutter energy appeared, the air around the arena moved rapidly and howled sharply as if unable to bear the overbearing cutter energy.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh..."</p>

  <p>The cutter energy suddenly rushed into Patrick's six whirlpools.</p>

  <p>The outermost layer of the whirlpools was instantly cut into pieces as soon as the cutter intent touched it. Like splitting bamboo, the cutter intent chopped Patrick's gentle whirlpools layer after layer.</p>

  <p>Seeing that his machete was successfully cutting through Patrick's whirlpools, Wing sneered,"Let's see how well you can resist it!"</p>

  <p>Wing could smell his victory over Patrick.</p>

  <p>With his position in the Cloud Sect, Patrick would naturally keep his promise. Wing didn't have the confidence that he could keep on fighting Patrick if the latter wouldn't surrender after the three-move covenant.</p>

  <p>But the smile on Wing's face gradually faded.</p>

  <p>As his Shura Chop went deeper, it gradually slowed down until it couldn't penetrate anymore and eventually stopped.</p>

  <p>'What is happening? How could he stop my blade?' Fear brushed onto Wing's face when Patrick just easily grabbed his cutter intent.</p>

  <p>Patrick remained expressionless as he stretched his hand to direct the whirlpool into a different direction at high speed.</p>

  <p>The Shura Chop stuck in the whirlpool spun without a stop until…</p>

  <p>"Boo!"</p>

  <p>A violent shock appeared in the air, and the Shura Chop flew backward to Wing.</p>

  <p>'Is this my own Shupra Chop? But why is it trying to attack me? No, this is more powerful than my Shura Chop! Patrick...'</p>

  <p>Nobody knew more about the power of the Shura Chop than Wing, but he found out that the Shura Chop in the whirlpool was more powerful and horrifying than the one he released.</p>

  <p>'Retreat!'</p>

  <p>Wing knew that there was no way he could defeat the opponent, so he chose to retreat. But his speed wasn't enough to avoid the Shura Chop. In the blink of an eye, the Shura Chop was already in front of him.</p>

  <p>Wing couldn't dodge it anymore, so he just blocked with his treasured michete in front of him.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>Although Wing's treasured machete blocked most of the cutter intent, the strong cutter intent spread and tore Wing's robe into pieces.</p>

  <p>Despite the force he applied, Wing was still knocked back into the light curtain of the enchanted barrier and slowly slid down. Wing's robe was cut into rags and he had suffered injuries so deep that his bones were exposed.</p>

  <p>Wing leaned against the light curtain of the enchanted barrier, staring blankly at nowhere.</p>

  <p>He was depressed. He was ready to be defeated, but he didn't expect to lose with a grievance–being defeated by his own most powerful attack move. And the power of the Shura Chop from Patrick's weird whirlpool had doubled.</p>

  <p>"Three moves are more than enough to defeat you," Patrick glanced at Wing indifferently and then turned to leave.</p>

  <p>The disciples of the thirty-three peaks were silent after watching the battle.</p>

  <p>So far, the top disciples from the thirty-three peaks had been performing their best this year–Luo Zheng, Wing, Tianming, and Sheeny to name a few.</p>

  <p>The famous top disciples who weren't taught personally by masters did better than the conceited personal disciples. This fact made the inner and outer disciples of the thirty-three peaks proud. So, it didn't matter if they were from poor families because they could still defeat the personal disciples with their perseverance.</p>

  <p>But then there was Patrick. He showed up on the competition to teach the disciples a lesson– that even such a genius top disciple like Wing from Skytop Peak would be defeated with only three moves. No, it was just one move. From the beginning of the competition to the end, Patrick only attacked once, but Wing had lost the capacity to fight.</p>

  <p>This brought back the fact that the personal disciples were terrifying and powerful.</p>

  <p>"Patrick, you are awesome!"</p>

  <p>"Patrick, you didn't use three moves. You just resisted Wing twice and used his own move against him!"</p>

  <p>"That's right! Patrick could defeat these disciples from the thirty-three peaks with only a half move. Now, let's see how these disciples will react!"</p>

  <p>"Patrick is not even the top best personal disciple. And the top best disciple, Evan, is still staying secluded for now. If he shows up, he will defeat all the disciples of the thirty-three peaks. It's a dream to defeat the personal disciples. Maybe in the next life, they will have the chance!"</p>

  <p>To be frank, the personal disciples didn't have a good performance in the All Peaks Competition this year because many of them were defeated by the disciples from the thirty-three peaks. For example, three personal disciples were defeated by Wing, while two personal disciples were nosed out by Sheeny, and Luo Zheng won over too many of them.</p>

  <p>The personal disciples were losing their faces. They were known to be more powerful than the disciples from the thirty-three peaks in all aspects. They were the cream of the crop in Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>So when personal disciples started losing to the disciples from the thirty-three peaks, the group of the personal disciples felt embarrassed.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Patrick avenged them and proved that the personal disciples were unbeatable. They once again became bold and elated.</p>

  <p>"Why are you shouting? You only have Patrick, while we have Tianming, Luo Zheng, and other geniuses. We have a shot in winning the All Peaks Competition this year," some of the disciples from the thirty-three peaks retorted upon hearing the satire remarks from the personal disciples.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng? The disciple at the second grade of the nature level? Tianming? The one at the consummation of nature level? Don't be silly! You just have these two disciples, but neither of them is a match for Patrick! You really can't stop daydreaming, can you?" the personal disciples answered back sarcastically.</p>

  <p>The disciples from the thirty-three peaks and personal disciples started to taunt each other and then flung abuses.</p>

  <p>The Cloud Sect elders and the referees didn't stop the commotion.</p>

  <p>Any warrior mustn't lack the warm blood. The whole Cloud Sect was like a cage of crickets and they let the disciples fight against each other in it. The last one standing would be cultivated to be more talented and powerful than others.</p>

  <p>Only the human was not cricket. The fight in Cloud Sect was not to kill limitlessly. They set reasonable rules to inspire the warm blood of the disciples and let them develop their greatest talent.</p>

  <p>The quarrels and abuses got more tense. When they were about to fight, two elders coming from above released two violent powers that frightened all the disciples.</p>

  <p>"That's enough! Your strength can't be proven with your mouth, but only by fighting in the arena!"</p>

  <p>The fight among the audience finally ceased. But both the personal disciples and thirty-three peaks disciples wanted to get their pride in the next rounds.</p>

  <p>The referee finally announced the next round,"Luo Zheng from Drizzle Peak versus the personal disciple Tracy."</p>
