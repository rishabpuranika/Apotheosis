<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2051 Stall For Time (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Supreme Lord Wilbur had already foreseen the might of the Dark Star ahead of time. The enchanted barriers laid out by him had been broken even before he could have made any reactions.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Wilbur's enchanted barriers were combined with the enchanted barriers that the other Sacred world lords had arranged. All of those barriers were obtained after the activation of the divine textures.</p>

  <p>Even the most powerful Supreme Lord wouldn't be able to break it in such a short time...</p>

  <p>However, those enchanted barriers were immediately torn apart when the Dark Star descended. The Dark Star's powerful momentum made the sturdy barriers to become suddenly fragile.</p>

  <p>"This…"</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Wilbur's eyelids twitched with disbelief. He felt an immense sense of danger and wanted to use the Grand Teleportation technique to flee.</p>

  <p>However, the moment he used the Grand Teleportation technique, he felt that the space around him suddenly froze. No matter how many times he tried to activate the Space Law, he couldn't tear the space around him apart at all!</p>

  <p>A Supreme Lord's comprehension of the Space Law should have already reached an extremely high level. However, the space around Supreme Lord Wilbur was actually locked down by someone!</p>

  <p>Maha could have used the Grand World Technique to change the Space Law. Aside from him, only a True God would be able to lock down the space around a Supreme Lord!</p>

  <p>The True God of humankind had made his move!</p>

  <p>As that miserable thought flashed through Supreme Lord Wilbur's mind, he saw an old man on top of the Dark Star. The old man stood formidably and coldly stared down at Supreme Lord Wilbur, as if Supreme Lord Wilbur was already a dead man.</p>

  <p>Aside from Supreme Lord Wilbur, who was unable to escape from that place, the other Sacred martial artists also had no idea what to do next.</p>

  <p>They could only helplessly watch as that massive object pressed towards them.</p>

  <p>However, the Dark Star fell in an instant. It did not take them much time to feel depressed or any pain. They just saw sudden darkness until their bodies were immediately destroyed, and their souls were scattered...</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>An enormous explosion echoed throughout the place. Afterward, the entire supreme world shook nonstop.</p>

  <p>After the Dark Star descended to the ground, a layer of soil was lifted up for tens of thousands of feet. The soil quickly rolled up and was like a 'tsunami' on land. It plowed towards the depths of the supreme world like a rapid and mobile mountain. Everything in its path was swept away...</p>

  <p>The Dark Star smashed into the passageway on the Sighing Wall. The entire star was embedded in the passageway and completely blocked it!</p>

  <p>A mere Dark Star embedded in the passageway would not be able to obstruct any Sacred martial artists. With the Grand Teleportation technique, they would be able to cross over easily.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Wynn's eyes flashed with the bright light. He extended his hand and flicked the air. Then his silver hair continuously fluttered with the wind as a dominant and robust Mu Ning spread towards the starry sky. Immediately the stars in the sky emitted an intense radiance filled with power...</p>

  <p>"Stars in the sky, listen to my command. Use your powers to seal the worlds forever!"</p>

  <p>"Buzz, buzz, buzz…"</p>

  <p>All the stars in the Evolutionary Universe began to emit a brilliant light.</p>

  <p>Wynn originally wanted to control the entire universe, but he failed miserably after the attempt. At his current stage, he could only use the "Star Sealing Technique" of the "Grand Sealing Technique" to seal the entire space in one go...</p>

  <p>In this way, the space there would be completely sealed off by Wynn.</p>

  <p>Additionally, the passageway would also be blocked by him.</p>

  <p>But he knew he could not just seal everything once and for all. This blockage couldn't last for long.</p>

  <p>Although the power of the Dark Star was incomparable, the Sacred race still had their own ways to repel it. The space sealed by the power of the stars was also incomparably solid, but it was still unable to resist the attack of a True God from the Sacred race. A True God would be able to find a way to tear up the seal. If that happened, Wynn's technique would be dispelled!</p>

  <p>However, it would still take some time for the True God to destroy the Dark Star and tear apart the Star Sealing Technique. It would require intense concentration to build enough soul power and destroy the seal.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Wynn's true purpose was to stall for time.</p>

  <p>Since the Sacred race first stepped into the Evolutionary Universe, Wynn continuously weighed the strength of both sides.</p>

  <p>Among all the Sacred warriors of the first expedition team, only 59 Supreme Lords of the Sacred race and one Godly Genius, Maha, were sent to the Evolutionary Universe. Countless other world lords also went there, but they could be ignored as they were not that powerful. But, of these 59 Supreme Lords, three had already been killed by Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Additionally, Wynn had killed one more Supreme Lord earlier. Thus now, there were only 55 Supreme Lords left. The forces of the Sacred race had continued to decrease.</p>

  <p>The reason why Wynn had blocked the passageway at the current stage was that he wanted to buy time. He wanted to ensure that the head of the Celestial Position race would use the destructive methods to kill 55 Supreme Lords in the shortest time possible...</p>

  <p>After Wynn sealed up the passageway, some of the world lords of the Sacred race, who were lucky enough to survive, were covered in dust and grime. They were stunned as they glanced around, ignorant of what had just happened. Their confusion was apparent in their faces.</p>

  <p>"Who is that old man? What is he doing here?" a world lord from the Sacred race asked with bewildered eyes. His tone was filled with curiosity and confusion.</p>

  <p>No one could answer his question. The other world lords were also ignorant of the events.</p>
