<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Silence hung in the air like a thick curtain, and none of the vendors dared to speak.</p>

  <p>Although it was impossible to fight in the Non-combat Zone, the Sword Clan that dominated the place was still highly influential.</p>

  <p>On the young man's chest was a black and white striped pattern, one of the unique symbols of the Sword Clan. It was known that the members of their clan enjoyed absolute privilege in all the divine cities in the Sunrest Tree Region.</p>

  <p>When the young man saw that the middle-aged man didn't say anything anymore, he picked up the divine might coins on the ground. He turned around and his previously cold face was now alight with warmth.</p>

  <p>"You want to give the words to me for free?" Zheng asked dumbfounded. He couldn't deny that he was quite stunned.</p>

  <p>Now, he had considered the thought that the Sanskrit words might be fake.</p>

  <p>Then again, with his wealth he didn't care too much about it.</p>

  <p>Even though the seven unique Sanskrit words might be fake, they were still of great value. The old man even generously offered them as gifts to Zheng, which greatly puzzled him.</p>

  <p>"Yes, we can give them to you for free because there are many copies of the Seven Sanskrit Words of Lorena River all throughout the divine land. They are not secrets, so they're actually worthless," said the young man with a smile.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing those words, Zheng understood. Yet, he saw only the pitiful and pathetic look of the old man whose eyes were full of regret, when he casually stole a glance at him. He smiled and grabbed a handful of divine might coins and said, "As you said, these Sanskrit words are priceless in the eyes of certain people. Surely, they can be sold at five thousand divine might coins. But these two men have made it clear today. Can you sell them to me at one hundred divine might coins?"</p>

  <p>The middle-aged man looked hopeless. He was going to be rich so quickly, but now all his hopes were washed away.</p>

  <p>When Zheng willingly offered one hundred divine might coins, however, he was quite surprised. A hundred divine might coins was a lot of money, even to many True Gods. Furthermore, the Seven Sanskrit Words of Lorena River weren't even worth that much.</p>

  <p>"What?" the young man and the old man exclaimed in shock.</p>

  <p>They had already said that they would give the Seven Sanskrit Words of Lorena River to Zheng for free.</p>

  <p>Yet here he was, still willing to spend a hundred divine might coins. Did he really have that much money to burn?</p>

  <p>It was true that the price Zheng offered was a little unbelievable, but it wasn't enough to make them feel sorry for him. Besides, he had insisted himself, so they wouldn't stop him.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sure!" the middle-aged man hastily said and nodded excitedly.</p>

  <p>He quickly took the divine might coins from Zheng, folded the Seven Sanskrit Words of Lorena River and gave them to him, afraid that Zheng would suddenly change his mind.</p>

  <p>The other vendors around them were quite envious in the beginning, as the sight of five thousand divine might coins was even enough to make a few True Gods fight for it.</p>

  <p>Then, they felt a little bit better when the young man stopped the deal.</p>

  <p>Now that Zheng had offered a hundred divine might coins, they were envious of the middle-aged vendor again.</p>

  <p>At that moment, they all viewed Zheng in a different light.</p>

  <p>At first, they thought that Zheng was too young to know much about life, but now they realized that he was actually a rich, young man who didn't care too much about how many divine might coins he had spent. If he went to their stalls, they would surely make a fortune.</p>

  <p>After Zheng put away the remaining divine might coins, the young man took the opportunity to ask, "Friend, since you have come to the Famous Sword Divine City of my clan, would you like to go to my place for a chat?"</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the vendors began to yell loudly.</p>

  <p>"Look at these Witchcraft Golden Sanskrit Words! They are from the Witchcraft Region and were created by nature."</p>

  <p>"These are Three-eye Golden Sanskrit Words. They come as a set of three."</p>

  <p>"..."</p>

  <p>It was known that a complicated faction had formed when the Sanskrit words were passed down to the world.</p>

  <p>According to some of the characteristics on the surfaces of the Sanskrit words, there were countless famous schools and interpretations.</p>

  <p>Although the names were confusing and the people who really knew how to read Sanskrit words did not like to talk about them, it was a way for the low-rank True Gods to make a living.</p>

  <p>As a secondary creature that came from the universe, Zheng felt it quite amused to see these True Gods, who had unlimited lifespans, sell things like vendors.</p>

  <p>Truly, the rules of the divine land had created a completely different society.</p>

  <p>He also knew that those vendors only did so for their own sake.</p>

  <p>He had indeed just entered the Famous Sword Divine City, so he had to choose some Sanskrit words to bring back.</p>

  <p>He glanced smilingly at the young man and said, "Okay, but I have to choose some Sanskrit words first."</p>

  <p>Once again, the young man and the old man looked at Zheng weakly. There were many copies of Sanskrit words on the street, Sanskrit words that nobody could explain or analyze, and famous Sanskrit words. None of them was good.</p>

  <p>But since Zheng had wished, the young man and the old man had to accompany him.</p>

  <p>Back then, the two of them never bothered to look at the True Gods who sold Sanskrit words in the Famous Sword Divine City. Now was their time to do so when they had to go with Zheng to buy Sanskrit words.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't have a deep understanding of Sanskrit words, and his brief knowledge of them was completely from Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>They proceeded with their travel and he had chosen some Sanskrit words along the way, which were peculiar in shape or pleasing to the eye.</p>

  <p>The young man and the old man in white looked at each other and shook their heads while they went on. Zheng was obviously a complete beginner to Sanskrit words, but how to explain what they saw at the city gate?</p>

  <p>"Look at this Pear Blossom Sanskrit Word. It costs two hundred divine might coins," said a vendor with an outstretched hand.</p>

  <p>The young man smiled and said, "We have this.</p>

  <p>We'll give it to you for free later."</p>

  <p>The vendor looked down in embarrassment, but didn't say anything.</p>

  <p>"This is the Dragon Body Sanskrit. The strokes of the Sanskrit word are crossed forward and backward, like flying dragons in the sky. The price is one hundred and fifty... "</p>

  <p>"We also have this. It's worthless. I'll also give it to you later!" The young man chuckled.</p>

  <p>As they moved along, the young man and the old man finally introduced themselves to Zheng.</p>

  <p>The old man in white was called Marley Mo, and the young man's name was Hayden Mo.</p>

  <p>The most shocking thing Zheng learned about them was that Hayden was the lord of the Famous Sword Divine City. According to him, the city had a new lord, which was him--but he would still be under observation for a period of time before he could really take over the city.</p>

  <p>They walked for a bit more and Zheng had selected almost twenty Sanskrit words. Hayden had stopped him every time, so he spent nothing. Hayden said that he would give Zheng the copies of the Sanskrit words, which were of far better quality than what the vendors sold.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, Zheng was invited to the highest sword shaped building in the Famous Sword Divine City.</p>

  <p>The hall had horizontal and vertical features, while the sword-shaped ornaments were filled with killing intent. Generally speaking, sword culture had great importance in the Sunrest Tree Region.</p>

  <p>"These are the Sanskrit words you chose just now," Hayden said as a waiter placed a pile of Sanskrit words on the desk in front of Zheng.</p>

  <p>The Sanskrit words in the pile were also copies, like Hayden had said, but they were far superior in condition compared to those sold on the street.</p>

  <p>Every Sanskrit word was plated with a golden frame, and a pure glaze covered its surface. It looked like it was a piece of art.</p>

  <p>At that point, Zheng took the Sanskrit words without hesitation.</p>

  <p>Then he heard Hayden ask, "Why did you come to the Sunrest Tree Region at this time? Did you come for the debate over the Godly Ways?"</p>

  <p>"Of course," was Zheng's response.</p>

  <p>In reality, Zheng didn't really come for the debate.</p>

  <p>He came because according to Hallet's presumption, Harold would bring Yan to this place.</p>

  <p>The only thing was, the Sunrest Tree Region was a large region in the divine land, and there were several cities like the Famous Sword Divine City in it. Thus, he didn't know exactly where to look for Harold and Yan.</p>

  <p>"That's great," Hayden said with a smile. "This debate is also very, very important to our Sword Clan."</p>

  <p>He emphasized "very" twice in a row, which made Zheng feel strange.</p>

  <p>Hayden noticed that Zheng looked confused as he spoke. Therefore, he asked,</p>

  <p>"Is it your first time to take part in the debate? Do you know how this debate goes?"</p>
