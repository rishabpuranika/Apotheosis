  <p>Eddie's actual motive for pacing quite slowly was to prod into it.</p>

  <p>Out of everyone he knew, there were only two people that Eddie had always been truly heedful of. One of them was Imogen Yu, and the other was an Ancient Tycoon who was in World Commercial Alliance, someone who had lived for more than 1, 700 years! If it weren't for the Ancient Tycoon's existence, Imogen would be the sole being at the Martial Arts Contest that could make Eddie have some second thoughts.</p>

  <p>Xander, along with the leader of the Mysterious Luna Hall, could pose a threat for Eddie to some degree, but given that the situation didn't really have anything to do with their sects, they would have no reason to get involved.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the Ancient Tycoon from the World Commercial Alliance had unexpectedly shown himself.</p>

  <p>Eddie had his eyebrows deeply knit.</p>

  <p>If it turned out being a one-on-one battle, he was confident that he could defeat any of the leaders of these fourth and fifth-grade sects, and probably even the Ancient Tycoon in the World Commercial Alliance. But confronting all of those people at the same time would put him at a disadvantage.</p>

  <p>Let's say that the three heads of the World Commercial Alliance were to team up against him, which would already give Eddie quite a hard time. But now, even Imogen had appeared and then to make it even worse, that millennia-old monster made an appearance.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to say no one has to bear the brunt for my disciple's death?"</p>

  <p>Eddie pried. Indeed, he might have been the mightiest warrior in Central Region, but here in Oracle City, a place that was brimming with lots of experts, he had been backed into a corner and forced to give in.</p>

  <p>"An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth. But there's really no need for you to resolve the dispute caused in the fighting arena right here in Oracle City, right? No one would bat an eye whatever it is that you choose to do outside the city." The elderly man from the World Commercial Alliance had his legs crossed as he hovered in the air, shrouded in a plain white garment without any embellishments. It had been patched up too much, making it apparent that it had been worn for a number of years.</p>

  <p>"Is that how it is?" Eddie jeered at his answer. Promptly, he shot Ning Yudie a quick glance and let out a big smile. "I've taken an interest in tearing down Cloud Hall. How does that sound?"</p>

  <p>"That's none of our business," the old man flatly said.</p>

  <p>"Okay then." Eddie turned his gaze over to two of his underlings and dispatched them to enter the fighting stage in order to retrieve Marilyn's body. Then, he picked Yan up along with another woman and was about to go his way.</p>

  <p>"Wait just a second." Luo Zheng finally talked again.</p>

  <p>Eddie turned his head to look over at Luo Zheng, wearing a serious look on his face.</p>

  <p>"You won't kill Yan, right?" Luo Zheng anxiously asked him.</p>

  <p>Eddie simply sneered at him but didn't answer, acting as though Luo Zheng had no right to be asking him such a thing.</p>

  <p>He had already been gone for a while, but the pressure he let out still lingered.</p>

  <p>Eddie had no one to turn to. Cloud Hall and the World Commercial Alliance had deeply displeased him. For that reason, Eddie vowed to get his revenge in due time.</p>

  <p>'Everything that happened has been caused by the young man in the Illuminating Soul Realm. Could this all be worth it? It better be.' This was what every single person out there had in mind.</p>

  <p>The moment Xiao took off the enchanted barriers on the arena, he marveled at the ruins of the fighting stage with a dreadful look on his face. So much damage had befallen the arena. Could the following challenges proceed with the stage in this state?</p>

  <p>That being the case, right after the enchanted barriers disappeared, Imogen Yu took a step forward, stumbling a little bit. With that, she had instantly gotten in front of Luo Zheng, and the walking stick she was holding had already swept Luo Zheng across his chest!</p>

  <p>Bam!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, who had been suddenly hit by the crutch without warning, was instantly sent flying, landing heavily over to the side of the platform. His body had been lodged into the platform and the ground surrounding him was teeming with cracks.</p>

  <p>"Master..." Ning Yudie screamed in surprise, watching as Luo Zheng had been rammed by her master.</p>

  <p>"Eddie is certainly far from being a decent person. I can say for sure that Cloud Hall will be facing his eternal wrath in the future without question.</p>

  <p>With that, how will we be able to live in peace? How can we thrive?"</p>

  <p>Although her face had aged considerably, it had been filled with intense rage as she said that.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng got up from the platform and said with steeled resolve. "Weren't you the one who told me Marilyn would participate in this Martial Arts Contest?"</p>

  <p>"I never asked Ning Yudie to get herself involved and put everyone in Cloud Hall at risk!" Imogen furiously retorted.</p>

  <p>That day, when Imogen got the idea that Luo Zheng would end up killing Marilyn, she honestly didn't think that Ning Yudie would be there as well.</p>

  <p>If Ning Yudie didn't get herself involved by standing up to Eddie, Imogen had no plans of showing up whatsoever. Luo Zheng was indeed a remarkable guy, but Eddie was simply on a league of his own, and much, much more frightening. Cloud Hall was not capable of taking care of Eddie by themselves. The day Eddie finally came to take his revenge, how on earth could the Cloud Hall hope to deal with him?</p>

  <p>However, it wasn't fair for Imogen to place all of the blame on Luo Zheng. When all was said and done, Luo Zheng did not ask Ning Yudie for help at all. It was Ning Yudie who decided that and ended up upsetting Eddie.</p>

  <p>Truth be told, Imogen was fully aware that she had no right to blame Luo Zheng for what had transpired that day. Ning Yudie was the one who was so stubborn and determined to make a stand, but she had always been indulging Ning Yudie on everything, so there was no way she could go on and release her anger on her. And as a result, it was Luo Zheng who unfortunately ended up taking the blow instead.</p>

  <p>This showed that Ning Yudie had saved Zheng's life in a way, and Luo Zheng had taken one for Ning Yudie. At the end of it all, Luo Zheng still actually got something out of it.</p>

  <p>If the primordial energy that had been produced after he had gotten hit by the cane were to be taken into consideration, then he might have just made himself a fortune.</p>
