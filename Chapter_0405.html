  <p>After the cheers had died down, suddenly, there was a young man standing and walking in the air step by step, with both hands on his back.</p>

  <p>It seemed that there were some transparent stairs in the air so that Vale could step on them. And every time he took a step, a lotus flower bloomed right under his foot. Steps with lotus flowers! Those lotus flowers made Vale look gentle and aristocratic. Showing off indeed!</p>

  <p>A great number of inner disciples were amazed at what they saw when Vale walked on the lotus flowers. Although most of them knew clearly that it wasn't difficult for him to do so since he had reached the Illuminating Soul Realm, but the great power and presence when he stepped on the lotus flowers shocked everyone anyhow.</p>

  <p>Amid the shock, a long scream was heard from the many female disciples of the Lady Peak. Vale's appearance had produced a kind of galvanization on the battlefield.</p>

  <p>Sitting in the group of personal disciples, Tracy Mo pouted and sneered with a cold smile on her face, "What a disgusting man! What does he think of himself, a prince or something? Why does he always show up like this?"</p>

  <p>After hearing Tracy's words, Patrick, who was sitting right next to her joked, "So do you want to poke some holes on his body, Tracy?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I do! If I get a chance to compete with him on the battlefield, I am definitely going to poke more than a few big holes on his body!</p>

  <p>He's such a poser every time he shows up! I am going to leave him in such a state that he won't be able to pose anymore!" Tracy replied resentfully, still pouting.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stood motionless on the battlefield. He kept silent as he looked up at Vale, who was coming down slowly in the air.</p>

  <p>After he had stepped down on the battlefield, Vale greeted him with a smile on his lips, "How do you do, Luo Luo Zheng? It's beyond my expectation that you can take part in the All Peaks Competition in such a short time!</p>

  <p>What a surprise! I still remember what I said when we met on the Hell Mountain. I told you that I would give you three years to practice so that you have the strength to compete with me, but only half a year has passed till now. Don't worry, I'll show you mercy today. You don't need to look or act like you are facing a formidable enemy."</p>

  <p>"Show me mercy? A formidable enemy?" Luo Luo Zheng repeated what Vale had said just now and suddenly burst into laughter. "Hahaha...Vale, you know that was a nice joke!"</p>

  <p>With an astonished look on his face, Vale asked, "What joke?"</p>

  <p>"First, I don't need you to show me mercy! You are not qualified to do that! Second, I'm not regarding you as a formidable enemy! I'm just in a bad mood when I think about my sister Yan being grounded in the Hell Mountain to this day and you still in your fucking dreams! You want to sleep with my sister! I'm just not happy with that, you know? I look like this because I'm not happy, rather than what you said. I'm facing a formidable enemy, huh!" Luo Luo Zheng replied and sneered.</p>

  <p>A burst of noise came from the crowd after Luo Luo Zheng finished his words.</p>

  <p>He had spoken word by word, so everyone present had heard what he said clearly.</p>

  <p>At first, they were confused why Luo Luo Zheng had suddenly become so arrogant.</p>

  <p>He had always kept a low profile in the previous competitions, and had always kept silent. But now, he suddenly looked different. He was arrogant and conceited right now!</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng finished his words, the crowd finally learned the reason behind his anger, and they were extremely amazed to find out.</p>

  <p>"What? Vale wants to sleep with Luo Zheng's sister? Who is his sister?"</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng talked about his sister just now! His sister is Yan!"</p>

  <p>"Who is Yan? That girl who is still grounded on the Hell Mountain? Oh my god! Yan is Luo Zheng's little sister? I can't believe it! What fantastic geniuses they are! Yan is a girl of terrible power, and her brother is even more powerful than her!"</p>

  <p>Some disciples whispered in the crowd.</p>

  <p>People in the Eastern Region liked to practice martial arts, but the vast majority of them were male. This was evident from the fact there was only one Lady Peak for female disciples out of the thirty three peaks in the Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>Female martial artists didn't play an important part in the Eastern Region. After all, male martial artists far outnumbered the female ones, so a female genius in the field was several times less likely than a male.</p>

  <p>For the same reason, female disciples were regarded as underdogs all the time.</p>

  <p>But Yan didn't fit the stereotype of a traditional female disciple. Such terrible was her power that once, with her efforts, Lady Peak had managed to land itself on the second number among all thirty three peaks, when it was famous for always ranking last.</p>

  <p>Although there were many legends in the Cloud Sect, almost all such records had been created by male disciples. Yan became an exception to this when she led Lady Peak. With her extraordinary talent, excellent strength and amazing beauty, she crushed almost all the disciples and stood at the top of the list in the Cloud Sect!</p>

  <p>What made people feel even more awed was that Yan was less than fifteen years old when she had created the legend!</p>

  <p>What an awesome genius she was!</p>

  <p>Most of the disciples knew about the existence of Yan, but they did not know the details behind her story. No one knew exactly how Yan had offended the Yun family and why she was grounded in the Hell Mountain after the All Peaks Competition that year. It was said that Yan committed a crime and was immured on the Hell Mountain.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng got the information from Wurth when he was investigating what had happened to his sister earlier on. No one had more news than Wurth did in the Burning Sky Empire. He was a well-informed man.</p>

  <p>Paying no attention to what the other disciples were talking about, Luo Luo Zheng looked at Vale and continued, "As for the fucking appointed competition three years later! You made the appointment yourself! How dare you appoint a competition with me like that? Do you really think you have the ability to compete with me after I practice for three years straight? I would have definitely improved in that time, and you wouldn't be qualified to fight with me after that! But you know what, let's forget the three-year-later appointment and come back to this competition now! Do you think you have the ability to win the competition today?"</p>

  <p>As a personal disciple, Vale couldn't maintain his smile anymore, even though that was his usual style. He had been insulted by Luo Luo Zheng in the All Peaks Competition just now. Or, to put it bluntly, he was degraded and despised by Luo Luo Zheng in front of the hundreds of thousands of disciples of the Cloud Sect. He stared at Luo Luo Zheng with burning eyes, as if he wanted to cut him into pieces with his mere gaze. "Good! That's very good! There is a saying that the younger generation will surpass the older. That's great!"</p>
