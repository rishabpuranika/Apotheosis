  <p>
</p>

  <p>"It worked!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng squealed as he stared down at the fire lion.</p>

  <p>This lion emitted purple flames as it contained the Heavenly Destiny of Devouring Kindling. But when Luo Luo Zheng cut off the Heavenly Destiny within it, the purple flames died down and eventually, disappeared.</p>

  <p>As the fire lion jumped back onto the screen, a pleased grin spread across Luo Xiao's face.</p>

  <p>Although the Enemy Repelling Arts might seem easy, it was extremely difficult for anyone to truly grasp the essence of it. It amazed Luo Xiao that Luo Luo Zheng was able to comprehend the Profound Cause-eliminating Technique of the book so quickly.</p>

  <p>In this moment, Luo Xiao gently waved his hand across the screen and it flickered with a golden light. Just then, the Annihilation Thunder and the wind eagle once again shot towards Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes focused at the sight of the two Heavenly Destinies.</p>

  <p>He stretched out his arm grasping the sword and a light immediately surged out. "Cut them for me!"</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The Causality Breaking Light had become ultimate foe of all the Heavenly Destinies. The flashing light soon disappeared, and the wind eagle that was charging towards Luo Luo Zheng let out a mournful cry. The Spirit of Wind was cut off by him. It turned into a chaotic gust of wind and returned to the screen without hesitation.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's sword had also been struck by the fierce Annihilation Thunder.</p>

  <p>When the light collided with the lighting, the latter lost its color and fled back to the screen.</p>

  <p>Luo Xiao nodded in satisfaction and said, "Although the Enemy Repelling Arts retains itself well against the Laws of Causality, things will be totally different while you are fighting against the Supreme Lords. This will get much more complicated, so take extra care."</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Destinies that Luo Xiao activated were in their most basic forms. After the Supreme Lords received their own Heavenly Destinies, they might have overused their Heavenly Destinies and brought them to their limits. When the Supreme Lords used the Laws of Causality, the power proved to be unimaginable. No doubt Luo Luo Zheng would have difficulty destroying the causalities.</p>

  <p>After Luo Xiao expressed his thoughts, he waved his hand once again.</p>

  <p>The two screens on both sides of the path began to shine with beams of golden light. One by one, each of the Heavenly Destinies was activated just by a wave of his hand.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>The energy that emanated caused the whole path to tremble vigorously.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords simultaneously raised their heads to look at the sky, their faces filled with bewilderment.</p>

  <p>The heavens didn't seem normal today.</p>

  <p>As soon as Luo Luo Zheng cultivated Enemy Repelling Arts, the heavens began to shake drastically. Originally, they thought that a Supreme Lord had died, but the shaking never stopped. It was continuous, and frightened many.</p>

  <p>If the shock was really because of the deaths of Supreme Lords, then the way the heavens shook seemed like all of the one hundred and twenty-eight Supreme Lords perished. Why did the shock last this long?</p>

  <p>"What's happening up there?"</p>

  <p>"This is unlike anything we've ever seen before."</p>

  <p>"I can only hope that it wasn't the Sacred race who started this!"</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords were left to guess about the mesmerizing shakes.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, although the Supreme Lords could take guesses about what was happening, they couldn't pry in the mysteries of the heavens.</p>

  <p>Until now no one in the Evolutionary Universe, except Luo Luo Zheng and Irene, had ever set foot on the path of heavens. That was no place for creatures of the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>Little did they know, the shaking was due to Luo Zheng's training.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Destinies on the screens were constantly moving in and out of different shapes. Some of them only had certain abilities and could not be made into specific targets. However, regardless of their forms and abilities, they kept rushing towards Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng and his sword seemed as if they were dancing, swiftly and gracefully, as strands of cyan light appeared where the tip of the sword swept past. These strands of cyan light were like hemps that wrapped around his entire body.</p>

  <p>All the Heavenly Destinies approaching Luo Luo Zheng were instantly severed as they turned into golden beams of light and returned to the screens.</p>

  <p>The "Cutting the Cause" was one move he completely comprehended.</p>

  <p>The causalities contained within these Heavenly Destinies were considered the highest level of power. However, they didn't stand a chance to Luo Zheng's sword.</p>

  <p>And even though Luo Luo Zheng had fully mastered the "Cutting the Cause," Luo Xiao wasn't at ease at all.</p>

  <p>At first, he was quite happy with his son's achievements. But this happiness soon turned into worry as he saw his son in battle.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>After the last Heavenly Destiny was finally severed, Luo Zheng's long sword circled in the air and he placed it smoothly into his space ring. Then after, he turned to Luo Xiao and noticed his expression. He asked with concern, "Father, what's wrong?"</p>

  <p>His father was normally very dignified, so seeing that his expression was so gloomy made Luo Luo Zheng wonder what was on his mind.</p>

  <p>Luo Xiao didn't avoid his question. Instead, he looked at Luo Luo Zheng and explained,</p>

  <p>"As the number one Godly Genius of the universe, you have the protection of the Celestial Position race and my support. But son, I have seen you go through much trials in this universe. Yes, everything went well..."</p>

  <p>Luo Xiao paused for a moment before he continued, "However, if the Evolutionary Universe passes this difficult trial, then you will have to enter the divine land in the future. There, all of your encounters won't be as easy."</p>

  <p>The battles Luo Luo Zheng had faced in the past few years could be described as dangerous and brutal. Many of them had actually been secretly arranged by Luo Xiao himself. However, Luo Xiao never failed to protect his son all throughout.</p>

  <p>In his eyes, Luo Luo Zheng was still a little boy. He never failed to pick Luo Luo Zheng up from a fall, and always made sure that Luo Luo Zheng would not perish.</p>

  <p>But despite this fatherly love, Luo Luo Zheng eventually would grow up and leave the universe.</p>

  <p>In the Evolutionary Universe, Luo Xiao was the ruler, the omniscient and omnipotent lord. This place was also known as Luo Zheng's home.</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng really stepped into the divine land, then Luo Xiao knew he wouldn't be able to help him again. Who would be able to help Luo Luo Zheng then?</p>

  <p>The divine land was a real and different world.</p>

  <p>Even a Holy Being couldn't just transform the entire divine land. Once Luo Luo Zheng stepped into the divine land, the brutal competition would begin.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had to start a new life and make sure that he kept his eyes open for any danger.</p>

  <p>"Father, is it because of Murphy Mu?" Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Luo Xiao's meaning was very similar to Murphy's. For Luo Luo Zheng to be able to run around the Evolutionary Universe, his father was also a major role in this. It wouldn't be so simple in the divine land.</p>

  <p>"No." Luo Xiao shook his head. "Murphy spoke only of the truth. The divine land will be even more difficult for you. If you enter and find yourself unable to help me, please don't push yourself too much."</p>

  <p>Knowingly, the purpose of Luo Xiao's training for Luo Luo Zheng was to save himself.</p>

  <p>And since then, Luo Luo Zheng had never failed to live up to his expectations. At times, maybe even exceeded them.</p>

  <p>At this point, Luo Xiao had a thought of calling everything off. He didn't want Luo Luo Zheng to take the risk of going against the Hall of Holy Beings for him. Thinking about it, he'd prefer Luo Luo Zheng to stay somewhere safe in the divine land and live a normal life.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's expression darkened at his father's words. He shot his eyes up at Luo Xiao and said, "According to you, why don't I give up now?"</p>

  <p>"Give up now?" Luo Xiao's expression froze.</p>

  <p>"Father, this is what you trained me for. I must try my best to save you. If you didn't care about living or dying, why did we go through all of this in the first place? What's the point of the path of martial arts that I've always followed?" Luo Luo Zheng said and stared at Luo Xiao.</p>

  <p>Seeing the look in Luo Zheng's eyes, Luo Xiao was stunned to hear these words come out of his son's mouth.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was right.</p>

  <p>Luo Xiao asked Luo Luo Zheng to give up because he loved his son and didn't want him to suffer, but this was much more than that.</p>

  <p>Pursuing martial arts was always motivated by something. Not by comfort, not by riches, but for something far greater than that. Luo Luo Zheng knew what he had to do, and this was not something he could be talked out of.</p>

  <p>Though Luo Luo Zheng understood his father's concerns, he was sure he had to do this.</p>

  <p>There was no turning back now.</p>
