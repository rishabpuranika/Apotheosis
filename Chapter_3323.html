</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade Spirit quietly observed the two humans that stood before it.</p>

  <p>Although the Regal Jade race was vastly different from the human race, it could tell that Elvinia was not suitable to take charge of the Civilization Artifact.</p>

  <p>"We have been waiting for too long. It's not the first time that creatures have come to visit us over the years," the Regal Jade Spirit sighed. "The one most suitable to control the Civilization Artifact is not a purified being, but someone who cultivates the Ways-blending Energy. You are not suitable for the role. So, please leave."</p>

  <p>The warriors at the Other Shore Realm in the thirteen stages of the Lust World were far from reaching the Chaotic Source Realm, so it was impossible for them to take the time to cultivate the Ways-blending Energy.</p>

  <p>Even in the Source World, only top-level masters of the super powers, like Fuxi and Chiyou, could master the 3, 000 Godly Ways.</p>

  <p>The members of the Regal Jade Civilization had been hiding in the Lust World, so it was impossible for them to find a suitable person.</p>

  <p>However, because they lived inside the Regal Jade City, they were immortal.</p>

  <p>It didn't matter whether the chaos was destroyed or created; the Other Shore would not be affected.</p>

  <p>Hence, they were in no rush to select the person they wanted.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The moment the Regal Jade Spirit had finished speaking, Zheng gathered the internal momentum in his inner world. A blazing white light shot out in front of the Regal Jade Spirit.</p>

  <p>"Is this the Ways-blending Energy you were talking about?" Zheng asked with a smile.</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade Spirit was taken aback. At a glance, it made an accurate judgment. "2, 994 Godly Ways! You fused them?!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, you could say that," replied Zheng calmly.</p>

  <p>Zheng had been continuously fusing the Godly Ways in the divine land.</p>

  <p>However, the more progress he made, the more difficult it became.</p>

  <p>Moreover, he had been busy lately, so he had failed to make further progress.</p>

  <p>However, the Evil God had helped Zheng a lot. It was easy for him to cultivate the Godly Ways that the Evil God had fused, so he was quickly able to fuse 2, 994 Godly Ways.</p>

  <p>"Interesting!" The Regal Jade Spirit eyed Zheng from head to toe. "You are not a purified being. You stay in the Dark Region by eating Darkness Fruits, right?"</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded in reply.</p>

  <p>"But a Wild God is weak," the Regal Jade Spirit said with a hint of regret.</p>

  <p>"You are still not qualified."</p>

  <p>In the eyes of the Regal Jade Spirit, the most suitable person was not only a purified being, but also a creature that specialized in merging Godly Ways.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng had practiced the merging of the Godly Ways, his own strength alone was not enough. Moreover, compared to a purified being, the Wild God was at least two levels weaker.</p>

  <p>Even though the Regal Jade Spirit had rejected Zheng, it suddenly released a cyan light that scanned Zheng's body to assess his physical strength.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>As the cyan light swept across Zheng's body, the Regal Jade Spirit gasped.</p>

  <p>"How can this be?"</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?" Zheng asked, brows knitted.</p>

  <p>"You haven't mastered the Truth of Powerful Holy Body!" The Regal Jade Spirit was surprised. "What's going on? Although you are a Wild God, you didn't cultivate the Truth of Powerful Holy Body. Then how did you get your body to the Other Shore?"</p>

  <p>There were some exceptions in the world, and Zheng was one of them.</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade Spirit had thought that it had seen through everything, but now, it was obvious it had never seen anybody like Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Well..." Zheng scratched his head, at a loss for words.</p>

  <p>He could feel that his body contained a Truth of Godly Way, but he couldn't tell what it was exactly.</p>

  <p>"The strength of your body is far beyond that of a Wild God, but not as strong as that of a purified being." The Regal Jade Spirit wavered.</p>

  <p>All of the members of the Regal Jade Civilization had sealed themselves up and fallen into a deep sleep. It could turn to no one for advice, and could only make the judgment on its own.</p>

  <p>If it were to give the Civilization Artifact to Zheng, it meant that Zheng would hold the core to the Regal Jade Civilization. Needless to say, it had to be careful before making any rash decisions.</p>

  <p>Zheng stood there in silence, waiting patiently.</p>

  <p>If it was anything else, Zheng wouldn't have much interest in it.</p>

  <p>However, since it was related to the secret of the Ways-blending Energy, he couldn't let it go. Especially since the Regal Jade Spirit mentioned the three flaws, he needed to know if he could make up for them.</p>

  <p>"I suppose I can give you a chance," the Regal Jade Spirit finally said with a firm nod. "You can merge with the Civilization Artifact!"</p>

  <p>As soon as the Regal Jade Spirit finished speaking, the chaotic void enveloping Zheng and Elvinia disappeared. They returned to the high platform. The diamond-shaped Civilization Artifact emitted a green luster as it floated towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>It was very clear that it wanted Zheng to integrate it into his body directly.</p>

  <p>However, try as he might, Zheng's body was unable to merge with the Other Shore Token. To be exact, he didn't know how to merge the Other Shore Token with his body. He said, "I'm afraid I can't merge with the Civilization Artifact here. Can I bring it to the outside of the Dark Region?"</p>

  <p>As long as he left the Dark Region, he would be able to return to the Other Shore with his soul.</p>

  <p>Among the three Truths of Godly Ways he had been practicing, the Truth of Cultivation Nature was left empty.</p>

  <p>In fact, Zheng's purpose for this trip to the Dark Region was to merge an Other Shore Token with his Truth of Cultivation Nature. However, his adventures in the Dark Region almost caused him to die.</p>

  <p>"Sure," the voice of the Regal Jade Spirit echoed from the Civilization Artifact.</p>

  <p>Zheng then turned to Elvinia to ask her to activate her space ring. He was going to store the Civilization Artifact in it.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, shadows darted towards them in the darkness.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>"Those damned black monkeys are here!" Zheng cried irritably.</p>

  <p>The black monkeys had been shocked at the discovery of the Regal Jade City.</p>

  <p>While the Regal Jade Civilization was very little known, by instinct, they could tell that this was something extraordinary. Thus, they decided to wait and lurk in the darkness.</p>

  <p>As soon as the Regal Jade Spirit lifted the illusion, the black monkeys rushed into the Regal Jade City and headed straight for the tower.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The golden Sanskrit words shone on the yellow paper plastered on the bodies of three black monkeys.</p>

  <p>With the reinforcement of the light, each black monkey moved with astonishing power and speed.</p>

  <p>The black monkey in the lead launched itself directly onto Zheng, trying to yank the Civilization Artifact out of his hand. Elvinia, who was standing next to Zheng, bared her teeth angrily.</p>

  <p>She hated the pig-faced monsters and the black monkeys instinctively. She remembered previously, those monkeys had chased them all the way to the valley.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!" she screamed with a murderous look.</p>

  <p>As she raised her hand, a bright light shot out towards the black monkeys.</p>

  <p>Whack!</p>

  <p>She managed to strike one of the black monkeys. The yellow paper on its body burst into flames.</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, the yellow paper had blocked the light for a moment. The black monkey rushed to Zheng with flames.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>The Civilization Artifact was knocked out of Zheng's hand. It plunged down from the tower.</p>

  <p>"It falls!"</p>

  <p>"We must get it!"</p>

  <p>The other two monkeys ignored their companion and immediately leapt off the tower to chase after the Civilization Artifact.</p>
