</p>

  <p>Quickly moving, Akshay stepped forward and picked Frida up, throwing her in the air and letting out a cheer.</p>

  <p>All over the square, the Nine Li members also started to cheer.</p>

  <p>Talent was bestowed by the bloodline and the races had to maintain their power. That was why this world had a strong sense of racial crisis.</p>

  <p>The result of the test proved that Frida was a worthy successor. It was a cause for a huge celebration since within this thousand years, only two people had the sixth grade blood, and Frida was the only one who had the quasi-seventh grade blood. Naturally, this was something worth celebrating!</p>

  <p>The still dazed Frida had no idea on what was happening.</p>

  <p>Then it was her brother's turn.</p>

  <p>The method was the same as the Grand Elder pierced Jeffery's finger to get a few drops of blood and then threw them on the jade.</p>

  <p>"Plop..."</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>As the blood was absorbed by the jade, it began to shake once more and its color began to turn red.</p>

  <p>It was changing but it was very slow.</p>

  <p>Akshay and all the other Nine Li members stared at the jade nervously.</p>

  <p>"Jeffery's blood isn't good..."</p>

  <p>"It's been so long but his blood is only at the second grade. I'm afraid it won't reach the third grade."</p>

  <p>"Well... a dragon can have nine different sons, and brothers born of the same parents differ from each other; even purity of boy-girl twins' blood would greatly differ."</p>

  <p>It took a few more moments but eventually, the Grand Elder announced,</p>

  <p>"Jeffery's blood is at the third grade."</p>

  <p>Unlike earlier, Akshay silently stepped forward to pick up Jeffery and gently pat his back. Blood purity was largely decided by luck and no one could change it. It was already a great blessing from God to have Frida in his family.</p>

  <p>After their turn, the rest of the people carried their children over to undergo the same test.</p>

  <p>Most of the other children had blood that was third grade to fifth grade.</p>

  <p>Third grade was average but fifth grade was outstanding.</p>

  <p>Those who were graded as just the standard would feel depressed, while those who were graded outstanding would feel excited.</p>

  <p>It was the normal situation for every blood purity test and the Grand Elder was used to seeing it, so she remained calm and composed.</p>

  <p>When the test was almost over, the Grand Elder turned to Luo Zheng. "It's your turn!"</p>

  <p>It made her very interested in whether Luo Zheng owned Chiyou's blood or not.</p>

  <p>Slowly, Luo Zheng walked up to the oval jade and looked at it up and down.</p>

  <p>From what he saw, the jade would turn red after it absorbed blood and then turn milky white again after a while. The deeper the red color, the purer the blood was.</p>

  <p>The problem was Luo Zheng had golden blood. Would the jade still work?</p>

  <p>The Grand Elder smiled at him. "Give me your hand."</p>

  <p>"Can I do it myself?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>The Grand Elder shook her head and grabbed Luo Zheng's arm. She condensed a milky white fine needle in her palm and shot it out towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, what happened next surprised the Grand Elder.</p>

  <p>There was a clank and the light needle couldn't pierce Luo Zheng's finger!</p>

  <p>"Eh?"</p>

  <p>It wasn't within the Grand Elder's expectation that Luo Zheng was so strong that the needle wouldn't be able to break through his finger's skin! It made her stare at him in shock.</p>

  <p>A trace of a helpless smile appeared on Luo Zheng's face. "I said that I could do it myself..."</p>

  <p>Instead of answering him, the Grand Elder just condensed another needle that was several times more powerful than the one before.</p>

  <p>"Ding!"</p>

  <p>The needle still failed to pierce Luo Zheng's finger!</p>

  <p>It was unbelievable! But the Grand Elder was still unconvinced after she stared at Luo Zheng for several seconds and condensed another needle that spiraled up from the white light. It emitted an astonishing power.</p>

  <p>The light needle flew towards Luo Zheng's finger and it finally managed to pierce it.</p>

  <p>"Plop! Plop! Plop..."</p>

  <p>"Golden blood?" The Grand Elder was a little surprised.</p>

  <p>Even Giacomo, Erik, and other Nine Li members who saw the golden blood felt strange because they had never seen blood of that color.</p>

  <p>The Grand Elder didn't think too much and splashed the golden blood on the jade.</p>

  <p>When it absorbed the golden blood, the jade gave a buzzing sound.</p>

  <p>Eventually, the jade's color began to change...</p>

  <p>"It's turning red!"</p>

  <p>"Does this boy really have the blood of our Nine Li race?"</p>

  <p>"But the color is changing so slowly. I really doubt that his blood could reach the second grade!"</p>

  <p>All the Nine Li members began to gossip as they stared at the changing jade.</p>

  <p>It excited Erik to see the jade changing color. "Hahaha... Giacomo, you're not bad! The boy you brought back really has our blood. It's a pity that his blood's only at the second grade. It's not that good..."</p>

  <p>As long as it proved that Luo Zheng had Chiyou's blood then they didn't need to transplant blood into Luo Zheng. It was a good thing for Erik.</p>

  <p>Instead of answering Erik, Giacomo frowned at the jade because he felt that this matter wasn't that simple.</p>

  <p>After about half a minute, the surface of the jade was still glowing with a faint pink light.</p>

  <p>"The blood of this man from the wilderness isn't good. Is it a son left behind by one of our clansmen?"</p>

  <p>"A second grade blood is too ordinary..."</p>

  <p>"He should feel content. It's good fortune for him that he could stay in a bone tower for the rest of his life!"</p>

  <p>There was a hint of disappointment that flashed through the Grand Elder's eyes. She wasn't satisfied with the result but she still just smiled.</p>

  <p>"Congratulations. You do have the blood of our race but it's a pity that your grade is too low."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng wasn't too disappointed.</p>

  <p>Even if his mother told him that he had the purest blood of the Nine Li race and that he was the most legitimate descendant of Chiyou, that didn't change the fact that his blood had been exchanged. Luo Zheng could accept this result.</p>

  <p>As long as he could prove himself to the Nine Li race and stay then his goal was achieved.</p>

  <p>Right when Luo Zheng nodded, the jade beside him suddenly let out a crisp sound.</p>

  <p>All eyes turned to the jade.</p>

  <p>A blood red crack appeared on the surface of the jade!</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>With every explosive sound, a new blood red fracture ruptured on the jade.</p>

  <p>It took only a few more moments for the surface of the flawless white jade to be filled with bloody cracks.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>The color of the jade started to quickly change as it shook.</p>

  <p>The previous pale pink color gradually turned bright red and then became dark red, as if blood was bleeding from the jade's surface!</p>

  <p>"Crack! Crack! Crack..."</p>

  <p>Soon, the jade broke into pieces right in front of their eyes.</p>

  <p>The noisy square suddenly fell silent as everyone was confused by the unexpected scene.</p>

  <p>The jade was bestowed by a powerful master of the Nine Li race and endured years of blood purity tests. It was unanticipated that the jade would break into pieces today.</p>

  <p> </p>
