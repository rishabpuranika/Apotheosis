<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3696 The Captain Of The Black Ship </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The following days were busy. The Oneness Sky Palace was focused on clearing up the battlefield.</p>

  <p>Emperor Charm and the Bearing race had only managed to destroy the Oneness Mountain and the Dragon City, and the Phoenix Palace had suffered the most damages.</p>

  <p>Majority of the palace was smashed to pieces. They had no other choice but to rebuild it.</p>

  <p>A few days had passed before the reinforcements from the Pear Hill finally arrived.</p>

  <p>Before the Sun Crow race even launched their general attack, the Oneness Sky Palace had already sensed the unrest and sent for the Pear Hill, asking them for help.</p>

  <p>However, the distance between the Pear Hill and the Bloom Divine Province was too long.</p>

  <p>Besides, the real problem didn't lie in the distance. Just as the reinforcements of the Pear Hill were about to embark on the journey to the Bloom Divine Province, powerful warriors of the Divine Farmer race suddenly showed up in the north of their territory to wreak havoc.</p>

  <p>But once the warriors of the Pear Hill showed up to face the Divine Farmer race, they quickly retreated.</p>

  <p>It then became clear to them that the Divine Farmer race had just distracted them from helping the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>But even then, they could do nothing about it.</p>

  <p>Fuxi had left the Source World because of something important, while the Snake Goddess was busy trying to rescue Eastern Emperor Taiyi from the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>The Divine Farmer race repeated the operation for several times. Their powerful warriors neither launched attacks nor fled away. They just dawdled along the north area, taunting the Pear Hill teasingly.</p>

  <p>Although there were also many powerful warriors in the Pear Hill, they couldn't risk leaving it unguarded.</p>

  <p>It was not until the powerful warriors of the Divine Farmer race retreated that they dispatched over sixty people to the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>However, the battle in the Oneness Sky Palace had already come to an end by the time they arrived. When they heard the news that Emperor Charm had been killed, the powerful warriors from the Pear Hill were shocked.</p>

  <p>In their opinion, if Emperor Charm came to the Bloom Divine Province in person, only the Snake Goddess and Fuxi themselves were strong enough to defeat him.</p>

  <p>To their surprise, however, it seemed that the Oneness Sky Palace had defeated Emperor Charm on their own.</p>

  <p>Pearce smiled at them hospitably, but he didn't tell them all the details.</p>

  <p>In his mind, what had happened to Zheng was inconceivable. Even if these things were to be disclosed, the only one who should talk about it was Eastern Emperor Taiyi himself.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, from outside the chaos, everything was covered in darkness.</p>

  <p>No light, no matter how strong, could illuminate it.</p>

  <p>Even if thousands of suns were thrown into the chaos, they would only look like specks of dust amidst the darkness.</p>

  <p>There were, however, chaos clouds that emitted faint, brown light.</p>

  <p>Among these chaos clouds lurked a huge Black Ship.</p>

  <p>The Black Ships had always been notorious for being hard to find.</p>

  <p>This one was a little special.</p>

  <p>The front end of the ship was made of seven-star obsidian stones, and on both sides of the ship, there were blurry words carved. They looked like enlarged Sanskrit words.</p>

  <p>Swoosh...</p>

  <p>Just as the Black Ship emerged from the chaos clouds, a huge set of Eight Diagrams suddenly appeared in front of it.</p>

  <p>The Black Ship's path was blocked. It had no choice but to stop above the chaos clouds. As the Eight Diagrams spun furiously, Fuxi appeared behind.</p>

  <p>"Eight Diagrams Rope!"</p>

  <p>Fuxi shouted.</p>

  <p>Eight sets of the Eight Diagrams quickly appeared on all sides of the Black Ship, firmly holding the Black Ship to the spot.</p>

  <p>In terms of strength, Fuxi was confident he could defeat any Eternal Warrior in the Source World, even this mysterious captain of this Black Ship.</p>

  <p>But Fuxi had an Achilles' heel? his speed was ever so slightly inferior.</p>

  <p>The reason why the Thunder Dimorphodon had managed to escape from Fuxi's grasp was because of its avatars and speed.</p>

  <p>If Fuxi had managed to catch the Thunder Dimorphodon, one punch from him and it would be dead.</p>

  <p>This time, however, Fuxi had learned from his previous mistakes. The minute he determined the location of the captain, he immediately trapped him.</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish!</p>

  <p>A wisp of black smoke suddenly floated, rolling continuously till it formed the silhouette of a hooded cloak. The figure wearing the cloak could not be seen clearly.</p>

  <p>In fact, no one had ever seen what the captain actually looked like.</p>

  <p>His existence was more of a symbol, even in the eyes of the members of the Black Ship.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I didn't know the Human Sovereign was visiting. What can I do for you?" the captain asked flatly.</p>

  <p>"The Descending Rings of our Chaotic Source World were taken away by the Thunder Dimorphodon," Fuxi answered coldly.</p>

  <p>"Human Sovereign," the captain replied indifferently. "Then you can find the Thunder Dimorphodon and take them back from it."</p>

  <p>Fuxi snorted. Raising his hand, he threw something into the air.</p>

  <p>A ring unfolded, from which a huge bat's head slowly fell out.</p>

  <p>When the person in the hooked cloak saw the bat's head, his body trembled slightly. The Thunder Dimorphodon, one of the top ten ferocious beasts in the chaos, had been killed by Fuxi?</p>

  <p>"Just because I haven't made a move in years, some idiots have already forgotten their place," Fuxi snarled. "They must be tired of living." As soon as he finished speaking, Fuxi threw a punch at the bat's head.</p>

  <p>A fist mark with the shadow of Eight Diagrams was imprinted on the bat's head.</p>

  <p>"Pop!"</p>

  <p>The Thunder Dimorphodon's head instantly burst into fine powder.</p>

  <p>The top ten ferocious beasts in the chaos were forces to be reckoned with.</p>

  <p>In fact, their strength was comparable to that of an Eternal Warrior.</p>

  <p>However, a force as formidable as the Thunder Dimorphodon was still killed by Fuxi! Indeed, Fuxi was quite terrifying.</p>

  <p>"The Thunder Dimorphodon has taken away twelve Descending Rings, and six of them have fallen into your hands. Give them back to me," Fuxi said impatiently.</p>

  <p>Divine Farmer and Yellow Thearch had offered the Thunder Dimorphodon a handsome price to help them.</p>

  <p>However, the Thunder Dimorphodon hadn't expected that, after being rewarded, he'd be chased by Fuxi until the end.</p>

  <p>The first few times, it had managed to escape. Ultimately, however, Fuxi captured it. Before the Thunder Dimorphodon died, it had disclosed to Fuxi the whereabouts of the twelve Descending Rings: six went to the Divine Farmer, while the other six had been forcibly taken from it by this Black Ship.</p>

  <p>After thinking for a while, Fuxi had decided it would be better to go after the Black Ship.</p>

  <p>After a moment of silence, the captain said slowly, "Human Sovereign, do you really think I can be trapped by just an Eight Diagrams Rope?"</p>

  <p>His Black Ship had crisscrossed the chaos and the Source World. Even though he had pissed off many super forces, he managed to get away each time. That was all because he had a terrifying ability to escape.</p>

  <p>"What if I told you I have a Ring of Prediction?" Fuxi asked coldly.</p>

  <p>Standing on the deck, the captain in the hooded cloak seemed to be lost in thought once more. After a long time, he sighed quietly. As he stretched out a hand, three Descending Rings appeared. "I can return three Descending Rings to you, but on one condition. If you agree, I will tell you some more valuable information."</p>

  <p>When Fuxi saw the three Descending Rings, he felt a little surprised.</p>

  <p>He had thought that he would have a fierce battle with the Black Ship. He hadn't expected the captain would give up half of the Descending Rings so easily.</p>

  <p>"What condition?" asked Fuxi, eyebrow raised curiously.</p>

  <p>"I want those golden red Chaotic Source Spirits in exchange," said the captain bluntly.</p>

  <p>"Golden red Chaotic Source Spirits?"</p>

  <p>Fuxi was dazed for a few seconds. Then, it hit him.</p>

  <p>After the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits was killed, Zheng had dug out some special Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>At the time, Yan had gifted one of them to Fuxi, so he could study it. Even though Fuxi had pondered over it for a long time, he still hadn't found a way to refine it.</p>
