  <p>
</p>

  <p>Ahern snorted coldly as soon as Zheng finished speaking. "Cleon and Rocco aren't powerful. How can those two good-for-nothings compare to Libby?"</p>

  <p>His words weren't lost on Rocco and Cleon who were standing within earshot.</p>

  <p>Both men's faces paled when they heard Ahern's words.</p>

  <p>The two of them were famous in the Land of Sword Grief but here was Ahern, who readily sneered at them and easily branded them as 'good-for-nothings'.</p>

  <p>Cleon had an extraordinary background but it was nothing compared to Ahern who was a disciple on the third floor and was set to be a Oneness Governor in the future, hence why the latter did not take him seriously.</p>

  <p>Zheng's confidence also surprised Goran.</p>

  <p>Did his cultivation increase in such a short period of time?</p>

  <p>Goran fixed his eyes on Zheng and Libby. "I'm also looking forward to this challenge but I don't think today is the right time, as I have something important to announce."</p>

  <p>Around ninety percent of the Land of Sword Grief's disciples were gathered in front of Goran.</p>

  <p>What he was about to tell them was definitely no small matter since he gathered almost all of them here.</p>

  <p>Once the chattering quieted down, everyone waited to hear what Goran had to say.</p>

  <p>"The Mountain Viewing Province has been attacked and conquered," he announced.</p>

  <p>This sudden news threw everyone in an uproar.</p>

  <p>"Has the Grand River Fortress been captured?!"</p>

  <p>"Impossible!"</p>

  <p>"If the Mountain Viewing Province has been conquered, then does that mean..."</p>

  <p>Multiple passes surrounded the province and though it wasn't as important on its own, it definitely provided the gateway to conquering other, bigger provinces. The Sun Crow race must know this when they chose to lay siege on the Mountain Viewing Province.</p>

  <p>The shock was evident on Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>He had gone to the Mountain Viewing Province not long after entering the Dragon City. The Lofty Swords in the Grand River Fortress left a deep impression on him. He didn't think it was going to be conquered so easily.</p>

  <p>"After the Sun Crow race took control of the Mountain Viewing Province, they quickly mobilized and conquered several nearby provinces. Right now, it seems they've arrived at the North Unicorn Province," Goran continued, further adding to everyone's distress.</p>

  <p>"What?!"</p>

  <p>"That fast?!"</p>

  <p>"Oh my God!"</p>

  <p>All disciples, from the first to the third floor, could only stand there in shock.</p>

  <p>The North Unicorn Province was located right next to the Bloom Divine Province, which meant that the Oneness Sky Palace was next! None of them ever expected the Sun Crow race to move this fast.</p>

  <p>Goran looked at all of them with a serious expression. "You are the members of the Land of Sword Grief and the Oneness Sky Palace. Now that things have come to this, I hope you can all rise up and protect the Oneness Sky Palace and the Bloom Divine Province!"</p>

  <p>There were many provinces under the Oneness Sky Palace's jurisdiction but ninety percent of its power and resources were concentrated in the Bloom Divine Province.</p>

  <p>If the Sun Crow race truly went and invaded the Bloom Divine Province, then that would mean inconceivable consequences for all of them.</p>

  <p>The Dragon City and the sword sects in the seven mountains were already beginning to mobilize their forces. The Land of Sword Grief would also follow suit.</p>

  <p>The disciples present knew what a war among the super races meant. Chaos would fall upon the entire land and even powerful Chaotic Source Realm warriors could perish in the battlefield.</p>

  <p>All the disciples kept their mouths shut in a tight line and the atmosphere was incredibly heavy. In the silence, Gabriel spoke, "Master Goran, we were able to become outstanding and powerful warriors because of the Oneness Sky Palace. It is only natural for us to lay down our lives on the line to defend it from its enemies!"</p>

  <p>"Gabriel is right! I'll kill all those damn birds when they come!" More and more disciples echoed Gabriel's sentiments and the previous icy mood began to heat up with conviction.</p>

  <p>"How dare the Sun Crow race..."</p>

  <p>If it was a battle they wanted, then so shall it be delivered.</p>

  <p>They were all human beings and their foundations were built upon the Bloom Divine Province. If the Oneness Sky Palace was destroyed, then all of the disciples' foundations would also crumble. The only way to go about this situation was to willingly lay down their lives and fight to the death.</p>

  <p>Goran couldn't help the burst of pride that swelled in his chest, but he was still in a bad mood.</p>

  <p>The crisis in the North Unicorn Province was tricky, but that was no longer the Oneness Sky Palace's biggest concern...</p>

  <p>"War is imminent! Everyone, ready yourselves and gather in the Dragon City. Your tasks shall be assigned to you there!" Goran announced. After he finished speaking, he began to distribute golden swords to the disciples one by one.</p>

  <p>These golden swords were tokens of the Oneness Sky Palace, held by the five-star Oneness Guards.</p>

  <p>Zheng received two, since he would need to give the other one to the Evil God.</p>

  <p>The warriors who cultivated in seclusion were also called out and Zheng expected the Evil God to come out with them.</p>

  <p>To his surprise, the Evil God was nowhere to be seen. 'Is he trapped inside a temple?' Zheng thought to himself.</p>

  <p>After Goran left, Zheng made his way back to the bronze building with the others.</p>

  <p>Inside, he found the Evil God looking a bit red and flustered. Zheng waited as the Evil God rushed over towards him and gave a respectful bow. He returned the Evil God's bow with a nod. "Have you arrived at the Myriad Spirits City during this secluded cultivation?"</p>

  <p>The Evil God nodded. "I have but I accidentally explored a temple outside the city and obtained something, so I was late."</p>

  <p>Zheng couldn't control what the Evil God did on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>The Evil God looked composed enough but Zheng remained doubtful.</p>

  <p>It wasn't an easy feat to leave a temple at will and Zheng wouldn't doubt it if the Evil God came out after a few days, but he came out after just a short period of time.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes flashed and all the memories the Evil God had on the Other Shore started to flood his consciousness.</p>

  <p>He saw the Evil God explore Stage Thirteen of the Other Shore... cross the energy vortex...</p>

  <p id="top_17">receive the soul crystal in the Myriad Spirits City... come upon an Other Shore Key and explore the temple...</p>

  <p>The Evil God had built a completely nonexistent world within the Kaleidoscopic Golden Dipper.</p>

  <p>These memories were all the things the Evil God had imagined.</p>

  <p>However, the Evil God himself was convinced that these were real since his true memories had been taken away.</p>

  <p>This was how the Inner-world Generating Avatars worked. If they wanted to deceive their masters, then they had to deceive themselves first.</p>

  <p>However, the Evil God felt strange, since training obediently on the Other Shore wasn't his thing.</p>

  <p>Zheng felt this strangeness but couldn't figure out just what was wrong.</p>

  <p>He then chose to hand over the golden sword to the Evil God, instructing him to prepare before leaving.</p>

  <p>After he returned to his training room, Zheng took out a piece of paper and unfolded it before him. There was a moment of hesitation, but he began to write something down: the Truth Enlightenment.</p>

  <p>He had previously hoped that the Oneness Sky Palace could help him revive his race in exchange for the Truth Enlightenment.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng now understood that the human race existed as a whole and could no longer hide the Truth Enlightenment from them anymore. He planned to take this piece of paper and hand it over to Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>
