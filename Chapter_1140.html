<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was holding a pickax. It was a low-grade sacred weapon so it wasn't difficult for him to cut open the leaf. As he continuously swung the pickax, the crack on the leaf became bigger until it burst open and a few ores of different sizes fell into his hand.</p>

  <p>These ores weren't considered valuable. Even in the Central Region they could be considered rare ores, but they weren't top-grade ores. The warriors of Randy's level in the four divine kingdoms would casually discard these ores.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't think like they did. He gathered the ores and saved them in his space ring. He felt hesitant for a while without knowing what to do.</p>

  <p>Since he had dug up the ores in this leaf, he should be able to choose to leave this place, but he didn't know how.</p>

  <p>There was neither visible sky nor ground.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked up and saw a warrior four to five layers higher than him. He was rapidly digging out ores from a leaf. After he finished, he leaped and fell down into the void below.</p>

  <p>Soon after, a ring appeared out of nowhere, spreading out like a ripple, and the warrior also disappeared within it.</p>

  <p>That was how he could get out. There was probably a transmission array beneath this tree that would allow a warrior to go out.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was prepared to follow suit and jump up, but in that instance he saw that within the scattered roots of the tree there were also some strange-looking ores.</p>

  <p>This large tree used its main stem to absorb many ores and drive them into its countless branches, and finally the leaves.</p>

  <p>"What will happen if I cut this branch off?" Luo Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>He immediately leaped towards a branch. Just as he was about to pull out his long sword, which was a top-grade sacred weapon, a strange force pulled him downwards.</p>

  <p>It happened so fast that Luo Zheng didn't have much time to react. When he came back to his senses, he was already standing outside of the pyramid with his sword and pickax in his hands. Randy, on the other hand, stood before him with a smile.</p>

  <p>He looked at Zheng's long sword and chuckled. "It seems like you intended to cut off a branch of the tree. Countless people have already tried it before, but no one can do it!"</p>

  <p>Of course, the warriors of the four divine kingdoms had been exploring the Feather Holy Sea for so many years that they probably had tried everything Luo Zheng could think of.</p>

  <p>Cutting off a branch was definitely much more efficient than digging through a leaf. But it didn't matter if it was a warrior at the Virtual Tribulation Realm, or a Life and Death Realm warrior, or even a mighty warrior at the Soul Sea Realm, no one could break its branches.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled feeling embarrassed. Naturally, he would only learn if he tried on his own. He put his long sword back into his space ring. This time he decided to explore this pyramid more carefully.</p>

  <p>"If my guess is right, when I enter the doors in the bottom layers of this pyramid and excavate the leaves, all the ores I find will be of poor quality. The higher up, the better ores I'll find, right?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Randy smiled and nodded, "That's right. This pyramid has a total of forty-seven layers, corresponding to the tree's forty-seven layers of leaves. Every time you enter through a door, you will fall onto a leaf and you will be able to dig the ores within. The higher the door is, the better the ores are. Of course, the difficulty for us to dig the ores will also be higher."</p>

  <p>"Which layer will the life stones be at?" Luo Zheng suddenly asked.</p>

  <p>He had come all the way to this continent to find the life stones. He wasn't too interested in the ores but he still kept some.</p>

  <p>Randy pointed at the pyramid and said, "The distribution of these mineral resources is just a rough estimate. There is no way for us to be precise, but according to our experience, the life stones should be in the 25th layer or above. The higher the layer, the better the ores. We also need better pickaxes to dig the ores in the higher layers. Besides, we may be in danger on some leaves."</p>

  <p>A light flashed through Zheng's eyes as he listened to Randy's words.</p>

  <p>"Since that's the case, I'll go up too!"</p>

  <p>At this time, a group of warriors swarmed over. The one leading them was Fredric, the crown prince of the York Divine Kingdom.</p>

  <p>A while ago, Fredric confronted the Ghost Beasts and to do that he used the powerful Heavenly Thunder Halberd. The combined attack of so many beasts had left him in a sorry state.</p>

  <p>While the warriors were clamoring, they started to climb the pyramid.</p>

  <p>They pulled out their pickaxes and entered through the doors of the 20th layer or higher.</p>

  <p>After they entered, Luo Zheng continued to jump on the pyramid, silently counting the number of layers he had climbed. He followed Randy's advice and chose the 25th layer.</p>

  <p>The higher the layer, the less the doors. There were thousands of doors in the first layer. After reaching the 25th layer, there were less than a hundred doors.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng randomly picked a door and entered. The moment he stepped through the door, he rapidly descended. Soon after, a light flashed before his eyes and he fell onto a leaf.</p>

  <p>He was standing in the middle section of the tree. Standing here, he could look down and see the leaves on the tree below him.</p>

  <p>He scanned the area and turned to look at the leaf below his feet. He was looking for life stones, the kind of ancient jade that looked like an egg.</p>

  <p>He could see that this leaf contained a lot of ores. Each of the ores seemed to contain a strange power. Some of them even had a kind of Law Power within. Obviously, these ores were much better than those he had obtained before, but all he wanted was to find life stones.</p>

  <p>Disappointment was written all over Zheng's face. "There are no life stones in this leaf," he murmured. He was not in the mood to dig for ores, so he decided to leave.</p>

  <p>He swiftly leaped forward and began to descend rapidly. Not long later he appeared outside of the pyramid again.</p>

  <p>More and more warriors gathered at the bottom of the pyramid. Randy had probably started excavating for ores as well. This time, Luo Zheng couldn't see him.</p>

  <p>Since he couldn't find life stones in the 25th layer, Luo Zheng decided to climb three layers higher and went straight to the 28th layer of the pyramid.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng reached the 28th layer, the warriors gathered below the pyramid started whispering among themselves while staring at him.</p>

  <p>"This is Tianxing Luo's first time in this secret land, yet he actually chooses to climb to the 28th layer of the pyramid."</p>

  <p>"That is not strange. He's a powerful warrior. With the strength that he displayed so far, he might be able to contend against some of the Life and Death Realm warriors. So what if he chooses the 28th layer? It is not a big deal for him."</p>

  <p>"I agree with you. It's not dangerous for him at all if he enters the layers below the 30th layer. However, the layers above that are completely different."</p>

  <p>Amidst the crowd's discussion, Luo Zheng walked through a door in the 28th layer. A couple of seconds later, he fell down from the ring of light outside of the pyramid. He felt desperate.</p>

  <p>Once again he failed to find life stones that he needed in the 28th layer.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was feeling rather frustrated by now. He needed a great number of life stones, not just one or two. He estimated that in order to fully replenish Yudie's life energy, he would need at least a thousand life stones. If he kept going like this, he would be lucky if he could obtain one or two hundred life stones.</p>

  <p>After falling from the ring of light, Luo Zheng picked himself up, grabbed his pickax and climbed up to the 29th layer.</p>

  <p>"What is he trying to do?"</p>

  <p>"Probably searching for some sort of ore."</p>

  <p>This time, Luo Zheng landed on one of the leaves in the 29th layer. The moment his feet landed on it, a glint flashed across his eyes and a faint smile appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>He finally found life stones!</p>

  <p>This light blue leaf was about ten feet wide and five feet thick. It looked like a huge blue crystal. Sealed within the leaf there were several pieces of egg-like ancient jade. These were the life stones he had been looking for.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng counted sixteen life stones wrapped within this leaf. Although it was far from what he needed, it was still not a small amount. He would gather as many as he could and keep looking through other leaves.</p>

  <p>"What is this?" he murmured. In the middle of the life stones there was a shiny object that Luo Zheng couldn't identify. He stared at it, puzzled.</p>
