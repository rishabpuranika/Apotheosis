<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Evil God emerged from the passageway, greeting Zheng with a smug smile.</p>

  <p>Zheng faced this creation of his with a look of indifference.</p>

  <p>The Evil God was a creature born from his inner world so it was only a given that Zheng knew everything about him.</p>

  <p>From his birth to his growth, Zheng knew every single detail.</p>

  <p>All the information would gather together in his mind with only a single thought.</p>

  <p>"You've made a big mistake," Zheng hissed.</p>

  <p>His creation merely continued smiling at him. "What is it?"</p>

  <p>"You should've never used Dorothy to provoke me!" Zheng snarled with white-hot rage.</p>

  <p>Dorothy couldn't help but purse her lips.</p>

  <p>She had fought with this creation of Zheng's before and knew very well how terrifying he was.</p>

  <p>The Evil God had chosen to spare her life at the last moment and Dorothy caught on pretty quickly as to why: he wanted to use her to provoke Zheng.</p>

  <p>She trusted Zheng's strength wholeheartedly, but she didn't want him to get into this potentially dangerous fight just because of her. Moreover, the current situation was skewed to the Evil God's favor.</p>

  <p>If Zheng was defeated by the Evil God, he would only end in death.</p>

  <p>It was nice to be saved by Zheng but she wasn't as relieved as she should be.</p>

  <p>In fact, she was very worried.</p>

  <p>Zheng was wholly determined to fight for her and would not back down from this fight with the Evil God.</p>

  <p>It warmed her heart but it was quickly overtaken with worry for Zheng's life.</p>

  <p>"Tsk, tsk, tsk..." The Evil God shook his head with a smile. "You seem really eager to destroy me."</p>

  <p>"You never should've existed in the first place," Zheng countered.</p>

  <p>This creation of his was a freak and Zheng was still at a loss as to how such a vile creature appeared in his inner world. Other people didn't seem to have this problem. Why him?</p>

  <p>Did it have anything to do with the primitive land?</p>

  <p>The Evil God let out a maniacal laugh. "My existence wasn't decided by you. Not even this round of chaos can decide my birth. I am destined to transcend everything while you..."</p>

  <p>He paused to glare at Zheng with his two evil eyes. "You are merely destined to be my stepping stone."</p>

  <p>His daring insults caused the various races to frown.</p>

  <p>There was truly no limit to the Evil God's arrogance.</p>

  <p>Destined to transcend everything? Even if he came from the Black Ship, he was not qualified to say something like that.</p>

  <p>What in the world made him so confident to say those words?</p>

  <p>"Shut up!"</p>

  <p>Yan shouted in frustration.</p>

  <p>Her yell seemed to hold some power as light suddenly shot out from her and towards the Evil God at shockingly fast speed.</p>

  <p id="top_4">It was the Words Spirit nurtured by Yan!</p>

  <p>The Truth of Holy Words was a very special type of Truth of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>Only a few people were suited to cultivating it, even in the Source World.</p>

  <p>Yan was one of these few people and was even regarded as one of the best in cultivating the Truth of Holy Words.</p>

  <p>Upon reaching the consummate level of the Truth of Holy Words, a warrior would then gain the ability to form their own Words Spirits.</p>

  <p>These Words Spirits were then nurtured, cared for so that they grew strong.</p>

  <p>Yan had been greatly favored by the Snake Goddess on Pear Hill. When Fuxi arrived, she managed to gain the guidance of two able masters and strengthened her Words Spirit to an unimaginable level.</p>

  <p>Despite this, however, Yan did not use it that often.</p>

  <p>Powerful Words Spirits could kill people with a single word from their masters.</p>

  <p>The more powerful ones were even said to make words come true, words that had the ability to change the course of destiny.</p>

  <p>This sudden move from Yan caught the Evil God by surprise. As soon as she said "shut up," the Words Spirit came at him and sewed his lips shut.</p>

  <p>"You are a mere secondary creature from my brother's inner world and that's all you will ever be. Do you really think those people from the Black Ship can make you invincible? The world isn't anything that a secondary creature like you could ever imagine..."</p>

  <p>Yan lashed out this bitter, cruel truth in the Evil God's silence.</p>

  <p>She could see him thrash, trying to refute all that she said, but he couldn't, not when her Words Spirit attacked him like that.</p>

  <p>He was too proud, too arrogant, and not just to his enemies. He treated even those from the Black Ship like Shera as nothing more than dirt underneath his shoe.</p>

  <p>Anyone who dared speak against him was dealt with ruthlessly.</p>

  <p>Yan, however, could care less. She mocked him nonstop and the Evil God's face progressively got redder in rage. A killing intent surged from his body as he poised himself for an attack.</p>

  <p>However, as soon as the killing intent burst out of him, a demon red light flashed above his head.</p>

  <p>There was no way he would be allowed to kill in here. Yan was the chosen one by the giant eye. It measured the Evil God's strength and prevented him from attacking her.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the Evil God's body was engulfed with ice-cold fear.</p>

  <p>Despite feigning invincibility, the Evil God had weaknesses in his soul, much like everyone else.</p>

  <p>As this overwhelming power of fear escalated, his body began to weigh him down and his face contorted in pain.</p>

  <p>That said though, he still had a far stronger pain threshold than any normal warrior. Despite being in great pain, he continued to resist this power that had taken over him.</p>

  <p>"Step back, Yan," Zheng warned, standing in front of his sister protectively.</p>

  <p>"I'm not afraid of him," she protested.</p>

  <p>Yan wanted to prove to him that she was strong enough to take care of herself.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Evil God continued to fight off the power of fear, his face muscles twitching as he did so.</p>

  <p>He looked ferociously grotesque as he used the soul force to resist.</p>

  <p>This horrifying scene shocked the members of the Separate Abyss race, the Bearing race, and the Divine Farmer race.</p>

  <p>They too had suffered a lot after encountering the power of fear released by the Dreaded Eye Demon and knew just how horrible it was.</p>

  <p>It didn't physically hurt but the pressure on one's mind was overwhelming.</p>

  <p>Even Zheng was surprised at how hard the Evil God resisted.</p>

  <p>Back when Zheng was engulfed with the maximum power of fear emanating from a hundred or so sculptures, he shared the overwhelming pressure with the Bearing race, the Divine Farmer race, the Pear Hill, and others. Even so, it proved to be extremely difficult even with the use of the Flow Swordsmanship.</p>

  <p>Only a dozen sculptures were activated this time but it should be noted that the Evil God was taking it all by himself. This proved the incredible strength of his soul force.</p>

  <p>Zheng was definitely not going to let him do whatever he wanted outside the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>In fact, he was even more determined to put him right back into his inner world where he belonged.</p>

  <p>They weren't the only ones astonished by this display of resilience. Even the giant eye on top of the cave was shocked. "Interesting! Interesting... Here comes another incredible talent, someone who can resist my power of fear!"</p>

  <p>"Resist your power of fear?" the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits asked. "If you can't subdue him then wouldn't that mean trouble for us?"</p>

  <p>For the past ten years, the Chaotic Source Spirits had been growing in power by devouring each other, as intended by the mother.</p>

  <p>However, they all relied on the giant eye.</p>

  <p>If it turned out that not even the giant eye could suppress the Evil God, then that was definitely going to be bad for them, which made the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits quite concerned.</p>

  <p>"Humph!" the giant eye snorted in disdain through consciousness as the red light shone brighter.</p>

  <p>More and more sculptures were activated, releasing waves upon waves of power of fear. All of it was directed at the Evil God, and even the people who were very close to the Evil God were not affected at all.</p>
