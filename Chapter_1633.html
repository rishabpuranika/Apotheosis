<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng's full strength erupted right now, he could forcefully and violently take Malachi down.</p>

  <p>The Saint Killing Spear was truly formidable.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, if Luo Luo Zheng kept dodging the sharp tips of the spear while using the explosive power of the Gods-intimidating Strike along with the immense supply of chaotic energy, Luo Luo Zheng could exhaust Malachi and kill him.</p>

  <p>Besides, Luo Luo Zheng had gained a lot after battling Sword Chen.</p>

  <p>And Malachi was a perfect warrior for Luo Luo Zheng to practice the sword on.</p>

  <p>As they drew closer to each other, the two began to engage in close combat.</p>

  <p>Malachi retreated quickly in an attempt to get rid of Luo Luo Zheng, but Luo Luo Zheng would never give him the chance to shake him off.</p>

  <p>He managed to stay at a distance of three feet from him at all times.</p>

  <p>Malachi struck and stabbed, swinging the Saint Killing Spear around.</p>

  <p>But no matter which move he used, Luo Luo Zheng anticipated the movement of the Saint Killing Spear each time it reached about halfway to him and used the Thunder Wind Divine Sword to block the spearhead from harming him. This way, he was able to break Malachi's moves.</p>

  <p>Malachi felt like he was being shackled by an invisible chain.</p>

  <p>And here he had been confident because he was an ace talent who had the Saint Killing Spear!</p>

  <p>Even Godly Geniuses would find it difficult to defend themselves against the spear when it struck out. The ace talents were way below them!</p>

  <p>But the problem now was that he couldn't thrust out the spear and reach his opponent!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stood there, expressionless as a zombie. But it was humiliating to Malachi, because it felt like Luo Luo Zheng was mocking him.</p>

  <p>The warriors on the city wall were surprised as they saw them fighting.</p>

  <p>It didn't look like a fight between two powerful warriors of the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng is really strong! He didn't even use any martial skill and sealed all of Malachi's moves with just a long sword!"</p>

  <p>"Malachi is stupid. It's such a waste for him to have the Saint Killing Spear. He has almost no chance of fighting back! If I were him, I would definitely burn my bridges and give Luo Luo Zheng a fatal counterattack!"</p>

  <p>"I think it's you who are stupid. In this kind of situation, Malachi won't stand a chance even if he wants to go all out because Luo Luo Zheng would have killed him long before that!"</p>

  <p>Janet held the flame kitten in her arms and stared at Luo Zheng's moves, her eyes flashing. "This guy seems to be practicing the sword!"</p>

  <p>"I've underestimated Luo Zheng's strength and courage if he is using an ace talent to practice the sword," Jeffrey said with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng's previous performance had been stunning, everyone had only regarded him as someone who could be compared to an ace talent.</p>

  <p>The strength of ace talents differed greatly.</p>

  <p>For example, Lucille was the strongest among the ace talents, and her power was already close to that of a Godly Genius. As long as she gained some insights of the Divine Dao and became a Godly Genius, she would be able to become a candidate for a True God.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, there was still quite some way to go for ordinary ace talents before they could become Godly Geniuses.</p>

  <p>But now, Janet altered her judgment. 'He's on par with Lucille at her peak condition!' she thought, impressed.</p>

  <p>"Get out of my way!"</p>

  <p>Malachi could feel his heart fill with resentment.</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng really had unparalleled strength, it would be okay even if Luo Luo Zheng killed him.</p>

  <p>But this fellow was slippery. He was only extremely cautious and agile and was able to block his every move. So even though Malachi had the strength, he was unable to bring it into play.</p>

  <p>If they had fought face-to-face, Malachi would have long since pierced countless holes through Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The resentment grew like wild grass in Malachi's heart.</p>

  <p>The Saint Killing Spear in his hand danced wildly like a spinning wheel as he tried to force Luo Luo Zheng away.</p>

  <p>However, it seemed as if Luo Luo Zheng and the spear were inseparable.</p>

  <p>No matter how fast the spear spun, Luo Zheng's body would spin just as fast.</p>

  <p>What kind of a freaky bodily movement skill was this!</p>

  <p>Malachi cursed internally.</p>

  <p>This guy was a ghost that could not be shaken off. .</p>

  <p>When Malachi's Saint Killing Spear stopped, Luo Luo Zheng was still holding his sword, standing close to him and staring at him expressionlessly.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>The Saint Killing Spear suddenly bounced back, thrusting towards Luo Luo Zheng like a wild dragon probing the sea. His movement was fast and fierce, and together with the formidable Saint Killing Spear, no one could defend against it. He was confident as he brought the Saint Killing Spear into the Illusion Battlefield to fulfill his goal of entering the top ten of the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>But no matter how fierce his movement was or how powerful his weapon, if they couldn't unleash their power, they would be useless.</p>

  <p>The spear was only able to reach halfway to Luo Luo Zheng before the Thunder Wind Divine Sword met the spear shaft.</p>

  <p>The spear swung away, dinging faintly.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was like a patient chess player, skillfully displaying his skills and controlling the whole situation, neither taking a step forward, nor a step back.</p>

  <p>He was full out testing his insights into the swordsmanship.</p>

  <p>But Malachi was becoming more and more irritable by the minute. He was about to lose his mind from this feeling of helplessness, just as a wave of anger began to gather in his chest. The anger was stuck there.</p>

  <p>He could neither swallow it nor spit it out.</p>

  <p>The gap between Malachi and Luo Luo Zheng hadn't been huge at first.</p>

  <p>But to the crowd, the fight between Malachi and Luo Luo Zheng was like an adult teaching a child a lesson, with the latter having almost no way to fight back.</p>

  <p>Hailey, who had been watching the fight this entire time, was now very excited, her face full of astonishment and happiness.</p>

  <p>Before the battle had started, she had thought that Luo Luo Zheng might have a chance to win.</p>

  <p>But she had never expected such an outcome.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had easily wrapped the arrogant Malachi around his little finger. Just like that!</p>

  <p>As the two of them fought, they gradually moved closer to the city wall.</p>

  <p>A few warriors sat on top of the city wall, watching this scene gloomily.</p>

  <p>"Malachi seems to be unable to defeat Luo Luo Zheng."</p>

  <p>"It's not that he can't defeat him. If the full strength of the Saint Killing Spear is fully unleashed, Luo Luo Zheng won't be a match for Malachi. It's just that this fellow's swordsmanship is strange, and he's controlling the situation to prevent Malachi from bringing out his full strength."</p>

  <p>"We should go help!"</p>

  <p>The rule of the Illusion Battlefield at the current stage was that there were no rules.</p>

  <p>It was a fight between Luo Luo Zheng and Malachi but there was no rule forbidding anyone to lend a helping hand.</p>

  <p>The martial artists that followed Malachi also understood that they only needed to help Malachi to find a chance to unleash his power, so that he could rely on the Saint Killing Spear to kill Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>So the eight warriors leapt up at the same time and left the city wall.</p>

  <p>"Damn! Those guys want to get involved in the battle!" Janet's bright eyes flashed, her expression hardening.</p>

  <p>"Let's go to help too!" Jeffrey said suddenly.</p>

  <p>Hailey also jumped off the city wall at the same time. Luo Luo Zheng was standing up for her after all.</p>

  <p>Seeing the warriors of the two groups getting ready to join the battle, the other warriors who were watching the fight suddenly became excited.</p>

  <p>"More people are getting involved! Ha-ha! The fight is going to be even more interesting this time!"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid the warriors from Luo Zheng's side will be at a disadvantage. After all, Malachi has more people."</p>

  <p>The martial artists that followed Malachi were all friends he had made in the Hall of Causality, and they also had great strength.</p>

  <p>Right after they left the city wall, the eight warriors clearly divided their duties: two of them went to help defend Malachi against Luo Luo Zheng, three of them directly attacked Luo Luo Zheng, and the rest went to intercept the warriors who were coming to help Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>There seemed to be nothing wrong with this kind of division of labor.</p>

  <p>But they had missed something. They had miscalculated Luo Zheng's strength.</p>

  <p>They thought that Luo Luo Zheng couldn't get distracted as he had to be fully focused on blocking Malachi's moves.</p>

  <p>However, the moment they left the city wall, a sword intent that was rapidly shrinking began to form on Luo Zheng's sword. He brandished his sword and thrust it at them.</p>

  <p>"Gods-intimidating Strike!"</p>

  <p>The rapidly shrinking sword intent drew an arc in the air.</p>

  <p>The sword intent went along the city wall, and headed towards the warriors that were coming to attack him.</p>

  <p>The strong sword intent swept over the top of the city wall.</p>

  <p>The two martial artists who had just leapt off the city wall were taken by surprise.</p>

  <p>They didn't even have the time to react before Luo Zheng's sword intent struck them down. A trail of blood erupted from their bodies and they fell off the wall.</p>

  <p>This shocked every martial artist present there. Even Malachi, who had been tortured by Luo Zheng's relentless blocking, looked stunned. Was this the true strength of this fellow?</p>

  <p>Silence reigned both inside and outside of the main city.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng didn't stop there. His first strike had killed two warriors and he didn't hesitate as he thrust out the second strike.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's actions seemed to fall into a certain pattern once he had completely entered the state of Emotion Closing. He began to mercilessly attack his opponents.</p>

  <p>"Gods-intimidating Strike!"</p>

  <p>The long sword slashed out.</p>

  <p>Another sword intent struck through the air, and the second strike killed three more warriors.</p>

  <p>In the span of a few seconds, Luo Luo Zheng had killed five warriors with his Gods-intimidating Strike. All these five warriors were Malachi's followers.</p>

  <p>When the remaining martial artists on Malachi's side saw this, they didn't hesitate before turning around and fleeing back to the main city. They were now depressed. Just where had this fellow learned this sword strike from? It was simply too powerful!</p>
