<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As soon as the group led by Kenelm set foot on the flying ship, excitement overwhelmed each of them.</p>

  <p>A brand new life was promised for them at the end of the trip.</p>

  <p>The Sword Light Palace did not give them much time to prepare. They were instructed to travel as soon as possible. After they got the news to set off, they all hurriedly bid goodbye to their families.</p>

  <p>The cyan flying ship of the Sword Light Palace was majestically decorated.</p>

  <p>The wood that made the railings of the ship revealed natural patterns. Such a rare wood naturally highlighted the outlines of the ship. The natural patterns were said to calm people's minds. After the group stepped on the ship, they found that everything on the flying ship seemed to be exquisite.</p>

  <p>The ship was designed to be comfortable for most people.</p>

  <p>However, most of the eleven consummate True Gods who got the licenses to enter the Sword Light Palace looked restrained after they got on the ship.</p>

  <p>Kenelm and his friends even walked on tiptoes. It seemed like such a luxurious place made them uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>Only Zheng was able to maintain his calm as he gave no interest in the facilities.</p>

  <p>After all, the divine land itself was a flying ship. With such a long experience in that place, he grew accustomed to its features. Additionally, he had personally controlled such a huge flying ship. As such, when he saw the other flying ships, they were rather insignificant in his eyes. Moreover, the flying ship of Sword Light Palace could not compare to the Trumpet Flying Ship.</p>

  <p>Everyone boarded the cyan flying ship safely. Afterward, one of the men in cyan shouted with an official tone, "Set off!"</p>

  <p>A slight shake signaled the take-off of the flying ship. The majestic cyan flying ship left the East Port silently.</p>

  <p>The flight started with fair weather. The huge Excellence City quickly grew smaller in the distance. Soon, the flying ship carried everyone into the sky and flew forward at high speed.</p>

  <p>Zheng stood on the side of the ship with a callous expression. Because of the clear skies, he was able to look down at the scene below. Even though he was in the air and was over a hundred thousand feet high, everything around that he saw was still yellow and hazy.</p>

  <p>"It's still the desert outside the Excellence City?" Zheng's eyes narrowed as he examined the area below. Suddenly, some dust blocked his vision.</p>

  <p>Above the desert floated a mass of sand storm. With his experience, Zheng immediately realized that the sand storm was caused by a Man-eating Demon Flower.</p>

  <p>If there was still the vast desert around Excellence City, then the circumstances would be unfavorable to the Evil God.</p>

  <p>A few days ago, he let go of the Evil God. However, the Evil God did not choose to enter Excellence City but left along the big river instead. At that moment, as he looked down from the sky, he saw that the river stretched for hundreds of miles before it finally disappeared into the desert.</p>

  <p>However, as he looked at the river, he concluded that the Evil God hadn't encountered any danger. After all, if the Evil God died, he would be reborn in the "Rebirth Land" inside Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>"You… seem to... be very interested in the Gracious Province?" a weak voice behind Zheng said softly.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the pale-faced woman slowly approached him from his side.</p>

  <p>With her thin arms, she leaned on the rail as if she had no strength. A nostalgic pair of eyes decorated her face and she also looked down at the scenery below.</p>

  <p>"That desert looks so vast. Where will it end?" asked Zheng as he stared far into the distance.</p>

  <p>The pale-faced woman blinked her eyes at Zheng's query. With a gentle wave of her hand, she pointed out to the air and said, "The entire Gracious Province... is mostly desert. Here is the Eremopoa Desert. That right there is the Sunset Desert. Over there..."</p>

  <p>"The Gracious Province has such a tough environment? That's pretty harsh!" Zheng was slightly stunned as he processed some new information.</p>

  <p>A faint smile appeared on the face of the woman. With a suggestive tone, she answered, "What else do you think… Otherwise, no one would be willing to give up this province. This desert is a harsh place. There is only sand and nothing more…"</p>

  <p>Zheng simmered in deep thought as he heard such a miserable statement.</p>

  <p>A recent memory came to Zheng's mind. It was when Kenelm told him the reason why no big force controlled the Gracious Province. He said because of the Wild Goose Pass, no big sect was allowed to occupy this province.</p>

  <p>Zheng had once doubted the words. When he heard the explanation of the woman, he concluded that it was much closer to the true reason.</p>

  <p>It turned out that the Gracious Province was too barren. Therefore, the great powers were simply uninterested in the place.</p>

  <p>"Uhmmm… You are not a local in the Gracious Province, right?" continued the pale-faced woman with a curious expression.</p>

  <p>The question that Zheng had always tried to avoid finally came.</p>

  <p>As he tried to hide his worry, his eyes flickered. Of course, he had predicted that the Sword Light Palace would question him about his identity. As such, he had already prepared a set of excuses.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am indeed not," said Zheng confidently as he nodded.</p>

  <p>He waited for the woman to continue her questions. However, he didn't expect that the conversation would suddenly stop there. Zheng's set of excuses didn't even come into use.</p>

  <p>On the flying ship, Kenelm and the others of the group sat on one side, and the three men in cyan stood at the bow to control the ship. Apart from the sound of wind caused when the ship flew at a high speed, it was very quiet on the ship.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Zheng's eyes flashed as he looked curiously down below.</p>

  <p>"That's..."</p>

  <p>The sand below suddenly blew violently upward. There was an unprecedented storm in the desert.</p>

  <p>The area the huge sand storm covered was vastly beyond Zheng's imagination.</p>

  <p>In the center of the sand storm, there seemed to be a large city.</p>

  <p>"The city of the people living in the sand," the woman said indifferently as she looked down.</p>

  <p>With a grim look, Zheng thought of the people in the Sweltering Desert and asked, "Do these people really have their own country?"</p>

  <p>"Country?" The woman shook her head slightly as her face revealed some pity. "That is not the country of those people living in the sand...</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, something else rules the place... That's the country of Man-eating Demon Flowers. Look!"</p>

  <p>Zheng looked in the direction where the woman's finger pointed. Even though he was hundreds of thousands of feet away, Zheng still saw many huge Man-eating Demon Flowers in the city. Moreover, they were more than a thousand times bigger than the one he had seen before!</p>

  <p>Each Man-eating Demon Flower was like a giant monster that prostrated on the ground. All seven heads of each flower looked at different directions.</p>

  <p>Zheng was really shocked as he witnessed the monstrosities below. With widened eyes, he asked, "How can these Man-eating Demon Flowers be so huge..."</p>

  <p>"Huge? Look once again carefully." As her eyes shifted to the other side, the pale-faced woman made Zheng look towards a horrendous scene.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes narrowed greatly as he clicked his tongue.</p>

  <p>Tens of thousands of miles away in front of the flying ship stood an even bigger Man-eating Demon Flower.</p>

  <p>The Man-eating Demon Flower was probably over ten thousand miles high.</p>

  <p>Moreover, its huge body was still curled up on the ground. If it stretched its body, it would probably be more than a hundred thousand miles long!</p>

  <p>"That is the king of the Man-eating Demon Flowers. It has already entered the fifteenth stage of the Other Shore Realm... The whole Sand Country is under its control. Such a monster governs the vast desert. It is the true ruler of the entire Gracious Province..." said the woman with a dejected look.</p>

  <p>"A plant can actually reach the Other Shore Realm and grow to such an extent! How can that be?" Zheng was stunned as his eyes fixated on the king of the Man-eating Demon Flowers.</p>

  <p>The woman smiled faintly. A nostalgic glimmer appeared in her eyes. "In this world… There are many weirder things..."</p>

  <p>"But there are so many Man-eating Demon Flowers! What do they live on?"</p>

  <p>Zheng asked with a curious expression.</p>

  <p>Since the Man-eating Demon Flowers had established a huge country, the number of Man-eating Demon Flowers was naturally huge. It was impossible to feed themselves only with outsiders that the people living in the sand brought to them.</p>

  <p>"Their food is the people living in the sand." Such is the harsh reality of this place..." A rather cold and determined look painted the woman's face as she answered Zheng's question.</p>

  <p>"They prey upon the people living in the sand? Why don't those people just run away?" Zheng clenched his fist as his conscience was touched by guilt. He had killed a few people living in the sand that had deceived him. Although he was not the Savior, they were still all human beings as he was.</p>

  <p>The woman looked at Zheng indifferently and said, "You are really not... from the Source World."</p>

  <p>In Zheng's subconsciousness, the human race should dominate the world. The other fierce beasts and monsters should be inferior to humans and they couldn't surpass humans. It was an agreed rule both in the universes and in the divine land.</p>

  <p>However, that was not the case in the Source World. The human race was limited to a few big forces, while the races formed by fierce beasts and monsters were the mainstream of the Source World.</p>
