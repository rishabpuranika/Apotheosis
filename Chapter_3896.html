<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The power of the three masters at the Holy Soul Realm burning their Other Shore Tokens would be quite intimidating.</p>

  <p>However, they had to pay the price of such power with their lives.</p>

  <p>"But..." Flamine hesitated. If they stayed, the reinforcements would come to aid them.</p>

  <p>She pitied the lives of these elders of the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>"Don't hesitate!" Pearce said seriously. "As soon as we go out, follow us,"</p>

  <p>Athemar declared with determination in his eyes.</p>

  <p>When the three of them were about to go out and burn their Other Shore Tokens, they heard a voice from above.</p>

  <p>"Since you can't escape death anyway, I can let you die a little faster," the voice said.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing the voice, Pearce and the others were shocked.</p>

  <p>Elvinia tilted her head and looked up at the sky. The owner of the familiar voice stood opposite the Five-Element Emissaries.</p>

  <p>Coincidentally the owner of the voice also looked down. Although he was a hundred thousand feet away, Elvinia felt that he was close, and a strange warm feeling filled her heart.</p>

  <p>Ordinary people would be overjoyed if they survived a disaster, but Elvinia wasn't. The warm feeling overwhelmed her senses, and she was calm and happy.</p>

  <p>"Is that Zheng?"</p>

  <p>"Is he awake?"</p>

  <p>"Has he made it to the Eternal Realm?"</p>

  <p>Even at such a critical moment, what they cared about was still whether Zheng had reached the Eternal Realm or not.</p>

  <p>If he had reached the Eternal Realm, then it naturally meant that he was stronger and might be able to defeat the Five-Element Emissaries.</p>

  <p>Speaking of the Five-Element Emissaries, they were all stunned when they saw Zheng, who appeared like a ghost.</p>

  <p>They weren't concerned about the battles of the masters at the Eternal Realm. After all, those had nothing to do with them.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the Pear Hill only had Fuxi and the Snake Goddess. They should be the weakest of the three parties, and they would surely be defeated.</p>

  <p>However, did it mean that the Pear Hill had won since Zheng appeared safe and sound?</p>

  <p>While the Five-Element Emissaries had yet to recover from their shock, the leader, the Metal Emissary, coldly said, "He is all alone, and he has just reached the Eternal Realm. He's no match for the five of us!"</p>

  <p>The Five-Element Emissaries were extremely powerful if they worked together. They could even fight Eternal Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>Since Zheng had just reached the Eternal Realm, there was a big difference between his strength and the senior Eternal Realm warriors'. Moreover, he was alone, so the Five-Element Emissaries didn't take him seriously.</p>

  <p>When the Metal Emissary finished speaking, he pointed towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The Golden Toad Lightning, as thick as a bucket, hit Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>The moment it touched him, the ancestry-level bloodline inside his body fluctuated, and he learned about the Golden Toad Lightning's structure.</p>

  <p>"The branch of the third lightning energy from the destruction area. It is not pure, and very weak."</p>

  <p>He reached out and grabbed the golden lightning in his hand.</p>

  <p>Because the lightning itself didn't have a real body, it could only flash by.</p>

  <p>However, it froze when he grabbed it. It was like a golden stone pillar, which extended from his hand to the front of the Metal Emissary.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>He squeezed hard. The golden stone pillar began to crack, and it shattered into countless pieces on the ground.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven had once used the Imprisoning Lightning on the Other Shore to transform the lightning, which the Magical Thunder Slave had released, into Solid Lightning Powder. That Imprisoning Lightning was from Stage Thirty-three, and it was not easy to obtain it.</p>

  <p>But with merely a thought, Zheng had transformed the Golden Toad Lightning by using a method that was very different from the Primeval Lord of Heaven's.</p>

  <p>"What kind of theurgy is that?"</p>

  <p>Naturally, the Five-Element Emissaries were all confused. They couldn't figure out how Zheng had solidified the lightning in an instant.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter! Let's fight together!"</p>

  <p>"Tribulation Array of Five Elements!"</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Each of the Five-Element Emissaries stood in their positions. Five different colored lights connected them, which formed a five-pointed star.</p>

  <p>They activated their array, which released a powerful aura of energy. Then, a large lock flew from the array and shot towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>At that point, Pearce, Athemar, and Goran just came out of the crack. When they felt the power of the array, all of them looked alarmed.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, retreat!</p>

  <p>Even the real Eternal Realm masters can't resist the Tribulation Array of Five Elements!" Pearce shouted.</p>

  <p>Zheng was speechless when he heard Pearce's warning. Did Pearce mean that he was not a real Eternal Realm warrior?</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>However, he didn't dodge.</p>

  <p>He allowed the lock to land on his body. "Oh?</p>

  <p>Why didn't you dodge?" the Water Emissary said with raised brows. "How arrogant of you! You will die!" The Earth Emissary laughed manically.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, the Fire Emissary looked vigilant.</p>

  <p>Among the Five-Element Emissaries, the Fire Emissary was the first one who had encountered Zheng.</p>

  <p>Not long after Zheng stepped onto the Other Shore, he had turned their temple in Stage Four upside down. At that time, they still didn't know who the mysterious man was.</p>

  <p>He was not a proud and arrogant man. He must be confident in himself, so he dared to do the things he did.</p>

  <p>As soon as the lock secured Zheng, the ancestry-level bloodline inside his body fluctuated again.</p>

  <p>The fluctuation of the ancestry-level bloodline caused by the Metal Emissary's attack and the Five-Element Emissaries' joint attack wasn't as intense as when it was against the Eternal Realm powerhouses.</p>

  <p>"Part of the theurgies used by the Five-Element Emissaries are from the Element Spirit race, right?" Zheng said. He grabbed the lock and pulled it slightly. "It's just so-so," he sighed.</p>

  <p>Just as he was about to break the lock, he suddenly looked up at the sky.</p>

  <p>The others didn't understand why he did that, but they also did the same.</p>

  <p>"It seems that I don't need to do anything," Zheng said and pursed his lips.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The space above suddenly shattered, and then a huge scorpion tail struck the Tribulation Array of Five Elements.</p>

  <p>Gerald didn't need to use his poison needles on the Five-Element Emissaries because they were too weak.</p>

  <p>His scorpion tail contained a potent amount of power, which was enough to break the Tribulation Array of Five Elements and crush the Five-Element Emissaries into meat paste.</p>

  <p>The lock that bound Zheng quickly disappeared when the Tribulation Array of Five Elements got destroyed.</p>

  <p>"We don't have much time. We need to finish the battle as soon as possible,"</p>

  <p>Gerald said.</p>

  <p>Even though only his tail was exposed, Pearce, Goran, and the others were still shocked at his aura as a Chaos Ancient God.</p>

  <p>After all, they didn't expect that Zheng came with Gerald!</p>

  <p>Yet, it wasn't the first time that the people from the Oneness Sky Palace had seen the world. When they realized that it was the Chaos Ancient God Gerald, they all cupped their hands towards him.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, Flamine arrived with Elvinia and Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>

  <p>Then everyone else jumped onto Gerald's back and headed for the Pear Hill.</p>

  <p>While they traveled, Zheng asked about Yasamin's whereabouts. Winchell, Auden, and the other elders of the Oneness Sky Palace escorted her. If they were lucky enough, they would be able to enter the Pear Hill's territory safely.</p>

  <p>However, when he asked about Dorothy, no one responded to him.</p>

  <p>According to Elvinia, Dorothy had been missing when Yasamin got trapped. When the people of the Oneness Sky Palace moved together, they still didn't see her.</p>
