<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Of course, letting Luo Zheng kill them like that was out of the question.</p>

  <p>According to their intel, there was no record of Luo Zheng being able to fly. They imagined Luo Zheng would be struck down by the human woman's club!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's flexible figure was reflected in Hans' eyes.</p>

  <p>"Aoo..."</p>

  <p>With a piercing cry from Hans, all the Star Falcons spread their wings and quickly distanced themselves from each other!</p>

  <p>This space between them made it difficult for Luo Zheng to kill them.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng could not fly very fast as he was relying on the Thunderstorm Divine Dao to fly.</p>

  <p>He had just been shot up into the air by Feng Ge's power, and as he rose he was able to strike down more than twenty Star Falcons in an instant with his great power. But now, he began to get slower and slower.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>He rushed at another Star Falcon, who suddenly tilted his wings and flew to the other side, dodging Luo Zheng's attack with great agility.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng failed to hit anything, a huge Star Falcon dashed towards him.</p>

  <p>His name was Garth and he was Hans' assistant, second only to Hans in terms of strength and status in the Star Falcon race.</p>

  <p>On the front end of his wings were many silver spangles.</p>

  <p>The surface of the spangles was engraved with an ancient array. Under the array, all the spangles were sharp as blades.</p>

  <p>This was the magic weapon created by the Riverside race.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>Garth raised his wings and charged at Luo Zheng at an astonishing speed, moving like a flying saber. In the blink of an eye, he slashed at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Seeing the dazzling spangles on his wings, Luo Zheng abruptly somersaulted in the air and nimbly dodged the attack.</p>

  <p>But the Star Falcon race was a flying race after all, so every member could pretty much fly from birth. Naturally they were more experienced in aerial combat than human beings.</p>

  <p>Garth seemed to have predicted Luo Zheng's movement and as he moved backwards, Garth screeched excitedly and flew in the same direction as he did. He rushed towards him rotating his body at the same time!</p>

  <p>"Swish, swish, swish..."</p>

  <p>The other Star Falcons' eyes ignited with joy on seeing this.</p>

  <p>"Garth's blade cyclone!"</p>

  <p>"It will cut anything in its path to tiny pieces!"</p>

  <p>"That brat is doomed!"</p>

  <p>The Star Falcons hadn't expected Luo Zheng to kill more than twenty of their companions in an instant, so their great resentment was to be expected. Of course they hoped that Garth would chop Luo Zheng into pieces and that they could then eat him after.</p>

  <p>However, what they did not know was that battling with the physical body was the least of Luo Zheng's fears.</p>

  <p>Garth's wings rotated crazily and rolled towards Luo Zheng, when in a flash Luo Zheng grabbed at Garth ferociously.</p>

  <p>"How dare you lay your hands on me! Brat!" Garth sneered.</p>

  <p>The spangles on his wings were called 'Heavenly Feather Teeth'. Each of them was carefully made by the most renowned craftsmen of the Riverside race. In order to make and gather 36 spangles, both the Riverside race and the Star Falcon race had paid a hefty price.</p>

  <p>Except for a few defensive weapons of Stage Fourteen, nothing else could withstand the wings' slicing ability, let alone the physical human body. Even the city walls of the Myriad Spirits City were soft as mud before his wings.</p>

  <p>A huge clang rang out as Luo Zheng's hand blocked Garth's right wing. Not only had his wing failed to cut Luo Zheng's hand, it had slammed into something unbelievably hard!</p>

  <p>"Oh no! What is in this human brat's palm? It has somehow managed to block my Heavenly Feather Teeth!"</p>

  <p>Garth was startled and attempted to withdraw his right wing.</p>

  <p>Only then did he feel Luo Zheng's iron grip as his hand didn't budge at all. Garth was stuck.</p>

  <p>In a moment of desperation, he slashed at Luo Zheng with his left wing, but before the blow could land, his wing was clamped by Luo Zheng's other hand!</p>

  <p>"Aoo..."</p>

  <p>In a panic, Garth squawked a sharp cry for help, at the same time dragging Luo Zheng and rolling desperately in the air.</p>

  <p>Even Hans, the leader, had believed that Garth could defeat Luo Zheng, yet he had cried for help so soon. He was considered as one of the best fighters in the Star Falcon race!</p>

  <p>Shocked at the scene before them, no Star Falcon nearby dared to rush forward!</p>

  <p>Finally, Hans flew up and swooped at Luo Zheng. No matter what, he had to save Garth first!</p>

  <p>"He is finally coming!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng noticed Hans approaching as he was rolling over.</p>

  <p>The most effective method was to kill the leader of the race first, just as he had killed the leader of the Dark Bear race and then destroyed the rest.</p>

  <p>Once the leader was taken care of, dealing with the rest would be a piece of cake.</p>

  <p>Hans was massive and had been issuing all the orders. Luo Zheng had long set his sights on him as his highest priority target.</p>

  <p>"Hey..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng grabbed Garth's wings and pulled him towards his chest. Garth shot at him with a shriek.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng curled up and suddenly stretched his legs out to bounce off of Garth!</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng kicked off him releasing a power of around 2000 Jun.</p>

  <p>The physical body of a bird was weaker than an ordinary creature. How could Garth bear this force?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's foot prints sank down into Garth's chest. The bones and viscera in his body shattered and his huge body plummeted down.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng darted like an arrow, at incredible speed once more, by using the counterforce.</p>

  <p>As the chief leader of the Star Falcon race, Hans was the smartest and most powerful of them all.</p>

  <p>He remained vigilant, his eyes focused intently as he approached Luo Zheng. He had seen how he handled Garth and this put him on guard.</p>

  <p>To Hans' surprise, when he was still over 200 feet away, Luo Zheng had stamped on Garth and rushed to him by means of the counterforce!</p>

  <p>'I'm his target?'</p>

  <p>An idea popped into Hans' mind.</p>

  <p>"Illusory Transformation! Escape!"</p>

  <p>The bird's innate alertness would probably save him, if Luo Zheng was not the one he was up against.</p>

  <p>Hans displayed a weird movement skill. His wings rolled and formed many golden shadows which spread in all directions like thousands of Star Falcons.</p>

  <p>"You hope to escape with just a little trick?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's gaze was fixed on Hans' real figure and he stretched out towards him.</p>

  <p>But his hand went right through the figure like it was a cloud and it disappeared before his eyes.</p>

  <p>This bodily movement skill was somewhat similar to the Eight Smoky Melodies that Luo Zheng had cultivated and even the feather of Wing King.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, using such a skill before Luo Zheng was a display of one's meager ability to an expert.</p>
