  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng wore a grim expression, failing to see the attacks from both sides clearly.</p>

  <p>Although the irregular heavy sword was able to protect him, Zheng knew it would take a toll on it if it suffered attacks all the time.</p>

  <p>"How are you able to make the sword block each strike?" Zheng asked the ancestry-level bloodline, clenching the irregular heavy sword tightly. "The way the Snake Spirit King's body moves is unique, I can't understand it. I can't seem to predict his next move..."</p>

  <p>There were two types of movement in the chaos: the first was to use explosive speed, and the other was to use spatial transference.</p>

  <p>Any bodily movement skill or any space theurgy fell under these two kinds of movement, but it was possible for each one to differ, since anyone could use them differently.</p>

  <p>However, the way the Snake Spirit King moved didn't seem to belong to either of the two types of movement.</p>

  <p>Gritting his teeth, Zheng attempted to use his spiritual sense to see if he could capture the Snake Spirit King's trajectory. Just moments earlier, Zheng thought that the Snake Spirit King was going to attack him head on, but a split second later, he suddenly appeared behind Zheng. Just when he felt the black blades slashing at his face, the next moment, they appeared above his head.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King seemed to exist in a special space outside Zheng's comprehension, since all the attacks came at him at random. There was just no possible way for him to predict the Snake Spirit King's next move.</p>

  <p>"But your sword can," the ancestry-level bloodline replied, reading his mind.</p>

  <p>"My sword..."</p>

  <p>Zheng examined the irregular heavy sword closely.</p>

  <p>He could vividly feel the sword's strong fighting intent-- in fact, the sword's emotions were so strong that even Zheng felt like he was full of fighting intent.</p>

  <p>The sword seemed to have fallen into a state of madness as it desperately chased after the Snake Spirit King.</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng was hesitating, Corbett, who was standing at the top of the altar, suddenly took a few steps forward.</p>

  <p>"Master Corbett, what are you doing?" the Snake Goddess cried.</p>

  <p>"I have to remind him," Corbett replied, his eyes trained on Zheng in the distance. "Master Kincaid once said that the strength of this sword always matches that of its master."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked, his curiosity piqued.</p>

  <p>"The stronger the warrior who holds the sword is, the greater the power of the sword," Corbett spoke, almost as though in a daze. "Master Kincaid was filled with regret many times, since he felt he was unable to bring out the sword's full potential."</p>

  <p>"Master Kincaid didn't know how to use the sword? Why couldn't he use its full strength?" the Snake Goddess asked dubiously.</p>

  <p>"No, Master Kincaid knew this sword very well," Corbett replied. "He said that he and this sword had become one, but he always thought the sword deserved someone better."</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess's eyes flashed excitedly. "Are you saying that even Master Kincaid didn't deserve this sword, even on his level of strength?</p>

  <p>What about the power of the ancestry-level bloodline?"</p>

  <p>Corbett smiled. "Master Kincaid has tried, but he couldn't control the ancestry-level bloodline."</p>

  <p>"But Zheng can!" the Snake Goddess said excitedly.</p>

  <p>"Yes." Corbett nodded. "But he doesn't completely control the sword."</p>

  <p>Zheng could only communicate with and passively provide energy for the irregular heavy sword. However, the irregular heavy sword acted on its own, and Zheng had no control over it.</p>

  <p>So this whole time, Zheng was being helplessly dragged by the sword all throughout the battle. It was almost as though he were a burden to the sword.</p>

  <p>"Then, what should we do now?" the Snake Goddess frowned.</p>

  <p>"I need to remind him!" As he spoke, Corbett took a few more steps forward. Standing at the edge of the stairs at the top of the altar, he shouted, "Zheng, although Master Kincaid's sword has acknowledged you, you haven't really controlled it yet!"</p>

  <p>At this moment, Zheng had been deep in thought, trying to think of solutions. When he heard what Corbett said, his brows shot up in astonishment. "I haven't really controlled this sword? I'm already connected to it, what more do I need to do to be able to control it?"</p>

  <p>Just as Corbett was about to answer him, the voice of the Snake Spirit King suddenly boomed. "Shut up!"</p>

  <p>Then, the black blades flew towards Corbett.</p>

  <p>Clatter, clatter, clatter...</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King wielded the black blades to cut a hundred times. In the blink of an eye, Corbett was sliced into countless, tiny white pieces.</p>

  <p>Corbett was tens of thousands of feet away from Zheng, yet the Snake Spirit King managed to cut him up and return back to Zheng in a flash.</p>

  <p>How fast he moved was absolutely terrifying.</p>

  <p>Even the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and the others standing behind couldn't help but take a few cautious steps backward.</p>

  <p>Only Gonggong stood still, his hands clasped behind his back.</p>

  <p>He was keenly aware that they were in no condition to face the Snake Spirit King, and that trying to escape was futile. Thus, he decided to just stay calm.</p>

  <p>After all, Corbett was a Treacherous Being.</p>

  <p>It didn't take long before the countless, thin white pieces gathered together and merged to form Corbett's figure. Continuing where he left off, he started to shout again. "It's not what you think it is. Zheng, you can treat the irregular heavy sword as a cultivation method in an ancient book. You have to truly understand it..."</p>

  <p>"An ancient book, understand it..."</p>

  <p>Zheng echoed under his breath. His heartbeat quickened as he held the sword tightly. Perhaps he had underestimated the sword, maybe that was why the Snake Spirit King was so eager to obtain it!</p>

  <p>Since he had faith that the irregular heavy sword would protect him, he fused his spiritual sense into the sword.</p>

  <p>Swoosh...</p>

  <p>Once there, he saw a red ball of light.</p>

  <p>One hundred and forty light dots surrounded the ball of light, and from these light dots extended countless, densely-packed thin lines.</p>

  <p>Zheng observed it for a while. He soon discovered that whenever the ancestry-level bloodline injected energy into the irregular heavy sword, the energy surged to the light dots following along the different thin lines.</p>

  <p>Some of the light spots became incomparably bright after they obtained energy, while others became dim.</p>

  <p>One hundred and forty dots of light...</p>

  <p>One hundred and forty...</p>

  <p>As Zheng pondered over this number, turning it over in his mind, his eyes suddenly lit up as it finally dawned on him.</p>

  <p>"One hundred and forty! The number of the types of energy in the Deep Space!"</p>

  <p>The ancestry-level bloodline once told Zheng that there were eighty-six types of energy in the sixth-grade world, while there were one hundred and forty types in the fifth-grade world, otherwise known as the Stellar World. The irregular heavy sword came from the Deep Space, which was the Stellar World that the ancestry-level bloodline referred to!</p>

  <p>All this time, the sword converted the energy of the fourth-grade world into the energy of the fifth-grade world.</p>

  <p>'Since the irregular heavy sword can use the energy of the fifth-grade world, then that should mean I can use it, too!' Zheng thought excitedly.</p>

  <p>Ever since he obtained the sword, he had only been able to feel its emotions. Although the irregular heavy sword acknowledged Zheng, it still was fiercely loyal to Kincaid, believing he was its true master.</p>

  <p>Even Zheng thought the same. After all, it was a sword borrowed from the Human Spirit King. He knew it would be returned to him in the end.</p>

  <p>But now, Zheng realized that if he wanted to defeat the Snake Spirit King and the power behind him, he needed to gain control over this sword.</p>

  <p>Just as Corbett had said, he needed to treat this sword as a cultivation method in an ancient book to understand it.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>Zheng willed his spiritual sense to reach into the red light ball in the center.</p>

  <p>When it came into contact with the red light ball, Zheng could feel it resisting him.</p>

  <p>The irregular heavy sword was still unwilling to accept him.</p>

  <p>"I know you miss your former master.</p>

  <p>But only I can exert your power to the extreme," Zheng gently coaxed. "You should know what kind of power I have.</p>

  <p>If we want to bring Master Kincaid back to life, we have only one choice: we need to defeat the opponent in front of us!</p>

  <p>Accept me!"</p>

  <p>Zheng urged the sword through his spiritual sense.</p>

  <p>Gradually, he felt the resistance becoming weaker and weaker.</p>

  <p>Finally, Zheng was able to integrate his spiritual sense with the red ball of light successfully.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>At this moment, Zheng felt as if his mind had been smashed by a heavy hammer. A massive amount of information streamed in, information about the countless permutations of the one hundred and forty light dots.</p>

  <p>At the same time...</p>

  <p>It also informed Zheng about the energy used by the Snake Spirit King and the irregular heavy sword, and he even figured out its strange name.</p>

  <p>"Probability Extreme Form!"</p>

  <p>"Whoosh..."</p>

  <p>Then, traces of black energy streamed into Zheng's body from the irregular heavy sword.</p>
