<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2919 An Approaching Flying Ship </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>The silence in the maze was deafening. Zheng could not hear any other sounds aside from his own footsteps.</p>

  <p>Zheng initially started walking quickly. But after realizing how large the maze was, he lightly tapped the tip of his toe and flew away.</p>

  <p>However, the terribly large maze was still beyond Zheng's imagination. Even after travelling through it the entire day and night, he still could not see the exit.</p>

  <p>The days seemed never ending inside the maze.</p>

  <p>On the third day, Zheng walked along a black passageway, hoping to reach the end. After turning a corner, he was surprised to notice that the passageway in front of him suddenly changed.</p>

  <p>The walls on both sides of the passageway were shining with a colorful light.</p>

  <p>"Er? The fragments of time?"</p>

  <p>Zheng couldn't help assuming, feeling an intense aura of the Time Law from the walls. It was exactly the same aura he felt from the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>Tapping the fragments on the wall gently, he found nothing unusual.</p>

  <p>However, as Zheng continued to move forward, he faintly heard a soft breath near his ears.</p>

  <p>Phew! Phew!</p>

  <p>It appeared like someone was sleeping in the maze.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the sound of breathing echoed in Zheng's ears, making him think he was getting closer to this person's location.</p>

  <p>Frowning slightly, Zheng flew away along the passageway. He wanted to find out the source of the breathing.</p>

  <p>After rushing tens of thousands of feet, he could still hear the breathing sound floating in his ears. It sounded like it was still by his side, even though he had already traveled so far.</p>

  <p>Even with the strange feeling in his heart, he still bit the bullet and continued his way.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Emily sat on the top of the divine land and looked up at the vast chaos.</p>

  <p>She had missed the days in the Source World a lot of times.</p>

  <p>But after she had managed to flee from the prison, she got eaten up by depression.</p>

  <p>After opening the barrier of the divine land, she should be able to return to the Source World. Looking afar, she wondered how the Rose Sect was doing right now.</p>

  <p>If the leader of a sect went missing or dead, the sect members were expected to select a new leader.</p>

  <p>If she returned to the Source World, the position of the sect leader would probably be lost.</p>

  <p>But that was not something that made Emily worry. She was more concerned about her disciples and her clan members.</p>

  <p>Gazing into the chaos, she saw a faint cyan light from a distance.</p>

  <p>It was almost negligible from where she sat. However, the speed at which the cyan light was travelling stirred Emily's vigilance.</p>

  <p>That thing was closing in too fast, and it was coming straight towards the divine land.</p>

  <p>Standing up slowly, Emily called out a warning. "Something is coming!"</p>

  <p>Seeing the cautious look on Emily's face, everyone was alerted.</p>

  <p>There weren't many creatures wandering around in the chaos, but each of them was extremely powerful. Even a warrior at the Other Shore Realm had to be careful when facing them.</p>

  <p>"How fast!" exclaimed Leopold, staring straight ahead.</p>

  <p>A woman with black hair from the Snake Goddess race came to look as well. Stretching out her finger and putting it on her eyelid, she gently spit out a single word, "Reveal!"</p>

  <p>One of her eyes flashed with a strange luster, while the other one started blinking. Soon, her face reflected a strange expression as she explained,</p>

  <p>"That's not a living creature."</p>

  <p>"Then what is it?" Emily asked.</p>

  <p>"A flying ship," the black-haired woman answered in a serious tone.</p>

  <p>Everyone's expression changed slightly when they heard the words.</p>

  <p>Flying ships were common in the Source World, but not in this place.</p>

  <p>This was the place on the edge of chaos. Who would have been so bored to go to the edge of the chaos? Besides, the flying ship was very close to where they were. Judging by how it was swiftly moving, the people inside that ship must have marked the divine land as their target.</p>

  <p>Walking over to where Emily was, Timotheus looked at her and asked,</p>

  <p>"What do you think?"</p>

  <p>Shaking her head, Emily answered, "I don't know what their purpose is."</p>

  <p>"No matter what that is, once they discover the divine land, the situation will be very troublesome," Timotheus commented with a frown.</p>

  <p>Knowing the current situation of the Nine Li race, Timotheus and the others were certain they couldn't let anyone know about the existence of the divine land. Thus, Timotheus felt concerned. What if people from the Source World found about it?</p>

  <p>Emily smiled faintly, "If their strength is ordinary, just let them come. It's not a big deal."</p>

  <p>Timotheus nodded, confirming his agreement.</p>

  <p>Lorena, Mike, Moon and the Holy Beings of the Sword Clan gathered together. Lorena was unable to hide her worried expression the entire time.</p>

  <p>"I don't know if Zheng has succeeded in becoming a Holy Being."</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Mike remained very calm. "As long as Zheng is in the Mountain of Holy Beings, the biggest difficulty has been solved. It doesn't matter whether he can become a Holy Being or not, but..."</p>

  <p>Remembering his prediction based on his Evolution Godly Way, he knew that there would be danger outside the divine land.</p>

  <p>But there was nothing in the chaos except for them. He couldn't understand why his prediction suggested an upcoming danger.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, Timotheus approached and announced lightly, "We need to hide."</p>

  <p>All the Holy Beings looked at him with a confused expression. "Why?"</p>

  <p>Lorena asked.</p>

  <p>Cupping his hands, Timotheus faced Lorena and answered, "There is a flying ship coming towards the divine land. We can't tell if it's an enemy or a friend. You need to leave and stay away to be safe, Princess Lorena."</p>

  <p>"A flying ship?" Lorena frowned upon hearing the news.</p>

  <p>Mike's face darkened when he heard of this, realizing that it might have something to do with his prediction. Since it was not a good thing to have outsiders at this critical moment, he asked, "Where is it now?"</p>

  <p>Timotheus pointed to afar, making everyone look in the same direction.</p>

  <p>They saw the cyan light approaching quickly.</p>

  <p>"For your safety, Princess Lorena, please enter the small world I have prepared," Timotheus recommended.</p>

  <p>However, Lorena declined, shaking her head mildly. "I won't go into the small world."</p>

  <p>Timotheus tried to persuade her, but Lorena insisted on staying. In the end, he had to give up.</p>

  <p>Though it was true that hiding in the small world, or their inner worlds, would guarantee their safety, they would know nothing about the outside world. In fact, it was not only Lorena who was reluctant to enter the small world, but also the other Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>"If that will be the case, I'll have Ramzi make an array to hide us," said Timotheus.</p>

  <p>The time flew slowly while they waited.</p>

  <p>Four hours later, the Trumpet Flying Ship was very close to the divine land.</p>

  <p>In front of Godfrey, a small jade plate floated in the air, and he was holding a light cyan crystal.</p>

  <p>Known to contain an astonishing amount of energy, this crystal was so-called the divine crystal, and was widely used in the Source World.</p>

  <p>After gently flipping the divine crystal, he placed it on the jade plate, allowing it to sink into the plate.</p>

  <p>"The last divine crystal has been set," Godfrey reported.</p>

  <p>"According to the Yellow Emperor Guards in the divine land, the Nine Li Guards are at the top of the divine land, but we haven't come across any of them yet," another Yellow Emperor Guard said.</p>

  <p>Looking leisurely at the large divine land in front of him, Clement was in his best mood. In a light voice, he ordered, "First, activate the Slaughtering Moonlight Array. Then we will descend!"</p>
