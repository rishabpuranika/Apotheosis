<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had made it here, so he was in no hurry. Since the Primeval Lord of Heaven now wished to observe and study, he would let him do so.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven had lived for over a thousand chaotic eras.</p>

  <p>Although he was not as skilled at deciphering Sanskrit words as Luo Nian, his attainments in Sanskrit words were still notable.</p>

  <p>As long as the words weren't too complicated, he would have little trouble reading them.</p>

  <p>The carvings contained many secrets of the inner workings of the world and while he pondered over them, he seemed to have resolved many doubts he held in his heart.</p>

  <p>There were some things he didn't know or couldn't understand before, but he was able to find them on the carvings on both sides of the path.</p>

  <p>"I see...</p>

  <p>I did not expect that!" the Primeval Lord of Heaven exclaimed in a number of strange ways, while Luo Zheng slowly moved forward.</p>

  <p>As he moved further and the patterns on the walls turned more complex, the Primeval Lord of Heaven exclaimed less, simply because they were too complicated for him to understand.</p>

  <p>Eventually, the Primeval Lord of Heaven said, "Hurry up. I can't understand any of them anymore."</p>

  <p>In this world, the unknown always outweighed the known.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded and sped up.</p>

  <p>Beneath the soul cloud, all the Souls of Light stretched their necks, watching Luo Zheng's every move.</p>

  <p>What took place had nothing to do with them, but once they left the Soul City, they would most definitely report in great detail the events that transpired.</p>

  <p>"So many years have passed, and finally someone is able to enter that cabin!"</p>

  <p>"Will he be able to come back?"</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, be careful..."</p>

  <p>Some were jealous, some were envious, and some even cursed under their breath.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge though, was a little worried.</p>

  <p>She had heard of the origin of the Soul City, but she had never thought that Luo Zheng would be able to reach its top.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng took a few more steps and an exquisite wide square with all sorts of obscure patterns around it, hanging in the air, came into view.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven could not understand them but this did not stop Luo Zheng. He passed through the hanging square and a small ladder was placed in front of him. Above the ladder was the door to the cabin with a spire.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng climbed the ladder and at the top, saw a wooden gray door.</p>

  <p>"This door... is not made of souls?" Luo Zheng muttered, raising his eyebrows in confusion.</p>

  <p>Everything in the Soul City was constructed from the souls; buildings, floors, walls, ladders, and so on.</p>

  <p>However, the door of the cabin was different. It was just an ordinary wooden door. It seemed the door had been there a long time as the entire thing looked gray.</p>

  <p>A small iron ring hung on the left side of the door. Luo Zheng stretched his hand out and gently knocked it against the door.</p>

  <p>But the knock did not ring out...</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng felt something soft in his hand, and the iron ring had already been embedded in the door. It appeared to be made of dust. After a gentle touch, it collapsed into a cloud of dust drowning Luo Zheng beneath it.</p>

  <p>Gradually, the dust dissipated.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng still held the iron ring in his hand as he peered into the cabin.</p>

  <p>The interior was decorated very simply; the walls were plastered with gravel and the floor was covered with a gray blanket. In the center of the blanket stood a small wooden table with a little golden pot atop it.</p>

  <p>A wisp of pale yellow flame flickered at the opening of the pot, illuminating the cabin.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stepped on the blanket and it puffed into another cloud of dust.</p>

  <p>"Puff!"</p>

  <p>It was not just the blanket but the table as well that had collapsed into dust at the slightest contact.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The golden pot fell to the floor with a solid thud and the flame was extinguished.</p>

  <p>The flame died out and the light in the room dimmed. At the same time, the light throughout the entire Soul City began dimming as well.</p>

  <p>"Hoo..."</p>

  <p>Soul faces began appearing one by one on the walls around the Soul City!</p>

  <p>Some faces looked like humans and the souls appeared in human form.</p>

  <p>Some appeared as strange beasts, some had slender bodies, some were flat, some were jagged...</p>

  <p>For a moment, all sorts of strange souls floated around the Soul City.</p>

  <p>"Awoo..."</p>

  <p>They rushed out of the wall and soon found that this time was a little different. In the center of the Soul City, there seemed to be a large number of Souls of Light near the soul pillar!</p>

  <p>These Souls of Light were still alive and were the most delicious living creatures they had ever seen!</p>

  <p>"Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh..."</p>

  <p>For a moment, the souls rushed crazily at the Souls of Light.</p>

  <p>"Where did these things come from?" Dailey asked, caution growing within him.</p>

  <p>A few brown souls rushed over. He stretched his hand out and began slashing it out.</p>

  <p>"Soul Whipping Skill!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly, his five fingers elongated and turned into five slender whips, lashing forward.</p>

  <p>"Crack! Crack! Crack..."</p>

  <p>All the souls shattered with a thunderous clap.</p>

  <p>Those who could reach Stage Twenty-nine of the Other Shore all possessed Indigo Souls of the ultimate level. They all fought back at the souls rushing at them.</p>

  <p>As for Feng Ge, she had no trouble at all destroying those souls charging at her.</p>

  <p>Any souls that dared approach her were swiftly smashed to powder by her gentle palm strike.</p>

  <p>When they had rushed out of the wall, the door at the entrance of the Soul City had rumbled like an earthquake!</p>

  <p>"Is the door to the Soul City closing?"</p>

  <p>"What's going on! Why is it closing so early?"</p>

  <p>"Get out of the Soul City right now!"</p>

  <p>All the Soul City's terrible legends came to everyone's mind.</p>

  <p>The front door to the Soul City was about to close and they were still a ways away from it.</p>

  <p>"Hoo, hoo..."</p>

  <p>Just then, countless souls rushed out of the soul cloud, their surfaces faintly coated in gold. The aura they emitted was quite obviously much stronger than that of the other souls.</p>

  <p>One of the members of the Separate Abyss race stood right below the soul cloud. He was swallowed by a large fish-shaped golden soul before he even had the time to react.</p>

  <p>His miserable screams echoed from the belly of the giant fish, but soon after disappeared...</p>

  <p>"Anson has been eaten by that big fish!" Toby roared.</p>

  <p>The others of the Separate Abyss race all cried in horror as well.</p>

  <p>It was then that the door to Soul City shut completely with a monstrous bang.</p>
