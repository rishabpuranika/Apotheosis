<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2863 Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seeds </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>The Jade Toad Mountain was a blessed place full of spiritual energy, and it was also the core area of the royal family of the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>Houses were built in a neat arrangement on the hillside.</p>

  <p>Back then, during the monsoon season when buckets of rain had poured down from the sky, a light film had been activated. That film of light around the Jade Toad Mountain had protected all the people and houses from even a single drop of rain.</p>

  <p>It was during this heavy downpour that Lorena was born.</p>

  <p>The nine tribes of the Nine Li race had celebrated her birth for three months. Obviously, Chiyou, the Grand Chieftain, had loved his youngest daughter very much.</p>

  <p>At that time, although there were many conflicts between the Nine Li race and the Yellow Emperor race, the overall situation had been stable.</p>

  <p>As for Lorena, she had continued to win the hearts of everyone around her as she grew up.</p>

  <p>Leopold had not yet been exiled at that time, so he had known of Lorena's existence as well.</p>

  <p>However, he had not been a highly-ranked member of the Nine Li race, so he had never gotten the chance to meet her in person. This was the first time that he had ever seen her.</p>

  <p>"Get up. You don't need to be so courteous to me. I'm afraid I'm no longer the honored princess," said Lorena indifferently.</p>

  <p>Of course, she was happy that she had at least been reunited with her husband and her children.</p>

  <p>The situation seemed to be turning around for the better.</p>

  <p>However, all of the members of the Nine Li race in the divine land were gone, and she didn't know the situation of the Nine Li race in the Source World. What about the Grand Chieftain? And what about those Nine Li Guards?</p>

  <p>She didn't dare to think about these matters at all.</p>

  <p>Timotheus, Leopold, and the others slowly stood up. "No matter the situation, you will always be our princess," Timotheus said firmly.</p>

  <p>Staring at the Nine Li Guards, Lorena forced a smile. No matter what it was, she felt grateful to them.</p>

  <p>The truth was, these Nine Li Guards were so powerful that they could return to the Source World at any time and get a handsome reward by joining other major forces.</p>

  <p>However, even though the influence of the Nine Li race was declining, they were still on Lorena's side, and loyal to the Nine Li race. Such loyalty was rare.</p>

  <p>"Princess Lorena, right before I was exiled, the Yellow Emperor race was about to have a battle with our race in Gilt Town. I wonder how that turned out," Leopold said.</p>

  <p>He had already heard from Zheng that the Nine Li race had lost the battle, but he still wanted to hear the truth directly from Lorena, even if it brought back some bad memories for her.</p>

  <p>"The battle in Gilt Town was a twist of our race's fate. Our race was defeated in that battle. Even my father was injured," Lorena replied with her head down.</p>

  <p>"Grand Chieftain has always been much stronger than Yellow Emperor.</p>

  <p>And the Nine Li Guards are more powerful than the Yellow Emperor Guards. How was our race defeated?" Timotheus asked with a frown.</p>

  <p>He had always thought that the Nine Li race was too powerful to be defeated by any other race in the Source World.</p>

  <p>"You're right. But in Gilt Town, our Nine Li race didn't just have to face the Yellow Emperor race— they also had to face the Divine Farmer race."</p>

  <p>Lorena shook her head sadly.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>Timotheus's jaw dropped in shock. None of the Nine Li Guards could believe what they had just heard.</p>

  <p>"The Divine Farmer race was situated in a remote place, and it never allied with or fought against other races. Moreover, it had a few conflicts with the Yellow Emperor race as well. So why did it choose to ally with the Yellow Emperor race?" Leopold murmured.</p>

  <p>Although these people had been away from the Source World for so many years, they were still familiar with the conflicts among the big forces there.</p>

  <p>The members of the Divine Farmer race were famous in the Source World for their kindness and righteousness. It didn't make sense for them to have attacked the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>Lorena shook her head helplessly. "I don't know either. My father didn't tell us the reason. He just asked us to leave the Source World."</p>

  <p>"Even if Grand Chieftain created the divine land and asked you to leave, he must have sent guards to protect you. How were the Yellow Emperor Guards able to kill all of our warriors?" Ramzi said in disbelief. But after a nudge from Timotheus, he realized that he had overreacted. "I'm sorry. I'm not challenging Grand Chieftain's arrangement. Still, it didn't make sense."</p>

  <p>"The divine land was protected by Harper," Lorena answered after mulling it over for a while.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing this, Leopold couldn't help but butt in. "Harper? The three-star Nine Li Guard? He is too weak. I don't think he is qualified to protect you."</p>

  <p>Ramzi and Timotheus had never heard of Harper, but Leopold knew him.</p>

  <p>Harper was a smart but weak man. He was a relatively well-known military counselor in the Nine Li race, but in terms of fighting capacity, he was far from powerful.</p>

  <p>Anyway, no matter how awful the situation in the Nine Li race had been, there should have been several strong warriors assigned to protect Lorena and the divine land.</p>

  <p>After all, Lorena was Chiyou's beloved daughter. To protect her, it was reasonable to send even eighty-one mages, or five-star Nine Li Guards like Timotheus.</p>

  <p>Leopold's words caught Lorena off guard, and she didn't know how to reply.</p>

  <p>'That's true. Why did Father arrange things this way?' she wondered.</p>

  <p>Just then, she felt a broad arm rest on her shoulder. She turned and saw Mike smiling at her. "If the aim was to save the Nine Li race's bloodline, the best way to do it would be to put all the people of the race inside the inner world of a mighty warrior and ask that warrior to run away, wouldn't it? It's the most convenient way. The chaos is so vast! How would Yellow Emperor be able to find that warrior? Aren't I right?"</p>

  <p>Everyone, including Timotheus and Ramzi, was taken aback at Mike's words.</p>

  <p>Until now, although the Nine Li Guards knew that this Holy Being was Lorena's husband, they hadn't paid any attention to him. They only had respect for Zheng and Lorena. Mike's words, however, made too much sense for them to ignore.</p>

  <p>"You are right," Timotheus admitted, nodding slowly.</p>

  <p>It wouldn't be a problem at all for an Other Shore Realm warrior to keep all the members of the Nine Li race in their inner world.</p>

  <p>"But Chiyou didn't do that, which means that he must have secretly released the divine land into the chaos. No one else knew about it," continued Mike.</p>

  <p>"Even if he secretly released the divine land, he still could have sent mighty warriors to protect it," Leopold retorted.</p>

  <p>"And then? Did he build the divine land only to save the Nine Li bloodline?</p>

  <p>Or so that the members of the Nine Li race can live there happily? If that was the case, Chiyou should have had a better choice," said Mike.</p>

  <p>"You seem to know something," Timotheus commented, staring intently at Mike.</p>

  <p>Ever since the Sacred race disappeared, the divine land had been occupied by the later-born divine citizens. Then, outstanding people like Nicholas, Mike, and Bromley had gradually come into being. However, they no longer belonged to the Nine Li race, and they didn't have Chiyou's blood.</p>

  <p>The divine land was a huge relic for these people. They cultivated from a low-rank True God to a Holy Being, slowly exploring the various secrets of the divine land. Even if they hadn't found out everything about the divine land, they had their guesses.</p>

  <p>The origin of the divine land and the disappearance of the Sacred race were all secrets that had been left behind in the ancient times and spawned various legends.</p>

  <p>It was not until Lorena's appearance that these secrets had come to light.</p>

  <p>It was only then that Mike had learned about the origin of the divine land, and that there was actually a wider space outside the divine land where Other Shore Realm warriors, who were stronger than even Holy Beings, existed.</p>

  <p>However, there was still one question that puzzled Mike: what was Chiyou's purpose of creating the divine land?</p>

  <p>"The most important things in the divine land aren't the Soaring Snake Sword, the forbidden areas, or even the divine land itself. The most important things are the two seeds and the Infinity Ruler," Mike said indifferently.</p>

  <p>"Seeds? Infinity Ruler?"</p>

  <p>The Nine Li Guards were confused.</p>

  <p>"My father gave me these two seeds and the Infinity Ruler. These seeds are Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seeds. One of them stores the bloodline of our Nine Li race, while the other stores the bloodline of the Snake Goddess race. It's said that Snake Goddess personally gave the seed to my father,"</p>

  <p>Lorena explained.</p>

  <p>Then, she looked to the other side where Emily and the others from the Snake Goddess race were sitting.</p>

  <p>Until now, they hadn't participated in the conversation at all since it was regarding an internal matter of the Nine Li race. But after hearing that one of the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seeds had been given by the Snake Goddess race, Emily opened her eyes.</p>
