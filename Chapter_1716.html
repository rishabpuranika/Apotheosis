  <p>
</p>

  <p>Despite this, Luo Zheng was not even the least bit discouraged.</p>

  <p>The chaotic energy appeared once again...</p>

  <p>His Chaotic Gods-intimidating Strike slashed out again!</p>

  <p>It was accompanied by the keen roar of the sword!</p>

  <p>"Sssii!"</p>

  <p>Tianming was at a distance of only ten feet from Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Thus Luo Zheng could instantly close on him!</p>

  <p>As Tianming's hand raised, the sword beam, like a silver python, once again darted forward to cleave apart Zheng's Chaotic Gods-intimidating Strike!</p>

  <p>The sword light split in two, harmlessly falling either side of Tianming, and he still stood in front of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Again!"</p>

  <p>"Again!"</p>

  <p>The chaotic energy in Zheng's body was being rapidly consumed...</p>

  <p>It wasn't that Luo Zheng was weak either.</p>

  <p>Once activated with chaotic energy, even an ordinary cultivation method would become much more powerful than others!</p>

  <p>Besides, Luo Zheng had acquired enlightenment from Lone's sword. The sword skill he had mastered could utilize the chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>This sword technique was rather simple, with only a few sword strike moves. However, the power contained within each move had already far surpassed the power of other sword skills at the same level anywhere in the universe...</p>

  <p>However, Tianming was simply proving too strong...</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was unaware of the matter that Chiyou had become a Holy Being, the seven inheritances from the Lord of Weapons, or the mission that Tianming carried upon his shoulders!</p>

  <p>He only knew that he needed to think of a way to defeat Tianming.</p>

  <p>"How tragic! Being constantly suppressed by Tianming, there's no chance for Luo Zheng to win any advantage at all."</p>

  <p>"I can tell that he really wants to win..."</p>

  <p>"Tianming's strength is much more powerful than Nathan's!"</p>

  <p>"Buzz, buzz, buzz..."</p>

  <p>This time, Luo Zheng didn't use his sword...</p>

  <p>The Chaotic Gods-intimidating Strike's invincibly sharp Mu Ning was the most powerful weapon at his disposal.</p>

  <p>However, this Mu Ning wasn't fully consummated, and his sword intent hadn't manifested at its top level either.</p>

  <p>Using the Soaring Snake Sword in his hand, Tianming split the Chaotic Gods-intimidating Strike as if he were flaying the skin off it.</p>

  <p>However, if one were to observe carefully, they would have seen that Tianming slashing Zheng's strike had been very coincidental...</p>

  <p>He was slashing towards the right side of the sword light.</p>

  <p>Zheng's sword move had been executed by taking advantage of the Metal Law that supported the use of chaotic energy. Although the Metal Law and the energy had fused together, they were still slightly incongruent, revealing a flaw in them.</p>

  <p>If Tianming's sword strike should cut into that flaw, he would be able to easily slice it apart!</p>

  <p>But if Luo Zheng could activate 36 lotus petals and step into the Emotion Closing Godly Way, then he would be able to fully eliminate this flaw.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Luo Zheng had not yet reached the Emotion Closing Godly Way nor become a Godly Genius.</p>

  <p>As Zheng's eyes flashed, a small amount of starlight appeared in his hand.</p>

  <p>Those stars were colorful, and they sparkled like flawless gems...</p>

  <p>"The Stellar Body!</p>

  <p>Multiple Stars Brilliance!"</p>

  <p>The Multiple Stars Brilliance was the most powerful strike of the Stellar Body.</p>

  <p>The spreading starlight was like a rapidly growing mushroom, enveloping the entire Heaven Earth Board.</p>

  <p>Under the bright brilliance, the whole board quickly collapsed and disappeared.</p>

  <p>When the starlight finally dimmed, Tianming once again appeared not far away. He was standing on top of a stone, holding onto his sword as a smile appeared on his imposing face.</p>

  <p>That smile was very friendly, as he decided that he would now go all out during the battle.</p>

  <p>"Alas..."</p>

  <p>Even Zheng's sword silently sighed.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng has been completely outmatched, and I have done my best." The sword had been nourished with Zheng's chaotic energy, so it had tried its best to support Luo Zheng during the battle.</p>

  <p>However, Tianming was ridiculously strong, and the sword was helpless and could do nothing about that.</p>

  <p>Tianming flashed to a point far away, giving Luo Zheng a chance to think about that. Luo Zheng was afforded a brief measure of time to figure out the last way to deal with Tianming.</p>

  <p>This time, Luo Zheng had made full preparations before entering the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had already made his best use of the Thunderbolt Annihilation and Eight Smoky Melodies, which were among three cultivation methods Gus had recommended. But at the moment, they would be utterly useless if Luo Zheng made use of them in an attempt to resist Tianming.</p>

  <p>He had never before used the Enemy Repelling Arts because it was used to sever the causality laws and therefore break every method which opposed him. In the future, should he completely master it, he would definitely become a formidable powerhouse in the universe and be able to cut off the Heavenly Destiny that the Supreme Lord carried...</p>

  <p>However, he hadn't had a chance to make use of it before, and he couldn't use it to cut down the heavens' rules in the Hall of Causality.</p>

  <p>At this stage, he was faced with nothing but Godly Geniuses. The knowledge they had acquired was extremely remarkable, and they had also mastered the power of the Godly Way. Now the Enemy Repelling Arts had become a thing of little value, for the time being.</p>

  <p>Even the Dark Star Devouring of the Stellar Body was incapable of swallowing Tianming as he moved at an incomparable speed.</p>

  <p>Facing Tianming, Luo Zheng could therefore only rely on his sword!</p>

  <p>It seemed to be the only way to reach a break through!</p>

  <p>The gleam in Zheng's eyes suddenly disappeared...</p>

  <p>In that instant, he looked extremely cold and utterly unmoved.</p>

  <p>"Again!"</p>

  <p>He still tried to employ the Chaotic Gods-intimidating Strike one more time...</p>

  <p>Zheng's sword spirit also felt quite helpless at this moment.</p>

  <p>It could only try its best to help Luo Zheng fuse the Metal Law and the chaotic energy more perfectly.</p>

  <p>But there was still a flaw!</p>

  <p>Until Luo Zheng managed to step into the Godly Way, there would be no way to make this fatal flaw disappear.</p>

  <p>"Swish!</p>

  <p>Buzz..."</p>

  <p>With a flash of golden light, Tianming brandished his sword like a skilled butcher, who easily shaved a cow's bones off the meat.</p>

  <p>The two streaks of light were easily diced apart by his sword.</p>

  <p>Tianming seemed to do it effortlessly, but for Luo Zheng, it was not easy to make any move.</p>

  <p>Although his chaotic energy was incomparably dense, it was still limited.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had consistently employed the Chaotic Gods-intimidating Strike with all his might, and had already used up 60 or 70 percent of the chaotic energy in his chaotic sea!</p>

  <p>The chaotic sea in his body had shrunk away substantially. At the same time, the dense roots of the World Tree were becoming exposed...</p>

  <p>'How can I eliminate this flaw?' Luo Zheng lifted his sword and floated in the air. It might be just as Tianming had said that Luo Zheng could match up to him only after Luo Zheng completely stepped into the Emotion Closing Godly Way!</p>

  <p>At this moment, Tianming jumped up from the stone and dashed towards Luo Zheng with his feet on the light.</p>

  <p>In only an instant, that brilliant sword of silver light slashed down on Zheng's head...</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng held his sword horizontally, and instantly a beam of golden light emanated from the sword, completely enveloping Luo Zheng in its protection!</p>

  <p>"Clang!"</p>

  <p>The two swords collided, and a sound rang out, crisp and clear as a bell.</p>

  <p>Even though he had blocked Tianming's attack, a layer of waves had spread out from Tianming's blade to cover Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>"Pah, pah, pah!"</p>

  <p>The protective golden light released by Zheng's sword was extremely tough, but when it came into contact with those waves, it was forcibly dispersed!</p>

  <p>"Puff, puff..."</p>

  <p>Streaks of blood-red waves rippled in a bloody tide on Zheng's muscular chest.</p>

  <p>Although none of his bones were broken, Luo Zheng looked even more ragged and torn up. His entire body was now covered in blood!</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng did not stop or yield at all!</p>

  <p>He had fortitude, and he could withstand this kind of injury.</p>

  <p>Tianming was already close to him, and at the very least, he wouldn't be at a great disadvantage when it came to sword moves!</p>

  <p>"Ding, ding, ding, ding..."</p>

  <p>However, from now on, a large number of bloody gashes appeared on Zheng's body every time he fended off Tianming's attacks. It was a shocking sight to behold, and not a single part of Zheng's body was left unscathed.</p>

  <p>"It can be over now..."</p>

  <p>There was not a single trace of mercy in Tianming's eyes. However, if Luo Zheng chose to admit defeat, he would, of course, stop attacking him.</p>

  <p>However, if Tianming held back his strength from his attacks, it would be the greatest insult to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Tianming had completely gained the upper hand. As long as he continued dominating with his full strength, Luo Zheng would definitely be defeated, should the situation continue.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>"Activate all the dragon scales!"</p>

  <p>A majestic force was suddenly released from Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>After resisting Zheng's returning sword strike, Tianming scampered backward for ten thousand feet. The force behind that strike was simply too great, so he had no choice but to retreat to avoid getting obliterated by it.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the power of dragon scales did not prove that effective in facing Tianming.</p>

  <p>Tianming could travel through the distance of ten thousand feet in an instant, and he thought it was already pointless for Luo Zheng to resist.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng, who had been in the state of Emotion Closing, was like a lifeless puppet. He used his simplest thoughts to search for the method of defeating Tianming!</p>

  <p>Even though he might not defeat Tianming, he definitely wouldn't give up.</p>

  <p>However, just as Tianming was about to move forward for the killing stroke, Luo Zheng, who was floating in midair motionlessly, suddenly emitted a strangely reinforced will...</p>

  <p>At this moment, a tiny glowing crystal had appeared like a shining star above the center of Zheng's internal world!</p>
