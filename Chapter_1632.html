<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The longbow had been obtained from the four divine kingdoms and could be considered to be a semi-divine weapon. Luo Zheng did not expect it to cause any problems for Malachi.</p>

  <p>As he shot the three arrows— sword in one hand, his figure like a shuttle— he rapidly approached Malachi.</p>

  <p>As Malachi pushed away the three arrows, he saw Luo Zheng heading straight for him, his expression as calm as ever.</p>

  <p>Truth be told, even though Malachi was an ace talent, he felt a bit uneasy realizing that his opponent was Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>As of now, most races were not wary about Luo Zheng killing the Supreme Lords. However, many large clans still sent out their world lords to surround the fairy palace. For the past five to six years, they had not let up for even a moment. Their target was not Luo Zheng, but the fairy palace itself.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was a strong adversary, for he had inherited the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>However, upon seeing the first-rank divine weapon in Zheng's hand, Malachi felt more at ease.</p>

  <p>'Is the fairy palace short of weapons?</p>

  <p>How can he fight me with a first-rank divine weapon?</p>

  <p>It seems as though the rumors about the inheritance of the fairy palace have been exaggerated a bit, ' Malachi thought to himself.</p>

  <p>Of course, he was not aware that the fairy palace did not have any ready-made weapons, but it did have some extremely rare materials.</p>

  <p>He only knew that by relying on the Saint Killing Spear, he would be in an invincible position.</p>

  <p>"Immature brat!"</p>

  <p>Seeing Luo Zheng advance toward him, Malachi swung the long spear.</p>

  <p>A blood-red light emanated from it. Like a dragon, it circled the air once before spreading out like a fan.</p>

  <p>"Twin Kill Intent!"</p>

  <p>Twin Kill Intent was the second skill of the Saint Killing Spear.</p>

  <p>The spear possessed a pure destructive power.</p>

  <p>A few supreme divine weapons on the Universe Spirit Tablet had distinct uses. Some weapons contained strange Laws of Causality and their killing techniques were different.</p>

  <p>In terms of pure destructive power and sharpness of the weapon, the Saint Killing Spear was certainly ranked among the top three weapons.</p>

  <p>Shoot!</p>

  <p>As the blood-red light beam unfurled in the air, Luo Zheng frowned. He was forced back dozens of feet.</p>

  <p>Spear in hand, a sneer surfaced on Malachi's face. "I did not expect the famous  Luo Zheng Luo to turn out to be such a coward. You retreat and escape when you fight others. Interesting!"</p>

  <p>Ever since the time the two of them had started fighting, Luo Zheng had been stepping back continuously. It looked as if he could not harm a hair on Malachi's head.</p>

  <p>"It's obvious what will happen! The Saint Killing Spear is the number one killing weapon of Demon Night."</p>

  <p>"With that weapon, even an ordinary martial artist will have the strength to fight an ace talent!"</p>

  <p>"Look! Malachi merely relies on the power of the Saint Killing Spear."</p>

  <p>Martial artists discussed the fight among themselves in low voices.</p>

  <p>The others who were in favor of Malachi overheard this. "What did you say?" one of them asked, smirking. "Malachi only relies on the power of the Saint Killing Spear? Then why don't you get the spear yourself?"</p>

  <p>Fights among martial artists were never fair.</p>

  <p>Someone stronger in every aspect was bound to exist in this world. His talent would be greater, his luck better, and the weapon in his hand much stronger.</p>

  <p>There was no point in discussing what was inevitable.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did not complain, even to himself. As Malachi wielded the Saint Killing Spear, he perceived the spear and Malachi as a whole. All he wondered about was how to defeat Malachi, who was using the spear as his weapon.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, who floated in the air, raised the long sword in his hand. His hand traced the blade of the long sword and moved to the tip.</p>

  <p>Eventually, his two fingers came to a halt at the tip of the Thunder Wind Divine Sword. He caught hold of it, pointing the hilt toward Malachi.</p>

  <p>It was a strange thing to do.</p>

  <p>Janet, Coleman, and Hailey were all puzzled to see it.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng blinked, his eyes shining.</p>

  <p>Previously in the Corridor of Emperor, Luo Zheng had gained a new understanding of the Gods-intimidating Strike.</p>

  <p>Sword Chen had created many sword techniques.</p>

  <p>On the peak of the Killing Sword Mountain, Luo Zheng once fought him with a million sword moves.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, that had only been an exchange of sorts, not a competition.</p>

  <p>What played were sword moves, but what sparred were the understanding of sword techniques from both sides.</p>

  <p>It had been like a game of chess, but with swords as the chess pieces, the two had pondered over every move before straining their nerves to test the other's true strength.</p>

  <p>Gods-intimidating Strike was not limited to one strike. On the contrary, it could be transformed into any sword move. Its owner could change it into various forms.</p>

  <p>At any crucial juncture, the key to Gods-intimidating Strike was to use the most appropriate sword move and launch an intimidating attack.</p>

  <p>In order to do this, a martial artist had to play the role of the chess player.</p>

  <p>Not only did he have to be very familiar with himself and his actions, he also had to predict the opponent's every move.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng pointed the hilt of his sword at Malachi, foreseeing his opponent's next step.</p>

  <p>Malachi looked indifferently at Luo Zheng. "Don't bother playing any cheap tricks!"</p>

  <p>He thrust the Saint Killing Spear at Luo Zheng once again. With a Shadowy Spin, over ten giant spear shadows shot out, rushing at Luo Zheng straightaway.</p>

  <p>At the moment, Luo Zheng stood rooted to the same spot, still turning the tip of Thunder Wind Divine Sword in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Why is he not dodging the shadows?"</p>

  <p>"If he doesn't step out of the way, I'm afraid he'll be killed by those spear shadows!"</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng! Don't just stand there! Do something!"</p>

  <p>When the flying spear shadows were less than ten feet away from Luo Zheng, his eyes opened at once. A hint of a smile lingered on his face, but once that smile faded away, any speck of emotion disappeared from his eyes.</p>

  <p>He entered an exceedingly wondrous state with his emotions closed off.</p>

  <p>In this state, nothing persisted in his mind. There was neither joy, nor fear.</p>

  <p>With a flick of his finger, the long sword swung through the air in another direction. Holding the long sword in his hand, Luo Zheng charged at the spear shadows.</p>

  <p>The long sword swiveled as he raised the sword.</p>

  <p>Raising sword was a basic sword technique, but now Luo Zheng had a newer understanding of this most ordinary method.</p>

  <p>With the sword raising, he could block any attack.</p>

  <p>Clang!</p>

  <p>The first giant spear shadow pierced through the air. The onlookers saw the long sword in Zheng's hand shake slightly. The spear shadow deviated from its target, flying in a different direction altogether.</p>

  <p>Clang!</p>

  <p>The second giant spear shadow underwent the same treatment.</p>

  <p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p>

  <p>The spear shadows shot out one by one and Luo Zheng felt as if there existed an invisible force field in front of him. The giant spear shadows approaching him were all pushed away by this invisible force. The spectators had their eyes wide open in disbelief.</p>

  <p>To perform this action, Luo Zheng had relied on a single ordinary defensive sword move— raise sword.</p>

  <p>The long sword was not placed on the top of the spear. Rather, it was placed along the spear shaft. This was the spear's weakness, or rather its tender spot.</p>

  <p>In general, the Thunder Wind Divine Sword would have been unable to confront the giant spear shadows head on. However, under these circumstances, Zheng's grasp was exceptionally accurate, to the point that it made one's hair stand on end.</p>

  <p>"Shadowy Spin!"</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Malachi felt panic rise in his heart.</p>

  <p>The spear shadows raced in the air, but they could not stop Luo Zheng in the slightest.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng defended himself very well. Just how was he doing it?</p>

  <p>He did not give Malachi much time to think. The essence of the Gods-intimidating Strike was everywhere, oppressing his opponent, not giving him a break.</p>

  <p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p>

  <p>Pushing away the gigantic spear shadows, Luo Zheng approached Malachi.</p>

  <p>"Malachi, hell awaits you!"</p>

  <p>The Saint Killing Spear still exuded a blood-red light.</p>

  <p>"Twin Kill Intent!"</p>

  <p>Clang!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng raised the Thunder Wind Divine Sword once more. This time, he placed the sword on the upper half of the shaft of the Saint Killing Spear.</p>

  <p>The previously unrivalled Twin Killing Intent was broken off by Zheng's sword before it could even be unleashed.</p>

  <p>As an ace talent, Malachi's response time was fast.</p>

  <p>The moment his spear was blocked by Luo Zheng, he faltered in his steps, retreating at once.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the long spear wedged beneath his armpit shrank. As he stepped back, the spear spun round in a circle. Just as it was pulled back, it charged at Luo Zheng from a different direction.</p>

  <p>"Cycle Stab!"</p>

  <p>Malachi became more anxious. He did not have time to activate the techniques of the Saint Killing Spear and instead employed his usual spear technique.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng had anticipated this. He knew Malachi would make this move, so he moved his body half a foot to the left in advance.</p>

  <p>Malachi's shot failed and slid past Zheng's shoulder.</p>

  <p>Fights between martial artists were as unpredictable as a game of chess.</p>

  <p>One wrong move could end in death.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was a person with foresight. After he tricked Malachi into showing his weakness, he followed his opponent like a shadow. He would not give his rival the slightest chance to get back in the game!</p>
