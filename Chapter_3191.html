<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>If it were an ordinary metal, it would have been burnt to a crisp by the green light.</p>

  <p>But these two weapons were forged by Shade Stones, which made them more durable than ordinary Other Shore Treasures.</p>

  <p>They remained unscathed despite being exposed to the green light.</p>

  <p>The Nine Edges Weapon Refining Array was not stable when it had just been activated. With the passing of an hour, the green light gradually stabilized. The surface of the hammer looked as though it were coated with a layer of sugar, and the blade of the Shade Phoenix Sword also seemed different.</p>

  <p>"Amazing. The speed is actually fast now," Zheng said as he examined both weapons.</p>

  <p>Cailen withdrew from the position he was in charge of and walked up to stand beside Zheng. "What have been melted now are just impurities in the weapons. We still need to remove the rest of the impurities one by one. This process is very complicated and slow, and it takes at least three days. Are you going to wait here all the time?"</p>

  <p>If one wanted to forge weapons with Shade Stone, the method involved adding other materials. The removal of these materials required the melting process.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I don't mind waiting here." Zheng nodded, still staring at the two weapons, and his hands clasped behind his back.</p>

  <p>It was not that he didn't trust the Su Clan. He wanted to stay and supervise the process because the Shade Stone liquid was of great importance to him.</p>

  <p>After four hours, Eira was escorted there.</p>

  <p>Next to the Nine Edges Weapon Refining Array, there was an array in intense blood-red color. This scene reminded Zheng of what he saw at Blue Cloud City.</p>

  <p>This time, Eira was much more spirited than before. After she took the Blood Upgrading Pill, the concentration of her blood increased substantially. Gant held her hand and escorted her into the blood array, offering comfort.</p>

  <p>As she stood inside, wisps of blood power of the Ore Shadow race emanated from her body and entered the two weapons.</p>

  <p>Sizz, sizz...</p>

  <p>The Shade Phoenix Sword quickly reacted, and a thin silver thread was extracted from it, which manifested itself into a small silver metal ball.</p>

  <p>"This is the Sword Hard Steel, which is a very precious material. I melted it into the Shade Stone back then. I never thought I would have to extract it out one day," Cailen said as he sighed in disappointment.</p>

  <p>The Shade Phoenix Sword was his creation. His heart resisted at the thought of having to melt it with the same hands that forged it. But since that was what Zheng wanted, he had no other choice but to go along with it.</p>

  <p>Sizz...</p>

  <p>Sometime after, the Shade Phoenix Sword let out a golden thread, it was the Golden Silkworm Gold, which held high value.</p>

  <p>Sizz, sizz...</p>

  <p>As the process continued, various materials were extracted from the Shade Phoenix Sword, which eventually turned into tiny balls and floated around Cailen.</p>

  <p>Just then, the hammer beside the sword also started showing signs of disintegration.</p>

  <p>Sizzle...</p>

  <p>Flashy strings cloaked with a shining black light drew out of the weapon and gathered in one place. They all watched as the threads turned into black metal liquid and fell in the form of droplets. The liquid had a foul smell that forced everyone to cover their noses.</p>

  <p>For some reason, the sight of this liquid made Cailen, Ruben, and the others exchange glances in excitement.</p>

  <p>"Brother! It is Diabolic Steel!"</p>

  <p>"This small hammer was forged with Diabolic Steel! It might be a weapon that came from the Heaven Orc race! No wonder it's a hammer!"</p>

  <p>"It was such a big waste for the Heaven Orc race to use the Diabolic Steel and the Shade Stone to forge such a low-quality Other Shore Token!"</p>

  <p>The Heaven Orc race resided underground. Their vision had degraded due to staying away from the light for a long time. In contrast to their eyes, their bodies were quite powerful, and they were a large race that ruled the underground.</p>

  <p>As a result of being well acquainted with the underground, they were skilled diggers. The unlimited access to resources buried deep made them obtain rare materials others could not get. However, they were incompatible with the Ear Mouse race; the two of them had been fighting for countless years.</p>

  <p>The Diabolic Steel was like a treasure for these weapon refiners since it was usually exclusive to the Heaven Orc race. It wasn't even prevalent in the market. Even if it were sold in one, it would cost an arm and a leg to obtain it.</p>

  <p>For a hammer of that size, surely significant amounts of Diabolic Steel must have been used to forge it.</p>

  <p>As the black droplets continued to fall and collect around Cailen, he couldn't help but look at Zheng with longing eyes.</p>

  <p>The Su Clan didn't ask Zheng for payment. But the cost of activating the Nine Edges Weapon Refining Array once was great. Usually, it was taken for granted that the Su Clan would keep the materials that were extracted from the two supreme treasures.</p>

  <p>However, this time, they discovered the hammer was forged with such a rare material that had great value. Naturally, Cailen felt wrong to keep them all to himself.</p>

  <p>Even so, Zheng didn't plan on taking any of these materials. Moreover, he was willing to pay many divine crystals for their service.</p>

  <p>He noticed Cailen looking at him with anticipation, which made Zheng smile warmly. "I don't know anything about weapon refining. No matter how precious these materials are, they are of no use to me. Feel free to keep as many as you want. You'll make better use of them anyway."</p>

  <p>"Haha, Zheng, you are a generous man. Thank you, I'll take them all!" Cailen collected every material while smiling ear to ear.</p>

  <p>Several hours later, the process of securing all materials from the weapons was finished. The Shade Phoenix Sword and the hammer that were floating in the air were pitted, but they still maintained their original shape. After all, they were made of Shade Stones. Although the other materials melted away, the Shade Stones did not change at all.</p>

  <p>A day later, the blade of the Shade Phoenix Sword split apart from the body, and the head of the hammer was half broken.</p>

  <p>Two days after, both weapons were reduced to a pile of mud. They appeared to be soft, but they were still hard.</p>

  <p>This time, they didn't overexert Eira to speed up the process. She would work about five hours a day, and then she'd leave with Gant.</p>

  <p>On the third day, she came early to resume contributing her blood power to melt the weapons.</p>

  <p>With the passing of a few hours, the piles of mud floating in the green light column softened up and began merging with one another.</p>

  <p>"Clap!"</p>

  <p>At this gesture of Cailen, a small bottle appeared and stationed itself in front of him. He stared at the liquid and commanded it firmly, "Come inside!"</p>

  <p>Grmmm...</p>

  <p>Slowly, the mass of Shade Stone liquid gathered into the small bottle.</p>

  <p>Cailen grabbed the bottle in his hands and corked it before tossing it to Zheng.</p>

  <p>Satisfied with the result, Zheng cupped his hands together and bowed humbly towards Cailen. "Thank you for helping me, Master Cailen."</p>

  <p>As he straightened himself up, he took out a space ring and placed it in Cailen's hand. "The Nine Edges Weapon Refining Array is the most powerful weapon refining array in the Oneness Sky Palace. I have heard from Gant that it would cost a lot to use it once. Here are twenty million divine crystals. Although they might not be enough to cover the cost, I hope you can accept it."</p>

  <p>"Twenty million divine crystals..."</p>

  <p>The Su Clan possessed high reserves of divine crystals. Even so, seeing how effortlessly Zheng took out so many at once stunned Cailen.</p>

  <p>Overwhelmed by the amount, Cailen immediately refused, "You're Gant's friend, and you saved his life once. There is a lot I owe you. How can I take the divine crystals for such a small favor?"</p>

  <p>Persistent, Zheng kept on insisting Cailen accept them, and he would repeatedly refuse. This went on for a while before Cailen spoke, "Oh, right!</p>

  <p>The Ripple Pavilion rally will take place soon. We Su Clan can't take these twenty million divine crystals, but there is something else you can do in return. Zheng, how would you feel about assisting us in the battle ring?"</p>

  <p>"Battle ring?" Zheng asked, suddenly baffled by such a request.</p>

  <p>"Yes. The Ripple Pavilion rally is a big day for the clans around the Clear Lake. At that time, the younger generation will go into the battle ring to compete. Since you are an elite disciple of the Oneness Palace, you must be quite strong. It would really help us to win." Cailen appealed to Zheng with hopeful eyes.</p>

  <p>Zheng only came to Clear Lake to obtain the Shade Stone liquid, and he had no interest in any battle ring competition. In fact, he didn't mind paying a huge amount of divine crystals. He was more inclined towards covering the costs and going about his day.</p>

  <p>Eavesdropping on their conversation, Gant suddenly joined in and approached Zheng with long strides. "Yes, Flag Master! You should join us!</p>

  <p>It'll be a lot of fun with you in the Ripple Pavilion rally! After all, it is the biggest festival here at Clear Lake. You can't miss it."</p>

  <p>With their unwavering insistence, Zheng waved his hands in the air as a sign of surrender and accepted their invitation.</p>

  <p>He was excited about the Shade Stone liquid and wanted to test it as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>Upon returning to the backyard of the Su Clan, he plopped to the ground with his legs crossed and set up an enchanted barrier. Then, he took off his shirt.</p>

  <p>Quickly, he uncorked the bottle. At this action, wisps of Shade Stone liquid emanated from the head of the container.</p>

  <p>The size of each Shade Stone was fixed, so the amount of the Shade Stone liquid was naturally twice as much as what he had obtained last time.</p>
