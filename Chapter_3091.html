<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Standing in a corner of the Dragon City was a young man in a blue robe. As he leaned against the wall, he breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>Not only him, there were also several people in other concealed places feeling relieved.</p>

  <p>As Zheng and Milo fought, they watched nervously and with full attention.</p>

  <p>If Milo had the slightest intention of killing Zheng, they would stop him from doing so.</p>

  <p>Milo was strong, even if his cultivation base was not high. His Flow Strike, however, was at its peak. If he wanted to, he could easily end Zheng's life.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Milo merely aimed for Zheng's sword, broke it in half, and left.</p>

  <p>"Milo is a lunatic, but it's a good thing he knows when to stop," the man in blue remarked before he hid himself again.</p>

  <p>The fight between Zheng and Milo got so heated that they destroyed a building in the Dragon City. Despite it, no Dragon City guard appeared. The Dragon City was very powerful in the Bloom Divine Province, but it still served as a screening place for the Oneness Sky Palace. The guards knew they couldn't afford to offend those from the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>In the middle of the night, the shimmering white stars turned into rain of swords and dropped towards the ground.</p>

  <p>Zheng raised his head to look at the unattainable Oneness Mountain.</p>

  <p>His Snow Sword might be broken, but he was still smart enough to have reached an assessment of the situation.</p>

  <p>Since he had set foot in the Source World, he first went to the Sword Light Palace, and then came to the Dragon City. He had seldom met any peers who were on par with him.</p>

  <p>No one interested him the same way Dorothy did.</p>

  <p>Now he realized it wasn't because the people in the Source World weren't as talented as him. His position was too low for him to meet true geniuses.</p>

  <p>"Flow Sword Sect?"</p>

  <p>Milo's swordsmanship was so peculiar. He was able to use anything as a sword.</p>

  <p>He clenched a cloud of air, yet he was able to use it as a weapon no less powerful than Zheng's Six Annihilation Strike.</p>

  <p>Zheng had tried more than a hundred times to find a way to break Milo's sword strike in his mind. But no matter what he did, he wasn't able to do so.</p>

  <p>The only method he knew would work was if he could use the Imperial Sword Seal to activate the Soaring Snake Sword, but doing that would risk exposing his identity.</p>

  <p>"Flag Master, are you still thinking about what happened earlier?" Gant asked with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Milo's younger than you, but remember that he is already in the third stage of the Other Shore Realm. It's not a surprise that you lost out to him though you are both capable of Instant Enlightenment," said Gant.</p>

  <p>Zheng shook his head and said, "The problem is not in the differences between our cultivation levels."</p>

  <p>There was not much difference between the third stage and the first stage of the Other Shore Realm. Besides, none of them used their Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>They just came from very different backgrounds. And that was all it took for them to have such varying performances in the battlefield.</p>

  <p>When Zheng was still struggling in the divine land, Milo had already been a member of the Oneness Sky Palace. He had been standing high in the Flow Sword Sect's favor, and had been practicing hard in the Flow Tower.</p>

  <p>At that time, Zheng was merely running around the divine land. He didn't even have an understanding on the Truth of Godly Way or the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>"You just have varying cultivation levels. When you reach his level, I'm sure you can defeat him." Gant patted Zheng's shoulder reassuringly.</p>

  <p>"Hopefully," Zheng said with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Oh, by the way, it's time for you to consider becoming an Alliance Chief," remarked Gant.</p>

  <p>In the Dragon City, one could only become a Oneness Guard, the ultimate goal for all Flag Masters, by first becoming an Alliance Chief.</p>

  <p>"Do I have to go to the Dragon City to apply for it?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Gant nodded. "Yes, you'd need to go to the old man at the entrance of the Dragon City. To become an Alliance Chief, you need to have a certain number of followers, but it shouldn't be long before you reach it. However, you are still short of merit points."</p>

  <p>"Merit points? What can I do to earn them?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Kill the nonhuman creatures!" Gant's eyes glimmered menacingly.</p>

  <p>The various races had been at war since the birth of the Source World.</p>

  <p>They were always in conflict with each other.</p>

  <p>The Oneness Guards of the Oneness Sky Palace shouldered the responsibility of killing the nonhuman creatures and guarding the territory of the human race.</p>

  <p>Zheng had long known that he could take tasks from the Dragon City and train in the outside. However, he had only been here for a short period of time, so he had not thought about this before.</p>

  <p>But now it seemed that he needed merit points so he could first become an Alliance Chief.</p>

  <p>Through Gant, Zheng had figured out how to do so.</p>

  <p>In the Bloom Divine Province where the Oneness Sky Palace was located, many powerful masters resided. No race dared to offend them.</p>

  <p>The Oneness Sky Palace was in control of thirteen provinces. Six of those were at war, including the Mountain Viewing Province. The Oneness Sky Palace had sent many Oneness Guards to control it, yet there were always counterattacks from other races.</p>

  <p>Thus, the Dragon City issued many tasks that required the warriors to go to the Mountain Viewing Province to kill the nonhuman creatures.</p>

  <p>Zheng accepted Gant's suggestion. He also made sure Dorothy knew of his plan to go to the Mountain Viewing Province.</p>

  <p>Dorothy was, unsurprisingly, worried. "That place is in unrest. The Oneness Sky Palace might even move out of this province. Isn't it too dangerous for you to go there?"</p>

  <p>"The Oneness Sky Palace might abandon the province? Why? Are we unable to defeat the nonhuman creatures?" Zheng inquired.</p>

  <p>He met a similar story in the Sword Light Palace, which had been destroyed by the powerful nonhuman creatures.</p>

  <p>However, Oneness Sky Palace was one of the strongest forces of the human race. They had plenty of mighty warriors. Zheng couldn't comprehend why they were on the verge of giving up.</p>

  <p>Dorothy chuckled and shook her head. "You don't know much about the Source World," she said. "The enemy in the Mountain Viewing Province is the Sun Crow race. The most powerful among them is Emperor Charm. He is as powerful as Eastern Emperor Taiyi."</p>

  <p>"Really? He is as powerful as Eastern Emperor Taiyi?" Zheng raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>In Zheng's eyes, Eastern Emperor Taiyi was on the same level as his grandfather, Chiyou. He wondered how a master from the Sun Crow race could possess that much power.</p>

  <p>"Think carefully, please. The tasks from the Dragon City may not be as difficult as the Oneness Guards', but you can never be too sure."</p>

  <p>In his mind, Zheng knew Dorothy was right. But his mind was set and no amount of convincing would change it.</p>

  <p>From the moment he entered the Dragon City, Zheng had made up his mind that he wouldn't plead with Athemar or Winchell. So he didn't bother to ask them to let him join the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>Zheng had relied on himself and would continue to do so. He was strong enough to move forward on his own and make it in the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry. I have considered this thoroughly," Zheng reassured Dorothy.</p>

  <p>But this did not ease Dorothy. She knew that Zheng was stubborn in his own ways. He was definitely going to do it, and she would not be able to stop him.</p>

  <p>Zheng met with his followers and discussed the arrangements with them.</p>

  <p>Beldene and Elgin would take care of everything while Zheng was away, and if there was any trouble, Monica would help them.</p>

  <p>The Alliance Chiefs were already intimidated by Zheng. He could leave the Dragon City and they wouldn't give Zheng's people a hard time.</p>

  <p>Then Zheng and Gant went to the Dragon Shadow Pavilion of the Dragon City, where the tasks from the Dragon City were delegated.</p>

  <p>Initially, Zheng wanted to go to the Mountain Viewing Province alone, but Gant had insisted on coming along. Zheng had no choice but to let him.</p>
