  <p>
</p>

  <p>Standing in a corner of the Dragon City was a young man in a blue robe. As he leaned against the wall, he breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>Not only him, there were also several people in other concealed places feeling relieved.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng and Milo fought, they watched nervously and with full attention.</p>

  <p>If Milo had the slightest intention of killing Luo Zheng, they would stop him from doing so.</p>

  <p>Milo was strong, even if his cultivation base was not high. His Flow Strike, however, was at its peak. If he wanted to, he could easily end Luo Zheng's life.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Milo merely aimed for Luo Zheng's sword, broke it in half, and left.</p>

  <p>"Milo is a lunatic, but it's a good thing he knows when to stop," the man in blue remarked before he hid himself again.</p>

  <p>The fight between Luo Zheng and Milo got so heated that they destroyed a building in the Dragon City. Despite it, no Dragon City guard appeared. The Dragon City was very powerful in the Bloom Divine Province, but it still served as a screening place for the Taiyi Heaven Palace. The guards knew they couldn't afford to offend those from the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>In the middle of the night, the shimmering white stars turned into rain of swords and dropped towards the ground.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng raised his head to look at the unattainable Taiyi Mountain.</p>

  <p>His Snow Sword might be broken, but he was still smart enough to have reached an assessment of the situation.</p>

  <p>Since he had set foot in the Source World, he first went to the Sword Light Palace, and then came to the Dragon City. He had seldom met any peers who were on par with him.</p>

  <p>No one interested him the same way Ling Shuang did.</p>

  <p>Now he realized it wasn't because the people in the Source World weren't as talented as him. His position was too low for him to meet true geniuses.</p>

  <p>"Heart Flow Sect?"</p>

  <p>Milo's swordsmanship was so peculiar. He was able to use anything as a sword.</p>

  <p>He clenched a cloud of air, yet he was able to use it as a weapon no less powerful than Luo Zheng's Six Annihilation Strike.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had tried more than a hundred times to find a way to break Milo's sword strike in his mind. But no matter what he did, he wasn't able to do so.</p>

  <p>The only method he knew would work was if he could use the Imperial Sword Seal to activate the Soaring Snake Sword, but doing that would risk exposing his identity.</p>

  <p>"Flag Master, are you still thinking about what happened earlier?" Gant asked with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Milo's younger than you, but remember that he is already in the third stage of the Other Shore Realm. It's not a surprise that you lost out to him though you are both capable of Instant Enlightenment," said Gant.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shook his head and said, "The problem is not in the differences between our cultivation levels."</p>

  <p>There was not much difference between the third stage and the first stage of the Other Shore Realm. Besides, none of them used their Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>They just came from very different backgrounds. And that was all it took for them to have such varying performances in the battlefield.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng was still struggling in the divine land, Milo had already been a member of the Taiyi Heaven Palace. He had been standing high in the Heart Flow Sect's favor, and had been practicing hard in the Flow Tower.</p>

  <p>At that time, Luo Zheng was merely running around the divine land. He didn't even have an understanding on the Truth of Divine Dao or the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>"You just have varying cultivation levels. When you reach his level, I'm sure you can defeat him." Gant patted Luo Zheng's shoulder reassuringly.</p>

  <p>"Hopefully," Luo Zheng said with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Oh, by the way, it's time for you to consider becoming an Alliance Chief," remarked Gant.</p>

  <p>In the Dragon City, one could only become a Taiyi Guard, the ultimate goal for all Flag Masters, by first becoming an Alliance Chief.</p>

  <p>"Do I have to go to the Dragon City to apply for it?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Gant nodded. "Yes, you'd need to go to the old man at the entrance of the Dragon City. To become an Alliance Chief, you need to have a certain number of followers, but it shouldn't be long before you reach it. However, you are still short of merit points."</p>

  <p>"Merit points? What can I do to earn them?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Kill the nonhuman creatures!" Gant's eyes glimmered menacingly.</p>

  <p>The various races had been at war since the birth of the Source World.</p>

  <p>They were always in conflict with each other.</p>

  <p>The Taiyi Guards of the Taiyi Heaven Palace shouldered the responsibility of killing the nonhuman creatures and guarding the territory of the human race.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had long known that he could take tasks from the Dragon City and train in the outside. However, he had only been here for a short period of time, so he had not thought about this before.</p>

  <p>But now it seemed that he needed merit points so he could first become an Alliance Chief.</p>

  <p>Through Gant, Luo Zheng had figured out how to do so.</p>

  <p>In the Bloom Divine Province where the Taiyi Heaven Palace was located, many powerful masters resided. No race dared to offend them.</p>

  <p>The Taiyi Heaven Palace was in control of thirteen provinces. Six of those were at war, including the Mountain Viewing Province. The Taiyi Heaven Palace had sent many Taiyi Guards to control it, yet there were always counterattacks from other races.</p>

  <p>Thus, the Dragon City issued many tasks that required the warriors to go to the Mountain Viewing Province to kill the nonhuman creatures.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng accepted Gant's suggestion. He also made sure Ling Shuang knew of his plan to go to the Mountain Viewing Province.</p>

  <p>Ling Shuang was, unsurprisingly, worried. "That place is in unrest. The Taiyi Heaven Palace might even move out of this province. Isn't it too dangerous for you to go there?"</p>

  <p>"The Taiyi Heaven Palace might abandon the province? Why? Are we unable to defeat the nonhuman creatures?" Luo Zheng inquired.</p>

  <p>He met a similar story in the Sword Light Palace, which had been destroyed by the powerful nonhuman creatures.</p>

  <p>However, Taiyi Heaven Palace was one of the strongest forces of the human race. They had plenty of mighty warriors. Luo Zheng couldn't comprehend why they were on the verge of giving up.</p>

  <p>Ling Shuang chuckled and shook her head. "You don't know much about the Source World," she said. "The enemy in the Mountain Viewing Province is the Jin Wu. The most powerful among them is Emperor Di Jun. He is as powerful as Eastern Emperor Taiyi."</p>

  <p>"Really? He is as powerful as Eastern Emperor Taiyi?" Luo Zheng raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>In Luo Zheng's eyes, Eastern Emperor Taiyi was on the same level as his grandfather, Chiyou. He wondered how a master from the Jin Wu could possess that much power.</p>

  <p>"Think carefully, please. The tasks from the Dragon City may not be as difficult as the Taiyi Guards', but you can never be too sure."</p>

  <p>In his mind, Luo Zheng knew Ling Shuang was right. But his mind was set and no amount of convincing would change it.</p>

  <p>From the moment he entered the Dragon City, Luo Zheng had made up his mind that he wouldn't plead with Qiu Yinhe or Winchell. So he didn't bother to ask them to let him join the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had relied on himself and would continue to do so. He was strong enough to move forward on his own and make it in the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry. I have considered this thoroughly," Luo Zheng reassured Ling Shuang.</p>

  <p>But this did not ease Ling Shuang. She knew that Luo Zheng was stubborn in his own ways. He was definitely going to do it, and she would not be able to stop him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng met with his followers and discussed the arrangements with them.</p>

  <p>Beldene and Elgin would take care of everything while Luo Zheng was away, and if there was any trouble, Monica would help them.</p>

  <p>The Alliance Chiefs were already intimidated by Luo Zheng. He could leave the Dragon City and they wouldn't give Luo Zheng's people a hard time.</p>

  <p>Then Luo Zheng and Gant went to the Dragon Shadow Pavilion of the Dragon City, where the tasks from the Dragon City were delegated.</p>

  <p>Initially, Luo Zheng wanted to go to the Mountain Viewing Province alone, but Gant had insisted on coming along. Luo Zheng had no choice but to let him.</p>
