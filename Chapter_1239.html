  <p>
</p>

  <p>"What? Kill the guy who's shooting the arrows?" The two ogre Soul Sea Realm masters in the sky looked at Lamar, puzzled. They had thought that Lamar could defeat Lacey easily. But they hadn't expected Lamar to be faced with such a huge disadvantage.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Another ray of black light shot out from behind Lacey. The black arrow brushed past Lamar's face, leaving a thumb-sized wound in his rough face.</p>

  <p>If this arrow had been two or three inches to the side, it would have pierced through Lamar's brain and killed him.</p>

  <p>"You two! What are you waiting for? Hurry up and kill that brat. He is  Luo Zheng Luo!" Lamar roared. He was furious at Omari and Santino for standing there like statues when he was so clearly in danger.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng Luo?"</p>

  <p>"That brat is  Luo Zheng Luo?"</p>

  <p>Santino and Omari had noticed that the arrows shot by Luo Zheng were surprisingly powerful. Lamar had become truly helpless when Lacey had stalled him.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! So this is Luo Zheng! Lamar, I will help you kill him!" With a hearty laugh, Omari changed direction and flew past Lacey, straight towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>As he saw this, Chantel, a Soul Sea Realm master of the Demon Night, didn't wait for Luo Zheng or Lacey to say anything. Instead, she turned her body to face Omari and sent out tens of thousands of dark blue wind blades to stop him.</p>

  <p>"I am your opponent," Santino said as he came to stand before Chantel.</p>

  <p>The ogres had three Soul Sea Realm masters, but the Demon Night only had two. The situation had become extremely unfavorable for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Besides the war sages and Soul Sea Realm masters in the sky, there were also countless war lords, war generals, and war fighters bathed in blood as they engaged in a life-and-death fight in the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>However, the Demon Night members were extremely powerful. In battles between war lords and war lords, between war generals and war generals, and between war fighters and war fighters, the Demon Night had always gained the upper hand, forcing the ogres to retreat step by step.</p>

  <p>But right now, the war lords, war generals, and war fighters of the Demon Night did not wish to fight. They were focused on the battle in the sky.</p>

  <p>Their winning wouldn't determine the results of the war. The war would be over if the Soul Sea Realm masters of the Demon Night lost. So when the Demon Night members watched the three powerful ogre warriors at the Soul Sea Realm enter the battle, despair filled them.</p>

  <p>"Are our queens unable to protect us anymore?" a woman of the Demon Night asked sorrowfully. The weapon in her hand had already dropped to the ground, her expression gloomy as she muttered to herself.</p>

  <p>She wasn't the only one who was praying. The other Demon Night women were also praying for the three queens of the Demon Night to bring them a miracle at the last moment.</p>

  <p>The Eight-diagram Wheel was floating far away in the sky. The Ancestral Dragon was jumping around on the wheel while making gurgling noises. It seemed to be in a fretful mood.</p>

  <p>Zheng's imprinting had been engraved in the Ancestral Dragon's soul. It could feel the danger Luo Zheng was facing, but Delroy, who was standing to the side, used an enchanted barrier to envelop the Ancestral Dragon. It was still so young that it couldn't cross this barrier, no matter how hard it tried.</p>

  <p>"Let's go down and help Luo Zheng. We can't really let him die here," Delroy said coldly.</p>

  <p>Woody snorted and said, "Humph! He knew that we wouldn't watch him die. That's why he rushed in without a care!"</p>

  <p>Max smiled and said, "At least he brought us to the Sea God Continent.</p>

  <p>How hard would it be to deal with a few ogre rats? Woody, Dorothea, you two go help him."</p>

  <p>Dorothea nodded and jumped down from the Eight-diagram Wheel.</p>

  <p>Despite his unwillingness, Woody waved the Black Nether Saber in his hand, turned into a streak of light, and flew towards the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>When Lacey saw another ogre at the Soul Sea Realm rushing down, she gritted her teeth and bit the tip of her tongue again, continuing to burn her blood essence.</p>

  <p>Burning one's blood essence could produce an even stronger power in a short period of time, but one's blood essence couldn't burn indefinitely. It would take a long time to recover and replenish the used blood essence.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>Water-colored tornadoes began to dance about crazily in quick succession. But Lacey knew that it was impossible for her to stop the two ogres at the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>She shifted her gaze to Luo Zheng and noticed that he did not shoot any arrows again. Instead, he was standing still with a smile on his face.</p>

  <p>'What is going on?</p>

  <p>Has he given up?' she thought.</p>

  <p>Lacey hadn't interacted much with Luo Zheng, but she understood his personality. He was definitely not someone who would give up so easily, but why would he stop shooting arrows?</p>

  <p>As she finished the thought, Lacey saw two people rapidly approaching them from a distance.</p>

  <p>A man and a woman. The man held a black saber while the woman had a flower in her right eye. They looked strange, but the strength that radiated off them was inexplicably incomparable.</p>

  <p>Lacey's eyes widened as she realized that the two of them were actually above the Soul Sea Realm. Even from afar, Lacey could feel their bodies emit an extremely terrifying Mu Ning, something that not even Amber could compare to.</p>

  <p>'Are they at the Spirit Supreme Realm?' Lacey thought.</p>

  <p>The Demon Night members in this world were still in contact with the ones in the Upper World. Thanks to the queens' statues, it wasn't difficult for them to learn about the Upper World, so it had been pretty easy for Lacey to reach this conclusion.</p>

  <p>But the three ogre Soul Sea Realm masters were different. They didn't even know that the realm above the Soul Sea Realm was called the Spirit Supreme Realm. So when they saw Dorothea and Woody, they were confused.</p>

  <p>'Why are they so powerful?' they all wondered. 'They are even more powerful than the warriors at the Soul Sea Realm! Are they really immortals from the Upper World?'</p>

  <p>The fear and bewilderment were palpable among the members of the Demon Night as well as the ogres. Both sides were speculating about the intentions of the approaching man and woman— which side were they actually on?</p>

  <p>With the strength of these two added, destroying the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place and the two sacred places of the ogres was just too simple.</p>

  <p>But how could such powerful warriors interfere in a war of this level?</p>

  <p>The answer came quickly. Dorothea slowly floated towards Luo Zheng and said,</p>

  <p>"Hey, are you done? Finish this battle as soon as possible. We still need to find materials for Hank to make the puppets." Dorothea and her companions weren't taking the battle seriously at all. To the Celestial Position warriors, this kind of war was as boring as hell.</p>

  <p>Woody glared coldly at Luo Zheng and said, "You are useless. You can't even defeat a guy at the Soul Sea Realm. It can't be that you have enough talent to obtain the golden title of the Celestial Position."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shrugged, not showing any signs of weakness as he faced Woody.</p>

  <p>He only smiled and said, "When I step into the Spirit Supreme Realm, I'll beat ten guys like you."</p>

  <p>Dorothea laughed out loud and said, "That is quite possible!"</p>

  <p>To be honest, when Woody and Dorothea were at the Life and Death Realm, they couldn't fight against a powerful warrior at the Soul Sea Realm. But Luo Zheng could do this. He would be considered a talented warrior even in the Celestial Position race.</p>

  <p>Woody, however, hadn't been fond of Luo Zheng from the beginning, which was why he mocked him.</p>

  <p>The members of the Demon Night and the ogres stared at this trio as they chatted and ribbed each other.</p>

  <p>Lacey, Chantel, and many war sages of the Demon Night became excited as they saw who the two mighty masters were talking to. Some of them had felt that they had been collapsing before these two came along. They had been tensed for a long time and now, they could finally relax.</p>

  <p>Because at this moment, as they watched Luo Zheng banter with Dorothea and Woody, they knew that the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place would be safe.</p>

  <p>The ogres, on the other hand, had different thoughts. The three Soul Sea Realm masters, Lamar, Omari, and Santino, as well as the war sages, war lords, and war fighters, felt their hearts plummeting into a bottomless abyss.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and the powerful warriors seemed like friends, and this was a death sentence to the ogres.</p>

  <p>For the two sacred places of the ogres, this battle was a gamble.</p>

  <p>Everything was on the line. The appearance of Dorothea and Woody was probably a preamble to their disappearance from the Sea God Continent.</p>
