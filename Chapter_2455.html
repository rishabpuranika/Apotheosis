<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2455 The Destroying Light </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Solomon led all the other disciples out to fight against the Death Bringers.</p>

  <p>But the group of top-rank True Gods was by no means on the same level as these horrifying opponents.</p>

  <p>Under the snake sea's impact by the Death Bringers, the enchanted barriers and the magic arrays arranged by all sorts of magic weapons were as fragile as eggs,. Not even the True Gods could resist in such a situation.</p>

  <p>Everyone continued shrinking back and drawing together, ready to retreat.</p>

  <p>Under such a defeat, the True Gods were dispersed by the Death Bringers and were most likely to die very soon.</p>

  <p>"Just die here?"</p>

  <p>"I can't accept that!"</p>

  <p>"There are hundreds of thousands of fourth-grade beasts. You're not even qualified to fight with your full strength..."</p>

  <p>"Move back! Move back! Ah..."</p>

  <p>All the True Gods seemed full of despair— more and more of them were swept away by the Death Bringers, disappearing in the vast sea of snakes.</p>

  <p>There was no doubt that they would perish in the end.</p>

  <p>Many of the True Gods merely gave up resisting and remained still as they waited for death.</p>

  <p>But amidst the chaos, the Death Bringers suddenly disappeared in an instant.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the place quieted down. Only some True Gods failed to recover from the shock. Somewhat blurry roars resounded and they quickly realized what had happened.</p>

  <p>"Unbelievable! They disappeared!"</p>

  <p>"All of them are gone!"</p>

  <p>"Oh my God!"</p>

  <p>"They made it!"</p>

  <p>"The Snake Spirit has been killed."</p>

  <p>In their excitement, the survivors began cheering.</p>

  <p>If the Snake Spirit hadn't been killed, probably everyone would've died within half a minute.</p>

  <p>But in the middle of the cheer, the ground began to shake.</p>

  <p>Zheng rushed ahead and killed the small jasper snake in a series of swift movements.</p>

  <p>Even the avatar under his control failed to make a move, having arrived a moment too late.</p>

  <p>And after killing the snake, Zheng did not linger.</p>

  <p>He returned promptly with his avatar.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Yan and the guy with soybean-like eyes were busy rescuing Reinhard.</p>

  <p>Yan's strength had already far exceeded Zheng's imagination and he had no choice but to allow her to take the risk and face the Multiple Antennae Snake. As her brother, he was still reluctant to put her in harm's way, but it was a necessity.</p>

  <p>Clatter...</p>

  <p>Zheng heard some kind of friction on the ground when he returned to a certain distance.</p>

  <p>Then, the earth shook violently.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The ground began to rise like a mountain growing from earth.</p>

  <p>In several snaps, the ground shattered as it continued rising, followed by an enormous monster.</p>

  <p>"Multiple Antennae Snake!"</p>

  <p>When Zheng raised his head, his face sank.</p>

  <p>It looked nothing like a snake— it was more like a strange, ferocious creature.</p>

  <p>Its body was covered with long, thin, flexible tentacles. Like a huge sphere, eyes covered its surface.</p>

  <p>"Yan! Reinhard!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes flashed— he found Yan and the other two underneath the Multiple Antennae Snake.</p>

  <p>Though Zheng didn't know what magic weapon he used as defense, Reinhard looked fine. He appeared like a hedgehog, the sword light ceaselessly shooting at him from all directions.</p>

  <p>Yan and the soybean-eyed guy shuttled back and forth among countless tentacles. It seemed that they managed to skillfully resist the attacks.</p>

  <p>The Multiple Antennae Snake was not as powerful as they had imagined.</p>

  <p>Although its tentacles were indeed very fast, it wasn't very difficult for them to deal with them once they seized good windows of opportunity.</p>

  <p>"Hooo..."</p>

  <p>All the eyes on the snake's body widened at the same time.</p>

  <p>They began to follow a red light until a peculiar set of blood Sanskrit words formed within the eyes.</p>

  <p>As an ancient beast, the Multiple Antennae Snake had many unsolved mysteries.</p>

  <p>When he noticed the words, Zheng suddenly called out, "Yan! Run away!</p>

  <p>Don't push it!"</p>

  <p>As he roared, he rushed over quickly.</p>

  <p>When Yan, Reinhard, and the soybean-eyed guy realized something was off, they began retreating.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>The rays of red light spurted from the eyes in all directions.</p>

  <p>They began penetrating the soft layer of earth at the bottom of the Sunrest Tree before spreading to both sides and passing through the layers of mist, all the way to the edge of the debate venue.</p>

  <p>An enchanted barrier, shaped like an eggshell, appeared in the thin camber line at the edge. It blocked out the red light immediately, keeping the light within.</p>

  <p>And so the light shot up and through the mist, arriving at a height of over a hundred thousand feet and finally landing on another enchanted barrier shaped like a beehive.</p>

  <p>"Let's go!"</p>

  <p>Seeing the rays of red light spread to the infinite distance, Reinhard was shocked speechless.</p>

  <p>Regardless of what the light was, its power was unimaginable if it could penetrate the mist and reach so far away.</p>

  <p>Initially, Reinhard found that the Multiple Antennae Snake was not as powerful as he had originally thought. After getting rid of the trouble with Yan's help, he wanted to kill the snake with the other two. Now, he realized how naive his plan actually was.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the three of them were still very close to the snake. As its body began spinning, the rays of light continued moving, but the gap in the middle remained for their escape.</p>

  <p>With careful dodges, the three quickly shuttled away and headed straight for Zheng.</p>

  <p>But the fear incarnations who were far away weren't so lucky.</p>

  <p>The fear incarnations kept a certain distance from each other as they all had their own memories. Even with the impulse to kill their "prey", they were all more fixated on finding a way to escape the damned place. And as for the True Gods, they figured they could let other fear incarnations deal with them.</p>

  <p>When some of the fear incarnations were stabbed by the light, their flesh and bodies disappeared until they were nothing but a pile of bones, falling to the ground.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>A ray of red light shot towards the fiend called Edmond.</p>

  <p>It then happened to hit Edmond's body.</p>

  <p>Though Edmond's figure was enormous, the flesh on his body was turned to nothing by the light.</p>

  <p>"The destroying light?" In spite of the situation, Edmond's expression didn't seem to change too much. 'Even the Multiple Antennae Snake exists here.</p>

  <p>This place seems so interesting... I'm quite curious now.'</p>

  <p>A white shadow emerged from the surface of Edmond's huge body as it shook. After the shadow covered the body, the red light couldn't penetrate it in the slightest.</p>

  <p>Instead, the lights continued to wander around until one of them went directly into the depths of the debate venue.</p>

  <p>The woman with long hair had made it to a huge iron bridge. She seemed to have figured she was going to get hit by one of the lights one way or another, so she turned around and rotated her finger a few times in the air before stepping onto the iron bridge, as calm as a rock.</p>

  <p>When the red light shot towards her, it strangely changed direction, reflecting at another angle.</p>
