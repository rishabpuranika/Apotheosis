<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The opening of the Eternal Scroll Painting was an important event for all forces of Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Therefore, all the races on the Other Shore arrived ahead of time. Then, the allied races planned to strategize and cooperate together in the scroll painting.</p>

  <p>In the past few days, more and more races on the Other Shore had gathered at the location of the Three Purities Stones.</p>

  <p>There was the Extermination race that was stronger than the Violet Cloud race, the Sickle race whose members had notably strange form, the Delicacy race, and other races.</p>

  <p>However, the majority of the races in the chaos did not come. Aside from the Oneness Sky Palace, only the Ear Mice showed up.</p>

  <p>Of course, the Ear Mouse race didn't come for the Eternal Scroll Painting.</p>

  <p>There was a preparation period of ten days before the Eternal Scroll Painting opened, and a large number of Other Shore creatures gathered at that time. They went there to do business.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng had a small argument with the Violet Cloud race, and then his physical body retreated from the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>He had to hang his soul to the Three Purities Stone before the scroll painting opened. However, his soul was still in the Constant Glory Stage.</p>

  <p>Although his Soul of Light had nine Holy Soul Imprints, it was still nothing compared to his physical body. Thus, he needed to be careful.</p>

  <p>Before he went to the Blooming Jade Stage, he had sent someone to ask Elizabeth about the situation in the place.</p>

  <p>Once he confirmed that everything was fine, he headed for the Blooming Jade Stage from the Constant Glory Stage.</p>

  <p>The moment he arrived in the snowy and icy world, he saw that many Other Shore creatures neatly stood in front of him and bowed to him, while Elizabeth stood at the side as she quietly stared at him.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore creatures always looked down on the creatures that were in the form of souls on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>During so many years, Zheng's soul was probably the only one that enjoyed a better treatment.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing?" Zheng asked as he looked back at Elizabeth.</p>

  <p>"We are here to meet and welcome you," Elizabeth said with a chuckle.</p>

  <p>Zheng frowned and groaned, "You don't have to do this next time."</p>

  <p>"Okay," Elizabeth said nonchalantly with a shrug.</p>

  <p>She knew that he was quite tired of special treatments, but she only did so because of one thing.</p>

  <p>She wanted to show her ability and tell him that she could manage the entire Blooming Jade Stage very well.</p>

  <p>As Zheng's strength increased, the members of the Sun Crow race, such as Bagot and Micah, became worried. They felt that they were of little use to Zheng. It was dangerous if they just stayed in the Oneness Sky Palace like that, since they might be considered insignificant warriors who would be sacrificed at any time.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth didn't think that Zheng would do such a thing, but she understood the worries of the Sun Crow race.</p>

  <p>That was why she was very happy when Zheng gave her the chance to rule over the Blooming Jade Stage. She became completely dedicated to the task.</p>

  <p>Now that Zheng had passed by, of course she had to display her capabilities!</p>

  <p>Under the protection of Elizabeth and the Other Shore creatures, Zheng quickly crossed the Blooming Jade Stage.</p>

  <p>The bald giant, Pompeo, also did well, but it was inconvenient for Zheng to visit him in the form of a soul in that stage. "Have all the Other Shore races in the entire Blooming Jade Stage surrendered?" Zheng asked as he looked at the ice castles in the distance.</p>

  <p>"Of course. A few Other Shore races that refused to surrender have been eliminated," Elizabeth answered quickly.</p>

  <p>"You did a good job," Zheng praised. "But there's one thing you need to understand. Since I let you take charge of the Blooming Jade Stage, it means I trust you. Therefore, you don't have to continue to gain my trust," he added.</p>

  <p>In any case, if Zheng didn't trust Elizabeth at that time, he could've asked someone from the Oneness Sky Palace to take care of Pompeo.</p>

  <p>When Zheng saw through her thoughts, her voice became lower.</p>

  <p>"Okay, I know."</p>

  <p>Yet, she was not unhappy at all. She was a little joyful even. After all, what had happened was somehow another answer she wanted.</p>

  <p>There was no barrier on the way from Stage Twenty-nine of the Other Shore to Stage Thirty-two, so Zheng's soul had a smooth journey to the Grand Plain Stage.</p>

  <p>When he arrived at the location of the Three Purities Stones, he found that more and more Other Shore races had assembled.</p>

  <p>All the Other Shore creatures that reached the Holy Soul Realm and obtained the Myriad Tribulations Bodies already attached their souls and bodies to the Three Purities Stones. They just had to wait for the Eternal Scroll Painting to open.</p>

  <p>Once again, Zheng entered his own Three Purities Stone and sat upright at another corner. Not long after, his soul also turned into the same anchor body as the first one.</p>

  <p>Afterwards, he only had to wait for the Eternal Scroll Painting to open as well.</p>

  <p>While he waited, the members of various Other Shore races arrived one after another.</p>

  <p>They were slightly confused when they saw Zheng, and Zheng silently observed them in return.</p>

  <p>Three days later, the noisy crowd suddenly lowered their voices.</p>

  <p>Out of the blue, three blood-red balls appeared not far away!</p>

  <p>The blood-red ball was the most important symbol of the Nihility race.</p>

  <p>They were the only race on the Other Shore that could fight the Element Spirit race head-on. As soon as the red balls appeared, the air immediately felt oppressive.</p>

  <p>Although many races joined the Nihility race, the Nihility race had brought much fear to the Other Shore creatures. Not only did they have all sorts of insane ideas, but they also brutally implemented those ideas!</p>

  <p>As the blood-red balls continued to approach, the Other Shore creatures avoided them. Even some of the Eternal Realm masters didn't want to have a dispute with the Nihility race, so they stood up and moved aside.</p>

  <p>The warriors of the Violet Cloud race stayed thousands of feet away from Zheng on the other side.</p>

  <p>When they saw that the three blood-red balls of the Nihility race had arrived, they got a bit shocked.</p>

  <p>"The members of the Nihility race are coming!"</p>

  <p>"Will they do something against us?"</p>

  <p>Even though the Violet Cloud race was a big race in Stage Thirty-two, they were still very much afraid of the Nihility race.</p>

  <p>"What are you afraid of?" Howe coldly scolded them, and then cupped his hands towards the blood-red balls that slowly moved forward. "Would you tell me why you came over to visit us?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The Violet Cloud race relied on the Element Spirit race, and the Element Spirit race always supported them no matter what happened. Thus, Howe didn't find any reason to be afraid.</p>

  <p>"Fuck off! Who visits your Violet Cloud race anyway?</p>

  <p>Is this your race's territory?" a cold female voice inside one of the blood-red balls hissed.</p>

  <p>As soon as Howe heard the female voice, his jaw dropped.</p>

  <p>As an Eternal Realm master who had traveled around Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore, he was very familiar with that voice. It belonged to Samantha of the Nihility race.</p>

  <p>The Nihility race had three famous women? Samantha and her two sisters, Sienna and Stella. Samantha was the best among them in terms of strength and status.</p>

  <p>Now, Howe was a powerful figure in the Grand Plain Stage, so he felt slightly embarrassed when Samantha rudely mocked him.</p>

  <p>Still, he gritted his teeth and endured it for the sake of his race. Then, he led the members of the Violet Cloud race to retreat to the side.</p>

  <p>He felt perplexed while they walked back. It seemed that the members of the Nihility race did not target the Violet Cloud race, so who could it be?</p>

  <p>Only the Three Eyes race was in the area they were headed to, but this race was rather average. In what way were they qualified for Samantha to have personally taken action?</p>

  <p>Aside from Howe, many Other Shore creatures also stared at the blood-red balls as they slowly moved.</p>

  <p>To their surprise, the three blood-red balls all stopped in front of Zheng.</p>
