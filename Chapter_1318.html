</p>

  <p>No one could help Luo Luo Zheng right now; even the cyan dragon's simple teachings were meaningless. Luo Luo Zheng could only rely on himself to convince himself and defeat himself. During the struggle, he had to fight with his mind and attitude and no one could meddle in it; unless they had a way of changing his mind. And changing someone's mind meant changing their very soul and foundation. They would lose their memories and become a different person altogether.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Riyad walked up to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng opened his eyes as he felt the presence of a Soul Sea Realm warrior in front of him. He then looked at Riyad indifferently. Although he hadn't met him before, he could easily figure out his identity and guessed that the man in front of him was the one who had sent the three warriors to kill him today.</p>

  <p>"Where are they?" Riyad asked coldly with an icy stare at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Where are who?" Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Riyad laughed coldly and replied, "The three warriors. Who else do you think I am talking about? Will you pretend that you don't know them?"</p>

  <p>"Ah yes. Them! Well... I killed them." Luo Luo Zheng shrugged.</p>

  <p>"You killed them? On your own?" Riyad was skeptical.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng let out a long sigh, and then responded, "Yes, just me. On my own..."</p>

  <p>When they heard the conversation between Luo Luo Zheng and Riyad, a stunned expression appeared on the faces of the other warriors, who were busy cultivating or resting nearby.</p>

  <p>There seemed to be a conflict between Luo Luo Zheng at the Life and Death Realm and Riyad at the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, Luo Luo Zheng had actually killed three warriors who worked for Riyad...</p>

  <p>Was this guy really that powerful?</p>

  <p>If he tried to provoke Riyad, wouldn't he be courting death?</p>

  <p>Riyad seemed to be thinking the same. "You're courting death."</p>

  <p>Although he already knew Luo Luo Zheng had killed his men, he got even more furious after hearing the confirmation from his enemy's mouth.</p>

  <p>"Everyone has to seek a road for himself..." Luo Luo Zheng suddenly raised his head and looked up at the sky. It was a cloudy night, and the sky was covered in fog.</p>

  <p>Hearing Luo Zheng's words, a strange expression appeared on Riyad's face.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"I want to know the meaning of and what lies at the end of this road..."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng responded.</p>

  <p>This time, not only Riyad, but everyone was also confused. Was this guy crazy? Or had he lost his mind out of fear. Did Riyad scare the hell out of this guy?</p>

  <p>Seeing Luo Zheng's indifferent face, Riyad laughed. "It's useless to act like a madman now. There are two choices for you. You can either be enslaved and work for me, or you can wait until tomorrow. By then I will surely kill you when you go to the mines."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng looked at him as indifferently as before. His gaze was extremely clear. Suddenly, he smacked his head and muttered, "I know why I feel tired of something. I've heard these kinds of words countless times!" As he spoke, he also smiled. His smile was pure and simple.</p>

  <p>This time, Riyad was left speechless with annoyance. He even had a shroud of doubt that Luo Luo Zheng was not pretending to be crazy, but had really become insane after being scared by him.</p>

  <p>"Even though I know why I am tired of something, I still can't find out the meaning or a way out..." Luo Luo Zheng frowned as he stared at Riyad.</p>

  <p>Since there were so many warriors from the Lower World and armored warriors of the Spiritual Force Sacred Place around them right now, it was not appropriate for Riyad to take any action. If this place was empty, Riyad would have begun the fight long ago.</p>

  <p>"This Life and Death Realm warrior seems to be quite crazy..."</p>

  <p>"He must be scared very much and is too terrified to face Riyad; but it is useless for him to do that; act like a fool, I mean! Riyad never lets off anyone who offends him. It's useless for anyone to beg for mercy, and even more useless to pretend to be insane! That man, is dead!"</p>

  <p>"I don't feel like he has lost his mind. His words sound a little strange, but he seems to be thinking about something."</p>

  <p>The warriors didn't dare get close to Luo Luo Zheng and Riyad, but they didn't leave either. They knew that Riyad wouldn't kill people right now, so they didn't need to worry about being involved in the fight. Of course, they still lowered their voices anyway as they discussed, so that Riyad wouldn't be able to hear them.</p>

  <p>"What is the point of pursuing to be powerful? Do you know the answer?" Luo Luo Zheng suddenly asked as he stared at Riyad.</p>

  <p>Riyad's eyelids twitched and he clenched his fists. He couldn't tolerate Luo Luo Zheng and was almost about to lose control. At the beginning, he just wanted to put psychological pressure on Luo Luo Zheng so that he would obediently become his slave. He did not expect that Luo Luo Zheng would not only ignore him, but also talk nonsense!</p>

  <p>He really wanted to attack Luo Luo Zheng there and then but alas!</p>

  <p>In the end, he managed to suppress the anger inside and not say a word.</p>

  <p>Tomorrow, he would think of a way to deal with this idiot. Promising that he would kill Luo Luo Zheng for sure, Riyad turned around and left.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng did not let him go. Instead, he moved and in the blink of an eye, was standing in front of Riyad. He stared at him and asked,</p>

  <p>"What's the point in pursuing to be powerful? Do you know that?"</p>

  <p>Riyad wanted to leave, but Luo Luo Zheng blocked his way once more. The former was almost mad with anger now.</p>

  <p>As for the nearby warriors, their eyes were wide open as they watched this scene. One of them remarked in a low voice, "He is probably out of his mind after being scared by Riyad. Otherwise, he wouldn't have the gut to block his way..."</p>
