<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Thinking of what he had just experienced, Zheng was a bit shaken on the inside. His life had been on the line just now.</p>

  <p>If he had been even a little slow in responding, the black insect in the passageway would have devoured him in no time. He would have been dead meat.</p>

  <p>After resting for a while, Zheng remembered something. He suddenly reached out and used the Cross-world Theurgy to extract strength source from his body.</p>

  <p>However, when the Power Shaping began, the ball of strength suddenly vanished into thin air, unable to take any shape.</p>

  <p>"What happened?"</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes narrowed as a strange suspicion nagged at him. That was an odd thing to happen. Logically, this should not have occurred at all.</p>

  <p>He seemed to ponder on something as he once again readied himself, this time about to condense a flame.</p>

  <p>In the Godly Tile of his inner world, there existed a square that contained the Elementary Fire Godly Way. At the moment, it began to glow. The chaotic energy was constantly extracted and sent outside of his cinnabar field.</p>

  <p>However, despite this, no internal momentum flowed through his hand currently.</p>

  <p>Unconvinced, Zheng continued to condense other Godly Ways. He kept trying several times but in vain.</p>

  <p>It was not until now that Zheng was certain of one fact. "Is it that internal momentum cannot be condensed in this world?" he mumbled to himself.</p>

  <p>"I don't know if it is only me who can't condense it or if all True Gods struggle in doing so."</p>

  <p>"Nothing is wrong with you. Perhaps it's this world that is abnormal."</p>

  <p>Master Evil's voice sounded out of the blue, interrupting his thoughts.</p>

  <p>Zheng had left the Golden Beast Statue in the Time Sea Forbidden Land, causing Master Evil to manifest once again in Zheng's mind. He had followed Zheng to reach here.</p>

  <p>Ever since he followed Zheng into the Time Sea, he had been witness to a lot along the way.</p>

  <p>Not only did he come face to face with the Holy Beings, he saw battles among the consummate True Gods; the Time Elk which was a sixth-grade fierce beast; and numerous other awe-inspiring things.</p>

  <p>Although he only had a strand of soul left, he felt that the journey with Zheng had been worth every minute.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded in agreement. Along the way, he had not encountered any other beings except for the long and thin insect. Perhaps it was more likely that the world he was in caused this to happen to him.</p>

  <p>He looked around, appraising his surroundings. Everything around him was grey and hazy. Except for the shadows of some trees, all that he saw in the distance seemed unreal.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>At this moment, the five-colored circle of light beneath his feet shrank rapidly. In the blink of an eye, it disappeared, revealing a barren land.</p>

  <p>If the light was truly a time passage, then could he be in a different era in the history of the divine land?</p>

  <p>"The other True Gods didn't come into this world with me..."</p>

  <p>When Zheng had descended, he saw many True Gods fall with him.</p>

  <p>However, the light bands around everyone's bodies were different. Zheng was unable to tell if they had landed at different positions in the same era, or if they had entered into times that were altogether different from him.</p>

  <p>Perhaps this world only acted as a space for a certain period of time built by the jade seal.</p>

  <p>After observing for a while, Zheng chose a path and set off.</p>

  <p>In fact, there was no clear path ahead of him. This was perhaps one of those rare places that few people had ever trod on.</p>

  <p>Walking along the sparse bushes for a while, Zheng noticed the bushes getting lower and lower, the soil under his feet becoming drier. Not long after he passed through the forest, the gray mist disappeared. Before him now was just a boundless expanse of desert.</p>

  <p>Sand dunes with heights of several thousand feet stood like pillars in front of Zheng. At a glance, they looked incomparably magnificent�</p>

  <p>"Anybody here?"</p>

  <p>As Zheng looked into the distance, he saw a white figure appear at the top of the sixth sand dune.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng's eyesight was extraordinary, the figure seemed blurry to him. He had no way of telling what the person looked like from this distance. The figure waved at him frantically.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Without wasting a second longer, Zheng's body flashed and turned into a sharp arrow, hurtling forward.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng was still unable to fly in the air, he could move on the desert at an astonishing speed.</p>

  <p>It only took him a few seconds to cross a sand dune that was over a thousand feet high and about ten thousand feet wide.</p>

  <p>Before he knew it, Zheng had reached the top of the sixth dune where the figure had appeared before.</p>

  <p>As his feet stepped onto the hot sand, however, Zheng looked around with a puzzled expression on his face.</p>

  <p>The shadow of the figure had vanished from sight�</p>

  <p>"It's strange. It was here just now." Zheng frowned.</p>

  <p>Master Evil was also immersed in observing the surroundings. "This place is very strange. Zheng, be careful," he warned Zheng, a tremor in his voice.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded and turned. His expression immediately changed, one of unfeigned surprise.</p>

  <p>"The forest has disappeared as well?"</p>

  <p>He had only just entered this desert, and the forest behind him seemed to have melted away!</p>

  <p>Master Evil's voice broke through his thoughts once again. "Zheng, the figure is here again."</p>

  <p>Zheng's gaze swept across the dunes and he saw the faint figure on the top of the sand dune on his right, which was not so far away. The figure gesticulated at Zheng wildly.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes flashed sharply. "No matter who you are, I will find you!"</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Zheng transformed into a sharp arrow, travelling along the side of the giant sand dune with the speed of light.</p>

  <p>Each step that he took on the sand blew the particles into the air, causing a burst of sand rain.</p>

  <p>But when he arrived on the sand dune where the figure had just now been, it disappeared in an instant and reappeared on a sand dune further from him.</p>

  <p>Without hesitation, Zheng continued to follow the figure.</p>

  <p>He traveled for thousands of miles. The scenery around him did not change a bit. Sand dunes still connected each other. The endless stretch continued without break. He did not see a single living creature along the way, not even a cactus.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, the shadow is strange. You'd better stop chasing it." Master Evil frowned, anxiety tracing his voice. Zheng had been trying to catch the figure fruitlessly.</p>

  <p>Zheng laughed. "Even if I don't chase it, I still don't have a way out. What more is there to worry about?"</p>

  <p>He had fallen into a desperate situation back in the Time Sea Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>Within the forbidden area, he could not use the mountain token. After leaving the area, however, it was even more impossible that he could use the token right in front of the Holy Beings to escape to the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>Since he had no way back, he could only march ahead.</p>

  <p>As Zheng finished speaking, his eyes flashed. "The shadow has changed its movement!"</p>

  <p>Previously, the shadow had been waving at Zheng from the top of the sand dunes. Suddenly, it pointed to the back of the sand dunes, as if telling him that there was something there.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Without hesitation, Zheng shot in the direction the figure pointed.</p>

  <p>As he stood on the top of a different sand dune, the white shadow disappeared like before. But then Zheng saw the shadow appear at the bottom of the sand dune. The shadow pointed to a human-shaped skeleton on the ground. In the very next second, it easily crept inside the skeleton.</p>

  <p>Splash...</p>

  <p>As he slid all the way down the sand dune, Zheng slowly approached the human-shaped skeleton. The puzzled expression on his face deepened.</p>

  <p>The sand dunes in the desert flowed with the wind. If someone died here, the body would be buried in the sand in the matter of a few days. It was impossible for it to lie on the surface of the sand like this!</p>

  <p>From the traces on the surface of the skeleton, one could not tell how many years it had been since the person died.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, look at the hand of the skeleton!" Master Evil pointed out.</p>

  <p>Zheng's gaze zoomed in on the three faint black rings on the skeleton's fingers. The rings were well made, like a sword that had been smelted and forged back into a circle.</p>

  <p>"Is this the skeleton of the consummate True God from the Sword Clan?"</p>

  <p>Zheng asked, stunned.</p>

  <p>Back in the valley, Zheng had observed the consummate True Gods of these powerful clans.</p>

  <p>The consummate True God from the Sword Clan remained silent, but the sharp look in his eyes had left a deep impression on Zheng. There was a similar set of three rings on the man's right hand.</p>

  <p>When Zheng had run his eye over these rings before, he had been somewhat confused as to why this person wore three space rings. He had even asked Aleyna about it in secret.</p>

  <p>Aleyna had told him that the rings were not the kind of space rings that could hold things.</p>

  <p>Rather they were symbols of supreme honor in the Sword Clan. They were also precious and powerful treasures that could save one's life.</p>

  <p>"The consummate True God from the Sword Clan was indeed wearing white clothes!"</p>

  <p>Thinking of the white shadow that had constantly flashed before, Zheng felt a faint sense of unease rise in him.</p>

  <p>The consummate True Gods had entered the circle of light about five minutes before Zheng did. And within this short period of time, a consummate True God had died?</p>

  <p>Moreover, a consummate True God's body could not decay so easily.</p>

  <p>It would take ten million or even over a hundred million years for the corpse of an ordinary True God to rot and decompose. Moreover, the bones left in the end would still shine with a brilliant light.</p>

  <p>How long would it take for the corpse of a consummate True God to rot, fester, and eventually turn into a mottled skeleton?</p>

  <p>It was likely that even after several divine eras, it would not turn into such.</p>
