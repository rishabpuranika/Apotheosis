<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2225 The Everest Spirit Mountain </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>The True Gods of the Floating Islands were different from those in the Six-Burden Divine City.</p>

  <p>They were much richer than the True Gods outside the Time Sea and could explore forbidden lands with their points to obtain divine might coins.</p>

  <p>Despite this, the hundreds of divine might coins that Zheng had thrown away were a large sum to them.</p>

  <p>Since they were on the Floating Island of the Han Clan, Zheng knew they couldn't dare to act rashly. He didn't care about the divine might coins.</p>

  <p>All he wanted was to get news of Harold and Yan.</p>

  <p>"If I tell you, all these divine might coins are mine?" The speaker licked his lips.</p>

  <p>Zheng, a proving godly warrior, had generously thrown out hundreds of divine might coins, because of which the True Gods had begun to feverishly speculate about his identity. They usually obtained only a few dozens of divine might coins from exploring a forbidden land. Even if they were lucky enough, they would only get about a hundred coins, and that was after risking their lives.</p>

  <p>But now, they could receive such a large amount of coins merely by sharing a piece of news with Zheng. Their greed knew no bounds.</p>

  <p>"You want to know about the fight between Harold and the Jiang Clan, right? I know about it too. I can tell you," a True God said.</p>

  <p>"Harold rules the Everest Spirit Mountain and has the ability to fight against Holy Beings. He led his men to fight the Jiang Clan a few days ago," another True God chimed in, his eyes fixed on the divine might coins at Zheng's feet.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng had offered a lot of divine might coins, the True Gods wouldn't scramble for them. There were no fixed rules on the Floating Island, but no one dared act recklessly. Moreover, Zheng had offered so many divine might coins at once that it made everyone wary about his background and power.</p>

  <p>Harold's situation wasn't a big secret. The mid-rank True God had warned everyone to be careful when they had gone to the Everest Spirit Mountain. He hadn't expected Zheng to offer so many divine might coins.</p>

  <p>When he saw the other few True Gods scrambling for the coins, his expression shifted. He stared at Zheng as he said, "Don't listen to them. I have first-hand news. Most of them don't even know the inside story."</p>

  <p>"Take the divine might coins. Let's talk about it somewhere else," Zheng said coldly. He did not want to attract too much attention. He had taken an assumed name and called himself Tianxing, but he was still a Luo. His blatant inquiries about Mike's disciple would definitely raise doubts.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng was just a proving godly warrior, he was not inferior to the mid-rank True Gods in terms of aura. It was true that money made the world spin. The mid-rank True God did not show any antipathy to his cold attitude. Instead, he eagerly picked up the divine might coins off the ground and walked away with Zheng.</p>

  <p>Disappointed that they had lost their chance to make a fortune, the other True Gods began to complain.</p>

  <p>"Is that guy crazy?"</p>

  <p>"He offered hundreds of divine might coins for a piece of useless news!"</p>

  <p>"It's a pity he didn't ask me."</p>

  <p>Zheng led the mid-rank True God to a quiet place and said, "You can tell me now."</p>

  <p>The mid-rank True God laughed and said, "I'm very curious. You're just a proving godly warrior. How did you get so many divine might coins?</p>

  <p>Are you from the Han Clan?"</p>

  <p>"Don't ask what doesn't concern you," Zheng said, scowling.</p>

  <p>"That's not an answer, but okay," he said. Afraid that he might annoy Zheng, he continued speaking. After all, he had taken Zheng's coins. "Harold had taken action against the Jiang Clan the last time. To be honest, I'm also curious about why he did that. As Mike's first disciple, he should turn to the Mu Clan even if he wants to take revenge. But not long ago, he attacked the Jiang Clan. He didn't kill anyone, though. At the time, the Jiang Clan had sent their people to various universes. But he had forced back those people."</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded. He knew that.</p>

  <p>Wynn had helped him and Tianming to sneak into the divine land in order to escape the attention of the Mu Clan. As long as Irene was in the Evolutionary Universe, it was impossible for him to escape from the people of the Jiang Clan. She returned to the divine land and had never been seen again since.</p>

  <p>Wynn told Zheng that it was Harold who had stopped the Jiang Clan when Zheng had stealthily gone to the divine land.</p>

  <p>"Can Harold fight against the Holy Beings with his current strength?"</p>

  <p>Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>The mid-rank True God stared longingly into the distance, but then he shook his head. "In terms of real strength, he is inferior to the Holy Beings. After all, the Holy Beings created the universes, and as long as the universes are not destroyed, they will not die. You know, Mike doesn't die although he's at death's doorstep."</p>

  <p>"If the Holy Beings of the Jiang Clan decide to fight, will it be difficult for Harold to deal with them?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>The mid-rank True God looked at Zheng strangely and asked, "Do you really not know or are you pretending not to know?"</p>

  <p>Zheng was about to shake his head when Master Evil's voice sounded in his mind. "Zheng, if Harold has really controlled the Everest Spirit Mountain, he is not afraid of the Holy Beings. Likewise, Estelle has controlled the Soul Wilderness, which is why she isn't afraid of the Holy Beings."</p>

  <p>"Estelle?" Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"The woman on the second floor of the dungeon." Master Evil didn't want to talk about that woman. He had stayed with her in the dungeon for several eras, but even now, the mere mention of her still filled him with fear.</p>

  <p>Estelle wasn't afraid of the Holy Beings. Instead, the Holy Beings were afraid of her.</p>

  <p>Once she had begun ruling the Soul Wilderness, she obtained a treasure scepter. Since then, no Holy Being was as arrogant as before in front of her.</p>

  <p>It was not long after she got the scepter that she used it for the first time.</p>

  <p>And when she had done so, the inner worlds of all the Holy Beings and the divine citizens in the divine land were sealed for three seconds.</p>

  <p>In that moment, the Holy Beings were astonished to find that the intimate connection between them and the universes had disappeared.</p>

  <p>Three seconds was not a long time, but in a crucial moment, it could be absolutely lethal.</p>

  <p>The strength of the Holy Beings was often subtly balanced. If two Holy Beings fought against each other and Estelle used the power of her scepter to freeze them, the result would be very predictable.</p>

  <p>That was why many Holy Beings were afraid of Estelle and some tried to subdue her. But she had disappeared for nine divine eras before recently emerging from the Evolutionary Universe, which had been a surprise to many people.</p>

  <p>Zheng heard Master Evil out before turning to the mid-rank True God and asking, "As you mentioned, Harold is really not afraid of the Jiang Clan.</p>

  <p>Then why did the Jiang Clan stir up trouble this time?"</p>

  <p>The True God laughed and said, "This is the key point. Most people only know superficial news. As far as I know, Harold has been working hard in the Everest Spirit Mountain for many years, but he hasn't taken complete control of it. The Jiang Clan also knows this secret, so they launched an attack at a critical moment. In this case, Harold might die.</p>

  <p>Besides, the descendants of the Luo Clan who follow him will also die."</p>

  <p>"What?" Zheng was shocked.</p>

  <p>Seeing Zheng's expression, the mid-rank True God shook his head and said,</p>

  <p>"It's normal. Whoever fights against the Hall of Holy Beings usually faces a tragic end. Back then when the Luo Clan was defeated, Harold should have chosen a different great clan. With his talent, he might have become a Holy Being. But look where he has ended up now."</p>

  <p>The mid-rank True God seemed to feel that it was a bit too much for him to have received so many divine might coins from Zheng. He was still sighing with emotion about Harold when Zheng turned around to leave. But before Zheng took a step forward, he turned back and asked, "How many points do I need to enter the Everest Spirit Mountain?"</p>

  <p>"Points needed for entering the Everest Spirit Mountain? You want to go in there?" the mid-rank True God asked incredulously, laughing.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p id="top_19">"As a sixth grade forbidden land, the Everest Spirit Mountain requires more than eight thousand points. Mid-rank True Gods like me can only wander around the mountain and don't dare to step in. The top-rank True Gods can fly, but it's hard for them to survive in the mountain. You'd better pursue the Godly Way first," the mid-rank True God advised Zheng.</p>

  <p>But Zheng did not heed his advice.</p>

  <p>His father hadn't made any arrangements after sending him to the divine land. So Zheng had to fight his way out.</p>

  <p>He didn't know what was waiting for him. This was a critical moment, when he had to decide which way to go. If he could meet Yan on the Everest Spirit Mountain, he would not hesitate to go there.</p>
