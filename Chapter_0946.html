<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The laughter of the top-level ogre war lords died down. Maurice slowly walked forward, his Mu Ning becoming more and more domineering. As he walked, a small pit appeared in the ground in front of him but quickly closed up.</p>

  <p>"What do we want?" Maurice stared coldly at Elder Mei and laughed. "We want the Demon Night to give up half of your seats. We want all of the humans in the Tower of Sin, both top-level war lords and war generals, to kill themselves right here!"</p>

  <p>The faces of all the humans and the members of the Demon Night darkened.</p>

  <p>"What? You want all of us humans to take our lives right here? That's too much!"</p>

  <p>"The ogres are too overbearing! They're puffed up with pride!"</p>

  <p>"The ogres have always been domineering. This time, the humans and the Demon Night are going to suffer great misfortune!"</p>

  <p>Ignoring all the comments, Maurice continued to stare coldly at Elder Mei.</p>

  <p>"Do you accept this offer?"</p>

  <p>In the past, the Demon Night would have never accepted such an arbitrary proposal. Even now, although they had gained a few more seats, they were unwilling to give up half of their seats.</p>

  <p>During this trip to the Dark Nether Cave, the Demon Night hadn't suffered a great loss. However, their most important members, Xun and Esther, hadn't made it out of the cave.</p>

  <p>Elder Mei sneered at Maurice, "Maurice, do you really think that Esther is the only talent in the Demon Night?"</p>

  <p>Other than some of the humans, the 128 seat owners on top of the Tower of Sin were all top-level war lords. The top-level war lords all had varying amounts of strength, but the gaps between them weren't too great. The Demon Night was much stronger than the ogres, so they weren't afraid of them. But Maurice was a problem.</p>

  <p>Maurice erupted into laughter. "Oh? What else do you have then? The Heavenly Feather Sacred Place? No matter how strong the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place is, they won't dare to start a war with our sacred places! Moreover, you should know very well that we have war sages in the Tower of Sin!"</p>

  <p>Maurice actually didn't know whether Malcom and Rehaan were alive or dead. He hadn't had time to investigate the secret passage, nor had he received a response when he had tried to use the message rune to contact Malcom.</p>

  <p>However, this wasn't a big deal. Even if Malcom and Rehaan had died, the ogres could still train more war sages, because until now, they were the only ones who knew about the secret passage.</p>

  <p>After the appearance of the two ogre war sages, Colin and Neil, many races had begun to suspect that the ogres had done something inside the Dark Nether Cave.</p>

  <p>And their speculation was grounded. A long time ago, a few of the races had put forward various hypotheses and tried them all out. One of the hypotheses was that if warriors became war sages in the Dark Nether Cave, they would not be affected by the Cursed Land. However, if warriors became war sages in the Dark Nether Cave, they would die because of the Dark Nether Death Light in the cave instead.</p>

  <p>Once, a top-level war lord from the orc race had cultivated to be a war sage in the Dark Nether Cave. He had even broken into a dangerous place in the outer layer of the cave with his improved strength and obtained quite a good opportunity. Unfortunately, when the Dark Nether Death Light once again spread throughout the entire cave, he'd had no choice but to return to the Tower of Sin and live there for a month before he died.</p>

  <p>It was a pity that none of the other races had found the secret passage at the bottom of the tower.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Elder Mei was silent, Maurice let out a hideous laugh. "You can consider it! But I want to tell you that I'm not asking you for your opinion.</p>

  <p>I'm giving you an order!"</p>

  <p>Maurice felt that he had no need to discuss this with the Demon Night. If it weren't for the fact that he was afraid of the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place and Amber, he would have already massacred the humans and the Demon Night today!</p>

  <p>After he finished speaking, Maurice turned to look at the rest of the seat owners. The expressions of the human top-level war lords were gloomy and afraid, as if they were lambs waiting to be slaughtered.</p>

  <p>Before Maurice could say something else, one of the human top-level war lords said, "We humans are willing to make a concession and lead all our warriors out of the tower!"</p>

  <p>This was a substantial concession. All the sacred places agreed that the Tower of Sin was extremely crucial to the development of a race.</p>

  <p>Cultivating in the Tower of Sin could save several hundred years of time. It was countless times faster than cultivating in the outside world.</p>

  <p>Exiting the Tower of Sin meant that the humans would voluntarily forfeit their future. The speed at which the Purple Heart Sacred Place was able to develop would definitely be slower than that of any other race. The decline of the entire human sacred place would be inevitable!</p>

  <p>"A concession?" Maurice sneered. "Do you humans even qualify to make a concession?"</p>

  <p>He hated the human race to the core. After all, the Demon Night had only allied themselves with the human race. And they had interfered in matters that had nothing to do with them because of the sword spirit of that human boy, Luo Zheng. And just recently, all the ogres had been expelled from the Tower of Sin because of the human race, so Maurice wasn't going to let the human race off so easily.</p>

  <p>"What else do you want then? We've already proposed to leave the tower voluntarily," a human top-level war lord said angrily.</p>

  <p>Maurice burst out into laughter. He suddenly took a step forward and crossed a distance of about 60 feet. His huge hand reached out at lightning speed and instantly grabbed the head of the human top-level war lord.</p>

  <p>"What else do I want? Didn't I already say it?"</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Sneering, Maurice tightened his grip around the human war lord's head. The human war lord didn't even have time to direct his life vitality before his head exploded like a watermelon. Then, Maurice threw the corpse of the human war lord like he was throwing some trash to the side and turned to look at the remaining humans.</p>

  <p>Many of the human top-level war lords had died in the Dark Nether Cave.</p>

  <p>The remaining ones were weak, and most of them could only stay on the 14th floor. They didn't even have the strength to fight for the seats. How could they resist a powerful warrior like Maurice?</p>

  <p>Some of the human top-level war lords threw glances at the Demon Night for help. However, the Demon Night wasn't even able to protect themselves in this situation, so they couldn't help the humans. Elder Mei and the other members of the Demon Night pretended not to see the human seat owners' pleading eyes.</p>

  <p>"Maurice, you disregard the rules of the Tower of Sin. How could you kill someone here?" a top-level human war lord said angrily, gritting his teeth.</p>

  <p>Maurice laughed coldly. "Rules? Let me tell you, there have never been rules in the Tower of Sin. The law of the jungle is the only rule here! And from now on, I'm the ruler!"</p>

  <p>With that, Maurice took another step forward and punched the human war lord who had spoken to him.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The human war lord flew back and hit the wall like a sandbag, leaving streaks of blood everywhere.</p>

  <p>The other human top-level war lords felt their anger rise. The life vitality on their bodies started shimmering. As top-level war lords, they didn't want to sit still and wait for death anymore! Just as the humans were preparing to make their move, the bodies of the ogre top-level war lords behind Maurice also began to glow with forceful energy. A chaotic battle was about to break out.</p>

  <p>Determination flashed across the faces of the human top-level war lords.</p>

  <p>They knew very well that they were no match for Maurice, but they no longer had any choice. They had to kill the ogres, or they would be killed.</p>

  <p>"Since you all refuse to take your own lives, my clansmen will kill you!" A bloodthirsty expression appeared on Maurice's face. Today, he was determined to kill all of the humans in the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>When Elder Mei heard Maurice's words, she spoke to a nearby member through her life vitality. "Lead all the humans on the first to the fourteenth floors to the Cursed Land."</p>

  <p>It was absolutely safe in the Cursed Land. This was the only thing Elder Mei could do to help the humans now.</p>

  <p>The warriors sent to the Tower of Sin were all the talents of various sacred places, and the weakest ones were human-level talents. The human warriors in the tower were the future hope of the Purple Heart Sacred Place. Killing them was equivalent to killing the future hope of the humans' sacred place.</p>

  <p>Elder Mei couldn't save the top-level war lords now. However, she could lead the other human war generals, and fighters out of the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>Anyway, the Demon Night and the humans were still in an alliance, so even if Luo Zheng was dead, Elder Mei would still have to help Xun.</p>

  <p>The truth was, the humans in the Tower of Sin were much smarter than Elder Mei was giving them credit for. Other than a small number of human warriors who were cultivating in training rooms, many humans had already left the tower one after another.</p>

  <p>When Maurice had led his race all the way up to the top of the Tower of Sin at such an astonishing momentum, all the human warriors in the tower had noticed it and easily assessed the situation.</p>
