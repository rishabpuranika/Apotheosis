<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>A frown couldn't help but form on Edna's face. 'Who is this woman? How dare she talk to the Creator like that?' she thought.</p>

  <p>Although she had a lot of questions in her mind, she didn't dare ask any of them in front of the "Creator".</p>

  <p>Since the Creator had said that he would set up an array, she immediately stepped away. She had left the Creator's inner world as a free body, but it might not be easy for her husband to do so.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Xi Youqin had also stepped back after she had heard Luo Zheng's explanation. However, she remained vigilant.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng then busied himself in arranging the array in the independent courtyard house.</p>

  <p>The array for creating an Inner-world Generating Avatar wasn't difficult to master. It involved using a special method to refine the inner world creature into a "puppet." Of course, such a puppet was different from ordinary puppets.</p>

  <p>Now, the Evil God would have his own free will most of the time, but Luo Zheng could take over the Evil God's body for as long as he wanted.</p>

  <p>It took an hour for Luo Zheng to set up the array. After it was done, he drew out the Evil God from his inner world once again.</p>

  <p>As soon as the Evil God emerged from Luo Zheng's inner world, the array immediately trapped him and simultaneously released a white beam of light. The ray of white light pierced through Luo Zheng's head, then went straight towards the Evil God's forehead.</p>

  <p>Both of their consciousnesses were connected, and they could both feel each other's existence.</p>

  <p>However, their statuses were different from each other: Luo Zheng was the primary, and the Evil God was the secondary.</p>

  <p>The array continued to flash for nearly an hour. When it slowly became dim, the Inner-world Generating Avatar was finally completed.</p>

  <p>"Honey!" Edna exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Just as she was about to approach the Evil God, her husband suddenly stretched out his hand and stopped her.</p>

  <p>Naturally, she was surprised. Although the man in front of her was indeed her husband, his behavior, expression, and aura were all completely different. At that moment, the Evil God had clearer eyes and wore an aloof expression, which was more similar to the "Creator."</p>

  <p>Indeed, Luo Zheng was the one who currently occupied the Evil God's body. He had suppressed the Evil God's own will and had absolute control over the avatar.</p>

  <p>As the Evil God's eyes closed and opened again, Luo Zheng's consciousness left his body. The Evil God's own consciousness returned, from which a faint trace of evil aura had spread out. He stretched out his hand and held Edna, who stood not far away, into his arms.</p>

  <p>She knew that this was her husband now.</p>

  <p>The Evil God looked around and then asked, "Where am I?"</p>

  <p>"The Heart Flow Sect in the Taiyi Mountain under the Taiyi Heaven Palace," Luo Zheng answered.</p>

  <p>The Evil God's eyes wandered around the independent courtyard house.</p>

  <p>He had once struggled in life in the Source World, and he knew that it was a much more awful place than Luo Zheng's inner world. Therefore, it was clear that he did not think about things in the same way as Edna, who thought that the outside world was wonderful and that Luo Zheng was a very powerful man.</p>

  <p>"You're indeed well treated in the Taiyi Heaven Palace," said the Evil God.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, his previous situation in the Black Mountain Guild was countless times worse. He always had to be on guard even when he cultivated, in case he was suddenly attacked.</p>

  <p>"If you want such kind of treatment, you have to strive for it yourself," Luo Zheng said as he pointed at the main door of the independent courtyard house with his mouth.</p>

  <p>As of the moment, the Evil God was still an "unregistered" person in the Source World. However, with his current strength, it was inappropriate for him to stay in the Dragon City for a while and then climb the Taiyi Mountain.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Luo Zheng personally spoke to the leaders. Then the Heart Flow Sect accepted the Evil God as a member and arranged him a building to stay in.</p>

  <p>However, the Evil God stayed in the building for only three days.</p>

  <p>Three days later, the Flow Tower was opened.</p>

  <p>The Evil God performed amazingly in the Flow Tower. Although he didn't break Luo Zheng's record, he still defeated all the others effortlessly. Eventually, he was also given an independent courtyard house just like Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>When Trish and Carrie had heard of the news, they couldn't help but be shocked. A powerful talent like their young master was already quite rare, but now a creature from his inner world turned out to be that strong. They didn't understand how such a thing could be possible.</p>

  <p>Yet, Luo Zheng didn't bother to explain things to them because he was busy refining the Chaotic Source Spirits for the Evil God.</p>

  <p>In reality, it was beyond his abilities to set up that kind of array. He could only turn to Qiu Yinhe for advice, but the latter was absent and nowhere to be found.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the entire Taiyi Heaven Palace had been rather tense ever since Ying of the Origin Mountain was trapped on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>After all, Ying was the second most powerful figure in the Taiyi Heaven Palace. As long as she was trapped on the Other Shore, it was like the Taiyi Heaven Palace had lost a powerful hand.</p>

  <p>What made things worse was that the incident had put the Taiyi Heaven Palace in danger. Now that someone had actually laid a finger on Ying, it was obvious that whoever did so could also do the same to the Taiyi Heaven Palace itself.</p>

  <p>All the arrays in the seven mountains of the Bloom Divine Province were activated. The channels to all the passes, transmission arrays, and boundary walls all increased their security. The Taiyi Guards who had been staying in the Dragon City were sent out, as if they would face a formidable enemy.</p>

  <p>Despite that, Luo Zheng did not notice such changes for he had stayed in the Heart Flow Sect. In addition to those changes, even Qiu Yinhe had also been busy running around arranging the Taiyi Heaven Palace's defenses.</p>

  <p>He didn't return to the Heart Flow Sect until a week later.</p>

  <p>Still, he was not surprised when he heard that Luo Zheng wanted an array to refine the Chaotic Source Spirits. He had witnessed Luo Zheng previously obtain a considerable number of Chaotic Source Spirits outside the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>Thus, he granted Luo Zheng's request without hesitation. The arrays in the Chaotic Source World had many functions, and refining the Chaotic Source Spirits seemed to be the simplest use.</p>

  <p>A few days later, three masters from the Unique Array Sword Sect personally set up an array in the Evil God's independent courtyard house.</p>

  <p>Then, the Evil God went inside the array and refined the Chaotic Source Spirits, entering the Chaotic Source Realm.</p>

  <p>Since he had already entered the Chaotic Source Realm, he became qualified to enter the Land of Sword Grief. On the next day, Luo Zheng urged Xi Youqin to take good care of herself and ordered Trish and Carrie to look after her well. After that, he went down the mountain with the Evil God and headed straight for the Land of Sword Grief.</p>

  <p>The new disciples at the Chaotic Source Realm, including Chaim, were startled when they saw the Evil God.</p>

  <p>Even though they knew that Luo Zheng had subdued him, they honestly thought that Luo Zheng should dispose of him. Much to their surprise, the Evil God actually followed behind Luo Zheng. He had even entered the Chaotic Source Realm!</p>

  <p>In their world, there was probably only one person who was able to help the Evil God enter the Chaotic Source Realm, and that was Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>When they saw the Evil God closely follow behind Luo Zheng obediently, however, Chaim and the other experienced and knowledgeable warriors quickly realized that the Evil God in front of them seemed to have become an Inner-world Generating Avatar.</p>

  <p>"Go find Abdul and ask him to arrange a secluded cultivation room for you," Luo Zheng said to the Evil God.</p>

  <p>The Evil God never liked it when others ordered him to do things. He seldom obeyed even the extremely powerful warriors in the Black Ship.</p>

  <p>Even Shera had to butter him up most of the time just to make him comply.</p>

  <p>So when he heard Luo Zheng's order, he couldn't help but frown, but he tried his best to suppress his inner impulse to resist.</p>

  <p>That was because he did not forget his identity. It was just that he was now a puppet, though he could think.</p>

  <p>In the end, he simply nodded and went away to look for Abdul as Luo Zheng had instructed.</p>

  <p>It wasn't until Chaim saw the Evil God leave that he asked Luo Zheng, "Luo Zheng, did you know that many things have happened to the Taiyi Heaven Palace recently?"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Luo Zheng asked curiously. He did not know of those things because he had been preoccupied with taking care of Xi Youqin in the Heart Flow Sect.</p>

  <p>The disciples in the Land of Sword Grief were all elites from the seven mountains. Therefore, if anything happened to the Taiyi Heaven Palace, the news would spread to the Land of Sword Grief.</p>

  <p>Chaim then told Luo Zheng all of the current events one by one, including Ying being trapped on the Other Shore and the Jin Wu causing trouble in the Mountain Viewing Province.</p>

  <p>With each piece of passing news that Chaim narrated, Luo Zheng's brows furrowed more and more tightly.</p>

  <p>Somewhere else at the same time, Abdul and a few other senior disciples observed the Evil God with cautious eyes.</p>

  <p>Of course, they knew that the Evil God was a disciple who had just entered the Chaotic Source Realm while his Soul of Light was still on Stage Thirteen of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Therefore, they wondered why he joined the Land of Sword Grief at this time.</p>
