<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1567 Explosive Ferocious Ant (Part One) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Aurora walked to the side, but she was quietly looking Luo Luo Zheng over from head to toe.</p>

  <p>It wasn't just her. The other warriors of the Demon Night, such as Vivian, were also reconsidering Luo Luo Zheng. He was not quite what they had expected.</p>

  <p>However, there was a hint more than curiosity in Aurora's eyes.</p>

  <p>He said that he would kill Yao within three years. She thought this fellow was truly interesting! However, she was still mystified as to how he would manage to reach this step. She wanted to ask Amber about it when she had more time.</p>

  <p>After chatting for a while, Amber had calmed down and her heart took up a more normal rhythm.</p>

  <p>At the very least, her decision to enter the Illusion Battlefield had proven correct.</p>

  <p>Next, Aurora once again took charge of the group and they all stepped on the plate at the end of the tree branch.</p>

  <p>When the scribbled golden words needed to break the spell, once more appeared under everyone's feet, they began to ascend yet again. Not long after, they arrived at the eighth branch of the Sacred Ailanthus.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng landed on the eighth tree branch, he immediately saw that it was filled with giant ants!</p>

  <p>There were a lot of tall spikes on the bodies of these vicious ants. Their shells were red, and there were flames dancing in their slightly translucent bellies, making them look like big lanterns. If it weren't so dangerous, it would have been a comical scene to witness.</p>

  <p>"The Explosive Ferocious Ant. Once each of these ants are killed, there will be a violent explosion. It would be best for everyone to spread out a bit," Aurora ordered. She had wandered through the Sacred Ailanthus three times before, so she naturally knew every single one of these vicious creatures like the back of her hand. The others all heeded her instruction and spread out cautiously.</p>

  <p>Previously, when Luo Luo Zheng, Vivian, and the others had rushed after them all the way here, Aurora had killed off all of the vicious beasts in advance.</p>

  <p>Now, they were going to have to kill them together, all the way up from the eighth tree branch.</p>

  <p>"However, the defensive capabilities of these Explosive Ferocious Ants aren't strong. If you are careful when killing them, you can pass through!</p>

  <p>Just remember the explosions that follow!" As she spoke, she once again held up the black tree in her hand. Immediately, the leaves on the tree began to fall off, turning into a rain of leaves that swept towards the ants!</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Each leaf was comparable to a concealed weapon. They seemed harmless enough at first, but then they began to cut into anything in their path.</p>

  <p>The fallen leaves seemed to float freely, but under Aurora's control, they were targeted in their approach and exceptionally sharp!</p>

  <p>It was almost impossible to avoid the falling leaves as they descended on the Explosive Ferocious Ants. They easily cut into the ants' bodies. The carapace of a nearby Explosive Ferocious Ant was soon riddled with holes from the cutting swarm!</p>

  <p>As the two feelers on the head of the Explosive Ferocious Ant began shaking crazily, the flames in its stomach also became brighter. Its six legs crawled crazily along the ground as it charged straight at Aurora!</p>

  <p>"Watch out for this ant!"</p>

  <p>Just as Aurora finished speaking, she rapidly retreated. In the instant that she retreated, the light in the Explosive Ferocious Ant's belly had already flickered and reached an incandescence which exceeded the natural limits!</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Following the sound of the intense explosion, a powerful shockwave spread out in a flash of fire!</p>

  <p>The smell of charred flesh filled the air, and a mushroom cloud expanded to a diameter of several hundred feet, which slowly rose up.</p>

  <p>The ignition power of this Explosive Ferocious Ant was truly terrifying.</p>

  <p>If an ordinary martial artist did not know that the ant would explode, they would be blasted into smithereens and immediately reduced to ashes.</p>

  <p>Even though Luo Zheng's body was extremely tough and fortified, he would still have suffered severe injuries if he had been dragged into this!</p>

  <p>However, the Explosive Ferocious Ant itself was not difficult to deal with. They could easily be cut down, or killed with bow and arrow.</p>

  <p>After killing one of the Explosive Ferocious Ants, Aurora turned back.</p>

  <p>Her eyes fixed on Luo Luo Zheng as she smiled and said to all of them, "That's it. It won't be difficult to deal with them, as long as you attack them carefully.</p>

  <p>Keep your eyes open and watch for any that try to sneak closer."</p>

  <p>What she had just done was merely a demonstration for them.</p>

  <p>However, even after Aurora had shown the way to kill the ants, Amber, Vivian, and the rest of the warriors of the Demon Night all looked at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>'What are they all looking at me for?'</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng blinked his eyes rapidly in confusion as he thought about their strange behavior, but in his heart he knew what they were waiting for.</p>

  <p>He realized that they wanted to watch him take action, and see how powerful he was.</p>

  <p>"I'll give it a try then!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled as he leaped up and immediately rushed forward. However, he did not attack when he brushed past the nearest Explosive Ferocious Ant. Instead, he gently tapped the Explosive Ferocious Ant on its back with the tip of his foot and charged forward once again, with his clothes fluttering in the wind!</p>

  <p>Being stepped on by Luo Luo Zheng, the first Explosive Ferocious Ant crawled at an extremely fast speed and chased after him.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng ignored it and continued running forward!</p>

  <p>Tap!</p>

  <p>With a flip, he brushed close by another Explosive Ferocious Ant.</p>

  <p>Thus, there were two Explosive Ferocious Ants now chasing after Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The other members of the group grew uncomfortable at the sight of Luo Luo Zheng being chased after by these dangerous creatures. If one of them exploded....</p>

  <p>"What is Luo Luo Zheng doing?"</p>

  <p>"He wants to gather the Explosive Ferocious Ants together!"</p>

  <p>"He must be crazy!"</p>

  <p>Witnessing this scene, the warriors of the Demon Night couldn't help being worried about him. It seemed like a suicide mission that Luo Luo Zheng was embarking on.</p>
