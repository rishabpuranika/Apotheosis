<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2703 Unexpected Discovery (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The old man thought for a moment and his eyes lit up as they settled on Zheng. "Friend... no... Sir! Our Cyan Tree Clan have an enemy that would attack us. I can hand over all the savings of our clan over the years to you and I hope that you'll help us resist our enemy!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's brows furrowed at the words.</p>

  <p>He just wanted to absorb the complete internal momentum and light up the Godly Way Tablets in his mind. He didn't plan to stay for a long time.</p>

  <p>If, for example, he agreed and got involved in the fight between the two clans, he didn't know how long the conflict would last and how long he would be delayed in his journey.</p>

  <p>"Are the two Godly Way Tablets controlled by your clan?" Zheng directed his question to the old man.</p>

  <p>"Yes! We've controlled these two Godly Way Tablets for many divine eras-"</p>

  <p>Before the old man could finish speaking, Zheng took out a hundred divine might coins and hurriedly handed them over with a shake of his head. "I-I'm sorry... but... but I just wanted to use the two Godly Way Tablets for a while. I can't do anything else."</p>

  <p>Once the divine might coins were in the old man's hands, Zheng's figure flashed and appeared between the two Godly Way Tablets in the next blink.</p>

  <p>The old man held the divine might coins close to his chest with a bitter and disappointed face. They didn't need divine might coins but a powerful master who could protect them.</p>

  <p>There was nothing else the old man could do but helplessly take out a healing pill and bitterly swallow it down. "Everyone, please heal yourself as soon as possible. Since this person wasn't sent by the Mo Clan, we may still have a chance to fight!"</p>

  <p>The rest of the top-rank True Gods dragged themselves up from the ground, wiping away their blood, and began to heal themselves.</p>

  <p>They were lucky that Zheng held back his strength in the fight and only bumped against them with controlled brute force so that their injuries wouldn't be serious.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Across from them on the other side, Zheng settled down in front of the Life Godly Way Tablet.</p>

  <p>As the Infinity Ruler in his mind glowed, the golden pupils of his eyes began to absorb the complete internal momentum of the Life Godly Way, On the other side of the grassland, over a thousand True Gods appeared and rushed over. They all suddenly darted to the Godly Way Tablets.</p>

  <p>Zheng turned back and let his gaze sweep over the group he knew to be from the Mo Clan.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't want to get involved in the fight between the two clans when he didn't know who was in the right or in the wrong. He just turned away and ignored them to focus on absorbing the internal momentum.</p>

  <p>"Old man! We suggest you give up the Godly Way Tablets as soon as possible. This is for your own good. If you don't have the strength but still want to keep them as yours, that's just biting off more than you can chew!" The man who led the Mo Clan and wore golden armor while carrying a black spear on his shoulder had a booming voice, but his mocking laughter was even louder.</p>

  <p>Hallam Mo was the current master of the Mo Clan and viewed the two Godly Way Tablets as an important step so that he could achieve his grand ambitions of leading the Mo Clan to rise to power.</p>

  <p>He made sure to prepare well this time!</p>

  <p>The words barely left his mouth when he noticed Zheng and his eyes narrowed in on him immediately.</p>

  <p>A consummate True God!</p>

  <p>The one thousand aggressive True Gods from the Mo Clan suddenly hesitated when they noticed where their leader was looking.</p>

  <p>"Hallam! You said they only had nine top-rank True Gods, so I agreed to help. I don't want to fight a consummate True God." A sullen man clad in black spoke from behind Hallam Mo.</p>

  <p>Although Lathrop He was also a consummate True God, he wasn't from the Floating Island of a powerful clan.</p>

  <p>His strength was far inferior to other consummate True Gods who came from powerful clans on the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>There were few consummate True Gods in the divine land so Lathrop He could still do whatever he wanted in the divine land even if he was weaker than the others.</p>

  <p>The Mo Clan had already paid a heavy price to ask him to fight but he wasn't willing to make an enemy of another consummate True God.</p>

  <p>The surprised Hallam Mo looked at Zheng in doubt and noticed that he was focused on comprehending the Godly Way Tablets. Hallam Mo's eyes lit up in glee as he spoke, "Don't worry. That isn't someone the Cyan Tree Clan hired. We only need to deal with the members of the Cyan Tree Clan!"</p>

  <p>"That's fine but I have to warn you. If that young man interferes, I will immediately leave!" Lathrop He flatly spoke his reminder.</p>

  <p>"Okay, okay..." Hallam Mo nervously agreed as he looked at Zheng.</p>

  <p>"That's good!"</p>

  <p>Lathrop He sneered and then clapped his hands to make an invisible stream of internal momentum spread out.</p>

  <p>Behind him, thirteen top-rank True Gods flew up in the air.</p>

  <p>These top-rank True Gods were like puppets with emotionless eyes that stared at nothing and saw nothing, but they were all real humans.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Zheng had already completely absorbed the internal momentum of the Life Godly Way and was about to start on the internal momentum of the Cyan Wood Godly Way.</p>

  <p>But he paused in his actions as he was attracted by Lathrop He's internal momentum.</p>

  <p>"Great Dominance Technique?" Zheng's eyebrows rose.</p>

  <p>When Zheng swept his gaze across the crowd, his eyes darkened and his expression hardened as he fixed his focus on one of them.</p>
