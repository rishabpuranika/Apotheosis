<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As two disciples from Dylan's family were eliminated from the test, his eyes blazed with anger, and he was fuming. Fang Clan had sent four disciples to participate in the?blooded test. Three were from offshoot branches and were?not as strong. However, one of them was Dylan's immediate family and the third son of the family's leader. His name was?</p>

  <p>Ryan Fang, and he was a mighty, talented?young man.</p>

  <p>Dylan gave his word to the clan that all four would pass the test. Now, two were cut from the ranks. He waited impatiently. He connected to Ryan's disciple card via the Picture Slab, and without hesitation, he called out, sending his voice over the slab.</p>

  <p>According to the blooded test rules, this was a violation. However, Dylan didn't care about anything.</p>

  <p>"Ryan, Noah and Peace were eliminated from the blooded test! Someone did that to them!" Dylan said in a low but passionate voice over the Picture Slab to Ryan.</p>

  <p>"What did you say? Who dared to do that to my people?" Ryan?replied as he ran swiftly on the third layer of the magic array. Behind him, six three-grade unreal beasts were chasing him. But he didn't rush in confusion. He didn't frown, and instead, he started chatting with Dylan.</p>

  <p>"It was some guy named  Luo Zheng Luo! Do you know him? He just doesn't quit!</p>

  <p>He dared to touch Noah and Peace," stated Dylan, as he ground his teeth.</p>

  <p>He was so angry because Noah was his nephew, and in his immense family, was the closest to him. Dylan treated him as a son.</p>

  <p>Comparatively, Ryan?was a direct line of descent. But, he was not that close to Dylan or other branches.</p>

  <p>"I know him, where is he now?" asked Ryan coldly.</p>

  <p>That was what Dylan wanted. He said smirking, "I will give you his location. He is still on the second layer!" Although Dylan couldn't see Luo Zheng, it was easy to check his location.</p>

  <p>"Alright then, I will kill him after I deal with these imaginary beasts behind me," said Ryan in an unusually bitter voice. In fact, in Ryan's heart, it wasn't a big deal that the stupid cowards from his family were kicked out of the game. It simply meant they were not eligible to enter the Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>But since these stupid cowards?were also members of his family, anyone who dared to cause harm must pay the price.</p>

  <p>"Ryan, the guy is good at fighting, so, if you are not able to beat him down, consider swallowing the Mystical Pill!" suggested Dylan.</p>

  <p>Fang Clan, was well known for refining pills with many famous alchemists in the family. The Mystical Pill was a pill worth a city. It could raise someone's range to a higher level in a short time, and greatly enhance their strength in a critical moment.</p>

  <p>However, this pill could only be used if the person was below the nature level, and it was challenging to create. That was why Ryan?received just the one.</p>

  <p>"Uncle Dylan, are you doubting me?" asked Ryan in a cold tone. He was the son of the head of the family. Even though Dylan was a tutor at the Cloud Sect, his status in the family was nothing compared with Ryan's and as such, Ryan didn't hold much respect for Dylan.</p>

  <p>As Ryan finished speaking, he?sped up. Dylan watched as Ryan's body flew up to the left and twisted twice in the air as he nimbly clutched a short dagger, pulling a bright blue line from it.</p>

  <p>As they touched the azure line, the beasts?chasing him, were all cut in two, changing first into dimming lights as they slowly dissipated in the air.</p>

  <p>Soon, Ryan had killed six three-grade?unreal beasts.</p>

  <p>Watching from his Picture Slab, Dylan's heart sank, as he soon realized how wrong he was. Ryan held tremendous power, and he surely had limitless prospects. This was someone he needed to please. So, softening his smile, Dylan said in a flattering manner, "No, that isn't what I meant. Maybe, I worry too much, you have superior strength and are unbeatable in Bloody Mountain. I have sent you Zheng's location. Check it now."</p>

  <p>When Dylan was finished, Ryan's expression went blank. He turned and walked in the direction that Dylan directed.</p>

  <p>At that point, Luo Zheng was continuing going deeper into Bloody Mountain, having killed two second-grade?unreal beasts. Able to have a small break from battling, he breathed a sigh of relief. He was exhausted, but, within moments, he heard an unnatural laugh and his face contorted.</p>

  <p>There, standing in front of him, were twenty disciples from noble clans.</p>

  <p>They had set up a tollbooth, and anyone who wanted to get through was forced to hand over all their?crystal fragments.</p>

  <p>The first thought came into Zheng's mind was 'These stupid guys are surely crazy' and it was evident, there wasn't going to be even a small break.</p>
