<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Even though he was giving an account of this story directly to the mysterious girl, the living beings in the universe had no way to steer clear of the sound of the Roaring Token. For that reason, trillions of lives were forced to listen in on his story.</p>

  <p>It was the first time that a man was heard telling a story to all living beings in the universe.</p>

  <p>Zheng read it aloud part by part based from his memory. In dribs and drabs, his attention became riveted on the story.</p>

  <p>In all sincerity, this story was indeed truly captivating.</p>

  <p>It was about the tale of a woman from the State of Yue whose husband had been falsely incriminated by a traitor. Because of that, she made an oath to make the culprit pay at all costs. The chain of events kept a lot of the listeners on the edge of their seat.</p>

  <p>Zheng had been at it for two hours already without stopping, yet he had barely even covered half of the overall story.</p>

  <p>"The woman's sword attack brought about a series of events..."</p>

  <p>At this point in the story, it had come to its most crucial juncture.</p>

  <p>Every creature that could breathe in the universe were idly listening to Zheng's supposedly gripping story. But because of the varying cultures and languages all over the universe, there were bound to be a few of those who might not have the faintest idea what he was blabbering about.</p>

  <p>Be that as it might, a great deal of creatures had been listening to it attentively. And it wasn't just the ordinary mortals, but even Soul Sea Realm warriors, world lords, and even a number of Supreme Lords who had been pricking their ears, tuning in to Zheng's story.</p>

  <p>When he finally stopped talking, the entire universe felt as though it had reached a moment of tranquility.</p>

  <p>One thing he had no way of knowing was that the moment he stopped, numerous creatures of the supreme worlds started uttering profanities left and right!</p>

  <p>"Fucking hell! That bonehead stopped right in the middle of the story.</p>

  <p>You've gotta be kidding me!"</p>

  <p>"Either you never bothered starting it, or you continue it till the end!</p>

  <p>What the hell is this?"</p>

  <p>"I don't have any Roaring Tokens, but if I did, I would certainly call this guy some bad names!"</p>

  <p>"It's just a false pretense of an otherwise legendary story. Is there a real need for you to get so worked up about it?"</p>

  <p>The reason why Zheng had stopped all of a sudden wasn't really because he could not continue anymore. It just so happened that Freya had left the library and was heading towards him to get some advice on a few things regarding cultivation.</p>

  <p>Thank heavens, the mysterious girl was surprisingly very patient and didn't put the screws on him.</p>

  <p>However, after a while, another voice from the universe resounded out of the blue. "What happened next? Tell me, what happened to the woman's sword?"</p>

  <p>This voice belonged to a Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>They had barely heard about half of the story. Even so, this Supreme Lord became so engrossed in it that he resorted to using the Roaring Token just to ask Zheng.</p>

  <p>Any way you looked at it, a Supreme Lord was originally a mortal. They had not yet reached the True God level. Despite their mental states being much stronger as opposed to that of a normal martial artist's, the twists and turns of this story still somehow managed to tug at their heartstrings.</p>

  <p>The minute he heard this Supreme Lord's query, Zheng was left utterly dumbfounded. Only then did he finally realize that apart from the mysterious girl, there were countless others who had been listening to his story. As a smile crept onto his face, Zheng simply replied, "Just wait a moment, I'll continue the story later."</p>

  <p>"Can't you do it sooner? Don't just stop at such a crucial part! You're leaving me hanging!" One more Supreme Lord used the Roaring Token to urge him to continue telling the story without delay.</p>

  <p>"Why are you dawdling?" The voices of several Supreme Lords echoed all over the universe. They actually ended up taking turns trying to urge him to continue.</p>

  <p>"Why are you pressing him? I'm the only one Zheng's supposed to be telling the story to. As far as I'm concerned, he's free to continue any time he wants. Why are you kicking up a stink?" The mysterious girl, on the other hand, sounded off on Zheng's behalf.</p>

  <p>In truth, Zheng couldn't care less about these Supreme Lords urging him to go on. He leisurely talked with Freya about a few things. And after about an hour, he raised the Roaring Token once again.</p>

  <p>"Now I'm ready to continue where we left off. After that unforeseeable event which had befallen her husband, she didn't give a damn about her own life anymore..."</p>

  <p>The rest of the story was narrated for six hours straight. When it finally got to the exceedingly tragic but beautiful scene, even Zheng himself couldn't help but feel touched deep inside. It was quite possible that the cultivation base and strength of the martial artists of the great world weren't strong enough, but whoever it was who managed to put out such a compelling story without a doubt possessed great talent.</p>

  <p>By the time the story finally reached its conclusion, the mysterious girl could clearly be heard weeping. As it turned out, she was actually moved by the final plot of the story. And it should go without saying that she wasn't the only one who felt that way. Truth be told, a lot of creatures who had been paying close attention to the story felt so touched as well, but it was just that they didn't have a Roaring Token to cry their hearts out.</p>
