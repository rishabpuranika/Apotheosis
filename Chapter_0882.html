<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 882 The Head-to-head Battle (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>For that reason, it was relatively easier for Luo Zheng to deal with this second-level war lord than to fight against Boris.</p>

  <p>Despite this, if he somehow faced a war lord from the sacred place, Luo Zheng reckoned that he could at most only defeat a second-level war lord or a third-level war lord. If it ever so happened that he encountered a fourth-level war lord or a war lord with a much higher level, he had to try his best to dodge and even flee the match. After all, his cultivation base was far lower than theirs.</p>

  <p>In the end, this was also the reason as to why Luo Zheng did not choose to advance into the next floor. On the eleventh floor of the Tower of Sin, Luo Zheng could indeed earn more points, but he would also have to face some war lords he could not easily defeat.</p>

  <p>There might be even more chances to acquire Lucky Light on the eleventh floor, but the risk was too high for Luo Zheng. After all, the amount of Lucky Light was just a bit larger than that of the tenth floor. Therefore, it was a wiser decision for Luo Zheng to accumulate it on his current floor. Moreover, he could gather the Lucky Light in an easier way if he had stayed, without facing any unpredictable and formidable war lords.</p>

  <p>Hearing the discussions of the audience while he was still fighting with Luo Zheng, the orc war lord could not believe his ears when he realized that they were resolute on the notion that he could not be a match for the first-level war general. The orcs had always been those kind of creatures that always had a fiery temper, so it was understandable that he was now completely livid at the fact that they were underestimating his capabilities.</p>

  <p>In a flash, the orc war lord's eyes glowed red and layers upon layers of forceful energy wrapped around his battle axe. At the same time, what appeared to look like dense red lights were discharged from his fists!</p>

  <p>With a gasp, a warrior from the audience exclaimed, "It's absolute madness!</p>

  <p>This orc war lord has been utterly infuriated!"</p>

  <p>"Once the orcs go berserk with madness, they would keep on attacking until their opponents are killed!"</p>

  <p>"Don't you know that the orcs are all brainless?" one of the spectators noted before continuing. "If they are wise enough, their strength would definitely not be weaker than that of the ogres!" he pointed out, waving his hand towards the orc in the arena.</p>

  <p>Truthfully, many of the creatures who were situated in the spectator stands had made correct judgments.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, the orc managed to rank fourth on the Sea God Continent.</p>

  <p>Needless to say, the orcs' talent was not inferior to that of ogres— they were only a lot smaller than the ogres, but had a miraculous recovery ability.</p>

  <p>Moreover, their speed was not the least bit secondary to the ogres, and when it came to bodily movement speed, they were only second to the Demon Night members.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, their seemingly great strengths were rivaled with their ultimate fatal flaw: they were brainless and their intelligence was undeniably low. This was to say they were easily angered and were consequently, easy to provoke and take advantage of. It was almost laughable.</p>

  <p>After the orcs went berserk and were driven to madness, their strength did increase twice-fold, but the weakness of this powerful madness was obvious. Once their madness mode was activated, none of them would be able to control themselves, as they mainly operated on instinct and fury.</p>

  <p>However, this state only continued until their target was already dead, or they themselves died.</p>

  <p>As he glanced between the two red lights emitted from the orc war lord's fists, Luo Zheng briefly frowned and his expression was schooled into one of seriousness. Even if this independent war lord's strength was not powerful enough, he was still a war lord through and through. Truthfully, the gap between Zheng's cultivation and the war lord's was considerably large, so it could not be completely ignored.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell! Aooo!"</p>

  <p>Once again, the orc war lord let out a beast-like howl and dashed towards Luo Zheng like a rolling boulder.</p>

  <p>This time, Luo Zheng did not choose to evade the attack like he previously did.</p>

  <p>Instead, he unsheathed the long sword in his hand that began to radiate a faint golden light, spreading endless sword intent.</p>

  <p>"Heaven and Earth Rotating!"</p>

  <p>When the distance between the orc war lord and Luo Zheng narrowed to ten feet, the orc war lord suddenly began to rotate faster and faster, akin to a spinning top.</p>

  <p>In addition to this, two demonic crimson lights continuously revolved around his bulky arms, which gradually looked like a scarlet wheel of light.</p>

  <p>To everyone's astonishment, when it was paired with the battle axe that was shining with the glow of forceful energy, it appeared to be an exceptionally pleasing visual.</p>

  <p>As long as Luo Zheng was caught in this picturesque "spinning top", the only possible consequence that would happen to him would be his body smashed to smithereens.</p>

  <p>Leaning closer to witness the scene unfolding in front of her very eyes, Olivia never thought that Luo Zheng would actually choose to face the war lord head-on! Despite having believed that Luo Zheng could defeat this war lord, she wondered what Luo Zheng intended to do next after witnessing a fully enraged orc!</p>

  <p>Since Olivia was able to stay in the tenth floor, she had naturally fought with some of the orcs before. Furthermore, even though she had defeated three orc tenth-level war generals, it was not because Olivia's strength was stronger than the orc war generals. It was more of the fortunate circumstance that those orc war generals were stupid even if they did have the amazing ability of recovering faster than normal.</p>

  <p>During the moments of her own fight against orcs, Olivia only needed to constantly dodge their attacks as her strategy was to thoroughly exhaust them until they eventually died on the arena. Even if her opponents managed to activate the madness mode, they would definitely be unable to do anything offensive to the incomparably quick-witted Olivia.</p>

  <p>However, if Olivia decided to conduct a head-to-head battle with an orc war general, she might not even be marginally close to defeating a seventh-level or eighth-level war general by herself, let alone a tenth-level orc war general.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Luo Zheng did not dodge despite the odds stacked against him.</p>

  <p>With a determined mind, he planned to use his top-grade sacred long sword to fight with this orc war lord.</p>
