<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 917 Stopping Fabian </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The terrifying voice sent a chill down the warriors' spines.</p>

  <p>The warriors couldn't help but want to turn around. They didn't want to turn their backs to their enemy, and this was the only thing in their minds.</p>

  <p>However, just as they were about to turn around, Yolande looked on straight ahead, saying coldly, "Don't turn your heads around! Those who do will die!"</p>

  <p>Hearing Yolande's warning, Luo Zheng, who was about to look over his shoulder, immediately turned to look forward.</p>

  <p>Esther, Fabian, Jarrod, and the others did not turn around either, but one of the top-level war lords of the Demon Night had already whirled to get a glimpse of the thing behind them!</p>

  <p>Even though the rest of them did not turn their heads, they could see the expression on the top-level war lord's face.</p>

  <p>The war lord's eyes widened, unflinching, as if he had seen something inconceivable. Astonishment was written all over his face. The war lord wanted to scream, but when he opened his mouth, he found he couldn't do so. Only a faint noise escaped his throat.</p>

  <p>Top-level war lords were creatures that had progressed through every stage of their lives and encountered possible deaths. What had these creatures not seen before? They had seen countless corpses and killed a great number of beings. They had defeated and killed numerous warriors before they could become the powerful war lords that they were.</p>

  <p>However, in that instant, this particular top-level war lord looked scared out of his wits.</p>

  <p>A low whine left his mouth, and very quickly, a strange smile appeared on his face. His eyes started to look glassy, losing their vibrance.</p>

  <p>Crack�</p>

  <p>All too soon, a crack could be seen on the war lord's forehead. It progressively extended downward and very soon, his entire face, as well as the rest of his body, was covered in cracks. He looked like a piece of broken, glazed tile.</p>

  <p>Then his body collapsed with a loud sound, the clothes he wore still neat and undamaged.</p>

  <p>Watching the war lord keel over, Fabian grew frightened and helpless.</p>

  <p>"What the hell is it behind us?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng frowned deeply, the creases of his eyes contracting with caution. His mind was stable and strong, but he still felt he was under a lot of pressure.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. Yolande, what should we do now?" Luo Zheng asked her.</p>

  <p>"Don't look back! Don't turn around, no matter what happens!" Yolande whispered in a warning, seemingly immersed in a strange state.</p>

  <p>Even without Yolande's warning, no one would have dared to turn around now. The top-level war lord of the Demon Night was not weak. Indeed, he was much stronger than Fabian and Jarrod. Still, he had turned around and died horrifyingly, so how could the rest of them have the guts to look back?</p>

  <p>Xun did not turn. She stared straight ahead, her brows scrunching together as if she was mulling over something.</p>

  <p>She was not afraid of any ferocious ghost. Being so powerful, she was able to reach the river of the netherworld and come back. In her eyes, no evil creature was invincible. She only pondered over which one stood behind them and how to defeat it.</p>

  <p>"Hoo, hoo, hoo..."</p>

  <p>In the beginning, the cry sounded from far away, but as time passed, it grew closer and closer to them.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Luo Zheng saw a faint beam of light glowing from behind him.</p>

  <p>"That thing is getting closer," Fabian said with a tremble. He was a brave and dignified top-level war lord. If someone had cut open his stomach, he might not have been so scared as he felt right now. At the moment, his entire body was shaking like a leaf.</p>

  <p>"What the hell is that thing? Yolande, if you know, please tell me..." Jarrod pleaded.</p>

  <p>Yolande's eyes looked glazed over, like she was still engrossed in an otherworldly, meditative state. Still, she kept repeating, "Don't look back.</p>

  <p>Don't turn around!"</p>

  <p>From the corner of their eyes, they could see the light creeping closer to them. The wailing noise grew louder and louder, now sounding as if it was just about ten feet behind them.</p>

  <p>"That terrible thing is here," Fabian kept repeating, gasping with fear. He had stopped trembling, for now the muscles in his body had stiffened.</p>

  <p>Esther also gew increasingly nervous. Her fingertips compressed a ball of life vitality severly. Although she knew that she couldn't turn around, she couldn't give up so easily. Her warrior spirit was also very stable. She would do her best to fight the evil spirit behind them even if she wasn't a match for it.</p>

  <p>The light grew brighter and the sound resonated in the atmosphere.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a number of slender and long tentacles reached out from somewhere behind their backs and attacked them.</p>

  <p>The tentacles seemed tangible, but they were in fact made up of a faint yellow light. They were weightless, and as soon as they touched the faces, necks, and arms of the warriors, it felt like a thin veil had swept over them.</p>

  <p>"Ah! I can't stand it! I'm going to kill it!" Fabian roared, his eyes bloodshot.</p>

  <p>In the face of this unprecedented and terrifying encounter, Fabian was on the verge of collapse. His actions were a bit out of control.</p>

  <p>It was a grim sight. If he continued doing that, Fabian would die without a doubt! Resolving to fight the unknown creature behind him, he moved to turn around.</p>

  <p>Anticipating the danger of it, a sharp, thin thorn zoomed out of Zheng's eyebrow and shot toward Fabian, who was at Zheng's left in the front.</p>

  <p>"Spiritual Thorn!"</p>

  <p>How perceptive was Zheng's soul? Fabian was in a poor mental state and lacked any defensive measures to protect himself. Zheng's Spiritual Thorn successfully pierced through him.</p>

  <p>"Ah!"</p>

  <p>Fabian, who was just about to turn around, let out a blood-curdling screech, covering his head as he fell to his knees.</p>

  <p>Esther was shocked to see it. The soul attack that Luo Zheng had just performed was nothing special to speak of, but she did not underestimate it, however simple it was.</p>

  <p>Zheng's soul, which had just employed the Spiritual Thorn, was not so simple.</p>

  <p>It glowed with a faint jasper color, which meant that it was about to step into the Jasper Fighting Soul Realm. So Zheng's soul was at the Fighting Soul Realm!</p>

  <p>It was no wonder that Esther was surprised. Among the top-level war lords, not one soul had stepped into the Fighting Soul Realm. Even in the case of the war sages, there were only a few warriors' souls that currently belonged to the Fighting Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>But how could Luo Zheng, who was only a ninth-level war general, have already made his soul enter the Fighting Soul Realm? His soul emitted a faint green light. It was obvious that it wasn't long before it entered the Jasper Fighting Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>This was truly incredible...</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had indeed done much to astonish Esther. Perhaps it was time she stopped being so taken aback even though he did something extraordinary.</p>

  <p>Zheng's Spiritual Thorn had saved Fabian's life as it stopped the latter from turning around. Fabian, still kneeling on the ground, hugged his head as he screamed. He didn't get the chance to turn his head and look at the thing behind him.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Yolande seemed to slowly come to her senses. Biting her lip, she said, "That thing is coming over. It's going to be in front of us."</p>

  <p>"What should we do?" Jarrod asked in a hurry.</p>

  <p>"Run," Yolande said shortly.</p>

  <p>"Where do we run?" Esther asked.</p>

  <p>"Run ahead. Just remember, don't turn around," Yolande said, pursing her lips.</p>

  <p>"When do we run?" Luo Zheng asked as he looked sideways at the tentacles continuously encircling him.</p>

  <p>"Now. Let's go!"</p>

  <p>Before she could even finish speaking, Yolande had rushed forward.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Jarrod, Esther, and the other top-level war lords ran after her. The moment Luo Zheng took to his heels, he darted toward Fabian. Reaching out to grab Fabian's collar, he intended to drag him along.</p>

  <p>Fabian's soul had been pierced by Luo Zheng. All he felt was a sharp pain and was unable to acknowledge the situation he was in. Luo Zheng couldn't just leave him alone here to die. Fortunately, he was strong enough to take Fabian along with him.</p>

  <p>As they ran, the sound behind them suddenly turned shrill.</p>

  <p>"Hoo..."</p>

  <p>They could hear the thing following them and moving rather quickly.</p>

  <p>Everyone had calmed down a bit by now. They thought that as long as they didn't turn around, they wouldn't die miserable deaths. However, if they continued to run like this, how could they rid themselves of that thing?</p>

  <p>"What should we do now, Yolande?" Luo Zheng shouted over.</p>

  <p>Yolande was ten feet above the ground and sprinting wholeheartedly. "Wait for me to handle it!" she replied back.</p>

  <p>"How long do we have to wait?" Esther asked her.</p>

  <p>Yolande just said, "I don't know."</p>
