<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1108 A Genuine Phoenix Descendant </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>War King Wind and Turner along with the mighty warriors at the Soul Sea Realm were all observing this spectacle.</p>

  <p>Without the use of the Time Law, the speed difference between Fiona and Zheng was huge.</p>

  <p>But the main thing to note was that while Fiona had the advantage of speed, she wasn't able to deal with Zheng. His body was just too strong. He was simply too domineering.</p>

  <p>As long as he continued to resist, his comprehension of the Time Law would become increasingly better. In the end, Fiona would be the one to lose.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no!" said a distressed Fiona. She could feel the change in Zheng's speed. He was getting faster and faster.</p>

  <p>Overall, he was still four times slower than her, but the gap was rapidly shrinking.</p>

  <p>She didn't want to lose to Zheng; she really didn't want to! So after attacking him with her palm, she didn't attack again. Instead, her slim and graceful body floated to a corner of the enchanted barrier. "Tianxing, give up," she called to Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Why?" Zheng had no idea what this little girl was thinking, but he was probably used to it.</p>

  <p>It takes all kinds of people to make the world. Two people's personalities can be completely different. Zheng learned this principle from Margaret's character.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to use fire. If you can't block this move, I'm afraid you'll die,"</p>

  <p>Fiona said earnestly.</p>

  <p>"Fire?" Zheng raised his eyebrows slightly.</p>

  <p>His primordial energy had been accumulating in his body ever since he had refined his body last time. Now it was time for him to refine his body again and advance it to the next level.</p>

  <p>However, all this time, Zheng had been unable to find a suitable fire source.</p>

  <p>Zheng himself didn't know what kind of fire source would be able to help him advance to the next level, but the stronger his body became, the more powerful the fire source he would need.</p>

  <p>He did possess a powerful fire source. It was the black flame within the mysterious furnace. But the black flame was far too overbearing. He did not dare to try it out rashly.</p>

  <p>Fiona was proficient in not only Time Law but also Fire Law. If Zheng could borrow the power of her flames to help his body become a sacred weapon, it would be great.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Fiona nodded. "So you should give up. Don't force me to use it. I can't knock you out right now, and your speed of comprehending the Time Law is high. I'm afraid that before long, you'll be able to completely comprehend the Time Law. By then I won't be your match."</p>

  <p>She was actually explaining all of this to Zheng bit by bit …</p>

  <p>The divine-level talents at Virtual Tribulation Realm sighed.</p>

  <p>These divine-level talents were so powerful that they were considered monstrous on their own territory. They were absolutely proud.</p>

  <p>But compared to Zheng, their pride was nothing. This was simply too much of a blow to them. Zheng had comprehended the Time Law so fast that the term "monstrous" was not enough to describe him.</p>

  <p>"The only explanation I can think of is that this guy is not human!" someone said angrily.</p>

  <p>"If he isn't human, then what is he?" someone else asked.</p>

  <p>"An animal! A beast!" This seemed to be the only explanation for Zheng's achievement.</p>

  <p>Zheng, on the other hand, refused to budge. Fiona gritted her teeth.</p>

  <p>"Surrender. I beg of you! I don't want to use that move," she pleaded desperately.</p>

  <p>This was the second time that she had begged him.</p>

  <p>Zheng shook his head and smiled faintly, "I'm very sorry, but by begging me like this, you've really put me in a difficult situation. I'm afraid I have to refuse. I can agree to many things, but surrendering is not one of them."</p>

  <p>Fiona pouted sullenly. All the martial artists looked at her with equal parts of affection and anger. They loved Fiona, but they were angry at Zheng, who had turned down their goddess.</p>

  <p>'All he needs to do is admit defeat. What's the big deal?'</p>

  <p>"Then you leave me no choice." Fiona sniffed and raised her right hand high.</p>

  <p>The fiery-red jade bracelet moved back and forth on her slender wrist.</p>

  <p>As she raised her hand, the jade bracelet slid down her wrist all the way until it reached her elbow. Only after reaching her bicep did it stop.</p>

  <p>Then, her hands got clasped together.</p>

  <p>Every time Fiona activated her life vitality, the jade bracelet would rapidly vibrate. As it was on her arm right now, her entire body started shaking.</p>

  <p>She shook violently. It was so fast that all you could see was a hazy outline of her figure.</p>

  <p>The jade bracelet began turning a brilliant fiery-red color.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, many of the Soul Sea Realm experts from Wind Divine Kingdom turned to look at their emperor, War King Wind.</p>

  <p>He looked completely calm, but the Soul Sea Realm experts were anxious. One of them couldn't hold it in any longer and asked, "My king, are you not going to stop her?"</p>

  <p>A complex expression crept on War King Wind's face. To be fair, he did not wish for Fiona to use that move. However, this time, he steeled his heart, because he had pampered her too much in the past. That was why she was so immature.</p>

  <p>Even the eagle knows when to push the eaglet off the cliff to train it. As the emperor of a kingdom, couldn't he do the same?</p>

  <p>So he had decided to let Fiona make her own decision regarding Tianxing.</p>

  <p>As long as her life wasn't in danger, he would no longer stop her.</p>

  <p>"Forget it. It's up to her," War King Wind replied.</p>

  <p>The other powerful warriors of the Soul Sea Realm didn't have anything to say after this.</p>

  <p>As the flames on the jade bracelet around Fiona's arm became increasingly bright, a deep imprint appeared on her forehead and a surge of energy seeped out of it.</p>

  <p>"Genuine Phoenix Fire, come out!"</p>

  <p>Right on cue, a condensed phoenix phantom appeared behind her.</p>

  <p>The people at the plaza felt an intense heat wave. The powerful warriors of the Soul Sea Realm managed to weaken the force of the heat wave by casting an enchanted barrier, but it was still hard for them to block it.</p>

  <p>Many Virtual Tribulation Realm warriors had to condense their protective life vitality to combat the heat wave.</p>

  <p>"Does Fiona have the Genuine Phoenix bloodline? Is she a descendant of the Phoenix race?" yelled someone.</p>

  <p>"The concentration of her bloodline is ridiculously high. It's very likely that she's a descendant of the Phoenix race."</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyebrows shot up when he saw the slowly congealing flames.</p>

  <p>Once Zheng had absorbed the blood as well as the blood essence of Genuine Dragons. They were very good for the refinement of his body.</p>

  <p>However, he had only absorbed a few drops of them. So he did not have much of them in his body, and more importantly, he hadn't absorbed enough Genuine Dragon blood, so he had not yet mastered the theurgy of the Genuine Dragons.</p>

  <p>But Fiona seemed to be the true descendant of a super legendary beast.</p>

  <p>Her blood density was ridiculously high, and the Genuine Phoenix phantom had actually been condensed to such a degree.</p>

  <p>When Zheng was at the Cloud Sect, he had learned that Tracy possessed the Blue Phoenix bloodline. However, the Blue Phoenix could not compare to a super legendary beast, and was far inferior to Genuine Dragons and Genuine Phoenixes.</p>

  <p>Fiona was different, though. She seemed to have a complete Genuine Phoenix bloodline.</p>

  <p>From between her eyebrows, streams of flames surged out.</p>

  <p>The flames condensed continuously and slowly fused together to form a phoenix.</p>

  <p>The phoenix formed by Fiona was different from the one Yudie had created. Yudie's ice phoenix was just an illusion, while this one seemed to be a real phoenix!</p>
