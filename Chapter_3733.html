<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Ziya had lived for a long time. It was only natural that he emitted a strong aura of vicissitudes when he descended into the Source World.</p>

  <p>His aura was completely different from that of the Primeval Lord of Heaven.</p>

  <p>While the latter gave people the impression that he was someone full of wisdom and knowledge, Ziya seemed like the aggressive sort.</p>

  <p>Back when the Primeval Lord of Heaven created the Enlightenment Sect, he had entrusted Ziya with an important post. In fact, these masters of the human race could successfully become Eternal Warriors and reach the Eternal Realm because of Ziya.</p>

  <p>When the many powerful warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace sensed the man's aggressive aura, their expressions shifted.</p>

  <p>In terms of cultivation alone, Ziya was merely an Eternal Warrior. But his aura was far stronger than that of Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Fuxi, and the Snake Goddess. Was he the powerful master that had descended from the Deleting Space?</p>

  <p>"I really didn't expect to come back after over a thousand chaotic eras…"</p>

  <p>Ziya strolled along the Supreme Dragon Hall before cupping his hands toward the Primeval Lord of Heaven above Zheng's head. "Master, may I have a look at this world?"</p>

  <p>"Of course," the Primeval Lord of Heaven nodded.</p>

  <p>Once Ziya took a single step forward, everyone was blinded by a white flash of light. They felt nearly no fluctuation in the space, but the man had completely disappeared from the hall.</p>

  <p>High up in the sky of the Bloom Divine Province, Ziya stood atop the clouds, overlooking the vast land.</p>

  <p>In the Deleting Space, Ziya had absolute freedom. But it was a mere recycle bin to the chaos. The Land of Ashes, which was its another name, was a place where garbage and ashes belonged.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Once Ziya took a deep breath, the clouds within a hundred thousand-mile radius surged rapidly toward his stomach.</p>

  <p>Once the clouds dissipated, everything in the Bloom Divine Province came into view.</p>

  <p>When leveled roads and plains were all he could see, a strange look came over Ziya's face. The shape of the world was far from what he had imagined.</p>

  <p>In the 77th chaos, the human civilization was established among vast starry regions, while the Source World was much like a giant egg. Every large province was about the size of a starry region.</p>

  <p>After taking some time to observe, Ziya returned to the Supreme Dragon Hall and bowed to the Primeval Lord of Heaven. "I've already observed this world, but I still hold much doubt in my heart…"</p>

  <p>"If you have any questions, just ask," urged the Primeval Lord of Heaven with a smile.</p>

  <p>And so the Snake Goddess came forward and answered the questions about the general situation of the Source World.</p>

  <p>Once Ziya picked up more information, the Snake Goddess continued,</p>

  <p>"Because Eastern Emperor Taiyi is trapped on the Other Shore, the Oneness Sky Palace is in danger without any Eternal Warrior to guard it. But the people of the Oneness Sky Palace have no intention of moving to the Pear Hill, so now, they need a powerful warrior to guard it."</p>

  <p>When Pearce, Auden and the other elders of the Oneness Sky Palace heard the Snake Goddess' words, their eyes suddenly lit up.</p>

  <p>Moving the Oneness Sky Palace to the Pear Hill was far too big a project, not to mention the fact that the Oneness Sky Palace was already in a state of panic. There was no guarantee that they could avoid trouble during the migration process.</p>

  <p>If there was truly such a powerful warrior around to fill Easter Emperor Taiyi's vacancy to guard the palace, everyone would feel at ease.</p>

  <p>"If Master Ziya could guard the Oneness Sky Palace, we'd surely be very grateful. So would Easter Emperor Taiyi!"</p>

  <p>"Please stay!"</p>

  <p>Auden and Pearce cupped their hands and begged in unison.</p>

  <p>Much to their surprise, Ziya said, "But I still have something important to take care of in the Deleting Space."</p>

  <p>Returning to chaos was a unique experience for Ziya, but his focus was still on the Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>Seeing the disappointment in Pearce's and the others' eyes, Zheng took a step forward and said, "Master Ziya, I know you have many affairs to deal with in the Deleting Space. But if a strong enemy approaches to attack us, I will help you descend. Is this okay with you?"</p>

  <p>At that, Ziya was overjoyed. "Yes, that will do!"</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi's physical body was currently still in the Oneness Sky Palace. If he let the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi possess his body, his strength wouldn't be inferior to that of any Eternal Warrior. With Ziya's help, the Oneness Sky Palace could naturally grow more stable.</p>

  <p>This time, when Fuxi came, Zheng handed over half of the golden red Chaotic Source Spirits while simultaneously obtaining a Descending Ring.</p>

  <p>Before Fuxi left, he also warned Zheng that the Black Ship had three Descending Rings. He was forced to hand over the thirty golden red Chaotic Source Spirits Zheng had given to Yan so that the Black Ship could also summon the Other Shore creatures to descend into Source World.</p>

  <p>Now, the most grim were likely the Yellow Thearch and the Divine Farmer.</p>

  <p>They had another six Descending Rings in their hands, but because they lacked the golden red Chaotic Source Spirits, they couldn't summon the Other Shore creatures to the Source World.</p>

  <p>In the Chaotic Source World, many people knew of Zheng having obtained the golden red Chaotic Source Spirits. The Yellow Thearch could easily take notice of the fact and target Zheng for an attack.</p>

  <p>After giving Zheng a warning, Fuxi threw a small Eight-Diagram disc to him— it was a voice-transmitting tool of the Pear Hill. Even if Zheng was several provinces away from Fuxi, it could still send him a message instantly. Fuxi gave Zheng the tool for the purpose that if something went wrong, Zheng could ask him for help immediately.</p>

  <p>After everything was arranged, Fuxi and the Snake Goddess left with the warriors of the Pear Hill.</p>

  <p>Zheng was also prepared to return to the Flow Sword Sect and continue to explore the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Just before leaving the Supreme Dragon Hall, his gaze suddenly fell on Winchell, bringing Dorothy to mind.</p>

  <p>Since Yasamin was trapped, Dorothy hadn't participated in the war with the Sun Crow race, nor had she appeared on the Other Shore. "Master Winchell, how has Dorothy been recently?" Zheng asked when he walked up to Winchell.</p>

  <p>"She's not good," replied the latter slowly, wearing a heavy expression.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?" Zheng frowned.</p>

  <p>Winchell smiled faintly and said, "If you want to know, I'm afraid you'll have to personally pay a visit to the Origin Mountain and have a look. We don't know what happened to her. If the Primeval Lord of Heaven could take a look at her, we'd be very grateful."</p>

  <p>The words 'very grateful' lingered in Zheng's ears, sounding somewhat ironic.</p>

  <p>Part of the reason Zheng joined the Oneness Sky Palace was because of his acquaintance with Dorothy, after all. Zheng's relationship with her only grew closer after that.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of the people of the Origin Mountain, Zheng was now the most popular in the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>It wasn't right that he had completely forgotten about Dorothy, even if he was busy exploring the Soul City.</p>

  <p>"You're being too polite, Master Winchell," Zheng said anxiously. "Please allow me to go with you."</p>

  <p>And under Winchell's lead, Zheng headed to the Origin Mountain.</p>

  <p>In front of the emerald green palace atop the mountain, Felicity guarded the gate.</p>

  <p>Anger flashed across her eyes when she saw Winchell bringing Zheng along.</p>

  <p>"Why did you bring this guy here? Take him away!"</p>

  <p>Winchell was a person who would pay attention to the interests of the whole Oneness Sky Palace. Objectively speaking, Zheng owed nothing to the Origin Mountain. On the other hand, thanks to Zheng, the entire Oneness Sky Palace avoided complete destruction.</p>

  <p>But Felicity thought differently.</p>
