<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The over two thousand and five hundred Divine Dao were completely integrated, which was close to Luo Zheng's limit.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng finally released the Ways-blending Energy, it was stable enough to turn into sword radiance and rapidly charge forward.</p>

  <p>When it hit the inner wall of the black sphere, however, it became disturbed and unsteady. The Ways-blending Energy, which was the perfect combination of various Divine Dao, exploded. It was as if a bright sun had suddenly shone across the sky and emitted an intense light, accompanied by a violent explosive sound.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Although the black sphere was very stable and near unbreakable, it had its limits.</p>

  <p>The moment when the Ways-blending Energy exploded, cracks began to appear on the surface of the sphere until it eventually collapsed, sending powerful shock waves throughout the area.</p>

  <p>Tianming, Sword Chen, and the Demi-holy Beings who had been trapped inside the sphere were thrown out in all directions, like kites with their strings cut off.</p>

  <p>Those outside the sphere, including Alfredo and Leland, were also physically blown away by the force.</p>

  <p>However, none of them had heard the explosive sound as it had shattered their eardrums and rendered them deaf. Fortunately, such small injuries would heal very quickly, but for now, their sense of hearing was gone.</p>

  <p>Only Luo Zheng and Pascal remained standing on the plain.</p>

  <p>Pascal's body was still covered in the black armor, revealing only a pair of eyes under his black helmet. Astonishment filled his eyes as he looked at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Samuel had been willing to send Pascal to the Mountain of Holy Beings only because he was determined to take Luo Zheng's life. He didn't think it was a difficult task.</p>

  <p>After all, he had seen all of Luo Zheng's tricks in the Abyss Demon Region and estimated his strength.</p>

  <p>He was even aware of the power of the Time Jade Seal and the method Luo Zheng once used to remove the soul marks in his two daughters.</p>

  <p>But now, it turned out that he had still underestimated Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's strength seemed to have increased greatly after his departure from the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>"You are merely a hundred years old, and you spent most of your time in the secondary world. If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn't have believed that someone could have become so powerful in such a short period of time!" Pascal said. "It's a pity that someone so talented like you is my enemy."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng took out another long sword from his space ring and said softly, "Our common enemy was Nicholas, and we had the chance to work together.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, you seem determined to go down this dark road to replace him. You even sacrificed your own children for this cause. Mark my words, you will regret it."</p>

  <p>"And what makes you think that?" Pascal smiled faintly.</p>

  <p>"This!"</p>

  <p>As soon as his voice fell, Luo Zheng stomped on the ground and charged at Pascal, leaving a series of ghost shadows in his wake.</p>

  <p>As he moved, he quickly asked No. 9527 to help him erase Samuel's soul mark.</p>

  <p>Pascal was only a puppet, after all. Once the soul mark was erased, he would be like a piece of treasure without an owner. And as for whether to move Pascal's Memory Flame back into his body, it could be decided later.</p>

  <p>The real Pascal's stance still remained to be seen.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng had briefly come in contact with him twice and thought him to be an honest man. He believed that Pascal would side with his two sisters, rather than with his tyrannical father.</p>

  <p>The internal momentum in Luo Zheng's body was continuously surging into his long sword, giving it the power of lightning.</p>

  <p>The sword was buzzing with so much energy that it seemed like it would shatter at any time!</p>

  <p>Pascal's face darkened. For the first time, he decided to retreat. However, Luo Zheng was so fast that Pascal couldn't dodge his attack.</p>

  <p>In a flash, Luo Zheng launched the Ways-blending Strike once again.</p>

  <p>Another beam of light shone brightly in front of Pascal. The layer of black armor that covered him was extremely thick, but the force produced by the explosion of the Ways-blending Energy created a crack that tore the armor open from the middle.</p>

  <p>"Now! It's the right time!" Luo Zheng told No. 9527 in his heart.</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh...</p>

  <p>No. 9527 surged out of Luo Zheng's chest and headed straight for Pascal's mind.</p>

  <p>However, just when it was halfway to Pascal, the blood jade necklace on Pascal's chest suddenly flashed, releasing beams of faint red light that blocked its way.</p>

  <p>"Eh? This is Blood Soul Jade. Such a rare thing actually exists in the divine land!"</p>

  <p>No matter how significant No. 9527 was, it was still just a soul fragment and couldn't go up against the Blood Soul Jade in such a short amount of time, anyway.</p>

  <p>But it was confident that if it had enough time, it would be able to find the flaws in the barrier formed by the Blood Soul Jade and break through it.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the opening it had now lasted only for a second. Now that the blood jade necklace was activated, Pascal's broken armor repaired itself, and the huge wings on Pascal's back flapped like huge scissors as they came toward Luo Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>With the sudden turn of events, Luo Zheng had no choice but to retreat. No. 9527 also returned back to his chest.</p>

  <p>"Even you can't break it with your ability?" Luo Zheng asked with a frown.</p>

  <p>"I can but I need more time..." No. 9527 said in an unhappy tone. "The Blood Soul Jade is rare even in the Source World. It can suppress my secret skill."</p>

  <p>"Time..."</p>

  <p>A bitter smile appeared on Luo Zheng's face. It would be difficult for him to buy more time.</p>

  <p>Pascal rose up in the air again. At this moment, Samuel was glad that he had blocked Luo Zheng's attack. If it weren't for the necklace, his soul mark would have been erased.</p>

  <p>"Some methods aren't for you to use," Pascal continued. "Ever since I gained control of the Abyss Demon Region, I have been trying to figure out the secrets within it. Unfortunately, that ring didn't give me any clues. What exactly is this energy? How should I use it? There are so many questions..."</p>

  <p>The power of the Abyss Demon Region that Samuel had comprehended through Pascal was, after all, something that was second-hand. Although he had control of the Abyss Demon Region, he hadn't brought out its power.</p>

  <p>"Fortunately, I have gained some new insight during this period of time. In fact, the role of the Abyss Demon Region should be to help destroy the divine land..."</p>

  <p>Pascal said as he raised his hand.</p>

  <p>Black aura swirled around his right hand and quickly turned into a pure black hole that devoured light.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the entire divine land fell into darkness.</p>

  <p>Even the originally dazzling sun died down to a small dot that shrunk and shrunk until it eventually disappeared.</p>

  <p>The entire divine land was now shrouded in complete darkness.</p>

  <p>No one in any part of the divine land was able to produce any light, not even if they lit torches or activated luminous stones. All the light had been taken away by Pascal.</p>
