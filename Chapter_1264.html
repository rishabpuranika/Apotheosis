<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1264 Return to the Cloud Sect </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>As he looked south, a figure appeared in his heart, shocking Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The figure belonged to Mu Ning, the eldest princess of the Burning Sky Empire who always took care of and protected him in the past. She was always dressed in green.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng had left the Eastern Region, he had channeled most of his time and energy into rescuing Yan. Mu Ning had been waiting for him in the Eastern Region, but it was only now that he got the chance to return to her.</p>

  <p>He thought of Mu Ning who ran about wildly in the palace with him, smashing one wall after another as she looked on, a carefree smile on her face. She didn't have high expectations, always acting like a teacher who had enlightened him about the world. She had always tried her best to do everything the right way and never demanded anything.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng felt a sudden sense of guilt as he thought of this.</p>

  <p>Zheng's reputation had risen rapidly within the Cloud Hall. After that, he had become very powerful and famous in the Central Region, his reputation spreading to the Eastern Region, too. This was enough to ensure Aura's safety.</p>

  <p>Kenneth wasn't the leader of the Cloud Sect for no reason. He was not a fool. He wouldn't even dare let Mu Ning suffer even the slightest of injuries.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng wasn't worried about Aura's safety. He had once promised to return to the Eastern Region, but he hadn't been able to keep his promise for a long time. According to everyone else, four years was not a long period of time. They thought Luo Zheng to be amazing, having achieved so much in the world and now returning to the Eastern Region, after having been away for such a short time. Luo Zheng had already had several chances to return to the Eastern Region before. But he had chosen to spend his time cultivating because of Yan.</p>

  <p>This looked like Luo Zheng had left Mu Ning behind, without contacting her during the time he had been away.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng could choose one of two routes to go back to the Eastern Region.</p>

  <p>One was to pass through the transmission array and enter the relics of the sixth-grade sect, and the other was to directly pass through the Central Region.</p>

  <p>In the past, Luo Zheng would probably have chosen the shortest route and passed through the transmission array.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng wasn't in a hurry right now. It was as if he had a lot of spare time that he could use to relax. He travelled east with Ning Yudie and Mu Ning, choosing to pass through the entire Central Region before entering the Eastern Region.</p>

  <p>"I've never been to the Eastern Region," Ning Yudie said with a smile.</p>

  <p>The two women seemed to be happy as they made their way to the east.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't know if they were still in conflict but at least now, they weren't being openly hostile to each other.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning blinked and smiled. "I've never been there either, but I want to see Zheng's hometown where he grew up!"</p>

  <p>The Eastern Region was merely an extension of the Central Region. But it was still much larger than the Western Region and the other regions.</p>

  <p>This allowed the presence of the powerful Burning Sky Empire in the Eastern Region.</p>

  <p>With the high speed at which they were cruising along, it would probably take them only a day to cross over the Central Region. But the three of them moved leisurely and treated this as an outing, their speed slowing down. It took them seven days before they arrived at the Burning Sky Empire.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng attracted a lot of attention as he stood at the entrance of the Burning Sky Empire with the two beautiful women flanking him.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning and Ning Yudie were very attractive, a noble Mu Ning framing them and making them look like fairies in a painting. Many people looked at them, admiration tinging their countenances.</p>

  <p>"That guy looks quite arrogant. He's even brought two pretty women into the Imperial Capital!"</p>

  <p>"He would get in trouble if those hoodlums even think of targeting him!"</p>

  <p>"Are you joking? I can't even figure out the cultivation base of those three. I think they are at least in the Illuminating Soul Realm, and that man is probably an Internal Elixir Realm warrior. Who would dare take action against them? The noble clans? In that case, they'd be asking for trouble if they dare do so!"</p>

  <p>Some commoners and warriors began to quietly discuss among themselves.</p>

  <p>The three of them stood there, impervious to these discussions.</p>

  <p>In the Eastern Region, the Internal Elixir Realm was the highest level of a warrior's cultivation base. Kenneth, the leader of the Cloud Sect belonging to the Cloud Hall, was the strongest warrior in the entire Eastern Region.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie and Mu Ning were not interested in the Burning Sky Imperial Capital. Ning Yudie controlled the Cloud Hall, which was equivalent to controlling the Cloudy City. And compared to the Cloudy City which had many, many clans, the Burning Sky Imperial Capital was almost nothing.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning had grown up in the Ethereal City, a big city that was famous for its resources and foundation. It had been destroyed by the Heavenly Evil Sect, but in the past, even the big cities of the Central Region had been nothing to the members of the Ethereal City.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was on a completely different emotional plane, sighing as he looked upon this place.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng and the two women arrived at the entrance of the Cloud Sect, there seemed to be some sort of event going on. Several stewards of the Cloud Sect stood on the flying chariot, guarding the gate.</p>

  <p>When one of the stewards saw Luo Zheng walk over with Ning Yudie and Mu Ning, he looked shocked.</p>

  <p>The steward could not figure out Zheng's and Yudie's cultivation levels.</p>

  <p>But he could recognize that Mu Ning was at the Internal Elixir Realm.</p>

  <p>Margaret's fighting strength might not have been as good as some mighty warriors at the ultimate level of the Illuminating Soul Realm if she didn't rely on her Purple Power Body to fight. But as she was an Internal Elixir Realm warrior, she could still intimidate some warriors, especially in the Eastern Region where the Internal Elixir Realm warriors belonged at the top.</p>

  <p>The steward approached them on the flying chariot and jumped down from it. He folded his hands at the three of them. "May I know why you've come to the Cloud Sect?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked at the steward and after a moment, laughed. "Steward Cao, don't you remember me?"</p>

  <p>Steward Cao had guarded the Lake of the Magical Fish in the past. It looked like he had been demoted to the position of a patrolling steward.</p>

  <p>Steward Cao looked at Luo Zheng, confused, but as he recognized him, shock and surprise took their place on his face.</p>

  <p>He had felt that Luo Zheng seemed a little familiar in the beginning, as if he had seen him somewhere else.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng had left more than four years ago and in these years, he had turned from a teenager into a strapping young man. His strength had increased by leaps and bounds. He had refined his body several times and his physical body had changed a lot. He also had a different Mu Ning now.</p>

  <p>That was why Steward Cao hadn't recognized him.</p>

  <p>Surprised recognition lit up his eyes.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>Even though a lot of information could not be spread to the Eastern Region from the Central Region, people could still learn a few tidbits through the Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>And Luo Zheng was a disciple of the Cloud Sect in the Eastern Region. So it was obvious that the Cloud Sect would pay attention to his movements.</p>

  <p>As long as there was a chance, news of Zheng's every move would be spread to the Eastern Region from the Central Region.</p>

  <p>As he watched Steward Cao's face bloom in surprise, Luo Zheng nodded and raised a finger to his lips, indicating for him to keep silent.</p>

  <p>Steward Cao nodded and controlled himself from shouting out loudly.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng had trained at the Lake of the Magical Fish, Steward Cao had noticed Zheng's remarkable performances. He had even tried to report Zheng's great performance to the top leaders, but was stopped by several saints.</p>

  <p>Kenneth had punished those saints, one even killed, in the All Peaks Competition. But once that was over, those saints had begun trying to get back at Steward Cao because of the humiliation they had faced. But Steward Cao wasn't the reason behind Kenneth's fury. Those saints had later found a reason and demoted Steward Cao to the position of a patrolling steward.</p>

  <p>"Why have you been demoted?" Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Steward Cao was overjoyed, guessing that Luo Zheng was in a very high position now. He probably would not be able to get any benefit from Luo Zheng, but since Luo Zheng had himself asked about it, there might be a chance that Luo Zheng could help him be promoted to a higher position. It might be difficult for someone like Steward Cao to achieve something, but Luo Zheng might be able to help him get what he wanted just by giving an order.</p>

  <p>So he briefly told Luo Zheng about what had transpired.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded, but before he could say anything, Ning Yudie frowned and said,</p>

  <p>"I have never been to the Cloud Sect before and had never expected such a boring thing to happen in a second-grade sect. I wonder how Kenneth manages the sect. If I meet him, I'll have to punish him for that."</p>

  <p>Steward Cao's jaw dropped a little as he heard Ning Yudie refer to the Cloud Sect leader by his name. She was blaming the leader? And would she do that to his face? Who was this woman?</p>

  <p>Steward Cao did not dare ask, but he was secretly trying to guess Yudie's identity.</p>

  <p>As he saw Steward Cao's expression, Luo Zheng smiled. "Alright. Since the top leader is paying attention to this matter, I believe there should be no problem at all."</p>

  <p>"The top leader?" At Zheng's words, Steward Cao mustered enough courage to ask, "This fairy-like lady is..."</p>

  <p>"She's the leader of Cloud Hall," Luo Zheng said with a nonchalant shrug.</p>
