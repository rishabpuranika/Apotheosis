<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1027 The Life And Death Wind </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Just as Eddie was about to flourish his saber, another wave of significant power emerged from the top of the city walls, followed by an aged voice.</p>

  <p>"Eddie, it's me you're going to face!"</p>

  <p>If a man had lived for a thousand years, he was to become a legend. The one who spoke was the Ancient Tycoon, the pillar of the World Commercial Alliance. In the entirety of the Central Region, he was the only one who was over a thousand years old.</p>

  <p>For a long time, the Ancient Tycoon had been holding back. However, at that particularly critical moment, he decided to make his move. It was the perfect time to do so.</p>

  <p>Two years ago, only he had the capability to defeat Eddie. After Luo Zheng killed Marilyn during the Martial Arts Contest, Eddie tried to end him, too.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie, along with the three leaders of the World Commercial Alliance and Imogen couldn't stop Eddie. It was only the Ancient Tycoon who could.</p>

  <p>That meant that the strength of the Ancient Tycoon was at least the same as Eddie's.</p>

  <p>The Ancient Tycoon brought his hands together, his wrinkled skin twitching. He then reached out a withered palm towards Eddie, covering his face.</p>

  <p>However, before he could even attack, Eddie surprised him by saying, "Old man, I have disliked you for a long time. But for you, I might've killed Luo Zheng two years ago. Since you have a death wish, I will grant it for you!"</p>

  <p>Originally, Eddie had planned to use the Netherworld Shaking on Ning Yudie, but he had a new target now. He swung his Nameless Saber towards the Ancient Tycoon.</p>

  <p>"Whir…"</p>

  <p>A bright yellow-colored wind came out of Eddie's saber, sweeping across the Ancient Tycoon.</p>

  <p>The moment the yellow gust of wind left the Nameless Saber, that distinct feeling immediately spread out. All the living beings inside and outside Oracle City were all captured by fear at the same time. None of them dared to move and they all held their breaths.</p>

  <p>Quickly, Luo Zheng pulled Ning Yudie to retreat with him. Even if he didn't want to let the Ancient Tycoon fight Eddie on his own, the safety of Ning Yudie was more important for him. As they went their way, he asked, "Cyan dragon, what exactly is that thing? Why is it that terrifying?"</p>

  <p>Before the cyan dragon could even reply, the wind had already swept towards the Ancient Tycoon.</p>

  <p>The wind didn't seem to be that strong at all. It was almost as if it was only a gentle breeze and only caused the hem of the Ancient Tycoon's robe to move a little. Immediately afterwards, the eyes of the Ancient Tycoon lost all their color, and he fell silently to the ground. He was lifeless.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng witnessed what just happened, the expression on his face drastically changed.</p>

  <p>In the midst of a fierce battle against his opponent, Dillon roared out in anger, "Sir!"</p>

  <p>Hearing Dillon's loud voice, the faces of Hobbes and Haber darkened. Not in a million years did they think that the Ancient Tycoon wouldn't stand a chance against Eddie.</p>

  <p>The three of them were all promoted by the Ancient Tycoon. Their affection towards the old man and each other was special, so seeing the Ancient Tycoon like that was gut-wrenching for them.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry. You'll meet him again, for I'll send all of you to the netherworld!" Eddie sneered.</p>

  <p>Turning around, his eyes landed on both Luo Zheng and Ning Yudie. He raised the Nameless Saber once again, and immediately, another unique kind of power came into sight. "It's your turn now!"</p>

  <p>The hearts of Ning Yudie and Luo Zheng both sank.</p>

  <p>It was obvious how Eddie's strength was far beyond Zheng's imagination. He was able to kill his opponent with just a faint breeze. No one else had ever done that. What technique was that? It was unbelievable.</p>

  <p>The Ancient Tycoon was mighty, but he fell just like that.</p>

  <p>Before he could even make a move, he was instantly slain by Eddie. Even if Ning Yudie had already broken through to the Life and Death Realm, her powers were no match to Eddie's.</p>

  <p>If Ning Yudie and Luo Zheng were to combine both their powers, they were still much weaker than the Ancient Tycoon. How were they supposed to defeat Eddie?</p>

  <p>"Cyan dragon, what technique is that?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng asked anxiously as he continued retreating.</p>

  <p>"Eddie is using the Life and Death Wind from the Netherworld River," the cyan dragon responded in a cautious tone.</p>

  <p>"Life and Death Wind? What is that?" Luo Zheng asked, obviously having no clue as to what it was.</p>

  <p>"That kind of wind only blows on the Netherworld River. Even the evil beings that live in and out of the river cower in its presence. Those who are blown by this particular wind shall die immediately," the dragon explained.</p>

  <p>"Is there any way to resist such a thing?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng asked with a hint of hope in his voice.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon sighed and said, "It's strange, really. Theoretically, no one can control the wind. Even when fiends walk on the Netherworld River, they will carefully avoid it. I don't know how Eddie manages to control it."</p>

  <p>Even if the dragon didn't directly answer Zheng's question, he knew exactly what he meant. There was no known way to resist the Life and Death Wind.</p>

  <p>At that time, Luo Zheng and Ning Yudie were only traveling back and forth in the Oracle City to spare them some time. Eddie was too busy to care about the battle that was going on at the top of the city walls. It was as if he never really cared about the outcome of the battle at all, like it had nothing to do with him.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, his strategy was working. There were only three people in the Oracle City that posed a threat to him. Since the Ancient Tycoon had already been killed, he only had Luo Zheng and Ning Yudie to worry about. As long as they were killed, the warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm wouldn't have the power to stop him even if he were to lose the battle beside the city walls.</p>

  <p>With just a snap of his fingers, he could kill all those warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm. Even the three fat men were nothing to him.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the Oracle City itself was extremely vast, and the distance between the two parties couldn't close down. At that time, Luo Zheng suddenly felt a strong sense of irritation.</p>

  <p>Indeed, Eddie had been pressing down on him the entire time. Back when Luo Zheng was still in the Cloud Sect, he already made a huge impact on Zheng's warrior spirit. The time Luo Zheng spent in Cloud Hall and Oracle City was no exception. Even after Zheng's return from the Sea God Continent, Eddie continued to come after him.</p>

  <p>It was that very day when Luo Zheng had finally decided to fight Eddie head on and kill him once and for all. However, the attack that Eddie had displayed suppressed him once again and forced him to take a step back.</p>

  <p>Even though Luo Zheng was mentally prepared and had stabilized his warrior spirit to its limits, he still couldn't help but feel annoyed. Was Eddie really the most unbeatable rival in his life?</p>

  <p>For Eddie, Luo Zheng was also a monumental opponent. Ever since Eddie had become the strongest independent warrior in the Central Region, not one thing or person could shake his spirit. Luo Zheng had repeatedly beaten him up, taken advantage of him, and even made him a laughingstock in the presence of Central Region warriors. Killing anybody never bothered him one bit because he could do that easily. Luo Zheng was the only exception.</p>

  <p>He planned to delay Zheng's death.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie felt the impatience that grew inside of Luo Zheng, a guy who remained calm at all times. He was obviously getting agitated as the minutes flew.</p>

  <p>The most important thing for a warrior was to maintain his state of mind, but Ning Yudie knew Luo Zheng very well. If at that kind of time he was still able to control his state of mind, then he couldn't possibly be human.</p>

  <p>As humans were created to have emotions, getting upset from time to time was normal. They just needed to learn how to manage those emotions.</p>

  <p>Thinking of this, Ning Yudie tilted her body and placed her hand on Zheng's robe, covering his chest.</p>

  <p>At the same time, under the circulation of her life vitality, a wave of ice-cold Mu Ning spread out.</p>

  <p>"Calm down, Luo Zheng," Ning Yudie said softly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng felt a cooling sensation kiss his heart. His beating heart gradually slowed down. His tense face gradually relaxed, and the vexed look on his face disappeared without a trace.</p>

  <p>"You're right. I have to calm down," he responded.</p>

  <p>One of Zheng's prides in life was his positive attitude, but that day, he almost lost it.</p>

  <p>During the countless dangers that he had encountered, his calmness had always helped him overcome them. He never thought he'd feel such distress because of Eddie.</p>

  <p>"Xun!" Luo Zheng called out softly.</p>

  <p>A speck of red light instantly condensed around Luo Zheng. He reached out his hand and a ray of light burst out from his space ring. The middle-grade sacred spear spun around twice before landing in Xun's hand.</p>

  <p>"Do you want me to kill him?"</p>

  <p>Xun asked with a smile.</p>

  <p>"No, it's too dangerous. You aren't his match!" Luo Zheng replied. He shook his head before he continued, "But please hold him back!"</p>

  <p>Xun nodded. "No problem. You can count on me."</p>

  <p>As a sword spirit, Xun only had one soul attached to her. She didn't have any life force, so naturally, she wasn't threatened by Eddie's Life and Death Wind. Upon Zheng's command, she held the long spear and turbulently shot towards Eddie.</p>
