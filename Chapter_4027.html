<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng followed and smashed down per Campbell's instructions.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>This last smash was strong enough and revealed a unique rune below.</p>

  <p>Similar to the first rune, the second faced a different direction. They must be related to one another.</p>

  <p>However, Campbell left out an explanation. He continued to walk in another direction, pointing at different areas on the ground, which signaled Luo Zheng to smash them open.</p>

  <p>Crack, crack, crack, crack...</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had created more than twenty holes in the huge Pure Sky Platform. In each hole, they found a different rune.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng formed the last hole, Campbell lightly pressed the rune inside. A ray of faint yellow light reflected out in response to Campbell's touch.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, the runes in the other holes lit up one after another. Once they were all glowing with yellow light, the ground trembled.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>A muffled sound echoed from the inside of the Pure Sky Platform as if something had just opened within it.</p>

  <p>Just then, the Pure Sky Platform slowly rotated. The stone pillars that held the armors rose one by one. At the same time, a noticeable crack appeared right at the center of the Pure Sky Platform that revealed the inside of the platform. Within the shell-like structure were patterns and complex structures.</p>

  <p>"The Pure Sky Platform is so ingenious," Fuxi praised.</p>

  <p>"Just like the mechanical devices below the Myriad Pagoda Mountains."</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess nodded in appreciation and then looked at Campbell.</p>

  <p>"These things were probably crafted by the world builders."</p>

  <p>"Whatever! I'm more interested in the armors! Squeak!" King Ieuan squealed, mesmerized by the display of armors within the stone pillars.</p>

  <p>The first time they saw the armors and weapons, their interest was immediately piqued.</p>

  <p>However, Campbell warned that the armors and weapons were protected by powerful restrictions. Afterward, they lost interest and focused on the Treacherous Beings.</p>

  <p>Now that the entire Pure Sky Platform had unfolded, King Ieuan grew interested to obtain the armors and weapons.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, can we take some armors and weapons with us? Squeak!" asked King Ieuan excitedly.</p>

  <p>If they utilized these weapons, they could also rely on the Light of Annihilation to get rid of the Treacherous Beings once and for all.</p>

  <p>After pausing to think, Luo Zheng responded, "Master Campbell, these are useless if they remain here. May my friends have some? It would surely be an advantage and added protection if we go against the Treacherous Beings again."</p>

  <p>As long as they could make use of the Light of Annihilation, everyone could defend themselves against the Treacherous Beings.</p>

  <p>Hearing Luo Zheng's request, Campbell turned around and looked at him intently.</p>

  <p>Though the two were at an understanding, Campbell still doubted if he and Luo Zheng were on the same side. This could also be due to his confusion with his future. As a builder of the world, he was originally a member of the Human Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>Having no idea what happened to his sect and why the Ten Directions House attacked him, he was full of anxiety and fear. This led him to question Luo Zheng and everyone around him, too.</p>

  <p>At this point, Campbell was confused and troubled for a very long time.</p>

  <p>"Do you still doubt our intention and background?" Luo Zheng asked as he noticed Campbell's sudden sadness.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Campbell replied with a sigh.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded. "I also do not know where you stand, but do not fear. Though you are confused now, we can help you find the truth. We will cooperate with you before we are sure of your standpoint."</p>

  <p>Seeing the sincerity in Luo Zheng's expression, Campbell nodded in agreement.</p>

  <p>"You know, it doesn't matter whether I take a standpoint or not. If the Four Spirits Sect was really destroyed as you said, world builders like me have no place in the world. We are useless, hopeless, and abandoned."</p>

  <p>It took Campbell more than a thousand chaotic eras to wake up. Since then, he'd grown weary and depressed.</p>

  <p>"You belittle yourself." Luo Zheng shook his head. "If you are truly forgotten, the Ten Directions House wouldn't have sent people here, and Gianni wouldn't have rushed over!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's words comforted Campbell. "The armors and weapons cannot be given to anyone. The other world builders need these items when they wake."</p>

  <p>The world builders journeyed far to the Pure Sky Platform to fulfill their wishes. As much as the others wanted them, the weapons and armors were necessary for awakening. They were not for Campbell to give away.</p>

  <p>"Not to worry. The armors and weapons are not the sources of the Light of Annihilation," said Campbell as he pointed towards the bottom of the stone pillar. "That is where important things lie. Please, take them out."</p>

  <p>Puzzled, Luo Zheng walked towards the stone pillar and reached out his hand to feel for the bottom of the pillar.</p>

  <p>He pulled out a palm-sized cubic stone from below, which had a grain of white sand embedded at the center. Luo Zheng brought it back to Campbell and held it out. "What's this?"</p>

  <p>"This is a Holy Stone, but a small one," Campbell said with a smile. "The Light of Annihilation in the armors and weapons comes from this grit-like Holy Stone."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was unaware of this before, and his jaw dropped at Campbell's last line.</p>

  <p>A Holy Stone the size of a grit could provide loads of Light of Annihilation.</p>

  <p>As he recalled, the Holy Stone snatched away from Les was a hundred times larger; no wonder the Light of Annihilation constantly flowed from it.</p>

  <p>"The Light of Annihilation in these Holy Stones is replenished after it is used up. This is a powerful weapon against the Treacherous Beings, and everyone here can take one for themselves," Campbell said as he gestured towards the pillars.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng told everyone what Campbell had said, their eyes widened in excitement, especially the three Eternal Realm Hunters.</p>

  <p>The Light of Annihilation restrained Treacherous Beings better than any other method. No doubt it was a good weapon for the warriors to have.</p>

  <p>With Campbell's permission, each of the others carefully took out a stone from the bottom of the stone pillar.</p>

  <p>Once Campbell imparted the method of activating the Light of Annihilation to all of them, they put their stones away for safekeeping.</p>

  <p>Afterward, Campbell observed the center of the Pure Sky Platform and spotted a wall beside the unfolded area. "It's time to leave here. Just need to break the wall."</p>

  <p>Within a second, Luo Zheng flew forward and threw a heavy punch at the center of the wall.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The wall immediately collapsed with a bang and revealed a small passageway. It was so short that the ceiling of the tunnel was the height of their hips.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng bent down and drilled into the passageway. They all moved forward, but at around two hundred feet, they were met with another wall. Luo Zheng did not hesitate and threw another punch.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Once the wall collapsed, they were met with a large, luxurious pool.</p>

  <p>They exited the passage one after another. When they saw the pool and the bronze statues again, they all took a breath of relief.</p>

  <p>After the battle, the Eternal Realm warriors and the Eternal Realm Hunters did not suffer much loss. They were quite lucky to have done so.</p>

  <p>However, more than half of the black-robed men were killed.</p>

  <p>These men in black robes had a grudge against their leader. They risked their lives to follow Luo Zheng but inherited no benefits. Besides, many of them ended up being injured or dead for no reason.</p>

  <p>However, the leader of the black-robed men comforted them, which allowed them to calm down eventually.</p>

  <p>With the help of Luo Zheng, they had obtained the six-headed eagles' eggs, which meant that they saved the entire Night Being race. Because of this, they were indebted to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Moreover, they all obtained a piece of Holy Stone that they treated like a treasure. If they were faced with the Treacherous Beings again, they were prepared this time.</p>
