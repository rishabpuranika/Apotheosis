<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4162 The Broken Bell </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>During the days of the 77th chaotic era, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord, the Primeval Lord of Heaven, and the other human heroes had made their judgment.</p>

  <p>According to them, it took more than nine million divine megatons of power to complete the Finale Way.</p>

  <p>That was what they had concluded under certain conditions.</p>

  <p>However, such a conclusion turned out to be so rash and childish.</p>

  <p>In the next chaotic eras, many ruling creatures still wanted to complete the Finale Way, and the amounts of power they calculated varied.</p>

  <p>Among them, the Heavenly Obsession Civilization had made an accurate calculation, and at the same time, they figured out that they needed one hundred and sixty million divine megatons of power to do that. The amount of power they calculated was far greater than what the human race had computed.</p>

  <p>Still, their result was not comprehensive nor was it the most precise one.</p>

  <p>Based on the information Elder Xue had provided, only ten million divine megatons of power was needed to complete the Finale Way.</p>

  <p>After all, the purpose of restarting the whole chaos and entering a cycle of reincarnation was to provide energy to the four pillars. The process of restarting shouldn't consume too much energy.</p>

  <p>The only thing was that the chaos was different from all the other secondary worlds.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit Sect had once transformed the world, and it took a large amount of power to complete the Finale Way. Furthermore, Elder Xue had said that an exceptionally powerful being existed behind the Snake Spirit King, so the energy needed to complete the Finale Way would be equivalent to infinite.</p>

  <p>Halfway through Elder Xue's dream, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord already understood that perhaps the only way to stabilize the chaos' situation was to kill the Snake Spirit King.</p>

  <p>That was a nearly desperate answer.</p>

  <p>After all, the Snake Spirit King had defeated even the Human Spirit King, the Monkey Spirit King, and the Bird Spirit King. How could the human race or the other races in the secondary world beat him?</p>

  <p>Those ruling forces that planned to complete the Finale Way didn't know what kind of powerful opponents they were about to face. If only they knew, they surely would not fight at all!</p>

  <p>However, it was not until the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord finished passing through the dream when he realized that there was a turning point in this matter.</p>

  <p>Elder Xue had a way to bear the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>After the disaster in the main world, all the creatures went extinct. None of them, including the Snake Spirit Sect, could return to the main world.</p>

  <p>There was only one smooth passageway existing, and it was the Eternal Scroll Painting.</p>

  <p>Elder Xue handed over the difficult task to the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord and asked him to select an Other Shore Realm warrior to obtain the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord had already completed the seemingly impossible task.</p>

  <p>Even in the face of the Snake Spirit King, he remained calm and composed, and he had already reached his limit!</p>

  <p>All the Snake Masters were stunned and speechless upon hearing the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord's words. Some of them even secretly glanced at Sewell.</p>

  <p>Was what the old man had said true?</p>

  <p>Sewell still stayed in his original posture as he looked down at the human elder below.</p>

  <p>A little while later, the Snake Spirit King's voice filled Sewell's mind.</p>

  <p>"Kill him."</p>

  <p>In turn, Sewell said, "Kill them!"</p>

  <p>Swish, swish, swish...</p>

  <p>The Snake Masters had prepared for such an event for a long time. Upon Sewell's command, they rushed towards the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord like mad.</p>

  <p>Although they appeared eager, they still had doubts in their hearts.</p>

  <p>However, they could not question their king's order. They could only hide their doubts, confusion, and even unease in the back of their minds.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord's eyes narrowed as he raised his hand.</p>

  <p>"Rise!"</p>

  <p>Rumble...</p>

  <p>The earth cracked as the massive Mysterious Yellow Tower rose from the ground.</p>

  <p>"Suppress!"</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>As a result, the Mysterious Yellow Tower crushed the Snake Masters, who had rushed to the front, into pieces.</p>

  <p>"Light of Annihilation..."</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>Then, bright white light enveloped the injured Treacherous Beings. With the help of the Mysterious Yellow Tower's killing power, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord slew several Snake Masters.</p>

  <p>"It's just a small trick. Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>At that point, Sewell joined the battle, and bone thorns grew all over his body.</p>

  <p>In the Divine Bell City</p>

  <p>At the foot of the big bell sat Augustus in a cross-legged position.</p>

  <p>He tried to break through to the twentieth floor of the Mysterious Yellow Tower.</p>

  <p>A loud, metallic clang filled the space as the bell rang, and he entered the tower.</p>

  <p>As soon as he entered, he realized that he had already reached the twentieth floor. He was secretly pleased.</p>

  <p>At that moment, however, the Mysterious Yellow Tower shook violently.</p>

  <p>He also saw four people above him.</p>

  <p>The news that Tianming had seen the owner of the tower already spread, so of course, Augustus knew about it.</p>

  <p>Naturally, he wanted to try his luck in the Mysterious Yellow Tower. If he met the owner of the tower, he might be able to get something useful and valuable.</p>

  <p>He did not expect that he didn't meet the so-called owner of the tower, but he saw four young men instead.</p>

  <p>He croaked, "You..."</p>

  <p>The moment he spoke, Dale turned around and glanced at him. He coldly pointed at him and said, "Get out!"</p>

  <p>An irresistible force had hit Augustus. His head spun, and then he was sent out of the Mysterious Yellow Tower!</p>

  <p>The bell still rang, which meant that only half of the time had passed.</p>

  <p>When the other warriors at the Other Shore Realm saw that Augustus came out so soon, they thought he had chosen the Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong, Augustus?"</p>

  <p>"Did you get the Other Shore Token on the twentieth floor?"</p>

  <p>Bromley and Hallet asked as they came over to him.</p>

  <p>Augustus was still in a daze. When he came back to his senses, he shook his head and said, "No."</p>

  <p>"Why? You haven't reached the twentieth floor yet?" Bromley asked curiously.</p>

  <p>In general, with Augustus' strength, it should be quite safe for him to climb up to the twentieth floor of the Mysterious Yellow Tower.</p>

  <p>"I saw four people..." Augustus uttered.</p>

  <p>"Four!" Hallet was slightly shocked.</p>

  <p>"But one of them kicked me out!" Augustus felt wronged and miserable.</p>

  <p>He did not even get to speak before they drove him out!</p>

  <p>A frown crossed Bromley's face. "Aside from the four people, did you see anything else?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"The Mysterious Yellow Tower shook so violently that I didn't know anything else," Augustus said and shook his head.</p>

  <p>The Ruin Graveyard had many speculations about the Mysterious Yellow Tower. One of those speculations, which Tianming had confirmed, was that the owner of the Mysterious Yellow Tower was most likely a human being, or at least supported the human race.</p>

  <p>It was evident when Bromley had received special care after he went to the Ruin Graveyard, and in the changes after the divine land entered the Ruin Graveyard.</p>

  <p>"According to Lorena, the human race is not a powerful force on the Other Shore. They will surely encounter strong enemies. I hope they can get through them safely," Bromley said anxiously.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore Realm warriors in the Ruin Graveyard relied on the Mysterious Yellow Tower. If the tower was gone, it would be hard for everyone to progress in their cultivation.</p>

  <p>"Let me go there and try," Hallet suggested.</p>

  <p>He suspected that Augustus had offended the people in the tower because he spoke too recklessly.</p>

  <p>Afterward, Hallet took out his fishing rod and swung it forcefully, about to ring the bell.</p>

  <p>But before he touched the big bell, it started to ring.</p>

  <p>"Dong!"</p>

  <p>The bell let out a strange chime, and even the people outside the Divine Bell City heard it clearly.</p>

  <p>In the end, however, the sound became high and sharp. It was so shrill that even the Other Shore Realm warriors couldn't help but cover their ears.</p>

  <p>"Dong! Crack!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the sound stopped.</p>

  <p>A crack appeared in the middle of the big bell, and the bell's surface abruptly curled up.</p>

  <p>If so many Other Shore Realm warriors hadn't seen it with their own eyes, they would have thought that someone had destroyed the bell.</p>
