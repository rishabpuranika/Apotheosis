<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>In the divine land, people had a deep understanding on all sorts of materials and their functions.</p>

  <p>For example, everyone knew that the cheapest Coleoptrata Winter Grass was used to make an excellent base for pills because its lower portion could be made into a gelatinous substance which could be fused with the majority of materials. Therefore, though this material could be found almost anywhere, it was something even high-ranked pills would need.</p>

  <p>In contrast, the most expensive materials were priced so impossibly high that most people couldn't find themselves possessing them. The "Winged Dragon Horn" for example, could enable the activation of illusions of remote ages, and by transcending time, warriors could attain the highest level of comprehension when they wanted.</p>

  <p>The usage of all sorts of strange materials and substances had been thoroughly studied over countless divine eras. Aside from particular forbidden areas that very few people explored, there weren't many secrets within the divine land.</p>

  <p>However, there was nothing special about the mud dug out by the Tie Clan aside from having a trace of spirit. After studying it several times, they landed on this same conclusion. In the end, Devin's uncles gave up on trying to prove its worth.</p>

  <p>Hearing Tianxing ask about it puzzled him even more. It seemed that the substance was of greater use than they expected.</p>

  <p>Not knowing why, Devin agreed to Luo Zheng because it seemed like he really needed it. He was quite easily swayed, but if his sister, Linn, were here, she would have extorted a huge amount of divine might coins from Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>As the two conversed, they followed the throng of people and entered the backyard of the Heavenly Han House.</p>

  <p>The backyard was a wide field with a building at the center. For some odd reason, the building was half buried into the ground. It resembled much of a wide well-bay, but the entrance was found on the front.</p>

  <p>Wisps of black smoke emerged from the dark entrance of the half buried structure.</p>

  <p>Zheng's nose twitched slightly as he realized someone was burning incense in this building.</p>

  <p>Once all of the proving godly warriors gathered at the backyard, a man came out from the entrance. It was the master of the Heavenly Han House Malloy, standing before them with a huge smile across his face. "I believe that it's not the first time that many of you have taken the test in our Heavenly Han House," he said. "And you all already knew a lot about the Consulting God Hall of our Heavenly Han House. However, I still wish to reiterate the rules within."</p>

  <p>Amongst the proving godly warriors that took the test of the Heavenly Han House, quite a number of them had taken the test almost a dozen times. Those who failed continuously had grown to become familiar faces in the Heavenly Han House.</p>

  <p>However, there was always a portion of warriors who took the test for the first time. For this reason, the rules were constantly reiterated because of the dangers that awaited them.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had only been in the Six-Burden Divine City for a short period of time. Although he had already done a portion of his own research, he knew he was not completely knowledgeable of everything he needed to know. He listened intently as the master of the Heavenly Han House discussed the rules.</p>

  <p>"This Consulting God Hall was built by the Holy Emperor of Han Clan.</p>

  <p>It's been twenty-three divine eras since it was built. As you might have noticed, the Consulting God Hall has sunk ten feet into the ground�"</p>

  <p>Malloy went on to say that the Consulting God Hall had a very long, intricate history. In the past, the Han Clan did not have a Holy Being.</p>

  <p>But at that time, the Holy Emperor of the Han Clan had already stepped into the consummation level of True Gods, and the Han Clan was at the top among second-tier clans.</p>

  <p>There were a total of over 300 Godly Way Tablets in the Consulting God Hall, making up of 10% of the Godly Way Tablets in the divine land. Of course, all these Godly Way Tablets in the Consulting God Hall were only imitations.</p>

  <p>Imitating Godly Way Tablets was not as simple as it seemed. Even if it were a True God who got too close to the Godly Way Tablets, they were subject to a lot of harm and injury. Although the internal momentum contained in the imitations of Godly Way Tablets could not compare to that of the genuine Godly Way Tablets, they could still test the talent of proving godly warriors. In this way, at least they could tell which Godly Way was suitable for a martial artist to cultivate.</p>

  <p>At that time, with Han Clan's strength, creating such a Consulting God Hall was definitely a challenging task. Each of the Godly Way Tablets had been carefully polished and prepped by the top-rank True Gods of the Han Clan. Moreover, the Godly Way Tablets also contained those top-rank True Gods' comprehension of the Godly Ways for good measure.</p>

  <p>Naturally, the current Han Clan didn't need the Consulting God Hall at all. This Consulting God Hall was then left to the Han Clan sub-branches, and in turn, placed under the control of the magnificent Heavenly Han House.</p>

  <p>"These imitated Godly Way Tablets have existed for far too long and their internal momentums have undergone slight changes," Malloy warned. "If you can't withstand the pressure of the internal momentum, by all means, please don't force yourself. In the past, there were always a few who forced themselves to endure it. As a result, their cultivation reduced and in the more serious cases, some died on the spot. We Heavenly Han House will take no responsibility if any incident happens," he spoke with a calm, firm tone.</p>

  <p>Considering the past events, it was necessary for him to make everyone knowledgeable of the risks.</p>

  <p>Many proving godly warriors dreamed of becoming members of the Heavenly Han House as they carried the hopes of the elders of their clans. But to some extent, some of them were unable to comprehend the internal momentum in the Godly Way Tablets and were even less likely to obtain their acknowledgements. Nonetheless, they gritted their teeth and pushed themselves as far as they could go. Eventually, their souls were shattered by the internal momentum for good.</p>

  <p>Some of the masters of the second-tier and third-tier clans were so depressed for their warriors' death that they personally went to Heavenly Han House. Although these clans dared not offend the Han Clan, it still caused chaos throughout the city and brought the Heavenly Han House into disrepute.</p>

  <p>Now, before entering the Consulting God Hall, Malloy, as the master of the Heavenly Han House, had the responsibility to warn these warriors so that they would know when enough was enough. They also had to know that if there were any casualties, the Heavenly Han House would not be held responsible. This had to be ingrained in their minds to make sure they knew what they were doing.</p>

  <p>After Malloy finished speaking, he turned to Luo Zheng. "According to the rules of the Heavenly Han House, the top-ranked warrior will be given priority to enter first. Tianxing, if you would please." As he spoke, Malloy gestured for him to enter.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded and stepped into the Consulting God Hall.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng entered the hall, the place immediately darkened and the fragrance of incense grew so powerful that it stung his nostrils.</p>

  <p>"This is the Soul-awakening Fragrance," said a voice. It was the voice of Master Evil.</p>

  <p>"What's the use of it?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Master Evil chuckled. "The Heavenly Han House has spent a lot on the test this time. The Soul-awakening Fragrance is no cheap item. It can make a person's soul more sensitive and they would become more sensitive to the internal momentum... If I recall correctly, the Heavenly Han House wasn't this generous in the past."</p>

  <p>Master Evil had never taken a test of the Heavenly Han House. When he was qualified to roam around the Vast Sky Region, he was already a low-rank True God. But the way Master Evil achieved everything was through his own exploration and trials in the divine land, which was different from the typical way the True Gods of wealthy and influential clans residing on the Floating Islands had relied on to gain their titles.</p>

  <p>Some warriors from these clans were also sent to the outside to cultivate and grow by themselves, something recognized as "free range" cultivation.</p>

  <p>With that being said, Master Evil was right in his judgment and the Han Clan sub-branches were very, very anxious. After all, it had been quite some time since an outstanding genius had appeared in the Heavenly Han House. The sixteen elites who were recommended to the Floating Island of Han Clan last time were all rejected, and the leaders of the Han Clan sub-branches were also mocked by them throughout the process.</p>

  <p>The Soul-awakening Fragrance could increase a martial artist's comprehension for a short period of time -- also considered a type of auxiliary method. The Han Clan sub-branches wanted to find a group of elites who would gain the recognition of the main Han Clan immediately.</p>

  <p>"It actually has such an effect�" Luo Zheng sniffed through the air as the strong fragrance of incense entered his nose. But for some reason, Luo Zheng didn't feel any effects on himself. All he could feel was a slight cooling sensation going through his mind, but it eventually disappeared as if it was never there to begin with.</p>

  <p>"This Soul-awakening Fragrance has a miraculous effect on Jasper Fighting Souls, but only a slight effect on Silver Fighting Souls.</p>

  <p>However, its effect on Gold Fighting Souls is almost negligible. So considering your soul level, it is obviously useless on you." Master Evil shook his head and flaunted a mischievous smile.</p>

  <p>This made sense.</p>

  <p>The soul cultivation levels of the proving godly warriors outside were extremely weak. So for sure, if the Soul-awakening Fragrance had the miraculous effect of enhancing one's comprehension, it would probably have an outstanding effect on them.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was the first to enter the Consulting God Hall, and now the Soul-awakening Fragrance was at its strongest dose.</p>

  <p>However, as a hundred thousand warriors gradually entered into the Consulting God Hall, the Soul-awakening Fragrance was being slowly absorbed by the crowd. Zheng's perk as the top in the ranks was to absorb it purely, but it went to waste as it had no effect on him whatsoever.</p>

  <p>He had only taken a few steps when the sound of hurried footsteps came up from behind him. It was the warrior who was ranked second: Zane.</p>

  <p>After Zane entered the Consulting God Hall, he sniffed greedily as if he was going to suck in all the Soul-awakening Fragrance in one inhale. All of a sudden, he caught a glimpse of Luo Zheng looking back at him and his eyes immediately darkened in expression. However, now that he had absorbed the Soul-awakening Fragrance, his mind was instantly cleared. He instantly thought about Seth's warning, and the fierce light in his eyes flashed and disappeared.</p>

  <p>However, he had a distaste for Luo Zheng that was a little too obvious. He nodded faintly towards Luo Zheng and even whispered lowly, "Those at the top of the rankings can take the best spots. You'd better remember that."</p>

  <p>With that, he walked past Luo Zheng and disappeared into the depths of the hall without another word.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng only smiled in response. He slowly made his way towards the depths of the Consulting God Hall.</p>
