<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3253 Selling Other Shore Tokens </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The three of them traveled north for a while under Jermain's guidance before they spotted a low-rise building.</p>

  <p>Many people were gathered in front of the building and seemed to be waiting for something.</p>

  <p>Jermain went to make an inquiry. Before long, he returned to them and said to Zheng, "There are two hours left before the auction starts. Looks like we'll have to wait here."</p>

  <p>"Since the Ear Mice are in charge of the auction, they will also have to purchase the Other Shore Tokens. You can sell the tokens to them," Dorothy reminded Zheng.</p>

  <p>At her words, Zheng remembered that he had a large number of Other Shore Tokens stashed away.</p>

  <p>All these Other Shore Tokens were precious treasures of the Bearing race and were of great value.</p>

  <p>Zheng had studied each of them with precise concentration. They were good, but none was particularly suited to him.</p>

  <p>He had now merged with two Other Shore Tokens, the Strength God Totem and the Eye of Will, both of which had their own uses. But he must now be very careful when he merged with the last Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>Selling the extra Other Shore Tokens was the best option he had at the moment.</p>

  <p>"The Ear Mice will buy the Other Shore Tokens, but they are very picky.</p>

  <p>They don't like ordinary Other Shore Tokens. I'll take you there," Jermain said.</p>

  <p>This was Zheng's first time in Stage Thirteen. Zheng hadn't upgraded his soul to the Indigo Soul during the Seven Mountains Meeting and could stay in Stage Four at most. That was why in Jermain's eyes, Zheng shouldn't have obtained any quality Other Shore Tokens in such a short period of time.</p>

  <p>But Jermain didn't know that Zheng had plundered a number of Other Shore Tokens from the Bearing race's temple.</p>

  <p>"Don't bother. Zheng can go by himself," Dorothy said.</p>

  <p>Jermain had probably heard all about the commotion in Stage Four and would eventually figure out his true identity if Zheng were to take out over a hundred Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>And although Dorothy trusted Jermain, she didn't want to expose Zheng's identity.</p>

  <p>Jermain was curious but didn't say anything. He merely showed Zheng the directions he had to follow.</p>

  <p>Zheng followed Jermain's instructions and walked around the small building until he found another entrance.</p>

  <p>A shrill voice sounded behind him the moment he entered it.</p>

  <p>"Human! Are you going in to sell the Other Shore Tokens?" An Ear Mouse about half the height of a man was hurrying over to him.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Follow me," the Ear Mouse squeaked.</p>

  <p>It ushered Zheng into a low house. Zheng had to bend in half to enter and move through the house.</p>

  <p>There were two other Ear Mice in the house. They greeted him and said,</p>

  <p>"Please show us the Other Shore Tokens that you have. But I must tell you that we do not accept trash. If your Other Shore Tokens are not above the fourth grade, you can just leave."</p>

  <p>"The fourth grade? Are the Other Shore Tokens graded as well?" Zheng asked, stunned.</p>

  <p>The three Ear Mice looked at each other.</p>

  <p>Zheng was looking to sell them his Other Shore Tokens without even knowing how the Other Shore Tokens were graded. Was he kidding?</p>

  <p>The Ear Mouse that had led Zheng in pointed to the door and said with an angry squeak, "You can leave if you don't even know the token grades. We are very busy and don't appreciate you wasting our time!" Its tone had suddenly become unfriendly.</p>

  <p>Zheng truly didn't know how the Other Shore Tokens were graded.</p>

  <p>He had thought that the Other Shore Tokens were graded according to where they were found. For example, the Other Shore Tokens found in Stage Two were stronger than those in Stage One, and the ones in Stage Thirteen were more powerful than those in Stage Twelve.</p>

  <p>Such a grading method was simple but not rigorous. It was true that there were many common Other Shore Tokens in Stage One, but some of them were excellent. For example, Zheng's Eye of Will was an excellent Other Shore Token from Stage One.</p>

  <p>Zheng felt helplessness seep into him at the sight of the Ear Mice trying to drive him away. He stretched out a hand, a square appearing on his fingers.</p>

  <p>An Other Shore Token had fallen out of his space ring. "I'm sorry. I really don't know how to grade the Other Shore Tokens. Please advise me on it."</p>

  <p>The Other Shore Token that Zheng had pulled out of the ring was the skull of an animal. It had sharp horns and emitted an extraordinary aura.</p>

  <p>The eyes of the three Ear Mice lit up when they saw the skull.</p>

  <p>"It's the ox skull of Stage Five!"</p>

  <p>"It is a fourth-grade token!"</p>

  <p>"We will buy it!"</p>

  <p>The three Ear Mice squeaked in unison, as if by prior agreement.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyebrows went up at their enthusiasm. He took this opportunity to ask them about the grading of the Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>"You don't even know how the grading of Other Shore Tokens works! How did you even cultivate the Indigo Soul? What a strange human you are!" one of the Ear Mice squeaked incredulously before continuing to explain the method to him. "The Other Shore Tokens are usually divided into six grades, ranked from one to six."</p>

  <p>The higher the grade of the Other Shore Tokens, the more expensive they would be. If the Other Shore Tokens were of the same grade, their stages would determine their prices.</p>

  <p>The Ear Mouse who was examining the skull piped up. "The ox skull of Stage Five is worth one hundred thousand soul pills. Will you accept it?"</p>

  <p>"Sure," Zheng agreed, nodding.</p>

  <p>The Ear Mouse pulled out one hundred thousand soul pills from its space ring and handed them over to Zheng. "Here are one hundred thousand soul pills. You can leave now."</p>

  <p>Zheng had sold just one Other Shore Token. He didn't want to leave yet.</p>

  <p>He took something else out of his space ring.</p>

  <p>"It is from Stage Six. It's of the fourth grade, worth one hundred and twenty thousand soul pills," the Ear Mouse said.</p>

  <p>"Okay." Zheng nodded again.</p>

  <p>Just as the Ear Mice had begun to think that Zheng would now leave, he took out another Other Shore Token, rendering the Ear Mice speechless.</p>

  <p>They had thought Zheng didn't have anything of substance with him. But now that he was pulling more Other Shore Tokens out of his space ring, they were shocked. One of them asked, "How many Other Shore Tokens do you want to sell? Can you take them out in one go? We have been doing business on the Other Shore for many years. We have a good reputation, and we won't cheat you."</p>

  <p>Zheng looked at each of the three Ear Mice before taking out the Other Shore Tokens from his space ring under their eager gaze.</p>

  <p>The Ear Mice hadn't taken Zheng's Other Shore Tokens seriously in the beginning. But they soon found something unusual with his tokens. The worst of the Other Shore Tokens in Zheng's space ring belonged to the fourth grade. He even had a couple of fifth-grade tokens among them!</p>

  <p>They remained calm even when Zheng took out a dozen Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>But as the pile grew, as many as sixty Other Shore Tokens in it, the three Ear Mice looked at Zheng with shock.</p>

  <p>"He doesn't even know the grading system. Where did he get so many Other Shore Tokens?"</p>

  <p>'They are from different stages. Did this guy rob a temple of some super force?'</p>

  <p>'I can't believe this! I've been buying Other Shore Tokens for so many years, but I've never seen anyone sell tokens like this!'</p>

  <p>The Ear Mice thought to themselves as they looked suspiciously at the pile of Other Shore Tokens before them.</p>

  <p>Most Souls of Light would explore a certain stage and collect the Other Shore Tokens over there. It wasn't necessary for them to explore every single stage.</p>
