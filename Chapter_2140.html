<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Humph!"</p>

  <p>The Evil God snorted, the light in his eyes shining with a cold intensity that could make his weaker adversaries retreat in fear. Specks of starlight shot out swiftly, hitting all corners of the hall.</p>

  <p>A total of nine specks of starlight had been released, corresponding to the nine stars in the sky.</p>

  <p>"He truly wants to borrow the power of the stars?" Luo Luo Zheng shook his head, raising an eyebrow in disbelief.</p>

  <p>When the Holy Beings built universes, they usually masked the nine stars. Creatures of the universes could not borrow their strength source.</p>

  <p>Holy Jay was the only among them who allowed the Collapsing Mountain race to use his strength source as they wished.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng constructed the Nine Divine Stars, he had placed the nine stars into his body in advance, without much hindrance. On his own, however, the Evil God had observed the heavenly bodies every night and developed a set of star battle techniques using his talent.</p>

  <p>Rumble!</p>

  <p>The nine stars in the sky began spinning, the motion causing a roaring sound. As they whirled, Luo Luo Zheng felt as if nearly one percent of his strength source had melted from his body.</p>

  <p>The nine dots of starlight behind the Evil God only swelled in size. They were like endlessly flowing waterfalls that inched toward him willingly.</p>

  <p>The woman beside the Evil God was now floating in the air. Her eyes were shut and her pair of soft hands were tightly clasped together. She appeared to be concentrating fervently. When she pulled her hands apart, a ray of light stretched out from between them like elastic, swiftly transforming into a purple sword.</p>

  <p>Dense Faith Energy emanated from the sword. The sword was in fact a faith weapon.</p>

  <p>As she hurled the sword toward her husband, the nine white dots entered the body of the sword. The Evil God grabbed the sword and wielded it in the air, thrusting it straight at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>In the face of this strike from the Evil God, a small smile pulled at the corners of Luo Zheng's mouth. "What a peculiar sword technique!" he exclaimed in lordly praise. "Did you create it yourself?"</p>

  <p>Saying this, Luo Luo Zheng reached out with a finger and flicked the sword before the Evil God knew it.</p>

  <p>Clatter!</p>

  <p>A loud sound rang out. Luo Luo Zheng had successfully managed to toss over the long sword to the side.</p>

  <p>The Evil God's face darkened as he retracted his sword. A ray of sword light set loose and his body flew toward Luo Luo Zheng once again. His sword strike was invincible, but Luo Luo Zheng nonchalantly extended a finger and lightly flicked the sword again.</p>

  <p>Clatter!</p>

  <p>The sword seemed to wither like a leaf as it halted in its attack and drooped down.</p>

  <p>The rhythm of the Evil God's attacks grew faster and more abrupt, but Luo Zheng's fingers retaliated in a similar fashion. A series of crisp rhythmic sounds echoed in the air as this back-and-forth exchange carried on.</p>

  <p>The Evil God had exhausted all his energy in his strikes, while Luo Luo Zheng had merely used one finger. The difference in strength between the two was beyond question.</p>

  <p>"Do you think I'm qualified now?" Luo Luo Zheng asked as he gripped the sword with two fingers this time.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the Evil God revealed a mysterious smile. "No!"</p>

  <p>The moment he finished speaking, the woman beside him, a spectator to the fight, closed her eyes. Halos appeared above her head one after the other like ripples in water.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the halos extended over to Luo Zheng's head, enveloping him within their light.</p>

  <p>"What's going on?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was stunned to see it. He suddenly felt immobilized.</p>

  <p>The halos seemed to have cut off the connection between his soul and the incarnation within his body.</p>

  <p>"You have been bested. Now go to hell!"</p>

  <p>As the Evil God's voice resounded in the air, he pushed his sword forward. The nine dots of light burst forth intensely, flashing with the intense power contained within them. They broke away from Luo Zheng's hand and turned toward his incarnation.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>The long sword pierced Luo Zheng's body, slicing him in half before he fell toward the ground with a loud thump.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's incarnation comprised chaotic energy and a thought. After his incarnation was cut off, no blood flowed out of his body. As he fell, the chaotic energy began to dissipate, rapidly vanishing from the Evil God's field of vision.</p>

  <p>"Did I succeed?"</p>

  <p>As the woman saw the God of Creation's body disappear, her eyes widened with disbelief. She had never imagined that killing the God of Creation would be as easy as falling off a log. She did it without breaking a sweat.</p>

  <p>The Evil God smirked. "As I said before, even the God of Creation has weaknesses. His kindness has determined his fate!"</p>

  <p>Before Luo Luo Zheng had arrived, the Evil God and the woman had scrutinized his personality and predicted all his possible reactions. It could be said that they had taken advantage of Luo Zheng's goodwill.</p>

  <p>Several martial artists had rebellious beings like the Evil God brewing plots and expanding in power within their inner worlds. Most martial artists dealt with these rebels by straightaway eliminating them.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, who had lost his incarnation, opened his eyes, a dumbfounded expression lingering on his face. He had been deceived by the creatures of his own inner world. Fortunately, he was the only one aware of it.</p>

  <p>Others in possession of this piece of information would be in stitches over it.</p>

  <p>Moments before, the woman had used some kind of secret technique to cut off the connection between his soul and the incarnation. Luo Luo Zheng had never anticipated it.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng only needed some chaotic energy to create an incarnation once again if he wished.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng could not just brush aside matters regarding the Evil God calmly. He must learn that his actions had consequences. Thus, Luo Luo Zheng once again closed his eyes and condensed an incarnation from within his inner world. He vanished from sight and reappeared, now standing before the Evil God once again.</p>

  <p>A smug smile still adorned the Evil God's features, who thought he had killed the God of Creation for good. However, at this moment as his gaze took in Luo Zheng's form once again, the smile froze on his face.</p>

  <p>"You can continue," Luo Luo Zheng said, smiling back faintly.</p>

  <p>The Evil God stared at Luo Luo Zheng for a long while without uttering a word.</p>

  <p>Although he was clever and astute, he did not possess any concept of the real world. It was even more impossible for him to imagine that the God of Creation was just an incarnation that could materialize at any given moment.</p>

  <p>The light in his eyes flickered as he let out a furious roar. He brandished the sword in his hand once again. The nine stars on the sword sparkled.</p>

  <p>Rays of sword light rushed out, beginning to assault Luo Luo Zheng like a tempest.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, however, turned his head and smiled at the woman. Previously, Luo Zheng's incarnation had been defeated by her theurgy. But a single glance from him rendered the woman paralyzed.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng then lifted his index finger and pointed at the sword. An irresistible force blocked it, and with a light tap of his finger, it broke into pieces.</p>

  <p>Shock surfaced on the face of the Evil God just as Luo Luo Zheng disappeared from his line of sight. Just as suddenly Luo Luo Zheng had appeared, he vanished without a trace. There were no law fluctuations. The Evil God had no way of seizing Luo Luo Zheng or his figure.</p>

  <p>"You're smart and you realize that you exist in an illusory world, but your mind is imprisoned."</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Luo Zheng's voice boomed in all directions.</p>

  <p>The Evil God looked up and around, but he still could not feel any energy fluctuations. Luo Zheng's modus operandi had completely escaped his comprehension abilities.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng's form appeared again, his knee crashed fiercely onto the face of the Evil God.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The Evil God had been struck. He plummeted and collided straight into the palace below.</p>

  <p>In this world, the Evil God's palace was known as the Palace of Marvels.</p>

  <p>The impact of the crash caused the three twenty-thousand-foot pillars in the palace to collapse like a house of cards.</p>

  <p>Smoke and dust billowed, and rubble fell. The Evil God's palace had caved in. The sight was gruesome. It was a clear sign of his defeat.</p>

  <p>The Evil God was imprisoned within the mountains. As he looked up at Luo Luo Zheng in the sky, the fire in his eyes continued to blaze and spark. Even when at the end of his road, he would not admit defeat.</p>

  <p>As for the woman imprisoned by Luo Luo Zheng, her face was deathly pale. Just as she had anticipated, her husband had suffered a crushing defeat. They had no option but to bend their knees. She had known that they were not on the same level.</p>

  <p>"I can introduce you to the real world someday, but this is not the right time," continued Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had once tried to place the creatures in his inner world into the universe rather successfully. The creatures had not lost their lives.</p>

  <p>According to his own deductions, his inner world and the divine land were on the same level, so logically, the creatures in his inner world would encounter no hindrance in entering the divine land.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing Luo Zheng's words, the previously tameless Evil God raised his head and looked at Luo Luo Zheng with hope in his eyes. "Do you truly mean it?" he asked. Eagerness etched his face.</p>
