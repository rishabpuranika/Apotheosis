  <p>
</p>

  <p>It cost each of the warriors in the audience a supreme life vitality crystal to watch the Martial Arts Contest, and they wanted to see strong warriors fighting each other.</p>

  <p>Each of the earlier matches was between an independent warrior and a disciple from various sects.</p>

  <p>Most of the independent warriors weren't real independent warriors, but instead, they were disciples from third-grade sects or clans. Comparatively, there was a huge gap between them and disciples from the fourth-grade sects.</p>

  <p>Therefore, it was easy to predict how the earlier matches would go. The battles were far from what one would consider intense.</p>

  <p>But now, Blake, one of the leading figures from a fourth-grade sect, Cloud Hall, was stepping into the arena. His opponent was one of the six disciples of the Ethereal Spirit Sect. Even before the match started, people knew this would be a terrific match!</p>

  <p>"Taking all bets! Place your bets!" shouted warriors in the audience.</p>

  <p>Whenever there was a competition, there was gambling.</p>

  <p>The second and third-grade sects and other noteworthy powers from the Central Region would hold competitions and gambles as well.</p>

  <p>However, there were many pitfalls. Some sects would set up competitions and then cheat to win. The strong warriors who could win competitions easily would lose to their opponents on purpose so that gamblers would lose lots of life vitality crystals.</p>

  <p>The Martial Arts Contest hosted by the World Commercial Alliance was less likely to have any cheating. The Dragon Soar Arena was something that all the large sects had to obtain, and the World Commercial Alliance wouldn't join forces with other large sects to cheat people just for some life vitality crystals.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the Martial Arts Contest was a playground for gamblers.</p>

  <p>A vast majority of the warriors were natural born gamblers. The several hundred thousand warriors watching the Martial Arts Contest had two main purposes; one was to observe the fighting between the geniuses, and the other was to gamble.</p>

  <p>"What are the odds? Hmm, the odds... The World Commercial Alliance seems to still be favoring Edgar from the Ethereal Spirit Sect."</p>

  <p>"Okay, I bet on Edgar. The Ethereal Spirit Sect is a fifth-grade sect after all, and is a grade stronger than Cloud Hall!"</p>

  <p>"Do you think Blake will make an easy target? Although Blake is in the early stage of Internal Elixir Realm, he once killed the Three Ghosts of the Yellow Sea on his own. His reputation shook the entire Crane Country.</p>

  <p>Those three ghosts were all warriors in the middle stage of the Internal Elixir Realm!"</p>

  <p>Many warriors began to analyze Blake and Edgar according to their past performances.</p>

  <p>After reaching the Internal Elixir Realm, elites from large sects would be entrusted with some difficult tasks. Gradually, they would be able to establish a reputation for themselves in the Central Region.</p>

  <p>Crane Country, mentioned by the warrior, was a small country in the Central Region. It was where the Auspice Sect was located. Auspice Sect was one of the five sects under Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>Back then, the Three Ghosts of the Yellow Sea escaped to Crane Country.</p>

  <p>Under the request of the Auspice Sect, Cloud Hall issued the mission. The outcome was that Blake single-handedly killed the Three Ghosts of the Yellow Sea and became famous throughout Crane Country. Thus, the Crane Country's ruler had a statue erected in honor of Blake, and Blake was dubbed the God of War. To commoners of Crane Country, Blake's existence was akin to the God of War.</p>

  <p>In comparison, Edgar of the Ethereal Spirit Sect wasn't well-known and had next to no reputation. Although the Ethereal Spirit Sect was a fifth-grade sect and had more disciples than the Cloud Hall, its disciples were not as widespread as the Cloud Hall's. After all, five second-grade sects had attached themselves to the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>Besides, each grand sect, whether Ethereal Spirit Sect, Cloud Hall, Bloodwood Cliff, or Mysterious Luna Hall, had its unique features.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, it would be impossible for them to grow into famous sects.</p>

  <p>"Aww, I'm so jealous of you, Edgar!" said Brent dejectedly. He took a deep breath and went on, "I wish I were the one fighting Blake!"</p>

  <p>Edgar patted the boy on the shoulder and comforted him by saying, "Don't be disappointed. The strongest will certainly win in the end!"</p>

  <p>"But it's so boring, just sitting here. I want to challenge someone!" commented Brent as he turned to look at the elevated platform next to his.</p>

  <p>He shouted, "Hey! Challenge me if you get a challenge card, okay?"</p>

  <p>Up on the elevated platform alongside the Ethereal Spirit Sect was Eddie's group.</p>

  <p id="top_2">Eddie glanced over and saw that a fifteen-year-old child was issuing the challenge. He smiled faintly, but didn't say anything.</p>

  <p>However, the young man beside him gave Brent a look of indifference and said, "You are quite the cocky one, aren't you?!"</p>

  <p>"Ha! The Martial Arts Contest champion will be me! But, all this waiting is getting so boring!" boasted Brent rolling his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Oh really? I'm feeling pretty bored, myself. Since we can't use the competition field right now, why don't we go out there and battle?" the young man suggested lightly. Brent was overly confident. As the son of the top person in the Central Region, the young man had the same confidence.</p>

  <p>"Brent, don't talk such nonsense. You're being extremely rude," chided Xander.</p>

  <p>Eddie smiled at Xander and said, "Xander, let the children go play with each other. You're still as stubborn as ever. Your Ethereal Spirit Sect has found a good disciple though!"</p>

  <p>Eddie had noticed Brent a while ago. Although Brent was only fifteen years old, his cultivation level was at the ultimate level of the Illuminating Soul Realm. With his cultivation level and bone age, he was shockingly further along than anyone from an average clan. But in Eddie's eyes, that wasn't serious. He did think something was different about Brent. That child seemed to be very special.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Xander gave him a careless grin, disagreeing with Eddie.</p>

  <p>The Ethereal Spirit Sect and Eddie were always disagreeing with each other. Great conflicts happened between the two. Once a talented disciple appeared in one sect, the other sects would try their best to destroy the disciple. Eddie was one example. A few decades ago, the Ethereal Spirit Sect took to suppressing Eddie. But unfortunately, the Ethereal Spirit Sect failed. Instead, Eddie rose to number one per son of the Central Region!</p>

  <p>Furthermore, it wouldn't be long until Eddie's Lustful Demon Array would take shape. If Eddie was to make a breakthrough in the Lustful Demon Array, then he wouldn't have to be afraid of anyone in the Central Region. It was something the members of the Ethereal Spirit Sect, World Commercial Alliance, and even Cloud Hall didn't want to see happen.</p>

  <p>There were rumors that Eddie wanted to build a divine kingdom in the Central Region.</p>

  <p>The divine kingdom was a country of warriors and could be considered a sixth-grade sect. That meant Eddie wanted to use his power to unify the Central Region.</p>

  <p>The Ethereal Spirit Sect was a famous sect of the Central Region. How could they be willing to bow down to anyone? Inevitably, it would be a fierce battle that would affect the entire Central Region. Although the Bloodwood Cliff, Black Mountain Sect, Mysterious Luna Hall and other fourth-grade sects seemed to get along well, they might take sides with Eddie.</p>

  <p>Within the battle arena, Blake stood still, smiling confidently.</p>

  <p>Standing before him, Edgar raised his hand slightly and said indifferently,</p>

  <p>"Blake of Cloud Hall, I've actually been waiting a long time for the chance to fight you!"</p>

  <p>"Oh? Why's that?" questioned Blake.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>A small arch of lightning shot from Edgar's hand and he replied, "I heard you comprehended the Thunder Law. I practice the cultivation methods of thunder system too. So, I want to know which one of us is stronger."</p>

  <p>Seeing the bright blue lightning dancing on Edgar's hand, Blake's eyes widened somewhat and he commented, "You seem to have grasped as much as I did!"</p>

  <p>"Look everyone! There's lightning on Edgar's hand. He must have understood at least half of the Thunder Law! What a genius!"</p>

  <p>"What a monstrous genius! Even a warrior at the Virtual Tribulation Realm would barely be able to understand half of the Thunder Law. I never thought Edgar would be able to do it at the Internal Elixir Realm!"</p>

  <p>"The Ethereal Spirit Sect's resources are truly unimaginable! It's truly a sect of talented people!"</p>

  <p>Sitting there meditating, Luo Luo Zheng felt forceful energy flowing through his body slowly and filling every cell while the life vitality in his belly churned continuously. The forceful energy and the life vitality were different, like two distinct rivers in Luo Zheng's body, and neither of them was in contact with the other.</p>

  <p>Maintaining the state would allow Luo Luo Zheng to practice two forms of cultivation at the same time.</p>

  <p>Amidst the warriors' heated discussion, Luo Luo Zheng cracked his eyes open, and peeked over in time to see two layers of lightning flashing from Blake's and Edgar's bodies.</p>

  <p>'They both have Thunder Law in their lightning. Blake's Thunder Law is slightly more abundant, but Edgar's Mu Ning is a bit stronger. Blake's chances of winning will be better than Edgar's!' thought Luo Luo Zheng as he watched the arena indifferently.</p>

  <p>However, it didn't matter whether it was Blake or Edgar who won. Their understanding of the Thunder Law couldn't compare to Luo Zheng's knowledge of it.</p>

  <p>Every form of Law Power was divided in ten layers.</p>

  <p>The Thunder Law these two wielded was only about halfway into the first layer, but Luo Luo Zheng had already completely mastered the first layer of the Thunder Law.</p>
