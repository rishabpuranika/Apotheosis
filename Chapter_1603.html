</p>

  <p>Seeing Yudie's puzzled expression, the martial artist explained in a deadpan voice, "The value of the Roaring Token cannot be measured in terms of life vitality crystals. It is impossible for ordinary martial artists to buy it. If one wants to buy it, I think it will cost millions of life vitality jades at least."</p>

  <p>"Millions of life vitality jades?" exclaimed Ning Yudie, quite stunned at the implication of this cost.</p>

  <p>Although Ning Yudie had only recently ascended to the Upper World, she had heard that the sacred place required warriors to mine hundreds of life vitality jades in exchange for their freedom.</p>

  <p>A single life vitality jade could be exchanged for over 10, 000 supreme life vitality crystals.</p>

  <p>So millions of life vitality jades were equivalent to hundreds of millions of supreme life vitality crystals!</p>

  <p>Ever since the Cloud Hall and the World Commercial Alliance had united the Central Region, and her master had returned to the Cloud Hall, the Cloud Hall had become more and more prosperous with each passing day. With the support of the World Commercial Alliance, the hall had amassed a large number of life vitality crystals.</p>

  <p>Before her ascension to the Upper World, her master, Imogen, had gifted her half of the supreme life vitality crystals that the Cloud Hall had accumulated, in case she needed them in the Upper World.</p>

  <p>Now she had around 200, 000 supreme life vitality crystals with her, safely locked away in her space ring.</p>

  <p>Just a moment ago, she was still considering whether she should buy two Roaring Tokens; however, when she heard the martial artist's explanation, she was utterly shocked.</p>

  <p>So the great wealth of the 200, 000 supreme life vitality crystals that she had brought with her was nothing in the Upper World! Where she had previously thought herself wealthy, she now felt like a pauper!</p>

  <p>The truth was that when the martial artist had explained that the Roaring Token was worth hundreds of millions of supreme life vitality crystals, he had been simplifying the matter to make her understand the priceless cost of the Roaring Token. He had reduced its value by 10 times.</p>

  <p>It couldn't be blamed on him. After all, the Roaring Token was considered a priceless treasure in the Upper World, and most martial artists would rarely see such a token in their entire lives. Only world lords and Supreme Lords were given the right to use it. That martial artist had only given Ning Yudie an estimated value of the Roaring Token.</p>

  <p>"Of course, the Saint Lord of the Pure Jade Sacred Place and many world lords are sure to have one or two Roaring Tokens in their hands." The martial artist shook his head, his eyes revealing an expression of adoration. Compared to the Saint Lords of the sacred places, martial artists like him were nothing but dirt.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie pursed her lips and a bleak look of depression appeared on her face. She hadn't expected to find the Roaring Token, but she felt that it sounded a little familiar. She had heard of it somewhere before, and being unable to purchase one, she felt let down.</p>

  <p>The martial artist then sighed. "However, strange things do happen in this universe. A few years ago, a guy named  Luo Zheng Luo told stories via the Roaring Token. Yet, it is said that he has only reached the Soul Sea Realm. No one knows where he has gotten a Roaring Token that can be used for an unlimited number of times. Such a Roaring Token is beyond priceless!"</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Ning Yudie was stunned, and she felt excited at the mention of Zheng's name.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng Luo?" she asked in a louder voice while staring at the martial artist in anticipation.</p>

  <p>The other martial artists around her, including the woman in red beside her, turned to look at her curiously.</p>

  <p>It was fortunate that the fat woman was not there. Otherwise, she would have scolded Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>"Ning Yudie, what's wrong?" the lady in red asked when she saw Yudie's expression.</p>

  <p>That martial artist chuckled and continued, "Yeah. That guy is a regular feature in the limelight now. Everyone in the universe knows about him.</p>

  <p>It's said that he ascended from the Lower World, and that he owns a fairy palace. He has even used that fairy palace to kill several Supreme Lords."</p>

  <p>In the eyes of many grassroots martial artists, Luo Zheng had become a legendary figure, someone to look up to, and someone to try and beat one day.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Zheng had ascended from the Lower World, it meant that he did not have strong backing in the Upper World. For a lowly martial artist of the Soul Sea Realm to leave many forces and even Supreme Lords helpless was a miracle in itself!</p>

  <p>Anecdotes of Luo Zheng continued to spread among the grassroots martial artists, and many of them even overstated facts and made up stories.</p>

  <p>Soon the legend became even greater than the man, even though the man was truly exceptional. Such was how legends were born.</p>

  <p>"In the past few years, that guy has told quite a few interesting stories.</p>

  <p>For example, Killing the Snake Spirit, and…" While the martial artist was speaking, he beamed with excitement, as if he had personally seen Luo Zheng perform.</p>

  <p>When Ning Yudie heard the name ' Luo Zheng Luo', her first reaction was that she had heard wrong, and her second thought was that the name might be a duplicate of Zheng's.</p>

  <p>After all, there were so many martial artists in the universe. It was not surprising that some of them might have similar names.</p>

  <p>When she heard the mention of the 'fairy palace', she had already confirmed her suspicions though. It was true that Luo Zheng was able to enter and exit the fairy palace freely after obtaining the token of mountain. It was true that the fairy palace was magical, but how could Luo Zheng use it to kill Supreme Lords?</p>

  <p>In the past six years, Ning Yudie had even been to the valley in the Eastern Region, but she found that the exit had already disappeared.</p>

  <p>However, when she now heard the mention of the story "Killing the Snake Spirit", she knew without a doubt that the story was told by her husband Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>This story "Killing the Snake Spirit" was one of the stories that circulated in the Eastern Region. Ning Yudie had heard of it before, as it was widely spread in the Eastern Region.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had brought along a fairy palace, and he had told the story "Killing the Snake Spirit".</p>

  <p>With all these pieces of information, Ning Yudie was 100% certain that the  Luo Zheng Luo that the martial artist had mentioned was her husband, Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The Roaring Token!</p>

  <p>It wasn't until then that she recalled that one of the three treasures Luo Zheng had gotten from his master was the Roaring Token.</p>

  <p>However, even Luo Zheng himself did not know the purpose of the Roaring Token at that time.</p>

  <p>As the woman in red saw that Ning Yudie was getting more and more excited, she asked, "Ning Yudie, are you okay?"</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie pursed her lips, as she came to grips with the revelations about her husband and his miraculous achievements.</p>

  <p>Just then, a noise came from the front of the hall.</p>

  <p>All the martial artists were staring up at the huge pyramid which tracked the standing of the martial artists in the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng Luo has actually improved his ranking from a bit over the 9, 000th to the 130th!"</p>

  <p>"He has such unmatched strength. He is probably going to rush straight to the top!"</p>

  <p>"That's not the case. The further he goes, the more difficult it will become. The warriors in front of him are the ace talents from the various races. How could he surpass them so easily?"</p>

  <p>The martial artist who had been talking to Ning Yudie laughed, looked at the pyramid and said, "It's the  Luo Zheng Luo I talked about earlier. I heard that some said that he was just lucky and had inherited a magical fairy palace, but that he was actually weak and not talented. Now that he has risen so fast, and he has already reached the 130th place, it's really surprising! I even thought that he would just be one of the top 10, 000. But now look..."</p>

  <p>Zheng's name...</p>

  <p>Although the pyramid was not very close, Ning Yudie could still clearly see the names written on it.</p>

  <p>At first, she had searched along the top of the pyramid, but she didn't find Zheng's name, so she had given up.</p>

  <p>The pyramid represented the rankings of all the martial artists at the Soul Sea Realm in the entire universe, but there were also trillions of martial artists in the Illusion Battlefield; hence, it was unlikely that Zheng's name could be found on it.</p>

  <p>Now, with a sweep of her eyes, Ning Yudie found Zheng's name floating somewhere near the top of the pyramid.</p>

  <p>"It's said that there are trillions of martial artists at the Soul Sea Realm in the Illusion Battlefield, right?" asked Ning Yudie suddenly, her eyes still resting on Zheng's name. "With his ranking, he should be able to enter the Clear Spirit Force House to cultivate, right?"</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha..." The martial artist broke into laughter. After sizing up Ning Yudie, he asked, "Did you ascend from the Lower World?"</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie nodded. Although she knew that there were over a hundred thousand supreme worlds in the Upper World, she did not have a thorough understanding of them yet. The tenth-grade Clear Spirit Sacred Place was in her limited understanding a paradise.</p>

  <p>The martial artist then said, "No wonder. For a powerhouse like Luo Zheng, even the famous thirteen palaces cannot accommodate him, not to mention the Clear Spirit Sacred Place. It is said that after he ascended, he immediately left the tenth-grade sacred place and was accepted into the thirteen palaces. Now that he has obtained such a ranking, he can already be considered an ace talent in the Humanity Alliance."</p>

  <p>"Oh? Really?" Yudie's face lit up with a proud smile.</p>

  <p>In the Central Region, Ning Yudie had held absolute confidence in her husband.</p>

  <p>But it was different in the Upper World, where there were many ace talents. She hadn't dared to hold too high an expectation of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, she never thought that in just six years, Luo Zheng had already achieved such a great achievement. The news that she had just heard was far beyond her wildest imagination, and also far beyond her expectations for Luo Zheng. At the same time, it gave her the confidence and inspiration to find Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Ning Yudie, why do you ask so many details? Do you know this warrior?" the woman in red asked from beside her.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie had a smile on her face as she looked up at the pyramid and said,</p>

  <p>"Have you forgotten what I told you? I flew here to find my husband."</p>

  <p>The woman in red was still puzzled. "I know. So what?"</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie said excitedly, "My husband flew here six years ago. His name is  Luo Zheng Luo, and if I guess correctly, he is the man at the top of the pyramid!"</p>

  <p>Although her voice wasn't loud, the woman in red and the martial artist clearly heard what she said. The two of them stared at her with widened eyes, their expressions filled with disbelief.</p>
