  <p>
</p>

  <p>Being able to change both the position and direction of the unimaginably enormous divine land was quite an incredible, unbelievable feat.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, however, was extraordinary and he accomplished it quite easily, merely by relying on several rings.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng could only sigh with emotion and continue believing that the person who built the divine land had been ingenious enough to create such an exceptional method.</p>

  <p>At that very moment, Luo Zheng had an overwhelming sense of accomplishment.</p>

  <p>"But what power does the divine land rely on in order to fly within the chaos?" Luo Zheng wondered aloud.</p>

  <p>Among these seven rings, two of them were above his head and would provide him with the vastest of views.</p>

  <p>Four more small rings, located on both his hands and feet, controlled the position of the divine land during its flight.</p>

  <p>The final ring encircled his waist.</p>

  <p>This time, Luo Zheng released his spiritual sense without a moment's hesitation and infused it directly into the ring!</p>

  <p>As soon as Luo Zheng was closely connected with the ring around his waist, he immediately felt four waves of immense energy fluctuations!</p>

  <p>"These energy fluctuations are so terrifying..." he uttered to himself.</p>

  <p>Such tremendous energy fluctuations were completely above Luo Zheng's level of understanding. Describing how powerful the four energy waves were was beyond words. Luo Zheng was slightly shocked.</p>

  <p>And he clearly felt that these four forces came from the four corners of the divine land!</p>

  <p>'The Ray Tree, Sunrest Tree, Hidden Tree, and the Lofty Tree!</p>

  <p>I can summon the four great divine trees' power with this ring! These forces could drive the entire divine land into movement! So, that explains it... The four divine trees are like this ship's driving power. Or, perhaps they are the ship's paddles. They provide constant energy in order to make it possible for the divine land to travel within the chaos!'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>The Dongfang Clan, Sword Clan, and the Moon Clan on the other hand, were a different story.</p>

  <p>Although the three clans had respectively occupied the Ray Tree, Sunrest Tree and the Hidden Tree, they had only obtained some support of the divine trees, and thus, couldn't use divine trees' power themselves.</p>

  <p>If one ever wanted to use the four divine trees, then they'd have to use the ring that was currently around his waist!</p>

  <p>After all the pieces of the puzzle had come together and he had a thorough understanding of what had occurred, everything seemed to become simple and clear.</p>

  <p>With the help of the ring around his waist, Luo Zheng released the four divine trees' energy all at once.</p>

  <p>It only took a few brief seconds before four streams of intense energy suddenly spurted from the four corners of the divine land directly into the lower part of the chaos!</p>

  <p>The four currents flowed in different colors. As they started to spurt, the falling speed of the divine land slowed down at a visible rate.</p>

  <p>"What an incredibly powerful strength..." Luo Zheng couldn't help but state.</p>

  <p>The four forces directly offset the divine land's falling inertia, causing it to halt in the chaos. At the same time, it rose very gradually!</p>

  <p>"This is incredibly amazing!" Luo Zheng said excitedly.</p>

  <p>He had officially accomplished the task that Harold had entrusted him with. A satisfied feeling washed over him.</p>

  <p>All he needed to do now was wait patiently! The easiest part of it all.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng hadn't left the rings yet. He was still looking down at the divine land, watching attentively as it gradually rose.</p>

  <p>A split-second later though, he suddenly perceived a red light flashing beneath him...</p>

  <p>When mortals looked up at the stars in the universe, they only saw them as big as a needle's head because they were too far away. In reality though, the stars were countless times larger than what they had imagined.</p>

  <p>Amongst the chaos, the distance had been magnified by at least a hundred thousand times, and could even be magnified a million times!</p>

  <p>The red light was coming from the top of a beast's bone at the bottom of the chaos. Luo Zheng could see it easily now, with just a simple glance downward. The light was incredibly bright and shone radiantly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng continued looking at the light curiously and he noticed a red light band spreading out from it. This red light band rapidly spread toward the divine land at an unimaginably fast speed!</p>

  <p>"What is that? How can it be travelling so fast?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes widened as he spoke aloud.</p>

  <p>There was still a long distance dividing the divine land and the bottom of the chaos!</p>

  <p>And yet, in less than five minutes, this red light had crossed an endless distance. It was quickly sweeping toward the divine land!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng couldn't figure out what this red light band was. That said, it didn't look like a good omen at all.</p>

  <p>"Hurry up! Run!" Luo Zheng clenched his jaw and obeyed his own command.</p>

  <p>Through the ring around his waist, he pushed on the four divine trees in order to make them unleash even more energy.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, for such a huge and unimaginable place like the divine land, increasing or decreasing speed was actually a very long process.</p>

  <p>No matter how Luo Zheng activated the extra energy, the divine land continued creeping upward at a snail's pace.</p>

  <p>And clearly, the speed at which the light band spread was much faster than that of the divine land!</p>

  <p>Two hours later, Luo Zheng was still watching the scene play out before him, and the red light band finally circled the surface of the divine land. It was like a small snake that winded its way around the surface.</p>

  <p>After another two hours had passed, the red light band had completely circled around the divine land.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was helpless. He couldn't do anything at all except watch with his own two eyes.</p>

  <p>Before he had adjusted the direction of the divine land, the divine land had been falling, and it probably had kept falling down for many divine eras.</p>

  <p>Over all that period of time, he had never seen any red light band before.</p>

  <p>He'd just adjusted the direction of the divine land in order to avoid it from crashing when the band of light suddenly appeared beneath him. It quickly entangled itself with the divine land.</p>

  <p>Was it a coincidence?</p>

  <p>"Someone doesn't want the divine land to leave, huh?..." Luo Zheng muttered to himself.</p>

  <p>But what kind of creature could possibly exist at the bottom of all the chaos? What could be its purpose? What was it doing down there?</p>

  <p>Was the person who released the light band on Nicholas' side? Or perhaps it was a powerful master of the Other Shore Realm who also supported Nicholas...</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng made countless guesses in his mind. He was quick to come up with different ideas.</p>

  <p>Originally, he had been immersed in the joy of completing his mission.</p>

  <p>As he noticed the scene though, he had immediately felt that his efforts might have been in vain.</p>

  <p>All he could do however, was continue trying to activate the energy within the four divine trees, in an attempt to shake the red light band away.</p>

  <p>As the divine land continued to rise, the light band straightened out.</p>

  <p>However, no matter how Luo Zheng erupted the energy from the four divine trees, or even used both his hands and feet to make the divine land move left, right, up, and down, he was unable to tear the red light band in half.</p>

  <p>All he succeeded in doing was ensuring that the divine land remained in its exact current position, floating amongst the chaos.</p>

  <p>"All of this is going to cause a lot of trouble."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked and felt helpless.</p>

  <p>In Luo Zheng's attempt to shake the band of light off, it had also caused a certain degree of chaos in the divine land.</p>

  <p>After all, the violent shaking of the divine land was bound to still cause a great deal of trouble. Certain sources of water such as the great rivers and lakes poured ragingly, forming a torrent. Even a portion of the colorful sea water in the Time Sea surged outward!</p>

  <p>Both the divine citizens and the True Gods were tingling with agitation.</p>

  <p>They couldn't help it.</p>

  <p>Harold and Yan, who were both waiting in the Sunrest Tree, looked at each other in dismay.</p>

  <p>"Why is the divine land trembling so violently? Are we having a quake?"</p>

  <p>Yan asked at once.</p>

  <p>"I'm not sure, to be honest. It's strange, really," Harold said with a frown.</p>

  <p>Though Harold had never left the divine land, he knew more things than quite a few Holy Beings, thanks to his master.</p>

  <p>Without a doubt however, such a substantial shake in the divine land was absolutely abnormal! The only thought that crossed his mind was: what the hell Luo Zheng could have encountered when he was controlling the divine land?</p>

  <p>After trying several times, Luo Zheng finally chose to give up. He was out of options.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng took back his spiritual sense from the seven rings, they directed themselves back to the ground, inlaid just as they formerly had been.</p>
