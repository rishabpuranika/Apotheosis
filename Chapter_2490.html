  <p>
</p>

  <p>Noticing that Lorena took a fancy to his sword, Harper narrowed his eyes and held the ancient sword tighter in his arms.</p>

  <p>"Mike already got the Soaring Snake Sword, and now you want to take my sword too? No way!" Harper yelled.</p>

  <p id="top_10">Lorena looked at him innocently. "I didn't say I wanted this sword."</p>

  <p>Harper breathed a sigh of relief but what Lorena said next made him nervous again.</p>

  <p>"However, the Shadow Bearing Sword is a perfect match with Truth of Goodwill and Malice. If you pass the Truth of Goodwill and Malice on to Zheng and give this sword to him, it will be great."</p>

  <p>"Bullshit! Don't even think about taking my sword!"</p>

  <p>The mere thought of Lorena wanting his sword was enough to set him off.</p>

  <p>Zheng and Yan also looked at each other helplessly. They wouldn't be able to get a word in this conversation at all.</p>

  <p>"Harper," said Lorena seriously. "Have you ever thought that we will return to the Source World one day?"</p>

  <p>"Duh, of course I have," said Harper, rolling his eyes.</p>

  <p>To ordinary people, the divine land was extremely large. It was an entire world.</p>

  <p>There were many True Gods and most of them didn't care about anything outside the divine land. They only knew the divine land their whole lives.</p>

  <p>They only knew its countless regions and divine cities.</p>

  <p>But, Harper and Lorena were from the Source World.</p>

  <p>They knew that the Source World was the center of the chaos and that the divine land was created by Chiyou. It could form an entire circulatory system as well as produce many inconceivable creatures. But so what? No matter how perfect the divine land was, it was just a ship.</p>

  <p>Harper had dreamed of going back to the Source World.</p>

  <p>He even regretted getting on the ship. He'd much rather die in the Source World than live in the divine land.</p>

  <p>"Father said our hope would be born on this ship one day," said Lorena.</p>

  <p>"Then the hope should be born into the Nine Li race. But every one of them was killed," Harper retorted.</p>

  <p>All of the Nine Li people were descendants of Nine Li race's nine tribes, and among them were Chiyou's descendants. They hoped that one day a child would be born from the Nine Li race and would have the purest bloodline of Chiyou. They had been working in the depths of chaos and shouldered the burden of rebuilding the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>This plan had its merits. Even if the Nine Li race in the Source World was exterminated, the fire of hope could still be preserved in the divine land.</p>

  <p>But with the pursuit of the Yellow Emperor Guards, their hope was completely lost.</p>

  <p>The Nine Li race, which was also called the Sacred race, was slaughtered.</p>

  <p>For years, Harper had lived in despair.</p>

  <p>Even though he had created the debate venue, it was only a try in despair.</p>

  <p>He just didn't want to see the divine land crash.</p>

  <p>As for returning to the Source World?</p>

  <p>It hurt but he knew that that day would never come.</p>

  <p>"Isn't Zheng a member of the Nine Li race?" Lorena asked.</p>

  <p>Harper was stunned by her question.</p>

  <p>Chiyou's blood ran pure in Zheng's veins. The moment he touched the Sunrest Tree, Harper had noticed it.</p>

  <p>But so what if he had the purest Chiyou's blood?</p>

  <p>Harper once had this kind of blood before.</p>

  <p>"Him? He can only be counted as half a member of Nine Li race at best.</p>

  <p>Have you forgotten that his father is not a member of our race?" Harper retorted.</p>

  <p>Now he was making trouble out of nothing.</p>

  <p>Lorena stared at Harper for quite a while. Her face darkened. "This ship could have carried the hope of our race, but now you have chosen to turn a blind eye to it. My father made a mistake in choosing you as the captain of this ship!"</p>

  <p>As soon as she finished speaking, she turned to Zheng. "Zheng, Yan, let's go!</p>

  <p>Coming here was useless."</p>

  <p>As she spoke, her long hair floated in the air and coiled around Zheng and Yan.</p>

  <p>But Harper was moved by her speech. He extended his arm and made a pressing motion. An invisible force came down from the top of the well and blocked Lorena.</p>

  <p>"Maybe you are right," Harper said bitterly. "Maybe your father picked the wrong person. I'm not determined enough. But there were so many young men of the Nine Li race, nine leaders, and a hundred thousand Nine Li Guards, and yet they all failed. How can I possibly believe that a low-rank True God will succeed?"</p>

  <p>"Zheng has created the Thousand Sanskrit Land before he even reaches the Other Shore Realm," Lorena reminded him.</p>

  <p>"So what?! Is a Thousand Sanskrit Land a remarkable feat for someone of Nine Li race? Lorena, you were little when you left the Source World and since then, you've spent most of your time in the divine land. You don't know what the Source World is like. There are some talents that you can't imagine," Harper said.</p>

  <p>Lorena was silent.</p>

  <p>She truly did know little about the Source World.</p>

  <p>"However, as long as there's a glimmer of hope, even if it's a one in a trillion possibility, I'll try it," Harper suddenly said lightly, eyes glinting with hope and mild determination. "I'm afraid I am not as determined as you or that reckless Mike, though."</p>

  <p>He then looked at Zheng indifferently. "When your mother gave the Soaring Snake Sword to Mike, I didn't oppose that strongly. I wanted to see what tricks he was going to do with it. But I didn't expect that the Shadow Bearing Sword that has accompanied me my entire life could no longer stay with me."</p>

  <p>He held the sword tightly in his hand, and the rest watched as his aura changed drastically.</p>

  <p>He was like a dead tree that suddenly bore healthy green shoots, the rotten air around his body disappearing.</p>

  <p>As he slowly raised the Shadow Bearing Sword, the Sunrest Tree and the Truth of Goodwill and Malice in the debate venue also changed.</p>

  <p>The whole Non-combat Zone also changed dramatically.</p>

  <p>Concurrently in the Famous Sword Divine City, some top-rank True Gods raised their heads and looked in the direction of the Sunrest Tree in the west.</p>

  <p>"What's going on? Why did the aura suddenly change?"</p>

  <p>"What a strong will!"</p>

  <p>"What happened in the Sword Clan?"</p>

  <p>Many True Gods thought the Non-combat Zone was a Sword Clan's arrangement.</p>

  <p>Even in the Sword Clan, only a very small number of people knew the truth about the debate venue.</p>

  <p>Hayden stood on the top of the tower and looked at the huge Sunrest Tree in the distance. Doubt filled his eyes. This was not normal.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>Marley was also flabbergasted. "The aura from the Non-combat Zone is no longer useful! And it could no longer suppress the malice in one's mind. What happened to the Sunrest Tree?"</p>

  <p>He also thought the Non-combat Zone was formed by the Sunrest Tree.</p>

  <p>In the countless divine eras, the Non-combat Zone had never failed to suppress the killing intent even for a second. But that wasn't the case now.</p>

  <p>Something was wrong.</p>
