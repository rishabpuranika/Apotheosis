<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Gallio did not pay heed to Zheng and the people with him. He concentrated on the transmission door instead.</p>

  <p>The moment Nicholas led the Holy Beings and the consummate True Gods to walk out of the transmission channel, Gallio's deep loud voice rang out.</p>

  <p>"Everyone! It's time to fight!"</p>

  <p>Thousands of Abyss Demons dashed forward, their bodies flashing with golden lights that could protect them from the power of internal momentum.</p>

  <p>The Abyss Demons weren't strong enough to fight the Holy Beings. They were even inferior to consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>But they had certain talents that were unique to them and which could prove to be extremely troublesome to deal with.</p>

  <p>Nicholas had just stepped out of the transmission channel when he saw the advancing charge. His face hardened as his gaze fell on Gallio in the far distance.</p>

  <p>"Consummate True Gods, you deal with these Abyss Demons!</p>

  <p>Everyone else, kill the fiends!</p>

  <p>Murphy, Jeremiah, Clark - follow me!"</p>

  <p>The members of the alliance of the powerful clans on the Floating Islands were not always close to each other. But Murphy, Jeremiah, and Clark were ones whom Nicholas trusted most in the alliance.</p>

  <p>At Nicholas's orders, the three Holy Beings leaped into air, turned into three streaks of light, and flew towards Gallio.</p>

  <p>As they flew over the Desperation Plain, dozens of giant birds gathered in the sky, blocking their way from afar. But before the birds could do anything, they burst into flames and fell out of the sky, crying shrilly.</p>

  <p>Clark looked rather indifferently at the giant birds. He knew that the birds couldn't have stopped them anyway.</p>

  <p>Gallio stood there motionlessly, watching as the three Holy Beings rushed towards him.</p>

  <p>Rachelle and a few other consummate True Gods had transformed into a streak of blood light and rushed toward the Desperation Plain.</p>

  <p>But as she stepped into the Desperation Plain, she felt the life force within her body quickly consumed.</p>

  <p>But at her current cultivation level, she was full of life force.</p>

  <p>The rate that her life force was being consumed at the moment was not a big deal.</p>

  <p>A crack sounded, and an Abyss Demon's body was cut in half.</p>

  <p>With their levels of strength, the Abyss Demons were simply incapable of facing off against the consummate True Gods, but they didn't fear any kind of theurgy, which meant that they could only be dealt with one by one.</p>

  <p>Troy strode forward. A casual pinch of his iron hand left an Abyss Demon beheaded in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>The other consummate True Gods also began to take action.</p>

  <p>The Demi-Holy Beings and the other Holy Beings merely ignored the Abyss Demons, since their goal was to kill the fiends.</p>

  <p>Nicholas stood before Gallio, unmoving.</p>

  <p>The difference in their sizes was so huge that it looked like a mosquito was facing off against an elephant.</p>

  <p>But one was the most powerful warrior of the human race, while the other was the most powerful among the fiends.</p>

  <p>Nicholas remained calm. "Let me control the Abyss Demon Region. You fiends can still spread your hegemony over this place."</p>

  <p>Gallio glared at the four Holy Beings before him as if they were four little worms.</p>

  <p>At Nicholas's words, Gallio grinned and said, "The Abyss Demon Region belongs to our friends in the first place. Do you think I will allow you to control this place?"</p>

  <p>"I only need the power of the Abyss Demon Region. I won't interfere with anything else," Nicholas said.</p>

  <p>Gallio chuckled as if he had heard a ridiculous joke. "The power here will always belong to the fiends. You human beings are nothing but ants!"</p>

  <p>Nicholas smiled coldly at the huge fiend standing before him, and said,</p>

  <p>"Then I'll show you the power of us ants."</p>

  <p>His voice had barely petered out when Nicholas acted on his word.</p>

  <p>Streams of internal momentum buzzed and spread out of Nicholas's hand.</p>

  <p>They formed runes which quickly gathered together and turned into a golden sword.</p>

  <p>"This sword!"</p>

  <p>Clark and Murphy froze.</p>

  <p>Nicholas rarely used weapons and the power contained in this sword was terrifying. This sword had been formed by such a complicated internal momentum that even the two Holy Beings couldn't see through it.</p>

  <p>"I'm not interested in seeing the power of ants! You can all die!"</p>

  <p>Gallio flipped his hand and a huge black sphere appeared in it.</p>

  <p>He sent it flying towards the heads of the Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>Clark snorted contemptuously. The fire burned hot, crawled up his feet, and spread out all over his body. His body was now completely covered in fire.</p>

  <p>"Indestructible Fire Body!"</p>

  <p>Clark activated his Indestructible Fire Body and waved both his hands, shooting out a madly spinning fireball from them.</p>

  <p>Murphy also drew out a black sword. A powerful internal momentum emanated from the sword, spreading in all directions. The internal momentum then charged ferociously at Gallio.</p>

  <p>Once a Holy Being made a move, the momentum was overwhelming and had the power to destroy the world.</p>

  <p>What was more, these Holy Beings were the strongest in the divine land.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>Clark's and Murphy's attacks converged, causing the collective energy to condense.</p>

  <p>Even though the Space Law in the Abyss Demon Region was nonexistent, the surrounding space began to collapse at this moment.</p>

  <p>On the Desperation Plain, the alliance of the powerful clans on the Floating Islands and the fiends were entangled in a fierce battle.</p>

  <p>The fiend commander who had faced Zheng had already been beheaded.</p>

  <p>Leland looked at Zheng in astonishment. He could not believe what he was seeing.</p>

  <p>Strong streams of internal momentum and powerful auras came Leland's way but didn't affect him.</p>

  <p>Zheng had earlier stomped on Begaus and crushed him. Zheng's abilities were amazing, and there was no doubt about it.</p>

  <p>Even Leland couldn't defeat the fiend commander, whose strength was comparable to that of the peak-level Demi-Holy Beings. But now, Zheng had killed him with just one sword strike!</p>

  <p>The internal momentum contained in Zheng's strike was complicated, as if it contained hundreds of Godly Ways. Leland couldn't believe his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Let's go," Zheng said as his gaze swept across the Desperation Plain.</p>

  <p>While tangled in the chaos, he had noticed Tianming locked in a fierce battle against the Abyss Demons. .</p>

  <p>'I'm sorry I can't accompany you to explore the Abyss Demon Region, ' Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>He released the strange fish. They then took a detour along the side of the Desperation Plain and flew towards the space door.</p>

  <p>As the alliance of the powerful clans on the Floating Islands were engaged in the fierce fight, they hardly had any time to pay attention to Zheng and his companions.</p>

  <p id="top_27">They soon arrived at the space door.</p>

  <p>It was then that Rachelle, who had just killed several Abyss Demons, noticed Zheng. Her beautiful eyes filled with disbelief.</p>

  <p>"Zheng? Why is he here?"</p>

  <p>Zheng had probably felt Rachelle's gaze on him. The moment Zheng stepped into the space door, he turned and smiled at her.</p>

  <p>Rachelle's heart sank. She wanted to stop him, but on second thought, she knew she was no match for him now. What was more, the elders of the clan were fighting fiercely with the fiends on the Desperation Plain.</p>

  <p>This was an once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Rachelle didn't want to see Zheng leave just like that.</p>

  <p>Zheng stepped into the space door, but nothing happened. It looked like the door had stopped working!</p>
