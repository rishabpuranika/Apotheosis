<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2127 The Village Leader (Part Two) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Back then, Luo Zheng suddenly appeared in their remote mountain village. He taught them martial art skills and helped them resist the Sun Moon Village's attacks. It was no doubt that he had done a lot for them. Now, they also wanted him to destroy the Sun Moon Village, which seemed a bit unreasonable.</p>

  <p>The entire house suddenly quieted down. No one dared to take the initiative to ask Luo Zheng for help.</p>

  <p>At the corner of the house, Luo Zheng looked at the ceiling and said, "I will stay in the Misty Mountain Village for another fifteen days, and then I will leave. Thanks for treating me in a friendly way these last few days. If the warriors of the Sun Moon Village dare to come here again, I will help you punish them."</p>

  <p>That was the guarantee Luo Zheng could give. He did not know much about the Sun Moon Village, but he discovered that they weren't actually powerful warriors. Thus, he believed that their leader wasn't that strong as well.</p>

  <p>Even if Luo Zheng couldn't use the chaotic energy for now, it shouldn't be hard for him to deal with them.</p>

  <p>However, he also guessed that there must be a higher-level force behind the Sun Moon Village. If such a force was a True God, Zheng's current strength wouldn't allow him to effectively fight back. He would be in trouble.</p>

  <p>He didn't want to enter the divine land and be chased around by a group of True Gods. If he wasn't careful, he might lose his life. That was not what he wanted.</p>

  <p>Once Luo Zheng was done speaking, he closed his eyes again. The house was slowly filled with the villagers' whispers once more.</p>

  <p>Since the warriors of the Sun Moon Village had been killed on this day, and their people were known to be domineering, it wouldn't be a surprise if they came to get back at the villagers of the Misty Mountain Village the next day. In any case, Zheng's promise was already the greatest help to the Misty Mountain Village.</p>

  <p>Nightfall came and clothed the whole village in a blanket of darkness. It was time to rest, but the people of the Misty Mountain Village were all nervous.</p>

  <p>The next day, Luo Zheng remained calm and unperturbed. He continued to teach Thomson and Woolley to practice the swordsmanship.</p>

  <p>As Thomson practiced his movements, his eyes suddenly went wide open and then he quickly told Luo Zheng, "Actually, you should leave the Misty Mountain Village now!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was naturally confused at the boy's words which came out of the blue. "Why do you say that?" he asked with a smile.</p>

  <p>"The Sun Moon Village will not let you and all of the villagers off, and you are the only one who would resist them. I'm afraid..." he trailed off and lines of worry began to make their way to his face.</p>

  <p>Woolley and the others probably had the same thought. They knew that Zheng's background was definitely special and that he had been forced to hide in the Misty Mountain Village. It was definitely not a wise decision to get involved in a fight with the Sun Moon Village. In that way, he would expose himself.</p>

  <p>The villagers also understood the situation. However, Luo Zheng was their only hope, so how could they be willing to let him go?</p>

  <p>"It's alright..." Luo Zheng said with a small smile.</p>

  <p>He already knew that the closest city to the Misty Mountain Village was the Mirror City, but it was still hundreds of millions of miles away.</p>

  <p>The Mirror City was one of the seven divine cities within the Vast Sky Region. Thus, the True Gods would only be found in that place. Luo Zheng thought for a while. Even if the Sun Moon Village were to ask the True Gods for help, they wouldn't be able to find him within a short period of time.</p>

  <p>Just as the villagers of the Misty Mountain Village thought, the people of the Sun Moon Village sent out people to check what had happened when they discovered that none of the warriors they had sent to the Misty Mountain Village had returned. True enough, they found that seven warriors had been killed and thrown into the wilderness.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the leader of Sun Moon Village was extremely furious and immediately led his men to attack the Misty Mountain Village.</p>

  <p>Even though their leader was a proving godly warrior, he was still very careful. He knew that it was easy for them to slaughter the people of the Misty Mountain Village with the seven warriors' abilities, but now that those seven warriors were dead, there must be something strange.</p>

  <p>When the leader and around forty of his warriors arrived at the Misty Mountain Village, they only saw a young man who sat quietly at the village entrance.</p>

  <p>"Proving godly warrior!"</p>

  <p>Of course, the Sun Moon Village leader knew much more than the ordinary warriors because he was a proving godly warrior. He could tell with a single glance that Luo Zheng was powerful. Even though Luo Zheng had deliberately restrained himself, the Mu Ning that he loosely emitted still shocked the leader of the Sun Moon Village.</p>

  <p>"I protect the Misty Mountain Village. Please leave this place. Then, I will not kill you," Luo Zheng spoke first.</p>

  <p>However, the warriors around the leader of the Sun Moon Village were deeply offended by his words.</p>

  <p>"Who the hell are you? Just kneel down in front of our leader, and then apologize to him with your life!"</p>

  <p>"You are just a mere proving godly warrior, but why are you so reckless?</p>

  <p>Do you think you are the best in this world?</p>

  <p>Our leader will make you regret ever coming here!"</p>

  <p>"All of you shut up!" the leader of the Sun Moon Village suddenly yelled.</p>

  <p>The whole time, his cold gaze was fixed on Luo Zheng. After he regained his bearings, he cupped his hands and asked, "Sir, would you care to tell me who your master is? May I have your name?"</p>
