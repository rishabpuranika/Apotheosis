<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Even though Zheng's blood vitality was very strong, he would not be able to withstand it, if he continued to bleed at such an alarming rate.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Zheng could think of no better option to deal with Nelly who had transformed into the Avenging Body.</p>

  <p>"You were very arrogant about your recent victories. Let's see how long you can withstand this now!" He could hear Nelly's chilling voice coming through a distance. At the same time, her body mutated into a blood shadow and charged towards Zheng once again.</p>

  <p>Zheng took a deep breath and started to gather his inner strength.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>There was a massive sound as they collided against each other.</p>

  <p>Zheng was hit again and with the impact, he shot a great distance away.</p>

  <p>Blood was still gushing out from his arm. As for Nelly, her Avenging Body was blasted into a ball of blood again by Zheng. However, the blood quickly gathered up the molecules to shape her body again.</p>

  <p>If the current situation continued to prevail, he was bound to lose, sooner or later.</p>

  <p>Zheng was completely at his wits' end.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Nelly didn't even give Zheng time to strategize. She kept attacking him non-stop.</p>

  <p>The impact of each collision was getting stronger.</p>

  <p>Although he was not physically injured by the collision, he kept losing a lot of blood along the way. Soon, with the rapid blood loss, Zheng started to feel dizzy.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Nelly was dead, physically. Even if Zheng didn't destroy her Avenging Body, it would gradually disappear on its own. However, in the Arena of Legends, it didn't matter who died first. What mattered was the victory and defeat!</p>

  <p>Zheng finally understood the amazing combination of Nelly's Avenging Body and Blood Breaking Bite. If someone killed her first in the divine land, even if she successfully became an Avenging Body, they would still be able to run away from her.</p>

  <p>However, things would be different if they were first hit by the Blood Breaking Bite. The blood in their body would continue to drain as long as they kept running away. If they didn't run away, they would have to fight the immortal Avenging Body. These two powerful skills were a genius combination.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Under another collision, Zheng retreated back to a full distance of around 70 feet. As he lost more and more blood, the meridians in Zheng's body became even more depleted. He couldn't even find the strength to operate.</p>

  <p>As he grew more dizzy, his vision started to get blurry.</p>

  <p>The Gods Killing Sword Array was a powerful skill in itself, but it obviously had no effect on Nelly in her current state!</p>

  <p>"The Avenging Body was probably created by the fusion of the Murdering Godly Way and the Life Godly Way, along with the extraction of one's own blood. Anyways it is created by blood. What if I use the Blood Breaking Bite to deal with it myself?"</p>

  <p>If Zheng could leave a mark of the Blood Breaking Bite on Nelly's body, it would definitely drain her blood as well.</p>

  <p>The problem was that the Avenging Body was just a mass of blood. Even if she completely drained off her entire blood, would the blood still be able to merge together again?</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>As he was considering that option, Nelly rushed towards him once again.</p>

  <p>Her eyes flashed with a sense of triumph. It seemed that this anonymous man who had made a record of thirty-two consecutive wins, would finally lose to her.</p>

  <p>Her sister had earlier lost to Harold. It was now her responsibility to defeat her opponent and salvage the Mu Clan's pride as well as points!</p>

  <p>Seeing his opponent getting closer and closer to him, Zheng got ready to boost his spirit. Both the scales of the Life Godly Way and the Murdering Godly Way on the Infinity Ruler beamed with a faint luster.</p>

  <p>The moment Nelly crashed into him, a red light suddenly shot out from Zheng's body. The light turned into a small snake head, and sunk its fangs into Nelly's head!</p>

  <p>"What is this? Blood Breaking Bite?"</p>

  <p>Nelly was completely stunned. Her actual body, which was on the outside of the Jade Wall of Legends, located on the Floating Island of the Mu Clan, suddenly trembled.</p>

  <p>The servants of the Mu Clan were perplexed when they saw Nelly's body trembling.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, after a warrior's soul entered the Jade Wall of Legends, his or her body would be in a state of stillness, rarely reacting to any external forces.</p>

  <p>It was obvious that Nelly was completely in a state of shock, or else her body would not have trembled so much. The servants exchanged nervous glances with each other, wondering what could have happened inside the Jade Wall of Legends.</p>

  <p>'How is this even possible?!' Nelly thought to herself.</p>

  <p>'How did this anonymous man manage to use the Blood Breaking Bite?</p>

  <p>It is an extremely difficult skill that my father created especially for me.</p>

  <p>It could be used only if one cultivates both the Life Godly Way and the Murdering Godly Way. It is restricted by the Godly Tile!'</p>

  <p>In other words, it was impossible to use this skill unless the powers of the Life Godly Way and the Murdering Godly Way were infused. She had practiced this skill for several years and she knew the challenges one had to face. However, this anonymous man had used this skill so easily, as if he had been practicing for years!</p>

  <p>Of course, she overlooked the fact that the anonymous man could use the Purple Aura Godly Way and the Separate Controlling skill as well even though he didn't possess the Purple Power Body.</p>

  <p>Time seemed to pass at a slow pace as she pondered over this problem.</p>

  <p>When she snapped out of her trance, a small mark had already appeared on her forehead.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>At the same time, she once again collided into Zheng.</p>

  <p>Under the impact of their collision, they once again shot back in opposite directions.</p>

  <p>Zheng retreated a full distance of a hundred feet this time. His face turned deathly pale due to a large amount of blood loss.</p>

  <p>But this time, Zheng had deliberately increased the impact force, so even Nelly was sent flying to the other side at a greater speed. As she flew backward, fresh red blood gushed out from the mark Zheng had left on her forehead.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>Her Avenging Body was much lighter than Zheng's body. Every time they collided, she would fly a distance of several thousand feet.</p>

  <p>As her blood continued to spill out from the mark, the mass of blood that formed her Avenging Body finally splattered evenly on the bloody wilderness, forming a blood ribbon that was 1000 feet long.</p>

  <p>'Is this really the end?' Zheng thought as he gasped for breath.</p>

  <p>Zheng had doubts about destroying her Avenging Body, as the blood would still merge together. To top it, the Arena of Legends was yet to announce his victory.</p>

  <p>As Zheng had predicted, after a short while, the scattered blood suddenly started to move.</p>

  <p>The ends of the blood ribbon quickly intertwined, and soon formed into half of Nelly's head. It slowly floated in the air, while her eyes continued to stare at Zheng coldly.</p>

  <p>'She is still alive.' Zheng was dismayed looking at half her form.</p>

  <p>"I really can't fathom how you managed to learn my Blood Breaking Bite without even forming your own Godly Tile," Nelly said in a low voice.</p>

  <p>She never in her wildest dream imagined, that such a situation would occur during her fight with the anonymous man.</p>

  <p>"Is it really necessary for me to answer you now?" Zheng said calmly as he furiously started plotting other methods to defeat his opponent.</p>

  <p>"It's not necessary. I will directly ask you for the truth after the Dongfang Clan finds out your real identity," said Nelly. "It really surprised me that you could use my Blood Breaking Bite to deal with my Avenging Body.</p>

  <p>But unfortunately... It's not enough to destroy my Avenging Body!"</p>

  <p>Her blood that was splattered on the ground, started to move. It quickly converged to small blood beads which seemed to be alive, while at the same time continuously flew towards Nelly's head.</p>

  <p>Soon, Nelly's body was fully formed, but the mark left by Zheng using the Blood Breaking Bite was still imprinted on her forehead.</p>

  <p>"It's not enough yet, but I think it should be enough after a few more attempts." Zheng suddenly smiled.</p>

  <p>Although she couldn't see through Zheng's blurry face, she could almost imagine his mocking smile. At the same time, the Buddha Emperor Sword had quietly appeared behind her head and smacked hard with its large, invisible blade.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>As Nelly hit towards Zheng, her body once again turned into a blood ribbon because of the Blood Breaking Bite. One end of the blood ribbon was only a few feet away from Zheng.</p>

  <p>This time, before the blood gathered into blood beads and shaped her body again, Zheng summoned a pale blue flame.</p>

  <p>"Ice Soul Flame!"</p>

  <p>Zheng seized the chance and banged heavily on the ground. An extremely cold aura quickly spread out, over the blood ribbon.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the blood ribbon was covered with thick ice.</p>

  <p>"Now show if you can recover this time!"</p>

  <p>Actually, he did have doubts whether the Ice Soul Flame would do the trick of destroying the immortal Avenging Body.</p>

  <p>Theoretically, even though the blood was frozen, the Avenging Body was still not destroyed. If that was the case, then he would have to stay in the arena and continue to fight it for days, months, or maybe even a few years!</p>

  <p>Then the winner would never be determined, would it?</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Zheng's worry did not last too long. About five minutes later, the bloody wilderness slowly dissipated in front of his eyes.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, he returned back to his room and the wall in front of him had recorded another victory.</p>

  <p>He had won now a total of 33 consecutive wins and his points had surpassed two million.</p>

  <p>Since he hadn't lost in a single match, his name still did not appear on the ranking list. Otherwise, with his current points, he would have already been ranked ahead of many consummate True Gods.</p>
