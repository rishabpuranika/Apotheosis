<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The two Holy Beings of the Moon Clan were sent out of the fairy palace by Augustus.</p>

  <p>Mike sighed. "I hope they make the right choice."</p>

  <p>"I won't be surprised if they choose to submit to Samuel," said Harold.</p>

  <p>Most Holy Beings would be open to compromise in order to maintain their status and influence in the divine land.</p>

  <p>"But it may not be the best option," Mike said with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>Under Zheng's leadership, Mike had seen many Other Shore Realm warriors outside the divine land. He now understood the great gap between these two forces and hoped that the Moon Clan would make the best choice available.</p>

  <p>"It looks like we also have to withdraw the disciples from the Floating Island of the Gu Clan," Hallet said, rather sadly. "But I don't know where Master is now."</p>

  <p>Back then, Mike had been imprisoned by the Dongfang Clan and not long after that, Bromley had left the Floating Island.</p>

  <p>Mike had returned safely but Bromley had disappeared without a trace.</p>

  <p>Mike shook his head and laughed. "He is very interested in the chaos, and exploring the chaos takes too much time. Fortunately, there are not many people in the Gu Clan. Even the fairy palace can accommodate them.</p>

  <p>Members of the Luo Clan don't need to come over at the moment."</p>

  <p>Now that the Yellow Emperor Guards were out in the open, there was no safe place in the entire divine land. The only places that could come close to blocking them were the forbidden areas, and even that might not be able to keep them away completely.</p>

  <p>"I will arrange for inquiries to be made about the situation on the Floating Islands," Hallet said, nodding.</p>

  <p>The entrance to the Swirl Forest was not completely closed to the Floating Islands, which meant that they could still get some information about the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey poked his head into the living room, smiled and said, "Grandpa, you promised me you would exchange something for the Truth of Godly Way."</p>

  <p>Mike's worries disappeared the moment he lay eyes on his grandson. He flashed Geoffrey a smile and said, "That's for sure! It looks like I still need to rely on my grandson."</p>

  <p>Geoffrey had learned that Joy had imparted the Truth of Cultivation Nature to Mike, and had immediately come up with an idea. After all, Geoffrey had deciphered the Truth of Godly Way, and he had the right to exercise his monopoly over it. And because of this, Geoffrey had worked out a 'deal' with Mike.</p>

  <p>Zheng had originally planned to leave the fairy palace and continue to absorb the Godly Ways from the Godly Way Tablets according to the pictures in his mind.</p>

  <p>But with the appearance of the Yellow Emperor Guards, he had no choice but to put it off. They had to observe the situation on the Floating Islands until everything was stable.</p>

  <p>During this period, Zheng chose to cultivate in seclusion.</p>

  <p>After he became a consummate True God, it meant that he had finally reached the end of the Godly Way.</p>

  <p>He had mastered ninety-nine percent of the Truth of Cultivation Nature.</p>

  <p>The reason why he was cultivating in seclusion was to reach the perfect state of the Truth of Godly Way and create the Truth Boat.</p>

  <p>"I entered the Sea of Truth last time with my physical body. What should I do if I want to enter again?" Zheng asked No. 9527.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," No. 9527 answered.</p>

  <p>Zheng was surprised. "How can you not know?" he asked desperately.</p>

  <p>"According to the Ancient God Cultivation Method, one would enter the Sea of Truth through the Body Tribulations. But I don't know what you should do. Maybe you need to be grilled over fire," No. 9527 replied with a smile.</p>

  <p>Zheng's mouth twitched. No matter what, he had to break the shackles of the Truth of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>Zheng sat cross-legged, and the Truth of Cultivation Nature that Geoffrey had copied came into view. The words appeared before his eyes, one after the other.</p>

  <p>At first, Zheng didn't feel any pressure and recited quickly and smoothly. But as the words kept going past Zheng's eyes, the pressure increased with every minute.</p>

  <p>Zheng's soul power had already far exceeded that of an ordinary consummate True God. He would be outstanding even in the Source World. But no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't read the last few words of the Truth of Cultivation Nature.</p>

  <p>It was not because his soul power was weak. Zheng wasn't about to faint, at least not at the moment.</p>

  <p>In the Source World, the warrior cultivating the Truth of Godly Way usually created a space and showed the Truth of Godly Way through the environment. Many consummate True Gods usually gathered together to comprehend the Truth of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>In that way, warriors could often practice and master it in a short time.</p>

  <p>But since Zheng wasn't in that position right now, he had to rely on his own efforts to make a breakthrough.</p>

  <p>"River, with, clear, stop, nothing..."</p>

  <p>Zheng's teeth chattered as he recited the words.</p>

  <p>His soul had entered an extreme state and it felt like there was an invisible high wall in front of him. He couldn't cross the wall, try as he might. So he resorted to using raw, brute force to cross it. This was an immense pressure on him.</p>

  <p>When Zheng had cultivated the Truth of Cultivation Nature, No. 9527 hadn't guided him or given him any advice.</p>

  <p>In theory, the Truth of Godly Way was endless. There were only a few talents in the Source World who had figured out the method of cultivation, and others had just followed suit. Zheng could only cross the tall wall before him alone to make a breakthrough.</p>

  <p>But No. 9527 could see that Zheng was trying to break through by using his soul.</p>

  <p>This method was foolhardy. If someone else tried to do it, they would have already fainted countless times. This might even damage the Soul of Light.</p>

  <p>But if he managed to pass through it, it would greatly benefit him.</p>

  <p>One day passed...</p>

  <p>Two days passed...</p>

  <p>Five days passed...</p>

  <p>Zheng was exhausted. The soul power was being consumed for a long time.</p>

  <p>He quickly swallowed several pills to replenish his soul power.</p>

  <p>His efforts had yielded some good results. Only six words of the whole Truth of Cultivation Nature had not been read and comprehended. The picture of the Sea of Truth was clearly displayed before him. Zheng had been to the Sea of Truth, but he had entered it with his physical body last time and the sea had looked different.</p>

  <p>On the tenth day, Zheng was able to recite two more words. Only four words remained.</p>

  <p>On the fifteenth day, only two words had not been recited.</p>

  <p>But by this time, Zheng had consumed too much of his soul power and fell to the ground. Even if Zheng had had strong soul power, it would still have been used up.</p>

  <p>But the moment he woke up, he continued to recite the Truth of Cultivation Nature.</p>

  <p>"Benevolent!"</p>

  <p>On the twentieth day after he had begun to cultivate in seclusion, Zheng gritted his teeth and spat out the last word of the Truth of Cultivation Nature.</p>

  <p>Zheng had finally merged his Soul of Light with the Truth of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>The Truth of Cultivation Nature emitted from his body with a bang.</p>

  <p>It wrapped Zheng up in a blue picture. He found himself sitting on a boat floating in a sea of stars.</p>

  <p>Everyone in the fairy palace felt the abnormal movement in the training tower.</p>

  <p>The training tower that Bromley had built could block almost all fluctuations, but it could not block the aura of the Truth of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>Everyone's eyes were focused on the training tower.</p>

  <p>"It looks like Zheng has made a breakthrough," Augustus said, his lips curling, jealousy and disappointment lacing his voice.</p>

  <p>Zheng had cultivated the Truth of Cultivation Nature earlier than others, but he had been busy bustling about all these years, without much time to cultivate. Augustus on the other hand, had spent a lot of time comprehending the Truth of Cultivation Nature in the fairy palace, but had only mastered half of it. He found it more difficult to cultivate after he reached a higher level. He thought it might still take him a long time to reach the consummate level of the Truth of Godly Way.</p>
