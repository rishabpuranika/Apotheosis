<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1817 Confidence </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>From a distance, it eerily looked like an earthworm crawling around.</p>

  <p>Despite its considerable size, the monster was quite agile in its speed.</p>

  <p>Zheng had overheard the conversation of the two.</p>

  <p>From their conversation he realized that the Princess Royal at the instigation of somebody else had taken the unicorn to search for him.</p>

  <p>Although Kennan was certain that this was an impossible task, the Princess Royal managed to get into the gray forest.</p>

  <p>However, even the Princess Royal hadn't expected that the consequences would be so serious.</p>

  <p>She attracted the terrible monster merely by just stepping into the gray forest. What was it about her that intrigued the monster? Was the attraction of her flesh and blood really so strong?</p>

  <p>Despite this, she did not appear scared. On the contrary, she felt the rush of adrenaline pumping through her blood!</p>

  <p>Suddenly, she turned herself around on the back of the unicorn which continued to charge forward rapidly, and fixed her pair of round bright eyes on Zheng.</p>

  <p>'He is at the Spirit Supreme Realm. He must have just arrived in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land and left the gray forest not long ago.'</p>

  <p>The Princess Royal concluded quietly.</p>

  <p>"Forgive me Your Highness, but this is not the time to discuss this,"</p>

  <p>Kennan said with an urgency in his voice. Although he sensed Zheng's presence in the forest, Kennan did not consider him a threat.</p>

  <p>Right now he was focusing on ways to block the monster, charging at them from behind. And he had to think fast, or else they all would be crushed soon!</p>

  <p>"No!" the princess said as she continued to stare at Zheng, her small mouth curving upwards. "Capture him for me right now! And I want him alive!"</p>

  <p>Zheng was stunned when he heard this.</p>

  <p>Among this group, Kennan and another person were world lords, while the rest of them were at the Spirit Transformation Realm.</p>

  <p>Zheng could easily manage the martial artists at the Spirit Transformation Realm, as long as he avoided these two world lords.</p>

  <p>These two world lords would not only have to capture Zheng, but also deal with the huge shadow that was chasing them from behind. Zheng doubted that the world lords would really carry out the princess's command and if they did, they would land up in a big mess.</p>

  <p>As expected, Kennan said impatiently, "Your Highness, right now we need to get away from here! We don't have the time to capture him. Our top priority is to run!"</p>

  <p>"You should be ashamed to call yourself a world lord, if you can't even catch a Spirit Supreme Realm warrior!" the Princess Royal said defiantly.</p>

  <p>Kennan silently cursed that the princess had chosen this time for an unnecessary argument.</p>

  <p>If he was given enough time and space, he would be able to easily capture Zheng who was at the Spirit Supreme Realm, no matter how fast he ran. However, there were other priorities right now. And at the top was to protect the princess. No doubt that it was the Formless Sky Python that was chasing them now.</p>

  <p>It was said that its huge mouth had the capacity to swallow an entire world. In its stomach there contained a long and narrow melting cave, and anyone who entered that cave would be melted and dismembered slowly and tortuously.</p>

  <p>"Princess, now is not the right time to capture him. Furthermore, this young man might be here for the first time, so he won't be aware about the imminent danger following us. He must also escape with us," Kennan explained to the princess. Then turning towards the forest, he shouted,</p>

  <p>"Hey you! You won't run away, will you? You have just reached the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, and with our help, you will be able to achieve twice the results with half the effort!" Kennan tried to reason with him.</p>

  <p>He was only too aware of the princess's fiery temper. She had fought bravely all along and finally reached here! She definitely would not let the guy go!</p>

  <p>Zheng appeared to be strong with his agile figure and speed. Even as a world lord, Kennan might not be able to control him in a short time.</p>

  <p>Hence, he first had to pacify Zheng and then control him.</p>

  <p>"I know that you won't run away." The princess then pondered over the situation for a while and thought since Zheng was cornered, she just needed to follow him all the way. There was no need to capture him after all.</p>

  <p>Zheng stood still for a moment and then at a lightning speed, jumped over to the other side. His body flipped twice in the air forming an arc, before disappearing into the trees.</p>

  <p>These people did not dare to fly high, so Zheng naturally would not fly.</p>

  <p>By now, Zheng had known that the Formless Sky Python was chasing after the princess. Obviously, he wouldn't follow them and get himself killed!</p>

  <p>Moreover, this woman's intentions seemed crazy with her wanting to capture him. If he was to listen to her, then he would definitely land himself in trouble.</p>

  <p>The princess had just finished speaking when Zheng vanished into the trees. She was really furious. How dared he disobey her! "Giddy up!"</p>

  <p>Gathering the reins on her unicorn, she made a sharp turn and headed into the forest.</p>

  <p>Kennan and the other warriors were shocked to see the turn of events unfolding before them so quickly. They just could not believe that the princess would just chase after that man! Their princess's life was more important than that fellow's.</p>

  <p>Her ever changing personality and mood swings always kept them distressed all the time.</p>

  <p>"Your Highness!" "Please stop! Don't chase after him!"</p>

  <p>"The Formless Sky Python is catching up fast behind you!"</p>

  <p>At present, it was Zheng who was currently fuming the most.</p>

  <p>Earlier, before his strange encounter, he was able to move quickly and peacefully.</p>

  <p>He never imagined that he would run into such a mysterious woman.</p>

  <p>Seeing the princess change her direction, the Formless Sky Python also followed suit. So indirectly the creature was pursuing Zheng too!</p>

  <p>If one were to look down from the sky, they would see an enormous chasm forming in the boundless forest. Everywhere the Formless Sky Python passed, it created a complete mess!</p>

  <p>However, this sort of thing was very common in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land!</p>

  <p>The Divine Refinement Forbidden Land was deliberately created by the Holy Beings. When one cultivated there, they could surely make great progress, and there were also martial artists who could condense the Godly Tiles.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land was equally dangerous. It was too dangerous to roam around especially at night.</p>

  <p>The aboriginals of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land were protected by a dome known as the divine light. As long as the light shone, evil spirits could not enter this world.</p>

  <p>However, once the divine light faded, they would be vulnerable and defenseless.</p>

  <p>At such situation, no ordinary warriors would dare to step out, apart from the world lords.</p>

  <p>Since the Princess Royal was always protected by her circle of warriors, she insisted on heading to the gray forest. She wanted to see if anyone descended there.</p>

  <p>And that was when Zheng first appeared at the Glitter Gold Gobi.</p>

  <p>Since this was an abandoned teleporting area, Zheng was all alone.</p>

  <p>That was when the princess decided to bring Zheng back.</p>

  <p>The unicorn's speed was exceptionally fast. Every time it took a step, a faint light would flash under its hooves. It was closely behind Zheng's heels.</p>

  <p>"Hey! Wait for me! Why are you running away?" the princess called out loudly from behind.</p>

  <p>The warriors chasing behind the princess were in a state of confusion.</p>

  <p>On one side there was this beast chasing down their throat, but all the princess cared about was to capture that fellow! They certainly felt she was losing her head.</p>

  <p>Zheng did not bother to even think while he surged forward. He could not even make out the path while running. He just kept ramming into bushes and trees, slashing them apart. Nothing would stop him from escaping from that crazy woman!</p>

  <p>Hearing the princess shout so loudly, Zheng really wanted to murder her!</p>

  <p>However, the thought of the two world lords following behind this woman, made Zheng run even harder! It would be better for him to think of other ways to get rid of them!</p>

  <p>"Kennan! Stop that fellow or else be prepared to face your consequences!" When she realized that the distance between Zheng and her was increasing, she decided to use her trump card. She knew Kennan wouldn't back out, but would obey her order!</p>

  <p>When Zheng heard those words, he immediately pulled out his Thunder Wind Divine Sword.</p>

  <p>Already the Formless Sky Python was very close behind the princess.</p>

  <p>Despite this, if the world lord dared to capture him, Zheng would kill the princess first!</p>

  <p>"Huff, huff!"</p>

  <p>While continuing to run, Zheng decided to spread out his killing intent.</p>

  <p>Although this killing intent was subtle, Kennan clearly felt it. The killing intent, which was purposefully spread out, carried a clear hint of warning.</p>

  <p>Kennan didn't plan on carrying out the princess's order. After all, it wasn't the first time he disobeyed her. However, the killing intent that Zheng suddenly released, surprised Kennan!</p>

  <p>The killing intent clearly sent a message to Kennan that if he were to make a move, Zheng would definitely kill the princess.</p>

  <p>Zheng clearly knew that there were two world lords among those warriors and that the princess herself was a top-level Spirit Transformation Realm martial artist. However, he still dared to release such a killing intent with a hint of warning.</p>

  <p>He was so confident about his own strength. Kennan instantly came to a conclusion.</p>
