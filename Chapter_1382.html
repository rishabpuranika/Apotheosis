  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't really absorb the Law Storm into his body.</p>

  <p>It could be because of the high degree of concentration of the Law Storm that it had the elementary form of chaotic energy. It seemed that there was some sort of "restoration" taking place in the Enchanted Barrier Tower.</p>

  <p>However, the Law Storm was not chaotic energy, and it wouldn't be good for Luo Zheng if he absorbed it into his elixir field.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, Luo Zheng was satisfied that he could make use of the Law Storm.</p>

  <p>He was aware that the Law Storm couldn't obstruct him anymore. It was as if he was flying in the outside world. He felt rather relaxed.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng increased his speed, he flew forward like a bat out of hell.</p>

  <p>Thus, the palace leaders became more and more surprised.</p>

  <p>In an instant, Luo Zheng had passed 19, 000 miles.</p>

  <p>And then, 20, 000 miles....</p>

  <p>21, 000 miles...</p>

  <p>22, 000 miles...</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did not stop and continued onward at full speed.</p>

  <p>"This is so amazing! He is like flying in the outside world."</p>

  <p>"What secret method is this guy using? He must be cheating!"</p>

  <p>Javier was still healing himself at the corner of the plaza. A bitter smile cracked his lips after he witnessed the performance of Layla and Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>'Darn, I was so naive.</p>

  <p>I wanted to prove myself so bad and be the number one in Passing the Torch.</p>

  <p>Why didn't I think of how impossible that was with Layla and Luo Zheng around? I'm far behind to either of them, ' he thought.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Layla could no longer stay calm.</p>

  <p>Her heart pounded and her hands clenched into fists. Her fingertips were beginning to turn pale due to the amount of strength she was using. Thus, her blood couldn't flow to her fingertips anymore.</p>

  <p>"He passed 23, 000 miles! Will he continue?" uttered Layla to herself while looking sideways at Luo Zheng. She really wanted to call for a halt. She wanted Luo Zheng to stop. 'Stop moving! Stop moving!' she kept yelling inside her head.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng just kept moving forward.</p>

  <p>23, 000 miles...</p>

  <p>24, 000 miles...</p>

  <p>25, 000 miles...</p>

  <p>"He has already passed 23, 000 miles." The lord of Sunset World clapped his hands and laughed. "Amazing! Truly amazing! I missed his performance earlier. I didn't expect this guy to be capable of doing something like this."</p>

  <p>"Well, it looks like you are going to suffer a great loss," joked Yolande with a smile.</p>

  <p>As a reply, the world lord laughed. "I have always been generous to the juniors. Since I've promised, I won't go back on my word."</p>

  <p>Yolande suddenly thought of something at that time. Thus, she flashed a smile and asked, "There is a reward for passing 20, 000 miles. I wonder if there's another reward for passing 30, 000 miles."</p>

  <p>Surprise showed on the world lord's face. On the other hand, all other palace leaders looked at them too with a strange expression on their faces.</p>

  <p>"30, 000 miles? Yolande, you must be kidding," exclaimed one of the palace leaders while shaking his head.</p>

  <p>Still laughing, the world lord said, "It's not like you don't know why Layla gave up just now upon reaching 28, 000 miles, Yolande."</p>

  <p>Yolande nodded. "I know. After reaching 28, 000 miles, the warriors will enter the inner circle of the Law Storm. I also know that the Law Power within it hasn't been completely shattered. It's a forbidden area for a warrior like Luo Zheng."</p>

  <p>"Now do you still have the confidence that Luo Zheng can pass 30, 000 miles?" mocked another palace leader.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was still continuing his journey by that time. It was indeed a stunning performance, but to pass 30, 000 miles still seemed impossible for a warrior like him. Thus, nobody believed Yolande.</p>

  <p>"Where are you getting your confidence?" asked another palace leader.</p>

  <p>Yolande just smiled at the palace leader and didn't even seem to care about his doubts.</p>

  <p>To be honest, she wasn't that confident that Luo Zheng could pass 30, 000 miles either. But then, it had been common for Luo Zheng to surprise her with what he could do. That was the reason that she felt confident that time.</p>

  <p>"I'm actually not as confident as you all think, but I think that a miracle is about to happen now," she voiced out.</p>

  <p>"Impossible," a palace leader said resolutely.</p>

  <p>Yolande glared at that palace leader angrily and spat, "I'm not talking to you."</p>

  <p>Amused by her reaction, the world lord laughed and said, "Well, since Yolande brought it up, I have to do something. Okay. If this kid passes 30, 000 miles, then it will be just natural for me to give him a big reward."</p>

  <p>It was only after Yolande heard that promise that her face beamed with happiness.</p>

  <p>Layla, who happened to be standing at the side, heard their conversation.</p>

  <p>She was secretly fuming inside, though her face remained expressionless.</p>

  <p>'30, 000 miles?</p>

  <p>He hasn't even broken the 28, 000-mile record I set yet! How could they talk like they were sure he'll break my record? That's absurd!' she thought amid the growing worry in her heart.</p>

  <p>The momentum of Zheng's sprint was definitely not any weaker than hers.</p>

  <p>Actually, it was even fiercer and faster than hers.</p>

  <p>'How is this possible?</p>

  <p>I've even activated the Wrath of the Ocean.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng hasn't even used his life vitality to protect his body yet.</p>

  <p>He's just relying on his own physical strength to travel more than 20, 000 miles. What is going on?' her mind asked.</p>

  <p>Irritated by her own thoughts, Layla arrogantly cocked her head to the side.</p>

  <p>She was under the impression that she was the most talented warrior in the universe. Thus, she had always looked down at every one since entering the Mist Palace.</p>

  <p>None of the warriors from the thirteen palaces could compare to her, and never had she expected to encounter a threat to what she believed.</p>

  <p>However, on her first day in the Mist Palace, she met Luo Zheng and felt that he was a threat to her. Although she had been ignoring the mild fear he was stirring inside her, her worry of losing against him just kept on growing stronger and stronger.</p>

  <p>Looking back at where Luo Zheng was, she finally understood why her heart was beating anxiously. Sadness and dejection flooded her in an instant, making her oblivious of the loud noise that suddenly filled the square.</p>

  <p>"26, 000 miles!"</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng will definitely surpass Layla!"</p>

  <p>"There shouldn't be much of a problem for Luo Zheng in surpassing Layla."</p>

  <p>"27, 000 miles!"</p>

  <p>"28, 000 miles! He'll break Layla's record after covering another 200 miles."</p>

  <p>Layla's beautiful face turned pale. Her perfectly manicured nails dug her flesh when she clenched her hands into fists.</p>

  <p>'200 miles.</p>

  <p>It would only take a couple of seconds for Luo Zheng to cover that with his speed.</p>

  <p>He will break my record for sure!' raged her thoughts.</p>

  <p>Regret was eating her inside out fast. She would have fought harder if she had known how capable Luo Zheng was earlier. Even if she might have injured herself, she would have fought for a longer period of time. She could have done it!</p>

  <p>She took a deep breath to calm herself down.</p>

  <p>She was wrong when she left the Enchanted Barrier Tower safely. She was too confident that Luo Zheng wouldn't be able to catch up to her at the distance she set. It was only now that she realized how naive she had been to think of that.</p>

  <p>She was still drowning in her regret when Luo Zheng passed 28, 200 miles and officially broke her record.</p>

  <p>Originally, many warriors thought that Layla's record was unprecedented and unbreakable. Nobody expected for her record to be broken in this grand era.</p>

  <p>However, the shocking reality was now screaming at their faces.</p>

  <p>It was as if Layla's record wasn't terrifying and suffocating enough that Luo Zheng easily broke it.</p>

  <p>Layla's record only lasted for a few hours.</p>

  <p>"Will Luo Zheng continue moving forward?"</p>

  <p>"Can he pass 29, 000 miles?"</p>

  <p>"The space after 28, 000 miles is already the inner circle of the Law Storm. The difficulty isn't the same as how it was in the outer circle.</p>

  <p>Thus, Layla chose to leave the space 200 miles after she reached 28, 000.</p>

  <p>I believe that Luo Zheng will give up now that he has broken Layla's record."</p>

  <p>The audience all thought that Luo Zheng would be leaving the Enchanted Barrier Tower now since there was no one competing with him anymore.</p>

  <p>He had already taken the first place, and it would be of little significance for him to still advance.</p>

  <p>However, they were wrong.</p>

  <p>This was because Luo Zheng wasn't thinking of surpassing anyone and had only been following his own will to move forward since he started.</p>

  <p>The only person he wanted to challenge wasn't anyone else but himself.</p>

  <p>Thus, he didn't stop and continued charging forward.</p>

  <p>"We won't be able to observe him any longer once he enters the inner circle," a palace leader said while staring at the dark gray Law Storm.</p>

  <p>"But we can still feel his position. He has already reached 29, 000 miles," the world lord said with a helpless smile. He now realized that Zheng's goal was to pass 30, 000 miles.</p>

  <p>At that time, one of the palace leaders said, "At around 29, 000-mile mark, I remember that there is a flame pool. There is the Immortal Profound Flame left by Supreme Lord of Profound Flame. Even after all these years, the flame pool still hasn't been completely absorbed by the Law Storm. I don't think Luo Zheng would cross that flame pool."</p>
