<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng held up the dim spear and then glanced at Campbell.</p>

  <p>With the help of the Light of Annihilation, the latter had killed many hostility-level Treacherous Beings just now.</p>

  <p>Now the Light of Annihilation had dimmed. The spear might be of extraordinary quality, but it was still nothing more than a piece of scrap metal in the face of the Treacherous Being.</p>

  <p>Everyone looked at the now blunt tip of the spear and then turned to look at Campbell.</p>

  <p>"That stone," Campbell suddenly said.</p>

  <p>"What?" A strange look appeared on Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>Campbell didn't explain anything but gently pointed at Zheng's chest.</p>

  <p>A small bump appeared out of nowhere on his ribs. It was as if there was something extra there, something that didn't belong. Then the bump moved along his esophagus and quickly reached his throat and then his mouth.</p>

  <p>Then it was involuntarily spat out. Only then everyone saw that it was a cubic stone with several cracks on its surface.</p>

  <p>As for Zheng, as soon as the stone had moved in his body, he had started to recall that it had been taken out from Les' body.</p>

  <p>At that time, Campbell had not awakened. He had merely said that this stone was called the Holy Stone, and then forcefully stored it inside Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>Neither Zheng nor the Primeval Lord of Heaven knew why he had done so.</p>

  <p>Les had used this Holy Stone to unfold the protective sphere, but once the protective sphere was smashed, the energy contained within the stone should have been exhausted. From the way they saw, the stone was all its name suggested. A stone!</p>

  <p>"Can this stone be useful?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"As creatures of the secondary world, you naturally do not know the mysteries of this stone," Campbell remarked as he pointed at the Holy Stone.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>To their immense surprise, the Light of Annihilation immediately burst forth from the Holy Stone like water from a fountain.</p>

  <p>When Zheng saw this, his eyebrows rose. He quickly grabbed the stone in one hand and held the spear in the other.</p>

  <p>The spear was covered with several grooves like drainage paths. As soon as the Light of Annihilation gushed out of the Holy Stone, it quickly filled every single centimeter of those grooves.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the black head felt the threat of the Light of Annihilation when this began to happen because its reaction was rather fierce. The red lights in its eyes shone once more. Whoosh! Two beams crisscrossed against the ground and swept towards Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>Before anyone could warn him, Zheng himself jumped and fell to the ground sideways. With the help of the silver spear, he then jumped high into the air like a nimble monkey and fell sharply once more, rolling over again and again to get out of the beams' path.</p>

  <p>The fatal red lights followed him all the way, but he managed to dodge them every single time they reached near.</p>

  <p>The others merely stood in different corners and positions, afraid of being hit. They weren't fast enough to dodge the beams.</p>

  <p>The red lights chased after Zheng for two circles before they finally dimmed.</p>

  <p>However, the black head was not going to let go of Zheng so easily. After all, the Light of Annihilation was extremely lethal to it.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The red lights in its eyes began to accumulate once again.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Zheng, finding his chance, spiraled up. The long spear in his hand shook violently and he pointed it towards the huge black head.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>The silver Light of Annihilation turned into a sharp spear light and rushed straight for the black head.</p>

  <p>Compared to the big-headed monsters they had just faced, the black head was enormous and therefore, rather clumsy, which meant that for Zheng, it was a sitting duck!</p>

  <p>The spear light hit the black head right between the eyebrows. A big hole appeared where it had struck and the black head immediately disappeared in the world behind the Pure Sky Platform.</p>

  <p>Zheng and his companions carefully observed how the black head would react now.</p>

  <p>After being hit by the Light of Annihilation, the hostility-level Treacherous Beings had disappeared directly. The effect had been surprisingly good.</p>

  <p>And if luck were on their side, then this would also be the case with the black head, and Zheng's spear strike would be enough to kill this resentment-level Treacherous Being as well.</p>

  <p>However, the black head shook rapidly in the air, and the circular hole between its eyebrows quickly began to heal.</p>

  <p>At the same time, two beams of red lights shot out from its eyes towards Zheng once again.</p>

  <p>Zheng's pupils shrank, and he began to dodge like a nimble rabbit. Somehow, he was faster than those light beams.</p>

  <p>The others looked on. They were facing a formidable enemy. The Pure Sky Platform itself was not that big. Even if the black head did not deliberately aim at them, there were chances that they could be hit by a stray beam which could take their lives.</p>

  <p>As Zheng sprinted along the Pure Sky Platform, the Holy Stone in his palm was still emitting large amounts of the Light of Annihilation.</p>

  <p>Seizing an opportunity that he got during one of his jumps, Zheng once again thrust his spear towards the black head.</p>

  <p>The spear accurately reached its mark and pierced the black head, but just as before, the wound healed quickly, and the resentment-level Treacherous Being was unharmed.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid that the spear doesn't work!"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean? Can't the silver energy kill that black head?"</p>

  <p>"No and we'd better run away now. There's no need for us to lose our lives in the effort to do so."</p>

  <p>Everyone had thought that with the silver energy, Zheng would be able to kill the resentment-level Treacherous Being, or at least he would be able to seriously injure it. It was beyond their imagination and also rather fearsome that even two strikes by the spear didn't do a single darned thing to the black head.</p>

  <p>"Master Campbell, why is this happening?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"I... I don't know," Campbell replied hesitantly as he shook his head.</p>

  <p>As nothing more than a builder of the worlds, he was not very good at fighting.</p>

  <p>He did have some level of knowledge. He knew that after the creatures of the main world died, they would become Treacherous Beings and fear the Light of Annihilation. However, his knowledge did not extend to a thorough understanding of the division of strength of those Treacherous Beings.</p>

  <p>Seeing the perplexed look on Campbell's face, Zheng knew that it would be a waste of time to push him for answers. The man sincerely didn't know.</p>

  <p>Also, since Zheng couldn't defeat the resentment-level Treacherous Being, they had to leave. He shouted to his companions, "Look! I can't hurt this thing. Let's move towards the door and leave this place as soon as possible!"</p>

  <p>The men in black robes moved the fastest when they heard that. They had been making up their minds to escape from this damned place for a long while now. By the time Zheng had finished shouting, several of them were already at the door.</p>

  <p>The man who was at the front grabbed the door and tried to open it, but it didn't move at all. He shouted, "The door's locked!"</p>

  <p>Hearing that, the other men behind him became anxious. They rushed forward, grabbed the edge of the door and pulled it out fiercely, as if they could tear it into opening, but the door still remained tightly shut.</p>

  <p>Very soon, the leader of the men in black robes, the Eternal Realm Hunters, Fuxi and the Snake Goddess all put their backs into an effort to open the door. However, the door seemed to have been locked by some kind of theurgy, and it remained unmoved.</p>

  <p>"Hahaha..." When the black head saw their valiant but failed efforts, it let out a mocking laugh. "Dead end! There is no return from this point forth.</p>

  <p>Since you broke into this place, you won't leave it alive."</p>

  <p>Previously, the black head had spoken in Sanskrit, but this time, it was actually speaking in human tongue.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>As soon as it had finished its sentence, the red lights in its eyes accumulated once again and were about to shoot towards the door. This time, they would have burned everyone since they were already accumulated there in a group.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Two spear lights shot out and hit the bull's eyes, or rather, the head's eyes.</p>

  <p>Both of its eyes had now been replaced by two gaping holes.</p>

  <p>Its eyes were gone, and the red lights naturally dissipated. This was a clever decision, but it was still not enough.</p>

  <p>Even losing both of its eyes did not seem to be a problem for it. The two holes quickly healed and became a pair of eyes once again. The head chuckled malevolently, and red lights began to brew within its eyes once again.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Zheng raised his hand and stabbed the black head's eyes with the light beams once again.</p>

  <p>"Agh..."</p>

  <p>The black head seemed pissed at this.</p>

  <p>The strongest trump card in its pocket, if it could have any, was the dazzling lights in its eyes.</p>

  <p>If Zheng kept on poking it in the eyes, it wouldn't have any way of fighting back. Although it didn't hurt, it was still extremely inconvenient.</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng had pinned down the black head, Campbell floated towards the door.</p>

  <p>As a builder of the world, Campbell was not too strong, but was very familiar with the chaos, the Other Shore, and everything else that mattered to the construction of this place. When everyone saw him, they all moved aside.</p>

  <p>Campbell reached out his hand and pressed it against the door. He rubbed it two times, as if to get a feel of it and then said something that shocked them all, "Something's very wrong with this door."</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess, Fuxi and the others couldn't understand what he meant.</p>

  <p>Poking the black head with the spear light once again, Zheng turned around and asked, "What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"The door has been replaced," Campbell replied.</p>

  <p>"So many years have passed. Maybe the original door was rotten, so it had to be replaced," Zheng suggested.</p>

  <p>However, Campbell shook his head. "No, it was just replaced. There..."</p>

  <p>He pointed to another Pure Sky Platform in the distance.</p>

  <p>A person was standing on that Pure Sky Platform, who looked somehow exactly like the black head.</p>

  <p>When the man felt the gazes of Campbell and Zheng turn towards him from afar, the corners of his mouth curled up, revealing a strange smile.</p>

  <p>The black head also raised the corners of its mouth, revealing the same smile as the man's. They were one!</p>
