<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 205 Oceiros' Pillar </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng's body were going through different changes.</p>

  <p>And it had happened before. For instance, he once absorbed Evil Lan's fire in a cave. There was also an instance when he absorbed the fire of the Earth's core in an underground cave in the south.</p>

  <p>This made his body become a low-grade spiritual weapon.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng didn't know that the black mist was also a kind of flame.</p>

  <p>The demon's holy fire was a kind of flame that looked like a black mist because of its very low temperature. All the low-grade demons used it as a secret pill to cultivate their powers.</p>

  <p>The way to refine a corporeal body with the demon's holy fire was similar to Zheng's mysterious book about weapon refining.</p>

  <p>The vortexes on Zheng's body were absorbing the black fire quickly.</p>

  <p>In a short amount of time, the demon's holy fire that wrapped Yolande and Aldrich was being swallowed by Luo Zheng unexpectedly.</p>

  <p>And at the rate of his body's absorbing power, Luo Zheng could swallow the rest of the demon's holy fire.</p>

  <p>The vanishing demon's holy fire harmed Aldrich, while Yolande regained her advantage at the battle.</p>

  <p>The powerful men of the Illuminating Soul Realm who were on standby could not believe what they were witnessing.</p>

  <p>They didn't agree with Yolande taking the burdensome Luo Zheng to the battle, but they couldn't bring it up during the battle.</p>

  <p>And after Aldrich released the demon's holy fire, it became hard to tell the outcome of the battle.</p>

  <p>But they had never imagined that Yolande's stubbornness could help them in this difficult situation. The little guy had unexpectedly absorbed the demon's holy fire.</p>

  <p>One of the demon kings was not in the best fighting capacity with his injuries. And amongst the three demon kings, only Oceiros could salvage the situation now. If Aldrich got injured or died, the demons would be at a disadvantage.</p>

  <p>It seemed that the demon kings were discreetly communicating using a secret skill. Their eyes were rolling continuously and then abruptly stopped. Then without verbal words, they started to move simultaneously.</p>

  <p>They tried to approach the demon's holy fire from different directions.</p>

  <p>The three demon kings aimed to prevent Luo Zheng from absorbing all the demon's holy fire. They knew that Aldrich paid a great toll at releasing the demon's holy fire in an instant so they couldn't let anyone destroy it yet.</p>

  <p>As long as the demon's holy fire existed, Aldrich would still be invincible.</p>

  <p>But if that bloke absorbed the demon's holy fire, it would greatly damage Aldrich.</p>

  <p>The three demon kings staying outside the demon's holy fire would prevent Luo Zheng from absorbing all of it at any price.</p>

  <p>The powerful men of the Illuminating Soul Realm saw through the action of the demon kings and knew exactly what they were planning.</p>

  <p>"We have to stop them no matter the cost!" Spencer ordered as he waved his huge hammer.</p>

  <p>The men prepared themselves to attack at Spencer's command.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the battle between Yolande and Aldrich would decide the fate of the White Emperor City. If Yolande lost this battle, the White Emperor City would fall and the entire Burning Sky Empire would falter.</p>

  <p>"Ho!" Hugh waved his hands and a five-clawed golden dragon appeared and attacked one of the demon kings.</p>

  <p>"Shoo..." Suddenly, countless tiny silver swords appeared beside Lennie.</p>

  <p>They spun in the same direction and eventually formed into a huge blade storm that blocked the demon kings' way.</p>

  <p>"Shoo!" Another powerful man threw three paper symbols and they became a huge thunderstorm in an instant. It flashed a dizzying bright light and released a terrifying momentum.</p>

  <p>Each of the powerful men of the Illuminating Soul Realm had powers based on their unique skills and personalities.</p>

  <p>"At any cost, we can't let them get near Luo Zheng. We must give it our all to protect the lad," another powerful man roared.</p>

  <p>The powerful men attacked fiercely, but the three demon kings were ready to attack, and they rushed forward at maximum speed.</p>

  <p>The injured demon king didn't rush over after he was trapped by Lennie in a huge sword array with a total of 1080 tiny silver swords.</p>

  <p>This was Lennie's most powerful killing tactic called the Great Star Killing Array. When he was young, he was famous for his control over the Small Star Array made of 108 tiny silver swords.</p>

  <p>Lennie dedicated himself in improving this technique until he could produce ten times the number of tiny silver swords which was now known as the Great Star Killing Array. This skill was ten times more powerful than the Small Star Array.</p>

  <p>Lennie once used the Great Star Killing Array to kill the ordinary demon king. And now, he would once again use this technique to fight another ordinary demon king who was injured. When the demon king finally rushed towards him, 1080 tiny silver swords shot at him simultaneously.</p>

  <p>No matter how strong the demon king was, he was no match to more than 1000 tiny swords that stabbed his body. At last, he got killed and fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>With one demon king dead, only two demon kings were left to stop Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>One was an ordinary demon king that could easily be defeated. Under a joint attack of some powerful men, he was captured.</p>

  <p>Now, the biggest challenge was Oceiros.</p>

  <p>Oceiros was an old but powerful demon king like Aldrich. His strength was way more powerful than an ordinary demon king.</p>

  <p>It needed Spencer and some of the powerful men just to stop Oceiros.</p>

  <p>"Watch out all of you. Oceiros could use the Pillar anytime. If that's the case, I will stop him upfront," Spencer commanded the group and controlled his life vitality great god at the same time.</p>

  <p>In the history of the White Emperor City, only Yolande and Spencer could battle Oceiros and Aldrich face-to-face.</p>

  <p>While floating in midair, Spencer deeply breathed out. Then he breathed in quite deeply until his underbelly became bloated.</p>

  <p>His life vitality great god with a height of several feet started to shrink little by little until it was finally compressed to a size that was double his body.</p>

  <p>After the life vitality was compressed, its strength became a hundred times greater. This incarnation was almost like the real one.</p>

  <p>His incarnation was like the customized armor that was instantly attached to his body.</p>

  <p>This technique was almost like the "life vitality armor" only with some significant differences. The compressed armor from the huge life vitality god was much more powerful than the ordinary one.</p>

  <p>Spencer steadied his eyes on the rushing Oceiros. With his high speed, he looked like a black line crossing the sky to the naked eye.</p>

  <p>"Kill!" Spencer waved the huge hammers in hands and tried to directly hit Oceiros.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, other powerful men showed great momentum and rushed behind Spencer to attack Oceiros.</p>

  <p>When the demon king saw the life vitality of different colors rushing towards him, he wildly flapped his wings and made a weird sound from his throat.</p>

  <p>"Quack, you can never stop me! Oceiros' Pillar!"</p>

  <p>The evil spirit emerged from his body and was congealed to form black pillars, and there were numerous chains attached to each of the pillars.</p>

  <p>"Everyone, watch out for these black pillars. If you get caught by it, you will surely die!" Spencer said. He waved his big hammers to hit the pillars rushing towards him.</p>

  <p>When the hammer hit the pillar, the chains around it rose quickly and targeted the hammer.</p>

  <p>Spencer sneered and waved the other hammer.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The hammer and the pillar crashed into each other at a high speed and it made a sound that echoed through a hundred miles away.</p>

  <p>The battle between the demon army and the imperial army at White Emperor City abruptly stopped at the sound of the horrible blow. They looked up at the sky with fear in their eyes.</p>

  <p>The Oceiros' Pillar was smashed to pieces by Spencer's hammer. It turned back to its original form as an evil spirit and then disappeared between heaven and earth.</p>

  <p>The other powerful men were having a difficult time facing Oceiros' Pillars.</p>

  <p>One of the powerful men waved his machete at the sight of Oceiros' Pillar approaching. When his life vitality was burning crazily, the machete turned into a blood cutter and tried to chop the pillar.</p>

  <p>This powerful man was confident in his strength and technique. His blood cutter was a top-grade spiritual weapon and anything it had in contact with would surely be cut in halves. He had not met any weapon that could escape the wrath of his blood cutter since he reached the Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>But the blood cutter didn't destroy the pillar completely and got stuck deep in the pillar. The powerful man was surprised to see that his blood cutter didn't succeed for the first time.</p>

  <p>This cutter user was an old but famous refiner and reached the Illuminating Soul Realm without a sweat. If he were anywhere in the Eastern Region except the Imperial Capital, he would dominate the place and nobody would dare to provoke him. But unexpectedly, he couldn't cut through the Oceirus' Pillar.</p>

  <p>He went to pull out the machete from the pillar but didn't make it.</p>

  <p>When he came near the pillar, the chains entangled him together with his blood cutter and immediately trapped him inside the pillar.</p>
