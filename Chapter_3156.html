<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng agreed with Dorothy's explanation.</p>

  <p>It was important to consider how many divine megatons of force the Other Shore Tokens could unleash. But their abilities were more important.</p>

  <p>For example, the force the Eye of Will could unleash wasn't great. It only had a few dozen divine megatons of Other Shore Power. But it had two abilities that were extremely useful.</p>

  <p>When all the cases on the plate had turned over, all the Other Shore Tokens were revealed to everyone.</p>

  <p>Everyone's eyes were fixed on the Other Shore Tokens. They were secretly selecting the Other Shore Tokens for themselves. If they saw any Other Shore Token they would like to have, they would go straight to it when the selection began.</p>

  <p>One of the purple Souls of Light walked up to the plate and said, "Most of you have been on the Other Shore for a long time, and I believe you are all very familiar with Other Shore Tokens, right?"</p>

  <p>"Of course we are. I've changed six Other Shore Tokens already!"</p>

  <p>"I was on Stage Three for more than ten years!"</p>

  <p>"But the Other Shore Tokens I integrated before are nothing compared to the ones before my eyes right now."</p>

  <p>Everyone had erupted at once. They thought they knew the Other Shore Tokens very well.</p>

  <p>"In that case, I don't have to give you the routine introduction," the purple Soul of Light said with a smile. He was pleased to have been saved the trouble of explaining everything to them.</p>

  <p>"You don't have to introduce anything."</p>

  <p>"People who can enter Stage Four know pretty well about the Other Shore!".</p>

  <p>They answered confidently.</p>

  <p>Zheng was stunned and felt discouraged. All of these people had been on the Other Shore for a long time. They probably didn't need to learn anything about the place. He, on the other hand, was still a new comer here!</p>

  <p>"I think you should go on with the introduction," Dorothy said suddenly, raising a hand.</p>

  <p>"Isn't it too troublesome, given that everyone knows about it?"</p>

  <p>"What do you want to know? After we pick the Other Shore Tokens, I will tell you. What do you think?"</p>

  <p>"These two are so ignorant. I noticed them just now. I wonder which mountain they are from!"</p>

  <p>The disciples from the Oneness Sky Palace had already locked their sights on the Other Shore Tokens that they wanted. They were afraid that someone else would take away the Other Shore Tokens they had chosen for themselves. They were anxious and in no mood to tolerate anyone who was bent on wasting time on unnecessary introductions.</p>

  <p>"Please go on," Dorothy said, her tone leaving no room for questions.</p>

  <p>As she spoke this time, the Necklace of Mystic Soul on her chest began to glow.</p>

  <p>She didn't want to use the power of the Necklace of Mystic Soul to suppress these people. But the shining Necklace of Mystic Soul was a symbol of status in the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>When the three purple Souls of Light saw the necklace, their expressions suddenly shifted. The stable aura of their Souls of Light even fluctuated.</p>

  <p>There were a few knowledgeable warriors standing within the Seclusion Door who recognized the origin of the Necklace of Mystic Soul at once and fell silent. Even though they couldn't see Dorothy, they knew that she was an important figure in the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>But there were still a large number of people who hadn't noticed the necklace. They didn't know anything about the Necklace of Mystic Soul and continued to protest loudly.</p>

  <p>"Shut up! Anyone who makes any noise will be driven out of the Seclusion Door immediately!" a purple Soul of Light on the plate shouted, his voice cold.</p>

  <p>At this, the noise died down. Everyone now understood what was going on.</p>

  <p>This woman was probably someone they could not afford to provoke.</p>

  <p>The purple Soul of Light on the plate turned to Dorothy and bowed politely.</p>

  <p>He then made the introduction meticulously. "There are a large number of Other Shore Tokens on the Other Shore. There are many kinds of them. But after our predecessors had explored for a number of years, they finally divided the Other Shore Tokens into four types."</p>

  <p>He picked up a rectangular stone at his feet and continued, "This is a Surging Stone that has been excavated from Stage Four. It is a rare Other Shore Token on Stage Four. The Other Shore Power it contains reaches fifty divine megatons, so it is almost similar to the Other Shore Tokens on Stage Five. This is the most typical strengthening type of Other Shore Token!"</p>

  <p>"Strengthening type," Zheng murmured to himself as he listened carefully.</p>

  <p>Dorothy added in a whisper, "The Other Shore Tokens of the strengthening type are most popular. But they don't have any extra function. Many warriors who pursue powerful strength take them as their major Other Shore Tokens."</p>

  <p>The purple Soul of Light took two steps forward on the plate and picked up a vine and a leaf. "The Leaf of Revival is an Other Shore Token from Stage Eight. The Other Shore Power it contains is only six divine megatons.</p>

  <p>Pretty weak. If one merges with the Leaf of Revival, they could quickly recover even they suffered irreversible damages. The same applies to the soul and the inner world!"</p>

  <p>"To heal the soul and the inner world?" Zheng's eyebrows went up.</p>

  <p>When one reached the True God Realm, the damage on one's corporeal body wasn't much of a threat. But the inner world in one's cinnabar field and their soul were very fragile. If these two parts were to become damaged, it would be extremely troublesome to repair them. Zheng hadn't expected this Other Shore Token to have such an ability.</p>

  <p>"This is an auxiliary type of Other Shore Token. This type of Other Shore Tokens don't have a strong Other Shore Power, but they are extremely useful," Dorothy said. She then looked up to the purple Soul of Light and said, "Continue with the next type. There's no need to introduce the Spring Rain Vine. It has similar effects as the Leaf of Revival."</p>

  <p>"Okay," the purple Soul of Light said obediently.</p>

  <p>The other hundreds of people were surprised at the way this was turning out.</p>

  <p>It looked like the woman knew everything and the reason she had insisted that the purple Soul of Light make the introduction was only for the benefit of the man standing beside her, so that he could learn everything.</p>

  <p>The crowd envied Zheng. How a guy who didn't know anything had such good luck?</p>

  <p>But it was not Zheng's fault that he was ignorant about the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>After entering the Dragon City, Zheng had needed to improve his strength in all aspects. He had practiced without a break while all the warriors present here had been on the Other Shore for at least a decade.</p>

  <p>The purple Soul of Light walked to the middle of the plate and picked up a small sword in his hand. He then said, "The third type is the descending type. The Other Shore Tokens of this type can be used to defend the enemy.</p>

  <p>Every one of them can be considered as an Other Shore Token and a lifeblood treasure as well."</p>

  <p>Zheng had seen Other Shore Tokens of this type several times before.</p>

  <p>For example, the Mysterious Meteor Tripod at the bottom of the divine land and the colorful ring Emily had used had been Other Shore Tokens that could be thrown out to resist the enemy.</p>

  <p>"What about the last type?" someone in the crowd couldn't help but ask.</p>

  <p>Strengthening type, auxiliary type, and descending type - these three types were common knowledge. But many people didn't know that there was a fourth type.</p>

  <p>"The mysterious type," the purple Soul of Light replied. "The Other Shore Tokens of this type are most rare of all. They usually possess a special ability and can't be categorized into any type. Some can even grow on their own."</p>

  <p>"Grow?" Zheng then thought of the corpse of the Heavenly Spider in the Sacred Mallow Temple. "Dorothy, if one merges with a living Heavenly Spider on the Other Shore, can the Heavenly Spider also grow? If so, it belongs to..."</p>

  <p>"The mysterious type," Dorothy replied affirmatively. "It is extremely difficult to merge with living creatures on the Other Shore. But there are many benefits to merging with any of them. The living creature one merges with is practically a form of contractual beast. Moreover, the creatures they merge with on the Other Shore can grow further, which is why they are of the mysterious type."</p>
