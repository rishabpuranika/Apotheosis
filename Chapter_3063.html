  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Sword Tower was famous for its difficulty. It was not rare to see warriors getting kicked out of the rooms of the tower.</p>

  <p>Some of its rooms were so hard that even Other Shore Realm warriors would find themselves defeated and ejected.</p>

  <p>The young man who was kicked out of his room quickly stood up and brushed himself off, looking self-conscious. He glanced towards the old man standing nearby. "Master Sellers! This is a bit embarrassing."</p>

  <p>"You've been here for six months, right? How many times have you been kicked out?" asked the old man, whose name was Sellers Wen.</p>

  <p>"This is the fourth time," the young man replied honestly.</p>

  <p>"Useless! You're complete rubbish," Sellers Wen said coldly.</p>

  <p>Instead of getting offended, the young man grinned wryly. All the cultivators in Dragon City were familiar with Sellers Wen, and knew that he was very softhearted, despite his outward curtness and short temper.</p>

  <p>The young man, for example, couldn't afford the room's fee twice. He had only been able to enter the Sword Tower to cultivate because Sellers Wen was generous enough to lend him divine crystals.</p>

  <p>They heard the sound of a door being pushed open, and turned towards it. A man in a silk robe emerged. He had an extraordinary aura around him.</p>

  <p>Although he had just reached the Other Shore Realm, it was clear that he already possessed great strength and power.</p>

  <p>The man bowed to Sellers Wen, and then left without saying a word.</p>

  <p>"Look at him! Hale Lin's cultivation base is similar to yours. He has been cultivating in the middle floor of the Sword Tower, yet he has managed to come out safely," said Sellers Wen, watching the man's receding figure with satisfaction. "He is much better than you, and is likely to be chosen."</p>

  <p>"Really?" the young man asked. His eyes held a trace of envy.</p>

  <p>There were two ways to advance in Dragon City. The first one was to start as a Flag Master, become an Alliance Chief, and then rise to a Oneness Guard. It was a long and difficult process.</p>

  <p>The second road was more straightforward. To advance, you had to be chosen by the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>This was a shortcut that many warriors in the Dragon City yearned to take.</p>

  <p>However, only those who had the most talent and strength were ever chosen by the Oneness Sky Palace. It was an option only given to a few geniuses.</p>

  <p>The vast majority of warriors could only advance one step at a time.</p>

  <p>Sellers Wen saw the disconsolate look on the young man's face and patted him on the back. "You have just reached the Other Shore Realm. Keep working hard! You must try to have a good command of the Other Shore Token, and maybe you can even catch up with Hale. After all, while he is better than you, you are also better than many people on your same level in Dragon City."</p>

  <p>Sellers Wen was in charge of the Sword Tower that had a different mandate than the others. He had the task of selecting the best disciples for the Oneness Sky Palace, and was often on the lookout for great talents and geniuses in Dragon City who would be worthy of joining it.</p>

  <p>It was a pity that only Hale Lin seemed to meet his high standards. For now, anyway.</p>

  <p>The young man perked up a little at Sellers Wen's encouraging words.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, another door of the Sword Tower opened. This time, it was Zheng who came out.</p>

  <p>Zheng had just completed a challenge that was hard even for him. He had been caught off guard to face sixteen huge swords guarding the entrance of the cave, each one thrice as powerful as an ordinary sword.</p>

  <p>He had to admit that he'd gotten lucky.</p>

  <p>He had managed to make it through, but it could have gone the other way, too. He couldn't deal with the ordinary swords just through the Three Annihilation Strike, and he couldn't deal with the huge swords just through the Nine-Flash Light-splitting Swordsmanship. It could be said that both skills contributed a lot to his success.</p>

  <p>At any rate, he'd been successful and escaped the room safely.</p>

  <p>Upon leaving the room, he saw the young man and the old man staring at him. He was confused and asked, "Is anything wrong?"</p>

  <p>"Master Sellers, am I seeing things?" the young man asked, his eyes wide.</p>

  <p>Sellers Wen was as dumbfounded as the young man, but thankfully his face was concealed partially by a mask, and no one could see his expression.</p>

  <p>He had been absolutely certain that Zheng would get kicked out of the room.</p>

  <p>In fact, one of the reasons he was loitering in this area was to wait for him to get kicked out, so that he could mock him. When he saw Zheng walk safely out of the room, he was genuinely surprised and lost for words.</p>

  <p>The young man was impervious to Sellers Wen's inner turmoil. He said,</p>

  <p>"Master Sellers, this man hasn't even entered the Other Shore yet. You can tell from his aura that he has only passed the fourth or fifth line at most."</p>

  <p>Sellers Wen had never seen such a thing.</p>

  <p>The young man was right; Zheng had not reached the Other Shore, and he had only passed the fourth or fifth line on the Sea of Truth. Yet here he was, safely emerging from his cultivation room of the Sword Tower.</p>

  <p>Having watched tens of millions of people coming and going from Dragon City all these years, Sellers Wen had never seen anyone like Zheng before.</p>

  <p>"How did you do it? Did you cheat?" Sellers Wen asked Zheng in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"Cheat?" Zheng looked taken aback and offended by the accusation. "How can I cheat in the cave?"</p>

  <p>The cave was surrounded on all sides by swords, and there was only one way out. He couldn't have cheated. No one could.</p>

  <p>Sellers Wen quickly realized that it was impossible for Zheng to have cheated.</p>

  <p>"How did you open the door?"</p>

  <p>This time Zheng looked confused. "Well...I put my hand on the door and then I pushed it open. How else could it be opened? Did I break a rule?"</p>

  <p>"No, of course not," Sellers Wen said, forcing an awkward smile.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the young man was in shock too, and covered his face with his hands.</p>

  <p>For him, Hale Lin had always been the person he aspired to emulate.</p>

  <p>Among his peers, Hale Lin was the gold standard for success.</p>

  <p>But now, an even more powerful person turned up. He had not reached the Other Shore Realm and yet he had just opened a door in the Sword Tower.</p>

  <p>Even the talents from the Oneness Sky Palace could not have been able to accomplish such a feat.</p>

  <p>"Who are you? Where are you from? What is your name?" Sellers Wen asked, eager to find out more about this man.</p>

  <p>Zheng hesitated, wondering why the old man was asking suspiciously about his background. "Why do you need to know that information?"</p>

  <p>"Well..." Sellers Wen studied Zheng. So, this man was unfamiliar with the customs of Dragon City. "It will be useful to you, naturally. For example, once I know your background, I can send you where you want to go."</p>

  <p>Zheng saw that Sellers Wen was serious. With a shrug and a smile, he answered the questions he had been asked.</p>

  <p>Most probably, the old man wanted to send him to the Oneness Sky Palace, but Zheng didn't think the sect would want him. Otherwise, it would have been made clear by now.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't mind staying in Dragon City. He had no great interest in the Oneness Sky Palace. With enough divine crystals, on his own he could pass through the Sea of Truth and strengthen his shortcomings.</p>

  <p>But Sellers Wen had other plans. As soon as Zheng left, the old man rushed to the Oneness Mountain.</p>

  <p>He had been tracking Hale Lin, monitoring him to see when he would be ready to be admitted to the Oneness Sky Palace. But he had to put that aside for the moment. Zheng's incredible performance did not require any further period of inspection. There was no need to delay and keep Zheng in Dragon City. He was ready.</p>

  <p>When Sellers Wen was halfway up the mountain, he found himself in an illusory place.</p>

  <p>A colorful mist surrounded him. Just ahead, there was a bright, gleaming palace. He walked into the palace and went straight to the main hall.</p>

  <p>He said to the guards, "Excuse me, I'm Sellers Wen. May I meet with Master Calum?"</p>

  <p>A voice sounded behind him. "Master Calum won't agree to see you. You should leave."</p>

  <p>Sellers Wen turned to see Athemar. Startled, he clasped his hands together and bowed. Athemar was one of the Oneness Governors, and Sellers Wen was bound to show him respect.</p>

  <p>"Master Athemar, did you say Master Calum wouldn't agree to see me?</p>

  <p>Why not?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Athemar smiled. "Let me guess. You want to tell Master Calum about a man named  Zheng Luo, right?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, exactly! He just passed the test of the Sword Tower. Although it was on the first floor, he? "</p>

  <p>Athemar interrupted him. "He did it even though he has not yet reached the Other Shore Realm, right?"</p>

  <p>"Do you already know of Zheng, Master Athemar?" Sellers Wen asked, looking confused.</p>

  <p>"Yes. He is a disciple of the Sword Light Palace that I built. Besides, I was the one who introduced him to the Oneness Sky Palace," said Athemar. He wore a strange expression.</p>

  <p>The peace between the Oneness Mountain and the Origin Mountain had recently been disturbed because of Zheng.</p>
