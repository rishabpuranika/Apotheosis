<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng did not think the price was low. Instead, it was much higher than his expectation.</p>

  <p>Although he knew that the crystal core of fire scorpion lion was very precious, he had never presumed that the price would be this high.</p>

  <p>The crystal core of a queen blade locust was exchanged for only 1000 points, which was equal to two thousand cubic crystals. And he had thought that the crystal core of fire scorpion lion would be valued at a similar price.</p>

  <p>But the basic price, as he heard, was 15 times higher than that of the queen blade locust! That was totally beyond his calculations.</p>

  <p>This lack of understanding of how the market worked showed how little experience Zheng had.</p>

  <p>After all, the blade locust was known for its rapid reproduction rate.</p>

  <p>Every year, dozens or hundreds of queen blade locusts were killed at Dragon Fort. And this productivity, of course, lowered the price of the crystal core of a queen blade locust.</p>

  <p>A fire scorpion lion, however, was not the same. They had been hunted to the verge of extinction throughout the whole Eastern Region. It was rare to see a fire scorpion lion, not to mention an adult one. And its crystal core had special effects in the refining of weapons or medicines.</p>

  <p>Thus, the value of these two kinds of crystal cores was very different, and the gap was huge.</p>

  <p>Hearing that Zheng did not reject their proposed basic price, Nestor continued to say, "But if we add this to the lot today, we will have two outstanding treasures at this auction. So, I think it would be better to present the crystal core of fire scorpion lion in the next auction, where it will fetch a higher price... " Nestor had the same idea as Wurth. It would be worthwhile to conduct an auction for this crystal core only.</p>

  <p>"No need to wait for the next auction. My friend thinks that it is okay to combine it in today's auction. Nestor, please put away this crystal core of fire scorpion lion and prepare for the auction later," Wurth calmly instructed.</p>

  <p>"Okay, young master, I will do that," Nestor now knew that the timing for the auction of the crystal core was nonnegotiable. With a quick shake of his head, Nestor asked an assistant to bring a luxurious box. He then carefully put the crystal core in it and sealed the box.</p>

  <p>After completing all the arrangements for the crystal core's auction, Wurth walked back to the auction room with Zheng. As it was a busy time for the auction, he managed to exchange simple greetings with Sean and other friends, and then went out.</p>

  <p>By this time the auction room was full of people and refiners.</p>

  <p>The participants present were very different. Some of them were individual refiners who had journeyed here alone. Some were from noble clans and had been accompanied by their acquaintances in hopes of sharing information and advice.</p>

  <p>However, most of them were nature creatures.</p>

  <p>Judging from their breaths, Zheng estimated that the people in the VIP rooms had greater strength. Although those people could cover or suppress their level, Zheng still could feel their strength. It was not hard to figure out that these refiners had already exceeded the nature level.</p>

  <p>Zheng did not have much time to look around the auction house. Within a few minutes, Nestor came to the high platform.</p>

  <p>The people of the Imperial Capital knew Nestor as the chief auctioneer of the Blessed Auction House. Generally, Nestor only presided over some large auctions. Since Nestor was here, it meant that rare treasures would be auctioned.</p>

  <p>After a brief introduction, Nestor clapped his hands. Then an assistant came to the stage with a luxurious box in his hands. The assistant carefully put the box on the big table on the stage and left. On seeing that the assistant had exited, Nestor walked to the table and started to introduce the first auction item with a calm tone. 
 </p>

  <p>"Here is the first item for auction today. It is very special. There are three pieces of purple epiphyllum. They require a small amount of life vitality and can blossom overnight! The basic price of these three pieces of purple epiphyllum is 300 cubic crystals. You can bid at any price higher than that!"</p>

  <p>After completing his short introduction of the first lot, Nestor opened the luxurious box and showed it to the audience. Three pieces of purple epiphyllum were in the box.</p>

  <p>At this time, some delicate ladies in the field cried in surprise. They were obviously attracted to these beautiful flowers.</p>

  <p>"Purple epiphyllum?" Zheng murmured when he heard the name of the flowers. His eyes lit up with the enthusiasm that he felt. He asked around, "This kind of flower can only be used as an ornament, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>Sean commented, "Yes, it has only ornamental value. The purple epiphyllum is very rare. It is also known as the world's most beautiful flower. And someone once said that if he could see the blossom of this flower just once in his lifetime, it would not be a pity."</p>

  <p>Nory could not understand this saying and shook his head. Then he said,</p>

  <p>"The flowers can only be used as an ornament and cannot be used as medicine. Even though they are beautiful, they are still useless. I am afraid that only arrogant and wealthy people from noble clans will buy these to send to their women as presents."</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded in agreement. "A few hundred cubic crystals might be expensive for many normal families. But noble clans can afford the cost and will find it worthy to amuse their lovers."</p>

  <p>Zheng was right. Although the purple epiphyllum had no help in refining, it still attracted a lot of young people's interest. The price went up from three hundred cubic crystals to eight hundred. Then it was bought by a noble clan member.</p>

  <p>Zheng, Sean, and Nory had accompanied Wurth to the auction house with the purpose of broadening their vision and seeing what an auction was for. Of course, they did not have any interest in luxurious flowers that had no benefits in refining.</p>

  <p>They did not have the money to buy these flowers either. Even if they could afford it, they would not spend their money on something which could only be used as an ornament.</p>

  <p>After the deal of the purple epiphyllum had been completed, Nestor started to introduce the next lot.</p>

  <p>"The second item is a spiritual weapon. Now, the Shura Battlefield is about to reopen. If you are armed with a spiritual weapon on the battlefield, you would feel it is easier to fight with Ogres and other monsters. This weapon is called the Heaven-shaking Dagger-axe.</p>

  <p>Though it has a rough shape, it is made of purple jade. The Heaven-shaking Dagger-axe is ranked as a low-level spiritual weapon, but its power is similar to that of a middle-level spiritual weapon. The base price is 2000 cubic crystals. You can start to bid now."</p>

  <p>'Two thousand cubic crystals? That is not so expensive!' Zheng thought. He was a little interested in this spiritual weapon.</p>

  <p>This Heaven-shaking Dagger-axe was a low-level spiritual weapon. Zheng did not care much about its power. Instead, he wondered about the iron essence he could obtain from such a weapon after refining it.</p>

  <p>He knew that a top-grade mysterious weapon usually generated five or ten drops of iron essence. Since a spiritual weapon was a level higher than a mysterious weapon, maybe it would generate 50 drops of iron essence, or, perhaps even 100 drops.</p>

  <p>On thinking of this possibility, Zheng became excited. He wanted to bid.</p>

  <p>As long as he could light up one dragon scale, his strength would grow.</p>

  <p>If ten dragon scales were lit at the same time, his strength would be doubled in a short period. Such an increase was definitely a significant improvement for him.</p>

  <p>If possible, Zheng planned to participate in the auction for this spiritual weapon.</p>

  <p>But the bid price increased so much that he abandoned his plan.</p>

  <p>"Two thousand and five hundred cubic crystals," one refiner shouted excitedly.</p>

  <p>"Two thousand and seven hundred," said another.</p>

  <p>"Three thousand cubic crystals!"</p>

  <p>Even though the Heaven-shaking Dagger-axe had a powerful name and it was indeed a spiritual weapon, its shape was rough and heavy. Zheng had thought that the bid would not be competitive. However, to his surprise, many refiners were interested in this weapon, and the price shot up in a short time.</p>
