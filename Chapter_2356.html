  <p>
</p>

  <p>The huge column of light appeared to be very close, but it took Luo Zheng a full five minutes to get to it.</p>

  <p>The cloaked men standing around the light column seemed to panic a little when they noticed Luo Zheng who was not far away now. They muttered something to each other and marched towards him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did not understand the language of the cloaked men, but judging by their tone and movements, he could sense that they weren't a welcoming committee.</p>

  <p>Two of them even held steel pitch forks and pointed them at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng remained calm. He chose not to get close to avoid annoying them, and instead quietly watched on the side.</p>

  <p>The sole reason that the consummate True Gods had entered this world was to obtain the jade seal.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng knew too little about this world and he needed to obtain some useful information as soon as possible. These cloaked men would play an important role in this quest.</p>

  <p>Strange bugs were scuttling about in the sand dunes in the desert, but within the scope of the light column, there was not a single bug. The cloaked crew were obviously familiar with the habits of these strange bugs.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng waited and observed not far away for a while.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he heard loud sounds in the sky.</p>

  <p>A group of black shadows were flying across the sky and circling around the huge light column.</p>

  <p>"Eagles?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng gazed at this scene. Although the light was dim, he still recognized that the black shadows were eagles.</p>

  <p>The black feathers of the eagles were camouflaged in the night sky. Their black eyes were sharp and feral.</p>

  <p>A cloaked man standing under the light column took out a green flute and played it gently. Guided by the melodious sound of the flute, the eagles pounced towards the light spots in the distance.</p>

  <p>An eagle flew down quickly, and stretched out its powerful claws to drag one of the bugs out of the sand dune. Then it tossed the hapless creature lightly in the air and swallowed it.</p>

  <p>"It turns out that these cloaked men are herding the eagles and the bugs are their fodder," Luo Zheng said to himself.</p>

  <p>The strange bugs in the desert were the food for the eagles, and luckily, they were inexhaustible.</p>

  <p>The eagles kept swooping down, and the strange bugs were unable to resist them. Each time they flew by, a light dot disappeared in the desert.</p>

  <p>This hunt lasted for almost an hour.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng still maintained a safe distance from the cloaked men. They thought that Luo Zheng was not a threat to them, so they didn't guard themselves against him.</p>

  <p>They paid no attention to Luo Zheng. Instead, they focused on playing the flutes and controlling the eagles.</p>

  <p>However, at this moment, a loud cry suddenly emanated from the sky.</p>

  <p>"Yo!"</p>

  <p>A ray of golden light flew across the sky.</p>

  <p>The moment the golden light appeared, the eagles got startled as well.</p>

  <p>Flapping their wings, they flew in all directions in a frenzy.</p>

  <p>"A golden roc!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes flashed in surprise.</p>

  <p>The golden light turned out to be a huge golden roc, which was much larger than the eagles. It stretched out its thick wings, which were several hundred feet long. It scratched the head of an eagle and opened its mouth to swallow the bird before it could fall down.</p>

  <p>"Yo!"</p>

  <p>The golden roc seemed to be very excited. With a flap of its golden wings, it chased another eagle. Its huge claw suddenly pinched and ripped up another eagle to pieces.</p>

  <p>The cloaked men were also in a state of panic. After discussing for a while, they began to play the flutes in their hands, but the originally pleasant melody was now sharp and fierce.</p>

  <p>Encouraged by this new tune, the eagles turned around, turned into black spirals, and shot towards the golden roc.</p>

  <p>One eagle was no match for the golden roc, but a flock of eagles together possessed enough strength to fight the large golden roc. The eagles kept attacking the golden roc swiftly and relentlessly, and golden feathers rained down from the sky.</p>

  <p>"Yo! Yo!"</p>

  <p>The eagles had the upper hand now.</p>

  <p>Two long howls sounded from the distance. Two golden lights were zooming towards them. Two more golden rocs had arrived as reinforcements!</p>

  <p>Now the cloaked men were thrown into a tizzy.</p>

  <p>It was already proving to be quite challenging for their eagles to fight one golden roc. Their birds would probably be killed by three golden rocs.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the golden rocs flew much faster than the eagles. Even if they wanted to flee, there was no way for them to escape or hide in the vast desert. And once the eagles were killed by the golden rocs, the cloaked men would also be murdered by them.</p>

  <p>"Yo!"</p>

  <p>One eagle was trying to escape, but a golden roc tore half of its wing. Its body rolled in the air and it fell down towards the desert rapidly. It landed not far from Luo Zheng with a thud.</p>

  <p>"Yo!"</p>

  <p>The golden roc let out a high pitched scream, turned into a golden light and rushed down towards its victim.</p>

  <p>The black eagle on the ground had a special appearance? a ring of white feathers grew on its neck. It had been quite ferocious when it fought with the golden roc but it ended up failing miserably. Blood and sand covered its wound. It was too weak to resist, and deep despair was visible in its eyes.</p>

  <p>Seeing the helpless bird, Luo Zheng felt a sudden pity and got down on his knees.</p>

  <p>Just then, the golden roc swooped down on its prey.</p>

  <p>"Now, it is the right time!" Luo Zheng yelled.</p>

  <p>He had transformed into a streak of light and dashed towards the golden roc.</p>

  <p>The golden roc had certainly noticed Luo Zheng, and it was smart enough to realize that he was not in the same group as the cloaked men, so it had ignored him.</p>

  <p>It never expected Luo Zheng to launch an attack at that moment.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng timed it perfectly. When he flew up, the golden roc had no opportunity to dodge the attack.</p>

  <p>Thump!</p>

  <p>The birds' skulls were the most fragile parts of their bodies. No matter how vicious the eagles and golden rocs were, their skulls were fragile.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Luo Zheng's attack was so powerful that even True Gods would not be able to resist it, let alone the golden roc.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's knees slammed into the golden roc's head with a loud bang.</p>

  <p>Before the golden roc could scream, its huge body rolled a few times on the ground and then stopped.</p>

  <p>"Yo! Yo!"</p>

  <p>Seeing this scene, the two golden rocs that were chasing the other eagles cried sadly. One of them wanted to avenge its companion and dove towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The cloaked men below the light column were probably worried about Luo Zheng's safety. They waved their flutes towards Luo Zheng, trying to alert him, urging him to duck.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng spread his arms slightly and the corners of his mouth curved upward. He stood there, making no attempts to dodge the oncoming assault.</p>

  <p>The moment the huge golden roc approached him, he brutally attacked it on its face.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Sand was flying around.</p>

  <p>The impact caused the yellow sand under Luo Zheng's feet to form a huge ripple which fanned out around him.</p>

  <p>The cloaked men stared blankly at the dust floating in the air. When the dust settled, what they saw shocked them.</p>

  <p>The golden roc lay motionless in front of Luo Zheng, and its head had been completely obliterated by the bombardment.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng balled his right hand into a fist and stared at the only golden roc in the sky with a smile. If this golden roc kept flying in the sky, he would have no way to deal with it. But if it zoomed down, it would be courting death!</p>

  <p>"Yo!"</p>

  <p>The golden roc circled in the air, eyeing Luo Zheng with its golden eyes. It realized that it was no match for the human, so it reluctantly retreated.</p>

  <p>After the golden roc left, the cloaked men under the light column whooped with joy and rushed towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Two of them raised their hands, bowed and patted their chests. Luo Zheng was confused with the gestures, but he understood that they were thanking him.</p>

  <p>Several cloaked men surrounded the eagle with the broken wing, and one of them bandaged up the wound, while the others looked very sad.</p>

  <p>The eagle with a white ring around its neck was special, but it might never fly high as its wing was broken.</p>

  <p>After the cloaked men tended to the eagle's wound, another one took out a bamboo flute and played it again.</p>

  <p>All the eagles flying in the sky descended and perched on the ground in a circle.</p>

  <p>One of the cloaked men patted the back of an eagle and motioned to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Are you asking me to ride on the eagle?" Luo Zheng raised his eyebrows slightly at this request.</p>
