<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's head had contained seven Latent Theurgies all this while.</p>

  <p>But after a while, these balls of theurgies were concealed so that no one could see them.</p>

  <p>The first Latent token that was activated was the Killing Intent Counterattack.</p>

  <p>This token would work whenever someone became hostile towards him.</p>

  <p>But even Luo Zheng couldn't help but shrink at the explosion that the Soul Suppressing Sword had sent through the ball. The mighty soul pressure had been released, causing his soul to stiffen.</p>

  <p>However, this was only an aftereffect.</p>

  <p>The Soul Suppressing Sword was then placed before Raymond, with Jayden and Mathew standing on either side of him.</p>

  <p>The moment they faced the Soul Suppressing Sword, their sense of self diminished and they began to feel small, like ants. The enormous soul pressure was like an infinite giant, and they were too weak to resist or escape.</p>

  <p>As a result, all three of them stood there like statues, until the Soul Suppressing Sword hit Raymond's head.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>A low muffled sound was heard.</p>

  <p>Once the Soul Suppressing Sword had killed Raymond's soul, it disappeared into his head.</p>

  <p>Raymond's eyes flashed, emitting two rays of dazzling golden light, before becoming dull and remote.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh..."</p>

  <p>Now that Raymond's body had lost its soul, it began to fall backwards into the black water.</p>

  <p>Frightened at this sight, Jayden and Mathew didn't stop Raymond's body, and let him fall into the black water.</p>

  <p>Pascal, who was still fleeing in the distance, turned around suddenly.</p>

  <p>Samuel, standing on the Desperation Plain, sensed what had happened through Pascal. His face darkened in shock.</p>

  <p>"What was that? How could it launch such a powerful soul attack?"</p>

  <p>There was probably no one in the divine land who could resist a soul attack of this level. Even a warrior at the Other Shore Realm would die if he or she were to touch it.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng also looked regretful.</p>

  <p>He had had a vague feeling that the Killing Intent Counterattack was a powerful weapon, but he hadn't expected the Soul Suppressing Sword to be so horrifying.</p>

  <p>It could chop off souls belonging to Demi-holy Beings and even Holy Beings and warriors at the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>Using it to kill a Demi-holy Being of the Tang Clan was a waste of its potential.</p>

  <p>"As its name suggests, the Killing Intent Counterattack will be triggered the moment it senses any killing intent. But why hadn't it been activated before?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was suspicious.</p>

  <p>There had been many creatures that had probably wanted to kill him on the way here.</p>

  <p>Liusu and the fiends were just a few of them.</p>

  <p>Why hadn't the Killing Intent Counterattack been activated when Luo Zheng had faced them? Why did the Soul Suppressing Sword choose to kill Raymond?</p>

  <p>After all, the fiends had also wanted to kill him.</p>

  <p>"It's because the fiends are not real living creatures, while Liusu and her siblings are just puppets," No. 9527 explained patiently. "The Latent Theurgies are used to deal with special situations. They need a lot of conditions before they are triggered, especially the Killing Intent Counterattack. It won't kill an ant just because it wants to kill you. It needs to distinguish the targets."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>He understood that in critical times, the Latent Theurgies could not only protect his life, but also have a reverse effect.</p>

  <p>Now that he had used a Latent token, he only had six left.</p>

  <p>Mathew's eyes narrowed as he stared at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>They hadn't expected a Demi-holy Being to die before they could even take action.</p>

  <p>Raymond's strength was on par with that of Jayden and Mathew.</p>

  <p>If this was Luo Zheng's real strength, both of them should turn around and run away as far as possible.</p>

  <p>"What's this token?" Jayden asked, his throat tight and voice almost a whisper.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, on the contrary, looked relaxed. He was satisfied with the power of the Soul Suppressing Sword. "Why should I tell you?"</p>

  <p>"This is not one of your abilities," Mathew said, narrowing his eyes even further. "Even a powerful warrior at the Other Shore Realm wouldn't be able to do it. It is probably some kind of a one-time magic weapon!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng hadn't used any magic weapon, but it looked to them that the Soul Suppressing Sword had shot out rather suddenly. Mathew, however, was close to the truth.</p>

  <p>In a way, the Latent Theurgies were like one-time magic weapons, but the owner couldn't control when they were triggered and how they worked.</p>

  <p>"What Mathew said is right. It's impossible for you to master such a token. And now that you've used it once, you won't be able to use it for a second time. You can't escape death since you don't have any other reliance." Saying this, Jayden pulled out a snake spear from a contraption on his waist.</p>

  <p>He had thought that if Luo Zheng didn't use any token, he wouldn't pose a threat to him.</p>

  <p>Mathew and Jayden were the most outstanding of the dozens of Demi-holy Beings on the Floating Islands. If they joined hands, they could definitely defeat Luo Zheng, who was merely a consummate True God.</p>

  <p>"Raymond met with an awful death. I will take revenge for him!"</p>

  <p>Mathew clenched his hand, causing beams of golden light to shoot out of his mouth. This golden light turned into incantations that were strangely shaped and merged and turned into a golden sword in his hand. This was the Invisible Incantation Sword, a token beyond the Indestructible Metal Divine Dao that Mathew had learned.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stood proudly, his huge thunder wings emitted cracking sounds from time to time.</p>

  <p>He smiled as he looked at the two Demi-holy Beings who were ready to fight, and said, "You were right. The token can only be used once. But I have other weapons!" As he spoke, he lifted the Shadow Bearing Sword.</p>

  <p>He had managed to greatly shock the two Demi-holy Beings with his words.</p>

  <p>It would be a lie to say that they were not worried. They were afraid that Luo Zheng would use other frightening magic weapons and that they would certainly get killed.</p>

  <p>After all, the experts of the Other Shore Realm had sent Luo Zheng to the divine land. Who knew what powerful magic weapons the experts had given him?</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng didn't move now that he had lifted the Shadow Bearing Sword.</p>

  <p>"On what do you rely now?" Mathew asked angrily. He had a feeling that he had been fooled.</p>

  <p>"I rely on myself!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had barely finished talking when the pair of thunder wings on his back stretched with a deafening sound.</p>

  <p>With an almighty crack, Luo Zheng turned into a thunderbolt and shot towards Mathew, the Shadow Bearing Sword in his hand.</p>

  <p>Mathew really doubted if Luo Zheng had any other secret weapon, or if he had anyone to help him remain calm.</p>

  <p>At Luo Zheng's answer, he burst out into laughter. He didn't know how a consummate True God could defeat two top-level Demi-holy Beings.</p>

  <p>But at the end of Luo Zheng's words, the Shadow Bearing Sword came hacking down on Mathew's head.</p>

  <p>"Do you think you can defeat us alone?"</p>

  <p>A trace of contempt appeared in Mathew's eyes. He raised his Invisible Incantation Sword to fend off Luo Zheng's Shadow Bearing Sword.</p>

  <p>It was obvious that he was treating Luo Zheng's sword as some kind of a joke.</p>

  <p>But the moment the two swords met, the Invisible Incantation Sword dissipated into hundreds of golden incantations.</p>

  <p>Mathew was stunned, again.</p>

  <p>He had expected everything, but he hadn't expected Luo Zheng to be able to destroy his Invisible Incantation Sword!</p>

  <p>The Indestructible Metal Divine Dao was known for its toughness and fierceness. The Invisible Incantation Sword was a token that was derived from the consummation level of the Indestructible Metal Divine Dao. It couldn't be destroyed so easily!</p>
