<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>If it were Dillon, he would first think about whether it was worth offending the people from the divine kingdom, and then come up with an appropriate solution. After all, even though the World Commercial Alliance was the strongest power in the Central Region, offending the people from the divine kingdom would invite trouble.</p>

  <p>If it were Haber, he probably wouldn't say anything, but he definitely wouldn't help them get rid of the Holy Maiden's bad luck.</p>

  <p>But it was none other than Hobbes� the most hot-tempered of them all.</p>

  <p>Hobbes could never stand these people of the divine kingdom from the very beginning. However, these people hadn't targeted him, so he didn't want to provoke them for no reason.</p>

  <p>But the handsome man wanted him to help the Holy Maiden. However, he was rude and brash. He even called him "Fatty!" Other than his wife, no one else had ever dared to call him that.</p>

  <p>"You! I am the..." The handsome man was just about to reveal his identity when Hobbes interrupted him.</p>

  <p>"I don't care even if you're the crown prince of the divine kingdom. It's useless!" he spat.</p>

  <p>Only moments ago, Luo Zheng had mocked the handsome man by calling him "the prince of the divine kingdom." Now Hobbes had gone a step further and called him "the crown prince." They didn't give a damn about this stranger's identity.</p>

  <p>The man was livid! The truth was that he really was a prince of one of the four divine kingdoms.</p>

  <p>Elder Gong interrupted, "Friend, can you expel our Holy Maiden's bad luck? We will certainly reward you."</p>

  <p>Hot-tempered as he was Hobbes was not stupid. He had been given the chance to undo someone's bad luck, and there were two people in front of him who were cursed. He had to compare the two first to determine who he would help.</p>

  <p>"Really? I wonder how you will thank me," Hobbes asked with a fiendish expression.</p>

  <p>How could Elder Gong think of a way to thank Hobbes at such short notice? Before he even had the chance to speak, a calm voice came from the other side, "When I have time, I'll help you set up a sect-protecting array!"</p>

  <p>It was Luo Zheng who spoke.</p>

  <p>Hobbes' eyes lit up at his offer. The Cloud Hall's sect-protecting array was indeed a powerful thing. It was said that it had almost killed Eddie. The World Commercial Alliance was obviously lying if they said they had no interest in it.</p>

  <p>If it weren't for the trip to Immortal Mist's celestial tomb, most of the fourth-grade sects would have already prepared to visit the Cloud Hall. No matter what the cost, they would ask Luo Zheng to set up a sect-protecting array for them.</p>

  <p>In fact even some third-grade sects were planning to visit Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Although not as powerful as the fourth-grade sects, some third-grade sects had secret treasures of which no one was aware. They had the opportunity to move Luo Zheng as well as the Cloud Hall. And if the price was right, Luo Zheng would gladly set up sect-protecting arrays for them.</p>

  <p>"Deal!" said Hobbes with a sinister laugh. Dillon and Haber laughed as well. They believed in Luo Zheng. Although Luo Zheng didn't give them an exact date, they were sure he would keep his word as he had agreed to set up the sect-protecting array.</p>

  <p>"Wait!" Elder Gong said with a gloomy face. "We can set up a sect-protecting array for you too."</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha!" Hobbes laughed and said, "I have heard a little about the rune techniques of the divine kingdom. However, they are nothing compared to Zheng's. Therefore, I reject!" With that, Hobbes pointed to Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>A ray of white light instantly shot towards her. As the light washed over her, the black cloud above her head finally dissipated. Her bad luck had been dispelled.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Mr. Yan," Ning Yudie said with a playful smile.</p>

  <p>"Don't thank me, thank Luo Zheng." Hobbes smirked at Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>The faces of the people of the divine kingdom fell.</p>

  <p>The Holy Maiden was the most important person in their group, and it so happened that Luo Zheng had used the calamity on her. If she got unlucky again and perished here, it would be difficult for them to face the wrath of the people above them. Even the prince of the divine kingdom wouldn't be able to face the consequences.</p>

  <p>However, these inhabitants of the Central Region clearly did not give a damn about the divine kingdom.</p>

  <p>"If we have to blame someone, we can only blame these two for being too naive," Elder Gong sighed. The prince and the Holy Maiden had grown up in the divine kingdom, and they always looked down upon people from the Sky Northern Region.</p>

  <p>And now that they had insulted the people from the Sky Northern Region, they would not show mercy towards them. The Holy Maiden had just used the calamity on Ning Yudie and faced immediate retaliation. What was worse was that they had more people. Apart from the group from the divine kingdom, the rest hailed from the Central Region. Even though they had clashes with each other, they became a family when facing the outsiders.</p>

  <p>So it looked like the situation was disadvantageous for the group from the divine kingdom. 'The prince sometimes has problems with his head, ' Elder Gong thought hatefully. Of course, he could never dare to say these words out loud.</p>

  <p>The beam of light was rotating constantly. Although this light repeatedly pointed to the divine kingdom group, they had been pretty lucky so far.</p>

  <p>There was only a punishment, while the rest were all rewards. The punishment hadn't caused any warrior to perish.</p>

  <p>But in the end, no one managed to obtain the "dispel bad luck" disk. If nobody was able to expel the Holy Maiden's bad luck, she would most likely die when her turn came. So every time the beam of light passed through her, it made people of the divine kingdom tremble in fear.</p>

  <p>Not long after, the beam was directed at the Poison King, Simon. Three disks appeared in front of him, and the third disk was completely white.</p>

  <p>"Dispel bad luck?" Hope flashed on the prince's face.</p>

  <p>Elder Gong and the other elders at the Life and Death Realm stared at Simon anxiously.</p>

  <p>Simon let out an evil laugh and stepped onto the third disk. A voice immediately announced, "You have obtained a chance to dispel�"</p>

  <p>The prince opened his mouth to speak. 'Something inappropriate, no doubt, ' thought Elder Gong. He spoke loudly in order to drown out the prince's voice, afraid that things might take a turn for the worse if the prince spoke.</p>

  <p>"Friend, only the Holy Maiden is suffering from bad luck. Could you please help her out by dispersing it?"</p>

  <p>Simon chuckled and asked, "Sure, but, what will I get in return?"</p>

  <p>"You can tell us what you want and we will do our best to fulfill it!" Elder Gong said while cupping his hands.</p>

  <p>"Great! How about you send people over to destroy all of these large sects and help me build a divine kingdom?" The Poison King announced his evil demand and laughed wickedly.</p>

  <p>Elder Gong winced at these words. He was prepared for his enemy to ask for something big, but he would have never thought that the Poison King was so greedy as to ask them to build an entire divine kingdom for him! Did this fellow think that creating a divine kingdom was as easy as building a kingdom of mortals?</p>

  <p>The leaders of the various sects in the Central Region stared daggers at Simon. This fellow seemed to be even more cruel and ambitious than Eddie. He wanted to destroy all the sects in the Central Region and establish a divine kingdom! It wasn't so simple! This was not child's play.</p>

  <p>Not that it was difficult for the warriors to set up a kingdom. For example, Kenneth of the Cloud Sect was a warrior at the late stage of the Internal Elixir Realm. He could easily overthrow the Burning Sky Empire, but he belonged to the Cloud Hall and would never do such a thing.</p>

  <p>But to set up a divine kingdom... It was a Herculean task.</p>

  <p>First of all, you had to have formidable strength to set up a divine kingdom.</p>

  <p>Only when one's own might was powerful enough would he be able to defeat all the warriors in the world and make them bow down to him.</p>

  <p>Even the four existing divine kingdoms were slowly built up over tens of thousands of years and not just by snapping one's fingers.</p>

  <p>"Friend, the establishment of a divine kingdom isn't something that can be accomplished overnight, so your request is a bit unreasonable�"</p>

  <p>Before Elder Gong finished his words, Simon sneered and said, "If that's the case, I'll just find someone to use it." Saying this, Simon reached out his hand.</p>

  <p>"Wait" Elder Gong cried out. "Friend, I'm telling you the truth. I would never lie to you on purpose. It's indeed impossible for me to help you build a divine kingdom. What I can offer you is the internal version of your cultivation method," he offered.</p>

  <p>"What? Internal version?" Simon was stunned.</p>

  <p>Elder Gong smiled wistfully. "The Scripture of Five Poisons is indeed a very precious cultivation method, but within our divine kingdom, we not only have an external version that you have cultivated, there is also an internal version. This internal version is exquisite, surpassing the external version by far more. Some records in the external version are not so accurate, but you can find the correct ones in the internal version."</p>

  <p>Simon considered Elder Gong's offer for a long time before saying, "If you swear on your warrior spirit to fulfill your promise, I will immediately disperse the Holy Maiden's misfortune."</p>
