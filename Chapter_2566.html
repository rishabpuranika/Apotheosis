  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Wait!" Adele abruptly cried out.</p>

  <p>Ramzi looked at his daughter and asked, "What's wrong, Adele?"</p>

  <p>Adele's beautiful eyes gazed at Luo Zheng, flashing with a hint of complexity.</p>

  <p>Giacomo brought Luo Zheng back because of the extraordinary strength he had displayed before Romeo. He was deemed to be eligible in participating in the battle between the two races.</p>

  <p>It was quite unexpected that Luo Zheng had the imperial-grade bloodline.</p>

  <p>Would he still be suitable to join the battle?</p>

  <p>"In the battle for the Sky South Bone Tower, Chandler and Farhann have been killed by Yellow Emperor race. Our chances of winning in the battle are very small. This time, I hope that Luo Zheng can fight the battle,"</p>

  <p>Adele directly voiced out her intention.</p>

  <p>Before Ramzi could say anything, the oldest man smiled faintly and stated, "If Luo Zheng wants to become stronger, cultivating the Wild God system in this world is a shortcut, and he can give full play to his blood power. He can fight as long as his safety is ensured."</p>

  <p>The exiles were far-sighted.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was just a top-rank True God, but it seemed that he had already comprehended two Truths of Divine Dao. His soul was far more powerful than that of an ordinary Wild God. Fighting against the mid-rank Wild Gods would not be too difficult for him with his strength.</p>

  <p>Besides, he had enough time to absorb the blood wild bones in the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>A smile appeared on Adele's face as she heard the words from the oldest man. She nodded in understanding and said, "I see."</p>

  <p>After the exiles departed, Adele gave out an order to summon the envoys of Yellow Emperor race.</p>

  <p>Shortly, several beams of light flew from the sky.</p>

  <p>A group of people showed themselves before them. The leader of the group had fair skin, dashing eyebrows and starry eyes. His face showed an expression full of pride.</p>

  <p>He was only a mid-rank Wild God given his cultivation base, but he didn't appear nervous at all being in the territory of the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>He spotted Adele but didn't show any respect. He casually took out a jade page and gently flipped it towards Adele. He then muttered arrogantly, "Catch it. This is the letter of challenge of our race!"</p>

  <p>"How dare you!"</p>

  <p>"How dare you!"</p>

  <p>Giacomo, Erik and the other clansmen burst into anger seeing how the young man acted arrogantly before Adele.</p>

  <p>Adele wasn't affected at all. Her expression was as calm as usual. With a flick of her slender fingers, she took over the jade page. She glanced at it and said in an emotionless voice, "You've already decided the candidates.</p>

  <p>How confident you are!"</p>

  <p>The young man smiled and said, "My race is the ruler of this world, so we are surely confident. We have designated five people to fight, but in my opinion, it's such a waste of time. I, David, alone will be enough."</p>

  <p>"So you are David of the Yellow Emperor race," Erik spoke with a frown on his face.</p>

  <p>A highly talented man had appeared in the Yellow Emperor race. It was said that the whole race used all their resources in order to train him.</p>

  <p>"Interesting! Why did your race send you to deliver the letter of challenge?" Giacomo raised his eyebrows and asked meaningfully,</p>

  <p>"Aren't you afraid of death?"</p>

  <p>The Nine Li race had suffered a great loss because of the bet the two race had made. The Yellow Emperor race killed Chandler and Farhann from their race, which left them in grim grievance.</p>

  <p>Needless to say, the Nine Li race would take revenge by all means. It never occurred to them that the Yellow Emperor race dared to send David to deliver the letter of challenge.</p>

  <p>"My father has said that you don't dare to hurt me," David said calmly.</p>

  <p>"Oh really? I'll kill you right now." Erik's aura suddenly rose up. He was like a wild ancient beast ready to pounce on a human to feast on.</p>

  <p>As an elder of the Nine Li race, Erik's strength was almost on par with that of Giacomo. He was considered to be capable of killing a mid-rank Wild God.</p>

  <p>David felt the oppression from Erik's aura and couldn't help but take two steps back. Despite the pressure, he still had a faint smile and spoke without fear, "You can try!"</p>

  <p>"Okay!" Erik was a man with a violent temper. How could he tolerate a young man who dared provoke him?</p>

  <p>Seeing that he was about to attack, Adele stretched out her hand and stopped him. She said, "The Yellow Emperor race killed our people in the Immemorial Wilderness. According to our agreement, it was allowed. So if we kill him here, it will be unreasonable."</p>

  <p>"But..." Erik couldn't accept to resign to calm down his annoyance.</p>

  <p>Adele looked back at David and said, "I've received your letter of challenge. Three months later, my Nine Li race will accept the battle.</p>

  <p>You can leave now."</p>

  <p>David looked at Adele with a look of disappointment. He purposely meant to provoke the Nine Li race as he came to deliver the letter of challenge on behalf of his race. He didn't expect that Adele would be so calm as if she didn't take their upcoming battle seriously. It left him a little disappointed.</p>

  <p>Before leaving, David laughed and said, "I hope that the losers of your race don't disappoint me in the battle!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, who had been silent all the time, slightly frowned upon hearing David's arrogant words.</p>

  <p>"Wait." Adele's indifferent voice rang out.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?" David turned around and asked.</p>

  <p>"Clap!"</p>

  <p>Everyone did not see how Adele made her move, but a clear five finger prints had already been left on David's face.</p>

  <p>Adele raised her hand and spoke in a cold voice, "You are an envoy from the Yellow Emperor race, so I can't kill you. But you're rude to me and my people, so I have to teach you a lesson. Go back and learn how to behave yourself from your elders."</p>

  <p>Adele was the Grand Elder of the Nine Li race, and so her strength was incredibly strong, being only second to that of the exiles in her race.</p>

  <p>The force of her slap was indeed great. The five finger prints had become more prominent in an instant, and half of David's face had been swollen.</p>

  <p>David expected a burst of pain. He touched his face and gently moistened his lips. "Grand Elder, you are right. I'll remember your lesson."</p>

  <p>After finishing his words, he left resolutely straight ahead without looking back.</p>

  <p>"What an arrogant guy!" Giacomo looked at their retreating backs sullenly.</p>

  <p>"Let me kill him halfway!" Erik urged.</p>

  <p>"No need for that. He did it on purpose. The Yellow Emperor race must have been prepared." Adele shook her head. "Rather than get angry with such a guy, it's better to prepare for the upcoming battle. We can't lose!"</p>

  <p>She then turned to Luo Zheng and instructed, "You have to cultivate with Elsa, Romeo, and Killian these days. I will give you enough cultivation resources. Three months later, you will fight the battle on behalf of our Nine Li race."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled and nodded.</p>

  <p>The Nine Li race was one of the top three races in this world. They had stored a massive amount of wild bones, which was an unimaginable number for ordinary Wild Gods.</p>

  <p>However in time, the blood wild bones of any great race were in short supply. They were distributed according to the clansmen's blood purity and the talent shown. Even so, the clansmen still got a small number of blood wild bones. A talent like Romeo could only obtain dozens of blood wild bones a year.</p>

  <p>But the situation made things different. As Luo Zheng had the imperial-grade bloodline, all the restrictions of distributing the blood wild bones weren't taken into consideration anymore.</p>
