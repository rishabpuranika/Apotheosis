<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 774 The Suppressive Force (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Even Imogen who was at the Life and Death Realm, could only display the might of someone at the preliminary stage of Virtual Tribulation Realm.</p>

  <p>A chill was felt by the troop; they feared that the enormous drop in their levels would be like lethal wounds that would soon devour them whole if they were not treated as soon as possible. Strength and cultivation were the most important things to warriors, if their tiers went down by a whole realm, they would not survive the numerous dangers lying dormant inside Mist's celestial tomb.</p>

  <p>Struck by indignation and unadulterated dread, they had grown oblivious to Zheng, the individual who stuck out like a sore thumb in the pack as he seemed to have no understanding of their qualms.</p>

  <p>His cultivation was the lowest in the group. It was only recently that he had reached the seventh level of the Illuminating Soul Realm through aggressive training and hard work. If he had gone through what the others were experiencing at present, he would have been reduced to the seventh grade of the nature level.</p>

  <p>Thankfully, it might be by pure, sheer luck that he had not been included in that same case.</p>

  <p>Zheng stared in astonishment, marveling at his own figure as he compared it to his associates.</p>

  <p>He was surprised at the apprehension of the many as he did not feel anything wrong with his own cultivation base.</p>

  <p>He turned around, examining if a comrade was like him when he got distracted by his own space ring. It hummed with a warmth that was almost scalding. He regarded it with a careful touch; It was the space ring Yudie gave him, designed specifically for women so he did not put it on his own hand.</p>

  <p>A space ring could not be placed with another one. The risk of causing a backlash upon clashing would cause a space storm inside the rings, thus destroying everything inside. To solve the issue, Zheng had found a string and hung it on his chest to serve as a necklace.</p>

  <p>Its capacity was large, more so than his prior one, so he transferred a portion of his items to the new one.</p>

  <p>He had encountered no troubles over it, at least not until now, when the ring with the engraved phoenix on it burnt in high temperatures.</p>

  <p>"What's going on?" muttered Zheng, his suspicions growing. It was likely that the item had helped him block the crushing force, but Tia's space ring should not have had any of that function.</p>

  <p>It rarely had any purpose other than the storage of objects. If it had any special skill, Tia would have told him beforehand.</p>

  <p>Biting his lip, he let his thoughts run wild with theories. 'It could be because of something inside, ' Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>With haste, he infused part of his soul power into the ring and began to scan through the held items. After a while, he discovered a small, glowing article that emitted a contained light.</p>

  <p>It was a token.</p>

  <p>Eyes widened in surprise, he examined the piece and tried to remember its origin. Zheng had obtained many tokens from the Eastern Region to the Central Region. It was a mix from the Cloud Sect, the Zhang Clan, The Cloud Hall and the World Commercial Alliance; all piled up in the corner of the storage.</p>

  <p>However, this unique material outshined all the others with the word 'wind' that was engraved on its surface.</p>

  <p>A jolt shook him as he replayed his memories. Zheng remembered, on his way back from White Emperor City, he had acquired this token from the fairy place of Dragon Valley in G country.</p>

  <p>"This token is from the fairy palace!"</p>

  <p>His heart thumped erratically at the revelation.</p>

  <p>After he had gotten it, he had left the palace and never returned.</p>

  <p>Zheng was told to have failed in owning the palace completely back then.</p>

  <p>According to Saul, he would only be considered as the nominal master of the fairy palace, but not its real owner.</p>

  <p>Therefore, he had never stepped foot in the fairy place again. There was no use after all; he did not have the authority to use the weapon refining workshops and pill refining rooms he had coveted.</p>

  <p>He did not leave empty-handed though; Saul had given him the token with the carved word 'Wind' of the Eight Diagrams on its exterior.</p>

  <p>It was given as protection against the attacks of the humongous puppets back in the fairy palace. Regretfully, it was deemed worthless and of no use in the Eastern Region or the Central Region so it had always been kept away at the corner of the space ring.</p>

  <p>He never would have thought that it would prove its value here. After he entered Mist's celestial tomb, the token with Wind actually helped him to resist the suppressive force!</p>

  <p>"The fairy palace and the celestial tomb…" He trailed off in thought, musing on the connection of the two. It was probable that the master of the fairy palace had a relationship with the immortal, Mist, or in another context, Mist could be the owner of the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>Scratching his head in consideration, he concluded that there was no clue or way to answer his own conjectures. He sighed, settling instead on the good news that the token permitted him immunity to the taxing suppression.</p>

  <p>Zheng was at the Illuminating Soul Realm, and had the prowess to vanquish warriors of the Internal Elixir Realm. That signified that in his current standing, he would be able to crush the Virtual Tribulation Realm masters that had been downgraded to the Internal Elixir Realm.</p>

  <p>He had the power to battle them here in Mist's celestial tomb.</p>

  <p>A faint smirk cracked his lips. This was a secret for him to bear at the moment, as he was with a group from the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>The team gathered their own bearings upon the initial upset and continued on their journey. They could no longer do anything about their status and could only hope that the experience they had gained from skirmishes and wars would not simply be erased and would help them in facing against peril. Cautiousness lined their steps as they passed through the long corridor, finally arriving at the entrance. They were about to release their defensive stances when a burst of cold wind pushed them back, hearing Imogen's wary voice shouting back in trepidation, "Everyone, be careful!</p>

  <p>Something is coming!"</p>
