<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng had long since heard of the Calculation Civilization.</p>

  <p>They were the ones who advocated for another way to complete the Finale Way.</p>

  <p>Instead of relying on the Other Shore, the Calculation Civilization completely abandoned that strategy and used their own understanding of space, time, and energy to carry out the Finale Way.</p>

  <p>It was said that they almost succeeded but that claim was never confirmed since very little trace of their culture and history remained, which was why not a lot of civilizations believed they were able to almost complete the Finale Way.</p>

  <p>Despite that, however, the Primeval Lord of Heaven still acutely learned this. He put the information about the Energy Shaft into the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Tree.</p>

  <p>The Pear Hill finally chose to let Yan cultivate the Energy Shaft. In the Chaotic Source World, she had used it once.</p>

  <p>However, it was worth noting that the Energy Shaft she wielded was only rudimentary. The real Energy Shaft could alter time, space, and energy freely. Its power was unimaginably great.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth and Libby did not have much of a reaction towards the green figure.</p>

  <p>Libby had never heard of the Calculation Civilization or the Heavenly Obsession Civilization before. Elizabeth knew a bit about them but never really thought highly of them. She only felt curious, at most, as to how exactly such an unknown civilization lived in two rounds of chaos and built a temple here.</p>

  <p>Zheng shared their thoughts. "A civilization can only go through one chaotic era. How could you be able to go through two?" he remarked in mild disbelief.</p>

  <p>It was the Primeval Lord of Heaven who made Zheng ask the question.</p>

  <p>In order to sow the seeds of the human race, the Primeval Lord of Heaven paid a heavy price and it was only by taking advantage of the opportunity when the chaotic era moved onto the next one was he able to succeed.</p>

  <p>For the Heavenly Obsession Civilization to have served as a ruling civilization in two chaotic eras was unheard of!</p>

  <p>"Because we discovered the method of passing down our civilization," the green being answered.</p>

  <p>As it spoke, numerous insects hatched on the wall in front of Zheng.</p>

  <p>These insects were life fireflies, emitting flickering lights that danced all around them.</p>

  <p>"Our civilization is different from other civilizations," the green figure continued. "These are our real forms."</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded in understanding, his expression unchanged.</p>

  <p>It was very common for insects to form civilizations.</p>

  <p>At least the Regal Jade Civilization and the Metal Civilization were both rarer compared to this collective of light-emitting insects.</p>

  <p>"In our Calculation Civilization, male members release red light while female members release green..."</p>

  <p>As the green figure continued to explain, the insects flew around and lined up in an orderly way.</p>

  <p>Dots of red and green light paired up with each other. As the insects bonded, red and green light began to flash constantly.</p>

  <p>The sight of these lights puzzled Zheng. "What on earth is this?" he muttered in amazement.</p>

  <p>It wasn't just him. Both Elizabeth and Libby were equally, if not more, confused.</p>

  <p>"This is a calculation method," the green figure answered. "You humans have ten fingers and calculate with the decimal system but for us, we count by two colors, red and green, with the binary system..."</p>

  <p>This talk about counting methods confused Zheng but the Primeval Lord of Heaven appeared above him and directly asked his question. "What is the advantage of this binary system?"</p>

  <p>"Advantage?" the green figure repeated. "The advantage is that we have unparalleled calculation ability."</p>

  <p>With this revelation, the scene before them began to change.</p>

  <p>Tens of thousands, millions, hundreds of millions...</p>

  <p>Red and green lined up together and flickered continuously. As the insects gathered together, they calculated the results and communicated with each other.</p>

  <p>"Such a special method of calculation!" the Primeval Lord of Heaven exclaimed with excitement. "Just how powerful is it?"</p>

  <p>"It can easily decipher Sanskrit words," the green figure replied.</p>

  <p>When the Primeval Lord of Heaven heard this, his expression changed.</p>

  <p>For so many years, Geoffrey was the only one he knew who was able to decipher Sanskrit words with his inborn ability. The boy was just able to understand the words naturally!</p>

  <p>The Calculation Civilization's method was completely different. They deciphered Sanskrit words through terrifying calculation! As a result, the Sanskrit words, which might be secrets to others, were nothing mysterious to them.</p>

  <p>It was through their faultless calculation method that the civilization was able to decipher all Sanskrit words and evolved at such a fast pace.</p>

  <p>"If that's the case then why does nobody know of your civilization?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked.</p>

  <p>He had a point. Such an advanced ruling civilization would've definitely left marks on the Other Shore, not unverifiable rumors.</p>

  <p>Zheng couldn't help but nod in agreement.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha..."</p>

  <p>To their surprise, the green figure laughed. "We're too small, even smaller than the tiniest mosquito in your world. It's difficult for individuals in our civilization to increase their strength all alone."</p>

  <p>It was indeed true. The insects were incredibly small, just like the indecipherable grains of sand on a beach.</p>

  <p>A civilization of micro-individuals would have trouble producing powerful existences.</p>

  <p>"Don't be mistaken though. Even if we are small, we still have the means to cultivate. An individual's strength may not be that impressive, but together..."</p>

  <p>Countless insects began to appear and flash a barrage of lights on the wall.</p>

  <p>These insects combined in a special way to form an indomitable force that could fight against ferocious beasts in that chaotic era.</p>

  <p>Alone, they were weak, but together, they could be unstoppable. Thus, the Calculation Civilization cultivated as a unit.</p>

  <p>This was the same method No. 9527 adopted inside the Chaos Ancient God Gerald's mind. Each soul fragment had a mind of its own but combined, they formed a complete whole.</p>

  <p>"Soon enough, our Calculation Civilization became the ruling civilization in the chaos. Like other ruling civilizations, we also wanted to complete the Finale Way. We climbed towards the higher stages of the Other Shore step by step until we saw the starry sky..."</p>

  <p>This description was understood by both Zheng and the Primeval Lord of Heaven.</p>

  <p>The green figure was no doubt talking about the Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>Libby, however, was confused. "What starry sky?" It seemed the more she listened, the less she was actually able to learn since she couldn't understand anything.</p>

  <p>"I think it's the starry sky of Stage Thirty-three. The one that leads to a world outside the chaos," Zheng explained.</p>

  <p>"Have you ever been there?" she asked. "How do you know about it? Wait, since you know about it, that means you have been there, right? Am I right?" she asked, throwing out a series of questions but did not give Zheng the chance to answer any.</p>

  <p>A trace of helplessness appeared on his face. "I'll tell you later."</p>

  <p>This exchange was ignored by the Primeval Lord of Heaven who had more questions for the green figure. "Can you also understand what is in that starry sky through calculation?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"So long as our calculation ability is powerful and advanced enough then we can understand everything in the starry sky. In fact, we almost achieved such a feat," the green figure answered.</p>
