<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>This was only a guess from Dora. She felt Zheng's unwillingness to reveal his identity so she wouldn't probe any further.</p>

  <p>Pressure soared with every inch closer to the first line.</p>

  <p>Even Dora could feel the pressure ahead— forceful and burdensome.</p>

  <p>Surprise became of her when she looked at Zheng still standing on the boat, as though frozen solid.</p>

  <p>Even with just a small pool of experience, it was clear Zheng possessed strength enough to come here without the help of the soul pill!</p>

  <p>As Zheng rushed forward alone, the people who had been wandering around them also approached in their Truth Boats and followed closely behind Dora.</p>

  <p>With the presence of a leader, the people who followed felt the pressure lighten on their shoulders. This was what they wanted.</p>

  <p>Soon, the ten-odd Truth Boats lined up like a dragon, rushing towards the first line.</p>

  <p>They were met with a shockingly powerful breeze of icy wind a thousand feet away from the first line.</p>

  <p>It was said that the sea water across the line had caused the strong wind.</p>

  <p>Phew! Whoosh! Each icy gust was stronger than the last, leaving a chilly sensation down everyone's spine.</p>

  <p>The wind blew on Zheng's Soul of Light so hard he felt as though it had pierced into his body like fine needles.</p>

  <p>'To pass the Sea of Truth in the form of Soul of Light is indeed more difficult than to do it in the form of a corporeal body...'</p>

  <p>Zheng gritted his teeth, while enduring the cutting wind and the pressure.</p>

  <p>But Zheng was wrong. Crossing the Sea of Truth in the form of a corporeal body wasn't easier than to do that in the form of Soul of Light. It was more difficult for those who cultivated the Ancient God Cultivation Method to cross the Sea of Truth. Since time immemorial, many warriors had attempted to cross the first line but were met with the fate of a severed life.</p>

  <p>Countless people were burnt to ashes by the red sea.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng's corporeal body was unusually strong. His strength made it possible for him to safely break through the first line of Sea of Truth last time.</p>

  <p>Those who followed them all took out some soul pills and swallowed them as soon as they reached a thousand feet from the first line.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, their Souls of Light were reinvigorated. Even with the whipping of the wind, their souls remained firm and unyielding.</p>

  <p>Some people had to eat three or four pills in a row because one soul pill was not enough.</p>

  <p>Yet others were not so fortunate. They didn't have any spare soul pills at hand. After taking the only one they had, they could only rely on their will power to get through.</p>

  <p>At nine hundred feet away from the first line, Zheng still had no intention of taking a soul pill. He knew how dangerous it was to go on without the pill.</p>

  <p>Still, he tested how long he could endure what seemed to be an insurmountable mountain.</p>

  <p>When all that stood between them and the first line was a distance of eight hundred feet, some people could not hold on any longer.</p>

  <p>A man shouted, "I...I can't take this anymore. I'm turning back now!" His voice was shaking just as much as his whole body was.</p>

  <p>In an instant, he turned back his boat and left the fleet, sailing away from the first line as fast as he could.</p>

  <p>It wasn't the first time for most of the followers to try to get past the first line. Most warriors had attempted many times before they finally made it.</p>

  <p>Others, whose odds weren't in their favor, died trying.</p>

  <p>It wasn't long until seven hundred feet remained.</p>

  <p>Zheng's mouth was parched, his tongue scorched, and he felt a chill all over his body.</p>

  <p>Naturally, anybody with a Soul of Light would not suffer from a dry mouth.</p>

  <p>Zheng deduced this was an illusion caused by the powerful pressure.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Dora didn't swallow the soul pill either. She continued to hold on without it.</p>

  <p>In fact, it wasn't much of a challenge for her to cross the first line. Under the protection of her soul weapon, passing the first line came as a soft breeze.</p>

  <p>She knew Zheng intended to get through without the help of the soul pill. She wanted to know whether her Soul of Light was more powerful than his.</p>

  <p>It was no surprise that she felt just as much pressure as Zheng did. They both gritted their teeth and clenched their fists as they got closer to the first line.</p>

  <p>By the time they were five hundred feet away, six people had given up and left the fleet.</p>

  <p>Others, whose will power stayed kindled, continued taking soul pills to help them get through. Alas, this replenished power was quickly weakened under the pressure brought by the winds and the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>"Argh!"</p>

  <p>At this moment, a guy held his head and screamed painfully. Heads turned to him.</p>

  <p>The man went mad under great pressure and his Truth Boat cracked.</p>

  <p>"Use the Illusion Breaking Rune to get out of here!" someone urged him.</p>

  <p>By this time, it was evident in the man's face that all he wanted was the calmness of solid ground.</p>

  <p>"Your mind has been invaded, and even your Truth Boat is broken!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no! He can't hear our voices now..."</p>

  <p>The madman had no way to turn. He couldn't use the Illusion Breaking Rune to leave Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>As the man's Truth Boat cracked and gave way, he sank into the Sea of Truth. Never to be seen again.</p>

  <p>With a touch of the sea water, his Soul of Light vanished like a small ember dying in a raging snowstorm.</p>

  <p>'We've lost another one to the Sea of Truth...'</p>

  <p>Dora pursed her lips as she watched, her heart beating rapidly.</p>

  <p>She had heard of the countless people who had died in their attempt to pass the Sea of Truth. Nonetheless, she felt different when she saw it with her own eyes, like all hope had just been lost.</p>

  <p>Zheng stood still at the bow of the boat with an unchanged expression.</p>

  <p>He was aware of what had happened behind him. Still, he stayed unfazed because he had experienced too many disastrous things in his life. This was nothing different.</p>

  <p>Cultivation was never easy. Embarking on the path of practicing martial arts, cultivating the Godly Way, and then reaching the Other Shore Realm...</p>

  <p>Countless creatures died trying to make it to the next level.</p>

  <p>The only difference was, the warriors in universes were secondary creatures. But they were living creatures too, possessing their own wisdom and souls. Was there any difference between them and these people from the divine land and those from the Source World?</p>

  <p>The stronger the pressure Zheng faced, the more determined he became.</p>

  <p>His Soul of Light was strong like a rock. He stood firmly on the boat and wholeheartedly drove the boat against the waves!</p>

  <p>Three hundred feet to go.</p>

  <p>The dividing line in the distance was clearer to him than ever before.</p>

  <p>'I'm still not going to take the soul pill!'</p>

  <p>Dora thought, clenching her teeth. She was stubborn and determined to get past without it.</p>

  <p>In the Source World, a maid hurriedly rushed out of the magnificent palace and shouted anxiously, "Oh, my God! Princess Dorothy... it seems that Princess Dorothy is suffering a great disaster!"</p>

  <p>At the sound of her screams, three streams of light immediately shot towards the palace.</p>

  <p>"Dorothy has just entered the Sea of Truth. No one within the first three lines can harm her, let alone the first line. What nonsense are you talking?" shouted a burly man who was visible in the first flash of golden light.</p>

  <p>"Let's get inside first!" In the second golden light was the figure of a tall, beautiful woman.</p>

  <p>The person in the last golden light said nothing and rushed directly into the palace.</p>

  <p>When the three of them saw what was going on inside, their faces changed dramatically.</p>

  <p>At the center of the palace sat a woman, cross-legged.</p>

  <p>The woman was extremely beautiful and naturally gave off a stream of elegance. Her features were as perfect as if she had come from a painting.</p>

  <p>Her entire body was as flawless as a perfect piece of jade.</p>

  <p>Just as the maid said, Dorothy didn't look good. Her body trembled, and her face looked extremely pale. She bit her lip so hard it was bleeding, and dark red blood flowed out from the corner of her mouth.</p>

  <p>"What the hell is going on? Even though she is just breaking through the first line, she should have activated the Necklace of Mystic Soul to protect herself!" the strapping man said anxiously.</p>
