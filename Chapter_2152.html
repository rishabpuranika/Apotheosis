<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2152 Repaying The Favor (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng had a little knowledge of the Five Elements Divine Dao, he really didn't have a very deep understanding of it.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was not the one to say what he had just said, but Master Evil in his mind. He would have been unable to provide that advice without Master Evil's help.</p>

  <p>Master Evil chuckled and said, "The powerhouses on the Floating Islands in the divine land simply think nothing of six times refined pills.</p>

  <p>If the wealthy clans' disciples were to encounter the two taboos, they'd just take a few pills. We ordinary True Gods have struggled so hard for so many years, and yet we don't even have a single five times refined pill. We had no other choice but to come up with this method."</p>

  <p>Master Evil had also trained in the Five Elements Divine Dao. In addition, he had personally visited the Five Elements Divine Dao Tablet and studied it. His understanding of the Five Elements Divine Dao far surpassed that of an ordinary low-rank True God.</p>

  <p>As he had said before, breaking the two taboos by using the force of iron was stupid. The two taboos were not problems for the Holy Beings and their disciples. In their eyes, five and six times refined pills were of no importance, so they wouldn't waste time thinking about a method for breaking the taboos. Even if some of them did come up with the idea, they would not bother to use the force of iron.</p>

  <p>Master Evil was considered a talent among the warriors with no strong backgrounds. With his super talent, he had reached the peak of mid-rank True God. There weren't many True Gods like Master Evil throughout all the divine land.</p>

  <p>After Master Wu had ordered the guards to chase away the bald martial artist, he looked out at the crowd and said, "That's all for today." He then stared at Luo Luo Zheng, as if afraid that Luo Luo Zheng would leave. "Follow me!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded at once his head and was immediately led by Master Wu into the Heavenly Han House.</p>

  <p>Today's lecture had ended earlier than expected, and all of the proving godly warriors had expressions of regret on their faces. Watching Luo Zheng's back as he walked away, they were green with envy.</p>

  <p>A few of the old proving godly warriors had stayed in Six-Burden Divine City for countless years, but they had gained nothing from it to date. The time when they joined the Heavenly Han House and cultivated the Divine Dao appeared as far away as ever.</p>

  <p>It was obvious to them that Luo Luo Zheng was still young, probably less than a hundred years old. With just a few words, he had been led into the Heavenly Han House by Master Wu, and they had every reason to be jealous.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Han House was a proving godly house of the Han Clan. In the eyes of proving godly warriors, it was one of the best places for cultivation, only second to the Floating Islands in Time Sea.</p>

  <p>Of course, to ordinary proving godly warriors and even many True Gods, the Floating Islands were just like legends. None of them truly had any extravagant hopes of ever setting foot in the Floating Islands, and thus, they didn't take the islands into consideration. In other words, the Heavenly Han House was the best place to cultivate in the Six-Burden Region.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng entered the gate of the Heavenly Han House and was welcomed into a wide and flat square. On both sides of the square were numerous corridors. Led by Master Wu, he walked along the corridors and entered the side of the Heavenly Han House, passing through a lush garden. The winding paths led to a secluded quiet place. The beautiful scenery there was pleasant to look at and easy on the eyes.</p>

  <p>Not long after reaching this beautiful spot, Luo Luo Zheng was brought to a courtyard, which was Master Wu's residence.</p>

  <p>Once Master Wu invited Luo Luo Zheng to sit down, he immediately followed up with a question. "Sir, is your surname Luo?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>"May I ask for your full name?" Master Wu asked.</p>

  <p>"I am Tianxing Luo," Luo Luo Zheng replied, cupping his hands together.</p>

  <p>Master Wu nodded. "I'm wondering which clan on the Floating Island you're from, and why you've come to Six-Burden Divine City."</p>

  <p>In Master Wu's eyes, not to mention the proving godly warriors, even low-rank True Gods couldn't be that smart. Given Luo Zheng's insight, it was very possible that he came from a wealthy and influential clan on the Floating Island.</p>

  <p>"I've never been to any Floating Island," Luo Luo Zheng quickly denied, with a shake of his head.</p>

  <p>And his answer had been honest. Let alone went to the Floating Islands, he had never even heard of what they looked like before.</p>

  <p>"Oh? Really? Is that true?" Master Wu laughed with disbelief. His face was still filled with doubt as he said, "You don't come from any of the Floating Islands, and yet you said that you came up with the idea of using iron to break down the two taboos on your own. How can I even begin to trust you?"</p>

  <p>It wasn't a question of talent. If Luo Zheng's comprehension of the Five Elements Divine Dao had reached such a level, it was simply impossible for him to be just a proving godly warrior. He should have become a True God long ago, and besides, by using the force of iron to break the two taboos, he would become a mid-rank True God in only ten thousand years.</p>

  <p>With this logic, it was easy to see why Master Wu thought Luo Luo Zheng was lying.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng knew that Master Wu would have such suspicions, so he had already prepared an explanation. "To be honest, the method of using the force of iron to break the two taboos wasn't invented solely by me, but left behind by a nameless senior. Master Wu, think about it. Those wealthy and influential clans on the Floating Islands would have to be really bored to come up with such a stupid method. They can have access to the Taboo-breaking Pills easily. Why would they even need to go through so much trouble?"</p>
