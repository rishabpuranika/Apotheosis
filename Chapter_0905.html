<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Although the Swallowing Birds didn't have high intelligence, their instincts told them that there was a powerful monster ahead of them, so they decided to block the humans' way to stop them from approaching the monster.</p>

  <p>The dense flock of birds circled around the humans as they swooped down, forming a giant tornado.</p>

  <p>"Fight!"</p>

  <p>Fabian furrowed his brows deeply, thinking that he was really done for this time.</p>

  <p>In fact, there was a dramatic change in the expressions of most of the top-level war lords. A few of them were able to maintain their composure, but the rest of them were wearing a look of despair. Even if they risked their lives in this situation, it would be no use. They lost all hope.</p>

  <p>It was easy for a person to give up on fighting if he thought that there was no chance of winning.</p>

  <p>"It's over. We're done for. It seems like we're going to die in the Dark Nether Cave!"</p>

  <p>"We're so unlucky! We should have retreated to the Tower of Sin long ago!"</p>

  <p>"We shouldn't even have come to the Dark Nether Cave in the first place.</p>

  <p>It's open every year, so why did we have to come here this year?"</p>

  <p>Some of them began to grumble with an expression of regret on their faces.</p>

  <p>Zheng's expression also darkened. Escaping from all the Swallowing Birds was going to be troublesome, even for him.</p>

  <p>However, he had never given up once in his life. Even in the face of certain death situations, he would still keep fighting.</p>

  <p>But now, the fighting spirit of the top-level war lords had completely dissipated. From the looks of it, all of them had given up on resisting.</p>

  <p>Zheng shouted, "It's just a flock of birds. You're a group of top-level war lords and yet, you're so useless!</p>

  <p>So what if we die? Fight to the death or die like a coward, which one do you choose?</p>

  <p>Since we're going to die soon anyway, why don't we go all out?"</p>

  <p>As Zheng roared these words at them, his body began to glow with killing intent. After communicating with the Killing Sword Mountain, he began to unleash the surging malicious aura.</p>

  <p>Then, he swung his fists at the flock of birds swirling around them.</p>

  <p>Xun and Yolande hadn't said anything until now, but they didn't seem to want to give up either.</p>

  <p>Anyway, both Xun and Yolande were from the Upper World and possessed the strength of supreme warriors. They would remain calm even while facing the adversity of death.</p>

  <p>Being able to calmly face death was the most ideal state of mind for a warrior. This didn't mean that they had to be unafraid of death. They just had to understand how to treat the possibility of death and adjust their mentality accordingly.</p>

  <p>The top-level war lords had given up, but after hearing Zheng's words, they looked at him, Xun, and Yolande with a mixture of admiration and shame on their faces. These three juniors hadn't given up and yet they, top-level war lords, didn't have any morale at all.</p>

  <p>Now, many of them had a resolute expression on their faces.</p>

  <p>Zheng was right. Since death was imminent, why not just go all out and fight?</p>

  <p>So when the over a thousand birds drew closer, everyone began to display their unique skills.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>All sorts of attacks were unleashed into the sky.</p>

  <p>Flames, ice, lightning, fists, swords...</p>

  <p>These attacks actually managed to forcefully block the black mass of birds.</p>

  <p>Some of the birds were immediately riddled with holes and fell from the sky. Although their defensive capabilities were formidable, they still weren't able to withstand so many attacks at once.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, there were simply too many strange birds. The war lords only blocked the birds for a short period of time, and then many strange birds dispersed the attacks from below and once again surged forward.</p>

  <p>"We're really doomed this time..."</p>

  <p>"Let's fight to the death! Even if we're going to die, let's kill as many birds as we can."</p>

  <p>"You're right. Even if we die, we can't let these birds off that easily!"</p>

  <p>Just as everyone got ready to fight with their lives on the line, they heard another croak.</p>

  <p>The next second, they saw a huge tongue popping out from a deep black pond some distance away. The tongue was over a thousand feet wide. It stretched out and suddenly shot forward in their direction at the speed of lightning.</p>

  <p>In an instant, everyone saw a black shadow appear. It took them a moment to realize that the giant tongue was now almost above their heads.</p>

  <p>Compared to the huge tongue, the birds were as small as mosquitoes.</p>

  <p>Mucus was dripping down from the huge tongue. Even though everyone was standing a few dozen feet away from it, they could still sense the warm, rancid smell emitting from the tongue.</p>

  <p>"Everyone, be careful of the mucus on the tongue. It's extremely poisonous!" Fabian reminded them.</p>

  <p>However, just as he finished speaking, one of the top-level war lords was wrapped up by the viscous liquid that dripped from the tongue.</p>

  <p>The war lord didn't even have the time to scream before his entire body sizzled away into nothing. It was as if he had vanished in front of them.</p>

  <p>More importantly, the top-level war lord had been holding a low-grade sacred weapon in his hand, but it seemed that the weapon had melted away as well. The mucus was much more corrosive than they'd thought.</p>

  <p>Everyone's expression changed, including Zheng's.</p>

  <p>Zheng's body was a fairy weapon and was said to be immune to poison. But if this mucus could melt even a sacred weapon, his body wouldn't be able to withstand it.</p>

  <p>It was fortunate that the mucus was taking a long time to drip down. It wasn't difficult for them to avoid it as long as they stayed alert.</p>

  <p>The huge tongue kept rolling back and forth over everyone's head, catching the birds. A few moments later, most of the birds had been caught by the tongue.</p>

  <p>The remaining dozens of birds cried out and scattered in all directions.</p>

  <p>The birds that were firmly stuck to the tongue began to melt away in the mucus.</p>

  <p>Finally, the huge tongue withdrew. Zheng looked in the direction of the tongue to see what creature it belonged to. The light in the Dark Nether Cave was so weak that even top-level war lords weren't able to see what lay beyond a few meters.</p>

  <p>However, the green light in Zheng's eyes flashed and his clear pupils allowed him to clearly see the scene in the darkness.</p>

  <p>He saw a deep black pond in the distance. In the middle of the pond, there was a giant toad.</p>

  <p>"That's the Bull-like Giant Toad!"</p>

  <p>The body of the Bull-like Giant Toad was almost the size of a mountain.</p>

  <p>However, most of its body was hidden beneath the water of the deep pool.</p>

  <p>Only a pair of eyes the size of a house could be seen, emitting two streaks of dark red light.</p>

  <p>After curling back its tongue, the Bull-like Giant Toad let out a croak.</p>

  <p>And then, as if it felt that it wasn't enough, it let out another croak.</p>

  <p>The sound was so loud that it raised a big wave. At the same time, it spread toward Zheng. Zheng stood firmly and continued to stare at the toad. He watched as the Bull-like Giant Toad stretched out its two thick forelimbs to leave the pool.</p>

  <p>"It's coming over..." Zheng's heart tightened.</p>

  <p>At this time, the top-level war lords were still immersed in the joy and relief of surviving the onslaught of Swallowing Birds. They'd never imagined that they would be saved by a huge tongue that came out of nowhere. Although the tongue's mucus had corroded a top-level war lord, at least a majority of them had survived.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng was staring straight ahead and standing still, as if he had been glued to the ground.</p>

  <p>"All right, everyone. Hurry up and leave this place. Although we haven't entered the territory of the Bull-like Giant Toad, we're already very close. If it— " Fabian started saying in an extremely cautious tone.</p>

  <p>But before he could finish, Zheng shouted, "Everyone, run! Run in all directions!"</p>

  <p>And with that, the power of the dragon scales within his body exploded forth. With the strength of both his legs, he shot up into the sky.</p>

  <p>When everyone heard Zheng's warning and saw his swift escape, a strong sense of danger rose in their heart. The top-level war lords who had gathered there began dispersing in all directions.</p>

  <p>Just then, they saw the huge tongue shooting toward the spot where they had been standing just a moment ago.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The huge tongue made an eighty-feet wide crater in the ground. As for the mucus dripping from the tongue, it continuously corroded the ground, emitting sizzling sounds.</p>

  <p>Everyone's faces flashed with fear.</p>

  <p>For a moment, they all held their breaths. Then, the tongue started moving again. This time, it bounced up from the ground and shot toward Zheng.</p>
