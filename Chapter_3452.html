  <p>
</p>

  <p>When the spear radiance reached the Evil God's real body, the power was practically negligible? he remained unharmed.</p>

  <p>At the scene, Mount frowned. "Can you launch a second strike with your spear?"</p>

  <p>Khalid's swollen body returned to its original shape, his face looking grim.</p>

  <p>His injuries were bad and he had exerted all his strength into launching the strike. How could he launch another in his current state?</p>

  <p>"It's my turn now."</p>

  <p>From the cage formed by the Hypercube Imprisonment, the Evil God smirked. Once again, the black energy turned into four-legged snakes and rushed to him.</p>

  <p>Unable to penetrate the imprisonment, they clung to the surface and wrapped around it tightly, simultaneously gnawing at the barrier.</p>

  <p>Khalid's eyes twitched as he watched the scene. "Can these snakes bite open the cage?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe," Mount replied.</p>

  <p>"Then I'd better run away?"</p>

  <p>Khalid didn't want to die in the hands of the Evil God.</p>

  <p>In his hand, he already held over two hundred Chaotic Source Spirits? enough for him to reach the Chaotic Source Realm once he fused with them. Then, he'd be sent out naturally.</p>

  <p>A small section of warriors had already merged with the crystals, and they were released from the Chaotic Source World afterwards.</p>

  <p>But there were still a large number of people who hadn't gathered enough crystals? they could only expect to get a good share from the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>In a flash, Khalid's figure rushed toward the array.</p>

  <p>Watching Khalid run, Mount shook his head helplessly. What a good-for-nothing guy, he thought.</p>

  <p>But the Divine Farmer race and Bearing race were only allies? Mount had no right to stop him.</p>

  <p>He and Khalid were not on the same page.</p>

  <p>Mount was merely a passer-by in the Chaotic Source World, after all. He wanted to avoid making any enemies out of the people there.</p>

  <p>The Evil God's cruel and violent deeds shouldn't have had anything to do with Mount. But the former had killed Mya? that made it Mount's business.</p>

  <p>Seeing that the Evil God was temporarily sealed, everyone turned to the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>It was their only chance to kill the mother? they had to take the opportunity. So long as they obtained enough crystals, they didn't care what else the Evil God did.</p>

  <p>As Mount's figure flashed, he came to the side of the Taiyi Heaven Palace and Li Shan mountain warriors.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing?" Looking highly vigilant, Feng Ge stepped forward.</p>

  <p>As Yan stared at the tall, strong man, her eyes were as calm as water. She believed Luo Zheng still had a chance to return to this world, so long as Mount agreed to it.</p>

  <p>Not giving any mind to Feng Ge, Mount turned to Chaim, "Help me remove this."</p>

  <p>Initially, Chaim was conflicted? he didn't know whether or not he should help Mount out. It seemed that the latter was the only one present who could contend against the Evil God.</p>

  <p>"I can remove it if you agree to my conditions," Chaim said unhurriedly.</p>

  <p>Without hesitation, Mount replied, "Once the abacus is removed, I won't do anything to hurt the disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace or the warriors of the Li Shan mountain. I will keep my word."</p>

  <p>From what Chaim observed, Mount was someone who followed through on his promises.</p>

  <p>He believed Mount would do as he said.</p>

  <p>Still, he needed more than a simple guarantee.</p>

  <p>Before Chaim could say anything, from behind him, Sally chimed in, "If you let Luo Zheng back, consider the grudge between us written off!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, bring Luo Zheng back," Ling Shuang echoed.</p>

  <p>Mount had expected their request, of course. With a frown, he said, "If you had asked for anything else, I'd gladly do it for you. But Luo Zheng has disappeared from this world completely. I can't do anything to bring him back."</p>

  <p>His sincere answer made everyone's heart sink.</p>

  <p>"There's no hope for Luo Zheng's return?" Yan asked, her voice now low.</p>

  <p>After a moment of thought, Mount said, "Maybe there is. There's a more powerful being that might be able to bring him back. I can pass on your request, but not right now."</p>

  <p>After all, Mount only served as an avatar of the Chaos Ancient God? he wasn't the Chaos Ancient God himself.</p>

  <p>He couldn't reclaim deleted spaces, but he figured that the true Chaos Ancient God might have the ability to do so. But he didn't know that in fact even the true Chaos Ancient God was incapable of doing that.</p>

  <p>Everyone seemed rather upset? as it seemed that Mount wasn't lying.</p>

  <p>Although they couldn't completely comprehend Mount's space token, they knew that Luo Zheng's exile was not as simple as it seemed to be.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>Explosive sounds came from above as the four-legged black snakes consistently bit on the square prison.</p>

  <p>"If you don't undo this abacus, I'm afraid you'll all be in trouble? you won't even get to think about fighting against the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits. I hope you understand the stakes of your situation," Mount continued sincerely.</p>

  <p>While everyone was fighting, there were people who constantly rushed in from the periphery of the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>Neither the warriors of the Taiyi Heaven Palace nor those of the Li Shan mountain had obtained enough crystals. The warriors of the Taiyi Heaven Palace, in particular, were lacking, because many of the crystals were still in Luo Zheng's hands.</p>

  <p>It was crucial to get a share of crystals from the mother.</p>

  <p>Just as Chaim was still hesitant, the Hypercube Imprisonment that held the Evil God in was finally bitten through.</p>

  <p>Indeed, the Hypercube Imprisonment was ingenious, but the four-legged black snakes were valiant. With pure force transformed from energy, they had broken through the imprisonment.</p>

  <p>Although he remained quiet, Mount's earnest eyes were still on Chaim.</p>

  <p>Inwardly, Chaim sighed before walking up to the golden abacus beside Mount and said, "I hope you can keep your promise about asking the powerful being to release Luo Zheng."</p>

  <p>"I will." Mount nodded.</p>

  <p>"And..." Pointing a finger to the air, Chaim continued, "Beat him up!"</p>

  <p>"I will," said the other with an easy smile.</p>

  <p>Enemies and standpoints were ever-changing.</p>

  <p>The situation was shifting, along with the friends and foes.</p>

  <p>The moment Chaim took off the golden abacus, Mount flew backward, turning into an enormous roc. Once again, he was filled with vigorous energy as he emitted a strong, steady aura.</p>

  <p>When the Evil God broke out of the Hypercube Imprisonment, he saw how greatly Mount's momentum increased. A strange look crossed his eyes, which was then replaced by a strong fighting spirit. Once the blood power was activated all over his body, the two started fighting fiercely again.</p>

  <p>The two fought in the air for a while, disappearing and fighting head-on at times.</p>

  <p>Leading the warriors and disciples, Chaim and Yan joined the group fighting the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>By this time, the mother's speed had been greatly reduced.</p>

  <p>She didn't look hurt, but her energy coming from tens of thousands of crystals was nearly depleted.</p>

  <p>At the very least, two-thirds had been exhausted.</p>

  <p>She had no way to escape? she could only counterattack in vain and allow the powerful warriors to shower their attacks onto her huge body.</p>
