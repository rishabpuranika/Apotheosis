  <p>
</p>

  <p>Truth be told, Norvin was not so weak. He was, after all, an ace talent of the ogre race.</p>

  <p>It was just that he had been too careless in the earlier two battles. He knew he was no match for Nathan in the first battle. But he didn't expect Nathan to kill him with just one palm strike.</p>

  <p>While in the second battle, his opponent was Lone, the not-so-famous Otherwordly Swordsman. Norvin had wanted to turn the tables around, but he was instantly killed by Lone with a single strike of his sword.</p>

  <p>Actually, if Norvin had adopted a defensive position and fled from his opponents as fast as he could in the previous two battles, he would not have been struck down by them with just one move.</p>

  <p>No doubt there was a gap between a Godly Genius and an ace talent, but not to such a huge extent.</p>

  <p>As Norvin had lost two battles, he was very cautious and he had laid down two defenses in a row.</p>

  <p>He cultivated both body and life vitality. The Magic Glowing Protection belonged to the life vitality system? he used his life vitality to activate the large drum to form the Magic Glowing Armor. He also used his forceful energy.</p>

  <p>It could be said that it was the perfect combination of forceful energy and life vitality.</p>

  <p>The outer layer of the Magic Glowing Armor was tough, and the inner layer was hard as well. An ordinary warrior would not be able to penetrate it.</p>

  <p>However, Norvin was unable to showcase its full potential.</p>

  <p>This time, all of the ace talents and Godly Geniuses had taken the best treasures of their races into the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>The giant drum that Norvin had taken with him was one such treasure. It was called the Magic Spirit Drum. It was a supreme divine weapon and ranked 405th on the Universe Spirit Tablet.</p>

  <p>The weapons in the hands of this group of warriors were indeed extremely powerful, but they were unable to use them in their full potential.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, if one wanted to use a supreme divine weapon in its fullest power, one would need to be at least a Spirit Transformation Realm warrior or a world lord.</p>

  <p>Even if the Magic Glowing Armor only operated at 10% of the Magic Spirit Drum's strength, it was not something that could be easily shattered with brute force.</p>

  <p>With the armor in his possession, Norvin believed that Luo Luo Zheng would not be able to break his defense using just his bare fists.</p>

  <p>If he was to be killed three times in a row by human warriors, it was undoubtedly a great humiliation to this ogre ace talent. He would rather commit suicide! Only by killing himself in front of the Ogre Ancestor Statue could he atone and wash away the shame he had brought to the ogres.</p>

  <p>When he felt the Mu Ning from within the Magic Glowing Armor, Luo Luo Zheng became serious. He was pondering over what would happen after his punch.</p>

  <p>The power of this punch was formidable, and it might smash open the Magic Glowing Armor. However, when faced with the armor created by a supreme divine weapon, Luo Luo Zheng needed at least twice his current strength to kill Norvin with his bare fists.</p>

  <p>It was a good thing that Norvin had taken the defensive stance. To put it bluntly, he was a sitting duck.</p>

  <p>In this sort of situation, Luo Luo Zheng had many ways to kill him.</p>

  <p>Killing him by relying on brute force alone was not an impossible feat.</p>

  <p>However, physical strength was one of Luo Zheng's trump cards.</p>

  <p>It would not be worth exposing his trump card just to kill Norvin.</p>

  <p>So Luo Luo Zheng made up his mind in that instant to kill him in another way.</p>

  <p>Before the fist could collide with Norvin, it changed form. Luo Luo Zheng opened his fist, and at the same time, a long spear shot out from his space ring.</p>

  <p>Only half of the Saint Killing Spear shot out, while the other half was still within his space ring. But he had grasped it firmly.</p>

  <p>As soon as he gripped the spear, Luo Luo Zheng infused chaotic energy into it.</p>

  <p>The Saint Killing Spear was not Luo Zheng's weapon. On the one hand, he was not familiar with using this spear, and on the other hand, he had no way to fully utilize its true power.</p>

  <p>Only Xun had the ability to completely activate the spear in the entire universe.</p>

  <p>However, the Saint Killing Spear was still a supreme divine weapon with unimaginable power.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng might not be able to fully comprehend its ingenuity, nor had he ever understood the spear intent. But using this weapon at this stage would allow him to be a tiger with wings.</p>

  <p>At the very least, he would be able to use it to kill his opponent with ease, and at the same time, keep his trump card hidden.</p>

  <p>"Shadowy Spin!" he commanded.</p>

  <p>If the distance between him and Norvin was too great, it would be difficult for Luo Luo Zheng to get him despite using the Shadowy Spin.</p>

  <p>Although Norvin was an ogre warrior, he also cultivated both body and life vitality. And that was not all; his life vitality system specialized in the Wind Law. He wasn't slow.</p>

  <p>He had thought that Luo Luo Zheng was going to punch him with his bare fist. But when he thought the fist was about to land on him, Luo Luo Zheng changed tactics and drew the Saint Killing Spear from his space ring. In the blink of an eye, he had activated the Shadowy Spin and the spear shadow shot towards Norvin.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The Saint Killing Spear wasn't the best supreme divine weapon in the universe, but in terms of destructive power, there was probably no other weapon that could surpass it.</p>

  <p>No one in the entire universe would be willing to go head to head with the Saint Killing Spear.</p>

  <p>And Norvin didn't want to do it either.</p>

  <p>So, he could only watch helplessly as Luo Luo Zheng changed his strategy.</p>

  <p>He saw Luo Luo Zheng draw half the spear from his space ring. Even so, the power that was radiating from the spear left him aghast.</p>

  <p>'He cheated me!'</p>

  <p>A thought popped in his mind.</p>

  <p>But in a fight between warriors, victory was the most important. There were no rules against playing tricks. As the saying went, "All is fair in love and war!"</p>

  <p>Besides, he had been tricked so well that he could only blame himself for being a fool and not anticipating it. He couldn't blame Luo Luo Zheng for any foul play.</p>

  <p>He had made himself an easy target without any intent to fight. Now he couldn't blame the others.</p>

  <p>The Shadowy Spin was like a gigantic crocodile, devouring everything in its path.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng wasn't adept at using the spear, it originally had its own martial skills. He only needed to use the chaotic energy to activate the spear. When the Shadowy Spin got activated by the chaotic energy instead of life vitality, it became more powerful. This was truly a surprising turn of events!</p>

  <p>The Magic Glowing Armor was abnormally tough, such that no ordinary weapons, or even ordinary Laws of Causality, would be able to penetrate it. However, this same armor was unable to block the giant spear shadow.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The spear shadow pierced through Norvin.</p>

  <p>Norvin was defeated at last.</p>

  <p>He was killed with a single move.</p>

  <p>Technically speaking, it could be considered two moves.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's punch was considered a move. Then he changed his fist into a palm and took out his spear to kill his opponent with a spear strike.</p>

  <p>However, at this moment, no one cared about whether Luo Luo Zheng used one or two moves to kill Norvin. Everyone believed that Nathan used a palm strike to kill Norvin, Lone used a sword strike and Luo Luo Zheng used a spear strike.</p>

  <p>But why Luo Luo Zheng had the spear in his possession was still a mystery to everyone.</p>

  <p>How did the Demon Night's Saint Killing Spear appear in Luo Zheng's hand?</p>

  <p>"That's the Saint Killing Spear!" remarked someone.</p>

  <p>"How did it end up in Luo Zheng's hands?" asked another.</p>

  <p>"The Saint Killing Spear is the Demon Night's most precious treasure, and the queen of the Demon Night is by his side. But she couldn't have passed it down to Luo Luo Zheng, right?"</p>

  <p>"Humph. I heard that the Queen of Killings is only a soul now. Where did she even get the Saint Killing Spear from? This spear must have obviously been preserved within the Demon Night."</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, inside the Demon Night, Yao stared coldly at the Saint Killing Spear in Luo Zheng's hand. A ruthless expression was visible on her face as her gaze landed on Malachi, who was beside her.</p>

  <p>"My...my queen..." Malachi stammered and knelt down on the floor.</p>

  <p>Yao was in the same faction as Malachi, and there was also a bloodline connection between them. Back then, she had supported Malachi's father, Gunter, to become a Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>"The Saint Killing Spear was accidentally snatched by Luo Luo Zheng in the Illusion Battlefield," Malachi explained quickly to quell his queen's fury.</p>

  <p>Yao shook her head and sighed, "It's only a projection of the spear. It's not important, but let me tell you something: you let me down!"</p>

  <p>Losing the Saint Killing Spear in the Illusion Battlefield was no big deal as the real spear was still in her possession. However, all of Malachi's Illusion Points were taken away and he failed to make it to the second stage. This was what disappointed Yao.</p>

  <p>The two groups of Demon Night warriors supporting her were almost completely annihilated in the Illusion Battlefield, while the Godly Genius groomed by the Queen of Life had a smooth journey and might rank high.</p>

  <p>However, that Godly Genius belonged to the faction that followed the Queen of Life. Yao always wanted to control the entire situation, and so she was not pleased when such a thing happened.</p>
