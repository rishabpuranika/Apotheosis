<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It was a well-known fact that a True God was immortal because of their Flawless Divine Body.</p>

  <p>One who carried a Godly Tile could have it purify their body and hone it to perfection. As a result, their life energy would never leak, even in the slightest.</p>

  <p>Such a body was called the Flawless Divine Body. It was something that only a True God could possess.</p>

  <p>That was why never in Leacock's wildest dreams did he expect to see a world lord with the Flawless Divine Body. It was simply unbelievable and even more shocking than the fact that Luo Zheng had broken the Four Images Time Barrier.</p>

  <p>Of course, he didn't know that Zheng's body was now a perfect weapon.</p>

  <p>But in reality, Luo Zheng didn't actually have the Flawless Divine Body. It was just Leacock was unable to find any flaws in Zheng's body with his current comprehension of the Truth Godly Way. After all, Luo Zheng was Holy Drew's masterpiece.</p>

  <p>While Leacock was stunned in disbelief, Raleign didn't think too much about it. He continued to hold Luo Zheng as his hands released all of his strength.</p>

  <p>"I'm gonna tear you apart!" he roared.</p>

  <p>He wanted to tear Zheng's body apart so much that an immense ghost-like power erupted from his red hands.</p>

  <p>Yet despite Raleign's recklessness, he was also wary of Zheng's incomparable power. It was why once he had captured Luo Zheng, he acted quick and didn't give Luo Zheng time to respond.</p>

  <p>He knew that Luo Zheng was undoubtedly powerful, but that didn't mean that Luo Zheng had an unbreakable body.</p>

  <p>But then, Raleign realized he was wrong.</p>

  <p>When Raleign used his Ghost Claw Strike, he could break even a divine weapon with his bare hands. Half a year ago, he had been faced with three human world lords from the Humanity Alliance and one of them had a first-rank divine weapon� the Crane-singing Cauldron.</p>

  <p>So with the help of his strength that was beyond imagination, he had used brute force to tear the Crane-singing Cauldron apart.</p>

  <p>When he tried to do the same to Luo Zheng, he found he was unable to do so� Zheng's body was so solid!</p>

  <p>"Your strength is remarkable. But it's far from enough to tear me apart,"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng commented as his face dripped with sarcasm.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the power of the Eight Path Platforms kept circulating and the Nine Divine Stars in his inner world began to turn slowly.</p>

  <p>Then, he slightly raised his arms and effortlessly broke free from Raleign's ghost claws. Apparently, he didn't give much thought about dealing with Raleign.</p>

  <p>"Kill him, Leacock!" Raleign shouted.</p>

  <p>He also released his own strength which had been maxed out to the extreme, so much that his veins popped out. He knew that he wasn't as powerful as Luo Zheng, so he could only pin his hopes on Leacock now. He knew that Leacock practiced the Truth Godly Way, and his Finger Burst's power was incredible.</p>

  <p>As long as Leacock focused on Zheng's flaws and used his Finger Burst, Luo Zheng would be dead no matter how talented he was.</p>

  <p>Both Raleign and Leacock were two grand world lords, but they had to work together to deal with a mere human world lord. It made them feel rather ashamed.</p>

  <p>But now was not the time for Raleign to think about such things, as all he wanted now was to kill Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Leacock's fingertip glowed a cyan light dot as his finger swung constantly. Once he saw a flaw in Luo Zheng, he would attack without hesitation. After quite a long while, he still hadn't made a move.</p>

  <p>This human brat didn't have a flaw at all! 'What can I do?' Leacock sulked internally.</p>

  <p>"What are you waiting for?" Raleign roared impatiently. He wondered why it took so long, and he couldn't stand Luo Zheng any longer.</p>

  <p>As for Leacock, he was left with no other choice but to make his move.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The cyan light dot from his fingertip flew toward Luo Zheng at a lightning speed and left behind a thin line in the air.</p>

  <p>Cling!</p>

  <p>The light dot hit Zheng's body with a slight noise, and then it bounced away.</p>

  <p>The light dot was like a flimsy wooden arrow that had hit an iron wall; it didn't even leave a mark behind.</p>

  <p>Leacock's Finger Burst was supposed to be used against an opponent's flaw. He didn't find any flaw in Luo Zheng, so its power wasn't enough to cause any substantial damage. To be fair, he had only used the Finger Burst at Raleign's behest.</p>

  <p>"Are you done?" Luo Zheng asked in a mocking tone.</p>

  <p>He spoke to Raleign with completely open arms and when he was done speaking, the corner of his lips raised into a slight smirk.</p>

  <p>Panic began to flood Raleign's mind. Just then, Luo Zheng swiftly turned his hands over and gripped Raleign's ghost claws tightly. "Now it's my turn!" he declared.</p>

  <p>If one wanted to have a glimpse of how powerful Luo Zheng truly was, they only needed to see how his voice never faltered even when he unleashed a massive amount of strength.</p>

  <p>Raleign felt that his arms were trapped and crushed by an irresistible force. If he could not break free, he would be torn to pieces!</p>

  <p>He was more than panicking now. At that moment, his brain was already near to short-circuiting.</p>

  <p>He suddenly reminded himself that he became a grand world lord through countless violent battles. It could be said that he had more experience in fighting than Luo Zheng. It was under that critical moment that he had found the solution to his problem by instinct.</p>

  <p>His whole body suddenly flipped, and he rotated in the direction in which Luo Zheng turned his hands. Therefore, Zheng's strength was greatly neutralized.</p>

  <p>At the same time, he maxed out his body strength to the extreme. He summoned all the determination he had and soon enough, he broke free from Zheng's hands.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>The crisp sounds of broken bones accompanied Raleign's escape.</p>

  <p>Raleign had extremely solid bones, but even he had to twist the bones in his arms to break free from Zheng's grip.</p>

  <p>The moment Raleign broke free, he retreated as fast as he could. He had to run!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng sneered and swiftly ran after him. He wanted to clasp Raleign's arms again, but Raleign didn't dare engage him in a fight at the moment. Luo Zheng tried to catch him, but Raleign fled at his fastest speed.</p>

  <p>After Raleign had run about thirty feet, the white light beneath his feet flashed and his body became a blur. He jumped into the void and disappeared.</p>

  <p>"He is so fast in running away," Luo Zheng complained with a look of surprise.</p>

  <p>Raleign had completed a series of actions in an instant, and had successfully escaped from him.</p>

  <p>Such was a world lord's fighting instinct.</p>

  <p>A world lord often used the Grand Teleportation in battles against another world lord if one strike had failed to work. So unless a world lord used a sneak attack, it was difficult to kill another world lord.</p>

  <p>Raleign had been a grand world lord for more than a hundred thousand years. The fact that he could escape from Zheng's hands was because of his rich combat experience.</p>

  <p>Zheng's gaze then drifted next to Leacock, whose face suddenly changed.</p>

  <p>Leacock quickly retreated and distanced himself from Luo Zheng, his eyes filled with constant vigilance.</p>

  <p>"The grand world lords of the Sacred race are not that strong," Luo Zheng murmured. After he briefly glanced at the grand world lord once more, he looked away and decided not to chase after him. Instead, he flew toward the blood pool and decided to destroy the Blood Curse Array.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't know that his quick glance had hurt Leacock's self-esteem.</p>

  <p>Leacock was a grand world lord and he had comprehended the Truth Godly Way. Moreover, it was due to the uniqueness of the Truth Godly Way that he was able to kill a Supreme Lord if he had enough time and space. He had never been looked down upon by a world lord like that.</p>

  <p>In the Sacred race, even Supreme Lords would show some respect to Leacock.</p>

  <p>He couldn't understand why he had become a nobody in the eyes of a mere human world lord.</p>

  <p>Although he was fuming mad, he could do nothing about it.</p>

  <p>The Truth Godly Way gave its user the power to find their opponent's flaws, and the user could defeat their opponent by attacking those flaws.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng didn't have a flaw. Thus, what could Leacock do with Luo Zheng?</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Luo Zheng slowly entered the Blood Curse Array in the middle of the blood pool, kicked and punched it around, and quickly destroyed the divine textures within it.</p>

  <p>So far, he had completely destroyed all of the four Blood Curse Arrays.</p>

  <p>After the bloody disc in the sky had lost the four arrays' support, it slowly began to incline on one side. A crack formed in the center of the huge disc; then runes began to dissipate one after another.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>The whole disc disintegrated rapidly when it fell. It broke down into a shower of blood and painted the whole Ultimate Immortal City red.</p>

  <p>The disc contained the blood of countless people, which did not get absorbed into the clouds. Now, all the red liquid had been spilled. The blood washed down like a flood, and flowed into the streets of the Ultimate Immortal City like mad.</p>

  <p>The mortals in the Ultimate Immortal City all stayed in the streets around the four blood pools. The grounds where they stood were relatively high, so they did not get submerged in the "flood."</p>

  <p>The bloody clouds in the sky still drifted about slowly, but they would gradually dissipate in a short time.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng saw the scene, he was not happy.</p>

  <p>The Sacred race had killed countless mortals in the Seven Ultimate World.</p>

  <p>One ordinary mortal might not affect the situation in the Evolutionary Universe. However, there could be few geniuses in such a huge pool of them. These geniuses were the foundation of the universe.</p>

  <p>With so many people dead, it was impossible to restore the prosperity of the city.</p>

  <p>Just then, a huge crack suddenly appeared in the sky of Ultimate Immortal City. Then, the head of a strange beast appeared from the fissure.</p>

  <p>It turned out to be the head of a World Devouring Beast. On top of its head stood a young man with purple hair. He was none other than Maha, the number one Godly Genius of the Sacred race.</p>
