</p>

  <p>"That stone slab…" Zheng raised his head to look at the stone slab in the sky. Curiosity filled his eyes.</p>

  <p>Wynn had once mentioned to Zheng that there was a stone slab in the divine land that even Holy Beings would be restrained by it. Murphy had previously attacked the Evolutionary Universe, so he was punished by the stone slab. Zheng would not doubt that the palm-sized stone slab in front of him was able to restrain a True God, but it was hard to believe that even Holy Beings would be afraid of the stone slab in front of him.</p>

  <p>A sense of doubt shone across his expression.</p>

  <p>"This is not a Ten Thousand Commandments Slate," Master Evil reminded as he noticed Zheng's doubtful look. "It's just a Ten Commandments Slate."</p>

  <p>"Ten Commandments Slate?" Zheng asked curiously, "Is there more than one of such slates?"</p>

  <p>Master Evil chuckled. He looked at Zheng rather boastfully. "How else do you think these divine cities were formed?"</p>

  <p>After the Godly Way Tablets landed on the divine land, countless stone slabs had appeared all over the divine land. Their sizes varied greatly.</p>

  <p>The small ones were known as the 'Ten Commandments Slates' while the big ones were called 'Hundred Commandments Slates'. Furthermore, the more enormous ones were the 'Thousand Commandments Slates'.</p>

  <p>The people in the divine land discovered the usage of the slates rather quickly. Rules could be set on the slates. The rules were unbreakable and must be followed by everyone in the covered area of the slate. If the rules were violated, the offender would be instantly punished by the slate.</p>

  <p>From the moment the slates appeared, not a single one had been destroyed. Even Holy Beings would not be able to damage even the weakest 'Ten commandments Slates'.</p>

  <p>All the divine cities in the divine land were built around these slates. As such, the area of a divine city was relative to the size of the slate.</p>

  <p>The Vast Sky Region was originally small, and the Mirror City was located in the north of the Vast Sky Region. It was a relatively remote divine city with only one piece of Ten Commandments Slate. However, the Heavenly Canopy Divine City in the center of the Vast Sky Region possessed a Hundred Commandments Slate.</p>

  <p>In the center of Han Clan's ancestral land, where the Six-Burden Divine City was located, there was a Thousand Commandments Slate.</p>

  <p>"I see. That's very useful information. So, the one that can suppress the Holy Beings is the 'Ten Thousand Commandments Slate'?" Zheng asked with expectant eyes.</p>

  <p>"Yes, you are smart! Hehe, the Ten Thousand Commandments Slate is also known as the Ruling Slate. Even Holy Beings would become obedient to the rules of the Ruling Slate. It's the most powerful and largest slate. And the area a Ten Thousand Commandments Slate covers is the entire divine land…" Master Evil explained with a proud look.</p>

  <p>Even though he understood Master Evil's explanation, Zheng was still confused. "Since these slates are so powerful, why isn't there anyone who uses them as weapons? If I carry a Thousand Commandments Slate on my back and lay down rules that work to my advantage, who would dare to fight me?"</p>

  <p>"Haha, you are indeed worthy of being the son of a Holy Being. You have a quick yet shrewd mind," Master Evil praised playfully. "It is said that in ancient times, such things did happen. Some True Gods used the slates as their own weapons and wrote some extremely shameless rules on them, such as 'no one is allowed to touch me.' Once someone attacked the True God, the slate would immediately attack the offender… At that time, battles between powerful True Gods truly were battles between slates."</p>

  <p>...</p>

  <p>As he imagined the scene of a battle between True Gods who each carried a stone slab, Zheng became speechless. It might be a ridiculous sight but he had to admit that it was indeed an extremely powerful method.</p>

  <p>"But later on, such a situation ended. Someone wrote a rule on the Ten Thousand Commandments Slate, which is also the Ruling Slate. It is the slate that can control the entire divine land. Everyone, including Holy Beings, is required to follow it. If I remember correctly, it should be the 104th rule that ended that weird situation. The passage states that 'No one is allowed to use the slates as a personal weapon.' After this rule appeared, the True Gods had no choice but to put down their slates…"</p>

  <p>Master Evil said plainly.</p>

  <p>"This rule is truly strange," Zheng sighed. His curiosity continued to deepen.</p>

  <p>"It's the only way to keep everything in order. To become stronger, everyone is doing their best to study the rules. Although the current divine land is very stable and the rules are strict, there is still a large group of people who are looking for loopholes in the rules and trying to find a chance to achieve higher levels," Master Evil continued his explanation.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded his head as he finally understood the situation.</p>

  <p>At that moment, three True Gods in red and black armor rushed out from the side. After the slate was activated, it also alarmed some people in Mirror City. They came here to inspect what actually happened.</p>

  <p>The three True Gods looked at the middle-aged man who was half-dead on the ground and asked Zheng about the situation. After they understood what had happened, the three True Gods left peacefully. Although the rules on the slates were strict, every year, there would always be some idiots who couldn't control themselves and violated the rules.</p>

  <p>Before they left, the True Gods were also a bit curious about Zheng's identity. After all, among proving godly warriors, there were very few who had enough divine might coins to use the teleportation channel.</p>

  <p>Zheng's incredible wealth was rather strange for them.</p>
