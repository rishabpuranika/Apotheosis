<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>There were different expressions on the faces of the low-rank True Gods as they looked on at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Some admired Luo Zheng for his performances while some looked on warily.</p>

  <p>"Is him the anonymous man?"</p>

  <p>"He has not even proven a Godly Way, and yet he ranks ninety-sixth!"</p>

  <p>"What's important is that he defeated Moore. We are well aware of Moore's strength. Moore is most likely to enter among the top ten. And this anonymous man defeated him!"</p>

  <p>"You mean to say that this anonymous man is likely to enter the top ten then? How many points will he accumulate then?"</p>

  <p>"……"</p>

  <p>The participants of this open battle were yet to make their appearances, but Luo Zheng already seemed to be the crowd's favorite.</p>

  <p>Apart from the low-rank True Gods, even the mid-rank and top-rank True Gods seemed to be interested in Luo Zheng. After all, all these clans were investigating the background of the anonymous man, and they had already heard of him before.</p>

  <p>Han Liusu also noticed him. She bypassed the crowd and tried to get closer to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>It was the first time she saw this famous anonymous man.</p>

  <p>Zheng's face was in a blurry state, and so she could not really make out his features. Moreover, his Redemption Armor had also been changed to a different hue.</p>

  <p>Han Liusu continued to stare at Luo Zheng. She felt a familiar feeling tugging at her from inside, but she could not quite place it. If it was really Luo Zheng, she would not be able to confirm in front of so many people.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng boldly smiled knowingly, as he looked at Liusu's bewildered pretty face, since no one could see his expression.</p>

  <p>Han Liusu was fully aware that everyone was staring at them as she said politely, "Nice to meet you. The anonymous man."</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?" He lowered his voice so that his voice could be deeper. It was easy to change his voice.</p>

  <p>"In the Hall of True Gods, can you accept my challenge?" Han Liusu said in a soft voice. Anyone who challenged the anonymous man was to earn his points, but Han Liusu tried to be as sincere as she could.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled even more when he saw Liusu's earnest and careful face.</p>

  <p>However, before Luo Zheng could answer, a woman wearing a black suit so tight that it seemed like her second skin, walked towards him quickly.</p>

  <p>She had black hair that was tied into a pony tail, complete with bangs in the front. Her beautiful and dignified face was brimming with infinite vitality, emitting a strong Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>As she walked, the people around stepped aside. She glanced at Han Liusu indifferently, almost with a look of disdain in her eyes. "You have already been defeated by me. Please don't embarrass yourself again."</p>

  <p>"You!" Han Liusu frowned at the lady. The so called 'defeat' happened 3 months ago. She and the woman were evenly matched in strength, so she tried to challenge her again. But the woman always refused to fight with her on the pretext of not fighting with 'losers'. Han Liusu also unfortunately never encountered her again in any of the random battles.</p>

  <p>The woman really didn't bother about Liusu's turmoil of emotions.</p>

  <p>She stared straight at Luo Zheng and said, "Are you the anonymous man who won twenty-two battles consecutively?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng glanced at her and nodded, "Yes, that would be me."</p>

  <p>"After the open battle, you will have to accept my challenge," the woman said in an commanding tone as she continued to stare at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng met far too many rude people, to really care much about her tone.</p>

  <p>He just asked indifferently, "Why should I?"</p>

  <p>On the other side, Han Liusu looked coldly at the woman. She totally despised her overbearing nature.</p>

  <p>"If you win, I'll give you a high-quality supreme primordial weapon," the woman said, confident that Luo Zheng would not be able to refuse her.</p>

  <p>Her words also caused an uproar among the low-rank True Gods around her.</p>

  <p>There were a great number of supreme primordial weapons in the divine land, but most of them were of inferior quality. And the supreme primordial weapons that could be called 'high-quality', were very few. To top it, they were kept only by the wealthy clans on the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>It was generous and little unusual for the woman to bet on a high-quality supreme primordial weapon.</p>

  <p>"The real strength of that anonymous man has not been tested yet. After all, nobody can deny that Moore lost to him. Ling Shuang must be really confident to place such a bet."</p>

  <p>"It's very normal for her to have that kind of confidence. After all she ranks first among the low-rank True Gods."</p>

  <p>"Ling Shuang Mu is always so strong."</p>

  <p>Han Liusu sighed in her heart. She did not have the same courage nor the confidence as Ling Shuang Mu. She could not help but step back two steps.</p>

  <p>Although she was extremely talented, she lacked in personality. It seemed that there was no chance now for her to challenge the anonymous man. She could only secretly hope that she would encounter him later in the random battles.</p>

  <p>'Ling Shuang Mu of the Mu Clan.'</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes narrowed as he tried to place her identity.</p>

  <p>Currently, Luo Zheng had shifted all his hatred towards Murphy Mu. However, he had gotten the news from Wynn, Holy Jay and Han Liusu that the murder of his father couldn't be just Murphy's doing alone.</p>

  <p>At this stage, Luo Zheng was still unclear about the disputes in the past. But, he was very clear about his intentions towards Murphy. After all, it was him who had initiated a war in the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>"A piece of high-quality supreme primordial weapon? I'm afraid that is not enough!" Luo Zheng said with a smirk.</p>

  <p>Nelly's eyes suddenly became cold as she said, "Not enough?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shook his head and chuckled. "If I keep winning the battles continuously with the low-rank True Gods, the points that I accumulate will be equivalent to a consummate True God's. I can change the rankings of some Floating Islands at that time. Think about it. Isn't it too good a deal for a clan to use only one high-quality supreme primordial weapon to raise its ranking?"</p>

  <p>When they heard that Ling Shuang offered a high-quality supreme primordial weapon to challenge Luo Zheng before, all the low-rank True Gods present thought that it was a good deal for Luo Zheng. But now, Luo Zheng totally changed their perception and realized it would be a good deal for Ling Shuang.</p>

  <p>It would be very worthwhile to spend a piece of high-quality supreme primordial weapon, in order to improve the ranking of the Floating Island.</p>

  <p>"You..." Hearing this, Ling Shuang was not that easily persuaded. She was slightly stunned and then sneered, "Are you so confident that you will win all the time? If you continue to choose your opponents randomly and meet me somehow, I can still defeat you and end your winning streak?"</p>

  <p>If at all he lost, Luo Zheng would lose ninety percent of the points he got from the extra rewards.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure you can beat me?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Hearing Zheng's words, Nelly's vigorous eyes flashed as she said, "I have seen many men as rampant as you. I'd like to see the look of despair in you when you are trampled by me! Since you said that was not enough, then what more do you want? Just name it."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng thought for a while and said, "Three second-rank supreme primordial weapons."</p>

  <p>"My, aren't you greedy?!" Ling Shuang sneered coldly, but she still nodded and said, "I accept."</p>

  <p>"I will decide the time to challenge you, but I promise the time will be before the re-ranking of the Floating Islands," Luo Zheng added.</p>

  <p>"Okay," said Ling Shuang as she raised her head.</p>

  <p>"If I win, you can give her the three second-rank supreme primordial weapons," Luo Zheng said, pointing towards Han Liusu in the corner.</p>

  <p>"What?!"</p>

  <p>A green light flashed in Nelly's eyes, that contained infinite life energy.</p>

  <p>She stared at Han Liusu with a very spiteful expression.</p>

  <p>Han Liusu was shocked too, hearing Zheng's condition. She never thought that the anonymous man would suddenly mention her. 'What is going on?' she thought.</p>

  <p>"Why the hell should I give them to her? She is a total nobody! Are you from the Han Clan?" Ling Shuang asked looking at Luo Zheng furiously.</p>

  <p>Currently, she was the most eye-catching low-rank True God among the younger generation. In fact Ling Shuang and Han Liusu were the two most talented girls in the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>The two girls had their own advantages. Ling Shuang was straightforward and lively, while Han Liusu had a gentle and sober personality. It was inevitable that people would compare the two girls to each other.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Ling Shuang was extremely proud and arrogant, and she did not even consider Han Liusu as her equal. She did not like it at all when others compared her with Han Liusu.</p>

  <p>"You can keep guessing whether I'm a disciple of the Han Clan or not,"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng said indifferently. "This is the condition. It is up to you whether you want to accept the deal or not."</p>

  <p>Last time, Luo Zheng had bet on 550 divine might coins with Moore.</p>

  <p>As a result, after Luo Zheng had defeated Moore, that slimy fellow had disappeared. With Zheng's current identity as the anonymous man, it was impossible for him to go to the Moon Clan's Floating Island.</p>

  <p>Even if he defeated Ling Shuang, his identity still couldn't be revealed, so it would be better to hand over the stake to Han Liusu.</p>

  <p>As for whether or not he was a disciple of the Han Clan, they could keep guessing for eternity.</p>

  <p>Ling Shuang coldly glanced at Han Liusu. What Luo Zheng asked of her was undoubtedly a great humiliation, but in order to challenge Luo Zheng, she gritted her teeth and agreed.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad to hear that," Luo Zheng replied with a nod. He then walked over to Han Liusu and asked with a smile, "Did you just say that you wanted to challenge me?"</p>

  <p>Han Liusu didn't know what had happened. She was still in a daze, but since the anonymous man asked her, she nodded and replied, "Yes."</p>

  <p>"After I defeat that woman, I will accept your challenge," Luo Zheng continued with a smile.</p>

  <p>"What?" For some reason, Han Liusu was a little nervous in front of the anonymous man. "But I can't afford three supreme primordial weapons."</p>

  <p>Han Liusu actually could afford it, but she was unwilling to do so.</p>

  <p>"Oh! Don't worry about it. I will not ask for anything if you lose." Luo Zheng laughed strangely.</p>

  <p>In meantime, Ling Shuang was fuming with rage.</p>
