<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The members of the Tail Insect race had received an order from the Ghost Scorpion asking them to kill everyone belonging to the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>It never occurred to them that no Soul of Light from the Oneness Sky Palace remained on the Other Shore. Moreover, a powerful human being was now standing before them. How could they not be afraid?</p>

  <p>The remaining members of the Tail Insect race panicked and began to chuck the green grass balls at Zheng.</p>

  <p>Before the balls could explode, another figure appeared behind them. It was none other than Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>A long sword appeared in Feng Ge's hand.</p>

  <p>She did not want to touch these dirty bugs.</p>

  <p>When she had found a long sword in the stronghold of the Oneness Sky Palace, she had known that it would come in handy, even though it was ordinary.</p>

  <p>She slashed the sword at the creatures, drawing a long, uneven line that turned green almost instantly. Every member of the Tail Insect race, except the last one, dropped dead.</p>

  <p>Zheng walked out of the billowing green smoke. Feng Ge glanced at him and said, "You're tainted with this smoke. What if you can't get out of the Other Shore?"</p>

  <p>"I don't intend to leave," Zheng said with a smile.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge pursed her lips. The Ghost Scorpion hadn't shown up yet, and they didn't know how powerful the Ghost Scorpion was. But Zheng looked pretty confident.</p>

  <p>"You, you...," the last survivor uttered, his voice trembling.</p>

  <p>"Tell the Ghost Scorpion to come and meet us in person," Zheng said, his voice sending chills through the survivor's spine.</p>

  <p>Relieved, the Tail Insect quickly made his escape.</p>

  <p>News traveled fast among the races in the Myriad Spirits City.</p>

  <p>The news that a number of Tail Insects had died in close proximity to the Oneness Sky Palace's stronghold spread like wildfire. The Tail Insect race followed the Ghost Scorpion, which meant that the Oneness Sky Palace would surely have pissed off the Ghost Scorpion this time.</p>

  <p>"The Oneness Sky Palace? Human beings can only enter the Other Shore with their souls, right?"</p>

  <p>"These souls have always been weak and easy to bully. They are courteous when they meet the members of our race. How dare they provoke the Ghost Scorpion?"</p>

  <p>"They are in serious trouble!"</p>

  <p>The ones who were curious moved towards the Oneness Sky Palace's stronghold. Some hid behind the wall and some went into the living area to secretly take a peek at the goings-on.</p>

  <p>They were shocked to see the corpses of the Tail Insects scattered on the ground.</p>

  <p>A man sat at the door of the wooden building, his back erect and posture majestic, while a woman stood beside him, with a sword in her hand. They had no intention of escaping or of letting anyone escape.</p>

  <p>"It's going to be a good show!"</p>

  <p>"It looks like they are not afraid of the Ghost Scorpion."</p>

  <p>"That's because they don't know how strong the Ghost Scorpion is! They will die miserable deaths!"</p>

  <p>In the City Guard House of the Myriad Spirits City</p>

  <p>Two giants entered the City Guard House to report on the news of the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>A bear-like creature sat on the host's seat of the hall of the City Guard House. At the news, he only said, "I see."</p>

  <p>"Sir, should we stop the Ghost Scorpion?" one of the giants asked.</p>

  <p>"No need," the black bear replied, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>The Oneness Sky Palace usually sent in a considerable amount of soul pills every year in hope of the City Guard House's protection in exchange.</p>

  <p>Ordinarily, the City Guard House would solve it in person. But this time, it had, alongside the Ghost Scorpion, been entrusted with the mission to take action against it.</p>

  <p>What was more, even if the Ghost Scorpion didn't make a move, the City Guard House definitely would.</p>

  <p>An hour later, three red giant scorpions and over a hundred Tail Insects crawled out of the underground cave at the north of the city.</p>

  <p>Zheng and Feng Ge had already killed two groups from the Tail Insect race, but they still weren't successful in attracting the Ghost Scorpion's attention. It looked like the Ghost Scorpion had no intention of fighting them personally.</p>

  <p>The three giant scorpions weren't intelligent but were ferocious creatures.</p>

  <p>They were forbidden from entering the Myriad Spirits City. But some of the rules were only for those at the bottom of the society. And the Ghost Scorpion didn't have to comply with the rules.</p>

  <p>The three scorpions, carried by the Tail Insects, moved along the street and caused complete chaos, shrieks to fill the air.</p>

  <p>This excited the creatures of the Other Shore, who were observing them secretly.</p>

  <p>"The Ghost Scorpion has sent the Red Scorpion Squad!"</p>

  <p>"They can kill the man and the woman ten times over!"</p>

  <p>"They are not strong enough but they still want to fight the Ghost Scorpion.</p>

  <p>How arrogant do they have to be!"</p>

  <p>When the three red scorpions were carried into the path, another cloud of green smoke rose.</p>

  <p>It was a few minutes before the green smoke dissipated gradually.</p>

  <p>The many creatures hiding in the darkness were shocked as they watched this scene.</p>

  <p>The three red scorpions lay on the ground, their tails cut off. The corpses of the Tail Insects were piled up like a hill.</p>

  <p>This time again, Zheng left alive one member of the Tail Insect race and asked him to go back and inform the others.</p>

  <p>"They have destroyed the Red Scorpion Squad so easily!"</p>

  <p>"Are these two human beings that formidable?"</p>

  <p>"Something is wrong!"</p>

  <p>The Red Scorpion Squad was the backbone of the Ghost Scorpion, and each red scorpion had extraordinary levels of strength.</p>

  <p>These giant red scorpions were at the very least stronger and more powerful than many creatures at Stage Fourteen except for the creatures of the Dark Region. But they being killed so suddenly and in one fell swoop shocked those creatures of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>An hour later, many huge butterflies emerged from the underground cave at the north of the city, their fragrance spreading in all directions. The burly figure of the Ghost Scorpion soon followed.</p>

  <p>If the first group of the Tail Insects had been only to test them, the Red Scorpion Squad he had later sent should be enough to kill the two human beings.</p>

  <p>But the situation hadn't gone as the Ghost Scorpion had expected. Even the members of the Red Scorpion Squad had been destroyed. Only one Tail Insect had survived and returned to tell the story.</p>

  <p>"Sir, is it necessary for you to kill the two human beings?" a woman from the Fragrant Butterfly race asked.</p>

  <p>The Ghost Scorpion squinted and responded, "I will take personal action against them."</p>

  <p>The Ghost Scorpion rarely left his underground cave.</p>

  <p>He had lurked in the Myriad Spirits City for many years, and didn't get on well with the City Guard House. But the City Guard House couldn't do anything about him. Catching the Ghost Scorpion was a distant daydream for the City Guard House.</p>

  <p>"But will the City Guard House..." another woman from the Fragrant Butterfly race said worriedly.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry. The City Guard House won't create any disturbance," the Ghost Scorpion sneered.</p>

  <p>The Ghost Scorpion then led the women of the Fragrant Butterfly race onto the path. Soon, they spotted Zheng and Feng Ge in the distance.</p>

  <p>His six pairs of eyes glowed with a bright red light. And as he noticed the corpses of the three giant red scorpions, he filled with rage. How dare these insignificant human beings kill the members of the Red Scorpion Squad!</p>

  <p>Zheng still sat there in silence, a calm expression on his face.</p>

  <p>The moment he saw the Ghost Scorpion's sturdy black body, and his thin, long tail, he spoke, "You are finally here."</p>

  <p>"All of this will be over if we kill the Ghost Scorpion, won't it?" Feng Ge asked.</p>

  <p>"It's hard to say," Zheng said, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>After Zheng and Feng Ge had entered the Myriad Spirits City, these creatures had caused trouble for the Oneness Sky Palace, which was not coincidental.</p>

  <p>There must be a reason for it.</p>
