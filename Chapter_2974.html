  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Wild Goose Pass was one of the exits from the Source World to the chaos.</p>

  <p>Despite not being the most important exit, as the Wild Goose Pass did not belong to any force, it was favored by neutral commercial alliances.</p>

  <p>The Source World consisted of many powerful forces. Commercial alliances had to bribe these forces to deliver goods past the borders.</p>

  <p>Some powerful commercial alliances thought it would be better to transport their goods outside the Source World and return to the Source World through every pass, which was also a shortcut.</p>

  <p>The Sweltering Desert was adjacent to the Wild Goose Pass. Those who were familiar with the trade routes would naturally not lose their way in this desert. However, there were always some exceptions, such as Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Yes." Zheng nodded in admission of his predicament.</p>

  <p>But the woman wouldn't know that Zheng was not from the Source World at all.</p>

  <p>"This sandstorm has enshrouded the whole desert. I have been looking for an exit for a long time, but still can't find it. How can I leave the Sweltering Desert?" Zheng asked, seizing the chance to clear his own doubts.</p>

  <p>However, the woman did not directly answer Zheng. With a faint smile, she slowly said, "Sir, if you want to leave the Sweltering Desert, then where are you going?"</p>

  <p>Zheng reckoned that she wouldn't have any connections with the Yellow Emperor Guards, so he replied honestly, "Excellence City."</p>

  <p>The woman showed no surprise on her face. "Excellence City is a large city in the north of the Sweltering Desert. I have been there before."</p>

  <p>The woman appeared to be evading his question, and this made Zheng a little impatient. He asked directly, "In that case, could you tell me how to leave this desert?"</p>

  <p>The woman replied with a smile, "There is a way to leave this desert, but you have to wait until the sandstorm in the Sweltering Desert subsides.</p>

  <p>Then you can walk north all the way out of the desert."</p>

  <p>Zheng also knew that he could not get out of the desert mostly because of this sandstorm. He then asked, "How long will this sandstorm last?"</p>

  <p>"Once the sandstorm in the Sweltering Desert starts to blow, it will last for about one year and a half."</p>

  <p>Zheng frowned slightly at the woman's response. He needed to go to the Excellence City and meet up with Emily and the others. One year and a half was too long.</p>

  <p>"Is there no other way?" Zheng asked, frustration coloring his voice.</p>

  <p>The woman replied calmly, "The sandstorm is an illusion created by the Mist Summoning Spirit, who breathed out the air. Normal people cannot exit the sandstorm once they enter it, but people from the Sand Country like us have a way."</p>

  <p>"Mist Summoning Spirit?" Zheng raised his eyebrows slightly.</p>

  <p>The woman smiled, "It will appear as a powerful beast in your eyes, but it is the god whom we worship. It has been protecting our Sand Country for a countless number of years."</p>

  <p>Zheng finally had a rough idea of the desert.</p>

  <p>The Sweltering Desert was a barren land in the eyes of the warriors at the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>In truth, this desert was not so barren; there were oases there, as well. There was the Sand Country, a densely populated country considered as the home of dozens of tribes.</p>

  <p>The Mist Summoning Spirit was a fierce beast that inhabited the Sweltering Desert. This beast was particularly skilled at making illusions.</p>

  <p>Being able to trap Zheng in this sandstorm was enough to prove that the Mist Summoning Spirit mentioned by the woman was an extremely powerful being. Even an Other Shore Realm warrior would not be able to kill it.</p>

  <p>Logically, most business caravans and flying ships would take a detour after passing through the Wild Goose Pass to avoid the Sweltering Desert.</p>

  <p>In his panic, Zheng had inadvertently selected a path into this desert and could not find his way out.</p>

  <p>Due to the existence of the Mist Summoning Spirit, the citizens of the Sand Country could live a peaceful life in the desert. Naturally, these people worshiped this fierce beast as a god.</p>

  <p>"Since you have mentioned that you know of an exit, please show me the way," Zheng entreated. "If there is anything I can do, please let me know."</p>

  <p>He also understood the meaning of this woman's words.</p>

  <p>Apparently, she was chased by someone who intended to kill her, and ended up hiding deep within the desert.</p>

  <p>She asked for his help in a roundabout way.</p>

  <p>Since she had answered his questions, Zheng saw no problem in helping the woman out.</p>

  <p>The woman's eyes lit up at Zheng's words.</p>

  <p>She had been to the Excellence City before, so she had seen much of the world. She could not gauge this outsider's strength, but she could tell that he was a strong warrior. It would be beneficial to her to ask him for assistance.</p>

  <p>However, she was afraid that Zheng would refuse her, so she didn't speak of it directly. Now that he had taken the initiative to offer help, she was relieved.</p>

  <p>It was not her intention to deceive; she was only afraid to miss the opportunity that fell from the heavens.</p>

  <p>"Let me be honest with you. My name is Maggie, and I am a princess of the Sand Country. A few months ago, due to a rebellion in my country, my brothers were all slaughtered by the new king. Thanks to the protection of the Mist Summoning Spirit, I was able to escape to the desert. I would be extremely grateful if you could help me take back the throne!" Her tone suddenly fell.</p>

  <p>Maggie was well aware that doing Zheng a favor by bringing him out of the desert was not sufficient to make a warrior of his caliber take a risk and fight for her. This time, a look of pleading appeared on her beautiful face.</p>

  <p>The battle for the throne was brutal. She had to leave the Sand Country to save her life. However, the appearance of Zheng gave her a glimmer of hope.</p>

  <p>Zheng thought it over. This was not a difficult undertaking for him.</p>

  <p>Judging from the strength of her bodyguards, he speculated that the warriors of the Sand Country were at the Soul Sea Realm or the Spirit Transformation Realm. It wouldn't take a lot for him to help her clear her troubles, so he nodded and agreed.</p>

  <p>"In that case, please come with me now!"</p>

  <p>She then summoned her guards to remove the tents.</p>

  <p>After some preparation, she took out a crooked green flute. As she placed it near her mouth and gently blew, a melodious sound burst forth from the instrument.</p>

  <p>Wooo...</p>

  <p>Just as the flute started to whistle, a strange happening occurred.</p>

  <p>The yellow sand rolling around the desert seemed to have heard the music and shifted to both sides to make way for them.</p>

  <p>"What is this?" he wondered aloud in awe.</p>

  <p>Just as the sand moved away, Zheng felt a strong aura of Space Law.</p>

  <p>It seemed that the illusion of sandstorm was created using the Space Law, or even the Truth of Void Destruction. Zheng had no idea how such a fierce beast hiding in the desert would be able to command such a strange illusion.</p>

  <p>"This flute was given to me by the Mist Summoning Spirit," Maggie confided to Zheng in a whisper. "By using it, I was able to escape from the Sand Country."</p>

  <p>Zheng glanced at the flute and asked, "Are you the only one in possession of this flute in the entire Sand Country?"</p>

  <p>If she used this flute to hide in the desert, then it was not surprising that she could escape from those pursuing her.</p>

  <p>Maggie sadly shook her head. "There are a total of three flutes in the Sand Country. That is why I am afraid that the new king's people would be able to catch up to us and..." Her voice trailed off, her meaning clear.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded. Since he had found the way to leave the desert, he was no longer so anxious.</p>

  <p>Maggie played the flute and led the way. No sand came close to them after it had parted to make way for their group.</p>
