<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Tracy stood elegantly at the center of the competition field. The shadow of the Blue Phoenix behind her looked indistinct and blurry, yet it radiated an overwhelming Mu Ning. Tracy looked like a sacred goddess that everyone couldn't look at her graceful figure directly.</p>

  <p>The audience was left in awe by the dramatic change in the competition field.</p>

  <p>It was a mind-blowing fact that one of the disciples of Cloud Sect among them could have the power of a legendary beast.</p>

  <p>To everyone's mind, it would be nearly impossible for Luo Zheng to beat Tracy now that she had used the power of the Blue Phoenix. They were expecting that Luo Zheng would do the best thing� to admit defeat.</p>

  <p>But to their surprise, Luo Zheng took out his sword instead.</p>

  <p>"A sword? Does Luo Zheng have a sword? But he is a body refiner, so how could he use a sword? I don't know what to believe now!"</p>

  <p>"I agree. I don't know when Luo Zheng has become a sword practitioner. Other than that, it looks to me that he is carrying a fairy weapon!"</p>

  <p>"What the heck? Does this mean that Luo Zheng has never shown his real strength in his previous matches? So, neither his flying knife nor his soul attack was his real ace! I can't wait to see what his real trump card is!"</p>

  <p>The audience had not yet recovered from the shocking fact that Tracy had the power of the Blue Phoenix, and now they were yet again treated to another revelation.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, who was only in grade-two nature level, had astonished the audience by consecutively defeating rivals of nature-level consummation, Illuminating Soul Realm, and those personal disciples.</p>

  <p>And yet he still had some new tricks to show. Luo Zheng had instantly become an unfathomable figure in everyone's eyes.</p>

  <p>His mysterious image was a result of his endless powerful means of fighting. After he employed many different skills to beat his rivals, the audience became unclear about the limit of his real power or whether it had a limit or not.</p>

  <p>When the audience saw Tracy's Blue Phoenix, they thought that Luo Zheng would be defeated this time. However, when Luo Zheng pulled out his sword, the result of the fight became uncertain again.</p>

  <p>'They are really amazing!' many disciples thought to themselves. Most of them would never be able to reach the same level as the ones in the competition field right now.</p>

  <p>Among the audience, Tianming quietly watched the match on the stage. His sharp gaze fixed on Luo Zheng who was holding a sword in his hand, and his eyes were filled with eagerness to fight.</p>

  <p>Tianming and Luo Zheng had something in common.</p>

  <p>They were both a dark horse in this All Peaks Competition. Both were skip-level challengers, although Luo Zheng did it better by defeating an Illuminating-Soul-Realm practitioner; while Tianming performed just as expected with his level at nature-level consummation.</p>

  <p>But it didn't necessarily mean that Luo Zheng was far more powerful than Tianming. The latter was a sword practitioner, but he hadn't used his sword in front of any of his rivals yet, which made him as unfathomable as Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Tianming was interested in Luo Zheng after he saw the latter's Sword Step. He was eager to fight Luo Zheng, but it was a pity that they hadn't encountered each other in the round-robin match.</p>

  <p>The moment Luo Zheng took out his sword, he understood it wasn't luck that brought the Sword Step into Zheng's hands. Luo Zheng was also a sword practitioner, and he must have understood the sword intent as well!</p>

  <p>It was almost impossible for a sword practitioner to master the Sword Step overnight despite the deep of the sword intent. Tianming was quite certain about that because he had spent three months learning the Sword Step. But as for Luo Zheng, he had managed to grasp the Sword Step just after he saw Tianming use it in the competition.</p>

  <p>Tianming was proud of his own talent, but he had to admit that Luo Zheng was an exceptional one.</p>

  <p>'I believe that we'll eventually meet in this All Peaks Competition. I'm looking forward to it,  Luo Zheng Luo!' Tianming thought to himself as he took a deep breath.</p>

  <p>Standing on the high platform and watching the fight below, Kenneth smiled and said, "Tracy is indeed a willful girl! The power of the Blue Phoenix will consume most of her energy, but she still chose to use it in this competition. She's overdoing it, but it's somewhat a good thing! She manages to force Luo Zheng to show another skill. I didn't expect that he is able to use a sword. Go ahead, boy! Show me how proficient you are with your sword intent!"</p>

  <p>Elder Xu stood there dumbfounded as he watched the unexpected development in the competition field. He eventually said, "Well, it's the age of the young generation now. It's gratifying to see that there are so many talented young disciples in our sect."</p>

  <p>"You're right, Xu. Who do you think will win this fight?" Kenneth turned to Xu and asked.</p>

  <p>With knitted eyebrows, Xu thought for a while before replying, "Now that Luo Zheng decided to use his sword, it must be one of his ultimate skills.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, he wouldn't have given up his original fighting style.</p>

  <p>However, even though Luo Zheng has understood the sword intent, it will still be hard for him to beat Tracy after she stimulated the power of the Blue Phoenix. I think it's still going to be Tracy."</p>

  <p>"Really?" Kenneth looked down at the competition field again and said,</p>

  <p>"It's very likely that things will go like this. Although Tracy can only use a small part of the Blue Phoenix power, it's still enough to make her almost invincible among the Illuminating Soul Realm. However, for some reasons, I believe that Luo Zheng will again perform another of his miracles in this match!"</p>

  <p>"A miracle is no longer a miracle if it happens too frequently," rebutted Elder Xu, "Luo Zheng has defeated too many stronger rivals in this competition and I don't think it's going to happen again."</p>

  <p>Kenneth was convinced with his words and didn't proceed with the discussion. He finally said, "Well, let's just wait and see what the result will be."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had the silver Streamer Sword athwart his chest, but he suddenly pointed the sword towards the ground and said, "I need to ask you one question before we continue with the fight. Why do you hate me so much?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't like to be hated by others for no reason, especially by such a beautiful girl who had powerful strength. He felt aggrieved because he didn't think he deserved Tracy's wrath. He couldn't understand why Tracy showed this much hostility towards him.</p>

  <p>"To be honest, there is no reason at all. I just can't help but feel disgusted when I see your calm face, and I really want to give you a good beating!"</p>

  <p>Tracy said in a cold voice.</p>

  <p>Surprised with what he heard, Luo Zheng teased, "Well, you can try!"</p>

  <p>After that, he slashed his sword at the ground, and mighty sword intent started to flood in his body.</p>

  <p>With a good grasp of the sword intent, a sword practitioner could defeat any opponent. The best example was Tianming who had used his Sword Step and some other skills to beat many rivals. Wing was merely a green hand in the blade intent, but that was enough to help him stand out among the disciples from the thirty-three peaks.</p>

  <p>The intent of the weapons was something indistinct and insubstantial, but it was undoubtedly powerful.</p>

  <p>Tracy also started her attacks after Luo Zheng finished his words.</p>

  <p>The Blue Phoenix was a supernatural bird that was said to be a branch of the super legendary beast Phoenix. Although it possessed the same great speed of the Phoenix, the Blue Phoenix didn't inherit the divine fire of its legendary ancestor. On the other hand, it had developed the ability to control the wind.</p>

  <p>When Tracy moved around in the competition field, all the air was stirred up with her motion.</p>

  <p>This was totally different from the way Cecil controlled the winds. Cecil could control the winds by spreading his life vitality in the air and vibrating it to stir up winds. In Tracy's case, she could directly control the winds as it was an instinct of the Blue Phoenix.</p>

  <p>In other words, Tracy became the master of the winds through the power of the Blue Phoenix.</p>

  <p>Her slim body seemed to drift freely in the air. Her figure disappeared in Zheng's eyes as she moved with extreme speed.</p>

  <p>"Zoom..."</p>

  <p>She approached Luo Zheng quietly like a light breeze.</p>

  <p>The breeze blew lightly against Zheng's face like the one in an early spring day, but he could feel a strong homicidal intent in it.</p>

  <p>Tracy appeared next to Luo Zheng out of the blue and suddenly stabbed Luo Zheng with her two Emei pricks.</p>

  <p>"Sword intent, shield my body!"</p>

  <p>In the danger of Tracy's sudden attack, Luo Zheng surrounded himself with sword intent to protect himself.</p>

  <p>"Ding ding ding..."</p>

  <p>The collision of Zheng's sword intent with Tracy's weapons created a pleasing sound.</p>

  <p>Zheng's sword intent was strong, but it couldn't force Tracy to step back.</p>

  <p>As a blue light flashed in Tracy's eyes, she suddenly strengthened and her Emei pricks cut through Zheng's sword intent and stabbed directly at him.</p>

  <p>"Poof!"</p>

  <p>When he realized that the sword intent wasn't strong enough to stop Tracy, Luo Zheng quickly used the power of the Phoenix Crystal in his arm to increase his speed. He tried to avoid Tracy's attack but to no avail. The Emei pricks stabbed his shoulders and they started to bleed.</p>

  <p>"Damn it! She's powerful!" Luo Zheng wiped off the blood from his wounds and coldly stared at Tracy.</p>

  <p>"I planned to leave only two injuries in your body, but now I changed my mind. I'll make you bleed to my heart's content!" Tracy announced in cold tone. Her voice and character changed after she had used the power of the Blue Phoenix, but her willfulness remained the same.</p>

  <p>"Oh really?" Luo Zheng said sarcastically.</p>

  <p>"I'll stab you one more time for every smile you dare to show in front of me! That's eleven stabs now!" Tracy warned with the same cold tone.</p>

  <p>"It's not fair to increase the price!" Luo Zheng said, acting as if complaining. He wasn't threatened by Tracy's warning. He just did that to tease Tracy and see her full potential.</p>

  <p>"Twelve now!" Tracy spat angrily, gritting her teeth.</p>

  <p>"You can just stab as much as you want! But only if you have the power to do it!" Luo Zheng lifted the sword in his hand and assumed an attacking posture. Earlier, he was just testing if his sword intent would pose a threat to Tracy or not. But this time, he meant serious business.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng wielded his sword in that manner, the audience, including Kenneth, was stunned into silence.</p>

  <p>"That's basic swordsmanship!" everyone broke the silence.</p>

  <p>To their surprise, Luo Zheng was performing the first movement of the basic swordsmanship.</p>
