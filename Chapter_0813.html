  <p>
</p>

  <p>On this chaotic continent, the Demon Night didn't have many members. In fact, they had the fewest lot among all the races.</p>

  <p>The Demon Night was an incomparably powerful race in any boundless universe. From the very moment they were born, they possessed the strength of nature creatures. They would be a powerful race even in the Upper World.</p>

  <p>Despite their weak numbers, God had been fair to them. The members of the Demon Night were unmatched. Whether it was strength, talent, or even appearance, they were all close to perfection.</p>

  <p>However, they had one fatal flaw, and that was their inability to reproduce.</p>

  <p>Increasing the numbers in their race had proven to be difficult. Otherwise, the Demon Night would have already ruled over this disorderly continent.</p>

  <p>The Demon Night was a proud race, but they weren't particularly bloodthirsty. When Luo Luo Zheng brought over a group of humans into their territory, they only issued him a warning and had him evacuate their area.</p>

  <p>It was precisely because of their pride that the Demon Night rarely cooperated with other races. It was also why the three members of the Demon Night were so shocked at the sight of Luo Zheng's sword spirit.</p>

  <p>"Let me see it more clearly," said the young lady of the Demon Night holding the bone bow. Her eyes flashed with a pale blue light as her pupils turned the color of the sky. When her gaze fell on Luo Zheng's sword spirit, her expression changed.</p>

  <p>"Queen!"</p>

  <p>The word fell from her lips and she immediately jumped down from the treetop. Her nimble figure nestled on a branch. She then knelt down, one knee facing her front.</p>

  <p>"Queen?" the other two members of the race spat out, unbidden doubt in their voices when they heard what the young girl said. Their gazes turned to focus on Lily, the sword spirit next to Luo Luo Zheng, and the expressions on their faces changed. They knelt on the ground like the girl. Respect shone through their eyes.</p>

  <p>After the salutations, the three members slowly stood up. "Phoebe," one of them called out. "Why would our queen appear by the side of a human?"</p>

  <p>Phoebe shook her head hesitantly. "I'm not sure. Queen has never said anything about this. This human seems to have many secrets. We shouldn't have stopped him just now."</p>

  <p>"He is no match for the ogre war lord. Save him. I'll inform Elder Mei," someone else said.</p>

  <p>Phoebe nodded, then flew forward as if stepping on a gust of wind. Like an agile leopard, she continued to step onto the branches of the trees in the dense forest. Her willowy body leaped, the bone bow in her hand already changing directions as she loaded a bone arrow.</p>

  <p>Facing the ogre war lord, Luo Luo Zheng backed away while allowing Lily, the sword spirit, to fight for him.</p>

  <p>Lily wielded the Blood Fiend Emperor's giant sword and it slashed in the air, producing a big black shadow as it was thrust in the direction of the ogre war lord's head.</p>

  <p>"Demon Night? Ha-ha!" The ogre war lord snickered. With a sudden clap of his crimson red hands, he caught the black sword forcefully between his hands. With a twist of his body, he tried to throw Lily away.</p>

  <p>However, Lily's sword dance was incredibly strange. As she was sent flying, she made a backhanded motion and her flexible body created an imaginary arc in the air. Taking advantage of her elasticity, she bounced up, getting hold of the sword again as she lunged toward the ogre war lord from another direction.</p>

  <p>Clang!</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, no matter how perfect Lily's sword dance was, it was ultimately unable to withstand the pressure of absolute strength. The ogre war lord was too strong, and when Lily's second sword strike approached, the ogre war lord's figure flashed as he once again punched the sword.</p>

  <p>Lily's originally sharp sword force started to fluctuate under the influence of the unreasonable strength.</p>

  <p>Lily was unable to block the attacks from the ogre war lord again.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng witnessed this, he frowned, about to call Lily back. As his sword spirit, she could be injured. If she was damaged, it would take her a long time to recuperate. It was the last thing he wanted.</p>

  <p>Never in his wildest dreams did he imagine what would happen next. At once, a sharp bone arrow flew toward the ogre war lord, making a whistling noise.</p>

  <p>The body of the bone arrow was covered in mysterious runes and at the end of it emitted a beam of milky white light.</p>

  <p>The power of this arrow far surpassed the one that had been shot at Luo Luo Zheng before.</p>

  <p>The previous one had only been to warn Luo Luo Zheng, while this one had clearly been used to attack the ogre war lord.</p>

  <p>Seeing the bone arrow zooming toward him, the ogre war lord sneered. He casually stretched his hand and plucked it out of air. With a crack, he crushed the arrow into pieces. "Ha-ha!" the ogre war lord jibed. "Demon Night, when did you become allies with the weak humans?"</p>

  <p>'Demon Night? So it seems they are around on this chaotic continent.' Luo Zheng's eyebrows jumped up.</p>

  <p>Back on the Killing Sword Mountain, Luo Luo Zheng had encountered the strange sword and obtained Lily, the sword spirit. He had also found out from the cyan dragon that the Demon Night was an extremely powerful race. Little did he then know that the Demon Night also existed on the chaotic continent.</p>

  <p>As the ogre war lord stopped talking, two figures slowly revealed themselves from behind the trees. They were the members of the Demon Night. A young lady was in the front, the one named Phoebe.</p>

  <p>Slowly, she strode out of the forest. Her elegant steps seemed to conceal a special kind of rhythm. In an incomparably light voice, she said, "This human is special. He is under the protection of Demon Night."</p>

  <p>"Two war generals of the Demon Night want me to let this brat go! Are you two deranged?" the ogre war lord asked, rolling his eyes.</p>

  <p>The Demon Night members had reason to believe that Luo Luo Zheng was indeed remarkable, and the ogre war lord could also see through it.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng frowned as he watched the Demon Night members.</p>

  <p>Although they had not been too hostile toward him, he naturally wasn't willing to fall into the hands of any race. Moreover, these people might not have the strength to persuade him to stay.</p>

  <p>He hadn't expected the situation on this continent to be so complicated.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, more than twenty figures shot into the sky from a nearby forest, heading straight for Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Hello, everyone! These are humans. They have nothing to do with the Demon Night or the ogres, do they?" came a bright and bold voice. The speaker was a middle-aged man sporting a long beard.</p>

  <p>The other humans pulled out their weapons and drew nearer.</p>

  <p>"Humans." Luo Zheng's gaze flickered, a hint of a smile appearing on his face.</p>

  <p>They were different from the ones that Luo Luo Zheng had brought along. These people were warriors.</p>

  <p>So long as human warriors existed, the human race would hold great power here. That was good news for Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, although there were a number of humans, they didn't seem strong enough. As per the strength division of the chaotic continent, they all seemed to be war generals.</p>

  <p>War fighter, war general, war lord...</p>

  <p>The humans had more than twenty war generals, while the Demon Night only had two war generals. As for the ogres, they had a war lord. The situation was still troublesome.</p>

  <p>"Humans are as timid as mice. You've long been hiding and cowering.</p>

  <p>Finally you dare to show your faces?" The ogre war lord did not seem to consider the twenty or so human war generals a threat at all. On the contrary, he seemed more skeptical and nervous of the two Demon Night war generals.</p>

  <p>"Well, we are here now, aren't we?" said the silver-haired man indifferently.</p>

  <p>Although the area was three-legged, the ogres were the most tyrannical.</p>

  <p>While the Demon Night did not have any intentions of expanding their territory, the ogres dared not provoke them. Only the humans were the weakest, so they stayed inside their fort.</p>

  <p>This particular group of humans had long contemplated whether or not they should lend a helping hand to Luo Luo Zheng. After all, it would be a great risk for them. If they angered the ogres, it was very possible that the delicate balance among the three races would be broken.</p>

  <p>However, after reporting it to their superiors and receiving the orders, they knew what to do. They had to save the human kid. That was why the human race sent out all their elites? a total of more than twenty people to the forest. Still, they hadn't imagined that the ogres would send over an ogre war lord.</p>

  <p>"You, follow them," Luo Luo Zheng, who was stuck in the middle of the confrontation, commanded the ordinary humans.</p>

  <p>The ordinary humans didn't understand what they were caught between and could only follow Luo Zheng's instructions. Once he had given the order, the hundreds of people slowly began to move toward the humans warriors.</p>

  <p>They were so slow. If they had not delayed Luo Luo Zheng by a few days, he would have already been thousands of miles away.</p>

  <p>The ogre war lord stared at Luo Luo Zheng. To him, the ordinary and powerless humans were nothing more than a herd of cattle. What was infinitely more important was that Luo Luo Zheng didn't go anywhere.</p>
