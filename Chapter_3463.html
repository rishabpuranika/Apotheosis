  <p>
</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng wondered about the origin of the Evil God's energy, the Green Jade Spirit's voice resounded once again. "Burning an Other Shore Token will produce unimaginable power, and he's burning the entire world?truly powerful."</p>

  <p>"He's burning the world? He's crazy!" Luo Zheng's eyes were wide in shock.</p>

  <p>"You didn't know? He's a maniac. There's nothing he can't do," said the Green Jade Spirit.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was well aware of how difficult it was to be the spokesperson of a civilization.</p>

  <p>Among the countless creatures in the Lust World, maybe only he and the Evil God were lucky enough to be such spokespersons.</p>

  <p>A civilization pinned everything on the Evil God but he chose to burn it all to win a fight?</p>

  <p>It was an insane idea!</p>

  <p>"Ling Shuang, Yan, Feng Ge, Chaim? You'd better run away from this world now! Everything will be destroyed!" Luo Zheng urgently reminded his companions.</p>

  <p>But he didn't need to tell them for them to know something was terribly wrong.</p>

  <p>The mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits had even started running toward the edge of the strangely-colored world.</p>

  <p>At this point, the Separate Abyss race and the Ear Mouse race finally gave up their attack on the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits? their lives held priority at this critical moment.</p>

  <p>As they approached the world's edge, a mass of black energy burst like flames. The Green Jade Crystals were instantly engulfed in the black fire, and a black thread appeared before them.</p>

  <p>"The world is divided?"</p>

  <p>Mount raised his hands to try to move the people from the Taiyi Heaven Palace and the Li Shan mountain out of the strangely-colored world.</p>

  <p>It wasn't out of kindness? he never planned on changing his position. But Luo Zheng had defeated the Evil God, so he was merely returning the favor.</p>

  <p>But as soon as the space channel that was involved with the truth of space was established, it was blocked by a strict black divisive thread.</p>

  <p>Just as Mount gave it another try, another figure appeared nearby? it was none other than Fuxi.</p>

  <p>"My respects, Human Sovereign." Mount bowed to Fuxi.</p>

  <p>The latter snorted in contempt. Mount was merely the avatar of a Chaos Ancient God.</p>

  <p>Fuxi came to save people, more specifically, to save Yan.</p>

  <p>Never did he expect the Evil God to go crazy.</p>

  <p>In Fuxi's eyes, spokespersons of civilizations were common. He had even already killed a master who had activated the Inheritance of World before.</p>

  <p>But no spokesperson dared burn the civilization behind him? he'd sooner die than do so.</p>

  <p>It wasn't only a matter of truth punishment, but also a matter of trust.</p>

  <p>The civilization entrusted the Civilization Artifact to the Evil God? they wholeheartedly put their faith in him. And yet, he chose to burn the entire civilization as if it was a mere Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>While Fuxi couldn't recognize the civilization's origin, he knew that it was definitely not on a low level. Even if it had hidden in Stage Thirteen of the Lust World and suppressed its own strength greatly, the consequences of its burning were bound to be horrible.</p>

  <p>Phew!</p>

  <p>And so Fuxi took a deep breath.</p>

  <p>He stepped forward, accumulating terrifying power.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>Then, he pushed his palm toward the world.</p>

  <p>A black and white mark of Eight Diagrams was created from nowhere, printed on the world's surface.</p>

  <p>There were two ways to defeat the Inheritance of World? first was to find and kill the owner's real body, and second, was to destroy the entire world.</p>

  <p>Fuxi had chosen the second way? it was a simple and rough method, but it was effective.</p>

  <p>Fuxi's attack was strong enough to crush the entire Chaotic Source World, even as he kept his strength in check. At the very least, he could open the world.</p>

  <p>But the huge palm of Eight Diagrams passed right through the 'world' and shot out the other side. It hit the southern peak within the ring-shaped mountain range and smashed the peak to pieces before it collapsed.</p>

  <p>The great power surprisingly caused no harm whatsoever to the burning world.</p>

  <p>'The space is isolated?' Mount raised his brows at the thought.</p>

  <p>Examining his own palm, Fuxi depressed, his face grim. He turned to Mount and asked, "What happened?"</p>

  <p>When it came to understanding the space, he was nowhere nearly as good as Mount.</p>

  <p>But the latter shook his head, confused. "The whole world seems to have been isolated while being burnt?it doesn't look like it belongs to this space. I've never seen this before."</p>

  <p>"Will the burning world? really have such an effect?"</p>

  <p>It was the first time they had ever witnessed someone burning an entire world. Never did Fuxi ever think it could happen? it dawned on him just how much everything was out of his control at that moment.</p>

  <p>As it was all he could do, he threw a few more palm strikes at the world.</p>

  <p>The ring-shaped mountain range were all crushed by the palm prints of Eight Diagrams. But they still couldn't directly touch the world? it seemed like a mirage at this point.</p>

  <p>Outside the Chaotic Source World, everyone was in an uproar while the leaders looked grim.</p>

  <p>"So even the Human Sovereign can't stop him?"</p>

  <p>"They're just going to die in there?"</p>

  <p>"God? he's really a madman! He's already burned the world to this degree.</p>

  <p>Even we would be trapped there to die? let alone all those juniors!"</p>

  <p>Leaders from the Taiyi Heaven Palace, the Separate Abyss race, the Ear Mouse race and some other races were in despair.</p>

  <p>Any sense of hope seemed to have been lost from these leaders. They had traveled thousands of miles to send their juniors to the Chaotic Source World. How could they accept such an end?</p>

  <p>In contrast, the leaders of the Bearing race, the Divine Farmer race, the New Moon race and the Jin Wu seemed more than pleased about the situation.</p>

  <p>Most of their clansmen had been swept away by the hurricane. Even though they all hurried back, a good portion of them were still outside the core area. So the loss of their races wouldn't be as great as others'.</p>

  <p>Khalid of the Bearing race, in particular, had already been sent out of the Chaotic Source World? he had the luxury of watching everything unfold from a distance, away from the chaos. But he also had a lingering fear at the sight of the world burning.</p>

  <p>"Haha!"</p>

  <p>"No one can leave!"</p>

  <p>"Come and taste the great fear of annihilation!"</p>

  <p>The Evil God's voice echoed throughout the space.</p>

  <p>"Is there no way out?"</p>

  <p>At this point, Luo Zheng had grown anxious.</p>

  <p>The first black meteorite fell from the sky, headed for the disciples from Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>For a moment, the disciples watched the object fall, their faces having gone pale.</p>

  <p>They were all done for if the meteorite hit them.</p>

  <p>"Up!"</p>

  <p>Clenching his hand, Luo Zheng conjured up countless Green Jade Crystals to shield the disciples from the meteorite.</p>

  <p>Although the crystals were extremely solid, they were easily smashed by the black energy of the meteorite, as though they were mere dry weeds on open land.</p>

  <p>With another wave of his hand, Luo Zheng made several more crystals grow from the ground, wrapping around the Taiyi Heaven Palace disciples and pulling them to the side.</p>

  <p>The moment the disciples slid out of range, the meteorite landed on the ground.</p>
