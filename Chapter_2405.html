  <p>
</p>

  <p>The wealthy clans on the Floating Islands would also participate in the debate over the Godly Ways.</p>

  <p>But Joy had once mentioned that those from wealthy clans on the Floating Islands didn't have to travel a long way like the ordinary True Gods to participate in the debate over the Godly Ways. They just needed to go to the Floating Island of the Sword Clan and pay a certain number of divine might coins before they could use the transmission channels of the Sword Clan.</p>

  <p>The boundary of the Non-combat Zone was vast and wide. The place that Joy had brought Zheng to was remote. The possibility of encountering warriors of wealthy clans on the Floating Islands was close to none.</p>

  <p>Moreover, they would be safe once they entered this Non-Combat Zone.</p>

  <p>The two top-rank True Gods, one dressed in black and one in white, were familiar with this area. They were fellow disciples. The one in black was called Andreas Lai, and the one in white was called Jordi Fan.</p>

  <p>Since this place was in the middle of nowhere, the members of the Sword Clan rarely patrolled it for inspection. On the contrary, many True Gods often entered Non-combat Zone through this path.</p>

  <p>The two top-rank True Gods had predicted this would happen. So every time the debate over the Godly Ways started, they would rob the True Gods of divine might coins or golden Sanskrit words.</p>

  <p>Divine might coins were hard currency in the divine land and were preferred by the two top-rank True Gods even though golden Sanskrit words could also be sold during the debate over the Godly Ways. If they were lucky enough to obtain rare golden Sanskrit words, they could then sell them at a high price.</p>

  <p>Over the years, they had gained a lot through these robberies.</p>

  <p>"I've come all this way to participate in the debate over the Godly Ways with these Sanskrit words. You can keep the divine might coins, but could you spare these Sanskrit words?"</p>

  <p>One of the low-rank True Gods took out what looked like ten divine might coins. This was all the money he had.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha!" Andreas Lai grinned coldly as he grabbed the Sanskrit words.</p>

  <p>"These are only copies of Sanskrit words and they are cheap. I won't take them even if you give them to me for free!" With these words, a bright fire flickered in Andreas Lai's hand and burned the papers down before anyone could react.</p>

  <p>"Aaahh!" the low-rank True God screamed in pain as he saw this, his face contorted in grief.</p>

  <p>He was aware that the copies of these Sanskrit words were cheap, but he had his own understanding of them.</p>

  <p>"You are a group of idiots! You're foolish to expect that luck would be on your side. Let me tell you, you just want to be a tiny part of the debate over the Godly Ways, and that is a waste of time!" Andreas Lai said disdainfully as he looked up and off into the distance.</p>

  <p>"Eh?" a confused sound escaped his lips as he watched two more low-rank True Gods making their way over to them.</p>

  <p>They were Zheng and Joy. Andreas Lai was about to nudge Jordi Fan and make him stop them when his eyes fell on Joy, who was wearing a cloak.</p>

  <p>Although Joy was fully covered, her graceful, pretty face looked all the more pure and gorgeous in the land of snow and ice.</p>

  <p>So beautiful was she that Andreas Lai couldn't take his eyes off of her.</p>

  <p>His heart began thumping within his chest as he began to imagine the kind of exquisite body that must be under the cloak.</p>

  <p>"Jordi, keep an eye on these people. I'll stop them," Andreas Lai said, an obscene smile taking over his face as he flew forward.</p>

  <p>Zheng and Joy had seen a group of True Gods in the distance quite a while ago, but they didn't know what they were doing.</p>

  <p>"A top-rank True God is flying over. Are they from the Sword Clan?"</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes narrowed under the cloak.</p>

  <p>Joy shook her head and said, "The Sword Clan has many rules and they wear uniforms. They don't seem like Sword Clan members. They are probably elites from the surrounding areas."</p>

  <p>"Stop!" Andreas Lai called out to them, rushing over like the wind. He floated in the air as he looked down at the two low-rank True Gods. As a top-rank True God, he had a superiority complex that was clearly writ large on his face.</p>

  <p>His eyes were glued to Joy. The more he looked at her, the more wildly his heart beat. He envied Zheng for his good fortune of having such a beautiful lady by his side. He laughed and asked, "Are you coming to participate in the debate over the Godly Ways held by the Sword Clan?"</p>

  <p>Zheng and Joy were smart.</p>

  <p>Noticing Andreas Lai's brazen gazes and looking at the group of people nearby who were handing in the divine might coins, they already knew what was happening.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Zheng replied with a smile.</p>

  <p>Zheng's innocent smile made him even prouder, for some reason. It looked to him that the young man hadn't seen much of the world. A man like him was the easiest to deal with.</p>

  <p>"Good. It's a rule here that if you want to cross that line safely, you should hand over all your divine might coins and Sanskrit words first,"</p>

  <p>Andreas Lai said, pointing to the snow line. Crossing the snow line would mean that one was entering the Non-combat Zone.</p>

  <p>He looked closely at Zheng and Joy. To his disappointment, there was no change in their expressions.</p>

  <p>Zheng looked pointedly at Andreas Lai and smiled faintly, "What if we refuse to give you anything?"</p>

  <p>"Refuse?" Andreas Lai chuckled. "That's fine. But the beauty who's behind you could stay with my brother and me to give us company. Only about three to five years. You look poor and I don't think you have many divine might coins, so that's okay."</p>

  <p>At this, Joy lowered her cloak and shook off the snowflakes that had fallen on her long eyelashes.</p>

  <p>She looked delicate and attractive, which excited Andreas Lai even more.</p>

  <p>Zheng reached out a hand and a mound of divine might coins appeared in his hand. He smiled innocently at Andreas Lai, hoping to come across as naive and harmless. "Would these be enough?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Two years ago, Zheng had accumulated a massive amount of divine might coins in his journey to the Time Sea Forbidden Land. Even the forbidden areas in his inner world were constantly producing divine might coins.</p>

  <p>His wealth might not be comparable to those of the wealthy clans on the Floating Islands, but he was already far wealthier than first tier clans.</p>

  <p>He had casually brought out five hundred divine might coins to show Andreas Lai.</p>

  <p>"Wh-what?"</p>

  <p>Andreas Lai stuttered in surprise.</p>

  <p>He hadn't expected Zheng to be so rich. Ordinary low-rank True Gods couldn't offer so many divine might coins. Could it be that this man was a young master from some second tier clan?</p>

  <p>At this thought, Andreas Lai was even more excited. He laughed as he stared at Zheng. "I thought it would be enough to have that beauty. I didn't expect to meet a fat sheep! Give me all your belongings. I can make sure that you won't suffer in your death."</p>

  <p>There was no consistency between what he was saying and the glimmer in his eyes. He looked like he was ready to kill.</p>

  <p>He couldn't figure out where Zheng came from. But he believed that it would be better for him to kill a young man such as Zheng, who obviously had a powerful background, in order to avoid revenge in the future.</p>

  <p>Zheng heaved as he flipped his palm. All the divine might coins were instantly transferred into his space ring. And as his aura changed, he smiled, as if he was being forced to do something he didn't want to do.</p>

  <p>But Joy still watched, a deadpan look on her face, as if Andreas Lai didn't exist at all.</p>

  <p>Andreas Lai now felt a faint sense of impending danger, but he did not pay much attention to it. After all, he believed he could deal with two low-rank True Gods easily.</p>

  <p>"I offered you the chance," Zheng said as a warning.</p>

  <p>His voice had barely faded away when he suddenly emitted a faint aura.</p>

  <p>He then disappeared before Andreas Lai.</p>

  <p>Although his opponent was a top-rank True God, Zheng had no intention of showing him the slightest bit of mercy.</p>

  <p>Before he had comprehended the Truth of Godly Way, he might not have been able to defeat a powerful top-rank True God like Soren. But he was now confident that facing any top-rank True God outside the Floating Islands would not lead to his defeat.</p>

  <p>Thanks to his cultivation of the past two years, Zheng's comprehension of the Truth of Godly Way had risen to a new level. What was more, his Godly Tile had become more and more stable, and his strength had steadily improved as well. Zheng was no longer who he was before when facing those top-rank True Gods.</p>

  <p>"Disappeared?"</p>

  <p>Andreas Lai was stunned. He couldn't think of the kind of concealment skill Zheng had used that had enabled him to disappear in such a manner from before his eyes! Even if his perception was not slow, it was difficult to find any clues.</p>

  <p>Joy suddenly raised her head. As a breeze swept by, she said with a gentle smile, "No, he hasn't disappeared."</p>

  <p>"Hasn't disappeared?" he repeated, panicking. "Then where is he?"</p>

  <p>Andreas Lai could barely maintain his calm now that he had realized that Zheng was only a low-rank True God. The gap in their cultivation levels was so huge that Zheng should technically not be a threat to him.</p>

  <p>Joy looked up, where there was nothing visible, and a hint of admiration appeared in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"In the wind," she said lightly.</p>

  <p>A cold wind swept towards Andreas Lai, howling as it came.</p>
