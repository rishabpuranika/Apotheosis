<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1100 The Other Side Of Space </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Space Law was such a powerful technique that Logan only needed to use two simple moves to defeat his challengers.</p>

  <p>He traveled through space and then slashed his sword to his rival before the latter could react.</p>

  <p>Though his strategy leaned on its simplicity, it seemed that no one was able to figure out how to dodge his attacks. Defeating the first-tier warriors from the other kingdoms was a breeze for Logan.</p>

  <p>After all, the Space Law wasn't that easy to grasp. Most people had not the slightest knowledge about it, let alone knew how to cultivate or apply it. When Logan managed to comprehend the third layer of the Space Law, his strength was able to surpass other warriors of the same level.</p>

  <p>As he traveled through space during his attack on Luo Luo Zheng, he was surprised to witness how his rival had also disappeared right before him. He felt the familiar power of the Space Law.</p>

  <p>"So he knows the Space Law, too?"</p>

  <p>Logan was startled by that revelation. He hastily swung his Space Chopping Sword but missed.</p>

  <p>There was a hint of sarcasm on Luo Zheng's face as he looked at Logan from where he stood. They weren't that far away from each other.</p>

  <p>Seeing Luo Zheng's expression, Logan's face flushed with anger. When did any warrior with the same cultivation level dare mock him? In addition, Luo Luo Zheng was only at the middle stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm.</p>

  <p>The crowd began discussing their shared surprise. "I never expected that this Tianxing is also proficient in the Space Law! I bet he has grasped the second layer of it at least!"</p>

  <p>"But Logan has already comprehended the third layer of the Space Law!</p>

  <p>I wonder who comes out of this battle victorious!"</p>

  <p>"So what if it's the third layer? I don't think Logan has completely comprehended the third layer. He has grasped ten percent of it at most, so his advantage isn't that colossal. Ultimately, their fighting abilities shall decide the outcome!"</p>

  <p>"If Tianxing doesn't use his soul attack to crush Logan, I think his chance of winning is still slim."</p>

  <p>Many of the divine-level geniuses gasped in awe when they witnessed Luo Zheng's own usage of the Space Law. They believed that he was one lucky kid. Not only did he possess a strong soul, but he also practiced the most formidable of all? the Space Law.</p>

  <p>"Seems like I need to take you more seriously," Logan said, renouncing all of his contempt by tightening his grip on the Space Chopping Sword.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you serious enough?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled. He knew that he was getting on Logan's last nerve.</p>

  <p>"Die!" Logan yelled in gritted teeth.</p>

  <p>Taking another step forward, he disappeared once again.</p>

  <p>"Wait, what?" Luo Zheng's eyes widened with how quick he was. He couldn't sense any of Logan's breath, too. For a moment there, it seemed that he completely disappeared from the world.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng knew that it could be one of the abilities a warrior could possess after grasping the third layer of the Space Law. Logan didn't disappear totally, he was only hiding in the void.</p>

  <p>The first layer of the Space Law could enable the cultivator to travel through space for a short distance, but that was only the phenomenon on the surface. The ultimate goal was to connect two space nodes with the help of the Space Law so that one could move through them.</p>

  <p>After grasping the second layer, the cultivator could temporarily stay out of the space. Luo Luo Zheng could only stay in the void for a little while. Like a rock thrown into the sky would be pulled back to the ground by gravity in an instant, his body would also be rejected by the void and return to the normal space.</p>

  <p>After the cultivator had already grasped the first and second layers of the Space Law, there were still many other methods that he could use to fight. For instance, he could condense the Space Armor or the Space Chopping Sword with the help of the Space Law.</p>

  <p>The obelisk in the Genuine Dragon World only recorded the first layer of the Space Law, and Luo Luo Zheng had only grasped the second layer in the Tower of Sin. Although Luo Luo Zheng didn't comprehend the third layer yet, he guessed that Logan was able to hide in the void.</p>

  <p>With eyes like a hawk's, Luo Luo Zheng carefully scanned the space around him.</p>

  <p>Indeed, Logan was a force to be reckoned with. Luo Luo Zheng knew that, too. The ordinary warriors at the late stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm were obviously just snacks for him.</p>

  <p>If he were to hide in the void and launch a sneak attack, Luo Luo Zheng didn't have much choice. It was questionable whether or not he could sidestep that possible attack.</p>

  <p>"Whooosh!"</p>

  <p>Since he was keen-eyed at that same exact moment, Luo Luo Zheng easily felt the familiar energy wave of the Space Law getting closer.</p>

  <p>"He's here,"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng whispered to himself. He felt an immense sense of danger. Once again, he traveled through space and left the place.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng began to move a distance, he saw Logan back at the same spot as he looked back. Logan reappeared with a murderous smile on his face. A few drops of red blood dripped down from the blade of the sword in his hand.</p>

  <p>"That's one unique physique you've got! That slash was supposed to cut your neck open!" Logan looked at Luo Luo Zheng with a strange expression. He shook his head and smiled casually. Then, he stuck his tongue out to lick the blood off the sword, "But I am too slow! The next time, I'll be faster, and there's no more escaping for you!"</p>

  <p>A thin line of blood appeared on Luo Zheng's neck. The Space Chopping Sword was able to destroy a sacred weapon. Even Luo Zheng's body, which was as strong as a top-grade fairy weapon, was unable to hold out against it.</p>

  <p>However, if it was another person, they could have already been decapitated.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng looked extremely calm and collected as he replied, "There will be no next time. Even if you hid in the void, I would see right through your dirty movements!"</p>

  <p>"Huh, really? Isn't that just impressive?" Logan mocked Luo Zheng's words. He refused to believe him. Once again, he quickly disappeared right before his very eyes.</p>

  <p>The void was separated from the normal space of the world. Generally speaking, it was the world within the space cracks, which was like the opposite side of a mirror. It was the other side of space where nothing existed. Nothing.</p>

  <p>Logan wasn't using a concealment skill, nor did he intend on releasing a breath that Luo Luo Zheng could catch. It was impossible for Luo Luo Zheng to detect him through his movements as he said.</p>

  <p>"As expected, Logan is not an easy opponent," someone from the audience commented.</p>

  <p>"Logan is truly the pride of our York Divine Kingdom! It's true what they say, he is an invincible figure among all the warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm! There is no way out of his attacks!"</p>

  <p>"This Tianxing will certainly die in the hands of Logan! Since War Emperor York has already revealed his hostility towards him, he won't allow Tianxing to leave this place alive!"</p>

  <p>The warriors of the Jade Martial House also watched the battle anxiously.</p>

  <p>Based on the commotion before the battle began, most warriors of the Harlen Divine Kingdom had guessed that Luo Luo Zheng was most likely from the Sky Northern Region and wasn't a true member of their kingdom.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng represented the Harlen Divine Kingdom in the battle in the name of the Jade Martial House. Their king Turner had confirmed so.</p>

  <p>That was why they were not to treat Luo Luo Zheng as an outsider.</p>

  <p>"Come on, Tianxing!"</p>

  <p>"Be careful of him and always move rapidly! Make sure he doesn't catch up to you!"</p>

  <p>Many warriors of the Harlen Divine Kingdom encouraged Luo Luo Zheng through ways they could think of at the time.</p>

  <p>After Logan hid into the void, Luo Luo Zheng raised the sword in his hand. His eyes flickered for a moment before an emerald green light flowed inside them.</p>

  <p>He was activating his magic vision.</p>

  <p>Such a skill allowed him to see through illusions and detect subtle changes and movements around him.</p>

  <p>Logan's strategy of traveling through the void with the thought of assassinating him did shake Luo Luo Zheng a little. However, he still had a way to solve that problem.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng had fully activated his magic vision, the entire world became green in his eyes. Even if Logan was walking on the other side of space, it was impossible that he didn't leave tracks.</p>

  <p>Thanks to his magic vision, Luo Luo Zheng noticed a tiny black line extending through the air. It was a trajectory left behind by Logan's movement throughout the void.</p>

  <p>This black line could not be seen with the naked eyes nor be detected with soul perception as well. However, it was clear as day through Luo Zheng's magic vision.</p>

  <p>It was of utmost importance to be stealthy at all times. So instead of just focusing on the strange line, Luo Luo Zheng kept glancing around and pretended that he didn't notice Logan's movements at all.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Logan was also getting on full guard against Luo Luo Zheng. He cautiously circled around him before he slowly approached from upfront.</p>

  <p>It seemed that he wanted to attack him by surprise from his front view.</p>

  <p>As the black line drew closer, Luo Zheng's face started to grow hesitant. As it got close enough, he suddenly revealed a sly smile as he forcefully thrust his sword forward.</p>

  <p>The timing was perfect. His weapon collided against Logan's Space Chopping Sword.</p>

  <p>Since Logan had just come out of the void, he had left a space crack behind him which was just enough for a person to pass through. Luo Luo Zheng took advantage of this opportunity as he, not only forced Logan back, but followed him into the space crack as well.</p>

  <p>Previously, the Soul Sea Realm masters had created an enchanted barrier for the battles between the Virtual Tribulation Realm warriors. But now, both of them had disappeared from the arena where they were supposed to showcase their fight.</p>
