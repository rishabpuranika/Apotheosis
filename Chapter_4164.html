<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4164 The Black Lamp </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>There were over a thousand savage races in the Burial Land yet none of them knew what had just happened.</p>

  <p>These barbaric races feared nothing yet that sudden burst of terrifying will had them trembling in their boots.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom...</p>

  <p>With the arrival of thunder was a booming voice that spread across the land.</p>

  <p>Three streaks of white lightning appeared at the edge of the world and all creatures that were unfortunate enough to have been struck died instantly before they could even scream.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the Snake Spirit King's voice spoke to the world.</p>

  <p>"Do you want strength?" he asked. His voice was encompassing and made even the strongest hearts tremble.</p>

  <p>Though these savage races were currently in panic, the sheer worship and devotion in their eyes were unmistakable. This black snake's power was truly something divine.</p>

  <p>'I also want that type of power....'</p>

  <p>'We can control everything with such level of power!'</p>

  <p>'This invincible force can make me strong!'</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King's offer filled everyone with excitement and fighting spirit.</p>

  <p>"I want strength! I want power!"</p>

  <p>"Master! Grant upon us such power!"</p>

  <p>"I will pursue this path towards greatness no matter the cost..."</p>

  <p>Their enthusiastic response did not surprise the Snake Spirit King. In fact, he expected it.</p>

  <p>This world was devoid of morality and order and these savage races only knew slaughter. They would do anything if it meant more power.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>From the place where the three streaks of white lightning intersected formed a snake-shaped totem. It was so big and dazzling that it could be seen from across the entire Burial Land.</p>

  <p>"Go towards the totem!" the Snake Spirit King ordered.</p>

  <p>"It is there that you will obtain unprecedented power!"</p>

  <p>As the totem was put in place, the entire Burial Land began to change shape.</p>

  <p>A crack split open on each of the three sides of the Burial Land. The land began to morph into something that resembled a three-mouthed monster.</p>

  <p>With its job done with, the Snake Spirit King's consciousness returned to the Jade Pure Realm. "The Burial Land is ready," he said to the black light.</p>

  <p>"Let us commence with our plan then," the black light replied. "Go and ask the Blood Snake Girl to light up the black lamp."</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King's eyes flashed coldly at the mention of her name.</p>

  <p>"Blood Snake Girl..."</p>

  <p>However, he did as he was asked.</p>

  <p>A few seconds had just passed when a woman, inlaid on the wall at the side of the chaos, suddenly opened her eyes - she was the Blood Snake Girl!</p>

  <p>Her eyes shone like two beautiful crescent moons. "Father? Is that you?"</p>

  <p>"Activate the Evil Bead," the Snake Spirit King ordered harshly.</p>

  <p>The Blood Snake Girl tilted her head. "Are you still so stubborn?"</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King couldn't help but let out a series of laughter. "You know that the only reason I still let you live is to make you see how this all goes down. You will witness who was actually right in the end."</p>

  <p>There was no need to argue and the Blood Snake Girl decided to just shut her mouth.</p>

  <p>She had tried to resist more than a thousand chaotic eras ago and ended up imprisoned for so long.</p>

  <p>At this moment, she was somewhat expectant to see her father sport a desperate, helpless expression when he failed in the end.</p>

  <p>"Alright. I'll activate the Evil Bead."</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>Soon enough, the aforementioned Evil Bead above her head began to spin and traces of blood light began to gather within.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh...</p>

  <p>An unprecedented amount of energy soon surrounded the Evil Bead. The energy fluctuated like powerful waves across the infinite sea, pushing away the chaotic energy around.</p>

  <p>One thousand Jun of force...</p>

  <p>Ten thousand Jun of force...</p>

  <p>A million Jun of force...</p>

  <p>Ten million Jun of force...</p>

  <p>As time passed, the power hidden within the Evil Bead increased exponentially.</p>

  <p>Among all the ten Holy Items on the Snake Spirit Sect's holy pillar, it was only the Evil Dead that had the ability to absorb unlimited energy from the pillar.</p>

  <p>The terrifying energy was compressed into this small bead. If this energy exploded, even the Source World would be unable to withstand it. It was enough to create a huge hole in the Source World and destroy hundreds of large provinces!</p>

  <p>"Go ahead and light it up..." The Blood Snake Girl sneered.</p>

  <p>"Pop!"</p>

  <p>With a sharp popping sound, the Evil Bead suddenly released a ray of blood light that flew towards the boundless chaos.</p>

  <p>The terrifying energy absorbed by the bead was compressed into that single ray of blood light, which shot upward at an incredible speed.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>At that moment, the Li Shan mountain continued to fly in the chaos at high speed.</p>

  <p>To everyone's surprise, the ray of blood light, as thin as a finger yet faster than anything they'd ever seen, suddenly swept past just thirty thousand miles away from them.</p>

  <p>Had Li Shan mountain been a little bit slower, it would've gotten penetrated by that ray of blood light.</p>

  <p>Despite it being thirty thousand miles away, the massive energy it contained alerted the powerful warriors in the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess, Fuxi, Luo Zheng, and the three Chaos Ancient Gods looked east at the exact same time they felt an irresistible force suddenly rush past them.</p>

  <p>"What was that?"</p>

  <p>"How could there be such great power in the chaos?"</p>

  <p>"It was too fast. I couldn't see it."</p>

  <p>That sudden burst of power came and went so suddenly that there wasn't even any time to process or guess what it had been.</p>

  <p>A few seconds later, the blood light reached the top of the chaos and hit its thick dome.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>With its devastating power, the ray of blood light smashed the dome and revealed a small lamp.</p>

  <p>It was a small black oil lamp.</p>

  <p>This lamp had a basic shape and looked positively ancient. Despite the simplicity of its form, however, various complex patterns were engraved on its four, wooden pedestals. Inside the lamp was a glazed cup and a thin wick.</p>

  <p>If not for this lamp, the ray of blood light would've been able to pierce straight through the dome. This small, ancient relic was able to withstand such a heavy blow.</p>

  <p>Withstand, however, wasn't the right word. In truth, the lamp had absorbed all that power.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>The blood-red light circled around the oil lamp and gathered at its wick.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>From the darkness, a tiny, blood-red flame came alive.</p>

  <p>If the powerful warriors of the Four Spirits Sect saw what just happened, they would've been immobilized by fear.</p>

  <p>Back then, the Snake Spirit Sect lit up this very lamp and destroyed everything in the main world.</p>

  <p>In order to survive, the Human and Bird Spirit Sects were forced to escape and seek refuge in the chaos.</p>

  <p>Now, this harbinger of destruction, was once again alive.</p>

  <p>Countless crystals formed from within the oil lamp and began to spread out onto the chaos. These crystals contained the mysterious power of space.</p>

  <p>The chaos clouds grew restless when they met with these crystals.</p>

  <p>They usually floated quietly within the chaos and remained unchanging, unless they were absorbed by other things.</p>

  <p>Yet now, the presence of these crystals stirred something within these clouds as they began to rapidly absorb the chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>These chaos clouds that stretched out for trillions of miles were split into tens of thousands of pieces and began to take numerous shapes.</p>

  <p>By some weird power, the crystals morphed the chaos clouds into the many heads of strange beasts.</p>

  <p>These strange beasts had a bit of similarity to each other and the expressions they sported looked crazy.</p>

  <p>As the crystals continued to spread further into the chaos, the chaos clouds continued to transform and morph into these strange beast heads.</p>

  <p>They floated quietly in the chaos with their eyes closed.</p>
