<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2998 Little Devils </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Right at the corner of the Sword Dance Palace, there was a man in a cyan robe, who sat quietly.</p>

  <p>The man was tall and strapping and had sun-kissed dark skin. His face was covered with stubble, which emphasized the cynical look on his face. His clothes were stained and soiled, making him look very messy and unapproachable.</p>

  <p>As they were walking in the Sword Light Palace, Kenelm and the other people imagined what their future life would be inside the palace.</p>

  <p>What the strapping man said was like a pot of cold water poured on their faces. Luo Zheng was fine, but the other ten people's faces changed immediately.</p>

  <p>"Sir, how... how could you say that?" a cyan-robed young man questioned, feeling embarrassed.</p>

  <p>The strapping man got up from the ground and smiled as he slowly walked towards Kenelm and the other people. He stopped in front of them and said,</p>

  <p>"Of the thirteen cultivation palaces of the Sword Light Palace, the first-class palaces include the Burial Sword Palace, the Demon Sword Palace, and the Broken Sword Palace; the second-class palaces include the Sword Anger Palace, the Sword Legend Palace, and several other palaces. Do you have any idea that of all the cultivation palaces, the Sword Dance Palace is the worst? Now, it only receives people like you who joined the Sword Light Palace in informal ways. You're just wasting your lives if you stay in the Sword Dance Palace. Are you really sure that you want to join this team?"</p>

  <p>Upon hearing the man's statement, Kenelm was the first to lose his temper.</p>

  <p>At that point, Kenelm felt that his dreams were crushed. He felt like an invisible giant hand suddenly fell from the sky, wiping away his future.</p>

  <p>Surely, he was not happy with the strapping man's comments.</p>

  <p>"It's said that people who can get to the tomb of your member can become a disciple of the Sword Light Palace. But at this point, it seems that the Sword Light Palace is not going to fulfill this promise!" questioned Kenelm.</p>

  <p>Smiling faintly, the strapping man replied, "There is no reason for the Sword Light Palace to not keep their promises. If you don't want to change your mind and stay in the Sword Dance Palace, then I will certainly welcome you with open arms..."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by that? What are you trying to say?" Kenelm asked as he was starting to get angry at the man's audacity.</p>

  <p>Shrugging his shoulders, the strapping man responded, "Well, I'm not here to offend you. I'm just telling the truth."</p>

  <p>The Sword Light Palace had such a big force in the Seven-Star Province and had extremely complicated relationships with others.</p>

  <p>In fact, many big clans in the Seven-Star Province hoped to send their people to the Sword Light Palace. But due to various reasons, the Sword Light Palace was not able to refuse them.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, there were only twelve cultivation palaces in the Sword Light Palace. However, as an exception, the Sword Dance Palace was built and had become the thirteenth cultivation palace. All the people who were not gifted and who were denied from joining the other cultivation palaces were thrown into this one.</p>

  <p>Moreover, those who entered the Sword Light Palace through the virtue of finding the tombs were also thrown into this palace.</p>

  <p>Just like what the strapping man had been telling them, it was clear that the Sword Light Palace seemed to be a place for misfits and non-gifted people.</p>

  <p>Realizing that the place they were so excited to go to was a place for duds, Kenelm and his companions got furious.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng was still unbothered, looking calm as usual.</p>

  <p>Back when he was still in the Excellence City, Luo Zheng had already been suspicious about the rules of the Sword Light Palace. Despite this, he could not just convince Kenelm to believe him and crush his dreams.</p>

  <p>It was said that every great force had to discover the best disciples, making it a waste of resources to take in ordinary people. This was true in the divine land and in the Source World.</p>

  <p>"So, do you still want to join the Sword Dance Palace? Yes, or no?" The corner of the strapping man's mouth curled upward in a smirk.</p>

  <p>Kenelm clenched his fists upon hearing the strapping man's condescending question. Furrowing his brows, he gritted his teeth and answered, "Yes!"</p>

  <p>The other people from the Excellence City knew that it wouldn't be easy to get this kind of opportunity elsewhere, and if they went back, it would be a huge shame.</p>

  <p>"Me too!"</p>

  <p>"Count me in!"</p>

  <p>"In that case, I'd like to join..."</p>

  <p>The others echoed in succession.</p>

  <p>All the strapping man felt was pity as he looked at the these men's sincere and naive faces. "Well, in that case...After you register, head straight to the backyard. I hope that those little devils can shut up for a while..."</p>

  <p>Just when the crowd was about to register following the two cyan-robed men, the strapping man said, "Remember, my name is Ingram Qiu. I'm the leader of the Sword Dance Palace. If you meet any trouble, you'd better not ask for my help. Solve it yourself."</p>

  <p>After his command, Ingram Qiu took several steps forward and left the palace without looking back.</p>

  <p>Everyone was at a loss for words upon hearing Ingram Qiu's words. After registering their names on the ledger, they each got a token which served as their official welcome. The Sword Dance Palace wasn't valued, making the entire registration process quick and easy.</p>

  <p>Afterwards, the two cyan-robed men led everyone into the backyard. "This is your new living space," said one of the cyan-robed men. After showing them around, they left in a hurry and never looked back, as if they were trying to get away from something frightening.</p>

  <p>The Sword Dance Palace was not that important in the Sword Light Palace.</p>

  <p>But since it was also a cultivation palace, it was still built according to the standard size of one, making it boast of its very huge backyard.</p>

  <p>Kenelm and his companions all stood there dumbfounded as they could not believe how spacious their new living space was. All of a sudden, a light whistle sounded in the area. After that, twenty to thirty young men clad in cyan slowly walked out from every corner of the backyard.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng took a close look and observed who these people were. But as soon as he noticed that they bore unfriendly expressions on their faces, he narrowed his eyes in suspicion.</p>

  <p>"Ha ha, it has only been half a month, and someone recklessly joined the Sword Dance Palace. It seems that most of you are definitely not from the Seven-Star City," said a long-haired young man who led the crowd, smiling in contempt.</p>

  <p>"People from the Seven-Star City are not that stupid. Our Sword Dance Palace is notorious in that city, and no one dares to come here especially when they are threatened with death," another silver-haired young man said, and also had a strange smile on his face.</p>

  <p>Standing in front of these men, Kenelm seemed to be gauging the matter as he tried to understand what the two men meant. As he stared at the long-haired young man, he could not help but ask in a trembling voice,</p>

  <p>"What...what do you mean by that?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing. It's just that there are rules in the Sword Dance Palace that need to be followed. The first step in joining us is for you to know them..."</p>

  <p>As the long-haired young man was trying to explain, Luo Zheng turned around and walked outside.</p>

  <p>"Wait, Luo Zheng, where are you going?" Kenelm asked Luo Zheng in a worried tone.</p>

  <p>Although Kenelm appeared to be the backbone of the group, he would turn to Luo Zheng in times of trouble.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng ignored Kenelm and trotted all the way, catching up with the two cyan-robed men who brought them to the living area.</p>

  <p>The two men turned around and saw Luo Zheng chasing after them. Confused, one of the men asked him, "What seems to be the problem?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng gave them a smile and asked, "I just want to ask you. What are the rules in the Sword Dance Palace? Would there be any punishment for any disciples who fight?"</p>

  <p>Taken aback by Luo Zheng's question, the two cyan-robed men exchanged glances.</p>

  <p>Of course, they knew what was going on in the backyard, and that was why they left hurriedly. Although those little devils were not extraordinary when it came to talent, they had a very strong background and were also responsible for the Sword Dance Palace's bad reputation.</p>

  <p>"Well, there are not many rules in the Sword Dance Palace. Disciples can spar with each other, but you can't kill people," one of the two replied.</p>

  <p>Almost all the disciples who joined the Sword Dance Palace had to be challenged by that group of little devils, like some kind of initiation. Only a small number of people were able to make it through, and most of them chose to leave the Sword Dance Palace after staying for less than one day.</p>

  <p>In fact, more than one hundred people had chosen to quit this year.</p>

  <p>"I see. Thank you for answering my question." Luo Zheng nodded as he returned to the backyard.</p>

  <p>Shaking their heads slightly, the two cyan-robed men were concerned about him and his friends. "This person doesn't believe that those little devils are difficult to deal with. If he leaves now, then he would surely avoid injury. I mean, those guys are really..."</p>

  <p>Apparently, the two of them had suffered a lot from those troublemakers.</p>
