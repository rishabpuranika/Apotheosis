<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The unending stream of fire birds rushed into Luo Zheng's mind, being destroyed like the internal momentum formed from the Grand Purple Mu Ning Technique.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng closed his eyes, the sharp golden light on his soul's surface flashed, and all the fire birds formed from the internal momentum flames were exterminated instantly.</p>

  <p>While killing the fire birds that drilled into his mind, Luo Luo Zheng also quietly observed the Infinity Ruler in his head.</p>

  <p>With his current abilities, he was still unable to control the ruler. Just now, when the ruler activated its special ability, it did so on its own.</p>

  <p>Now that Luo Luo Zheng had paid attention to it, he finally discovered the reason.</p>

  <p>After the fire birds were shattered by Luo Zheng's soul pressure, they turned into the internal momentum power, quietly absorbed by Infinity Ruler.</p>

  <p>When the Infinity Ruler absorbed all the remaining internal momentum power to a certain extent, a golden light erupted from the section of the Infinity Ruler.</p>

  <p>"Rumble..."</p>

  <p>The golden light moved from one end of the ruler to the other, finally stopping at a scale on top of it.</p>

  <p>'This scale should be the location the ruler reserved for the Elementary Fire Divine Dao.' As he had guessed, Luo Luo Zheng understood that these three thousand scales corresponded to three thousand Divine Dao? even the location of each Divine Dao had already been set!</p>

  <p>When the light stopped at the scale, another blazing light burst out and enveloped Luo Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng opened his eyes again, a pair of golden light rings appeared around his pupils.</p>

  <p>"Splash..."</p>

  <p>With Luo Zheng's eyesight, he could see that on the tablet of the Elementary Fire Divine Dao in front of him, the pure flames were like the unceasing surging of waves? the internal momentum became extremely chaotic.</p>

  <p>Although others might have thought that the internal momentum was a mess, Luo Luo Zheng could see through everything it contained.</p>

  <p>"The Elementary Fire Divine Dao is the fire source... All the Fire Laws were developed from the Elementary Fire Divine Dao. This Divine Dao is divided into four different levels. The first level is to control fire, the second is to create fire, the third is to create spirit essence, and the fourth is to turn into objects..."</p>

  <p>In others' eyes, the internal momentum seemed incomparably profound? it would have been difficult to understand even if one spent ten thousand years in comprehension. But in Luo Zheng's eyes, the mysterious internal momentum seemed rather simple.</p>

  <p>Even though Luo Zheng's comprehension ability far exceeded that of an ordinary talent, it was impossible for him to achieve such a level? that sudden enlightenment allowed Luo Luo Zheng to see through the true meaning of the Divine Dao Tablet in a short period of time. It all started with the Infinity Ruler.</p>

  <p>Soon after, the light on the ruler dimmed along with the rings of light around Luo Zheng's pupils. Finally, it returned to normal and a bright yellow flame symbol condensed on the scale at the end of the ruler.</p>

  <p>"I've succeeded!" Once again, Luo Zheng's guess was verified. He was utterly excited.</p>

  <p>In this case, did it mean that he could control three thousand Divine Dao? If all three thousand Divine Dao were to be fused into the Infinity Ruler, what sorts of changes would occur?</p>

  <p>But it was no easy feat to gather all three thousand Divine Dao. Luo Luo Zheng had yet to personally witness the true Divine Dao Tablets. Although there were three hundred or so tablets before him, their internal momentum wasn't quite perfect.</p>

  <p>'Since the ruler can record the imperfect internal momentum, in theory, the internal momentum of other True Gods would be absorbed as well.'</p>

  <p>Though Luo Luo Zheng managed to think something up, it couldn't be verified. If he had the chance to spar with a True God in the future, he could take the risk.</p>

  <p>When the internal momentum on the Divine Dao Tablet began to calm down, a pillar of fiery red light shot into the sky. At the same time, a ball of fire spread from the Divine Dao Tablet and wrapped around Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Though the fire light wasn't scorching, it made people feel quite warm.</p>

  <p>"He was acknowledged by the second Divine Dao Tablet..."</p>

  <p>"Alas. Even in my dreams, I struggle to be acknowledged by a Divine Dao Tablet. But even after spending so much time in comprehension, I've achieved nothing. How can this guy do it as easily as drinking water?"</p>

  <p>"He shouldn't have come to the Heavenly Han House. He should've gone straight to the Floating Island. Why would he want to be compared to us on this level?"</p>

  <p>All the proving godly warriors in the Consulting God Hall envied Luo Luo Zheng, feeling disappointed. They came from second-tier and third-tier clans and every one of their movements showed off the arrogance they were born with. But Luo Zheng's moves had completely destroyed their confidence.</p>

  <p>But now, Malloy and the others outside the Consulting God Hall were relieved.</p>

  <p>If they immediately declared the result after Luo Zheng's acknowledgement from the Grand Purple Mu Ning Technique, they would have offended Joy.</p>

  <p>And once Joy got angry about the matter, no one in the Han Clan could bear the consequence.</p>

  <p>Now that Luo Luo Zheng had gained the recognition of the Elementary Fire Divine Dao, things were much easier. Everyone just pretended not to know of the previous happenings.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng turned to leave the Divine Dao Tablet, Malloy's voice echoed throughout the entire hall once again. "Tianxing Luo from the Misty Mountain Village has been acknowledged by the Elementary Fire Divine Dao..."</p>

  <p>Now, Luo Luo Zheng had become the second proving godly warrior who had passed the Han Clan's test.</p>

  <p>After Zane passed the test, he left the hall without so much as looking back. The place was filled with the internal momentum's pressure, pushing great pressure onto one's soul? no one was willing to stay there for long.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng had no intention of leaving. Everyone watched in silence as Luo Luo Zheng jumped down from the steps and looked at the Divine Dao Tablet beside him.</p>

  <p>Even if there were some talents who could comprehend several Divine Dao simultaneously and be recognized by a few Divine Dao Tablets, such Divine Dao were all limited to a few specific kinds. But Luo Luo Zheng did not select the Divine Dao at all and instead tried to comprehend the Divine Dao individually.</p>

  <p>"Amazing... This guy hasn't selected the Divine Dao at all! He is comprehending them one by one!" Seth's mouth was agape as he looked at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"It's impossible for such a powerful warrior to exist. Maybe he just coincidentally comprehended the Grand Purple Mu Ning Technique and the Elementary Fire Divine Dao. He might not be able to comprehend the third Divine Dao." One of the nearby warriors denied it though? he couldn't believe that there was such a coincidence. Luo Zheng's actions were just too inconceivable, already exceeding his imagination and understanding. The warrior was unwilling to admit such a thing.</p>

  <p>"If he can be acknowledged by that tablet of the Tortoise Divine Dao, I will accept the fact!"</p>

  <p>A short while later, a beam of gray light began shining atop the tablet of the Tortoise Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>As it turned out, Luo Luo Zheng was acknowledged by the tablet of the Tortoise Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing this scene, quite a few proving godly warriors couldn't help but swallow. While the matter came as a terrible blow to some of them, others rejoiced as they watched the unimaginable scene.</p>

  <p>Outside the Consulting God Hall, Malloy and the group of True Gods who taught the Divine Dao glanced at each other, recognizing the strong shock in the depths of each other's eyes. The older True Gods had lived for about nine divine eras and the younger ones had been born in this era, but they had never heard of such a strange thing.</p>

  <p>"I heard that after Pascal became a proving godly warrior and returned from the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, he had comprehended four Divine Dao consecutively in a year. He was also already an outstanding warrior on the Floating Island. Tianxing Luo has now been acknowledged by three Divine Dao, and he..." Malloy's expression turned solemn, but his heart was filled with ecstasy.</p>

  <p>He had to prove his value to the Han Clan after he took the position of the leader of the Heavenly Han House. If he really did recommend Luo Luo Zheng, the Han Clan would be more friendly toward the sub-branches of the clan.</p>

  <p>"He doesn't have any plans to stop. He has already climbed to the fourth Divine Dao Tablet," the old man surnamed Chen said.</p>

  <p>"Should we go and stop him? It's too much," said another True God.</p>

  <p>Malloy looked rather hesitant, but eventually, he shook his head. He couldn't tell how Luo Luo Zheng had done it, but since Luo Luo Zheng didn't want to step out, Malloy had no intention of stopping him.</p>

  <p>And so, in front of everyone, Luo Luo Zheng comprehended the fifth tablet, the sixth tablet, the seventh...</p>

  <p>The scene left everyone stunned.</p>

  <p>Many proving godly warriors could only sigh as they groped for their own Divine Dao, hoping to gain the acknowledgement of the Divine Dao Tablet by comprehending it.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, Seth came in third, passing the test. But he didn't look the slightest bit happy about it. After all, there was a remarkable warrior in the Consulting God Hall that could easily earn the acknowledgement of the Divine Dao as easily as breathing. After working so hard, Seth obtained the acknowledgement of the Elementary Fire Divine Dao, but it was all for nothing. He could only sigh lightly and with a face heavy with sadness, he turned his head and left the Consulting God Hall.</p>

  <p>In spite of all Seth's experience in the world, he was still deeply shocked and disappointed inside.</p>
