<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>For a moment, Zheng stared at the enormous, gaping hole in the wall in surprise. The impact of Milo's sword strike was stronger than he'd thought.</p>

  <p>Quickly, he moved forward and passed through the hole in the wall.</p>

  <p>Once he got outside, Zheng paused, observing the scene around him. A lot of disciples from the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race were clustered around the hole on the outer side of the wall, goggling at him.</p>

  <p>When the wall had first appeared, trapping the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace inside, they hadn't been able to do anything. They could only wait anxiously outside.</p>

  <p>So it came as a shock to everyone when a hole was suddenly blown in the wall, and a man emerged, seemingly unscathed.</p>

  <p>"Didn't they say that the wall was impenetrable?"</p>

  <p>"How could someone manage to break through the wall and escape?"</p>

  <p>"Damn it! Stop him!" shouted Seamus. His goal was to take down all the elites of the Oneness Sky Palace, and he was determined not to allow anyone to escape from inside the wall.</p>

  <p>"You want to stop me? You are courting death!"</p>

  <p>Zheng said coldly, glaring at Seamus.</p>

  <p>The cultivation base of those guarding the outside of the wall was much, much weaker than Zheng's.</p>

  <p>Zheng had the ability to kill Indigo Souls; there was no doubt that he would find it easy to defeat these Souls of Light who had not yet become Indigo Souls.</p>

  <p>Within the wall, Zheng and the other disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace had suffered from the torment of the Champion Fish. This cruelty had roused his anger. Now, when he saw several Souls of Light moving to obey Seamus' command and attack him, Zheng struck back without mercy. A white cyclone appeared on the surface of his soul.</p>

  <p>"Mind Sword!"</p>

  <p>The sharp Mind Sword formed between Zheng's eyebrows and shot forward.</p>

  <p>The invisible sword radiance slashed through the air and instantly killed the six people in front of Zheng. Three of the dead had been close to becoming Indigo Souls.</p>

  <p>The disciples of the Bearing race looked at the bodies of the dead with wide eyes, struck with terror. Who was the young man who had emerged from the hole in the wall? He had just killed six powerful people in a single blow.</p>

  <p>They instantly realized that even if they attacked him together, they would probably be no match for him.</p>

  <p>"Back off!"</p>

  <p>"Get out of the Other Shore!"</p>

  <p>"Don't fight this guy head on!"</p>

  <p>These disciples called out frantic instructions to each other as they retreated. Some left the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Zheng let them go. He had no way of trapping them, so if they left the Other Shore, there was nothing he could do.</p>

  <p>More importantly, Dorothy and the other disciples were still trapped within the wall. The huge Champion Fish summoned by Seamus were very difficult to defeat, so Zheng needed to return immediately to help his companions. If he did not rescue them soon, they might get killed by the Champion Fish.</p>

  <p>He looked down at his feet. Blue light still shone brightly beneath his feet.</p>

  <p>The Soul Binding Threads had not disappeared when he passed through the hole in the wall.</p>

  <p>To test the Soul Binding Threads, Zheng tried to leave the Other Shore. It didn't work.</p>

  <p>'I must go to the temple and find a way to remove these threads, ' Zheng thought to himself. His eyes gleamed.</p>

  <p>His body was in Stage Four of the Other Shore. When his Soul of Light left the Other Shore and his body entered it, he would confront the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race once more. Then they would understand the meaning of real fear.</p>

  <p>With a soft whooshing sound, Zheng's Soul of Light turned into a sharp arrow.</p>

  <p>He headed straight to the Oneness Sky Palace's temple.</p>

  <p>Some distance away, huddled where they had retreated, the disciples of the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race saw Zheng leave. But they made no move to stop him. They thought they wouldn't be able to stop him even if they tried.</p>

  <p>The disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace were on high alert, standing at the entrance of the temple with tense, nervous expressions. None of them dared to take a single step out of the temple.</p>

  <p>"Who are you? Show me your soul mark!" someone shouted at Zheng as he approached the temple.</p>

  <p>On the Other Shore, they could not see each other's face clearly. They were afraid that the incoming figure was a spy sent by the Bearing race.</p>

  <p>Zheng raised his hand and displayed the lines on his palm.</p>

  <p>As soon as his identity had been verified, the people of the Oneness Sky Temple let Zheng inside. Several people immediately formed a circle around him to ask what was going on.</p>

  <p>"What happened?"</p>

  <p>"Why have you returned alone?"</p>

  <p>"Where is Efrain? He hasn't come back yet. He seems to be trapped inside the wall."</p>

  <p>Seamus had enacted his bold plan so suddenly and unexpectedly that no one had gotten the chance to escape from the wall. The disciples in the temple realized that something terrible must be happening inside the wall, but they had no way of finding out what exactly was going on.</p>

  <p>"There's no time to explain now," Zheng said impatiently. "Quick, help me get rid of these Soul Binding Threads."</p>

  <p>Some of the nearby disciples misunderstood Zheng's words. They thought he was scared of what had happened and wanted to escape to the Source World. Angrily, someone said, "Tell us what's going on before you flee!"</p>

  <p>"We should find a way to save the others!"</p>

  <p>"We are absolutely safe here in the temple. They don't dare to enter. Don't be so timid!"</p>

  <p>The disciples were making a great mistake in jeering at Zheng for his supposed cowardice when he was already so angry. Zheng's face darkened and he turned sharply towards the one who had called him timid.</p>

  <p>"Timid?" he sneered, grabbing the disciple.</p>

  <p>The man that Zheng had grabbed unceremoniously was also an Indigo Soul.</p>

  <p>However, under the pressure of Zheng's intimidating aura, he was unable to offer up any kind of resistance.</p>

  <p>"I escaped the wall to find a way to rescue the others. I need to go back as soon as possible, and yet idiots like you are slowing me down with your ignorant comments! Do you actually think any of you could save them if you tried?" Zheng shouted, losing his temper. "Tell me the way to remove these Soul Binding Threads. Now!"</p>

  <p>The disciple in Zheng's grip looked thoroughly daunted. "Go to the Soul Purifying Room. You can remove those Soul Binding Threads in there."</p>

  <p>"Take me there," Zheng ordered, throwing him onto the floor.</p>

  <p>The man hastily got to his feet and led Zheng away. The moment the two men disappeared, all the remaining disciples began talking at once. While they had been somewhat unsettled by Zheng's flash of temper, they were still convinced he was trying to leave the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>"That guy must be really scared."</p>

  <p>"From the way he looked, I'm afraid he won't dare to return to the Other Shore anymore."</p>

  <p>"It's very selfish of him to only care about himself. There are so many Oneness Sky Palace elite disciples inside the wall. If we lose them all, it will be an enormous loss for us."</p>

  <p>Everyone nodded and sighed. They wondered what they could do to help, but they couldn't think of anything.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng soon found himself at the door of the Soul Purifying Room. As he stepped inside, the patterns on the wall began to glow.</p>

  <p>Zheng stood in the center of the room, and the complex lights flickered and shimmered around him. He glanced down at his feet and saw the Soul Binding Threads dimming and then disappearing altogether.</p>

  <p>As soon as the threads were gone, Zheng didn't waste any more time. He used the Illusion Breaking Rune to get out of the Other Shore and return to his own room.</p>

  <p>The moment he opened his eyes, a flame spread out from his body, completely covering him from head to toe. Then his body returned to the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>As soon as he entered the Other Shore, he flew without hesitation towards the three temples.</p>

  <p>On the way, he saw a tall statue standing at the entrance of the Bearing race's temple. He flew headlong towards the statue.</p>

  <p>There was a loud crash as he collided with the statue.</p>

  <p>It was completely destroyed, crumbling to the ground in shards. The statue had been a valuable one. It had stood proudly in its place of honor for countless years.</p>

  <p>Shouts sounded from inside the temple when they saw the destruction.</p>

  <p>"Hey! Who are you?"</p>

  <p>"How dare you destroy the statue of our race!"</p>

  <p>"You are dead!"</p>

  <p>Several Souls of Light rushed out of the temple to confront the man who had demolished their treasure.</p>

  <p>Zheng ignored them. As he moved past the remnants of the statue, he kicked at the rubble, sending several stones flying like arrows towards the gate of the temple.</p>

  <p>His body strength far exceeded his soul strength. A casual kick from his body was far greater than the power of his Indigo Soul. He knew that the stones he had kicked would turn pillars into dust and instantly eliminate any Souls of Light they hit.</p>

  <p>Zheng wasn't normally so bloodthirsty, but these were unusual circumstances.</p>

  <p>It had been treacherous for the disciples of the Bearing race to lure the Oneness Sky Palace disciples into their trap to kill them all. Had it not been for Milo's astonishing sword attack that hit the wall, Zheng himself would also be dead, eaten by the Champion Fish.</p>

  <p>To be kind to his enemy was to be cruel to himself and his companions.</p>

  <p>Right now, he had no time for lengthy combat. He needed to dispense with any distractions quickly and with finality so that he could hurry back to the wall and save the other Oneness Sky Palace disciples. Otherwise, he would directly tear down the temple of the Bearing race.</p>
