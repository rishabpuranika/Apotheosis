<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The entirety of the Burial Land now came into Zheng's view.</p>

  <p>From the specific number of the Troubled Creatures, to the huge jars that were used to nurture Troubled Creatures at the bottom of the black mountain... Zheng could see it all.</p>

  <p>He could even sense the horde of Troubled Creatures swarming over to the primitive land, their minds filled with craziness, restlessness, and strong killing intent.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng had no interest in them. Instead, he focused on finding the location of the Snake Spirit King's coordinates.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the figures of the Snake Spirit King and the downgrader appeared in his mind's eye.</p>

  <p>While the two of them both had an acute sense of perception, they didn't notice Zheng's watchful eye. If it were anyone else, they'd have found out immediately, but Zheng's state of omniscience was different. As opposed to spying, this omniscience let him know everything about anything in a single thought.</p>

  <p>"The downgrader, and the Snake Spirit King. I've found them now..." Zheng said to the others.</p>

  <p>However, this still wasn't what he was looking for.</p>

  <p>"The Snake Spirit King's coordinates..."</p>

  <p>In his state of omniscience, nothing in the Burial Land could remain secret to him. As long as Zheng thought about it, he would instantly get the answer.</p>

  <p>His mind was quickly directed to the bottom of a mountain. There, he saw the Snake Spirit King's coordinates, which were encased in an orb of black light. Additionally, a golden ring surrounded the black orb.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>Zheng shot a quick glance to the others and gave them a comforting nod before abruptly teleporting to the Snake Spirit King's coordinates.</p>

  <p>However, he did leave a replica of himself before he left.</p>

  <p>Shortly after, the Snake Spirit King set foot on the Pear Hill. His huge body slowly coiled up onto the peak. All the while, he hissed proudly. He didn't even bother to hide his complacency in his golden eyes as he revealed himself before everyone.</p>

  <p>"Panic, fear, and uneasiness," he exclaimed elatedly. "I feed off of your negative emotions!"</p>

  <p>What he said was true. The eyes of the Snake Goddess, Kincaid, Hilario, and everyone else were filled with anxiety. However, their uneasiness actually stemmed from fear that Zheng's movements would be found out.</p>

  <p>Whatever the case was, their panicked expressions worked like a charm to delude the proud Snake Spirit King.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King was so carried away that he couldn't be bothered to check if the Zheng before him was just a replica, nor did he even use his omniscient power to read their minds. He believed that everything was well under his control. Kincaid, Zheng, Hilario, and Itzel... None of them would be able to change anything. There was no longer any chance for these weaklings to turn the tide, he firmly believed.</p>

  <p>"My foolish daughter! Did things go as you wished?" the Snake Spirit King sneered, directing his forked tongue at Itzel.</p>

  <p>Standing at the corner of the jadeite platform, Itzel stared coldly at her father, disgust written all over her face. "Might I remind you, father," she snapped back, "Your wishes haven't been fulfilled, either. How pathetic!"</p>

  <p>"How dare you!"</p>

  <p>The fact that he failed to upgrade the world was a terrible blow to the Snake Spirit King's ego. Although he had already tried to accept it as fact, he still felt furious and embarrassed when Itzel pointed it out. Unable to suppress his anger, he opened his huge mouth in an attempt to swallow her whole.</p>

  <p>Kincaid, Hilario, and Tianming all immediately sprang into action, ready to strike back. However, before they could even get close, a strong, burly figure had already stepped forward.</p>

  <p>Before the Snake Spirit King could react, Geoffrey had closed in on him in a heartbeat and swung his large fist at the Snake Spirit King's body.</p>

  <p>Pop!</p>

  <p>A light muffled sound rang out, as though Geoffrey had hit a piece of cotton. However, the power that erupted from his blow was extremely terrifying.</p>

  <p>The huge body of the Snake Spirit King caved in upon impact, and the power even penetrated through his body. An energy wave strong enough to distort the space within tens of thousands of miles rippled out, influencing even the Troubled Creatures that had just set foot onto the primitive land. Despite them being so far away, these creatures were still blown away, losing their balance.</p>

  <p>Clatter!</p>

  <p>After the punch was landed, the Snake Spirit King's body instantly disintegrated into ashes.</p>

  <p>Everyone who had witnessed this scene was stunned into silence.</p>

  <p>After Geoffrey had returned from his long journey, he was known to have undergone a drastic change. Once when he had sparred with Tianming, his power had surprised everyone. However, he now displayed even greater power that was far beyond everyone's imagination.</p>

  <p>"Let me protect you all!"</p>

  <p>Geoffrey said with a smile as he waved his huge fist.</p>

  <p>After returning to the chaos, he hadn't yet used his strength to its full potential. His body was, after all, the strongest physical body in the Deep Space, and its power was so great that even he himself was startled. This great power boosted his confidence; he was a different person now.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>Moments later, a new Snake Spirit King appeared before them.</p>

  <p>He hissed in frustration, shooting an annoyed glance at Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>"I must admit, what a strong force! You really surprised me." Narrowing his eyes at Geoffrey, he continued, "But that doesn't matter, it won't make a difference. Do you really think you can defeat me?" He sneered disdainfully.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, Geoffrey materialized in front of him once more and punched him right on his forehead.</p>

  <p>His body was powerful enough to transcend the restraints of space. To a certain extent, his movements were beyond the Snake Spirit King's prediction, regardless of his omniscience.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King's body was once again blown to smithereens.</p>

  <p>However, what Geoffrey killed was only another avatar. As long as the Snake Spirit King wanted, he could create thousands of such avatars.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>Once the avatar was killed, the Snake Spirit King summoned a new one to take its place, which was then killed by Geoffrey again.</p>

  <p>It became an endless cycle of summoning and killing. This scene soon became too much for the others to take in.</p>

  <p>As they watched in awe, Kincaid and the rest did not try to interfere.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey's intentions were clear: he wanted to distract the Snake Spirit King with his incredible strength so that Zheng would have enough time to complete his mission.</p>

  <p>Speaking of Zheng, as Geoffrey continued to kill the Snake Spirit King's avatars, he had quietly appeared at the foot of a mountain, which was only several feet away from the Snake Spirit King's coordinates.</p>

  <p>Zheng frowned. He had planned to appear right in front of the coordinates.</p>

  <p>With his omnipotence, it should have been easy for him to achieve that.</p>

  <p>However, there was something special about the golden ring, which blocked him from doing so.</p>

  <p>Although his teleportation had been disturbed by the golden ring, this distance was close enough for him. Shrugging it off, he decided to proceed immediately.</p>

  <p>If the Snake Spirit King noticed something was amiss and tried to find out where Zheng was, his current location would immediately be exposed to his enemies. In fact, the Snake Spirit King only needed to check what the people on the jadeite platform were thinking to know what their plan was!</p>

  <p>"Destruction Extreme Form!"</p>

  <p>A circle of purple energy formed in front of Zheng, from which a spear quickly materialized...</p>

  <p>Grasping the spear firmly in his hand, he jabbed forward towards his target.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The long spear stabbed into the surface of the golden ring and made a harsh, crisp sound. The golden ring trembled, and several cracks appeared on its edge.</p>

  <p>"It's not destroyed? Oh no!"</p>

  <p id="top_29"><a id="p24158" class="calibre2"></a>Zheng had expected he would penetrate through the golden ring and shatter the coordinates in one blow. Never in his wildest dreams would he have imagined this ordinary-looking golden ring would withstand the Destruction Extreme Form energy!</p>

  <p>However, he quickly gathered his bearings. Withdrawing the long spear, he quickly landed another blow. Simultaneously, he summoned two replicas beside him.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, from the top of the mountain, the Snake Spirit King and the downgrader had all their attention focused on Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey's strong body was definitely something beyond their expectations, and consequently they had been caught off guard. It seemed Geoffrey's plan was working, as they had failed to shift their attention away from him.</p>

  <p>"This young man's body is incredibly strong. Moreover, I can feel that his soul is equally strong. If I wasn't connected to the Burial Land, I would be no match for him. Why is there such a powerful warrior in the primitive land? Is this a result of the Extreme Form energy?" the Snake Spirit King inquired.</p>

  <p>The downgrader shook his head. "He was the one who brought back the Heavenly Ring Staff. He must have obtained a great fortune in the Deep Space. Both his physical body and soul are the strongest in the Deep Space. It's normal that you are not a match for him."</p>

  <p>"It's a pity such strength will go to waste," the Snake Spirit King said complacently, a smile creeping on his face.</p>

  <p>"Don't slacken your vigilance. They've grasped the Extreme Form energies. It's not worth mentioning to me, but..." Before the downgrader could finish his sentence, his six pairs of eyes suddenly flashed with a red light, and uneasiness emanated from him.</p>
