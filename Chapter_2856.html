</p>

  <p>As its ruler, Luo Xiao influenced the Evolutionary Universe in almost all aspects.</p>

  <p>In order to protect the Evolutionary Universe, he had to transform it entirely, causing a number of disasters across its span.</p>

  <p>If Luo Xiao were to return, it would be a blessing for the hundreds of trillions of secondary creatures in the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>"Tell the other Supreme Lords and world lords that they are not allowed to disturb my master!" Wynn commanded.</p>

  <p>Master Feng pulled out a Roaring Token to follow Wynn's order.</p>

  <p>"The light ball is where the master of the Evolutionary Universe is to be reborn. No one is allowed to approach it. If anyone disobeys..." Master Feng paused here, thought for a moment, and then smiled as he said, "You will have to face the consequences."</p>

  <p>He knew that no one would dare to provoke the ruler and founder of the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>When his voice resounded through the universe, the creatures within it began to whisper and murmur to each other, causing a loud hum. A few Supreme Lords, who knew the truth, also learned something from this news.</p>

  <p>The colossal red light ball was continuously absorbing energy from the entire Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>No one could observe the change in the energy levels of the Evolutionary Universe, not even the Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>After all, Holy Beings had absolute authority over their universes.</p>

  <p>The red light ball was an independent world.</p>

  <p>At the center of this world, a human figure was coming into existence, quietly but surely.</p>

  <p>This human figure was not yet a living being or even just a body. But it had abundant levels of vitality and the power of its soul was irresistible.</p>

  <p>When the figure took a complete human shape, it would mean that Luo Xiao was finally reborn.</p>

  <p>In the center of the Murphy Universe was also a dark red light ball.</p>

  <p>Within this light ball was a complete human body; it belonged to Murphy, the Holy Being of the Mu Clan.</p>

  <p>Murphy's body was complete, and his consciousness fully aroused.</p>

  <p>It wouldn't be long before he emerged from the light ball.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had killed Murphy in the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>Murphy would never forget how Luo Zheng had controlled the True Demon Body.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if Nicholas has killed Luo Zheng and gotten the True Demon Body,"</p>

  <p>Murphy muttered to himself.</p>

  <p>The light ball was isolated from the outside world. He didn't know what was happening outside, which meant that he had no idea of Nicholas' death.</p>

  <p>At the speed which he was going, it would take him half a year to be reborn.</p>

  <p>The rate at which time flowed in the Murphy Universe was ten times faster than that in the divine land. If time were to be calculated according to the way in the divine land, he would only need about twenty days to revive.</p>

  <p>Other Holy Beings were also being reborn, just like Murphy. Clark, Zeke, and Jeremiah were absorbing the energy from their universes.</p>

  <p>Half a month later, the red light ball that covered Clark dissipated.</p>

  <p>He was the first Holy Being to be reborn.</p>

  <p>A countless number of secondary creatures of his universe gathered at his feet.</p>

  <p>They regarded him as the creator of the universe, and all the Supreme Lords and the world lords knelt before him, looking upon him with a pious expression.</p>

  <p>It was not often that secondary creatures got the chance to get in touch with the creator, especially in a perfect universe like Clark's.</p>

  <p>For them, the creator only existed in an illusory legend. But this time, they finally had the chance to see their creator's face.</p>

  <p>But Clark ignored all the secondary creatures that were bowing to him in worship. He looked at them witheringly, snorted rather coldly, and disappeared from the universe.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords and world lords froze, having no idea why the creator was so angry.</p>

  <p>The truth, however, was that Clark was not angry with the secondary creatures.</p>

  <p>He was angry because he had humiliated himself by being careless enough to have been burned to death by the red-eyed girl.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p id="top_2">The moment he was reborn, he went back to the Floating Island of the Tang Clan.</p>

  <p>"Where is Oscar? You better come here right now!" Clark roared angrily.</p>

  <p>At Clark's angry voice, Oscar used the Grand Teleportation and appeared before him.</p>

  <p>Oscar was a consummate True God, but he was much weaker than Walton and the others. This time, he had stayed on the Floating Island as the acting master.</p>

  <p>"Holy Emperor! You have come back from the Abyss Demon Region!</p>

  <p>Congratulations, Holy Emperor!" Oscar said, a big smile on his face.</p>

  <p>"Cut the crap! I was reborn in the universe!" Clark said furiously.</p>

  <p>Oscar was surprised and realized what had happened.</p>

  <p>Now that Nicholas was dead, many people on the Floating Islands speculated that maybe everyone belonging to the alliance of the powerful clans was wiped out. Now Clark's words had confirmed their conjecture.</p>

  <p>But fortunately for the Tang Clan, Clark's universe hadn't collapsed.</p>

  <p>"Tell me about what happened in the divine land recently. Has Holy Nicholas returned?" Clark asked.</p>

  <p>Oscar folded his hands together and said, "Holy Nicholas' universe has collapsed. I'm afraid he's already dead."</p>

  <p>"What?" Clark's eyes widened in disbelief. "What nonsense are you talking?"</p>

  <p>He hadn't seen what the Furnace of Dark and Light had caused.</p>

  <p>According to him, it didn't matter if Nicholas had truly been killed by Luo Zheng or Samuel. After all, Nicholas was a Holy Being and could be reborn.</p>

  <p>But now Oscar was telling him that Nicholas was dead! How could he believe that?</p>

  <p>At Clark's doubtful expression, Oscar hurried to explain, "I dare not talk nonsense. Holy Nicholas' universe really collapsed over a month ago."</p>

  <p>"How is it possible? Who could kill Holy Nicholas without launching a universe war?" Clark said disbelievingly, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>"Samuel returned later. He led his people to strip bare the Floating Island of the Dongfang Clan," Oscar added.</p>

  <p>"How dare he! How dare he plunder the Dongfang Clan!"</p>

  <p>These news were like thunderbolts raining down on him from a clear sky, making him angrier and angrier by the minute. He didn't know what had happened after he died, but only Samuel had returned. So it was natural for him to blame Samuel for it.</p>

  <p>He was about to impulsively set out to seek revenge.</p>

  <p>But Oscar stopped him by saying, "Please don't think of revenge, Holy Emperor. Samuel must have nothing to fear since he has dared to plunder the Dongfang Clan. I'm afraid that you will suffer if you go alone. How about we wait for the other Holy Beings?"</p>

  <p>Only Nicholas had died forever. The other Holy Beings of the alliance of the powerful clans were being reborn as they spoke and it wouldn't be long.</p>

  <p>Oscar's words calmed Clark down.</p>

  <p>Clark had died before Samuel's true identity was exposed. That was why he didn't know that Samuel was actually Gregorio, or why Samuel dared to plunder the Floating Island of the Dongfang Clan.</p>

  <p>Although Nicholas had died, the other Holy Beings of the alliance of the powerful clans hadn't.</p>

  <p>But what gave Samuel the courage to fight the Holy Beings? Perhaps he had something to rely on.</p>

  <p>Clark sighed. He was in no hurry. He could wait for the other Holy Beings to be reborn before he sought revenge.</p>
