<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Hayden had told Luo Zheng that catching three Truth Spiritual Swords meant that he had passed the test.</p>

  <p>And now, there was a fork in the path.</p>

  <p>Previously, after Rufus had caught four Truth Spiritual Swords, he had known that he couldn't catch the fifth one and had voluntarily withdrawn.</p>

  <p>"Should I go out?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng hesitated for a while. He didn't need to prove anything here.</p>

  <p>But the test might determine how far he would go on the Sunrest Tree, although Hayden hadn't told him clearly.</p>

  <p>Yan's face appeared in his mind.</p>

  <p>If Harold brought her into the Non-combat Zone, would she enter the core of the Sunrest Tree just like the disciples of powerful clans, or climb up through a divine city, step by step?</p>

  <p>As he thought this, Luo Zheng smiled and continued on his way.</p>

  <p>He had barely taken a step forward when more swords rose from both sides of the path and attacked him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng remained calm.</p>

  <p>Before he knew it, more swords came stabbing at him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng frowned. As he walked further and further along the path, the pain that the long swords brought to him seemed to intensify.</p>

  <p>This meant that the rest of the path would get more difficult with each stretch.</p>

  <p>The pain was unbearable, and directly affected the soul with the power of the array.</p>

  <p>After being stabbed several times, Luo Zheng's body leaned sideways, his eyes fixed on one particular long sword. With a gentle flick of his hand, he grabbed a Truth Spiritual Sword from among the swords.</p>

  <p>"It has been a painful experience, trying to get the fourth sword. And Hayden, only a mid-rank True God, had actually obtained nine Truth Spiritual Swords."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked at the path that extended into the distance, and saw the numerous swords on both sides. He knew that even if his ability to endure pain was extremely great, he would not be able to withstand it in the end.</p>

  <p>Outside the array...</p>

  <p>"He has gotten the fourth sword," said Hayden, as he looked at Luo Zheng in the array with a smile on his face.</p>

  <p>He had deliberately not made the rules clear.</p>

  <p>He hadn't given Luo Zheng the chance to stay in contact with others, nor had he allowed him to understand the rules.</p>

  <p>In fact, the result of taking three swords was the same as taking twenty-three ones.</p>

  <p>This was only a simple test, and the first round was only to make sure that most of the weak True Gods remained outside the Sunrest Tree.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng had known it beforehand, he would have left the array once he had obtained the third sword.</p>

  <p>"You're a person who likes challenges. However, getting swords like this won't last long," Hayden said, his voice low as he stared at Luo Zheng. He was expecting something from him.</p>

  <p>The two young masters from the Wang Clan were getting angrier by the minute as they watched the four Truth Spiritual Swords floating beside Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"He has gotten only four swords and his speed is too slow. It's not a big deal!" said Rudolf in a cold voice.</p>

  <p>But although Luo Zheng was slow, he did not choose to give up.</p>

  <p>Everyone watched Luo Zheng stop for a while.</p>

  <p>And then, he suddenly took a step forward and a step backward.</p>

  <p>He had captured one of the Truth Spiritual Swords in the array!</p>

  <p>"The fifth sword!"</p>

  <p>The three True Gods in white robes, who were in charge of the array, were stunned. They all looked at Hayden.</p>

  <p>"He has found the secret. I didn't teach him that," Hayden said excitedly.</p>

  <p>"He is such a shrewd guy!"</p>

  <p>Others might not know much about it, but Hayden knew it best.</p>

  <p>If one bore the pain forcibly in order to get the Truth Spiritual Swords, his soul wouldn't be able to bear the pain when he got to the sixth or the seventh sword. He would faint and be kicked out of the array like the first True God who had failed.</p>

  <p>There was a method that one had to figure out in order to catch more Truth Spiritual Swords.</p>

  <p>Back then, Hayden had had to go through a lot of tests in the array before he had gradually found out what the method was. But now, it seemed that Luo Zheng already figured it out in a short period of time.</p>

  <p>Inside the array, Luo Zheng rushed forward.</p>

  <p>He had observed the path closely and had found that it had a gap, a blind spot between the fourth sword and the fifth sword.</p>

  <p>This blind spot was narrow. But if Luo Zheng stood sideways in there, the long swords that were being shot from both sides of the path wouldn't be able to touch him.</p>

  <p>So after he had rushed into the area containing the fifth sword, he did not stop. Instead, he continued to run wild along the path and hid himself in the blind spot that connected the fifth and the sixth swords. He then quickly locked the Truth Spiritual Sword among the flying swords and found a way to return to the path, while grabbing the fifth Truth Spiritual Sword from the rain of swords.</p>

  <p>He walked back and forth on the path, but people outside the array only saw him take two steps forward and one step backward before he obtained a Truth Spiritual Sword.</p>

  <p>"Once again!"</p>

  <p>Now that he knew the method, Luo Zheng no longer had any scruples.</p>

  <p>The True Gods outside the array saw Luo Zheng move two steps forward and then a step back. And then, a Truth Spiritual Sword was buzzing into the air.</p>

  <p>His speed was amazing, to say the least.</p>

  <p>He had soon got seven swords.</p>

  <p>Eight!</p>

  <p>Nine!</p>

  <p>The three white-robed True Gods in charge of the array would usually test tens of thousands of True Gods a day.</p>

  <p>Among such a large number of True Gods being tested, there were always a number of amazingly talented people, and the three were now immune to this fact.</p>

  <p>But the more Truth Spiritual Swords the True Gods got, the slower their speed was.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, Luo Zheng's speed was increasing in an abnormal manner.</p>

  <p>What was more, the Truth Spiritual Swords weren't following Luo Zheng willingly in the illusion. Luo Zheng was holding them under his arms and they were wriggling, wanting to break free.</p>

  <p>"Why are these Truth Spiritual Swords rejecting him so strongly?"</p>

  <p>"That can't be true. The Truth Spiritual Swords don't have their own consciousness. They just have a little more Truth of Godly Way than ordinary treasures."</p>

  <p>"Could it be that different kinds of Truth of Godly Way repel each other? In other words, has this person practiced another kind of Truth of Godly Way?</p>

  <p>I've heard about this!"</p>

  <p>A True God in a white robe came to this conclusion.</p>

  <p>"That's impossible. You think too highly of him," another white-robed True God said, denying this theory unhesitatingly. "For the Truth Spiritual Swords to repel him, he has to cultivate another Truth of Godly Way to an extremely high level."</p>

  <p>There were very few True Gods in the divine land who were qualified enough to cultivate the Truth of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>A few True Gods of humble birth had cultivated the Truth of Godly Way by chance, but they usually knew just a few words. It was rare for even True Gods from powerful clans on the Floating Islands to cultivate the Truth of Godly Way to a certain level.</p>

  <p>"I have no idea either," another white-robed True God said, his eyes fixed on the array. "The man has gotten the fourteenth Truth Spiritual Sword! The city lord must be overjoyed."</p>

  <p>The fourteen Truth Spiritual Swords formed a fan and circled slowly around Luo Zheng as they groaned. It sounded like a bunch of swords groaning mournfully.</p>
