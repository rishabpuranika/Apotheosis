<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Fergus swung his gaze to Galen, eyes narrowed as he asked, "Do you know this brat?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I do!" Galen said, his eyes becoming hard and cold. "He's a new Flag Master. He had yet to even reach the Other Shore Realm when he passed the Sword Wall. He slaughtered my family under the Sword Wall."</p>

  <p>His voice had become a low growl.</p>

  <p>"Truly?"</p>

  <p>Fergus wasn't sure if he felt the urge to laugh or cry at the news that Zheng was just a mere Flag Master. "Usually, in cases such as this, a nobody like him would already be dead. Why then is he still living?"</p>

  <p>"Master Fergus, you don't understand. I have tried to find the perfect opportunity to kill him, but that day he was accompanied by a woman.</p>

  <p>Where she comes from or who she is, I don't know, but she seems to have some special background. The owner of the Truth Library even assisted her.</p>

  <p>On top of that, I was warned by the Dragon City's lead guard," Galen groused, a scowl firmly in place.</p>

  <p>After that particular incident, he had decided not to take any action against Zheng.</p>

  <p>He didn't fear Zheng, not at all, but he was wary of that woman. He knew better than to offend her in any way and risk her rage.</p>

  <p>"And what is so special about this woman?" Fergus questioned with a single brow raised.</p>

  <p>Galen felt his heart stutter in his chest, and he just barely refrained from rubbing it to help alleviate the discomfort.</p>

  <p>He might be afraid of the woman, but Fergus was different.</p>

  <p>The man had lived in the Dragon City for many years, and had refused the entrance test of Oneness Guards each time. He'd only been here to handle the Sword-reading Liquid business for someone in the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>It was common knowledge of how powerful one had to be to craft the Sword-reading Liquid.</p>

  <p>No matter how powerful an Alliance Chief believed themselves to be, they wouldn't dare to speak or act arrogantly in front of Fergus. Everyone within the Dragon City walked on eggshells around the man.</p>

  <p>Zheng would not stand a chance against Fergus, Galen was sure.</p>

  <p>Galen spoke once more to Fergus. "No matter the woman's identity and what she can do, she cannot compare to you, Master Fergus. This one called Zheng is particularly hateful."</p>

  <p>Fergus glanced at Galen and said indifferently, "Do not try to woo your way into me dealing with the little cretin!"</p>

  <p>All the Alliance Chiefs were cunning and quick witted. It was easy for them to see the hidden intent behind Galen's words. He wished to kill Zheng with a borrowed blade.</p>

  <p>Galen huffed a laugh. "I apologize, Master Fergus. It's just that I want this brat killed, but I am unable to do so." The others were surprised at his honesty.</p>

  <p>Fergus showed no reaction to the statement. "I'm in a terrible mood today, Ioan. Let us call it a day." He turned to walk away, but cast a quick glance over his shoulder. "I will relieve Zheng of his life before night falls. If you would lead the way, Galen."</p>

  <p>When night began to blanket the Dragon City, the wilderness became teeming with people.</p>

  <p>Among the people, the Flag Masters were preparing and searching for the best places to position the flagpoles.</p>

  <p>At the same time as the preparations, Beldene and Faegan were slowly waking up, the wounds on their bodies healed. Nothing but a subtle soreness ailed them now. They listened intently to what had happened, and when Beldene learned Zheng had avenged them, he couldn't help the worry that flitted across his face.</p>

  <p>Beldene was a naturally cautious man. When he had begun to sell the Sword-reading Liquid, he knew there would be conflicts with the other sellers, so he had to inquire about them secretly.</p>

  <p>He was fully aware that Fergus was not a man to be trifled with, and that Zheng should stay clear of him.</p>

  <p>If he hadn't been unconscious, he would have attempted to stop Zheng from avenging them. However, he did not expect to wake up and learn that Zheng had already destroyed Fergus' shop.</p>

  <p>"Flag Master, you were much too reckless this time."</p>

  <p>Of course, he was moved by what Zheng had done, but the consequences of his actions were going to prove to be too steep. This would send Zheng into the abyss.</p>

  <p>Faegan, though, did not give a damn about the consequences. "How could you say that? Our Flag Master did it for us! Besides, they needed to learn a valuable lesson," he said, nodding his head as if that was a fact.</p>

  <p>"You know nothing!" Beldene replied harshly.</p>

  <p>Assessing Beldene's worried expression, Zheng simply smiled. "Do not worry so, just rest. I know what I am doing. And besides, Faegan may not be that smart, but he's right. If we had made a concession, they would have bullied us further."</p>

  <p>Beldene remained silent, trying not to let the worry consume him.</p>

  <p>Everything was lively and energized outside Zheng's territory. They all knew that Fergus would not let the destruction of his shop go, and some people had a faint guess as to what would happen tonight.</p>

  <p>The setting sun seemed to be washed in crimson, drawing out the hulking shadow of the Dragon City.</p>

  <p>Shrouded in the shadow, a group of more than ten people could be seen leaving the city and flying into the wilderness.</p>

  <p>Galen could not believe the turn of events. He was elated. After sending away Ioan, he was able to become an Alliance Chief, and to top it all off, Fergus was going to kill Zheng for him.</p>

  <p>Within the first few hundred miles of the wilderness, flagpoles were densely packed into the earth. Most of the people were already preparing for their cultivation once night fell. Their curiosity was piqued by Fergus, accompanied by other Alliance Chiefs, as they flew past them.</p>

  <p>"Alliance Chiefs can insert their flagpoles into the ground near the Dragon City, so why have they come so far out?"</p>

  <p>"Didn't you hear about what happened today?"</p>

  <p>"Whatever it is, someone is in a lot of trouble."</p>

  <p>Within the Dragon City, it was peaceful, and acts of violence were strictly prohibited. Out here in the wilderness though, the rules of the city did not apply. No one would bat an eye at murder out here.</p>

  <p>"There," Galen said, directing Fergus' attention to the flag with "Luo" embroidered on it. "That is where the brat should be." The corner of his lips curled into a vicious grin.</p>

  <p>Fat body shuttling through the air, it did not take long for Fergus to be over Zheng's territory. "Who is  Zheng Luo?" he shouted coldly.</p>

  <p>The voice drew Monica's attention, and she turned her face to the sky to see Fergus. Her heart sank into her stomach at the sight.</p>

  <p>The rumor that Fergus would seek revenge for the smallest grievance proved to be true.</p>

  <p>Her gaze traveled to the man standing beside Fergus. It was Walter. A thought occurred to her and she rushed forward before Zheng could get to them.</p>

  <p>It was not until Monica followed Walter that she got her current status. She wanted to ask Walter to put in a good word for Zheng. She said, "Alliance Chief Walter, this is probably a misunderstanding. Zheng is a newcomer. He doesn't know about the rules."</p>

  <p>Her boldness embarrassed Walter. He knew that nothing would convince Fergus to be rid of his anger and turn away, and he knew if he suggested anything, he would offend him. So he acted as if he hadn't heard Monica.</p>

  <p>"Who do you think you are to speak to us? Fuck off!"</p>

  <p>Fergus bellowed. An invisible force accompanied his voice and crashed into Monica, sending her to the ground as if under a massive weight.</p>

  <p>"Flag Master Monica!"</p>

  <p>"Flag Master!"</p>

  <p>Monica's followers cried out, horrified at the scene before them.</p>

  <p>As a Grand Flag Master, she was not weak. Monica proved her strength by struggling to her feet, panting through the pain.</p>

  <p>"How are you still alive?" Fergus was shocked that this woman could withstand his attack. His knuckles cracked as he clenched his fist, and swung towards her.</p>

  <p>The invisible force came barreling towards her again, and she knew her body might get pulverized into dust this time.</p>

  <p>Before the attack made contact with her, a figure stepped up to her side.</p>

  <p>There was a muffled clang that rang throughout the sky. It seemed as if Fergus' attack had struck a steel wall.</p>

  <p>Zheng couldn't help the slight smirk that shook the corner of his lips. It was easy to block the attack.</p>

  <p>Galen cursed silently in his head before pointing out to Fergus that the man was in fact Zheng.</p>

  <p>Fergus sized up his opponent, a moment of surprise flickering in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"You are Zheng? Tell me, where did you get the Sword-reading Liquid?"</p>

  <p>Fergus wasn't just here to kill Zheng. He needed to know the origin of the Sword-reading Liquid they had.</p>

  <p>He had helped someone sell the Sword-reading Liquid. One would assume he was quite rich, but the fact of the matter was, ninety-nine percent of his income had fallen into that person's pocket. If there was a cheaper way to obtain Sword-reading Liquid, he wanted to know.</p>

  <p>Zheng ignored the question for now, bending closer to Monica to make sure she was okay. The blow had not been too powerful, but still caused a lot of damage. Her bones were broken and her elixir field was messed up. He was just glad she had survived.</p>

  <p>He gently put a pill into her mouth before turning to Fergus with a cold glare. "You want to know where I got the Sword-reading Liquid?" he scoffed. "If you roll along the ground and make it to the entrance of the Dragon City, I'll tell you."</p>
