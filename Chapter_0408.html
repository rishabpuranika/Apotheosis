</p>

  <p>"Vale is so powerful... But Luo Luo Zheng has innate superhuman strength. We have seen how strong he was previously. But now Vale is using only one of his fingers and he has successfully pinned Luo Luo Zheng in the crater. That guy isn't human, I am telling you!" One disciple remarked in awe.</p>

  <p>"Don't say such nonsense if you don't understand what is going on!"</p>

  <p>Another disciple beside him rebuked. The he continued with a pause,</p>

  <p>"One finger? Do you think Vale can press Luo Luo Zheng and make him not stand up only with one finger? Is Vale a supernatural being? The force pressing on Luo Zheng's body is not Vale's strength. He is using the white lotus under his feet to change the gravity distribution of the fighting court! In other words, Luo Luo Zheng has been pressed by the gravity of the whole fighting court!"</p>

  <p>"Even if what you say is true, it would take immense amount of skills on Vale's part to do it. Both of them are outstanding warriors. With his powerful strength, Luo Luo Zheng can still stand up once again. If I were Luo Luo Zheng, I probably have been crushed into dust..." The first disciple sighed.</p>

  <p>While other disciples were discussing and murmuring, Luo Luo Zheng didn't panic at all. Although he had been pressed into the crater again and again, he had been able to stand up every time successfully. Actually the gravity on him could not hurt him at all. On the contrary, his body was growing stronger under the high pressure as the warmth inside his body revitalized his power! So Luo Luo Zheng remained calm and was not worried at all.</p>

  <p>It just looked like he was in a very awkward position for the time being.</p>

  <p>In Luo Zheng's eyes, appearances didn't matter. The most important thing was to make his body stronger and win the fight in the end!</p>

  <p>Vale, at the same time, was also patient.</p>

  <p>Previously he had been chided by Luo Luo Zheng and he felt humiliated. Now, he just wanted Luo Luo Zheng to lose his face for a longer time. In this way he could let other disciples see that Luo Luo Zheng was not qualified to be his opponent at all! He felt pleased at this moment and hoped that this could last as long as possible.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, didn't you always boast that you were very powerful? Didn't you think I was not qualified to be your opponent?. Why then, can't you compete against my single finger?" Vale asked in an ironical tone and an arrogant smile appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>But to be honest, his remark that Luo Luo Zheng couldn't compete against his single finger was exaggerated. After all, to maintain such a strong gravity was not a piece of cake for Vale himself. However, he was still very pleased to see Luo Luo Zheng pinned down horribly!</p>

  <p>When Vale felt happy, he forgot that he had actually regarded Luo Luo Zheng as tiny as an ant. It was not a great achievement to defeat an ant. Now he was feeling happy to gain the upper hand in the fight against Luo Luo Zheng. This meant that in his mind, Luo Luo Zheng at least had the strength to compete with him and he had regarded Luo Luo Zheng as his opponent.</p>

  <p>He seemed to have completely forgotten the fact that Luo Luo Zheng was only at grade two of the nature level.</p>

  <p>"Bang, bang, bang..."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stood up again and again, and was crushed into the earth every time.</p>

  <p>"Don't you have an extraordinary flying knife? Why not use it?" Vale sneered while keeping the motion of his fingers constant.</p>

  <p>"You can attack with soul, can't you? Why don't you use that power?</p>

  <p>I thought you were strong. But now you are just so so. Do you still remember the big words you so proudly uttered a moment ago?"</p>

  <p>Vale sneered while he kept his pressure towards Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Now the other disciples started another discussion that if  Luo Luo Zheng possessed other methods of attack!</p>

  <p>"He actually has a weapon! A flying knife? He hasn't used it since the very beginning!" a disciple said.</p>

  <p>"According to Vale, Luo Luo Zheng seems to have the ability of attacking with soul.</p>

  <p>But attacking others' soul is a difficult skill even to a warrior at the Illuminating Soul Realm, isn't it? How come Luo Luo Zheng can do that? He is only at grade two of the nature level! Luo Luo Zheng is really powerful beyond our imagination!" a second disciple answered.</p>

  <p>Some disciples turned vigilant. It they could know the attacking method of Luo Luo Zheng, they could do something in advance and get themselves ready for that attack once they had the chance to fight against Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Vale had said these things deliberately. He wanted to discover all the secrets that Luo Luo Zheng had. He hated him for everything he had said just now.</p>

  <p>Being one of the most powerful personal disciples, how could he be scolded by an inner disciple like that?!</p>

  <p>Even Wing and Sheeny dare not do that, let alone someone as puny as Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng walked out of the crater once again, and smiled. There wasn't a trace of panic on his face. "You are right about one thing. I am not strong enough. But I am not as weak as you are. Did you just count on the gravity to defeat me? You will be surely disappointed!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng bounded up to his feet, and at the same time he began to dodge and avoid Vale's finger, which was responsible for the gravity redistribution.</p>

  <p>"Boom..."</p>

  <p>Vale pointed with his finger again but all he got was a disappearing Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The huge gravity made another crater in the ground but it was in vain.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had moved faster than Vale could react.</p>

  <p>Vale couldn't believe what was happening. He pointed towards Luo Luo Zheng again. And the same thing happened every time he did.</p>

  <p>"Boom..."</p>

  <p>"Boom..."</p>

  <p>"Boom..."</p>

  <p>As Vale pointed in different directions, the big craters appeared one after the other. Soon, the whole fighting court became completely uneven.</p>

  <p>Now, it looked more like a construction field than an arena.</p>

  <p>While the disciples were amazed at their fighting, Luo Zheng's Sword Step had become extremely fast. But since he had hidden his sword intent, his Sword Step could not be used to attack his opponent like Tianming's.</p>

  <p>Vale was a stout opponent, but Luo Luo Zheng had other powerful rivals too. On the way to the top of All Peak Competition, there would be more than one tough competitors for him, so he had to preserve his secrets to the last moment.</p>

  <p>"Is that all you can do? Escape? You are a coward!" Vale shouted to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, he didn't stop tracking Luo Luo Zheng and still kept using his skill of Flower-Picking Pointing.</p>

  <p>But this time, just as he released the force by one finger, Luo Luo Zheng suddenly became twice as fast as he already was. He jumped highly towards Vale and the six demonic phantoms also ran at him. They had been waiting for a long time on the fighting platform. Luo Luo Zheng, together with his six demonic phantoms, was trying to surround Vale in a circle.</p>

  <p>"Oh I can do more than just running away!" Luo Luo Zheng finally graced Vale with a reply. In a mere second, Luo Luo Zheng had arrived closely to Vale with a slight smile.</p>

  <p>His giant fist of life vitality suddenly formed and pushed towards Vale swiftly!</p>
