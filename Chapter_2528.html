<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2528 Kill A Wild God </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The girl in bright red robe blinked her eyes repeatedly. "Well, you'd better take out the blood red wild bone obediently," she said. "My brother is kind-hearted and will spare your life!"</p>

  <p>The young girl and the young man had realized that Zheng seemed to be a True God, not a Wild God.</p>

  <p>In this world, True Gods were not the mainstream. In order to obtain some theurgies, some Wild Gods might open up an inner world to cultivate, but they mainly cultivated Wild God Power. All the other cultivation methods they practiced were only auxiliary methods.</p>

  <p>It was rare to see people like Zheng, who only cultivated in the True God Realm.</p>

  <p>So, they didn't take Zheng's cultivation or strength seriously.</p>

  <p>"Really?" Zheng smiled faintly as he still held his temper.</p>

  <p>He tried not to get himself into trouble in such a strange place.</p>

  <p>Then he showed off a small smile. Just then, a powerful force was released from his legs, and his body immediately shot backwards.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>As he was moving backward, Zheng flew at high speed on the Immemorial Wilderness.</p>

  <p>The girl and the man were not expecting Zheng to escape. All of them were stunned, and a trace of hostility appeared on the young man's face. "How dare he! Nobody has ever run away in front of me. What a joke..."</p>

  <p>"Hoo, hoo, Hoo..."</p>

  <p>Within seconds, the young man's body shone a bright yellow light, and his body began to increase in size very rapidly.</p>

  <p>One hundred feet...</p>

  <p>One thousand feet...</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, he turned into a giant of five thousand feet tall.</p>

  <p>Right after growing so big, he rushed straight towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>Even though he was already so huge, he even became faster than Zheng.</p>

  <p>The girl looked towards the direction of Zheng and sighed helplessly. "This guy is so stupid. If he has just taken out the wild bone, he could have survived. Now, he's annoyed my senior fellow apprentice. How in the world is he going to survive?"</p>

  <p>Just like that, the girl flew upwards with the two guards behind her.</p>

  <p>As Zheng flew away with the young man tailed behind him, they were moving extremely fast, travelling a hundred miles within seconds.</p>

  <p>The aura released by the young man behind Zheng was already very intimidating, and when the Wights that were crawling on the ground felt this aura, their faces were all stained with fear. Almost all of them ran away.</p>

  <p>"He's huge! How could he manage to move so quickly?" Zheng frowned.</p>

  <p>To his surprise, he wasn't able to shake the guy off as quickly as he wanted.</p>

  <p>And worse, the distance between them was growing closer and closer.</p>

  <p>At first, Zheng had been able to keep a distance of over ten miles from that young man, but now the young man had quietly reached behind him.</p>

  <p>"It's useless to escape," the man behind him exclaimed in a cold voice.</p>

  <p>"You will die all the same. Why waste all your efforts?"</p>

  <p>He flipped his palm and slapped at Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>The young man was several thousand feet tall, and compared to him, Zheng was as small as a mosquito. How could Zheng escape?</p>

  <p>"Humph!"</p>

  <p>Zheng let out a fierce groan, a strong desire to kill beginning to flash in his eyes.</p>

  <p>He was holding back to avoid any trouble, but he wasn't afraid of this man at all.</p>

  <p>As Zheng's figure flipped in the air, the Shadow Bearing Sword was unsheathed almost instantly.</p>

  <p>"Clink!" came a clear, melodious sound of a sword as he drew it out...</p>

  <p>A ray of slender sword radiance shot out. The sword was emitting a cyan light shaped like a long arc, almost like a crescent moon.</p>

  <p>For some reason, the young man wasn't threatened at all.</p>

  <p>In this world of the Wild Gods, the only way to defeat the enemy was to possess a very strong, skillful physical body. For him, it was ridiculous for a fellow who only cultivated in the True God Realm to attack.</p>

  <p>Though he did have a feeling that the sword radiance was somewhat powerful, he was not on full alert.</p>

  <p>For him, one slap could send the sword radiance into pieces and if that wasn't enough, then he'd just have to slap him again.</p>

  <p>But this time, the young man found himself wrong.</p>

  <p>When his palm came into contact with the sword light, a terrible pain rushed up through him.</p>

  <p>His huge hand became weak as the sword's light devoured it. A huge crack began to form across his palm, and when half of the palm was directly cut off, it fell hard towards the ground.</p>

  <p>"This is..." The young man could hardly believe his eyes.</p>

  <p>Zheng seemed like nothing to him, so how was his sword so terrifyingly powerful?</p>

  <p>As the young man was in a daze, Zheng had already rushed towards the sky.</p>

  <p>He wasn't afraid, though. Zheng ran away because he wanted to avoid a fight. However, now that he had made his move, he wouldn't let his opponent go.</p>

  <p>Even if Zheng wanted to let the other one go, the latter would think he was a coward and kept chasing him!</p>

  <p>After a few moments, Zheng flew up along the young man's arm, which was over a thousand feet long. He had managed to ascend so quickly, reaching to a height of more than four thousand feet.</p>

  <p>Being so high up, he had no expressions in his eyes. As the Shadow Bearing Sword emitted a faint cyan light, an indescribable power began to condense right in the palm of his hand.</p>

  <p>"Ways-blending Strike! Die!"</p>

  <p>The moment he turned around, the Ways-blending Energy that had been building up in his inner world burst out in one go.</p>

  <p>After all his years of practice, Zheng's cultivation had been greatly improved and he had become a top-rank True God. Moreover, he had the Shadow Bearing Sword, and this made him somewhat unstoppable. He was more powerful than when he was at the debate venue.</p>

  <p>That cyan crescent shaped sword light shot out with a powerful energy surging through. This strike was more than a hundred times more powerful than Zheng's first strike, and it was released so quickly that it was impossible for his opponent to react.</p>

  <p>As the young man was trying to regain his consciousness, the crescent shaped sword light quietly swept across his neck.</p>

  <p>The young man stared blankly at Zheng not far away, his huge body standing still...</p>

  <p>Soon, his head, which was as huge as a mountain, slid sideways and rolled down from his neck.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>The man's head smashed against the ground, leaving a big crater against the surface...</p>

  <p>The body, on the other hand, swayed back and forth before collapsing just the same.</p>

  <p>In the air more than four thousand feet high, Zheng was floating in the air, gasping for air as his chest rose and fell.</p>

  <p>To his surprise, it was easier to get rid of the guy than he had expected.</p>

  <p>For him, it was actually easier to kill a Wild God than to kill a True God, because the life force of a Wild God just came from their body.</p>

  <p>If he was fighting a True God, losing a head wouldn't have been a fatal problem.</p>

  <p>For a True God, the truly fatal injury was if their souls were destroyed, or if their elixir fields were broken. Because Wild Gods depended largely on their bodies, they'd immediately die as soon as they were physically harmed.</p>

  <p>"Ah!"</p>

  <p>At this moment, a scream echoed faintly from the distance: It was from the girl in red robe.</p>

  <p>The girl and the two guards realized that they had overestimated the young man's strength, so they had followed him quietly as he battled Zheng. In their eyes, the young man could kill Zheng in the blink of an eye, and the latter probably wouldn't have the chance to escape.</p>

  <p>Little did they know, the young man was fated to get beheaded by Zheng, someone they thought to be weak.</p>

  <p>They didn't even witness how the young man's neck was cut off.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>As the body lay on the ground, Strong Wild God Power escaped it as it rapidly shrank down to normal size. Within a few seconds, it became the size of Zheng once again.</p>

  <p>"You, you, you..." The girl stared at Zheng in fear, her face full of disbelief.</p>

  <p>But the fright in her voice was not for Zheng, but from seeing the young man's death. "You actually killed him! Do you have any idea who he is?!"</p>
