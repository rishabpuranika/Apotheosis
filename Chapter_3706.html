<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3706 The Reborn Usman </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>This evil creature was born in a human tribe in the Jade Law Province.</p>

  <p>The Jade Law Province used to belong to the Nine Li race but after the race was destroyed, it fell under the control of the Bearing race.</p>

  <p>Ninety percent of the province's population was comprised of humans.</p>

  <p>Shortly after their occupation of the Jade Law Province, the Bearing race conducted a ruthless purge within the province.</p>

  <p>Those who remained loyal to the Nine Li race were exterminated and any news about the Nine Li race was completely blocked and prohibited.</p>

  <p>In time, any trace of the Nine Li race was thoroughly erased and the people of the Jade Law Province completely shifted their loyalties to the Bearing race. Of course, the shifting of loyalties came after the realization that they had no choice but to accept the Bearing race as their new leaders.</p>

  <p>The past few days were literal hell as the temperature in the entire Jade Law Province constantly soared. The scorching sun seemed determined to evaporate every last drop of water in the land and the air was thick with heat and irritation over the entire province.</p>

  <p>Somewhere within Peace City was the city lord's mansion and in it, a baby was born.</p>

  <p>This was a moment of great joy for city lord Paxton Zhou but the moment his child was birthed, he heard a shrill scream.</p>

  <p>Concerned about the safety of his wife and child, he hurriedly rushed into the delivery room.</p>

  <p>He was not prepared for the sight that awaited him.</p>

  <p>His wife lay dead in a pool of blood while several midwives were horrifyingly beheaded. On the floor was a naked baby.</p>

  <p>The appearance of his child stunned him.</p>

  <p>Judging from the baby's initial appearance, it was undoubtedly human.</p>

  <p>However, the two short horns on his head made him look like a fiend.</p>

  <p>This fiendish baby giggled and waved his little, bloody hand towards Paxton Zhou as if to proudly tell him that yes, he was the one who killed all these people.</p>

  <p>Paxton Zhou felt a shiver run down his back at the sight of his supposed son's evil smile.</p>

  <p>He shook his head in denial and tried to make sense of it all.</p>

  <p>"This is impossible!" he murmured under his breath. "My son wouldn't do this! You are not my son!"</p>

  <p>He was an outstanding warrior in the Jade Law Province. At the young age of over thirty, he was able to reach the Other Shore Realm and become the city lord of Peace City, which was a very extraordinary feat.</p>

  <p>How could this terrible devastation happen to his wife and child?</p>

  <p>As soon as he came to his senses, Paxton Zhou immediately unsheathed his saber.</p>

  <p>This was not his son, but a monster from hell! Thus, killing this devil child was justified.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>A wild saber intent was released, ready to hack away at the baby's head.</p>

  <p>The power contained within this strike was over a hundred divine megatons, enough to defeat a considerably powerful enemy!</p>

  <p>Not many people in the entire Jade Law Province could resist an attack from Paxton Zhou and this newborn was no exception.</p>

  <p>Or so he thought.</p>

  <p>As the saber shadow approached him, the baby smiled. There was no trace of fear in his face as he stretched out his chubby hand towards the oncoming attack.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>Instead of being beheaded, the baby grabbed the saber and halted his father's attack!</p>

  <p>To say Paxton Zhou was shocked would be an understatement.</p>

  <p>Even if this child was truly a fiend, he was only a newborn. How in the world was he able to resist such a powerful attack?!</p>

  <p>"Creak!"</p>

  <p>A strong force emanated from the baby as he actually bent the huge saber with his small hand!</p>

  <p>A great sense of crisis immediately overwhelmed Paxton Zhou.</p>

  <p>He didn't know what was going on but he knew that if he let this baby live, it could spell chaos and destruction for the entire Source World!</p>

  <p>He immediately let go of his saber and rushed towards the baby instead.</p>

  <p>There was only one way to go about this and that was to end this fiend's life!</p>

  <p>If he couldn't use his saber then Paxton Zhou would rely on his fists!</p>

  <p>Normally, a person would be averse to punching an actual baby. His smooth and milky skin would no doubt deter any malicious thought upon him but the aura he emanated was so malicious that Paxton Zhou had no problems not holding back his attack.</p>

  <p>Just as his fist was about a few inches away, an innocent smile broke through the baby's face and Paxton Zhou felt his mind bombarded by sharp, unbearable pain. There was a scream moments before blood spurted out of his orifices and his head exploded.</p>

  <p>With his enemy dead, the baby let out a victorious smile and slowly began to crawl out of the delivery room.</p>

  <p>Paxton Zhou's scream attracted the guards' attention and all of them rushed towards the delivery room.</p>

  <p>Upon arrival, they saw the baby crawling his way out of the bloody chamber, much to their confusion.</p>

  <p>As they stared at the baby, he looked up and gave them a mysterious smile.</p>

  <p>Puff puff puff puff puff…</p>

  <p>There was no time for them to run as their heads suddenly exploded and filled the mansion with even more bloodshed.</p>

  <p>Their deaths attracted even more guards along with a few famous masters at the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>Of course, the result remained the same. Any person who caught sight of the baby met only one end: with their heads exploded.</p>

  <p>All one thousand and eleven people that resided in the mansion died that day.</p>

  <p>But the baby was not done with his bloodshed. As he ventured out onto the gates, he crossed paths with various people. All of them shot him strange, panicked looks and why wouldn't they? He was an infant completely covered in blood with eyes that glowed strangely.</p>

  <p>Puff puff puff puff puff...</p>

  <p>One smile, and that was all it took for all of them to die.</p>

  <p>A day passed and the originally bustling Peace City became eerily quiet with nothing but dead bodies.</p>

  <p>The seemingly innocent baby was now on his way out of the city gates.</p>

  <p>However, just as he was about to cross the threshold, a thin figure appeared in front of him. It was Yellow Thearch!</p>

  <p>He instinctively resisted this figure and a cautious look plastered all over his face. He suddenly knitted his tiny brows and launched an explosive attack towards Yellow Thearch's head.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>There was a loud sound as Yellow Thearch took the blow but, unlike all the previous victims, his head remained whole and his expression remained unchanged.</p>

  <p>A trace of anger appeared on the baby's face as he continued his barrage of attacks in an effort to blow up Yellow Thearch's head.</p>

  <p>"Bang, bang, Bang..."</p>

  <p>For some reason, no matter how hard the baby tried, Yellow Thearch remained unyielding nor did he make any effort to fight back. In fact, there was a trace of tenderness in his eyes when he looked at the small infant.</p>

  <p>To the baby's horror, Yellow Thearch bent down and picked him up in his arms.</p>

  <p>What could've been seen as a gentle act was actually anything but. Yellow Thearch's hold contained an irresistible force.</p>

  <p>The baby was effectively restrained by the powerful being. "What's your name?" Yellow Thearch asked.</p>

  <p>Nobody in their right mind would ask a baby a question and expect an answer, but then again this was no ordinary baby. Not only did Yellow Thearch expect an answer from him, but his tone also held a trace of authority that allowed no retorts.</p>

  <p>There was a momentary trace of hesitation on the baby's face but Yellow Thearch insisted.</p>

  <p>"Tell me."</p>

  <p>Realizing that there was no dodging the powerful being's query, the baby babbled for a few seconds before answering. "My name is Usman..."</p>

  <p>The corners of Yellow Thearch's mouth curled up in a smile. "Very good."</p>

  <p>He was not surprised to hear that.</p>

  <p>The Usman that previously existed belonged to the Black Ship and was killed in the hands of Yellow Thearch and a few other people. However, someone like Usman, who was the incarnation of all negative emotions of the Source World, could not really die. So long as resentment and hate remained and accumulated to a certain level, he would be reborn infinitely.</p>

  <p>"From now on, you will be the boy of our Bearing race!" Yellow Thearch declared.</p>

  <p>As he said that, he tightened his grip onto the baby and walked into the void, leaving behind a dead city with headless corpses.</p>
