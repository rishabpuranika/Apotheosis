<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>No matter who it was, anyone who heard such arrogant words would feel extremely displeased.</p>

  <p>Shania phrased her words like a warning, but it was actually a blatant provocation.</p>

  <p>The atmosphere in the Ji Clan immediately became heated.</p>

  <p>Their discussions, curses, and roars were almost enough to lift the roof of the grand hall beneath the picture.</p>

  <p>"This slut seems to specialize in the Life Law!" "She is the Godly Genius of the Demon Night. What sort of Godly Way does she cultivate?"</p>

  <p>"How dare this nobody talk to Lucille in such a tone? Does she really think so highly of herself?"</p>

  <p>"Lucille is not weak. Before joining the Illusion Battlefield, she brought Lucy into the altar to cultivate the Five-element Reincarnation. Even if she fights with Nathan, the battle would be a draw. So how dare this bitch be so arrogant?"</p>

  <p>The Ji Clan had pinned all their hopes on Lucille.</p>

  <p>Even though her Lotus Flower had not fully bloomed yet, the achievements she would make after becoming a Godly Genius would definitely not pale in comparison with the achievements of Nathan or Lawson.</p>

  <p>The Ji Clan might be just one of the four clans in the Thoughtless Minds, but even without the other clans, it was a force to be reckoned with.</p>

  <p>How could they tolerate this woman stamping on their pride?</p>

  <p>Even the patriarch of the Ji Clan, who was standing behind the crowd, had a stern expression on his face as he stared fixedly at the picture.</p>

  <p>Lucille's temper began to flare up. There was a flash of killing intent in her intimidating eyes when she heard Shania's words.</p>

  <p>However, the killing intent only flashed slightly and quickly faded away.</p>

  <p>Then, her eyes became as cold as ice.</p>

  <p>As the ace talent of the Ji Clan, her mental state had to be absolutely steady.</p>

  <p>She couldn't be daunted just because of a few words from Shania.</p>

  <p>After thinking for a while, Lucille said blandly, "There are trillions of warriors participating in this competition to rule the world of chaos.</p>

  <p>Almost all of the warriors at the Soul Sea Realm have participated…</p>

  <p>Some of them became cannon fodder and were slaughtered at will. Some were used as stepping stones for others to reach higher. Most of them could only prove their determination in martial arts in life and death situations.</p>

  <p>Everyone has their own goals, and I carry the hopes of the Ji Clan! Since I've already reached this stage, I don't mind climbing up one more step.</p>

  <p>Why should I admit defeat?"</p>

  <p>Lucille's voice was clear and cold.</p>

  <p>After she finished her words, the sound of clapping came from afar.</p>

  <p>It was coming from Zheng.</p>

  <p>Hearing the applause, Lucille calmly turned around with a smile on her face, a smile that she hadn't shown for a long time. Her smile was like a plum blossom blooming in the snow, cheering up anyone who saw it.</p>

  <p>"The child from the Ji Clan is indeed courageous." The elegant smile on Shania's face faded and her face darkened. "Since that's the case, don't say that I didn't warn you..."</p>

  <p>After she finished speaking, the bright red petals of the rose in her hand instantly disintegrated and turned into fine powder.</p>

  <p>The very next moment, the snowflakes that were falling slowly behind Lucille thickened.</p>

  <p>As the wind whirled, heavy snowfall swept across the entire Heaven Earth Board.</p>

  <p>The atmosphere had suddenly become tense.</p>

  <p>Knowing that she had to stay one step ahead, Lucille made the first move.</p>

  <p>Although she had already stabilized her state of mind, she didn't want to underestimate her opponent.</p>

  <p>She knew that Shania's strength had to be extraordinary. The woman was a Godly Genius born in an almost perfect race. How could she possibly be weak?</p>

  <p>At this moment, the Five-element Finger Chain in her hand flashed with a colorful light. At the same time, a pair of swords appeared in her hands!</p>

  <p>These swords were only half the length of an ordinary sword and had serrated blades. They were usually used by assassins.</p>

  <p>After the pair of swords landed in her hands, Lucille immediately charged straight at Shania!</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…</p>

  <p>As Lucille dashed forward, her figure was constantly flashing.</p>

  <p>It was as if several Lucilles were dashing forward at the same time, but it was difficult to tell which one her real body was with a single glance.</p>

  <p>Shania slightly raised her thick eyebrows as a smile appeared on her face. However, she remained motionless on the spot.</p>

  <p>Schwing!</p>

  <p>A sword stabbed Shania's body.</p>

  <p>Immediately following that, Lucille turned around and thrust the other sword backward while simultaneously pulling back the first sword, creating another shocking wound on her opponent. Then, she turned back to Shania and pulled out the second sword as well.</p>

  <p>She pulled off these movements in the span of a split-second. It was as if several people were attacking at the same time, dazzling people's eyes!</p>

  <p>Schwing, schwing...</p>

  <p>Only after seven consecutive strikes did Lucille stop her ferocious attacks. Just to be safe, she even took a few steps back. But when she took a look at Shania, her expression changed.</p>

  <p>Although Shania's body seemed to be badly injured, there was not a single trace of blood flowing out from the wounds…</p>

  <p>Soon, her body began to rapidly turn yellow and wither before Lucille's eyes. Finally, it turned into a withered yellow trunk.</p>

  <p>On the other side of the Heaven Earth Board, there was a one-inch long sapling that was sprouting rapidly. It grew to the height of a woman and gradually turned into Shania's body!</p>

  <p>Shania laughed. "You can't even tell where the real me is? Do you really think you can become a Godly Genius?" Shania had a faint mocking smile on her face as she spoke.</p>

  <p>Lucille didn't say a word. She suddenly leaped backward into the air.</p>

  <p>While she was in the air, she lowered her head and started spinning!</p>

  <p>Her hands naturally drooped down. As she spun around, the swords in her hands began to spin as well, forming a wheel with killing intent!</p>

  <p>Lucille's reaction was incredibly fast. The instant she got close to Shania, the beams of radiance of the two swords intersected and flashed. The next moment, they had already swooshed around Shania's neck.</p>

  <p>With a plop, Shania's head was chopped off her body.</p>

  <p>But no blood was seen spurting from this wound.</p>

  <p>Soon, this body, too, turned into a withered trunk.</p>

  <p>The next moment, another sapling a few steps away grew rapidly, and once again, Shania was standing in front of Lucille unscathed.</p>

  <p>Lucille was well-prepared to contend with the other warriors of the top ten.</p>

  <p>She knew that whether it was Zheng, Nathan, or Margaret, who was specialized in sword array, none of them were weak!</p>

  <p>But the woman in front of her had never attracted her attention before.</p>

  <p>She had never expected that Shania would be so difficult to deal with.</p>

  <p>"Since you didn't listen to my suggestion, I will make you surrender." At this moment, Shania finally decided to launch an attack.</p>

  <p>She bent forward slightly and pointed at the ground with her fingers.</p>

  <p>Everyone saw a small seed sprouting from the ground. From inside that small seed, about five twigs with thorns surged out madly.</p>

  <p>These thorny twigs were ugly and were like vipers that crawled. Each twig had thorns on both sides and they spread out recklessly in all directions.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>Every time the twigs grew to a certain extent, they split into two, then four, and so on, wildly spreading around the Heaven Earth Board.</p>

  <p>In a short while, the whole board was covered by the twigs.</p>

  <p>As for Lucille, she was trapped in the middle of all the twigs.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>As Lucille circled around, two beams of light from her swords whirled around the twigs like a tornado and cut a clean area around her.</p>

  <p>But why were these twigs spreading so fast?</p>

  <p>Just as soon as she cut off the thorny twigs in one area, the twigs in another area immediately grew and surrounded her again.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Shania drifted through the mess of twigs with ease, like the queen of the thorn forest. Everywhere she went, the twigs automatically made way for her. And soon, Shania approached Lucille.</p>

  <p>At the moment, Zheng and the others were floating on their stones and were unable to see the fight between these two women in the thorn forest.</p>

  <p>Of course, it wasn't only them who couldn't see what was going on.</p>

  <p>All the warriors in front of the picture were paying close attention to the battle between Lucille and Shania, but they were unable to make out what was happening as both women were covered by the endless thorns.</p>

  <p>The audience could do nothing but stare blankly at the picture.</p>

  <p>After about five minutes, a loud sound blasted in everyone's ears.</p>

  <p>A sea of fire broke out in the thorn forest, and the scorching flames soon spread out across the whole board covered by the thorn trees.</p>
