<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 329 The Weapon Condensing Skill (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It was the first time that an outer disciple of the Drizzle Peak came to the Quenching Peak to borrow the weapon refining furnace.</p>

  <p>Harrison heard about some gifted and talented disciples that not only practiced martial arts but also had great attainments in refining weapons.</p>

  <p>But most of those talented disciples came from the noble clans and had great family backgrounds. Moreover, the weapon refining furnaces used by the noble clans were more advanced than those used by the disciples on Quenching Peak. So how could it be that a disciple came to Quenching Peak to borrow the weapon refining furnace from them?</p>

  <p>"You heard me right. I want to borrow your weapon refining furnace for a while. But don't worry, I'm not going to use it to refine a weapon. I just want to condense a weapon," Luo Zheng explained in a calm tone.</p>

  <p>Harrison was even more confused after hearing Zheng's explanation.</p>

  <p>From what Harrison could see, Luo Zheng wasn't a weapon refiner, so how could the latter be able to condense a weapon?</p>

  <p>Condensation was a process where a weapon refiner condensed his understanding of the Heavenly Law into a weapon. Only after the condensation could the weapon be graded. Therefore, condensation was considered the most important process in refining a weapon as the amount of understanding of the Heavenly Law would determine the grade of a weapon.</p>

  <p>There was a common belief that a thing could not exist without a basis.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng wasn't a weapon refiner, how could he comprehend the Heavenly Law? And if he couldn't comprehend the Heavenly Law, how could he possibly condense a weapon?</p>

  <p>This was the reason why Harrison was confused about Zheng's plan.</p>

  <p>But Harrison didn't see anything wrong in lending the weapon refining furnace to Luo Zheng for condensing a weapon.</p>

  <p>After all, condensing a weapon was less risky than refining one, and the first wouldn't result in the furnace explosion. Besides, whether Luo Zheng succeeded or not was none of Harrison's business.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Luo Zheng helped him earlier. If it wasn't for Luo Zheng, the weapon refining furnace could have exploded.</p>

  <p>After considering all of these, Harrison finally said to Luo Zheng, "If you just need to condense a weapon, I will gladly lend you the weapon refining furnace. But you need to wait until my top-grade mysterious weapon is condensed. It will take me some time to condense it, though."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled and replied, "I can wait. Take your time." With that, Luo Zheng turned and stood aside.</p>

  <p>Harrison then sat in front of the weapon refining furnace and released the fire again.</p>

  <p>But in reality, both fire and life vitality could be used to condense a weapon. The weapon refiner only needed to pour the life vitality into the weapon according to his own understanding of Heavenly Law to complete the process of condensation.</p>

  <p>It was not good for condensation if the applied heat was too high. After all, there was a volcanic branch connected at the bottom of the weapon refining furnace. The said volcano continuously provided temperature to the furnace by the underground lava so the temperature in the furnace wouldn't be too low even if there was no fire released in it.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng knew about the underground lava and that was the reason he came to the Quenching Peak to condense his weapon. Since he didn't specialize in the practice of fire cultivation method, he was not confident that the demonic life vitality could be used to condense a weapon. Although condensation didn't require high temperature, the weapon refining furnace still needed a certain temperature to work.</p>

  <p>Given Zheng's circumstances, the weapon refining furnace on the Quenching Peak was the best and only option to condense a weapon.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stood by and waited for a while. He saw Harrison poured the fire into the weapon refining furnace.</p>

  <p>From his observation, the fire Harrison used for condensation was less powerful than for the refining. When Luo Zheng looked carefully at the fire, he sensed that the fire emitted a strange power that he didn't know how to describe in words.</p>

  <p>Although the power that the fire emitted was extremely small, it couldn't be ignored at all.</p>

  <p>'The power might be Harrison's understanding of Heavenly Law!' Luo Zheng thought in his mind as he looked awed at the power hidden in the fire.</p>

  <p>The process of condensation was the most critical stage in weapon refining.</p>

  <p>The duration of condensation depended entirely on the understanding of Heavenly Law and a little luck.</p>

  <p>However, the duration of the condensation would not dictate the quality and the grade of the weapon after it was taken out from the weapon refining furnace.</p>

  <p>There were stories about weapon refiners and the stage of condensation.</p>

  <p>Since this process involved the Heavenly Law, these stories became more legendary.</p>

  <p>One of the legends said that there was someone who spent a month condensing a weapon. The weapon refiner didn't waste any time during the whole month of condensation that he ate and drank in front of the weapon refining furnace. He took that long because he thought that he hadn't condensed the weapon very well. And after a month of continuous condensation, he was able to condense a fairy weapon.</p>

  <p>There was another story that a weapon refiner was screwed up with abnormal weather in the process of condensation. The weapon refiner had only half an hour to condense his weapon considering the lightning, thunder, and gale. But after all the challenges, he was still able to condense a fairy weapon.</p>

  <p>These kinds of stories created misconceptions about weapon refining.</p>

  <p>They thought that the success of the weapon refining depended only on luck.</p>

  <p>But in reality, the ability was more important than luck in the process of weapon refining.</p>

  <p>In general, the weapon refining trainee like Harrison would take a long time in the process of condensation. It would take him two to four hours to condense a weapon.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng was willing to wait. He stood aside and waited for Harrison silently.</p>
