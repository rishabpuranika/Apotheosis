<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3673 Destroying The Sword Array </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Under Pearce's leadership, the powerful warriors of the six mountains, the Oneness Generals, the Oneness Guards, and the warriors of the Other Shore Realm of the twelve passes appeared in the sky.</p>

  <p>All the people in the Tiger Peace City looked up and found themselves cheering when they saw Pearce leading the troops.</p>

  <p>They couldn't tell what exactly had happened during the battle, but at the very least, the powerful warriors had survived.</p>

  <p>Just as they arrived at the Tiger Peace City, someone appeared in the transmission array, looking agitated. He rushed out, and when he saw Pearce and the mountain leaders, he was dazed for a moment before coming to his senses and excitedly saying, "Masters, it's so great to see you're safe and sound!"</p>

  <p>The man came from the Origin Mountain.</p>

  <p>Since the Bearing race invaded the Phoenix Palace, once they dealt with Eastern Emperor Taiyi, their next target was likely Yasmin of the Origin Mountain.</p>

  <p>Even the Origin Mountain couldn't escape the calamity.</p>

  <p>As the Oneness Sky Palace was stuck in such a situation, they were all in despair.</p>

  <p>The man had been sent to the Tiger Peace City to inquire about the situation of the battle in the North Unicorn Province.</p>

  <p>According to previous news, it was likely that the powerful warriors of the seven mountains in the province had already been killed. Little hope remained.</p>

  <p>But as soon as he arrived at the Tiger Peace City, he saw Pearce and the others descend.</p>

  <p>Over a hundred thousand Oneness Guards and Other Shore Realm warriors were also there.</p>

  <p>One couldn't even tell that they had just come from a fierce battle against the Sun Crow race.</p>

  <p>It seemed they had even managed to completely dodge the Nine-Sun World Destruction.</p>

  <p>The man from the Origin Mountain was both excited and confused. But when he saw Zheng bringing in with him many members of the Sun Crow race, his face changed color— he had no clue that the Sun Crow race had already surrendered to Zheng.</p>

  <p>Knowing that it wasn't the right time to satisfy his curiosity, he immediately rushed to Pearce. "Sir, the Bearing race is invading the Oneness Sky palace from the south!"</p>

  <p>"What did you say? They've broken through the Dragon Cliff?" The news made Pearce's face turn cold.</p>

  <p>Athemar, Goran, and the mountain leaders turned grim as well.</p>

  <p>"Patton should be guarding the Dragon Cliff. Is it possible that he…"</p>

  <p>Athemar mumbled and trailed off.</p>

  <p>The man from the Origin Mountain cupped his hands as he said, "It is said that Governor Patton has died."</p>

  <p>Hearing that, several Oneness Governors shut their eyes, revealing pained expressions.</p>

  <p>"Where are they now?" Pearce asked once again.</p>

  <p>"They've gone to the Oneness Mountain. They're probably besieging and attacking the Phoenix Palace now…They mean to kill Eastern Emperor Taiyi," answered the man.</p>

  <p>Anger flashed through Pearce's eyes. "Oneness Guards, remain in the Tiger Peace City. The leader of every mountain, along with your people, follow me into the transmission array!"</p>

  <p>The transmission capability of this array in the Tiger Peace City was rather limited. Now that the Phoenix Palace was in danger, Pearce was anxious.</p>

  <p>He decided to send the most powerful warriors back first.</p>

  <p>The Bearing race had destroyed the transmission array beside the Dragon Shadow Pavilion in the Dragon City. As a result, the array in this city could only transmit this particular group of people to the Origin Mountain.</p>

  <p>Soon, many powerful warriors began emerging from the beacon platform of the Origin Mountain, one after another.</p>

  <p>The powerful warriors from the seven mountains hadn't suffered great casualties. Over eighty people still remained. Zheng had dozens of members of the Sun Crow race behind him, and the Oneness Generals were also transmitted there.</p>

  <p>Once everyone arrived, they headed straight for the Oneness Mountain.</p>

  <p>"Receive my great halberd!"</p>

  <p>A man in black armor from the Bearing race threw his halberd into the air.</p>

  <p>Countless purple-black halberds began shooting down from the air like a rainstorm, crazily tearing at the Three-Element Sword Array.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>When all the halberds dropped, they made a deafening sound, making terrifying power erupt in the explosion.</p>

  <p>The Bearing race's powerful warriors launched their attacks in turns.</p>

  <p>Flamine struggled to hold on, but she was clearly nearing her limit. The entire Three-Element Sword Array was like a candle in the wind that could break at any time.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>Once the long halberds exploded, a great crack appeared in the middle of the Heaven Sword in Flamine's hand before it broke. In the next moment, Flamine spat out a mouthful of blood.</p>

  <p>The two powerful warriors holding the Earth Sword and the Human sword in their hands also began spitting out blood. One of them even fainted to the ground.</p>

  <p>And so the Three-element Sword Array was destroyed.</p>

  <p>"Haha!"</p>

  <p>Hancock laughed at the scene. "Friends, we shall kill all the people in front of the Phoenix Palace, and then we will take down Eastern Emperor Taiyi!"</p>

  <p>The powerful warriors of the Bearing race gazed down with sinister smiles.</p>

  <p>To them, their opponents were weak, consisting mostly of women and children. It was enough of a miracle that Flamine could even resist them with a sword array for so long.</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...</p>

  <p>Seven powerful warriors of the Bearing race then rushed out, clad in black clothes and hats— they were from the Black Jade Clan of the Bearing race.</p>

  <p>Even though the members of the clan had joined the Sky Guard Pavilion, they had a style of their own.</p>

  <p>Seeing the seven members of the Black Jade Clan rushing down, the golden-armored guards in front of the Supreme Dragon Hall burst into a deafening roar.</p>

  <p>"We will protect our emperor with our lives!</p>

  <p>We will stand guard till death!</p>

  <p>Kill them!"</p>

  <p>The guards at the Phoenix Palace were merely elites selected from the five-star Oneness Guards. In truth, it was still a question whether or not they were truly qualified to even be deemed as elites.</p>

  <p>A considerate part of the five-star Oneness Guards were above guarding the Phoenix Palace, after all.</p>

  <p>In most people's eyes, the palace was absolutely safe. To stay there was no different from living in retirement, some thought. It was nearly impossible for a guard to grow from working there.</p>

  <p>No one had ever expected the Oneness Sky Palace to fall into such a desperate situation in a short time.</p>

  <p>"Gee..."</p>

  <p>"I haven't seen such innocent cannon fodder in a long time."</p>

  <p>"I'm warning you! You'd better not get any blood on my clothes!"</p>

  <p>After quietly exchanging a few words with each other, the seven members of the Black Jade Clan rushed toward the Oneness Guards like eagles after their prey.</p>

  <p>The one in the lead twisted his body, transforming into a black cyclone.</p>

  <p>Regardless of where the cyclone passed, all sorts of broken limbs flew in the air, and blood splattered the area.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the other six launched their own fierce attacks. The five-star Oneness Guards couldn't hold on for even half a round before the powerful warriors.</p>

  <p>Tick…tick…tick…</p>

  <p>Blood began falling like rain.</p>

  <p>Dripping onto the eaves of the Phoenix Palace, it slid down the stairs.</p>

  <p>People began screaming and running off.</p>

  <p>On the stairs sat Feng Ge, indifferent to the blood splattering on her body.</p>

  <p>She examined the broken limbs and blood falling from the sky, her eyes full of gloom.</p>

  <p>"Why are you still here?" she asked.</p>

  <p>At her foot sat Xun, Liusu, and Nelly.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid we can't leave," Xun answered, pointing to somewhere nearby.</p>

  <p>While she wasn't exactly stronger than these people, her vision was still sharp.</p>

  <p>As early as the destruction of the sword array, some people began making use of the messy situation to escape. But soon after they rushed out, purple spear radiance descended, piercing through their bodies— the Bearing race intended to kill each and every one of them.</p>
