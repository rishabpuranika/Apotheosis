  <p>Kenneth laughed and asked, "When you said Jacques was very lucky and will likely have several other chances, does that mean that Luo Luo Zheng could not obtain such good fortune?" He pointed at the flying knife in Luo Zheng's hand and said, "Look at his knife, the Heavenly Ogre Fist he displayed, and the basic swordplay methods he mastered by himself! Which one would you say is ordinary?"</p>

  <p>"Your grace, you are right. I may still have some prejudice against him, knowing that Luo Zheng's strength is only in the low grade. The overwhelming force of the flood dragon has had adverse reactions on many disciples. I shall go down to help them!" Elder Xu said hastily. He made the remark after seeing the painful expressions on lower grade disciples' faces. After quickly jumping down from the high platform, he waved a wrinkled hand gently in the air and watched as emerald green life vitality transformed into a curtain of light, shrouding areas around the battle ring.</p>

  <p>The flood dragon's power made many disciples feel like lingering in the ice and snow, naked, and there was no way for them to resist the lure of the cold. If this continued for an extended period of time, it could damage their spirits.</p>

  <p>But as soon as the light curtain from Elder Xu's hand lightly swept over them, everyone suddenly felt as if they were dressed in thick cotton clothes and were warm enough to withstand the extreme cold.</p>

  <p>If a mere ten percent of the power released from it could cause so much pain for many disciples, what was the effect on Luo Luo Zheng, who was absorbing the remaining 90 percent? Everyone was now curious how the young disciple was dealing with it.</p>

  <p>With Elder Xu's help, the crowd resisted the flood dragon's power and began to watch the situation in the battle ring. They desperately wanted to see what happened to Luo Luo Zheng at that moment.</p>

  <p>Compared to regular mortals, Luo Zheng's spirit strength was far stronger.</p>

  <p>When he entered the Tier 4 Cultivation Method Hall of the Heavenly Library, he did not need the help of the cyan dragon, but instead, relied on his own spirit to resist the pressure generated by the intent of the Vengeful Beast. But as he entered the hidden room behind the Tier 4 Cultivation Method Hall, he was attacked head-on by the spirit of Vengeful Beast. The cyan dragon in his mind helped Luo Luo Zheng resist this surprise attack.</p>

  <p>What made Jacques' flood dragon bone spear more dangerous was that a secret cultivation method strengthened its power. So the spear produced 30 percent more power compared to energy released by the Vengeful Beast!</p>

  <p>Under the attack of such overwhelming power, and to that extent, it was not very hard to imagine the situation faced by Luo Luo Zheng at the moment.</p>

  <p>But unexpectedly, Luo Luo Zheng gritted his teeth and chose to bear the hardship.</p>

  <p>Through the cultivation method written in the Spiritual Thorn, Luo Luo Zheng exercised his spirit and entered into a state where he forgot himself enough to deepen his spirit strength step-by-step.</p>

  <p>As a result, even if the flood dragon bone spear's power was daunting, Luo Luo Zheng still managed to resist its attack successfully for the moment.</p>

  <p>But its effect on the warrior was not good. His usually ruddy face was as pale as a sheet at that moment.</p>

  <p>"Well, I must say it's a surprise that you can resist my attack for quite a long period, so now, I want to see how long you can hold against it!"</p>

  <p>Jacques challenged Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>After delivering the threat, he pounded the bone spear hard on the ground, which awakened the flood dragon that began to roar.</p>

  <p>The first roaring sound echoed throughout the arena.</p>

  <p>Furious, Jacques demanded, "Get down on your knees!"</p>

  <p>"Roar!"</p>

  <p>"Get down on your knees!"</p>

  <p>Then, the dragon roared once more.</p>

  <p>"Get down on your knees!"</p>

  <p>As Jacques pounded the bone spear on the ground thrice in a row, the dragon answered back with a furious roar every time.</p>

  <p>As a consequence, the dominant power of the spear kept pouring into Luo Luo Zheng like a surging wave three times as well, each wave stronger than the previous one. Meanwhile, the words "get down on your knees" that Jacques kept barking at Luo Luo Zheng, were likewise filled with indisputable majesty as if demanding him to come before the order of the king in heaven and on earth!</p>

  <p>"How can Luo Luo Zheng resist such power? If it were me, I'm afraid my spirit would have been destroyed and my body would already be a pile of dust at this moment," one disciple, fear written on his face, said.</p>

  <p>"My God! Jacques is a monster. How could he launch such dangerous attacks? Even if Elder Xu helped block the pressure, my knees are still quite weak, and I would want to get down on them..." another one added.</p>

  <p>"Alas, Jacques' previous attacks using that white bone armor were quite bold but simple. And I did not expect him to launch his spirit attacks in the same manner. What's more, such brutal attacks are so powerful that it's impossible to resist!" said another disciple, who was awed by everything he witnessed.</p>

  <p>Even though Elder Xu was helping disciples seated among the audience resist the pressure, they continued to quiver in fear upon seeing the situation on the battle ring.</p>

  <p>Patrick, seated on the ground, heard loud dragon roars that urged him to open his eyes slightly. There was a grave look on his face. But after a few moments, he shut his eyes calmly this time. The Buddha cultivation method was broad and profound, and perhaps, he already had a way to deal with Jacques' bone spear.</p>

  <p>With the long sword on his back, Tianming heard the three roars of the dragon. His fingers trembled at the sound and had to touch the sword handle behind him. As the disciple felt his sword, he heaved a gentle sigh. His eyes reflected the flickering light as he closely watched the ongoing competition in the arena.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the arena Luo Luo Zheng felt as if his spirit was shaking under a big storm, like a leaf hanging precariously on a tree branch, which at any time could be swept away by the wind to any place.</p>

  <p>But oddly, even with his perilous situation, Luo Luo Zheng was tenacious in resisting the attacks.</p>

  <p>This competition was undoubtedly the most dangerous one for Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Earlier, he had won all the way and had never been so close to being defeated.</p>

  <p>In truth, the strength gap between Luo Luo Zheng and Jacques was not so wide. But rather than his own strength, Jacques depended on the power of the dragon bone spear that was in his hand. Luo Luo Zheng, on the other hand, only trusted his own spiritual strength to combat the offensives.</p>

  <p>This was because he wanted to see the extent of his resistance.</p>

  <p>Not long after, a trace of blood was slowly oozing from the corners of Luo Zheng's mouth. While spirit attacks made idiots out of people or broke their brains into pieces, they would never hurt people intentionally.</p>

  <p>In order to stay awake, he bit his tongue so hard that blood trickled out his mouth.</p>

  <p>Taking a deep breath, he said in a cold tone, "Who do you think you are?</p>

  <p>You think you can order me to get me down on my knees?</p>

  <p>You? Humph! You're not competent enough to demand that!"</p>
