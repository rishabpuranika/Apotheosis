<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Naturally, Bacchus regarded the sudden appearance of these people as good news. This could probably change the course of things.</p>

  <p>Now that the Glede Demon race had been backed into a corner, he hoped against all hope that someone would arrive to make a difference.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Tate was not thoroughly pleased by this recent turn of event.</p>

  <p>This could ruin everything.</p>

  <p>He was shrinking the birdcage when all of a sudden, some humans appeared inside it. Why now?</p>

  <p>Where did these people even come from? He was utterly baffled.</p>

  <p>Was it possible that they were from somewhere outside the Night View Island? But where?</p>

  <p>Even though the Night View Island was an isolated place, the creatures in it still had a certain knowledge of the outside world.</p>

  <p>If one stood upon the mountains surrounding the Night View Island, they could easily see other Pure Sky Platforms. However, no one would be able to fly there.</p>

  <p>It was also known that there was a cave in the center of the lake. A long passageway was connected to it. Nevertheless, the passageway had long been broken. No one would be able to pass through it.</p>

  <p>Two days ago, Tate took his clansmen with him to search for Arcana from every house they encountered.</p>

  <p>Under normal circumstances, the Red Demon race wouldn't raid other races. For one thing, the Night View Island housed too many races. If they took it too far, they would be the first one to suffer.</p>

  <p>However, the Ghost Mountain needed a new Great Ghost Priest. This might be a once-in-a-lifetime chance.</p>

  <p>Obviously, Tate would never let this amazing opportunity just pass him by.</p>

  <p>He was determined to seize it while it stood.</p>

  <p>The small races were also well-aware about the changes in the Ghost Mountain. Once every couple of years, the Red Demon race would come and the small races would obediently hand their Arcana over to them.</p>

  <p>They needed not surrender all of the Arcana they had. Nevertheless, they still had to give away most of them.</p>

  <p>While Tate was searching for the Arcana, he suddenly saw a few flames emerging from the center of the lake.</p>

  <p>The flames were moving closer to the lake shore at a very fast rate. They were heading straight towards Tate.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, he realized that he was in grave danger. He immediately released his Treacherous Being. It took the form of a huge tortoise. It possessed the highest defensive power among all of the resentment-level Treacherous Beings.</p>

  <p>As the flames continued to surge towards his direction, a flash of white light shot out from the center of it.</p>

  <p>Tate didn't take the flash of light seriously at first. He was quite confident it wouldn't be able to reach him.</p>

  <p>He thought it was impossible for such an energy fluctuation to break through his strong defense. Tate had complete faith in his Treacherous Being.</p>

  <p>However, the supposedly indestructible tortoise suddenly appeared weakened soon after the white light hit its body. It even looked like it was suffering from an extremely horrific torture. It began thrashing around in agony.</p>

  <p>How could this be? This tortoise was a resentment-level Treacherous Being!</p>

  <p>Tate was utterly bewildered. He couldn't believe his own eyes.</p>

  <p>The other members of the Red Demon race were also dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>They were well-aware of how powerful the tortoise was. How could it succumb to such a feeble-looking energy?</p>

  <p>Even the strongest warrior of the Grand Mighty race and Bacchus of the Glede Demon race had never been able to break through the tortoise's shell.</p>

  <p>They thought nothing could ever penetrate it.</p>

  <p>However, the white light was able to incapacitate it quite easily!</p>

  <p>Why? Not one of them was able to explain how this came to be.</p>

  <p>As soon as the flames reached the shore, their blazing temperature made the water boil. They released steam and raised the temperature of the area.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the flames turned into three human-shaped fire spirits.</p>

  <p>Little by little, pieces of burning red armor began to condense all over the fire spirits' bodies. Soon enough they were fully covered in armor.</p>

  <p>Evidently, the three fire spirits came from the Holy Wings Armor. All of them belonged to Slade just like Gavyn.</p>

  <p>Although the Element Spirit Civilization arrived at the Treasure Bottle Platform on time, they were still unable to stop the Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven managed to escape them easily.</p>

  <p>The Godly Way extracted from the bottle was way too important to them.</p>

  <p>Naturally, the Eye Spirit didn't want the Grandmaster of Heaven to take it away. Therefore, they determinedly chased after him even outside of the Treasure Bottle Platform.</p>

  <p>The Eye Spirit was utterly relentless.</p>

  <p>They had to get the Godly Way back no matter what. They would still chase after him even if they had to go through the Amber Cave which was known as the Nihility race's lair.</p>

  <p>The Nihility race and the Element Spirit Civilization had been fighting against each other for such a long time. Both of these races always had something that would give them advantage over the other.</p>

  <p>But this time, the Nihility race had taken away something they shouldn't have. Therefore, the Element Spirit Civilization would stop at nothing.</p>

  <p>They were determined to fight even it would cost them their lives!</p>

  <p>Halfway through the chase, the three stone men placed in the underground cave were completely destroyed. The Treacherous Beings inside them were slain as well.</p>

  <p>The Eye Spirit instantly sensed that Zheng and his group had entered the underground cave.</p>

  <p>However, the Eye Spirit was busy chasing down the Grandmaster of Heaven. Both Claire and Gavyn were helping him pursue the Grandmaster of Heaven. Thus, he had to send out the other members of the Element Spirit race in Slade's body.</p>

  <p>The three fire spirits were named Sanderson, Townsend, and Chauncey.</p>

  <p>They were the leaders of the fire spirits inside Slade's body. Even though they were not on par with Gavyn in terms of strength, they were not much inferior to him.</p>

  <p>They arrived at the underground cave a little too late. After looking around, they discovered that Zheng and his companions had already disappeared.</p>

  <p>In the past, the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the others had also quietly vanished.</p>

  <p>The Element Spirit Civilization hadn't come into contact with the Treacherous Beings back then. Obviously, they were not aware of the existence of the Four Spirits Sect. They also did not know where the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the others were hiding.</p>

  <p>After a long period of time, the Element Spirit Civilization finally discovered how to get to the Jade Pure Realm and enter the Pure Sky Platforms.</p>

  <p>They were just about to enter the Night View Island when they faced a very unfortunate scenario. The passageway had already been destroyed by the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the others.</p>

  <p>This time, Sanderson, Townsend, and Chauncey just went straight into the pool. After boiling the water in the pool, they were able to see the passageway.</p>

  <p>When they saw it getting repaired, they became ecstatic. It wasn't as hopeless as they first thought it was.</p>

  <p>The flames emanating from their bodies were intense and scorching hot, which made the water around boil instantly.</p>

  <p>Before setting out, the Eye Spirit instructed them that they only needed to inquire about the movements of Zheng and his group. Zheng might have managed to repair the passageway. But if he failed, the three of them could just lurk in the cave to observe.</p>

  <p>The three fire spirits didn't actually take the Eye Spirit's words seriously.</p>

  <p>They doubted that the passageway of the Night View Island could be repaired so easily.</p>

  <p>Therefore, they didn't expect that the Eye Spirit was absolutely right.</p>

  <p>Obviously, they knew that the Night View Island was far more significant than the lives of Zheng and his companions.</p>

  <p>They were so thrilled that they ignored the Eye Spirit's words. They hurried into the Night View Island through the passageway.</p>

  <p>As soon as they emerged from the lake, they encountered the Red Demon race. It seemed like these demons could easily be intimidated.</p>

  <p>This was exactly what they wanted. They needed to gather as much information as they could right off the bat.</p>

  <p>"Hurry up! Put out these flames!"</p>

  <p>Tate ordered his clansmen all the while retreating farther away from the fire spirits.</p>

  <p>With the protection from the turtles, the Red Demons were not exactly afraid of getting burned by ordinary flames. But just as they took a step forward, the turtles covering their bodies were instantly pierced by the white light.</p>

  <p>The turtles immediately collapsed.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The Red Demons who rushed in front suddenly burst into flames. Their bodies were immediately burned to a crisp. Their corpses were completely charred.</p>

  <p>When the other Red Demons saw this, they were terrified and retreated quickly.</p>

  <p>Seeing that they were severely disadvantaged, Tate thought about escaping as well. However, it didn't seem like he would be able to do so.</p>

  <p>The three fire spirits turned into roaring flames and effectively surrounded Tate and his clansmen.</p>

  <p>"Answer all my questions, or no one will ever see you alive again!"</p>

  <p>Sanderson began intimidating them for information.</p>

  <p>Tate was absolutely terrified. As they were leaning at each other's backs, he felt his companions quivering with fear.</p>

  <p>He actually felt like his race would be exterminated today. They would be killed on the spot if he didn't cooperate.</p>

  <p>With all honesty, he told Sanderson what had happened on the Night View Island. He even explained everything in detail.</p>

  <p>He couldn't stop thinking how this might be their ends.</p>

  <p>But after he finished speaking, he was surprised the three fire spirits didn't attack them. It seemed like they had no intention of killing them now. He was even more astounded when they threw more than ten Holy Stones in front of him. They even taught him how to use the Light of Annihilation.</p>

  <p>"In three days' time, I expect you to collect all of the Arcana available on the Night View Island," Sanderson ordered Tate.</p>

  <p>Before, this would have been an impossible task to accomplish.</p>

  <p>But with the help of the Holy Stones, nothing was impossible.</p>

  <p>If they used the Light of Annihilation like they were taught, the creatures on the Night View Island would be no match for the Red Demon race at all.</p>

  <p>The first ones Tate robbed of Arcana were the creatures on the territory of the Red Demon race. This was the best place he could start.</p>

  <p>After he took every single Arcanum from these creatures, he proceeded to rob those within the territory of the Glede Demon race.</p>

  <p>Now, Tate's greatest goal was to annihilate the Glede Demon race as well as the Grand Mighty race using the power of the Holy Stones.</p>

  <p>Naturally, Bacchus couldn't just stand and watch as Tate raided the areas on the border of the Glede Demon race. He brought his people with him to slaughter the creatures from the Red Demon race's territory. The battle between the two races commenced tonight.</p>
