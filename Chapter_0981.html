<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Get me out of here! Zheng!" When she saw that Zheng wasn't going to say anything, Margaret's child-like temper worsened. She had completely forgotten that the reason Zheng was being chased all the way to the underground palace was entirely because of her!</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Zheng suddenly threw Margaret to the ground, with a force so strong that Margaret's supple body then hit the ground.</p>

  <p>As Margaret was at the primary level of the Internal Elixir Realm, the impact of her fall wasn't enough to injure her.</p>

  <p>However, this unprecedented act of violence from Zheng made Margaret dumbstruck. When she finally came back to her senses a few moments later, she suddenly screamed, "What are you doi-?"</p>

  <p>Pah!</p>

  <p>Just before Margaret could finish what she was trying to say, Zheng had already planted a slap across her face!</p>

  <p>Everyone knew that Zheng was a man of powerful strength. If he had concentrated his full strength on the slap, he would be able to smash Margaret's head into pieces. However, Zheng was able to control his strength, but the slap had still left a clear hand mark on her face.</p>

  <p>"If It hadn't been for you, do you think I would ever have come here?"</p>

  <p>Zheng said, shaking. There were very few people who could anger him.</p>

  <p>Other than Eddie, who was his sworn enemy, Zheng was rarely genuinely upset by anyone.</p>

  <p>Actually, the predicament they were in today wasn't something unconquerable to Zheng. Throughout the years, he had already experienced many other life or death crises that were ten times more troublesome than this! He knew there was still a gap between his and Eddie's strength, but in a fight between warriors, no one could be one hundred percent sure as to who would be the winner. But if he were to go all out to fight Eddie, he might have a chance to defeat him!</p>

  <p>But somehow, Zheng's flames of fury were successfully ignited by this foolish woman. It seemed like it was her talent to annoy and push people to their limits.</p>

  <p>Margaret slowly caressed her throbbing cheek and glared at Zheng, saying,</p>

  <p>"You - how dare you hit me!"</p>

  <p>Back in the Xi Clan's castle, Zheng had only used his malicious aura to suppress Margaret, but he didn't actually hit her.</p>

  <p>"Ever since you were a little kid, you have never been beaten by anyone, right?" Zheng blurted out before Margaret could continue her rant.</p>

  <p>"Yes! No one has ever dared to hit me in my entire life!" Margaret shouted, as she began hysterically crying.</p>

  <p>Pah!</p>

  <p>Just as Margaret finished speaking, Zheng slapped her again.</p>

  <p>With that slap, Margaret's beautiful hair became undone. She became a mess. Under the dim light in the cave, she glared at Zheng with her brown eyes. She gritted her teeth and said, "Zheng! I, I... I'll fight you to the death!"</p>

  <p>Her voice was shaking but determination was obvious in her eyes. She stood up. Slowly but surely, she took on a stance that was ready to fight.</p>

  <p>"Let me see how you fight me!"</p>

  <p>Zheng suddenly rushed forward. He grabbed Margaret's neck with one hand and pushed her against the wall, causing a loud bang. Lightly, he pointed his fingers towards her underbelly, sending a stream of life vitality into her body.</p>

  <p>Her cultivation level was far lower than Zheng's. After Zheng's life vitality was injected into her underbelly, it immediately disturbed Margaret's life vitality and stopped it from working.</p>

  <p>Zheng then flipped his hand and grabbed the collar of her clothes. He lightly pinched it and ripped her white dress off, tearing it into pieces.</p>

  <p>"What are you trying to do?" Margaret's eyes were wide open. She couldn't believe what Zheng was doing to her.</p>

  <p>Gash! Another ripping sound was heard.</p>

  <p>"What am I doing? I'm going to take away your virginity energy!" Zheng sneered. He stretched out his hand and the sounds of clothes being ripped filled the cave. In an instant, all of Margaret's clothes were ripped, and she was stark naked.</p>

  <p>Margaret had never been with any man before. She was greatly astounded, seeing Zheng savagely strip all her clothes off. Her body was completely naked now, and all the blood in her body surged to her head.</p>

  <p>Her face was completely red, half because of rage and half because of embarrassment.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, you're no different from a wild beast!" Margaret screamed.</p>

  <p>But Zheng had already turned a deaf ear to Margaret. He knew her struggle would be completely futile, as she was weaker than him in the first place— as a cultivator merely at the primary level of the Internal Elixir Realm.</p>

  <p>The truth was, even when Zheng was still a nature creature, he had a high chance of defeating her!</p>

  <p>Moreover, now her life vitality had been sealed by Zheng, and she wouldn't have the strength to resist.</p>

  <p>Soon after, Zheng held onto Margaret's shoulder and pushed her to the ground. The place might not be very clean as they were in a wet and cold cave, but at this time, Zheng couldn't care about anything else.</p>

  <p>Xun held onto her spear, floating beside him like a ghost, a cold smile on her face.</p>

  <p>"I've told you long ago to just take away her virginity energy yourself. If you had listened to me earlier, we wouldn't have gone into so much trouble, being chased by that Eddie guy," Xun said, as she shook her head. The customs of the Demon Night seemed to be very different from that of the human race. They didn't have any notion of taboo. Like now, unlike any human girl who would be too ashamed to see a scene of intimate intercourse, Xun fixed her beautiful eyes on the entangling bodies on the ground. There was not a trace of embarrassment on her face, and she was clearly not trying to avoid seeing it. Instead, she took great interest in what was happening and had enjoyed watching the scene in front of her thoroughly.</p>
