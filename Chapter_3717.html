<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3717 Nine Holy Soul Imprints </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Everyone stopped whatever they were doing, stunned by what just happened to Dailey.</p>

  <p>Most of them were clueless of the Holy Soul Imprint to begin with.</p>

  <p>When ordinary people reached one thousand feet, they would have met the end of their ropes. At this height, they wouldn't be able to hold on long, and their soul pillars wouldn't rise any more.</p>

  <p>However, the world always had extraordinary warriors.</p>

  <p>In the past, people already discovered that one thousand feet was not the farthest they could go. Once this height was met, the soul pillar could still rise if one possessed enough strength.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, there were a handful of creatures with extraordinary talents who attempted to push the envelope. Though one person would only have one chance, some of them finally obtained the Holy Soul Imprints.</p>

  <p>"I can't believe that Dailey obtained a Holy Soul Imprint!"</p>

  <p>"He truly is so great!"</p>

  <p>"Wow, and it's been so long since I saw someone do that last time..."</p>

  <p>People started chattering about Dailey's success.</p>

  <p>Because those who were qualified to obtain a Holy Soul Imprint were so few, ordinary people forgot about it. Seeing Dailey do it, everyone was reminded about the imprint and in turn, shocked them.</p>

  <p>As Dailey studied the Holy Soul Imprint on his chest, the corners of his lips turned up for a small smile.</p>

  <p>"Congratulations, Dailey!"</p>

  <p>"Another member of the Bearing race successfully obtained a Holy Soul Imprint!"</p>

  <p>"Dailey, you surely have a bright future ahead of you!"</p>

  <p>Just then, the Soul of Lights from the Bearing race also came up to congratulate him.</p>

  <p>However, Li Bianxue stood a few meters away, looking not so pleased.</p>

  <p>In the Taiyi Heaven Palace, she was the apple of everyone's eye, but in the Source World, she was not significant at all.</p>

  <p>It was for this reason that she knew Dailey was a lot stronger than her in everything.</p>

  <p>"Big deal."</p>

  <p>Zhu Ge Feng snorted, annoyed with the situation. He sat on his soul pillar, which was found deep into the soul cloud. Behind him followed Carver, who rose into the cloud very gracefully.</p>

  <p>The two often came to the Soul City to test their strength, so they knew their limits quite well.</p>

  <p>Once he reached five hundred and sixty feet, Zhu Ge Feng stood up and leaped off his soul pillar. Carver on the other hand, reached six hundred feet, which was five feet higher than his previous record. Such small progress was still success to him.</p>

  <p>"Primeval Lord of Heaven, what exactly is the Holy Soul Imprint?" Luo Zheng asked politely.</p>

  <p>"Think of it as a symbol of surpassing the limit of the Holy Soul Realm," the Primeval Lord of Heaven answered, "The benefits are self-explanatory.</p>

  <p>For warriors, it would make them stronger than others who have only reached the Holy Soul Realm. Moreover, it would bring them an additional advantage if they manage to reach the Eternal Realm, because they are stronger than ordinary Eternal Warriors."</p>

  <p>"How many Holy Soul Imprints did you retrieve, sir?" Luo Zheng continued to question.</p>

  <p>"Seven," the Primeval Lord of Heaven smiled. "The first Holy Soul Imprint is the Blazing Fire Imprint, which the young man from the Bearing race has just obtained. The second is the Myriad Lives Imprint, followed by the Lifeless Imprint, and the fourth... Overall, there are nine Holy Soul Imprints. If one obtained all, they would achieve a Nine-Imprint Holy Soul.</p>

  <p>That means the limit of the soul pillar is one thousand seven hundred and twenty feet high. So far, no one has been able to go high enough to obtain the last one."</p>

  <p>"You haven't obtained all, sir?" Luo Zheng was shocked to hear this, especially since the Primeval Lord of Heaven was so powerful.</p>

  <p>In the same moment, the Green Jade Spirit who happened to listen in on their conversation, couldn't help but join in, "The Wing King of our Green Jade Civilization only obtained five Holy Soul Imprints." The spirit exalted,</p>

  <p>"Primeval Lord of Heaven, you are amazing to have seven of them!"</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven shook his head, "Still, obtaining more makes no difference. I still failed to complete the Finale Way."</p>

  <p>As soon as the Primeval Lord of Heaven finished speaking, Feng Ge's eyes widened with excitement, "I seem to have some comprehension. Luo Zheng, I'll try it out first."</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the soul pillar below Feng Ge rose up and took her to the cloud.</p>

  <p>As she disappeared into the sky, her body appeared like a vague silhouette.</p>

  <p>Compared to Li Bianxue, Toby, and Dailey, Feng Ge was not interested in drawing attention. After all, she was new to the Soul City, so people would have doubted her abilities anyway.</p>

  <p>However, the longer she remained in the soul cloud, the more people noticed her.</p>

  <p>"This is the first time the human woman in her physical form took her test!</p>

  <p>She seems to have surpassed five hundred feet!"</p>

  <p>"That's awesome!"</p>

  <p>"I think it's the daughter of Eastern Emperor Taiyi. If that is true, her talent is not even a surprise."</p>

  <p>As Li Bianxue and Dailey watched from below, they looked closely at Feng Ge's soul pillar.</p>

  <p>For a new-comer, five hundred feet in one go was surprising.</p>

  <p>Eventually, the number on Feng Ge's soul pillar came to a stop at six hundred and seventy. It seemed that her first performance surpassed Li Bianxue's and Dailey's past tries.</p>

  <p>As for Zhu Ge Feng, Carver and the others, they couldn't help but feel somehow depressed.</p>

  <p>Though Feng Ge was Eastern Emperor Taiyi's daughter, they couldn't accept inferiority to her easily.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Within minutes, Feng Ge descended from the soul cloud and landed gently on the ground without a sound.</p>

  <p>The soul cloud made her feel solid, as if her soul materialized inside her physical form.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, it's your turn now!" Feng Ge giddily said.</p>

  <p>There was no doubt she was proud of what she'd done.</p>

  <p>While the rest looked at Luo Zheng in contempt, Feng Ge was worried about other things. She was afraid that Luo Zheng's performance would surpass hers by too much.</p>

  <p>Because if Luo Zheng passed through the Soul City right there and then, she realized that she'd have to spend a handful of years here without him by her side.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng rested on his pillar and nodded at Feng Ge. With one thought in his mind, his soul pillar began to rise slowly and took him to the sky.</p>

  <p>The minute he entered the soul cloud, he sensed tides rushing towards his Soul of Light. Meanwhile, ghost faces hid within the tides, all biting at Luo Zheng with ferocity.</p>

  <p>For some reason, Luo Zheng was unharmed by their bites. It came to a point that the ghost faces left without harming him.</p>

  <p>The longer he remained in the soul cloud, the more confused he got.</p>

  <p>In the past, Luo Zheng went through countless trials and tribulations that he was not shocked with them anymore. He'd suffered in all aspects, whether mentally or physically. In each test, he always came out stronger than ever.</p>

  <p>This was the first time all he had to do was sit. He had never been through such a peaceful test.</p>

  <p>Once the ghost faces stopped, Luo Zheng opened his eyes to see something odd - his soul pillar didn't rise by even an inch!</p>

  <p>At this point, the Souls of Light under the soul cloud paid attention to him and began to giggle in mockery.</p>

  <p>"The poor guy didn't comprehend even a little! That's funny!"</p>

  <p>"Is he the kind of Soul of Light that can never turn into a Colorless Soul?"</p>

  <p>"I've heard that some Souls of Light can't achieve the Colorless Soul, so they can't advance even an inch in the soul cloud. That rarely happens though." People were laughing and confused at the same time.</p>

  <p>For some reason, the number on his pillar never advanced. How was this possible?</p>
