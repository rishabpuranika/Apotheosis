<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1744 Spiders </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The situation in the dark room turned chaotic all of a sudden.</p>

  <p>Some unknown creatures were approaching them. The creatures were unable to avoid Luo Zheng's sword radiance. When they got penetrated by it, they let out ear-piercing hisses.</p>

  <p>Xun too launched an attack and at the same time, the sound of light footsteps came from not too far away!</p>

  <p>Then Luo Luo Zheng heard Xun's delicate voice? it sounded as if she was fighting with someone in the dark.</p>

  <p>"Bang, bang!"</p>

  <p>In all this chaos, Luo Luo Zheng slipped and started falling down rapidly!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was struggling to stabilize his body when he felt a powerful force catch him and pull him to one side. Soon after, several threads draped his body.</p>

  <p>He struggled against the extremely soft and flexible threads.</p>

  <p>"Clang!"</p>

  <p>The thunder and lightning began to accumulate on the Thunder Wind Divine Sword, but it was instantly repelled by something. With a clang, the sword fell to the ground!</p>

  <p>Only after the Dark Law lifted partially did Luo Luo Zheng discover that he was lying on a huge spider web.</p>

  <p>The threads forming the web looked like they had been spun delicately from gold. He was bound by many threads, which firmly locked him in place.</p>

  <p>Not too far away, there was a hexagonal seal. Xun was ensconced within the seal. She was still holding onto her spear!</p>

  <p>Suddenly something dawned on him at that moment. Had he fallen into a trap?</p>

  <p>He twisted his body with a sudden jerk, wanting to break free from the golden spider web. However, it did not have much effect on this kind of a flexible spider web, which molded and moved in sync with his body movements. Of course, it could also be that Luo Luo Zheng was not strong enough.</p>

  <p>He was mightier compared to other warriors at the same cultivation level, but when facing really powerful masters, his strength was still inadequate.</p>

  <p>As he continued to squirm and wriggle, the number of golden spider threads multiplied, binding Luo Luo Zheng tighter to the web.</p>

  <p>Xun's expression was uncharacteristically calm as she sat holding the Saint Killing Spear in her hand. Her composed manner gave Luo Luo Zheng the heebie-jeebies.</p>

  <p>"Pa, pa, pa?"</p>

  <p>At this moment, footsteps could be heard once again.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng looked towards the direction in which the sound came and saw a black figure. There was a small black shadow on the person's shoulder.</p>

  <p>The person's jade-green eyes emitted an uncomfortable light.</p>

  <p>When the figure approached, Luo Luo Zheng furrowed his brows and said coldly,</p>

  <p>"Master Bi."</p>

  <p>Finch Bi seemed to have become a completely different person. He simply chuckled in response when he heard Luo Zheng's voice.</p>

  <p>"Where's Freya?" Luo Luo Zheng asked with a frown.</p>

  <p>"She's dead," Finch answered flatly.</p>

  <p>"Huff, huff?"</p>

  <p>An enraged flame rose in Luo Zheng's heart as an enormous Mu Ning burst forth from within his body.</p>

  <p>He had been on guard with the Sword Manor right from the beginning.</p>

  <p>Before he entered the Killing Sword Mountain, Luo Luo Zheng had been hesitant about bringing Freya with him. However, Finch had repeatedly emphasized the rule that he had to enter the Killing Sword Mountain alone. That was why he had left Freya behind.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry, he is lying to you," Xun said calmly. "He won't kill Freya in front of his subordinates, not to mention she isn't important to him, and he won't bother dealing with her specially."</p>

  <p>Hearing Xun's words, Luo Luo Zheng calmed down a bit.</p>

  <p>Finch had a smile on his face. "You are indeed still too young. I've already said this before: letting a group of children lead the way is simply ridiculous."</p>

  <p>Whether it was Nathan or Luo Luo Zheng, these Godly Geniuses were indeed outstanding. However, in the eyes of these world lords, who had lived for countless years, they were undoubtedly children? too young and inexperienced.</p>

  <p>However, Xun replied indifferently, "It is not your fate to lead the way. Even if you're a Supreme Lord, you still don't have such a fate."</p>

  <p>"I don't believe in fate," Finch said as he strolled up towards them. From beneath his feet, golden threads began to appear. These threads wove into layers of steps, and he briskly walked up.</p>

  <p>"Even if it isn't my destiny right now, I will have it in a while," Finch added arrogantly.</p>

  <p>"Roaaaaaar!"</p>

  <p>The black shadow on his shoulder raised its head and let out a loud cry.</p>

  <p>It was only then that Luo Luo Zheng saw clearly that it was a pure black leopard.</p>

  <p>However, it was no ordinary creature. It looked like an extremely formidable beast. The black shadow that Luo Luo Zheng had been chasing before must have been this same leopard, which wasn't any bigger than a cat?</p>

  <p>"What are you trying to do?" Luo Luo Zheng asked angrily.</p>

  <p>"Can't you see? I've been waiting for this for a long time?" Finch smiled in a sinister way. With a casual wave of his hand, the Dark Law, which wasn't far away, began to fade away. A ring appeared from within the darkness. He reached out and pulled the ring out from the air.</p>

  <p>The instant he grabbed the ring, a loud rumbling sound came from the darkness in the distance, as if countless boulders were rolling. The Dark Law disappeared completely without a trace, and what appeared before Luo Luo Zheng was a vast expanse of space.</p>

  <p>In the distance, there were some slender objects that resembled dried fish. They were all suspended in the air by golden threads.</p>

  <p>The strange things had red skin, and their hands and feet were incongruous with their bodies. Golden threads were bound around their necks and their heads were stuffed into caves.</p>

  <p>These things might be the monsters that Luo Luo Zheng had encountered earlier. He had seen their faces in small caves.</p>

  <p>"You want to usurp Supreme Lord Sword's inheritance on my behalf?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng wasn't an idiot; he finally understood why Flinch was present here.</p>

  <p>Finch waited until the stone pillars stopped before pulling another stone column. Then, there was a rumbling sound, as though there were countless mechanisms hidden in this space.</p>

  <p>As he was busy setting something, Finch replied, "It's obvious. There are some things that should not be done by you."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyebrows rose slightly...</p>

  <p>What exactly was the inheritance of Supreme Lord Sword?</p>

  <p>What Luo Luo Zheng thought earlier was that it was only a trial, but now it seemed that the situation wasn't as simple as he'd thought.</p>

  <p>Even Xun had acted very strange. There seemed to be a very significant meaning attached to this journey.</p>

  <p>But whether or not it was important, it had nothing to do with his goal, which was to complete his Emotion Closing Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>Locked in the hexagonal seal, Xun sneered. She shook her head and said, "It's not that Luo Luo Zheng is naive, it's you who is naive. There are some things that exist even if you don't believe in them. You're just a small character, and you can't change anything?"</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>The moment Xun spoke, an extremely sharp sword radiance shot out from Finch's hand. He had actually used his finger as a sword, but still, the power was also extremely terrifying!</p>

  <p>In the end, he had the cultivation level of a grand world lord's.</p>

  <p>If this sword radiance landed on Luo Luo Zheng, there was no way he could survive it.</p>

  <p>However, the sword radiance did not attack Luo Luo Zheng. Instead, it went straight for Xun who was still inside the hexagonal seal!</p>

  <p>As the sword radiance cut through the air, it sliced off Xun's arm from its root. Her severed arm turned into bits of red light before condensing into an arm again?</p>

  <p>Xun was a sword spirit form so she was not hurt too much, but her face didn't look good.</p>

  <p>If Finch wanted to, he could completely obliterate Xun's soul. After the recovery of her soul, her strength had increased a great deal, but she was still unable to contend against a world lord. Not to mention that Finch's strength was comparable to that of a grand world lord.</p>

  <p>Finch smiled wickedly, "Whether I have it or not is something that I will know only after trying. Moreover, I have been studying this damned place for countless years in anticipation of this very day! There is no omission in my arrangement, so I know that I won't fail."</p>

  <p>Xun did not utter a word. She only glared at Finch icily.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng also realized what was going on. Finch was well aware that the inheritance of Supreme Lord Sword was located right below the Killing Sword Mountain. At the same time, it was not his first time in the Killing Sword Mountain. It was obvious that he had disobeyed Sword Chen's orders long ago.</p>

  <p>Now he planned to obtain the inheritance of Sword Chen.</p>

  <p>But from the looks of it, the inheritance was not merely a trial, otherwise Finch would not have placed so much importance on it?</p>

  <p>So then what was it?</p>

  <p>Xun seemed to know something, but she was not telling him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was glum. All he could do was stay and watch as Finch busied himself in setting the place.</p>

  <p>Soon sizzling sounds filled the air.</p>

  <p>After Finch activated some mechanism, he heard something crawling once again. But this time, the sound was denser. It was as if there were countless small creatures crawling in all directions.</p>

  <p>Soon, Luo Luo Zheng saw an astonishing scene.</p>

  <p>A large army of small spiders appeared from the cracks in the surrounding space. These spiders were dark red in color. A sea of spiders were surging towards Luo Luo Zheng.</p>
