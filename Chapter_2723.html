  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Quack! Quack!"</p>

  <p>The Magical Crow croaked as it stood on a golden branch. Noticing Zheng's gaze, it said, "Don't you hear me? I represent the Grand Chieftain.</p>

  <p>As a member of the Nine Li race, you should kneel down to show your respect!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyebrows creased as he asked, "Even a member of imperial lineage has to kneel?"</p>

  <p>"You have imperial-grade bloodline?"</p>

  <p>The Magical Crow was taken aback by Zheng's words. It suddenly let out a weird scream and fell down from the golden branch.</p>

  <p>It flapped its wings and flew back to the branch. After staring at Zheng for a long time, it pecked at the branch.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>A cubic stone carrying a container on it rose from the branch.</p>

  <p>It appeared that it was the vessel used to test Zheng's blood just now.</p>

  <p>"You really have the imperial-grade bloodline. Has the Nine Li race reduced to such a point? Is it necessary for the royal family to personally control the reincarnation? Besides, you keep me waiting too long, don't you?" The Magical Crow continued to flutter its wings while crying out in surprise.</p>

  <p>It seemed that it had been locked up here for too long a time.</p>

  <p>In other words, it had never left since Chiyou placed it here.</p>

  <p>Just like the hall soul, it had been waiting for someone from the Nine Li race to rule the Reincarnation Hall. However, the time it took for them to wait had already been too long.</p>

  <p>"All the Nine Li people in the divine land have been killed," Zheng revealed in response.</p>

  <p>"All of them have been killed? It's impossible!"</p>

  <p>The Magical Crow fluttered its black wings and let out a strange scream.</p>

  <p>Its expression showed a look of disbelief.</p>

  <p>"That's true. They were killed by the Yellow Emperor Guards," Zheng continued.</p>

  <p>"How could this happen?" the Magical Crow mumbled. It constantly jumped up and down on the golden branch.</p>

  <p>Zheng at this time didn't bother to continue to talk to the bird, and asked directly, "Can we start the test now?"</p>

  <p>"What's the hurry?" the Magical Crow complained.</p>

  <p>It was already enjoying having its finger in every pie, but the current situation reminded it of its duty. It had to preside over the test.</p>

  <p>Urged by Zheng, it flew away from the golden branch and floated to the top of the space. Making a move, it spread its black wings and a string of golden light flashed down from the back of its wings.</p>

  <p>The test had begun. At this point, the space inside the door was slowly changing into a different world.</p>

  <p>"Bang! Bang! Bang!"</p>

  <p>Flags waved in the distance, and loud drums were heard being loudly struck.</p>

  <p>One million generals and soldiers appeared and were standing side by side. Their eyes were looking at Zheng as if they were facing a formidable enemy.</p>

  <p>"Mortals?" Zheng's eyes flashed.</p>

  <p>The generals and soldiers were just mortals. Their number was indeed large but no matter how many they were, they were nothing to him as he considered them as ants.</p>

  <p>Given Zheng's strength, they were even weaker than ants.</p>

  <p>Such a test was beyond his expectation.</p>

  <p>"Kill!"</p>

  <p>"Kill!"</p>

  <p>"Kill!" the generals shouted and gave the command.</p>

  <p>"Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!"</p>

  <p>The war horns sounded.</p>

  <p>The army of mortals marched and rushed towards Zheng like raging waves on the sea.</p>

  <p>Zheng raised his hand gently when they were still a few miles away.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>A lightning bolt was shot out. The lightning flashed past the crowd four or five times, and the army of a million people had collapsed.</p>

  <p>One against a million. He was sure outnumbered but it was certainly a piece of cake for him to defeat them.</p>

  <p>He fought back with ease but he was still bothered in confusion.</p>

  <p>According to the Magical Crow's words, the test had been personally organized by Chiyou. It couldn't be so simple.</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng was puzzled, faint dots of light appeared in the bodies of the one million mortals that had been struck to death by the lightning bolt.</p>

  <p>"The Memory Flames?" he muttered and recognized them at a glance.</p>

  <p>Just as the Memory Flames left the bodies of the mortals who had been killed, their bodies also disappeared.</p>

  <p>At this time, he was facing a million Memory Flames. It was the same number of people he had just killed.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>The Memory Flames flocked towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>Seeing so many of them, he felt a little nervous. He had already encountered and had been attacked by Memory Flames outside the Reincarnation Hall.</p>

  <p>The result of the fight wasn't good. They had almost destroyed his soul.</p>

  <p>It happened in a flash that the Memory Flames totally engulfed Zheng's brain and sank into his soul.</p>

  <p>"These Memory Flames are not as powerful as I think."</p>

  <p>He was not overpowered but he was actually absorbing them.</p>

  <p>Although the number of Memory Flames was not small, their owners were only mortals.</p>

  <p>The life spans of the mortals were limited. They only lived until they reached over thirty to fifty years of age, so they didn't have many memories. They were different from the True Gods in the divine land whose memories lasted several divine eras.</p>

  <p>Even so, he was still in trouble. The Memory Flames still had inserted a lot of messy memories in his mind.</p>

  <p>Zheng shook his head and tried to forget the memories imparted on his brain.</p>

  <p>"Quack! Quack!"</p>

  <p>The Magical Crow in the sky cawed as it glanced at Zheng and said, "The second wave!"</p>

  <p>"Swish!"</p>

  <p>With a wave of its wings, another ray of golden light fell.</p>

  <p>The whole world changed for the second time.</p>

  <p>A stretching and undulating mountain appeared in front of Zheng. On the mountain stood ten thousand warriors at the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>"Ten thousand warriors at the Soul Sea Realm?" He grasped the current situation as he prepared for another fight.</p>

  <p>"Kill! Kill! Kill!"</p>

  <p>All of the Soul Sea Realm cultivators soared in the air and swooped down from the mountain.</p>

  <p>They had already been able to create their Soul Seas, and their strength had already undergone a qualitative leap.</p>

  <p>The strength of ten thousand powerful warriors at the Soul Sea Realm couldn't be easily underestimated.</p>

  <p>In the face of such an attack, Zheng narrowed his eyes slightly and an invisible force condensed into a flying sword.</p>

  <p>"Swish! Swish! Swish!"</p>

  <p>The invisible flying sword swept past the sky at a lightning speed.</p>

  <p>The warriors in turn could not resist the attack at all. They would die as soon as their bodies were touched by the invisible flying sword.</p>

  <p>They had managed to launch various attacks on Zheng but he was calm and didn't avoid every bit of them. He just let them attack, but it appeared that their attacks didn't hurt him at all.</p>

  <p>After a short while, he had killed all the warriors.</p>

  <p>The same scene that happened to the mortals took place once again.</p>

  <p>Memory Flames erupted from the bodies of the dead warriors.</p>

  <p>However this time, the flames were much brighter than those of the mortals.</p>

  <p>After all, a warrior at the Soul Sea Realm could live for tens of thousands of years, so the memories recorded in the Memory Flames were far more than those of a mortal. The Memory Flames of ten thousand warriors at the Soul Sea Realm were much more powerful than those of the mortals.</p>

  <p>"Swish! Swish! Swish!"</p>

  <p>With so many Memory Flames entering his mind, Zheng felt a little pressure.</p>

  <p>But he could still handle it with ease.</p>

  <p>"The third wave! Quack! Quack!"</p>

  <p>The voice of Magical Crow resounded, and the world in front of him changed for the third time.</p>

  <p>This time, True Gods appeared in front of him.</p>

  <p>He looked around and there were 1, 000 low-rank True Gods.</p>

  <p>Zheng was under increasing pressure in the face of the attacks of 1, 000 low-rank True Gods.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, he was surrounded by the low-rank True Gods.</p>

  <p>Then all sorts of internal momentum surged up.</p>

  <p>"These low-rank True Gods cultivate different kinds of Godly Ways."</p>

  <p>Zheng's expression was complicated as his eyes flashed.</p>

  <p>The 1, 000 low-rank True Gods cultivated 1, 000 kinds of Godly Ways.</p>
