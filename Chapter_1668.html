<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1668 Xenia Luo </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The fact that the first martial artist had been eliminated didn't attract much attention from the eyes of ordinary martial artists.</p>

  <p>It was quite normal for a martial artist to be eliminated in a fight or a battle. After all, there had to be a loser, for there to be a winner.</p>

  <p>However, there were many martial artists who began to question the rules that governed this Heaven Earth Board. Using this method of eliminating martial artists seemed to be utterly baseless, and it was impossible to select the real best martial artist.</p>

  <p>For example, the fact that the ogre warrior named Norvin had been defeated three times in a row without being eliminated, was considered unfair by other warriors.</p>

  <p>However, the combatants and spectators didn't realize that this battle was just a prelude of the universe's future. This age-old play had very little to do with fairness in the end.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, the Supreme Lords in the universe paid special attention to this tricky matter.</p>

  <p>The first ace talent who had been eliminated?</p>

  <p>His name was Gael.</p>

  <p>He was the best warrior from the Spring race.</p>

  <p>The Spring race was a small and unknown race, and they couldn't even be considered a second-rate race. However, an ace talent had been born in this insignificant race. After all, this race controlled only three supreme worlds. These three supreme worlds were extremely poor and mostly barren, so no major force was willing to occupy such a strategically unsound territory.</p>

  <p>"Could it be... Could it be that the crisis of this round of the universe is due to arise from such a small and unknown race?"</p>

  <p>Within the Humanity Alliance, Supreme Lord Healum muttered as he surveyed the black and white stones.</p>

  <p id="top_11">"It's such a small race, the Spring race. Our Humanity Alliance can easily destroy them with the combined strength of just a few tenth-grade sacred places. Do they even have the ability to trigger a crisis?" Yolande asked in confusion.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Healum smiled and said, "This kind of small race is nothing to fear, but? They may not have the ability to initiate a crisis, but a crisis might break out from their side in any case."</p>

  <p>How would this crisis then happen? So far, no one had an inkling how it would happen.</p>

  <p>It could be a silent, apocalyptic plague that not even Supreme Lords could fight against; it could also be a destruction on an eradicative scale due to the fall of the stars; or, it could also be a war instigated by an ambitious schemer from some greater forces. A storm started with a small drop.</p>

  <p>Given the speculations of many Supreme Lords, their gazes all turned upon the Spring race.</p>

  <p>If they were to start speculation about this race, they would very likely deduce a probable result. According to this result, they would then be able to set up their defenses in advance in order to overcome the predicted crisis.</p>

  <p>The stones on the Heaven Earth Board were still falling down one by one, forming a strange linear pattern.</p>

  <p>The white stones which were 'definite' seemed to have a stable basis, and they already occupied a large area on the board. As for the black stones, which were 'variable', their line had become jagged and was cut into pieces by the white stones.</p>

  <p>As the warriors became more familiar with the rules, the way they fought changed as well. After all, the warriors' motto was adapt or die.</p>

  <p>These martial artists all had a rough estimate of their own strength.</p>

  <p>If one encountered a stronger opponent and was unwilling to reveal their trump card, they would voluntarily admit defeat. In any case, admitting defeat in such a situation would not see them eliminated. However, if they revealed their trump card too early and faced a life or death battle, they might be targeted and eliminated.</p>

  <p>And because of this unusual circumstance, this round of battles continued to grow in speed.</p>

  <p>After both sides were placed on the board, they quickly guessed at each other's strength. They even probed each other before deciding if they should immediately surrender.</p>

  <p>This method obviously might not have been the true intent of the Heaven Earth Board. However, the mysterious girl didn't stop them. She continued to focus on the 300 ace talents, and constantly placed them on the board.</p>

  <p>And whenever a white or black stone was to be 'surrounded and eaten', which was also the opportune time to launch a critical killing move, the martial artists on both sides would naturally start to take the fight seriously.</p>

  <p>If one lost in that situation, they would be eliminated immediately!</p>

  <p>So, naturally, they would go all out under that situation.</p>

  <p>As more and more stones tumbled over on the board, the speed at which the martial artists were being eliminated also increased.</p>

  <p>Because when it came to 'surrounding and eating', someone would definitely be eliminated.</p>

  <p>In this point in time, Luo Luo Zheng and Mu Ning had respectively been cornered on the Heaven Earth Board twice.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng still relied on his spear. Once, his opponent voluntarily admitted defeat; and the other time, after launching a fearsome blow, his opponent had stopped resisting and admitted defeat.</p>

  <p>As for Mu Ning, no one had been able to break her Purple River Sword Array. Every time she activated it, her opponent would instantly admit defeat.</p>

  <p>Just like that, nearly three hundred stones fell on the board. These ace talents had also fought three hundred times in total.</p>

  <p>Of course, most of the fights were perfunctory and not very impressive.</p>

  <p>However, there was a group of martial artists who had yet to enter the Heaven Earth Board.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the white stones on the board had formed a giant dragon, and the situation had become extremely solid.</p>

  <p>However, although the dragon was stable, it was not completely still. A struggle had occurred at the top of the dragon against the black stones.</p>

  <p>The critical point of this struggle was likely three or four steps away from coming into being.</p>

  <p>Those martial artists who were well-versed in the game could already see that this situation was likely to become a standoff between two Godly Geniuses! After all, this struggle would directly determine the outcome of the black and white stones. If the black stones were to lose again, the originally disadvantaged situation would lose its chance to be restored. If white stones lost, then this dragon would be killed by the black stones, and their situations would become reversed.</p>

  <p>The next few steps were therefore the most critical ones!</p>

  <p>Tap!</p>

  <p>Another pair of black and white stones landed on top of the dragon.</p>

  <p>Two martial artists entered the arena. They fought, and one quickly admitted defeat.</p>

  <p>Tap! Tap!</p>

  <p>Two more stones fell on the board, and two more martial artists stepped up. One was Lawson from the Thoughtless Minds, the other was a diminutive race's ace talent. That ace talent quickly admitted his defeat, knowing that he was no match for Lawson.</p>

  <p>Right at this moment, the final step in the struggle had materialized.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes flickered when he noticed the situation on the board. These two steps were particularly crucial in triggering the appearance of the conflict. Moreover, this was a life and death situation. The loser would be eliminated if the dragon was slain.</p>

  <p>Then who would be the martial artists that were chosen?</p>

  <p>Most of the warriors in the game were masters of strategy, and they could see that the mysterious girl was not skilled at this game. Everyone was holding their breath because they knew that whoever was chosen to the Heaven Earth Board faced the strong possibility of being eliminated, and at this level of the game, the opponent they would meet would not be at all weak.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A lily-white hand grabbed hold of a violet-haired woman.</p>

  <p>She was Xenia Luo from the Celestial Position race!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was not familiar with this woman, and he had never had occasion to visit the Celestial Position's worlds before. Although, once the old leader had sent someone to ask him to go there, Luo Luo Zheng had been unable to do so at that time. But this Xenia had been held down to the board twice, and her two opponents both immediately admitted defeat.</p>

  <p>Hearing the introduction from the others, Luo Luo Zheng realized that this warrior was a Godly Genius of the Celestial Position race!</p>

  <p>There were about nine warriors of the Celestial Position who had slaughtered their way into the top three hundred rankings. Furthermore, the Celestial Position race had two Godly Geniuses.</p>

  <p>One was Xenia, and the other was Karl.</p>

  <p>The Godly Genius entered the arena.</p>

  <p>Many of the martial artists had a dignified bearing and focused expression on their faces.</p>

  <p>This was a battle between life and death. No one was willing to be eliminated. If they conceded, they would also be eliminated. Who would be willing to duel a Godly Genius at this time?</p>

  <p>Therefore, the vast majority of the assembled martial artists were praying in their hearts, praying that they wouldn't be chosen to enter the arena for this duel.</p>

  <p>After the Godly Genius of the Celestial Position was cast onto the board, the hand hovered over Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Seeing the intention of the hand, Luo Zheng's eyebrows twitched. "It's me?"</p>

  <p>However, with an index finger extended, the hand ultimately went directly over Luo Zheng's head and grabbed a warrior not too far away from him, Tianming!</p>

  <p>"So it's Tianming who gets to fight her," Mu Ning said softly, a tinge of relief in her tone. No one wanted to duel against a Godly Genius and face the real possibility of being eliminated.</p>

  <p>"Tianming..." Luo Zheng's brow creased slightly.</p>

  <p>This was not good news.</p>

  <p>He knew that the increase in Tianming's strength had already caused a qualitative change, but he wasn't sure if it was enough to win victory for Tianming.</p>

  <p>Those Godly Geniuses, although they were also Soul Sea Realm warriors, had completed the full bloom of their Mahayana Lotus Flowers. If they did not die, they would have a high chance of becoming True Gods. And most importantly, they had already begun to comprehend the Divine Dao, so their understanding and use of the Divine Dao were far superior to normal warriors.</p>

  <p>If Tianming were to face Xenia, the odds were heavily stacked against him.</p>

  <p>When Tianming saw the concerned expression on Luo Zheng's face, he smiled at Luo Luo Zheng before his black stone was held down to the board. He was still indifferent, confident, and full of the heroic spirit of a true warrior.</p>

  <p>And at this very moment?</p>

  <p>A flurry of conversation erupted from one of the tenth-grade sacred places of the Thoughtless Minds.</p>

  <p>Tianming had ascended to a tenth-grade sacred place of the Thoughtless Minds, and thus he had become the hope of this sacred place.</p>

  <p>Never in his dreams had their Saint Lord ever imagined that a martial artist, who came from this sacred place, would actually be able to stand within the top three hundred.</p>

  <p>The entire Thoughtless Minds was subject to the rule of the four great clans, while their tenth-grade sacred places were merely subordinate to the four great clans. The warriors who had qualified to enter the top three hundred were the ace talents and Godly Geniuses of the big clans; while, the rest of the ace talents of the tenth-grade sacred places had failed completely.</p>

  <p>However, Tianming was the only exception.</p>
