<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 628 Destroy A Beginner's Confidence (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>When Tia had finished talking, she fired a message rune. "Felix, please come here to my place."</p>

  <p>'Felix?' Morphens did not understand. He looked at Tia, a puzzled expression on his face. "Miss, what do you want Felix to do? You will not ask Felix to teach Luo Luo Zheng the skills of making runes, will you?"</p>

  <p>Felix Zong was the best runic expert of the Cloud Hall. The protection array Tia obtained from the Cloud Road was given to him and Felix had been studying it since. How powerful and profound the protection array of a sixth grade sect was! So Felix was very busy now. It would cost countless resources to set up the protection array. However, once they thought about how powerful it was, they also felt excited. If they could build up that protection array, the defense of the Cloud Hall was surely strong enough to bear any hits from all sects in the Central Region.</p>

  <p>Because of this, it was worth setting up a protection array even though it would be costly.</p>

  <p>That was why Felix shut himself in his room and had not gone anywhere else. He kept himself busy with studying the protection array, wanting to set it up as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>He was in his room, pouring over his studies of the protection array when Tia called. In a moment, he flew to the ice palace as quickly as a beam of light. He bowed to Tia. "Miss, what can I do for you?"</p>

  <p>Tia nodded her head and asked, "Felix, how's your progress with the protection array I gave you?"</p>

  <p>"Miss, I am estimating what materials the protection array needs. I will give a list of all the materials needed later. But it will take some time to finish," Felix replied.</p>

  <p>"Okay. I need you to do another thing today," Tia said.</p>

  <p>Morphens looked at Tia curiously. 'Is it true that she will ask Felix to teach Luo Luo Zheng the skills of making runes?' he wondered. Then he heard Tia's words. "There is a young disciple who doesn't know how difficult it is to make runes and he wants to learn that skill. I'm asking you to give him a blow. It will be best if you can destroy his confidence in learning the skills of making runes and make him give up."</p>

  <p>Morphens nearly collapsed to his knees. He could not believe what he was hearing. The head of the Cloud Hall asked Felix to come over just for this? Tia was fussing over such a minor matter.</p>

  <p>'Okay. She is the head of the Cloud Hall. All of us should follow her instructions, ' Morphens thought, feeling helpless to do anything.</p>

  <p>Contrary to how Morphens felt about Tia's request, Felix seemed interested. "Miss, could I ask who this young disciple is? What star runes can he make?"</p>

  <p>"You probably have heard about him. His name is  Luo Luo Zheng Luo. As for the star of his works, I think he just started to learn the skill," Tia said with her lips pursed.</p>

  <p>Felix laughed and said, "I know him. He is that guy who claimed to challenge all of the disciples of the Elite House! I see. I promise you that I can destroy his confidence in learning the skills of drawing runes. He will give it up and never touch them again!"</p>

  <p>"Good. Now he is on the way to the market. You can go now," Tia said, nodding at him in dismissal. Tia believed Felix's skills of making runes without a doubt, or she would not give the protection array to him.</p>

  <p>After bidding farewell to Tia, Felix flew out of the ice palace and directly to the market. He was considering how he could go about finishing the work the head of the Cloud Hall had asked him to do.</p>

  <p>Having such a high level accomplishment of making runes, he thought it to be a piece of cake to destroy the confidence of a beginner. He was sure that he could even cause Luo Luo Zheng never to think about runes ever again.</p>

  <p>Soon, he arrived at the market; right at that moment, he spotted Luo Luo Zheng, who entered the shop of the World Commercial Alliance.</p>

  <p>'The fourth grade of the nature level. It must be Luo Luo Zheng, ' Felix told himself, seeing Luo Luo Zheng up ahead. There were few nature creatures in the Elite House and Luo Luo Zheng was the only one that was at the fourth grade. Felix went into that shop without any hesitation.</p>

  <p>The old man of the shop of the World Commercial Alliance was holding a brush pen and writing down the sentences from an ancient jade. He had memorized the words of the ancient divine race that Luo Luo Zheng had translated for him, and now he was trying to write them in the vernacular.</p>

  <p>Seeing Luo Luo Zheng come in, the old man was surprised, but he didn't ask why Luo Luo Zheng had come yet again. Instead, he bowed his head in greeting. "Mr.</p>

  <p>Luo! Nice to see you! What can I do for you today? Do you still want to buy some materials here?"</p>

  <p>'If Luo Luo Zheng really wants to learn the skills of making runes, the materials he bought yesterday should be enough for him to use for a long time, ' the old man thought to himself.</p>

  <p>Before Luo Luo Zheng could respond, there was a voice from outside. "Lasseter, long time no see. How are you these days?"</p>

  <p>So the old man was named Lasseter Shang. He always stayed in the shop in the Cloud Hall and Felix was the most famous runic expert who always came to his shop to buy something. Felix and Lasseter were on very familiar terms with each other.</p>

  <p>Hearing the voice, the old man recognized it as Felix's voice. A smile appeared on his face. Actually Lasseter was not always bad-tempered or he could not be the steward of the World Commercial Alliance.</p>

  <p>Customers like Felix were always welcomed in Lasseter's shop.</p>

  <p>"My business is just so-so. Please come here more frequently. We are all counting on you," Lasseter replied with a smile, gesturing to his men to fetch Felix some tea.</p>

  <p>As he entered the shop, Felix looked over at Luo Luo Zheng. He smiled. "And who is this young man, may I ask?"</p>

  <p>"He's a disciple of your Elite House. He just started to practice the skills of making runes. Oh, by the way, that reminds me..." Lasseter turned back to Luo Luo Zheng and said kindly, "This is the best runic expert in the Cloud Hall. Luo Luo Zheng, If you really want to learn the skill of making runes, it is a good idea to ask for his advice."</p>
