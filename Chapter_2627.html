  <p>
</p>

  <p>An exile as talented as Levi could travel a hundred million miles away in an instant.</p>

  <p>His talent didn't matter right now, though. As soon as the small, black, snake-like mists twined around his body, they held him firmly in place.</p>

  <p>"That, now that, is the Spiritual Snake Parasite! Emily, you..."</p>

  <p>Levi glanced at Emily nervously and confusedly.</p>

  <p>The Spiritual Snake Parasite was an extremely powerful technique.</p>

  <p>When performed by Emily in particular, it was even more impressive.</p>

  <p>When intertwined by the latter, even the Other Shore Realm master couldn't escape.</p>

  <p>The problem was that when Emily would use the Spiritual Snake Parasite on Luther, he would be bound to death. Could this mean that she had the intention of sacrificing him since the very beginning?</p>

  <p>How could she single him out? How did she choose to sacrifice Luther?</p>

  <p>Levi simply couldn't figure it out. It was incomprehensible.</p>

  <p>"Do you find it strange?" A smile finally spread across Emily's lips, brightening her already beautiful face.</p>

  <p>"Were you truly willing to kill Luther?" Levi asked, as he continued struggling to get free.</p>

  <p>"Why wouldn't I?" Emily's smile widened and she clapped her hands together at once.</p>

  <p>Not too far away, a figure could be seen slowly floating over to them. As the figure approached, they could see that it was Luther, equally wearing a smile on his face.</p>

  <p>As he looked at the approaching young man, Levi frowned and shook his head simultaneously. "It's impossible. They used the bloodline mark to confirm him... The one I killed couldn't have been a fake!"</p>

  <p>"And who said he was a fake?" Emily clapped her hands loudly again.</p>

  <p>Several other youths crept out from the other side where they had been hiding. They moved very slowly. They all had the exact same appearance, manner, and even cultivation base. They were all Luther.</p>

  <p>As the many Luther-copies walked gradually forward, Emily continued,</p>

  <p>"The moment I took him into the bone tower, I knew that there would be traitors. It's just that I couldn't be wary of everyone, and thus, I just let you expose yourselves instead... You did kill Luther himself, but I have a dozen of him!"</p>

  <p>Levi's jaw clenched and trembled as she spoke.</p>

  <p>"It isn't difficult for our Snake Goddess race to create the same bloodline, the same appearance, and even the same memories. Aren't I right?"</p>

  <p>Emily went on speaking, the smile on her lips never disappearing.</p>

  <p>Levi remained silent for a short while. No matter what, he had failed.</p>

  <p>As the realization that he couldn't escape death washed over him, his eyes suddenly lit up with two flame clouds.</p>

  <p>Sizzle! Sizzle...</p>

  <p>Deep-gold blazing flames rose on the surface of his entire body.</p>

  <p>The scorching temperature from the fire quickly spread out, causing the temperature of the entire cave to rise rapidly.</p>

  <p>Ultimately understanding that there was no possible escape, Levi was determined to give it his all.</p>

  <p>The other elders of the Snake Goddess race had all retreated. Emily sneered, "Is resisting really worthwhile at this point?"</p>

  <p>With no warning whatsoever, a dazzling light shot out from her fingertips and enveloped Levi completely.</p>

  <p>Among all the exiles, Levi was definitely not the weakest, but he had no chance of fighting back now.</p>

  <p>When Timotheus noticed what was going on, he too, felt secretly shocked.</p>

  <p>Despite the fact that he knew he had the capacity to kill Levi, he was also well aware that doing so wouldn't be the easiest of tasks. Although Levi knew Emily was more powerful than him, he hadn't expected that after all these years, Emily's strength would have become so unfathomable.</p>

  <p>Hoo, hoo, hoo!</p>

  <p>The light wrapped tightly around Levi suddenly swelled before beginning to contract rapidly and dramatically.</p>

  <p>When the light couldn't become any smaller, a screech sounded loudly and Levi disappeared, leaving no trace behind.</p>

  <p>The fact that Emily had just killed a master of the Other Shore Realm so easily shocked the exiles of other races. As they watched, their pupils dilated vaguely, and fear could be seen in their eyes.</p>

  <p>"Even now, I still can't completely trust all of you," Emily uttered, looking around at the remaining exiles. "I hope you can seize the opportunity this time around. If you choose to turn to the other side, that's your right, but I believe you'd regret such a decision."</p>

  <p>As she finished speaking, she took two light steps forward. A rainbow appeared in front of her and she climbed into it immediately.</p>

  <p>"Well, Levi betrayed us and he thus deserved it!"</p>

  <p>"Just moments ago, I still thought that Luther was really dead. I've never been so startled..."</p>

  <p>"Same here..."</p>

  <p>Confronted by Levi's death, the exiles on scene sighed loudly, shaking their heads in remorse.</p>

  <p>"Everybody, we'd better stay in our own bone tower, and don't pull any stupid tricks. Let's wait until the Light of Adjudication is over. To avoid suspicion..." Timotheus said to the crowd.</p>

  <p>Even he exclaimed that it was a wise choice to have come to the Snake Goddess race to persuade this race to join him.</p>

  <p>It was likely that protecting Luther with the Nine Li race alone was going to be a difficult feat.</p>

  <p>At that, all the exiles left the Torrent Bone Tower, ready to receive the Light of Adjudication.</p>

  <p>Inside the Pyramid Bone Tower, Spark still sat on the mountain's peak.</p>

  <p>Now, there was no expression on his calm face.</p>

  <p>By contrast, the other exiles of the Yellow Emperor race all wore dark, somber expressions.</p>

  <p>"I thought it'd be easy for Levi to succeed at such a short distance. I didn't expect that Emily would be even more cunning!"</p>

  <p>"She is absolutely formidable! Today, we've succeeded in completely offending the Snake Goddess race. If they come looking for trouble after the Light of Adjudication, that will really be a cause for concern!"</p>

  <p>"Spark, tell us, what do you think we should do?"</p>

  <p>Although these exiles had firmly and devotedly followed Spark, they were still afraid of the Snake Goddess race and Emily, and with reason.</p>

  <p>As he heard the question being asked, Spark raised his eyebrows slightly.</p>

  <p>"Looking for trouble? They are too busy escaping the world to come looking for us."</p>

  <p>After hearing what Spark had to say, the other exiles still didn't change their sullen expressions.</p>

  <p>At that exact moment though, the man sporting a black robe from the Warden race appeared at the top of the mountain again.</p>

  <p>The black-robed man looked down upon Spark and stated flatly, "You failed."</p>

  <p>Spark simply blinked his eyes and answered, "It's perfectly normal.</p>

  <p>Emily is a very vigilant person. In fact, it would be strange if I succeeded easily."</p>

  <p>"What's your next move going to be, then?" the black-robed man questioned.</p>

  <p>In terms of the strategy for assassinating Luther, the Warden race wasn't much helpful. All they did was plant a bloodline mark in the assassins' mind. They weren't prepared for the dozen Luther replicates that Emily had created.</p>

  <p>"We'll discuss that after the Light of Adjudication is over," said Spark, with a gleam of danger in his eyes. "That said, you'll have to give me more authority and help. Otherwise, it'll be difficult to deal with that crazy woman on my own."</p>

  <p>Emily was extremely powerful. Clearly, even Spark was afraid of facing such a woman without immediate backup.</p>

  <p>"Okay," the black-robed man answered in a faint voice, "I just hope you won't disappoint me."</p>

  <p>At that, he slowly disappeared.</p>

  <p>Three days later, a milky white light slowly rose from the east of the world. It gradually made its way toward the west.</p>

  <p>The light contained the Power of Purification, which was almost infinite.</p>

  <p>Its power would purify all living creatures, except for the unintelligent Wights.</p>

  <p>No matter if one flew to the top of the world or hid in the deepest underground cave, escaping the fate of being purified was completely impossible.</p>

  <p>Aside from those who hid in the bone towers, the other creatures could hide nowhere but accept their situation, waiting for the purification to come to them.</p>
