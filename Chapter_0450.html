<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>There were hundreds of ways to use a sword and a hundred other ways to use it spiritually. The swordsmanship Tianming had been practicing was called Heavenly Sword. This was a very potent cultivation method that did not belong to tier 4 or tier 5. In fact, even the second tier methods did not contain this illustration, simply because of the fact that the method did not belong to any tier at all.</p>

  <p>This cultivation method was highly special— it was constituted by only one illustration, which was called the Heavenly Sword Illustration.</p>

  <p>The illustrious method had turned up around eight hundred and seventy-five years ago, and at that time, it had stirred up quite a bit of turmoil in the eastern region.</p>

  <p>The noble clans, the Burning Sky Palace, the Cloud Sect, and all the independent mighty practitioners as well which were scattered across the numerous counties of Eastern Region had chased it like a lion chased its prey. They had been extremely eager and the illustration had seen its fair share of blood. Rumor had it that the Heavenly Sword Illustration contained a powerful theurgy; if one mastered it, he/she would grasp the concepts of heavens and attain immortality!</p>

  <p>Hundreds, thousands... No one knew just how many outstanding figures lost their life to the battle for this illustration.</p>

  <p>In the end, it had been Cloud Sect itself which had managed to defeat all other competitors and obtained the Heavenly Sword Illustration. Later on, it was sent to the Burning Sky Palace for safe keeping.</p>

  <p>The news had made a lot of practitioners grind their teeth in resentment.</p>

  <p>They wanted the illustration for themselves but they could not afford to mess with Cloud Sect or Burning Sky Palace. None of them had ever dared to break into the heavily guarded Burning Sky Palace and try to steal the Heavenly Sword Illustration. People had thought it was going to be hidden forever but things had gone South.</p>

  <p>Exactly one year later, several copies of the Heavenly Sword Illustration appeared in market! It was said that those copies had been leaked from the Burning Sky Palace itself!</p>

  <p>Why the palace leaked the copy of such a powerful method, no one had a clue. Rumors said it wasn't intentional. But the practitioners had still scrambled for them, even though they were just copies! If they failed to get one by force, they were even willing to pay a high price to buy one.</p>

  <p>A simple piece of paper, available in trash cans, once printed with the illustration could go for as high as the equivalent of about six hundred pounds of pure gold.</p>

  <p>The practitioners still didn't find the price outrageous, even though the common folks of the city said that it was appalling even for such a powerful cultivation method.</p>

  <p>Several business minded clans and merchants had bought a copy with a large sum of fortune, and then made several more of it to sell on their terms. Even at half price, the sheer demand was so high that they made another fortune with it.</p>

  <p>Pretty soon, there came a time when almost everyone in the Eastern Region had managed to land himself a copy of the Heavenly Sword Illustration. The parchment then became like salt and its price began to plummet. Slowly the 600 pounds equivalent price turned into a single figure.</p>

  <p>This had happened because, being a simple piece of paper in the first place, there were now too many people who were producing copies of the illustration.</p>

  <p>That was only the secondary reason. A far more important reason arose when every single practitioner found that he or she just could not figure out a single thing about the Heavenly Sword from the Heavenly Sword Illustration...</p>

  <p>They failed to understand it no matter how hard they tried, and had no clue what the heck it was...</p>

  <p>Feeling that they had been fooled, those practitioners naturally became angry and dumped the Heavenly Sword Illustration on streets and in skewers as if it was nothing but trash.</p>

  <p>This way, the highly powerful cultivation method found itself as the most widespread one among the Eastern Region, and also the cheapest one.</p>

  <p>It was possible to practice this cultivation method, that much was certain.</p>

  <p>But the ability and the talent that its comprehension required was just too much for any one to master.</p>

  <p>In the last eight centuries, among millions of practitioners in the Eastern Region, there had been three extraordinary guys who had successfully managed to master the method against all odds.</p>

  <p>Zeki Zhu who lived 633 years ago, Matias Xuanyuan from 400 years ago, and Zain Ao from about a 100 years ago were the only ones to have mastered it. Till now.</p>

  <p>And even though the three were all highly gifted, they had still only managed to learn three parts. The Megrez Sword, the Dubhe Sword, and the Merak Sword were the first three parts of the method but not the complete story. One could combine the whole into one if only one were gifted enough.</p>

  <p>In so many generations throughout history, the three had only learnt the first three parts. From that legend, it was easy to imagine just how hard it was to practice the complete Heavenly Sword. And that was why few practitioners chose to practice this impressive cultivation method in spite of the easy access to its Illustration— it was just not designed for ordinary people! Its legend had spread far and wide and finally, after 875 years, Tianming had achieved the fourth part of the method!</p>

  <p>"The fourth part, it's the fourth part! Tianming has grasped the fourth part</p>

  <p>— Phecda Sword— of the Heavenly Sword Illustration! Good heavens!</p>

  <p>He is the first one to manage that in 800 years!"</p>

  <p>"Yeah, he is going to be a legend! Hang on. It seems like Tianming has not only been able to grasp the fourth part, he is going to display the four swords all at once. He is gonna merge the four swords and use them all at once! Zheng is a goner now for sure!"</p>

  <p>"I agree. Now Zheng is going to be in trouble. You know, I once heard that each part of the Heavenly Sword can draw support from the power of the heavens. It is said that any practitioner who can manage the Heavenly Sword is a man favored by God, or we could call him son of God. Once the four swords are out, Zheng will definitely lose!"</p>

  <p>"At first I thought that Zheng was the one more powerful between the two, but I think we now know that in front of Tianming, Zheng has no chance at all!"</p>

  <p>A tiny shadow of a seed suddenly burst open before Tianming. Then, a fine tread emerged on the top of his head and abruptly shot up into the sky. In an instant, a gigantic whirlwind tornado appeared in the sky. As it came into being, it cascaded down towards the ground at a furious pace.</p>
