<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Strictly speaking, the opening of the world of chaos in the universe was an imminent crisis.</p>

  <p>Before the danger arrived, the heavens had sensed it and let the great luck reach the remarkable and matchless talents in the universe.</p>

  <p>This meant that those talents had the fate to lead the world of chaos.</p>

  <p>Those who possessed good fortune would go on to become the great men and women of the era. Their luck was different from that of ordinary people.</p>

  <p>However, there was still a chance that the one with the fate to lead the world of chaos would die. With the advent of the world of chaos, those warriors destined to fight would compete with each other and strive to become the main characters of the world.</p>

  <p>It was said that such a person would lead the races to combat the great danger that was going to befall the universe...</p>

  <p>The opening of the Illusion Battlefield would enable the warriors to compete with each other. The most powerful talent of the grand era would then be selected during the battle.</p>

  <p>In these five years, besides cultivating, Luo Luo Zheng had used the Roaring Token to tell stories...</p>

  <p>However, the mysterious young girl did not have enough time daily. She seemed to spend most of it sleeping and cultivating, waking up once or twice every other year.</p>

  <p>The first thing she did when she woke up was to force Luo Luo Zheng to tell her stories.</p>

  <p>At this time, Luo Luo Zheng too asked the mysterious girl for any information regarding Yan.</p>

  <p>The young girl told Luo Luo Zheng that she had entrusted the search for Yan to others, but had not received any response yet.</p>

  <p>Even though Luo Luo Zheng was disappointed, he was still willing to tell stories.</p>

  <p>He was unable to confirm anything at present, but the world above the heavens was still too ethereal to him. That mystifying world was something that even the one hundred and twenty-eight Supreme Lords knew nothing about...</p>

  <p>Perhaps only this mysterious young girl could help him find Yan.</p>

  <p>As the heavens shook, indicating the opening of the Illusion Battlefield, the mysterious young girl woke up once again. However, this time, she did not rush to ask Luo Luo Zheng to tell her a story. Instead, she announced in a strange, cold voice, "The Illusion Battlefield has opened. This time, the battlefield would accept all Soul Sea Realm warriors of the universe..."</p>

  <p>As the mysterious young girl finished speaking, all the stars spun speedily.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng opened his eyes. He was sitting on the square of the fairy palace...</p>

  <p>"The Illusion Battlefield is your opportunity to shine. If you were to obtain a good ranking in the battle, the world lords guarding outside would leave soon..." Xun spoke flatly as she glanced at the stars in the sky.</p>

  <p>"I have tricked and killed the Supreme Lords of their races. Would they be willing to leave without avenging them? Would Yao let us off the hook as well?" Luo Luo Zheng asked. At this moment, he had no idea what the Illusion Battlefield was all about.</p>

  <p>Xun smiled faintly. "Yao, of course, is unwilling to let go of us.</p>

  <p>She will never abandon her desire to kill me... However, perhaps to appease her race members for a while, she would choose to give in."</p>

  <p>"I see." Luo Luo Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>Not long after, the stars in the sky began to shine brighter and brighter...</p>

  <p>Thin light spots shot down unceasingly...</p>

  <p>The number of Soul Sea Realm warriors in the one hundred thousand supreme worlds was too high. Each light spot corresponded to a Soul Sea Realm warrior.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>A circular light spot appeared in front of Luo Luo Zheng. Without hesitation, he stepped into it and sat down.</p>

  <p>At the same time, a circular light spot appeared in front of Freya. Her face betrayed a hint of doubt as she considered if she should enter the light spot or not.</p>

  <p>Xun glanced at Freya. Although Freya's talent was not great, she was still very intelligent. Among all the women around Luo Luo Zheng, she was the only one Xun did not despise. "The Illusion Battlefield is, in fact, a giant Illusion Space, where there is no danger to life," Xun told her.</p>

  <p>"However, for warriors of the Soul Sea Realm like you, it is also an excellent cultivation opportunity that you must not miss."</p>

  <p>"Illusion Space?"</p>

  <p>Freya had heard of the Illusion Space before. However, she had not been in the Upper World for long. So far, she had never entered the Illusion Space. Upon hearing Xun mention it in relation to the Illusion Battlefield, she was somewhat perplexed.</p>

  <p>However, Xun did not want to explain further. Whether or not Freya was willing to enter the Illusion Battlefield was entirely her own decision.</p>

  <p>Freya hesitated for a moment. Since Xun had pointed out that the Illusion Space was not dangerous, and seeing that Luo Luo Zheng had already entered the battlefield, she chose to enter it as well.</p>

  <p>Countless light spots appeared around all Soul Sea Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>In the Purple Power World.</p>

  <p>This strange little world was not counted among the one hundred thousand supreme worlds.</p>

  <p>On the top of the Apeiron Tower, Mu Ning sat on a giant sword.</p>

  <p>Countless gigantic swords spiraled around her.</p>

  <p>She looked much more mature and less gentle than how she was a few years ago.</p>

  <p>Her incomparably beautiful face looked charming under the shine of the sword light...</p>

  <p>By now, her cultivation base had reached the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>With a slight wave of her hand, hundreds of thousands of swords surged forward at the same time. Soon after, they converged to form a unique sword array that surrounded her.</p>

  <p>At first glance, the sword formation was nothing extraordinary, but when Mu Ning stood up and casually waved her hands about, the Mu Ning of the sword array underwent a tremendous change. The sword array emitted a strong killing intent.</p>

  <p>As she controlled the sword array, a lonely expression surfaced on her face. She seemed a bit aloof.</p>

  <p>It had been seven years since Mu Ning and Luo Luo Zheng separated.</p>

  <p>All these years, she had missed Luo Luo Zheng to pieces. She had also waited for the Illusion Battlefield to open.</p>

  <p>Her master had told her that when the Illusion Battlefield came upon them, Luo Luo Zheng would be sure to step inside. That would be when they met each other.</p>

  <p>But when exactly would the Illusion Battlefield open?</p>

  <p>At the thought of this, Mu Ning, who was performing the sword array, got a bit morose. With a flip of her slender and delicate fingers, she made a posture. She tried to keep calm. The giant swords turned over at the same time, forming a flat barrier above the Apeiron Tower. These giant swords seemed to consider Mu Ning their queen. They subserviently submitted to her.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning crouched and hugged her knees. Once she started to miss Luo Luo Zheng, it was difficult for her to stop thinking of him. Luo Zheng's clear and shadowy figure continuously flashed through her mind.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Elder Apeiron appeared behind Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>"Master..." Mu Ning did not turn back, but she could feel the movement behind her.</p>

  <p>With a benevolent look on her face, Elder Apeiron walked toward Mu Ning, asking, "Mu Ning, what's wrong?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing..." All these years, Mu Ning had firmly reinforced her warrior spirit and rarely complained. Sometimes she felt depressed, but she knew how to disguise her emotions.</p>

  <p>However, Elder Apeiron smiled. "Are you thinking of Luo Luo Zheng again?"</p>

  <p>"No," Mu Ning replied immediately.</p>

  <p>"I believe you miss him very much. I have had such an experience before, so I understand your feelings," Elder Apeiron said kindly.</p>

  <p>Hearing these words, Mu Ning got even more upset. She sniffled a little and said, "I miss him, but it is useless... I have no clue where he is!"</p>

  <p>Elder Apeiron placed her withered hand on Margaret's shoulder. "Luo Luo Zheng might have already entered the Illusion Battlefield," she pointed out.</p>

  <p>"Huh?" Surprised, Mu Ning raised her head and looked at Elder Apeiron.</p>

  <p>"The Illusion Battlefield has been opened now?"</p>

  <p>"Yes!"</p>

  <p>"How exciting. It really opened!" Mu Ning was so enthusiastic that she almost jumped up.</p>

  <p>She had been waiting for this day for a long time.</p>

  <p>Elder Apeiron nodded with certainty. "All Soul Sea Realm warriors can enter the Illusion Battlefield. You are in the Purple Power World, where the spots of light cannot shoot in. Once I take you out of the Purple Power World, you can enter the Illusion Battlefield as well."</p>

  <p>"Are you sure Luo Luo Zheng can enter the Illusion Battlefield too?" Mu Ning was still unsure.</p>

  <p>Elder Apeiron gave her a small smile. "I am not sure if he can enter the Illusion Battlefield right at this moment, but I am sure he will enter it sooner or later! However, If you want to meet him, you have to rely on your own strength for an opportunity to come."</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Mu Ning was confident. "Okay. Master, I understand! I will put my best foot forward in the Illusion Battlefield."</p>

  <p>Seeing Margaret's confidence, Elder Apeiron nodded in satisfaction. "I believe you can obtain a good outcome. You are my most outstanding disciple yet. You also have the most powerful Purple Power Body. I hope you can succeed this time. Now, let's go. It's time for me to get you out of the Purple Power World..."</p>

  <p>In the last five years, Luo Luo Zheng had used the Roaring Token many times in the universe. So how could Elder Apeiron, who often left the Purple Power World, not know of Luo Zheng's movements?</p>

  <p>In fact, she was even aware that Luo Luo Zheng had been besieged by the world lords of several races in the Northern Sky Region...</p>

  <p>However, to make sure that Mu Ning focused on her cultivation, Elder Apeiron did not want to convey this piece of information to Mu Ning. If Mu Ning was strong enough, she would meet Luo Luo Zheng in the Illusion Battlefield easily.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning strode forward, now prepared to leave the Purple Power World with her master. She looked at the world covered in purple halos, her heart full of strong emotions. She knew that her journey was about to begin, and that she was about to search for Luo Luo Zheng.</p>
