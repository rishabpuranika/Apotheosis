<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 279 Argument (Part Two) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>However, he knew better than to test the temper of the young man, Bob.</p>

  <p>The disciples from the noble clans would never listen to someone they thought was beneath them.</p>

  <p>Moreover, he knew that Bob had gotten into fights before regarding who should be prioritized to enter the Lake of the Magical Fish. His disputes always led to more trouble. Bob had an infamous temper.</p>

  <p>Today, he found it distasteful to wait for fifteen minutes for someone.</p>

  <p>That said a lot about him.</p>

  <p>Bob pulled a long face, his lips twisting with disdain. Usually, he was the man who was waited upon, even at odd hours of the day. How dare they ask him to wait for someone else for so long?</p>

  <p>"Hasn't the disciple come out yet? Cao, you said he would come out at four p.m., didn't you? It's already four now," Bob reminded him in an unpleasant tone.</p>

  <p>Steward Cao straightened sheepishly, a reassuring smile on his face.</p>

  <p>"Please wait for a minute. Just one more minute. He should come out soon."</p>

  <p>Brusquely, Bob got up. "I won't wait for him any longer! The time is up.</p>

  <p>You should force him out now by using the magic array plate."</p>

  <p>"I- I..." steward Cao stammered, his mouth gaping, not knowing what to say. Bob left him in a fix. He would undoubtedly offend Luo Luo Zheng if he pushed him out through the magic array, but it would vex Bob if he didn't listen to his command.</p>

  <p>It wouldn't be too consequential if he offended Luo Luo Zheng now, who was just an outer disciple at present. He wouldn't pose a threat to Cao's position. But if he offended Bob, and Bob told his elders about the incident, he could make Cao's life at Cloud Sect difficult.</p>

  <p>Appearing to think for a moment, steward Cao came to a decision.</p>

  <p>Neither of his options was likable, but he must choose the one that would bring him less harm. He would have to displease Luo Luo Zheng today.</p>

  <p>He opened the magic array plate, about to reach out to pull Luo Luo Zheng out of the Lake of the Magical Fish.</p>

  <p>But before he could do so, Roger, who was next to him, halted him in his action. "Steward Cao, you don't need to be in such a rush."</p>

  <p>Steward Cao widened his eyes. "But, but..." Roger's words made his head spin. Roger was always friendly and courteous to him, but he was also a disciple from one of the top seven noble clans. If Cao could not afford to offend the Pei clan, he could not afford to do the same with the Meng clan either.</p>

  <p>Bob threw Roger a cold look. He had spotted the Meng boy as soon as he got here.</p>

  <p>The two families were always at odds with each other. The elders always had control over their tempers and they were cordial outwardly. They only expressed their displeasure and disagreements in hushed whispers and backhanded wisecracks.</p>

  <p>However, the tempers of the younger lot were not easy to restrain. There had been many brawls between the young members of the families on several occasions in the Imperial Capital.</p>

  <p>Bob had turned a blind eye to Roger when he saw him first.</p>

  <p>He came here to train today, so he had no reason to argue with Roger. He had hoped that Roger would stay quiet so neither of them would have cause to encroach on the precincts of the other.</p>

  <p>But he hadn't expected Roger to provoke him by interrupting steward Cao when he was about to use the magic array. Was Roger so eager to get into an argument with him?</p>

  <p>Bob knew Roger's strength was far inferior to his. If a fight were to happen between them, Roger would undoubtedly be at a disadvantage.</p>

  <p>An image of the arrogant faces of the Meng family members rose up in his mind. It would do him good to teach Roger a lesson today, for the mere fact that he dared to argue with him!</p>

  <p>"Roger, you know it's time for me to train. I can't wait for the boy forever if he has no plans of coming out," Bob said, his voice slightly shaking with anger.</p>

  <p>Roger shook his head indifferently. "The disciple in the lake is my friend, and he has no intention of taking up your time. He reserved two hours, but it seems that the time did not end up being enough for him. Don't worry. I will pay for the extra hours on his behalf. I have enough points that can be docked."</p>

  <p>Bob stilled, and the look he threw Roger was chilling. "Your points? You think you can pay for the extra hours he uses? Cao, is this permissible?"</p>

  <p>Steward Cao had an anxious look on his face. He glanced at Bob before speaking to Roger, "Roger, I think I need to ask your friend to come out now. After all, the time he reserved is over."</p>

  <p>"What? Can't I add more time on his behalf? I have plenty of points. You can take as many as you want. Not just two hours, my points are enough to pay for twenty more! You can keep docking them until Luo Luo Zheng comes out of the lake," Roger said, his face hard.</p>

  <p>He was always polite and kind, but when someone angered him, he could get quite overbearing.</p>

  <p>Steward Cao was in an awful dilemma. He had no clue about what to do.</p>

  <p>He wanted to start the magic array and pull Luo Luo Zheng out, but looking at the expression on Roger's face, he dared not to do it. On the other hand, it was not possible for him to dissuade Bob either. He knew all about Bob's terrible temper.</p>

  <p>"They say that the Meng family members are good at assessing a situation and judging what to do, but I don't think you are quite adept at it," sneered Bob, a look of hatred in his eyes as he stared at Roger.</p>

  <p>Momentum slowly built up in his body as the words escaped him. He had reached the nature level consummation, which was only one step away from the Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>Roger stood up the moment he heard what Bob said, his eyes too darkening with malice. "You dare to fight me on the Cloud Sect grounds?</p>

  <p>Do you know the price you'll pay for that transgression?"</p>
