<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2150 Throwing Him Out (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The old man had already been a True God for many years now, and he was currently stuck in the 'two taboos' of the Five Elements Godly Way.</p>

  <p>These two taboos respectively referred to the fire-wood taboo and the water-earth taboo! They were easier said than done.</p>

  <p>Due to these two taboos, the old man was having difficulties improving his cultivation base and thus making a breakthrough in his Godly Tile.</p>

  <p>Common proving godly warriors weren't actually aware that these two taboos existed. Even if a small number of proving godly warriors had gotten wind of them in the past, they wouldn't have the capacities of understanding what the two taboos meant. That was, until now, of course. The young proving godly warrior in front of them now was capable of seeing through these two taboos with a single sentence. This had greatly shocked the old man.</p>

  <p>In fact, there was a reason why the old man was unable to break down these two taboos. Furthermore, here in the divine land, only the Taboo-breaking Pill had the power to break them down.</p>

  <p>The Taboo-breaking Pill was actually a fusion of the Wood-melting Pill and the Water-dissolving Pill, which were respectively made of the Fire-shaped Bird's ever-burning comb and the Earth Barbarian Beast's heart.</p>

  <p>After consuming the Taboo-breaking Pill, a warrior would have a thirty percent chance of breaking down the two taboos. It wasn't much, but it was better than nothing.</p>

  <p>However, both the Wood-melting Pill and the Water-dissolving Pill were five times refined pills. Once the two kinds of pills fused together and refined each other, they would become a six times refined pill— the Taboo-breaking Pill. A six times refined pill was far from something that a lower level True God in the Heavenly Han House could possess.</p>

  <p>The old man had been diligently working in the Heavenly Han House for more than half a divine era now, but he had only saved enough money for one Wood-melting Pill.</p>

  <p>Even if he could also afford a single Water-dissolving Pill, he would still have to spend more money in order to hire a pill refiner who would fuse the two pills together. One way or another, the costs were high.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, those who had a good pair of eyes were respected.</p>

  <p>Although the old man was a bit harsh, his tone appeared a bit calmer after Luo Zheng spoke so easily of his bottleneck. It was safe to say that his tone was still flat, if not cold as he said, "So what if I'm restrained by the two taboos? What's wrong with my Godly Way?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled and calmly replied, "Sir, you know that according to what you taught us, we will definitely be stuck by the two taboos. Isn't that the problem of your Godly Way?"</p>

  <p>"Humph. With so many True Gods practicing the Five Elements Godly Way, how many warriors have actually managed to overcome these two taboos? You're just messing around with me! Somebody, get this guy out of here!" As the old man shouted, two people rushed out of the Heavenly Han House. The two individuals were low-rank True Gods and their expressions were cold, their gazes sharp like blades. Apparently, they were the Han Clan's guards and they seemed to mean business.</p>

  <p>"Wait a moment," said Luo Zheng, as he waved his hand slightly in the air. "Sir, I said that according to your method of practicing the Godly Way, sooner or later, we'd be bound to meet up with the two taboos. That's because you only know one way to break them down, right? Correct me if I'm wrong, of course."</p>

  <p>The old man only raised his eyebrows without saying a word and then stretched out his hand to stop the Han Clan's guards. He stared at Luo Zheng and sneered, "Could it be that you have some sort of brilliant idea? Do you know the second way of solving it?"</p>

  <p>The many proving godly warriors in the area looked at Luo Zheng, with a look of derision on their faces.</p>

  <p>Despite their expressions, Luo Zheng did question the old man's lecture without a hitch, and this surprised the proving godly warriors. The old man was a True God who taught the Godly Way. He might not have had great strength, but he did have solid comprehension of the Godly Way, and was the most adept at explaining such theories.</p>

  <p>Astonished, these proving godly warriors felt a trace of jealousy towards Luo Zheng, which was something they'd never admit to. Now that he had spoken a few of his opinionated words, Luo Zheng was to be driven away, which of course pleased the proving godly warriors.</p>

  <p>"This is what we call showing off one's incompetence in the presence of an expert. Ha-ha!" the bald warrior laughed.</p>

  <p>Surprisingly, Luo Zheng cupped his hands as a faint smile spread across his face. "Although I am a proving godly warrior, I also have a little comprehension of the Five Elements Godly Way. There really is a second way to overcome the two taboos, and this method doesn't need to rely on the Taboo-breaking Pill," he stated slowly, making sure everyone was listening to him.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! Yah, right!" Upon hearing Zheng's words, the old man let out a series of mocking sneers.</p>

  <p>The sullen faces of the two guards from the Heavenly Han House standing beside the old man couldn't help but crack a smile, too.</p>

  <p>In fact, every one of the proving godly warriors burst into laughter along with him. They ridiculed Luo Zheng— what a joke he was!</p>

  <p>Once the old man's laugh tingled off, he suddenly spoke in a contrasting, cold voice, "According to your bones, you're not old at all. Why don't you spend your time learning to do things the right way instead of becoming a liar? I want to hear what kind of method you've come up with for breaking down the two taboos. We all want to hear it, really."</p>

  <p>At this, Luo Zheng didn't appear flustered at all. Instead, he calmly replied,</p>

  <p>"When a warrior has just learned the Five Elements Godly Way, their Godly Tile has two cracks in it because the five elements are mixed. Fire and wood are hard to merge together, and earth and water repel each other. Thus, these two cracks lead to two taboos! The Five Elements Godly Way has been passed down for generations and generations, and countless proving godly warriors have tried to prove the Godly Way with the ancient method. Despite that though, they didn't think of another solution and had never been able to avoid these two taboos! And that's why you were wrong to only follow what is recorded on the Godly Way Tablet.</p>
