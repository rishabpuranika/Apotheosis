<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Does this token allow one to launch an attack by merely speaking?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng asked, astonishment written all over his face.</p>

  <p>He was aware of Yan possessing a Purple Power Body.</p>

  <p>However, he didn't know much regarding what skills she practiced.</p>

  <p>When he asked Yan about this, she simply hummed and avoided giving him any definite reply.</p>

  <p>She had been extremely vague with her answers, even when Luo Zheng asked her about their mother.</p>

  <p>It seemed he couldn't see through his sister anymore.</p>

  <p>When Yan launched her attack by speaking, Luo Zheng expected some energy fluctuation. However, there was none at all.</p>

  <p>For example, when one practiced the Great Dominance Technique, it was possible to activate it just by speaking. However, this could only be done through a special method of mixing the Divine Dao and mental attacks. It was still a certain kind of mental attack.</p>

  <p>Yan's method was formidable. Her word was 'annihilate' and it had been enough to cause all these Fanged Cicadas to immediately drop dead.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng could only look at his sister's back, lost in his thoughts.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>Nobody else noticed what Yan had just done, except Luo Zheng of course.</p>

  <p>The entire situation was just too chaotic.</p>

  <p>More and more top-rank True Gods fell prey to the Fanged Cicadas and were exploding left and right.</p>

  <p>The explosions were also a hazard to the other nearby True Gods. Once injured, they were immediately the next target for the Fanged Cicadas.</p>

  <p>However, those who died were the top-rank True Gods of the first-tier clans.</p>

  <p>All the rich and powerful clans on the Floating Islands had prepared their disciples extensively for this competition.</p>

  <p>Thus, in the face of such a sudden crisis, they naturally had a couple of tricks up their sleeves.</p>

  <p>Duke, for one, summoned a group of palm-sized birds from his chest.</p>

  <p>These birds flew all around him. Any Fanged Cicada that ventured too close would get swallowed up by the birds.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the three top-rank True Gods of the Bai Clan were arranged in a triangle, surrounded by sharp rays of light.</p>

  <p>This sharp light kept the Fanged Cicadas away.</p>

  <p>Although the True Gods of those first-tier clans would've also been prepared, their inheritances were most likely weaker than that of the rich clans on the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>It was unavoidable that, despite trying their very best, some of the top-rank True Gods ended up perishing under the onslaught of the Fanged Cicadas.</p>

  <p>Their heads were all pierced and their cinnabar fields exploded.</p>

  <p>"Boom... Boom!"</p>

  <p>The speed at which everyone fell had gotten faster but the explosions were also getting more and more numerous.</p>

  <p>"Hold on, guys!"</p>

  <p>Reinhard shouted as he waved his sword.</p>

  <p>Each slash released dozens of silver light that cut through hundreds of Fanged Cicadas in one fell swoop.</p>

  <p>However, more Fanged Cicadas took the place of their fallen brethren.</p>

  <p>"Puff!"</p>

  <p>Reinhard heard a muffled sound and couldn't help but whip his head towards the direction he heard it from.</p>

  <p>"Lorenzo!"</p>

  <p>Lorenzo Mo of the Sword Clan couldn't answer to his call. He simply trembled as a small, bloody hole appeared in the middle of his forehead.</p>

  <p>Without wasting any time, Reinhard immediately slashed towards Lorenzo's direction.</p>

  <p>Before he could explode, a wisp of silver light from Reinhard's sword cut his head off from his body.</p>

  <p>The Sword Clan had finally lost its first disciple.</p>

  <p>"How could this be?"</p>

  <p>Reinhard's heart sank. Lorenzo Mo was not weak yet he perished in such a crisis. He and Reinhard were not from the same branch but shared a good relationship with each other.</p>

  <p>His death greatly upset Reinhard.</p>

  <p>The beginning of the debate over the Divine Dao was usually smooth. This great crisis truly caught everyone by surprise. Were they to die here so early into the competition?</p>

  <p>"Swish, swish, swish..."</p>

  <p>Try as they might, the number of Fanged Cicadas only seemed to increase as they ventured farther down.</p>

  <p>The swarm was like a storm cloud that quickly shot towards the True Gods.</p>

  <p>Reinhard's sword might be fast but it would be impossible for him to kill all these Fanged Cicadas. He wasn't entirely impervious to these creatures.</p>

  <p>He could only despair, unable to see any hope in this situation.</p>

  <p>It was then that Yan appeared.</p>

  <p>The sight of her and her brother alive comforted Reinhard. "They're alright."</p>

  <p>He initially thought that these Fanged Cicadas was a test for these two. He didn't expect them to actually be capable in handling themselves so smartly in such a crisis.</p>

  <p>"Hide behind me! Stop!" Reinhard howled.</p>

  <p>However, to his surprise, Yan simply ignored him. She moved lithely in the air, her soft hair fluttering in the wind as she flew.</p>

  <p>Yan put her long fingers to her mouth and uttered a single word.</p>

  <p>"Entangle."</p>

  <p>This time, Luo Zheng still didn't make a move.</p>

  <p>He allowed his sister to go on ahead but also kept an eye out to his surroundings. Once a Fanged Cicada came near, he would act immediately.</p>

  <p>As he defended himself, he also observed Yan secretly.</p>

  <p>"She utters a word but the voice has no emotion in it. It's as if she's not the one speaking..." he murmured.</p>

  <p>The moment Yan spoke, tiny whirlpools appeared in the air.</p>

  <p>There was one whirlpool...</p>

  <p>There were one hundred whirlpools...</p>

  <p>Over one thousand...</p>

  <p>Tens of thousands of whirlpools...</p>

  <p>These whirlpools were only the size of a fist but emitted a very strong gravitational force that sucked the Fanged Cicadas in.</p>

  <p>Yan merely floated there as the whirlpools continued to appear around everyone.</p>

  <p>The previously innumerable Fanged Cicadas started to dwindle as they were sucked in.</p>

  <p>The sight of these miraculous whirlpools caught the top-rank True Gods in surprise. They absolutely had no idea where these came from!</p>

  <p>"It's her!"</p>

  <p>"It's the woman below!"</p>

  <p>They all exclaimed, pointing at Yan.</p>

  <p>There was no evidence of energy fluctuation around her, but they were able to confirm that it was her that created these whirlpools.</p>

  <p>"This woman... Wow, she's so powerful. She's already saved me five times!"</p>

  <p>Enoch announced. He had been quite frightened before but was now very excited at Yan's appearance.</p>

  <p>"You..."</p>

  <p>Reinhard looked at Yan with a complicated expression on his face.</p>

  <p>He didn't believe her token was powerful but it was extremely unbelievable.</p>

  <p>It was only then that he finally understood. The Sword Clan must have thought it through before assigning the task of inheritance to Luo Zheng and Yan.</p>

  <p>Marsh wasn't a fool after all.</p>

  <p>The strength of these two was absolutely beyond his imagination.</p>

  <p>As they descended, more and more whirlpools appeared. They did not kill the Fanged Cicadas but still rendered the creatures immobile.</p>

  <p>This lasted for five minutes more.</p>

  <p>After this time, they finally saw the rotten worm's tail, which meant that they finally got rid of all those damned Fanged Cicadas.</p>
