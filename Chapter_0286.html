  <p>
</p>

  <p>In Lake Mountain, Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>Hidden deep in the center of Cloud Sect was Lake Mountain. The way up to the top was steep, and made harder by that fact that there was no path up to the mountain. It was impossible to climb it without any equipment. People at the Illuminating Soul Realm could fly to get to the top of Lake Mountain, while the rest could get there with the help of a flying chariot.</p>

  <p>Despite the perilous travel, there were many glorious buildings on top of Lake Mountain. There was no doubt that it took a lot of trouble to transport the building materials all the way up to the mountain's summit.</p>

  <p>A beautiful lake surrounded Lake Mountain, which only added more to its scenic beauty. People could have a good view of the wonderful scenery if they stood on top of the mountain, which was also a good way to relax the senses.</p>

  <p>Many of Cloud Sect's saints lived on the elusive Lake Mountain.</p>

  <p>A long, narrow pavilion was situated at one corner of Lake Mountain.</p>

  <p>Half of the pavilion was perched firmly on the cliff, while its other half was cantilevered over the edge. A great part of the pavilion was cantilevered and hung in the air. If an acrophobic person stood on the pavilion, he would surely shiver with fear.</p>

  <p>The fragrant scent of tea wafted pleasantly in the air. An old man with a purple hat on brought the cup of tea to his lips, which was decorated with spun gold, and took a sip.</p>

  <p>The old man was Saint Zara, one of the top ten saints of Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>As he sipped on the hot drink, a stream of bright light suddenly passed over the sky and traversed closer to him. After a moment, another old man appeared at the edge of the pavilion. It was Saint Viana, who ranked tenth out of the top ten saints of Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>The gust of wind from Saint Viana's descent nearly overturned the tea set on the desk.</p>

  <p>"Viana, why do you break in full fury?" Zara asked with a frown.</p>

  <p>Every saint had lived for hundreds of years. As they got older, they became calmer when facing different situations. However, Viana was different. He had always been ill-tempered for so many years.</p>

  <p>An eyebrow slightly raised itself up to Viana's forehead.</p>

  <p>"Well, Zara, do you know what I have found out? The identity of Luo Luo Zheng, who was on the court trial last time, surprises me a lot!" Viana hissed.</p>

  <p>Saint Zara put his cup down and turned to look at him.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng? Does it matter who he really is?" he asked.</p>

  <p>This made him a bit confused. A few days ago, several saints got upset because the princess got angry at them just for Luo Zheng's sake. But that was a done deal, so they just let it go at that.</p>

  <p>"His last name is Luo. Did you forget about the genius girl, who was from C County and was brought to the court trial two years ago?" Saint Viana reminded him. Something clicked in Saint Zara's head, and then he spoke.</p>

  <p>"Yan?" The name was still clear as ever in Saint Zara's mind. He had lived for hundreds of years, but never had he come across any disciple who was as talented as Yan. Her last name was also Luo. Could it be that?</p>

  <p>"Did you mean to say that Yan was related to Luo Luo Zheng?" the question smoothly rolled out of Saint Zara's tongue as he thought about it.</p>

  <p>Saint Viana nodded and said, "That is exactly what I'm thinking!"</p>

  <p>The twinkling eyes of Saint Zara glanced at the tea set. "Well, the Luo Family isn't a big family, not even a noble one. But there are two outstanding talents in their family, it is amazing," Saint Zara quipped with a smile.</p>

  <p>There were also many exceptional people in Cloud Sect, and their abilities greatly varied from each other.</p>

  <p>However, supremely excellent talents like Yan and Luo Luo Zheng were rarely seen!</p>

  <p>After a short pause, Saint Zara continued to ask, "But even if it is true, so what?"</p>

  <p>As opposed to Saint Viana, Saint Zara thought little of the matter. Many things had inevitably vanished like smoke as time passed by. Such was the way of life. Cloud Sect had lots of descendants, and talents were not new to the saints.</p>

  <p>"Why doesn't it matter?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng is coming for his sister! He wants to save her! I found out that he had gone to Hell Mountain. I guess he wants to take Yan out!" Saint Viana exclaimed.</p>

  <p>However, Saint Zara still appeared unperturbed by the matter.</p>

  <p>"Yan is Luo Zheng's sister, it is human nature that Luo Luo Zheng wants to help Yan out of Hell Mountain. But I don't think it is easy for him to make it..."</p>

  <p>Saint Zara commented with a shake of his head. Then, he picked up the rosewood teapot and poured a stream of golden tea into his teacup.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Saint Viana was still quite bothered.</p>

  <p>"I won't have it! Luo Luo Zheng is a gifted man, but he is also evil. He is practicing Heavenly Ogre Fist now. Once he succeeds in it, it is no doubt that he will work hard to figure out what we have done to Yan. I believe he won't let us off easily if he knows the truth! So we must destroy him while he isn't powerful enough!"</p>

  <p>Worry had noticeably shaken Saint Viana right now.</p>

  <p>He was different from Saint Zara. Saint Zara had never fought with Luo Luo Zheng, but he had.</p>

  <p>That one day when he tried to subdue Luo Luo Zheng by using Fatal Palm, Luo Luo Zheng had successfully stopped him. Luo Luo Zheng had just reached the nature level at that time, but he was powerful enough to stop Saint Viana. Saint Viana was quite astonished by the strange phenomenon.</p>

  <p>After that, he poked his nose into the matter, and then he found out that when Luo Luo Zheng entered the Heavenly Library, he had taken the hidden book,</p>

  <p>'Heavenly Ogre Fist'. To his surprise, Luo Luo Zheng had successfully learned the skill!</p>

  <p>It was true that Luo Luo Zheng was just at the nature level now, but his learning capacity was vast and powerful. If he reached Illuminating Soul Realm, would it be quite possible for him to defeat Saint Viana?</p>

  <p>If he went through Cloud Road some day, and was elected by Cloud Hall, then he could do anything to Saint Viana if he wished.</p>
