<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Pearce wasn't familiar with the exact abilities of every powerful warrior from other six mountains.</p>

  <p>After all, some warriors chose to hide their Other Shore Tokens after they obtained them, so they could use them to take their opponents by surprise.</p>

  <p>Having asked everyone about it through life vitality, he ended up turning to Master Hai.</p>

  <p>Ever since Master Hai had fled to the Oneness Sky Palace and had been stationed in the Dragon City, he hadn't been in a single fight.</p>

  <p>However, Master Hai had once fused with an Other Shore Token of Stage Thirty-two -- a thumb sized worm, which was known as the Corpse Weaver.</p>

  <p>This tiny worm's ability was to creep into the body of a person who had just died, triggering a very unique effect: the corpse would come to life, in another form, and could attack the person who had just killed them.</p>

  <p>Corpse Weavers were suitable for creating Latent Theurgies. However, Master Hai hadn't used this Other Shore Token ever since he fled to the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, given the current circumstances, Pearce decided Master Hai needed to take action.</p>

  <p>The ability of the Corpse Weaver could only be activated after someone died, which meant that someone among the warriors at present must be killed for them to catch Emperor Charm.</p>

  <p>As all those warriors were afraid of death, they could only hope that Emperor Charm would break through the last layer of the Equinox Flower in the way they had anticipated.</p>

  <p>However, Emperor Charm still ended up using the Starlight Tracking Spear to break out of the Equinox Flower, and at the time he was out, the six rays of Starlight Witness had already hung above the heads of six warriors.</p>

  <p>Their initial plan was then rendered useless and the Corpse Weaver was activated.</p>

  <p>Looking sadly at the six corpses before him, Master Hai shook his head slightly.</p>

  <p>In such a short period of time, dozens of warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace had been killed. Even the leaders of the four mountains had been killed by Emperor Charm. It was indeed heartbreaking.</p>

  <p>Although the six corpses moved a bit stiffly, they were incredibly fast.</p>

  <p>The second they came to life, they pounced on Emperor Charm.</p>

  <p>Emperor Charm glanced at them indifferently. As the corpses approached him, he abruptly twisted his body, his vast white wings as sharp as two blades.</p>

  <p>Crack, crack, crack, crack, crack, crack!</p>

  <p>The power of the wings was as great as tens of thousands of divine megatons -- but these corpses' bodies were as hard as gold and iron. They emerged from the attack unscathed.</p>

  <p>However, the impact of the blow was enough to send them flying backward.</p>

  <p>To Emperor Charm's annoyance, there was some sort of thread woven around him that linked him to the chests of the corpses. Just as he had sent them flying for about a few hundred feet, the threads suddenly grew taut and pulled them back.</p>

  <p>Emperor Charm's expression turned grim as he looked at the six corpses.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>Reaching out his hand, a small square appeared on Emperor Charm's fingertip. With a flick of his finger, the square glowed a bright blue, enveloping one of the threads. When the square disappeared, the thread was still there, unharmed.</p>

  <p>Emperor Charm frowned. He actually couldn't cut the thread off!</p>

  <p>While he wasn't afraid of these corpses, he didn't understand how the Corpse Weaver worked. He still needed to face the powerful warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace. Dragging these corpses around while fighting would be such a nuisance.</p>

  <p>"Master Hai's method worked! The corpses have trapped him!" Pearce's eyes flashed. He felt a flicker of hope. "Everyone, go!"</p>

  <p>Everyone had been waiting anxiously by the Equinox Flower. When he had broken through using the spear, their plan was disrupted. But now, Pearce was telling them to follow through. Without hesitating, everyone charged towards Emperor Charm, shouting at the top of their lungs.</p>

  <p>Carrying the bone stick, the middle-aged man moved nimbly, appearing right behind Emperor Charm.</p>

  <p>Just then, another figure appeared. It looked exactly like him. He had made a duplicate using the mirror!</p>

  <p>The two figures raised their bone sticks above their heads, poised to strike.</p>

  <p>The bone sticks flashed, and a powerful force surged out like a tidal wave.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Seeing two bone sticks coming at him one after another, Emperor Charm frowned slightly. In the blink of an eye, his whole body disintegrated into countless tiny squares.</p>

  <p>Emperor Charm's Grand Teleportation was special. He didn't teleport through the space channel, so the others could not block him by entering the space channel.</p>

  <p>Normally, Emperor Charm could've appeared in another place, even in a place tens of thousands of miles away.</p>

  <p>But this time, he was dragging six corpses. The situation was different now and the six corpses had not been teleported away.</p>

  <p>What everyone could see was that the threads connected to the six corpses suddenly grew taut, and the corpses were yanked into the air.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>As the six threads intertwined with the space, it was as if they had been pulled into a gear, making constant cracking sounds. Along the way, various cracks appeared in the space, as if someone had cut the sky with an irregular saber.</p>

  <p>Even though Emperor Charm was proficient in space theurgy, it was still impossible for him to teleport with the six corpses in tow.</p>

  <p>After a few moments, his body appeared once more, not very far away.</p>

  <p>How could the warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace let go of this opportunity?</p>

  <p>At the moment when Emperor Charm appeared again, the two middle-aged men who had attacked just now vanished in a flash, then appeared next to him once more. The two bone sticks whistled in the air as they were swiftly swung towards Emperor Charm's head.</p>

  <p>This time around, Emperor Charm didn't have the time to dodge. He tried to shield himself by wrapping his pair of white wings around his body.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>Thunderous noises echoed through the air as the two huge bone sticks hit Emperor Charm's body, releasing an incredible amount of power.</p>

  <p>Although Emperor Charm was able to protect himself with his wings, the force was enough to send him flying. His entire body fell down like a meteorite.</p>

  <p>"Let me finish him!"</p>

  <p>The voice came from a young man in black from the Bright Mountain. As he spoke, a black cross appeared above his head. Brandishing two swords, he launched himself towards Emperor Charm.</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish!</p>

  <p>The two rays of sword radiance crisscrossed, aiming Emperor Charm at its center.</p>

  <p>"Puff! Puff!"</p>

  <p>When the two rays of sword radiance hit Emperor Charm, thin lines appeared on his pure, white wings. Then, blood seeped out from the lines.</p>

  <p>"He's injured!" the young man in black cried out excitedly.</p>

  <p>Usually, it wasn't a big deal for the powerful warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace or Emperor Charm to be slightly injured.</p>

  <p>However, if a warrior at the Chaotic Source Realm was injured, it usually meant that the Chaotic Source Spirits inside them were fatigued. And once the Chaotic Source Spirits did not work, the defensive power of Emperor Charm would greatly decrease!</p>

  <p>Just as the young man in black finished his attack, a golden arrow shot out from behind him, whizzing straight towards Emperor Charm.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The arrow exploded, and rays of golden light shot out in all directions, piercing through Emperor Charm's dazzling wings. The archer, a strong warrior from the Bright Mountain, smiled in satisfaction when he saw his attack had also injured Emperor Charm.</p>

  <p>"And me!"</p>

  <p>Another series of sword radiance slashed at him with a whistling sound.</p>

  <p>Emperor Charm had killed the leaders of the four mountains. The strong warriors of these mountains hated him to the core. Everyone wanted a chance to strike him, to avenge the fallen.</p>
