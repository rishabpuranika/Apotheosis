<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The pressure in the Sea of Truth continued to increase from the fourth line.</p>

  <p>The chill that emanated from the sea water crept towards the Souls of Light.</p>

  <p>It gave people the illusion that their souls were frozen.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and Dorothy maintained their speed and made good progress.</p>

  <p>If they had enough soul pills, they could cross one line every day. Their speed was normal for them, but in reality they were whizzing past the others at a high speed.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng got into trouble when he almost reached the end of the fourth section.</p>

  <p>The waves in the Sea of Truth became menacing near the fifth line threatening to capsize Luo Zheng's Truth Boat, but he gritted his teeth and managed to cross the line.</p>

  <p>The next morning, the sun rose as usual.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng opened his eyes, and the aura that he was emitting became stronger.</p>

  <p>Within two days after he came to the Dragon City, Luo Zheng had already crossed the fourth line and the fifth line. Monica was speechless when she saw Luo Zheng's progress.</p>

  <p>Beldene and the others really admired Luo Zheng's progress. After all, they were still approaching the first line.</p>

  <p>"If you keep moving at this speed, it won't be long before you can overtake me." Monica sighed.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled at her. "Please help me to look after my people today. I want to go to the Dragon City again," he requested.</p>

  <p>"You don't want my company?" A faint light flashed in Monica's beautiful eyes.</p>

  <p>"No, it's okay. I'm familiar with the basic rules of the Dragon City. It will be fine as long as I don't need to enter the Tower of Life and Death. If I can't make it back in a few days, I hope you will do me a favor and take care of my people," Luo Zheng uttered.</p>

  <p>There was no practicing room or cave for cultivation outside the Dragon City. If he just focused on cultivating the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, then it would not cause any inconvenience. It was normal for the Taiyi Heaven Palace to make such an arrangement. After all, most of the warriors, who joined the Dragon City, needed to comprehend the Truth of Divine Dao first in order to reach the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng had the Divine Dao Blending Swordsmanship and the Nine-Flash Light-splitting Swordsmanship. He would have to put in a lot of time and energy into cultivating them, so naturally, he needed a suitable place for cultivation.</p>

  <p>Monica readily agreed to help Luo Zheng and she reminded him to be careful.</p>

  <p>After being reassured by her, Luo Zheng headed straight for the Dragon City.</p>

  <p>To the west of the Dragon City, there stood a gourd-shaped tall tower. Its surface was painted dark red, making it a very striking structure.</p>

  <p>He had learned from Monica when they visited it yesterday that it was the Sword Tower of the Dragon City, and also the only place for cultivation in the city.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had made a mental note then. Monica had advised him that it would be better for him to go there after he reached the Other Shore Realm. She did not explain the reason behind it though.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng pushed the door open, he saw an old man with a mask leaning on the side. He seemed to be resting with his eyes closed.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng entered the room, the masked old man just pointed outside without opening his eyes and yelled, "You haven't even reached the Other Shore. Get out!"</p>

  <p>His voice had formidable power and authority, which made Luo Zheng stop in his tracks and frown.</p>

  <p>The old man cultivated the Truth of Holy Words, which was rarely seen in the Dragon City. Luo Zheng ruminated for a while and said, "The Sword Tower is open to everyone. I haven't heard of this rule that people can enter it only after they reach the Other Shore Realm."</p>

  <p>The masked old man didn't expect Luo Zheng to refute him. He finally opened his eyes and looked at him. "If you are willing to pay enough divine crystals, you can go in. The premise is that you should not be afraid of death. I am telling you for your own good," he said with a gentle smile.</p>

  <p>"Is the Sword Tower really so dangerous?" Luo Zheng asked incredulously.</p>

  <p>"It is for you!" The masked old man squinted at Luo Zheng impatiently and said,</p>

  <p>"Please go now and come back after you reach the Other Shore."</p>

  <p>Since Luo Zheng was already here, he had no intentions of returning. With a flip of his hand, several divine crystals appeared in his hand. He said loudly, "If the Sword Tower is open to everyone, there is no reason to prevent people from entering it."</p>

  <p>Seeing the divine crystals, the old man looked at Luo Zheng in surprise. He shook his head helplessly and muttered, "There are always some people who want to be humiliated, and are not afraid of death... Come with me!" barked the old man.</p>

  <p>He led Luo Zheng into the tower despite his misgivings.</p>

  <p>The inner space of the Sword Tower was huge. There was a spiral-shaped internal structure and there were many rooms scattered there. There were many sword platforms in front of the rooms, and a small jade plate was placed atop each of them.</p>

  <p>"You can put the divine crystals on the jade plate to open the door. It costs one hundred divine crystals for one day. However, the time law rate in the room is ten times faster than that in the outside world. When the time is up, you will be kicked out of the room. If you can't hold on, wait till the time is up and the room kicks you out, so that you can survive," the old man explained with a smile and walked away with his hands crossed behind his back. He believed that Luo Zheng would surely be kicked out.</p>

  <p>The brittle old man gave no indication as to what Luo Zheng would encounter inside the tower.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stood at the door and observed for a while. Then he removed three hundred divine crystals and put them onto the jade plate.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had seen this kind of jade plate on the Trumpet Flying Ship before. The jade plate absorbed the divine crystals and immediately the door of the room started opening slowly.</p>

  <p>After entering the room, Luo Zheng glanced around. It was a little strange.</p>

  <p>The room was empty, except for a jade cushion, which was placed in the center. There was nothing else in the room. It appeared to be an ordinary practicing room, but he had to spend one hundred divine crystals to stay there for a day.</p>

  <p id="top_14">"The Taiyi Heaven Palace is so mean!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng muttered to himself while sitting cross-legged on the jade cushion.</p>

  <p>As he was sitting on the jade cushion, it started rotating. It continued doing so for a while and the empty practicing room changed!</p>

  <p>He was now in a huge cave and countless long red swords were strewn about the cave like weeds. The tips of the swords were all positioned at Luo Zheng who sat in the middle. There was only one path in front of him, through which he could leave.</p>

  <p>"These swords..." Luo Zheng raised his eyebrows and immediately became alert.</p>

  <p>Although the swords were wedged onto the walls of the cave, Luo Zheng felt as if people were aiming their swords at him and ready to stab any time!</p>

  <p>He turned a little on the jade cushion and stretched out his hand.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A long sword shot towards him from the top of the cave!</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The long sword moved surprisingly fast. It grazed his arm slightly while flying past him, leaving a faint blood mark.</p>

  <p>"Whoa! What a powerful strike!"</p>

  <p>The sword strike was formidable to be able to break Luo Zheng's physical body. It was attacking him with the full force of a warrior at the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>If someone else were to be attacked by the sword, their arm might have been cut off.</p>

  <p>These swords could pose a big threat to his life!</p>

  <p>Now Luo Zheng understood why the old man had warned him. He was right. The Sword Tower was not suitable for those who hadn't reached the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>If he couldn't deflect the attacks, he would have to stay put on the jade cushion and just wait to be kicked out when the time was up.</p>

  <p>"Thirty days...! I just have to resist the attacks and go out at my own will, instead of being kicked out," he said to himself determinedly.</p>

  <p>Sitting on the jade cushion, he erased all the negative thoughts in his mind and took out the Divine Dao Blending Swordsmanship once more!</p>
