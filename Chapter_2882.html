<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2882 The Incomplete Divine Dao </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The Divine Dao Tablets were distributed evenly in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Generally, one Divine Dao Tablet existed in every region.</p>

  <p>Occasionally, there were two, or even three, Divine Dao Tablets in a particular region.</p>

  <p>With Mike's help, it only took Luo Zheng five minutes to move from one Divine Dao Tablet to another and absorb its internal momentum.</p>

  <p>In two days and two nights, the two had flown across the divine land without stopping, and Luo Zheng had absorbed 150 Divine Dao Tablets!</p>

  <p>"The 151st Divine Dao Tablet!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked at the Divine Dao Tablet in front of him with a hint of surprise in his eyes.</p>

  <p>The Divine Dao Tablets in the divine land were the painstaking fruits of Chiyou's labor. They couldn't be damaged. Theoretically, they were very difficult to destroy. But a part of this Divine Dao Tablet was missing. Its surface was pitted, and there were cracks in the lower left corner.</p>

  <p>People jostled against one another for other Divine Dao Tablets, and the first-tier clans often fenced off these Divine Dao Tablets in a bid to earn some profit.</p>

  <p>But very few people showed interest in this dented Divine Dao Tablet. Only a handful of people were gathered around it.</p>

  <p>Seeing Luo Zheng's strange expression, an old man beside him commented, "It's a pity when there is a slight flaw in a white jade, but nothing in the world is flawless. The incomplete Divine Dao, in my opinion, is the only right way.</p>

  <p>Can you tell the implications of this Divine Dao Tablet, young man?"</p>

  <p>"Incomplete Divine Dao? What kind of token does it possess?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes flashed with excitement.</p>

  <p>There were three thousand Divine Dao and not all could showcase great power.</p>

  <p>Some of the Divine Dao were merely the insights into the world, and no powerful token was created from their internal momentum.</p>

  <p>This incomplete Divine Dao was one such piece.</p>

  <p>"Humph! This vast divine land is like a huge pot. The Holy Beings and consummate True Gods are nothing more than the ants in the pot. All of them have great aspirations and try every means to seek omnipotent skills, but they are too impatient to appreciate things that are incomplete," the old man remarked with a disdainful look.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyebrows shot up when he heard this.</p>

  <p>This old man was only a mid-rank True God, but clearly he had a thorough understanding of the matters of the divine land.</p>

  <p>"If one manages to comprehend the incomplete Divine Dao, he or she will be able to see the truth hidden in it. Warriors might not always pursue theurgies. It's said that after we reach the True God Realm, we can become immortal, but the question is, can the divine land really exist forever? The truth is that there is no such thing as being immortal in this world. It is just the will left behind by the ancestors." The old man advised Luo Zheng, "Young man, if you can cultivate the incomplete Divine Dao patiently, you will benefit greatly in the future."</p>

  <p>Mike concealed himself in the air. When he heard the old man, a smile appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>In the divine land, people could live on forever. There were many extraordinary talents and some people didn't pursue strength or theurgies, but as they had lived for a long time, their insights and thoughts were no worse than those of the Holy Beings. Some of them, although they were not famous, were even more foresighted than the Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>So it wasn't a bad thing that the old man was imparting his wisdom to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The old man's words enlightened Luo Zheng. He bowed to him and said, "Thank you for your teachings. It seems that each of the three thousand Divine Dao has its own use. This incomplete Divine Dao Tablet is also valuable."</p>

  <p>The old man was thrilled to hear Luo Zheng's compliment. "Right. It's more difficult to cultivate the incomplete Divine Dao compared to the other ones and you have to pay more. Young man, do you still want to choose the incomplete Divine Dao?"</p>

  <p>"That's precisely what I'm thinking," replied Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"All right. You can observe the internal momentum of the incomplete Divine Dao first. If you have any questions, feel free to ask me. Although my cultivation base is not as high as yours, I have been studying this for sixty divine eras. And I have learned a lot," said the old man.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded and walked determinedly towards the incomplete Divine Dao Tablet. At the same time, two golden rings of light began to glow in his eyes.</p>

  <p>The internal momentum of the incomplete Divine Dao quickly entered the Infinity Ruler in his mind. At the same time, a mark lit up on the Infinity Ruler.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Just as the mark lit up, one more Divine Dao appeared in Luo Zheng's inner world.</p>

  <p>Wisps of livid, gray auras were released from Luo Zheng's body. He had mastered the incomplete Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>The old man was standing one hundred feet away from Luo Zheng. His jaw dropped as he stared at Luo Zheng's back in disbelief.</p>

  <p>The others around the Divine Dao Tablet also looked at him with equal incredulity.</p>

  <p>The reason why only a few people cultivated the incomplete Divine Dao was that on the one hand, it was extremely difficult to comprehend; and on the other hand, it didn't have any powerful token. This was merely a record of how beautiful the world was.</p>

  <p>Over the years, only a few people who cultivated it had become mid-rank True Gods, and this old man was one of them.</p>

  <p>Moreover, because of its incomplete nature, there was a rumor in the divine land that it was impossible to reach the consummation of True God Realm by cultivating it, because the incomplete was the opposite side of consummation.</p>

  <p>But today, it only took seconds for a young man to master it.</p>

  <p>In their eyes, Luo Zheng was even more terrifying than a monster! They couldn't believe their eyes.</p>

  <p>"What? It's impossible! How is it possible to master the incomplete Divine Dao? No way! Theoretically, it is just impossible!"</p>

  <p>The old man looked befuddled.</p>

  <p>He had just warned Luo Zheng that it was difficult to cultivate the incomplete Divine Dao, but Luo Zheng had mastered it in a matter of seconds. Not only that, he also entered a realm that he could not understand!</p>

  <p>The old man was on the verge of breaking down.</p>

  <p>"The incomplete Divine Dao does have a special beauty. It is impossible to develop a token from it, but it will allow me to observe this world from a special perspective."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was unaware of people's reaction as he was completely immersed in the charm of the incomplete Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>It was not until he came to his senses and saw the old man's astounded expression that he realized what had happened.</p>

  <p>What he had done was simply too shocking. He had achieved the impossible.</p>

  <p>He didn't walk away. Instead he strolled over to the old man with an apologetic look on his face and explained, "I didn't comprehend the Divine Dao by depending on my own talent. It's not what you think. Please, don't dwell on it too much."</p>

  <p>The method he had used to comprehend the Divine Dao with the Infinity Ruler was no different than cheating. Luo Zheng felt sorry that the old man misunderstood him.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng had offered an explanation, the old man was still rooted to the spot.</p>

  <p>Looking at his stiff body, Luo Zheng felt helpless. There were still many Divine Dao that he needed to absorb, so he couldn't spend too much time here.</p>

  <p>More importantly, he couldn't reveal the secret of the Infinity Ruler to the kind old man.</p>

  <p>At last, Luo Zheng shrugged his shoulders and flew off towards Mike who was in the sky.</p>
