<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2882 The Incomplete Godly Way </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The Godly Way Tablets were distributed evenly in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Generally, one Godly Way Tablet existed in every region.</p>

  <p>Occasionally, there were two, or even three, Godly Way Tablets in a particular region.</p>

  <p>With Mike's help, it only took Zheng five minutes to move from one Godly Way Tablet to another and absorb its internal momentum.</p>

  <p>In two days and two nights, the two had flown across the divine land without stopping, and Zheng had absorbed 150 Godly Way Tablets!</p>

  <p>"The 151st Godly Way Tablet!"</p>

  <p>Zheng looked at the Godly Way Tablet in front of him with a hint of surprise in his eyes.</p>

  <p>The Godly Way Tablets in the divine land were the painstaking fruits of Chiyou's labor. They couldn't be damaged. Theoretically, they were very difficult to destroy. But a part of this Godly Way Tablet was missing. Its surface was pitted, and there were cracks in the lower left corner.</p>

  <p>People jostled against one another for other Godly Way Tablets, and the first-tier clans often fenced off these Godly Way Tablets in a bid to earn some profit.</p>

  <p>But very few people showed interest in this dented Godly Way Tablet. Only a handful of people were gathered around it.</p>

  <p>Seeing Zheng's strange expression, an old man beside him commented, "It's a pity when there is a slight flaw in a white jade, but nothing in the world is flawless. The incomplete Godly Way, in my opinion, is the only right way.</p>

  <p>Can you tell the implications of this Godly Way Tablet, young man?"</p>

  <p>"Incomplete Godly Way? What kind of theurgy does it possess?"</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes flashed with excitement.</p>

  <p>There were three thousand Godly Ways and not all could showcase great power.</p>

  <p>Some of the Godly Ways were merely the insights into the world, and no powerful theurgy was created from their internal momentum.</p>

  <p>This incomplete Godly Way was one such piece.</p>

  <p>"Humph! This vast divine land is like a huge pot. The Holy Beings and consummate True Gods are nothing more than the ants in the pot. All of them have great aspirations and try every means to seek omnipotent skills, but they are too impatient to appreciate things that are incomplete," the old man remarked with a disdainful look.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyebrows shot up when he heard this.</p>

  <p>This old man was only a mid-rank True God, but clearly he had a thorough understanding of the matters of the divine land.</p>

  <p>"If one manages to comprehend the incomplete Godly Way, he or she will be able to see the truth hidden in it. Warriors might not always pursue theurgies. It's said that after we reach the True God Realm, we can become immortal, but the question is, can the divine land really exist forever? The truth is that there is no such thing as being immortal in this world. It is just the will left behind by the ancestors." The old man advised Zheng, "Young man, if you can cultivate the incomplete Godly Way patiently, you will benefit greatly in the future."</p>

  <p>Mike concealed himself in the air. When he heard the old man, a smile appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>In the divine land, people could live on forever. There were many extraordinary talents and some people didn't pursue strength or theurgies, but as they had lived for a long time, their insights and thoughts were no worse than those of the Holy Beings. Some of them, although they were not famous, were even more foresighted than the Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>So it wasn't a bad thing that the old man was imparting his wisdom to Zheng.</p>

  <p>The old man's words enlightened Zheng. He bowed to him and said, "Thank you for your teachings. It seems that each of the three thousand Godly Ways has its own use. This incomplete Godly Way Tablet is also valuable."</p>

  <p>The old man was thrilled to hear Zheng's compliment. "Right. It's more difficult to cultivate the incomplete Godly Ways compared to the other ones and you have to pay more. Young man, do you still want to choose the incomplete Godly Way?"</p>

  <p>"That's precisely what I'm thinking," replied Zheng.</p>

  <p>"All right. You can observe the internal momentum of the incomplete Godly Way first. If you have any questions, feel free to ask me. Although my cultivation base is not as high as yours, I have been studying this for sixty divine eras. And I have learned a lot," said the old man.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded and walked determinedly towards the incomplete Godly Way Tablet. At the same time, two golden rings of light began to glow in his eyes.</p>

  <p>The internal momentum of the incomplete Godly Way quickly entered the Infinity Ruler in his mind. At the same time, a mark lit up on the Infinity Ruler.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Just as the mark lit up, one more Godly Way appeared in Zheng's inner world.</p>

  <p>Wisps of livid, gray auras were released from Zheng's body. He had mastered the incomplete Godly Way.</p>

  <p>The old man was standing one hundred feet away from Zheng. His jaw dropped as he stared at Zheng's back in disbelief.</p>

  <p>The others around the Godly Way Tablet also looked at him with equal incredulity.</p>

  <p>The reason why only a few people cultivated the incomplete Godly Way was that on the one hand, it was extremely difficult to comprehend; and on the other hand, it didn't have any powerful theurgy. This was merely a record of how beautiful the world was.</p>

  <p>Over the years, only a few people who cultivated it had become mid-rank True Gods, and this old man was one of them.</p>

  <p>Moreover, because of its incomplete nature, there was a rumor in the divine land that it was impossible to reach the consummation of True God Realm by cultivating it, because the incomplete was the opposite side of consummation.</p>

  <p>But today, it only took seconds for a young man to master it.</p>

  <p>In their eyes, Zheng was even more terrifying than a monster! They couldn't believe their eyes.</p>

  <p>"What? It's impossible! How is it possible to master the incomplete Godly Way? No way! Theoretically, it is just impossible!"</p>

  <p>The old man looked befuddled.</p>

  <p>He had just warned Zheng that it was difficult to cultivate the incomplete Godly Way, but Zheng had mastered it in a matter of seconds. Not only that, he also entered a realm that he could not understand!</p>

  <p>The old man was on the verge of breaking down.</p>

  <p>"The incomplete Godly Way does have a special beauty. It is impossible to develop a theurgy from it, but it will allow me to observe this world from a special perspective."</p>

  <p>Zheng was unaware of people's reaction as he was completely immersed in the charm of the incomplete Godly Way.</p>

  <p>It was not until he came to his senses and saw the old man's astounded expression that he realized what had happened.</p>

  <p>What he had done was simply too shocking. He had achieved the impossible.</p>

  <p>He didn't walk away. Instead he strolled over to the old man with an apologetic look on his face and explained, "I didn't comprehend the Godly Way by depending on my own talent. It's not what you think. Please, don't dwell on it too much."</p>

  <p>The method he had used to comprehend the Godly Ways with the Infinity Ruler was no different than cheating. Zheng felt sorry that the old man misunderstood him.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng had offered an explanation, the old man was still rooted to the spot.</p>

  <p>Looking at his stiff body, Zheng felt helpless. There were still many Godly Ways that he needed to absorb, so he couldn't spend too much time here.</p>

  <p>More importantly, he couldn't reveal the secret of the Infinity Ruler to the kind old man.</p>

  <p>At last, Zheng shrugged his shoulders and flew off towards Mike who was in the sky.</p>
