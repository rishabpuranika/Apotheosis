<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 785 Fiery Star Flame (Part One) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>The immortal did have special means and methods far beyond the imagination of the practitioners from Central Region.</p>

  <p>Even the Virtual Tribulation Realm elders struggled under various punishments and most of them perished quickly.</p>

  <p>However, the rewards they received were also incredible. Granting 500 years of lifespan as a reward in a single go was something that only a legendary immortal could do.</p>

  <p>"I've never even heard of Fiery Star Flame before. I wonder what kind of flame it is."</p>

  <p>"Whatever it is, Luo Luo Zheng is going to die anyway, judging by the intensity I can see even from here. It's a pity, you know? Our Bloodwood Cliff was considering hiring him to build a sect-protecting array. We have even decided on a quite big budget."</p>

  <p>"Why is Luo Luo Zheng so unlucky?" Brent pursed his lips. He hadn't expected that Luo Luo Zheng would have to face his punishment after a mere three steps.</p>

  <p>Even Dillon from the World Commercial Alliance frowned and remarked,</p>

  <p>"I can see that his Mu Ning is vigorous and auspicious, and his karmic luck is extremely good. To be honest, even I have never seen anything like this before. I don't know why he has suddenly gotten so unlucky here."</p>

  <p>The Ancient Tycoon looked at Luo Luo Zheng who was surrounded by purple lights at the moment, and smiled faintly, "It is true. This kid's fortune is indeed very strong. But a single moment's luck doesn't mean anything. Only a lifetime's luck is the true luck."</p>

  <p>Dillon didn't say anything, but in his heart, he was thinking, 'A lifetime's luck? Not a chance. He will have to survive this punishment first.'</p>

  <p>Watching the purple flames float around him in midair, Luo Luo Zheng squinted his eyes. His spiritual weapon body hadn't advanced any level for a long time.</p>

  <p>Although the red dragon had helped him to forge his body, he had taken the path of body refining. To the untrained eyes, the two methods seemed to be quite similar to each other, but in reality, they were two completely different paths.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had chosen to refine his body with abnormal flames before, but it was hard to find abnormal flames. Before today, Luo Luo Zheng had encountered a few types of abnormal flames, but none of them had ever had any effect on him.</p>

  <p>For example, in Cloud Sect, when he had encountered the flames from Mack's magic array, they had activated his physical body, but it seemed that his body was rejecting the flames instead of absorbing them.</p>

  <p>Clearly, not all flames in the world were "good enough" to be used for body tempering techniques.</p>

  <p>'These flames should be just what I need, ' Luo Luo Zheng thought as he narrowed his eyes.</p>

  <p>Although the Fiery Star Flames seemed to be light as a feather and were like numerous strings woven of flowers as they gently descended towards Luo Luo Zheng, he could already feel the terrifying power within them before they even touched him!</p>

  <p>In the past, only after Luo Zheng's body had been completely incinerated by the abnormal flames would he notice any change on his skin. His body would gradually turn red, and a golden vortexes would appear on his skin.</p>

  <p>But this time, even while the flames were a good distance away from him, some golden Sanskrit had already covered Luo Zheng's skin. Much before the flame touched him physically, the Sanskrit turned into numerous vortexes that erupted with a fierce traction force!</p>

  <p>His body began to throb and he suddenly realized that the throbbing was actually a very strong and fierce desire to get close to the Fiery Star Flame!</p>

  <p>"What's going on?"</p>

  <p>When he would not move towards the flame, the strong traction force attracted the flame itself from a distance and very soon, not one string of flame was left out.</p>

  <p>Noticing everything that was going on, Luo Luo Zheng stood upright on the ground, and allowed the Fiery Star Flames to enter his body. Apart from a dazzling golden light surrounding him, his body had completely turned red, as if he was a statue that had just been cast using molten metal.</p>

  <p>However, for some reason, Luo Luo Zheng didn't feel too uncomfortable at the moment. Instead, he felt as if a sense of laziness and comfort had fallen on him.</p>

  <p>After a long while, the Fiery Star Flame finally stopped falling above Luo Zheng's head. Only then did the light on his body slowly fade away, and with it, the purple light surrounding Luo Luo Zheng also gradually dissipated.</p>

  <p>"Alas, he has probably turned into a pile of ashes."</p>

  <p>"Him dying here is indeed quite a tragic incident. The most talented runic expert in the history of Central Region only left one piece of work in the world and then died. What a pity!"</p>

  <p>"It isn't too surprising, though. Generally speaking, a martial artist with this sort of monster-level talent either has great luck in the world or faces great doom. The heavens cannot tolerate anything else for him. A pity that this boy should belong to the latter ?"</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie looked at the fading purple light, where Luo Luo Zheng was standing, and clenched her fists tightly. Of course, she had investigated Luo Luo Zheng before and knew that Luo Zheng's physique was very special. In Cloud Sect, his physique had been comparable to a spiritual weapon, invulnerable to swords and spears, and could even bear the burning effects of fire.</p>

  <p>However, it was likely that the flames Luo Luo Zheng could withstand were nothing compared to the Fiery Star Flame. Therefore, she wasn't so sure about whether Luo Luo Zheng could withstand the Fiery Star Flame or not.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie had initially opened her eyes wide and was staring at the purple light. However, all of a sudden, she turned her head, her face completely red.</p>

  <p>What was that? Once the purple light had completely dissipated, Luo Luo Zheng was sitting upright on the round disk, safe and sound. However, he was completely naked. The Fiery Star Flame had burned his clothes.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Luo Zheng's body was clearly visible. The newly forged physical vessel was still emitting a faint afterglow. Seeing this sort of near-perfection, the crowd was stunned.</p>

  <p>"This brat ? how did he do that? What did he do?"</p>
