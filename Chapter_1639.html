<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1639 Who Ranked First </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's Mu Ning immediately attracted a lot of attention as he flew into the main city.</p>

  <p>Those who noticed him wore obvious looks of astonishment on their faces.</p>

  <p>His fight with Malachi was still fresh in their minds and Luo Luo Zheng was now regarded as a sort of unbeatable monster in everyone's eyes.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, on the other hand, merely glanced at them as he flew over their heads.</p>

  <p>These warriors collectively had around a few hundred thousand Illusion Points. There was no need to waste his time with these low-level people.</p>

  <p>His target was Malachi and it was going to stay that way.</p>

  <p>Malachi's red dot flew and landed on the west side of the main city. Luo Luo Zheng was in close pursuit and saw the dot expand and turn into a person-sized mass of light.</p>

  <p>The round of heavens was powerful, but it was impossible for it to instantly revive and reconstruct the countless warriors that were currently dying in this city-wide massacre. Malachi would have to wait for a bit before his body was fully reconstructed.</p>

  <p>Those who entered the Illusion Battlefield were currently enveloped by the light of the heavens and only needed to project their bodies inside it.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng wasn't quite sure why the equipment carried by the warriors couldn't be carried over after their bodies were projected again...</p>

  <p>He held his sword in one hand and the acquired spear on the other as he waited near that mass of light.</p>

  <p>He didn't have to wait long. Soon enough, the light began to fluctuate and a reconstructed person began to step out of it.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled and brandished the spear as soon as the figure appeared.</p>

  <p>Malachi didn't even have a chance. The moment he stepped out, Luo Luo Zheng was already waiting for him. The young man was quick to kill him without any problems. It was incredibly frustrating on Malachi's end.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh..."</p>

  <p>Malachi's points, however, still did not burst out.</p>

  <p>The red dot, containing his soul, immediately flew towards the other side of the city.</p>

  <p>"I have killed him three times, so his Exemption Medallions should have all been used up, ' Luo Luo Zheng thought as he immediately chased after the red dot again.</p>

  <p>It was the same cycle: Malachi revived and Luo Luo Zheng quickly ended him with a spear strike.</p>

  <p>The three Exemption Medallions had all been used up and his accumulated Illusion Points were immediately cut in half now that Luo Luo Zheng was successful in killing him for the fourth time.</p>

  <p>"Buzz, buzz, buzz..."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng drew back his spear and readily absorbed the massive surge of Illusion Points in his body.</p>

  <p>The sight of so many Illusion Points attracted everyone's attention.</p>

  <p>The amount of Illusion Points in front of them could no doubt elevate a low-ranking warrior all the way to the top 100 of this supreme world!</p>

  <p>Of course, these points already had an owner. Since Luo Luo Zheng killed Malachi then all these points would naturally go to him. None of the warriors dared to take his points away, since they knew that Luo Luo Zheng was already doing them a huge favor by not targeting them.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng didn't seem to be too interested in these Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>His eyes were instead fixed at the red dot that contained Malachi's soul.</p>

  <p>The dot flew away to a corner of the city and Luo Luo Zheng was immediately in close pursuit.</p>

  <p>Each time he killed Malachi, he would be entitled to half of his accumulated points. Luo Luo Zheng had no plans to stop until he bled Malachi dry of all of his Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>A large amount of points had come out of his body just now, so there was no doubt that he still had a couple of million points stored within him.</p>

  <p>And Luo Luo Zheng wasn't wrong.</p>

  <p>Malachi had a total of 70 million Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>His death by Luo Zheng's hands halved it into 35 million points.</p>

  <p>Right now, he was ranked 2, 400th in the Illusion Battlefield and 47th in the supreme world.</p>

  <p>It wasn't so bad.</p>

  <p>At least he was still in the top 50!</p>

  <p>However, he still couldn't rest easy.</p>

  <p>How could he escape when Luo Luo Zheng was still chasing after him? If he died a fifth time, then he might completely drop out of the top 50 and lose the opportunity to enter the second stage of the Illusion Battlefield!</p>

  <p>An ace talent like him, who couldn't even make it into the top 50, would be an absolute disgrace! He couldn't allow that to happen! Not if he valued his dignity.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, you're going too far!" he shouted through the ball of light.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng simply ignored him. So what if he was going too far? He was determined to milk Malachi dry of all his points. The moment the warrior was resurrected, Luo Luo Zheng once again pierced him with the spear and let him be engulfed by the spear shadow manifested by the Shadowy Spin...</p>

  <p>"Puff!"</p>

  <p>For the second time, a huge amount of Illusion Points burst forth from Malachi.</p>

  <p>The number of points had been reduced by half: about 17 million, which meant there were still around 17 million points in Malachi's body.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh..."</p>

  <p>There was no way Luo Luo Zheng was letting go of his prey. He once again followed the red dot and prepared to kill him for the sixth time.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, if you stop killing me then I can let Hailey off!" Malachi roared.</p>

  <p>He couldn't really affect the Saint Spear Sect's position, but Malachi knew he could still control Hailey's fate. She was his only bargaining chip right at this desperate moment.</p>

  <p>He was now out of the top 50, but if he could keep at least ten million Illusion Points then he still stood a chance in catching up to the rankings.</p>

  <p>"Puff!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did not respond and simply pierced Malachi with the spear, like he did a few times before.</p>

  <p>"I can really let off Hailey..." he repeated weakly.</p>

  <p>"There's no need," Luo Luo Zheng said flatly.</p>

  <p>He was no fool. There was no way he was going to believe that Malachi would do good on his promise.</p>

  <p>Some grudges ran too deep to be let off so easily. Luo Luo Zheng was determined to bring Xun back to the Demon Night and punish all those bad guys.</p>

  <p>Malachi only had around eight million Illusion Points left in his body.</p>

  <p>"Once again..." Luo Zheng's eyes flashed as he followed Malachi's red dot.</p>

  <p>The seventh time he was killed, Malachi was left with only around four million points? not even enough to enter the Hall of Causality.</p>

  <p>The eighth time had him with only two million Illusion Points left...</p>

  <p>The ninth time, one million...</p>

  <p>The tenth time? five hundred thousand...</p>

  <p>Each time he killed him, Luo Luo Zheng got less and less Illusion Points from Malachi.</p>

  <p>Such was the rule.</p>

  <p>After the twelfth time of dying, Malachi had a little over one hundred thousand Illusion Points left which was a far cry from his initial 70 million Illusion Points. His ranking also dropped from fourth all the way down to the 8, 000th. To say he felt disappointed was an understatement.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>Hailey shouted.</p>

  <p>Behind her were Janet and the others.</p>

  <p>In the midst of the chaos, the five of them formed a team and fought their way into the city. Through the power of teamwork, none of them died and they even managed to get themselves a considerable amount of Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>Nobody was really brave enough to attack them but they could easily attack others.</p>

  <p>The weaker ones were the first to fall and had no chance to fight back with all the other stronger warriors hunting them down.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stopped and looked at Hailey. "I've already taken all of Malachi's Illusion Points."</p>

  <p>Hailey breathed a sigh of relief. "I saw it."</p>

  <p>"Are you mentally prepared?" he asked her.</p>

  <p>She hesitated for a moment. "Even if I have to receive the Punishment of Eternal Night, I will still bear it. I will work hard to live on... I still look forward to that day..."</p>

  <p>The Punishment of Eternal Night Hailey just mentioned was a completely terrible thing that only the Demon Night members would know.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng shook his head. "I won't let you wait for so long."</p>

  <p>His words left a deep impression on her and Hailey's eyes simply shone as she looked Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>People generally feard pain and frustration. However, such things were easily endurable by warriors. No, what people truly feared the most was the idea of hopelessness.</p>

  <p>Amber, for example, was someone who needed hope to survive. She was on the verge of collapse and her imprisonment did not make things any easier for her. It was only with hope that she drew the power to survive.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was someone who could promise them what they all sincerely hoped for the most.</p>

  <p>He was not a man who casually made promises. Each time he did, he felt an immense pressure to live up to his word and keep it.</p>

  <p>However, even if he hadn't made a promise, things had already gone this far, and Luo Luo Zheng didn't think he would be able to sit idly by and watch this all happen without doing anything.</p>

  <p>It was at this moment that Luo Luo Zheng finally found the time to check his ranking and the results slightly shocked him.</p>

  <p>He was now in the top 100 and was ranked 77th in the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>And he was ranked second in the supreme world! The Illusion Points he got from Malachi obviously were a huge deal in elevating his place in the rankings!</p>

  <p>But if he was second, then who was the first?</p>

  <p> </p>
