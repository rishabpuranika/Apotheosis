<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>According to the judgment of the Evil God, he originally wanted to restore the energy up to the one in the thirteenth-grade world, and then find the answer.</p>

  <p>However, when the energy of the twelfth-grade world was already restored, he suddenly learned something.</p>

  <p>As for the two kinds of "Coke" energy in the twelfth-grade world, it turned out that one was to create and the other was to destruct. They had no special features but they were said to be interlinked with each other.</p>

  <p>They were just the positive and negative sides of energy.</p>

  <p>After the energy of the thirteenth-grade world was restored, the situation became simpler and clearer.</p>

  <p>Surprisingly, there was no energy in the thirteenth-grade world.</p>

  <p>The only secret that it contained was how to control everything.</p>

  <p>When the Evil God finally got this authority, he could now discover the infinite energy that was hidden in the void.</p>

  <p>"It's so beautiful?"</p>

  <p>Shera was deeply mesmerized as she stared at the colorful bands of light that floated in the sky.</p>

  <p>When the Evil God saw her fascination, he gently stretched out his finger.</p>

  <p>Then, a small dark-red band of light appeared on Shera's index finger, looking like an exquisite ring.</p>

  <p>"This is?"</p>

  <p>Shera was surprised as she looked at the band of light on her finger.</p>

  <p>"The energy of the Source World is sealed within it. You can use it anytime you want," the Evil God said with a faint smile. "However, I doubt that you will have the chance to use it."</p>

  <p>Indeed, the Source World was vast, and it contained a lot of energy.</p>

  <p>However, the Evil God needed to face Zheng and the downgrader. In a battle involving them, even the energy of the entire Source World was far from enough.</p>

  <p>Despite that, Shera's eyes still gleamed in excitement.</p>

  <p>It was such a romantic gesture for her that the Evil God turned the Source World into a ring.</p>

  <p>"If the 'Field' energy is in the shape of a light band, then what is the form of the 'Weight' energy?" the Grandmaster of Heaven asked out of curiosity.</p>

  <p>He was a man with a strong desire for knowledge, and thus he would take any opportunity to broaden the horizon of his wisdom.</p>

  <p>"Weight?</p>

  <p>It's a kind of energy that is in the form of acute triangles.</p>

  <p>That's it!"</p>

  <p>Then, all of a sudden, irregular triangular energy blocks appeared in the sky.</p>

  <p>"Hmm, Coupling is a kind of lumpy energy.</p>

  <p>This kind of energy won't be seen from the outside. But since it appeared, it has already been integrated, and thus it's uncontrollable. I don't know how people fight in the eighth-grade world."</p>

  <p>Upon saying this, the Evil God released the lumps of Coupling energy.</p>

  <p>They had a complicated form and looked like delicate boxes. Since They were already in a complete form, there was almost no energy that was coming from them.</p>

  <p>"Well, the 'Cube' energy of the ninth-grade world is more interesting. It doesn't have a fixed form, so it could be transmuted into various things.</p>

  <p>Now, the energy of the tenth-grade world? "</p>

  <p>Previously, although all of the two billion brains had already restored the energy bit by bit, it could only exist in his brain without the support of the infinite energy.</p>

  <p>Even the Evil God was very curious about such energy, so he displayed them one by one.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the battle in the Burial Land was still raging on.</p>

  <p>Crash! Boom!</p>

  <p>A layer of bright red enchanted barrier was suddenly smashed into pieces.</p>

  <p>After that, the downgrader fell into the illusion that was created by the Soul Extreme Form. In order to resist it, he needed to use another Extreme Form energy to counter it.</p>

  <p>However, as soon as he broke out of the illusion, he found himself sealed in an extremely sturdy copper ball.</p>

  <p>"Ha! Is this all you can do?"</p>

  <p>Crash!</p>

  <p>The downgrader continuously shattered more than a hundred enchanted barriers and seals that were set up by Zheng.</p>

  <p>It was effortless for Zheng to create these enchanted barriers and seals. With the support of the infinite energy, he could construct them without a stop.</p>

  <p>At the same time, he was also monitoring the downgrader's movements in the black light. When the downgrader attacked the innermost enchanted barrier, Zheng would infuse it with the infinite energy.</p>

  <p>This way, it would take a lot of time and energy before the downgrader could break every enchanted barrier. Consequently, he wouldn't be able to destroy all the enchanted barriers in one go.</p>

  <p>For quite a while, the downgrader had indulged himself in breaking the enchanted barriers randomly. However, he soon noticed that the sheer number of the barriers that Zheng had set up was far beyond his imagination.</p>

  <p>There would be no end to it if he just continued breaking them one by one. Thus, he temporarily stopped and thought of a way out.</p>

  <p>At this moment, he was trapped inside an ice tomb. With the aid of the infinite Extreme Form energy, the ice tomb could actually freeze everything close to it.</p>

  <p>However, the downgrader saw this as a chance to escape.</p>

  <p>Although the ice tomb was pretty sturdy and powerful, its weakness was obvious. It would be completely restrained by the Flame Extreme Form.</p>

  <p>Even if the ice tomb was endowed with absolute infinite energy, it would still be easy to break it using the Flame Extreme Form.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>In an instant, the downgrader started brewing the Flame Extreme Form in his hands.</p>

  <p>His slender arms suddenly stretched out of the black light and swept towards the surrounding ice tomb.</p>

  <p>"Break!"</p>

  <p>Crash! Boom!</p>

  <p>With an enormous impact, the huge ice tomb collapsed without difficulty.</p>

  <p>The moment Zheng felt that the ice tomb collapsed, he attempted to gather absolute infinite energy to infuse into the next seal. However, the downgrader was well prepared this time and was much faster to take action.</p>

  <p>"Break all the enchanted barriers!"</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>Vicious flames formed violent torrents that erupted on a large scale.</p>

  <p>Without the support of the infinite energy, the enchanted barriers were unable to resist the flames that were released by the downgrader. All the seals and enchanted barriers seemed like thin sheets of paper that were instantly engulfed by a sea of flames.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>As the downgrader shattered all the enchanted barriers, his voice once again echoed throughout the Burial Land.</p>

  <p>"Do you think you could suppress me with such petty tricks? Think again!</p>

  <p>You're too confident because the Burial Land is protecting you? Then I'll destroy every inch of it! Let's see how you could face me afterward!"</p>

  <p>While the black light could make the downgrader be reborn infinitely, the Burial Land acted the same for Zheng.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the primitive land gave Zheng more abilities. Currently, this wasn't an equal battle anymore.</p>

  <p>Even the downgrader had to admit that he wouldn't be able to defeat Zheng if he didn't destroy the Burial Land completely.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the downgrader appeared at the edge of the Burial Land.</p>

  <p>A golden sun rose from his body, devouring all the surrounding materials, and burning a huge hole into the Burial Land.</p>

  <p>Then, the downgrader flew along the edge. As the golden sun continued to devour the ground, a huge gap soon appeared on the surface of the Burial Land.</p>

  <p>As Zheng saw this, he immediately rushed over and tried to stop the downgrader.</p>

  <p>However, the downgrader's body movements were so fast. His body flickered here and there, and the next moment, he was already at the other end of the Burial Land, continuing to devour the land with violent flames.</p>

  <p>If one stood far from the Burial Land, it would seem like a ferocious bug had infested and devoured the Burial Land and left it with several huge holes.</p>

  <p>As the countless holes accumulated to a certain extent, the Burial Land finally collapsed with a loud bang.</p>

  <p>Zheng wasn't able to do anything to stop its destruction. In the end, he could just helplessly watch it being razed to the ground.</p>

  <p>However, just as the Burial Land collapsed, a subtle sensation suddenly arose within Zheng's soul. He felt as if he had merged into a larger primitive land.</p>

  <p>'Wait. Outside the Burial Land should only be the chaos.</p>

  <p>How could there be a primitive land?'</p>

  <p>Zheng was utterly confused as he didn't understand what had just happened.</p>

  <p>"What's that look on your face? Are you surprised?"</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the voice of the Evil God resounded in his ears.</p>

  <p>As Zheng turned around, he saw that the figure of the Evil God was slowly condensing at a distance. His eyes were filled with a familiar mockery as he said, "You were not able to defeat the downgrader after all the time you wasted? What a good-for-nothing. Should you step aside and let me do it for you instead?"</p>
