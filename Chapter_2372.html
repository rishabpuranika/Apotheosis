</p>

  <p>Zheng manipulated the giant bugs to wipe out the period of time.</p>

  <p>Outside of the Time Sea Forbidden Land, Nicholas took a small step back as the space in front of him became a little blurry.</p>

  <p>The Sun Blind race's leader also stepped back as all the Holy Beings and Demi-holy Beings looked on with confusion and astonishment.</p>

  <p>"You all are seeing this, right?" Jeremiah asked, frowning. "Something's wrong with the divine land's time...?"</p>

  <p>Clark nodded. For the first time he was very quiet.</p>

  <p>The time flow rate within the jade seal was different from that of the outside world. Although the consummate True Gods and Zheng had spent about twenty days inside the jade seal, the Astronomical Transit Day in the Time Sea hadn't ended yet.</p>

  <p>"Someone just stole three seconds from the world," Nicholas said warily.</p>

  <p>He looked through the Time Sea Forbidden Land and stared at the jade seal.</p>

  <p>"Looks like someone has obtained the jade seal," a Holy Being observed.</p>

  <p>"Is this the ability of the jade seal?"</p>

  <p>Was it?</p>

  <p>Since they couldn't see through the jade seal, they weren't sure about what exactly was happening inside.</p>

  <p>They only hoped that everything would be revealed soon.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, at the bottom of the cave, Zheng stood as still as a statue. His usually calm expression was replaced with the tiniest hint of surprise.</p>

  <p>Through the jade seal, he felt like he had acquired a new definition of time and a greater understanding of it.</p>

  <p>If the time of the divine land could be described as a book, then every three seconds would be a page that was continuously turned by an invisible hand.</p>

  <p>Page by page, second by second, minute by minute, day by day, month by month, year by year, age by age. Time was a big old book and the giant bugs were moths eating at the pages.</p>

  <p>Judging from time, each page was a complete but static divine land.</p>

  <p>Just now, following Zheng's order, the huge bugs had devoured a separated static divine land.</p>

  <p>Like silkworms polishing off a leaf, they had wolfed down the page where Nelly died in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>The page contained how Nelly would die— torn into pieces by the consummate True Gods' weapons.</p>

  <p>If Zheng hadn't ripped the page off and the whole thing had come into existence, then Nelly would've already been dead.</p>

  <p>"You! What did you do?" Rachelle marched towards Zheng with an accusing finger.</p>

  <p>She realized that the weird thing happening in front of them must have something to do with the jade seal.</p>

  <p>But Rachelle was not a Holy Being.</p>

  <p>Holy Beings had a sharper sense of time, as after their universes were established, the different time flow rate in the universes became a point of reference. Meaning that while Zheng only had the giant bugs steal three seconds from the divine land, the Holy Beings had noticed a period of time disappear.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Rachelle and the other consummate True Gods weren't able to feel the subtle change in time. However, what happened was unusual and baffling, and they would be stupid not to care.</p>

  <p>"Nothing. I just tore a page from a book," Zheng smiled.</p>

  <p>Rachelle scowled. "What the hell are you talking about?"</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the consummate True Gods wanted to attack again.</p>

  <p>"Stop playing tricks. Don't think I can't kill you."</p>

  <p>"It's just the ability of the jade seal. Kill him and take it from him!"</p>

  <p>Zheng clenched his hand tighter around the jade seal. "Before I forget, this jade seal grants its user control over space and time here. Still think you can kill me?" That said, Zheng grabbed Nelly's collar and gently pulled her backwards.</p>

  <p>Nelly, still in a daze, was dragged into the bronze wall where she and Zheng disappeared in a flash of light. Rachelle and the others could only look at each other wordlessly. What just happened?</p>

  <p>"What the heck?! I killed a shadow but it somehow recovered and even slashed at me!" Walton spat angrily as he stalked over to them with his machete, his chest marred with a deep bloody gash.</p>

  <p>Seeing the puzzled expressions on the faces of Rachelle and the rest, Walton became even more puzzled. "Where is he? Didn't you block that brat from the Luo Clan?"</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Zheng and Nelly reappeared outside the Heavenly Wheel Temple. He adjusted his hold on Nelly as they floated high in the air and looked at the world below.</p>

  <p>This world inside the jade seal could be considered as an independent world.</p>

  <p>It was different from the universes. The universes were built by the Holy Beings with their great efforts and understanding. They were attached to the divine land so the Godly Ways could be used in them.</p>

  <p>But they couldn't be employed here.</p>

  <p>This world was independent with the entrance right in the center of the sea of bugs.</p>

  <p>When Nelly came back to her senses, she found herself ten thousand feet above the ground. The Heavenly Wheel Temple below had turned into a small dot and out of fear, she twisted her waist and tried to slide down.</p>

  <p>Realizing her mistake, she instinctively reached out and grabbed Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>Zheng adjusted his hold on her and looked down to find the aboriginals still kneeling on the ground.</p>

  <p>The aboriginals knew that they had offended the Heavenly Wheel Snake and were afraid of its fury. If it released the Heavenly Wheel Bugs in the sea of bugs, the Eagle race, the Swallow race, and the Roc race would all be in grave danger.</p>

  <p>However, they had no choice but to kneel on the ground and pray for the forgiveness of the Heavenly Wheel Snake. Those outsiders, after all, were not their allies.</p>

  <p>"Let's get down," Zheng said flatly.</p>

  <p>Nelly didn't respond. All the muscles in her body were tense and her face was probably flushed. She looked away, desperate to hide her burning ears.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The wind on her face helped cool her down but she knew her face was still red. As soon as her feet touched the ground, she quickly freed herself from Zheng's arms. Her heart was still racing, and it would stay like that for quite a while.</p>

  <p>When the aboriginals saw them descending from the sky, their eyes went wide and their jaws fell open.</p>

  <p>"They are back!"</p>

  <p>The little boy exclaimed happily as he ran all the way into Nelly's arms.</p>

  <p>He and the other children had almost been eaten by the Heavenly Wheel Snake before, but thanks to the consummate True Gods, they had been saved from death.</p>

  <p>However, the failed worship had made all the aboriginals quite uneasy.</p>

  <p>The Eagle race's chief walked up to them nervously. "Where is the Heavenly Wheel Snake now?"</p>

  <p>It would be a good thing for them if the Heavenly Wheel Snake had been killed by this group of strong warriors that appeared from outside.</p>

  <p>But now, only Zheng and Nelly had returned. Did the Heavenly Wheel Snake eat the others?</p>

  <p>"You no longer need to worship that snake," Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>"What!" The chief's eyes almost bulged out.</p>

  <p>Everyone else exchanged confused glances. What was he saying?</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Wheel Snake had been subdued by the consummate True Gods but Zheng didn't know if they had killed it.</p>

  <p>However, he understood that the Heavenly Wheel Snake was able to drive the bugs only with the jade seal in its hand. In other words, the Heavenly Wheel Snake had been guarding the jade seal in this temple.</p>

  <p>Now that the jade seal belonged to Zheng, the existence of the Heavenly Wheel Snake had lost its meaning, so there was no need for them to worship the snake anymore.</p>

  <p>"I-I still can't understand what you mean," the chief said hesitantly.</p>

  <p>Zheng grinned. "You can think of that snake as dead!"</p>
