<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 537 Miserable Failure (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>However, Akiba didn't know that apart from the God's blessing, Tianming had also cultivated hard.</p>

  <p>Tianming had never rested since the beginning of his swordsmanship practice. For more than a dozen years, he carried the sword with him even during meals and sleep.</p>

  <p>To achieve the same progress as Tianming, a cultivator could not just rely on luck. Instead, painstaking efforts, hard work, persistence, and hardships were vital for success.</p>

  <p>After taking a few steps away from Akiba, Tianming lifted his Blood-corroding Sword and pointed it toward the sky. Shortly after, energy of heaven and earth began to surge in the sky. In the next instant, dim thunder and lightning flashed across the clouds.</p>

  <p>"This is... Heavenly Sword!" As Akiba felt the terrifying momentum, his facial expression changed abruptly.</p>

  <p>On the other side, Eddy's eyes twitched. Tianming had mastered the use of the Heavenly Sword. It became even harder to believe that Tianming was ranked third at Cloud Sect. Eddy was certain that no one would shake him from this belief, even if they beat him to death.</p>

  <p>Could a person at the third grade of the nature level be a match for Tianming? How could this be possible?</p>

  <p>Tianming had proven his strengths no matter Eddy believed it or not.</p>

  <p>In the turbulent sky, Tianming induced streaks of heavenly thunder.</p>

  <p>When Tianming battled with Zheng during the All Peaks Competition, he hadn't used his Heavenly Sword in combination with heavenly thunder despite his mastery of combining thunderbolt with sword intent in the Sword Washing Pool. After all, he needed some time to adapt to the Extreme Thunder Sword Intent since he had just learned it for the first time.</p>

  <p>After a month of cultivation, Tianming had become more proficient with the use of the Extreme Thunder Sword Intent. While initiating the force of heaven, he also triggered the heavenly thunder, thereby leading to the horrible scene in the sky.</p>

  <p>"This swordsmanship is extraordinary..."</p>

  <p>Both Zheng and Patrick gasped when they saw Tianming's new move. It was true that they had beaten Tianming during the All Peaks Competition.</p>

  <p>However, they could now see that Tianming could not be underestimated.</p>

  <p>Only a month had passed since the All Peaks Competition, and yet, Tianming had mastered the essence of that move. Now, he was able to harness mightier strengths with this move.</p>

  <p>"Gosh!" muttered Akiba as his face turned livid. Before this fight, he had been confident about his victory. But at this moment, he was cursing himself for having annoyed the disciples at Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>At this point, it didn't matter if he regretted his actions. He had no other choice but to fight until the end!</p>

  <p>"Ocean Immensity of Streaming Swordsmanship!"</p>

  <p>As Akiba adopted this tactic of his Streaming Swordsmanship, numerous ripples surged like seawater and slowly gushed out beside him.</p>

  <p>Now, he only hoped that he could resist Tianming's sword with his Streaming Swordsmanship. Fortunately, the Ocean Immensity was a swordsmanship tactic useful for defense, and it could engulf all moves like an ocean.</p>

  <p>Akiba had previously diffused assaults from much stronger masters by using this tactic.</p>

  <p>However, when his move met Tianming's, the ripples died...</p>

  <p>Tianming produced irresistible power and might by using the force of heaven in combination with heavenly thunder, which deflected the ripples created by Akiba's Ocean Immensity. Apparently, Tianming was in an advantageous position.</p>

  <p>"Tinkling!"</p>

  <p>A sound was heard when Tianming's sword clashed with Akiba's Ocean Immensity and unraveled it. At the same time, his sword collided with Akiba's Dragon Sword.</p>

  <p>Immediately, the Dragon Sword flew out of Akiba's hand. After swirling over the sky for quite a while, it embedded itself in a stone table. The Dragon Sword was so sharp that it could easily pierce the stone table as though the table were a piece of bean curd.</p>

  <p>"I...I lost..." yelled Akiba in a daze. He couldn't believe that he had been defeated so quickly...</p>

  <p>Tianming responded with a flat smile. Then, he returned his sword to his sheath, stepped back, and stood behind Kenneth where he had been before the fight.</p>

  <p>At this moment, all disciples of Red Sect who stood on the other side fell silent. Akiba had been the strongest among them. Since Akiba had been beaten by Cloud Sect, it was pointless for them to continue challenging and fighting.</p>

  <p>Eddy laughed in embarrassment. At last, he cupped his hands, bowed to Kenneth and said, "I would like to congratulate you. You have got such an outstanding disciple! Your disciples will undoubtedly be valued once they join Cloud Hall!"</p>

  <p>Since his disciple had won in the fight and put his sect in a favorable position, Kenneth snorted and replied with a sneer, "Well, we hope so.</p>

  <p>Tianming is quite talented, but he only won the third place at this All Peaks Competition. The quota for our Cloud Sect is too limited, or else more of our disciples would have joined the Cloud Road."</p>

  <p>If Akiba's skills qualified him to take the Cloud Road, then Tracy and Jacques would have also been eligible. Regretfully, Cloud Sect only selected three disciples for the Cloud Road.</p>

  <p>"Oh? Kenneth, Tianming is so gifted, but he only won the third place. On the contrary, the winner is a cultivator who is only at the third grade of the nature level. I am bewildered. How did this guy beat Tianming?" Eddy asked with great curiosity.</p>

  <p>In fact, all disciples of Red Sect were baffled by this question. It was difficult for them to believe that Zheng's strengths were enough to defeat Tianming since they hadn't witnessed that match.</p>

  <p>To answer their questions, Kenneth laughed and stated, "If you want to confirm whether or not this is true, select an older disciple of your sect to battle with Zheng. Then, you will witness his abilities and understand why he was able to defeat Tianming. Am I right? Heh, heh!"</p>
