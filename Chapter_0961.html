<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The warriors were incredibly dumbstruck at the sight of the supreme life vitality crystal in front of them.</p>

  <p>Even if they were warriors in the Illuminating Soul Realm, a supreme life vitality crystal was still a massive fortune for them.</p>

  <p>Not everyone was as good as Luo Zheng when it came to making money. He was very capable and this was evident back in the Eastern Region when he used heavenly essence to easily earn cubic crystals. After his arrival in the Central Region, Luo Zheng delved into learning the technique of drawing divine textures. Now, given his high level of skill, any sect would be willing to pay whatever rate he provided just for him to set up a sect protecting array for them.</p>

  <p>A third-grade sect like Fish Dragon Sect did not even have the right to ask him for such a favor…</p>

  <p>One of the warriors swallowed thickly, "But… it's too much," he stammered.</p>

  <p>"After paying the bill, the rest will be yours," Luo Zheng told them.</p>

  <p>Their eyes sparkled with excitement, "R-Really?!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded in confirmation. The amount he offered them would surely be enough.</p>

  <p>However, to his surprise, the warriors shook their heads. It was too good to be true from their perspective. To offer them something so precious like the supreme life vitality crystal for so little either meant Luo Zheng was baiting them or he was an idiot. Luo Zheng was certainly not an idiot.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng sighed at their hesitation. "I don't have any requests. I just want to hear about Miss Xi's story," he said. "Tell me and the supreme life vitality crystal is yours."</p>

  <p>One of the warriors blinked doubtfully, "Is that really all?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded. "Yes."</p>

  <p>A strange expression appeared on the warriors' faces. One of them leaned forward. "You just arrived in Ethereal City, right?" he asked Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I just arrived."</p>

  <p>"No wonder you wanted to know!" the warrior remarked. "It's not really a secret, almost everyone in Ethereal City is talking about it right now."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng frowned, "Don't tell me…" he said faintly. "Does this Miss Xi actually have the extremely rare Purple Power Body?"</p>

  <p>The warrior's eyes widened. "Oh, you knew about it already?"</p>

  <p>Zheng's gaze flickered. "I just guessed." This new piece of information he had obtained certainly made the situation extremely troublesome. His biggest weakness was his sister, Yan. Except for that, nothing else would make him a bundle of nerves. Back when he was only at the Illuminating Soul Realm, he had managed to kill Marilyn and delay Eddie's plans, thus, keeping his sister relatively safe for the time being. Who would've thought another Purple Power Body would appear here in Ethereal City?</p>

  <p>"Miss Xi does possess the Purple Power Body," the warrior confirmed.</p>

  <p>"She has been targeted by Eddie and everyone in the Ethereal City has been panicking. We figure that it's only a matter of time before he leads his Heavenly Evil Sect to attack us."</p>

  <p>Despite Eddie declaring his sect as the Heavenly Evil Divine Kingdom, nobody really recognized it so they just referred to it as the Heavenly Evil Sect.</p>

  <p>"Since that's the case, why doesn't she just find someone to marry?" Luo Zheng asked. "If she gets married, wouldn't that solve everything?"</p>

  <p>Despite the competition between the Ethereal Spirit Sect and Cloud Hall, both of them shared the same sentiments when it came to Eddie. If Eddie successfully managed to set up the Lustful Demon Array, he would be able to improve his cultivation level and step into the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>Once that happened, he would be virtually unstoppable. No one in Central Region, not even the great sects like the Ethereal Spirit Sect, World Commercial Alliance, Cloud Hall, Mysterious Luna Hall, nor the Bloodwood Cliff would be able to resist him. For all the sects, big or small, it was either they swore their allegiance to Eddie or be wiped out forever!</p>

  <p>The appearance of another Purple Power Body threatened the entire existence of everyone in the Central Region. The Ethereal Spirit Sect didn't want Eddie to find the third Purple Power Body either.</p>

  <p>The warrior laughed bitterly at Zheng's words. "That's exactly what we are complaining about. Do you know the identity of Miss Xi?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shook his head. "What kind of special identity does she have?"</p>

  <p>Even though the Xi Clan was a third-grade sect, it would still be impossible for them to disobey Eddie's wishes.</p>

  <p>"Our Ethereal Spirit Sect leader's name is Xander and his surname is Xi," the warrior told Luo Zheng. "He has since become a Taoist while still wearing his hair. However, despite being a Taoist, he has his own family with a wife and kids in the Xi clan. Miss Xi is actually his great-granddaughter!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded at the warrior's explanation.</p>

  <p>"I see. But this is still a very serious and important matter. It's his duty to marry her off for the sake of the greater good!"</p>

  <p>"Everyone shares the same opinion as you," the warrior agreed with a helpless expression on his face. "But the young lady is the apple of her family's eyes and is greatly favored by Xander. Although they have introduced several excellent talents from the Ethereal Spirit Sect to her, she refused every single one of them!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyebrows furrowed. This was indeed troublesome. As long as Eddie was alive, the problem would always exist. A Purple Power Body had already appeared in Ethereal City so who was to say that there wouldn't be another one in Cloudy City? Purple Power Bodies were indeed rare but there were too many people residing in the Central Region and one of them was bound to possibly possess it. The probability of Eddie finding one was not small at all.</p>

  <p>In the end, Luo Zheng still had to kill Eddie to save Yan.</p>

  <p>But, for the time being, he had no choice but to intervene in this matter with Miss Xi. If Eddie did truly come to take her away, it wouldn't just be a problem for her, but also a nightmare for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He mulled over just how he should solve this. Luo Zheng could kill Marilyn because she was Eddie's woman but Miss Xi was Xander's great-granddaughter. He couldn't just go up to their residence and stab her to death with his sword.</p>

  <p>While Luo Zheng was lost in his thoughts, one of the warriors spoke, "In my opinion, we should just find a man to sleep with her and take away her virginity energy. That's the best solution! It's truly a pity that the Xi Clan is a noble clan with a sect leader. They are too conventional!"</p>

  <p>"Find a man to sleep with her…"</p>

  <p>The warrior's words were crude but reasonable. As long as Miss Xi's virginity energy was taken away, Eddie would give up on her. The question was who would sleep with her?</p>

  <p>"A spy from the Heavenly Evil Sect was caught two days ago. It seems Eddie's already preparing to take action. I think it won't be long before he comes to our city to take her away," another warrior remarked.</p>

  <p>His words made Luo Zheng more anxious. This matter had just become an urgent issue that needed to be solved. Making up his mind, Luo Zheng silently stood up and walked out of the Moon Pavilion.</p>

  <p>"Hey! Your supreme life vitality crystal!"</p>

  <p>None of the warriors dared to take the supreme life vitality crystal he left behind.</p>

  <p>"Take it!" Luo Zheng told them. "It's your reward."</p>

  <p>Loud fighting noises immediately came from the Moon Pavilion as soon as he was out the door. It seemed the warriors were now fighting over the supreme life vitality crystal he had given them.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng ignored them and continued his way. At that moment, his sword spirit condensed next to him and Xun appeared. She floated lightly beside him and attracted the attention of passersby.</p>

  <p>Xun kept pace with Luo Zheng. She faced Luo Zheng with a gentle smile on her face. "What are you worrying about? The solution is so simple!" she told Luo Zheng with a gentle voice.</p>

  <p>"Just sleep with her!" she remarked with a smile.</p>

  <p>In the Demon Night race, the females far outweighed the population of males. Being the queen, Xun did not avoid talking about such things with him and Luo Zheng had come to realize that the customs between races were very much varied.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was greatly troubled, "We should at least find a man."</p>

  <p>Xun suddenly pointed a slender finger at him.</p>

  <p>"Me?!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng quickly shook his head. "No. No, I can't!"</p>

  <p>Xun blinked her eyes and pouted. "Then what do you want to do?" she blinked her eyes and asked.</p>

  <p>"Let's wait and see first," he said. It was a rather complicated situation given Miss Xi's status. He wondered what Xander was going to do to solve this. Would he just continue to let his great-granddaughter act like this until Eddie finally came to take her away?</p>

  <p>He didn't know that Xander was, in fact, also very troubled!</p>

  <p>News about his great-granddaughter possessing a Purple Power Body had spread and there was no way to stop it.</p>

  <p>In the past, such news would be received very happily by the clan.</p>

  <p>However, these were sensitive times with the threat of Eddie hanging over their heads. He just happened to be short of a Purple Power Body for him to successfully set up the Lustful Demon Array.</p>

  <p>Both leaders of the Cloud Hall and the World Commercial Alliance shared his concern and had already successively urged Xander to marry off his precious great-granddaughter.</p>

  <p>Xander was trying his best. He had even suggested for the clan's master to use domestic discipline to punish her into relenting. However, it was hopeless. No amount of coaxing or threatening could get his great-granddaughter to yield. Her strong personality made her extremely obstinate and she claimed that she would rather die than marry someone she did not like.</p>

  <p>It was probably because of reading all those romantic novels. It made her obsessed with the idea of true love. Xander was an old man. He couldn't possibly understand what went on in his teenage great-granddaughter's head.</p>

  <p>In any case, she had to be married off right away. Otherwise, they would all be doomed!</p>
