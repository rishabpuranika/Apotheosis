<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The space crack in front of them was quickly ripped open by Max's crutch. Seeing that, Delroy clapped his hands and swiftly opened his palms. In an instant, an enchanted barrier spread open in the crack.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…"</p>

  <p>The ominous whoosh of the wind reminded them of their limited time as the thing behind them got closer and closer.</p>

  <p>Even without his magical vision, Zheng was still able to make out the gigantic outline of a head that had opened its huge mouth, intending to swallow the Eight-diagram Wheel in one gulp.</p>

  <p>The Eight-diagram Wheel was around fifty feet wide but it looked like a tiny mosquito compared to that huge, cavernous mouth.</p>

  <p>If one turned around and squinted, he or she would be able to make out a few shadows that resided within that mouth. However, it was too dim around that they couldn't distinguish the shape of these shadows. The horrible outlines of these mysterious beings caused a shiver to run up everyone's spine.</p>

  <p>The Shadow Creature advanced at a frighteningly fast rate, quickly closing the distance with the warriors. Failure to go through the space crack and get out of the void in time would mean death by being swallowed into its huge, gaping mouth.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Hank suddenly took out a sharp weapon. Clenching his teeth, he cut his wrist open and slapped on the Eight-diagram Wheel!</p>

  <p>"Splash!"</p>

  <p>Instead of red, a stream of golden blood burst out and was immediately absorbed by the Eight-diagram Wheel.</p>

  <p>"Let's go!"</p>

  <p>"Whoosh…"</p>

  <p>Hank's blood obviously activated something in the Eight-diagram Wheel as rays of bright light suddenly burst out and it increased its speed twofold!</p>

  <p>The light also illuminated the shadows that they had all noticed earlier and everyone gasped in astonishment at what they saw.</p>

  <p>Delroy and Max, however, looked more nervous than shocked, seemingly already aware of what they were currently facing.</p>

  <p>Thankfully, because of its increased speed, the Eight-diagram Wheel was finally able to enter the space crack!</p>

  <p>Seeing its prey have escaped, the Shadow Creature suddenly let out a cold aura that spread and covered the entirety of the Eight-diagram Wheel.</p>

  <p>This aura contained a variety of negative emotions like the desire for violence, bloodlust, cruelty, and reluctance to admit defeat.</p>

  <p>"Humph! That thing can only survive in the void. Once it steps out, it would be like a fish out of water and will surely not survive. It won't dare come out and chase us," Max huffed with a cold snort just as they rushed out of the void. His words might have been sure but his face was still as pale as ever.</p>

  <p>However, just as he finished his words, they heard the sharp whistle of the wind above their heads.</p>

  <p>"What the hell is this!?" Woody shouted at the sight of sharp wind blades rushing towards them. A couple would've been alright but there were millions above them!</p>

  <p>None of these Spirit Supreme Realm warriors from the Celestial Position race ever took anything from the Lower World seriously. They never thought there would be something here in this great world that would actually render them speechless.</p>

  <p>Both cyan and black wind blades rushed after them. The wild, cyan ones contained the power of four layers of the Wind Law while the black ones contained five layers of Wind Law.</p>

  <p>Zheng had warned them about the dangerous storms in the Chaotic Ocean of Stars before they set out but nobody took it seriously. None of them were prepared for the strength of the coming storm because they weren't able to fathom just what kind of devastation it could entail. These seven were powerful masters at the Spirit Supreme Realm who could enter the Feather Holy Sea as they pleased, unlike the other Soul Sea Realm warriors who could only utilize corpses to explore. They had great faith in their strength and capacity to weather any challenges that might arise for them, be it monsters or some kind of dangerous storm.</p>

  <p>However, the sight of these wind blades above them told them just how wrong they were to have underestimated Zheng's warning.</p>

  <p>"Clang! Clang! Clang!"</p>

  <p>Seven to eight pitch-black wind blades charged at them all at once.</p>

  <p>Tiernan acted quickly, twisting his fiery red sickle and slicing the blades in pieces before they could do any damage.</p>

  <p>However, his attack just then had already used 80% of his strength! The huge counterforce shook the entire Eight-diagram Wheel violently.</p>

  <p>A few wind blades were nothing, but millions of them… well, it was another matter entirely.</p>

  <p>Despite slicing a couple of blades, more than ten thousand were already on their way to them, sending everyone to a mild panic.</p>

  <p>"Delroy! What are you doing? Open the enchanted barrier!" Woody roared.</p>

  <p>Delroy sent him a scathing glare before clapping his hands once again.</p>

  <p>An enchanted barrier instantly wrapped everyone inside but there was a catch. "My enchanted barrier can't block the fifth layer Wind Law!"</p>

  <p>A violent crashing sound came from above them just as he finished speaking. The onslaught of wind blades was too much and Delroy's enchanted barrier shattered under the powerful pressure.</p>

  <p>The Law of Causality might be considered as a kind of superior law however it was still divided into levels. Delroy's enchanted barrier contained the Law of Causality but he had only comprehended a low level which made it susceptible to caving in under the attack of a higher level Original Law. Besides, there were millions of wind blades.</p>

  <p>Millions!</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't have counted on you!" Woody shrieked, waving the Black Nether Saber in his hand desperately. A black aura burst out from the saber and lots of black energy shot out from it.</p>

  <p>"Puff puff puff…"</p>

  <p>Dull bursts of sound could be heard as the blades in the air and the energy from Woody met and clashed in the middle. Woody's black blade energy was able to shatter a few cyan wind blades but was instantly devoured by the black wind blades.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>The black wind blades continued their descent and rushed towards Zheng at an extremely fast rate!</p>

  <p>The sight immediately put him on edge and he put his guard up immediately. Zheng knew he could not count on any of these Spirit Supreme Realm masters to help him. They were all too busy trying to fight off the legions of wind blades that threatened to end them all.</p>

  <p>"Be careful!" Dorothea shouted, noticing he was in trouble. She'd help but she was currently preoccupied with dodging the other wind blades.</p>

  <p>The black wind blades were almost within reach. Noticing this, Zheng quickly clenched his fists and gathered the power of his dragon scales, aiming a punch towards the oncoming attack.</p>

  <p>"You idiot! Do you want to cut your own hand off?!" Woody screamed when he saw what Zheng was about to do. As Spirit Supreme Realm masters, they would never dare face these blades head-on. The power of five layers of Wind Law was no joke. Even if it was the divine weapon, the Black Nether Saber that hit the wind blades, they would notch the saber. How could Zheng just punch them away with his fist?</p>

  <p>"Bang bang bang bang bang…"</p>

  <p>Of course, Zheng simply ignored Woody. He waved his fist and formed shadows that began to attack the black wind blades headed for him. To everyone's surprise and wonder, the black wind blades immediately shattered to pieces.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng was in perfectly one piece, unharmed and unbothered.</p>

  <p>Woody couldn't help but stare at him with his mouth gaping open. He was so shocked that he even forgot where he was and that there were millions of wind blades headed his way. He could only dumbly stare at Zheng and wonder just how he did the stunt just now.</p>

  <p>What was this fellow's body made of? A divine weapon? A supreme divine weapon? Or something that was even more powerful than a supreme divine weapon…</p>

  <p>It wasn't just Woody. Dorothea, Delroy, Max, Hank, and everyone else had seen Zheng's actions and the surprise on their faces was evident.</p>

  <p>It was true that Zheng had received recognition from the Celestial Position race and was regarded with a high standard. However, he was still a martial artist from the Lower World and would have to prove himself deserving of the title he had claimed.</p>

  <p>They never did bother to find out Zheng's actual strength…</p>

  <p>What was a mere first-level Life and Death Realm warrior to a group of powerful Spirit Supreme Realm masters after all?</p>

  <p>They didn't even take Derek, a Spirit Supreme Realm master, seriously so what more Zheng? Their race was made up of elites and the gap between a human and a Celestial Position member both at the Spirit Supreme Realm was huge.</p>

  <p>But here was Zheng, breaking all these preconceived notions they had for him. Just how did he shatter those frighteningly powerful wind blades that contained five layers of the power of the Wind Law!? Sure, he might have some type of magic strength that helped him destroy the wind blades but still! Even a Spirit Supreme Realm warrior would've been instantly cut in half if he or she was hit by the wind blades but Zheng was able to come out unscathed!</p>
