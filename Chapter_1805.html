<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1805 The Titles Of The Godly Geniuses </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The existence of these ten Godly Geniuses was imperative to the entire universe.</p>

  <p>With their talents, they would eventually grow to become world lords and then break through the limitation of the heavens. However, not much time was left to do so.</p>

  <p>Some Supreme Lords had determined that it would take some more time for their enemies to break through the Sighing Wall.</p>

  <p>This could take a hundred years or even a thousand years, but it could also be achieved within ten years.</p>

  <p>The ancient sorcerer race had already taken action, which meant that the other side was prepared�</p>

  <p>In sending the Godly Geniuses to the Celestial Position, the purpose was that they finally landed in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>It was said that the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land did not belong to this universe, but it was not located in the divine land either. Rather, it originated from some special part of the divine land.</p>

  <p>Even True Gods were only capable of constructing their own inner worlds.</p>

  <p>Only a Holy Being could construct a true land outside of the divine land.</p>

  <p>It was said that the Holy Being who had built the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land had a mysterious existence within the divine land. It was not known why he had built it.</p>

  <p>He did not construct a giant world like the universe to stabilize himself.</p>

  <p>The Divine Refinement Forbidden Land he had built was a cultivation ground.</p>

  <p>Not only did the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land accept creatures from the inner worlds of the great Holy Beings, which were also the creatures in the universes, newborn creatures from the divine land were also welcome there.</p>

  <p>True Gods had their own descendants, known as newborn creatures.</p>

  <p>In a sense, the divine land was the true main world. Living beings like Luo Zheng, who were born into the inner world of a Holy Being, belonged to the first level of life...</p>

  <p>When the vast majority of newborn creatures were born, they spent their time cultivating in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. It was the land where they could be trained into a True God, after all.</p>

  <p>And although most of the newborn creatures were descendants of the True Gods, it was not easy for them to become True Gods themselves. In reality, a vast majority of the newborn creatures were cruelly eliminated.</p>

  <p>This brutal law applied to the universe, as well as to the divine land.</p>

  <p>"Entering the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land is a special occasion for us� the warriors of the universe. I hope you all can seize this chance well..." Master Feng reminded Luo Zheng and the others as he finished explaining the details of the land.</p>

  <p>"If we are to enter the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, won't we have to pass through the Sighing Wall and leave the universe?" Lucille asked.</p>

  <p>To the warriors, the Sighing Wall seemed as if it was the last layer of protection in the universe. If it were so easy to penetrate, would it not be too easy for invaders from the other universes to enter and create havoc?</p>

  <p>Master Feng understood Lucille instantly. "The Sighing Wall is not how you perceive it to be. It's no real wall, rather it's just a way of filtering those who try to enter it. The stronger a person, the harder it is for him or her to pass through the wall."</p>

  <p>Lucille seemed confused, so Master Feng continued, "Furthermore, you will be transferred to the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land straightaway! All you need to do is cultivate in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. That place is not the Illusion Battlefield. After your death, you won't be able to reincarnate, let alone revive..."</p>

  <p>There was no true meaning of reincarnation in this world. Reincarnation of life in the universe began from gradual death, the turning into bones, turning into mud, then turning into a part of the universe, and finally becoming a part of the inner world of the Holy Being.</p>

  <p>However, even if the Celestial Position had the right to enter the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, they would need some time in advance for preparations. After all, it was no easy task to step in there.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and the others were told to wait in the core sacred place of the Celestial Position. While waiting, they could also cultivate in the Celestial Position's secret lands.</p>

  <p>In this core sacred place, the ones who had gathered together were naturally the core disciples of the Celestial Position after the change of blood. These core disciples were considered the most outstanding existences among the many races. After all, the mere fact that they had obtained recognition of the Celestial Position meant that they were extraordinary.</p>

  <p>However, they were not comparable to the ten Godly Geniuses.</p>

  <p>Still, Lucille and the others seemed to be in high spirits. They were all too happy to break the records of the secret lands.</p>

  <p>With their formidable talent and strength, they consecutively broke all sorts of records in the core sacred place, leaving their previous records far behind in a short span of less than ten days. This caused the other core disciples to fall into despair.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did not participate in the cultivation in the core sacred place, but it was not because he had something against the secret lands built by Celestial Position. After all, many of the methods used by the Celestial Position had originated from the divine land. Even if the resources in this universe were incomparable to those in the divine land, they had some unique aspects.</p>

  <p>However, currently Luo Zheng was more concerned with the will of the great worlds�</p>

  <p>Now that Luo Zheng knew of the ambitions of the ancient sorcerer race, he knew that they wanted to control the entire heavens.</p>

  <p>The will of the great worlds was still slowly unfurling, moving through countless flying passageways towards the universe. It seemed that the will would eventually seep in and diffuse into the universe. Was this the so-called control of the heavens?</p>

  <p>In this way, the effects of the will of the great worlds must not only be related to transfer of strength. A more powerful method probably existed in order to utilize it.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the ancient sorcerer race possessed that technique, but Luo Zheng had no means of inheriting it. He had to realize it by himself alone.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Luo Zheng had another query in his mind.</p>

  <p>The mysterious girl, Irene, was rumored to be the controller of the heavens. After all, she was well aware of the one hundred and twenty-eight Heavenly Destinies.</p>

  <p>However, now that the will of the great worlds was spreading, why was Irene turning a blind eye to it? Just what role did she play in the battle between these two universes?</p>

  <p>As of now, Luo Zheng could not figure this out, so he avoided his plan of using the Roaring Token to communicate.</p>

  <p>Regardless of the situation, Luo Zheng did not want the fact that he had fused with the will of the great worlds to be exposed�</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng calmed down and began cultivating during this period of time.</p>

  <p>One day, Luo Zheng saw Nathan and the others come over together, talking amongst themselves heartily.</p>

  <p>They were still too young. In fact, with their level of talent, cultivating in the secret lands of Celestial Position would not make too big of a difference to them.</p>

  <p>What they enjoyed were the records they created.</p>

  <p>When a record was broken, the core sacred place warriors mourned in grief, fearing that the new and stupendous records would not be surpassed in this grand era.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, do you want to give it a try?" The corners of Lawson's mouth quirked up as he stared at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was seated atop a tall pavilion, facing a lush and verdant mountain region. When he heard Lawson, he turned his head and asked with curiosity, "Try what?"</p>

  <p>"Ahh� today we went to the Tower of Illusory! It is known to possess the most accurate test of talent in the universe," Lawson said, laughing.</p>

  <p>"Oh, there's no need for me to try it out," Luo Zheng replied calmly.</p>

  <p>The Tower of Illusory and the Tower of Crystal were similar in terms of structure and function.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Zheng had entered the Tower of Crystal before, he naturally knew that Lawson was referring to the Talent Tablet in the Tower of Illusory.</p>

  <p>Tianming and the others were also following along. Luo Zheng and the rest heard Xenia whisper to Tianming. "Your Rakshasa title could be considered the third highest title, and it's even in gold. It's shocking. Only several hundred talents possess the golden titles in the Celestial Position; only five golden Celestial Position titles, seven golden Asura titles and nine golden Rakshasa titles. Nathan is too powerful because he has come to obtain the golden title of the Asura!"</p>

  <p>"I'm also powerful, for I'm the golden Rakshasa!" Mu Ning said with a smile, excitement evident on her face.</p>

  <p>Out of the ten Godly Geniuses, only Nathan had obtained the title of the golden Asura. Other than him, Mu Ning and the others were all golden Rakshasa. Xenia and Karl had obtained their titles in the Tower of Illusory several years ago.</p>

  <p>For the past few days, Mu Ning had been tagging along as they tried to cultivate in various secret lands. She didn't stick around Luo Zheng this time.</p>

  <p>Margaret's attention had latched on to Luo Zheng again. She was also a bit curious about Zheng's talent. Her figure floated lightly and she grabbed Zheng's arm, smiling sweetly as she said, "My darling, please go and take the test on the Talent Tablet, won't you?"</p>

  <p>Upon hearing her words, Nathan, Tianming, Kurt, and the rest all turned to look at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Not many knew that Luo Zheng had the title of the golden Celestial Position.</p>

  <p>The three towers were not linked. However, the head of the Celestial Position race should have known about it. After all, Dorothea and the rest must have reported it back then.</p>

  <p>"You can have a try. It won't take much time," Tianming said, smiling.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had wanted to refuse, but since the others had already been there, it did not seem like a good idea for him to deny the challenge. Under such circumstances, Luo Zheng had no choice but to agree.</p>

  <p>He was all too familiar with the testing process of the Talent Tablet. To simply enter it would not take him much time.</p>
