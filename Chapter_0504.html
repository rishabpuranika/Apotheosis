<br/><br/>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>A blood-colored figure was dashing from a distance, and not far behind it was Ken Luo following the figure.</p>

  <p>Of course, Ken must have heard Bryson's cry, so he came running to his brother's aid.</p>

  <p>"What the hell? How could Luo Luo Zheng defeat Bryson?" Ken could not believe it at first.</p>

  <p>But before he could even realize what just happened, he heard Blood Prisoner called Bryson his 'disciple'.</p>

  <p>When did Bryson become the Blood Prisoner's disciple?</p>

  <p>Although Ken knew that Bryson had kept the Blood Prisoner in the Luo Clan's cellar in order to fight against Luo Luo Zheng, he still didn't agree with the Blood Prisoner's cultivating method.</p>

  <p>The Blood Prisoner got his strength from eating people's flesh and blood.</p>

  <p>It was a heinous act, thus Ken believed it was the wrong path to take.</p>

  <p>Cooperating with a person like the Blood Prison was the same as asking a tiger for its fur. Any person who came close to the Blood Prisoner would eventually be eaten. But for Bryson to take such a risk, Ken knew that his brother had no other choice.</p>

  <p>But Ken didn't know that Bryson had become the Blood Prisoner's disciple and started to learn the evil practicing method.</p>

  <p>Still puzzled, Ken kept following the Blood Prisoner without any second thought. After all, it was necessary to immediately deal with the matter at hand.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng hit Bryson by only one hand. With the intensity of the attack, Bryson smashed into a house but was immediately followed by Luo Luo Zheng. Although the latter used only half of his overall strength, Bryson still found it difficult to dodge the attack.</p>

  <p>Soon, the members of the Luo Clan saw Luo Luo Zheng pulling a man by his collar as he walked out of the ruined house. Despite the man's face covered in blood, everyone recognized that it was Bryson Luo.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had defeated Bryson with just one casual punch.</p>

  <p>The members of the Luo Clan were satisfied with the sight of the defeated Bryson. They had clearly underestimated Luo Zheng's strength before.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the blood-colored figure appeared. The faces of all the members of the Luo Clan turned pale when they realized who the blood figure was.</p>

  <p>His body was red all over and it looked like the man had only flesh and blood with no skin at all.</p>

  <p>The strong odor of blood reminded everyone of hell.</p>

  <p>Even without looking at his face, everyone quickly recognized him.</p>

  <p>The notorious evil man was described in the official announcement in detail, and the moment he appeared, the members of the Luo Clan started murmuring about him.</p>

  <p>"The Blood Prisoner! It's the Blood Prisoner! He's actually staying in our house!" a young man exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"The Blood Prisoner just called Bryson his disciple. Has Bryson made the Blood Prisoner his master?" another one asked in surprise.</p>

  <p>"So that must be the reason. I realized that Bryson has a strong smell of blood in him. He finally learned 'Blood Evil Force' from the Blood Prisoner! So that explains the sudden disappearance of people from our clan! Bryson was practicing?" the third man said aloud.</p>

  <p>The members of the Luo Clan were not as strong as Luo Luo Zheng, but they were not foolish. Although Bryson tried to shake off the fact that people had been disappearing in the clan, he could not stop people from suspecting when the number of missing people started to increase. So, in order to cover it up, he forbade people from talking about it.</p>

  <p>Though it was strange, no one imagined that Bryson and the Blood Prisoner had something to do with the disappearances.</p>

  <p>But seeing the Blood Prisoner, people finally realized what happened before.</p>

  <p>The evil person who ate live human beings was living among them, and the master of the Luo Clan had actually learned the cultivation method of the Blood Prisoner.</p>

  <p>The Blood Prisoner drifted in the air, his hair waving back off his head.</p>

  <p>He stared at Luo Luo Zheng with his red eyes then licked his lips and shouted to Luo Luo Zheng,"Put my disciple down and let him go. If you follow my order, I will show you mercy by killing you before I eat your body. But if you don't, I will swallow you alive and you'll know the pain of dying slowly."</p>

  <p>The Blood Prisoner had a mania for eating people alive. He relished seeing them struggling and enjoyed listening as they screamed in pain.</p>

  <p>Fear could make a person's body more appetizing to the Blood Prisoner.</p>

  <p>That was why he would always start with a person's hands or feet and look at the expression on their faces as he gradually ate them alive.</p>

  <p>"Swallow me alive?" Luo Luo Zheng repeated the Blood Prisoner's words as if mocking him. He sneered at the Blood Prisoner,"Aren't you afraid that your teeth may break if you eat me?"</p>

  <p>"You fool! You're only at the third grade of the nature level. Do you know my level?" The Blood Prisoner replied to Luo Luo Zheng. A cold smile crossed Luo Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>"You're just at the first level of the Illuminating Soul Realm. Why are you so arrogant? Do you really think you're that strong?" Luo Luo Zheng asked. He sneered at the Blood Prisoner and laughed hysterically.</p>

  <p>Hearing Luo Zheng's remarks, the Blood Prisoner was dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>He thought Luo Luo Zheng was only a nature creature and didn't know what the Illuminating Soul Realm was at all. He asked such a question to intimidate Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, Luo Luo Zheng could exactly tell his strength level but didn't even panic. The Blood Prisoner suddenly felt something peculiar with Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>But the Blood Prisoner could not tell what it was. The gap in terms of strength between a nature creature and an Illuminating Soul Realm practitioner was huge. Although the Blood Prisoner hadn't completely recovered, he was much stronger than the creatures at the same level since he was practicing the ways of killing skills. Normally, a nature creature would be intimidated to even look at him.</p>

  <p>But since when could a nature creature look down at an Illuminating Soul Realm practitioner?</p>

  <p>However, the Blood Prisoner knew very little about Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>In the Cloud Sect, there were all kinds of talents with strengths beyond ordinary people's imagination. So, defeating a cultivator at a higher level was not rare inside the Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>Of course, the case where a nature creature, like Luo Luo Zheng, challenged an Illuminating Soul Realm practitioner and actually won was a rare spectacle.</p>

  <p>In the small counties of the Eastern Region, the difference in strength amongst the cultivators was not evident, hence it was impossible for a nature creature to challenge an Illuminating Soul Realm practitioner.</p>

  <p>That was why the Blood Prisoner could not understand Luo Luo Zheng and why the latter didn't even panic upon knowing his strength. 'Is it possible that there is someone stronger behind him?' the blood Prisoner wondered.</p>

  <p>His strength could be amongst the top in the faraway counties of the Eastern Region, but compared to the disciples of the Cloud Sect, he was amongst the ordinary.</p>

  <p>The Blood Prisoner wasn't as strong as Dick from the Blackrock Peak even when he was in his best psyche. Not to mention that he had suffered damages already.</p>

  <p>For Luo Luo Zheng, defeating the Blood Prisoner was a piece of cake.</p>

  <p>"You're such a fool! Let's see if you can keep up with your arrogance once I chomp on you!"</p>

  <p>Just after the Blood Prisoner finished his remark, some string-like blood came out from the bare part of his body.</p>

  <p>The scene was dreadful as if the Blood Prisoner pressed his own blood out by force. The blood strings blew directly toward Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was still holding Bryson by the latter's collar. He said coldly to Bryson,"I thought you were as cruel as a beast. But now I can see that you are eviler than a beast! How could you learn evil method from such a devil? I can tell you, Bryson, you are not only evil but also more foolish than a beast!"</p>

  <p>Bryson felt Luo Zheng's hands seized him tightly. He had no other hope but for the Blood Prisoner to kill Luo Luo Zheng and save him. 'If the Blood Prisoner fails, I will surely be dead!' Bryson thought in his mind.</p>

  <p>Being seized by Luo Luo Zheng, Bryson had lost much energy and he felt as weak as an old dog. But despite that, he still didn't want to give up hope.</p>

  <p>In his eyes, if the Blood Prisoner was willing to act then he had nothing to worry about.</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng would be killed, then Bryson could still be the master of the Luo Clan.</p>

  <p>"You will end up being eaten by the Blood Prisoner! There's no way you can escape that!" Bryson laughed crazily. Bryson seemed to be mad although was almost out of breath.</p>

  <p>"Is that so?" Luo Luo Zheng said calmly. He had totally ignored the blood strings and went on talking to Bryson,"I will let you live to see how weak this man you're counting on is..."</p>

  <p>After finishing his remarks, Luo Luo Zheng pulled Bryson away and walked towards the blood strings.</p>

  <p>The Blood Prisoner was determined to defeat Luo Luo Zheng in an instant. But after he heard Luo Zheng's remarks, his eyes turned crueler. He said coldly,"How can a nature creature be arrogant in front of me? People look up at you like you're a rare gem. I hope you will never regret it!"</p>

  <p>"Regret what?" Luo Luo Zheng shook his head.</p>

  <p>He didn't try to avoid the blood strings, instead, he offered his hand and allowed the blood strings to wrap around his hand.</p>

  <p>Seeing how the events unfold, the members of the Luo Clan felt nervous but surprised at the same time.</p>

  <p>In their eyes, it was expected for Luo Luo Zheng to defeat Bryson since the first had entered the Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>But defeating the Blood Prisoner was a different story. Even if Luo Luo Zheng was the strongest amongst the Cloud Sect, the Blood Prisoner was still an Illuminating Soul Realm practitioner.</p>

  <p>Even if the Blood Prisoner was only at the beginning level of the Illuminating Soul Realm, he was as strong as a warrior god in C County.</p>

  <p>A nature creature could make huge achievements inside C County, so what more could an Illuminating Soul Realm master do?</p>

  <p>Why did Luo Luo Zheng allow the blood strings to wrap around his hand? Why didn't he fight back? Wasn't he afraid of being captured by the Blood Prisoner?</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng told them that he was confident to defeat the Blood Prisoner and that letting the blood strings wrap around his hand was on purpose, they wouldn't believe it. They were confused as to why Luo Luo Zheng was so calm and didn't even avoid being captured by the blood strings at all.</p>
