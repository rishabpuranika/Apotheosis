<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>According to the rules, as explained by the middle-aged warrior, tasks in the first phase created for competitors, were only to guard their small pagodas.</p>

  <p>However, there was nothing in the rules that said they could not encroach on the territory of their competitors.</p>

  <p>So, Luo Zheng crossed over to a territory nearby and killed crow zombies there, an act that exasperated the warrior guarding the area.</p>

  <p>Angry, this warrior was not an easy man to handle. He wielded his huge saber and chased after Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng refused to be cut down by him! He moved as swift as a fish swimming in the water as he faced danger.</p>

  <p>"Let's see how far you can go!" the warrior muttered. He pursued Luo Zheng until they reached a large cloud of corpse poison. The furious warrior believed that Luo Zheng would suffer a terrible fate the moment he encountered the corpse poison.</p>

  <p>But to his utter shock, the bold fighter broke into the toxic fog without hesitation and went through it unharmed, then continued his killing spree of crow zombies.</p>

  <p>"What the hell?" the warrior cried out as he witnessed what Luo Zheng had done.</p>

  <p>"Is this guy not afraid of corpse poison?" he said to himself.</p>

  <p>Nothing distracted Luo Zheng from his goal and he continued killing crow zombies. He paid even less attention to the warrior.</p>

  <p>The warrior was at his wit's end. Even if he caught up with Luo Zheng, there was still nothing he could do to stop him. As long as the fighter hid within the toxic fog, all he could do was stand by.</p>

  <p>Just as he was busy annihilating crow zombies, Luo Zheng suddenly sensed another form of danger. He heard twanging sounds and saw three sharp arrows shot across the sky towards him.</p>

  <p>He quickly realized these weapons came from the warrior's pagoda!</p>

  <p>Adroitly, he dodged the arrows easily.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the competition was only at the fourth attack stage. So, the warriors could only upgrade their pagodas up to three times. Although the arrows shot by bowmen from the pagoda were sharp, they were not a threat to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The warrior who was annoyed with Luo Zheng took a deep breath. 'Forget it! I'd better get on with my business, ' he thought.</p>

  <p>The man was resigned to the fact that he couldn't stop Luo Zheng from killing the crow zombies. As he pondered this, Luo Zheng went on with his killing spree.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the warrior decided to accept his bad luck of encountering someone as strange as Luo Zheng. At the same time, he resolved to start killing as many crow zombies as possible to earn points rather than let Luo Zheng kill them all.</p>

  <p>It was much faster for two people to kill the crow zombies together. The place was cleansed of the zombies not long after.</p>

  <p>As he looked at the crow zombies flying towards the pagoda, Luo Zheng smiled at the warrior and said, "Those are for you!"</p>

  <p>The words stirred something inside the warrior. He suddenly wanted to cry but could not afford to shed tears! What else could he do besides curse Luo Zheng?</p>

  <p>He only had himself to blame for not being strong enough, or even fast enough. 'This wouldn't have happened if I had killed all the crow zombies before that bastard invaded my territory.</p>

  <p>But wait! How could he have been so fast? What is his cultivation base?</p>

  <p>The Illuminating Soul Realm? And he is at the third level?' he thought.</p>

  <p>As the warrior rubbed his eyes, he wondered if he had misjudged Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>'He's only at the third level of Illuminating Soul Realm, yet he's much faster than me. How can that be? And when I chased him unexpectedly just now, I couldn't catch up with him.</p>

  <p>My cultivation base is at the Internal Elixir Realm. How could this be?' he thought.</p>

  <p>After taking note of Zheng's cultivation base, the warrior suddenly felt as if he'd suffered a great blow and lost not only his strength but also his confidence. Fortunately, the bowmen from his pagoda shot the rest of the crow zombies.</p>

  <p>After returning to his territory, Luo Zheng checked the points he had accumulated.</p>

  <p>Usually, he would earn 10, 000 points for killing his flock of crow zombies.</p>

  <p>But now, his pagoda said he had 16, 000 points. That meant Luo Zheng killed at least sixty percent of the crow zombies of the neighboring territory.</p>

  <p>There was no hesitation to put all the points into the pagoda again so that his pagoda started on its fourth upgrade.</p>

  <p>The transformation of the pagoda happened when the red light disappeared.</p>

  <p>The pagoda was now thicker and several feet taller. There were four archers stationed at the top level of the pagoda, with their equipment upgraded. The color of longbows was now emerald, while the arrows glowed a dark green.</p>

  <p>The points earned from killing the crow zombies from Zheng's territory were sufficient to cover the cost of the fourth upgrade. Now he still had more than 6, 000 points left, acquired from destroying the crow zombies from the neighboring territory. As he pondered about this, Zheng's eyes glowed. He thought the strategy was an excellent way to earn points.</p>

  <p>Careful planning was necessary for the ten rounds of attacks at the first phase of the magic array test. Each upgrade of the pagoda was to cope with the succeeding attacks from more furious beasts. For example, the first upgrade was to ward off the second wave of beasts, while the second upgrade was intended to fight off the third wave of the beasts. It not only helped warriors fight better, but it also restrained the power of the pagoda to allow the warriors to exert their actual strength.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng gained more points from the territory of other warriors, he could quickly upgrade his pagoda. And if he earned enough points, he could even upgrade his pagoda a fifth time to resist another level of attack.</p>

  <p>"I should get as many points as possible from the territory of other warriors," Luo Zheng mumbled.</p>

  <p>The sound of a tolling bell from the sky sounded again, indicating the fifth attack had begun.</p>

  <p>At the same time, many black stone men appeared all over the grassland. It signaled the attack of the fifth wave of demon beasts in the magic array.</p>

  <p>The stone men, made of black basalt, were called basaltic men. They were mightier than the black turtles.</p>

  <p>"Lily!" Luo Zheng summoned his sword spirit.</p>

  <p>He came up with a bold idea to let Lily handle the basaltic men while he went to steal from the other warrior's territory.</p>
