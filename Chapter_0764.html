<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As the tip of Zheng's brush continued to extend its magical line, an intense and mysterious mist started forming in the hall, full of hallucinogens and a captivating song.</p>

  <p>The first ones to be bewitched by the illusion were Felix's assistants, then Felix himself and the stewards, followed by the group led by Emanuel.</p>

  <p>There were numerous elders, sect leaders, and clan leaders among this group of people. Quite a number of them were at the late stage of the Internal Elixir Realm, and a small number had even reached the early stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm. But they couldn't resist the illusion produced by the divine texture.</p>

  <p>When the first line was finished, Luo Zheng glanced at them briefly. He was also secretly taken aback by the countless ugly expressions on their faces.</p>

  <p>The five-star divine texture was actually so powerful! He hadn't fully activated it, but the Mu Ning released by it had the power to confuse warriors even at the Virtual Tribulation Realm. If these three divine textures were combined with the 4, 900 three-star and four-star divine textures, their power would be beyond Zheng's imagination.</p>

  <p>Just thinking about it caused Zheng's heart to palpitate with excitement, and the brush in his hand wavered slightly.</p>

  <p>"Be careful," warned the cyan dragon, who had currently focused all of his attention on using his soul force. Drawing a divine texture required one's full attention. The slightest distraction could destroy the entire process and he would have to start over.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Luo Zheng was able to bring back his concentration in time, and the brush's tip immediately stabilized. Then he began to draw the last divine texture wholeheartedly.</p>

  <p>When the upper half of the "Mad Trap" was drawn, it was still blooming with a pink and purple mist. The brushstrokes were also soft, and the whole Mu Ning was filled with a sense of extreme temptation.</p>

  <p>However, when he reached the bottom half of the divine texture, Zheng's brushstrokes turned suddenly and a surging killing intent immediately blossomed on the paper. A dark fog rose up and filled the room. It felt like there was a cavalry trampling through the black fog. The killing intent enveloped the entire hall within moments.</p>

  <p>Under this intense killing intent, Zheng's brushstrokes became firm and powerful. Each brushstroke felt like a dragon or a phoenix was dancing on the paper.</p>

  <p>"Aargh!"</p>

  <p>Plop!</p>

  <p>One of the stewards, who was still in a daze, was suddenly covered by the killing intent and with a roll of his eyes, he fainted.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked coldly at the group of people not far away from him. These people really were troublesome and Ning Yudie had probably suffered a lot in the past few days because of them. He decided to teach them a lesson. The next moment, Zheng's brushstrokes became even more forceful and energetic due to his desire for revenge.</p>

  <p>Under the urging of the cyan dragon's soul force, the illusions created by the menacing killing intent caused the faces of the elders, sect leaders, and clan leaders to go ghastly pale. Cold sweat dripped down their faces as they faced their worst nightmares.</p>

  <p>In theory, Luo Zheng was borrowing the power of the cyan dragon's soul to suppress everyone with the divine texture.</p>

  <p>From this, one could fathom just how powerful the cyan dragon's soul force was! Before he had devoured the Owl Beast, the cyan dragon's soul force was already far beyond Zheng's imagination. After feasting on the Owl Beast, it had increased several folds and was too much for words.</p>

  <p>The stewards and assistants were in the most difficult situation. They were the weakest warriors among these people, and their soul forces were also very weak. How could they resist it?</p>

  <p>Plop, plop...</p>

  <p>People continued to fall to the floor one after another.</p>

  <p>Although Felix was only at the Internal Elixir Realm, because of his status as a runic expert, his soul was far stronger than other warriors of the same level. Although he couldn't completely resist the divine texture, he didn't faint and managed to remain upright.</p>

  <p>"Seal!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's final brushstroke was drawn like a huge blade that viciously slashed down. The five-star divine texture was finally complete.</p>

  <p>All the smoke in the hall instantly disappeared, as if the clouds had cleared and the sun had appeared in full now.</p>

  <p>The elders, sect leaders, and clan leaders were now able to finally break away from the illusions. They panted heavily, fear visible in their eyes as they gazed at Luo Zheng. They were a group of warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm, but they feared Luo Zheng now, who was two whole realms lower than them.</p>

  <p>Even Emanuel's face was a deathly shade of pale, and his gaze on Luo Zheng was cold and complicated.</p>

  <p>How could a brat at the Illuminating Soul Realm do this? What kind of background did he have? Where had he picked up these things? Emanuel realized that he had underestimated Luo Zheng. He hadn't personally attended the Martial Arts Contest, but even if the rumors he had heard were true, he felt that Luo Zheng was only a mediocre warrior at best. He had firmly believed that Luo Zheng had only survived Eddie's attack out of luck.</p>

  <p>In his eyes, Luo Zheng had been lucky that time, but that didn't mean he would be lucky forever. But now, Emanuel realized that he had been wrong, and it was not luck that had allowed Luo Zheng to be alive up till this point. If Luo Zheng was given time to grow, then who knew what kind of person he would become in the future?</p>

  <p>'I have to find an opportunity to get rid of him!' Emanuel thought as his killing intent had long cemented itself deep down.</p>

  <p>When he had first encountered Luo Zheng outside the Cloud Road, Emanuel had had the same thought in his mind. However, since Luo Zheng was in the Cloud Hall most of the time and had disappeared the moment he left, Emanuel hadn't gotten the opportunity.</p>

  <p>Felix took out a few elixirs and stuffed them into the mouths of the assistants and stewards, waking them up one by one.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng placed his brush aside and walked towards the elders, sect leaders, and clan leaders, asking coolly, "Now! May I ask why you have come here?"</p>

  <p>"We... Never mind." Perhaps it was because of the illusion just now, but an elder had actually lost his confidence completely.</p>

  <p>But Emanuel laughed coldly and replied, "We're here for you, of course.</p>

  <p>You angered Eddie and brought a huge disaster to the Cloud Hall even though you are a disciple. If you are sensible enough, then walk out of the Cloud Hall right now, and face Eddie's anger. This has nothing to do with the Cloud Hall."</p>

  <p>"Really? So that is your opinion? I should leave? What if I don't?" Luo Zheng asked indifferently.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha." Emanuel laughed with a dangerous glint in his eyes. "You're just a lowly warrior at the Illuminating Soul Realm and a disciple of the Elite House. Letting you talk to us face to face should already be a tremendous honor for you. Do you even have the qualifications to say no?"</p>

  <p>Emanuel was one of the most outstanding elders of the Cloud Hall and his position was much higher than Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>If it had been a few years ago, Emanuel's words would have suited the situation. He had the right to decide the life and death of a disciple of the Elite House.</p>

  <p>However, today, Luo Zheng merely laughed and taunted, "You call it an honor? I don't need it. Please leave!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng knew that these people were just putting on an act. They were afraid of Ning Yudie and Imogen. If it weren't for the two, they would have thrown him out of the Cloud Hall already instead of wasting their breaths trying to convince him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was really in no mood to bicker with them.</p>

  <p>"You�" Being treated like this by a disciple at the Illuminating Soul Realm, Emanuel, a warrior at the middle stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm, was immediately enraged. He raised his right hand and was about to attack Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng didn't even bat an eyelid as he turned around to tidy up the divine textures. He had already drawn all the required divine textures, but his work wasn't over. The divine textures would have to be arranged in various places in specific order inside the Cloud Hall in accordance to the previous design so that they could resonate with each other and achieve their desired effect.</p>

  <p>This was a huge task.</p>

  <p>Emanuel did not dare to make a move on Luo Zheng; he knew very clearly that Ning Yudie cared for Luo Zheng very much. It was easy to kill Luo Zheng, but the problem was, how could he bear Yudie's anger? Therefore, even if Emanuel wanted to kill Luo Zheng, he would do so without anyone else knowing. Unfortunately, his raised right hand made him look a bit awkward, so he could only dejectedly put it down.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stacked the divine textures according to their types.</p>

  <p>As he was tidying up the mess, he glanced at the elders. They were unwilling to leave, but had to do so. To be frank, Luo Zheng understood their feelings. Humans were creatures who sought profit and avoided harm. Who would be willing to be involved in a great disaster by a disciple?</p>

  <p>"Elders, you have just experienced the power of this five-star rune," Luo Zheng remarked as he stacked a pile of divine textures together. "The 4, 903 runes are interdependent. Even if the sect-protecting array is unable to kill Eddie, it is still possible to block him from the outside."</p>

  <p>"How confident are you?" These elders were not willing to hand over the fate of the Cloud Hall to Luo Zheng. For a fourth-grade sect to place its fate in the hands of a kid at the Illuminating Soul Realm was a hilarious matter already.</p>

  <p>However, after having experienced the might of Zheng's five-star rune, some of the elders had slightly wavered. If just a five-star rune was able to confound them completely, just how powerful would this sect-protective array be?</p>

  <p>If the sect-protecting array could really block Eddie, then it could completely become the Cloud Hall's treasure, and maybe, even the best treasure of the sect. It was probably ten times stronger than the sect-protecting array produced by Arnold of the Ethereal Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng lifted his head, his gaze calm as he replied in a firm voice, "Eighty percent sure."</p>
