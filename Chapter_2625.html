  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Wild Gods thought that they would definitely die. But out of a sudden, the suction force had immediately disappeared. They all felt as if their lives had been spared, and they quickly retreated.</p>

  <p>A narrow escape from death! For a moment, the Wild Gods had shared the same thought as they felt lucky evading certain life and death situation.</p>

  <p>Emily's voice faintly came through, "We Snake Goddess race take charge of the Torrent Bone Tower. But we are not heartless people who would like to see you die. It's just that the space inside the tower is limited, and it's impossible to save so many people's lives in this world. You... You can hide in Torrent Bone Tower temporarily!"</p>

  <p>The tens of thousands of Wild Gods were already scared to death that all of them were in panic running for their lives.</p>

  <p>Although they would also die outside the bone tower, they could live a few more days outside. It was their instinct to make such a choice.</p>

  <p>However, when they were running for their lives, they suddenly heard Emily's words. All the figures that were running suddenly halted and their faces were filled with disbelief.</p>

  <p>Looks of hesitation and doubt had gradually showed on each one's faces.</p>

  <p>"Is she lying to us?"</p>

  <p>"Don't be fooled by her. She is lying. When we come back, she's gonna kill us!"</p>

  <p>"Humph, she has killed almost ten million people in a short time. If she really wants to kill us, it won't take too much efforts for her. You are not qualified to make her fool us..."</p>

  <p>The people discussed and came upon an agreement with the idea.</p>

  <p>If it weren't for the exile of the Snake Goddess race who had stopped, the remaining twenty thousand or thirty thousand people might have already been killed. There was no need for such a powerful master to cheat on them.</p>

  <p>Their faces gradually appeared overjoyed in ecstasy realizing this.</p>

  <p>It was beyond their expectation that they would be invited by the Snake Goddess race to temporarily take shelter inside the bone tower.</p>

  <p>Among ten million warriors, twenty or thirty thousand people entered the Torrent Bone Tower. They were very lucky.</p>

  <p>But unbeknownst the crowd, two people quietly exchanged glances.</p>

  <p>These two men were the assassins arranged by Spark.</p>

  <p>As Spark had ordered, they hid and blended among the last group of Wild Gods.</p>

  <p>The situation moments ago had made them feel desperate. They were unable to break free from the circle of light, and in the end, they would be both shattered into pieces like the others.</p>

  <p>The two assassins had dared sneak into the Torrent Bone Tower and were given the mission to assassinate Zelda and Luther. Spark in return had promised them that their family would be ensured to be given a good life. As assassins, they were naturally prepared to sacrifice themselves.</p>

  <p>But this time, their sacrifice would be deemed unworthy if they died before they could even enter the Torrent Bone Tower.</p>

  <p>To their surprise, Spark truly had superb foresight as Emily really stopped!</p>

  <p>"Master Emily, are you really going to let them in?" An old lady had a look of deep worry on her face as she asked.</p>

  <p>"You have a gentle heart, master. But you really don't have to care about these pariahs, to avoid any unnecessary troubles in the future." another elder advised.</p>

  <p>Emily smiled faintly. "It's enough. There's no need to kill everyone. It won't be a big problem even if I let these Wild Gods enter the Torrent Bone Tower. You just need to strengthen the security. Just don't let these people walk around in the bone tower casually."</p>

  <p>She had just killed almost ten million people, but now she was praised as 'having a gentle heart'. This was the reason why she spared the lives of the remaining twenty or thirty thousand people.</p>

  <p>Being too cruel and bloodthirsty didn't seem to be appropriate for the leader of the Snake Goddess race.</p>

  <p>Under the gaze of the Snake Goddess members, more than twenty thousand Wild Gods entered the bone tower in order.</p>

  <p>The two assassins sent by Spark were both included mixed up with the Wild Gods.</p>

  <p>A separate area in the bone tower had been arranged and prepared for the Wild Gods to temporarily stay for the meantime.</p>

  <p>The two assassins had been discreetly observing the interior of the Torrent Bone Tower as they followed the crowd.</p>

  <p>A group of Snake Goddess members stood on the high platform. They were held responsible for monitoring the Wild Gods.</p>

  <p>After everyone had entered, an elder of the Snake Goddess race floated above and coldly announced, "You guys must have known your current situation very well. It's your great honor that our Torrent Bone Tower is willing to accept you. I hope you can live through this period of time in peace until the Light of Adjudication is over. Anyone who dares to have unusual movements will be killed!"</p>

  <p>The Wild Gods were silent as they listened to the words of the elder.</p>

  <p>How could they dare do anything else? They had already been lucky to keep their lives and much more had been provided a shelter. They were already satisfied. Everyone sat and listened in peace without objections.</p>

  <p>With everything that needed to be announced and reminded were said, the elder of the Snake Goddess race left. The two assassins were in deep thought as they looked at each other.</p>

  <p>When Spark gave them the task, they were both confused.</p>

  <p>Even if they managed to sneak into the bone tower, it would be difficult finding the right timing and opportunity to kill Zelda and Luther. It was almost impossible to kill them under the watchful eyes of the exiles.</p>

  <p>Despite how difficult it was, they must execute the task given to them as soon as they spotted even a tiny chance to take action. They could only do as what Spark had ordered!</p>

  <p>After an hour had passed, one of the assassins suddenly made a gesture.</p>

  <p>His fellow assassin nodded with an expression showing that they were ready and would risk everything to accomplish their task.</p>

  <p>"Go!"</p>

  <p>The first assassin suddenly cried out and activated his Wild God Power.</p>

  <p>He transformed into the size of twenty thousand feet tall and rushed towards the depth of the cave!</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>Several Snake Goddess members' faces darkened. They quickly activated the Wild God Power and chased after the first assassin.</p>

  <p>The first assassin attracted most of the people's attention, and the second assassin just silently followed.</p>

  <p>The latter suddenly burst forth with an astonishing speed and rushed to another direction. In front of the assassin's forehead gathered a mass of black aura.</p>

  <p>The black aura was given to him by the Warden race. Through this black aura, he could detect the location of both Luther and Zelda.</p>

  <p>He could sense that Luther and Zelda were not far from where he was. It was only dozens of miles away. As long as they were killed, everything would be over!</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the second assassin had already rushed over a dozen miles.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, dozens of miles away, a figure was seated on a cyan stone platform and attentively cultivating.</p>

  <p>It was Luther. He had already successfully reached the mid-rank True God Realm in such a short period of time. As days passed by, he had surely made fast progress.</p>

  <p>All this should be attributed to Emily.</p>

  <p>"Hoo, hoo, hoo..."</p>

  <p>His concentration was suddenly interrupted by a deafening whistling sound of wind. Just at the right time, he sensed and saw a Wild God rushing towards him from afar!</p>

  <p>"The bloodline mark?" The sudden intrusion made him alert as his eyebrows jumped up.</p>

  <p>Because of the black aura on his forehead, which was also the bloodline mark that Luther had referred to, the assassin could now clearly detect Luther's existence. Luther on the other hand, could as well sense the black aura being emitted from the figure coming straight towards him.</p>

  <p>In an instant, he realized that the Wild God was coming at him for an attack!</p>

  <p>The assassin's speed was extremely fast. Even if the other Snake Goddess members realized what was happening, it was already too late to stop him.</p>

  <p>Just as the assassin was about a few miles away from Luther, a rainbow like light flashed out and shot towards him.</p>

  <p>Facing a sudden attack, the assassin's huge body had no time to dodge since he had been keeping a high-speed in running. Having no time to analyze what had happened, his body was already split into half.</p>

  <p>Emily's figure quietly appeared in front of Luther. She frowned and looked at the assassin.</p>

  <p>"That's nothing impressive!"</p>

  <p>Although she knew that Spark would play tricks, she had the feeling that it was not so simple...</p>
