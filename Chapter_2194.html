<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2194 A Top-rank True God (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>In their eyes, this proving godly warrior was like a tender shoot that had just emerged from the ground. Luo Zheng was a little too strong for his own good, though. If he were to condense a Godly Tile in his inner world in the future, wouldn't he naturally become a disciple of the Holy Emperor?</p>

  <p>"Not necessarily, you don't have to. In the past, the sub-branches of the Han Clan have always been one and the same! How could we let you bear all the responsibility alone?" Luke Han said.</p>

  <p>"Yeah... Why don't we ask Tianxing about it later? Maybe it's not as we're imagining it to be," Declan Han was next to speak.</p>

  <p>Both Luke Han and Declan Han offered their words with a slight awkwardness.</p>

  <p>It was at that moment that someone was heard uttering just outside the main hall, "Tianxing Luo has arrived!"</p>

  <p>Malloy nodded in response and said, "Let him in."</p>

  <p>It was only a few short moments later that Luo Zheng slowly walked inside.</p>

  <p>Malloy's lips curled into a smile and he said politely, "Tianxing, please sit here."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded his head and sat down in the chair, a little off to the side. At the same time, he asked, "May I know why you've summoned me here?"</p>

  <p>In total honesty, Luo Zheng had a rough idea of that reason. Seeing as he had already spoken of where he came from to the Han Clan, they had definitely summoned him in order to investigate his background.</p>

  <p>Prior to leaving the Misty Mountain Village, Luo Zheng had told the villagers to keep his identity a secret from all the others. However, most of the divine citizens of the Misty Mountain Village had never been to a divine city. It was thus impossible for them to hide it from the members of the Heavenly Han House.</p>

  <p>Today, it was highly likely that Malloy had personally invited him here just to investigate him in depth.</p>

  <p>Despite that, Luo Zheng was feeling confident and had already made up his mind. He wasn't the slightest bit flustered and instead asked Malloy first, before he had even had the chance to speak.</p>

  <p>Malloy was caught off guard as Luo Zheng questioned him like that and a trace of unnatural emotion immediately appeared on his face. The expression disappeared in a flash before he chuckled. "To be honest, all of the disciples that we recruit are treated like family. But according to the rules that have been passed down from our ancestors for generations and generations, we need to investigate into all disciples' backgrounds."</p>

  <p>Of course, Luo Zheng understood that it was just as he had guessed. The members of the Heavenly Han House had really travelled to the Misty Mountain Village and had already discovered that something was wrong...</p>

  <p>"From what we've learned from the Misty Mountain Village, it seems that something doesn't match up just right what you've told us," Malloy continued.</p>

  <p>Declan Han and Luke Han also looked straight at Luo Zheng, as if they wanted to decipher something from his expression, or pick up on some kind of clue.</p>

  <p>"You're right. I am indeed not from the Misty Mountain Village." No one had expected Luo Zheng to admit it so openly, and with a faint smile on his face. His honest words made the three True Gods feel an odd mix of discomfort and surprise.</p>

  <p>Malloy continued calmly and asked, "Then where exactly are you from?"</p>

  <p>It didn't really matter where Luo Zheng genuinely came from. What was important was that they needed a credible background. They needed to know he would not do harm to the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng just shook his head. "I can't say," he replied.</p>

  <p>Of course, there was no way he'd admit that he was Mike's son from the Evolutionary Universe just to enter the Heavenly Han House. On the other hand though, he also couldn't make up a false identity for himself.</p>

  <p>After all, with the Han Clan members' abilities, they would surely check and figure out his lies with ease. Therefore, he had no other choice but to answer honestly.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Declan Han coldly and promptly said, "We don't accept warriors of unknown origins."</p>

  <p>Luke Han agreed with a single nod of his head. "Indeed. I hope you'd cherish this opportunity."</p>

  <p>There was a hint of threat in their words, which was to warn Luo Zheng that if he didn't tell them where he came from, he would probably be expelled from the Heavenly Han House immediately.</p>

  <p>"If that's really the case, then that's quite a pity. I'm afraid I can only choose to leave the Heavenly Han House," Luo Zheng said with a look of regret on his face. Joining the Heavenly Han House was only a shortcut to get to the Floating Island. If he couldn't take the shortcut successfully, he would find himself another way.</p>

  <p>If he were to reveal his identity though, now that would be quite a serious matter. It was impossible for him to reveal his identity just to enter the Heavenly Han House.</p>

  <p>As the words left his mouth, Luke Han and Declan Han kept silent. They had wanted to threaten Luo Zheng with the qualification to join the Heavenly Han House, but Luo Zheng didn't seem to care in the least.</p>

  <p>Malloy glanced at Luke Han and Declan Han indifferently, and shrugged his shoulders. He knew that Luo Zheng wasn't an idiot, and since he possessed such great talent, every proving godly house would be eager to admit him. Did he even care about the qualification to join the Heavenly Han House? Malloy continued wondering to himself.</p>

  <p>Just as Malloy was thinking about how to continue his attempt in persuading Luo Zheng, a figure appeared in the sky above the Heavenly Han House, slowly descending into its main hall.</p>

  <p>"This warrior can actually fly within the divine land..."</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes suddenly flashed with astonishment, realizing that the warrior was a top-rank True God. But who was he? And why did he come here?</p>
