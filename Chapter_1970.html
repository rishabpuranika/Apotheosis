  <p>
</p>

  <p>The people in the universe didn't know much about the Heavenly Destiny that Master Feng carried as he had never released all of the Lotus Flower's power in one go before.</p>

  <p>Judging from the scene in front of them though, it was quite obvious that it contained an incredible power.</p>

  <p>Under the pressure of the Lotus Flower, Luo Zheng's body was sinking rapidly.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng didn't seem to notice as he remained standing calmly. All the strength he had was activated and, like a raging sea, it coursed through every meridian in his body.</p>

  <p>All nine stars in his inner world began to spin faster and faster, its strength source turning into threads and flowing into Luo Zheng's meridians.</p>

  <p>With the help of Holy Drew, Luo Luo Zheng had refined his body, causing his strength to increase tremendously. However, even with his current strength, the nine stars' strength source was still too much for him.</p>

  <p>At this stage, thirty percent was all he could take. Any more than that and his body would collapse.</p>

  <p>In order to resist the pressure that was steadily descending on him, Luo Luo Zheng extracted more of the strength source, making the stars spin even faster.</p>

  <p>Ten percent?</p>

  <p>Twenty percent?</p>

  <p>Because the strength had rushed quickly into his body, Luo Zheng's bones pressed into each other and began to make squeaky sounds. And as the pressure gradually increased, the sounds also turned more violent and were now comparable to that of two mountains sliding against each other. His body, although battered, was strong as steel and iron, its toughness surpassing that of a supreme divine weapon.</p>

  <p>After what seemed like a lifetime, the Lotus Flower finally halted its descent.</p>

  <p>"He really managed to hold it..." Supreme Lord Mirage whispered in disbelief and astonishment.</p>

  <p>"What kind of power does this kid possess? This is the technique of a Holy Being! No one below the level of a True God should be able to take it!" Supreme Lord Sky was also amazed.</p>

  <p>Master Feng's eyes gleamed. He pointed two fingers and gently pushed them down.</p>

  <p>Squeak! Squeak!</p>

  <p>The Lotus Flower that Luo Luo Zheng struggled to hold above his head began to press down once again.</p>

  <p>"It's so heavy!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng exclaimed with gritted teeth.</p>

  <p>Master Feng's Heavenly Destiny was truly something else. A lotus flower was actually able to release a weight infinitely heavier than the Collapsing Mountain race's Magic Golden Stone!</p>

  <p>Feeling the massive weight press down on him, Luo Luo Zheng could only draw out more strength source from his inner world.</p>

  <p>"Thirty percent!"</p>

  <p>Thirty percent of strength source of the nine stars was his limit right now.</p>

  <p>When this power gushed out, the meridians in Luo Zheng's body coiled around like earthworms. These pathways were as tough as dragon tendons and as thick as a swollen thumb. The sight was frightening!</p>

  <p>Pop! Pop! Pop!</p>

  <p>His bones creaked and joints popped, and the sounds were similar to the chirps of insects.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's body seemed to have turned into a musical instrument with all the noise it was making.</p>

  <p>"Rise!"</p>

  <p>With a defiant growl, Luo Luo Zheng pushed against the Lotus Flower and lifted it high above his head!</p>

  <p>"Whaaa...?"</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Mirage's mouth fell as did Supreme Lord Sky's.</p>

  <p>They had lived hundreds of millions of years and they'd never seen anything that shocked them as much as this.</p>

  <p>It had been countless years since such an expression had appeared on their faces?</p>

  <p>However, the Supreme Lords around all had this sort of expression.</p>

  <p>And as for Master Feng, he could only watch in amazement as Luo Luo Zheng held the Lotus Flower.</p>

  <p>He noticed Luo Zheng's body was at its limit. And while it looked like his body would crumble any second, Master Feng knew that this wasn't the limit of his strength. The guy still had some left.</p>

  <p>But it wasn't much.</p>

  <p>"Okay, that's it." Master Feng conceded and with a wave of his hand, the Lotus Flower flew out from Luo Zheng's hands. It spun and disappeared into thin air. Master Feng sighed. "Today, I was too stubborn...but Luo Luo Zheng, your performance was outstanding!"</p>

  <p>"You flatter me, Master Feng," Luo Luo Zheng smiled. "I've already reached my limit. I have to thank you for holding back. I would have failed if you hadn't."</p>

  <p>Master Feng raised a brow and chuckled. "You cunning boy, you're not telling the truth. I'm curious of your limit but I know when to stop..."</p>

  <p>To be honest, even Luo Luo Zheng was not able to identify his limit. He did not know how powerful a third of Holy Being's strength was when fully released.</p>

  <p>Moreover, strength aspect was only one aspect of a martial artist's ability.</p>

  <p>If one were to combine their strength with a certain cultivation method, then the effects would greatly differ.</p>

  <p>This sort of limit could only be measured in battle.</p>

  <p>Since Master Feng had finished his test, it was now Supreme Lord Mirage's turn.</p>

  <p>And he was fully prepared.</p>

  <p>What he was to test was the power of Luo Zheng's soul, and there was no special trick for it.</p>

  <p>He slowly floated over to Luo Luo Zheng and met his eyes. Like a lurking beast watching its prey, the Gold Fighting Soul in his body released a strong pressure all of a sudden.</p>

  <p>A martial artist's soul was a very important aspect.</p>

  <p>Strength, life vitality, soul...</p>

  <p>When two martial artists fought, all three aspects were utilized.</p>

  <p>For instance, a warrior might first activate their life vitality to attack their opponent at the beginning of a fight, and when they had the chance, they could use their physical strength to engage in close combat. And if they were still unable to finish off their opponent, they could use their soul attack to break the deadlock.</p>

  <p>However, Supreme Lord Mirage's test only lasted a few seconds. As the majestic soul pressure he released came at Luo Luo Zheng, Luo Zheng's eyes glistened with golden light and he easily resisted Supreme Lord mirage's soul pressure.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The soul pressure vanished without a trace.</p>

  <p>When this happened, Supreme Lord Mirage didn't know whether to laugh or cry. "Luo Luo Zheng, you already have a Gold Fighting Soul?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded. There was no need to deny it, anyway.</p>

  <p>"Then... There's no need to test." Supreme Lord Mirage shrugged. He wasn't as stubborn as Master Feng.</p>

  <p>As for life vitality...</p>

  <p>The Celestial Position already knew about Luo Zheng's background. The cultivation method he practiced was special and far beyond that of the ordinary warriors. There was no need to test it.</p>

  <p>Today's test had finally come to an end.</p>

  <p>The test for Godly Geniuses was actually short. It was just Luo Zheng's performance had been so outstanding that he had caused a commotion.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Sky waved his hands and Ning Yudie and Freya who were at the mountaintop returned to Luo Zheng's side.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Supreme Lord Lester who had remained silent the whole time, spoke up. "Since Luo Luo Zheng already has such strength, I have a proposal."</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Lester had a rather eccentric personality. He was a man of few words so when he spoke, everyone listened attentively.</p>

  <p>"What proposal?" Master Feng asked.</p>

  <p>"Help Luo Luo Zheng carry a Heavenly Destiny!" Supreme Lord Lester glanced at Luo Luo Zheng and said.</p>

  <p>"Heavenly Destiny?" Master Feng was slightly surprised.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Lester nodded as a smile appeared on his face. "Luo Luo Zheng doesn't have a Heavenly Destiny, but his own strength is enough to match a Supreme Lord's. If he were to have a Heavenly Destiny, imagine how strong he'd be."</p>

  <p>This caught several of the Supreme Lords' attention.</p>

  <p>Since the last time the Humanity Alliance confronted the Sacred race and lost three Supreme Lords, the human race had been at a disadvantage.</p>

  <p>World lords weren't of much help to humans in resisting the Sacred race.</p>

  <p>The number of Supreme Lords the human race had was far less than that of the Sacred race. There were 128 Supreme Lords altogether in the Evolutionary Universe, and human race had around 50 but the only promising ones they had were Master Feng, Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment, Supreme Lord of Oracle, and Supreme Lord of Original Sin, which were all top-rank human Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>But, the number of Heavenly Destinies in the Murphy Universe was far greater than the number in the Evolutionary Universe. Furthermore, all of the Supreme Lords in the Murphy Universe belonged to the Sacred race which meant that they still had an overwhelming advantage over the human race.</p>

  <p>The only human beings that could possibly match up to the Sacred race were the four Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng carried a Heavenly Destiny and became a Supreme Lord, he would be a great help to the human race.</p>

  <p>"No way!"</p>

  <p>Master Feng immediately rejected.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Lester's face turned serious. "Why?"</p>

  <p>    </p>

  <p>  </p>
