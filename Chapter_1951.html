<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1951 Noticed Luo Zheng </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Beside the blood pool was a passageway several dozen miles wide. The entire passageway was densely packed with several million mortals.</p>

  <p>Because the line was too long, the people at the back couldn't see what was happening and could only follow behind others. When the mortals in the front saw the pool of blood, there was already no way back.</p>

  <p>The mortals were screaming, struggling, but there was some sort of force heaving them forward. Even if they fell to the ground, their bodies would automatically make their way towards the blood pool.</p>

  <p>Disguised in the crowd, Luo Zheng carefully observed what had happened.</p>

  <p>Above the blood pool, there was a massive array of divine textures. The number of divine textures could add up to over a hundred thousand at his approximation.</p>

  <p>"This is so intriguing, so complex," Luo Zheng said in astonishment.</p>

  <p>The Sacred race's Blood Curse Technique could be specially tailored to a certain race, and it was also extremely powerful. It notably had its own unique yet identifiable characteristics.</p>

  <p>However, the more complex the array, the more intricate the details were.</p>

  <p>Once it was destroyed, it would be almost impossible to repair. The Sacred race had spent a great deal of effort in putting this up.</p>

  <p>Using the Blood Curse Technique to occupy a supreme world meant that the Sacred race appealed to their last, most desperate option.</p>

  <p>Presently, the Demon Night race and the ogre race were in conflict, while the Sacred race and the three major powers of the human race were in on and off battles. If the Sacred race didn't consolidate these supreme worlds they had occupied, it would be a challenge for them to progress.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the Sacred race's strategy was to consolidate the supreme worlds one by one, and then continue to advance towards the Thoughtless Minds.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng followed the group. As he stood 300 feet away from the blood pool, he felt a force tugging on his body. It was urging him towards the blood pool, just like everyone else.</p>

  <p>The surrounding mortals had already realized the danger they were in.</p>

  <p>Although they knew it was impossible for them to escape the force, they still struggled as much as they could, attempting to pull themselves as far away from the pool as possible.</p>

  <p>However, no matter how much they fought it, the force was relentless.</p>

  <p>Mortals were too weak, too helpless to break free from the force. All they could do was accept their fate as they inevitably slid into the blood pool, watching as their companions were twisted into pretzels with blood showering all over the place.</p>

  <p>In order to avoid suspicion among the Sacred martial artists, Luo Zheng was constantly wriggling his body to resist the invisible force. As he struggled, Luo Zheng slowly glided down the path towards the blood pool.</p>

  <p>Shortly after, Luo Zheng found himself at the edge of the blood pool. His gaze was fixated on the Blood Curse Array.</p>

  <p>Apparently, this Blood Curse Array did not only serve as an array. In addition to being able to extract blood, it could also guide malicious Mu Ning and transform the curse. After mortals died in indignation, they would leave behind a strong curse at the last moment of their lives. The array would then blend the power of curse with their blood, and spread it out.</p>

  <p>Because the array obtained human blood, the curse only affected the human race and had no effect on other races.</p>

  <p>After scanning his surroundings once again, Luo Zheng discovered that there were several powerful defensive divine textures on the array. He reckoned that there were attempts to destroy the array, so the Sacred race had no other choice but to put up defensive divine textures.</p>

  <p>The Sacred race made sure that there was a world lord to guard each of the four blood pools of the Ultimate Immortal City. Beside the blood pool in the south of the city, there was a woman from the Sacred race standing there, immaculate and graceful. The women of Sacred race usually had plump figures, and even when they rolled their eyes, they were exceedingly fascinating. Across their faces, there were three birthmarks on their cheeks shaped like wolf teeth. All Sacred women had this the moment they were born.</p>

  <p>They believed that the longer the wolf teeth were across their faces, the purer their bloodline was. This also meant higher social statuses which many enjoyed.</p>

  <p>Some women of the Sacred race with shorter wolf teeth birthmarks would use a rouge to shape the wolf teeth birthmark, extending it all the way to the two sides of their noses.</p>

  <p>This Sacred woman had been standing guard here all day. She seemed to be absent-minded and stared blankly across the area. Maybe having stayed here for too long, she was sick of the thick stench of blood.</p>

  <p>She glanced indifferently at the mortals who awaited their doom. As she saw their bodies being twisted into all sorts of ways, she felt an indescribable flinch in her heart.</p>

  <p>There were tens of millions of mortals being slaughtered in every blood pool. Countless of them from the small countries of the Seven Ultimate World were sent here to be ripped to pieces. Here, most of the malicious auras that emitted by them would be absorbed by the Blood Curse Array, but the martial artists guarding the place would more or less be affected by part of the malicious auras.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the woman guarding was affected by these auras, too.</p>

  <p>"Sacred Mind Clearing Formula!"</p>

  <p>The eyes of the woman from the Sacred race suddenly flashed out a sharp, white light as she used the Sacred Mind Clearing Formula to clear her mind.</p>

  <p>As she employed the formula, she felt all the frustration in her heart dissipate. She held a jet-black Dragon Teeth Token in her hand as she said, "Maha, when will you come back? I'm so tired of just being here."</p>

  <p>The Dragon Teeth Token was the tool that the Sacred race used to communicate in long distance.</p>

  <p>When Holy Beings made the rules of the universes they had created, the rules varied among others. In the Evolutionary Universe, the Roaring Tokens could spread the sound to every corner of a universe, but it was to shout to everyone through the Roaring Token. It meant that every living being in the universe could hear the voice at the same time.</p>

  <p>The Sacred race's communication tokens could also transmit the voice message to anywhere, but it could only be transmitted directly to another communication token. This Dragon Teeth Token was made by the horns of rare twin Dragon Teeth Beasts, which were unique in the Murphy Universe. No matter how far apart they were, they were able to communicate with each other through telepathy with their horns.</p>

  <p>Sacred warriors killed the twin Dragon Teeth Beasts and used their dragon horns to make the Dragon Teeth Tokens. The horns worked the same, and could be used to communicate from one horn to another.</p>

  <p>However, such communication tokens were extremely rare in the Murphy Universe.</p>

  <p>A few moments after, a voice came out from the communication token.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha, I'm killing people in the Matchless World. Do you miss me, Connie?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I definitely do," Connie replied in a gentle voice.</p>

  <p>"Which part of me did you miss?" Maha asked, smirking.</p>

  <p>"You're such a tease!" Her face flushed. As she spoke, her gaze inadvertently swept across and saw Luo Zheng standing at the other side of the blood pool.</p>

  <p>"Huh?" Connie was momentarily stunned.</p>

  <p>"What's up, Connie?" Maha asked, concerned with Connie's response.</p>

  <p>Connie didn't take her eyes off Luo Zheng. The longer she looked, the more familiar he seemed. "I think I have seen someone I knew."</p>

  <p>On the Breaking Cloud Mountain, during the confrontation between the Sacred race and the Celestial Position, the Sacred race recorded the faces of all ten Godly Geniuses, including Zheng's appearance. Just now, when she casually swept her gaze over the crowd, Luo Zheng caught Connie's attention.</p>

  <p>She remained confused, and very, very intrigued.</p>

  <p>"Who is it?" asked Maha.</p>

  <p>"It seems to be one of the ten Godly Geniuses you mentioned last time."</p>

  <p>Connie's expression then grew excited. The wolf teeth marks on her face turned bright red, and a faint black light constantly flashed within her pupils.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng hadn't changed his appearance at all. Although his face was covered in mud, she could see what he looked like with a single glance.</p>

  <p>There were so many mortals in this supreme world, and there were always a few familiar faces. Luo Zheng blended in, using a simple concealing technique. Connie's "Colorless Eye" could see through almost all concealment techniques.</p>

  <p>This was why she easily noticed Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"How could this be? The Godly Geniuses have returned?" Maha exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Ever since the confrontation at the Breaking Cloud Mountain, the ten Godly Geniuses disappeared from the Evolutionary Universe. No matter how hard the Sacred race searched, they couldn't trace any of them.</p>

  <p>Murphy, their master and the creator of the Murphy Universe, had given them a mission to eliminate all Godly Geniuses. But they disappeared, and did a good job at keeping hidden.</p>

  <p>The Sacred race had secretly investigated for months, but there were no news regarding the Godly Geniuses. In the end, they came to the conclusion that the Celestial Position had already sent all Godly Geniuses into the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>The Sacred race thought of other methods to find them. They tried to send some of the world lords of the Murphy Universe into the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land to hunt down these Godly Geniuses.</p>

  <p>But when they had put in all their efforts to build the transmission array to the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, the Sacred race found out that they had actually been rejected.</p>

  <p>This meant that they had no way to enter the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, and no way to find the Godly Geniuses.</p>
