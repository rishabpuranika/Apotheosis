<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng saw the black Snow Divine Spear, his eyes quickly narrowed into slits.</p>

  <p>He knew that each Snow Divine Spear was more powerful than the last one, so he guessed that the fourth one could seriously injure, or kill him even.</p>

  <p>However, he couldn't fully stop the Snow Divine Spear--he could only resist it with his body.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A faint tinge of regret flashed across the fat man's face as the Snow Divine Spear flew ahead. "This battle is still too easy. You may die now, anonymous man," he lamented.</p>

  <p>Despite his sad voice, his eyes hid a bit of mirth. He was confident that Luo Luo Zheng would surely die after the black spear was fired.</p>

  <p>At that same moment, Luo Luo Zheng focused and immediately retreated backwards, his hands blocking his chest. His whole body flew and slid across the ice a little too closely.</p>

  <p>But the black Snow Divine Spear was incredibly fast, that it shot towards him in almost a blink of an eye!</p>

  <p>"Eight Smoky Melodies!"</p>

  <p>At Luo Zheng's command, a faint white mist flickered over the surface of his body.</p>

  <p>The Eight Smoky Melodies was an ingenious attack, but its ability to move swiftly had a huge limitation: any opponent who was fast enough could easily break it. After all, Gus had only aimed at the opponents Luo Luo Zheng would face in the universe when he had recommended the cultivation method, but hadn't thought of the current situation.</p>

  <p>Now, Luo Luo Zheng had used the Eight Smoky Melodies--but not to escape from the Snow Divine Spear itself. Rather, the Eight Smoky Melodies pushed him away and weakened the spear's power when it got too close to him.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng didn't have much time left to deal with the Snow Divine Spear since it had appeared. It had only taken a thousandth of a blink of an eye in ordinary people's eyes, and he had already made all his preparations.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The moment the Snow Divine Spear hit his arms, the power in his limbs exploded!</p>

  <p>Even though his bones were as strong as a supreme primordial weapon, his arms had to bear the power of the Snow Divine Spear as well as his own strength. Thus, his arms immediately cracked open at the impact of the two great forces combined.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng paid the price with his arms, but the momentum of the Snow Divine Spear only decreased slightly. Moreover, it attacked his chest in the next moment despite the Redemption Armor acting as a barrier.</p>

  <p>The soft Redemption Armor was indestructible and could even weaken a huge chunk of the Snow Divine Spear's power. However, the spear's violent penetrating force still pierced through it and entered his internal organs.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>There were several audible cracks, and his chest was torn with his ribs broken as well. He could even see his heart beating if he tried to bow his head.</p>

  <p>"Tsk, tsk, tsk. You do deserve to be the man with ten consecutive wins.</p>

  <p>You are still alive!" the fat man exclaimed. He shook his head with a sigh, then continued, "I've made my ranking fall several hundred thousand places down on purpose just to fight you. I must say, it's really worth the trip! I can't believe that you survived my fourth spear. Tell me your name, our Moon Clan likes powerful warriors like you. No matter which clan you're from, we'll do our best to get you. What do you think?"</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Luo Zheng was sprawled on the ground as his chest constantly heaved up and down. Every time his chest compressed his lung, blood spurted out from it. He gasped shakily and asked, "You lowered your own ranking on purpose to come here?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I was originally in the top twenty. Ha-ha!" the fat man shrugged and said.</p>

  <p>"The Moon Clan... What is your clan's ranking?" Luo Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Although his chest was torn apart, he thought about the matter deeply.</p>

  <p>He racked his brain for anything, but he had never heard of this clan.</p>

  <p>However, the fat man just stared at him with eyes as wide as saucers and said, "You really haven't heard of our Moon Clan?! Our clan ranks third in the Floating Islands!"</p>

  <p>No wonder the fat man was speechless at his response.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had only been to the Floating Islands for a short period of time.</p>

  <p>After that, he was whisked off to the Purple Soul Hall and began to fight in the Arena of Legends, all before he could even know more about the Floating Islands. Therefore, he didn't have a complete understanding of the top ten clans.</p>

  <p>Before the new ranking of the Floating Islands came, all the wealthy clans had encouraged their disciples to try their best to earn points. Only three clans weren't interested: the Moon Clan, the Sword Clan, and the Dongfang Clan.</p>

  <p>Though all the clans on the Floating Islands from the fourth-ranked one, the Leng Clan, to the last one had Holy Beings, they were still ordinary wealthy clans in general. In other words, their structure was no different from an ordinary clan. They shared the same clan name and naturally worked under the same roof.</p>

  <p>Yet, things were different in the top three clans.</p>

  <p>The name Moon wasn't originally a surname, but just an appellation which eventually became a surname after a long time. Furthermore, the Moon Clan actually consisted of four wealthy clans, but later on had been integrated into one. Their original surnames were also insignificant so in the end, they were called the Moon Clan.</p>

  <p>The disciples of the Moon Clan didn't value the points in the Arena of Legends, because the top three clans had way more consummate True Gods than the ordinary wealthy clans. Usually, they only needed to collect their points a few times at a crucial time, but their points would still be far more than those of the fourth clan, the Leng Clan.</p>

  <p>As time went by, the ordinary wealthy clans grew too lazy to compete with the top three of the Floating Islands. After all, they couldn't win the seat anyway.</p>

  <p>After some time, Moore Moon had noticed that there was an anonymous man who had participated in battles challenging higher level warriors.</p>

  <p>He was very curious, but his own ranking was much higher than that of this anonymous man--who was Luo Luo Zheng in reality. Thus, he had to lower his ranking in order to challenge Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>It was immensely grueling to raise one's ranking in the Hall of True Gods, but very easy to lower it. It could be done by simply admitting defeat in every battle.</p>

  <p>Thus, Moore's ranking dropped hundreds of thousands of places from the seventeenth, until he finally met Luo Luo Zheng. There had been a time when his ranking was accidentally more than 10000 places lower than Luo Zheng's, as Luo Zheng's ranking had gone up too fast. Thus, he had no choice but to defeat two warriors to rise up a bit.</p>

  <p>He had exerted efforts to get closer to Luo Zheng's ranking, but Luo Luo Zheng suddenly did not go out of his room at all and refused to accept the challenges.</p>

  <p>Moore had been depressed to death. This time, he had finally seen Luo Luo Zheng open the door. How could he let this opportunity slip through his fingers?</p>

  <p>He wasted no time. He immediately said his price and challenged Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"No wonder," Luo Luo Zheng said with a smile. "I really didn't expect that someone would lower their rank to challenge me."</p>

  <p>It was known that Moore was strong and one of the best low-rank True Gods. In addition, he had thoroughly studied Luo Zheng's fighting style and strength. Luo Luo Zheng had underestimated him in the beginning, but he was the one who got seriously injured in the end.</p>

  <p>"Just accept your failure and join our Moon Clan. We will offer the best treatment, no matter which clan you come from," Moore stated with a smug smile. He was not interested in points at all; what he liked was the fighting process.</p>

  <p>A tiny stream of blood flowed from Luo Zheng's lung, then he spoke. "Why should I accept my failure? Do you think I will lose?" he asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Needless to say, Moore was shocked.</p>

  <p>"Do you think you still have a chance?" he asked. "Chance... Isn't it always there?" Luo Luo Zheng said calmly.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" A small smile tugged at the corner of Luo Zheng's lips.</p>

  <p>"Look behind you."</p>

  <p>Moore did as he was told and saw a circle.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Luo Zheng had retreated a few seconds ago, he had left an oval imprint in the ice. Moore was still confused over his words.</p>

  <p>As soon as Luo Luo Zheng had finished speaking, an icy blue flame suddenly combusted and rapidly spread around the circle.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>The Ice Soul Flame started to burn fierily, then it enveloped Luo Luo Zheng and Moore.</p>

  <p>"You truly have strange tactics. Even until now I can't find where your real body is, but I think it must be in this circle," said Luo Luo Zheng. "If so, then I just need to freeze everything in this circle," he finished.</p>

  <p>"This is?" Moore uttered in shock when he saw the icy blue flames.</p>

  <p>"This is the Ice Soul Flame! And it is complete! How could you possibly fully comprehend Holy Jay's Ice Soul Flame?!"</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The Ice Soul Flame had spread at an extremely fast speed. It had already filled the whole circle in just a blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng didn't answer Moore's question. The Ice Soul Flame could have a stronger effect in the Land of Extreme Chillness, but at least, the speed at which the flames had spread was still beyond his expectation.</p>

  <p>However, Moore wasn't willing to lose to Luo Luo Zheng. His fat body dodged the Ice Soul Flame that constantly licked at him and occasionally turned into a pile of snowflakes, then back to normal again. Finally, Luo Luo Zheng saw a fat man in an ice armor, who rolled on the ground before the Ice Soul Flame froze him completely. 'This one should be his real body, right?' Luo Luo Zheng thought.</p>
