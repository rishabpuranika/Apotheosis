<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1272 The Universe Spirit Tablet </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Seeing this scene, Ning Yudie curled up her lips and said to Saul, "It looks like this barrier cannot be opened at all!"</p>

  <p>The power that Luo Zheng's terrifying punch released exceeded Yudie's expectations, but it still wasn't enough to break through the barrier. She started to wonder whether Saul was just trying to play a trick on them.</p>

  <p>Hearing Yudie's words, Saul looked indifferent and responded, "Luo Luo Zheng can't break this barrier, but that doesn't mean others can't do so."</p>

  <p>"Hmm. If even Luo Luo Zheng can't break through this barrier, who else can?"</p>

  <p>Mu Ning asked indignantly. The three women had done all they could to defend Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Saul couldn't be bothered to argue with these women. He directly turned towards Luo Luo Zheng and told him, "Since you've already tried brute force, you should use the token with the word 'thunder' now. Like I said, with your current strength, you can't break through the True Barrier."</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng laughed and remarked, "I don't need to use the token!"</p>

  <p>After he finished these words, a pickaxe appeared in his hand.</p>

  <p>When Saul saw the pickaxe in Luo Zheng's hand, a hint of surprise finally appeared on his face. "The Black Star?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded. This time, he brandished the Black Star in his hand and without hesitation, ruthlessly smashed it at the True Barrier!</p>

  <p>"Clang!"</p>

  <p>The True Barrier shattered with a loud bang as soon as it was hit by the Black Star. The incomparably hard barrier collapsed like a paper under the attack of the Black Star.</p>

  <p>Then, Luo Luo Zheng asked Saul, "You've been staying in the Immortal Mansion all this while, so how come you know this pickaxe?"</p>

  <p>Saul slightly smiled and the surprise on his face faded away. He told Luo Luo Zheng, "In this universe, numerous warriors have created their own ranking of magic weapons, but the most popular one is the Universe Spirit Tablet. After this Spirit Tablet was created, the various races from all over the world also created a copy of it. As soon as a supreme divine weapon is born, it is detected by the Spirit Tablet, and its name appears on it..."</p>

  <p>"The Universe Spirit Tablet?" Luo Luo Zheng suddenly raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>Saul nodded and continued, "If I remember correctly, as a supreme divine weapon, this pickaxe is most probably ranked in the top 900 places. The Law of Causality within the Black Star is at a very high level. But it is just a pickaxe after all, so it is not easy to bring its actual strength into play. If it was forged into a weapon like an axe or a sword, it might be able to find itself among the top 600 or 700 weapons of the universe!"</p>

  <p>Hearing this ranking, Luo Luo Zheng nodded his head. He knew very little about the situation of the Upper World and was extremely curious about the Spirit Tablet. So he asked, "Are there over ten thousand weapons on the Universe Spirit Tablet? And are all of them supreme divine weapons?"</p>

  <p>However, Saul shook his head. "The number of the supreme divine weapons is small in the universe. A small universe wouldn't be able to hold more than ten thousand supreme divine weapons."</p>

  <p>"A small universe..." Luo Zheng's face was filled with amazement. The universe as he knew of, encompassed 100, 000 supreme worlds, and the scope of a supreme world was so vast that Luo Luo Zheng found it hard to imagine. But Saul thought that the universe was too small. What did this man have in his mind? From his words, Luo Luo Zheng was able to draw a conclusion. This universe seemed to have an end. What was at the end of the universe? And what existed beyond the universe?</p>

  <p>However, it was difficult for Luo Luo Zheng to understand such a vast and complex matter right now. It also wasn't something that Luo Luo Zheng needed to explore right now either. He still wanted to know more about the Spirit Tablet though.</p>

  <p>"If a supreme divine weapon is forged, it is ranked in the top 3, 000 on the Spirit Tablet. The top-grade divine weapons are over 3, 000th in the rankings. However, the top one hundred weapons on the Universe Spirit Tablet are very special. In the future, when you fly into the Upper World, you will naturally find everything there is to know about them.</p>

  <p>Moreover, I have not explored the Universe Spirit Tablet for a long time now. It is not made of cold stone. The weapons on it will constantly change according to the reaction of the Spirit Tablet... After so many years, the Black Star which can only be used for digging things has probably fallen out of the top thousand," Saul continued.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded his head in silence. The Black Star was not a weapon for Luo Luo Zheng, but it still came in very useful some times. "Well, in any case, I have used the Black Star to break the True Barrier. Now, take me to the True Path!"</p>

  <p>Saul nodded. "Follow me."</p>

  <p>Under Saul's lead, Luo Luo Zheng and the three women continued to move forwards. Just like what Immortal Mist had said, this Immortal Mansion was actually much bigger than what Luo Luo Zheng had imagined.</p>

  <p>After walking for a while, Luo Luo Zheng saw the surrounding scenery gradually change. The high walls could no longer be seen and their surroundings were all open spaces now. There was a path with all kinds of strange flowers and plants glowing on both sides.</p>

  <p>The path was just a common ridge of the fields in a small village.</p>

  <p>However, this path was so thin that only one person could walk on it at a time. It stretched all the way to the far end without any visible end to it.</p>

  <p>"Here we are," Saul said simply.</p>

  <p>Seeing the small ridge of the fields, Luo Luo Zheng, Ning Yudie, Mu Ning, and even Mu Ning who was usually nonchalant had strange looks on their faces,</p>

  <p>"Is... this really the True Path?" Luo Luo Zheng could not help asking.</p>

  <p>Saul nodded his head. "Yes, there are a total of six stages to this True Path. And every time you manage to pass through a stage, you can get a token. However, it would be best if you just challenge the first stage right now. I am not even sure you can pass that at your current level of strength."</p>

  <p>"It's just a thin ridge of the fields, why is it difficult to walk through?"</p>

  <p>Mu Ning smiled.</p>

  <p>"You can try for yourself," Saul replied flatly after hearing Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>Although he was a bit dull, he was still a living soul after all.</p>

  <p>"Alright, I'll give it a try!" Mu Ning finished speaking and was just about to step onto the ridge of the fields, when a strong hand pulled her back.</p>

  <p>It was Luo Luo Zheng. He asked Saul, "Will our lives be in danger if we walk on the True Path?"</p>

  <p>"The True Path isn't a magic array, and all challenges that you will face are real, so yes... There is a risk associated with it. Generally speaking, the True Path is passable enough for warriors at the Soul Sea Realm or above. Of course, there are a few outstanding Life and Death Realm warriors who can walk on it. However, even such exceptional Life and Death Realm warriors can only walk through the first stage," Saul explained.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Luo Luo Zheng immediately pulled back Mu Ning several more steps.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, he was able to grab hold of her. With Xi Youqin's current strength, she wouldn't have been able to last on the True Path.</p>

  <p>Saul's words made Ning Yudie and the others worried. The three women did not want Luo Luo Zheng to risk his life for this endeavor. Mu Ning could not hold it and tried to stop him. "Luo Luo Zheng, if it's too dangerous, you can wait and go back this time. You can come here and give it a try after your cultivation base improves and reaches a higher level."</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie also frowned and nodded her head. He had just broken through and reached the Life and Death Realm. It was not wise to recklessly face such dangerous challenges for the time being.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stared at the ridge of the field which was extending almost into the horizon. After pondering over it for a while, he remembered that the mysterious old man, whose name he still didn't know, had given him a pill on his wedding day. At that time, the pill didn't seem to have any effect at all. However, in the following days, Luo Luo Zheng was surprised to discover that a miraculous change had occurred inside his body. The life vitality that was supposed to gradually solidify now seemed to be liquefying, and he could feel that his cultivation base had increased several times faster than before.</p>

  <p>Although the old man didn't consider the pill to be something valuable, Luo Luo Zheng was clear that this pill had awakened its intelligence, and it could even escape and attack people. Besides, its strength was also very powerful. No matter what the case was, the pill's effects were far beyond Luo Zheng's imagination.</p>

  <p>For now, all he knew was that his cultivating speed had increased greatly.</p>

  <p>Although he had spent most of the past two months with Ning Yudie and Mu Ning, and had only spent a few days cultivating, Luo Luo Zheng could faintly feel that his cultivation base had reached its limit. He thought that he would have to accept the second small Heavenly Tribulation and advance to the second level of the Life and Death Realm pretty soon.</p>

  <p>With Luo Zheng's current strength, it would not be difficult for him to return to the Eastern Region from the Central Region and enter the Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>Although What Ning Yudie said made sense, Luo Luo Zheng still shook his head. He wanted to try now. "Since we've already come here all the way, how can I give up so easily?"</p>

  <p>Saul smiled slightly. "I know you won't give up so easily, but I still have to remind you. Your true strength is comparable to that of a Soul Sea Realm warrior, so yeah, there is a chance that you might be able to break through the first stage of the True Path. As long as you can get a token, that's not too bad. You can even open the weapon refining workshop or a library with the token, which would let you gain endless benefits. So I suggest you should give it a try."</p>

  <p>Mu Ning asked in an annoyed tone, "What if Luo Luo Zheng is injured? Are you responsible for that?"</p>

  <p>Saul just ignored her words. He could not be bothered to argue with her.</p>
