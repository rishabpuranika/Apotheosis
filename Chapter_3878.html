<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Faced with such a crisis, the Snake Goddess was also focusing her entire concentration on the fight. It wouldn't have been possible to catch her off guard right now.</p>

  <p>As soon as the enchanted barrier was broken, she instantly activated another one. This blood red enchanted barrier was seemingly as fragile as an eggshell for now, but it was once known as the toughest enchanted barrier in the Source World.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, things had changed! Just as the second enchanted barrier was activated, it was able to only slightly block the incoming flames before shattering to pieces again.</p>

  <p>Without hesitation, the Snake Goddess activated several more enchanted barriers.</p>

  <p>Six of them were out forward in a row to block the energy that was swarming over towards the team.</p>

  <p>The truth was, only a small portion of the energy was being blocked, while most of it was being absorbed by Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Let's move. We'll try to get close to the edge of this area," the Snake Goddess suggested.</p>

  <p>Fuxi instantly understood what she meant. He grabbed her, flew to the side, and was almost instantly at the edge of the area.</p>

  <p>Once they got close to the edge, they placed Zheng's body in front of them.</p>

  <p>The power of Element Destruction could only surge from one direction, and with Zheng's body in front, it would naturally be completely absorbed by him.</p>

  <p>With his body, Fuxi and the Snake Goddess had created a small safe haven for themselves.</p>

  <p>Claire noticed this, but at the moment, her main opponents were not these two. Rather, she was facing the Grandmaster of Heaven and Gerald.</p>

  <p>"Now that you have shown your own abilities, let's see how long you can hold out with those!" Claire roared.</p>

  <p>The power of Element Destruction was divided into seven levels, and at the moment, Claire was using the third level. Even then, it was incredibly powerful.</p>

  <p>So much so that apart from the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, Zheng, Gerald, and the Grandmaster of Heaven, no other living being could be seen in this area.</p>

  <p>Every single part of space had been torn apart by the overwhelming elemental energy.</p>

  <p>"The fourth level!"</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>With a burst of extraordinary power, a huge column of swirling wind began to spin in the center of the space, accompanied by intense lightning and flames. As the flames spun with the wind, it looked like they were creating a fiery localized cyclone that would devour everything in its path.</p>

  <p>When the flames swept over Gerald, layers upon layers of embedded carapaces began to grow on his body.</p>

  <p>They were a powerful defensive mechanism which could greatly lower the efficiency of the Element Destruction, protecting Gerald's body from much harm.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven kept a straight face. The Golden Dragon Scissors in his hand instantly shattered all the energy that was trying to approach him.</p>

  <p>"The fifth level!"</p>

  <p>Once the Element Destruction reached the fifth level, Claire's huge body began to shrink down at a visible speed.</p>

  <p>She had come there with the Yellow Thearch's body. Now, she was consuming her own strength as well as the Yellow Thearch's to fight.</p>

  <p>Since she had already activated the Element Destruction now, she had no intention of giving up. She wasn't going to stop until all of these pesky people in front of her had been turned to ash!</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess and Fuxi curled up together behind Zheng, who was still protecting them.</p>

  <p>The power of the Element Destruction at the fifth level was already quite terrifying. If it weren't for Zheng, the Snake Goddess and Fuxi wouldn't have been able to hold on even for just a few minutes under such extreme pressure.</p>

  <p>Even the Grandmaster of Heaven and Gerald found it difficult to resist this power.</p>

  <p>If Claire decided to activate the sixth or seventh level, then there was no telling how powerful she was going to be! They could die if that happened!</p>

  <p>And then misfortune struck further! While Gerald was lost in thought, he suddenly heard Claire say in a cold voice, "The sixth level!"</p>

  <p>Then, the power of the Element Destruction was further enhanced.</p>

  <p>Obviously, with the enhancement came its price as well. Claire couldn't hold on for too long now, and her huge body was now shrinking rapidly.</p>

  <p>But her opponents were going to be able to hold on for an even shorter time.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>A thin bolt of lightning drilled into Gerald's body. Under the effect of the Element Destruction, this seemingly ordinary bolt of lightning had become extremely powerful. It easily penetrated through his carapaces and went all the way through his body, coming out of his back like a slithering snake.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven was also in a fix now. Although he was managing to hold on with a few extremely powerful magic treasures for the time being, once Claire activated the seventh level of her move, even he would be in great danger.</p>

  <p>Near the edge of the area, the explosive power of the elements surged into Zheng's body like a tidal wave.</p>

  <p>These elements were the most basic ones, but with the efforts the Element Spirit race had made across countless years, they had evolved into numerous different types.</p>

  <p>For example, Claire's real body itself was formed from dozens of kinds of flames. Therefore, after Zheng had absorbed one third of her real body, more than thirty light pillars had risen in the map.</p>

  <p>Claire was borrowing the power of the other members of the Element Spirit race to activate the Element Destruction. Each of the elements had about thirty to forty types.</p>

  <p>In the Eternal Divine Courtyard, the map under the sacred cup suddenly began to respond to the immense energy surge. This time, there were more than 130 light pillars extending all at the same time.</p>

  <p>The statues on the four pillars exchanged some curious glances with each other, but fell silent afterwards. Whatever was happening in front of them was beyond their comprehension.</p>

  <p>The changes in the map had exceeded all they had ever expected or been trained for. They had nothing left to say or do.</p>

  <p>"The seventh level!"</p>

  <p>Claire finally decided to use the seventh level power of the Element Destruction, and now, she had no intentions of making any considerations for the Yellow Thearch. After she released the immense power, her own strength was going to suffer a heavy blow, and the Yellow Thearch's body suffered an even more tragic end. Chances were that his body would never be able to come back to its original form.</p>

  <p>However, just as Claire was about to release the seventh level power, the Grandmaster of Heaven suddenly made a move, and a cube appeared in front of him with a flash. At the same time, another cube also appeared in Claire's body, and a third one surrounded Gerald.</p>

  <p>The three spaces where these three characters were suddenly turned into one, which was also a kind of theurgy of the space truth.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven joined hands with Claire a moment ago, but now he had no choice but to use Gerald's power. The moment Gerald was enveloped in the cube, he had appeared in Claire's body. Without any hesitation, he pierced his tail through the cube and stabbed at Claire.</p>

  <p>Energy with two different colors, yellow and green, quickly spread through Claire's body.</p>

  <p>The Poison of Decomposition had an extremely rapid and powerful effect on soul and energy based bodies, and was far less effective on creatures with physical bodies.</p>

  <p>As the Poison of Decomposition spread around quickly, Claire's huge body quickly collapsed, and pretty soon, disappeared into nothingness.</p>

  <p>"You... You..."</p>

  <p>Claire had never expected that the Grandmaster of Heaven would be bold enough to send Gerald directly into her body, nor had she expected that the latter's Poison of Decomposition would be so deadly.</p>

  <p>Within a short period of time, the Poison of Decomposition had spread throughout her entire body, and coursed through all her veins. In a moment, her body was completely decomposed.</p>

  <p>As the Poison of Decomposition spread over her head, Claire finally realized that she could do nothing to regain her winning position now. She raised her head, and a golden eyeball shot into the sky and disappeared.</p>

  <p>Far away, the golden eyeball appeared in front of the Divine Farmer. Then a tattered body formed near the eyeball and slowly took a misshapen shape. It was none other than the body of the Yellow Thearch which had been occupied by Claire for a long time. Nothing but a twisted form was left now.</p>

  <p>After the eyeball was gone, Claire's huge body instantly dissipated, and the power of the Element Destruction never managed to reach the seventh level. It began to weaken and dissipate, and finally everything was calm once again.</p>
