<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Having comforted Yan, Luo Zheng looked down and was shocked at the sight that awaited him. Instead of two legs, his sister's lower half had been replaced by a snake tail.</p>

  <p>"Yan, what happened to your legs?"</p>

  <p>His sister blushed in embarrassment, not really keen with her brother seeing this half-human, half-snake form of hers.</p>

  <p>She had taken back the Energy Shaft and there was no need for her to maintain this form.</p>

  <p>With a twist of her cyan tail, a burst of light enveloped her and the next thing Luo Zheng knew, was that her fair, flawless legs reappeared. "This is the bloodline token of the Li Shan mountain," Yan explained.</p>

  <p>"Bloodline token?" Luo Zheng repeated with curiosity. "It helps you transform?"</p>

  <p>He couldn't help but think of Feng Ge. She possessed the bloodline token of the Jin Wu but she didn't have the power to transform herself into a real Sun Crow. How did Yan do it then? It seemed things were more complicated than she let on.</p>

  <p>Her explanation was vague at most as if she didn't want him to ask too many questions.</p>

  <p>Despite his constant prodding, Yan remained mum about the topic. Left with no answer, Luo Zheng chose to give up and let his sister keep her secret. With that, he unfurled his wings and flew away. "The crystals of the Chaotic Source Spirits will be distributed to the disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace and Li Shan mountain first."</p>

  <p>His voice was deep and incredibly loud, resounding all throughout the entire Green Jade World.</p>

  <p>Nobody objected, which Luo Zheng took as everyone's silent agreement to his terms.</p>

  <p>Each person had a limit of accommodating only two hundred crystals.</p>

  <p>Moreover, each race suffered heavy losses in their numbers, so even if the Taiyi Heaven Palace and Li Shan mountain got first dibs, there would still be enough left over.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng glided towards the body of the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits, while Chaim and Natalie led the disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace and Li Shan mountain respectively. With everyone present, the distribution of the crystals began.</p>

  <p>The moment Luo Zheng took the crystals out, he found a thick aura emanating from inside the body.</p>

  <p>Puzzled, he waved his hand, splitting the body open to reveal a ton of golden red crystals!</p>

  <p>"Are these also the crystals of the Chaotic Source Spirits?" he murmured in shock.</p>

  <p>The sight of these golden red crystals was met with calm indifference by the disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace and Li Shan mountain, however, the same couldn't be said for the other races.</p>

  <p>Fanaticism and excitement glimmered in their eyes. They had long since suspected that the mother's body harbored some special things. She had been hiding in the main peak for so long; thus, there was no way she only had ordinary crystals.</p>

  <p>This suspicion ate through their insides since the only way to confirm it would be to kill the mother and open her insides. Now that it was taken care of, they could only relish in the fact that they had been right!</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Luo Zheng still had the final say in the distribution of the crystals.</p>

  <p>Only around several hundred golden red crystals were in the body. He quickly dashed everyone's hopes by slicing the air and putting those special, golden red crystals into his own space ring.</p>

  <p>"Crack..."</p>

  <p>He sliced the air a second time, making a bigger cut on the body.</p>

  <p>Once again, a strange force emanated from the newly made cut.</p>

  <p>"Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop..."</p>

  <p>Over ten circles of light suddenly shot out of the depths and suspended themselves in the air.</p>

  <p>Everyone's attention was immediately onto these circles of light.</p>

  <p>Fuxi and Mount were both transfixed by these orbs as if they recognized them or something.</p>

  <p>"What are these circles of light?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng asked, flying up and touching one.</p>

  <p>At that exact moment, a figure suddenly began its approach from the edge of the Icy Snow Province.</p>

  <p>It was huge, standing hundreds of thousands of feet tall. It forcefully expanded the space crack to accommodate its size, the earth shaking as it forced its way in.</p>

  <p>"Splash!"</p>

  <p>When it finally got its body through the space crack, the creature flashed and began to rush towards the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>It didn't care about the restrictions of the Chaotic Source World and ran towards it head-on.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the colossal figure appeared above everyone's head. As a shocking presence, it emitted an unparalleled malicious aura.</p>

  <p>Members of various great forces stiffened in fear when they saw it, their souls trembling violently at the sight of a colossus that came out of nowhere.</p>

  <p>This creature unfurled a pair of dark wings wherein blood-colored lightning flowed. Its head was huge, inlaid with a solitary eye that was also surrounded by electricity. It was a colossal, single-eyed bat bathed by the energy of thunder and lightning!</p>

  <p>What kind of monster was this thing?!</p>

  <p>The crowd was rendered speechless from terror, unable to think, let alone cry for help.</p>

  <p>Even Mount, ever so calm and steady, was reduced to a pale, sputtering man in the face of such a terrifying monster.</p>

  <p>The leaders at the gate of the Chaotic Source World could only look on with horror.</p>

  <p>"Damn it! I completely forgot about this monster!"</p>

  <p>Fuxi cursed under his breath as he looked at this colossus.</p>

  <p>He had stood on top of the snowy mountain all this time because of two things: one, he needed to prevent the Black Ship from making trouble, and two, he needed to watch over this monster.</p>

  <p>However, he was way too preoccupied with saving Yan when he entered the Chaotic Source World that it completely slipped his mind.</p>

  <p>"Splash!"</p>

  <p>The one-eyed bat monster swung at Luo Zheng with unbelievably fast reflexes.</p>

  <p>Given its size, one would think it would be slow and sluggish but that wasn't the case at all.</p>

  <p>Unable to dodge, Luo Zheng took on the full force of the bat's paw and his entire crystal body shattered.</p>

  <p>It grabbed at the circles of light and flapped its wings, thunder and lightning flashing as it prepared to fly away.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>Before it could leave, a black and white pattern of Eight Diagrams appeared above the bat. Fuxi had thrown his punch and was not going to let this monster go.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>Huge fragments exploded from the space and the bat took the blow hard. Its colossal body rolled over dozens of circles before landing directly outside the ring-shaped mountain range.</p>

  <p>The sudden attack flustered the monster and caught it off guard; nonetheless, the bat was fine.</p>

  <p>"Hand the things over!"</p>

  <p>Fuxi roared, his voice cutting through the air like thunder.</p>

  <p>Mount, who had been standing nearby Fuxi, covered his ears in pain. It wasn't just him. Those who heard Fuxi's shout let out a painful cry as blood shot out of their ears, deafened by his roar.</p>

  <p>Fuxi jumped, his body expanding and also becoming incomparably huge!</p>

  <p>Although his Truth of Powerful Holy Body remained confined, Fuxi was still one of the giants who emerged at the beginning of the chaos. He naturally cultivated the Wild God Power.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>Another pattern of Eight Diagrams appeared over the bat. This time, when Fuxi slapped its body, the bat let out a shrill cry of pain. Its wings flapped helplessly as it summoned the power of thunder and lightning to confront its opponent's palm attack.</p>

  <p>"Rumble..."</p>

  <p>As these two huge and indescribable forces collided, the space around them began to break down, revealing the black void.</p>
