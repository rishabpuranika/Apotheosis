  <p>
</p>

  <p>Shaky and anxious murmurs filled the night air as the Cloudy City was in deep danger.</p>

  <p>Heavy footsteps clanked continuously on the pavement. Under Yudie's order, all the warriors were quickly evacuated.</p>

  <p>High up in the sky, numerous martial artists from the Cloud Hall poured out of the exits. The Cloud Hall looked like a broken bag of rice when viewed from the Cloudy City as countless martial artists scattered like rice grains in various directions.</p>

  <p>Just then, the shaking in the Cloud Hall intensified.</p>

  <p>The mortals in the Central Region viewed the Cloud Hall as something of a colossus, an aerial edifice that would never sink.</p>

  <p>However, Ning Yudie and the others in the Cloud Hall knew very well that the grand sorcerer or the Spirit Supreme Realm warriors could completely destroy the Cloud Hall with only one move...</p>

  <p>"Where's dad? Why don't I see him..." Luo Nian said. He leaned on Imogen's back in thought while the latter hoisted him up further on her back.</p>

  <p>Even at his young age, he knew what the panic on the faces of the many warriors in the Cloud Hall meant. He understood that the supposedly fortified place was now in deep trouble.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry. Your father will be fine!" Imogen reassured him. However, she too was quite worried deep inside.</p>

  <p>The Cloud Hall was important to her and she had put a lot of energy and effort towards its development, only for Luo Luo Zheng to bring it so much problems.</p>

  <p>Although Imogen felt upset, she was also worried about Luo Luo Zheng. After all, he was the only one who had contributed the most to the Cloud Hall and helped it become the top sect in the Central Region.</p>

  <p>But after Luo Luo Zheng had ascended to the Upper World, he would've surely gotten himself into trouble. Now, the trouble he had faced was far more than what the Cloud Hall could handle. At this moment, the Cloud Hall was like a mere mosquito that the almighty warriors of the Upper World could easily crush.</p>

  <p>Aside from the Cloud Hall, all the city gates of the Cloudy City were open and all the transmission arrays had been lit up overnight.</p>

  <p>Everyone in the third-grade clans, all the forces of the World Commercial Alliance, and even the common mortals hurriedly moved out of the city.</p>

  <p>This time, the battle was as fierce as Luo Luo Zheng had never felt before. His opponents were like jungle beasts against them, who were like mere ants.</p>

  <p>It was no secret that many innocent lives might be lost during the fight.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>A blinding bolt of light loudly shot towards the sky, and the Cloud Hall suddenly shook and tilted to the side!</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the Cloud Hall was on a huge floating rock. It would still stay afloat even if it were to be toppled or rolled around.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Ning Yudie got distracted from evacuating the warriors when she saw the scene. Her worried gaze drifted to the peak of Cloud Hall, and she sighed.</p>

  <p>If the Cloud Hall was destroyed, it could be rebuilt.</p>

  <p>As long as the foundation was still there, she wouldn't care even if she had to abandon this piece of floating stone. She just hoped that nothing bad happened to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Yet, she only got more worried as she thought about it. She paused for a moment and thought about returning to the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>"Tia, what are you doing?" Imogen's loud voice cut through Yudie's ears.</p>

  <p>Yudie's gaze flickered as she said, "I want to go and take a look..."</p>

  <p>"It's useless for you to watch or meddle in a high-level battle! What would Luo Luo Zheng think if you lost your life just like that?" Imogen said coldly.</p>

  <p>She knew that Ning Yudie was stubborn, so she had no choice but to be a little tougher on her.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie was silent. She clearly knew that she wasn't of much help, but she couldn't help but feel envious of Mu Ning. Xi Youqin's talent enabled her to help Luo Luo Zheng, while Ning Yudie couldn't.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng is too lucky. A man with such great fortune wouldn't die so easily,"</p>

  <p>Imogen said in a softer voice. Her words made Ning Yudie feel a bit more at ease, even if Luo Luo Zheng was no longer the same as before.</p>

  <p>Back then, Luo Luo Zheng could still survive a fight even when he was faced against someone stronger than him...</p>

  <p>"Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh..."</p>

  <p>Just then, a streak of black light from the top of the Cloud Hall shot into the sky, and then beams of light followed.</p>

  <p>"Swash!"</p>

  <p>At that moment, a sharp sword light pierced through the air like a meteor as it gradually expanded. It quickly flew towards the side of Cloudy City and landed on a patch of wilderness at the city's outskirts.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, the whole ground began to quake.</p>

  <p>"Rumble..."</p>

  <p>It turned out that Lone was behind that sword strike!</p>

  <p>Back then in the painting, each move made by a Godly Genius against their opponent could almost destroy the whole board.</p>

  <p>However, it was completely different now. If they launched an attack, they could cause mountain landslides, tsunamis, and mass destruction.</p>

  <p>The sword strike landed somewhere in the wilderness and caused the ground to roll up. Mounds of soil sputtered up and formed a mountain of about a thousand feet tall. However, the sword light's momentum wasn't decreasing anytime soon as it continued downwards on the side of Cloudy City, leaving a crack over a hundred miles long in its wake.</p>

  <p>In turn, the underground river was split in half. The strong currents washed over the two sides of the rocky crevice and formed numerous large caves, while the animals underground fled away at the sudden impact.</p>

  <p>It was also Lone's this sword strike that would create a huge canyon in the future.</p>

  <p>The Cloud Hall faced upwards again after it rolled. Meanwhile, the martial artists of Cloud Hall and Cloudy City were deeply relieved to see the powerful warriors get further and further away from them. They silently hoped that the warriors would never come back again.</p>

  <p>Up high in the sky, Luo Luo Zheng led the charge and was engaged in a fight with the grand sorcerer.</p>

  <p>It was because he was the only one who could withstand the ghost claws' attacks!</p>

  <p>Of the eight Godly Geniuses, seven of them were at the Spirit Supreme Realm, while Mu Ning was at the Soul Sea Realm. Even though the eight of them had joined forces to fight the grand sorcerer who was as strong as a world lord, it was barely enough to keep their opponent at bay. At the same time, the long fight rendered the sorcerer unable to kill any of the Godly Geniuses.</p>

  <p>Naturally, the grand sorcerer was secretly shocked. According to his previous judgment, he should've been able to defeat these Spirit Supreme Realm warriors with his power, as the Torch Dragon and the supreme sorcerer handled the two Supreme Lords. Thus, he had confidently unleashed the Smoky Heart-locking Curse.</p>

  <p>But he never thought that these warriors at the Spirit Supreme Realm would be so remarkable!</p>

  <p>They were Godly Geniuses after all, and the Divine Dao that they cultivated gave them too much support...</p>

  <p>Fire filled Nathan's eyes as he launched consecutive attacks.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!" he screamed furiously.</p>

  <p>Before, he thought that he shouldn't follow Luo Luo Zheng and would not get involved in this mess. Yet, he struck his spear towards the grand sorcerer's body like it was a poisonous snake.</p>

  <p>Luckily, he had cultivated the Law Spear Strike, which helped him see through everything!</p>

  <p>But because of the limitations of his cultivation base, he only found a few flaws on the grand sorcerer. Then again he was Nathan, so a single strike was enough. As long as he successfully aimed at the sorcerer's flaw, even the grand sorcerer at the world lord realm would undoubtedly die.</p>

  <p>Shock was written all over the grand sorcerer's face as he faced Nathan's pointed spear.</p>

  <p>These Godly Geniuses certainly had strange but powerful cultivation methods. If he hadn't returned to the Spirit Transformation Realm due to suppression of his own cultivation realm, he probably wouldn't compare to any of them.</p>

  <p>It could be said that Nathan's attack was the most lethal among the eight Godly Geniuses.</p>

  <p>He seemed to be able to see through the grand sorcerer's vital points. His spear strike was nothing to a world lord, but the grand sorcerer felt like he was on the verge of death in the face of the spear's actual attack.</p>

  <p>"This is too dangerous. I have to kill this brat first!"</p>

  <p>With that thought in mind, he waved the bone cane in his hand and a bit of black fog was diffused. His body immediately disappeared into the black fog, and simultaneously dodged Nathan's spear strike.</p>

  <p>"He has made use of this move again!"</p>

  <p>"Everyone, be careful!"</p>

  <p>Even amidst a crisis, Luo Luo Zheng and the others reminded one another.</p>

  <p>If only they were faced with an ordinary world lord, they would've had a chance to claim victory in this battle.</p>

  <p>The key point was that this sorcerer race used really odd methods. Their cultivation methods weren't derived from a variety of laws. That combined with their strange cultivation methods made them difficult to defeat.</p>

  <p>"Swoosh!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the black fog froze and appeared behind Nathan.</p>

  <p>The grand sorcerer stretched out the bone cane in his hand, and punctured Nathan's back!</p>

  <p>"You should be the one to die, brat! Deadly Cane Strike!"</p>

  <p>An insect shadow gushed out of the bone cane's tip. This kind of strange insect was known as the "Nether Spring Cicada", which was said to have been caught from the nether world and could only be used by the sorcerer race's grand sorcerer. Each grand sorcerer's cane was specially designed by the sorcerer race, and was equipped with seven Nether Spring Cicadas!</p>

  <p>If the cane struck a warrior, the Nether Spring Cicada could enter the body. Once it had done so, not even a True God would be able to save them. Thus, the cane strike was called the "Deadly Cane Strike", and it resulted in one's immediate death.</p>

  <p>Since the grand sorcerer's attack happened so suddenly just as when Nathan was about to attack, he was caught off guard. The flaw was seemingly endless and he didn't have enough time to dodge.</p>

  <p>"Fuck!</p>

  <p>Damn it. Luo Luo Zheng brought me so much trouble..." Nathan mentally cursed Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p> </p>
