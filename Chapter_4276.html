<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>A tiny ring grew out of the Heavenly Ring Staff and floated on its side.</p>

  <p>It was purple and was surrounded by purple lightning bolts.</p>

  <p>Zheng, who was not too far away, could feel the power of those purple lightning bolts. The power wasn't the energy of the fourth-grade world. It was an energy of certain Extreme Form from the Deep Space.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>A second ring floated out of the staff.</p>

  <p>There were two spiral lights at the center of the ring. One was black, and the other one was white. The two lights intertwined and completely filled the whole ring.</p>

  <p>Zheng had seen these lights before? the Starry Roc-fish had once used this power to turn Zheng's body into energy. They were the power of the Magnetic Light Extreme Form that could magnetize substances into energy.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>The third ring came out, and then the fourth one, and the fifth one...</p>

  <p>One after another, rings grew out of the Heavenly Ring Staff and lined up neatly around it.</p>

  <p>As Zheng watched all of these occurred, a word suddenly popped out in his mind? the map...</p>

  <p>There were three hundred and seventy-three types of abilities of the ancestry-level bloodline in the Eternal Divine Courtyard, and there was also a map that marked the types. The function of these rings should be similar to that of the map.</p>

  <p>"Ancestry-level bloodline, is the Heavenly Ring Staff displaying its abilities?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>After a moment of silence, the ancestry-level bloodline said, "This is more than a display of abilities. As the staff shows its abilities, it's also directly merging into your primitive land. Once the merging process is completed, these abilities can be used by you just the same way you can use my abilities!"</p>

  <p>Zheng raised his eyebrows. Although obtaining the Heavenly Ring Staff meant he gained control of the power in the Deep Space, he never expected the process to be so smooth. He continued, "In that case, I should have one hundred and forty types of abilities later?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," the ancestry-level bloodline replied in a depressed tone.</p>

  <p>The reaction of the ancestry-level bloodline baffled Zheng. "What's wrong with you?"</p>

  <p>"I... I'm searching for my memories," said the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>When the Deep Space was downgraded, the ancestry-level bloodline lost a portion of its extremely important memories, causing it to forget its original identity.</p>

  <p>It had been placing its hopes on the Heavenly Ring Staff because it thought that a portion of its lost memories very likely resided within the staff.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, as the abilities of the Heavenly Ring Staff came out one after another, it still hadn't found any signs of its lost memories.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry? maybe your memory is hidden deep inside it. Let's wait and see," Zheng comforted, though he knew the possibility was slim.</p>

  <p>"Buzz, buzz, buzz..."</p>

  <p>Many rings representing various types of abilities appeared and lined up around the staff.</p>

  <p>One hundred and thirty-seven...</p>

  <p>One hundred and thirty-eight...</p>

  <p>One hundred and thirty-nine...</p>

  <p>One hundred and forty...</p>

  <p>All the abilities the Heavenly Ring Staff had were presented before Zheng and the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>Zheng's gaze never strayed away from the staff. This staff most likely housed a spirit that had gained wisdom, so he was wondering? would it appear?</p>

  <p>At this moment, the green color on the surface of the Heavenly Ring Staff was fading away at a rapid speed. Along with the fading of the green color on its surface, the Heavenly Ring Staff began to dry up, transforming back into a withered branch. Before long, it quickly started to rot.</p>

  <p>Crack...</p>

  <p>A thick crack suddenly broke open on it, and a palm-sized crystal appeared from within.</p>

  <p>"This crystal..."</p>

  <p>Zheng released his spiritual sense to examine the crystal.</p>

  <p>However, the moment his spiritual sense touched the crystal, it disappeared without a trace. The crystal seemed to be conscious and on guard. It simply didn't allow Zheng to see through it.</p>

  <p>"Swish, swish, swish..."</p>

  <p>Long, thin, blood-red lines suddenly appeared, spread over the crystal, and completely shrouded it in a matter of seconds. Right at that moment, the ancestry-level bloodline said, "This crystal is the spirit of the Heavenly Ring Staff. It won't allow strangers to touch it, but it might have my memories within it."</p>

  <p>An understanding expression appeared on Zheng's face. "Can you touch it then?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not sure, but I'll try. Leave this crystal to me. I'll deal with it," said the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>"Of course? go ahead," said Zheng.</p>

  <p>The ancestry-level bloodline and the Heavenly Ring Staff had the same origins. They belonged to each other, so it actually didn't need to ask for Zheng's consent at all.</p>

  <p>Whoosh...</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, the crystal soared to the sky.</p>

  <p>Zheng's gaze fell on the rings representing energies of various Extreme Forms. These energy rings were the capital he needed to fight against the downgrader, so he needed to master the use of every Extreme Form.</p>

  <p>Five days later.</p>

  <p>One "Zheng" was standing under each energy ring.</p>

  <p>In total, there were one hundred and forty "Zhengs" standing under those one hundred and forty energy rings.</p>

  <p>"Soul Extreme Form..."</p>

  <p>Zheng's voice echoed in the primitive land.</p>

  <p>One of those "Zhengs" slowly floated up, heading towards the energy ring above his head.</p>

  <p>That particular ring was light brown in color, and there was a thin layer of mist whirling at its center.</p>

  <p>"Disperse!"</p>

  <p>When that "Zheng" opened his eyes, his eyes were also covered in a layer of brown mist.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>A wave of invisible consciousness spread from that "Zheng."</p>

  <p>In a few seconds, the wave of consciousness had spread all over the vast space of the primitive land. However, it did not stop at that point. It continued to break through the space barrier and quickly spread around the chaos.</p>

  <p>Everything the wave of consciousness came into contact with was shown in Zheng's mind. This was an exploring-type of theurgy in the Soul Extreme Form. In other words, it was equivalent to the spiritual sense in the Deep Space.</p>

  <p>However, the spread of consciousness in the Soul Extreme Form was more difficult to be detected than the spread of spiritual sense. Moreover, the consciousness in the Soul Extreme Form could spread at a speed countless times faster and cover an area many times bigger.</p>

  <p>Soon, this rapidly spreading wave of consciousness had covered the Source World...</p>

  <p>Above the center of the Source World, there was an exquisite building.</p>

  <p>The building was made of pure black metal, and it was filled with countless black chains that bound an avatar of the Evil God inside the building.</p>

  <p>This avatar of the Evil God was a sentry. He had a terrifyingly acute perceptivity, and for this reason, he was placed outside the Source World to monitor every movement occurring in the chaos.</p>

  <p>For the current Evil God, how to manage his avatars was indeed a headache.</p>

  <p>Every avatar was extremely intelligent, and their rebellious nature was engraved in their bones.</p>

  <p>The Evil God had no choice but to forge a special kind of metal to trap the avatars that had tried to betray him.</p>

  <p>When that unnoticeable wave of consciousness spread to the Source World, the avatar suddenly raised his head. A trace of surprise appeared on his sinister face.</p>

  <p>"That direction... It's the primitive land...</p>

  <p>This consciousness is the Illusory Vision in the Soul Extreme Form. Has he also comprehended the power of the Deep Space?</p>

  <p>Interesting! Zheng's performance isn't bad!</p>

  <p>Master, did you feel it? I'm curious... Are you feeling afraid now?</p>

  <p>Hahaha..."</p>

  <p>Five minutes later.</p>

  <p>That wave of consciousness had already enveloped more than half of the chaos. Zheng also noticed the giant pyramid the Evil God had mentioned.</p>

  <p>But this time, Zheng's focus wasn't on the giant pyramid. He wanted to help Dorothy find her mother, and this Soul Extreme Form was naturally the best way to achieve his purpose.</p>

  <p>Just as his consciousness spread past the boundless inner wall of the chaos, Zheng suddenly discovered that tens of thousands of heads were piled up on the inner wall.</p>

  <p>It was such a rare scene to behold.</p>

  <p>Because these heads should have devoured each other until only one head remained? the last winner that would grow huge from devouring the others.</p>

  <p>Only when those heads had a common goal would they pile up on the wall like that.</p>

  <p>Zheng controlled his consciousness, directing it to see through these heads.</p>

  <p>Once he did, he finally saw a woman embedded in the wall.</p>
