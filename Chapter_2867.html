<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Moon Clan was led by the Moon Sect. Moon was the strongest among the three Holy Beings of the Moon Clan and was said to be ranked top three among all the Holy Beings. But normally, he seldom showed up in public, and the daily affairs of the Moon Clan were generally handled by Woodruff.</p>

  <p>Compared to Woodruff, Moon kept a low profile as if he did not exist.</p>

  <p>Samuel gave Moon an indifferent glance and didn't continue to embarrass Woodruff. He said loudly, "I'd like to discuss the reestablishment of the alliance of the powerful clans."</p>

  <p>"The alliance of the powerful clans has been existing for a long time now, and we are aware that you are a member of the alliance. Now Holy Nicholas has died. If the Holy Beings of the alliance are willing to recognize you as their new leader, that will be a good thing.</p>

  <p>Congratulations, Samuel," said Moon in a respectful tone as he cupped his hands toward Samuel.</p>

  <p>Samuel said with a slight smile, "In addition, I require all the powerful clans to join the alliance."</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings outside the alliance frowned slightly when they heard this.</p>

  <p>Samuel had mentioned it before, but they just treated it as a joke. They did not realize that Samuel would really force them to join the alliance.</p>

  <p>However, with those powerful warriors at the Other Shore Realm backing him up, it was another story.</p>

  <p>Moon, on the other hand, calmly answered, "The purpose of the alliance is to unite the Holy Beings. Would it be too much to force all the Holy Beings to join it?"</p>

  <p>Samuel's gaze swept over Woodruff and Marsh, one of the Holy Beings of the Sword Clan, and then said in a cold voice, "It's surely too much for those who don't want to join the alliance. As I have said before, there will only be one alliance of the powerful clans above the Time Sea in the future.</p>

  <p>If you don't want to join, you can leave the Time Sea."</p>

  <p>The expression on Moon's face slightly froze at his words. He tried his best to stay composed after hearing Samuel's words.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the other Holy Beings also looked gloomy.</p>

  <p>Samuel was really rude and unreasonable. After he was in power, he became even more cruel and vicious than Nicholas, which made circumstances worse.</p>

  <p>"It's a big deal to join the alliance of the powerful clans. There are many factions in my clan. I don't have the final say. I still have to discuss this matter with my advisers and constituents. Can I give you a reply another day?" Moon said. Under such a circumstance, he did not dare to refuse Samuel directly.</p>

  <p>"Of course you can," Samuel responded as he looked at Marsh intensely.</p>

  <p>Since Marsh came to the Hall of Holy Beings, he had had a long face. A Holy Being of the Sword Clan had just been killed, so he was furious. He did not know if he could handle his feelings well, but he composed himself.</p>

  <p>"What's your reply, Marsh?" Samuel asked.</p>

  <p>Marsh managed to squeeze out a smile on his face although it seemed like he was in pain. "The same as the Moon Clan. I have to go back to the Sunrest Tree. I'm afraid it will take some time before I give a reply."</p>

  <p>Samuel looked around the other Holy Beings and said, "So all of you can't give me a reply today either?"</p>

  <p>"I have to make an explanation to my clansmen," said one Holy Being.</p>

  <p>"The elders of our clan are stubborn. I'm afraid I have to spend some time persuading them," said another.</p>

  <p>"…"</p>

  <p>Samuel sneered inwardly. He wanted to break the faces of these Holy Beings, but he kept calm.</p>

  <p>Everyone knew that the Holy Beings were the core of their clans, and every word of them carried weight. Obviously, they made up an excuse to buy time as Moon did.</p>

  <p>Samuel sneered, "Alright. I'll give you one month. I hope you won't let me down. Otherwise, you don't have anyone to blame except for yourselves."</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings cupped their hands to Samuel and left the Hall of Holy Beings one by one.</p>

  <p>Just as Marsh was about to leave, Samuel said, "Marsh, wait a minute."</p>

  <p>Marsh asked in a long and wary face, "What's wrong?"</p>

  <p>"Well, Master Leyton wants to talk to you," Samuel said with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>Leyton looked down at Marsh and asked proudly, "The Non-combat Zone on the Sunrest Tree was built with the Truth of Goodwill and Malice, right?"</p>

  <p>Marsh's heart sank at his words.</p>

  <p>The Sword Clan didn't know the origin of the Non-combat Zone before. It was not until Harold's and Zheng's appearances that they knew the secret.</p>

  <p>Although Harper had never appeared in the Sword Clan, he had built the Non-combat Zone on the Sunrest Tree, which was considered the natural barrier and also one of the footholds of the Sword Clan. So his role was not underestimated.</p>

  <p>"We don't know what the Truth of Goodwill and Malice is," said Marsh.</p>

  <p>Although he tried to lie, Leyton looked at him as if he really knew the truth.</p>

  <p>Leyton laughed and said, "It's the Truth of Godly Way that Harper cultivates. I have confirmed that he has been hiding under the Sunrest Tree over the years. Please take me to him."</p>

  <p>"It's... It's not appropriate. We the Sword Clan..." Marsh was trying to come up with an excuse to refuse Leyton.</p>

  <p>But Leyton interrupted him. "Harper has trapped us for so many years, and we have to take revenge on him. I am not discussing with you. The Non-combat Zone can block the Holy Beings, but it can't block us. If you don't agree, I will not think twice to eliminate the Sword Clan from the divine land."</p>

  <p>His voice was very calm but intimidating, as if the second largest clan in the divine land was only a small fly in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Marsh gritted his teeth with worry. He had no excuse so he had no choice but to give in to Leyton's threat.</p>

  <p>While the people on the Floating Islands were deterred by the danger, the fairy palace was enjoying a peaceful atmosphere.</p>

  <p>After the trip out of the divine land, Mike was finally relieved.</p>

  <p>He had thought previously about how to fight against the alliance of the powerful clans, but now, he had to think about how to spend the next few years safely.</p>

  <p>"Father, you told Master Timotheus and the others that the Mountain of Holy Beings is about to emerge and I have my mission. What do you mean by this?" Zheng asked intently.</p>

  <p>At that time, what Mike said had totally confused him. He needed clarification.</p>

  <p>Even if he became a Holy Being, his strength wouldn't change significantly.</p>

  <p>After all, their opponents were the Yellow Emperor Guards at the Other Shore Realm who were known for their strength.</p>

  <p>"I don't know either," Mike answered with a smile.</p>

  <p>A strange expression appeared on Zheng's face when he heard his father's answer.</p>

  <p>When Mike saw the confusion on Zheng's face, he continued, "Even your mother doesn't know why your grandfather made this ship. I can only guess it. Do you still remember the maze on the True Path?"</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded quickly.</p>

  <p>The last part of the True Path led Zheng to enter an enormous maze that seemed like no one could ever get out of.</p>

  <p>It took him four long months to leave the maze after countless desperately failed attempts. Since then, the maze was left in his mind magically.</p>

  <p>Saul once told him that the maze was left by the Sacred race and that it was very important. It was copied by his master using his sharp memory. The real maze was many times larger than what Zheng entered.</p>

  <p>He had been in the divine land for so long but had never heard of the maze here.</p>

  <p>Now that his father mentioned the Mountain of Holy Beings and the maze at the same time, Zheng was thrilled. His eyes lit up as he asked, "Father, do you mean that the maze is in the Mountain of Holy Beings?"</p>

  <p>Mike looked at Zheng with appreciation and nodded. "Yes, it took your master a lot of effort to copy it."</p>
