<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng wasn't that familiar on how to make use of his new obtained magic vision. The only thing he noticed was that his eyes had gotten rejuvenated the second the sap went into his eyes.</p>

  <p>The moment it finally came to an end, he proceeded to open his eyes. But there was so little change in him, making it feel almost unnoticeable.</p>

  <p>"The reward I receive is just getting my eyes cleansed?" Luo Luo Zheng was in a state of confusion.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha, you may not realize it right now, but this is such a really good reward. From now on, you'll be able to see through most kinds of illusions using your keen eyesight. I can assure you that it's going to be quite useful!</p>

  <p>At the very least, it's still much, much better compared to simply receiving another five hundred years of lifespan," the cyan dragon flatly remarked.</p>

  <p>'He seriously thinks this is better than getting five hundred years of life?'</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was at such a loss for words.</p>

  <p>Without a doubt, five hundred years of lifespan would indeed be considered as a hefty reward if you asked any of the warriors in the Virtual Tribulation Realm or even the Life and Death Realm.</p>

  <p>However, in the eyes of a being that was in a completely different level just like the cyan dragon, five hundred years passed by so fast, so it wouldn't be something to write home about. Taking that into consideration, the five hundred years of lifespan didn't sound as enticing as the magic vision Luo Luo Zheng had been given.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng's eyes fluttered, the mysterious green light within his pupils faded away little by little, retracting into the depth of his eyes.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng's round had wrapped up, he had already taken the lead, taking the first place for the meantime, ahead of the others with his 66 steps.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie, on the other hand, due to having accursed luck at one point, had currently gotten into second place with 63 steps in total.</p>

  <p>Next to her was the Holy Maiden, representing the divine kingdom, who had taken third place. Fortunately, the curse she sustained had been lifted by Simon, so she would most probably move forward even more in the upcoming round.</p>

  <p>Upon realizing that Luo Luo Zheng had been in the lead, the prince of the divine kingdom looked sullen, the killing intent he was emitting spilling all over the place. He had his eyes set on Luo Luo Zheng, which were as sharp as that of a mighty eagle. Through this, his handsome face looked a bit too serious.</p>

  <p>At that point in time, the yellow light had befallen him once more.</p>

  <p>Disdainfully, the prince heaved a heavy sigh and plunged his fist into the air. This movement struck the dice and caused it to shift around until coming to a stop and showing the number one.</p>

  <p>As anyone might have expected, given that he only got one step during his turn, the prince from the divine kingdom was fuming with intense rage. But upon seeing the disk which appeared in front of him, his eyebrows which were deeply knit, frantically quivered due to all of the anticipation flowing unto him.</p>

  <p>"Red!" he yelled out, stepping over the disk at once.</p>

  <p>Simon had gotten a hold of a red disk once before, earning the entitlement to issue a free challenge. The prince of the divine kingdom had been biding his time for an opportunity like this since then. Now that the moment finally arrived, he had a hard time believing that it had finally come.</p>

  <p>"Free challenge..."</p>

  <p>"Hahahaha!" The divine kingdom prince had his gaze fixated on Luo Luo Zheng as he started laughing maniacally, getting so full of himself.</p>

  <p>The divine kingdom's Holy Maiden then snapped, "That's enough, stop that needless laughing. Just go ahead and put an end to him already."</p>

  <p>"As you please, I'm going to do it right this instant!" the prince of the divine kingdom let out a deep sigh as he went ahead and pointed his finger at Luo Luo Zheng from a distance, "I would like to challenge this? puny ant."</p>

  <p>Watching all of this, Brent pursed his lips in utter disappointment. Truth be told, he was also quite eager to get the right to issue a free challenge.</p>

  <p>During the Martial Arts Contest, as soon as Luo Luo Zheng had withdrawn from the competition, Brent instantly forfeited the opportunity to challenge him. And at the end of all of that, Brent, by default, became the overall winner and received the Dragon Soar Arena. However, something like that couldn't be considered as a reward in itself...</p>

  <p>What use would the Dragon Soar Arena be if it wouldn't be able to bring him into the Upper World anyway? If it were only possible, he most probably would've given up the Dragon Soar Arena just to get a chance to finally go head-to-head against Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>All things considered, Brent had actually been blessed with good fortune.</p>

  <p>Everything had been going quite well for him. He hadn't come across a single reward or punishment, and he acquired six dots each time. By this point, he had already amassed close to thirty steps.</p>

  <p>"But I would love to get a free challenge as well..." Brent remarked, feeling a bit downhearted.</p>

  <p>That being said, Brent had absolutely no idea that though he possessed such an exceptional body as well as a divine-level talent, he wouldn't stand a chance against Luo Luo Zheng at all in this celestial tomb. There was a good chance he would've lost to Luo Luo Zheng if they fought it out in the very first round.</p>

  <p>At the time when Brent was participating in the Martial Arts Contest, he was still at the ultimate level of the Illuminating Soul Realm. But during these past months, he had improved quite a bit and got into the preliminary stage of the Internal Elixir Realm. In spite of that, inside the Mist's celestial tomb, his otherwise remarkable cultivation was being kept in check by a realm.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, on the other hand, was in a totally different position. With the aid of the token he got from the Immortal Mansion, the level of his own cultivation had not been affected in any way. Apart from that, with his current cultivation at the seventh level of the Illuminating Soul Realm, Luo Luo Zheng was already much capable of standing up against a warrior at the late stage of the Internal Elixir Realm. As Brent's cultivation base had gotten suppressed within Mist's celestial tomb, Luo Luo Zheng would end up being quite a formidable opponent if he somehow managed to make it through the first round against him.</p>

  <p>The minute Luo Luo Zheng found out that the prince of the divine kingdom intended to issue a challenge to him, a flash of green light suddenly glimmered in his eyes. An air of self-confidence had been embedded into his eyes. Other than that, one wouldn't really see much of a reaction on his face. In fact, he seemed rather calm.</p>

  <p>In regards to the other warriors, it could be said that they didn't have much faith in Luo Zheng's future.</p>

  <p>"If a master of the Virtual Tribulation Realm is to be interested in doing away with a warrior in the Illuminating Soul Realm, wouldn't that be just child's play? It would be something as simple as crushing an ant!"</p>

  <p>"That's not necessarily true. Luo Luo Zheng had the ability to battle a warrior from the Internal Elixir Realm while he was still just at the fourth level of Illuminating Soul Realm. You have to remember that right now, he has already reached the seventh level of the Illuminating Soul Realm..."</p>

  <p>"Does any of that matter? I guess it's safe to say that he has enough strength to lay waste to a warrior at the premium stage of the Internal Elixir Realm, but does that really mean he could come up to fight against a Virtual Tribulation Realm warrior?"</p>
