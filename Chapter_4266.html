<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Everyone who heard what Tianming said was surprised and confused.</p>

  <p>'The chaos is such a huge world. How is it possible that they couldn't find it?' they all thought at the back of their minds.</p>

  <p>"Why can't you find your way back?"</p>

  <p>"Are you lost?"</p>

  <p>"Be patient and look more carefully."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, Fuxi, and the others were so anxious that they impatiently blurted what they were thinking.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the Snake Goddess interrupted them. "Calm down. Ziya is not a fool, and neither is Geoffrey. They wouldn't have come back to the holy pillar and asked for our help simply because they got lost. They must be in a more difficult situation than we can imagine. Let him talk," she kind of reprimanded everyone present.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing what the Snake Goddess said, the people on the jadeite platform recognized what she meant. They quickly fell silent and stared back at Tianming.</p>

  <p>"They are being pursued by a great number of enemies. Their sheer number is overwhelming that they couldn't defeat them all. Although Geoffrey gained incredible strength, he is now exhausted. They don't know how much longer they would be able to hold on." Tianming reported everything that Ziya told him.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing this, Luo Zheng was suddenly alarmed. "Did he say who were after them?" he asked.</p>

  <p>After a short while, Tianming replied, "A bunch of giants."</p>

  <p>'Giants in the main world?' When Luo Zheng heard this, Pompeo immediately popped into his mind.</p>

  <p>'If several members of the Colossus race are after them, then both of them are in grave danger, ' Luo Zheng thought with a worried expression on his face.</p>

  <p>"What should we do now?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng murmured to himself as he paced back and forth.</p>

  <p>Right now, Ziya and Geoffrey couldn't come back and bring the Heavenly Ring Staff to them. Moreover, they were in a dangerous situation.</p>

  <p>After thinking for a while, Luo Zheng stopped walking. Something lit in his eyes as he turned to the Snake Goddess. "The Eternal Scroll Painting! We can enter the Eternal Divine Courtyard through it. That's the fastest shortcut!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng exclaimed in excitement.</p>

  <p>However, he didn't understand why no one gave a single response.</p>

  <p>In the end, it was the Primeval Lord of Heaven who dared to break the silence. A wisp of his soul floated out of the Civilization Artifact and sighed. "Luo Zheng, the Eternal Scroll Painting is still closed. Furthermore, the Grand Plain Stage was already destroyed by the downgrader," he explained calmly.</p>

  <p>Since the Grand Plain Stage was destroyed, it must also mean that the Eternal Scroll Painting vanished with it too.</p>

  <p>Fuxi kept his head lowered as he furrowed his eyebrows, while the Snake Goddess pursed her lips. They couldn't say anything as they didn't want to be the ones to break it to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Not long ago, Geoffrey had just completed a very risky and difficult mission. However, they didn't expect that things would go south at such a critical point. Now, they were stuck with a problem that they couldn't solve.</p>

  <p>All of their choices were being blocked off. They couldn't get to the Deleting Space or the Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>"Wait! There's still someone who might be able to send me to the Deleting Space," Luo Zheng said abruptly as a thought suddenly occurred to him.</p>

  <p>"Are you thinking of the Evil God?" the Snake Goddess asked with a suspicious look in her eyes. "I don't think he will help you. Besides, did you forget that Ziya closed the Deleting Space? Even Othniel wasn't able to enter it. Although the Evil God learned the space truth, it's still impossible for him to send you to the Deleting Space," she said in low spirits.</p>

  <p>The Deleting Space was under Ziya's total control. Even Chaos Ancient Gods weren't able to do anything with it.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng began pacing back and forth again. The frustration was so visible on his face.</p>

  <p>Even the blue veins on his forehead were totally exposed.</p>

  <p>While everyone was racking their brains for a solution and wallowing in despair, Kincaid chimed in, "There's actually a way to make it to the main world."</p>

  <p>"Really? How?" In the blink of an eye, Luo Zheng appeared in front of Kincaid, eager to know what he was talking about. He was so desperate that he would do anything whatever it might be.</p>

  <p>"There are two paths in the channel that could be found in the Bold Conjecture House. They can come back through one of those roads,"</p>

  <p>Kincaid explained.</p>

  <p>Everyone present looked at him with a displeased expression as soon as he finished speaking. They all wondered why he kept silent all this time if he had the solution all along.</p>

  <p>Kincaid knew exactly what they were thinking. However, he had his own reasons for not bringing it up earlier. "The only problem is who to send.</p>

  <p>Hilario, the human spirits of the Bold Conjecture House, and even I couldn't return to the main world because we will die there. On the other hand, though you can enter the main world, you can't walk freely and see clearly in there," he continued.</p>

  <p>He knew that none of them had experienced the Red Jade Rite, hence they knew so little about the main world.</p>

  <p>"I'll do it," Luo Zheng said calmly. "Even if it weren't for Geoffrey and Master Ziya, I still must bring the Heavenly Ring Staff back at all costs. Right now, I'm the only one who can do that."</p>

  <p>'According to what Master Ziya said, Geoffrey had run out of strength.</p>

  <p>It makes sense since the Heavenly Ring Staff, like the heavy sword, requires a large amount of energy to power it. I must be the only one qualified to wield it since the ancestry-level bloodline would aid me, ' Luo Zheng thought to himself.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure? It's too risky," Kincaid warned him in a stern voice.</p>

  <p>"Everything that we have been doing is a great risk," Luo Zheng quickly retorted.</p>

  <p>"We're also as good as dead if we don't do anything right now."</p>

  <p>Kincaid clearly felt the determination in Luo Zheng's eyes. 'This guy understands all the risks, but he doesn't have the slightest intention of dying, ' Kincaid thought in amazement.</p>

  <p>"All right then. You have to sneak into the Other Shore first?" Kincaid started explaining what he had to do.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had initially planned on entering the Other Shore by reciting the Truth of Godly Way. But upon hearing what Kincaid said, he remembered something and said, "Master Kincaid, please wait a moment. I'll be right back."</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Then, Luo Zheng suddenly vanished into thin air. The next second, he was standing in front of the Civilization Artifact of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization.</p>

  <p>After the Blooming Jade Stage was destroyed, the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization was also destroyed. Because of that, the Civilization Artifact became useless.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng didn't want to give up on it. He thought that it would be such a pity if he lost the unique calculation method of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization.</p>

  <p>Therefore, he asked the ancestry-level bloodline to restore its core.</p>

  <p>Now, there was a massive cube beside the Civilization Artifact. It was created by the ancestry-level bloodline through the power of the creation quadrant. At this point, three beams of light with various colors were outlining different things on the surface of the cube.</p>

  <p>Obviously, the ancestry-level bloodline was much more powerful than the Heavenly Obsession Civilization. With its aid and the will of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization, theoretically, a more powerful core would be built soon.</p>

  <p>When the Heavenly Obsession Civilization caught sight of Luo Zheng, a green figure immediately appeared in front of him.</p>

  <p>"How is it going?" Luo Zheng inquired about the progress.</p>

  <p>"About half done," the green figure informed.</p>

  <p>"Do you think it will work?" Luo Zheng asked, just to make sure.</p>

  <p>The green figure actually didn't know what Luo Zheng was up to, but it still answered, "Yes, it will. But its efficiency might be very low."</p>

  <p>"I see. Well, I'm going to the main world right now. I would need your help after I get there."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng instructed briefly and didn't provide much information since he was in a hurry.</p>

  <p>Before the green figure could react, Luo Zheng already disappeared.</p>

  <p>When he returned to the jadeite platform, Luo Zheng quickly sat down with his legs crossed and looked at Kincaid. "I'm ready."</p>

  <p>Upon entering the Other Shore, they walked into the passageway.</p>

  <p>Hilario immediately spotted the two and was baffled as to why they were there. Reading his mind, Kincaid said, "He wants to go to the main world?"</p>

  <p>"What? Why?" Hilario got even more confused when he heard the reason for their sudden appearance. "What happened?" he couldn't help but ask.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Kincaid filled him in on what had happened in the main world.</p>

  <p>As he explained the unexpected situation, Hilario fell into a deep thought.</p>

  <p>"The passageway does lead to the main world. But before you get there, you will need to pass through the Eternal Scroll Painting and face the brush-wielder," Hilario warned.</p>

  <p>At the mention of the brush-wielder, Luo Zheng's eyebrows quickly raised.</p>

  <p>From the moment that Luo Zheng knew the truth behind Cornelius's scheme and the alter, he realized that the brush-wielder was actually not on their side.</p>

  <p>He was the one who coaxed him into entering the alter in order to acquire the sword.</p>

  <p>Judging from that, Luo Zheng speculated that the brush-wielder was, in fact, someone who worked for the downgrader.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was able to pass through the Eternal Scroll Painting back then. But now, he thought that it might not be that easy since the brush-wielder might get in his way.</p>
