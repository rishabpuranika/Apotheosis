  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Blood-storing Seed was an intricate way to preserve blood.</p>

  <p>There was a tricky conundrum that had arisen with every great clan in the Source World continuing their bloodlines.</p>

  <p>Since the blood was passed down from generation to generation, over time it became diluted.</p>

  <p>For example, Li Luoshui was an esteemed member of the Nine Li race, while Luo Xiao was an outsider. So it was inevitable that their children's blood would be diluted.</p>

  <p>However, this crisis was abridged by the Blood-storing Seed.</p>

  <p>With the Blood-storing Seed, descendants of the clans would be able to ensure the purity of their blood.</p>

  <p>However, there was a class system in play for the Blood-storing Seed. For common people, an ordinary Blood-storing Seed would suffice.</p>

  <p>In the Source World, the One-Pattern and Two-Pattern Blood-storing Seeds were quite commonly and easily acquired, but the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed was more of a rarity and harder to find.</p>

  <p>Therefore, when Emily heard Li Luoshui mention the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed that had been given by the Snake Goddess, her ears instantly perked up. This meant that one of her children had been gifted with the blood of the Snake Goddess race. If the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed had really been made by the Snake Goddess herself, then this child had a chance of possessing the purest blood of the Snake Goddess race.</p>

  <p>Of course, there was no doubt that Luo Zheng and Yan were Li Luoshui and Luo Xiao's children. The Blood-storing Seed carried the blood, which was its special ability.</p>

  <p>"The Blood-storing Seed of our race was used on Luo Zheng, right?" Timotheus asked, staring wide-eyed at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Xiao nodded.</p>

  <p>"Small wonder then that the Blood Stone broke into pieces." Leopold smiled woefully.</p>

  <p>They had tested Luo Zheng's blood strenuously at the Sky Spirit Bone Tower, but they hadn't known its limit. They only knew the imperial-grade bloodline flowed in Luo Zheng's veins. Now it would appear that they had underestimated him.</p>

  <p>"What is the Infinity Ruler?" Timotheus probed Luo Xiao.</p>

  <p>"What is your view on the merging of Divine Dao?" Luo Xiao asked hesitantly.</p>

  <p>"The merging of Divine Dao? You mean the token that Luo Zheng has been cultivating? I don't know who instructed him to cultivate it, but I dare say it will prove a failure." Leopold shook his head disapprovingly.</p>

  <p>Timotheus supported his opinion by saying, "That is a road to nowhere, and it will prove useless."</p>

  <p>The others nodded in agreement. In the Source World, everyone knew this to be a truth.</p>

  <p>Merging the Divine Dao was problematic, if not futile. After most of the True Gods had reached their consummation, they saw no point in wasting time by merging other Divine Dao. Instead, they invested their time in cultivating the Truth of Divine Dao. This was how they attempted to reach the Other Shore as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>"Would it surprise you if it was the Grand Chieftain who instructed my son to cultivate it?" Luo Xiao asked.</p>

  <p>The Nine Li Guards were stunned by his revelation.</p>

  <p>Leopold widened his eyes and said, "Even if it was by the Grand Chieftain's order, he must have been mistaken. He had also previously tried, and he had been forced to admit that he had failed."</p>

  <p>It was no secret that Chiyou had once tried unsuccessfully to merge the Divine Dao, and many Nine Li members knew this.</p>

  <p>"But I think that Chiyou had discovered a way to successfully merge the Divine Dao. I even think that your race is embroiled in this mess because of the merging of Divine Dao. As you just said, the Divine Farmer had no motivation to help the Yellow Emperor, yet despite this, he still helped the Yellow Emperor to defeat the Nine Li race. Perhaps someone opposed the Nine Li race's mastery of merging the Divine Dao. Hence, they asked the Yellow Emperor to join hands with the Divine Farmer. Chiyou never completely mastered the token of merging the Divine Dao, so he built the divine land and gave the two seeds and the Infinity Ruler to Li Luoshui," Luo Xiao related his guess.</p>

  <p>"The Infinity Ruler..."</p>

  <p>"The Infinity Ruler contains three thousand scales. Each scale represents a Divine Dao, making it a convenient way for Luo Zheng to merge the Divine Dao," explained Luo Xiao.</p>

  <p>"But surely that's just speculation," whispered Ramzi in awe.</p>

  <p>With a faint smile hovering on his face, Luo Xiao said, "Such speculation offers a direction, but we still have to prove it. Isn't that right?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, quite right," Emily confirmed. "If I were Chiyou and really had the means to recreate the Divine Dao Great Unity, I would also take the risk and might even ask the Snake Goddess to join me. But where is this person who has the other Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed now? May I see that person?"</p>

  <p>Yan was Luo Xiao and Li Luoshui's daughter. She had never had anything to do with the Snake Goddess race.</p>

  <p>However, since Yan had inherited the Blood-storing Seed that had been personally made by the Snake Goddess, her blood was also an unusual anomaly in the Snake Goddess race, so Emily felt that to be of great importance to her.</p>

  <p>"Yan is still in the divine land," said Li Luoshui.</p>

  <p>Emily nodded, her mind running off with different ideas, and she fell silent as she brooded.</p>

  <p>"Do you think my father's assumption will prove correct?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, who had kept silent throughout this discussion, suddenly asked No. 9527 in the vaults of his mind.</p>

  <p>When he had been outside the divine land, he had heard them mention many times that it was untenable for one to merge the Divine Dao, and the Great Unity would never be rebuilt, ever. No. 9527, Timotheus, and Fuxi had all said the same.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng still had the notion of leaving things to chance. After all, this was the gift that his father gave him. What if he succeeded?</p>

  <p>"It's not correct," answered No. 9527, immediately denying Luo Xiao's assumption. "It is a certainty that the Great Unity has only existed once ever since the chaos formed. If Chiyou could really rebuild the Great Unity, it would mean that the truths could be acquired through learning, which is simply impossible."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng pursed his lips and said, "What are the odds? Isn't there even a one-inten-thousand possibility?"</p>

  <p>"Forget it. It's virtually impossible," No. 9527 replied, snorting derisively.</p>

  <p>"Fine." Luo Zheng shrugged indifferently.</p>

  <p>He still wasn't planning on giving up, despite No. 9527's conclusion.</p>

  <p>He was determined to fill the three thousand scales marked on the Infinity Ruler.</p>

  <p>Of course, no one was aware that Luo Zheng was talking with No. 9527. After hearing Emily's response, Timotheus and the others found it difficult to further doubt things. After all, Luo Xiao's assumption sounded somewhat reasonable.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng once mentioned those Yellow Emperor Guards. What are they like now?" Timotheus asked.</p>

  <p>The Nine Li Guards never busied themselves with the bizarre idea of Grand Chieftain. But they were concerned about the real threat. The Yellow Emperor Guards were potentially the biggest challenge in the divine land.</p>

  <p>"Someone has taken control of the Abyss Demon Region. It won't be long before they break through the Mixed Element Seal," Li Luoshui reported.</p>

  <p>Timotheus' eyes flashed as he offered, "In that case, you must stay outside the divine land, and we'll protect you."</p>

  <p>Emily agreed, "Right. Since you can't oppose the powerhouses at the Other Shore Realm, you can place your family members in a small world and bring them here. You can return once we are able to enter the divine land."</p>

  <p>She longed to verify Yan's blood. Although she was in the dark about what the Snake Goddess thought, she felt obliged to verify it since Yan possessed their race's blood. Besides, she was willing to stay here because of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid that will not be possible," Luo Xiao said, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" Timotheus asked, frowning. He felt this was the safest means available to them.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng has a mission of his own now. The Mountain of Holy Beings is about to emerge," Luo Xiao explained.</p>
