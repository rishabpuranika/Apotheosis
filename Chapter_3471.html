  <h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3471 I Am The Reason </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>After Sally successfully completed the fusion with the crystals of the Chaotic Source Spirits, the array shook drastically and space began to fluctuate.</p>

  <p>The array had sensed that Sally had reached the Chaotic Source Realm and then it opened the space channel.</p>

  <p>Carefully, Sally got up and took a step into the space channel. Suddenly, from the array, a ray of light shot into the sky and she was teleported out of the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>Afterwards, it was her brother's turn to do so.</p>

  <p>In another array, Zheng sat cross legged with his eyes closed. He had entered a meditative state.</p>

  <p>He didn't immediately merge with the crystals of the Chaotic Source Spirits even if he had the chance to. He knew that the battle between him and the Evil God was far from over.</p>

  <p>Phew!</p>

  <p>Gradually, an avatar formed in his inner world.</p>

  <p>After the avatar was formed, the Regal Jade Spirit and No. 9527 also transformed into humans, appearing on his two sides.</p>

  <p>"Let's go."</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng finished speaking, they leaped up and disappeared into the sky.</p>

  <p>Somewhere in his inner world, inside a mountain, sweet chimes echoed from the stream of clear water that went through a large cave.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Evil God lay in the center of the cave with golden ropes restraining him from any form of movement.</p>

  <p>He kept his eyes and mouth shut, seemingly indifferent to the situation.</p>

  <p>When he heard Zheng and the other two enter the cave, the Evil God opened his eyes, the corners of his mouth curved upward into a small smile. It was an arrogant move, as if he was mocking Zheng, but it was actually more like a self-mocking smile.</p>

  <p>Zheng took a good look at the Evil God and lifted his arm to point a finger at him.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Just like that, the golden ropes on the Evil God broke, freeing him.</p>

  <p>As soon as the Evil God was released, he turned to Zheng with a look of vengeance in his eyes. His body, which was once stiff, rushed towards Zheng in a hurry. He flipped his hand and a black dragon-patterned broken blade appeared in his hand!</p>

  <p>Phew!</p>

  <p>Zheng was shocked to see the black dragon-patterned broken blade in his hand, especially because it was a rare treasure. He ran and aimed directly towards Zheng's chest.</p>

  <p>Zheng's avatar was stabbed, and his body twitched upon the impact.</p>

  <p>Afterwards, his whole body became charred to a crisp, falling to the ground without any resistance.</p>

  <p>However, the Regal Jade Spirit and No. 9527 watching the avatar remained calm and collected. Their expressions did not change, despite seeing the avatar was destroyed.</p>

  <p>After all, it was merely an avatar. There was no way Evil God could kill Zheng in his own inner world.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>Not far away, a spark of brown aura condensed, and Zheng's body took shape once again.</p>

  <p>Seeing Zheng's avatar reform, the Evil God did not hesitate to rush and kill Zheng again.</p>

  <p>This went on for a few times, with Zheng's avatar reconstructing and the Evil God attempting to kill it for good.</p>

  <p>After over a dozen times of this cycle, the Evil God was eventually out of breath. He stared at Zheng with his dark eyes, thirsty for his death.</p>

  <p>"Devour me now!" the Evil God said in arrogance. "I'm from this world, and I'm supposed to be a part of this world after all."</p>

  <p>In his life, he'd never known the meaning of surrendering. That was never going to be the case.</p>

  <p>Zheng stared at him without any pity. "You belong to this world. And even though it makes sense for me to devour you and I did have such plan to do so before, I have changed my mind."</p>

  <p>Hearing Zheng's words, the Evil God was surprised with Zheng's change of decision. "What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>Zheng waved his hand lightly. Without any space fluctuation, a beautiful, dignified woman appeared in the center of the cave.</p>

  <p>She wore a long, light white dress, looking as pure as a dove.</p>

  <p>She looked around, confused about why she was in a cave. Just then, her eyes met with the Evil God in the cave, and she was overjoyed. "Darling!</p>

  <p>You're back? You're really back!"</p>

  <p>She threw her arms around the Evil God, bouncing in celebration.</p>

  <p>"Edna..." The Evil God's eyes widened as he wrapped his arms around her petite frame.</p>

  <p>Before the Evil God left Zheng's inner world, he knew that he'd break ties with Zheng.</p>

  <p>In Zheng's inner world, the only person he was concerned about was Edna.</p>

  <p>Before parting with her in the past, he never got to say goodbye. In that moment, he thought that he would never see her again.</p>

  <p>However, circumstances changed with the passage of time and he never expected that he would come back here again. Apparently Edna had been waiting for him to come back all the time.</p>

  <p>Just as Edna was enjoying this moment of celebration, she suddenly felt a chill in her chest. She parted with him and saw the source of pain - it was the black dragon-patterned broken blade piercing into her chest.</p>

  <p>Her expression changed instantly and she looked at her husband with disbelief. "Darling, why... Why would you kill me?"</p>

  <p>The Evil God took Edna's face in his hands, and caressed her across her temples with a tenderness in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"I will go with you soon, my love." He then turned to Zheng after he finished speaking. "If you want to kill me, please do it quickly," he signed. "You're just wasting time."</p>

  <p>The Evil God had thought that death would square all the accounts and there was nothing to fear. But seeing Edna after so long had confused him, almost convincing him to live longer than he had planned.</p>

  <p>For this reason, the Evil God hated himself for being so easily swayed, so he nipped his feeling at the bud and ended the life of Edna himself. He acted rashly, and his voice became cold and indifferent.</p>

  <p>"Darling, why would the Creator ever kill you? Did you do anything wrong?" Edna asked, whilst still enduring the pain going through her chest.</p>

  <p>Even if she was at the edge of her life, she still worried for him the most.</p>

  <p>She had no clue what the outside world was like, and what had happened there.</p>

  <p>All she knew was that her husband returned after exploring the outside world, and she wanted to hear all of his stories from his adventures.</p>

  <p>The last thing she expected was to get stabbed in the chest.</p>

  <p>As the Evil God heard her words so painfully exit her lips, his heart quivered slightly.</p>

  <p id="top_8">'Those who are on the losing end, are always in the wrong, ' he thought If he had won, Zheng's inner world would be in his possession. He'd be able to stand freely at the peak, with Edna in his arms, looking down at all the living beings. But that was not the case now. He was only a loser, who could only curl up in the cold cave and die with the woman he had loved.</p>

  <p>"I didn't do anything wrong," the Evil God said slowly. "I just lost.</p>

  <p>I lost to the Creator..."</p>

  <p>Edna looked at him and instantly knew what had happened.</p>

  <p>She knew very well about her husband's ambition and goals. He did mention a few times that if there was someone he wanted to defeat the most, it would be the Creator.</p>

  <p>When she heard the Evil God mention it for the first time, she covered his mouth and warned him never to mention it again.</p>

  <p>The Creator was omnipotent and he knew everything that occurred in his inner world. How could the Evil God possibly defeat him?</p>

  <p>But despite knowing all of this, the Evil God was stubborn to achieve his ambition. Edna could only obey him and help him carry out the plans to kill the Creator. In the end, he had failed and lost to the Creator.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the Creator was so magnanimous that he forgave the Evil God without any hesitation.</p>

  <p>Edna tried hard to put the pieces together. Did that mean her husband attacked the Creator again after he left the inner world? If that was true, then by no means would the Creator forgive him this time, she thought.</p>

  <p>If it were any other woman, she probably would have begged Zheng to spare her husband's life. Edna didn't do any of that. All she could think was her love for him. If her husband was punished to death, she would die with him, too.</p>

  <p>"I've said that I've changed my mind, remember?" Zheng repeated. "I won't kill you. After all, your leaving was also good for my inner world. I am the reason for all of this, after all."</p>
