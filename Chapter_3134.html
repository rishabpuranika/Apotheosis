<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>When Zheng emerged from the Dragon Path, a gate appeared before him.</p>

  <p>Zheng stopped in his tracks, stunned at the sight of the gate.</p>

  <p>The gate was formed from two pieces of weathered dead wood standing upright a few feet away from each other, with a cracked board above them.</p>

  <p>Lack of maintenance over the years had caused all the inscriptions on the board to disappear. The board just hung there, nothing on it.</p>

  <p>Who would have thought that the famous Oneness Sky Palace had a gate that was in such a dilapidated condition?</p>

  <p>Zheng passed through the gate and continued walking. The road forked in three paths ahead of him.</p>

  <p>These three paths were paved with stone bricks, each with a different variety.</p>

  <p>The path on the left was paved with thick, wide, cyan stone bricks engraved with landscape paintings. It looked grand and majestic.</p>

  <p>The path on the right was paved with black stone bricks. He had no idea what the stone bricks were made of, but they looked solid and gave off the aura of history and eternity.</p>

  <p>The path in the middle was paved with small red stones. They were light and dynamic, giving off a sharp aura.</p>

  <p>Looking at the paths in front of him, Zheng hesitated.</p>

  <p>Hadn't they said that someone would be here to receive him when he came up here? Why hadn't he seen anyone?</p>

  <p>Zheng looked at the three paths again as he thought. The answer came to him soon enough.</p>

  <p>The test wasn't over.</p>

  <p>He had to make a choice, and there was no hint.</p>

  <p>Zheng made a decision after a while. He chose the path with the red bricks.</p>

  <p>He took a step in that path and then began to climb up the stairs, accelerating as he climbed.</p>

  <p>He walked along the road for more than twenty miles, and then came to a ridge. He passed it, and came across a board.</p>

  <p>The board was inscribed with the words, "Flow Sword Sect".</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyebrows went up when he saw the board.</p>

  <p>He had made the right choice by following his heart.</p>

  <p>After his fight with Fergus, Zheng had also become interested in the Flow Sword Sect.</p>

  <p>There were a few similarities between the Flow Strike and the Emotion Closing Godly Way that he had cultivated. This was a path that was suitable for him.</p>

  <p>He stood under the board for a while. He then saw two women in white saunter over to him from the other side of the board.</p>

  <p>One of them folded her hands towards Zheng in respect and said, "Sir, are you Mr. Luo?  Zheng Luo?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am," Zheng said, nodding.</p>

  <p>"You can come with us if you choose to join the Flow Sword Sect. But I have to remind you that you still have the chance to give this path up and go back to choose from the other two paths," one of the women said.</p>

  <p>"Where do the other two paths lead to?"</p>

  <p>"The one on the left leads to the Killing Sword Sect, and the one on the right leads to the Unique Array Sword Sect," she answered.</p>

  <p>The three paths were merely options for the warriors who went up the mountain to choose freely. If they really didn't like the ones they had chosen, they could go back and choose again.</p>

  <p>But they could choose only once. Once they entered any of the sects, they couldn't join other sword sects unless they left the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>"Are there any differences between the three sword sects?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>It was not the first time that the woman in white had faced this question.</p>

  <p>She smiled as she answered him, "The Killing Sword Sect mainly focuses on cultivating the killing way. It pursues the strongest means to hurt the enemy, so as to kill them as quickly as possible. Unique Array Sword Sect, according to its name, mainly focuses on cultivating sword arrays."</p>

  <p>"What about the Flow Sword Sect?" Zheng asked again.</p>

  <p>"Follow your heart and go with the flow," the woman replied succinctly.</p>

  <p>Zheng had dabbled in both the sword arrays and the killing way before. At the woman's answer, he went through the gate unhesitatingly.</p>

  <p>The two women in white led the way. Rows of trees lined the road on both sides. The surroundings were quiet and there was not a single person around.</p>

  <p>"It looks like there aren't many people in the Flow Sword Sect," Zheng said.</p>

  <p>"No. There are actually a lot of people, but everyone is focused on cultivation. You certainly won't be seeing them soon," one of the women replied.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded and quietly followed the two women.</p>

  <p>The boulevard was ten miles long. When they came to the end of the boulevard, a number of beautifully-shaped buildings appeared before them.</p>

  <p>Rows and rows of buildings were lined up, densely packed against each other and forming an exquisite small city.</p>

  <p>It looked like there were indeed many people in the Flow Sword Sect.</p>

  <p>About six feet separated each building from the next. The two women led Zheng through narrow alleys, and Zheng saw several other women in white along the way. They had pretty looks, and their clothes were plain and neat.</p>

  <p>But Zheng was curious about why there was no one else besides these women.</p>

  <p>When they stopped in front of a building, one of the women turned and bowed to Zheng as she said, "Mr. Luo, we have arrived,"</p>

  <p>"Here?" Zheng was a little surprised.</p>

  <p>"This place is for you," the woman said.</p>

  <p>Curious, Zheng pushed open the door of the building.</p>

  <p>There was a long table in the yard, on which were neatly folded white clothes, a sword, a token, and even shoes and hats.</p>

  <p>Zheng glanced at the token and saw his name engraved on it. He smiled and said, "The Flow Sword Sect has prepared everything for me. That's considerate, but what would have happened if I hadn't chosen it? Wouldn't all these go to waste?"</p>

  <p>"You have the liberty to make your own decisions," the woman said with a smile.</p>

  <p>Zheng looked carefully at the long table and found that there were two space rings on it. He picked up one of the space rings and examined it, only to find that it contained a million divine crystals within it.</p>

  <p>He then picked up the other space ring and found that there were ten golden square cards within it. He took out a card and asked, "What is this?"</p>

  <p>"The entry token to the Flow Tower. Two hours in the Flow Tower costs an entry token. They are very rare in the sect, so please take care of them," the woman said.</p>

  <p>The long sword on the table was ranked decently high. It was an intermediate Profound Blood Treasure. There were a million divine crystals in one of the space rings, but the two women seemed to be indifferent to it all, not even bothering to explain everything to him.</p>

  <p>They had only explained the entry tokens, making it look like they were very important.</p>

  <p>"The Flow Sword Sect is so generous. Do all the disciples who join the sect receive such treatment?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>The woman smiled. "Those who can successfully go up the mountain are considered members of our Oneness Sky Palace. This treatment is only a small gift."</p>

  <p>Zheng sighed as he looked out upon the exquisite courtyard.</p>

  <p>There was a stark difference in how he was treated here and how he was treated at the foot of the mountain.</p>

  <p>In the Dragon City, both the Flag Masters and the Alliance Chiefs didn't even have a cave, let alone a building like this. Each of them only had a flag and everyone just lived and cultivated in the open air. The living conditions were poor.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Luo, you must be tired, having climbed all the way here. I'll help you take a bath and change your clothes," the woman said and walked to the side of the building.</p>

  <p>The other woman went to gather up the clothes, shoes, and hats from the table.</p>

  <p>Zheng was stunned. He looked at the two women curiously and asked, "You don't need to do these things, do you?"</p>

  <p>The woman said, "You have now entered the house, and you are the master of this place. We are your maids. So of course we will serve you."</p>
