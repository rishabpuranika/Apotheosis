<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1911 Tianming's Choice </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Once Carney had led Tianming into the tent, the prophet of the Kaleidoscope race waved his hand. "You may leave now."</p>

  <p>With attitude, Carney smiled and said, "I'm curious to know what you want to talk about. Mind if I stay and listen?"</p>

  <p>The prophet frowned and waved his hand a second time. A formless energy immediately sent Carney and the others with him out of the tent.</p>

  <p>The energy was irresistible.</p>

  <p>That matter taken care of, the tent's curtain was drawn down and all auras were isolated.</p>

  <p>Indignation was the only expression plastered on the faces of Carney and the core members of the Kaleidoscope race.</p>

  <p>"Humph! This old man has no good intentions toward our Kaleidoscope race," said one of the warriors who had been pushed out of the tent.</p>

  <p>A helpless look appeared on Carney's face. "There's nothing I can do. It's exactly what the warriors from the divine land told us. We, the native warriors of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, are unable to pursue the Divine Dao or leave the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. The Skyland race, the Collapsing Mountain race and the Harmony race still haven't given up, though. They don't know that their efforts would go in vain!"</p>

  <p>The six races often received warriors from the divine land. They weren't fools. They always had their means of obtaining information from such warriors.</p>

  <p>In fact, the leaders of the six races were well aware of their conditions.</p>

  <p>The prophets of the six races not only had a mysterious background, and they had never considered their respective races.</p>

  <p>However, the prophets of the other five races and their respective races had not yet fallen out. Carney of the Kaleidoscope race, on the other hand, had already fought with the prophet of their race on several occasions.</p>

  <p>Carney and the race members' conversation was heard by Tianming and the prophet, who were still inside the tent.</p>

  <p>Tianming's curiosity kept increasing with reason. Although he didn't know what kind of conflict was going on between Carney and the prophet, but he sure as hell wanted to find out.</p>

  <p>Upon noticing Tianming's expression, the prophet decided he'd be the first to speak. "Alas! These little fellows are getting harder and harder to manage. They always want the truth, but they don't know that only those who are kept from such raw bitterness can lead a happy life."</p>

  <p>Tianming shook his head, disagreeing with the prophet's words.</p>

  <p>"Ultimately, one must have at least a few goals in their life."</p>

  <p>The people of the six races didn't have any natural enemies in this Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, and there were no conflicts or wars among them. They didn't have the pressure of needing to fight for their survival.</p>

  <p>But still, they had their own goals.</p>

  <p>"But for the sake of building the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, I didn't create an exit for them to possible leave this place," a faint voice suddenly chipped in.</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, a third person appeared inside the tent.</p>

  <p>The individual was dressed in black embroidered clothes, and his figure was neither fat nor thin. One thing for certain, his Mu Ning was extremely strange.</p>

  <p>With Tianming's keen senses, he could usually sense the flow of any presence in the surroundings. If this person had entered the tent through spatial transference, then typically speaking, he'd be capable of sensing the remnant Space Law.</p>

  <p>And then again, if this individual was skilled in the Space Law, then he was probably equally skilled at eliminating its remnants.</p>

  <p>However, even if he was capable of eliminating the remnant Space Law, the sudden appearance of another person in the tent should have been like throwing a stone into a cup of water? the water in the cup would definitely be pushed out by the stone and flow in all directions.</p>

  <p>If the Mu Ning already in the tent was suddenly being pressured by someone else, its Mu Ning would definitely have surged in all directions.</p>

  <p>And yet, the instance this person appeared, there was not a single movement or change in the tent's Mu Ning. It was if this third person had been standing there all along.</p>

  <p>The method used had to be quite brilliant. Even at his very best, Tianming had no idea what technique had been used for this to occur.</p>

  <p>"Well, then. Who are you?" asked Tianming, staring at the man.</p>

  <p>The person quickly smiled and said, "I am the owner of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land."</p>

  <p>"Holy Jay!" Tianming's gaze flickered with excitement.</p>

  <p>No wonder...</p>

  <p>As the creator of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, Holy Jay could naturally move about as he wished without even needing to use the Space Law. This was because Holy Jay himself had created the said space. This land functioned and revolved around his will; he could thus replace a portion of pure air inside the tent with his body directly.</p>

  <p>Tianming came to such a quick conclusion because his mind was extremely sharp and he was very intelligent.</p>

  <p>Holy Jay nodded, and then waved his hand briskly at the prophet. The prophet's eyes immediately lost their luster and he slowly walked outside, like a puppet.</p>

  <p>The prophets of the six races were very different from ordinary beings.</p>

  <p>It was possible to consider that the people from the six great races had grown up on their own, possessing their own consciousness and souls.</p>

  <p>However, these six prophets were created by Holy Jay himself, and their souls and consciousness were also given to them by Holy Jay. In other words, these six prophets could just as easily be seen as his six incarnations.</p>

  <p>This explained why the prophets of the races were unimaginably strong.</p>

  <p>In addition, they held a very important position within their respective races.</p>

  <p>Holy Jay stared at Tianming and said in an indifferent tone, "Pull out your sword."</p>

  <p>Not a hint of hesitation had the time to appear on Tianming's face before the Soaring Snake Sword on his back was in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Bromley gave you the treasure trove of the Lord of Weapons. You could possibly be taken into consideration as our backup plan. I want to see how far you've come. Attack me!" Holy Jay ordered.</p>

  <p>Tianming's eyes suddenly flashed. Streams of bright light began pouring out from within the Soaring Snake Sword. The surging sword intent spread out and continuously pulsed within the small tent.</p>

  <p>Although the tent seemed to be made of canvas, the surging sword intent was surprisingly not able to tear it into shreds.</p>

  <p>After quite a few seconds, Tianming's sword abruptly came to a halt as a surge of internal momentum gushed forth from it, piercing toward his opponent.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>Holy Jay didn't even budge. The tip of the Soaring Snake Sword instantly entered his body.</p>

  <p>The tip of the sword easily sliced through Holy Jay's skin, and the sword intent began spreading all over his body. Tianming wasn't worried about Holy Jay's safety at all. Ultimately, he was only facing Holy Jay's avatar.</p>

  <p>What a joke it would be if the avatar of a Holy Being could be injured by a Spirit Supreme Realm warrior!</p>

  <p>The sword only managed to pierce a distance of less than an inch. The sharp weapon couldn't advance any further.</p>

  <p>Holy Jay shook his head. "Not enough. Your comprehension of the Beginning Swordsmanship isn't enough."</p>

  <p>Tianming wasn't surprised to receive such an evaluation. "Please, enlighten me, Holy Jay."</p>

  <p>Holy Jay stared at his heroic gaze and said, "I'm going to teach you the conviction that death is inevitable. Can you accept this? Because if you can't, I can and will give up on you. With your cultivation, talent, and strength, you will be capable of living a very good life in the divine land."</p>

  <p>Although Tianming was extremely outstanding, the three Holy Beings still had other potential candidates.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I can!" Tianming answered firmly.</p>

  <p>Ever since he inherited the treasure trove of the Lord of Weapons, Tianming had finally understood his mission.</p>

  <p>"Why?" Holy Jay asked again. From his point of view, Tianming's attitude was very important. If this person was really afraid of death, then one of the key factors of their plan would be lost!</p>

  <p>At this question, Tianming couldn't help but smile. "Do you know what I was thinking when I found out about the limitless lifespan of a True God?"</p>

  <p>"What?" Holy Jay asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"A limitless lifespan is probably the biggest punishment for a True God,"</p>

  <p>Tianming said, as he looked directly at Holy Jay.</p>

  <p>Everyone's pursuit of life was different. Certain mortals pursued the taste of meat three times a day. Some martial artists pursued the recognition of their sects, and other mighty warriors pursued the path of increasing strength.</p>

  <p>Before Tianming understood the meaning of his own existence, a limitless lifespan was indeed what he wanted.</p>

  <p>Everything shifted after he entered the treasure trove of the Lord of Weapons. His entire mindset underwent a drastic change.</p>

  <p>He had obtained a little information that was rather difficult to imagine.</p>

  <p>Through this information though, he had seen the entire divine land.</p>

  <p>The divine land was a highly civilized world, filled with many rules that had to be respected. Immortality was an illusory pursuit of the creatures of all universes, but it was not difficult to achieve in the divine land? at least not for Tianming.</p>

  <p>He had wanted to reach the peak of the world of martial arts, but after seeing things from a different eye, he could only sigh to himself. The peak of the world of martial arts was no longer attractive to him. Now that the veil of mystery had been lifted in front of him, the scenery it was hiding simply didn't attract him.</p>

  <p>On the other hand though, he had developed a strong interest for the plans left behind by Holy Bromley.</p>

  <p>It was as if the plan had been tailor-made for him!</p>

  <p>He knew that when the plan was enacted, it would be the moment of his death. However, he had agreed to it in a near instant, without a trace of hesitation.</p>

  <p>Not only for Luo Luo Zheng, but equally for himself.</p>

  <p>"I like your answer," said Holy Jay. "Having the ability to live for so long is indeed quite boring! Throughout your trip in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, I will do everything I can to increase your strength."</p>

  <p>The current situation in the Divine Land was rather complicated, and Holy Jay didn't want to talk about such things here.</p>

  <p>"What about Luo Luo Zheng?" Tianming asked.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng?" Holy Jay gave him a faint smile. "The blacksmith and crafting furnace have been prepared. He has just entered, and his body will be thoroughly refined soon."</p>

  <p>Chapman, Kaydan and Tilton were all in a good mood. This trip to the interior world was rather unlucky at the beginning, as they'd encountered so many Formless Sky Pythons that started chasing them. However, they never expected that their misfortune would suddenly take a turn for the better. They quickly arrived at their destination.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately though, they didn't know that this place was merely a crafting furnace meticulously prepared for Luo Luo Zheng by Holy Jay. Here, he planned to carry out one of the most complete body refining exercises ever.</p>
