<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"What's that?"</p>

  <p>"Tell me. Is it possible that an immortal is coming down from the sky?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, probably! The Dragon Soar Arena is conjoined to the Upper World. Who knows? We can most probably even see an immortal!"</p>

  <p>The onlookers discussed among each other but failed to notice what was happening around them.</p>

  <p>Even though they were oblivious, the warriors who stood guard for a while, knew what was going on.</p>

  <p>The guards knew that somebody had returned from the Upper World. It was most probably the nature creature who had flown away from the Dragon Soar Arena a few months ago.</p>

  <p>After moving the Dragon Soar Arena to the Oracle City, the main sects had all tested it. They even ordered the warriors to pass the six layers and commenced the transmission array with a dragon-shaped jade pendant.</p>

  <p>Regardless of their efforts, however, all of them failed to be transmitted in this particular way.</p>

  <p>The moment the white light appeared, the warrior that was supposed to fly to the Upper World was thrown out of the Dragon Soar Arena.</p>

  <p>The nature creature was allowed to be transmitted to the Upper World.</p>

  <p>However, after he'd made his way to the Upper World, no one else was permitted to follow him. It was no doubt that there had indeed been something unusual happening to the nature creature as no one was able to follow him.</p>

  <p>To discover the reason, several runic experts had entered the top part of the Dragon Soar Arena. Their studies concluded that there was something wrong with the runes in the transmission array.</p>

  <p>The runic experts in the Central Region, of course, were not allowed to know about the divine texture. Even though they comprised the idea that the reason why other warriors could not be successfully sent to the Upper World was due to the runes, they failed to figure out what the actual problem was. As they were unaware of the divine texture, there was nothing they could do about it.</p>

  <p>For this given reason solely, the young master and the leader of the Xue Clan were both taken to the Oracle City for questioning.</p>

  <p>Thinking about the nature creature the young master had encountered that day, he told them his looks, age, cultivation situation and any other possible feature he could think of.</p>

  <p>There were, however, far too many nature creatures living in the Central Region. With the limited information about him, it seemed next to impossible to know who it was. So, the truth remained unknown to all of the warriors.</p>

  <p>That was the reason why each sect had sent their warriors to watch over the Dragon Soar Arena. Their primary concern was to observe it and discover exactly how the Dragon Soar Arena could work by learning from the nature creature.</p>

  <p>The warrior sent by the Cloud Hall was considered to be one of the strongest elite disciples of the Elite House, Fred Li, who had reached the consummation level of the Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>Discovering and looking at the white light, Fred started to move. He proceeded by stepping on the ground with a pair of simple shoes and then rushed to the gate of the Dragon Soar Arena.</p>

  <p>This nature creature turned out to be the key to the Dragon Soar Arena!</p>

  <p>A Dragon Soar Arena where warriors could not be transmitted to the Upper World was only one place for the warriors to cultivate themselves.</p>

  <p>So, it was the nature creature who made the arena still valuable.</p>

  <p>The Dragon Soar Arena was an adequate cultivating place. However, if it wasn't able to connect the Upper World, it would not have any relevance for the sects to fight over.</p>

  <p>Fred was the first to stand guard at the gate of the Dragon Soar Arena, followed by the other warriors. Most of the warriors were at the completion of the Illuminating Soul Realm and the strongest ones in their sects. They all understood the importance of the nature creature, which led them to make the decision to bring Luo Luo Zheng back to their sects.</p>

  <p>Each of them had a goal to be the first to enter the gate. There were so many people wanting to enter the gate, that the crowd managed to block nearly the entire opening of the gate.</p>

  <p>Looking at the Dragon Soar Arena's gate, the disciples felt extremely nervous even though all of them had achieved a high level at the consummation of the Illuminating Soul Realm. In their eyes, it was the nature creature who was in the Dragon Soar Arena. However, there was still a chance for a super powerful figure from the Upper World to be in the arena.</p>

  <p>Those who were super powerful could not be defeated. They had strength beyond their imagination and could easily make mountains collapse in an instant.</p>

  <p>Should it be a fairy, the situation would be better. However, if it were creatures that liked killing others, it would be a nightmare and they could most probably be killed by one hit.</p>

  <p>Although there was always a chance of something bad happening, all of them stuck to the gate of the Dragon Soar Arena. The nature creature was far too important for them. If they were able to bring him back to their sects, they would most definitely create a contribution to their sects and additionally, receive rewards beyond their imagination.</p>

  <p>Every warrior at the gate had anxiety.</p>

  <p>The expressions on their faces shifted from one feeling to another.</p>

  <p>"I hear footsteps!" Someone in the crowd said in a fearful voice.</p>

  <p>All of them remained silent and listened carefully. There were indeed steady footsteps which could be heard from the inside of the Dragon Soar Arena.</p>

  <p>"It must be a human being," another one added.</p>

  <p>With the sound of the footsteps drawing closer, the warriors became extremely nervous. Even Fred, who always kept calm, furrowed his eyebrows and a serious look appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>Poop!</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the gates of the Dragon Soar Arena were opened.</p>

  <p>Seeing the warrior standing behind the gate, all the disciples at the consummation level of the Illuminating Soul Realm were astonished.</p>

  <p>How could he be a warrior in the Illuminating Soul Realm?</p>

  <p>Previously, they tried to guess what was in the Dragon Soar Arena countless times. It could probably be the warrior at nature level, or an immortal, or even the exceedingly powerful Genuine Dragon. Other than that, it could even have been a completely new and unknown creature.</p>

  <p>Despite their ideas of what it should've been, all they saw in front of them, was an ordinary warrior, who had reached the third level of the Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>What happened?</p>

  <p>While most of them felt surprised, Fred managed to open his eyes widely. He was left stunned by the one who was standing in front of them.</p>

  <p>After a while, his lips moved and he spoke, "Luo Luo Zheng Luo..."</p>

  <p>'How can it be Luo Luo Zheng? Isn't he a nature creature? Oh, mine! That nature creature who has been transmitted away successfully was Luo Luo Zheng? How could it be? Only three months have passed! Luo Luo Zheng astonishingly improved from his nature level to the Illuminating Soul Realm within as short as three months? Is Luo Luo Zheng at the Illuminating Soul Realm now?' Fred was extremely confused.</p>

  <p>Actually, Fred was a disciple with discretion. Even the elders of the Cloud Hall managed to speak highly of him as he was relatively mature.</p>

  <p>The elders also praised Fred's warrior spirit, which was quite impressive and strong. As long as he focused on himself, as well as his cultivation, he would manage to obtain countless accomplishments in the future.</p>

  <p>However, now Fred was overwhelmed by the thoughts of confusion. He was really shocked, which left his head completely blank.</p>

  <p>Fred was, in fact, just as confused as the other warriors. However, nobody knew Luo Luo Zheng. Thus, all of them managed to recover from their astonishment relatively quickly. Whoever he was, they would capture him first as he was nothing but a warrior at the Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>The first one to start his action was Bevis Tu from the Mysterious Luna Hall. As he stretched out his hand, all of his bones made crackling sounds. His five fingers seemed to become longer, much like the paw of a devil. He charged at Luo Luo Zheng and tried to grab a hold of Luo Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" After Luo Luo Zheng pushed the gate open, he saw a crowd of warriors at the consummation level of the Illuminating Soul Realm. They seemed fierce and as though they were ready to attack him.</p>

  <p>"What are we doing? Come with me! If you stay here, you will be killed!" Bevis said as he gave a cold smile. In his eyes, Luo Luo Zheng had only reached the third level of the Illuminating Soul Realm. It was thus, easy for him to catch Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Stop!" At that particular moment, Fred had managed to recover. He finally realized what was happening. His feet stomped on the ground slightly. Using the technique of Long Fist, he charged at Bevis.</p>

  <p>The Long Fist was very ordinary as it was generally practiced by the majority of warriors.</p>

  <p>It was indeed the case, the same with Luo Zheng's basic swordsmanship. Many warriors practiced the basic swordsmanship once they commenced practicing their sword skills. This technique was also practiced by most of the beginner warriors.</p>

  <p>However, different people had distinct methods of practicing the Long Fist. Fred, for instance, managed to stick to practicing the Long Fist for dozens of years. He even managed to achieve a level high enough to simplify it to its essential nature.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>After a single punch, Fred managed to have Bevis from the Mysterious Luna Hall retreat!</p>

  <p>"Fred Li, what is your goal here? Do you want to be killed?" Bevis shouted angrily. He started his action first. However, he then stepped back. How could he not be angry?</p>

  <p>Although Fred managed to stop Bevis, he could not prevent others at the same time.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha, little guy, you'd better come with me." Mason Jiang from Bloodwood Cliff laughed. At the same time, his two hands stretched towards Luo Luo Zheng like scissors.</p>

  <p>'Oh, no! That's too bad.' Fred recalled to himself. His heart sank immediately. A warrior like Bevis was tough enough for him to fight against. However, how could he manage to prevent other warriors who had similar powers?</p>

  <p>The life vitality in Mason's hands, was extremely sharp. He tried to attack Luo Zheng's face, while at the same time targeting Luo Zheng's legs. His attack to the upper body, was a mere gesture while the lower body was the actual intended attack. In fact, he was planning to strike his legs so hard, that it would break Luo Zheng's legs. His only thought was that it would be easier to take Luo Luo Zheng away by breaking Luo Zheng's legs first.</p>

  <p>Seeing Fred stop one of the warriors in his tracks, Luo Luo Zheng wanted to say something, but never expected another warrior not to give him a chance to do so whatsoever.</p>

  <p>This annoyed Luo Luo Zheng greatly.</p>

  <p>"Are you courting death?" Luo Luo Zheng asked coldly.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng clenched his fist, his body drifting backwards like a ghost, which allowed himself to dodge Mason's attack easily.</p>

  <p>Then Luo Zheng's fist stretched out as fast as lightning. Before Mason could even react, Luo Luo Zheng punched him on the chest heavily.</p>

  <p>Pzzz!</p>

  <p>Though at the consummation level of the Illuminating Soul Realm, Mason was thrown at quite a distance. Mason's body broke the handrail, which wasn't even close to them. He then hit several onlookers. Before he managed to stop, he additionally destroyed a few houses.</p>

  <p>The warriors that wanted to seize Luo Luo Zheng, still managed to keep their gestures. However, they were left stunned, standing still in their tracks like zombies.</p>
