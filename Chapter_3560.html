  <p>
</p>

  <p>A single Sanskrit word normally recorded a great amount of information.</p>

  <p>Zheng was quite taken aback when he found an abundance of Sanskrit words— what sort of things needed to be recorded with so many of them?</p>

  <p>Sensing Zheng's emotional fluctuation, the Regal Jade Spirit asked, "Zheng, what do you see?"</p>

  <p>"So many Sanskrit words!" Zheng exclaimed in excitement.</p>

  <p>"A great number?" Even the spirit was rather surprised.</p>

  <p>He was quite interested in the Land of Inheritance for the purified beings. It could involve higher-level secrets of the Instant Civilization, after all.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Zheng's gaze swept across the slate, giving him a rough estimate.</p>

  <p>"There are about three hundred to four hundred Sanskrit words in total— they all look strange to me. I should ask Geoffrey…"</p>

  <p>These days, Geoffrey was growing more and more proficient in deciphering Sanskrit words. Every time Zheng spotted a new one, he'd think of him.</p>

  <p>But before Zheng could finish his words, the fact that he was now on the Other Shore suddenly came to mind. It was impossible for him to bring Geoffrey there to decipher Sanskrit words. Even if he could, Geoffrey probably wouldn't be able to see the words with his naked eyes because of the white light. Neither No. 9527 nor the Regal Jade Spirit could see them, after all.</p>

  <p>It was even more unrealistic to copy them with duplicating stone tablets as it was impossible for Zheng to bring those to the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>While the Regal Jade Spirit tried figuring out what to do, Zheng's eyes were suddenly fixated on the slate. The first Sanskrit word seemed to have moved.</p>

  <p>The second one followed, and then the third, and the fourth, and so on.</p>

  <p>Rows of Sanskrit words began rolling like waves as they began flipping one after another. Zheng's gaze was completely pulled in by the movement.</p>

  <p>"I think you can try lending Geoffrey your eyesight in the place of his," said the Regal Jade Spirit. "Perhaps that will work." But Zheng paid no mind to his words, let alone responded.</p>

  <p>"Zheng? Zheng, what do you think?"</p>

  <p>After calling his name a few times, the spirit finally realized Zheng's unusual state.</p>

  <p>He was standing as still as a statue, staring blankly ahead.</p>

  <p>In Zheng's vision, the Sanskrit words on the slate had completely come to life.</p>

  <p>They were like several little rats tumbling about. As they did, their movements conveyed specific information.</p>

  <p>Zheng wasn't absorbing the information by 'reading, ' instead, he was gaining understanding rather automatically when he went through the words.</p>

  <p>In the past, Zheng needed Geoffrey to decipher each Sanskrit word he had come across. But these words on the slate before him were somehow different— they instantly conveyed their meaning.</p>

  <p>When Zheng's gaze reached the final word, they all began flipping in reverse.</p>

  <p>Each word flipped at a different angle, conveying new information.</p>

  <p>For a long while, Zheng stood still, watching the words move around.</p>

  <p>A couple of hours later, the words finally stopped rolling.</p>

  <p>"Zheng!</p>

  <p>Zheng! Can you hear me?"</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade Spirit's voice seemed to be coming from afar, but Zheng gradually regained his consciousness until he seemed responsive.</p>

  <p>"What happened to you just now?" asked the spirit.</p>

  <p>There was excitement on Zheng's face as he pointed at the slate. "I've comprehended the words on that slate."</p>

  <p>"Really? Can you decipher Sanskrit words now?" the other asked in surprise.</p>

  <p>But Zheng shook his head before giving the Regal Jade Spirit a rundown of what had happened on the slate. "The information within these Sanskrit words must be a unique theurgy. When these contents entered my head, it was like I fell into a strange state," he added.</p>

  <p>It was the first time he had ever experienced such a special cultivation.</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he reached out and flicked his fingers. With his eyes narrowing in concentration, a white light began gathering at his fingertips, forming a dense ball of light. Just as Elvinia could, Zheng could now freely control the Great Sanskrit Light.</p>

  <p>When Zheng turned his hand over, his body absorbed the light, forming winding lines and spiraling patterns on his palm.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>A small light wave emerged from the spiral. With a flick of Zheng's finger, the light wave shot upwards.</p>

  <p>While the light wave's power was far inferior to that of the giant lizard, it held the same form and effect.</p>

  <p>"It turns out that the giant lizard's powerful light wave was something learned from the slate— the Illuminating Wave, it's called. Elvinia hasn't been to this world, so she hasn't learned it, nor does she know how to employ it."</p>

  <p>Most interesting was the fact that this method of using the Great Sanskrit Light was beyond description.</p>

  <p>Once he observed the Sanskrit words' movement, Zheng grasped the method rather naturally. But he later realized that he couldn't explain how the theurgy worked with mere words— the knowledge had become a kind of instinct.</p>

  <p>"So do you know the way out of here?" The Regal Jade Spirit asked in return.</p>

  <p>"The way out…"</p>

  <p>Zheng's gaze swept across the area, finding nothing but pillars. No door or anything of the sort could be found on the walls— there was no exit whatsoever. It seemed to be an entirely isolated space.</p>

  <p>But as he wondered about leaving, the theurgy within his mind began working on its own.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>A circle of light enveloped Zheng's body before he instantly disappeared within it.</p>

  <p>In the next moment, he had returned to the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>For several hours, Elvinia, Yan, and Natalie had been waiting there. After a while of boredom, they soon began chatting away about Zheng. Distracted by all the chatter, they had eventually forgotten the little conflict between Natalie and Elvinia.</p>

  <p>At Elvinia and Natalie's pressing request, Yan told them about Zheng's childhood, as well as his early adventure in the Eastern Region.</p>

  <p>Zheng's life stories sounded incredible to the two girls who had grown up in the Source World.</p>

  <p>While Elvinia wasn't too astonished because she had already heard some stories from Xun, Natalie's face was full of disbelief.</p>

  <p>Everyone in the Source World was born with great power, after all. So long as they had adequate talent, becoming a True God wasn't all that difficult.</p>

  <p>Zheng, on the other hand, was born among the lowest level of beings in his father's inner world. The fact that he had reached his present level coming from that situation was nothing short of miraculous, Natalie believed.</p>

  <p>A circle of light suddenly appeared beside them, from where Zheng emerged.</p>

  <p>"He's back!" Yan's eyes lit up with absolute joy upon seeing her brother's safe return.</p>

  <p>"What exactly is this circle of light? How did it take you away?" Elvinia asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"You can check it out for yourself if you want to, you know," Zheng threw an easy smile in Elvinia's direction. He wanted to send her into the palace of light. After she grasped the Sanskrit words on the slate, she would get the answer on her own.</p>

  <p>But surprisingly, the circle of light didn't appear at his command. The three women stared at him curiously, wondering what he meant.</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled wryly in mild embarrassment.</p>

  <p>"Well… it seems that I failed…"</p>
