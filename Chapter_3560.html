<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>A single Sanskrit word normally recorded a great amount of information.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was quite taken aback when he found an abundance of Sanskrit words? what sort of things needed to be recorded with so many of them?</p>

  <p>Sensing Luo Zheng's emotional fluctuation, the Green Jade Spirit asked, "Luo Zheng, what do you see?"</p>

  <p>"So many Sanskrit words!" Luo Zheng exclaimed in excitement.</p>

  <p>"A great number?" Even the spirit was rather surprised.</p>

  <p>He was quite interested in the Land of Inheritance for the purified beings. It could involve higher-level secrets of the Instant Civilization, after all.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Luo Zheng's gaze swept across the slate, giving him a rough estimate.</p>

  <p>"There are about three hundred to four hundred Sanskrit words in total? they all look strange to me. I should ask Luo Nian?"</p>

  <p>These days, Luo Nian was growing more and more proficient in deciphering Sanskrit words. Every time Luo Zheng spotted a new one, he'd think of him.</p>

  <p>But before Luo Zheng could finish his words, the fact that he was now on the Other Shore suddenly came to mind. It was impossible for him to bring Luo Nian there to decipher Sanskrit words. Even if he could, Luo Nian probably wouldn't be able to see the words with his naked eyes because of the white light. Neither No. 9527 nor the Green Jade Spirit could see them, after all.</p>

  <p>It was even more unrealistic to copy them with duplicating stone tablets as it was impossible for Luo Zheng to bring those to the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>While the Green Jade Spirit tried figuring out what to do, Luo Zheng's eyes were suddenly fixated on the slate. The first Sanskrit word seemed to have moved.</p>

  <p>The second one followed, and then the third, and the fourth, and so on.</p>

  <p>Rows of Sanskrit words began rolling like waves as they began flipping one after another. Luo Zheng's gaze was completely pulled in by the movement.</p>

  <p>"I think you can try lending Luo Nian your eyesight in the place of his," said the Green Jade Spirit. "Perhaps that will work." But Luo Zheng paid no mind to his words, let alone responded.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng? Luo Zheng, what do you think?"</p>

  <p>After calling his name a few times, the spirit finally realized Luo Zheng's unusual state.</p>

  <p>He was standing as still as a statue, staring blankly ahead.</p>

  <p>In Luo Zheng's vision, the Sanskrit words on the slate had completely come to life.</p>

  <p>They were like several little rats tumbling about. As they did, their movements conveyed specific information.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng wasn't absorbing the information by 'reading, ' instead, he was gaining understanding rather automatically when he went through the words.</p>

  <p>In the past, Luo Zheng needed Luo Nian to decipher each Sanskrit word he had come across. But these words on the slate before him were somehow different? they instantly conveyed their meaning.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng's gaze reached the final word, they all began flipping in reverse.</p>

  <p>Each word flipped at a different angle, conveying new information.</p>

  <p>For a long while, Luo Zheng stood still, watching the words move around.</p>

  <p>A couple of hours later, the words finally stopped rolling.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng! Can you hear me?"</p>

  <p>The Green Jade Spirit's voice seemed to be coming from afar, but Luo Zheng gradually regained his consciousness until he seemed responsive.</p>

  <p>"What happened to you just now?" asked the spirit.</p>

  <p>There was excitement on Luo Zheng's face as he pointed at the slate. "I've comprehended the words on that slate."</p>

  <p>"Really? Can you decipher Sanskrit words now?" the other asked in surprise.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng shook his head before giving the Green Jade Spirit a rundown of what had happened on the slate. "The information within these Sanskrit words must be a unique token. When these contents entered my head, it was like I fell into a strange state," he added.</p>

  <p>It was the first time he had ever experienced such a special cultivation.</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he reached out and flicked his fingers. With his eyes narrowing in concentration, a white light began gathering at his fingertips, forming a dense ball of light. Just as Feng Ge could, Luo Zheng could now freely control the Great Sanskrit Light.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng turned his hand over, his body absorbed the light, forming winding lines and spiraling patterns on his palm.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>A small light wave emerged from the spiral. With a flick of Luo Zheng's finger, the light wave shot upwards.</p>

  <p>While the light wave's power was far inferior to that of the giant lizard, it held the same form and effect.</p>

  <p>"It turns out that the giant lizard's powerful light wave was something learned from the slate? the Illuminating Wave, it's called. Feng Ge hasn't been to this world, so she hasn't learned it, nor does she know how to employ it."</p>

  <p>Most interesting was the fact that this method of using the Great Sanskrit Light was beyond description.</p>

  <p>Once he observed the Sanskrit words' movement, Luo Zheng grasped the method rather naturally. But he later realized that he couldn't explain how the token worked with mere words? the knowledge had become a kind of instinct.</p>

  <p>"So do you know the way out of here?" The Green Jade Spirit asked in return.</p>

  <p>"The way out?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's gaze swept across the area, finding nothing but pillars. No door or anything of the sort could be found on the walls? there was no exit whatsoever. It seemed to be an entirely isolated space.</p>

  <p>But as he wondered about leaving, the token within his mind began working on its own.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>A circle of light enveloped Luo Zheng's body before he instantly disappeared within it.</p>

  <p>In the next moment, he had returned to the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>For several hours, Feng Ge, Yan, and Natalie had been waiting there. After a while of boredom, they soon began chatting away about Luo Zheng. Distracted by all the chatter, they had eventually forgotten the little conflict between Natalie and Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>At Feng Ge and Natalie's pressing request, Yan told them about Luo Zheng's childhood, as well as his early adventure in the Eastern Region.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's life stories sounded incredible to the two girls who had grown up in the Source World.</p>

  <p>While Feng Ge wasn't too astonished because she had already heard some stories from Xun, Natalie's face was full of disbelief.</p>

  <p>Everyone in the Source World was born with great power, after all. So long as they had adequate talent, becoming a True God wasn't all that difficult.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, on the other hand, was born among the lowest level of beings in his father's inner world. The fact that he had reached his present level coming from that situation was nothing short of miraculous, Natalie believed.</p>

  <p>A circle of light suddenly appeared beside them, from where Luo Zheng emerged.</p>

  <p>"He's back!" Yan's eyes lit up with absolute joy upon seeing her brother's safe return.</p>

  <p>"What exactly is this circle of light? How did it take you away?" Feng Ge asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"You can check it out for yourself if you want to, you know," Luo Zheng threw an easy smile in Feng Ge's direction. He wanted to send her into the palace of light. After she grasped the Sanskrit words on the slate, she would get the answer on her own.</p>

  <p>But surprisingly, the circle of light didn't appear at his command. The three women stared at him curiously, wondering what he meant.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled wryly in mild embarrassment.</p>

  <p>"Well? it seems that I failed?"</p>
