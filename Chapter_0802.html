<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>After everyone left, Immortal Mist's celestial tomb slowly went quiet, as if boiling water had been taken off a flame.</p>

  <p>One of the many gigantic walls slowly moved away. The disturbed dust started to rise before slowly spreading out, and when the wall finally settled, Luo Zheng could see a giant transmission array inside.</p>

  <p>It was ten times larger than any other transmission arrays he had ever seen.</p>

  <p>It took a while but after the transmission array was slowly activated, Luo Zheng didn't hesitate and immediately stepped inside.</p>

  <p>As of right now, there were two more tokens in his space ring. The token which was inscribed with the word "thunder" could open the True Path of the fairy palace. But Luo Zheng was temporarily unable to use it. He would probably have to wait until he had returned to the Eastern Region and entered the fairy palace again before he could use it.</p>

  <p>Not only that, he had also plundered the remaining treasures in the huge coffin he had encountered before.</p>

  <p>And the most important thing he had managed to find today was a Jade Butterfly that Immortal Mist had given him. But Immortal Mist's words had been a little vague. On the one hand, he had told Luo Zheng that the legacy he would encounter below the Tower of Sin was extremely important and was related to the rise and fall of the entire human race. On the other hand, he refused to tell Luo Zheng exactly what it was.</p>

  <p>All he had explained was that after entering the bottom layer of the Tower of Sin, possessing a Jade Butterfly would give Luo Zheng a certain probability of activating the inheritance. However, his destination as well as his journey was extremely dangerous. That was one of the reasons why Immortal Mist had chosen a person with such great luck for it.</p>

  <p>Those who were blessed with a great luck were known to be extremely tough and robust. It was extremely difficult to kill them, and even the chance of them dying naturally was quite low.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had always been in danger and managed to survive every time. This was solid proof that he was blessed with the great luck required for such a journey.</p>

  <p>"I have already told you everything that you need to know. Although you are fateful enough to lead the world of chaos, it doesn't mean that you will not die. Your luck only makes it very difficult for you to die. There have been instances in history where warriors with the same kind of blessed fate have died, so you should be careful. What happens now is dependent entirely on what your luck decides," Immortal Mist concluded.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded heavily.</p>

  <p>He must cherish his life and be careful as the fates of Yan and the entire Cloud Hall were now tied to his own.</p>

  <p>Even though Eddie could not break the Cloud Hall's enchanted barrier for now, it did not mean that he was locked out forever. If he were to find another warrior who possessed a Purple Power Body, the situation and balance of powers in the Central Region would drastically change. What was more, the Holy Maiden of the divine kingdom wasn't going to let him off the hook so easily.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Luo Zheng was in a bad situation, and he was pressed for time too.</p>

  <p>"Ready?" Immortal Mist asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Luo Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>The next moment, several streams of incandescent light poured down from the top like mercury. They flowed along the massive transmission array, outlining a massive pattern. When the light had reached every single part of the transmission array, it suddenly erupted out with an intense radiance.</p>

  <p>"Aargh!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng felt a powerful force pull him from where he was standing, as if a giant's hand grabbed him tight, and was throwing him into the huge transmission channel above.</p>

  <p>Zheng's surroundings turned from a calm, natural environment to a dazzling blue. The transmission channel he was in right now was several times larger than the ones he had ever seen before, and he was shuttling through it at an extremely fast speed.</p>

  <p>"Dammit! Space windstorm again!"</p>

  <p>Long-distance teleportation arrays were bound to suffer from some unstable spots, and it was precisely at these weak spots that intense space windstorms would arise.</p>

  <p>The first time he had encountered a space windstorm, Luo Zheng had meekly hidden behind Kenneth. Later on, he had managed to comprehend a bit of Space Law.</p>

  <p>Today, Luo Zheng naturally did not fear such an ordinary space windstorm. His figure flashed with a dazzling light and like a nimble fish, he dove right into the heart of the space windstorm. Somehow, it was unable to harm him a single bit.</p>

  <p>The space windstorm was incomparably massive and as Luo Zheng dove through it like a dolphin swimming through the ocean, he was able to sense the Space Law with ease.</p>

  <p>Though he had comprehended the first level of the Space Law, using it allowed him to cross over a very short distance only. The longest he could travel was only about a hundred feet, and if he wanted to cross even farther, he needed to comprehend the second level of the Space Law.</p>

  <p>Initially, Luo Zheng thought that he was in a level two windstorm and therefore, could comprehend the second level of the Space Law. However, after entering inside, he discovered that the space windstorm he was in was formed with the level one Space Law Power only.</p>

  <p>Since he was unable to comprehend the second level of the Space Law, Luo Zheng was inevitably a little disappointed. After wandering around for a while, he saw that he had nothing to do here and left the blue space windstorm.</p>

  <p>However, just as he left the blue space windstorm, he saw a massive purple space windstorm in front of him.</p>

  <p>"That is..."</p>

  <p>The purple space windstorm was streaked with several lines, and the Space Law Power contained within it was far beyond Zheng's imagination. His heart tightened at the sight. Before he had a chance to dodge, he was pulled inside by the purple space windstorm.</p>

  <p>Crack, crack, crack…</p>

  <p>A terrifying power escaped from the space windstorm and tried to tear Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>The power was so massive that Luo Zheng sprayed out a mouthful of blood within moments. The blood was also torn into confetti the instant it left his mouth.</p>

  <p>No matter how much he struggled, his body was completely trapped inside the purple space windstorm.</p>

  <p>If it wasn't a top-grade fairy weapon, his body would have been torn into pieces by the space windstorm long ago. But even though it could withstand the tearing power it was facing with difficulty, the pain was still unbearable.</p>

  <p>And since he had accidentally fallen down into the purple space windstorm, the injuries he was sustaining were even more severe.</p>

  <p>"Which level is this space windstorm at? How can it be so strong?" To be perfectly honest, Luo Zheng was a bit scared. He hadn't thought that he would encounter such a powerful space windstorm in the transmission channel.</p>

  <p>As the power of space windstorm twisted and strangled him, Luo Zheng slowly lost his consciousness. Much like a dead body in the ocean, he followed the waves of the space windstorm, silent and unconscious.</p>

  <p>Time went by slowly.</p>

  <p>In a continent far away from the Sky Northern Region, a huge whirlpool suddenly appeared in the sky. The whirlpool seemed to be a tear in the fabric of reality since one could hear distant explosions and rumbles from within it. The birds and the beasts hiding in the forest below immediately jumped into the sky and ran asunder.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>A figure shot down from the whirlpool and landed heavily on the ground.</p>

  <p>It immediately sent up a large cloud of dust into the air the moment it landed and at the same time, it created a huge crater too.</p>

  <p>Lying motionless in the crater, Luo Zheng stared blankly at the sky.</p>

  <p>That purple space windstorm was so powerful that even though his body was a top-grade fairy weapon, he was still unable to resist its pull and had lost consciousness.</p>

  <p>Although he had successfully passed through the space channel, his body was still severely injured. As of right now, he could not move at all. He could only open his eyes and stare blankly at the clouds that were gradually floating around in the sky.</p>

  <p>"This is terrible..." Luo Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>As he lay in the crater, his vision was extremely narrow. He didn't even know where he was.</p>

  <p>About four hours later, a small head popped out of the edge of the crater.</p>

  <p>It was a little boy about eight or nine years old. He looked strong, and his eyes were full of spirit.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng wanted to open his mouth to speak, but found that he couldn't even utter a sound. As for circulating his life vitality, that was even more impossible.</p>

  <p>"Lori, look!" The boy was still looking at Luo Zheng and there was no trace of fear in his eyes as he called someone to come and see.</p>

  <p>Pretty soon, a girl, also of his age, stuck her head out of the edge of the crater too. Her big eyes blinked twice, and her face revealed a terrified expression. "He's still alive. I'm going to tell my dad."</p>

  <p>"Shh!" The boy stared at Luo Zheng and stopped the girl. "Don't tell your dad. I have a gift for you!"</p>

  <p>The girl asked curiously, "What is it?"</p>

  <p>The boy slowly slid down the edge of the crater. He was extremely agile.</p>

  <p>After sliding down to Zheng's side, he reached out his hand and took off the ring on Zheng's chest.</p>

  <p>Zheng's gaze immediately turned cold.</p>

  <p>That was Yudie's space ring. Apart from the fact that it contained almost all of Zheng's wealth, the ring itself was also very important to him.</p>

  <p>The problem was that right now, Luo Zheng couldn't even move, let alone stop a child from taking his space ring. He merely watched the boy climb up.</p>

  <p>"This is yours," the boy smiled.</p>

  <p>"No! You stole this from someone else! I am going to tell your dad!" Seeing this, the girl became angry.</p>

  <p>"Why are you like this? Forget it!" the boy said angrily, then turned around and left the edge of the crater.</p>

  <p>With one last glance at Luo Zheng, the girl also followed him. Lying inside the crater, Luo Zheng heard the little girl call from far away, "If you don't return it, I'll tell your dad!"</p>
