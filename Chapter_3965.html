<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>There were many different races in the Grand Pure Realm, and the Flaming Maple Forest had just undergone drastic changes.</p>

  <p>This was why the long-haired monsters hadn't had any trouble sneaking in and getting the information they desired. It was in fact, quite easy for them.</p>

  <p>Their report surprised Dorothy greatly. "A human, seventy to eighty feet high saved my grandmother? Are you sure?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am sure. This human is said to be incredibly powerful," answered the long-haired monster, an eagerness noticeably flickering in its eyes. All these monsters were powerful themselves and were interested in competing against the human mentioned.</p>

  <p>"But no human is seventy to eighty feet tall. Did he activate the Wild God Body?" Dorothy pressed further.</p>

  <p>"The Wild God Body cannot be used in the Flaming Maple Forest, so it can't be that. No matter how, your grandmother is safe now. It is said the human defeated all the creatures in the Flaming Maple Forest!" The long-haired monster stared intensely at Dorothy after it spoke and the other monsters did the same.</p>

  <p>She had been putting off the matter they had pleaded her to resolve with the excuse of having to save her grandmother first. The long-haired monsters then made it their top priority to save Ying.</p>

  <p>Now that someone else had saved her, Dorothy had no excuses; it was time for her to fulfill her promise.</p>

  <p>"Your grandmother will be fine under the human's protection."</p>

  <p>"It's your turn to help us now!"</p>

  <p>"It wasn't us who saved your grandmother, but we put a lot of time into it..."</p>

  <p>Dorothy looked around mischievously at their pleas. "Before I do that, could I first go see my grandmother?"</p>

  <p>The long passageway then fell into a gloomy state of disappointment.</p>

  <p>The long-haired monsters stared down Dorothy with daggers in their eyes.</p>

  <p>They had been waiting too long for this, patiently hoping she would remove their curse as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>It was now obvious she did not take their pleading seriously. They were so infuriated they almost felt like killing her on the spot!</p>

  <p>"I'm just kidding," Dorothy said, shrugging her shoulders nervously as she realized her humor was not being well received.</p>

  <p>The mood did however seem to ease a bit when she spoke up...</p>

  <p>A thick white fog flowed over the broad, low-lying area all year long.</p>

  <p>This fog had not cleared since this place had come into existence. This was how it came to be known as the Misty Pool.</p>

  <p>If one stood at the edge of the low-lying land and looked down, they would only be able to see ten feet away, at most, never seeing what lay in the center of this mysterious place.</p>

  <p>There were some curious creatures and Eternal Realm warriors that had gone into the fog to explore, but none had ever returned.</p>

  <p>For as far back as was known, what hid in this pit was an unsolvable mystery. And so it remained.</p>

  <p>If someone dared jump into the pit, they would discover their bodies moved out of control in the white fog. They would sink like boulders to the bottom of the pit where the ground was covered in a bright yellow gum. The whole thing looked like a gigantic piece of amber and the soft gum would slowly absorb anything that was caught in it, dissolving it all bit by bit.</p>

  <p>Any creatures unlucky enough to witness this would see all sorts of creatures of all form trapped within the huge amber. Some were only slightly worn away while others were left as nothing more than hard bones...</p>

  <p>The amber had a circular hole in the middle which extended down, deep into the ground, to a cave that never saw a spec of light.</p>

  <p>In the cave were six round stone platforms with a square coffin placed on each.</p>

  <p>Beside the first platform stood three women. They were Samantha, Sienna and Stella.</p>

  <p>They seemed to have held this posture for painfully long; so long their bodies had turned stiff. But their faces showed no trace of impatience or suffering. They just continued waiting firmly and devoutly.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>A strange sound came from the coffin on the platform and the thick, heavy lid slowly slid to the side.</p>

  <p>A bright yellow mist emerged from it, quickly morphing into a hand of bone as it left the coffin. Following the bone, flesh, blood and veins soon materialized and formed a complete hand.</p>

  <p>It rose into the air steadily and a head, shoulders and a torso quickly formed behind it. It was none other than the Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>"Congratulations on your return, Grandmaster of Heaven!"</p>

  <p>Samantha, Sienna, and Stella bowed to him with tremendous respect.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven looked at his arm sadly. After a moment he grumbled, "I'm not used to this new body."</p>

  <p>"Did you not say your new body will be stronger than the one you had before?" Samantha asked with a smile.</p>

  <p>As members of the Interception Sect, they never regretted following the Grandmaster of Heaven. They wouldn't even hesitate to sacrifice their own lives for him if they had to.</p>

  <p>"That's true," nodded the Grandmaster of Heaven, "they gave me three bodies, each stronger than the last. This second one is indeed extraordinary, but it takes some time to adapt to it."</p>

  <p>"Is it stronger than the Eye Spirit's?" Stella asked, blinking her eyes in excitement.</p>

  <p>"If I had fought the Eye Spirit with this body in our last battle, I would have defeated him," replied the Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>"Then... What about Luo Zheng?" Sienna asked.</p>

  <p>Although they held great respect for him, he was not so stern that they had to behave a certain way in his presence. More to it, they had followed him for many years and were very close to him and so were not afraid to discuss sensitive topics with him.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng?"</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven's eyes flashed at the mention of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Over the years, he had led the Nihility race against the Element Spirit Civilization as evenly matched rivals. Never in his wildest dreams had he expected he would be defeated so humiliatingly by a young man!</p>

  <p>He had been reflecting on his defeat during his resurgence and was now capable of reacting calmly.</p>

  <p>"He saved the Li Shan mountain; he should have entered Stage Thirty-three by now, right?" the Grandmaster of Heaven inquired.</p>

  <p>Sienna took a step forward and answered, "According to the latest reports, he was in the Flaming Maple Forest."</p>

  <p>"Why would he enter the territory of the Misty River race?" wondered the Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>"He was trying to save the replica of Eastern Emperor Taiyi," revealed Sienna.</p>

  <p>"Although the Misty River race only has a few members, Hawley is not someone he'd be able to defeat easily..."</p>

  <p>Just as he murmured thoughtfully, Sienna interrupted him, "The Eye Spirit sent Norris and some others to keep an eye on the Flaming Maple Forest but Luo Zheng left them all seriously injured. He even killed Hawley. It is said that even the Flaming Maple Forest bowed to his strength..."</p>

  <p>The three women spent most of their time gathering information for the Grandmaster of Heaven and so were naturally very well-informed.</p>

  <p>Sienna's news stunned the Grandmaster of Heaven into silence.</p>

  <p>"We've been waiting for you to wake up. You're the only one capable of capturing that young man," added Samantha.</p>

  <p>"Capture him?" The Grandmaster of Heaven pondered this for a moment before smiling and shaking his head. "Forget it," he said.</p>

  <p>"Why?" asked the three women curiously.</p>

  <p>"His next goal is probably to save the Primeval Lord of Heaven," the Grandmaster of Heaven replied. "Let the Eye Spirit deal with him first.</p>

  <p>Let's just wait and see what happens."</p>

  <p>Since Luo Zheng carried the Civilization Artifact of the human race, it seemed likely he wanted to rescue all the human heroes. Because of this, he was bound to clash with the Element Spirit Civilization, and the Nihility race needed only to stand by and watch.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Zheng could defeat Hawley with ease, the Grandmaster of Heaven believed that he would be a severe headache for the Eye Spirit.</p>
