  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Soul Devouring Demon should keep a low profile now, on account of how wild and ruthless he had behaved on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>No one had thought he would ever be so arrogant.</p>

  <p>He was so fearless; he had offended almost all the super forces and then still had the audacity to admit to his evil deeds. It was no wonder the Black Ship chose him!</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Shera seemed to have no intention to restrain the young man in black and showed zero care for his safety.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was inquiring of the origin of the Black Ship when the young man in black appeared suddenly before him. Luo Zheng stood up with eyebrows raised and his eyes glazed over in disbelief.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?" Feng Ge asked in confusion.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, do you know him?" Dorothy was confused as well.</p>

  <p>Both Dorothy and Feng Ge were totally confounded. Not only did Luo Zheng have something to do with the Li Shan mountain, but he also seemed to know this man from the Black Ship.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng had just asked of the origin of the Black Ship; it might be possible he knew nothing about it.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know him," Luo Zheng answered with a bitter smile. "He is a secondary creature from my inner world."</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"A creature in your inner world?"</p>

  <p>Feng Ge and Dorothy were both flabbergasted.</p>

  <p>Qiu Yinhe stood at the front and turned his head in shock on hearing Luo Zheng's words. "Are you sure?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Luo Zheng replied sourly. "I released him when I entered the Source World.</p>

  <p>I didn't expect him to get so powerful in such a short period of time."</p>

  <p>When he had released the Evil God, he felt he owed him something because of the Ways-blending Energy.</p>

  <p>Although he was aware the Evil God had an incomparable talent, he never thought he would be capable of growing and improving his cultivation base at such speed, and join a force like the Black Ship!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had taken precautionary measure though. He had built him a Rebirth Land.</p>

  <p>He could sense the Evil God's general position if he was near him, but Luo Zheng hadn't known until the Evil God jumped from the Black Ship.</p>

  <p>How had he avoided the restraint of the Rebirth Land?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng knew the Rebirth Land was not omnipotent, but he never imagined the Evil God would break free so quickly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's revelation left Feng Ge, Dorothy and Qiu Yinhe speechless.</p>

  <p>What amazed everyone was how powerful both Luo Zheng and the creature from his inner world were. They both possessed such formidable strength that it was hard to comprehend.</p>

  <p>The young man in black looked strong and arrogant. He was definitely not a kind man.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge, Qiu Yinhe and Dorothy still wondered if perhaps Luo Zheng had mistaken this young man for someone else.</p>

  <p>Many forces were still digesting the words of the young man in black, when he turned his head and looked at the members of the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>When he saw Luo Zheng, the wild and evil smile on his face grew and was even more prominent now.</p>

  <p>"What a coincidence! My Creator is here too," the Evil God bellowed for all to hear.</p>

  <p>Everyone looked around in confusion.</p>

  <p>"The Creator? What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"It sounds like a supreme title..."</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha. Is it referring to the Creator of the inner world?"</p>

  <p>Everyone present had created the inner world, which was basically complete. They had at least completely created a Hundred Sanskrit Land.</p>

  <p>They all had their own titles in their inner worlds, such as the God of Creation, the Paramount Creator, the Lord of Life and so on. All sorts of strange titles existed. They were the absolute masters of their own inner worlds and it was perfectly normal for the secondary creatures within to address them by those titles.</p>

  <p>However, such titles would confuse everyone in the Source World and the chaos. Only the one who created the Source World was qualified to be called the 'Creator'.</p>

  <p>Shera's big eyes blinked and released a ray of spiritual light. The revelation that it was a disciple from the Taiyi Heaven Palace who had created the Evil God irked her.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was not the slightest bit unnerved in the face of the Evil God. He took a step forward and said, "It is indeed a coincidence. I haven't expected you to have raised your cultivation base so fast."</p>

  <p>Everyone looked on, trying to understand their relationship. The Evil God stared at Luo Zheng as if he were his prey. Eventually he spoke, "I must thank you.</p>

  <p>It's an honor to have been born in your inner world. Even so, I wanted to kill you every second of every hour I lived in your inner world."</p>

  <p>"Wow..."</p>

  <p>This sent everyone present into an uproar.</p>

  <p>The members of the Bearing race and the Separate Abyss race, and even Fuxi were shocked.</p>

  <p>Was he kidding?</p>

  <p>Was this young man really the secondary creature of Luo Zheng's inner world?</p>

  <p>Yan, who stood on the opposite side, bit her lips and said in a low voice,</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng..."</p>

  <p>It was true! This powerful young man in black really did come from Luo Zheng's inner world! He had been a secondary creature once.</p>

  <p>From the Evil God's point of view, he could not allow anyone to be superior to him.</p>

  <p>However, as a member of Luo Zheng's inner world, no matter how powerful he was, he still could not disobey Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>All it would take was a gaze or a thought from Luo Zheng to kill him a thousand times over!</p>

  <p>Before, the Evil God had to endure this subjugation and restrain himself to wait for the perfect chance to leave. In the end he had won Luo Zheng's trust and finally escaped from that damned world.</p>

  <p>"It seems I made a mistake by letting you leave my inner world. Perhaps I should kill you with the Rebirth Land," Luo Zheng said flatly.</p>

  <p>He knew the Evil God had found a way to make the Rebirth Land ineffective, and he simply uttered the words to see his reaction.</p>

  <p>"You're welcome to try. Ha-ha..." The Evil God chuckled again.</p>

  <p>As he laughed, a terrifying force began crashing towards him.</p>

  <p>"Watch out!" Shera was shocked at this scene. "Human Sovereign, how dare you ..."</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>Fuxi, not far away, stretched out his finger and pressed it downwards slightly and an invisible force shoved the Evil God to the ground.</p>

  <p>Before Shera even realized what had happened, Fuxi stretched his hand out and pulled the Evil God over to him, grabbing him by the neck.</p>

  <p>Such was Fuxi's power that even just one of his fingers was capable of releasing this incredible strength.</p>

  <p>The Evil God had sustained serious injuries. Blood flowed like a river as he was unable to move in Fuxi's grip.</p>

  <p>Shera's lovely face darkened and morphed strangely. Her dark pupils were completely vacant and the whites in her eyes, terrifyingly, had disappeared.</p>

  <p>She was now in a fighting state which she would only get into when faced with a powerful opponent such as Fuxi.</p>

  <p>Fuxi paid no attention to Shera. He gripped the Evil God's neck tightly and yelled in his face, "I don't care where you're from. I've said it before and I'll say it again. If anyone dares attack Luo Zheng outside the Chaotic Source World, I'll kill them!"</p>

  <p>Blood trickled down from the Evil God's forehead, a violent force flowed through his body and one of his eyes began glowing with hatred.</p>

  <p>He had never suffered such a loss.</p>

  <p>But Fuxi was so incredibly powerful...</p>

  <p>He was a mere ant to Fuxi, a little creature with no strength to fight back, just as he had been with Luo Zheng in the past.</p>
