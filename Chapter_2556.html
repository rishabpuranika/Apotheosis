<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Blood transfusion was not an easy task. It was said that such a thing had to be done by powerhouses of the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>For most of the Wild Gods in the world, this was undoubtedly an opportunity to completely change their fate.</p>

  <p>In the past, only a warrior from another race who made great contributions to the Nine Li race could earn such a privilege.</p>

  <p>If it weren't for the pressure from the Yellow Emperor race, the Nine Li race wouldn't have decided to let Zheng in.</p>

  <p>As far as Giacomo was concerned, Zheng was very lucky to have such a good chance that was only given once in a thousand years. So naturally, he believed that Zheng would accept this chance with excitement.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng just gave a slight nod in response. "Of course I'm willing, but before that, I still hope to have a try. I want to know if I can directly absorb the Wild God Power in them."</p>

  <p>Hearing Zheng's words, Sarah, the woman in emerald, and the others stood still, staring at Zheng with confusion on their faces.</p>

  <p>'What a lucky reward! But why isn't Zheng immediately accepting it?'</p>

  <p>Giacomo himself frowned, feeling a little angry. In an affronted tone, he said, "Well, let me see if you can absorb the Wild God Power of our Nine Li race!"</p>

  <p>Without saying anything more, Zheng grabbed one of the blood wild bones with one hand.</p>

  <p>The truth was that Zheng himself was not sure if he could directly absorb the blood wild bone. After all, he had undergone the process of blood exchange, so he had no idea if his blood would be compatible with the blood of the wild bone.</p>

  <p>"Master Giacomo, the wild bone would be wasted in this way..." the woman in emerald said worriedly.</p>

  <p>If Zheng extracted the Wild God Power from the wild bone and his body wasn't able to absorb it, then all the Wild God Power would dissipate.</p>

  <p>It wasn't advisable at all to let Zheng waste the blood wild bone just for the sake of an experiment.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter!" Giacomo said as he waved his hand. He was too offended to think straight.</p>

  <p>Ignoring the tense atmosphere around him, Zheng gently moved his hand over the surface of the brown wild bone, and brown waves of Wild God Power burst out like spring water.</p>

  <p>"Trickle Spring Method?" A trace of disdain appeared on everyone's face when they saw Zheng's skill.</p>

  <p>Although Zelda belonged to the Warden race, the method she had cultivated to become a Wild God was not inherited from this race. She had learned the Trickle Spring Method from other places, and it was a relatively clumsy method.</p>

  <p>These people naturally looked down upon Zheng when they saw him using such a clumsy tactic.</p>

  <p>In particular, Giacomo's anger rose when he saw Zheng using this method.</p>

  <p>He was afraid that the blood wild bone was going to be wasted, just like the woman in emerald had warned.</p>

  <p>After Zheng extracted the brown Wild God Power, he guided it to immerse in his own body.</p>

  <p>The moment the Wild God Power was infused into his body, Zheng felt a different power within.</p>

  <p>This power contained a primitive restlessness that even affected Zheng's mind. He had a strange feeling, like his heart was shrinking violently. It was almost as if the power was threatening to be released from the confines of his body.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng managed to contain it. Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...</p>

  <p>Wisps of brown Wild God Power continuously entered his body, but they did not spread out at all.</p>

  <p>In a short while, he managed to absorb all the Wild God Power in the blood wild bone as the people in the hall stared at him in stunned silence.</p>

  <p>Even Giacomo was dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>A warrior's flesh body would try to repel the Wild God Power if the blood of the wild bone didn't match theirs. Even if it was forcefully absorbed, by all logic, the flesh would reject it, causing it to dissipate into the air.</p>

  <p>But somehow, Zheng had absorbed all of it!</p>

  <p>More importantly, the Wild God Power hadn't dissipated even a little bit.</p>

  <p>Even Giacomo would waste about 30% of the Wild God Power when refining a wild bone. However, Zheng had actually absorbed all of the Wild God Power into his body. This was even more surprising than the fact that he had managed to absorb the blood wild bone of the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>"Did you already know that you have Chiyou's blood? Who are your parents?" Giacomo asked in disbelief.</p>

  <p>The only explanation that made sense was that Zheng was born in the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>But the members of the Nine Li race were not allowed to breed with outsiders. There were no exceptions to this rule in the Sky Spirit Bone Tower.</p>

  <p>But today, Zheng, who must have the blood of the Nine Li race, had suddenly appeared out of nowhere. It was natural for Giacomo to feel confused.</p>

  <p>"You don't know my parents." Zheng smiled. "But it seems that you want to fulfill your promise."</p>

  <p>Giacomo looked at Zheng with a complicated expression on his face. After a long while, he said, "If I know where you come from, I will fulfill my promise, and those blood wild bones are yours. Take your things and go with me."</p>

  <p>"I still want to dig the wild bones..." Zheng said.</p>

  <p>"No matter how many bones you need, I can give them to you. But you can't get any of the Admission Tokens," said Giacomo coldly.</p>

  <p>Zheng fell silent.</p>

  <p>The woman in emerald was good at gauging people's minds. She knew that this was not a small matter, so she sent someone to exchange the other blood wild bones that Zheng had. As for the remaining three wild bones of Chiyou's blood, she naturally didn't mention them.</p>

  <p>After handling these matters, Zheng bid goodbye to Sarah and the others, and left with Giacomo.</p>

  <p>Looking at Zheng's back as he left, Sarah and Hiram sighed. They hadn't expected that the one who had been with them for the past few days was actually from the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>But even if Zheng was really from the Nine Li race, it was impossible to explain his strength. They had never seen anyone who had cultivated to become a True God be so powerful before.</p>

  <p>High in the sky, Zheng flew at high speed, following behind Giacomo.</p>

  <p>"Master Giacomo, where are we going?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Just call me Giacomo."</p>

  <p>"Giacomo," Zheng echoed.</p>

  <p>"I don't know who you are. But do you know how long you would live if you didn't come here at this time?" Giacomo asked deliberately.</p>

  <p>Zheng thought for a moment, and then smiled and said, "Maybe three years."</p>

  <p>"So you know?" Giacomo raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>Only a few people knew about the Light of Adjudication, and these people would go all out to fight and get into the bone tower to avoid the disaster that occurred once in a thousand years.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded. "Yes. That's why I came here," he said frankly.</p>

  <p>"Let me take you to the Sky Spirit Bone Tower. First, I want to know how pure your blood is. If it turns out that you are really from our Nine Li race, we will treat you well," said Giacomo.</p>

  <p>Even though he had seen Zheng suck the blood wild bone dry in front of his own eyes, it was still difficult for him to believe. After all, it made no sense at all.</p>

  <p>Zheng had mainly cultivated the True God system and he had strong mental power. Now, it turned out that he had Chiyou's blood running through his veins too. It was hard for Giacomo to imagine that these characteristics would appear in a foreign member he did not know.</p>

  <p>"You want to know how pure my blood is?" Zheng was a bit confused.</p>

  <p>Giacomo looked at Zheng calmly. "Our race has the noblest blood in the world. It has been passed onto us by our progenitor, Chiyou. However, the purity of each person's blood is different. We usually check the purity of a person's bloody the day they're born. Of course, you can't be exempted from this tradition either."</p>
