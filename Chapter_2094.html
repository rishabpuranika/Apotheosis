<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As soon as the Soul-eater flew upwards, Zheng's gaze followed it. In a flash he disappeared from where he stood.</p>

  <p>The next moment, he appeared right above the Soul-eater. He twisted his body in an astonishing way and rammed his elbow into the monster's head.</p>

  <p>Thump!</p>

  <p>The elbow struck with a dull sound. The amount of energy Luo Zheng put did not have much impact.</p>

  <p>But despite the blunt blow, the Soul-eater started rapidly descending.</p>

  <p>"Aargh! The pain! What did you do?"</p>

  <p>Physically, the Soul-eater did not seem to have suffered any heavy injuries, and the top of its head was not at all damaged in the least. But it seemed to be in enormous pain. The faint green light in its eyes grew brighter by the minute, and its entire body started expanding once again.</p>

  <p>Its incomparably vicious Mu Ning began to spread out in all directions, causing the hearts of all the living beings within a radius of ten million miles to sink.</p>

  <p>However, despite this sight, Luo Zheng hardly felt any trace of fear. His body vanished and appeared below the Soul-eater, which was now looming like a giant mountain. In front of this monstrous being, Luo Zheng looked like a tiny sparrow.</p>

  <p>But the tiny sparrow launched a ferocious attack on the behemoth beast, forcefully lifting it up. At the same time, one could hear the painful roar of the Soul-eater.</p>

  <p>Zheng's blow was so enormous that every attack had a painful effect on the Soul-eater. And with each pain, the monster increased in size. So by now, the Soul-eater had become like a giant ball that Luo Zheng kept kicking.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords of both sides looked at Luo Zheng, their facial expressions filled with mixed emotions. They couldn't believe their eyes at the sight they were witnessing.</p>

  <p>"How in the world does he manage to do this?"</p>

  <p>"Has Luo Zheng actually condensed the Godly Tile and become a True God?"</p>

  <p>"That long-haired man is an extremely powerful True God, but he isn't a match for the Soul-eater. Even if Luo Zheng has condensed the Godly Tile, he can't really fight against that monster!"</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords whispered amongst themselves. Zheng's performance was definitely a good news for the Evolutionary Universe. However, this scene was simply too shocking. Even Supreme Lord of Oracle and the others found it hard to accept.</p>

  <p>"No, he hasn't condensed the Godly Tile," Master Feng said, shaking his head in denial. "His Lotus Flower hasn't fully bloomed for him to become a complete Godly Genius."</p>

  <p>As the controller of the Evolution Lotus Flower, Master Feng was very clear on the degree of blooming of every martial artist in the universe, and the Lotus Flowers of the ten Godly Geniuses were his top priorities.</p>

  <p>After returning from the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, barring Luo Zheng, all the Godly Geniuses' Lotus Flowers had bloomed in immediate succession. But this did not deter Zheng's strength.</p>

  <p>"Then how do you explain this marvelous feat? There has to be some major reason behind this!" The Supreme Lords couldn't figure it out despite their vast knowledge. It was all a very appalling matter for them, as they had never experienced such a situation before!</p>

  <p>Blayd's entire body was embedded in an iron cast. He came in this situation after being tackled by Luo Zheng. The blue-clothed woman injected a surge of power inside him, which restricted his movements. It was obvious that the blue-clothed woman did not want him to fight again.</p>

  <p>When he heard the discussions of the Supreme Lords, he only smiled faintly. Although he could speak, he didn't bother to explain it to them.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords of the Sacred race might be the most depressed now.</p>

  <p>Although Mateo had defeated Wynn, he was suppressed by Blayd.</p>

  <p>Therefore, he had no choice but to resort to the Soul-eater Summoning Method. They seemed to be gripped with anxiety. Every time they thought their victory was in sight, someone would suddenly appear and crush their hopes.</p>

  <p>Thump!</p>

  <p>Thump!</p>

  <p>Thump!</p>

  <p>Zheng's every attack made it more painful for the Soul-eater. As the pain became more and more intense, the Soul-eater continuously expanded.</p>

  <p>Soon the Soul-eater had reached a height of over 10, 000 miles that could be compared to the size of a supreme world. Such an enormous creature stood between the heaven and earth, and was visible to many from far away.</p>

  <p>The Soul-eater seemed to have reached the limit of its growth. It was like a ball that was blown up to its full extent. The dark golden skin on its body had already become translucent.</p>

  <p>Compared to such a huge creature, Zheng's image was a minuscule that could be ignored.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng appeared on the giant belly of the Soul-eater. The belly's surface was so large that it could hold tens of thousands of cities. He narrowed his eyes and a mysterious smile appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>"Let's end this. The Soul-eater Summoning Method shouldn't have existed between heaven and earth. It will be a relief to you as well. You will thank me later!"</p>

  <p>After saying this, Luo Zheng knelt down on one knee on the Soul-eater's belly.</p>

  <p>He extended his hand, the tips of his thumb and the forefinger touching the belly, while he raised the other three fingers. He gently drew a cyan line across the belly. In the blink of an eye, the line extended from a few inches to several tens of feet and to several miles.</p>

  <p>Soon, a huge pattern appeared on the belly of the Soul-eater.</p>

  <p>"It's the Soul-eater Removing Technique!"</p>

  <p>"That's impossible! Secondary creatures can't cultivate the Soul-eater Removing Technique. How did he manage to cultivate it in the Evolutionary Universe?"</p>

  <p>"There's something strange and special about him! He can't achieve such a feat!"</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings from the Hall of Holy Beings quickly figured out what was going on.</p>

  <p>Despite the long distance between them and Luo Zheng, they were still able to see that there was something wrong with Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Ouch!"</p>

  <p>When the pattern appeared, the Soul-eater looked even more painful. It furiously flapped its huge arms around its belly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled faintly and disappeared from where he stood.</p>

  <p>In a flash, he appeared next to Blayd. With the blue-clothed woman's highest cultivation level, he was able to freely move around the universe without anyone stopping him.</p>

  <p>"It's all over." Luo Zheng lightly patted Blayd's shoulder, and then leaped up and walked towards the Supreme Lords. However, before he could take a few steps, he suddenly went limp and fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng! Are you all right?" Xun looked anxious as she swiftly stepped forward to help Luo Zheng. The scene that had just occurred had an astounding effect on her.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng got up, he had a depressed look on his face.</p>

  <p>The cultivation of the blue-clothed woman had reached an astounding level. She used his body to resist the Soul-eater without using too much strength, but just with these simple methods, she was able to easily subdue that monster. Her understanding of strength had already reached a level that Luo Zheng could not comprehend.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry. It's over," Luo Zheng comforted Xun as he looked at her anxious face.</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished his sentence, the Soul-eater started to moan again.</p>

  <p>The body that was already unimaginably huge started to swell again. It had already expanded to its limit before, so it could no longer bear further inflation.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Finally the body exploded with an earth-shattering explosion.</p>

  <p>It sounded like hundreds of stars exploding together. Such was the impact of this explosion. The shockwave spread out in all directions, and its power was even greater than before. With the place where the Soul-eater exploded as the center, hundreds of supreme worlds around were completely destroyed. Countless living beings were instantly turned into dust.</p>

  <p>The only ones to survive the explosion were the Supreme Lords from the Evolutionary Universe as well as from the Sacred race. If one were to look down from above, he or she would be able to see that the densely-packed supreme worlds were neatly arranged together like discs. But now the image was scarred with a huge hole in the Thoughtless Minds, which was caused by the explosion of the Soul-eater.</p>

  <p>"It's definitely over," Supreme Lord of Oracle muttered.</p>

  <p>Although there were still over a dozen Supreme Lords and the Grand Supreme Lord of the Sacred race in front of her, the disparity in strength was too great. There was no longer any powerhouse left for the Murphy Universe to fight.</p>

  <p>Master Feng, Supreme Lord of Original Sin, Supreme Lord Mathias, Supreme Lord Amritpal, and the others looked on with an expression of gratitude.</p>

  <p>They once lost all hope of winning this war. Hence they were immensely grateful and relieved to win this war in such a manner. They could proudly admit that it was all because of Zheng's bravery. So much so that the efforts of the Supreme Lords were almost insignificant.</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Lord of the Sacred race looked completely shocked at the spectacle that unfolded in front of him.</p>

  <p>He was the highest ranking Supreme Lord in the Sacred race, and also the possessor of the Heavens-suppressing Object. In the Murphy Universe, he even had the ability to communicate with Murphy, who was the creator. The entire universe was the sole creation of Murphy, including the Grand Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>He never thought that Murphy and the Sacred race would fail so miserably! However, now that the situation had developed to this point, the chances they had vanished into thin air.</p>
