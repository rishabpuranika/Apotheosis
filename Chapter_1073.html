  <p>
</p>

  <p>The air was heavy as silence hung like a thick curtain. Hundreds of warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm stared in marvel at the scene unfolding in front of their very eyes.</p>

  <p>The eyes of the three mighty warriors at the Soul Sea Realm glinted with an ethereal light.</p>

  <p>These three warriors were the leaders of the Jade Martial House? one of them was the head and the other two deputies. In the Harlen Divine Kingdom, they were considered the pillars that held the weight of the whole land in their shoulders. Naturally, they knew well the strength of Randy.</p>

  <p>Randy was a formidable opponent. Not only did he cultivate both body and life vitality, but more importantly, his physical constitution combined with the imperial family's cultivation method could perfectly fuse forceful energy and life vitality. The two forces, when combined together, gave immense power to whoever wielded it. With this fusion, his strength surpassed that of anyone of the same level as him by leaps and bounds.</p>

  <p>Randy had not yet used his trump card. As of this moment, he had only used his fusion technique. However, Luo Luo Zheng had not used any of his special moves as well. He had only used some of his forceful energy and half the power of the dragon scales.</p>

  <p>Just like this, Randy lost to Luo Luo Zheng. The three leaders of the Jade Martial House observed Luo Luo Zheng, pleasant surprise written on their faces.</p>

  <p>'Could this man's talent be ranked in the first tier? Is it possible that his strength would be on par with Lord Randy's and the crown prince's?' they all thought.</p>

  <p>Regardless of whether they believed it or not, they couldn't deny what they had witnessed with their own eyes. This man stood with his victory as clear as day, and they had the inkling that he had more to show them.</p>

  <p>"We misjudged him. This man is simply a monster. I really don't know where he is from!" one of the three leaders said.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! It doesn't matter. His presence will greatly benefit the Jade Martial House. Let us not discuss the disputes between Lord Randy and the crown prince. Since this man is participating in the assessment in the Jade Martial House, he naturally belongs here!" another leader said.</p>

  <p>"We're in luck! Edwin Xiao of the Dark Martial House has overpowered our warriors. Now we have Tianxing Luo. I bet he is no inferior to Edwin," the third leader said.</p>

  <p>Gregory, the number one Virtual Tribulation Realm warrior of the Jade Martial House, stared at Luo Luo Zheng as anticipation raced through him. His face held faint traces of excitement.</p>

  <p>"Tianxing Luo..." The name had a foreign sound, and it was one he had never heard of before. Gregory's heart pounded wildly in his chest. Had the time and place been different, he would have already challenged Luo Luo Zheng to a duel. However, this was the assessment of the Jade Martial House and he was in the presence of the three leaders. He would not mess with the rules.</p>

  <p>Gregory would not mess with the rules of the Jade Martial House. But Randy did whatever he wanted.</p>

  <p>The Harlen Divine Kingdom had many princes, but Randy's status seemed so different from that of the princes who were not favored by the emperor. Half of the Crane City was in Randy's possession. Even the rules bent to his every whim. Who could stop him if he wanted to challenge anyone?</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! Tianxing Luo, right? Good, very good!" A crazy smile appeared on Randy's face as he stared at Luo Luo Zheng. "Since you've already passed the first round of the examination, this matter shall come to an end. Now, I challenge you!"</p>

  <p>As soon as Randy finished speaking, a violent Mu Ning surged forth from his body. Underneath the cover of this energy, the expressions on the faces of the many warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm instantly shifted.</p>

  <p>This was not an Mu Ning that a warrior at the Virtual Tribulation Realm could possess.</p>

  <p>"Lord Randy's true strength must be on par with that of a warrior at the Life and Death Realm."</p>

  <p>"He's really strong. With this much power, even a warrior at the first grade of the Life and Death Realm would be no match for him!"</p>

  <p>"Tianxing Luo is in trouble."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng frowned slightly as Randy's Mu Ning surrounded him. Truth be told, he was quite displeased. Why was this fellow acting like this? He was here to participate in the exam, not to challenge others.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng shook his head and said, "I refuse!"</p>

  <p>Randy was shocked at his answer. "What? Are you being serious? Why do you refuse my challenge? Do you not want a Harlen Token anymore?" he asked him defiantly. Then his expression turned into a knowing smile and he continued, "If you accept, I will give you a Harlen Token. And aside from this, you can choose what you desire from my treasures, regardless of whether you win or lose."</p>

  <p>'Lord Randy's treasures!'</p>

  <p>Everyone's eyes lit up at Randy's declaration.</p>

  <p>Randy had countless rare and precious items. His wealth alone was comparable to what the Jade Martial House had accumulated in all of its years. If Luo Luo Zheng could pick whatever he wanted, he could easily earn in one day the fortune that an ordinary man could only dream of in his lifetime.</p>

  <p>Randy promised Luo Luo Zheng that he could pick whatever he wanted regardless of whether he won or lost.</p>

  <p>Even if he lost to Randy, he had more to gain than lose. His loss would bear him no shame.</p>

  <p>"This is a lucky day for Tianxing Luo!" Everyone eyed Luo Luo Zheng with a mixture of wonder and envy as they thought of the prize that was waiting for him. Anyone of them would jump at the opportunity presented to him.</p>

  <p>To everyone's shock, Luo Luo Zheng still firmly shook his head in refusal. "I would have to decline your offer. I only need a Harlen Token. With my strength, I can get it for myself. I don't need you to give it to me," he said.</p>

  <p>'Who does this arrogant bastard think he is?' Randy inwardly fumed. He thought that he had been more than generous in his offer. Any man would feel honored to be challenged by him. He was Lord Randy! And whichever way the duel turned, whether he won or lost, he would be rewarded handsomely. Why was this man being so stubborn?</p>

  <p>A flaming red crept up Randy's neck and face. His eyes narrowed in anger as he flushed indignantly, like a volcano that would erupt at any moment.</p>

  <p>"Alas! Lord Randy is intelligent, but he is still too young in years," one of the three leaders of Jade Martial House sighed helplessly.</p>

  <p>The other two leaders nodded as well, sharing his sentiments.</p>

  <p id="top_1">Currently, the crown prince and Randy were in competition with one another. They were the two most outstanding young men in the entire Harlen Divine Kingdom, and the future emperor of the divine kingdom might be one of them.</p>

  <p>Randy was younger, but he rose steadily to the first tier. One had to say that his future held a glory more than that of the crown prince.</p>

  <p>The two were similar in strength, but the crown prince was older than Randy by more than ten years, and the difference in age had given him a steady and composed demeanor. The crown prince had not only won over Gregory of the Jade Martial House, but had also won over Edwin, the number one warrior in the Dark Martial House.</p>

  <p>There were only four warriors in the first tier. The crown prince, Gregory, and Edwin were in a group. Randy was alone.</p>

  <p>The most troublesome thing for Randy was that he had no followers. In front of him right now was the perfect target.</p>

  <p>But this man had proved to be increasingly stubborn.</p>

  <p>Randy did not have any malice towards Luo Luo Zheng. He challenged him because he was unconvinced, and at the same time, he also wanted to win over him. Randy was too proud to admit defeat.</p>

  <p>As of the moment, the two men's pride clashed against each other.</p>

  <p>Talents like Luo Luo Zheng almost always had arrogance as great as their skills.</p>

  <p>Randy wanted to use his family background to bend others to his will, and the situation was escalating quickly when Luo Luo Zheng refused him.</p>

  <p>All the three leaders sighed and shook their heads. One of them stepped forward and with a benevolent smile coaxed, "Lord Randy, I know you want to challenge Tianxing Luo today, but this is the assessment. It would be improper to start a fight. There are more fitting times and places. How about you challenge him another day?"</p>

  <p>"Master He!" Randy retorted with a hardheadedness telling of his youth and inexperience. He knew full well that the leader's words were sensible, but he refused to listen to reason despite this fact.</p>

  <p>"Lord Randy, listen to me," Master He smiled meaningfully. The next moment, there were only faint movements of his lips. He was using life vitality to speak to Randy, so the others had no way of distinguishing his words.</p>

  <p>After a long while of what seemed to others as merely tense silence, Randy finally gave a slight nod of his head, and the imposing Mu Ning around his body dissipated. His face relaxed into a calmer expression as he beckoned to Luo Luo Zheng. "I admit defeat. You are indeed a powerful warrior.</p>

  <p>I'd like to make friends with you, Tianxing. I will invite you to my house for a feast some other day!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, on the other hand, stood in bafflement. There was a glaring contrast between Randy's earlier attitude and current one. Who knew what he was up to?</p>

  <p>Of course, Luo Luo Zheng was unsure. There were all sorts of conflicts going on in the divine kingdoms. After he had accidentally shown his strength, he might have unintentionally dragged himself into one of them as well.</p>

  <p>No matter what Randy was up to, it had nothing to do with Luo Luo Zheng. Now, he just acted accordingly. As he was in the Harlen Divine Kingdom, it would do him no good if he embarrassed Randy. Paying his courtesies, Luo Luo Zheng nodded and gave a polite salute to him.</p>

  <p>Only after Randy left did the crowd seem to breathe again.</p>

  <p>In the middle of the seeming calmness, Gregory observed quietly from the side, his eyes following Randy as he left. Then, quietly, he turned to look at Luo Luo Zheng, a trace of vigilance flashing through his eyes.</p>

  <p>Although Gregory was a member of the Jade Martial House, he worked for the crown prince. The conflict between the crown prince and Randy had been going on for a long time. Luo Luo Zheng had appeared out of nowhere and displayed tremendous strength. Whether or not he could win over Luo Luo Zheng was a secondary matter, but such a character would not be allowed to follow Randy.</p>

  <p>He had to inform the crown prince of this matter as soon as possible.</p>
