<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>When Quentin Qin suddenly announced a new rule, the other warriors on the platform shared knowing smiles.</p>

  <p>Anyone who was qualified to enter this platform for Pristine Life Vitality refinement most probably had an extraordinary background.</p>

  <p>The warriors were angry that Luo Zheng had nabbed away the Pristine Life Vitality produced by this round of Tidal Surge. But if this man was wise enough and left the Pristine Life Vitality behind, then he wouldn't cause too much trouble. They hadn't actually lost anything.</p>

  <p>They were still in the territory of the Skyland race after all. It was true that many forces from the divine land tried their best to make friends with the Skyland race. Even though they had gained in convenience from the Skyland race, it was impossible for them to be too arrogant and despotic here.</p>

  <p>Quentin Qin suddenly invented such a rule. Smart as they, these warriors immediately understood what his real purpose was.</p>

  <p>It was not his goal to chop off the feet of these fellows.</p>

  <p>They were just a few secondary creatures. Who the hell knew where these creatures originated? What was the point in chopping off their feet?</p>

  <p>He thought it troublesome to do so even once.</p>

  <p>As for what these secondary creatures had in their hands, they didn't even care about at all.</p>

  <p>The only thing that caught their eyes was the method that Luo Zheng had displayed just now!</p>

  <p>When one stood on the platform, a divine texture would appear at one's feet upon appearance of the Tidal Surge.</p>

  <p>No one knew who set up these platforms in the first place. However, this was the only known way to extract Pristine Life Vitality from these divine textures.</p>

  <p>The size of the platform and one's strength would determine how many black crystals would be refined.</p>

  <p>The warriors on this platform were mostly from the divine land.</p>

  <p>Occasionally, some young men from the Skyland race came to join them, but the difference between them wasn't that great in refining the black crystals. Someone might refine thirty to forty black crystals once, while some ten to twenty black crystals.</p>

  <p>However, the fellow that Han Liusu brought was a little out of the ordinary!</p>

  <p>With his refinement, he had produced three to four thousand crystals. In other words, he had taken away all of the Pristine Life Vitality on the platform.</p>

  <p>The warriors of divine land were also astonished.</p>

  <p>They had always looked down on secondary creatures. How could they be willing to show that they were impressed by this puny being?</p>

  <p>However, they could not deny to themselves that they were shocked at this. But at the same time, they began to think over the problem.</p>

  <p>Since Quentin Qin made up a rule to break the feet of these people, his goal was most probably Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>They did not guess wrong.</p>

  <p>Quentin Qin was really interested in Zheng's ability. If he could control that ability himself, he could monopolize a platform and increase the speed at which he absorbed Pristine Life Vitality by a hundred times. Why not?</p>

  <p>He wouldn't need to stay on the largest platform; even if he could occupy a smaller platform, it would be enough. In any case, no one else had the ability to compete with him.</p>

  <p>Kurt's, Lucille's, and Lone's expressions darkened, when they heard this.</p>

  <p>After they entered the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, they understood their status of being a secondary creature. If they wanted to cultivate and raise their strength, they had no choice but to endure everything. They had to put in a lot of effort to enter the Skyland race.</p>

  <p>Among them, Lucille had spent three months and Kurt had spent two months. Lone took the longest time and had spent a total of four months before he obtained a precious purple trial tally.</p>

  <p>Even after entering, they were still bullied.</p>

  <p>They didn't even want to consider the biggest platform. In the beginning, even the small platform at the edge of this place had warriors that drove them away.</p>

  <p>However, these few people had extraordinary talent. Someone who had cultivated to the state of being a Godly Genius was not someone that could be easily ignored, even in the divine land. The weakness of the three of them was their low cultivation. Most of the people here were Spirit Transformation Realm warriors, but the three of them were stuck at the middle or late stage of the Spirit Supreme Realm.</p>

  <p>As they worked hard, their strength increased gradually. They began to change platforms frequently as they gained more and more Pristine Life Vitality.</p>

  <p>However, the three of them still didn't dare to step onto the platform in the middle.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng appeared, the three of them all stepped forward one after the other in an attempt to lead him away. They hadn't thought that Quentin Qin could say such words. He was simply too much of a bully!</p>

  <p>Lone barely managed to summon a smile as he said, "Master Qin must be joking. We won't take away all of this Pristine Life Vitality, so why is it such a serious matter?"</p>

  <p>However, Quentin Qin's expression was nothing but serious. A bit of malice made the corner of his mouth lift. "I, Quentin Qin, have never joked about such an important matter. How can you, a secondary creature, have the ability to ascend this platform?"</p>

  <p>As he finished his words, he waved his hand gently. A bit of life vitality condensed slowly and formed a sword that was as thin as a cicada's wing. "Are you going to chop off your feet by yourself, or should my blade make you confess?"</p>

  <p>The sword light was discreet and contained a hidden sharpness.</p>

  <p>However, Quentin Qin did not have the slightest intent to kill. In his eyes, these secondary creatures were insignificant beings that would surrender if intimidated!</p>

  <p>However, he still had to assume a fighting posture as if he meant it.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, how could he use this as a threat to interrogate Luo Zheng?</p>

  <p>If these people really didn't know what was good for them, then Quentin Qin had another plan in mind. If he ended up killing these people, the Skyland race shouldn't cause any trouble for him. After all, the Skyland race still needed the Qin Clan...</p>
