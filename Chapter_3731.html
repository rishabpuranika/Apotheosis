  <p>
</p>



  <p>
</p>

  <p>It was known that before the human civilization came to life, the Element Spirit Civilization was relatively open.</p>

  <p>In fact, they even "helped" other civilizations that just arrived at the Other Shore back then.</p>

  <p>However, the price for their "help" was that those civilizations could not threaten the Element Spirit Civilization. Besides, as the second civilization, the Element Spirit Civilization had many advantages, thus they were much more powerful than the other civilizations.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the concept of the Finale Way had already existed in the first few chaotic eras. But the members of the Element Spirit Civilization internally agreed that it was a ridiculous idea.</p>

  <p>All the time, the whole Element Spirit Civilization only watched the other civilizations struggle on the Other Shore amusingly.</p>

  <p>It wasn't until the birth of the human civilization that the Element Spirit Civilization felt a sense of trepidation.</p>

  <p>Most civilizations felt that to step into Stage Thirty-three was enough to prove their strength. After all, it wasn't easy for even the Chaos Ancient Gods or the Wing King to explore that stage much deeper.</p>

  <p>Indeed, there were only about eight races that had reached the innermost part of the stage, the Jade Pure Realm, up until now. Those eight races were quite ancient and were considered legendary.</p>

  <p>That was also the reason why the Augury Dog was surprised.</p>

  <p>"I believed that our human race was extraordinary when I obtained the unique information from the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Tree. However, I didn't expect that you would reach the Jade Pure Realm…" At that moment, the Snake Goddess' eyes glinted.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the Primeval Lord of Heaven looked calm. He shook his head and said, "Truth be told, it isn't that none of those civilizations that came after us couldn't surpass our human civilization— it's just that the Element Spirit Civilization never gave them a chance."</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess nodded firmly and added, "If they finish the Purge Way as they planned, then there will be no chance for the entire chaos to survive in the end."</p>

  <p>A faint smile graced the Primeval Lord of Heaven's face. "That's not necessarily the case. The degree of chaos will always increase and never decrease. According to their plan on the Purge Way, it will only greatly delay the development of chaos..." he said.</p>

  <p>In general, all the activities in the world were in constant chaos. Every time another round of chaos began, the degree of chaos always increased.</p>

  <p>If only ten thousand creatures were to survive the Purge Way of the Element Spirit Civilization, then the increase of chaos would naturally slow down.</p>

  <p>However, as long as even one creature was alive, then it would always increase.</p>

  <p>Perhaps after thousands of chaotic eras, the Finale Way would still need to be done...</p>

  <p>Therefore, the Primeval Lord of Heaven reasoned that the Purge Way of the Element Spirit Civilization was not a solution, but a way of delay. Whatever was supposed to come would still come.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing the Primeval Lord of Heaven's words, the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, Zheng, Pearce, and the others present also felt quite enlightened.</p>

  <p>Although all of them firmly believed in the Finale Way, some part of them agreed with the concept of the Purge Way and thought that it was another way to save the chaos, even if it was too cruel.</p>

  <p>Based on the Primeval Lord of Heaven's analysis, they understood that Yellow Thearch and Divine Farmer had chosen the wrong path from the very beginning, and that path was destined to fail.</p>

  <p>"It's a pity that Divine Farmer and Yellow Thearch stubbornly chose the wrong course," said Pearce with a shake of his head.</p>

  <p>"Some people are just like that. They could never realize that they are wrong by themselves. They need to be slapped awake," Fuxi said nonchalantly.</p>

  <p>Pearce's face lit up when he heard Fuxi's words. "Are you saying that you people of Pear Hill will take action?" he asked.</p>

  <p>After the Oneness Sky Palace and the Bearing race had a fall-out with each other, they only had the occasional trivial fights. Also, Pear Hill had never fought head-on because there were rules. As a result, the Sun Crow race launched a surprise attack, and the Oneness Sky Palace almost suffered a catastrophe.</p>

  <p>Thus, the Oneness Sky Palace must be lying if they ever said that their people felt no resentment at all.</p>

  <p>Then again, they had no other choice but to endure as Eastern Emperor Taiyi was still trapped.</p>

  <p>But, it was true that they would be happy if Pear Hill did do something.</p>

  <p>"If Pear Hill kept tolerating them, of course, they would come to torment us someday. Actually, when the Sun Crow race took action this time, it meant that the war had begun.</p>

  <p>The most important reason is that what they are doing currently is completely unbearable," said the Snake Goddess. "What? What they are doing now?" Pearce asked cautiously.</p>

  <p>"They used a strange kind of flame to burn many provinces of the Source World. That flame didn't damage the warriors at the Chaotic Source Realm, but the ordinary creatures at or below the Other Shore Realm. They have already set fire in three hundred provinces in succession," the Snake Goddess explained.</p>

  <p>"What? How could they do such a brutal thing?"</p>

  <p>"Why did they do that? Is it just to clean up those big provinces?"</p>

  <p>"Is Yellow Thearch crazy?"</p>

  <p>The strong warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace felt distressed at the news.</p>

  <p>Even if the Bearing race was quite powerful, they couldn't just slaughter lives recklessly like that!</p>

  <p>While everyone was still confused, Master Hai, who was on the far left of the Supreme Dragon Hall, suddenly said, "Usman, I'm afraid that's their purpose."</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess nodded at him, which showed that he was right.</p>

  <p>Master Hai's reminder made the powerful warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace quickly realize why the Bearing race did such a thing.</p>

  <p>"Trigger the negative emotions of the Source World!"</p>

  <p>"Have they got Usman?"</p>

  <p>"The Yellow Thearch's plan all along was to control the entire Source World through Usman..."</p>

  <p>At that point, everyone's fears and anxieties further intensified.</p>

  <p>Now that the Oneness Sky Palace and Pear Hill could ally with other super forces to fight against the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race, the outcome of the battle was hard to predict. After all, both sides were on the same level.</p>

  <p>But if Yellow Thearch took control of the Source World, it would be as if he started a war on a higher level, wherein he would launch much deadlier attacks.</p>

  <p>"Although Usman is the incarnation of the negative emotions of the Source World, he is still just an incarnation. Whether or not he can shake the will of the Source World is only a guess, and nobody knows if he would succeed.</p>

  <p>Everyone, calm down," the Snake Goddess said and raised her hand to placate everyone present.</p>

  <p>The Source World was the primitive land of this round of chaos. Its will was superior and unfathomable.</p>

  <p>Yet, ever since Usman was born, many wise warriors had made assumptions, such as one might be able to control the Source World through its negative emotions.</p>

  <p>Before the current situation, everyone else thought that such an assumption was only a theory— but now Yellow Thearch began to try it out.</p>

  <p>"It seems that things don't look good," someone sighed.</p>

  <p>Many of the people's faces dimmed at the comment.</p>

  <p>Zheng, who had been quietly standing at the side, suddenly smiled and said,</p>

  <p>"The situation might be not as bad as you think.</p>

  <p>Now that we have Descending Rings, we will be able to summon a powerful warrior from the Other Shore!" "Which stage of the Other Shore does the warrior you said we could ask for help come from?" the Snake Goddess asked as she gazed at him with her beautiful eyes.</p>

  <p>"We can summon Ziya, who is King Manard I told you about last time," answered Zheng.</p>
