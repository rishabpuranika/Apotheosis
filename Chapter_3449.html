</p>

  <p>"The second stage is called 'Integrating Inner and Outer.' Let me show you," said King Manard. He made a pinching motion above Zheng's head and took away the long sword in his hand.</p>

  <p>King Manard gripped the sword and emitted a steady flow of energy in three colors, which was transferred through the hilt into the blade. As the energy flowed, the sword glowed, becoming more and more dazzling. In this manner, he gave the sword the inner power in a short period of time.</p>

  <p>When he was done, he held up the sword, examining it.</p>

  <p>Then he threw it back to Zheng. "Here, take a look."</p>

  <p>Zheng caught the sword easily, his eyes gleaming as he studied it. "This sword is now as powerful as a primary Profound Blood Treasure!"</p>

  <p>King Manard was unfamiliar with the classification of weapons in this round of chaos. But he had confidence in the weapons he had forged.</p>

  <p>He nodded. "After I comprehended the Truth of Three-Energy Construction, it took me a long time to reach the stage of 'Looking Alike in Appearance.' But you've reached it within a short period of time. You are a great genius. Do you have a master?"</p>

  <p>His words piqued the attention of the Regal Jade Spirit and No. 9527. It seemed that King Manard was interested in taking Zheng on as his disciple.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded and replied, "Yes, I do."</p>

  <p>Zheng had a master in the great world. One of his missions was to go to the Source World from the divine land to inquire into the whereabouts of his master Bromley.</p>

  <p>But up to now, Zheng hadn't been able to find him.</p>

  <p>From the day he became Bromley's disciple, he had yet to see him, which was truly incredible.</p>

  <p>As soon as King Manard heard that Zheng had a master, he dropped the subject, although he was slightly disappointed. He said, "All right, then. At least we are both human beings, and I need you to find the humans of the Other Shore. I used to be an extremely powerful king. However, my disciples and children had been gone with the passing of that round of chaos. The fourteen disciples I selected from the inner world are not able to inherit my cause..."</p>

  <p>The handsome man and the charming woman looked at each other. They both seemed a little embarrassed.</p>

  <p>"The third stage of the void construction is 'Constructing with One Thought.' Even though you don't know the structure of some things, you will be able to form them as soon as you think about them. What's more, they'll be real like those existing in reality," King Manard continued. "You can even create someone who is exactly the same to you."</p>

  <p>"Constructing with One Thought..." Zheng murmured, trailing off.</p>

  <p>It was hard for him to imagine what kind of realm that would be.</p>

  <p>Even those powerful civilizations on the Other Shore couldn't reach this stage, let alone the Chaos Ancient Gods who had just mastered the truths.</p>

  <p>It was not a truth-level theurgy. It was just an unreasonable theurgy.</p>

  <p>Unless the entire chaos turned into one's own inner world, it was impossible for them to reach this stage.</p>

  <p>Zheng was certain that even King Manard couldn't do it.</p>

  <p>Previously, Zheng had thought that the Truth of Three-Energy Construction was at the same level as the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent. But if one reached the third stage, the value of their Truth of Three-Energy Construction would probably be much higher than that of other Truths of Godly Ways!</p>

  <p>"If you can't reach this stage of the void construction, it can't be regarded as a powerful method. I've only reached the second stage after years of cultivation," King Manard admitted.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded in agreement.</p>

  <p>It seemed that the void construction wouldn't be greatly useful in a real battle.</p>

  <p>But King Manard added, "However, we can use such a theurgy in an inverse way!"</p>

  <p>He stretched out his hand and pinched the air, then he took back the sword that he had given to Zheng. With a gentle stroke, the sword became riddled with holes that turned into clouds of black energy, and finally turned into three kinds of energy in red, yellow, and blue.</p>

  <p>"Wow!" Zheng was very interested.</p>

  <p>Since the Truth of Three-Energy Construction could be used to construct articles in the void, it could also split articles in the void, returning them to their original nature.</p>

  <p>"To clarify, this kind of theurgy can only be used to restore the things built through the Truth of Three-Energy Construction?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>King Manard smiled. "Of course not," he replied.</p>

  <p>He stomped lightly on the ground, and a brick spiraled up. "Take a look.</p>

  <p>This brick was deleted into this space by a Son of Truth."</p>

  <p>King Manard waved his hand, and the brick was smashed into pieces, then crumbled into sand. But it didn't stop there. The sand continued to be split apart, its materials returning to their most basic state. The sand separated into two kinds of auras in black and white, then dissipated further, until they had turned into a mass of murky brown gas.</p>

  <p>Zheng recognized the gas at once. This was chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>King Manard smiled at the expression on Zheng's face. "Do you want to learn this theurgy?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Of course, Zheng had no intention of passing up this opportunity. He cupped his hands and bowed to King Manard. "I do. I would appreciate it if you kindly decided to teach me!"</p>

  <p>While King Manard thought highly of Zheng, he certainly still had some reservations about him. It was in the king's nature to be skeptical, and he was incapable of completely trusting someone he had only recently met.</p>

  <p>Zheng was still in many ways a stranger to him.</p>

  <p>But Zheng was from the same race. This made King Manard more inclined to look favorably on Zheng's appeal. He was also interested in teaching Zheng because he thought highly of his talents, and indeed still felt a twinge of regret that he couldn't have Zheng as his disciple.</p>

  <p>At this point, Zheng was in no hurry to return to the Source World. He had all the time in the world to learn this unusual theurgy.</p>

  <p>The theurgy that King Manard taught him was called the Endless Restoring Method. It allowed a person to restore something to its most basic forms after touching it.</p>

  <p>The harder the material of the object, the easier it would be to restore.</p>

  <p>When his cultivation began, Zheng took out things like water, wood, and paper from his inner world, and attempted to restore them. It was a lot more difficult than it seemed. The Endless Restoring Method seemed simple and effortless, but the task of restoration was quite complex.</p>

  <p>It took at least three months before Zheng achieved his first small success.</p>

  <p>A year passed before Zheng succeeded in entirely restoring a solid rock.</p>

  <p>After one and a half years, he managed to restore gold and iron.</p>

  <p>And so the days and months slipped by, with Zheng focused entirely on mastering the Endless Restoring Method.</p>

  <p>Without even realizing it, Zheng had stayed in this space for over three years.</p>

  <p>At the end of that period, he comprehended around eighty percent of the Endless Restoring Method. King Manard was surprised and pleased. It usually took much longer to reach that level.</p>

  <p>Even in the 77th civilization, Zheng still stood out among his peers because of his extraordinary talent.</p>

  <p>King Manard reflected that given the speed with which Zheng had previously cultivated the Truth of Three-Energy Construction, he really should have expected Zheng to excel in the Endless Restoring Method too. He had seen various extraordinary talents over the course of his life, and he was one of the powerful warriors who followed the great human ancestor.</p>

  <p>In the void, four people stood without moving.</p>

  <p>King Manard, the handsome man, the charming woman, and Zheng had gathered together.</p>

  <p>Many little monsters surrounded them in the ruins.</p>

  <p>These little monsters obeyed the handsome man and the charming woman, but they worshiped King Manard. After all, it was King Manard who had created them.</p>

  <p>"You were deleted into this area. And I will send you back via this area now. Please remember my words," said King Manard solemnly.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded respectfully. "I will keep them in mind."</p>

  <p>Although King Manard was not Zheng's master, he had taught Zheng a lot, and Zheng would not forget his generosity.</p>

  <p>The handsome man and the enchanting woman had spent almost every day and night of the past three years with Zheng, and there was a trace of reluctance on their faces as they prepared to send him off.</p>

  <p>"Good. I will find that time node for you," King Manard said. With that, he stretched out his hand and stirred the air. A colorful vortex appeared within his moving hand. In an instant, it sucked Zheng in.</p>
