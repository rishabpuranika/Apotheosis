<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1771 Luo Zheng's Son </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>After all these years of training, Frank was able to control his mind and stabilize it. It was as calm as the sea. He also knew that the rebellion led by his father had almost ruined the entire Zhuo Clan.</p>

  <p>He didn't know whether he still hated Luo Luo Zheng or not; all he knew was that he was like a tiny worm in front of Luo Luo Zheng. Therefore, he wasn't angry at all when he saw Luo Luo Zheng again. Instead, he was quite shocked.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng?" Frank stood there in a daze.</p>

  <p>When the Zhuo Clan warriors behind him heard this, they were also equally stunned.</p>

  <p>Only then did others recognize Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"It's really him!"</p>

  <p>"He's actually back."</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng is back!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was not from Cloudy City, but this did not prevent him from becoming the hero of the city. Warriors of the city not only worshiped him, but also showed him off to outsiders.</p>

  <p>At first, everyone was a little nervous. This group of mighty warriors could easily destroy the Cloudy City. So how could they dare to speak carelessly?</p>

  <p>However, they weren't as nervous after hearing Luo Zheng's name. After all, he used to be a member of Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng looked at Frank with indifference. Since the entire Zhuo Clan had received their due punishment for their rebellion, he wouldn't care about this matter anymore. He nodded to Frank casually and said, "Let's go to the Cloud Hall."</p>

  <p>"I'll lead the way," said Frank immediately. He had also seen Mu Ning in the crowd. After he saw Tianming, his heart was filled with shock once again.</p>

  <p>He was not acquainted with Mu Ning. After all, when she entered the Cloud Hall, she stayed by Luo Zheng's side throughout and rarely went out. But he was quite familiar with Tianming and was aware that he had received a great deal of attention from the Cloud Hall. But how did his cultivation reach such a level?</p>

  <p>He couldn't even figure out what level Tianming's cultivation was at because Tianming was now much stronger than him.</p>

  <p>He was confused, but he did not shoot his mouth off. In the end, he came to a conclusion that this was not an ordinary group of people.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! Is this where you used to live, Luo Luo Zheng?" After controlling for a long time, Lawson finally couldn't hold it in anymore.</p>

  <p>He and Nathan had come to this great world to accompany Lucille and join in on the fun.</p>

  <p>The ace talents and Godly Geniuses of the four great clans had been isolated from the outside world. They rarely went out, and even after leaving the clans, the place of the lowest level they had seen was a tenth-grade sacred place. Almost all the people they had encountered were at least at the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>At this moment, they felt that they had arrived at a very special habitat.</p>

  <p>There were many warriors at the nature level and they were all incredibly weak.</p>

  <p>"A world of ants!" Nathan could not help but snigger.</p>

  <p>The Zhuo Clan martial artists were leading the way. Hearing their conversation, Frank and the others were extremely nervous. Just who were these people? Why did these two fellows sound so intimidating?</p>

  <p>Could it be that Luo Luo Zheng was being held hostage? All these people must be from the Upper World.</p>

  <p>However, nobody dared to refute or debate with them. They were indeed not much stronger than ants in these people's eyes.</p>

  <p>"If you two are going to continue with this nonsense, then scram back to the Upper World!"</p>

  <p>Mu Ning turned her head and scrunched her eyebrows as she reprimanded them.</p>

  <p>She was from this great world too and hated how these two people were looking down on the world where she was born and raised.</p>

  <p>She knew that Luo Luo Zheng did not like these two fellows, but they were still guests. Ning Yudie was being hunted down, and they would be waiting here to help her, and maybe the duo would be able to help them. After all, their strength could not be underestimated. But their personalities were somewhat annoying.</p>

  <p>Xi Youqin's words had the desired effect. Lawson's only response was a rude snort, while Nathan remained silent.</p>

  <p>This scene immediately changed Frank's opinion. He had a whole new level of respect for Mu Ning. However, they knew too little about the Upper World, and their guesses were completely inaccurate.</p>

  <p>News of Luo Zheng's return had spread like wildfire in the Central Region.</p>

  <p>The original group of warriors was now being followed by a massive crowd.</p>

  <p>Of course, only those warriors who were at the Illuminating Soul Realm and above were able to fly. Warriors under the Illuminating Soul Realm could only look up at the sky and sigh wistfully. They didn't have the chance to see the number one warrior of the Central Region.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Luo Zheng entered the Cloud Hall, he saw a flame rising from not too far away, followed by the wails of some people. Strangely, a child's laughter could also be heard at the same time.</p>

  <p>A puzzled expression appeared on Luo Zheng's face as he asked, "Who dares to cause trouble in the Cloud Hall?"</p>

  <p>The current Cloud Hall was considered to be the number one sect in the Central Region. Who could have penetrated the great sect-protecting array set up by Luo Luo Zheng and dared to cause trouble there?</p>

  <p>A bitter smile appeared on Frank's face. After enduring for a while, he said, "Go take a look for yourself and you will know."</p>

  <p>On his way back to the Cloud Hall, Luo Luo Zheng planned to meet Imogen first and settle this group of Godly Geniuses. Then, he would closely monitor the entire great world. No matter where Ning Yudie went, he would take action immediately.</p>

  <p>With his curiosity taking over, he kicked the floor and floated toward where the wails came.</p>

  <p>What he saw was a boy clad in golden brocade clothes. In his hand was a divine texture of raging flame, which was constantly emitting flames as it burned the house in front of him.</p>

  <p>The house was sealed shut with divine textures, making it impossible for the people inside to escape. The temperature of the house was like an oven? one could only imagine how hot it must be inside. That was why so many screams could be heard.</p>

  <p>The people in the house were crying and begging to be let out.</p>

  <p>However, the boy showed no mercy at all. With a flick of his finger, the flames within the divine texture swirled towards the house like dragons made of fire. He was extremely skilled at manipulating the fire.</p>

  <p>With a frown, Luo Luo Zheng floated over and hissed in a low voice, "Stop!"</p>

  <p>When the boy heard Luo Zheng's voice, he turned around. A trace of wickedness flashed across his clear eyes. The divine texture in his hand rolled towards Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>A long flaming dragon charged towards Luo Luo Zheng, engulfing him within itself.</p>

  <p>The boy laughed fiendishly. "I'll turn you into a roast chicken!"</p>

  <p>However, when the flames dissipated, the boy was stunned. The scene he had envisioned did not happen. The person in front of him was completely unharmed.</p>

  <p>The power of this divine texture was unbelievable. Once it was activated with life vitality crystals, even a Virtual Tribulation Realm martial artist would be unable to withstand it. This was the first time the boy had experienced such a pushback.</p>

  <p>"What's your name?" Luo Luo Zheng asked as he glared at the boy.</p>

  <p>The boy blinked and smirked. His slender fingers had already locked onto another divine texture. "What's it to you!?" he spat.</p>

  <p>"Is your... surname Luo?" Luo Luo Zheng asked again.</p>

  <p>The boy smiled triumphantly. "Yes!"</p>

  <p>As his voice faded, he took advantage of the opportunity to flip another divine texture token. A bolt of lightning shot out from it.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Luo Luo Zheng raised his head and waved his hand. The powerful bolt of lightning split apart, and his expression turned sour.</p>

  <p>    </p>
