<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The earlier one learned the space rule, the better it was.</p>

  <p>The truth was, Luo Zheng himself didn't understand what it meant to learn something about the space rule.</p>

  <p>As the four people went through the transmission channel, the light around them suddenly switched off. They had finally arrived at their destination.</p>

  <p>The other end of the transmission channel was also a platform situated on a small hill. There were stretches of historical remains around this hill.</p>

  <p>The remains seemed to have been there for thousands of years, and most of the houses had already collapsed. It was hardly visible that a huge palace used to stand there.</p>

  <p>Kenneth Shi held the three and left the platform. They flew following the direction of the ruins.</p>

  <p>Some black dots were seen far away in the sky. As the dots grew larger, Luo Zheng saw they were actually a group of people.</p>

  <p>The group's leader was someone with unfathomable strength. By Zheng's estimation, the man was almost at the same level as Kenneth. The nine people following him were all beginners in the Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>All of them looked outstanding from ordinary warriors, and it was easy to see they were the top ones at their levels.</p>

  <p>"Kenneth, hi. Why are you coming so early this year?"</p>

  <p>The head of the group greeted Kenneth with laughter.</p>

  <p>But when he saw the man, Kenneth smiled coldly. He was not friendly with the guy.</p>

  <p>The group leader was named Eddy Wei. He held the same position as Kenneth Shi. Both were sent-out stewards of the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>The Cloud Hall was a sect in grade four. There were several sects in grade one or two in the charge of the Cloud Hall, and they sent talents to the Cloud Hall each year. For example, the Cloud Sect was a sect in grade two in the charge of Cloud Hall. Kenneth not only headed the Cloud Sect but was at the same time a sent-out steward of the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Eddy Wei was the head of another sect in grade two, the Red Sect.</p>

  <p>Although both the Red Sect and the Cloud Sect were in the second grade, their positions were entirely different. The distinction was seen through the number of disciples attending the Cloud Road from each sect.</p>

  <p>There were nine disciples following Eddy. All of them were beginners at the Illuminating Soul Realm. And they were all the disciples attending the Cloud Road.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, only three disciples followed Kenneth.</p>

  <p>Without any explanation from Kenneth, the three realized the vast difference between the two sects.</p>

  <p>Although both in the same grade, the Red Sect was based in the Central Region. The region was more prosperous, populated, and stretched out more. Naturally, the outstanding talents would have much more than those from the Cloud Sect in Eastern Region.</p>

  <p>It was, therefore, reasonable that there were more disciples with superior strength in the Red Sect, and the Cloud Hall allotted more slots to the Red Sect for the entry into the Cloud Road.</p>

  <p>But the Cloud Hall was not to blame for this situation. It was but natural to distribute more resources to teams with a greater number of stronger members. The case was similar to that of the All Peaks Competition and how it treated the Drizzle Peak. There were dozens of people from other peaks, such as the Skytop Peak to attend the competition, but there were only eight from the Drizzle Peak. And the difference in numbers was based on the average strength of the disciples.</p>

  <p>Obviously, there was competition between Eddy and Kenneth. Both were stewards of the Cloud Hall. The more outstanding disciples a sect found, the more commendable the sect's head was.</p>

  <p>In the years before Luo Zheng arrived, Eddy had always been winning. The numbers and quality of disciples from the Red Sect were better than those from the Cloud Sect in Eastern Region.</p>

  <p>But things changed last time when a disciple named Evan, from the Cloud Sect, participated in the trial of the Cloud Road.</p>

  <p>The disciple was hailed the champion of the All Peaks Competition last time with an absolute advantage. And he should have achieved an excellent performance in the Cloud Road test. Kenneth had high expectations for him, hoping he could perform better than the disciples from the Red Sect. Unfortunately, Evan fell asleep while on the Cloud Road.</p>

  <p>Because of this, Eddy laughed at Kenneth many times to mock him. And this was the start of animosity between the two men.</p>

  <p>The performance of disciples who attended the Cloud Road trial was very critical to the grade two sects that they represented. However, equally crucial was the qualifications and the number of disciples selected for the Cloud Hall. If there were more disciples, who could pass the Cloud Road trial successfully, the head of their sect would be given a higher ranking, and could also receive extra rewards.</p>

  <p>Although Kenneth didn't reply to Eddy, it did not stop his nemesis from talking. He gave the three disciples behind Kenneth a good look, surveying them from head to foot, before giving the Cloud Sect leader a sarcastic smile. Finally, he said, "Kenneth, correct me if I'm wrong. The Cloud Sect in Eastern Region seems to have gotten worse over the years.</p>

  <p>Am I right that your situation has become so bad?"</p>

  <p>Of the three disciples Kenneth brought this year, only one was at the Illuminating Soul Realm— Patrick Pei. Tianming was at the consummation of the nature level. The most unexpected of them was Luo Zheng, who was only in the third grade of the nature level. In the eyes of their opponents, who didn't know the facts, this was a joke.</p>

  <p>Disciples behind Eddy were also discussing this. "I noticed it a moment ago. Do you think their Cloud Sect is still a grade two sect? Don't they have millions of disciples? Couldn't they have found three in the Illuminating Soul Realm?" one of the nine disciples asked, as he lowered his voice.</p>

  <p>"Maybe they can't. The Eastern Region is an untamed land. The best warrior in that place is probably at the Illuminating Soul Realm now," a second disciple offered.</p>

  <p>Laughing, one said, "The most ridiculous of them all is the one at grade three of the nature level. There's no mistaking that he's only in the third grade of the nature level. If he were a member of the Red Sect, he would not even qualify as an inner disciple. I'm quite envious of him, though. If I had known all that, I would have sent my little brother to the Eastern Region. He would surely top them all with a great advantage and have a chance to be part of the Cloud Road. My brother is only a little weaker than me and didn't enter the top ten. So, he does not have the chance to enter the Cloud Road. Damn! This stupid guy in their Cloud Sect is quite lucky!" another disciple said aloud.</p>

  <p>After Eddy's words, the disciples behind him started to whisper among them and their voices became louder gradually.</p>

  <p>Kenneth was not an even-tempered man. But because of his arrogance the last time he had prematurely declared their victory, which turned out to be embarrassing. At that time, he said he was certain that Evan could win the championship. When this did not happen, Kenneth ended up being ridiculed. So, in the meantime, he decided to shut his mouth from then on. He had a lot of faith in his three disciples. 'Let's see who's going to get the last laugh.</p>

  <p>The idiots from the Red Sect really think I am so good-natured like the Bodhisattava made of mud?</p>

  <p>These little guys are just beginners in the Illuminating Soul Realm. What gives them the right to say mean things about my disciples in front of me?' Kenneth thought unhappily. As the head of the Cloud Sect, Kenneth could be unprincipled when it came to protecting his disciples. So it was a great shame for him that Yan was taken by others. But in the eyes of other sect leaders, they felt it was reasonable since this was something they couldn't prevent from happening.</p>

  <p>He snorted loudly. "You little guys! Just shut your mouths!"</p>

  <p>After he finished speaking, Kenneth threw off incredible energy towards the disciples.</p>

  <p>Seeing what just happened, the faces of nine disciples turned pale.</p>

  <p>Kenneth was a warrior of the Internal Elixir Realm. His Mu Ning could press them to death!</p>

  <p>But just as quickly, a yellow light curtain appeared as Eddy waved his hand. It halted most of Kenneth's Mu Ning. With a smile, Eddy said,</p>

  <p>"Kenneth, don't be so serious. The young men were only discussing among themselves. Don't mind what they're talking about."</p>

  <p>This time, Eddy let the term "young men" pass. But Tianming and Patrick refused to allow Kenneth to face an awful situation.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Zheng was the champion of the All Peaks Competition, both Tianming and Patrick regarded him as their head. So, the two turned to look at Luo Zheng for guidance.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng continued to think about the space rules after he emerged from the transmission array. He was far from looking sharp and kept looking around all the time. Patrick and Tianming had no idea where Zheng's mind had gone off.</p>

  <p>The young disciple was slightly stunned. After he saw a bit of the space rule, he didn't feel any difference when he was in the transmission channel. But now, since he came out of the transmission array, he suddenly felt different.</p>

  <p>He felt a tremendous change in the space around him compared to what it was before.</p>

  <p>Every single thing seemed to have a distinct outline, and what Luo Zheng saw with more clarity was that everything around him was three-dimensional, allowing him to get the exact measurements— height, length, and width— of everything.</p>

  <p>What was happening now must have been an impact of the Space Law he had learned. Initially, he thought it wouldn't be of any use to him at all. But now, Luo Zheng felt his mind was all messed up, and he could not concentrate at all.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng! Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>Two hands were patting him on the shoulders.</p>

  <p>"What?" Luo Zheng snapped out of it.</p>

  <p>Then he noticed Tianming and Patrick were saying something to him.</p>

  <p>But Zheng's behavior had the disciples of the Red Sect bursting into laughter.</p>

  <p>"Ha ha ha! The little guy at grade three of the nature level looks so foolish! He seems to be having some problem with his head!" one disciple said while laughing.</p>

  <p>"I guess so," another one agreed, and continued with a laugh, "I really wonder how the stupid guy will take part in the trial of the Cloud Road."</p>

  <p>The disciples from the Red Sect were overjoyed. Zheng's behavior greatly amused them, and also further boosted their confidence.</p>
