  <p>David had felt the Truth of Cultivation Nature from Luo Zheng but it was not because he had an understanding about it.</p>

  <p>In the Yellow Emperor race, there were two exiles who had cultivated the Truth of Cultivation Nature. David naturally had a deep impression on it.</p>

  <p>Just now, he had observed Luo Zheng and had felt the same aura coming from him.</p>

  <p>David was not yet too sure, so he couldn't help but inquire about it cautiously.</p>

  <p>"Is it strange?" Luo Zheng just smiled vaguely.</p>

  <p>The smile he gave signified an affirmative answer.</p>

  <p>David's eyes sparkled and his gaze on Luo Zheng changed again.</p>

  <p>His first impression of Luo Zheng was that he was just a Wild God with extraordinary talent.</p>

  <p>He prided himself as powerful enough and thought that there was still an insurmountable gap between his strength and Luo Zheng's.</p>

  <p>What he witnessed had totally changed his own insight. He had already regarded Luo Zheng as a man in his league.</p>

  <p>"It really surprises me. No wonder you could defeat Lisa and Jerome so easily," David complimented as he smacked his lips.</p>

  <p>He had never thought that there would be another guy in this world who was as capable as him to cultivate the Truth of Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>"But you can't still beat me," David confidently stated.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>The Yellow Emperor Wild Body of David released a dazzling golden light.</p>

  <p>Once the Wild God Power was released from his body, there was another unique aura that followed.</p>

  <p>"This aura is another kind of Truth of Divine Dao." Luo Zheng felt the unique aura, and his eyes narrowed.</p>

  <p>He had known five Truths of Divine Dao: the Truth of Goodwill and Malice, the Truth of Dark and Light Chaos, the Truth of Cultivation Nature, the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, and the Truth of Holy Words.</p>

  <p>He had learned the Truth of Goodwill and Malice from Harper. He hadn't mastered it completely yet, but he was almost there. Besides, he had already mastered ninety-nine percent of the Truth of Cultivation Nature.</p>

  <p>It was once said that twelve Truths of Divine Dao had appeared in the divine land. A book titled 'Twelve Abridged Truths of Divine Dao' had circulated among the people in the divine land. The book had provided them some insights and knowledge about the certain information.</p>

  <p>As for how many kinds of Truths of Divine Dao there were in the Source World and the chaos, Luo Zheng had no idea.</p>

  <p>Each Truth of Divine Dao was a path to the other shore. The purpose alone had gathered countless number of people through painstaking effort to achieve that goal.</p>

  <p>It was not just a method to become the True Gods and reach the other shore but also served as an extension of the Grand World Cultivation Method.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the Truth of Divine Dao that David emitted was a bit like the Space Divine Dao. Luo Zheng guessed in his mind and didn't expect him to speak it out himself.</p>

  <p>"The mind method that I learned from my master is the Truth of Void Destruction," David said, pointing the sharp knife in his right hand to Luo Zheng. "My master has sternly forbidden me to use these methods to cope with the enemy, so I've never displayed them in front of other people.</p>

  <p>You know, I didn't need them at all."</p>

  <p>There were deep meanings in what David said.</p>

  <p>Lisa and Jerome were situated in a distance. As they heard David's words, their expressions had changed several times.</p>

  <p>During a previous battle, Jerome was defeated by David. David then became the most popular person in the Yellow Emperor race.</p>

  <p>But Jerome was still not convinced. He believed that David just won by a neck, and there was only a narrow gap between them at that time.</p>

  <p>He had continued to practice very hard, hoping to defeat David one day in the future.</p>

  <p>Not until now did Jerome realize that David didn't even use his real strength during their fight, as confirmed by his words.</p>

  <p>"But you are different." David smiled seriously. "I believe my master won't blame me."</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, he flashed away and disappeared in front of everyone.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng wasn't able to detect him. In this case, he wasn't the only one.</p>

  <p>Adele, Giacomo, and the powerful Wild Gods of the Yellow Emperor race like Lancelot also couldn't find David's location.</p>

  <p>'The Truth of Void Destruction? With it, one can hide in the space of the chaos?'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng gazed at the now empty spot where David disappeared from and thought to himself.</p>

  <p>He was no stranger to the Space Law since he had the Space Divine Dao stored in his Infinity Ruler.</p>

  <p>The only difference was that the Space Law was a law in the universe, and the Space Divine Dao was a space law in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Did that mean that the Truth of Void Destruction was a space law in the chaos?</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>In a flash, the figure of David appeared on Luo Zheng's side and fiercely wielded his knife at him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had managed to avoid the attack in time and retreated. The Eight Smoky Melodies that had integrated the Truth of Cultivation Nature had helped him detect the sudden attack.</p>

  <p>But this time, David came well prepared.</p>

  <p>The moment he had thrust out his knife, spider-web-like cracks appeared on the blade. The cracks spread in a space and then broke into pieces.</p>

  <p>"Splash!"</p>

  <p>The space crunched rapidly and formed an absolute void.</p>

  <p>The void then exuded an invisible force. It attracted everything surrounding, which was almost irresistible.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, who just retreated, was suddenly pulled back.</p>

  <p>"You can't escape this time!" David cried out with a smirk. He shot towards Luo Zheng with a sharp knife on his right hand.</p>

  <p>Seeing that there was no room for him to dodge this time, Luo Zheng snorted.</p>

  <p>He immediately twisted the long sword in his hand. The sword directly swayed at David.</p>

  <p>"Clang! Clang! Clang!"</p>

  <p>David's sharp knife clashed against Luo Zheng's long sword. They attacked in close proximity to each other and continuously fought with their weapons.</p>

  <p>Despite their huge bodies, they could still fight at a dazzling speed within a small range.</p>

  <p>The people of the Yellow Emperor race and the Nine Li race were all dazed. It was difficult for them to tell who had the advantage. They only knew that in this level of battle, just with slight carelessness of anyone, the outcome and even life and death would be determined.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng is not using his soul force," Romeo muttered as he quietly watched the scene.</p>

  <p>"It seems that he doesn't go all out. He wants to take advantage of this opportunity to train himself," Elsa also stated with a complicated look.</p>

  <p>They were also the talents in the Nine Li race, respected by countless people, and doted upon by their race.</p>

  <p>But compared with Luo Zheng and David, they were hardly worth mentioning.</p>

  <p>"There's something wrong with David's weapon." Adele's eyes were fixated on David's knife. A trace of worry gradually appeared on her face.</p>

  <p>Adele's observation regarding David's knife had been, in fact, noticed by Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Every time his long sword collided with David's sharp knife, he had noticed a faint white light spot, which quickly gathered in the middle of his knife and formed a bright white light ball.</p>

  <p>Under the fierce collision of the two weapons, the white light ball was getting more and more eye-catching on the black knife.</p>

  <p>The smile on David's face became more and more proud. He was rejoicing in his mind that Luo Zheng was slowly falling into the trap he had set up.</p>

  <p>"Turn to the void!"</p>

  <p>David laughed ferociously as the light ball released a blinding light. He then lifted up both of the two sharp knives in his hands.</p>

  <p>At this moment, there seemed to be two suns rising brightly on the sky.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng quickly retreated seeing this change. Upon his retreat, a ray of light appeared on the Godly Tile in his inner world.</p>
