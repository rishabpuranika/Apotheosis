<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3914 Activate The Array </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>While isolating the freezing air from the Pear Hill, Yan also activated the energy flow of the Cloud Cover Array.</p>

  <p>Not only did the members and disciples of the Pear Hill live in the Pear Hill, there were also many mortals there who could not cultivate.</p>

  <p>The temperature did not drop all that low when the frigid air reached the edge of the Pear Hill.</p>

  <p>Even so, for those mortals, it would still be a fatal exposure.</p>

  <p>Sensing this, Yan frowned and aimed her energy at the huge creature above!</p>

  <p>The mission Yan had been given by the Snake Goddess was to amass the power of Pear Hill and do all that was needed to protect it.</p>

  <p>However, till now, she had been running a defensive movement only.</p>

  <p>After suffering fierce attacks for half a day, she finally had the chance to strike back. Naturally, Yan poured out masses of energy without any hesitation!</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh…</p>

  <p>Huge golden light blades formed and shot upwards.</p>

  <p>The energy contained within those golden light blades couldn't be underestimated, not even by the Chaos Ancient God.</p>

  <p>Hiss...</p>

  <p>Lamont hovered in the sky and suddenly opened his mouth, taking a deep breath. His huge belly bulged even more.</p>

  <p>Swoosh...</p>

  <p>The air, which had been sucked into his stomach, suddenly spewed forth again.</p>

  <p>The cold air erupting out from the huge body was enough to create a freezing hurricane.</p>

  <p>However, the chill was not as fierce as the others had feared. Instead, it formed a gentle white zone of cold beneath him.</p>

  <p>When the golden blades entered this zone, they lost momentum, slowed down, and finally stopped. The golden light of the blades' surface suddenly dimmed, and the blades completely melted away in this cold band.</p>

  <p>The golden blades possessed energy at a fiery temperature. Though they melted, they also reduced the cold air by several degrees.</p>

  <p>Yan's face darkened slightly. She flicked her hands, and more golden light blades appeared, shooting outwards.</p>

  <p>No matter how powerful the strength of the Chaos Ancient God was, the truth power he possessed was limited. Given the massive divine crystals in the Pear Hill, Yan could naturally squander them at will!</p>

  <p>The golden light blades surged up like a kaleidoscope of butterflies, quickly melting through the cold area!</p>

  <p>After completely heating up the cold band, more golden light blades shot towards Lamont with a violent intent.</p>

  <p>Lamont merely looked down at Yan in silence. His originally motionless body suddenly disappeared, and then reappeared on the top of the Pear Hill.</p>

  <p>He was only one million feet away from Yan!</p>

  <p>Everyone knew that Lamont was ten million feet tall. One million feet was only a small step for him!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The instant he appeared, Lamont was already swinging his fist towards Yan's head.</p>

  <p>"Yan!"</p>

  <p>Seeing this dilemma, Zheng was shocked, and the hair on his body stood on end.</p>

  <p>Yan was not at the Eternal Realm, so her physical strength was barely stronger than that of an ordinary Chaotic Source Realm warrior.</p>

  <p>Not to mention taking a full blow from the Chaos Ancient God, even if she was hit by only one of Lamont's fingers, she would be smashed to pieces!</p>

  <p>Facing Lamont's attack, Yan didn't panic.</p>

  <p>She reached out her hand, gently stroking the golden dress. A golden shield suddenly enveloped her with a protection radius of hundreds of thousands of feet. Zheng on the jadeite platform was also enveloped inside.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Lamont's punch struck the shield, making a booming sound.</p>

  <p>The golden shield, which was fortified and sturdy, merely vibrated slightly.</p>

  <p>Then Yan waved her hands, and the golden blades fired forth from the Energy Shaft, traveling at great velocity!</p>

  <p>Because of the small distance, the first three golden light blades instantly ripped into Lamont's chest.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>With three muffled sounds, three huge and bloody holes appeared on Lamont's chest. Blood gushed out from the holes like a triple waterfall, and the smell of blood pervaded the Pear Hill.</p>

  <p>Lamont clearly hadn't expected the power of these light blades to be so massive. He had no option but to flee far away in pain!</p>

  <p>Obviously, Yan didn't intend to let him off so easily. As long as he was within the Pear Hill, he was within range of her attack.</p>

  <p>The endless light blades hotly pursued Lamont. With these continuous explosions, a series of golden lights bloomed in the sky.</p>

  <p>Zheng breathed a sigh of relief. The Cloud Cover Array the Snake Goddess had set up was still powerful, and even the Chaos Ancient God wasn't able to destroy it so easily.</p>

  <p>But at this point, an old voice suddenly sounded in Zheng's ear. "Zheng, if Lamont draws near again, we must seize the opportunity to activate the Divine Crystal Array to trap and kill him in the Pear Hill."</p>

  <p>The whisper was the voice of King Ieuan.</p>

  <p>It indeed presented a great opportunity when Lamont got so close just now.</p>

  <p>But while Zheng was worried about Yan's safety, he had completely forgotten about it.</p>

  <p>Although King Ieuan controlled the entire Divine Crystal Array, it couldn't activate it, and only Zheng had the power to do that from the jadeite platform.</p>

  <p>King Ieuan could only remind Zheng kindly.</p>

  <p>"I see." Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>From above the Divine Crystal Array in the Pear Hill, King Ieuan also nodded to the other creatures.</p>

  <p>The idea of building the Divine Crystal Array had been King Ieuan's proposal, but to perfect and establish it had still depended on the Snake Goddess. Even the Other Shore Tokens of the several creatures that were in charge of the Divine Crystal Array were searched and obtained by the Snake Goddess and Fuxi in Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>It was also due to the combined power of these Other Shore Tokens that the power of the Divine Crystal Array could be swung into play.</p>

  <p>Lamont retreated a short distance and roared at the sky. The muscles in his chest wriggled and then healed themselves.</p>

  <p>It was obvious that he was not as cautious as Othniel. The human girl wasn't even at the Eternal Realm, but she had actually hurt him. It was proving a great humiliation!</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A circle of white cold air emanated from Lamont's body. In a moment, an armor of solid ice formed on the surface of his body, and thus armored, he pounced on Yan again.</p>

  <p>Despite Yan's golden light blades being extremely powerful, Lamont still intended to fight her head-on!</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom...</p>

  <p>When the golden blades collided head-on with Lamont's armor, something strange happened. As the golden light blades impacted on the armor, their lights flashed and disappeared!</p>

  <p>Other Chaos Ancient Gods might not dare to resist the golden light blades as Lamont did, but his armor was the nemesis of all pure energy.</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...</p>

  <p>Yan hurled out over a hundred golden light blades in quick succession, but they were all absorbed by Lamont's solid ice armor.</p>

  <p>Seeing Lamont's huge body dashing over, Yan had no choice but to employ the golden shield again.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The golden shield vibrated, but it was still stable.</p>

  <p>Lamont didn't show any mercy at all. He stretched out his fists, and even his fist shadows smashed at Yan from all directions!</p>

  <p>Bang, bang, Bang...</p>

  <p>As tens of thousands of punches landed against the golden shield, the shield trembled more violently.</p>

  <p>Yan's face became pale, and panic could be seen flashing in her eyes.</p>

  <p>Each punch could obliterate her. If the golden shield was broken, she would definitely perish, and even her brother would not be able to survive.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, Yan remembered the Divine Crystal Array...</p>

  <p>In a panic, she looked at Zheng.</p>

  <p>It was not difficult for Zheng to activate the entire Divine Crystal Array; however, the one who really controlled it was King Ieuan below.</p>

  <p>He sat cross-legged on the jadeite platform, with his hands on it. The green luster of the platform quickly gathered in his hands.</p>

  <p>The jadeite platform began to slowly rotate. The entire Divine Crystal Array became like a massive hungry beast that began to devour enormous amounts of divine crystals.</p>
