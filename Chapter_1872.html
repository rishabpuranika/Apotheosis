  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Skyland warriors were much more taciturn compared to the Collapsing Mountain warriors.</p>

  <p>They finally entered the Skyland race's territory with the Skyland warriors' guidance.</p>

  <p>There was no terrifying attraction force in the Skyland race's land but its buildings were rather strange.</p>

  <p>Numerous towers littered the area and underneath was pitch-black marsh.</p>

  <p>Quite a few people crouched on top of each tower with their white wings unfurled, forming a sea of feathers up high.</p>

  <p>A few Skyland warriors would also graze the ground as they flew past.</p>

  <p>While the Collapsing Mountain race focused on the relentless pursuit of strength, the Skyland race yearned for the skies and freedom.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land was a giant cave, so they could never really reach the skies. This was why the Skyland race loved hearing stories of the worlds beyond their land and welcomed warriors of other races.</p>

  <p>All the stories and experiences of outsiders served to make the Skyland warriors excited for the sights outside of their knowledge but also envious since it was highly unlikely for them to ever experience the same thing.</p>

  <p>The Skyland warriors were very much interested in exploring the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land and hoped to one day attain the opportunity to leave this cave.</p>

  <p>It was no surprise that the Collapsing Mountain race was very warmly welcomed by the Skyland race.</p>

  <p>The towers all around them were arranged in an orderly fashion but in differing heights. The height of each tower signified the status of the Skyland warriors that perched on each one.</p>

  <p>The higher one's status was, the higher the tower was.</p>

  <p>The highest was around ten thousand feet higher than the lowest.</p>

  <p>It was in the tallest tower that the Skyland race hosted its visitors.</p>

  <p>At nightfall, the Skyland warriors returned to their lair, led by a man who wore a golden crown. He was none other than the leader, Kaydan.</p>

  <p>Kaydan immediately fixed his eyes on Luo Luo Zheng the moment they were introduced.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was a key figure and Kaydan felt it necessary for him to personally observe this person who had been much talked about by the Collapsing Mountain race.</p>

  <p>He waved his hand lightly and a bright, yellow flame appeared in his hand.</p>

  <p>Despite being a key figure, Luo Luo Zheng was still a lowly Spirit Supreme Realm warrior in his eyes, so he was preparing to throw the flame on the young man directly.</p>

  <p>This obviously displeased Luo Luo Zheng. Nobody liked getting burned.</p>

  <p>Kaydan's flame was transformed by the life vitality activated by the Law Power and looked very ingenious. Still, Luo Luo Zheng remained unyielding. He was not afraid of it but he wasn't also going to let it burn him without saying a word.</p>

  <p>After his stay with the Collapsing Mountain race, Luo Zheng's strength had undergone a complete, dramatic change.</p>

  <p>He had initially been too weak and was constantly bullied by the other members of the race. Now, however, he was finally strong enough to fight back.</p>

  <p>Chapman quickly realized the situation and was the first to step in.</p>

  <p>"Kaydan, please wait!"</p>

  <p>The Skyland race leader's eyes flashed. "Why? What's wrong?"</p>

  <p>Chapman was in a bit of a bind. Kaydan's status did not warrant him to grant any respect to a random Spirit Supreme Realm warrior, so it was understandable why he did what he did. However, this was Luo Luo Zheng they were talking about. Chapman should've explained Luo Zheng's strength to him beforehand. "Luo Luo Zheng belongs to our Divinity Hunt Squad."</p>

  <p>His words were cryptic but all he was really trying to say was that Luo Zheng's strength was so formidable that he had the qualifications to enter the Divinity Hunt Squad. In short, he was up to par with their race's top warriors.</p>

  <p>Kayden, however, still did not understand. He figured that the only reason Luo Luo Zheng could join the Divinity Hunt Squad was that he was fireproof.</p>

  <p>There was no way a young man like this had the strength to actually match Chapman and the others.</p>

  <p>"That's not important right?" Kaydan asked.</p>

  <p>Chapman could see the way the flame on Kaydan's hand throbbed. He quickly stood in front of him. "Luo Luo Zheng obtained the title of 'wild king' during our test."</p>

  <p>His words shocked Kaydan greatly. "You must be joking, Chapman!</p>

  <p>Wait, this guy isn't really fireproof, is he? You're just playing with us, right? The Harmony race will arrive in a few days. You'll have to take responsibility for playing such tricks on us!"</p>

  <p>He did not believe Chapman's words at all and the Collapsing Mountain race leader's inability to explain things in a straightforward manner only added to his suspicions. What he couldn't figure out was why Chapman had to lie to him about this.</p>

  <p>Chapman smiled. It was partly his fault that Kaydan misunderstood. "I'm telling the truth!"</p>

  <p>Despite the seriousness of Chapman's words, a trace of doubt remained in Kaydan's eyes. "It doesn't matter if it's the truth or not. I'll personally try it myself. Don't try to stop me."</p>

  <p>"I'm not trying to stop you. I just wish you'd ask Luo Zheng's permission first,"</p>

  <p>Chapman replied.</p>

  <p>He knew Luo Luo Zheng wasn't aggressive nor bad-tempered but he was still someone who should be given due respect. This wasn't a dialogue between the strong and the weak and they could not easily ignore Luo Zheng's thoughts on the matter. Besides, Chapman had the lingering suspicion that the young might be way stronger than him.</p>

  <p>Kaydan finally understood Chapman's intentions. He then wondered if Luo Luo Zheng really was that important.</p>

  <p>The situation greatly irked Kaydan. "Brat, I've been told that no flame could ever harm you. I want to test this with my flames. Can I do that?"</p>

  <p>Though his words were rude, Kaydan was already showing great respect by speaking to Luo Luo Zheng like this. He was the leader of the Skyland race after all.</p>

  <p>But Chapman knew something terrible was about to happen when he heard Kaydan's words.</p>

  <p>Before he could say anything, Luo Luo Zheng had already given his answer. "I refuse," the young man said with a smile.</p>

  <p>The other senior Skyland members gasped at Luo Zheng's insolence. They didn't think he'd outright refuse their leader's request!</p>

  <p>Kaydan raised an eyebrow and laughed coldly. "You're only a warrior from another race. Do you honestly think that you have the qualifications to refuse?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng remained calm and collected. "The qualification can be obtained by means of strength. It's not something that you can determine so rashly."</p>

  <p>Even the Collapsing Mountain members were surprised at this show of hostility from the young man.</p>

  <p>However, they had all been witnesses to Luo Zheng's strength firsthand.</p>

  <p>They had no idea where he got it from, but the way he fought against the Martial Sacred Beast simply left a deep impression in their hearts.</p>

  <p>Chapman suddenly felt that it was his role to diffuse the situation, but Kaydan already beat him to it. "Then let's see if you have the strength to fight for it!" the Skyland leader declared in a cold voice.</p>

  <p>In the end, Kaydan couldn't help but take action!</p>

  <p>He pointed his finger at Luo Luo Zheng and the yellow flame transformed into a thin, fiery snake that shot straight towards the young man.</p>

  <p>Each universe had slightly different rules but these rules were made by Holy Beings. Each world built by them was always under the influence of the divine land, so the difference between worlds and creatures wasn't too great. Kaydan believed that Luo Luo Zheng was just an ordinary warrior like most of them and would also be burnt by the fire.</p>

  <p>The Skyland members all waited for the result. They all thought that Luo Luo Zheng was too arrogant and reckless for his own good. If he survived their leader's flame, then that meant he was truly fireproof. If not, then he deserved to burn to death.</p>

  <p>Han Liusu sat silently beside Luo Luo Zheng. The flame which headed towards him looked stronger than the one from the Calamity Dispelling Wood.</p>

  <p>However, it was nothing compared to her special flame. There was no way it was going to harm him.</p>

  <p>However, she also figured that Luo Luo Zheng wasn't going to let the flame touch him at all anyway.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stood on the spot, unmoving. However, in a split second, he activated the nine stars and let them flash.</p>

  <p>He had already used one-third of the nine stars' strength that day and he discovered that that power wasn't something that could be obtained without limits. The more he used it, the dimmer the light became.</p>

  <p>However, there was no need to use so much power anyway. Just thirty percent was enough to deal with the troublesome fiery snake.</p>

  <p>This strength of the nine stars turned into a solid shield in front of him that devoured the fiery snake fully.</p>

  <p>Kaydan pulled a long face. With a heavy swipe of his finger, he let out multiple fiery snakes all at the same time. Their color also changed from bright yellow to deep red. He wasn't pulling his punches this time around.</p>

  <p>However, the result remained the same. Luo Luo Zheng seemed to have an invisible wall in front of him that absorbed Kaydan's snake projectiles every time.</p>

  <p>"Do I have the strength and qualifications?" Luo Luo Zheng asked indifferently.</p>
