<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3403 Sculptures </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As Zheng paced around the cave, he walked towards a corner and observed the sculptures on the walls.</p>

  <p>The sculptures varied in forms, figures, and creatures. From cattle, to snakes, to birds. The sculptures were unique in their own ways.</p>

  <p>Sadly, none of the sculptures was the Dreaded Eye Demon. Zheng knew what he was looking for, especially since the Dreaded Eye Demon was hard to miss as it was only an eyeball. Zheng had prior knowledge to them when he integrated with the Eye of Will.</p>

  <p>"These sculptures are exactly the same as those in the Sacred Mallow Temple," Zheng pointed out, nodding his head in approval.</p>

  <p>The members and disciples of powerful forces never settled at the Stage One for long. As for Zheng, he only entered the temple because some humans had invited him.</p>

  <p>Chaim was also an exception to this. He had just entered the Other Shore, and grew curious about the place. Once, he entered the Sacred Mallow Temple, too.</p>

  <p>"But why are all these sculptures here?" Dorothy asked, curious to know more.</p>

  <p>She had been through a lot in the past. The first time she entered the Sacred Mallow Temple, she had struggled and was nearly killed inside.</p>

  <p>"The risky thing in the Sacred Mallow Temple was the Soul Purifying Light, which could kill all the Souls of Light," Zheng comforted her. "Good thing we don't have that here." He paused and looked back at Dorothy.</p>

  <p>"What I don't understand is how the Chaotic Source Spirits have something to do with the Dreaded Eye Demons..."</p>

  <p>This bothered Zheng, especially because these were two completely different races.</p>

  <p>Because he didn't have enough information, he couldn't understand. More so for the others, who had no clue about anything.</p>

  <p>The group had made it to the end of the cave. Though there were eight other pathways around the cave, they only motioned downwards. It meant that these passages were probably connected to the other eight entrances at the bottom of the main peak.</p>

  <p>"The Chaotic Source Spirits must be hiding up here." Elvinia nudged above.</p>

  <p>"I'm sure that we'll find our way out if we break the cave ceiling."</p>

  <p>The Chaotic Source Spirits had the ability to cut the rocks and moved in and out as they pleased. If it wasn't difficult for spirits, it should be possible for the group to do the same.</p>

  <p>As Zheng, Chaim and the others thought of more plans, another group of people came through another passage.</p>

  <p>They were from the Bearing race and the Sun Crow race.</p>

  <p>When they met eyes with Zheng and his companions, their eyes widened in surprise. The silver haired young man in the lead, Khalid, was carrying a long spear on his shoulder. He squinted in arrogance.</p>

  <p>"Interesting," muttered Khalid. "It saddened me that I didn't come cross you guys earlier. I didn't expect to see you here at all." Khalid smiled, but his kindness remained questionable. Just then, he lightly tapped on the spear, and it suddenly shook while a wisp of white light wrapped itself around the weapon.</p>

  <p>Just as Khalid was about to make a move, another group of people appeared from another passage. They were from the New Moon race and the Divine Farmer race, and they didn't seem to be pleased either.</p>

  <p>The man called "Mount" from the Divine Farmer race, stood at the forefront of the group. On his shoulder was a little girl named Mya, who had long, curly hair and a snarky expression.</p>

  <p>When the two saw Zheng and Elvinia, they smiled at each other in eagerness.</p>

  <p>"Uncle Mount, are you going to fight with them right now? What a coincidence! The two people on the first row, right here, at the same time..."</p>

  <p>Mya said this in hushed tones, keeping her expression hidden behind her curly locks of hair.</p>

  <p>Mount narrowed his eyes and gave Zheng and Elvinia a good look.</p>

  <p>Aside from fusing with Chaotic Source Spirits, he planned to get rid of these two as well.</p>

  <p>If they had obtained enough Chaotic Source Spirits, they would have already attacked Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, they were on the lookout for the Chaotic Source Spirits that had disappeared. They couldn't afford a delay. Also, hosting a battle in a cave was not the best course of action right now.</p>

  <p>Mount was a steady and prudent person. He wouldn't challenge someone without full preparation.</p>

  <p>"Let's wait a while," Mount decided. "Our main goal is still to retrieve the Chaotic Source Spirits. We can't go back empty-handed. They can live a little longer," he chuckled, drawing away from Zheng and the rest.. He looked around, scanning the cave, when the strange sculptures caught his sight.</p>

  <p>Khalid suddenly spoke up. "The Chaotic Source Spirits are surely important, but killing the good-for-nothings from the Oneness Sky Palace is proper business. If you don't want to take action against them, I'll take matters into my own hands." He was not as scrupulous nor as patient as Mount. Eagerness flashed in his eyes as his spear vibrated on his shoulder.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Elvinia, Dorothy, Chaim, and the rest of their group were distraught.</p>

  <p>They knew they were outnumbered and their opponents were strong, so they were at a disadvantage.</p>

  <p>Zheng, being the leader of the group, took a step forward and calmly said, "In my opinion, generally speaking, most people who describe others as good-for-nothings are just cowards. If you want to prove yourself so bad, you can do better than just spitting nonsense!" He let out a laugh.</p>

  <p>Khalid, on the other hand, was not impressed with Zheng at all. To Khalid, Mount, Mya, the only person they should be cautious with was the young man in black. Zheng and Elvinia were nothing but prey to them.</p>

  <p>In any case, they already ruled out the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace because they seemed too weak. They thought they would just endure all kinds of sarcasms without talking back!</p>

  <p>However, they were surprised to see Zheng speak up so confidently. Khalid chuckled and said, "I'm really surprised. After so many years, the Oneness Sky Palace finally has a member with balls." He gestured towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Since it seems like you're eager to die, don't mind me being rude."</p>

  <p>After he said that, he gently pulled out the white, magnificent spear from his shoulder. As the tip of the weapon swept the ground, the rocks beneath it were sliced right at the middle. This spear's sharpness was no laughing matter.</p>

  <p>"You? Rude?" Zheng raised his eyebrows, questioning this arrogant man before him. As he said so, the tip of the Snow Sword slowly stretched out from his space ring. He took hold of it and pointed it towards the members of the Bearing race and the Sun Crow race. Pleased with their reactions, he said, "This has nothing to do with manners." He looked at everyone in the eye, and then gave a wink at Khalid. "It's just, well, none of you can leave here alive."</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, the diamond-shaped Civilization Artifact in his inner world began to move.</p>

  <p>Once it was completely unraveled, it resembled a spiky ball.</p>

  <p>To add, the unique aura of Regal Jade Civilization gave out in full bloom, which added to the artifact's extraordinary impression.</p>

  <p>"You arrogant bastard!"</p>

  <p>"You just want to die!"</p>

  <p>"We won't hesitate to kill you!"</p>

  <p>The members of all four races, the Bearing race and the Sun Crow race included, roared in anger.</p>

  <p>In an instant, Khalid, Mount, Mya were smiling no longer.</p>

  <p>They realized that they had just underestimated Zheng.</p>

  <p>After all, the young man in black who they had feared the most, was a creation of Zheng's inner world.</p>

  <p>But these people weren't going to back down now. They had been through hell and back, so they had no reason to retreat now.</p>

  <p>Besides, they still outnumbered Zheng and his companions by a large number, so they still stood with great leverage.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>The tension in the atmosphere thickened as a battle was just around the corner.</p>

  <p>But just as everyone took their battle stances, footsteps echoed throughout the cave.</p>

  <p>One more group came through another passage.</p>

  <p>"Brother!"</p>

  <p>The group that emerged was the Snake Goddess race, led by Yan.</p>

  <p>They would have been the first to enter, but Yan spent too much time catching Chaotic Source Spirits, making them the last to arrive.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Zheng was safe and unharmed, Yan was more than delighted. She was relieved as she strode forward to give him a hug.</p>

  <p>The Pear Hill had the most members, so they had the advantage of calling the shots. Though they were hit by the hurricane, they could easily gather quickly and continue moving.</p>

  <p>Members of the Snake Goddess race and the Oneness Sky Palace gathered together, impressively outnumbering the Bearing race and the other three races altogether.</p>
