<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 215 The Phoenix Crystal And The Emerald Crystal (Part Two) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"This spear is named Tronson and is also a top-grade spiritual weapon.</p>

  <p>The crystal embedded in the spear point is an Emerald Crystal.</p>

  <p>Complemented with the Emerald Crystal, Tronson had the strongest penetrating effect and could easily penetrate an enchanted barrier,"</p>

  <p>Spencer said patiently.</p>

  <p>"Penetrate an enchanted barrier?" Luo Zheng stared at the crystal with interest.</p>

  <p>After getting locked in the box several times, he had become wary of Yolande's transparent enchanted barrier. Even if he got his hands on a weapon like Tronson, it was possible he would be unable to break her enchanted barrier. However, if he encountered other ones in the future, it could prove to be a handy weapon.</p>

  <p>Spencer nodded. "Yes. Emerald Crystal's strength has a strong influence.</p>

  <p>Tronson was destroyed by the demon king Sheen. In those years, Sheen had mastered the skill of the enchanted barrier. Initially, the powerful men of Illuminating Soul Realm in White Emperor City could do nothing to Sheen, but the Emerald Crystal broke through his enchanted barrier. At long last, Sheen was defeated, but unfortunately, in the process, Tronson too was destroyed..."</p>

  <p>Looking at the pieces of the broken Tronson, Luo Zheng could readily imagine the intensity of the battle.</p>

  <p>"I will take this one too," Luo Zheng stated, pointing at Tronson.</p>

  <p>"Of course. I will take it out for you in a while." Spencer smiled. "There is another crystal left. Would you like that too?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng glanced at the remaining weapon that hung on the wall - a formidable broken ax. He shook his head. The crystal on the ax radiated with a brilliant light, but Luo Zheng only had two rows of runes on his arms that could inlay two crystals. The extra crystal would be impractical.</p>

  <p>After choosing the two crystals, Luo Zheng walked down further.</p>

  <p>The kind of riches the treasure house was heaped with were far beyond Zheng's imagination. Besides all sorts of weapons, there were different types of defense treasures, jade symbols, hidden weapons, pills, and so on.</p>

  <p>It boggled his mind. The treasury had almost everything in it, and each of the resources was valuable. Luo Zheng was nearly dazzled as his eyes scanned the hall.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, he only had one spot left. If the two crystals he chose weren't helpful to him, he would return one of them.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng sought for a long time and finally fixed his eyes on a small, inconspicuous box, probably used to store pills. He stared at it for a while before reading the words on the box out loud. "Nirvana Pill."</p>

  <p>With a cautious expression on his face, he asked, "Is this the grade 6 Nirvana Pill concocted by the legendary pill refining master Churchill?"</p>

  <p>Among so many pills, Luo Zheng had the sagacity to pick this one. He certainly had a good eye. Spencer smiled ruefully. There were all kinds of fortunes in the treasure house of the imperial army, but only a dozen of them were truly valuable, and the Nirvana Pill was one of them.</p>

  <p>If one took the Nirvana Pill, he or she would be recovered of all wounds, no matter how dangerous they were. As long as the person had breath and could swallow the medicine, he would become right as rain in an instant. The pill could also cultivate the soul. If the soul was damaged or hurt in any form or manner, the Nirvana Pill could repair it.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the Nirvana Pill could raise the consumer's strength to three levels. A warrior at the fifth step into the nature level could be promoted to the eighth step within three days after taking the pill.</p>

  <p>The pill was exceptional magic but also had a fatal flaw. It could only be used by a refiner below the Illuminating Soul Realm, and was quite unusable to a powerful man of the Illuminating Soul Realm, such as Spencer.</p>

  <p>Even so, the pill attracted the greedy eyes of the noble clans.</p>

  <p>Many large families would donate a large quantity of life-saving objects to cultivate their elite disciples.</p>

  <p>The Nirvana Pill was undoubtedly the best of the lot. It could cure the wounds of the body as well as raise strength in a short amount of time.</p>

  <p>Regrettably, the creator of the Nirvana Pill, Churchill, died at an early age, when he was just 43 years old. Warriors commonly had long lives worth hundreds of years, but Churchill was short-lived, so he left only a few Nirvana Pills behind.</p>

  <p>Its number had dwindled over the years as they were taken, so the pill had become rarer to find in the market. Initially, it didn't have a high cost, but it went up all the time. Today, a Nirvana Pill was worth nearly one hundred thousand cubic crystals. It was beyond the purchasing capacity of a nature creature.</p>

  <p>More often than not, it was the elder of a family who bought the Nirvana Pill to give to the elite of a young generation.</p>

  <p>The one who bought it didn't eat it, and the one who ate it didn't buy it, which meant that the Nirvana Pill's price had gone through the roof.</p>

  <p>"This Nirvana Pill will be my third choice," Luo Zheng announced, nodding with satisfaction.</p>

  <p>Truth be told, Spencer had planned to secure the pill for a younger elite in his family. As long as the young man gained some sort of accomplishment in the imperial army, the pill could be rewarded to him.</p>

  <p>But now, Luo Zheng had picked it as his own, as one of the three treasures Spencer had promised him. As the governor of the imperial army, Spencer couldn't go back on his word, so he just nodded reluctantly.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eye was far too clever.</p>
