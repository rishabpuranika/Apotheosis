<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>A bell rang in Zheng's mind when he saw the woman's face. He recalled seeing her when he first stepped into the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>The first time that Zheng saw this woman, she was standing next to the human war general named Dylon. However, that time, she was completely silent during Zheng's unpleasant encounter with Dylon.</p>

  <p>The famous Purple Heart Sacred Place might be a prominent place, but it didn't leave a good impression on Zheng. If the place was full of idiots like Dylon, he thought that there was no need to have further contact with any of these idiots again.</p>

  <p>Therefore, when the woman approached him, he instantly felt annoyed and acted rudely.</p>

  <p>The woman's name was Olivia Xia, and she was extremely angry at Zheng's attitude.</p>

  <p>She was a ninth level war general of the Purple Heart Sacred Place and deserved a better treatment. Yet, Zheng regarded her as a prostitute. A woman of her status must be treated with utmost respect and she couldn't tolerate the disrespect of Zheng towards her.</p>

  <p>However, she also couldn't afford to lose her composure. She tried to suppress the fury in her heart. She took a deep breath and heaved heavily.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, the anger in her eyes disappeared. Then she suddenly started laughing, "Ha-ha! I'll tell you now, I don't think someone like you can afford me. I am quite expensive. Better yet, I am priceless!"</p>

  <p>Olivia was more tolerant toward Zheng's unfriendly manners. Unlike Dylon who was extremely insolent in front of Zheng, she was treating Zheng much better than Dylon had been with him. Zheng was caught off guard by the "kindness" that Olivia was showing him. He thought that there was no need for him to continue with such vulgar joke and he wasn't the type who would be enchanted by a beautiful woman. He then said, "Cut the crap! Who wants to see me?"</p>

  <p>Sensing that Zheng softened his tone, Olivia let out a sigh of relief. Dylon's rudeness had offended Zheng earlier which made it difficult for Olivia to carry out her plans. In the end, she had to show up and solve the trouble herself.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Zheng softened his tone. It seemed that he hadn't taken it much to heart.</p>

  <p>In the Central Region and the four divine kingdoms, humans had established the dominance over the others for their great number and powerful strength. However, the place was filled with internal strife, conflicts, and hatred among different parties.</p>

  <p>In the Sea God Continent, on the other hand, humans were considered too weak. Only when they united could they confront more powerful forces.</p>

  <p>The powerful human talents represented the future of humans; therefore, they were highly valued. Currently, in the eyes of the ogres and other creatures, Zheng was a pain in their asses, and they were all dying to get rid of him. For the human race, on the other hand, Zheng was undoubtedly a talent that they desperately needed now. Zheng was a rare talent that they wouldn't want to miss and they would give him the best training needed to make him stronger.</p>

  <p>His performance on the first floor of the Tower of Sin had surprised all.</p>

  <p>Despite being a war fighter at the eighth level, he defeated a divine-level talent of the Demon Night with ease.</p>

  <p>This had never happened before in the history of humans! It was unprecedented performance! Zheng was now considered as the most powerful human who ever stepped into the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>Humans had never played a crucial role in the Sea God Continent before, and they weren't even worth to be mentioned.</p>

  <p>Even a cultivator from another race at a lower level of cultivation could challenge a human martial artist at a higher cultivation level. Humans were an inferior race that simply didn't deserve to compete with other races!</p>

  <p>Every time the humans sent their best talents to the Tower of Sin, they would be brutally massacred by other races. This had been the case and only a few humans had ever made it to another floor because most of them would die in the first floor of the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>These belief and news had a huge blow on the humans' confidence. The loss of confidence damaged the spirit of the human race. It was terrifying to see what fear could do to a race!</p>

  <p>But now, Zheng's appearance was the silver lining to the human war lords in the Tower of Sin. The news had quickly spread to the elders in the Purple Heart Sacred Place. Although those elders were war sages and they were unable to enter the Cursed Land, they still could offer their strategies to their people in the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>Zheng had no idea that the elders of the Purple Heart Sacred Place were watching his fight through a Picture Slab. The elders were happy to see a human finally standing up to the other creatures in the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>To Olivia's knowledge, the elders of the Purple Heart Sacred Place had already given the order to support Zheng and offer him the chance to receive better training for cultivation.</p>

  <p>Once Zheng became a war general, he might become the motivation for the younger generation of humans. His presence might give them the confidence to strive forward. And once Zheng became a war lord, it might even help the humans to obtain a new seat in the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>This was the only reason why Olivia Xia was able to tolerate Zheng's rudeness towards her.</p>

  <p>"It's our human war lord, Elder Jing, who wants to see you," Olivia answered honestly.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded and said, "Go on, lead the way! Let's get this over with!"</p>

  <p>They followed Olivia and went forward. It was a long walk. There were a lot of turns through the living area before they arrived at a tavern.</p>

  <p>The living area was well-equipped with almost everything one could wish for. Many races had businesses there that offered various services. There were taverns, gambling stalls, and brothels on practically every floor!</p>

  <p>Whatever you wanted, you could get in the living area.</p>
