  <p>
</p>

  <p>The downgrader silently glanced at the Snake Spirit King and mockingly asked, "You want me to make a move now?"</p>

  <p>"It's up to you, Master. I am at your disposal," the Snake Spirit King said as he submitted with a lowered head. He was afraid that the downgrader would read his mind.</p>

  <p>"The Blood Snake Girl has fulfilled her mission. It doesn't matter if we let her go," the downgrader said.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King felt a flash of disappointment because he didn't want to see his daughter being freed.</p>

  <p>"The end of the chaos is about to arrive, and she possesses the power to destroy the Source World. We can't let her fall into the hands of other people." After pondering for a moment, the downgrader continued, "We are going to follow them."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," the Snake Spirit King replied with an ingratiating nod.</p>

  <p>The Burial Land, which had spun at high speed, stopped, and its side emitted a bright radiance. It changed its path and flew into the depths of the chaos.</p>

  <p>In the empty chaos, two giant objects were advancing at high speed.</p>

  <p>When he had finished a fifth of his trip in the chaos, Zheng activated the Soul Extreme Form once again.</p>

  <p id="top_28">Since the Illusory Vision expanded over a vast area, Zheng immediately discovered that the Source World was chasing after him from behind.</p>

  <p>"I didn't expect it to pursue me..." Zheng murmured to himself as he furrowed his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>Zheng frowned slightly and felt relieved as a new thought occurred to him.</p>

  <p>'The Evil God considers the downgrader his biggest threat, not me. He follows closely behind me simply because he fears that the downgrader will make a move against him.'</p>

  <p>Hence, the Evil God's actions didn't unnerve Zheng at all.</p>

  <p>However, as the Illusory Vision continued to advance, he frowned deeply for he realized that the Burial Land was also tailing after him.</p>

  <p>This was definitely not welcome news. Although he had already got the Heavenly Ring Staff, he was not sure that he could prevail over the downgrader.</p>

  <p>He knew that undoubtedly the most important thing was to be proficient in harnessing the Extreme Form energies.</p>

  <p>But there were one hundred and forty different kinds of Extreme Form energy waiting for him to master. Plus, he had to learn several theurgies of each Extreme Form energy. Hence, it was no small task to master all those energies.</p>

  <p>While the primitive land headed west, Zheng had been constantly testing these Extreme Form energies, not even pausing for sleep.</p>

  <p>Ten days later, the primitive land slowed down as it approached a mark a million miles from the inner wall of the chaos.</p>

  <p>The heads were still tirelessly stirring, obstructing Itzel's vision. However, she still saw the massive primitive land while it was still a million miles away from her.</p>

  <p>"What is that?" Itzel mused.</p>

  <p>There was a trace of confusion shining in her eyes.</p>

  <p>Trapped within in the wall, she had seen lots of things in the chaos. But never had she seen a huge world approach.</p>

  <p>'Was this world sent by the force hostile to my father?'</p>

  <p>She had been trapped there for over a thousand chaotic eras, and nothing had stirred her. But at this thought, her heart beat faster in excitement.</p>

  <p>Over the years, she had come to believe that no one would come here and set her free.</p>

  <p>But now that there was a slim chance, she couldn't control her excitement and longed to seize the opportunity.</p>

  <p>The massive land drew closer and closer, finally stopping in its tracks when it was a hundred thousand miles away from her.</p>

  <p>From her vantage point, the primitive land had collided against the inner wall of the chaos.</p>

  <p>Five minutes later, Zheng could be seen, floating in front of the primitive land.</p>

  <p>He stretched forth his finger, and ripples appeared in the space in front of him. The ripples twisted the space upside down, folded it up for a hundred thousand miles, and then restored it to its normal shape.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Zheng was one hundred thousand miles away from where he had previously been.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>Those heads were originally slamming into the wall of chaos with force nonstop.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, they sensed the burst of a life force coming from behind them.</p>

  <p>For these heads, who only fed on creatures, Zheng was their favorite type of food.</p>

  <p>They all gave up on Itzel, turned around, and came at Zheng.</p>

  <p>As soon as those heads left, one after another, a huge wall came into Itzel's view.</p>

  <p>The primitive land was massive; plus, it was so close to her. As a result, she could only see the wall. But then, she caught sight of Zheng not far away.</p>

  <p>"It's a human being?"</p>

  <p>Surprise crept onto Itzel's face.</p>

  <p>She had imagined that all sorts of powerful and unique creatures would spill out of the primitive land. But it never occurred to her that what appeared would be a human.</p>

  <p>"Watch out! Those heads feed on all life force," Itzel warned as she saw that the heads were trying to bite Zheng.</p>

  <p>But the next moment, she saw that Zheng had transformed into countless shadows.</p>

  <p>Those shadows gently touched the foreheads of each of the heads.</p>

  <p>With the heads no longer attacking, Zheng moved past them and flew towards Itzel slowly.</p>

  <p>"Those heads are still alive. Watch out..." Itzel urged him.</p>

  <p>The heads all swung about and with their jaws flapping, they rushed up to bite Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, as soon as they had covered over a mile, they crumbled, turning into powder and dissipating in the air. They didn't even have the chance to touch Zheng, never mind to hurt him.</p>

  <p>As Zheng made his way towards Itzel, he saw a faint blue enchanted barrier which separated them.</p>

  <p>The enchanted barrier could repel the fierce attacks of the heads, which meant it was hard to break.</p>

  <p>Zheng pointed at the enchanted barrier with one finger, and a purple energy ring materialized around his wrist. His arm was instantly filled with energy of the Destruction Extreme Form.</p>

  <p>As Zheng wiggled his fingers, the enchanted barrier disintegrated, breaking into pieces like a thin layer of ice.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" Itzel finally asked.</p>

  <p>"My name is  Zheng Luo," Zheng replied with a friendly smile. "Your husband and daughter have asked me to free you," he added.</p>

  <p>"My daughter and my husband?"</p>

  <p>Itzel echoed his words, stunned.</p>

  <p>A puzzled look filled her eyes.</p>

  <p>Zheng understood why she was behaving like that. 'If any other person had been locked up in the wall for over a thousand chaotic eras, they would have already gone crazy, ' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>He stretched his hand forward.</p>

  <p>Then space began to fluctuate again. Space became folded, and Dorothy and Kincaid materialized next to Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Mother..."</p>

  <p>Dorothy called out.</p>

  <p>The moment Dorothy caught sight of the woman, she felt a sense of kinship with Itzel. Perhaps it was because of their blood ties.</p>

  <p>"Itzel..."</p>

  <p>Kincaid also called out affectionately to her.</p>

  <p>When she had first been sent to the Human Spirit Sect, Itzel didn't have a name yet. Kincaid had given her the name.</p>

  <p>Kincaid had given up hope of ever seeing her again.</p>

  <p>Hence, he also became somewhat carried away with excitement.</p>

  <p>Itzel stared blankly at Kincaid and Dorothy for a while, and then she began to sob.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing this, Kincaid hurried forward and held her, rubbing her cheeks gently. "I am sorry. I should have come here earlier," he said with both guilt and affection in his voice.</p>

  <p>Zheng felt glad at the reunion of the family. He left the three of them alone to enjoy their private moment.</p>

  <p>An hour later, Kincaid gestured at Zheng to come join them.</p>

  <p>Zheng approached them, and the hesitance in Itzel's eyes was gone as she looked at him.</p>

  <p>She had already heard about who Zheng was, and Kincaid had told her that Dorothy had feelings for Zheng. If her daughter married him, he would become her son-in-law.</p>

  <p>"The inner wall of the chaos is almost impenetrable. Please endure it!"</p>

  <p>Zheng said as he laid one hand on the wall.</p>

  <p>Wisps of dark purple energy of the Destruction Extreme Form flowed out of his hand.</p>

  <p>The energy penetrated every nook and cranny of the wall, and dyed the surface of the wall to purple. Its surface became decayed, and it would be a small task to remove the layer of wall and free Itzel now.</p>
