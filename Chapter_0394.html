<br/><br/>

  

  <p>At the sight, the crowd began to discuss.</p>

  <p>"Dick's blow is so terrifying. He could strike Zheng into the air using only the kill song. He is so much stronger than Zheng. Zheng will lose in this round."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid the damage would be more than just losing the battle. The word 'kill' is so unfathomable. It contains terrifying power within itself.</p>

  <p>And I had a bad feeling when I saw this word. It seems as though it might bounce Zheng's force back. That's to say Zheng will suffer the damage of his own attack as well as the blow from the word 'kill'. Whether he can still stand or not, remains to be seen."</p>

  <p>"Oh! I get it. Zheng was hit by the innate superhuman strength from himself. I hope that he is unable to stand. Yes, he should not be able to stand. I bet all on him losing, and I lost my money in the previous rounds in which Zheng fought and won. If he continues to win, I will lose all my money. I gambled on Dick being stronger. If Zheng fails, I will recover my money and perhaps, even make a profit!"</p>

  <p>"Don't worry. He won't recover from this attack. Even if his body is made of steel and iron, he can't withstand it."</p>

  <p>In fact, except for the disciples from Drizzle Peak and the people who wagered on Zheng's victory, almost all the other people hoped that Zheng would lose. They prayed that Zheng wouldn't stand after the blow.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't get up. But it was not because he couldn't. He was thinking about how to deal with the current situation. Zheng figured it would be best if he stayed down and used the time to find a solution to break Dick's word trick.</p>

  <p>After careful consideration, Zheng realized that it would be impossible for him to break Dick's defense merely using his body.</p>

  <p>He had to rely on other methods.</p>

  <p>The five defense songs continuously spun around Dick. And there were two kill songs around him. Although Master Yu had instructed him to kill Zheng, should he find the chance, Dick was reluctant to do so.</p>

  <p>A gentleman should observe moral standards. How could he take advantage of another's perilous state?</p>

  <p>Zheng must have suffered a significant backlash from the blow. He was lying on the ground motionlessly. It was possible that he was unconscious. If so, that would be the best outcome. The judge could announce that Zheng had lost, thus ending this round.</p>

  <p>"He can't stand..." Dick murmured as he gazed at Zheng who was lying on the ground. He could explain to Master Yu that Zheng had passed out, and that meant that Zheng had lost. So he was justified in stopping his attack.</p>

  <p>But the moment Dick heaved a sigh of relief, Zheng rolled over and jumped to his feet. Zheng then took a moment to check if his body could still function well. A carefree smile lit up Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>Dick was surprised. He took a deep breath. It seemed that Zheng hadn't been affected.</p>

  <p>Dick knew that Zheng's physical body was tough. Zheng had already shown this in the previous battles. Dick was the kind of person who would not take action until he had worked out a good strategy. He knew where Zheng's strength lay, but he didn't expect that Zheng's physical body would be so strong.</p>

  <p>While it was true that Zheng's body far exceeded what a flesh body could do, it was not impossible to hurt him. Even his body was made of iron and steel, he should have been broken into two parts with the heavy blow. Only when his body reached the level of mysterious weapon or spiritual weapon could he withstand such an attack.</p>

  <p>This was the only explanation Dick could come up with when he saw that Zheng remained unhurt. He didn't know that his assumption was close to reality. Zheng's body was indeed a spiritual weapon. Moreover, it was at the middle-grade level of a spiritual weapon.</p>

  <p>Zheng stretched his arms and legs before glancing at Dick who stood not far from him. In the next instant, Zheng rushed toward Dick.</p>

  <p>Zheng knew what he was doing. Although it was true that he had hidden his real strength before, Zheng understood that he could not hide it forever.</p>

  <p>Moreover, if someone really wanted to investigate, it would not take them much effort to discover the truth.</p>

  <p>Since it was impossible for him to defeat Dick with his physical strength, Zheng knew that he would have to employ his life vitality.</p>

  <p>The moment Zheng sprinted, streams of purple black life vitality surged from his belly. The demonic life vitality rushed to his hands through his meridians. To everyone's surprise, the demonic life vitality popped out from Zheng's hands and blazed like purple black flames. The life vitality burned vehemently, and what a frightening scene it was!</p>

  <p>Amidst the purple black life vitality, there were glints of sparkling starlight. It seemed to contain the power of stars that were hidden in the sky. At this sight, the audience was terrified.</p>

  <p>"Oh? Zheng employed his life vitality... How did I forget that Zheng is a nature creature? Perhaps it's because he hasn't used his life vitality so far!"</p>

  <p>"Nonsense! I have said it before. Some people tend to hide their real strength during competitions. So why can't Zheng do the same?"</p>

  <p>"But Zheng's life vitality looks so formidable, putting a lot of strain on people. It seems to be unique. I really wonder what kind of cultivation method this is."</p>

  <p>All the people were surprised. From the beginning of the competition, Zheng had relied on his superhuman strength and his strong corporal body to defeat his opponents. They were not accustomed to seeing him use life vitality. Moreover, most of the spectators had wagered on Dick. If Zheng won, they would lose all their money.</p>
