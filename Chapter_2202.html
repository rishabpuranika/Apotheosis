  <p>
</p>

  <p>The members of Tie Clan remained waiting outside.</p>

  <p>Devin stood at the side of the crater with a look of hesitation on his face as he looked at the passage dug out by Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>There were strong vibrations felt earlier from Luo Luo Zheng hitting the gangue layer, but it stopped after a while. They could only guess that the young man had finally given up.</p>

  <p>It was already hard for Devin's elders to deal with the gangue layer, what more could Luo Luo Zheng do? Besides, there was nothing underneath anyway.</p>

  <p>After brewing in silence for so long, Devin couldn't help but want to go in to see what happened.</p>

  <p>At that moment, his two uncles Alfred and John slid down from the edge of the crater.</p>

  <p>Alfred had been the one to find the mud last time, but digging out the entire crater was a team effort between him and John.</p>

  <p>"Hasn't Tianxing come out yet?"</p>

  <p>The elders of Tie Clan had since paid attention to this place but never appeared here because it was inconvenient for them. After Tianxing got in touch with Devin, they figured that the young ones would be able to deal with this matter. However, a long time had passed but there was still no movement, which caused them to worry.</p>

  <p>Tianxing was a popular figure in the Heavenly Han House. If something bad happened to him, then the Tie Clan would surely suffer.</p>

  <p>Devin shook his head. "No, he hasn't yet."</p>

  <p>Alfred and John threw each other meaningful looks. "Maybe it's time we go in and have a look. We have to make sure he's safe," Alfred suggested.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry. He won't encounter any danger." John smiled languidly.</p>

  <p>This place wasn't far away from the Six-Burden Divine City and the Tie Clan had been stationed here for a long time now, so no powerful, vicious beasts would dare to stay in the nearby vicinity. However, John still went after Alfred into the passage, followed closely by Devin.</p>

  <p>"Be careful. There is a hole under your feet," Alfred reminded them.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, the three ventured forward and eventually reached a dead end.</p>

  <p>"Tianxing must've gone down that hole we saw just now. We should go down and have a look," Alfred said. He was very sensitive and could guess what might've been Luo Zheng's thoughts when he ventured inside. The young man might have felt something wrong and decided to turn back to go down the hole. "You don't have to go down, Devin. I can go with John."</p>

  <p>The two traversed the hole and immediately came upon a surprising scene at the bottom.</p>

  <p>"My God! Tianxing has shattered the gangue layer!" Alfred exclaimed. "But where is he?"</p>

  <p>"That's odd. There are no other passages. He must surely be down here.</p>

  <p>It's impossible for him to go anywhere else," John remarked in puzzlement.</p>

  <p>Alfred squat down to help him think better. There was no doubt that this current situation was incredibly perplexing. "Look! There's a tiny hole. It looks like it was made by a blunt weapon. It should be Tianxing's weapon.</p>

  <p>The space below should be empty and he hung here by using his weapon."</p>

  <p>However, Alfred himself still remained confused by his own speculation.</p>

  <p>He had a hunch that he was right, but there was a thick gangue layer on the ground which did not match the marks left behind by Tianxing.</p>

  <p>John, on the other hand, was even more confused. "Do you mean there is a big cave beneath the gangue? And that cave has moved somewhere else?"</p>

  <p>"According to the marks here, yes. But that couldn't be," Alfred explained.</p>

  <p>John's heart pounded with excitement. "Let's dig further!" he exclaimed, eager to dig up even more secrets in their territory.</p>

  <p>Tianxing had come to the Tie Clan's territory and was lucky enough to stumble upon the mud. The Tie Clan was generous and let him take it for himself in order to build an amicable relationship with the future talent.</p>

  <p>However, if other rare treasures were found, then they would definitely take a share. If they did manage to find treasures here, then they might rise to a second-tier clan almost immediately.</p>

  <p>With this in mind, Alfred and John continued digging the passage Luo Luo Zheng had made.</p>

  <p>However, despite the two of them being True Gods, they still found it difficult to remove the gangue. They were able to dig down five hundred feet, but only gangue awaited for them below. Finally, they had no choice but to give up and climb their way back to the passage.</p>

  <p>Inside the cave, Luo Luo Zheng knew that the cave he previously dug had disappeared and the one he was in was completely sealed.</p>

  <p>The rocks above him effectively sealed him in and kept changing in color - from black to light green.</p>

  <p>The color of the walls was also different.</p>

  <p>"What the hell happened?" Luo Luo Zheng asked himself in wonder.</p>

  <p>These special pieces of gangue around him were very hard but it wouldn't be difficult to break them down if he used his full power. The problem though was that he had no idea what was going on. Human nature often made one afraid of the unknown and Luo Luo Zheng had zero clue what was in this cave.</p>

  <p>"I don't know either. I've been to three forbidden lands and even managed to sneak into the Soul Wilderness, but I haven't seen anything like this," Master Evil said. Luo Luo Zheng was only trying to find a piece of mud.</p>

  <p>Why did he meet such a bizarre thing?</p>

  <p>As he ruminated his current situation, Luo Luo Zheng suddenly saw that black thing appear not too far away. It took the shape of a starfish and slowly scaled the wall. As it moved, it left streaks of colorful mucus and soon enough, the walls began to change.</p>

  <p>Huge shadows began to appear on the translucent green walls. Each shadow looked like a gigantic monster with a massive head and long arms.</p>

  <p>"There's something in the walls," Luo Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>"What are those shadows? Why are they growing bigger?" Master Evil asked, his tone laced with both shock and intrigue.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng shook his head. "It's not that they're becoming bigger. They're walking towards me in the walls."</p>

  <p>Huge living beings were indeed approaching from behind the translucent walls, almost as if they were about to burst in.</p>

  <p>"I think you'd better find a way to escape as soon as possible!" Master Evil suggested. Luo Luo Zheng might have retained quite a bit of his strength, but their current situation was too weird and dangerous to take lightly.</p>

  <p>Master Evil felt that this might be a trap set up by that black thing.</p>

  <p>The forbidden lands were the most dangerous places in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Everyone knew that. In fact, there were some forbidden lands that even Holy Beings found difficult to enter.</p>

  <p>Outside the forbidden lands was the world of the True Gods. Ordinary vicious beasts could never hope to survive outside the forbidden lands.</p>

  <p>Any beast that managed to venture out and live outside the forbidden lands was most probably extremely powerful and terrifying. Not even Holy Beings dared fight with these beasts since they most likely had strong, hidden powers that could prove fatal to an unsuspecting opponent.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng couldn't possibly deal with them right now.</p>

  <p>In Master Evil's opinion, the beasts in this cave were the ones with strong hidden powers. They most likely had devoured quite a number of True Gods over the years.</p>

  <p>"I think I might need to escape," Luo Luo Zheng affirmed as he stared at the swaying shadows behind the walls. His eyes, however, remained affixed to the squirming black mud on the wall. That mud might have summoned all those shadows behind the wall.</p>

  <p>The wisest choice was to leave this place as soon as possible; however, Luo Zheng's inner world thought otherwise. That mud was too important. If he wanted to condense the Godly Tile as soon as possible, then he needed to take the risk and go all out.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did not delay any longer. He reached out and grabbed two stalagmites above his head, and the power of the Nine Divine Stars began to rapidly circulate.</p>
