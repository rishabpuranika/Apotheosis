<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>When Janet saw the Saint Killing Spear, she was frightened.</p>

  <p>The Lofty Wood in her body was warning her and she could sense something special about that spear.</p>

  <p>One of the two materials used to make the Saint Killing Spear was black and the other white. They seemed to resonate with the Lofty Wood in her body.</p>

  <p>She had no idea that the black and white spear shafts of the Saint Killing Spear were also made of the other two kinds of divine wood.</p>

  <p>There was the Ray Wood in the east, the Sunrest Wood in the west, the Lofty Wood in the north, and the Hidden Wood in the south.</p>

  <p>These were the four kinds of legendary divine wood and they all existed above the heavens.</p>

  <p>From the four types of wood, Ray Wood had never appeared in the universe.</p>

  <p>Lofty Wood had only appeared when Janet was born.</p>

  <p>However, the Hidden Wood and the Sunrest Wood had been set up here since the birth of the universe.</p>

  <p>This was because the Sunrest Tree was the sun's resting place. The sun that illuminated everything was extremely important for the birth of the numerous living beings of the universe and the final step in constructing the universe was to light up the sun, and the existence of the Sunrest Tree was the key to achieving this.</p>

  <p>The Hidden Tree grew extremely fast. Its roots were everywhere supporting the one hundred thousand supreme worlds and a million great worlds. And even though the Hidden Tree drew all the worlds together, it couldn't be seen; that was why it was called the "Hidden Tree."</p>

  <p>The Hidden Wood was white, while the Sunrest Wood was black.</p>

  <p>The Saint Killing Spear was made of a piece of Hidden Wood and a piece of Sunrest Wood intertwined with each other.</p>

  <p>When Janet felt the power of the two kinds of divine wood, she had to warn Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>But he already knew that this spear's shadow was not to be withstood. He turned and dashed to the side in a swift movement.</p>

  <p>"Eight Smoky Melodies!"</p>

  <p>The spear shadow was heading straight to him fast. Without a thought, Luo Zheng instantly activated the Eight Smoky Melodies.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng dodged. With the impact of the Eight Smoky Melodies, the spear swept past his body and stabbed the city wall.</p>

  <p>"Rumble, rumble, rumble" could be heard.</p>

  <p>Something weird was happening in the city wall.</p>

  <p>The city wall was indestructible, but a small hole had been drilled out by the wild and violent spinning of the spear shadow.</p>

  <p>The spear had two points, and it forcefully dug out a piece from the city wall.</p>

  <p>"What power is this?"</p>

  <p>Even Luo Zheng couldn't believe what he was seeing.</p>

  <p>Although the spear only drilled out a fist-sized hole in the city wall, it was enough to shock everyone present.</p>

  <p>The city wall contained the law of the heavens.</p>

  <p>The law of heavens should make the city wall impenetrable.</p>

  <p>Few warriors could dig a hole in the city wall. Not a Soul Sea Realm warrior, a Spirit Supreme Realm warrior, a Spirit Transformation Realm warrior or a world lord. They wouldn't even be able to take a tiny piece of it.</p>

  <p>A Supreme Lord, however, might be able to break the city wall, but it was only because they had the Heavenly Destiny and mastered part of the law of the heavens.</p>

  <p>However, the Saint Killing Spear was originally a weapon that was from above the heavens. It was able to penetrate through the law of the heavens, and thus it was able to damage the wall.</p>

  <p>"Humph! You're dodging pretty fast, but let's see how much longer you can take it!"</p>

  <p>Malachi kept on spinning his spear over and over again.</p>

  <p>This Shadowy Spin was a basic spear skill of the Saint Killing Spear. It didn't consume much life vitality but it was extremely powerful.</p>

  <p>The enormous shadows of the spear shot towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Swish, swish, swish..."</p>

  <p>Some spear shadows were aimed at the ground outside the city wall and drilled into the ground and disappeared. Everyone was wondering what was going on and where those spear shadows were going. A rumbling sound echoed through the ground.</p>

  <p>Other spear shadows shot towards the city wall and kept on inflicting small holes in the city wall.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng dodged one of them, the spear shadow suddenly shot over into the main city.</p>

  <p>On the walls of the main city there was an invisible and very thin layer of protection formed by the law of the heavens that protected the city.</p>

  <p>The spear had actually been able to penetrate through the invisible barrier.</p>

  <p>The top of the city wall was densely packed with warriors.</p>

  <p>Everyone thought that the inside of the main city was absolutely safe. No matter how bad the fight between the warriors was, they couldn't cross or break the barrier to get inside.</p>

  <p>In order to get a better view of what was going on, the martial artists had stuck close to the edge of the city wall.</p>

  <p>"Pfft!"</p>

  <p>Accompanied by a sound that was like air leaking out, the spear pierced through the protective barrier and stabbed one of the warriors standing on the city wall.</p>

  <p>It happened so fast the martial artist did not even have time to react. He was focused on watching Luo Zheng and his strange movement technique of constantly dodging. He was so immersed in learning Zheng's techniques that he never saw the spear coming as it ripped through his body.</p>

  <p>The spear shadow pierced through the martial artist's chest, leaving a smooth, round hole of blood in his chest. It had penetrated through his heart.</p>

  <p>However, he still maintained his standing posture and his expression didn't change.</p>

  <p>Not until the warrior beside him pointed at his chest and said, "You..."</p>

  <p>The warrior looked down and saw the big hole in his chest.</p>

  <p>He realized what happened and fell to the ground with a loud bang. The Illusion Points appeared and the warrior's corpse gradually disappeared, his soul flying into the main city to be resurrected.</p>

  <p>It was said that there were times when people had died and they weren't aware of it, so that even though their life force had been cut off, they could still walk no different from living people. It was not until someone else told them about their death that they would die right away.</p>

  <p>No one was sure where that legend came from, but it had just happened.</p>

  <p>When the warriors standing on the city wall saw that warrior being hit by the spear and dying, their faces changed drastically.</p>

  <p>They understood that the city wasn't indestructible. The law of the heavens was domineering and tyrannical but, in the end, there were still some powerful cultivators that could break through it.</p>

  <p>All the warriors on top of the city wall started to retreat.</p>

  <p>They wanted to watch the event happening before their eyes but they didn't want to lose their lives over it. Although they were able to revive after death in the Illusion Battlefield, no one wanted to risk it.</p>

  <p>"Retreat! Retreat!"</p>

  <p>"Everyone retreat! Find a farther spot to watch!"</p>

  <p>"I was just standing behind that warrior. I was so lucky that the spear shadow was quickly erased by the heavens' law, or I wouldn't have been able to escape death!"</p>

  <p>The warriors all left the city wall and crowded on top of the other buildings to watch the battle. Some of the timid warriors didn't want to give up the opportunity to watch the battle, so they decided to find a corner to watch it.</p>

  <p>There were much fewer warriors on the city wall now.</p>

  <p>However, Janet, Hailey, Jeffrey, Coleman and Ansel did not choose to leave. Their strength might be a little weaker than Zheng's and Malachi's, but they could still face the battle. When the spear shadow penetrated through the light film, it slowed down, giving them enough time to dodge it.</p>

  <p>The warriors who were following Malachi didn't leave either. These people were some of the bolder warriors or warriors who liked to show off their strength. So they remained standing on top of the city wall.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!"</p>

  <p>The spear shadow was incredibly fast and Luo Zheng could only maintain an extremely high speed as he dodged around Malachi.</p>

  <p>In less than two minutes, Luo Zheng had already dodged over a hundred spear shadows, every one of them dangerous. He had to rely on his own strength and the Eight Smoky Melodies to do this and he was getting tired.</p>

  <p>'If this continues, I won't be able to keep up. I'll be hit by a spear's shadow.'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was very confident in the strength of his physical body, but he didn't think that he would be able to take a strike without getting hurt.</p>

  <p>Suddenly another spear shadow flashed past him, and at the same time, a dark golden longbow appeared in his hands.</p>

  <p>"Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh!"</p>

  <p>The minute the longbow appeared in his hand, three streaks of black light shot out from him.</p>

  <p>"Third-rank divine weapons. Childish!"</p>

  <p>Malachi's face was filled with disdain as the long spear in his hand spun twice like a windmill.</p>

  <p>"Clank, clank, clank!"</p>

  <p>With three clear sounds, the three black arrows were easily sent flying away by the Saint Killing Spear.</p>
