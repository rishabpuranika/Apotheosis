<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Everyone had heard of Amber's miracles in the Sea God Continent.</p>

  <p>However, no one envied her.</p>

  <p>Why? It was simple: they didn't even have the qualifications to be envious.</p>

  <p>It was already difficult enough for them to put their names right next to Amber, what more creating miracles? Since ancient times, creatures from all sorts of races had entered the Tower of Sin. It couldn't be denied then that the number of those who were able to break through the tenth floor and undergo the Talent Tablet test was great, immeasurable even.</p>

  <p>However, not a single one had the right nor the capabilities to have their names placed beside Amber's name.</p>

  <p>Those whose names belonged on the top four rows were already very powerful and were regarded as formidable beings among those in the tower since those on the top four rows were destined to become the strong masters who reached the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>They would be unbeatable in the Sea God Continent.</p>

  <p>As for those who were on the second row, they were the ones destined to usher in a new era for the world.</p>

  <p>What happened today was a very monumental event as two warriors earned the right to have their names appear on the top two rows. Moreover, these two warriors were actually from the human race.</p>

  <p>One was Yolande whose background was a mystery to everyone. When her name jumped to the second row, and then all the way to the first, everyone sighed but was not jealous.</p>

  <p>She had never been promoted all these years and she couldn't really help the Purple Heart Sacred Place. The most she could offer was to continue gifting her Lucky Light to others.</p>

  <p>The other races were content with this set-up. It would be better for them if Yolande obediently stayed on the tenth floor since the consequences of her choosing to advance, obtaining a seat, and breaking through would be unimaginable.</p>

  <p>With her talent in the first row, it was certain that her future accomplishments would surpass Amber's� should she choose to. If she willed it, Yolande might become a detrimental element for humans to rise up and dominate all the other races.</p>

  <p>However, right after Yolande, Zheng's name had also jumped up to the second row.</p>

  <p>The two were very different. Although Luo Zheng also had a mysterious background like Yolande, he had a lot of motivation for advancing.</p>

  <p>Aside from Boris, several other ogre war generals also had the same thought. Several of them had even begun scheming on how to kill Luo Zheng. No price would be too high.</p>

  <p>They would even be willing to go as far as giving up ten seats, or even exchange with the humans, so long as Luo Zheng died.</p>

  <p>They wanted to prevent the rise of another warrior as extraordinary as Amber.</p>

  <p>The human race they had once looked down on and scoffed at was now rising and that scared them.</p>

  <p>Olivia covered her mouth and laughed. It seemed her assumptions were indeed correct! Luo Zheng... was a supernormal talent!</p>

  <p>Elder Jing cast a deep, significant glance at Zheng's name.</p>

  <p>He looked exceptionally calm but his fists were clenched tight and trembling at his sides, unable to entirely hold back the excitement in his heart. "Luo Zheng�" he muttered. "You have truly fulfilled our expectations."</p>

  <p>Everyone else's expressions varied.</p>

  <p>There were a few who did not care as the rise and fall of the human race did not really concern nor affect them. Those that did not have any enmity or were simply acquainted with the humans didn't need to be afraid nor joyful.</p>

  <p>However, those from the Demon Night and the ogre race were naturally startled and fearful.</p>

  <p>The Sea God Continent's resources were scarce and the rise of another race would surely lead to the invasion of another race in order to gain space and resources. Most of the creatures around were not loyal and would only show their loyalty and mercy to those they thought would be most advantageous for them.</p>

  <p>In this world, only the winners had the right to survive.</p>

  <p>Boris gazed up at Zheng's name quietly. He was very quiet but his mind was a jumble of thoughts as he intensely pondered on the situation.</p>

  <p>'Perhaps...</p>

  <p>Perhaps the elders are right.</p>

  <p>They are more far-sighted and wiser than me, ' he thought to himself. 'Luo Zheng is indeed someone the ogres must kill no matter what!'</p>

  <p>An ominous premonition arose in his mind. A premonition of the ogre's decline as a result of Zheng's ascension.</p>

  <p>Boris was a very proud person willing to stand on the arena and defeat Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, this didn't mean that he would idly watch as a terrifying opponent grew and became much stronger than everyone combined. If such a thing happened, it was no longer a matter of who was a stronger fighter, but a matter of whose races lived and died.</p>

  <p>He was a member of the ogre race and he felt an intense feeling of crisis and fear.</p>

  <p>"I still have a chance," he murmured coldly. "Once we meet in the arena, I will do my best to eliminate you even if it costs me my life!"</p>

  <p>However, just as everyone stared at Zheng's name on the second row, his name suddenly disappeared!</p>

  <p>And then, a bright, golden light appeared on the first row, pushing Yolande's name back.</p>

  <p>All other names such as Abigail, Odom, and Cliff were also moved further back, following Zheng's name.</p>

  <p>His name had been placed at the front of the first row and was made especially eye-catching.</p>

  <p>"Oh my god! Zheng's name is on top! It's ranked first amongst all of the names!"</p>

  <p>"What kind of talent and ability does one need to have in order to be in the first place?!"</p>

  <p>"You should have talent like Zheng's!"</p>

  <p>"Nonsense! What even is Zheng's level of talent? Can you even describe it? A divine-level talent could only reach the fourth row. Now that Zheng's name is on the first row, just what kind of talent does he have? Is it even describable?"</p>

  <p>There was indeed no quantifiable indicator for talent. The only thing that could be done was to compare it with other warriors' to figure out which level each one was in.</p>

  <p>The creatures of the Sea God Continent did not know the other five names on the first row and could only imagine that they were as mystical as immortals.</p>

  <p>However, in a single day, Luo Zheng and Yolande, who they all knew in the flesh, suddenly had their names placed right next to these mystical beings' names.</p>

  <p>Who would dare mock humans as trash from now on? Who would dare brand them as a cowardly race?</p>

  <p>No race would dare ridicule humans now that their rise towards prominence was already set in stone. Any offense to their race would most probably be countered by either Luo Zheng or Yolande.</p>

  <p>"If your race also has the ability, you can also cultivate a talent like Luo Zheng and have him place his name on the first row."</p>

  <p>Everyone gathered all discussed amongst themselves the sensational happenings.</p>

  <p>Even the constant fighting in the arena halted.</p>

  <p>The ogres, the Demon Night, the Orcs, the Giants, the Night Group... All kinds of creatures from all races all gathered together to look and discuss at this momentous event. A lot of them were already certain of Zheng's rise along with the human race but a few creatures weren't so quick to come to that conclusion.</p>

  <p>"If Luo Zheng grows and becomes more powerful, it's very likely that he'll help the Purple Heart Sacred Place."</p>

  <p>"I don't think that's necessarily the case. The ogres will not let Luo Zheng grow even stronger. If they can't beat him in the arena, then the ogre war lords on top of the tower will probably bend the rules and kill Luo Zheng themselves."</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng shouldn't have entered the Talent Tablet for the test. He would've been fine if he placed on the fifth or fourth row but now, everyone's seen just how great his abilities are. The ogres are surely on edge. They won't allow someone like Luo Zheng to live long."</p>

  <p>"I agree. The ogres still regret not killing Amber in the past after the bloody lesson they have learned years ago. They're smarter now and will definitely not let Luo Zheng off. Even if they break the rules, they would do their best to eliminate him!</p>

  <p>Besides, there's still the Demon Night hanging around. Luo Zheng should also watch out for them!"</p>

  <p>Olivia and Elder Jing both wore long expressions upon hearing the discussions.</p>

  <p>The bystanders were right. It was impossible for the ogres to remain indifferent to this matter. It would not be beneath them to break the rules and they would send out a war lord to kill Luo Zheng to assure the survival of their race.</p>

  <p>Although the Purple Heart Sacred Place had a handful of powerful and influential human masters in the Soul Sea Realm, they would never be able to enter the Tower of Sin. No one would be able to get to the tower to help Luo Zheng. Moreover, humans only got four seats at the top of the tower.</p>

  <p>How could those four warriors resist the force of the over twenty ogres who also held seats?</p>

  <p>It wasn't good news.</p>

  <p>Something big was brewing and troubles were approaching fast. However, the one who was now currently facing such a huge dilemma was still inside the test room, completely unaware of the things that were currently happening outside.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng completed the test, the surrounding light began to dissipate.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a pair of eyes appeared right in front of him.</p>
