<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"This...have they all come here to vie for the chance to marry Miss Xi?"</p>

  <p>At the realization of this, Zheng, who was standing beside the line, smiled in mild amusement. It seemed that Xi Clan had become really anxious.</p>

  <p>But he had heard that this contest had been going on for a long time now.</p>

  <p>He didn't know why Miss Xi was being so picky. Was her heart lofty than the sky itself? There were so many suitors, so why the hell had she not found one to her liking? Zheng wondered.</p>

  <p>"Hey, you newcomer! For the marriage contest? Line up at the back! A servant of the Xi Clan, upon seeing Zheng standing away from the line, pointed at him and harshly scolded him. This servant probably thought that Zheng was going to cut in the line.</p>

  <p>Zheng was not angry at all. This servant was just an ordinary person and naturally could not tell Zheng's cultivation level. As for the other martial artists in the line, their expressions changed when they noticed that Zheng's cultivation level was at the Virtual Tribulation Realm.</p>

  <p>'The man has stepped into the Virtual Tribulation Realm at such a young age. Which sect is he from?' they wondered.</p>

  <p>On the Sea God Continent, it was not uncommon for a warrior of Zheng's age to become a war lord. For example, if Cheryl, Olivia and several other cultivators wanted to break through, they could achieve the same through hard training in the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>The speed of improving one's cultivation in the Tower of Sin was far greater than what the outside world could measure up to.</p>

  <p>However, in the Central Region, reaching the Illuminating Soul Realm at this age was indeed surprising. Unless the big sects put in a lot of their resources to cultivate some talented disciples, people might never achieve this feat. Upon being aware of the cultivation level of Zheng, none of the warriors in the line dared look down upon Zheng.</p>

  <p>"I am not here to propose marriage," Zheng replied faintly.</p>

  <p>"We are extremely busy now. If you didn't come here to propose marriage, then don't stay here and make trouble. Go away and find some other place to have fun!" The servant started to drive him away without any hesitation. As a servant of the Xi Clan, even an ordinary martial artist wouldn't dare to provoke him so he wasn't afraid of Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng was still as indifferent as he was before. He said, "I have come here to pay a visit to the master of the Xi Clan."</p>

  <p>The servant laughed coldly, "Pay a visit to the master of the Xi Clan?</p>

  <p>Just you?" Even when those martial artists who had special identities wanted to meet the master of the clan personally, they had to pull a lot of strings to get an appointment. This servant obviously misunderstood Zheng. He shrugged and told him, "Our master doesn't have the time to entertain guests right now! If you don't leave now, I'll call for more people to force you away!"</p>

  <p>Just at this time, an elder steward walked over and shouted at the servant,</p>

  <p>"You idiot! How can you speak like that? Go away!"</p>

  <p>The steward of the Xi Clan was a nature creature. He saw a dispute arise from far away and came over to take a look. When he saw what was going on, he was startled. The servant was scolding a cultivator who was at the Virtual Tribulation Realm!</p>

  <p>In the Central Region, a warrior at the Virtual Tribulation Realm was a great force to be reckoned with. The master of the Xi Clan was merely at the middle stage of Virtual Tribulation Realm. However, this young man, who was a Virtual Tribulation Realm warrior, looked so young even from far away. Therefore, the steward assumed that he must be someone with an extraordinary background. He immediately rushed over and drove away the rude servant. Then he bowed to Zheng and apologized,</p>

  <p>"Sir, the servant is an idiot. Please don't take his words to heart. How can we help you?"</p>

  <p>Zheng's face was still completely expressionless. Of course he wasn't going to hold a grudge against an ordinary servant with no cultivation background. He only replied faintly, "No blame attaches to the unconscious doer of wrong. But I still want to pay a visit to your master."</p>

  <p>"The master has been very busy recently, but if you really want to meet him, I feel obliged to pass on your message. Please tell me your name first," the steward replied with a smile. He had been working in the Xi Clan for dozens of years, so he knew that he should not be disrespectful to the person in front of him.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded and said to the steward, "Tell him that  Zheng Luo has come to visit him."</p>

  <p>"Z... Zheng Luo?" The steward suddenly called out loud as his eyes stared at the man in front of him as if he'd seen a ghost. Since the sound of his exclamation was way too loud, it immediately alarmed the numerous warriors who'd lined up to propose marriage.</p>

  <p>Many of the warriors also walked over with puzzled faces.</p>

  <p>"Did you hear that? That brat said he was  Zheng Luo. Is that the same  Zheng Luo from the Cloud Hall?"</p>

  <p>"Isn't he supposed to be dead? For the past two years, there has been no news of him at all. It was as if he had disappeared into thin air all of a sudden!"</p>

  <p>"Honestly speaking, I think it's quite possible that he is really  Zheng Luo.</p>

  <p>Other than him, who else can step into the Virtual Tribulation Realm in just two years? Oh, right! There is also one, Brent, Ethereal Spirit Sect's divine-level talent…"</p>

  <p>The steward of the Xi Clan looked at Zheng in a daze, and then he asked cautiously, "You.. Are you really  Zheng Luo?"</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled faintly. "Yes, I am."</p>

  <p>"Alright, I'll pass on your message. Please wait a moment!" With that, the steward dashed into the castle as fast as he could, as if he was flying.</p>

  <p>Although this steward suspected Zheng's identity, it was not up to him to judge whether his claim was true or not. The master of the Xi Clan would come to a conclusion on his own.</p>
