</p>

  <p>"The end of the Divine Dao is an endless ocean..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was taken aback when he heard this. His gaze fell on Luo Nian's writing.</p>

  <p>When he read the words in his mind, he indeed had a very wonderful feeling.</p>

  <p>This feeling consumed him such that his soul couldn't bear it any more.</p>

  <p>Was that the so-called Truth of Divine Dao?</p>

  <p>"So you mean, there are many kinds of Truths of Divine Dao? Similar to the Divine Dao?" Luo Zheng repeated.</p>

  <p>Joy shook her head. "Actually, it's the opposite," she replied.</p>

  <p>The divine land had been in existence for countless years.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings had refined their Divine Dao to the hilt and built their own universes. After that, they began to explore the chaos outside the divine land, hoping to achieve a bigger breakthrough.</p>

  <p>Some Holy Beings had traveled through the chaos and found that it was empty.</p>

  <p>It was a boundless place where only grayish brown chaos could be seen.</p>

  <p>No strange civilization was to be found there.</p>

  <p>Some persistent Holy Beings wandered around in the chaos for hundreds of divine eras, but still found nothing. Despite traveling significant distances, in the end, they had to return disappointed.</p>

  <p>They failed in the exploration of space, and in the exploration of Divine Dao too.</p>

  <p>A warrior reached the end of the Divine Dao only when their Divine Dao reached the consummation. At the end of the Divine Dao lay an endless ocean. All Holy Beings and consummate True Gods had spent lots of time and energy exploring this ocean, but they weren't able to gain any insights from it.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the Divine Dao in the divine land had begun to develop all sorts of bizarre theurgies beyond ways, and warriors now practiced the double Godly Tile and mixed Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>Apart from these, no other notable breakthroughs had been made.</p>

  <p>"Later on, Armand Yan, the Demi-holy Being of the Yan Clan, received two golden Sanskrit words completely by accident. These two words were extremely rare. And the Yan Clan had spent a great deal of time and paid a high price trying to decode them. Finally, they were able to decipher the words and comprehend the Truth of Divine Dao," Joy said.</p>

  <p>"But nobody knew how this piece of news was leaked. The Yan Clan was destroyed because of this."</p>

  <p>"The Yan Clan had a Demi-holy Being, and yet it was destroyed?" Luo Zheng gasped in disbelief.</p>

  <p>Joy explained, "Actually, the Truth of Divine Dao recorded in the two golden Sanskrit words that Armand Yan deciphered might be incomplete, but it would also create quite a stir in the entire divine land.</p>

  <p>After all, the Truth of Divine Dao was enough to make the Holy Beings take a step forward in the Divine Dao. The Yan Clan didn't possess a Holy Being, and Armand Yan was just a Demi-holy Being. So it was not a difficult task to destroy the Yan Clan."</p>

  <p>"Then, who destroyed the Yan Clan?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"The Dongfang Clan, the Leng Clan and the Fang Clan," answered Joy.</p>

  <p>"My guess was right!" Luo Zheng commented narrowing his eyes.</p>

  <p>After Joy finished speaking, she studied the handwriting again, and a faint excitement appeared in her soft eyes. "I don't know how many mind methods of Truth of Divine Dao exist in the divine land now, but only five are known to the public, and these five are incomplete! I wonder if this mind method of Truth of Divine Dao is complete. If so, its value will be incalculable!"</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings stood atop the divine land, but who wouldn't want to advance further when they had reached this level?</p>

  <p>After they crossed the Divine Dao, they suddenly lost their reference and couldn't go any further. It was as if they had fallen into an ocean. No matter how hard they tried to swim, they were unable to go ahead. How could the Holy Beings ignore the Truth of Divine Dao, which could help them progress further?</p>

  <p>Even an incomplete mind method of Truth of Divine Dao was enough for the Holy Beings to kill an entire clan.</p>

  <p>No one knew what would happen if a complete mind method of Truth of Divine Dao appeared.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Nian had only written about a thousand words. Joy didn't know if this mind method of Truth of Divine Dao was a complete one or not.</p>

  <p>"These six golden Sanskrit words contain a total of 9, 673 characters in total. I've deciphered them one by one. Naturally it is a complete mind method," said a slightly childish voice.</p>

  <p>"My dear Luo Nian woke up!"</p>

  <p>Only then did Yudie notice that the young man in her arms had opened his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Luo Nian!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng called, beaming with joy.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian got up, bowed respectfully to Luo Zheng and replied, "Father!"</p>

  <p>The sixteen-year-old boy had grown to seven feet, and was not much shorter than Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He had overcome his stubbornness and had become very calm and composed. Under Yudie's tutelage, he was now an educated, reasonable and responsible young man. He had seldom spent time with Luo Zheng as a child, so he had an indifferent attitude towards his father, which would only increase with the passage of time. However, right now he was quite happy to see his father again.</p>

  <p>Joy sized up the boy and remarked with a smile, "Luo Zheng, your son is much more valuable than you."</p>

  <p>Her comment brought smiles on the faces of everyone, including Yudie and Imogen.</p>

  <p>What Joy said was right as this was a complete mind method of Truth of Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>After all, Luo Zheng wasn't strong enough to change the situation. If this complete mind method of Truth of Divine Dao were to leak out, it would cause a mess in the entire divine land!</p>

  <p>"Who are you, girl?" Luo Nian suddenly asked, as his gaze fell on Joy.</p>

  <p>In terms of seniority, Joy could be considered Luo Nian's grandfather's peer, and in terms of age, she could be considered his ancestor.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng suddenly found it funny when he heard how Luo Nian addressed Joy.</p>

  <p>He laughed and said, "Don't be rude, Luo Nian. You should call her..." He wanted tell his son to call her "Grandma," but on second thought, he felt like something was wrong, as Luo Nian's age was almost the same as Kelsey's, who called her "Aunt Joy."</p>

  <p>But if Luo Nian referred to her as his aunt, then it was very weird too.</p>

  <p>"Never mind," Joy said waving off the debate. "You can call me Master Joy. Hey, little genius, can you write down the complete mind method of the Truth of Divine Dao?"</p>

  <p>As someone who had been trapped in the Immortal Mansion since childhood with rarely any opportunities to go out, Luo Nian, of course, enjoyed the compliments.</p>

  <p>Although he didn't know her cultivation base, he knew that she was not an ordinary person. He nodded, picked up his writing brush, and walked towards the white papers on the floor.</p>

  <p>"Do you want to take a rest first, Luo Nian?" Yudie asked.</p>

  <p>"Mom, you know these words. As long as you don't read them or think about them, you'll be fine," the boy assured his mother casually.</p>

  <p>When Luo Nian had deciphered the golden Sanskrit words for the first time, he had uncovered the secrets hidden in them. It wouldn't be a problem if he didn't read these words together. But once these words were read together, he would become dizzy.</p>

  <p>This was the reason why Luo Nian would only decipher a single golden Sanskrit word at a time. This way, he would not feel the pressure.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian studied the white paper with a look of concentration on his face. He held a brush in his hand and began to write something down.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>No one spoke as they watched Luo Nian. The young man in white was still writing with quick and smooth movements.</p>

  <p>About an hour later, he had written down many words!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was gratified to see his son's achievement.</p>

  <p>After Luo Nian had written down all of them, Joy couldn't resist the temptation any longer. She looked at Luo Zheng and asked, "Can I see the mind method of Truth of Divine Dao written by your son?"</p>

  <p>Before Luo Zheng could answer, Luo Nian pursed his mouth and said in a disgruntled manner, "It was me who wrote this mind method. Master Joy, you should ask me!"</p>

  <p>When she saw the look on his face, Joy smiled. "Okay. Can I have a look at it, Luo Nian?" she requested.</p>

  <p>"Of course you can! I'm not so narrow-minded," said Luo Nian, shrugging his shoulders. "But you will have to give me something if you want to get something from me."</p>

  <p>"Hey!" Luo Zheng was at a loss whether to laugh or to be angry.</p>
