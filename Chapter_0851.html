  <p>The tall and slender figure slowly approached with several Demon Night war generals following closely behind her.</p>

  <p>The members of the Demon Night were mostly women and the perfect race was almost entirely dominated by females.</p>

  <p>So many male creatures of all races could not look away at the sight of them. The men's gazes were filled with greed and impure thoughts about the Demon Night women.</p>

  <p>However, they were to keep their lust and perversion to themselves. The moment they stared at the Demon Night woman at the helm, they immediately felt their eyes burn as if they were being melted by a hot flame.</p>

  <p>"AH!"</p>

  <p>"My eyes! My eyes!"</p>

  <p>"They hurt! I can't see anything!"</p>

  <p>"Am I going blind?!"</p>

  <p>They all howled and screamed.</p>

  <p>"Why did you look? How dare you gaze at a woman as powerful as her with lust and desire? She is Madeline, one of the seat holders of the Demon Night in the Tower of Sin. Those who look at her with impure thoughts will only get hurt. I heard that she's only a tenth-level war lord but her soul has already stepped into the Fighting Soul Realm."</p>

  <p>"Fighting Soul Realm? My word! Some of the war sages have not yet even reached that!"</p>

  <p>"Not everyone in the Soul Sea Realm possesses a soul at the Fighting Soul Realm. They say a soul like that is extremely powerful and will not be damaged by attacks from a normal soul."</p>

  <p>A look of surprise was evident in Madeline's eyes as she looked upon the wall filled with names. Even though she had already received the news that a tenth-level human war fighter had gotten his name on the first row, seeing it with her own eyes still caused her a lot of shock and disbelief.</p>

  <p>A human warrior?</p>

  <p>How could he be so talented? He was even stronger than the Demon Night's Amber!</p>

  <p>Madeline took a glance at Fabian and Jarrod who had stepped forward upon her arrival.</p>

  <p>"Madeline, the rules were made in accordance with the fourteen races' agreement," Fabian said. "Are we really going to let the ogres ignore that and repeal the rules?" Fabian looked at the crowd and, with a booming voice, stated his declaration, "If any of you have the ability to kill Luo Luo Zheng in the arena, then we, humans, will naturally not say a word. However, if any attempt upon Luo Zheng's life is made outside the arena and in the safe zone, then we'll have a problem."</p>

  <p>He knew humans were too weak and they would never be able to negotiate fairly with the ogre race. Fabian could only pin his hopes on the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>The Demon Night held sixteen seats at the top of the tower, second only to the ogres, and they were incomparably stronger. Despite having fewer seats, the Demon Night members did not fear the ogres at all.</p>

  <p>Malcom stared hard at Madeline's beautiful face. The Demon Night's interference was something the ogres did not want. It would be extremely troublesome for them if the Demon Night got involved with this issue.</p>

  <p>Ultimately though, the decision lay with Madeline. With a faint smile that had the ability to move any man's soul, she voiced out her thoughts loud and clear, "The Demon Night will not interfere in this matter."</p>

  <p>Despite the grudges both the Demon Night and the ogres had with each other, it could not be denied that both races shared the same interests and goals. They absolutely could not allow the humans to rise in power and become stronger.</p>

  <p>The rise of one race meant the fall of another, given the extreme competition for the Sea God Continent's limited resources. Right now, the Demon Night had become one of the strongest races, even overshadowing the ogre race because of Amber's strength and remarkable achievements.</p>

  <p>However, their race produced and cultivated offspring at a much lower rate than others. Compared to the ogres, the Demon Night had fewer resources and smaller population.</p>

  <p>Though they did not like the ogres, the Demon Night could not allow the humans to rise.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Madeline would be happy if the ogres got rid of Luo Luo Zheng. There was no need to get her entire race involved in this troublesome matter.</p>

  <p>Madeline's words plunged the hearts of Fabian, Jarrod, Elder Jing, and Olivia into disappointment. Luo Luo Zheng was too impressive and what they had feared would happen because of that.</p>

  <p id="top_9">On the other hand, Malcom was feeling giddy and had a sinister smile plastered on his face. With the Demon Night refusing to get involved, it would not be hard for him to deal with Luo Luo Zheng. All he needed to do was to wait for him to walk out of the Talent Tablet and immediately kill him.</p>

  <p>The ogres should've already taken action and killed Luo Luo Zheng before he reached the tenth floor. They had greatly underestimated Luo Zheng's strength by sending a Night Group assassin who was too weak to eliminate his target.</p>

  <p>When Malcom was lost in thought, his musings were interrupted by Madeline's voice. "However, the rules of the Tower of Sin were jointly made and agreed upon by the fourteen races. If the ogres want to break the rules, I think they should give an appropriate explanation."</p>

  <p>Her words greatly surprised those present.</p>

  <p>"Madeline, what do you mean by that?!" Malcom asked, enraged by what she had just said.</p>

  <p>Madeline, on the other hand, was calm and collected. "Everyone has to pay the price for breaking the rules," she said. "If you ogres violate the agreed-upon terms and kill a human talent outside the arena, at the very least, you should compensate the humans for their loss! Otherwise, how will you be able to explain this matter to the other races?"</p>

  <p>The Demon Night followed rules with rigidity as these rules had been set by strong masters to create peace and order. If someone willfully ignored the parameters set by the masters and did not face any repercussions, then the others would follow suit, creating chaos for the entire group.</p>

  <p>The Tower of Sin could fall into the chaos that it had once been plunged into. If that happened, talents from various races wouldn't be able to safely cultivate and would face all kinds of assassinations. Without the rules, all races would act recklessly!</p>

  <p>It was not something that the Demon Night wanted to see.</p>

  <p>The ogres could certainly break the rules but they had to pay the price.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, why would they need to strive for seats in the Tower of Sin?</p>

  <p>Why would they need the rules?</p>

  <p>Malcom sneered, "Compensation? We can offer compensation. As long as Luo Luo Zheng dies, our Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and Dread Ogre Sacred Place are willing to bestow the humans with ten low-grade sacred weapons!"</p>

  <p>Jarrod was immediately infuriated by his words, "Ten low-grade sacred weapons? Do you think of us as beggars?"</p>

  <p>A sacred weapon was indeed precious but it wasn't extremely rare in the sacred place. The Purple Heart Sacred Place itself had at least twenty low-grade sacred weapons.</p>

  <p>The human race would not compromise even if the ogres gave them one hundred, let alone ten sacred weapons. Luo Luo Zheng was a priceless super talent that should be cherished and protected. Besides, sacred weapons could only realize their true potential in the hands of a master.</p>

  <p>Malcom sneered, "Ten sacred weapons and that's it! I do not discuss with you humans, understand?"</p>

  <p>Fabian scoffed and shook his head. "It seems that you are still intent on ignoring the rules," he said. "Do you honestly think you can persuade us to give up on our super talent's life by giving us so little?"</p>

  <p>Malcom was about to retort when Boris suddenly interrupted, "There's no need to argue with them. I have a solution."</p>
