<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>To be able to gain the position of a hall leader in a tenth-grade sacred place, Master Shen was definitely a clever man.</p>

  <p>He was indeed acutely aware of what it meant for Yolande, the leader of the Mist Palace, to turn up unexpectedly and take Luo Zheng away personally.</p>

  <p>Though he fell short in terms of the ability to carry out an investigation and deduce the secrets within, he didn't need to know that.</p>

  <p>It was more than enough for him to be enlightened that the one who took Luo Zheng away was the leader of the Mist Palace and also the daughter of a Supreme Lord. When she had come here, the lord of the Spirit Reading World had personally welcomed her. The thirty-six hall leaders didn't even have the chance to meet her.</p>

  <p>From the very beginning, Master Shen had considered that Luo Zheng might have a solid base and strong background within the sacred place. It was also because of the Saint Lord's orders that they had brought him to the Holy City.</p>

  <p>However, little did he expect that Yolande would come to this supreme world and take Luo Zheng to the Mist Palace herself.</p>

  <p>Such a background truly made Master Shen afraid for a while. They even cautiously recalled whether they had taken good care of Luo Zheng on their way to the Holy City.</p>

  <p>And now, Luo Zheng had currently returned to the Spiritual Force Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>Undoubtedly, that was a journey across over a thousand supreme worlds!</p>

  <p>Even if it was Master Shen himself, crossing over the same distance was still an exceedingly difficult task. He would probably have to spend all of his wealth and endless time.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had left for the Mist Palace, which was over a thousand supreme worlds away, and just briefly returned.</p>

  <p>Even Luo Zheng hadn't realized that this was a magnificent feat in many warriors' eyes. At the very least, there weren't many Soul Sea Realm warriors who could cross over so many supreme worlds. Only the top talents of supreme worlds had the resources and ability to do so.</p>

  <p>Master Shen then discreetly swept his gaze over the place and immediately recognized the Heavenly Phoenix Horse behind Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Although he was unable to determine the origin of the sword in Zheng's hand, spotting a first-rank divine weapon based on his experience was easy as falling off a log. Likewise, the strong Mu Ning of the Law Power, being faintly transmitted from the sword, was too outstanding among the first-rank divine weapons for him not to notice.</p>

  <p>If it was merely an ordinary warrior leading a Heavenly Phoenix Horse and holding a first-rank divine weapon instead of Luo Zheng, Master Shen might seriously scheme to kill him and seize his treasures away. After all, obtaining these extraordinary things in this life would be rather difficult for him. Be that as it might, he didn't have the guts to act rashly and assault Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Not only did he not dare to behave recklessly, he even raised his hand and destroyed Julian's blood essence. Then he refined it into a piece of blood essence spirit.</p>

  <p>Soon after, he found himself apologetically handing over the blood essence spirit to Luo Zheng. "He had cultivated the Dark Blood Cultivation, which is to extract his own blood essence entirely and reconstruct his physical body. But unfortunately, he was unable to do a physical body reconstruction. This blood essence spirit is a superb tonic, Luo Zheng. Please consider this as compensation!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng gazed indifferently at the blood essence spirit in Master Shen's hand.</p>

  <p>It was of little use to him, but he did not reject it. Instead, after he received it from Master Shen, he handed it to Freya, who was beside him. "Your uncle is, after all, a close relative of yours. You should accept this blood essence spirit."</p>

  <p>Freya's body trembled slightly at Zheng's words. Before Master Shen came over, she had already given up hope.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng showed up, she had surprisingly seen hope from despair.</p>

  <p>Then, Master Shen appeared and she helplessly fell into despair again soon after seeing a glimmer of hope. Her state of mind seemed to be in a roller-coaster ride, experiencing many ups and downs.</p>

  <p>What she hadn't thought of was that the moment Master Shen had arrived, he was genuinely very polite to Luo Zheng. And one could even see the flattery in his eyes. To apologize to Luo Zheng, he had even raised his hand and exterminated her uncle's blood essence body.</p>

  <p>What background did Luo Zheng have?</p>

  <p>For a warrior, a year was not way too long. Memories of her and Luo Zheng were still vivid in Freya's mind as if they all happened only yesterday.</p>

  <p>In the Ascending Well, Luo Zheng had been fully immersed in his thoughts while Freya had spoken confidently. He had kept silent as if he had nothing to say. Then he had spent almost no time getting used to the vitality between heaven and earth in the Upper World.</p>

  <p>Warriors in the Ascending Wells were all from the Lower World. But presently, the majority of the warriors who had ascended with them were still mining. Freya herself was more than lucky enough to have left the mine in a short time. But she hadn't expected that Luo Zheng already possessed such a status.</p>

  <p>Freya couldn't still figure out what had happened to Luo Zheng in the short span of a year.</p>

  <p>Freya hardly threw a glance at the blood essence spirit in her hand after receiving it from Luo Zheng. Although she knew that it was notably beneficial to a warrior, she chose not to absorb it. Instead, she stored it carefully in the space ring. It was the blood essence spirit of Julian, her uncle.</p>

  <p>A smile hung on Master Shen's face as he continued, "Luo Zheng, since you are already here, why not come to our Spiritual Force Sacred Place for a chat?"</p>

  <p>If a warrior from the thirteen palaces cultivated successfully, he would surely have a significant position in the alliance. Although this was something that would likely happen in the far future, Master Shen was quite clear that he should be on friendly terms with Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did not decline Master Shen's sincere invitation. He had plenty of time for this trip to the Dark World anyway.</p>

  <p>Thus, Luo Zheng and Master Shen left the city together at once. Freya, on the other hand, remained sitting dazedly on the Heavenly Phoenix Horse.</p>

  <p>The light in her eyes constantly flickered, but she was still in a daze.</p>

  <p>Master Shen was in charge of the Void Flower Hall in the Spiritual Force Sacred Place. The said hall was located in another large city. Although this city was incomparable to the Holy City of the Spiritual Force Sacred Place, it was still not relatively small.</p>

  <p>After their arrival at the hall, Master Shen treated Luo Zheng with proper decorum at its finest. And Freya, who was at the side, seemed to be in a dream from beginning to end.</p>

  <p>She was also a Soul Sea Realm warrior equipped with a lot of experiences in the Lower World. In the Upper World, she realized her insignificance. The lord of a city held an incredibly powerful existence in her eyes. With this, she highly regarded Master Shen as he was in control of a thousand cities.</p>

  <p>The Saint Lord of this sacred place, the lord of this world, and even a Supreme Lord� for her, these were all legendary existences that were far beyond her reach. Freya felt like an awkward villager in a remote village, while these people were emperors. She had never thought that she would meet a Supreme Lord in her life. In other words, even if a Supreme Lord were to appear in front of Freya now, she would probably act the same as she was facing Master Shen.</p>

  <p>Each of the exquisite dishes laid out in front of them was all made of expensive raw materials, such as the Red Lustrous Fruit, the Jade Sea Wine, and the milky-yellow thick soup with a pleasant smell. If this were in the Lower World, they would be considered top-grade treasures. And one would seriously have to refine them into pills to bring out the best medicinal effects.</p>

  <p>But here, they were just made into ordinary dishes.</p>

  <p>This was a complete waste!</p>

  <p>In order not to squander such valuable things, Freya completely disregarded her way of eating and ate heartily. She wolfed down everything as if it was her only meal.</p>

  <p>With the way Freya devoured her dish, none of the numerous maids at the Soul Sea Realm in the hall dared to laugh at her. They didn't even have the nerve to look at her with a hint of despise in their eyes.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and Freya were both at the early stage of the Soul Sea Realm. Their cultivation level was even lower than that of the dancing and singing ladies in the hall. However, the two of them were their leader's distinguished guests. Under these circumstances, who would be bold enough to show the slightest bit of contempt? Otherwise, they would be courting death.</p>

  <p>As for Luo Zheng, he didn't gobble his food as Freya did. After gaining admission at the thirteen palaces, he now understood that from the time when he was a warrior at the Soul Sea Realm, every step he advanced would not only depend on his talent but would also consume a large number of resources.</p>

  <p>What was placed before him at the feast was not the resources he deemed to consider as vital. Even the several tenth-grade sacred places would fall short in supplying the resources he needed.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, you had gone to the thirteen palaces earlier, but why did you decide to come to our supreme world this time?" Master Shen started to probe curiously. "If I remember correctly, the distance between the Mist Palace and the Spirit Reading World is one thousand three hundred and twenty supreme worlds."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had already guessed that Master Shen would not let him off easily with this question. With a faint smile, he responded, "I can't possibly stay in the Mist Palace forever to cultivate. Even the warriors in the palace would have to go out to train. I just have an appointment with a friend in the Dark World."</p>

  <p>He felt that there was no need to hide his whereabouts, so he did not conceal anything.</p>

  <p>Freya, who was sitting beside him, was quite stunned as her eyelashes trembled. What did it mean that he had traveled across more than a thousand supreme worlds?</p>
