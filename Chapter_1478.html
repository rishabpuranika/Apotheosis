<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1478 Xun's Subordinates </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Freya carefully walked in an empty world.</p>

  <p>The background of the palace had disappeared. She felt like she was walking on the floor, but the ground below was now transparent, and she could clearly see the mountains and rivers far below. What a strange feeling it was.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, where are we?" Freya asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"The Reincarnation Plate," Luo Luo Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>Freya's face became depressed. Luo Zheng's answer was the same as not answering. Where did this big space tool come from?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled when he saw Freya's expression. He then briefly recounted what had happened after Freya left. After listening to him, she suddenly came to a realization.</p>

  <p>"So the Endless Abyss turns out to be a gigantic space tool." Freya's expression became filled with surprise.</p>

  <p>Space tools weren't anything rare. They were quite commonly seen in both the Upper and the Lower Worlds, but it was simply inconceivable that the Reincarnation Plate was in fact a space tool which could block the full force attacks of world lords.</p>

  <p>A world lord, as the name suggested, was the lord of a world.</p>

  <p>In the entire universe, there were trillions of lives. World lords were only ranked second to Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>Being coerced by Luo Luo Zheng, the world lord had to let Freya go. For a moment, Freya didn't know how to express her complicated mix of feelings.</p>

  <p>The ogre Saint Lord had used her to threaten Luo Luo Zheng, but Luo Luo Zheng didn't give up on her or run away. Instead, he had tried to think of a way to save her.</p>

  <p>When she thought about this, she felt warm in her heart. Luo Luo Zheng had not abandoned her.</p>

  <p>"Where are we going now?" Freya asked after thinking for a while.</p>

  <p>"Now we have to leave the Dark World. If we don't leave now, I'm afraid we won't be able to leave later." Luo Zheng's expression had turned more serious.</p>

  <p>The Reincarnation Plate was indeed incomparably sturdy, and able to block the attacks of the ogre Saint Lord. But there were simply too many powerhouses throughout the universe. Although the ogre Saint Lord was as strong as a world lord, he still was not a world lord. The real world lords would be much stronger than him.</p>

  <p>And now that Xun's identity had been exposed, Yao would lose no time to make her move. She would definitely send her men to chase down and kill Xun. It was very likely that she would send world lords, grand world lords and even Supreme Lords. Those were odds that even Luo Luo Zheng would struggle with.</p>

  <p>The situation was still very grim, and now was definitely not the time to relax or let down their guard.</p>

  <p>"Where are we going after leaving the Dark World?" Xun asked the same question.</p>

  <p>"Hmm?" Luo Luo Zheng was slightly surprised.</p>

  <p>When he thought of this, traces of hesitation appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>Should he return to the alliance?</p>

  <p>The alliance's three thousand worlds would be able to accommodate him.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, he had joined the alliance's Gauze Pavilion and possessed quite a few privileges in the alliance.</p>

  <p>But now that both his and Xun's identities had been exposed, would Yolande still be able to protect him?</p>

  <p>Since Xun was involved, the Demon Night would never compromise.</p>

  <p>Perhaps Luo Zheng's current talent was enough to attract the attention of the alliance, but he was, after all, only a member of the younger generation at the Soul Sea Realm. No one would make an enemy of the Queen of Punishment of the Demon Night for the sake of such a young man. There was no reason to expect the alliance's support.</p>

  <p>It was not far-fetched to believe that Yao was willing to pay any price in order to kill Xun. If Luo Luo Zheng returned to the alliance, Yao wouldn't stop until she reached her goal. The alliance would not stop her.</p>

  <p>Whether or not Yolande could protect Luo Luo Zheng was, in the end, a big question. At that time, the Supreme Lords of the two races would have to face each other. That was a conflict which the alliance might best want to avoid.</p>

  <p>Thinking of this, Luo Luo Zheng shook his head and said, "No, we're not returning to the alliance."</p>

  <p>"Well then, where are we going?" Xun smiled.</p>

  <p>"Let's wait and see," Luo Luo Zheng replied. Having heard this question twice in a row, he fell into deep thought.</p>

  <p>There was not much time to ponder over their dilemma now. The forces in the Upper World were complicated, and the situation was even worse there than in the Lower World. The great races didn't hate living together under the same sky, but rather, they could happily kill each other, while at the same time, coexisting peacefully in the Dark World.</p>

  <p>So Luo Luo Zheng had to re-evaluate his course of action.</p>

  <p>From the very beginning, Luo Zheng's main goal had been to find his sister.</p>

  <p>Even now, he still pursued this goal. However, he had no clue as to where exactly Yan could be as the universe was a big place!</p>

  <p>If she was not in this universe, which he had now traveled widely, where could she be? Could it be that she had already surpassed the heavens and left this universe?</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng controlled the enormous Reincarnation Plate, he pondered on his next step. There was so much to consider and careful decisions to be made.</p>

  <p>The Reincarnation Plate sped through the sky above the Dark World, passing countless cities on the way.</p>

  <p>There were cities belonging to the Demon Night and those belonging to the humans. Of course, there were cities belonging to the ogres as well.</p>

  <p>Every time they passed a city, it would attract the attention of countless people. These people would stop and stare up into the sky at the magnificent spectacle that passed over their heads. No one had seen the likes of the Reincarnation Plate before.</p>

  <p>A few hours later, the Reincarnation Plate seemed to have covered the span of half of the Dark World and arrived at the side of the supreme world.</p>

  <p>Even the broad passage of the supreme world could not accommodate the huge Reincarnation Plate. If Luo Luo Zheng wanted to cross the supreme world, he had to force the world through. However, since the Reincarnation Plate was a space tool used by a Supreme Lord, it wasn't too difficult to accomplish that. After Luo Luo Zheng had activated a few divine textures, the plate then rushed into deep space. As rays of incandescent light flashed on its surface, it was about to speed across space.</p>

  <p>However, just as the Reincarnation Plate began to fly off into deep space, a violent vibration was suddenly felt across the space tool.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>With this violent vibration, Freya could barely stand and fell to the transparent ground. She had such a fright that a small scream escaped her lips.</p>

  <p>Through the transparent wall, one could see that Luo Luo Zheng had a severe look on his face, and Xun's face had turned very pale.</p>

  <p>As for Livingston, this matter had originally had nothing to do with him.</p>

  <p>However, ever since Luo Luo Zheng had turned on the Reincarnation Plate, he hadn't rested for even a moment. Livingston said curiously, "It seems that you have offended quite a few big shots!"</p>

  <p>Around the Reincarnation Plate four martial artists of the Demon Night had appeared. There were both men and women and they were all ferocious-looking.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng couldn't tell their cultivation. However, the auras radiating from them were definitely much more powerful than that of the ogre Saint Lord.</p>

  <p>Xun stared fixedly at the four people with her cold gaze. There was a faint trace of sorrow and regret in her eyes. Then, she lowered her head and said icily, "They are Salvador, Aneisha, Viveca and Elspeth. They used to be my subordinates."</p>

  <p>As the Queen of Killings, Xun represented the strongest sword of the Demon Night. The martial artists who had originally gathered around her were of course the strongest.</p>

  <p>Salvador, Aneisha, Viveca and Elspeth were chosen from the most talented geniuses of the Demon Night. They had followed Xun to grow their cultivation, and they had succeeded in reaching an impressive level.</p>

  <p>100, 000 years ago, when Xun had explored the Endless Abyss, she had been accompanied by the four of them. At that time, they were only at the Spirit Supreme Realm. Yet, they had proven their mettle.</p>

  <p>In the past, they were all juniors of the Demon Night, but by then, Xun had become a queen, and they became her guards.</p>

  <p>Salvador had almost sacrificed his life to protect Xun while exploring the Endless Abyss. He would have gladly done so in the past.</p>

  <p>Yet, now it seemed that he was here to claim that life.</p>

  <p>100, 000 years later, the four had already become world lords, but their status and strength were even higher than those of normal world lords.</p>

  <p>They had held good relationships with Xun, but now they were sent here by Yao to chase down Xun.</p>

  <p>In fact, Yao had many powerhouses that served her, and some of them were much stronger even than these four, but since she had chosen to send them to kill Xun, she must be fully confident in their abilities.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Yao wanted to show off.</p>

  <p>'Xun, these people were the closest to you, but they have chosen to betray you. What qualifications do you have to fight with me?'</p>

  <p>Yao thought to herself arrogantly. This was exactly the reason why she had sent Salvador, Aneisha, Viveca and Elspeth.</p>

  <p>Hearing Xun's voice suddenly change, Luo Luo Zheng controlled the Reincarnation Plate as he rapidly advanced. He turned his head and stared blankly at Xun, seeing her pain and disappointment.</p>

  <p>However, he didn't know how to comfort her.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>At this moment, there was another violent vibration.</p>

  <p>One of the four was a martial artist in a white robe. He held a pale green long spear in his hands. With the thrust of his spear, he had nearly flipped the entire Reincarnation Plate over!</p>

  <p>"His spear attack is so strong!" Luo Zheng's eyes narrowed as he tried to control the divine textures. It was only with great difficulty that he finally managed to stabilize the Reincarnation Plate.</p>

  <p>Just then, Xun said, "Let me talk to them."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng remained silent as he activated another divine texture. Then, Xun's voice drifted out from within the Reincarnation Plate.</p>
