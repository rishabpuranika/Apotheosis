</p>

  <p>Woody's face had signs of clear dissatisfaction. Max, however, asked,</p>

  <p>"I'm not in a hurry. But Luo Zheng, why do you want to borrow the Eight-diagram Wheel?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled and explained, "I have an enemy who is hiding in the Central Region and I want to kill him before I leave. Our feud has gone on long enough, I believe."</p>

  <p>Those who knew about Simon were really surprised when they heard Zheng's resolution. He wanted to kill his enemy right now? More importantly, it was Simon he wanted to kill?</p>

  <p>The way they saw it, although Simon was building up his forces, he was still not as flippant and impudent as Eddie was. In fact, he could even be described as cautious in his actions. The World Commercial Alliance was well informed and had a remarkable number of intelligence sources in the Central Region, but they couldn't be able to find him anytime soon.</p>

  <p>An interesting aspect about people whose cultivation had reached a realm higher than the Soul Sea Realm was that their temper was known to be short. They were already impatient and would get pissed off real soon. Furthermore, they didn't seem to have a good rapport with Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Dillon spoke up and tried to warn Luo Zheng, "Luo Zheng, a clever rabbit has three burrows. It's going to take us a long time before we can unearth Simon's location. If he finds out that you've returned to the Central Region, he might even not dare to show up. Please take your time."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng waved off the warning. How could he allow Simon to pose potential danger to him? If chances were that Simon would stay in seclusion and become a hermit who stood aloof from worldly matters, Luo Zheng might have let him go. After all, he didn't like killing, but he was determined to kill his enemies without fail. If the person in front of him was not guilty beyond forgiveness, he would let him or her go.</p>

  <p>However, Simon was the kind of person who did not know what was good for him and actually wanted to try and reestablish the Heavenly Evil Sect. He had even tried that while Luo Zheng was away from the Central Region, which meant that Luo Zheng wasn't going to let him go so easily.</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's such a trifle for us. It won't take too much time." Max nodded and continued, "Alright then. Tell us where he is hiding, and I'll have Hank control the Eight-diagram Wheel and follow you."</p>

  <p>Woody's face was filled with indignation. In his opinion, it was one thing that Luo Zheng was an outstanding and talented warrior, but this guy was most likely just a swindler or a nobody at the Life and Death Realm. How could he be allowed to order them around? To be direct and blunt, Woody felt that Luo Zheng was not qualified.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng wasn't even looking at Woody. He thanked Max, "Thank you so much."</p>

  <p>He then turned towards Ning Yudie and Mu Ning and told them, "You guys hang on. I'll be right back!"</p>

  <p>"But Luo Zheng, Simon..." Dillon was still worried.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng gave him a calm smile to set him ease. "Mr. Shi, don't worry. I know what I'm doing."</p>

  <p>With a slight whistle, the Ancestral Dragon left Margaret's arms and jumped into Zheng's, who then stepped onto the Eight-diagram Wheel.</p>

  <p>Considering Zheng's extremely high speed and factoring in the size of the Central Region, it would take him at least two to three days to find and kill Simon. This was because he would have to waste a lot of time unearthing his enemy. But with the help of the Eight-diagram Wheel, it would take him less than an hour to traverse the entire Central Region.</p>

  <p>After he got on the wheel, a thought flashed through his mind and memories of the great world began to appear next.</p>

  <p>The memories then expanded and began to encompass everything in this great world, including all the continents, oceans, skies, birds, and beasts.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the time span also increased and he could see through the very fabric of time into the remote ages.</p>

  <p>After a few moments of investigation, Luo Zheng managed to lock onto Simon's position. "There you are!" His eyes flashed gently before he told Hank where Simon was.</p>

  <p>As the wheel started to rotate lightly, Luo Zheng and the others started to gradually ascend into the sky. Then, out of the blue, their speed suddenly increased and like a shooting star, they became a straight line and disappeared into the horizon within three seconds.</p>

  <p>"Their speed is remarkable!" Dillon looked at the disappearing Eight-diagram Wheel and sighed.</p>

  <p>Hobbes shook his head and remarked, "You know what, Zheng's level of contact with the world is no longer something we can understand."</p>

  <p>Three years ago, Luo Zheng was just a newbie, but still a rising star in the Central Region. Today, the tables had turned and he had become a figure that these guys looked up to. In fact, they could hardly have reached him now.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie asked with a smile on her face, "But he's still the Luo Zheng we know, isn't he?"</p>

  <p>Hearing this, the three leaders nodded at the same time. Luo Zheng had been able to kill Eddie when he was only at the middle stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm. Now, he had broken through into the Life and Death Realm, and his strength was even more unfathomable, yet he was still as friendly to them as ever. He wasn't pushy and overbearing and wasn't overly proud of himself. It was a great fortune indeed to have Luo Zheng as their friend.</p>

  <p>The southern area of the Central Region had been marked by the Southern Sky Mountain some time ago.</p>

  <p>It was a famous mountain in the Central Region, but some time ago, every single mountain in this place had been destroyed.</p>

  <p>Naturally, Southern Sky Mountain was no exception. After it was destroyed, a tributary of a big river flowed in, submerging the entire area and converting it into a swamp.</p>

  <p>As Simon looked at this swamp, filled with mud and decay, his eyes revealed a hint of anger.</p>

  <p>In the early days, he had lived in seclusion in the Dreamy Swampland for hundreds of years, and he was already tired of that sight. Afterwards, he had finally managed to establish the Heavenly Evil Sect with Eddie, which had changed his life. Bu then Luo Zheng had destroyed the sect, and killed Eddie.</p>

  <p>When these events had taken place, Simon was trembling with fear, which was why he had escaped. Now as he thought about it, he regretted that. He had been either too cautious, or worse yet, too timid. Therefore, he had missed a great opportunity to kill Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie had been attacked by the Life and Death Wind, so she was most definitely dead now. Eddie had managed to get rid of the Ancient Tycoon of the World Commercial Alliance. The three leaders of the alliance alone could pose no real threat to Simon. Therefore, as long as he managed to kill Luo Zheng, no one in the Central Region could defeat him.</p>

  <p>When that day came, he would be able to establish his own divine kingdom, unify the entire Central Region, and become the first sole ruler of a divine kingdom in tens of thousands of years.</p>

  <p>After he had escaped from Oracle City, something like a bug was constantly biting at his warrior spirit. However, life didn't have an undo button. Since he had missed an opportunity, he couldn't go back and find it again, and it was going to be extremely difficult to find another one now.</p>

  <p>However, after finding out that Luo Zheng had left the Central Region, Simon had become restless again.</p>

  <p>The combination of the three fat leaders of the alliance was powerful, yes, but they could not do anything to him. If he really managed to reestablish the Heavenly Evil Sect, Oracle City was too far gone to be able to stand up against him.</p>

  <p>It was difficult for him to withhold this thought. Luo Zheng had gone to the Divine Kingdom Continent which was marked with countless powerhouses. It was very likely that he wouldn't be able to return anytime soon. For Simon, this was probably the second opportunity he craved for so badly.</p>

  <p>He had already wasted the previous one, and he did not want to do the same on his next one. In the end, he decided to take actions.</p>

  <p>During the last few years, he had often sent people to scout the situation inside Oracle City. Ning Yudie was the only Life and Death Realm martial artist in the city, but hurt by the Life and Death Wind, she had been in a deep slumber. If Eddie were still alive, he would have directly stormed his way into the city.</p>

  <p>However, Simon had always been a cautious and maybe even a paranoid person. He was afraid of being cheated and wanted to send people to assassinate Ning Yudie first.</p>

  <p>To his disappointment, the Heavenly Stellar Palace was so well-protected that he had yet to make a move.</p>

  <p>Today, Simon had gathered part of the old members of the Heavenly Evil Sect to discuss this issue.</p>

  <p>Before their meeting could convene, he suddenly saw a thin line appear in the sky. Like a shooting star it was, only the moment that it appeared, it shot towards him at an extremely fast pace. Its speed was just indescribable!</p>

  <p>"What's that?" Simon's eyelids twitched. He didn't know why, but he had a bad premonition in his heart about this. However, he couldn't pinpoint where it came from.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing his words, several, or rather all the subordinates of the Heavenly Evil Sect also raised their heads and turned around to look at the strange, newly-appeared object.</p>

  <p>"It's an abnormal phenomenon!"</p>

  <p>"Thank you for stating the obvious!"</p>

  <p>"Are we going to get a secret treasure today?"</p>

  <p>"Should we fly up and take a look?"</p>

  <p>No one could figure out where the streak had come from, and their faces were full of curiosity. Perhaps Simon was the only one who had a bad feeling about this.</p>

  <p>However, as it flew, the line, which had originally been flying parallel to the ground, slightly changed its direction and began heading straight towards Simon and his men.</p>

  <p>Simon's eyes opened wide as a sense of danger arose from the depths of his soul. Although he still couldn't see clearly what it was, he was sure that it definitely wasn't a good thing for him. What if that thing hit him?</p>

  <p>The momentum it carried was terrifying due to its high speed and he still didn't know what or how heavy it was!</p>

  <p>Only six seconds after the Eight-diagram Wheel had appeared in front of Simon, it steadily stopped above him and began to descend.</p>

  <p>When Zheng's figure appeared in front of Simon, his entire body was like a carved stone. He was terrified instantly.</p>
