<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>With his weapon broken by Zheng, Emanuel's eyes flashed pleadingly as he continued, "Zheng, I am an elder of Cloud Hall. Even I've committed a crime of rebellion, it shall be Yudie who will decide my fate. I…</p>

  <p>I surrender! You can't kill me!"</p>

  <p>His words made Zheng hesitate.</p>

  <p>Strictly speaking, what he said was true— Emanuel was the backbone among the elders of the Cloud Hall, making his status and position both higher than those of Zheng. In fact, Zheng was merely a disciple of the Cloud Hall without any promotions.</p>

  <p>As long as Zheng didn't kill him, Emanuel understood that he could use the influence of the Zhuo Clan to have Yudie spare his life at the very least.</p>

  <p>As long as he didn't die right there, he would have a chance at a comeback sooner or later. Who knew what the future held?</p>

  <p>Many people in Cloud Hall were standing by the windows or at the corners of the buildings, watching the scene unfold in the air above Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>In this rebellion, the majority of the Cloud Hall disciples had chosen to stay neutral. After all, it was a matter of internal strife among the senior leaders and had little to do with the common warriors of the Cloud Hall's lower ranks.</p>

  <p>"Oh my god… Zheng is back! He's chasing after Master Zhuo with bare hands!"</p>

  <p>"This kid is a real freak. After disappearing for two years, he's back and he's fighting against Master Zhuo!"</p>

  <p>"Are you guys blind? Master Zhuo can barely strike. This isn't a fight… he's completely crushing him. Don't you understand?"</p>

  <p>To most of the people within Cloud Hall, it didn't matter who took control of the place. At this moment, all they cared about was watching a good show.</p>

  <p>Some of the younger generation from the influential clans weren't in a good mood, particularly those from the Zhuo Clan. When they saw how Emanuel was being pushed back relentlessly by Zheng, their expressions grew grimmer. Their cultivation levels were too low— they weren't strong enough to participate in the fight.</p>

  <p>Standing in the Elite House was Frank who had been staring blankly at how Zheng chased away his father and how he forced him to beg for mercy. Frank's face darkened as a rainstorm inside him loomed.</p>

  <p>As his heart grew heavy, he glared at Zheng, his heart filled with complicated thoughts.</p>

  <p>Back in the Cloud Road test, he was nothing short of arrogant.</p>

  <p>Back then, he appeared as though nobody in the world would succeed except him. Among the disciples of the younger generation, who could measure up to him? Frank had never had to take Zheng seriously.</p>

  <p>However, in only two years' time, Zheng had grown into a figure that even his father would find difficult to deal with. Meanwhile, Frank was still stuck at the ultimate level of the Illuminating Soul Realm, unable to match up to even Tianming or several others.</p>

  <p>How couldn't he be resentful?</p>

  <p>With Frank's heaven-level talent, his cultivation speed shouldn't have been so slow. It was just that at that time, Zheng had crippled one of his hands in the Cloud Hall. His warrior spirit then had suffered a great blow. With both physical and mental trauma, Frank spent a long time down in spirits.</p>

  <p>At this moment, all Frank wanted to do was jump in front of his father and protect him, but another Zhuo Clan disciple pulled him back and gave him a disapproving shake of his head, signaling him not to act so rashly. Zheng's strength had already surpassed anyone's imagination. If Frank stepped up, he would only bring shame to himself.</p>

  <p>In the air, Zheng had a moment's thought and any hesitation he had in his eyes disappeared in an instant. A murderous look replaced it. "You're right. I can't kill you, but I can kill you on behalf of Yudie!"</p>

  <p>With that, Zheng sneered and rushed toward Emanuel once again.</p>

  <p>Because he knew Emanuel was a cunning man who had attempted to kill him several times already, Zheng understood that nursing a viper in his bosom wouldn't bring him any good.</p>

  <p>Moreover, this time, Emanuel's goal was to kill off Yudie.</p>

  <p>If he were only after usurping the leader's position of Cloud Hall, Zheng wouldn't have cared so much. With his current cultivation level, the Cloud Hall wasn't even that significant. But if Emanuel wanted to kill Yudie, he would be courting death by Zheng's hands.</p>

  <p>In this world, there weren't many women worthy of Zheng's attention— Yudie was one of them. Anyone who dared hurt the woman he cared for dearly would instantly become his enemy.</p>

  <p>Back then, when Eddie took Yan away, Zheng was no match for him. Yet, he didn't feel afraid of him— Emanuel was far worse than Eddie in strength, after all.</p>

  <p>Seeing Zheng charging toward him, Emanuel's heart sank. With grief and indignation, he said, "Zheng… you're too ruthless!"</p>

  <p>"Since you dared to put your hands on Yudie, you must be prepared to die!"</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he already drew out his long sword.</p>

  <p>Seeing the weapon's radiance glinting off the surface, Emanuel's expression was filled with despair. "Who is Yudie to you that you would go to such lengths to protect her? Whatever she can give you, I can offer too!"</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Barely listening to Emanuel's plea, Zheng slashed his sword. The sword intent spread into a crescent shape heading straight to his enemy. With an ironic smile, he responded, "Sorry, I'm not interested."</p>

  <p>To block the sword intent, Emanuel pulled out a spare spear from his space ring. Realizing that nothing he said would make Zheng back down, he became hysterical and began shouting, "Zheng, you're just Yudie's toyboy! The Cloud Hall is unfair...Yudie is unfair!"</p>

  <p>Knowing that he wouldn't be escaping death, Emanuel could only shout in despair and throw dirt at Zheng and Yudie with his words.</p>

  <p>Hearing his insults, Zheng was taken aback before he smiled maliciously, "I see… it looks like the rumors in Cloud Hall were started by you?"</p>

  <p>When Zheng had just entered Cloud Hall, he had received special attention from Yudie, sparking rumors among the disciples that Zheng was her secret lover— the disciples regarded him as a pretty boy that Yudie had taken a fancy to.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it was me. Am I wrong? You're nothing but an adulterous couple!"</p>

  <p>Brandishing his spear, he went straight at Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng effortlessly blocked Emanuel's attack with the back of his hand.</p>

  <p>Easily, he landed three strikes in succession. His long sword was a high-grade sacred weapon so how could Emanuel's top-grade fairy weapon ever defend against its power? The weapon in Emanuel's hands instantly shattered into pieces.</p>

  <p>"You're wrong," Zheng said, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>Emanuel simply threw away the broken spear and fished out another as he coldly returned, "You have the guts to do it, but you can't even admit it. Zheng, you're not all that!"</p>

  <p>Unable to match Zheng in a one-on-one battle, Emanuel's last resort was to distract him with petty insults. Perhaps he would find an opening to strike.</p>

  <p>But he underestimated Zheng's state of mind.</p>

  <p>All Zheng had to do was casually thrust his sword forward, using his "No Move" technique in the strike. It was impossible for Emanuel to see through the strike, let alone to block. The long sword hit his chest and pierced through his heart in an instant.</p>

  <p>"I am not Yudie's secret lover. You should get your facts right. Yudie is my woman."</p>

  <p>As Zheng pulled out his sword, blood began spurting from Emanuel's chest— his body looked like a kite that had lost its string, falling limp to the ground.</p>

  <p>A heart-wrenching scream came from below, "Father!"</p>

  <p>Watching the scene was Frank, wide-eyed and distraught.</p>

  <p>But Zheng only glanced at Frank indifferently before flying towards the Ice Palace, leaving everyone in Cloud Hall stunned in shock.</p>

  <p>But the shock wasn't because Zheng had killed Emanuel, instead, it was because of his last sentence— Yudie was his woman?</p>

  <p>They didn't know whether or not his words were true, but if he dared to say it in front of such a large audience, then perhaps it was true.</p>

  <p>Words failed to describe how they felt. Yudie was someone with a pristine reputation, not only in Cloud Hall, but in the entire Central Region. The woman was flawlessly beautiful and had incomparable talent and status to match. These things made her the perfect woman and a noble, superior leader in their hearts. How could she have suddenly become Zheng's woman?</p>

  <p>It was unbelievable.</p>

  <p>Just then, Zheng heard Xun from behind him, "Hey, since when did Yudie become your woman?"</p>

  <p>With a slight smile, he answered, "I was bragging."</p>

  <p>The Ice Palace was situated at the highest point of the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>Although many of the elders at the Internal Elixir Realm hadn't left the place, they had already seen the outcome of the battle— Emanuel was cleanly defeated by Zheng. The elders who had been part of the rebelling force completely gave up resisting.</p>

  <p>The rebellious elders who were at the Virtual Tribulation Realm were weaker than Emanuel so if they were to resist, they would be courting death just as Emanuel did. All they could do was surrender obediently and wait for the Cloud Hall's punishment. Having the support of several big clans behind them, it was unlikely that they would be killed. Still, they couldn't escape punishment.</p>
