  <p>
</p>

  <p>The woman had explained to Zheng, but he still could not have a clear understanding about it all.</p>

  <p>After all, her statement was just based on her own inference. She hadn't obtained the True Demon Body yet.</p>

  <p>For the meantime, Zheng didn't dare to try the cold air anymore. He could only watch the cold air gush upwards.</p>

  <p>He came to a conclusion that maybe the whole place was covered with ice and snow because of the eruption of the ice volcano.</p>

  <p>They stood still and waited. It was about five minutes later that the cold air in the cave began to weaken. Seeing the change, they became alert as it indicated the second interval.</p>

  <p>The woman moved her legs and stepped at the edge of the groove. At the same time, the clones of the Holy Beings arranged their postures as if they were also ready to fight.</p>

  <p>She did this to force every one of the alliance of the powerful clans to continue to go down. Moreover, she had to prevent the Holy Beings located below from going up to fight her.</p>

  <p>"It's time to go down," the woman pronounced, looking at Nicholas and his group thousands of feet away.</p>

  <p>"I don't need you to remind me," Nicholas responded in a cold voice.</p>

  <p>The members of the alliance of powerful clans had already been prepared.</p>

  <p id="top_30">They were just waiting for the right timing to make a move. As soon as the cold air made a complete stop, everyone leaped and left the second groove.</p>

  <p>They straightaway flew to the third groove about six thousand feet away.</p>

  <p>Nicholas was the first to arrive.</p>

  <p>Looking around, he noticed that the third groove was deeper and wider than the second one.</p>

  <p>As soon as he stepped on the ground, he maintained sharp vigilance. He was fully alert being reminded by the woman's warning that he might encounter trouble at the third groove.</p>

  <p>He narrowed his eyes and saw that some faint yellow lights flashed at the end of the groove.</p>

  <p>"Eggs? What kind of eggs are they?"</p>

  <p>Clark's curious voice sounded behind him. He arrived shortly after Nicholas and followed behind. He also noticed the faint yellow lights.</p>

  <p>Seven or eight things shaped like bird eggs clustered together.</p>

  <p>The lights on the eggs were very steady at first, but Clark's loud voice made the lights brighter in an instant. A trace of bright red even faintly appeared at the very front end of the eggs, and a strong energy was forming within it.</p>

  <p>Nicholas didn't know what kind of eggs they were, but he speculated out of instinct. He then immediately spoke and warned everyone with his life vitality, "Everyone, shut up. Land carefully, and don't make any sound."</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings, the Demi-holy Beings and the consummate True Gods, who were still following behind, were a bit taken aback by the sudden warning as they had no idea what was going on.</p>

  <p>But since Nicholas had given an order, they had to follow it.</p>

  <p>As each of them arrived, they cautiously went in and landed without any noise just like how they were instructed to.</p>

  <p>There were over a hundred people but the surrounding was deadly still despite their movement.</p>

  <p>The sound of the cold air gushing upwards had already disappeared, and the whole ice volcano became so quiet that they could even hear a pin drop.</p>

  <p>No one dared make a sound. Nicholas was observing closely until the bird eggs in the corner of the wall didn't have any reaction. He breathed a sigh of relief and opened his mouth slightly. He said through life vitality, "Just now, Clark's loud voice startled the eggs, but fortunately... We have to be careful."</p>

  <p>"What the hell are they?" Jeremiah asked through life vitality, staring at the bird eggs.</p>

  <p>They could not feel the breath of life from the eggs, but they sensed that faint energy was flowing within them.</p>

  <p>Nicholas shook his head and said, "I don't know. We just need to stay here for about five minutes and then leave carefully."</p>

  <p>He had always been on the lead dealing with the danger in the Abyss Demon Region. He was counted as the first person to come forward and protect everyone.</p>

  <p>But there were still many things in this world that had already exceeded his abilities. For now, he could only try not to provoke these things.</p>

  <p>Samuel's heart raced when he saw the bird eggs.</p>

  <p>His judgment was similar to Nicholas'. The eggs might explode at any time they were stimulated.</p>

  <p>If he made a way for the eggs to explode and then escaped with the help of the Spear of Supreme Harmony, perhaps he could kill Nicholas.</p>

  <p>But after a careful consideration, it didn't take long before he dropped the idea.</p>

  <p>The energy that was contained in the bird eggs was indeed powerful, but it might not be able to put Nicholas to death.</p>

  <p>Moreover, he alone was probably unable to deal with the woman above. If there was really a chance to fight for the True Demon Body, his chances of getting it alone would be slim.</p>

  <p>At this moment, he decided to continue to wait. He could only wait patiently for the right opportunity to make a move.</p>

  <p>"Hoo, hoo, hoo..."</p>

  <p>The cold air at the bottom of the ice volcano blew upwards once again.</p>

  <p>With the sound disturbing the silence, the wind that was whistling past did not even stimulate the bird eggs.</p>

  <p>The members of the alliance of the powerful clans could keep their breaths on purpose and make no sound, but the woman was different.</p>

  <p>"Why is it so quiet?" the woman grumbled at the second groove. Her voice reached the others' ears. "Looks like there are no Cold Fiends at the third groove. I guess there are Explosive Crystals instead. I'm afraid that it's not about the death of some Holy Beings. If they explode, all of you will die."</p>

  <p>All members of the alliance of the powerful clans felt astonished to hear what she just said.</p>

  <p>Everyone's eyes turned to gaze at the bird eggs in the cave at the same time.</p>

  <p>The surface of each bird egg emitted a bright red color, and it was getting bigger and bigger.</p>

  <p>Even the consummate True Gods could feel that the bird eggs might explode at any time.</p>

  <p>All people's hearts were in their mouths.</p>

  <p>"Shut up!" Clark suddenly roared.</p>

  <p>He was smart enough to transmit his voice through life vitality.</p>

  <p>Zheng and Sword Chen felt that Clark's voice was like the thunder exploding in their ears. The roar of a Holy Being was enough to heavily injure the ordinary True Gods.</p>

  <p>"I can shut up," the woman spoke back, unperturbed.</p>

  <p>Hearing her answer, the Holy Beings showed a strange expression. When did this woman become open to persuasion?</p>

  <p>Just then, a thunderous sound suddenly came from above.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>"Damn it! It's the Wood Divine Thunder!" a Holy Being instantly proclaimed in anger.</p>

  <p>The woman did not speak, but asked one of the cloned Holy Beings to activate the Wood Divine Thunder of the Thunderstorm Godly Way.</p>

  <p>The violent exploding sound was much louder than her voice as it spread from top to bottom.</p>

  <p>The bright red color spread over until it reached the entire surface of the bird eggs at the depths of the groove.</p>

  <p>The bird eggs reacted as terrible energy madly surged inside them.</p>

  <p>Once the energy exploded in the small space, everyone present would surely die.</p>

  <p>Samuel placed his finger over the space ring, ready to activate it at any time. He would never want to die with Nicholas in this place.</p>

  <p>Nicholas shook his head slightly. He had no choice but to take action again.</p>

  <p>He flipped his palm and a light green cloth bag appeared.</p>

  <p>The surface of the cloth bag emitted the strong internal momentum of the Timing Godly Way.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!".</p>

  <p>With a flash, he rushed to the bird eggs at an extremely fast speed. Once near, he enveloped the bird eggs using his cloth bag.</p>

  <p>"Puff!"</p>

  <p>Just as he had finished, a dull explosion sound was heard. The cloth bag was immediately swollen like a ball. It had actually gathered the explosive power of the Explosive Crystals.</p>
