  <p>The harsh words that tumbled out of Saint Viana's mouth saddened Mu Ning quite deeply. It seemed like it had reminded her of something so painful, that it made her inconsolable to the point of not saying a word. The grieving look in her eyes looked quite heartbreaking!</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>At that moment, a beam of silver light that came from the ground shot at Saint Viana.</p>

  <p>In turn, he slightly waved his hand and simply flicked the flash of light away.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Luo Luo Zheng had jumped right onto Aura's flying chariot, which was more than one hundred feet from the ground and stood next to her.</p>

  <p>"You old thing! How can you bully a little girl just because you are older? It's really a shame, a shame!" he said.</p>

  <p>Now, Mu Ning was Luo Zheng's master in martial arts even if she was only several years older than Luo Luo Zheng. However, Luo Luo Zheng had said that she was only a little girl, which made her feel somewhat strange. However, compared to Saint Viana who was more than 360 years old--she had to admit that she could be called a little girl indeed.</p>

  <p>A smell emanated from Luo Luo Zheng who stood in front of Mu Ning, and she noticed it. She knew that he was just as nervous as her.</p>

  <p>The masters of Cloud Sect and all the noble clans knew why Mu Ning came to Cloud Sect and was willing to be a humble master at Drizzle Peak.</p>

  <p>The reason why she came here wasn't a secret, but no one had ever spoken it out.</p>

  <p>Nobody had dared to remind the reason in front of Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>When she reached Drizzle Peak, Mu Ning hoped that she could forget everything about that and adapt herself to her new life as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>However, Saint Viana had ruined that today when he spoke out the reason without consideration of Aura's feelings, which made her suffer a seemingly endless pain.</p>

  <p>It was a relief that Luo Luo Zheng could stand up to help her.</p>

  <p>Saint Viana's eyebrows shot up angrily at Luo Zheng's words. He was positively fuming with anger.</p>

  <p>"What did you say? What have you said just now?</p>

  <p>Are you afraid to say it again?" he questioned Luo Luo Zheng angrily. Since Saint Viana was one of the ten saints of Cloud Sect who were always adored by the people, and led comfortable lives just like immortals, no one dared to offend him.</p>

  <p>However, this boy in front of him dared talk to him impertinently. It infuriated Saint Viana who was already inherently irritable. This was a fight around the corner waiting to happen!</p>

  <p>Yet, Luo Luo Zheng didn't seem to be bothered by this as he firmly stood by his convictions.</p>

  <p>"What? Am I wrong?</p>

  <p>You are hundreds of years old. Aren't you an old thing?</p>

  <p>My master is only 20 years old. Compared to you, she is only a little girl, but should you bully such a little girl? It's true! Why am I afraid to say that again?" Luo Luo Zheng said in a serious voice.</p>

  <p>He then turned around to Mu Ning and asked, "Master Su, am I right?"</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng turned to her, Aura's orbs locked with Luo Zheng's. His words had moved her deeply. Ever since Luo Luo Zheng went to Cloud Sect, he had been causing troubles but now, he had bravely stood up to help her just in time?</p>

  <p>He really was a good person.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning nodded at Luo Luo Zheng and turned to look at Saint Viana. "Yes, why is he afraid to say it again? Saint Viana, it is nothing if he says it again. He can also say it for hundreds or thousands of times, or even make it up as a song or a poem to sing or recite everywhere, but what can you do about it?" she said coldly.</p>

  <p>Her words were truth, but only added fuel to the fire that was Saint Viana's temper.</p>

  <p>"You! Mu Ning, don't think that you being in a noble position can prevent me from killing your disciple in front of you!" Saint Viana said in a bitingly cold tone.</p>

  <p>Right now, he really had a strong intention to kill Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Despite his threat, a smile graced Aura's lips and her eyes were full of determination. "Yes, you can. Of course you can. But can you kill me?" she said.</p>

  <p>"No, of course I can't kill you because you belong to the royal family with a noble position--but you can never stop me from killing the boy standing by you!" Saint Viana harshly replied. At this, Mu Ning only raised one fine brow.</p>

  <p>"Sure, I can't stop you from killing him, but..." She deliberately paused in her words and turned over her slender hand. A token appeared, and etched on it were the words "the Emperor." The token she held was the Emperor's Token which could command the man in the Burning Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>All of their eyes were transfixed on the token in Aura's hand.</p>

  <p>"Have you ever seen the token? If you kill him, I will use the Emperor's Token to order the man in the Burning Sky Palace to kill you. I believe you can't run away even if you hide yourself to the ends of the earth!"</p>

  <p>Mu Ning shot back. She looked really serious and her determined voice made people know that she would resist until the very last moment.</p>

  <p>The arrogance was suddenly drained from Saint Viana's face when he saw the token.</p>

  <p>As a saint of Cloud Sect, killing a person in front of the princess was not a big deal!</p>

  <p>But...</p>

  <p>The princess had the Emperor's Token!</p>

  <p>However, the Emperor's Token was too valuable for the little girl to just use it to save an insignificant outer disciple!</p>

  <p>"Will you waste an Emperor's Token to save this guy?" he asked in a low voice.</p>

  <p>His aggressiveness awhile ago seemed to be replaced by calmness for now.</p>

  <p>"How will you know if you don't try?" Mu Ning said coolly.</p>

  <p>Her words shocked Saint Viana and his face wore an unreadable expression. "Okay! But you have so many things to deal with in Cloud Sect, you can't keep him alive all the time!</p>

  <p>What's more, even if I forgive him now, Cloud Sect won't forgive him, since he has killed a disciple of Cloud Sect. He has broken the Sect's rules and everyone knows, so you can't help him even though you are the princess!" he said angrily.</p>

  <p>"I won't give protection to Luo Luo Zheng if he really did something wrong, but punish him according to the rules of Cloud Sect. However, you as a saint, just want to kill Luo Luo Zheng without any forethought, so could you tell me why?" she asked back in return.</p>

  <p>Even though Saint Viana had changed topics to Cloud Sect's rules, Mu Ning was quite clever and she surely had something to say in defense.</p>

  <p>Now, Saint Viana only grunted wordlessly in response. Then after a while, he said, "Anyway, this boy must give a reason why he killed the disciple today!"</p>
