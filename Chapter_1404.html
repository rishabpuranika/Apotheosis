<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Tenth Tribulation Introducing Pill couldn't have lost its effectiveness already, could it?</p>

  <p>The tribulation Luo Zheng had attracted was not the tenth small Heavenly Tribulation, but the sixth. Actually, even if he hadn't used the Tenth Tribulation Introducing Pill, the tribulation would still have descended because his cultivation had already reached that level. This was disappointing to Luo Zheng, to say the least.</p>

  <p>Why had the small Heavenly Tribulation still not shown up?</p>

  <p>Yolande glanced at Layla and frowned. She had also been looking forward to Zheng's small Heavenly Tribulation. Although it wasn't the tenth one, she was still able to observe how many petals Zheng's Lotus Flower would sprout.</p>

  <p>However, Layla's expression made Yolande dislike her. There was a hint of condescension in her eyes, and it was unbecoming in Yolande's opinion. Layla didn't seem to know that Luo Zheng had actually purposefully held back his strength in the Illusion Space and, as a result, had lost to her brother. Why didn't he explain it to her?</p>

  <p>Now, only Luo Zheng had yet to undergo his tribulation.</p>

  <p>It was impossible for other warriors to just wait like this. Normally, after the Tenth Tribulation Introducing Pill was used, it would usually trigger the Heavenly Tribulation within two hours. Other than the special case of Layla, it was impossible for a warrior to bring down the Heavenly Tribulation after two hours.</p>

  <p>Someone suggested that the old man in cotton clothes remove the seal.</p>

  <p>This meant that the Passing the Torch would have come to an end.</p>

  <p>The old man greatly admired Luo Zheng in his heart. However, since his small Heavenly Tribulation had not come, it was likely that it would not come.</p>

  <p>He was very confident about this point and sadly nodded his head.</p>

  <p>"Alright!"</p>

  <p>With that, he waved his hand, preparing to completely remove the seal and end the Passing the Torch.</p>

  <p>However, at this moment, streaks of golden light suddenly appeared in the sky, drawing the attention of everyone present.</p>

  <p>After the streaks of golden light appeared, they intertwined with each other like little golden snakes writhing in the sky.</p>

  <p>"Huh?" When the old man saw the small golden snakes, his face revealed a surprised expression. "What are they?"</p>

  <p>The gazes of many palace leaders, Yolande, the lord of the Sunset World, and the others all uniformly shot towards the air above Zheng's head. Their faces were all filled with strange and uncertain expressions. The golden light reflected off their faces as they looked up to the sky.</p>

  <p>And in the same instance as these little golden snakes appeared, a faint image of the Lotus Flower appeared above Zheng's head!</p>

  <p>"It's here! Zheng's sixth small Heavenly Tribulation!"</p>

  <p>"What are you so excited about? It's just the sixth small Heavenly Tribulation. Which one of us has not experienced this before?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was at the fifth grade of the Life and Death Realm, and it was indeed the lowest here. It was not a ranking to be particularly excited about.</p>

  <p>Among the warriors of the thirteen palaces, there was no one who was weaker than him in terms of cultivation level.</p>

  <p>They had all experienced the sixth small Heavenly Tribulation, so there was nothing to be surprised about. However, with Luo Zheng, they had discovered that things were rarely as plain as they seemed.</p>

  <p>As for Layla, there was a faint smile in the corner of her mouth as she raised her head to look at Luo Zheng. He had always been truly strange in her eyes. She had previously had to wait for her tenth small Heavenly Tribulation, which was within reason. After all, the heavens needed time to brew the power of the Heavenly Tribulation. The more powerful the Heavenly Tribulation was, the more time it needed.</p>

  <p>It was indeed a very strange thing that Luo Zheng had been waiting for his sixth small Heavenly Tribulation for even longer than her. Was there something special about his sixth small Heavenly Tribulation?</p>

  <p>'I don't know how many petals Zheng's Lotus Flower sprouted the last time.' As she thought of this, Layla stared at Zheng's Lotus Flower, which was slowly solidifying in the air above his head. It was becoming less and less translucent, and the glow intensified, bathing Luo Zheng in golden light.</p>

  <p>However, as the Lotus Flower gradually solidified, Layla's frown slowly deepened, and the pupils in her eyes also grew larger. Her expression was mixed, a twisted reflection of her tumultuous emotions.</p>

  <p>Not just Layla was in conflict!</p>

  <p>At this moment, the lord of the Sunset World, many other palace leaders, and the gathered warriors of the thirteen palaces, as well as the old man in cotton clothes, were all staring at the air above Zheng's head. Jealousy was quite evident on many of their faces, while others stood in awe.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had actually activated the Mahayana Lotus Flower!</p>

  <p>What was even more terrifying was that not only was there a total of nine petals sprouting from the bottom, but there were also twenty-six petals rising from the apex. There was an astounding total of thirty-five petals!</p>

  <p>Layla's Lotus Flower had sprouted fourteen petals, which had already been very eye-catching. She was revealed to be countless times more talented than they had imagined. They had not held much hope for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>After all, Luo Zheng was only going through his sixth small Heavenly Tribulation, and the gap between it and the tenth one was still quite large.</p>

  <p>This tribulation should not have been significant at all.</p>

  <p>However, the sudden appearance of the Thirty-five-petal Lotus Flower made them unable to think clearly. It was mind boggling!</p>

  <p>"Could it be fake?" someone murmured, overcome by envy.</p>

  <p>Many warriors had the same thought and they glanced around nervously.</p>

  <p>It was indeed hard for them to accept the sight of the Mahayana Lotus Flower. No one wanted to accuse Luo Zheng of foul play, but they were all reluctant to admit that his power was perhaps even more powerful than they had believed.</p>

  <p>"How can it be fake? How can this thing be fake?" someone queried.</p>

  <p>"But if this guy has now activated the Mahayana Lotus Flower, then why is he still only at the fifth grade of the Life and Death Realm?" another person asked, frowning at the sight of Luo Zheng with the Lotus Flower above Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>"How should I know?"</p>

  <p>Yolande had a faint and satisfied smile on her face. When Luo Zheng had earlier passed the test of the Red Cloud Ring, she had secretly already deduced that he had activated the Mahayana Lotus Flower.</p>

  <p>However, she hadn't thought it possible that not only had Luo Zheng activated the Mahayana Lotus Flower, but it had sprouted twenty-six petals. If there was one more petal, the Mahayana Lotus Flower would be in a perfect state.</p>

  <p>Even though Yolande had a premonition about the situation, she still felt rather surprised as she looked speculatively at the scene.</p>

  <p>She had read through the memories of her earlier clones in detail and understood that Luo Zheng couldn't be judged by ordinary measures. He had always defied expectations.</p>

  <p>"Yolande, you already knew about this?" asked the lord of the Sunset World as he saw the satisfied smile hovering on her face.</p>

  <p>"Know about what?" Yolande played dumb.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng has activated the Mahayana Lotus Flower," he continued to push, as his widened eyes examined her face.</p>

  <p>Yolande smiled, "I guessed so, but I hadn't expected that his Mahayana Lotus Flower would have already sprouted so many petals."</p>

  <p>The world lord's gaze was complicated. There was a mix of fear, respect and concern in his eyes. "I'm afraid the future of this fellow is not something that the human race could ever control." He looked rather worried.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Yolande did not say anything. However, she thought to herself, 'No race can control him. Furthermore, strictly speaking, he has already joined the Celestial Position race.'</p>

  <p>She couldn't simply tell the world lord this though. As for Zheng's future, she would follow her usual attitude and let the nature take its course.</p>

  <p>However, she looked forward to seeing Luo Zheng develop further. It was exciting to watch.</p>

  <p>Layla stared blankly at the Lotus Flower in the sky. The look in her eyes became more and more complicated. Frustration and envy flooded her.</p>

  <p>The pride that she had accumulated suddenly disappeared in this moment. The scene unfolding in front of her eyes allowed her to clearly sense the gap between her and Luo Zheng. This was a gap that could not be bridged. She was out of her league when compared to Luo Zheng, and she knew it.</p>

  <p>Strictly speaking, her Mahayana Lotus Flower had only sprouted five petals. Luo Zheng had outdone her by twenty-one petals!</p>

  <p>Furthermore, Layla had gone through the tenth small Heavenly Tribulation, while Luo Zheng was only at the fifth grade of the Life and Death Realm, which meant that he had only gone through five small Heavenly Tribulations. But his Mahayana Lotus Flower had already sprouted twenty-six petals.</p>

  <p>What Layla did not know was that Luo Zheng had already activated the Mahayana Lotus Flower during his first small Heavenly Tribulation, and that it had already sprouted twenty-six petals back then. If she knew, Layla might have passed out on the spot.</p>

  <p>Even now, she was still dealt a heavy blow. Her ego was in pieces at the monumental defeat.</p>

  <p>Although the Lotus Flower was an illusory existence, it was a measure of a warrior's chances of surpassing the heavens in the future.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, no one was able to predict when he would activate the Lotus Flower or how many petals it would sprout. No matter how Layla thought about it, she was still unable to change the fact that there was such an obvious gap between her and Luo Zheng. Now she had to face her own short comings.</p>

  <p>"This is too much..." Layla muttered these words in a low voice, almost sounding like a growl.</p>

  <p>She felt that Luo Zheng had gone too far, but she had forgotten that from beginning to end, he had never had the intention to compete against her.</p>

  <p>Even though he had attended the Passing the Torch, he had just wanted to obtain the reward and he wasn't concerned with the status the Lotus Flower bestowed.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, it was Layla who had targeted Luo Zheng from the beginning, and had even provoked him without any reason. But now, when she felt disappointed and wronged, she subconsciously began to believe that he had targeted her on purpose. She was laying the blame squarely at his feet.</p>

  <p>The golden snakes in the sky extended continuously after the Mahayana Lotus Flower appeared. They grew from a few feet to several dozen feet, then to several hundred feet. They spiraled in the air and shot towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The world lord's face changed when he saw the little golden snakes. He felt that these little golden snakes were a bit familiar. Suddenly, he seemed to remember something and cried, "Holy crap!"</p>
