<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>No. 12 watched the two human beings in the distance. After thinking for a while, he finally said, "Let's put out the lamps!"</p>

  <p>The Element Spirit race had initially sent out the Moon Fire Slaves in order to snatch the Other Shore Key from the two of them.</p>

  <p>It wasn't the Moon Fire Slaves' job to explore this dangerous place, or the temple in it.</p>

  <p>They figured it would be for the best if they stayed out of this dangerous place. However, now that they chased after them, it was inevitable that they had to enter that place.</p>

  <p>Having a large body, No. 13 made a big stride forward and reached out to touch the first lamp stand easily. After all, each Hidden Beast's movement could only cover an area with the diameter of two hundred feet.</p>

  <p>He pinched the black flame on the wick, extinguishing it instantly.</p>

  <p>However, being large in size also had its disadvantages. When No. 13 stretched out his hands to extinguish the black fire, the surrounding Hidden Beasts attacked him. His arms were then covered in grey marks from this.</p>

  <p>"No. 12. What should we do now?" No. 13 turned around and held his arms up in front of No. 12.</p>

  <p>To extinguish one Hidden Spirit Lamp, No. 13 had to be attacked so many times. If he put out the flames of a few more lamps, the attacks that he would suffer would probably not be less than that of No. 14!</p>

  <p>After surveying his surroundings, No. 12 said, "It seems that the design of this place only allows creatures under ten feet high to pass through. We need to shrink."</p>

  <p>The Moon Fire Slave was a kind of fire spirit. They could become large or small in size, even their armor adjusted to their size.</p>

  <p>No. 13 nodded. Immediately, the bodies of the two Moon Fire Slaves shrank. Their armor melted into a silver liquid. Finally, once the two had condensed to a height of roughly ten feet, their armors solidified, fitting them snugly.</p>

  <p>Now that they were small, they were able to move more nimbly.</p>

  <p>No. 13 then took a step forward, his momentum causing a gust of hot wind.</p>

  <p>He was headed straight for the second lamp stand...</p>

  <p>"They are going to catch up," said Feng Ge, pursing her lips anxiously.</p>

  <p>There was no way she'd want them to get close again. She had already suffered enough from the first Moon Fire Slave.</p>

  <p>"They won't be able to catch up soon," Luo Zheng said reassuringly. "Let's continue moving forward."</p>

  <p>Anyway, there was no other way to go but forward.</p>

  <p>Although the Moon Fire Slaves were able to move faster now, they still weren't as fast as the Hidden Beasts.</p>

  <p>While extinguishing four lamp stands in a row, No. 13 had still been attacked three times. Thinking of the ones he had already received when he had a huge body, he was a little worried.</p>

  <p>"Once these injuries break out, I'll have to suffer a lot..." No. 13 said anxiously. "I'll retreat and settle them outside."</p>

  <p>If No. 13 died here, No. 12 would be forced to fight in person. Of course, No.12 didn't want that to happen. Waving his hand impatiently, he said,</p>

  <p>"Hurry up."</p>

  <p>Similar to what Luo Zheng did, No. 13 retreated to the gobi outside the desert to allow the gray marks dotting his body to explode. After that, he rushed back to No. 12's side.</p>

  <p>After No. 12 and No. 13 went deep into the group of lamp stands, they soon found that the method of leaving the area for settlement did not work any more.</p>

  <p>The lights they had just extinguished were somehow lit again. They had no choice but to move forward.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had expected the Moon Fire Slaves would encounter such a problem.</p>

  <p>Not bothering to look back to check, he focused all his attention on the Hidden Beast in front of him.</p>

  <p>The Hidden Beast in front of him was a unicorn. Narrowing his eyes, Luo Zheng attempted to leap upwards, when the unicorn followed suit at incredible speed, stabbing its sharp horn into Luo Zheng's belly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng gritted his teeth but managed to reach out and put out another black flame. Staggering backwards, he checked his stomach to find more grey marks. These were probably going to cause him great suffering later on.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge watched him inspect his scars. Her heart sank. Luo Zheng had incurred several wounds already, and she was worried his body would collapse if he settled them all at the same time...</p>

  <p>"Let me deal with the next lamp," Feng Ge said firmly.</p>

  <p>Not far away, a Hidden Beast looking like a cat curled up on the ground.</p>

  <p>This Hidden Beast was obviously agile and nimble. If Luo Zheng didn't move fast enough, he'd probably incur yet another wound.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry," Luo Zheng shook his head. "I'll be fine."</p>

  <p>After saying that, he transformed into an arrow again and shot forward.</p>

  <p>Whizzing past the cat, he rushed to the lamp stand ahead.</p>

  <p>However, as Feng Ge expected, two more scratches appeared on Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>This spiritual cat didn't seem to be large, but the two scratches it left were shining with silver gray light, indicating they were serious injuries.</p>

  <p>The Hidden Beasts in the second half of the journey were much more powerful than those in the first half. This meant that the rest of the journey would prove perilous.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng hurried on to pass through three more lamp stands, each time incurring more wounds. At this point, even the Green Jade Spirit spoke, "Luo Zheng, if you get injured one more time, I'm afraid it'll be troublesome to settle the injuries..."</p>

  <p>"What can I do? We can't turn back. I can only trust my luck now," Luo Zheng answered, as he eyed the Hidden Beast before him. It was a centipede with twelve pairs of wings.</p>

  <p>"I just thought about it and found that there seemed to be something wrong with the way to settle the injuries. Back then, when the Cyan Grasshopper received a fatal attack from the Hidden Beast in the Three Purities Stage, the settlement didn't come immediately. Instead, it came after a while and the Cyan Grasshopper directly died," the Green Jade Spirit said.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was just about to rush to the lamp stand, but upon hearing the Green Jade Spirit's words, he abruptly stopped in his tracks.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng was persistent and brave, that didn't mean he wasn't afraid to die.</p>

  <p>Studying the gray scars that painted his body, he felt anxious. They were like ominous blades that hung over his head, ready to fall at any moment.</p>

  <p>"According to the situation of that Moon Fire Slave, the Cyan Grasshopper should have died on the spot, not after a while," said Luo Zheng slowly.</p>

  <p>"Yes!" The Green Jade Spirit added, "The rules of the settlement are somewhat different from what I thought."</p>

  <p>"However, the result is the same..." Luo Zheng responded faintly.</p>

  <p>Although the Moon Fire Slaves' strength was suppressed by Stage Seventeen of the Other Shore, Luo Zheng doubted he was stronger than them.</p>

  <p>"But think about it," the Green Jade Spirit pressed. "What if a person is seriously injured, and stays in this area the whole time?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes lit up. Was it the third method of settlement?</p>

  <p>"Are you saying the injuries will be settled when the time is up?" Luo Zheng asked slowly.</p>

  <p>"It's very likely." The Green Jade Spirit nodded confidently.</p>

  <p>"If so..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng whipped his head around to look at the Moon Fire Slaves in the distance.</p>

  <p>They seemed to be in a worse predicament than him.</p>

  <p>Pondering over this for a bit, Luo Zheng decided to stop moving forward. If what the Green Jade Spirit had said was true, he would have to try staying put for a while.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Luo Zheng had stopped pressing forward, No. 13 was overjoyed. This gave him renewed strength, and he proceeded to extinguish the Hidden Spirit Lamps as fast as he could.</p>

  <p>He was getting close. But suddenly, studying the gray scars on his body, he hesitated to move forward.</p>
