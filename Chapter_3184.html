  <p>
</p>

  <p>Although the cultivation bases of the guards Marco brought with him were not that high, most of them were former Oneness Guards, and in some sense, they were also the Xu Clan's family guards.</p>

  <p>They were a little relieved when they saw that Marco didn't have other wounds besides his pierced chest.</p>

  <p>If Milo really had wanted to kill Marco, he would not have gone straight for the chest. The wound was serious to be sure, but if properly treated Marco would be just fine.</p>

  <p>The guards began approaching Marco when suddenly and vigorously blood spurted out of his chest.</p>

  <p>His blood transformed into blood swords and slashed at the guards!</p>

  <p>The guards hadn't seen this coming. Many of them managed to get out of the way, but two of them were struck by the blood swords.</p>

  <p>Marco was understandably startled on seeing the blood shooting out of his chest like a fountain. It was true he was as good a warrior as Milo, but he had never faced a life-and-death situation before and had no idea how to handle it.</p>

  <p>The guards were unable to get close to Marco. But if they didn't, he would surely bleed out and die.</p>

  <p>"My friend, Young Master Marco is the son of the master of Vastness Mountain. If he dies here, I'm afraid you will have a hard time explaining this to our master," the leader of the guards said sternly.</p>

  <p>Milo didn't respond and stood stone-faced. Instead, Kate jumped in, "Your master has two hundred and thirty sons, and Marco isn't one of the good ones. Trust me, we can afford the consequences of him dying."</p>

  <p>"What?" The guard's expression turned grim. "Then we will feel no remorse for what happens next!"</p>

  <p>He wasn't sure if Flow Sword Sect really could take the consequences of Marco's death, but he knew for sure he and the other guards could not. It seemed to him the only way to prevent any trouble for himself was to stop Milo.</p>

  <p>These guards were all former three-star and four-star Oneness Guards, every one of them possessing remarkable strength.</p>

  <p>Milo probably could not take on more than ten people at once. Kate, who stood beside Milo, scoffed and drew a small sword.</p>

  <p>As she did so, they heard someone shouting from a corner.</p>

  <p>"Who the hell are you? How dare you behave like this in our sect?"</p>

  <p>"We may not be a large and powerful sect, but you're still not allowed to come around here acting so wild and like you're superior!"</p>

  <p>It was Konnor, Mekhi, and some other elite disciples of Flow Sword Sect.</p>

  <p>Hearing the commotion, they had rushed out.</p>

  <p>These elite disciples' strength varied. Konnor was as strong as a fourth-star or even five-star Oneness Guard. Although the others were slightly weaker, they were also stronger than many guards of the Xu Clan.</p>

  <p>Then the fight broke out.</p>

  <p>Before long it was clear that the guards with Marco were at a disadvantage.</p>

  <p>But the elite disciples were restraining themselves, knowing it would not be honorable to take advantage of them in their current bind.</p>

  <p>They only knocked the long swords from the guards' hands and injured them without endangering their lives.</p>

  <p>Trish looked surprised, when she came around and stood up behind Zheng.</p>

  <p>She had not expected such a fierce battle when she opened the door earlier.</p>

  <p>The guards were surrounded by elite disciples. They stood still, unable to move. Blood swords were still gushing from Marco's chest, inserting into the ground and turning to pools of blood immediately.</p>

  <p>Having lost too much blood, Marco looked as pale as a ghost and he began feeling faint and woozy.</p>

  <p>Konnor then said aloud, "Marco, you're welcome to visit our sect. If you dare provoke our sect, well, that would be too bold and you'd have to pay for it!"</p>

  <p>When they were at the Seven Mountains Meeting, Konnor had shown nothing but respect and politeness towards Marco, as if he didn't dare to offend him.</p>

  <p>However, that did not mean he was afraid of him. Marco had come here with his guards to create trouble for his fellow disciple. This could not be ignored and was unacceptable in any sword sect.</p>

  <p>Marco was unable to speak and the scarlet blood swords continued to shoot out one after the other. All the guards felt terribly distressed. It seemed this day would not end well.</p>

  <p>Konnor turned to Milo and spoke suggestively, "Milo, please show mercy,"</p>

  <p>Konnor's attitude was clear. The Flow Sword Sect was in the right here and they had won the fight. Though they may not have been afraid to kill Marco, they did not need the mess it could create.</p>

  <p>As the leading disciple in the sect, Konnor was assertive and authoritative and when he spoke, his words demanded respect.</p>

  <p>Milo flicked his fingers with a smile.</p>

  <p>The blood on the ground turned back into blood swords and hit Marco's chest with great force.</p>

  <p>Marco's body shook wildly as each sword plunged into him.</p>

  <p>The blood swords thrust in and created a large hole in his chest.</p>

  <p>Marco was still very weak, but his face started looking better as color returned to it.</p>

  <p>"Take your young master away," said Milo.</p>

  <p>The guards, as if they had been forgiven, rushed forward gratefully. Some began to prepare pills, and some employed methods to heal Marco's injuries. Only after a simple treatment did they speed away.</p>

  <p>It was not until they left that Milo said to Konnor slowly and calmly, "Flow Sword Sect has been weak over the years. It is not just due to the shortage of talents, but also because of your ways of dealing with things. If it were a tough sect like Killing Sword Sect and Unique Array Sword Sect, do you think Marco would have dared to bully them like this?"</p>

  <p>A bitter smile appeared on Konnor's face. He said, "The competition in the seven mountains of the Oneness Sky Palace has always been this way. The sect falling behind will be bullied. Our sect has been in such a position for a long time, but now with you and Zheng joining us, we too will be strong, ha ha..."</p>

  <p>The mountains and sects of the Oneness Sky Palace were always competing with each other in secret, and the status of the powerful sword sects was naturally high. With Milo joining, the status of Flow Sword Sect had gradually risen. After all, a warrior capable of Instant Enlightenment was invaluable throughout the palace.</p>

  <p>When Milo had decided to join Flow Sword Sect, Unique Array Sword Sect and Killing Sword Sect were unhappy with his decision. They even tried to ask Flow Sword Sect to give Milo to them. But, of course, Flow Sword Sect did not agree. More importantly, the choice was Milo's in the end.</p>

  <p>Now that Zheng had joined them as well and their sect ranked first twice in the Seven Mountains Meeting, there was no doubt that Flow Sword Sect would be increasingly more prosperous.</p>

  <p>Since the commotion had been settled, Zheng cupped his hands to the others and was about to return to his house.</p>

  <p>Milo jogged over to him and asked in a light tone, "Do you have a moment, Zheng?"</p>

  <p>Zheng looked curiously at him, wondering why this proud and haughty man had suddenly become so courteous.</p>

  <p>He contained his curiosity and asked, "What's the matter, Milo?"</p>

  <p>It was very difficult for Milo to ask for someone else for a favor, but he pushed through his natural instincts and managed a smile as he asked, "Can we go in and talk about it?"</p>

  <p>Zheng blinked and gestured. "Please."</p>

  <p>Milo was overjoyed. "Thank you very much, Zheng," he added.</p>

  <p>He then brought Kate into Zheng's house.</p>

  <p>Konnor, Mekhi and the others were puzzled at what they saw. They wondered why Milo, who was always aloof and arrogant, was so well-mannered and polite all of a sudden.</p>
