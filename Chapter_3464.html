<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3464 Burning The Eye Of Will </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The black meteorite pummeled into the ground with a loud crashing sound.</p>

  <p>The collision caused the solid ground to spread out like water.</p>

  <p>In the area where the black meteorite fell, there was an array, in which there were some nonhuman creatures.</p>

  <p>They had long given up on fighting for the Chaotic Source Spirits. They just wanted to stay in the array and wait for the end of the activity in the Chaotic Source World. Then they would be sent out of here.</p>

  <p>They thought they were safe since they weren't involved in the fights anymore. Yet, an undeserved catastrophe had unexpectedly hit them!</p>

  <p>The black meteorite's fall shocked and smashed the light shield of the array into pieces. In the blink of an eye, the energy had vanished all of the creatures inside.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>It wasn't long before the second meteorite fell down closely.</p>

  <p>This meteorite brushed past the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits, who had already reached her limit and exhausted ninety percent of the Chaotic Source Spirits in her body. But now all her remaining Chaotic Source Spirits were depleted, even though the meteorite just grazed the back side of her huge body.</p>

  <p>Since she had also lost the protection of the Chaotic Source Spirits, she became extremely fragile. Her feet burst instantly under the impact of the falling meteorite, and then thousands of Chaotic Source Spirits broke out from her wounds.</p>

  <p>If it had been another time, all the talents would probably scramble to grab the Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>But now, the world was going to be destroyed. Everyone had to run for their lives. Even the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits was desperately trying to escape from it. Who would care about the Chaotic Source Spirits then?</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, they couldn't escape from the world's destruction.</p>

  <p>"What should I do?" Luo Zheng whispered.</p>

  <p>"There is only one way," the Green Jade Spirit replied.</p>

  <p>"Tell me!" Luo Zheng urged.</p>

  <p>"Before the whole world is totally burnt, find where the Evil God is and kill him," the Green Jade Spirit answered.</p>

  <p>"I don't know where he is!" Naturally, Luo Zheng was as anxious as ants on a hot pan.</p>

  <p>"The world he summoned is almost perfect without any flaws. But, the Evil God himself has his own flaws," No. 9527 suddenly spoke. "Use your Sword Texture Technique and the Authentic Visual World, and give it a try."</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Luo Zheng flew up without hesitation. A ray of strong, white light shone from his right eye.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>At that moment, the two overlapping worlds materialized in his eye.</p>

  <p>Everything was crystal clear.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng circled around in the air as he repeatedly observed his surroundings.</p>

  <p>But this chaotic world didn't have any flaws.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>Driven by the Truth of Goodwill and Malice, he activated the Eye of Will to the maximum extent.</p>

  <p>In turn, the whole world became even clearer to him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's right eye could see those tiny holes and the fur of the non-human creatures on the ground as clear as day.</p>

  <p>Even then, the strangely-colored world remained flawless?</p>

  <p>'This is not the way.'</p>

  <p>While Luo Zheng felt anxious, he suddenly thought of something and said, "I can burn the Eye of Will!"</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, the power that the Other Shore Token released could be much greater than usual if it was burned.</p>

  <p>"No way!" No. 9527 stopped him.</p>

  <p>Everyone knew that the Other Shore Tokens could not be burned.</p>

  <p>Even the Crimson Golden Sand in Stage One of the Other Shore was also able to unleash a large amount of energy when burned, but doing so would violate the truth rules of chaos. If the truth attacked the person who burned the Other Shore Token, his or her entire inner world would turn into a sea of fire.</p>

  <p>Lastly, he or she would also be affected and killed.</p>

  <p>Such was the way of the unbearable law and truth!</p>

  <p>There was once a time in the divine land, when one Yellow Emperor Guard burned an Other Shore Token. As a result, he had died a miserable death.</p>

  <p>"I can't find other ways except for this!" Luo Zheng exclaimed.</p>

  <p>His gaze continued to wander around, but he still couldn't find any flaws in this world, and of course, he couldn't find the Evil God.</p>

  <p>"Burn it," the Green Jade Spirit said out of the blue.</p>

  <p>"Do you want to kill Luo Zheng?" No. 9527 shot back. "The counterattack of the truth rules is indeed very powerful, but we might be able to withstand it," the Green Jade Spirit explained calmly.</p>

  <p>"The Civilization Artifact is enough to help you resist the consequences. I can help you, Luo Zheng."</p>

  <p>Ever since Luo Zheng had carried the Green Jade Civilization, their fates had been already bound together. With the Green Jade Spirit willing to help him take such a consequence, he no longer hesitated.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>At that point, the Eye of Will and the Civilization Artifact in Luo Zheng's inner world flashed at the same time.</p>

  <p>All the creatures in his inner world felt an unusual energy fluctuation in the sky, which made them gasp in horror.</p>

  <p>The Civilization Artifact was swiftly unfolded. The thorns on it extended and bent continuously, making the artifact look like a spider that hung upside down in the sky. The Eye of Will was in its center.</p>

  <p>Once the Green Jade Spirit was ready, Luo Zheng began to burn the Eye of Will. A flame suddenly lit up on the surface of the Eye of Will.</p>

  <p>Crack...</p>

  <p>As Eye of Will burst into flames, his right eye also started to burn. His eye wouldn't be able to resist the flames, even though it was crystallized. The fires soon licked at the crystals around his eye, cracking them fast. The crisp sounds of cracking continued to spread, and crystals on half his face were cracked!</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>Through the burning Eye of Will, he could see the whole world more clearly.</p>

  <p>He could also clearly see the structure of each material at just a glance. He could tell how heavy a stone was and which direction it would roll down to, as well as whether it would crack or not in the process of rolling down.</p>

  <p>At the same time, all the information flowed to his head like seawater.</p>

  <p>If his soul wasn't strong enough, the torrent of information would have already stuffed and destroyed his Memory Flame!</p>

  <p>"I see him!"</p>

  <p>He saw a few thin white lines on the ground. Each thin line was a few hundred feet long and was connected to the others, outlining a human shape. At the intersections of the thin lines were five indistinct spots.</p>

  <p>"These spots are the flaws?"</p>

  <p>Still, Luo Zheng couldn't think of anything else under such a difficult situation.</p>

  <p>Even if the Green Jade Spirit could help him bear the price of burning the Eye of Will, Luo Zheng couldn't burn it at will as it still had its limits. Moreover, there was a time limit.</p>

  <p>Just then, Luo Zheng turned into a beam of cyan light and ruthlessly bombarded the first white spot!</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>White cracks ruptured from the white spot from the impact of his punch, then the two white lines that were connected to it also dimmed.</p>

  <p>"It worked!" his eyes lit up as he cried out.</p>

  <p>Quickly, he rushed towards another white spot again.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Evil God who hid inside the world cackled wildly. His laughter continued to echo in the world that was being destroyed. Yet, he was also surprised that Luo Zheng had actually found the world's flaws.</p>

  <p>When the Evil God came back to his senses, three black four-legged snakes appeared on the surface of the next white spot. The black snakes quickly turned into three overlapping black crystal shields, and completely covered the spot.</p>

  <p>"Smash!"</p>

  <p>Without a second thought, Luo Zheng directly bombarded those black crystal shields.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>He smashed the pile of three black crystal shields and destroyed the white spot. Then, he quickly dashed towards the next one!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't even stop for a moment. In turn, the Evil God hastily gathered energy to protect the next spot. He ended up making six black crystal shields to cover the third white spot.</p>
