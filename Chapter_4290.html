<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The collision of the Burial Land into the primitive land created a huge shockwave. Even though only a corner of the former had made contact, there was a loud noise and it attracted everyone's attention.</p>

  <p>At that very moment, Zheng himself was busy killing the Troubled Creatures and purifying the energy of the Pollution Extreme Form.</p>

  <p>Hearing Hilario's words, he realized that something was wrong and decided to find out what was going on.</p>

  <p>The best way to do that was to utilize the Illusory Vision of the Soul Extreme Form!</p>

  <p>The consciousness created by the Illusory Vision quickly spread out in all directions and he began sensing everything that it touched.</p>

  <p>Its radius was increasing at an extremely fast speed, and in a very short period of time, it would have been able to reach the end of the chaos.</p>

  <p>However, before that could happen, the consciousness encountered an obstacle. As soon as it left the primitive land, it was completely absorbed by a mysterious force and vanished without a trace.</p>

  <p>"How is that even possible?" Zheng almost shouted in shock.</p>

  <p>The consciousness had spread out in all possible directions. Even if it hit a barrier in one direction which captured and erased it, what about the consciousness in other directions?</p>

  <p>The primitive land was enormous in size now, which meant there was only one way that this could have happened. The primitive land needed to be wrapped up in something larger than itself for that consciousness to be completely absorbed.</p>

  <p>Wrapped up...</p>

  <p>Zheng's heart began thumping at the thought.</p>

  <p>He looked up at the blood red sky overhead and suddenly realized something, which darkened his face.</p>

  <p>"Father, what's wrong?" Geoffrey instantly noticed Zheng's grim expression.</p>

  <p>Not only him, but the others did so as well.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't answer the question, though. He narrowed his eyes and created an avatar that appeared at the edge of the primitive land.</p>

  <p>Whoosh...</p>

  <p>The avatar reached out and placed his palm on the inner wall of the primitive land.</p>

  <p>This wall of the primitive land was extremely thick and generally considered impenetrable. This was the consequence of absorbing countless heads in the chaos. Even Eternal Realm warriors would not be able to break through it into the chaos. But this wasn't going to hinder Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Go!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's avatar spat out.</p>

  <p>Then, with a soft, fluid movement, the avatar went straight through the wall, quickly passed through it, and was outside.</p>

  <p>Logically speaking, the avatar should have been gazing into the empty chaos now.</p>

  <p>But instead, he saw large, black mountains standing in the distance. And somehow, these mountains were upside down, with their peaks touching the ground instead of towering above.</p>

  <p>"Waah... Waah..."</p>

  <p>"Goo..."</p>

  <p>"Coo!"</p>

  <p>There were hundreds of Troubled Creatures on the black mountains.</p>

  <p>When they discovered the avatar, they immediately sensed that this was an extraordinary prey. They spread their wings and charged towards him.</p>

  <p>But even before the Troubled Creature in the front could approach him, a snow-white light had already shot into its chest. After drawing an arc in the air, the light returned back to the avatar's hand. This was a light shuttle, made up of the energy of the Purification Extreme Form.</p>

  <p>The black matter in the body of the Troubled Creature faded away. It fell on the surface of the primitive land and died instantly as a result.</p>

  <p>Outside the primitive land, Zheng's avatar couldn't use the omniscient power, which might be nothing but an annoyance at best. Dealing with these Troubled Creatures was still a piece of cake for him.</p>

  <p>The trouble was, the Troubled Creatures didn't know about fear and even after one fell, they still swarmed towards Zheng's avatar However, the light shuttle went on rushing forwards like the sickle of death. After it had drawn numerous irregular curves in the air, hundreds of bodies were lying on the ground around Zheng's avatar.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang...</p>

  <p>The corpses of the Troubled Creatures piled up beside him.</p>

  <p>However, the reason Zheng's avatar had left the primitive land was not to kill these Troubled Creatures. He wanted to investigate and find out what was going on. He also had a theory he needed to verify.</p>

  <p>After killing over a thousand Troubled Creatures in the chaos, he was planning on leaving and going to a place from where he could observe more.</p>

  <p>He stretched out a hand and clasped his thumb and index finger together.</p>

  <p>Calmly, he folded the space between him and his targeted area and in the blink of an eye, he had moved several trillions of miles. Now, he was standing at the top of the primitive land.</p>

  <p>Just as he had reached there and was beginning to look around, a voice came from behind him. "Good. Have one long look at this place... Your last look at it!"</p>

  <p>This was the voice of the Snake Spirit King!</p>

  <p>Zheng's avatar whirled around instantly, but there was nothing behind him.</p>

  <p>Before he had a chance to put up his guard, a thin tail had quietly wrapped itself around his throat and lifted him up.</p>

  <p>Swoosh...</p>

  <p>"You're in my world now, and I rule this place!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's avatar was lifted up into the air by the tail, and saw the giant head of the Snake Spirit King in front of him.</p>

  <p>Inside the primitive land, the Snake Spirit King did not stand a chance against Zheng, which was why the fight hadn't been too long. But now, the tables had turned, and it was Zheng who had barged into the Snake Spirit King's territory.</p>

  <p>The snake tail changed direction as it seized Zheng. Zheng looked around and saw black mountains and Troubled Creatures everywhere. He was finally sure that he was inside the Burial Land now. His theory was right. The primitive land had been devoured by the Burial Land and no one had noticed!</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha..."</p>

  <p>Zheng's avatar sneered as the light shuttle in his hand quickly lengthened into a blazing white light sword. With a fierce slash, he cut off the slender snake tail that was choking him and turned around. In the blink of an eye, the light sword had been shot into the Snake Spirit King's mouth.</p>

  <p>"Buzz, buzz, buzz..."</p>

  <p>The sword released countless slender white lines inside the body of the Snake Spirit King. These lines themselves were also white in color and they forcefully sliced Zheng's opponent into countless pieces. The huge snake body collapsed like a mountain that had lost its foundation and broke into pieces, falling down like confetti.</p>

  <p>The attack power of the Purification Extreme Form was not too strong, but Zheng wasn't actually facing the Snake Spirit King. Rather, what was in front of him was also an avatar, which meant that it was easy to face him.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>A brand-new snake appeared behind Zheng instantly. This time, the avatar was about the same size as Zheng himself. When the snake appeared, it wrapped itself around Zheng's body. Then it raised its head, gazed into Zheng's eyes, and asked in a malicious tone, "Can I be your opponent now?"</p>

  <p>"You? Not a chance!"</p>

  <p>The energy of the Destruction Extreme Form suddenly burst out from Zheng's body. It created six short, purple swords which circled around the snake's body and once again, Cornelius's avatar was slashed into countless pieces.</p>

  <p>Possessing energies from the various Extreme Forms, Zheng was still extremely powerful even though it was his avatar who was fighting and he was outside the primitive land.</p>

  <p>As soon as this particular avatar was dismembered, a new avatar appeared like clockwork, once again wrapping itself around Zheng's body. "It doesn't matter how many times you slice my avatar. This is a battle between two worlds. Once I devour your primitive land, then I'll see if you are as good as you think you are!"</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King laughed, and hundreds of black spirals appeared in the inner space of the Burial Land. One of them landed on the surface of the primitive land and began spinning like a crazy top.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack...</p>

  <p>The surface of the primitive land was remarkably sturdy, but when compared to the black spiral, it was as fragile as glass. It cracked rapidly, and every single thing, from the smallest grain of sand to the broadest of the mountains began falling off!</p>

  <p>The black spiral was only the size of a person, and the amount of matter it peeled off from the surface of the primitive land was pitifully small. In fact, what it did was almost negligible compared to the huge primitive land.</p>

  <p>However, there were trillions of these black spirals and each of them was spinning in various places.</p>

  <p>They had landed on the primitive land like locusts. Looking from afar, it was as if the surface of the primitive land had been covered with a layer of black gauze!</p>

  <p>The elements that formed the surface of the primitive land were quickly peeled off, separated into confetti, and then absorbed!</p>

  <p>After swallowing the primitive land in one huge gulp, the Burial Land was planning on digesting it bit by bit!</p>
