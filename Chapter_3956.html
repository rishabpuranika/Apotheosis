<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>



  <p>
</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the open space in the forest had become very quiet, and everyone's focus shifted towards the gigantic black body.</p>

  <p>"That's not the leader of the Misty River race. Who is that guy?" someone asked in a soft voice.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I haven't seen him before."</p>

  <p>"But how could this be? His aura is much stronger than Wheeler's."</p>

  <p>Hawley hadn't shown up in the Flaming Maple Forest for many years. That was why the newcomers had no idea who he was.</p>

  <p>However, when some of the long-time residents realized that it was him, they immediately knew that things were about to get extremely troublesome.</p>

  <p>"Hawley really came out?"</p>

  <p>"What condition did the Element Spirit Civilization offer to summon him?</p>

  <p>Are they that desperate?"</p>

  <p>"It's been such a long time. Things are about to get rowdy."</p>

  <p>In the Misty River race, Hawley held a revered reputation. Since he had personally come out to deal with the situation, it meant that it really was a big deal.</p>

  <p>The creatures and Eternal Realm warriors that had been staying in the Flaming Maple Forest for a long time had sharp and experienced eyes.</p>

  <p>When they saw how Zheng dealt with Norris with such ease, they discerned that he did have the qualifications to contend against Wheeler. However, Hawley was a different kind of beast. Even with the surprising strength that Zheng had displayed, they still didn't think that he had a chance against Hawley.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, they also didn't expect that Wheeler would directly turn to Hawley without even fighting Zheng.</p>

  <p>At the moment, Zheng already felt a little uncomfortable being on the receiving end of Hawley's hostile stares. He looked back with his own fierce gaze and slightly smiled. "What's the matter? Aren't you going to persuade me first?" Zheng asked indifferently.</p>

  <p>"No," Hawley answered with a sneer. "I won't do such a boring thing."</p>

  <p>His voice was so dry and hoarse, like the sound of breaking withered crisp leaves.</p>

  <p>"I like fighting," Hawley continued. "It's just a pity that I've become too powerful that no one wanted to fight me anymore. But finally, a worthy opponent came." Hawley looked at Zheng with a piercing gaze. "There's no way I'll let this opportunity pass."</p>

  <p>Hawley's entire body was pitch black. However, his eyes shone brightly, like a pair of shimmering stars in the dark sky.</p>

  <p>As the words came out of his mouth, everyone could feel his aggressive fighting spirit spreading out.</p>

  <p>Anyone who made eye contact with him would feel the rapid circulation of their blood, the acceleration of their heartbeat, and the heat coming off from their eyes. This was the natural instinct of fearing for one's own life.</p>

  <p>Even Zheng felt his heart pounding. However, for him, it was more of a thrill than fear. There was an inexplicable desire arising from his inner being.</p>

  <p>He then turned around and asked his companions, "Will you leave the Other Shore or stay here?"</p>

  <p>The most logical and safest thing to do was to leave the Other Shore. Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and the others knew that Zheng was facing a life and death kind of test in the Three Purities Stage. Obviously, it would be extremely difficult and dangerous, so they could actually leave before it was too late.</p>

  <p>However, without hesitation, the Snake Goddess answered on behalf of them, "We'll stay here with you."</p>

  <p>The others nodded in agreement, and showed no intention of backing out.</p>

  <p>They had risked their lives to fight for their current strength and status.</p>

  <p>Besides, they were all confident in Zheng's strength.</p>

  <p>"Enough talking," Hawley said in a low voice.</p>

  <p>Crash! With a light stomp of his foot, the whole open space in the forest trembled violently.</p>

  <p>As he gathered all his energy into his arms and hands, his muscles suddenly bulged.</p>

  <p>Then, the rest of his body also swelled up. The muscles on his shoulders almost enveloped his head. "Let me see your strongest physical form, human," he said.</p>

  <p>"My strongest physical form? You're already looking at it," Zheng said with a straight face.</p>

  <p>His physical body was given by the ancestry-level bloodline, and there was nothing that he could do about it.</p>

  <p>"What?" Hawley couldn't help but chuckle loudly. "If that's the case, then you've already lost!"</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, his black figure suddenly disappeared and quickly flashed in front of Zheng.</p>

  <p>As a rule, no theurgy could be used within the Flaming Maple Forest, which meant Hawley wouldn't be able to use the Grand Teleportation technique.</p>

  <p>However, his physical speed was so fast that it seemed like he teleported himself to reach in front of Zheng.</p>

  <p>"So fast!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes widened as he was caught off guard. There was no time to think so he just instinctively took a step backward.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Just a split second after, Hawley's huge fist smashed onto the ground.</p>

  <p>A moment after, everyone saw the crater that appeared on the ground.</p>

  <p>Fortunately for Zheng, he was able to dodge at the last second. If not, his bones would have been crushed by that impact.</p>

  <p>However, Hawley was just getting started. Zheng immediately saw the look on his face, saying that he might not get lucky the next time. With that, Hawley instantly disappeared again and launched several successive punches.</p>

  <p>Crash! Boom!</p>

  <p>Several holes quickly appeared on the ground and on the trunks of the trees.</p>

  <p>Zheng and Hawley seemed to transform into two dancing shadows that flew everywhere. Not everyone could track their movements with their naked eyes.</p>

  <p>Within a few minutes, the ground within the radius of a hundred miles was in chaos. It was like small meteorites and asteroids rained on it.</p>

  <p>However, the roots of the Flaming Maple Trees were all over the forest.</p>

  <p>They just absorbed Hawley's power and continued to maintain the inner stability of the forest.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>Hawley continued to shower Zheng with his massive punches, but the latter hadn't thrown a single strike yet.</p>

  <p>The two maintained a distance of several feet, and it didn't seem that they became exhausted.</p>

  <p>"I have to admit, your speed is fascinating." Hawley's eyes revealed the sincerity of his remark. "But the result is so obvious if you just keep dodging and running!"</p>

  <p>Crash! Boom!</p>

  <p>Hawley launched another barrage of powerful attacks.</p>

  <p>The truth was Zheng was still just relying on his body's instinctive reaction to evade Hawley's attacks. However, with Hawley's quick-wittedness and familiarity of the place, he eventually forced Zheng into a corner. It was too late when Zheng realized that his back was against three tall Flaming Maple Trees, and this time, it wouldn't be easy to get out of that spot.</p>

  <p>"Damn it! I was careless! There's no other way. I need to go up!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's feet sank on the ground as he exerted his strength on his lower body.</p>

  <p>He used his legs as a spring so that he could rush upwards.</p>

  <p>However, Hawley had all things calculated. When he drove Zheng into that corner, he already expected what he would try to do.</p>

  <p>The moment Zheng's feet left the ground, Hawley rushed straight and threw a massive punch on his chest.</p>

  <p>Crash!</p>

  <p>A great force exploded in Zheng's chest, shattering his bones. His entire body was smashed and embedded into the trunks of the Flaming Maple Trees behind him.</p>

  <p>"For all your arrogance before, that's the best that you could do?" Hawley stared at him with a disappointed face.</p>

  <p>"Well, it's over."</p>

  <p>"You still got to give the human some props. His body didn't even explode after taking a direct hit from Hawley!"</p>

  <p>"Hawley's just too powerful. End of discussion."</p>

  <p>With Hawley's physical strength, there was no doubt that he would stand at the peak of the Grand Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>However, he was afraid that the Element Spirit Civilization and the Nihility race would join hands to kill him. Thus, walking out of the Flaming Maple Forest was not an option for him.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and the others fell silent as they nervously stared at Zheng's current situation.</p>

  <p>There was no way that they could join a vicious battle of physical strength, so they were left with no choice but to place their hopes and trust on him.</p>

  <p>Just when Hawley turned away, Zheng's body, which was still embedded in the trunks of the trees, slightly moved. He coughed and spat a mouthful of blood. However, the blood quickly bounced from the ground and returned to his mouth.</p>

  <p>When the creatures watching saw this scene, they were shocked and confused at the same time. Soon after, Zheng seemed to have regained his consciousness.</p>

  <p>"I apologize. You haven't enjoyed yourself to the fullest yet. I should not fall down that quickly, right?" As Zheng spoke, he slammed both his arms against the Flaming Maple Trees to push himself out. Then, like a ferocious shooting star, he struck his head on Hawley.</p>

  <p>Crash!</p>

  <p>Caught off guard by Zheng's sudden attack, Hawley was hit hard.</p>

  <p>However, his head was indestructible. If it was someone weaker than him, his head might have instantly exploded into pieces.</p>

  <p>While Hawley was still in a daze, Zheng took advantage of the opportunity and launched his counterattack. With that, countless fist shadows emerged and poured on Hawley's body like torrential rain.</p>
