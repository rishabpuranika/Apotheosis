<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Yolande wasn't argumentative type. She respected the opinions of others, as long as they respected hers.</p>

  <p>Although she was the leader of the Mist Palace, she spent most of her time cultivating in silence, and did not take her position overly serious.</p>

  <p>As for the reason why Timothy had always been so aggressive and was always stirring up trouble for her, it was nothing more than a dispute over leadership of the palace…</p>

  <p>This time, however, Yolande did not remain silent. Instead she questioned them firmly, "Who is in charge here?"</p>

  <p>After all, she was the leader of the Mist Palace!</p>

  <p>The other vice leaders of the palace hadn't had any disagreement on this matter to begin with. They were all well aware of the reason for the dysfunction of the Red Cloud Ring. It was most likely because it couldn't accurately test Zheng's ability, so it had failed to work properly.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng did indeed possess the skills and power to participate in Passing the Torch. If Luo Zheng was not qualified, he would have been bounced back when he just started to pass through the Red Cloud Ring.</p>

  <p>They were all just curious as to how many lotus petals Luo Zheng had activated.</p>

  <p>As for Timothy, he was simply looking for trouble, as usual.</p>

  <p>Now that Yolande had taken a stronger stance, Timothy's eyes revealed only traces of malice, but he didn't dare to say anything else.</p>

  <p>As for those martial artists that hadn't passed the Red Cloud Ring, how could they dare to say anything in front of Yolande? It would just seem like crying over spilled milk to become disgruntled afterwards.</p>

  <p>"The selection by the Red Cloud Ring is now over. The three hundred and fifty-six martial artists who have passed the Red Cloud Ring, come with me!"</p>

  <p>As Yolande finished speaking, she turned around and flew off in a specific direction. The martial artists of the Swallow Cloud House that Javier was from looked at each other curiously and followed closely behind Yolande. The other vice leaders of the palace also led their martial artists to follow after her.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and Layla were the last to leave.</p>

  <p>The two of them were considered to be freaks within the Mist Palace.</p>

  <p>Although they were nominal warriors of the Ice Cloud House; in truth, they had strength comparable to that of the warriors of the Swallow Cloud House! Most surprisingly, both of them were Life and Death Realm warriors, and what was most difficult to believe was that Luo Zheng was only at the fifth level of the Life and Death Realm…</p>

  <p>Following after Yolande, the group left the Mist Palace and entered the space tunnel.</p>

  <p>Over the next sixty hours, the massive group of several hundred people traveled through the space tunnel with Yolande in the lead.</p>

  <p>Although their speed wasn't slow, as they traveled across the supreme world, it would usually have taken them years. Even though they were travelling via the supreme world channel, the distance that many martial artists had finished was nothing compared to the size of the supreme world.</p>

  <p>After they followed Yolande out of the space tunnel, a large city with strange spiraling towers appeared in front of them. This was not their destination; it was only a stop along the way.</p>

  <p>Although to the martial artists, this was only a stop, there were tens of millions of living creatures inhabiting the foreign city.</p>

  <p>After they landed, everyone boarded a large ship of a foreign design.</p>

  <p>Once more they entered a supreme world channel and continued on their journey.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, they didn't need to continue using their life vitality to fly as they could now travel on this large ship. Luo Zheng found a quiet place and closed his eyes to cultivate. While he was cultivating, he tried to use the memories of the great world to check on the situation of the Lower World.</p>

  <p>Although he was very far from the great world he had come from, with the fusion of his soul and the will of the great world, he could still look up memories within the great world at any time. However, he was unable to use the power transfer technique up here.</p>

  <p>After a while, he found that Amber had already ascended…</p>

  <p>When he had returned to the Sea God Continent last time, Amber had successfully gone through another Heavenly Tribulation. It was very likely that she was also driven out by the great world just like he had been.</p>

  <p>With Amber's talent, she should be able to develop well in the Demon Night, Luo Zheng thought and was greatly pleased.</p>

  <p>His attention turned to the Central Region. It seemed that while he was gone, Aura's cultivation had steadily risen, but Mu Ning was still nowhere to be found. As for Ning Yudie, she seemed to be getting a plumpness to her figure. There was a soft glow in her face that spoke of great joy and possible maternity.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng suddenly realized something and searched further into the memories with a growing excitement. Only then did he discover that Ning Yudie was pregnant with his baby!</p>

  <p>The memories of this great world had recorded everything from its birth up to this moment. It had recorded almost everything that had happened in every passing minute. Luo Zheng now traced back through time and continuously searched for the memories about Ning Yudie within recent times.</p>

  <p>Only then did he realize that a few days before he had left, Ning Yudie had already discovered that she was pregnant!</p>

  <p>"I'm going to be a father?" Luo Zheng couldn't help exclaiming aloud. He was sitting on the spot, still in a daze, but his face was immediately filled with joy! The pregnancy had not been anticipated, but was welcome all the same. It was a pity that he had only discovered this now that he had ascended to the Upper World. He had wanted to stay in the Lower World for a bit longer. However, the great world didn't allow it. Luo Zheng had been forced to ascend here, and could do nothing to stop it back then.</p>

  <p>And now that Luo Zheng had ascended, it would be impossible for him to return to the Lower World any time soon. He felt sad that Ning Yudie now had to face all of the struggles of motherhood alone…</p>

  <p>A martial artist had to constantly challenge Nature if he wanted to advance further in his cultivation. Hence, the land of warmth and tenderness with women was a tomb for a hero. Although Luo Zheng was concerned about his family in his heart, he also knew that there were some things that he couldn't change. 'You can't have your cake and eat it,</p>

  <p>' as the saying went. He couldn't have things both ways in this world.</p>

  <p>Sacrifices had to be made to advance in cultivation.</p>

  <p>After searching through the memories again, he still could not find any traces of Mu Ning. It seemed that she had truly remained on the Purple Power World the entire time, but Luo Zheng had no idea what she had been doing there.</p>

  <p>At this very moment, in the Purple Power World…</p>

  <p>There were three buildings and one tower that were very famous in the Purple Power World. The three buildings were the Purple Jade Building, the Soul Enchanting Building, and the Moon Building. And the tower was known as the Apeiron Tower, which was the most powerful among the four structures.</p>

  <p>Since the tower was called the Apeiron Tower, it clearly had something to do with Elder Apeiron. However, the tower was indeed boundless. It was thirty thousand feet wide and one million feet high, so it could be said to be more of a massive constructed mountain, than a tower. It was an awe-inspiring sight to behold.</p>

  <p>At this very moment, Mu Ning was throwing a tantrum on one of the many floors of the Apeiron Tower!</p>

  <p>"I... I don't want to cultivate anymore! Humph… humph!" Mu Ning brought down her hands. Then the countless great swords that were hovering in the air, under her power, suddenly came crashing down! The sound of metal hitting stone was a great cacophony of jangled sound.</p>

  <p>The other warriors who were caught under the sudden shower of giant swords tried to escape.</p>

  <p>"Mu Ning, you can't do that!"</p>

  <p>"Elder Apeiron said that you must train for two hours today!"</p>

  <p>"In fact you have improved a thousand times faster than any ordinary martial artist before you. If you practice just a bit more, then it will benefit you greatly…"</p>

  <p>Many of the elders came to Margaret's side and attempted to persuade her.</p>

  <p>"I won't cultivate anymore!" Mu Ning began to cry. It was a heartrending sound full of grievance.</p>

  <p>She had never, ever, practiced seriously like this since she was a child.</p>

  <p>Back when she was in the Ethereal City, her family had always let her have her way. This was also the reason why, even if she had the Purple Power Body, she remained inferior to some Illuminating Soul Realm martial artists when she was at the Internal Elixir Realm. Her foundation was too weak to support greater cultivation and advancement.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng had ascended to the Upper World, Mu Ning had wanted to meet him in the Upper World and give him a big surprise, which was why she had agreed to meet Elder Apeiron and to enter the Apeiron Tower, and take the elder as her master.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, Mu Ning had been able to endure the rigid practice, but as time passed, she couldn't bear it any more…</p>

  <p>The cultivation of martial arts required one to practice every day. And there were endless rounds. How could Mu Ning, who had been fond of playing the zither and admiring the flowers, possibly get used to this?</p>

  <p>She simply didn't have a work ethic which could support her advancement.</p>

  <p>Therefore, she had become more and more resistant to the practice sessions in the past few days, annoying the other disciples in the Apeiron Tower with her relentless wailing and moaning. She was acting like a spoiled child!</p>

  <p>Mu Ning hadn't been in the Apeiron Tower for very long. Compared to the thousands of years of time many warriors spent in training, the several months she had stayed here were really a short span of time.</p>

  <p>However, in these few months, Mu Ning had already broken various records, and her outstanding talent had made the other disciples extremely jealous of her.</p>

  <p>The main reason for her excellent performances was because of her special Purple Power Body. Ordinary martial artists' Purple Power Body was far inferior to hers, and the cultivation methods taught in the Purple Power World were almost all related to the Purple Power Body. This gave her a distinct advantage.</p>

  <p>What left everyone even more speechless was that Mu Ning wanted to give up after such a short time of practice. If she really did give up, her great talent would go to waste!</p>

  <p>Elder Aperion of course wouldn't allow that to happen. Although she had been away for a few days, she had instructed a few elders to take care of Mu Ning in her absence. She had truly treated Mu Ning as a treasure. It was no wonder that Mu Ning had attracted so many jealous gazes.</p>

  <p>"Mu Ning, on the path of martial arts, perseverance and willpower are keys for success. If you give up so easily, how can you have any achievement in the future?" an elder said, hoping to inspire her.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to have any more achievements. I have a husband, and I'm just a common girl!" Mu Ning whined sulkily.</p>

  <p>Another elder shook her head and said, "I know that your husband is not an ordinary warrior. The world of martial artists is also very cruel. Even if you are husband and wife, you have to be a match. You need to be able to keep up to him in his cultivation and journeys. And in the future, if you want to always be with your husband, you have to work hard now!"</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, Luo Zheng isn't that kind of person!" Mu Ning wailed again, and angrily refuted the elder's advice. Anyway, Mu Ning could not stand this kind of repeated practice any longer.</p>
