<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3861 Unable To Leave </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>This was the captain's style of doing things. He always completed tasks at minimum cost.</p>

  <p>The other members of the Black Ship never doubted him. Even if the Divine Farmer killed a few of them, no one even thought of killing the Divine Farmer in revenge.</p>

  <p>The Black Ship always took revenge, but they needed better timing. They believed that their captain would take care of it.</p>

  <p>"But what about Usman?" Shera asked, her hair fluttering in the wind.</p>

  <p>The mission would be completed when they were able to take Zheng away with them.</p>

  <p>But she hadn't forgotten the captain's another goal. If possible, he would summon the Evil God to swallow Usman.</p>

  <p>This way, the Evil God would become stronger and gain some authority in the Source World.</p>

  <p>"This is not the right time. We'll find another chance," said the captain.</p>

  <p>Shera nodded wordlessly and entered Edith's Invisible Ship along with the other members of the Black Ship. In a flash, the Invisible Ship had reached the sky.</p>

  <p>The captain's three black ships had trapped Mahoney, the Divine Farmer, and the Snake Goddess.</p>

  <p>Each black ship was a part of the captain's body, but they were parts that he could abandon.</p>

  <p>The remaining black ships flew into the distance alongside the Invisible Ship.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess flew among the houses in one of the black ships.</p>

  <p>The door of the cabin before her suddenly slammed shut and bumped violently into her.</p>

  <p>A red light flashed at her fingertips, turning into a sharp claw light before she unleashed it at the door.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The door instantly cracked into pieces.</p>

  <p>Blood flowed from the cracks of the door.</p>

  <p>The black ship was made of flesh!</p>

  <p>"I don't think you have completely inherited the ability of the Land of Ancient Flesh," said the Snake Goddess.</p>

  <p>The power she had used was still bloodline power. Her lethality had greatly increased after she had fused her shadow into her real body.</p>

  <p>She used the power of her shadow to open the door of the black ship.</p>

  <p>If the captain really had occupied the Land of Ancient Flesh, he would be invincible, and the shadow of Snake Goddess wouldn't be able to cause any damage to the black ship.</p>

  <p>"You are intelligent and your judgment is accurate, but I've already got Zheng.</p>

  <p>So it's goodbye."</p>

  <p>The captain's voice echoed around the cabin.</p>

  <p>A capstan in the black ship suddenly boomed. A huge square of wood smashed through several rooms and towards the Snake Goddess. It seemed to be the captain's heavy punch.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess stretched out a hand and blocked the wood. She pinched it with her slender fingers, instantly turning it into dust.</p>

  <p>"Do you really think you can leave?" she said calmly, dusting her hands.</p>

  <p>"Why can't we?" the captain asked, tendrils of frustration lacing through his voice.</p>

  <p>Fuxi and the Yellow Thearch were engaged in a fierce battle, the others barely posing any threat. The captain was relaxed because he thought that no one could stop him.</p>

  <p id="top">The Snake Goddess merely waved her arms around, causing her shadow to form innumerable energy beams that extended to different rooms. The energy beams were like densely packed ropes, and bound up the pillars and walls of the black ship.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess's body then began to spin. Under the force of the energy beams, the black ship began to creak.</p>

  <p>It was beginning to crumble from within.</p>

  <p>The power of the Snake Goddess grew to a point where the black ship shattered into pieces.</p>

  <p>The fragments of the ship rained down, along with the blood its structure contained.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess stretched out a hand, causing an energy beam to sweep towards the falling fragments of the black ship and grabbed one of the planks.</p>

  <p>The plank was colored slightly differently from the others. Its surface was golden, and it filled people with warmth as they held it.</p>

  <p>"Why can't you leave? You'll know soon," the Snake Goddess said to the golden plank.</p>

  <p>She then pinched the plank gently, crushing it and causing blood to spurt out of it.</p>

  <p>Once the plank broke, the falling fragments of the black ship burst into flames.</p>

  <p>If the Snake Goddess hadn't crushed the golden plank, the broken black ship would have recovered its original form in minutes. The black ship's power and ability to maintain its own shape came from the golden plank, which was a part of the captain's body.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the other black ships and the Invisible Ship were rapidly shuttling through the space channel.</p>

  <p>At the speed they were moving, they could cross several big provinces in a short time.</p>

  <p>The Source World was quite large. They'd be safe as long as they avoided the first round of tracking. It would not be easy to find the Black Ship.</p>

  <p>"We've passed through three provinces. Are we safe now?" Edith asked.</p>

  <p>Edith was nervous and had become more so when the captain had suddenly asked her to take everyone with her.</p>

  <p>"As we have left the Separate Amber Province, they will never be able to find us. Edith, you've done a good job this time," said Shera, smiling.</p>

  <p>"Thank you."</p>

  <p>Edith stared ahead, concentrating on controlling the Invisible Ship. They were about to pass through a large province. She had to prepare the appropriate Sanskrit word to pass through the boundary wall.</p>

  <p>They had just passed through the boundary wall when Edith's face froze.</p>

  <p>She looked at the scene before her in a daze and said, "Shera! Captain! You need to look at this!"</p>

  <p>Every member of the Black Ship turned to look, their expressions changing as one.</p>

  <p>They were now in the Separate Amber Province.</p>

  <p>Why had they come back?</p>

  <p>"That's impossible!"</p>

  <p>"We have been heading west. This is impossible! We can't return to the Separate Amber Province!"</p>

  <p>"…"</p>

  <p>The members of the Black Ship didn't know what was happening.</p>

  <p>The captain in his black cloak thought hard. It was a moment before he said, "Someone has tampered with space. Even the Invisible Ship has gotten lost. We are trapped in here."</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess had warned him, and now, they were encountering this.</p>

  <p>He knew exactly what was going on.</p>

  <p>"How can someone do this to the space across so many provinces? I mean, who can do that?" the brass man asked.</p>

  <p>He was still carrying Zheng on his shoulder, unwilling to put down such a handy weapon.</p>

  <p>"Ordinary warriors at the Eternal Realm may find it difficult to do," the captain said, his eyes serious. "But what if it is Othniel who has mastered the truth-level theurgy?"</p>

  <p>Othniel was the Chaos Ancient God standing behind the Bearing race. If the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race wanted to ensure that everything was all right, they might ask Othniel to help them.</p>

  <p>The Finale Way and the Purge Way both had Chaos Ancient Gods to support them, because there would always be a place for them to live no matter which way was completed.</p>

  <p>This was exactly the Black Ship's disadvantage.</p>

  <p>Their ultimate goal was to completely destroy the chaos and cause the Chaos Ancient Gods who had mastered the truth-level theurgies to disappear. This was why no Chaos Ancient God was willing to be their ally.</p>
