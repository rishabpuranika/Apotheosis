  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Oh, it was dangerous."</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King's voice echoed from above.</p>

  <p>The power in Orlando's blow went beyond Cornelius's expectations. It actually could've broken his guiding barrier.</p>

  <p>The guiding barrier was the ball that protected his coordinates. It was also the most useful and strongest ability of the Space Guiding Stone.</p>

  <p>At the time, Cornelius had been too stunned to make a move.</p>

  <p>Fortunately for him, the black light was able to protect his coordinates right in the nick of time. Otherwise, he'd probably be dead by now.</p>

  <p>"Cornelius! What have you done to our king?" Manuel roared furiously.</p>

  <p>"What did I do?" the Snake Spirit King echoed with an amused smile. "I simply cursed him."</p>

  <p>The curse he was talking about was by no means simple.</p>

  <p>No matter how powerful a curse was, it could only affect the current state, but his curse could directly affect the coordinates.</p>

  <p>"Remove the curse! Or else, I will kill you!" Manuel's face contorted in anger, his eyes blazing with killing intent. Baring his two fangs, he growled menacingly at the Snake Spirit King.</p>

  <p>"You? Kill me?" The Snake Spirit King chuckled dryly, evidently unimpressed.</p>

  <p>Manuel was famous back then for claiming he was only second to the four kings in power. However, there was still a big gap between his strength and the four kings'.</p>

  <p>Moreover, he was a Treacherous Being now. He had been staying in the Night View Island for so long that he wasn't able to improve his strength.</p>

  <p>"Of course!" Manuel spat.</p>

  <p>Rage began to consume him. He no longer feared the Snake Spirit King.</p>

  <p>As he stamped his foot onto the ground violently, the earth beneath him cracked under the impact. Then, he rushed towards the Snake Spirit King like a meteor.</p>

  <p>"Poor guy..." the Snake Spirit King sighed as he calmly watched the Monkey Master approach him.</p>

  <p>Before Manuel could even get close, an invisible space wall suddenly formed between him and Manuel.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Manuel crashed into the space wall with full force. Instantly, he was enveloped by the space wall, like a mollusk being squeezed by its own shell.</p>

  <p>More space walls appeared and formed a cube around Manuel, trapping him inside.</p>

  <p>The cube of space walls began to shrink rapidly.</p>

  <p>The burly and strong body of Manuel shrank and filled the space within the cube, until his body followed the shape of his prison. In the end, what was left of Manuel was a small, white cube.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, he was a Treacherous Being. If it were a corporeal body that was squeezed into the cube, it wouldn't have stood a chance and would've violently been squished to death.</p>

  <p>"Coo, coo, coo..."</p>

  <p>The cube kept on shrinking. Manuel's body, which was originally several dozen feet high, turned into a white cube that was three feet tall and wide.</p>

  <p>"What a weakling!" As the Snake Spirit King spoke, he sensed a fluctuation in the space. "You're courting death!" he called out coldly.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Then, Tearrag and the Wing King stumbled out of the space.</p>

  <p>The two of them had wanted to save Manuel in secret.</p>

  <p>They couldn't stand a chance against the ball floating in the air, but they had enough strength to break the cube that imprisoned Manuel.</p>

  <p>The Wing King had been racking his brains, trying to find the right opportunity to make a move. When he saw Tearrag suddenly disappear, he followed suit and transformed into an invisible wind that followed him.</p>

  <p>But the Snake Spirit King was powerful.</p>

  <p>With the Space Guiding Stone and the Limited Omnipotent Stone in his clutches, no one could defeat him here.</p>

  <p>Even if he had come so close to death just now, it was only because he had been too arrogant. Otherwise, no matter how powerful the Monkey Spirit King was, there was still no chance to beat him.</p>

  <p>"You two, go to hell!"</p>

  <p>Realizing he'd been found out, the Wing King gently spread his wings.</p>

  <p>However, his wings were shattered before he could even fully spread them. Before he knew it, a square space encased him. With a loud crackling noise, he became an emerald green cube.</p>

  <p>Suffering the same fate as Manuel, Tearrag was trapped.</p>

  <p>Once he'd dealt with them, the Snake Spirit King barked, "Sewell, you may go up now. The battle is over."</p>

  <p>Sewell had been waiting with a group of snake spirits. As the Snake Spirit King gave the order, he let out a hiss, and all the snake spirits immediately spread out to surround the altar.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the infinite space, the number of monsters with two feet and two pincers was dwindling.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the number of Zheng's clones floating in the void soared.</p>

  <p>Although the irregular heavy sword was still constantly creating monsters, the speed at which they were created became slower and slower, and the quality of these newly born monsters grew poorer each time. It was only a matter of time before Zheng's clones finished them off.</p>

  <p>Finally, the irregular heavy sword was exhausted.</p>

  <p>"It's over," Zheng said with a satisfied smile. "You've lost."</p>

  <p>Even if the irregular heavy sword had turned into the Death Sword, the energy it possessed still had a limit. At this point, its limit had been reached.</p>

  <p>With the support of his primitive land, Zheng was invincible. It had been a mistake for the irregular heavy sword to choose to fight him this way.</p>

  <p>When the last monster was finished off by Zheng's clones, Zheng willed the clones to flow towards him, turn into small dots of light and finally, merge into his cinnabar field.</p>

  <p>The black armor was still silently holding the Death Sword as he did this.</p>

  <p>The irregular heavy sword had emotions, which couldn't be perceived by outsiders. Only its owner could sense what it was feeling.</p>

  <p>Kincaid could clearly feel that the irregular heavy sword was in a depressed state.</p>

  <p>'This guy was too hard on my sword..."</p>

  <p>Kincaid thought almost wistfully, as he had never felt such an emotion from the irregular heavy sword before.</p>

  <p>Every time he held this sword, he could feel its fighting spirit and the strong connection between them.</p>

  <p>Even after he had become a Treacherous Being, the irregular heavy sword was still loyal to him.</p>

  <p>In the past many years, when he was unable to move, the sword still cultivated on its own.</p>

  <p>Although Kincaid was tempted to share the common hatred with the irregular heavy sword, he had hoped that ultimately, Zheng would win.</p>

  <p>When he felt the sword's depression, he felt bittersweet.</p>

  <p>However, the depression only lasted for a moment. The next thing he knew, Kincaid sensed the irregular heavy sword had made up its mind.</p>

  <p>"You... What do you want to do?" Kincaid was shocked.</p>

  <p>The Death Sword was the ultimate form of the irregular heavy sword. If it couldn't defeat its opponent at its best, then that was it.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The unfolded infinite world suddenly disappeared, and Zheng returned to the stone hall.</p>

  <p>Soon after, the black armor pointed its irregular heavy sword to Zheng, and white dots of light and a cold aura emanated from the blade.</p>

  <p>"You still want to fight?"</p>

  <p>Zheng asked with a frown.</p>

  <p>The irregular heavy sword might be powerful, but Zheng had found a way to deal with it. Did this sword have another trump card?</p>

  <p>However, to Zheng's surprise, the irregular heavy sword did not launch an attack.</p>

  <p>Instead, the white dots of light and the cold aura created a Cold Prison.</p>

  <p>Gradually, the dots of light landed on the heavy armor.</p>

  <p>Layers of white frost appeared and condensed into blocks of ice, sealing the sword and the heavy armor within.</p>

  <p>"What's happening?!"</p>

  <p>Zheng was stunned, unsure of how to react.</p>

  <p>"This sword is intelligent," the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord explained softly. "It knows that it is no match for you and can't protect Kincaid in the black armor, so it freezes itself."</p>

  <p>Even at this time, the sword still protected its owner. How loyal it was!</p>
