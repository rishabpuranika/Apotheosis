  <p>
</p>

  <p>Looking upset, the Holy Beings had worried expressions on their faces.</p>

  <p>"What should we do now?" Clark and the other Holy Beings also looked quite worried.</p>

  <p>Nicholas' gaze became a little serious all of a sudden.</p>

  <p>He raised his head to look up at the sky, and his eyes flashed a gleam as he said through his life vitality, "Murphy and I will fight this monster.</p>

  <p>The rest of you, fly upwards. Clark, Jeremiah, Zeke, listen to me!"</p>

  <p>The purple mist above them had become very thin. Most of the fine bugs had already dissipated, forming a huge opening on top of their heads.</p>

  <p>As long as they could escape from this purple mist, they would face a turning point.</p>

  <p>Nicholas was not the type who would get panicky, even in such desperate situation.</p>

  <p>He only planned to use his own abilities to the maximum, leaving its outcome to fate.</p>

  <p>"Okay!"</p>

  <p>Murphy nodded, trusting his order.</p>

  <p>"But how can we deal with such a huge monster?" Clark couldn't help asking.</p>

  <p>"These fiends can move at such a great speed because of their flexible figures. If this monster will still maintain his previous speed after he has become so huge, it's not a shame that we will all die here," Nicholas answered with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished talking, they heard the strange sound. Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Like a mountain in the air, the huge body of the fiend called 'Wrath' jumped up, pressing down towards the crowd.</p>

  <p>"Everyone, let's fly upwards!"</p>

  <p>Clark shouted, making sure everyone heard him.</p>

  <p>The consummate True Gods and Demi-holy Beings were already prepared.</p>

  <p>As advised, they all flew upwards at the same time.</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!</p>

  <p>Clark and the other Holy Beings flew a little slower, needing to stay behind of those consummate True Gods and Demi-holy Beings to assist them.</p>

  <p>Just as Nicholas suspected, after the little monster transformed to be ten thousand feet high, his speed suddenly dropped.</p>

  <p>"His speed is his only advantage." Nicholas squinted his eyes and gently raised his hand. "Such a huge transformation may result to a great disadvantage. Murphy, Attack!"</p>

  <p>Murphy nodded.</p>

  <p>Streaks of internal momentum immediately erupted from his body.</p>

  <p>It contained a very profound comprehension, belonging to the Earth Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>With a gentle stamp, Murphy connected himself to the earth.</p>

  <p>A strange scene appeared, as everyone watched in awe.</p>

  <p>The surface of the uneven ground within a radius of a thousand miles started to soften.</p>

  <p>The rocks started to melt, transforming into soft mud. The holes of different heights constantly collapsed, filling the space with mud.</p>

  <p>A huge mud pool formed on the ground, covering the same thousand mile radius.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Murphy flew up like a ghost, rushing towards the fiend called 'Wrath'.</p>

  <p>Nicholas' eyes flashed a bit. Through his life vitality, he ordered,</p>

  <p>"Jeremiah, attack from the bottom left side. Clark, there is a little monster rushing over from bottom."</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings didn't notice the movements of the other little fiends.</p>

  <p>However, they did not hesitate to fight, following Nicholas' suggestions.</p>

  <p>As Clark flew upward, he suddenly threw a punch.</p>

  <p>Condensed by flames, a fist shadow rushed downwards.</p>

  <p>A small shadow suddenly flew past below. It was one of the little fiends.</p>

  <p>In terms of strength, Clark and Nicholas were almost alike.</p>

  <p>Especially the power of this punch was extremely horrible.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The fist-shaped flames began to spread, forming a strong impact force.</p>

  <p>With a great howl, the little fiend was smashed to the ground.</p>

  <p>Since the ground below was now a soft puddle of mud, the little fiend was like a stone thrown into the water, crashing into the depth of the ground.</p>

  <p>The other fiends were probably in the same situation.</p>

  <p>When Nicholas accurately announced their positions, they ended up being beaten down by Jeremiah, Zeke and the other Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>However, one fiend became an exception.</p>

  <p>Successfully avoiding the attack of the Holy Beings, he entered the crowd through the gap.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>A consummate True God felt something moving in front of his eyes and a sharp pain came from his belly.</p>

  <p>Looking down, a big hole appeared on his body and his cinnabar field was torn apart.</p>

  <p>Apparently, the little fiend was not done yet. After smashing the cinnabar field of the consummate True God, he headed for his next goal.</p>

  <p>Everyone could only see the little fiend when he stopped. Once he moved, he would disappear in front of the naked eye.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>With a crisp sound, the head of another consummate True God was cut off. The headless corpse spurted a lot of blood before it fell down.</p>

  <p>The head had already fallen into the mouth of the little fiend.</p>

  <p>Gee!</p>

  <p>The little fiend enjoyed his 'food' for a while, and suddenly turned to stare at Tianming with his sharp eyes.</p>

  <p>Noticing that the little fiend was gazing at him, Tianming turned over and flew upward sideways.</p>

  <p>Being a consummate True God and with a high cultivation base, Tianming moved swiftly, even surpassing the speed of some Demi-holy Beings.</p>

  <p>However, compared to these little fiends, he was not fast enough.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the little fiend appeared in front of Tianming.</p>

  <p>The others were also unable to capture the movements of the little fiend, but from Tianming's reaction, they already knew Tianming was his next chosen target.</p>

  <p>They felt a bit glad to see that. There was also a hint of delight on Troy's face.</p>

  <p>The little fiend was about to bite Tianming's neck at an irresistible speed.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Tianming's eyes flashed with a faint white light and a unique aura came from his entire body.</p>

  <p>Being affected by the aura of an irresistible will, the little fiend suddenly found himself unable to bite Tianming no matter how hard he tried.</p>

  <p>"Fuck off!"</p>

  <p>Just as the little fiend got stunned, Tianming knocked at his face with one knee, making him fall down.</p>

  <p>In a blink of an eye, Tianming and the little fiend did not reveal any incredible skills to each other.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Holy Beings, the Demi-holy Beings and the consummate True Gods around them had been stunned.</p>

  <p>They initially thought that Tianming would be killed like the two consummate True Gods who died earlier. However, not only did he manage to stay alive, he was also able to dodge the attack of the little fiend and smash him.</p>

  <p>"Um?"</p>

  <p>The little fiend that Tianming had knocked down was also confused.</p>

  <p>The fiend felt extremely unhappy, being affected by that formidable will.</p>

  <p>Out of fury, he turned in the air and rushed towards Tianming again.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Tianming frowned.</p>

  <p>Unless really necessary, he wouldn't want to expose his ability to others, most especially, not in front of these Holy Beings.</p>
