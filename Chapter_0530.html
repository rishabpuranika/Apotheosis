<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 530 I Will Protect You (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Deep inside, Zheng thought that as the massive face went away, he sneered at him.</p>

  <p>When a cultivator made so incredible cultivation achievements, he would occupy an unimaginably high position. For such a cultivator, feminine charms were probably not that important.</p>

  <p>No matter how many women he wanted, he could have them anytime and all the time.</p>

  <p>Rather than attach great importance to Yan's appealing looks, he attempted to take her virginity only for the Lustful Demon Array and cultivation.</p>

  <p>Perhaps, this person had the wrong impression when he saw Zheng holding Yan in his arms. But, great men like him were quite indifferent to people like Zheng, whose existence was like that of ants.</p>

  <p>The final sneer he gave reflected disdain, contempt, indifference and disregard.</p>

  <p>It wasn't until the massive face was out of sight that Yan finally raised her head. Even she was shocked by her own reactions. It had been a long time since something terrified her. But maybe she only seemed fragile because she was with her elder brother.</p>

  <p>"Brother, what shall we do?</p>

  <p>I don't want to be captured and taken away by him!" Yan said anxiously.</p>

  <p>She looked seriously worried about the possible things that would happen to her.</p>

  <p>And her brother was helpless to make her stop thinking about it.</p>

  <p>In truth, it was even impossible for him to take Yan away from Cloud Sect. First of all, based on Zheng's current strengths, he was no match for Kenneth. Second, the person projecting the enormous face in the sky had left imprints on Yan's body. It might be impossible for them to elude this man in the case that Zheng managed to escape with his sister.</p>

  <p>"Yan, that man will do nothing to you before you reach the Internal Elixir Realm through cultivations. Now, what you have to do is wait,"</p>

  <p>Zheng said in a firm tone, as he stared at her slightly innocent face, hoping to make Yan calm down.</p>

  <p>Coldly, Zheng vowed, "Wait... we will make him wait, and then I will put him to death."</p>

  <p>"Put him to death..." Yan murmured.</p>

  <p>Generally, ordinary people would never think of resisting such a strong master, but Zheng's firm assurance made Yan think her brother would really do what he said.</p>

  <p>Could her brother make good his vow?</p>

  <p>'Perhaps, brother only said this in an attempt to console me and make me calm down, ' Yan thought.</p>

  <p>That man who projected the enormous face in the sky might be a top master in the Central Region. And it was a fact that these masters' tactics were sometimes incredible. They were even capable of destroying mountains, rivers, and streams by merely raising their heads and feet.</p>

  <p>And this was what made them the top leaders of the warriors' world.</p>

  <p>If Zheng stood before these top figures, he would seem like an ant to them.</p>

  <p>But he solemnly vowed to challenge and kill the lion. Would that be possible?</p>

  <p>Although Yan didn't believe that, she still nodded at her brother in acknowledgment with a forced smile.</p>

  <p>But Zheng had an inkling as to Yan's thoughts since his sister wasn't very good at hiding her feelings. When he noticed the skepticism, he reached out to tousle Yan's hair and asked her with a smile, "Well, what's wrong?</p>

  <p>Don't you trust me?</p>

  <p>When you were on Hell Mountain, did you ever think that I could win the All Peaks Competition?</p>

  <p>Did you believe that I could get you out of Hell Mountain?"</p>

  <p>She somehow knew her brother was teasing, so her mouth twitched.</p>

  <p>After a few moments, she winked at him and then quickly gave him an honest response, "No, I didn't believe that!"</p>

  <p>"Ahhh... so, only when things happened did you choose to believe in me.</p>

  <p>Yan, you don't trust your brother, do you?"</p>

  <p>He smiled at Yan with a raised eyebrow.</p>

  <p>While his words sounded a little plausible, they were not entirely right.</p>

  <p>Yes, Zheng had created some incredible miracles, and Yan acknowledged her brother's remarkable achievements.</p>

  <p>However, to create similar miracles again in the Central Region might be more difficult for Zheng this time.</p>

  <p>Maybe, one hundred men as mighty as Kenneth would be no match for that top master even if they fought together against him.</p>

  <p>"Yan, look at me," Zheng appealed while fixing his eyes on his sister. In a serious tone, he continued, "I swear to you with my loyalty to martial arts that everything I have said to you is true. I promise to kill that person!"</p>

  <p>"Ahhh..." Yan stammered.</p>

  <p>She covered her mouth with one hand before she could finish her statement. After several seconds, Yan went on, "Brother, you don't have to use your loyalty to martial arts to make a vow."</p>

  <p>It was inadvisable to swear so rashly and arbitrarily. If Zheng failed to keep his vow, his promise would bewitch him during his cultivation of martial arts in the future. At the same time, his strengths would not improve at all, unless he fulfilled his promise.</p>

  <p>Thus, very few warriors were willing to swear with their loyalty or dedication to martial arts.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, it was clear to Zheng that the master with that enormous face had already become a barrier to him, the one that he must clear if he ever wanted to reach the peak of martial arts. Whether Zheng swore to do that or not had no difference because he was aware that he would be able to achieve greater things in martial arts as long as he killed that man.</p>

  <p>And he made that vow only because he expected to set his little sister's mind at rest and ease her worries.</p>

  <p>"Bam! Bam! Bam!"</p>

  <p>As he descended from the sky, Kenneth clapped his hands loudly. Aura was beside him. Before this, the princess was on the hillside, but when she sighted the weird image in the sky and heard the enormous face speak, Aura naturally knew that the face appeared because of Yan. So, she rushed over by taking a flying chariot.</p>

  <p>"Well, that's great. Well done!</p>

  <p>Cloud Sect disciples are, without a doubt, heroic.</p>

  <p>Aura, you truly have an eye for choosing such an excellent disciple for Drizzle Peak!" Kenneth declared.</p>

  <p>The laughter that followed echoed everywhere.</p>
