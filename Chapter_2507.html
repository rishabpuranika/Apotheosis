  <p>
</p>

  <p>Harper showed a pleased look noticing Zheng wearing a disgruntled expression.</p>

  <p>His lips curved into a smile in a relaxed manner.</p>

  <p>"Good, very good! Hahaha!"</p>

  <p>His laughter lingered as the soul faded away.</p>

  <p>As soon as Harold and Marsh sensed the disappearance of the soul waves, they immediately looked at Zheng's training room with concern.</p>

  <p>After a while, the door of the training room creaked open revealing Zheng as he slowly walked out holding a sword on his hand.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, are you okay? What happened?" Harold asked in concern.</p>

  <p>Surprise flickered across Zheng's face as he saw two Holy Beings and Harold rushing over to him. Warmth filled him making him smile as he said, "An accident occurred during my time of cultivation."</p>

  <p>"What's this sword?"</p>

  <p>Gibson asked and stared at the long sword on Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>The soul of the Shadow Bearing Sword was thoroughly refined after it had successfully fused with Zheng.</p>

  <p>As the two strongest Holy Beings in the Sword Clan, Marsh and Gibson had sharp eyes for the well-known swords in the world.</p>

  <p>It could be said that eighty percent of the best swords in the entire divine land were from the Sword Clan.</p>

  <p>They immediately recognized the extraordinary power of the Shadow Bearing Sword at a glance.</p>

  <p>"The aura of this sword seems to be very similar to the Truth of Goodwill and Malice. It doesn't seem to belong to the divine land,"</p>

  <p>Marsh observed and stated.</p>

  <p>They were curious and didn't know where the sword came from. Because Zheng had been brought to the well by Lorena in the debate venue, they had no knowledge about this sword.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Zheng stretched his arm as the Shadow Bearing Sword was slowly lifted up.</p>

  <p>Merging with the fragments of the sword soul, he suddenly realized that his understanding of the sword had reached a new level.</p>

  <p>He felt like the sword was already like his arm and it could be regarded as a part of his body now.</p>

  <p>"This sword was given to me by the master of that soul a moment ago,"</p>

  <p>Zheng said flatly.</p>

  <p>"Is it the sword of that powerful man at the Other Shore Realm?" Marsh asked with his eyes opened wide.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Zheng answered and nodded.</p>

  <p>After merging with the sword soul, Zheng had already figured out several theurgies about the Shadow Bearing Sword. But as he was still affected by the Truth of Goodwill in the debate venue, he was not able to activate them.</p>

  <p>He was very much interested in how much power he could use from the Shadow Bearing Sword.</p>

  <p>For him to do so, he still needed to cultivate his Truth of Goodwill and Malice. He decided to do all these things after leaving the debate venue.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile in the sky above the Time Sea...</p>

  <p>A figure was seen slowly coming out from a cave located at the top of a mountain.</p>

  <p>After Murphy launched a direct attack on Mike's universe, he was punished by the Ruling Slate for his behavior in the mountain.</p>

  <p>The punishment of the Ruling Slate was still not fixed, but there were certain rules that could be followed.</p>

  <p>Some rules were to be taken seriously as they held a heavy weight of punishment. For instance, attacking the Floating Island of another wealthy clan without authorization. Someone who would violate this kind of rule, would in return easily lose their life. The Ruling Slate could directly erase that person's existence.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings were not afraid of these punishments.</p>

  <p>For Holy Beings, losing a life could still be mended. After all, the meaning of becoming a Holy Being was this.</p>

  <p>If a man killed thousands of disciples on a Floating Island after sacrificing his own life only and he could still recover his life in just a short time, it was a worthwhile deal.</p>

  <p>Having such a leeway, the Ruling Slate made other rules to deal with the Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>For Murphy's case, he was trapped in the mountain to reflect just like being sent to prison.</p>

  <p>Some of the Holy Beings broke the rules of the Ruling Slate, and were punished for a divine era or even several divine eras.</p>

  <p>There were more than one cave in the huge mountain, but hundreds of them.</p>

  <p>Besides Murphy, there were another three Holy Beings being punished, including the famous Zakaria. The famous Jian Clan had long declined.</p>

  <p>The Jian Clan's Floating Island had fallen into the Time Sea resulting the whole Jian Clan losing its glory.</p>

  <p>However, there was still hope for the Jian Clan. They only needed to wait for Zakaria to leave the huge mountain's cave. After Zakaria's release from the cave, the Jian Clan with a Holy Being could stage a comeback sooner or later.</p>

  <p>Zakaria was punished to be in prison for ten divine eras, but only half a divine era had passed. It seemed like it would be a long time before he could be released.</p>

  <p>Murphy attacking Mike's universe was an extremely serious matter.</p>

  <p>According to the ninety third rule on the Ruling Slate, Murphy needed to spend at least three divine eras in prison.</p>

  <p>Nicholas, however, was not patient enough to wait for such a long time.</p>

  <p>If Murphy was really going to be released after three divine eras, the battle in the divine land would have already come to a close.</p>

  <p>At this moment, lightning flashed and thunder rumbled in the mountain.</p>

  <p>The thick lightning looked like several dragons, writhing and spiraling madly. It exploded, spreading an aura by which even a Holy Being would be overwhelmed.</p>

  <p>In the midst of it all, a figure shot away and passed through the lightning.</p>

  <p>That man was Nicholas.</p>

  <p>On his shoulder was a huge ink brush.</p>

  <p>The ink brush was as tall as a person. It looked like a huge broom.</p>

  <p>The tip of the brush was embedded with emerald green hair. It was unknown what kind of fierce animals the emerald green hair was from as it emitted a gentle glow.</p>

  <p>Nicholas had flown to the top of the mountain.</p>

  <p>A giant slate stood on the top of the mountain. List of words were written densely on the slate.</p>

  <p>These words represented the rules of the divine land.</p>

  <p>The consequence of breaking these rules was very serious. From ancient times, there had been few people who could avoid the punishment of this slate.</p>

  <p>As the days passed by, the number of people who could avoid certain punishments had increased.</p>

  <p>An example involved the stowaways.</p>

  <p>There had been many people in the past two to three years who sneaked into the divine land from the universe.</p>

  <p>All of them had successfully avoided the punishment from the Ruling Slate.</p>

  <p>Nicholas had sent someone to make a thorough investigation, but they didn't find any trace of a stowaway.</p>

  <p>He suspected that those stowaways must come from the Evolutionary Universe, but he could do nothing about it when Harold had distracted the Jiang Clan.</p>

  <p>In the end, he just ignored them.</p>

  <p>After all, the stowaways from the universe were only a group of proving godly warriors. Would it even matter even if they became low-rank True Gods? Could they change the situation around?</p>

  <p>But even if they could, there was no time left. He had no intention of wasting time arguing with Harold. The game should be over now.</p>

  <p>"The ninety third rule..."</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>Nicholas flew up. He held the ink brush with his fingers and squinted his eyes.</p>

  <p>He patted slightly and a bag appeared on his waist.</p>

  <p>Inside the bag was a Sumeru Space. The Sumeru Space was considered to be as large as a world.</p>

  <p>There were countless divine might coins stored in this space.</p>

  <p>The divine might coins of the Dongfang Clan had been collected and stored over the years. In addition, the alliance of the wealthy clans would also give half of their own divine might coins to Nicholas.</p>

  <p>The amount of divine might coins of the Dongfang Clan was dozens of times more than that of any clan.</p>

  <p>"The rules are destined to be written by me. Now you will never be able to fight against me," he said coldly.</p>

  <p>Nicholas' eyes slowly emitted a faint light. The ink brush in his hand was already waving towards the Ruling Slate, aiming to change the ninety third rule.</p>
