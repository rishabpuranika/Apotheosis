  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had just released Itzel from the wall, and she was just catching her breath when suddenly, the Evil Bead appeared above her head.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King's voice was then heard coming from the bead. "My daughter, you've waited for so long. Finally someone is here to save you."</p>

  <p>Although the Snake Spirit King had given this Holy Item to Itzel, he had tampered with it beforehand and could take control of it any time.</p>

  <p>Itzel looked up at the Evil Bead and had mixed feelings.</p>

  <p>Snake spirits were known to be cold-blooded. It was not difficult for her to accept the fact that her father had become her enemy now. But when Itzel grew up in the Human Spirit Sect, she had remolded herself thoroughly. At this very moment, the grievance in her heart was like a volcano that was about to erupt.</p>

  <p>Kincaid reached out a hand and pressed her shoulder softly. He looked up and shook his head at the Evil Bead. "You're right. We are here. I have survived more than a thousand chaotic eras. Itzel is safe and sound today, and you will eventually face defeat at our hands."</p>

  <p>The members of the Bold Conjecture House had been cursed in the battle on the Other Shore. They now remained hidden in the passageway, but the remaining people of the Four Spirits Sects were long dead. The only way they could continue to exist was because they had all become Treacherous Beings. However, Itzel's body had been preserved.</p>

  <p>When the Snake Spirit King heard Kincaid's calm answer, there was a burst of cruelty and hatred in his heart.</p>

  <p>He had spent so much time and energy in trying to be omniscient and powerful, only to end up becoming a slave of the downgrader. And yet, Kincaid could still reunite with his daughter. Why? That was not fair!</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King felt depressed, but he sneered, "Safe and sound?</p>

  <p>Let me see how safe and sound she can be!"</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Flames suddenly burst forth from the Evil Bead hovering Itzel. The Snake Spirit King had sent it into an unstoppable combustive state!</p>

  <p>This was troubling! Even if an ordinary Other Shore Token was burnt, it would release an exceedingly large amount of energy, and the Evil Bead was not even an ordinary token.</p>

  <p>Weird noises started coming out of the Evil Bead!</p>

  <p>Then it began to swell up at a rapid pace and was shaking, as if it were going to explode.</p>

  <p>Kincaid was not afraid of the impending explosion since he was a Treacherous Being, but Itzel and Ling Shuang would most likely be killed if that happened.</p>

  <p>However, when the Evil Bead had expanded to the size of a fist, Luo Zheng quietly stretched out two fingers and pointed at it calmly. A cubical space box, which was one foot wide, appeared out of nowhere and trapped the bead inside it.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>With a muffled sound, the Evil Bead exploded in the space box and released its terrible power, but was unable to break through the space box.</p>

  <p>Very soon, all of its energy was consumed.</p>

  <p>The powers that came from the Deep Space were much stronger than those of the main world.</p>

  <p>The trouble was, Luo Zheng had resolved the terrifying power of the Evil Bead, but the counterattack that came with its burning could not be stopped. The punishment of the pillar quickly devoured Itzel's vitality like a hungry lion. Like Ziya, Itzel's body instantly rotted into nothingness, turning into ashes and scattering in the air like confetti.</p>

  <p>"Mother!"</p>

  <p>Ling Shuang shouted and was about to rush forward, but Kincaid stopped her.</p>

  <p>"No. Wait. Your mother won't die."</p>

  <p>Itzel was a creature of the fourth-grade world. The punishment of burning a Holy Item was not death, and it would only destroy her body. This meant that when her body had completely dissipated, two golden crosses began floating in the air, which were her coordinates.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>With a slight shake of the golden coordinates, Itzel came out. She had now become a Treacherous Being.</p>

  <p>It was a pity that her body had been destroyed beyond repair, but it was inevitable.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King's control of the Evil Bead allowed him to also control Itzel's life and death. Luckily, she was able to become a Treacherous Being.</p>

  <p>"I'll send you back to the Li Shan mountain," Luo Zheng told them as he gently pinched his fingers and folded the space around them.</p>

  <p>Kincaid, Ling Shuang, and Itzel felt a soft flash of light before they found themselves standing atop the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>Standing on the jadeite platform and looking at the huge world around her, Itzel couldn't hold back her shock. "Kincaid, Luo Zheng's space technique is remarkable!"</p>

  <p>Itzel was a highly knowledgeable person. And she had also merged with the bloodline power of the space quadrant.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng's use of spatial powers was far beyond her imagination. He had already reached a point where he could bend and move space at will.</p>

  <p>"There..."</p>

  <p>Kincaid was looking around and suddenly pointed at the center of the primitive land, where a giant, colorful halo was floating softly in the air.</p>

  <p>"There are all kinds of power in the Deep Space which are controlled by Luo Zheng."</p>

  <p>"?"</p>

  <p>Itzel knew very clearly just how terrifying the powers of the Deep Space were. After hearing that Luo Zheng controlled them, she was so surprised that she couldn't even speak a word.</p>

  <p>As for Luo Zheng himself, he sent the three of them into the primitive land, but did not return immediately. He folded the space once again and reached the top of the primitive land.</p>

  <p>Once again, he released the Illusory Vision of the Soul Extreme Form, quickly spreading out his consciousness across millions of miles. After his consciousness reached the Burial Land, he silently calculated a certain time in his heart before he withdrew it and returned to the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>Six days later.</p>

  <p>The sentry Evil God was swinging on a chain idly as it swayed back and forth like a hammock.</p>

  <p>His sole duty was to guard the Source World. He could easily use the Illusory Vision anytime and anywhere to guard and oversee a range of twenty thousand miles around him.</p>

  <p>The moment the Burial Land broke in, the sentry Evil God turned around like a predator that had sensed its prey. He saw a huge pyramid appear in the depths of the chaos, which was growing larger rapidly.</p>

  <p>The change in size wasn't physical. It just meant that the pyramid was approaching very fast.</p>

  <p>"Is it going to bump into the Source World?"</p>

  <p>The sentry Evil God opened his eyes wide. However, instead of shock, there was an inexplicable trace of excitement on his face. He approved of the style of the downgrader.</p>

  <p>Twenty million miles...</p>

  <p>Fifteen million miles...</p>

  <p>Ten million miles...</p>

  <p>When it reached a distance of ten million miles from the Source World, its speed suddenly decreased rapidly. It continued to spin, but its speed was falling down rapidly, and finally, it stopped five million miles away from the Source World.</p>

  <p>The sentry Evil God sneered with disdain, "Coward!"</p>

  <p>He had really hoped that the Burial Land would bump into the Source World. He would have a chance to see if the Source World could face that mess.</p>

  <p>The pyramid stayed hovering five million miles away from the Source World, neither moving forward nor retreating backwards.</p>

  <p>Both the Evil God in the Source World and Luo Zheng were confused as to why the downgrader was doing that.</p>

  <p>It was improbable that he had come all this way just to show off.</p>

  <p>However, since he was making no move, Luo Zheng and the Evil God did not do anything either. They just waited silently.</p>

  <p>It made them impatient and curious but they could only wait and watch.</p>

  <p>Ten days later, another Shade Stone descended.</p>

  <p>Previously, many Shade Stones had appeared one by one.</p>

  <p>At that time, everyone thought that this meant the end of the chaos, but all of a sudden, the stone stopped appearing. They had never expected that another Shade Stone would appear in the Source World at this time. They were beginning to get nervous now, twitching and asking here and there for whatever explanation whoever could offer.</p>

  <p>Not long after the Shade Stone had descended, the entire chaos began to shake violently.</p>

  <p>And now it hit them why the Burial Land had remained motionless.</p>

  <p>That was the shift of the last grain of sand in the hourglass of time.</p>

  <p>The downgrader had been waiting for the end.</p>

  <p>The end of the moments of chaos meant the end of the chaos itself.</p>

  <p>Every single thing in the chaos would disappear. Tradition had it that in every single chaotic era, only six creatures were chosen to be Chaos Ancient Gods. These chosen ones were the only creatures that would survive the end of this era and journey on into a new one.</p>

  <p>No one else could ever survive that. In fact, every single creature in the chaos had been born and bred to regard surviving such an end as their ultimate goal.</p>

  <p>With time, they had developed confidence that they could survive the end, but the setup had undergone a tremendous change this time around.</p>
