<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2166 Sky-High Price (Part Two) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Of course, the members of the Tie Clan were naturally all upset, but after studying it for more than ten years, they eventually gave up. They firmly believed that this thing was far from ordinary though, and took it to the Six-Burden Divine City. Here, they found a few True Gods with incredibly keen eyesight to verify the mud. Upon seeing the mud, the first words uttered by the True Gods were, "What is this? Did your Tie Clan go mad from poverty and use a piece of the mud dug out from the ground to fool us?"</p>

  <p>In a fit of anger, the Tie Clan's leader left the mud to this little girl in the Money Alley.</p>

  <p>The Tie Clan rented a stall in the Money Alley. It was run by the daughter of the Tie Clan's leader, a little girl named Linn Tie. Over the past two years, many True Gods had noticed this piece of mud; after all, it was quite unusual to find an ordinary mud for sale in Money Alley. If it was really a piece of ordinary mud, why would the stall owner bother to let it occupy a pot in the stall, they all wondered.</p>

  <p>Whenever someone asked, Linn would tell them this same story. With her numerously told story, many people became quite interested in the piece of mud. After all, there would always be people willing to spend a little money to buy an opportunity. What if this mud really was a treasure? How could they know without getting their hands on it first?</p>

  <p>However, when they heard the little Linn's price, the interested True Gods became so angered that they glared at her and cursed her loudly for being crazy. It turned out that Linn was asking for five hundred divine might coins.</p>

  <p>These True Gods were only a little interested in this piece of mud. And even if this mud had been a necessity, most True Gods wouldn't have been able to afford it. In other words, they would only be willing to pay one or two divine might coins for it.</p>

  <p>In fact, even the members of the Tie Clan stopped taking the piece of mud seriously. They all simply agreed to leave it here for Linn to sell, as long as it could eventually be sold. In all honesty, they couldn't care any less about the price of the mud. After all, what could an ordinary piece of mud be worth, anyway?</p>

  <p>This stall in the Money Alley was very important for the Tie Clan though. Linn was capable of taking on such heavy responsibility at a young age precisely because she was very smart and a born leader. And yet, she persisted in selling this piece of mud at a terribly high price and thus, the piece had been there for several years already. Up until today, no one had really cared for it or even paid any attention to it.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng asked about the piece of mud today, Linn told him the story vividly. At the same time, she smiled at him and asked, "Are you interested in buying this piece of mud?"</p>

  <p>This little girl looked to be quite a tender age, but she was very discerning. When she first saw Luo Zheng wandering around, she felt him rather unnatural. His gaze landed on the piece of mud, as if he could see its peculiarity. Shortly after, she noticed Luo Zheng looking around her stall. In her young heart, Linn laughed. This fellow was clearly very interested in this piece of mud, and yet he had to pretend not to be.</p>

  <p>She had a faint premonition that she would finally succeed in selling this piece of mud to Luo Zheng, and that, at a high price today. Unfortunately for her, Luo Zheng appeared to be nothing more than a proving godly warrior.</p>

  <p>Although he looked decent, he also looked a bit poor. She even caught herself wondering whether or not he would even have enough divine might coins to pay for it.</p>

  <p>"How much are you asking for this piece of mud?" Luo Zheng asked, casually.</p>

  <p>He obviously wasn't clear on what this little girl was thinking about, but she had seen straight through his every move.</p>

  <p>The little girl smiled and silently extended five fingers.</p>

  <p>"Five divine might coins?" Luo Zheng asked, feeling relieved. Regardless of whether or not this mud was useful, Luo Zheng had to have it. If this girl had been asking for a high price, things wouldn't have gone well.</p>

  <p>To his question, the girl shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Fifty?" Luo Zheng asked again, his heart already climbing up his throat. Fifty divine might coins was already getting a little steep. Even for a warrior born into one of the greatest clans, it would be quite difficult for them to be capable of affording it.</p>

  <p>And yet, shockingly enough, the little girl still shook her head once again, this time revealing her silver teeth as she sweetly smiled and said,</p>

  <p>"Five hundred divine might coins."</p>

  <p>"What clan does this girl belong to? Is she out of her mind?" Master Evil said in Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>Before Luo Zheng could say anything aloud, Master Evil's voice was heard cursing in his mind.</p>

  <p>In Master Evil's eyes, the piece of mud was worthless. Despite that though, Luo Zheng had a few secrets that Master Evil wasn't aware of and perhaps Luo Zheng could really see the value of the mud. Never had he imagined that this young girl would have an asking price five hundred divine might coins. Now that was not only daring, but outrageous, too.</p>

  <p>And upon hearing Linn's price, Luo Zheng couldn't help but frown in an instant.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously though, he noted a trace of slyness on the girl's fair face.</p>

  <p>He was in a dilemma now, for he couldn't figure out the value of the piece of mud but his need of it came from the consciousness of his inner world.</p>
