<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Before Zheng and Monica could say anything, Dorothy raised her exquisite eyebrows and said, "Join your team? Who do you think you are?"</p>

  <p>Harden leered at her with a lustful smile. "Master Galen is going to be promoted to an Alliance Chief soon, so once I reach the Other Shore Realm, I will take over his position and become the new Grand Flag Master. Don't you think I am qualified?"</p>

  <p>Seeing Harden's eyes sweep up and down Dorothy's body, Zheng clenched his jaw. "Let's go," he said coldly.</p>

  <p>But before they could move, Harden stepped in front of Dorothy and blocked her way. With the lecherous smile still on his face, he said hurriedly, "If I become a Grand Flag Master, I can help you become a Flag Master too. This is a chance you don't want to pass up."</p>

  <p>Dorothy's gaze grew colder when she heard his words. "Get out of my way!" she snapped.</p>

  <p>Knowing that his fellow disciples were watching him get scolded by this beauty, Harden felt humiliated. He immediately replied in a threatening voice, "Just appreciate my kindness. One can't fight in the Dragon City, but outside the Dragon City? "</p>

  <p>Before he could finish speaking, however, Dorothy suddenly raised her hand.</p>

  <p>Harden's eyes widened in surprise when a sharp sword radiance flashed in the air. He hadn't even noticed Dorothy drawing her sword.</p>

  <p>The sword radiance was fused with the Truth of Godly Way, and it flew so quickly that even Galen, who was standing behind Harden, didn't see it coming. The sword radiance grazed the left side of Harden's body.</p>

  <p>"Aaaaahhh!"</p>

  <p>The next moment, Harden's left arm fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>'How fast!' Zheng exclaimed inwardly in shock.</p>

  <p>He hadn't seen Dorothy's true strength on the Sea of Truth. Most of the time, she had relied on the Necklace of Mystic Soul hanging on her chest, so he hadn't expected that she would have cultivated her theurgy to such a high level. Her sword radiance was so sharp that even Zheng wouldn't be able to go up against her.</p>

  <p>Galen's face, on the other hand, contorted in a mixture of shock and anger.</p>

  <p>Dragon City had its own laws. Even though Galen hated Zheng to the core, he could not kill him in the Dragon City. Otherwise, he would find himself in great trouble.</p>

  <p>That was why he intended to lead Zheng into the Tower of Life and Death and end his life there.</p>

  <p>However, this girl didn't seem to respect the laws of the Dragon City and had attacked head-on.</p>

  <p>"How dare you commit violence in the Dragon City?! I have no choice but to arrest you on behalf of the city lord," Galen said as he strode forward.</p>

  <p>He knew the laws of the Dragon City, as well as how to take advantage of them. Now that this girl had attacked his man first, he had no scruples anymore.</p>

  <p>With his aura growing stronger, Galen dashed toward Dorothy.</p>

  <p>Just when he was about to catch her, Monica slightly moved forward and unsheathed her sword. "Galen Wang, if you don't want to die, stop right now," she said coldly.</p>

  <p>Galen was not on good terms with Monica, but usually, he would not go against her just like that. Now that he was about to become an Alliance Chief, he was not afraid of her anymore.</p>

  <p>"Who do you think you are?" he shouted loudly, producing a ray of light from his palm.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>His sharp blade was like the breath of a snake, and the unstable sword potential immediately forced Monica away.</p>

  <p>Dorothy was one of the best warriors among her peers. She was quite talented and only slightly weaker than Zheng. Moreover, her swordsmanship was incomparably powerful; even a cultivator like Harden, who had passed the eighth or ninth line, was no match for her.</p>

  <p>Galen had reached the Other Shore Realm a long time ago. How would she stand a chance against such a strong Other Shore Realm warrior?</p>

  <p>Although she had the Latent Theurgy to protect her body, her face turned deathly pale as she retreated in the face of Galen's attack.</p>

  <p>Just then, Zheng stepped forward, and the Ways-blending Strike burst out of him with great power.</p>

  <p>He didn't know if he would be able to beat a powerful warrior like Galen, but that did not mean that he would give up.</p>

  <p>"How dare you attack me!" Galen, on the other hand, was pleased to see Zheng make a move.</p>

  <p>The only reason he hadn't killed Zheng yet was because he couldn't go against the laws of the city.</p>

  <p>But now that Zheng was courting death, he had a reason to kill him. At least in this situation, Dragon City wouldn't punish him. After all, Zheng was the one who had attacked him first.</p>

  <p>With these words, the light in Galen's hand suddenly changed direction and charged at Zheng.</p>

  <p>"No!" Dorothy cried out.</p>

  <p>She was particularly worried since she was the one who had triggered this dispute.</p>

  <p>A cloud of regret began to gather over her head. Every time she left the Origin Mountain, she would be accompanied by strong warriors at the Other Shore Realm. Today, however, she had come alone since she hadn't expected to be in any danger in the Dragon City.</p>

  <p>The tip of Galen's sword was less than a foot away from Zheng's face when a muffled voice suddenly came from the Truth Library. "How dare you attack Dora in the Dragon City! You must be wishing for death!"</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>A sharp sword radiance that was a hundred times stronger than Galen's emitted from the Truth Library all of a sudden.</p>

  <p>Then, it zoomed forward with a crisp sound. Galen was rooted to the spot in shock.</p>

  <p>In just a split-second, the sharp edge of his sword had shattered into pieces, leaving him with a broken sword. His hand was trembling and his eyes were full of fear as he looked at the Truth Library.</p>

  <p>He already knew that the person who had spoken was the one who was responsible for guarding the Truth Library. A year ago, Galen had accompanied Ioan Liu to the third floor of the Truth Library. Even the powerful Alliance Chief had trembled when he had heard this voice.</p>

  <p>But what did this mysterious person's words mean? Did he know this girl?</p>

  <p>At this moment, the guards of the Dragon City flew over. Fisher Zuo, the head of the city guards, coldly reprimanded, "Who dares to fight in the Dragon City? Do you know the consequences?"</p>

  <p>Seeing that, Galen decisively threw away the broken sword in his hand and pointed at Dorothy. "It's her! She broke one of my disciple's arms."</p>

  <p>Fisher Zuo turned to Dorothy. "Is that true?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is," Dorothy replied proudly. "So what if I broke his arm? So what if I kill him?"</p>

  <p>"You..." Fisher Zuo said, his face darkening.</p>

  <p>He was a powerful and respected man. Even the Alliance Chiefs wouldn't dare to speak to him like this impudent girl had just done.</p>

  <p>Just when he was about to launch an attack at her, a voice from the Truth Library rang in his ears through life vitality.</p>

  <p>Then, his expression suddenly changed. He looked at Dorothy with a hint of reverence.</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do?" Dorothy asked.</p>

  <p>"Nothing... You can leave now," said Fisher Zuo respectfully.</p>

  <p>Seeing the change in Fisher Zuo's tone and expression, Dorothy glanced at the Truth Library and made a face. Then, she said to Zheng, "Let's go!"</p>

  <p>Galen, on the other hand, was confused and anxious after seeing the sudden change in Fisher Zuo's attitude. He hurriedly said, "Master Fisher, why did you let them go?"</p>

  <p>Fisher Zuo completely ignored Galen's question. It was only after Dorothy and the others were out of sight that he patted Galen's shoulder. "For the sake of Alliance Chief Ioan, I'm going to give you some advice. There are some people whom you should never provoke. If this girl asked me to kill you, I'm afraid I would have to follow her order. Take care of yourself."</p>

  <p>Then, Fisher Zuo walked away with his men. Galen stood there with a shocked expression on his face, wondering what Fisher Zuo's words meant.</p>
