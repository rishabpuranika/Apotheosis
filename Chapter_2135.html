<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The mouse proved to be so extraordinarily powerful, so how could Master Evil even resist?</p>

  <p>All he did was to watch as the mouse pounced towards him, stabbing into his stomach.</p>

  <p>The mouse was very intelligent as it seemed to understand that Master Evil had no power to resist. Thus it became even more unscrupulous. For some reason, it drilled half of its body into the body of Master Evil, greedily sucking the life vitality from Master Evil's inner world. From the outside, one could notice a slender tail hanging from his chest, emitting a small bright yellow light.</p>

  <p>Master Evil and Yorick both gave similar reactions, both with widened eyes and mouths left hanging. He trembled in horror at the sight.</p>

  <p>Not long after, with a splash of blood, a black Godly Tile was bitten out by the mouse. A loud sound wailed out as it was thrown to the ground.</p>

  <p>Since Master Evil had sealed the inner world with the Godly Tile, this prevented the mouse from devouring the creatures found in the inner world. Because of this, the mouse stripped the Godly Tile directly from Master Evil's inner world.</p>

  <p>Once the Godly Tile was removed, it extended its head into the body of Master Evil and began to frantically devour the creatures around.</p>

  <p>Zheng never would have thought that the "treasure" Master Evil tried to hide would turn out to be such a small, yet vicious beast.</p>

  <p>After this mouse emptied out Master Evil's inner world, the one next to suffer would probably be Zheng. Although Zheng had a sturdy body and the Redemption Armor to protect him, he was afraid he wouldn't be able to resist this eccentric mouse's attacks.</p>

  <p>After making his way out of the sand, he glanced over at Master Evil with pity in his eyes. Master Evil's eyes were closed shut, and his physical body was totally damaged.</p>

  <p>Zheng was not a relative nor friend of Master Evil. However, seeing him go through such a miserable death made Zheng feel sorry for him. It was so tragic.</p>

  <p>Notably, Master Evil was a True God of the divine land who had sworn an inner demon oath before. If he could give Zheng some help or advice, Zheng would be able to deal with everything easily in the divine land, avoiding great trouble.</p>

  <p>The mouse's exposed tail was still wiggling around. While it continued devouring Master Evil's cinnabar field, Zheng carefully walked towards the other side of the cave, trying not to be noticed or heard.</p>

  <p>Since he was unable to fly, it was quite difficult for him to leave the cave. However, Zheng noticed a small crevice beside a rock on the left side of the cave. It could possibly be his way out.</p>

  <p>However, when Zheng was halfway towards the exit, he all of a sudden felt a strong pressure coming from behind him. It was so forceful that it entered his consciousness.</p>

  <p>"I didn't expect that the Stone Mouse would hatch this early, devour my inner world, and cripple my entire cultivation! Hence, I have to possess your body right now. You're strong and healthy— the perfect body to occupy!" The soul quickly made its way into Zheng's consciousness.</p>

  <p>After Yorick's cinnabar field was completely ingested by the Stone Mouse, his body was also destroyed but his soul remained intact. Seeing Zheng's extraordinary abilities, he had already considered possessing Zheng's body from the very beginning. Because Zheng was just a world lord, it was easy for Yorick to make it through.</p>

  <p>Within seconds, Yorick's soul charged towards Zheng's body. This took Zheng by surprise and he jolted forward in reaction to the energy.</p>

  <p>Though Zheng's soul had improved tremendously after consuming the Emotion Closing Pill, Yorick was a mid-rank True God who was more powerful than anything. His strength was far more complex than Murphy's three disciples', making his soul a level higher than most.</p>

  <p>Right there and then, the surface of Zheng's soul was instantly suffused with miniature golden swords. Immediately, strands of formless energy surged within his consciousness and began shooting towards Yorick without hesitation.</p>

  <p>"Shoo! Shoo! Shoo..."</p>

  <p>Indeed, Yorick's soul was quite formidable. His soul was already so complex and high up that Zheng couldn't seem to understand it. Once he entered Zheng's mind, he ignored Zheng and just aimed to kill his soul. This would allow him to occupy the body quicker.</p>

  <p>However, streaks of sharp energy began to come off Zheng's soul like many small formless swords. If one owned the ordinary Gold Fighting Soul, they would have already been penetrated by the small formless swords.</p>

  <p>For some reason, there were only a few small cuts on the surface of Yorick's soul once the energy was released.</p>

  <p>Even so, Yorick's soul quivered in fright. He didn't expect Zheng's soul pressure to be so overpowering. Furthermore, the pain from his damaged soul was the most intense it had ever experienced. The face on Yorick's soul body immediately turned and twisted in pain.</p>

  <p>"You are quite silly to even think of resisting," said Yorick. "You, a mere world lord, have a soul that has reached such a notably high level. It seems that you must have come from a wealthy clan on a Floating Island.</p>

  <p>However, I will still devour your memories to replace your soul. I will complete all of your regrets in this life."</p>

  <p>Those sharp swords formed from Zheng's soul pressure were unable to cause any damage to Yorick. For some reason, Yorick withstood the soul pressure and walked forward. Suddenly, his hands formed into a pair of giant claws that stretched out to grasp Zheng's soul.</p>

  <p>"Soul Devouring Technique!"</p>

  <p>The moment the pair of giant claws reached out, they twisted and formed a circular cage that enveloped Zheng's soul.</p>

  <p>It was of common knowledge that in taking someone's body shell, one would have to destroy the soul occupying it first.</p>

  <p>But as of the moment, Yorick not only wanted to take over Zheng's physical body, but also wanted to swallow Zheng's soul and read through his memories. This way, he would be able to completely replace Zheng without anyone noticing.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng continuously released his soul pressure, trying to get out of the cage of two hands. Despite his efforts, he was unable to break through the circular cage and slowly lost hope. If Yorick replaced him, he knew that the consequences would be endless.</p>

  <p>Not only was he unable to break out of this cage, but it became more and more difficult for his soul to move. There seemed to be an invisible force suppressing his soul while at the same time, quickly going through his memories.</p>

  <p>"You... you are actually the son of Mike?"</p>

  <p>After Yorick read a portion of Zheng's memories, his soul was slightly stunned before a look of bliss spread across his face. If Zheng was really the son of Mike, then he would obtain all of Mike's wondrous inheritance. If Zheng had controlled the secrets of the Holy Being, then that would be the greatest treasure of all.</p>

  <p>If he knew earlier of Zheng's identity, he would have gone through this entire process even before the mouse hatched.</p>

  <p>However, just as Yorick was devouring Zheng's soul, Master Evil's soul soared out of his mind and entered Zheng's, too.</p>

  <p>"Yorick! I will not let you off!"</p>

  <p>Master Evil had just returned to the divine land but was harmed by Yorick to such an extent. In addition, his cinnabar field and physical body had also been destroyed by the Stone Mouse. Now that his soul managed to escape his lifeless body, he was going to seek revenge on Yorick at all costs.</p>

  <p>The soul of Master Evil was naturally powerful. As soon as it entered Zheng's mind, it went straight for Yorick's soul. Without any hesitation, the two souls fiercely collided with each other with a strong, forceful impact of energy.</p>

  <p>It was also because of Master Evil's attack that Yorick was forced to stop consuming Zheng's soul. Immediately, Zheng felt a sense of relief and seized this opportunity to break free from Yorick's claws.</p>
