<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1887 The Shield Of Power (Part Two) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Therefore, all he could do now was to unleash his power by the means of the Cross-world token. Using a technique such as this one was a complete waste, but Luo Luo Zheng was acting desperate, out of helplessness.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, it would be the same situation as he experienced before in which he lit up too many dragon scales and couldn't be capable of using them.</p>

  <p>Even Luo Luo Zheng just released the power without the help of any medium, it was actually more than enough to fight against Quentin!</p>

  <p>Gar...!</p>

  <p>At the same time that the green light claws reached the invisible shield, the intertwining power of the two incomparable attacks collided and emitted a sharp slicing noise.</p>

  <p>Formless power could be compared to flowing water. If any piece of it was sliced or cut open, the power wouldn't be wasted but instead replenished.</p>

  <p>Due to such, the cutting force coming from the sharp claws was unable to destroy the invisible shield. On the contrary, as Luo Luo Zheng continued to drive the shield forward, the sharp claws began to disappear, now being swallowed up whole.</p>

  <p>Although it felt much, much longer, this entire process took no more than two seconds.</p>

  <p>Quentin's expression quickly darkened. He watched as the tips of his sharp claws began to bend in all directions and cracks began to appear on their surface!</p>

  <p>"This... Is... Impossible!"</p>

  <p>Quentin shouted. By using the Sky Pearl, his confidence soared upward and he suddenly felt like he was invincible.</p>

  <p>Throughout several different occasions, if a warrior's strength was greatly enhanced in a short period of time, this kind of illusion would appear in their minds. For example, the warriors in the Collapsing Mountain race who passed their trials would experience a sudden increase in their overall confidence, when they just left the cultivation sacred place.</p>

  <p>When this occurred, many warriors had a tendency of overestimating their newly found strength. And, overestimating their strength often caused them to lose all sense of caution, resulting in the selection of the wrong opponent.</p>

  <p>The latter was the case with Quentin.</p>

  <p>If he had been more observant and had used an unyielding mindset, he would have chosen to retreat a little, ensure for some time and then crawl up to Luo Luo Zheng, giving him a fatal blow at the right time. And that would have been his only chance against Luo Luo Zheng, his only means in successfully killing Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Instead though, arrogance and prejudice had taken over him, making him lose his focus. His timing was off, and Quentin attacked Luo Luo Zheng at the wrong moment.</p>

  <p>Sizzle! Sizzle! Sizzle!</p>

  <p>The powerful force contained within the shield was fully released and the force contained within ultimately shattered Quentin's sharp claws into green powder, even finer than dust.</p>

  <p>And while his claws were bursting into puffs of dust, the green light that had once enveloped his body exploded like a bubble, disappearing into thin air and leaving no trace of itself behind!</p>

  <p>Through the use of the most overbearing method, Luo Luo Zheng had successfully and forcefully broken the Sky Pearl.</p>

  <p>"You can't?"</p>

  <p>Quentin muttered. That now destroyed Sky Pearl was Quentin's spirit - the Qin Clan disciples' last resort. In the past, countless Qin Clan disciples had used this very same tactic to reverse the many life-and-death battles, and had been the creators of many miracles.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had broken the Sky Pearl with ease, however, Quentin's mental support was now another issue. Quentin had been toyed with by Luo Luo Zheng before and right now, in this very moment, he felt as though all his fighter spirit had completely disappeared. Fear had replaced it and filled him instead.</p>

  <p>Throughout this entire process, this entire battle, never had he imagined that he could die. Now though, he suddenly realized that he was about to face the god of death! No one could ever understand the fear he felt in his heart!</p>

  <p>"You can't kill me!" Quentin subconsciously uttered these words to himself. "I?"</p>

  <p>Quentin opened his mouth again, with the intentions of making Luo Luo Zheng understand the stakes of which he now faced, but there was no time. Luo Luo Zheng had already crashed into him at full force.</p>

  <p>And yet, there was truly no need for Quentin to speak. Luo Luo Zheng could have guessed what he was going to say before he even opened his mouth to say it. He had come head on with such conversations countless times throughout his journey in the past. This time, he didn't even bother giving Quentin the chance.</p>

  <p>The very moment Luo Zheng's shield collided with Quentin, its formless energy had begun annihilating his body. Under ordinary circumstances, the warrior's body would be instantly obliterated by the powerful energy.</p>

  <p>Whether it was his hair, skin, bones, or organs, they would all be utterly destroyed!</p>

  <p>What happened in the next instant though was far from what Luo Luo Zheng had expected at all.</p>

  <p>All of the sudden, the brown wooden ring wrapped around Quentin's finger broke off. Simultaneously, a burst of smoke rose from the surface of Quentin's skin - a smoke that slowly enveloped his entire body. From the midst of the smoke, an intense Space Law Power was transmitted over and Quentin's entire figure disappeared in the blink of an eye, magically replaced by that of a wooden puppet!</p>

  <p>This puppet-like creation was vivid and lifelike. It look exactly like Quentin in figure and form, but Luo Luo Zheng knew better. It definitely wasn't him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng equally crushed the puppet into pieces by using his shield and the pieces too, fell to the ground. Luo Luo Zheng looked around and sneered, nose high in the air. He was done here. He returned to the platform.</p>

  <p>At the time of battle, there were many different treasures that Quentin could have used to protect his body. Just before his death, he had used such a substitute treasure! Not only could a puppet be used to replace his physical body, but it could also be used to teleport through space!</p>
