<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The ogre Saint Lord had struck a terrifyingly powerful blow but it still hadn't been able to stop the Reincarnation Plate.</p>

  <p>"If you don't stop, I'll kill this human girl right now!" the voice of the ogre Saint Lord sounded once again.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng snorted before replying coldly, "I will flatten your sacred place if you dare kill her!"</p>

  <p>Having said this, Luo Luo Zheng acted immediately and increased the speed of the Reincarnation Plate.</p>

  <p>Under Luo Zheng's control, the massive Reincarnation Plate began to gather speed. As it flew up in the air, it caused a giant tornado that quickly swept over the place.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng looked on in amazement as the speed of the Reincarnation Plate far exceeded his imagination.</p>

  <p>Flying through a supreme world usually took a long time. In order to save time, most martial artists chose to go through the supreme world channel.</p>

  <p>Their original location and the sacred place of the ogres were quite far apart. Even if the warriors of the Soul Sea Realm made a round trip between these two places, it would still take them a long, long time if they didn't go through a supreme world channel.</p>

  <p>But now that Luo Luo Zheng was being pursued by the ogre Saint Lord, in less than two hours he saw a number of black buildings with unusual styles crop up. This was one of the biggest cities of the ogre race. Luo Luo Zheng had already reached the territory of the ogres.</p>

  <p>He made the Reincarnation Plate crash downwards with an ear-splitting rumble.</p>

  <p>It plowed through the earth, dragging into existence a ditch that was hundreds of miles long and several miles wide.</p>

  <p>If one looked from the sky, it looked like a horrible scar had suddenly appeared across this large ogre city.</p>

  <p>And nobody knew how many of the ogres living in the city had died.</p>

  <p>The ogre Saint Lord's eyes flashed as he saw this scene.</p>

  <p>This guy really acted on his words!</p>

  <p>This ogre city was only a border city and the ogre Saint Lord wouldn't necessarily care if it was destroyed. But if this fellow were to continue destroying cities like this and if he reached the core area of the sacred place, it was possible that he would completely destroy all the property that the Saint Lord had accumulated over the years!</p>

  <p>A deep rumble sounded again.</p>

  <p>The Reincarnation Plate continued to wreak havoc on the city and carried devastating disasters with it wherever it went.</p>

  <p>All the ogre martial artists in the city flew up, all of them looking at this massive plate in shock and anger. These burly ogre martial artists looked like insignificant mosquitoes in front of the Reincarnation Plate. They had no idea why such a catastrophe should come to them.</p>

  <p>Some of the ogre warriors even tried to fight back. But even the ogre Saint Lord couldn't shake the Reincarnation Plate off and they were only capable of doing much less. The attacks of the Life and Death Realm and Soul Sea Realm warriors felt more like an itchy spot on the Reincarnation Plate and didn't leave the slightest trace on it.</p>

  <p>The Reincarnation Plate continued to crush the entire city. Ten circular movements later, it had destroyed almost half the city. Only then did it come to a grinding halt and start to float in the air.</p>

  <p>"How about that? Did you change your mind?" Luo Zheng's cold voice came from within the plate.</p>

  <p>The ogre Saint Lord's face hardened. To use a human girl to threaten a boy at the Soul Sea Realm had already been very embarrassing for him.</p>

  <p>The Reincarnation Plate was too important, otherwise, as a Saint Lord of a tenth grade sacred place, he wouldn't have done such a shameful thing.</p>

  <p>And right now, Luo Luo Zheng was threatening him right back.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng didn't give the ogre Saint Lord any time to think.</p>

  <p>He had strong psychological advantages over the Saint Lord but knew that if he showed any sign of fear, he would only lead Freya to her death.</p>

  <p>The massive Reincarnation Plate abruptly started moving again and began to go deeper into the ogre sacred place.</p>

  <p>Countless ogre martial artists were floating in the air above the large ogre city, more than half of which Luo Luo Zheng had destroyed. As their gazes found the Reincarnation Plate and then the tall, sturdy figure in the sky, they recognized the burly figure to be their Saint Lord.</p>

  <p>"It's our Saint Lord!"</p>

  <p>"Why didn't the Saint Lord stop the plate?"</p>

  <p>"Oh no! My home is ruined!"</p>

  <p>The ogre Saint Lord became upset as he heard the wails of the ogre martial artists below. Hatred was etched on his face but he was reluctant to let go of Luo Luo Zheng. The temptation of the Reincarnation Plate was too great, and the secrets that the plate held were more than he had just seen.</p>

  <p>So what other choice did he have than letting him go?</p>

  <p>He had this human girl who he could threaten Luo Luo Zheng with. But it seemed that his threat had had no effect on Luo Luo Zheng and had instead caused him to lose a city. There might have been a lot of fatalities had the full devastating power of the Reincarnation Plate been unleashed.</p>

  <p>This boy was also a decisive killer. If the ogre Saint Lord continued to hesitate, then this sacred place would suffer greater losses. The number of dead or injured ogre martial artists might increase tenfold, or even a hundredfold!</p>

  <p>Finally, the ogre Saint Lord gritted his teeth and took a step forward. The Space Law around him flashed as he crossed space to arrive in front of the Reincarnation Plate.</p>

  <p>"Stop!"</p>

  <p>The ogre Saint Lord blocked the path of the Reincarnation Plate. He had Freya with him.</p>

  <p>The Reincarnation Plate suddenly slowed down, finally coming to a stop only a few dozen feet from Freya.</p>

  <p>"Have you decided?" Luo Luo Zheng asked coldly. "Let Freya go, and I'll consider nothing to have happened!"</p>

  <p>Nothing to have happened?</p>

  <p>The ogre Saint Lord looked on in disbelief, sulking from within. His entire city had been destroyed and Luo Luo Zheng was talking about it like it hadn't happened at all? How could he possibly say that?</p>

  <p>But he knew that he had nothing to offer in negotiation with Luo Luo Zheng. In the end, he sighed, defeated and helpless and he finally released his hand, causing the black chain around Freya's body to dissipate.</p>

  <p>He tapped lightly on Freya's forehead with his other hand and a black beam shot out from where he had touched her. It was only at this moment that Freya finally regained consciousness.</p>

  <p>Freya had lost consciousness the moment she had activated the divine texture which could help her to leave the Endless Abyss. She was completely unaware of what had happened after that. So when she saw herself in the hands of the ogre Saint Lord, her eyes widened, confused.</p>

  <p>"Let her go!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's voice rang out.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>Freya turned to locate Luo Luo Zheng, only to see a huge dazzling golden plate in front of her. She was surprised. What exactly was this enormous plate?</p>

  <p>Why did Luo Zheng's voice come from inside it?</p>

  <p>The ogre Saint Lord gritted his teeth and loosened his grip. Freya shook her shoulders, her mind filling to the brim with a lot of questions. Why would the Saint Lord of the ogre race listen to Luo Luo Zheng?</p>

  <p>But now that she had obtained her freedom, Freya needed to get away from here as soon as possible. She pushed off the ground and broke free of the ogre Saint Lord. She then floated towards the plate.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng?" Freya shouted, the surprise not having worn off yet.</p>

  <p>"Come over here, below the plate!" Luo Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>When the Reincarnation Plate had been hidden deep underground, there had only been one entrance - the entrance that Supreme Lord Osborn had meticulously set up.</p>

  <p>However, once Luo Luo Zheng took control of the Reincarnation Plate, he sealed off the entrance. He knew through these divine textures that there were many entrances to the Reincarnation Plate, and one of them was at the very bottom.</p>

  <p>The ogre Saint Lord stood on the sidelines in silence.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng said to him rather nastily, "You, get way from here!"</p>

  <p>The ogre Saint Lord's face flashed at Luo Zheng's words. He was a dignified Saint Lord! How could he tolerate a junior shouting at him like this?</p>

  <p>"You brat-" the ogre Saint Lord gritted his teeth as he spoke.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to waste time listening to your nonsense. If you don't want your tenth grade sacred place to be destroyed, then move away!" Luo Zheng's voice sounded again from the Reincarnation Plate, his tone indicating that there was no room for argument.</p>

  <p>The ogre Saint Lord let out a long breath, but all he could do was step far away from this place.</p>

  <p>The ogre Saint Lord had originally had a plan. If this human girl were to enter the Reincarnation Plate, Luo Luo Zheng would definitely open an entrance. He could take this opportunity to travel over space and enter it.</p>

  <p>But chances of success were very slim. Moreover, this boy had a personality that told him he would definitely take revenge. If he were to fail, his tenth grade sacred place might really be destroyed.</p>

  <p>After much consideration, he chose to retreat.</p>

  <p>What he didn't know was that there was a Crown of Destiny in the Reincarnation Plate.</p>

  <p>The tremor of the heavens caused by the Crown of Destiny could only be felt by the one hundred and twenty-eight Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>This Crown of Destiny was something that could make any world lord go crazy for it. If he had known this, he would probably have gone all out, since it was a chance to carry the Heavenly Destiny!</p>
