<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2607 The Black Shadows On The High Platform </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The warriors with a Wild Body could not reach Other Shore Realm. The creatures in the Source World had been depressed for a long time, as this meant that they had no way of reaching higher levels.</p>

  <p>But at some point in that era, the Snake Goddess appeared. She then comprehended the Grand World Cultivation Method.</p>

  <p>With the help of the chaotic energy, she created her inner world and gave birth to countless creatures in her inner world. She had thus created a big world and condensed a Godly Tile. With this method, she actually managed to reach the Other Shore Realm without relying on the Wild Body, which made the entire Source World surprised and overjoyed.</p>

  <p>Since then, it was as if the people of the Source World had discovered a new continent. They continued to explore the Grand World Cultivation Method, contributing their own insights on the method and develop it.</p>

  <p>Because the Snake Goddess had created an inner world and the numerous people inhabiting it, the legend that she was the one who created humans passed down from generation to generation.</p>

  <p>Thus, the Snake Goddess was both the creator, and the greatest master of the Grand World Cultivation Method.</p>

  <p>If Luther wanted to increase the level of his cultivation quickly, Emily would be the most suitable person to guide him.</p>

  <p>A delighted smile appeared on Luther's face after he had heard Emily's words.</p>

  <p>Zelda and Luther had been carrying hatred in their hearts for many years now. Their entire family, including their parents and their closest relatives, were all slaughtered by the conservatives of the Warden race.</p>

  <p>They had fled all the way to this desolate place and hid here. The sorrow in their hearts was indescribable.</p>

  <p>Now Luther felt like he would finally get a chance for revenge.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, master," he said, preparing to kneel down before Emily.</p>

  <p>Emily raised her eyebrows. Luther immediately froze in his move. "I don't recruit disciples," she said flatly. "You can follow me and practice.</p>

  <p>I don't have too much time. You need to learn quickly!"</p>

  <p>In the eyes of the exiles, Luther had become their hope to leave this world.</p>

  <p>No matter what Luther needed, they would give him at any cost. But since he hoped to improve his cultivation, he had to rely on himself.</p>

  <p>There was little the others could do to help him.</p>

  <p>"I see," Luther said, eager to please Emily. She was his last chance.</p>

  <p>"Don't be too hopeful," said Emily with the same flat tone. "If you can't meet my requirements, I will use a secret technique to forcefully raise your cultivation. But the price is not small. It may cost you your life.</p>

  <p>Know that."</p>

  <p>A bitter smile formed on Luther's face as she said this.</p>

  <p>These exiles were not to be messed with. They had nothing left to lose and would do anything to leave the world.</p>

  <p>However, since Zelda and Luther had chosen this path themselves, they were already mentally prepared. They wouldn't hesitate to do anything, even if it meant tickling a sleeping dragon.</p>

  <p>"I will bring Zelda and Luther to the Torrent Bone Tower," Emily said to the other exiles. "Everyone knows how important this opportunity is to us. Please be on the alert. If something strange happens, please report to me immediately!"</p>

  <p>After that, Emily tapped her toes lightly on the ground.</p>

  <p>Circles of ripples, like rainbows, spread out, wrapping themselves around Luther and Zelda.</p>

  <p>Zelda also knew that she had no other choice. She waved her hand and said goodbye to Zheng. Before Zheng could react, the three of them disappeared into thin air.</p>

  <p>The other exiles also left, using their own methods to travel through the void.</p>

  <p>The people of the Iron Tribe remained, standing there with glazed eyes.</p>

  <p>An invisible Curse Chain bound every one of the exiles by their backs.</p>

  <p>Each Curse Chain extended all the way to the end of this world.</p>

  <p>As they passed through the bone towers and the vast plains of the Immemorial Wilderness, they finally gathered in an area so impenetrably dark.</p>

  <p>If Luther used his special ability to see through the solid blackness, he would have seen tens of millions of Curse Chains gathered together, as if there was a monster with infinite tentacles hidden in the darkness.</p>

  <p>Having passed through the inky darkness, the Curse Chains were firmly affixed to a number of high platforms.</p>

  <p>Occasionally, a new Curse Chain appeared on a high platform. Every time a new life was born in the wasteland, a new chain would appear to connect itself with the new creature.</p>

  <p>On one of the rusty high platforms stood two figures in flowing black robes.</p>

  <p>The black robes were long, completely covering the bodies of the two unknown men. Their faces, too, were hidden by black hoods.</p>

  <p>Any exile who saw them would immediately recognize them. They were Warden members.</p>

  <p>Throughout the years, the Warden race had travelled widely among the bone towers, and they always appeared as cloaked, mysterious figures.</p>

  <p>When others looked upon them, they saw only shadows. The exiles could see their real forms, but they were powerless to do anything to them.</p>

  <p>"What a bold move! This group of exiles is getting more and more rambunctious," said one of the cloaked figures in a hoarse, low voice.</p>

  <p>His face remained concealed, but a single strand of bright purple hair peaked out from under the hood.</p>

  <p>"They are lucky enough to have found the two traitors. But why do they all have to come out?" another one of them replied.</p>

  <p>"This must have been Emily's idea. She's very smart," the purple-haired person said matter-of-factly. "She probably predicted that she wouldn't be able to hide the two traitors much longer, so she gathered all the exiles to force us to act."</p>

  <p>"Do these prisoners really think they have great abilities? We can clean up this world if they take this too far. Raze it to the ground and none of them will survive." The other man sneered.</p>

  <p>"It's not the time yet!" said the purple-haired person sternly. "Not to mention that it's not a good thing for us to clean up the world."</p>

  <p>"Then what should we do?" asked the other figure, frustrated.</p>

  <p>"As far as I know, not all the exiles are on her side. Take the Yellow Emperor race, for example. They are against her," said the purple haired person flatly.</p>

  <p>"You want to use the Yellow Emperor race to fight against them? I know the strength of the Yellow Emperor race is not weak, but I'm afraid that they still won't be a match for the allied forces of those great races," the other man said, his voice doubtful.</p>

  <p>In terms of strength, the Yellow Emperor race was only on par with the Nine Li race, but compared to the Snake Goddess race, they still had a lot of improvement to do.</p>

  <p>Moreover, now that the Snake Goddess race had allied with more than eighty percent of the big races, the strength of the Yellow Emperor race paled in comparison. Even if they were strong, they would be overwhelmed by sheer numbers.</p>

  <p>"Yes, the Yellow Emperor race is indeed too weak on its own. But think about it...do you really think the exiles that have joined the Snake Goddess race are really as united as they seem?" the purple-haired man asked, his voice arrogant.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"If I give some of them the chance to leave this world, don't you think they would be tempted?" the man with purple hair replied casually.</p>

  <p>The Warden race were in charge of many aspects of this prison. The purple-haired man, for instance, held the power to determine who could gain freedom.</p>

  <p>Luther would have also become one of them if it hadn't been for the feud between the conservative faction and the free faction. The quarrel had stripped him not only of his family, but also of his power.</p>

  <p>"For the exiles, freedom is the greatest treasure, their ultimate goal. I believe that they will not turn away such an opportunity," the purple haired man said slyly. "This prison has been too peaceful, dull almost, for a long time. It's time to find something for these restless good-for-nothings to do..."</p>
