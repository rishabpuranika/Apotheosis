  <p>
</p>

  <p>He had been chasing after Zheng all this time. But just now, he sensed that something was wrong.</p>

  <p>Needless to say, his intuition had always been right on the mark. However, he was not entirely sure what kind of finishing move Zheng would employ.</p>

  <p>During the spatial transference, he secretly broke a finger and threw it into the void. This small action was the one that saved his life.</p>

  <p>Soon after, there was a loud buzzing sound.</p>

  <p>Just a short distance from him, the space began to ripple like water.</p>

  <p>Little by little, Zheng emerged from the ripples. He was frowning and his aura was a bit gloomy. He did not have that much time left.</p>

  <p>Seeing how pressured Zheng was, the Evil God grinned. "It will take a lot more than that for you to kill me."</p>

  <p>"All I want is for you to return into my inner world," Zheng replied in a slow and deep voice.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, the Evil God responded, "Instead of using that powerful skill on me, why don't you just use that on the downgrader? If he loses energy, then the Wall World might stop expanding."</p>

  <p>However, Zheng shook his head. "It doesn't actually need energy to proceed with the downgrading," he said gravely.</p>

  <p>Previously, he asked Clarence that very same question. The latter told him that downgrading could not be stopped no matter what. And the reason was that it was the embodiment of the rules. Therefore, it had nothing to do with energy.</p>

  <p>"So, do you still want to continue our fight?" The Evil God looked him straight in the eyes.</p>

  <p>With an impassive expression, Zheng answered, "If that's your wish, then so be it."</p>

  <p>Once again, the endless energy began to flow all around them.</p>

  <p>Both of them had the ability to cut the energy flow. Each of them was trying to throw the other into the energy hole.</p>

  <p>However, both of them were well-versed with the principle involved.</p>

  <p>Hence, they could both avoid it.</p>

  <p>Most importantly, they were aware of the threat the energy hole held. The only thing they needed to do was detach some parts of their bodies while the other person was distracted. And quietly, they would place them in every corner of the chaos.</p>

  <p>As soon as the Evil God removed the Restriction Field, both of them lost the ability to know everything. Therefore, it was very difficult for them to notice these insignificant broken body parts scattered everywhere. How could they be killed?</p>

  <p>However, this battle of wits did not last long.</p>

  <p>The Wall World had already expanded to the size of a hundred Source Worlds in just another five minutes.</p>

  <p>Fifteen minutes passed and it had grown to one tenth of the size of the entire chaos.</p>

  <p>At the twenty-five minute mark, it was already occupying one-third of the chaos.</p>

  <p>It was being downgraded at such an incredibly accelerated speed. It was way beyond the Evil God's and Zheng's expectations.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Fuxi was severely intoxicated in the fairy palace. With his cultivation base, it was actually impossible for him to get drunk. He deliberately let himself fall into this state.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess, Tianming, Kincaid, and the others were paying close attention to the chaos. The movements caused by Zheng and the Evil God's battle were far too great.</p>

  <p>Even though they were on the other end of the chaos, they could still feel the shock waves. If it weren't for the shields of the fairy palace and the black ship, the people inside would have died thousands of times.</p>

  <p>"Hey, everyone! Look! Can you see? What on earth is that over there?"</p>

  <p>Someone suddenly pointed to the west.</p>

  <p>Therefore, everyone looked towards the direction he was pointing. And there, they saw a blue arc. It was approaching at an incredible speed.</p>

  <p>The Wall World was supposed to be completely transparent. It was almost like a chunk of ice without any color. In addition to that, it would only manifest a strange shape if something was pressed onto it. When the third-grade world was downgraded into the Wall World, it would tear the space apart and crush everything. That was why everyone could see this blue arc. It was the light being released as the space was broken.</p>

  <p>"It's the Wall World. It's unbelievably fast!" The Snake Goddess couldn't keep the astonishment in her voice.</p>

  <p>Zheng had once reminded them that the world was undergoing an irreversible downgrading process. But during that time, the downgraded area was still very small. They always thought that it would take a long time before this happened. Obviously, they did not expect that its speed would be like this.</p>

  <p>"So, the moment is finally here. We have nowhere else to escape to." Fuxi was leaning against the wall. He was still very much intoxicated.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess frowned as she stretched out her hand and touched Fuxi on the arm. His drunkenness dissipated right away. Even if they couldn't do anything else to change the situation, she didn't want to hear him say something so depressing.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the blue arc was getting even closer to them. From ten million miles away, it was down to five million miles. After that, it was only a million miles away...</p>

  <p>With the current speed at which this arc moved, it would only take a blink of an eye for it to cross a million miles.</p>

  <p>"Everyone! Retreat!"</p>

  <p>At that moment, they all heard Zheng's voice echoing throughout the space.</p>

  <p>With that, the fairy palace began to move away.</p>

  <p>It flew eastward and maintained a certain distance from the blue arc.</p>

  <p>Not far from the fairy palace, the black ship did exactly the same.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven and the others also noticed the blue arc that was rapidly closing in on their location. The former captain immediately took control of the black ship and flew towards the east. However, it seemed like it was too late.</p>

  <p>Just as the Wall World was about to hit the black ship, the Evil God suddenly appeared on its deck. After that, the black ship's speed increased significantly. It was able to get away from the Wall World.</p>

  <p>"Based on the speed at which the Wall World is currently expanding, we only have about five minutes left," Zheng informed everyone.</p>

  <p>"To put it simply, we can only live for five more minutes?" Tianming couldn't help but give in to despair.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng shook his head. "No. I will take you out of the chaos to prevent you from being downgraded," he said calmly.</p>

  <p>"How much longer can we hide, Zheng?" Mike seemed eager to ask.</p>

  <p>Zheng calculated the amount of time they had. In all honesty, he said, "I'm afraid it won't be too long. I'm guessing we'll only have six to eight hours left."</p>

  <p>The Abstruse Energy World was infinitely larger than the entire chaos.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the Wall World was expanding at such a rapid pace. No matter how huge the world was, it would be devoured and downgraded within a short period of time.</p>

  <p>When the others heard this answer, their hearts tightened for a bit. Then, it was followed by a sense of peace.</p>

  <p>A while ago, they were extremely anxious about how much longer they could live. So now that they had gotten an estimate, the last bit of uneasiness had disappeared. As soon as they knew how much time they still had, they immediately accepted and made peace with it.</p>

  <p>"Master Kincaid will die much earlier," Zheng said as he looked sadly at Kincaid.</p>

  <p>After the chaos was downgraded, the Other Shore would no longer exist.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the coordinates of Kincaid on the Other Shore would also be downgraded. He would be gone forever as a Treacherous Being.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Hilario and Dorothy were much luckier. They were living people and didn't have coordinates. They only had to rely on the Descending Rings to descend from the Other Shore. Furthermore, Zheng would supply the energy for the Descending Rings.</p>

  <p>When Kincaid heard Zheng's prediction, he still looked very calm. He turned to Dorothy and tucked her hair behind her ear. "I'm sorry, dear. I'll be going first."</p>

  <p>Dorothy sobbed as she hugged Kincaid. "Father!" Her eyes were filled with tears. She couldn't believe this was the end for her father.</p>

  <p>"Oh, my dearest! Don't worry, I'll follow you right away!" Itzel's face was full of fear. Nevertheless, she was determined to do so.</p>

  <p>Kincaid merely nodded and smiled. There was no trace of sorrow on his face. He considered this as an acceptable ending for his existence.</p>

  <p>"Everyone! Let's drink!"</p>

  <p>Fuxi took out his wine pot and held it high. They were doomed one way or another. So all they could do now was to drink and celebrate the lives they led.</p>

  <p>Tianming was a person who didn't drink alcohol. But when he heard that, he suddenly stood up and walked towards Fuxi. He took the wine pot and drank a big gulp of wine. After that, he silently retreated to one side and sat down cross-legged.</p>

  <p>Hilario also walked over and drank from the wine pot.</p>

  <p>Afterward, Bromley, Mike, and the others took turns drinking the wine.</p>

  <p>Soon after, five minutes had already passed.</p>

  <p>The Wall World had already expanded all the way to the edge of the chaos. The fairy palace was also at the edge. With that, Zheng raised his hand and struck at the inner wall of the chaos.</p>

  <p>They heard a loud booming sound as he did this.</p>

  <p>Subsequently, a large hole appeared on the inner wall of the chaos. The fairy palace went straight into the hole and entered the Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>Most of the people in the fairy palace felt dazed. All they could see were countless light dots in front of them. They couldn't make out anything in their surroundings.</p>

  <p>One by one, Zheng patted them lightly to help them with the Soul Reincarnation. As a result, they were now able to perceive the Abstruse Energy World clearly in front of them.</p>
