  <p>
</p>

  <p>Joy looked at the mouse corpse closely. It looked familiar but she couldn't quite remember where she had seen it.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng had no intention to directly answer Augustus's question, but instead, he threw him a question of his own. "Gus, do you still have some puppets? The ones that can transform?"</p>

  <p>He was considering giving Master Evil a puppet he could use for the meantime.</p>

  <p>It would be impossible to cultivate with a puppet's body but the puppet made by Augustus would no doubt be powerful since he inherited his skills from Bromley.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's question stunned Augustus. "What kind of puppet do you want?</p>

  <p>Do you want to use it to become a mouse or a snake?"</p>

  <p>"I want it to become a human being!" Luo Zheng answered, his voice tinged with impatience.</p>

  <p>Instead of clarifying things, Luo Zheng's answer simply confused Augustus even more. "Are you going to use it yourself?" he asked. He had a number of puppets but it wouldn't be of much use to Luo Zheng given his current strength.</p>

  <p>"A friend, a mid-rank True God, will use it. He has lost his body and is just in his soul form right now," Luo Zheng explained.</p>

  <p>"I see. Alright, I got it," he answered.</p>

  <p>After a short while, a human-shaped puppet appeared in the middle of the hall.</p>

  <p>The puppet was about ten feet high and looked very powerful. It had eight swords in its back and was covered from its neck down to its arms with countless traps and arrays.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng quickly scanned the puppet from head to toe and sensed several strands of internal momentum emanating from it.</p>

  <p>"This is my masterpiece. It's strong enough to help defeat a top-rank True God and fast enough to run away from a consummate True God,"</p>

  <p>Augustus said, beaming with pride at his work.</p>

  <p>"It kinda looks a bit weird. Don't you have any that looks more normal?</p>

  <p>It would be better if the puppet looks as normal as Saul," Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>Saul's body looked very real, having been made by Bromley's skilled hands.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's request had Augustus rolling his eyes. He stretched out his hands and patted the puppet lightly.</p>

  <p>The puppet then began to morph. Its ten-foot-tall body shrank until it was as tall as a normal person.</p>

  <p>Its traps and arrays were also now skillfully hidden.</p>

  <p>"Is this enough?" Augustus asked. He gestured at the now normal-sized puppet. "Even its appearance can change!"</p>

  <p>True enough, the puppet's face also began to change. One minute, it looked like a young man and the next, it became a wrinkled, old man.</p>

  <p>"Master Evil, how about we use this puppet as your body for the time being?" Luo Zheng asked in his mind.</p>

  <p>Master Evil simply stared at the puppet in astonishment.</p>

  <p>After cultivating to such a level, Master Evil did not regard a physical body as anything important.</p>

  <p>The puppet could not improve his cultivation base, but it had the power to defeat a top-rank True God and escape from a consummate True God.</p>

  <p>Such strength wasn't something Master Evil could imagine. Many mid-rank True Gods could only hope to reach such a level of power.</p>

  <p>"Okay! Of course it's good!" Master Evil agreed immediately.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled and nodded to Augustus. "Not bad."</p>

  <p>He approached the puppet and was just about to move Master Evil's soul into it when Augustus stopped him.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Augustus did not answer and looked at Luo Nian who was standing not too far away from him. Right now, Luo Nian was thinking about how to control the little golden snake but noticed Augustus staring at him. He quickly put the snake into his space ring and avoided Augustus's gaze.</p>

  <p>"The value of that little golden snake is far beyond that of my puppet. I just hope you can let me study it for a bit," Augustus told Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The reason why he did whatever Luo Zheng asked was mostly because of that snake.</p>

  <p>His puppet-making and controlling skills had reached their Luo Zhengith and were almost on par with Bromley's.</p>

  <p>However, there were still some extraordinary skills within the small, golden snake. Augustus couldn't figure out what these skills were and hoped to study the snake to find out.</p>

  <p>He also knew Luo Nian's character very well.</p>

  <p>With the snake in his hands, there was no way that he was going to give it to anybody else. Thus, Augustus could only turn to Luo Zheng for help.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng turned to look at Luo Nian, but before he could even speak, Luo Nian was already on the defensive. "I'm not going to give it to you."</p>

  <p>"Luo Nian, since you're under the protection of the uncles and aunts in the Immortal Mansion, that little snake is useless to you right now. Why don't you lend it to Gus for a while?" Yudie, his mother, said to him in a soft voice.</p>

  <p>This boy had been thoroughly spoiled by both Yudie and Imogen, but perhaps he could be persuaded by Yudie.</p>

  <p>It wasn't easy. It took quite a bit of convincing for Luo Nian to finally relent and throw the golden snake to Augustus.</p>

  <p>Satisfied with having obtained a precious treasure, Augustus patted the puppet beside him with a smile. "This puppet is yours, Luo Zheng. May I ask though? Who are you going to help make a body?"</p>

  <p>"You know him," Luo Zheng said with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>"I know him?" Augustus thought for a while but couldn't come up with anyone.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng didn't speak anymore. He approached the puppet and released Master Evil's soul from his mind.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Master Evil's soul took on the form of a faint ray of gray light that instantly injected itself into the puppet.</p>

  <p>Soon after, the puppet's face changed. The bridge of its nose rose and became aquiline. It grew grey hair and possessed sharp eyes? it looked very much like a ferocious old man.</p>

  <p>Augustus pointed at the puppet in astonishment. "You! You are... Master Evil?"</p>

  <p>"Augustus from the Gu Clan..."</p>

  <p>Master Evil acknowledged. He and Wayne suffered a lot in the prison due to Augustus's torture methods at the time.</p>

  <p>Despite knowing that Augustus wouldn't do anything to him now, he still couldn't help but throw a cold look at the man.</p>

  <p>"You have just been released by Luo Zheng, right? Why was your physical body destroyed?" Augustus asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"Well, this matter has something to do with the Stone Mouse," Master Evil said, staring at the Stone Mouse's corpse on the ground.</p>

  <p>"Stone Mouse? You mean this mouse?!"</p>

  <p>Joy exclaimed in shock. She was still trying to figure out the mouse corpse's origin when she heard what Master Evil said.</p>

  <p>She finally got an idea when she heard the name Master Evil used to call the mouse.</p>

  <p>Even Augustus was shocked and his gaze wandered onto the dead mouse.</p>

  <p>"Joy, have you heard of the story of the Stone Mouse?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Joy nodded. "It's a one-of-a-kind true spirit, very famous. I have heard of it. In the past, Gregorio Yue of the Yue Clan became a Holy Being with the help of this Stone Mouse. It is said that this mouse keeps the secret of reincarnation of the entire divine land."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyebrows rose. "The secret of the reincarnation?"</p>

  <p>Back in the universe, he heard of something related to reincarnation.</p>

  <p>Some living beings were able to experience rebirth and carry the memories of their previous lives.</p>

  <p>However, none of these legends had ever been confirmed.</p>

  <p>"The Stone Mouse was very famous in the past. It kept Holy Gregorio company all the time and was said to be even more powerful than a Holy Being. The Yue Clan was also very powerful since it was the only great clan that was qualified to compete with Nicholas," Joy told them.</p>
