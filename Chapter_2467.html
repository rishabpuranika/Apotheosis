<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Deep in the skeleton's heart, he knew that he would eventually be destroyed with the destruction of this world.</p>

  <p>He had been prepared for it ever since he had left the Source World.</p>

  <p>His inheritance would disappear subsequently.</p>

  <p>This ship carried both hope and destruction.</p>

  <p>What he was pursuing was now meaningless.</p>

  <p>He watched them struggle and fight in vain, striving for every opportunity.</p>

  <p>In this way, a one in a trillion chance could be turned into two in a trillion.</p>

  <p>He had once thought it ridiculous. Sure, the probability was doubled, but two in a trillion was still smaller than a grain of sand on the seashore.</p>

  <p>However, with these minuscule chances, they had made it to the debate venue.</p>

  <p>The skeleton finally understood what the long-haired woman had said; even a one in a trillion chance could mean a lot.</p>

  <p>They had transformed that one in a trillion chance into one in a hundred thousand.</p>

  <p>Because of that, a faint hope blossomed in his dead grey heart.</p>

  <p>After Reinhard carved his name at a height of eight hundred feet, the other True Gods also gave it a try.</p>

  <p>"Six hundred and sixty feet!"</p>

  <p>"Five hundred and twenty feet..."</p>

  <p>"Five hundred and seventy feet..."</p>

  <p>It could be seen from this that the strength of the True Gods of the Floating Islands was higher than that of the grassroots True Gods.</p>

  <p>Most of the True Gods of the Floating Islands could break through a height of six hundred feet, while the grassroots True Gods, with the exception of a few, reached only a height of five hundred feet.</p>

  <p>Occasionally, some of them could break through the height of six hundred feet.</p>

  <p>Although the vast majority of people could not reach the terrific height of eight hundred feet, their hopes weren't extinguished.</p>

  <p>And Wesley also tried it a second time.</p>

  <p>This time, he used all his strength, but he only got ten feet higher— seven hundred and thirty feet. That was his real limit.</p>

  <p>And as soon as he reached that height, he fell down, not having the strength to even carve his name.</p>

  <p>"Brother, it's my turn," Yan said to Zheng with a smile.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded. Yan stepped off the ground lightly and rose up at a steady speed.</p>

  <p>Most of the True Gods kicked off the ground with maximum force and shot upward at the beginning so that they could break the obstruction of four hundred feet to the highest extent.</p>

  <p>But Yan didn't plan to follow them. Instead, she floated slowly like a butterfly.</p>

  <p>When she reached a height of four hundred feet, her body twisted slightly to the side, as if she was dodging the invisible barrier.</p>

  <p>The True Gods below had no idea how she managed to avoid that barrier.</p>

  <p>After crossing four hundred feet, she glanced up and gently said a word.</p>

  <p>"Speed."</p>

  <p>After she activated the Truth of Holy Words, her speed suddenly soared.</p>

  <p>She was rising extremely fast now.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Without any hesitation, she advanced upward at top speed.</p>

  <p>Reinhard watched Yan with an unreadable expression on his face.</p>

  <p>Although his mission was to protect Yan, he was also competing with her right now.</p>

  <p>Deep inside, he didn't want Yan to surpass him.</p>

  <p>But considering the overall situation, Reinhard hoped that Yan could climb as high as possible.</p>

  <p>After all, some of the prominent True Gods from the wealthy clans on the Floating Islands, such as Duke and Tyrone, had not tried their hand yet. If Reinhard was surpassed by these people, he would be very upset.</p>

  <p>But Reinhard could never have imagined the result...</p>

  <p>After reaching seven hundred feet, although her speed had dropped a little, Yan was still unstoppable.</p>

  <p>"She moves up so easily!"</p>

  <p>"She will break through eight hundred feet, right?"</p>

  <p>"Alas! We've all come here in vain..."</p>

  <p>The True Gods who had already carved their names didn't care. After all, Reinhard had made an insurmountable record before Yan had risen up.</p>

  <p>But there were still some True Gods who hadn't taken part yet. If Yan were to reach a terrifying height, they might have no need to try.</p>

  <p>By now, Yan's figure had effortlessly risen to a height of eight hundred feet.</p>

  <p>But after passing eight hundred feet, she seemed to face a stronger pressure.</p>

  <p>Everyone clearly saw her swaying around like a leaf caught in the violent wind.</p>

  <p>However, her pretty face was full of determination.</p>

  <p>'I am going to reach the highest point.' This was the only thought in Yan's mind.</p>

  <p>Eight hundred and ten feet...</p>

  <p>Eight hundred and twenty feet...</p>

  <p>Although she was shaking, she reached the height of eight hundred and eighty feet before floating there without rising or falling.</p>

  <p>"She stopped?"</p>

  <p>"How could she be able to stop and float there?"</p>

  <p>After reaching a certain height, many of the True Gods hadn't even had the strength to carve their names.</p>

  <p>However, Yan was able to hover in the air and she still seemed to have strength left.</p>

  <p>This scene was simply unbelievable in the eyes of the True Gods.</p>

  <p>"Is she really that powerful?"</p>

  <p>"Unbelievable..."</p>

  <p>"But I think she is in great pain too."</p>

  <p>Zheng looked at his sister, his eyes filled with concern.</p>

  <p>Although he did not want Yan to push herself too hard, he knew that she hoped to prove herself with this. It could be considered her obsessiveness.</p>

  <p>"Well done! Harold, it seems that she can reach the height of nine hundred feet," Gibson Sword said with a smile as he stared at Yan.</p>

  <p>After watching Reinhard reach the height of eight hundred feet, as the Holy Beings of the Sword Clan, Marsh and Gibson had both been relieved.</p>

  <p>If Reinhard got the inheritance of the skeleton, it would be a great fortune for the Sword Clan.</p>

  <p>And since then, no one had been able to surpass Reinhard. The two Holy Beings had been a little proud in front of Harold.</p>

  <p>But as soon as Yan had started to try, she had left Reinhard's name far behind without any suspense.</p>

  <p>Gibson admired her performance, but in his heart, he was a little disappointed.</p>

  <p>"I told you, Yan will definitely be able to obtain the inheritance," said Harold with certainty.</p>

  <p>Marsh rolled his eyes. "You did, but Zheng hasn't had his turn yet. Maybe her brother will get the inheritance."</p>

  <p>"He can't fly," answered Harold.</p>

  <p>Hearing such an answer, the two Holy Beings were left speechless.</p>

  <p>It did make sense.</p>

  <p>The top-rank True Gods could fly without anything, but Zheng could only fly with his flying sword.</p>

  <p>It might not be much of a disadvantage for him during battles, but in this case, it would have a huge impact on his abilities.</p>

  <p>After all, he would constantly have to split his focus between rising up and driving the flying sword under his feet.</p>

  <p>Just as they were talking, the purple light in Yan's eyes suddenly brightened.</p>

  <p>She lowered her head and murmured to herself.</p>

  <p>A ring appeared under her feet.</p>

  <p>"Break! Speed! Strength!"</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>As the circular ring began to spin, her body suddenly shot up.</p>

  <p>As she climbed, everyone heard a harsh grating sound around her body.</p>

  <p>One could only imagine how much resistance she had to face.</p>

  <p>Even so, Yan broke through the barrier and reached a height of nine hundred and twenty feet!</p>

  <p>As she pointed at the cyan stone tablet with her finger, its surface sank.</p>

  <p>A huge "Yan" appeared on the stone tablet, and then she rolled down.</p>
