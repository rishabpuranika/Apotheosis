  <p>
</p>

  <p>Mike shook his head, confused by the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord's words. "Sir, what hope? What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>Bromley was the first to react. "Is it because of the butterfly Mike carried?"</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord nodded in response.</p>

  <p>"That butterfly... Does it have any secret?" Mike asked.</p>

  <p>"If he comes, I believe he will save the whole Ruin Graveyard," the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord answered with a smile.</p>

  <p>In fact, he no longer attached much importance to the Ruin Graveyard.</p>

  <p>He now placed all his hopes on Zheng, so this place became dispensable to him.</p>

  <p>He and his disciples left their souls because they wondered how things could develop. Even if Zheng did not arrive, it wouldn't have mattered.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, he was convinced that Zheng would come.</p>

  <p>After all, both the divine land and his parents were here.</p>

  <p>"He? Who is it that you refer to?" Mike asked frantically.</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord grinned and his body began to fluctuate.</p>

  <p>While he returned to Tianming's Lone Sword, he spoke calmly, "Hold on.</p>

  <p>He should be coming any moment now."</p>

  <p>Then, he disappeared and everyone grew silent. They could not believe someone was going to save them.</p>

  <p>In terms of strength, Tianming reached the thirty-third floor of the Mysterious Yellow Tower and was already a master in the thirty-third stage of the Other Shore Realm. With this, he was well recognized as a top master in the chaos. If anything, Zheng might not even stand a chance against him.</p>

  <p>Was the man who the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord mentioned even more powerful than Tianming?</p>

  <p>Though no one said it aloud, everyone doubted what he had said.</p>

  <p>He did not make a promise or reassure them. His words sounded more like encouragement so they could push through future difficulties.</p>

  <p>"No matter what, the Ruin Graveyard is the last place we will live in. Let's hold on until reinforcements arrive," Bromley reassured.</p>

  <p>Outside the Ruin Graveyard, all the heads, big and small, were cleared up.</p>

  <p>However, a large number of heads still arrived from afar.</p>

  <p>After what happened in the Rotten Tree Forest, all the races from the Ruin Graveyard sent their clansmen and warriors to inquire.</p>

  <p>With full transparency, Bromley explained everything they knew and what the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord had said.</p>

  <p>People had very mixed reactions.</p>

  <p>When the heads initially attacked, the native races of the Ruin Graveyard did not fight to the fullest of their abilities.</p>

  <p>They had doubts about each other and suspected the humans. Moreover, they made intricate escape plans if it was necessary.</p>

  <p>Once the Ruin Graveyard was completely destroyed, they would gather the remaining members to escape.</p>

  <p>They figured that though the heads covered almost everywhere, they might only be distributed across the Ruin Graveyard.</p>

  <p>As they had anticipated this to unfold, the races preserved their strength for the escape rather than the attacks.</p>

  <p>However, they grew excited as they caught sight of the light dragons in the Rotten Tree Forest.</p>

  <p>As expected, the Ruin Graveyard was protected by a powerhouse.</p>

  <p>On top of that, Bromley's words excited them even more. They began to give an all-out fight.</p>

  <p>Just like that, all the powerful warriors of the human race and the other races had gone out.</p>

  <p>If the heads even came close, they would be instantly killed to prevent them from devouring and growing stronger.</p>

  <p>In the first three days, almost no head survived in the Ruin Graveyard under the joint efforts of many races.</p>

  <p>But on the fourth day, the dynamic changed.</p>

  <p>The number of heads had increased, and they were ten to twenty times larger than the previous heads that attacked the Ruin Graveyard.</p>

  <p>Although all the races did their best to fight the heads off, some managed to escape and devoured many creatures almost instantly.</p>

  <p>Once these heads entered the Ruin Graveyard, they grew rapidly as they devoured. This made them more threatening opponents.</p>

  <p>By the fifth day, hundreds of heads that grew a hundred times larger, and two that grew a thousand times larger appeared in the Ruin Graveyard.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore Realm masters of the various races died, and many Holy Beings of the divine land were injured and killed as well.</p>

  <p>If the two heads which were a thousand times larger continued to devour, they would grow to a size bigger than the Ruin Graveyard.</p>

  <p>Even Tianming felt powerless as he faced the gigantic heads. With the help of dozens of warriors at the high stages of the Other Shore Realm, he launched an attack on one of the gigantic heads but failed.</p>

  <p>Though they managed to injure the head, almost half of the warriors in this attempt died.</p>

  <p>Once again, the Ruin Graveyard was in grave danger.</p>

  <p>Floating in the air, Tianming looked at the heads from a distance. He held the Lone Sword horizontally before him and asked, "Sir, is there really no other way to save the Ruin Graveyard?"</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord remained silent.</p>

  <p>The answer was obvious.</p>

  <p>At this point, the Ruin Graveyard was a cub pushed into an arena. Even if Tianming became the sharpest claw of the cub, they would still have no hope to win the battle.</p>

  <p>There was no other choice but to hold on.</p>

  <p>Six hours later, the other huge head grew to ten thousand times larger than the ordinary ones.</p>

  <p>It was easily seen throughout the Ruin Graveyard. The women and children who hid in the depths of the Ruin Graveyard looked up at the large creature and were flushed with panic.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, the divine land docking within the Ruin Graveyard began to move.</p>

  <p>When Zheng left, the divine land was left in the control of the reincarnated Harper.</p>

  <p>He paid close attention to the disaster in the Ruin Graveyard. When he saw that it was about to be devoured, he moved to help out.</p>

  <p>Once the Ruin Graveyard broke open, he would control the divine land to rush out as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>Another two hours passed, and a massive tombstone was devoured. This head grew by twenty thousand times.</p>

  <p>At the sight of this, every living being sank into a sense of hopelessness.</p>

  <p>"Sir, if I burn the Lone Sword, can I kill that head?" Tianming asked with a tinge of hope left.</p>

  <p>If the Other Shore Tokens were burned, great powers would be unleashed.</p>

  <p>On top of that, the power of the Lone Sword could be more unimaginable if it were burned.</p>

  <p>However, it would lead to the punishment of truth.</p>

  <p>Even the Memory Flame could not save him from this, which meant he wouldn't have the possibility of rebirth, either.</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord remained silent.</p>

  <p>If they ever burned the Other Shore Token, it would only mean that the Ruin Graveyard was completely hopeless.</p>

  <p id="top_21">Tianming thought he couldn't give up so easily.</p>

  <p>Even if he had to sacrifice himself, he wouldn't think twice.</p>

  <p>He reached out his hand and gently stroked the sword. His eyes widened, but just as he was about to make a move, Bromley's voice echoed from not too far away. "Something is coming."</p>

  <p>Tianming turned his head to see, but merely gazed into a blank distance.</p>

  <p>However, after a few moments, a bean-sized thing could be seen moving from the depths of the chaos.</p>

  <p>"Oh, look how fast it is!" Mike squirmed in delight.</p>

  <p>The bean-sized thing grew larger as it moved closer.</p>

  <p>Slowly, it was close enough to be recognized. It was a giant clam with a big mouth.</p>

  <p>"Is that the hope?" Mike asked in a disappointed tone.</p>

  <p>Joy shrugged her shoulders. "It looks more like a joke."</p>

  <p>As they looked at it, they saw that the clam with large teeth and an odd shape was not there to save them at all.</p>
