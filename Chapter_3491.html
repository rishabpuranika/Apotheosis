<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Thunder Dimorphodon had very few encounters with the Black Ship, each mostly well out of the other's way. This was why the Black Ship's sudden attack had caught the Thunder Dimorphodon off guard.</p>

  <p>The Divine Farmer heaved a deep sigh. "I see. You are free to go now."</p>

  <p>"What about my payment?" the Thunder Dimorphodon asked.</p>

  <p>The Divine Farmer fixed a blank look at the Thunder Dimorphodon. "Of course I shall pay you. But since you only finished half the job, you also only get half the amount we agreed on."</p>

  <p>"You..." The Thunder Dimorphodon growled, its body crackling with lightning.</p>

  <p>"I'll just use the other half to buy the rest of the rings from the Black Ship," the Divine Farmer added.</p>

  <p>There were twelve rings in total, each one an extremely precious treasure.</p>

  <p>The Divine Farmer just hoped the Black Ship wouldn't know the use of these rings. He was willing to pay any price they asked to get all the remaining rings back.</p>

  <p>Shooting the Divine Farmer a dirty look, the Thunder Dimorphodon snorted and then took a step back, curling up its wings.</p>

  <p>The Divine Farmer took a ring in his hand and studied it carefully.</p>

  <p>The ring, in addition to its mysterious aura, didn't look special at all. Could it really help a creature on the Other Shore to descend to the chaos?</p>

  <p>After examining it for a while, the Divine Farmer recited a quiet chant, a trace of Truth of Godly Way emanating from him.</p>

  <p>He closed his eyes and entered the Other Shore with his soul.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Arriving at the Other Shore, his soul emerged in a huge red hall.</p>

  <p>The hall was magnificent and extravagant. A colossal arch stretching tens of thousands of feet stood in the distance. Beneath the arch lay a huge disc with nine thrones lined along the edge, facing the center.</p>

  <p>The Divine Farmer walked straight to the center of the disc and stomped his foot lightly.</p>

  <p>Numerous red patterns surfaced on the huge disc. A small orb appeared on each of the surrounding thrones.</p>

  <p>"I've got the Descending Rings." The Divine Farmer raised his hand, displaying the ring he was holding.</p>

  <p>He managed to bring the ring into the Other Shore!</p>

  <p>At his pronouncement, the orbs on the thrones started to flash with light, thrilled at what they were seeing.</p>

  <p>"You brought it to the Other Shore successfully! This is a great development!"</p>

  <p>"It is indeed as miraculous as the Chaotic Source Spirits!"</p>

  <p>"Our speculations were right!"</p>

  <p>The orbs all fixed their gazes on the ring, their voices trembling with excitement as they chattered among themselves.</p>

  <p>Once creatures born in the chaos entered the Other Shore with their entire presence, they would be trapped there permanently.</p>

  <p>There was no way for them to descend to the chaos unless they became Other Shore Tokens for other creatures.</p>

  <p>But what powerful being would be willing to lower themselves by becoming just someone else's tool?</p>

  <p>The descendants of the Chaotic Source Spirits, however, had managed to find a way around this restriction. These conditions didn't affect them at all!</p>

  <p>This unusual matter had attracted the attention of the most powerful creatures on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>They realized that perhaps this was the only way for them to return to the chaos!</p>

  <p>"If this ring can really get us back to the chaos, then all the other problems will be solved. Who would be able to fight against our Blood Assembly?</p>

  <p>Haha!" The orb in the middle throne burst into laughter. "Moon Fire Slave!</p>

  <p>Try it!"</p>

  <p>At the command, a towering figure appeared behind the huge arch.</p>

  <p>It was a giant made of flames. Dark green flames surrounded his enormous body. A sense of brutal strength emanated from him.</p>

  <p>With loud strides that shook the entire hall, he walked up to the Divine Farmer and squatted down in front of him.</p>

  <p>The Divine Farmer tossed the ring at the giant, which dropped gently onto his body. As a smile flashed on the giant's fiery face, he growled and abruptly disappeared from the spot.</p>

  <p>"Did he make it?"</p>

  <p>"So he left the Other Shore, just like that?"</p>

  <p>"You! Go and have a look!" the orbs on the thrones demanded.</p>

  <p>The Divine Farmer nodded. He transported himself out of the Other Shore and back into the chaos. He saw the Moon Fire Slave floating not far away from him.</p>

  <p>"So this is the chaos. Amazing!" The Moon Fire Slave was the descendant of the ancient Element Spirit Civilization, born on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Although he had long known that there was a huge world of chaos outside the Other Shore, this was the first time for him to set foot in it.</p>

  <p>His ancestors had once ruled over this vast space. Back then, elements had dominion over all. Other creatures of flesh and steel were way too weak compared to the powerful Element Spirit Civilization.</p>

  <p>Powerful as they were, however, they had failed to complete the Finale Way, too. Thus, they had no choice but to escape into the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>After over one thousand chaotic eras, a descendant of the Element Spirit Civilization had finally returned to this world again!</p>

  <p>The sudden appearance of the Moon Fire Slave startled the Thunder Dimorphodon.</p>

  <p>Lightning swirled around its body, forming a net to protect itself. It crouched silently with a terrified look in its one eye.</p>

  <p>The Divine Farmer observed the Moon Fire Slave silently.</p>

  <p>He exuded nothing but calm.</p>

  <p>He knew the truth was the highest law in the chaos. It was not an easy thing to go against the truth and go back to the chaos.</p>

  <p>"Old fellow! Show me the way! Take me to the Source World to see the lowly races dwelling in our old land!" the Moon Fire Slave ordered.</p>

  <p>There was nothing but the brown chaotic energy in this chaos cloud.</p>

  <p>Obviously, this bleak sight wouldn't satisfy the Moon Fire Slave.</p>

  <p>Although the Divine Farmer was the leader of a great race, the giant had no respect for him, regarding him as a nobody compared to the Element Spirit Civilization.</p>

  <p>"There's no need to hurry," replied the Divine Farmer in a calm voice, ignoring the Moon Fire Slave's rude tone.</p>

  <p>"No need to hurry?"</p>

  <p>Flames of rage gushed out of the giant's huge body. "I'm not asking for your opinion. I am ordering you!" he roared impatiently.</p>

  <p>"Ordering me?" the Divine Farmer asked, his lips curling into a faint smile.</p>

  <p>He had indulged the Blood Assembly for many years. It had apparently made these Other Shore creatures more and more arrogant.</p>

  <p>"Maybe you should worry about surviving, first," the Divine Farmer pointed out.</p>

  <p>"Surviving? What do you mean?" the Moon Fire Slave asked, truly confused.</p>

  <p>He was a fire spirit, the most powerful form of fire creature.</p>

  <p>He was simply indestructible unless he was killed in a special way.</p>

  <p>Who could threaten his survival in the chaos?</p>

  <p>Just then, something unusual happened.</p>

  <p>The ring on his head flashed with a mysterious light. An invisible force suddenly came crashing down on him.</p>

  <p>The force was so strong that he could not put up any resistance at all. The Moon Fire Slave was caught and pushed against the air.</p>

  <p>It was as if an invisible wall existed in the space, and the mysterious force was now grabbing the giant and smashing him against it.</p>

  <p>Bang! With a horrible sound, the black rock covering the Moon Fire Slave's body melted and was reduced to powder!</p>

  <p>The green flames spurting out from his body left many long green trails on the invisible wall.</p>

  <p>The force was relentless. The Moon Fire Slave was smashed against the wall again and again, until his body was completely destroyed, crushed into shreds.</p>

  <p>The Thunder Dimorphodon watched the incredible sight from the sidelines, its eye widening in shock.</p>

  <p>The unknown force was terrifying. If it were the Thunder Dimorphodon who had been tortured like that, it would have ended up in a worse state than the Moon Fire Slave!</p>
