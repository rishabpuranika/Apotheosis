<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Lamar was a Soul Sea Realm master, which explained his speedy reaction.</p>

  <p>But the moment the black arrows pierced his ghost staff, his burly body began to twist.</p>

  <p>The three black arrows penetrated Lamar's enormous body one after the other. But since his body had begun to twist, two of three arrows pierced his right shoulder and his thigh, and the third passed through his chest, close to his heart.</p>

  <p>Six small holes appeared in his body, pulsing with blood. Lamar was, however, a strong ogre, which meant that these injuries weren't fatal at all.</p>

  <p>But that didn't mean that the situation was not dangerous.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had aimed his three black arrows at Lamar's head and heart. If Lamar hadn't twisted his body at the last moment, he would have turned into a corpse by now.</p>

  <p>Lamar was lucky enough to avoid the three black arrows. He looked fearful as his gaze looked for the source of the arrows. As he found Luo Luo Zheng, his fear turned to shock and fury.</p>

  <p>"He is a human being! An early-stage human war sage! How did he shoot out three terrifying arrows? This guy is definitely not from the Purple Heart Sacred Place! Where is he from?" Lamar muttered, staring at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Esther, who was standing beside Luo Luo Zheng, had clapped her hand to her mouth as she looked at Luo Luo Zheng reverently. She had stayed with Luo Luo Zheng in the Tower of Sin for a long time so she knew the extent of Luo Zheng's strength. But she hadn't expected just the three arrows to hurt the Soul Sea Realm master to this extent. This surprised her even more since Lamar was a strong ogre.</p>

  <p>And she could see that the three arrows had almost killed him.</p>

  <p>"You are just a human warrior but you've managed to injure me! You are remarkable! I'll give you one more chance to challenge me. And then, I'll let you die a miserable death!" Lamar said flatly.</p>

  <p>In his shock and anger, Lamar had even given up on attacking Lacey. He gathered the raging flames together and charged towards Luo Luo Zheng at an unbelievable speed.</p>

  <p>Above the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place, the ogre war sages and the Demon Night's war sages stopped fighting. The black arrows that Luo Luo Zheng had sent flying towards Lamar had shocked them, too. And now, they sneered as Lamar dashed towards Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's black arrows had been a shock, but it could have been a fluke because Luo Luo Zheng was merely an early-stage war sage after all. The ogre war sages believed that he might be in great trouble for provoking Lamar.</p>

  <p>Lamar's body was like a small flying mountain as it charged towards Luo Luo Zheng. It formed an increasingly expanding shadow under the sunlight, enveloping Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did not avert his eyes. He was pretty confident about this.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng?" Esther became more and more anxious by every minute that Luo Luo Zheng didn't budge. She knew that Luo Luo Zheng couldn't escape, even if he wanted to, because it was a Soul Sea Realm master he was up against.</p>

  <p>To Esther's surprise, Luo Luo Zheng shouted at her, "Esther, move away!"</p>

  <p>At the same time, the power of the dragon scales within Luo Zheng's body began to circulate frantically.</p>

  <p>One thousand dragon scales! Two thousand dragon scales! Three thousand dragon scales! Four thousand dragon scales! And then, five thousand dragon scales!</p>

  <p>The dragon scales' power had reached its limit.</p>

  <p>Lamar was a Soul Sea Realm master but he didn't use his domain, perhaps because he despised Luo Luo Zheng to no end. He probably felt that there was no need to open up his domain while dealing with an early-stage war sage.</p>

  <p>But for Luo Luo Zheng, this was a good chance.</p>

  <p>As long as he avoided being trapped in the domain of the ogre Soul Sea Realm master, Luo Luo Zheng was almost invincible in this great world. Now, in order to defeat his opponent, he had to make use of all of his strength to fight against Lamar, who was sorely underestimating his strength.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! You are just a war sage, but you aren't even trying to dodge my attack! You are really courageous! Or perhaps just stupid!" As he watched Luo Luo Zheng stand still as a mountain, Lamar was confused, but also extremely furious. 'Does such an ordinary war sage really dare challenge me?' Lamar thought. "The price of your courage is that you will be smashed to smithereens!"</p>

  <p>Lamar had barely finished speaking when his bulky arm suddenly began to swell. His bronze fist was now half the size of Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell, little guy!" Lamar sneered. As the forceful energy erupted from his fist, he threw a punch towards Luo Luo Zheng, who still stood his ground and didn't dodge him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's gaze was calm, but the power in his hand was like a tidal wave as it gushed into his fist. He also swung his fist, a slight smile on his face.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's smile caused Lamar to hesitate a little. Luo Luo Zheng didn't seem like a lunatic and he should know by now that he was going to die. But he was smiling, which led Lamar to guess that there was probably a trick involved in all of this.</p>

  <p>There was a saying among the ogres that no matter how cunning a wolf was, it could not defeat a stronger hunter.</p>

  <p>With the absolute advantage of power, Lamar believed that he could prevent Luo Luo Zheng from playing any trick and could surely beat him.</p>

  <p>But when the fists of the two warriors collided with each other, the entire battle changed face. Everyone saw Lamar's fist crack at impact, the bones on his fist crumbling into tiny particles. The veins and vessels on his large arm burst and pieces of muscle peeled off his arm under the impact of such a huge force.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>The bones in his hand began to break apart layer by layer, the terrifying power of Luo Zheng's punch continuing to work even after. Under the impact of Luo Zheng's powerful punch, the small bones began to split apart, disintegrating into fine powder.</p>

  <p>Just a single punch had smashed Lamar's right hand into smithereens.</p>

  <p>As his hand disintegrated, Lamar was sent flying backwards because of the power of the punch.</p>

  <p>The sky above the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place was dead silent. No one had imagined, even in their wildest dreams that a Soul Sea Realm master would be defeated by a first-level war sage!</p>

  <p>What was more, this ogre Soul Sea Realm master had prided himself on his physical body. He was the patriarch of the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place!</p>

  <p>Esther, who had stayed several hundred feet away from Luo Luo Zheng, was shocked at this development. As she looked on with glassy eyes, her shock apparent on her face, Esther suddenly thought of the title that Luo Luo Zheng had obtained at the Talent Tablet in the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>The Celestial Position, the golden Celestial Position...</p>

  <p>She did not know that besides the golden Celestial Position, there were also many other titles like the silver and the bronze titles, on the Talent Tablet. But right now, Esther was hit with a rather preposterous but precise premonition that perhaps very few Upper World warriors could obtain such a title as the golden Celestial Position.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng! That warrior is Luo Luo Zheng!" an ogre war sage suddenly roared as if he had discovered something amazing.</p>

  <p>A majority of the ogre war sages present had never seen Luo Luo Zheng before, but a small number of them had once been in the Tower of Sin and seen Luo Luo Zheng there before. They had left that place and become war sages once they had made a breakthrough and reached the higher cultivation level.</p>

  <p>Moments ago, those war sages hadn't been certain of Luo Zheng's identity. The figure had been somewhat familiar, but they learned from the information of the two ogre sacred places that Luo Luo Zheng had long since left the Sea God Continent.</p>

  <p>And now, someone had finally recognized Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng! He's that human warrior from the Tower of Sin!"</p>

  <p>"He's the enemy of our two ogre sacred places!"</p>

  <p>"He was just an early-stage war lord a year ago. And he has become a war sage now!"</p>

  <p>"But how could a war sage like him defeat Lamar?"</p>

  <p>The ogre war sages looked surprised yet indignant. Back then, Luo Luo Zheng had driven the ogres out of the Tower of Sin because the powerful masters of the two ogre sacred places hadn't been able to enter the Cursed Land. But now, Luo Luo Zheng wasn't relying on the Tower of Sin, and had openly stood at the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place to challenge Lamar.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's punch had even broken one of Lamar's arms while he looked unarmed. Many of the ogre war sages were unable to accept this truth.</p>

  <p>The war sages of the Demon Night, on the other hand, had earlier been in a state of despair, but the moment they had recognized Luo Luo Zheng, they became hopeful. Even though Luo Luo Zheng was only a war sage, his battle with Lamar had revealed Luo Zheng's strength. This was enough for Luo Luo Zheng to become their hope.</p>
