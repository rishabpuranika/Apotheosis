<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>In the eyes of the Saint Lords from the tenth-grade sacred places, Lincoln's group was nothing more than a key to open the door.</p>

  <p>As long as the door was opened, they were of no use to them. To kill them would be as simple as crushing an ant.</p>

  <p>Ab could feel the power of the bloody light. He also felt that as long as he touched even a trace of it, it was very likely that he would be reduced to ashes. His face immediately turned deathly pale. He lost control of his emotions at the deaths of his six brothers. Finally, he realized that he had offended people whom he never should have offended.</p>

  <p>Moreover, they were from the ogre race. People like him were nothing more than grass to them; they could trample on them as they pleased.</p>

  <p>Seeing the blood light emit out, Ab did not even have the courage to dodge it. After all, a world lord was two realms higher than him. How could he match up to that?</p>

  <p>But at this moment, the Saint Lord of the Magnolia Sacred Place reached out and a light blue screen appeared in front of Ab. The Saint Lord said indifferently, "Yosef, haven't we, the people from the three sacred places, agreed that we won't kill anyone, no matter which race comes to open the underground palace?"</p>

  <p>Hearing his words, the bloody light in the hands of the Saint Lord from the ogre race gradually faded away. It did not make much difference if he killed an ant! He only gave a faint snort and paid no more attention to Ab.</p>

  <p>The human Saint Lord glanced at Ab quickly. Considering that he was also from the human race, the Saint Lord said, "Since you've chosen to enter this underground palace, you should have been prepared to pay for it with your lives. For martial artists, to experience trials is an everyday occurrence in this world. Try your best to survive."</p>

  <p>What the human Saint Lord meant was simple— since Ab led his companions to explore the underground palace, he must be ready to compensate for it with their lives. He could not accuse someone else for not rescuing him in time, just because he himself was too weak to survive. It was immature of him.</p>

  <p>How could Ab not understand this truth? He was just unwilling to accept it.</p>

  <p>When he looked up, he saw Lincoln, Luo Zheng, and Freya jump down from the Nine-head Snake statue. Once again, Ab felt it to be unfair.</p>

  <p>He knew Lincoln was strong, but why were Luo Zheng and Freya left unwounded? Just now, the two of them had been surrounded by the Cannibal Moths. How did they escape from that danger? Ab was clueless.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng leaped down, the human Saint Lord's gaze landed on him. A flicker of appreciation appeared on his emotionless face. The Saint Lord saw clearly that the young man had some kind of a magical power to see through the theurgy of the Dark Law. Under the siege of the Cannibal Moths, he managed to evade the attacks and hold on till the last moment.</p>

  <p>Zheng's gaze met the Saint Lord's for a moment and he nodded. Although it had not been long since he ascended to the Upper World, he had already seen many powerful people like world lords, expectant world lords, and also those who were a half-step away from a world lord. The old man in front of him was not anyone special…</p>

  <p>However, Freya sensed the cultivation of the human Saint Lord and timidly came to stand behind Luo Zheng. Previously in the Spirit Reading World, Jevan had been a figure Freya had looked up to. Freya could not believe her eyes as she stared at him.</p>

  <p>The Saint Lord felt a little strange about Luo Zheng being so calm. He had wanted to ask if the boy was an independent warrior. If so, he would take him to Magnolia Sacred Place and properly nurture him. In future, Luo Zheng would certainly become a great figure.</p>

  <p>"Master, everyone is here," at this time, a Spirit Supreme Realm warrior came before the human Saint Lord, interrupting his thoughts.</p>

  <p>The Saint Lords could only get to the entrance of the underground palace. Although they had the strength to force their way in or break the enchanted barrier, they were aware that the treasures in the underground palace would be destroyed if they did so. If their cultivation was too strong, it could also trigger an annihilation.</p>

  <p>Because of this reason, not a single world lord had dared to barge into the underground palace all these years.</p>

  <p>The human Saint Lord nodded as he said, "For you, this is a rare opportunity. It has already been a hundred thousand years since the underground palace was last opened. You must seize this chance."</p>

  <p>"Yes, master!"</p>

  <p>Although Magnolia Sacred Place was a tenth-grade sacred place, the Dark World did not have many advantages when compared to other supreme worlds. Even the borderland supreme world— Spirit Reading World— was far more equipped. Magnolia Sacred Place was not too popular among the many tenth-grade sacred places in the alliance. So far, there was not a single warrior in the place who had qualified to enter the thirteen palaces.</p>

  <p>There were not many opportunities left for the talents from Magnolia Sacred Place. But now that the underground palace was opened, it brought them much assurance.</p>

  <p>Aside from these warriors of the human race, the talents from the ogre and the Demon Night races had also prepared to enter the underground palace.</p>

  <p>As for Lincoln, he was visibly helpless.</p>

  <p>It had not been easy for him to get his hands on such a great opportunity.</p>

  <p>Finally, he had opened the underground palace. What he did not expect was that doing so would attract the attention of so many others. Could it be that these secret treasures of the Dark World was an open secret?</p>

  <p>Were these people guarding the palace for his arrival?</p>

  <p>Previously, he had been too naive. He had planned to share the secret treasures of the underground palace with Adrian and Luo Zheng. The shares would have been distributed among themselves. Thirty percent for Adrian, thirty percent for Luo Zheng, and forty percent for himself. But now, it seemed that he had been daydreaming. With so many people entering, who knew what he would be able to get!</p>

  <p>Moreover, Lincoln had no power and no influence. Now that the door to the underground palace had been opened, he could not just kick out the three Saint Lords of the sacred places with his power alone. If he had the ability to do such a thing, there would have been no need whatsoever to enter the underground palace.</p>

  <p>Seeing Lincoln's dejected look, Luo Zheng patted him on the shoulder and said,</p>

  <p>"There's still a chance."</p>

  <p>The world lords could not enter the palace. How could the talents of the Dark World compete with someone like Luo Zheng and Lincoln?</p>

  <p>It was true that Lincoln still had a chance, but when he thought of the fact that what had originally belonged to him was now being taken over by these people, he was understandably upset. Still, he was adaptable to circumstances, so he prepared to enter the underground palace with Luo Zheng and Freya.</p>

  <p>But they did not expect what happened next. As they prepared to enter the underground palace, the Saint Lord of the ogre race snorted coldly and waved his rough hands. An invisible force restrained Luo Zheng, Lincoln, and Freya. "Little bastards come from nowhere and wish to enter the palace ahead of my people!"</p>

  <p>The three of them were immediately held back by the invisible barrier.</p>

  <p>Lincoln's face turned red as blood rushed to his face. He was the one to open the door, yet he was the one now being held back! This was going too far.</p>

  <p>However, the invisible energy was not something that they could resist.</p>

  <p>No matter how much Lincoln struggled, he was unable to move an inch.</p>

  <p>Seeing Lincoln struggle so much, a faint smile emerged on the ogre Saint Lord's face. If he had not made the promise to the other two Saint Lords, he would have killed them a long time ago. To the Saint Lord of the ogre race, Luo Zheng, Lincoln, and the others were merely the key to the underground palace. Once it was opened, it hardly mattered what happened to these warriors.</p>

  <p>When the human Saint Lord saw this, he did not say a word to stop them.</p>

  <p>As long as the Saint Lord of the ogre race did not kill anyone, he would not be breaking any rules.</p>

  <p>Suppressed by the invisible power of the Saint Lord of the ogre race, Zheng's mouth twisted into a tight frown. Suddenly, the power of the dragon scales surged up inside his body. He stared at the invisible power as he lifted his foot.</p>

  <p>The Saint Lord of the ogre race possessed the cultivation of a world lord, but due to the history of the Dark World, there were no world lords.</p>

  <p>Therefore, he could be considered an expectant world lord who had the cultivation of a world lord, but did not possess the true abilities of that title. Similarly, the Saint Lord from the Spiritual Force Sacred Place in the Spirit Reading World was also an expectant world lord.</p>

  <p>Although the invisible force that bound Luo Zheng and the others did not look anything extraordinary, the Saint Lord of the ogre race possessed a cultivation of a world lord. He was one of the top three warriors in this supreme world and so his invisible power was unimaginably great.</p>

  <p>Lincoln, who was beside him, struggled furiously, but it was next to impossible for him to break free from the restraints of the invisible energy.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng continued to activate the dragon scales one by one. As the incrementing power poured into his body, he took a big step toward the entrance of the underground palace under the restraint of the immense invisible force of the Saint Lord of the ogre race.</p>

  <p>The Saint Lord could not help but exclaim in surprise. He looked at Luo Zheng with bewilderment.</p>
