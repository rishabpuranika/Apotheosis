<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2032 The Upper Hand </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Nathan didn't even bother dodging Maha's strike, unsettling the latter.</p>

  <p>His slash was already half out� if he wasn't willing to die with his opponent, he needed to pull it back forcefully.</p>

  <p>Against a fellow unafraid of death, Maha didn't seem to have any choice.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Maha twisted his body in midair, swinging out the blade in his hand and forcefully slashing the tip of Nathan's spear. After blocking Nathan's strike, he moved to the other side.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of the onlookers, the first exchange of moves between the two was to Maha's disadvantage. At the very least, he didn't dare face Nathan head on.</p>

  <p>During the past years, all those who dared challenge Maha had died in all sorts of miserable postures.</p>

  <p>There had never been a world lord who could gain the upper hand over Maha.</p>

  <p>"Haha! Maha seems to be afraid of Nathan."</p>

  <p>"Nahan's the true top Godly Genius� he seems even more reliable than Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>"Nathan has never been weak. Losing to Luo Zheng was a blip!"</p>

  <p>Within the Iron Moon City, the martial artists began boiling with excitement. They had already placed the heavy responsibility of defeating Maha on Nathan.</p>

  <p>It was known to the entire universe that the battle within the Sunflower Water World was not merely a duel. Every step here was tied to the fate of the entire Evolutionary Universe and all living beings within it.</p>

  <p>All the races of the Evolutionary Universe had already placed their bets on Nathan.</p>

  <p>Seeing Maha flee backward, Nathan followed suit without batting so much as an eyelid. The Heaven-piercing Spear in his hand was like a poisonous snake that had left its lair, shooting out an arc into the air, continuing to bite onto Maha's body relentlessly.</p>

  <p>The spear was pointed right at Maha's most fatal point. As long as the spear made its mark, Maha would fall to death.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>Even Maha felt anger rising within. He was facing a Godly Genius whose strength wasn't too far off. Nathan trained in the most dangerous Truth Godly Way, and he was unafraid of death. Maha couldn't deny that the fact was embarrassing on his part.</p>

  <p>With a swipe of the blade, it flew towards Nathan's head.</p>

  <p>If Nathan was caught in this blade attack, his entire head and soul would have been caught by Maha's blade.</p>

  <p>But just as it went with their first exchange of blows, Nathan had simply turned a blind eye to Maha's spear strike� he simply had no care for his own life. No matter what the outcome, he was going to fight to the death.</p>

  <p>"This damn guy! He's not afraid of death in the least."</p>

  <p>Gritting his teeth, Maha could only roll the blade in his hand again, deflecting Nathan's long spear once again.</p>

  <p>Surrounding the hill, as the two chased each other, a strange scene played out.</p>

  <p>Nathan was completely desperate, determined to take Maha's life. But Maha had managed to display a complete counterattack, never submitting to Nathan's spear.</p>

  <p>And it was extremely satisfying for the crowd of martial artists to watch Nathan chasing Maha around.</p>

  <p>"Maha looks so funny! He's like a stray dog in front of Nathan!"</p>

  <p>"He can barely fight back!"</p>

  <p>"The top Godly Genius of the Sacred race? I don't think he's anything special!"</p>

  <p>The warriors of the Sacred race, on the other hand, felt their expressions turn sullen. In their eyes, Maha was the highest under the Supreme Lords. Even with Maha's current strength, if he were to erupt completely, then some Supreme Lords would probably fall to defeat before him.</p>

  <p>Now that their top Godly Genius had encountered a Godly Genius of humankind, Maha was actually in a sorry state� the warriors of the Sacred race were humiliated.</p>

  <p>But some of the more discerning warriors also felt it a bit strange.</p>

  <p>Just what did this Nathan possess to be able to completely give up defense for his offense? Was this guy planning to sacrifice himself to defeat Maha?</p>

  <p>Indeed, it was a headache dealing with someone who had cultivated the Truth Godly Way with his life on the line. Let alone Maha, even a Supreme Lord was unable to stop Nathan. Once Nathan got close to them, the situation wouldn't be any better.</p>

  <p>At this point, Maha had managed to avoid over a hundred spear strikes from Nathan just by circling the hill, but he couldn't endure it any longer.</p>

  <p>When he turned around, his eyes flashed fiercely.</p>

  <p>The blade in his hand suddenly rose, instantly dragging a scarlet afterglow behind it. And at the same time, Maha's figure strangely disappeared.</p>

  <p>"Did he just use Grand Teleportation?"</p>

  <p>Nathan's eyes revealed a strange light.</p>

  <p>It would seem that Maha had just used the Grand Teleportation to escape the duel. Wasn't that a bit too embarrassing?</p>

  <p>"Haha! The Godly Genius of your race can't defeat Nathan. He even resorted to the Grand Teleportation to escape! It's simply humiliating!"</p>

  <p>Immediately, a world lord activated a Roaring Token and gave the universe an announcement.</p>

  <p>If the warriors of the Sacred race killed a human martial artist, they were to use the Roaring Tokens to suppress the momentum of the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>At this time, all those residing in the Evolutionary Universe knew that there was an invincible warrior named Maha in the Sacred race. Apart from the Supreme Lords, no one in the Evolutionary Universe could withstand several rounds of attacks from Maha.</p>

  <p>Under Maha's continuous propaganda along with the other martial artists of the Sacred race, the Sacred race's momentum was unstoppable.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the momentum of the Evolutionary Universe continued to weaken. In turn, the Evolutionary Universe itself was growing weaker and weaker.</p>

  <p>Now that someone had spread the news that Maha was no stronger than Nathan, the creatures in the universe thought it a blessing.</p>

  <p>All living beings in the Evolutionary Universe now knew that even though Maha was formidable, the Godly Genius of the Evolutionary Universe was undeniably stronger.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the Evolutionary Universe's momentum did a complete one-eighty� the warriors' confidence was boosted and everyone grew more and more vigorous.</p>

  <p>In the Dead Water World, near the Sunflower Water World, the many Supreme Lords of the Evolutionary Universe were all hiding.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords from major forces, including the Thoughtless Minds and the Blessed Buddha Land, had all deployed their most powerful techniques.</p>

  <p>An example was the Star Destroying Array that the masters of the four clans of the Thoughtless Minds had jointly set up.</p>

  <p>Another was the Grand Buddha Pagoda, set up by the Supreme Lords of the Blessed Buddha Land, leading by Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment.</p>

  <p>Everyone had already prepared their strongest moves, including Mu Ning, who had returned to the Evolutionary Universe later than Luo Zheng and the rest. With the help of the Celestial Position race, she had also set up the complete Gods Killing Sword Array.</p>

  <p>The nine Genuine Dragons with the heavenly bodies were also on standby.</p>

  <p>Although the possibility of the human race winning against the Sacred race seemed less than likely, it didn't mean that they'd allow themselves to be seized without putting up a fight.</p>

  <p>"Nathan seems to have the upper hand," Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment remarked with a smile.</p>

  <p>"This universe's momentum is constantly rising," replied Master Feng.</p>

  <p>He had taken control of the Heavens-suppressing Object, and with his Evolution Lotus Flower, he could feel the momentum of all the living creatures in the universe clear as day.</p>

  <p>But Supreme Lord of Original Sin shook his head. "If the opponent were to crack Nathan's desperate fighting style, I'm afraid we won't be able to escape trouble."</p>

  <p>Nathan was personally trained by Supreme Lord of Original Sin� the latter knew Nathan's strength well. In his eyes, Nathan was still slightly inferior to Maha. Right now, he only had the advantage of the Godly Way, using the Heavenly Sarira to resist Maha's Great Dominance Technique while simultaneously using a desperate method to take Maha by surprise.</p>

  <p>If Maha recovered his wits, naturally, he'd have a way to deal with it.</p>

  <p>But among the many Supreme Lords, none truly expected Nathan to win.</p>

  <p>This time, they had sent Nathan out to slow down the fall of the universe's momentum. Before they sent Nathan to Sunflower Water World, they were completely prepared for it.</p>

  <p>Using the Space Lock to lock himself in with Nathan, Supreme Lord Healum threw him into the Sunflower Water World while Supreme Lord Lester waited by his side, preparing to bring Nathan to life if need be.</p>

  <p>If Maha truly defeated and killed Nathan, Supreme Lord Healum would instantly pull Nathan's corpse back. By then, even if his soul was destroyed, Supreme Lord Lester's method would still be enough to completely resurrect Nathan using his Law of Causality.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the other Supreme Lords naturally paid close attention to Maha's and Nathan's movements in the Sunflower Water World.</p>

  <p>Just as the martial artists thought that Maha had used Grand Teleportation to escape, his figure suddenly appeared above Nathan like a ghost in the sky. There was an arrogant smile on his face as he said,</p>

  <p>"Haha, relying on only the Law Spear Strike to defeat me? How childish to underestimate me!"</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>With a light wave of his hand, Maha made a deep purple light surge out like a tide, directly overturning the area within ten thousand miles of Iron Moon City.</p>

  <p>After the light covered them, the onlookers could only see how everything around them was dyed a deep purple. There wasn't much else of a change and they couldn't tell what Maha's intent was.</p>

  <p>But Nathan's eyes were filled with fear and bewilderment. In his eyes, there were all sorts of rules for everything in the world. But after Maha released the deep purple light, it seemed to change the shape of space straight away.</p>
