<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3059 Entering A Huge Whirlpool Again </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>The swordsmanship manuals on the second floor of the Truth Library had requirements on compatibility degree of Truth of Divine Dao, so Luo Zheng could only buy manuals for Beldene and some others who were outstandingly talented among the disciples of the Sword Light Palace.</p>

  <p>As to the grading system for the swordsmanship manuals on the list of the Sword Light Palace, Luo Zheng had no idea.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng took out eight swordsmanship manuals under the eager eyes of Beldene and the others.</p>

  <p>As Beldene took them from Luo Zheng, his face shifted when he saw 'Buddhist Swordsmanship' written on the cover of one of the swordsmanship manuals.</p>

  <p>Elgin and the others walked up to Beldene and grabbed a swordsmanship manual each from his hands. One of them looked his swordsmanship manual over and his eyes widened. He exclaimed, "Divine River Swordsmanship! This is the swordsmanship the former leader has cultivated!"</p>

  <p>Beldene nodded, his expression serious. "These are all sixth-level swordsmanship manuals. They belong to the top truth theurgies on the swordsmanship manual list. You must have paid a heavy price for these swordsmanship manuals!" he said to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng waved a hand.</p>

  <p>He had earned 15 million divine crystals not long after he had entered the Source World. It might have been by luck, but he could use them for a long time. These eight swordsmanship manuals altogether had only cost him about three hundred thousand divine crystals.</p>

  <p>"Flag Master, can I practice this swordsmanship?" Elgin looked at Luo Zheng eagerly.</p>

  <p>The other disciples held on to their swordsmanship manuals, their hands trembling.</p>

  <p>To the disciples of the Sword Light Palace, these swordsmanship manuals only existed in legends. They weren't allowed to practice these swordsmanship manuals even if they were direct descendants of the Qiu Clan and the Bai Clan.</p>

  <p>Only core members of the Sword Light Palace were qualified to practice them.</p>

  <p>"Take any you like. These swordsmanship manuals are yours," Luo Zheng said with a smile.</p>

  <p>The place suddenly fell silent as the disciples began to carefully read the swordsmanship manuals they were holding.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked up at the sky. The sunset glow tinted the sky red. There was still an hour before it would get dark. So he found a corner, settled in, and opened the manual on the Divine Dao Blending Swordsmanship to study it.</p>

  <p>According to Beldene, the swordsmanship manual list had classified swordsmanship manuals all over the world into six grades.</p>

  <p>Since the Divine Dao Blending Swordsmanship in his hand was a supreme swordsmanship manual, he assumed it might not be included in the list.</p>

  <p>But the supreme swordsmanship manuals were probably not the top swordsmanship manuals. The swordsmanship theurgies that ensured the high status of the Taiyi Heaven Palace could not be measured by divine crystals. For example, the Origin Swordsmanship that Dorothy had mentioned was a unique skill of the master of the Origin Mountain. It was impossible for this Origin Swordsmanship to appear in the Truth Library.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng turned a page of the manual, and was surprised as he saw the first line on the first page. It was not about the swordsmanship, but a series of questions and answers from the same person.</p>

  <p>"What is the truth?"</p>

  <p>"The truth is something that is always right regardless of time or place."</p>

  <p>"Is it only a dream for one to achieve success in blending the Divine Dao?"</p>

  <p>"Everything in the world follows the same rule and only by keeping to your original aspiration will you achieve success."</p>

  <p>...</p>

  <p>As he progressed, Luo Zheng felt that this book was more like a record of Eastern Emperor Taiyi's understanding of blending the Divine Dao than a book of token.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! Looks like this guy was very ambitious when he compiled this Divine Dao Blending Swordsmanship," No. 9527 chimed in after a long period of silence. "He really thought he could comprehend the Truth Strike!"</p>

  <p>"It looked like blending the Divine Dao was really a trend back then," Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>"Of course. If one can really blend the Divine Dao, they can comprehend all the truth theologies from the power of the Divine Dao Great Unity and surpass all the Chaos Ancient Gods, and even surpass history and time. And then they could become real immortals. Who could resist such temptation?"</p>

  <p>No. 9527 chuckled. "What a pity they all gave up in the end. You are probably the only one that hasn't given up."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shook his head and ignored No. 9527's little speech. He wouldn't give up even if he were to fail.</p>

  <p>Besides, the Ways-blending Energy wasn't weak. Cultivating the Divine Dao Blending Swordsmanship could give play to its advantage.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng continued to browse the manual of the Divine Dao Blending Swordsmanship and was gradually immersed in the contents. His eyes became brighter by the second.</p>

  <p>There were only three recorded moves in the manual of Divine Dao Blending Swordsmanship. The Three Annihilation Strike, the Six Annihilation Strike, and the Thousand Annihilation Strike. He became more excited with each flip of the page.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi, who was the creator of the Taiyi Heaven Palace, was indeed extraordinary. From the manual he had compiled, Luo Zheng could see that his thoughts were very clear. He had divided the Ways-blending Energy into three stages, each stage having a different power that could almost activate the Ways-blending Energy to the maximum.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Luo Zheng hadn't made full use of his Ways-blending Strike.</p>

  <p>Every time he blended another Divine Dao, the power of the strike would increase. But the increase was largely attributed to the power of the Ways-blending Energy.</p>

  <p>In addition to the three moves of the Divine Dao Blending Swordsmanship, the Truth Strike was also mentioned at the end of the manual. But the Truth Strike was only Eastern Emperor Taiyi's speculation, which was why the Divine Dao Blending Swordsmanship was incomplete.</p>

  <p>"It will take some time to comprehend the Divine Dao Blending Swordsmanship."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had only roughly scanned the manual. No matter how gifted he was, it would be impossible for him to master it in a short time.</p>

  <p>An hour had passed without anyone noticing. When he closed the manual, a beam of starlight shot out again from the Dragon City. The starlight kept splitting into thousands of silver swords that rained down from the sky.</p>

  <p>Once Luo Zheng put the manual away, he closed his eyes and began to recite the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent. After a while, his soul entered the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng entered the Sea of Truth, he heard Ear Mouse's voice from close by. "I've already given you the divine crystals. Why haven't I seen him?"</p>

  <p>"What's the hurry? Do you think 15 million divine crystals is a large amount that could make him come at any moment?" Dorothy replied.</p>

  <p>It looked like Dorothy had already come to the Sea of Truth. The Ear Mouse, afraid of getting stood up, urged and complained incessantly.</p>

  <p>"Here he comes at last!". The Ear Mouse became excited when Luo Zheng appeared outside the huge whirlpool.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked at the Ear Mouse, and then said to Dorothy, "Wait for me. After I unlock the whirlpool, you tell the Ear Mouse to leave first."</p>

  <p>He then withdrew from the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>"Why did he disappear again?" the Ear Mouse squeaked again, anxious that Luo Zheng had left.</p>

  <p>Dorothy ignored the Ear Mouse and stayed put beside the huge whirlpool.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's body was a must to unlock the huge whirlpool and his body was now still at the second line.</p>

  <p>Earlier in the day, Luo Zheng had learned from Monica that there was no secret practice room outside the Dragon City. So if he wanted to find a secret place, he needed to sneak underground. Many people went underground if they didn't want to be disturbed.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng exited the Sea of Truth, reached out a hand, and gently pressed it to the ground. A huge force spread downwards, a slight tremor shaking the ground. Moments later, a huge pit about a hundred feet deep appeared under his feet.</p>

  <p>He then set a barrier around this pit and hid himself inside it.</p>

  <p>The others were either immersing themselves in comprehending the truth theurgies, or wandering around the Sea of Truth. They wouldn't care even if they noticed Luo Zheng's actions. After all, it was none of their business.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng ignited the flame and once again, landed on the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>It was much easier for him to use his body to cross the sea than to use his Soul of Light.</p>

  <p>There was resistance at the third and the fourth lines, but it didn't affect Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He swam for four hours in the Sea of Truth before he saw the huge whirlpool. He could even faintly see the outlines of Dorothy and the Ear Mouse in the distance.</p>

  <p>The Ear Mouse only knew that Luo Zheng could unlock the huge whirlpool. But Luo Zheng didn't want to expose his method of unlocking the huge whirlpool to it.</p>

  <p>So he decided to enter the whirlpool from its other end. The moment he made up his mind, his body was sucked into the bottom of the whirlpool.</p>

  <p>This time, Luo Zheng felt at ease since he was now familiar with the process.</p>
