<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Without question, War King Wind had also specialized in fire-attribute cultivation methods. His comprehension of the Fire Law was way deeper than Fiona's.</p>

  <p>Having been able to comprehend the third layer of the Fire Law, Fiona even owned a jade bracelet that was considered to be a semi-divine weapon. But this didn't mean that she was able to resist all kinds of flames, such as the phoenix's fire attacks.</p>

  <p>Truthfully, War King Wind was only testing Fiona. He absolutely didn't want her to suffer any damage, which was why he brought her away from the enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>Even Turner himself wanted to bring Luo Zheng out of the enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>Since he had chosen to protect him, he didn't want Luo Zheng to die in there.</p>

  <p>The problem was he found it hard to understand what Luo Zheng was saying.</p>

  <p>Previously, Luo Zheng was completely unharmed by the impact of the phoenix's Sun Flame Attack. On his face, an expression of wanting more was plastered. What was the purpose of him infuriating the phoenix? Did he really hope for the phoenix to use its full strength?</p>

  <p>As he thought of it, Turner wasn't able to do anything at all.</p>

  <p>Just as the War King Wind had pulled Fiona out of the enchanted barrier, the phoenix curled its body and began to shrink. The fire ring around it also began to condense rapidly.</p>

  <p>Fiona stood outside the enchanted barrier as she stared at the contractual beast. "Tianxing has provoked it. Now, it wants to use the Nirvana Flames to burn him," she said.</p>

  <p>The phoenix was the symbol for immortality.</p>

  <p>The overall strength of this species was slightly weaker than that of the Genuine Dragon, but their vitality was much greater. Even the Nine-head Snake, a kind of legendary beast who had a super healing ability, did not compare to the Genuine Phoenix in that very aspect.</p>

  <p>The phoenixes, unlike all the other beasts, could be reborn forever. As long as fire existed, they could come back to life.</p>

  <p>Why did Luo Zheng feel a kind of power that surpassed the third layer of Fire Law when Fiona summoned Fiery Shine? What was that all about?</p>

  <p>Ultimately, it was because it had reincarnated within the flames. Before Fiona summoned Fiery Shine, it had already died once.</p>

  <p>Death wasn't a threat for the Genuine Phoenix. They could choose to die at any time and place, and they could also be reborn from any fire.</p>

  <p>During the process of coming back to life, phoenixes could release the Nirvana Flames. That was also the fourth layer of the Fire Law, also known as the Flames of Rebirth.</p>

  <p>Out of the ten layers of the Fire Law, the first one was called the "Raging Fire." The second layer was "The Ashes" while the third one was "Annihilation." The fourth layer was called "The Rebirth."</p>

  <p>After burning everything, it could bring forth a new life. That was how it got its name.</p>

  <p>As it gradually became smaller, the phoenix curled up its entire body and eventually turned into a round egg.</p>

  <p>The phoenix egg flickered with an orange-red luster that looked extremely smooth as if it were a giant gem. However, at that time, no one dared to approach it, as endless Fire Law began to surge out from it. That was the fourth layer of Fire Law.</p>

  <p>When the Fire Law had finally left the phoenix egg, it transformed into a golden-red flame storm that began to sweep throughout the surroundings.</p>

  <p>The Soul Sea Realm warrior who set up the enchanted barrier had a grave look on his face. The intensity of Law Power was vastly different in each layer. Even such a mighty warrior like him felt that the fourth layer of the Fire Law was a little tricky. If the phoenix managed to break through out of the enchanted barrier, then all hell could break loose.</p>

  <p>Therefore, he was doing his utmost best to stabilize the enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>The storm of flames embraced everything that it reached.</p>

  <p>The cube that had been formed by the enchanted barrier looked just like hell. In an instant, there was nothing else but flames that could be seen.</p>

  <p>Countless divine-level talents on the square were beginning to worry.</p>

  <p>Although the enchanted barrier was built by an almighty warrior at the Soul Sea Realm, what could happen if it broke? The presence of the storm of flames could likely affect a number of people. It was terrifying.</p>

  <p>Despite the fear that was brewing deep inside them, they all managed to hold it in. After all, they were a group of divine-level talents. They couldn't bring shame on the martial houses and divine kingdoms they represented.</p>

  <p>Under the sweep of the flaming storm, Zheng's entire body was thoroughly red. Not long later, a golden rune appeared on his skin.</p>

  <p>'I made it, ' Luo Zheng thought to himself, overjoyed.</p>

  <p>More golden runes began to appear throughout his body. They covered his hands, feet, face, and shoulders.</p>

  <p>The golden runes continued to rotate as they absorbed the flames. Soon, Luo Zheng started to look like a golden bronze sculpture.</p>

  <p>Even if the flames constantly enveloped him, Luo Zheng didn't suffer any injuries under the shroud of those golden runes. He felt extremely comfortable apart from the slight heat that he felt throughout his body.</p>

  <p>Slowly, Luo Zheng walked through the flaming storm and carefully approached the phoenix egg.</p>

  <p>The egg was still floating in the center of the enchanted barrier. The surface of the egg was constantly flashing with the Fire Law, as it activated an even stronger flame storm to engulf the entire area.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng wasn't afraid in the slightest bit. Instead, he flew towards the storm of flames and extended his hand towards the phoenix egg. His fingers gently caressed the surface of the egg's hard shell.</p>

  <p>'It's a bit hot to the touch, and I can definitely feel the life pulsating inside it. So this is what a phoenix egg is like. I wonder if dragon eggs are the same?' he thought. Luo Zheng remembered how he still needed to help the cyan dragon obtain the Ancestral Dragon egg after entering the Feather Holy Sea.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>Under Zheng's touch, the surface of the phoenix egg started to crack rapidly. Then, a tiny phoenix shot out from the egg. The phoenix started to grow larger in such a quick speed as it circled around the egg.</p>

  <p>Following the two phoenix cries, the flame storm finally came to a stop.</p>

  <p>The phoenix looked at Luo Zheng with a confused gaze. Its flames were completely ineffective against him.</p>

  <p>The level nine phoenix wasn't too old. Otherwise, it couldn't have been able to agree with Fiona and become her contractual beast. It could only use the third layer of the Fire Law, and as for the fourth layer, it needed to take the form of Nirvana to release it.</p>

  <p>In conclusion, Nirvana was its most powerful move. Originally, it wanted to use the Nirvana Flames to incinerate that rude human.</p>

  <p>However, it now understood that this fellow did not seem to be afraid of fire. What was going on?</p>

  <p>The phoenix, which was still in its infancy, could not figure it out.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Luo Zheng smiled at the phoenix and said, "Thank you!"</p>

  <p>'Why is he thanking me? Wasn't he scolding me just now?' The phoenix grew more confused. In spite of the fact that it was a super legendary beast, it was to maintain a respectful attitude towards Luo Zheng once it was established that he could actually defeat it in a duel.</p>

  <p>Thus, the phoenix let out a long cry and flew out of the enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>"Remove the enchanted barrier and let Fiery Shine come out," Fiona ordered.</p>

  <p>Hearing her words, the warrior at the Soul Sea Realm immediately opened the enchanted barrier. After Fiery Shine left the enchanted barrier, it flew towards its master.</p>

  <p>After Fiona whispered a few words of consolation into its ears, the phoenix's mood seemed to ease up a little. Then, Fiona slowly approached the edge of the enchanted barrier and said to Luo Zheng, "I've lost this battle. You're stronger than I am. There is no denying it."</p>

  <p>When War King Wind took action and brought Fiona away from the enchanted barrier, she had already lost to him.</p>

  <p>Now that she had admitted defeat, Fiona was convinced from the bottom of her heart. She really didn't stand a chance against Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Knowing that she didn't have to face up against Luo Zheng anymore, Fiona suddenly calmed down. She was quite satisfied with how their battle turned out.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded and smiled to her. "You're not so bad yourself."</p>

  <p>"Mm, I know," Fiona joked, but Luo Zheng knew she meant it. After all, she was a force. She knew how strong she was, and so did Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>After making sure no one else was around, Fiona whispered to Luo Zheng, "Let me remind you, that little monster really is powerful. You have to be careful, or he'll kill you."</p>

  <p>In fact, Fiona could also tell that Zheng's ability to defeat her was related to his special talent. It seemed that he wasn't afraid of the flames, but the little monster was a whole new different kind of evil.</p>
