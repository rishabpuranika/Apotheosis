<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>This was the Wing King's first time at the Supreme Pure Realm, so he was mostly just curious and kept silent.</p>

  <p>Pearson, the most knowledgeable among the Eternal Realm Hunters, smiled faintly and echoed challengingly, "There isn't anything magical about the Myriad Pagoda Mountains? You are totally wrong."</p>

  <p>Fuxi frowned slightly. "Then, pray tell me what makes it so magical."</p>

  <p>Pearson pointed at the mountains. "These mountains are the keys."</p>

  <p>"Keys?" The Snake Goddess echoed in confusion.</p>

  <p>Pearson nodded and continued. "The so-called Myriad Pagoda Mountains are actually countless keys arranged together. If you turn the keys in an order within a certain period of time, you will be able to open a passage.</p>

  <p>And a different passage will be opened if you change the order."</p>

  <p>"For example...?"</p>

  <p>Just as the Snake Goddess was about to say something, Pearson cut in, "For example, the passage to the Jade Pure Realm is also controlled by these mountains."</p>

  <p>Everyone's eyes lit up excitedly at his words.</p>

  <p>To them, this had been an ordinary mountain range. Who knew it carried such secrets?</p>

  <p>"But how can these mountains control the passages? Are there magic arrays inside them?" the Snake Goddess pressed inquisitively.</p>

  <p>"We once shattered the soil on the surface of a mountain," Fuxi added, his frown deepening, "and we found a circular array, but it only formed a shield."</p>

  <p>"That shield is used to push over the mountain." Pearson shrugged. "The way to open the passages is to push over the corresponding mountains."</p>

  <p>"But there are so many mountains here. How do we know which ones we should push?" asked Yasamin, brows furrowing.</p>

  <p>Thurston calmly began to explain, "The name Myriad Pagoda Mountains doesn't suggest that there are myriad mountains, but that there are a myriad of ways to permute the mountains. It is really difficult to get the right coordinates. So far, only a few ways have been established, and even then, they're in the hands of the Element Spirit Civilization and the Nihility race."</p>

  <p>Although the Eternal Realm Hunters knew the secrets of the Myriad Pagoda Mountains, they did not know the specific ways to open the passages.</p>

  <p>"Now the Treacherous Being constantly changes its direction. Does it mean that it has a way to open the passage?" the Wing King suddenly interjected.</p>

  <p>When Pearson heard this, he raised his eyebrows. He had been answering the questions of Fuxi and the Snake Goddess, all the while completely glossing over Zheng's situation.</p>

  <p>The Treacherous Being did not devour Zheng. Instead, it used his body to unconsciously run in the Myriad Pagoda Mountains. Was it possible that it was going to open a passage?</p>

  <p>If so...</p>

  <p>"That's possible!" Thurston exclaimed in excitement.</p>

  <p>"Every passage that opens in the Myriad Pagoda Mountains will be extremely valuable. We need to catch up to Zheng," Pearson urged.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>With that, the Wing King spread his wings and transformed into a ray of green light, shooting towards the mountains at lightning speed.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng and the Primeval Lord of Heaven were keeping an eye out for a specific mountain.</p>

  <p>"The fourth mountain, five thousand to the north, and three thousand and one to the west," the Primeval Lord of Heaven reported the location of the last mountain. Then, the Treacherous Being headed northwest.</p>

  <p>When it arrived at the 3001st mountain in the west, the Primeval Lord of Heaven and Zheng thought it would stop and push the mountain to the ground.</p>

  <p>To their surprise, it completely ignored the mountain and continued heading west.</p>

  <p>"Did we miss it?" Zheng asked suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"Impossible." The Primeval Lord of Heaven narrowed his eyes and shook his head. "Why would it miss it?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe you made a mistake," Zheng said slowly.</p>

  <p>"That's impossible," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said firmly.</p>

  <p>"I've told you before that many passages could be opened in the Myriad Pagoda Mountains, and the one we opened might not be the passage to the Jade Pure Realm." The voice of the Snake Goddess suddenly came out from Zheng's inner world.</p>

  <p>The thirty-nine heroes of the human race were trapped in the passage in the seventy-eighth chaotic era.</p>

  <p>The chaos was in its early stages at the time.</p>

  <p>Many of the ruling civilizations had very little understanding of the Three Purities Stage.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven led the human race to wander around in the Supreme Pure Realm. They killed a huge ice snake in the Freezing Wilderness, and took out an ancient picture from the ice snake's body. From this ancient picture, they had obtained the method to open the passage.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps your guess is right." The Primeval Lord of Heaven nodded in agreement.</p>

  <p>In fact, in over a thousand chaotic eras that followed, only six passages had been opened in the Myriad Pagoda Mountains, all of which were in the hands of the Element Spirit Civilization or the Nihility race.</p>

  <p>The situation was different after every mountain was pushed over. Since the Treacherous Being did not push over the mountain as the Primeval Lord of Heaven predicted, it seemed that it had no plans of opening that passage.</p>

  <p>The situation had changed again, and Zheng had no choice but to wait and observe.</p>

  <p>A few minutes later, the Treacherous Being finally chose to knock down the fourth mountain.</p>

  <p>To their surprise, while the fourth mountain toppled down, another mountain, namely the fifth, was knocked down as well.</p>

  <p>After that, the Treacherous Being continued to head to the east. It was obvious that it was going to look for the sixth mountain.</p>

  <p>The easternmost side of the Myriad Pagoda Mountains was connected to the Freezing Wilderness, where the temperature gradually dropped. The mountaintops were covered with a thick layer of snow.</p>

  <p>In a mountain, a group of people in black robes were advancing in a line.</p>

  <p>They resembled normal human beings. They were all clad in special, thick robes, as if they were extremely afraid of the sunlight. Not an inch of skin was exposed.</p>

  <p>"Dad, we've been looking for the eagles for half a month. Will we really find them?" a slightly childish voice whined.</p>

  <p>"I'm sure we will," a calm voice replied. "I'm not worried that we won't find them, but if we can subdue them once we find them. Alas..."</p>

  <p>"Don't worry, chief. Although those eagles are powerful, we are fully prepared this time. We will definitely succeed!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, we are determined to get what we want this time!"</p>

  <p>"We won't fail!"</p>

  <p>Some subordinates pitched in to boost their morale.</p>

  <p>"I hope so," the leader said with a nod.</p>

  <p>This time, their race acted quickly yet quietly, since their lives depended on it.</p>

  <p>They had to succeed.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the group suddenly heard a loud chirp from the distance.</p>

  <p>"Aoo..."</p>

  <p>An eagle with six heads flew across the sky, its shadow dancing on the mountains.</p>

  <p>Hearing the scream of the six-headed eagle, everyone stood vigilantly against the mountain wall.</p>

  <p>Their thick robes changed color automatically, and they melted into the mountain wall, camouflaging into the mountainside perfectly.</p>

  <p>"Follow me!" the leader hissed.</p>

  <p>They moved against the mountain wall nimbly, like wolves stalking their prey. It was not difficult for them to quickly chase after the six-headed eagle along the mountainside.</p>
