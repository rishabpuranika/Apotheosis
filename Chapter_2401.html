<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's failure to enter the Everest Spirit Mountain only further complicated the situation. Harold needed to make another deduction.</p>

  <p>With a sigh, he had Yan reveal everything she had collected down to the smallest detail.</p>

  <p>"The treasure that the consummate True Gods scramble for in the forbidden land must be a supreme treasure of belief."</p>

  <p>"The supreme treasure of belief in the Time Sea? my goodness! The supreme treasure of belief in the second level is already very powerful."</p>

  <p>Both Bryson and Ken were utterly shocked to have gotten the news? Luo Zheng managed to rob the treasure in the forbidden land from the very hands of consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>Even Harold looked surprised. "With Luo Zheng's strength, it's almost impossible for him to grab a treasure from the hands of the consummate True Gods. Perhaps he chanced upon a great opportunity."</p>

  <p>With a noncommittal expression, Yan raised her head and said, "My brother is always the best, of course!"</p>

  <p>Seeing Yan's adorable yet proud face, Bryson smiled. "Okay, it's true. In your eyes, your brother is indeed the best."</p>

  <p>These words made Harold smile too before he sat cross-legged on the ground with his fingers rolling in the air.</p>

  <p>Wisps of gray aura began wreathing around his right hand? it was the Faith Energy triggered by the Evolution Godly Way.</p>

  <p>The prediction of this Godly Way was quite different from the general prediction of fate.</p>

  <p>All sorts of prediction skills hoped to see through mysteries and get right to the truth.</p>

  <p>It was a fairly useful move in most universes as their fate rarely changed so much. The Holy Beings who built the universes would have left some flaws, after all. Sometimes, they even gave out hints deliberately, letting the people infer the truth of the afterlife to some extent.</p>

  <p>But the divine land was much closer than the universes? it was almost impossible to infer its future through a few flaws.</p>

  <p>But the Evolution Godly Way's prediction did not solely rely on the divine land.</p>

  <p>During the prediction, Harold would integrate all the possible changes into the Evolution Godly Way.</p>

  <p>He was to create a temporary world with the help of the Evolution Godly Way. Then, he would step back and watch all the changes unfold in the world until he got the end result.</p>

  <p>For instance, if there was a bird with an egg about to hatch, then out of that egg would surely be a baby bird. Such was the way to presuppose a reason before getting a result.</p>

  <p>When Harold ad Rachelle faced each other in battle, Harold had thought about Rachelle's character, her use of the Murdering Godly Way, and the fact that consummate True Gods could teleport themselves. With that method, he could figure out which direction she might attack.</p>

  <p>When it came to this process, the greater the number of variables and people involved, the more difficult things were to predict.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, Joy, Nicholas, Rachelle, the supreme treasure of belief?"</p>

  <p>As Harold brandished his slender fingers, wisps of gray aura began transforming into certain shapes.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of Yan, Bryson, and Ken, the gray aura seemed to be turning into translucent human shapes.</p>

  <p>"The fairy palace?"</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>In a second, the cloud of gray aura turned into a small fairy palace, one that Bromley built.</p>

  <p>"Augustus."</p>

  <p>"Hallet."</p>

  <p>Hearing Harold's muttering, Ken asked in confusion, "What does it have to do with the two warriors of the Gu Clan?"</p>

  <p>After a moment of thought, Bryson said, "They should have also made their moves by now. They want to control the Swirl Forest, so there's a high chance that they will meet Luo Zheng in the fairy palace!"</p>

  <p>Hiss!</p>

  <p>Turning over his hand, Harold crushed the fairy palace within the aura into nothing. Wearing a faint smile on his face, he continued, "Joy is an outsider. She doesn't know about our plan. As powerful as Augustus is, he has a problem in the head. Only Hallet knows our plan and considering his abilities, it's not too difficult for him to guess what we need to do next. Luo Zheng may go to the Non-combat Zone."</p>

  <p>"But we'll have to wait for two or three years for the debate over the Divine Dao, won't we?" Yan raised her concern, looking discontented.</p>

  <p>"You can't wait any longer?" Harold asked with an amused smile.</p>

  <p>"That will be another few years. I've been waiting for so long," Yan said, the anger in her voice surfacing.</p>

  <p>Even though the time flow rate in the universe was much faster than that in the divine land, Yan had left Luo Zheng while she was in the Central Region.</p>

  <p>The several decades were equal to six years if calculated by divine land's time flow rate.</p>

  <p>"Two years. There are still two years left. We will definitely see him by then," Harold added with a faint smile. "But I'm afraid that Luo Zheng won't have time to comprehend the passage his father left behind."</p>

  <p>"I can do it!" Yan chimed in with a smile. "I will surpass my brother! He doesn't need to attend the debate. I can do it myself!"</p>

  <p>The others smiled and shook their heads seeing Yan's confidence.</p>

  <p>Of course, they didn't doubt her at all? this debate was probably going to be the most wonderful in all of history.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the fairy palace?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, Hallet, and Augustus sat in the side hall, reciting the Truth of Cultivation Nature as written by Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>It was not so easy understanding the Truth of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>With Joy's talent, she could recite 2, 500 words within the first ten days.</p>

  <p>But on the eleventh day, enlightenment suddenly struck her, allowing her to comprehend nearly half of the Truth of Godly Way in the next four days.</p>

  <p>At this point, she knew she couldn't take another step further.</p>

  <p>"To meet the will of the world, to meet the desire of the world?"</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng had managed to recite 2, 700 words of the Truth of Cultivation Nature.</p>

  <p>Hallet and Augustus, of course, were unwilling to lag behind. Within seven days, Hallet recited 3, 000 words, even much faster than Joy did.</p>

  <p>But he was a reasonable enough person to know when to stop? he didn't push himself when exhaustion washed over.</p>

  <p>So occasionally, he would push open the door of the side hall, pull out his fishing rod, and situate himself by the pond, so he could fish in peace. For a few hours, he would sit there, lost in thought.</p>

  <p>As for Augustus...</p>

  <p>Plop!</p>

  <p>Clenching his teeth as he recited in silence, Augustus suddenly fell to the ground and passed out completely.</p>

  <p>"Idiot," Hallet sneered when he took a look at Augustus before going back to reciting.</p>

  <p>Though Augustus' talent was a little higher than Hallet's, he recited without taking any breaks, not knowing when he should've stopped. In just three days, he managed to recite 2, 500 words? an achievement even more stunning than Joy's.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, the Truth of Cultivation Nature had to be comprehended slowly and smoothly. Rushing to quick results never brought any good.</p>

  <p>So after barely making it to 2, 600 words, Augustus reached his limit and fainted.</p>

  <p>But after continuous dizziness, he could clearly utter the Truth of Cultivation Nature word per word, increasing his comprehension speed remarkably. Within a short time, he managed to recite 3, 500 words.</p>

  <p>Witnessing the scene, both Luo Zheng and Hallet were rather surprised.</p>

  <p>"Maybe it's natural for him to do what he pleases." Hallet couldn't help but curl his mouth helplessly? he was used to seeing Augustus in such a state, having known that the latter's talent bested his own.</p>

  <p>"Well, it's easy to merely recite the words," he said with a click of his tongue before continuing to recite.</p>

  <p>And because he took the lead, he showed some disdain for Hallet's and Luo Zheng's progress.</p>

  <p>"What kind of expression are you wearing?" Hallet asked in a querulous voice.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng turned to Augustus' triumphant expression and shook his head helplessly before focusing on his reciting once again.</p>

  <p>But after reciting 2, 800 words, he seemed to have encountered some kind of bottleneck as well. His soul began trembling more and more severely, making it difficult for him to go on.</p>

  <p>"The Truth of Cultivation Nature is a natural understanding. It is not created by the later generations but is a natural existence."</p>

  <p>When he managed to memorize 2, 850 words, an idea suddenly came to his mind.</p>

  <p>At that point, he felt that he had caught an important window of opportunity.</p>

  <p>When the others practiced the Truth of Cultivation Nature, they used their minds. But behind the method, the truth lay in nature's real will? something that could be comprehended by using any means.</p>

  <p>"Something unknown exists before the birth of heaven and earth. It holds no specific shape? its nature is profound and subtle and its voice cannot be heard. I can only blame it on nature." Luo Zheng raised his head as something sparked in his eyes. "I see!"</p>
