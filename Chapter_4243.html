<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Geoffrey leaned against the wall and stared blankly at the "chimney" in the distance.</p>

  <p>The incredible and fascinating adventure was over. Perhaps now he would have to face the God of Death.</p>

  <p>He wasn't prepared for that...</p>

  <p>His mother had told him all sorts of legends of his father since he was a child; he had saved the Cloud Hall, the Central Region, the great world and the universe...</p>

  <p>His father had always been quite fortunate. It all seemed effortless for him, as if all these feats were accomplished with ease.</p>

  <p>Although Yudie had told him of times his father had been trapped in danger and how he had been on the verge of death on countless occasions, what he heard was a stark contrast to what he had experienced himself.</p>

  <p>How could he overcome a dead end that no one else had managed to?</p>

  <p>His father must have been faced with similar predicaments in his time.</p>

  <p>What would he have done? What was he thinking in these situations?</p>

  <p>Geoffrey sat there, still, for a few hours.</p>

  <p>It was getting dark.</p>

  <p>The golden ring atop the Deep Space seemed to be covered with a layer of scales, gradually turning from golden to a deep black. As night fell, the slightly bright light shone on the chimney. From afar, it appeared almost as a giant beast, ready to devour the people.</p>

  <p>Inside the oval building, Elder Xue spoke in the language of the Elemental race.</p>

  <p>The creatures in the Deep Space communicated with very unique sounds; unlike the rhythmic sounds of the creatures of the main world, they let out faint squeaks and crackles, like a group of crickets chirping in a low voice.</p>

  <p>Elder Xue was teaching the Elemental race. They still needed to acquire more knowledge in order to successfully handle the test in the chimney.</p>

  <p>These members of the Elemental race were clear about what lay ahead for them. They knew that if they wanted any chance of passing the test, they would have to absorb as much information that might be useful as they could.</p>

  <p>Their race used to be quite primitive. They were once unable to pass even the initial tests, let alone occupy a place in this huge square. The golden light annihilated them when they had been captured by the spiders and brought to the underground space.</p>

  <p>As the night stretched on, the black scales on the golden ring became thicker and thicker, and all other surroundings turned pitch black.</p>

  <p>Elder Xue reached out and gently scratched the wall. A circular flame slowly appeared, revealing those inside and outside the room.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey then stood up and walked in.</p>

  <p>"Have you decided?" Elder Xue asked casually.</p>

  <p>"Why would such a chimney appear here? Why do they need to select an intelligent creature?" asked Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>"Good question," replied Elder Xue with pride. "Although the Fostering race was destroyed, before their elimination, they concocted this. It's really quite something to behold."</p>

  <p>The Cinnabar race and the Fostering race had perished together and had left this precious inheritance before their demise in order to select an intelligent creature to resurrect the civilization of the Deep Space.</p>

  <p>It was a generous and kind race that cared for the well beings of others.</p>

  <p>They might not have existed anymore, but they hoped the civilization of the Deep Space would be passed on and continue in some way.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey exhaled heavily upon hearing Elder Xue's words and said, "I've made up my mind. I'll go! Can you teach me what I need to do?"</p>

  <p>His decision did not surprise Elder Xue, as it was almost inevitable that he would make this choice.</p>

  <p>"Do not worry," Elder Xue said, patting on the ground beside him as a gesture for Geoffrey to sit down. He then pointed at the chimney and said,</p>

  <p>"Something has puzzled me all these years. If the Fostering race wished to select a successor, why would they arrange such a difficult test which is so difficult that no one could pass it?"</p>

  <p>"Why would they?" Geoffrey was just as puzzled.</p>

  <p>"It is because rebuilding the Deep Space is not something any ordinary creature of the Deep Space can do. Most of the world has collapsed and is filled with the fourth-grade space," Elder Xue spoke with an air of wisdom beyond most. "They need to choose a being capable of controlling it. Those of the Elemental race can only use the ability of Energy Condensation Extreme Form; this is not enough for what they require. Other creatures of the Deep Space face a similar issue."</p>

  <p>Geoffrey blinked his eyes as he began to realize something. "But I don't have any ability at all..."</p>

  <p>Geoffrey only possessed the Godly Way power of the chaos. This was not even that useful in the third-grade world, not to mention in the fifth-grade and fourth-grade worlds.</p>

  <p>"You have the ability to travel through multiple worlds," Elder Xue said with a mischievous grin. "Your ability to travel through different worlds is magnificent!"</p>

  <p>"Elder Xue, do you mean the space in the chimney is a higher-level world?" Geoffrey's eyes lit up.</p>

  <p>"I do not know," answered Elder Xue.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey did not understand how that was possible. "Elder Xue, you've said you have been in the Deep Space for a long time. Do you really not know?"</p>

  <p>"I have never entered the chimney myself and no living being has returned alive after going in. All I can do is to study the information left behind by the Fostering race. What I am sure of is that the test is very special and related to intelligence, ability and vision. But I do not know the exact content of the test," answered the Elder Xue, shaking his head in disappointment.</p>

  <p>"So you do not intend to enter it on your own?" Geoffrey pressed.</p>

  <p>Elder Xue acted as a teacher to the Elemental race, and it did not make sense that he did not know what was in the chimney considering he taught them about it.</p>

  <p>"Of course I want to," he responded frankly. "It was by mere coincidence that I merged with this body of a member of the Elemental race. I did not have the opportunity to fuse with the second body. Once I am dead, there would be no hope left, and so I have been hesitant and waiting patiently...</p>

  <p>But I had not expected to see you here," Elder Xue announced joyfully.</p>

  <p>"So this time, I will go with you!"</p>

  <p>"You still have a physical body on the outside. But if I die, I'm dead for good," Geoffrey pointed out. He still felt it was unfair.</p>

  <p>Elder Xue smiled faintly. "How about I let another physical body commit suicide, right now?"</p>

  <p>He had not been afraid of death for a long time, and now through Geoffrey, he understood the situation of the Four Spirits Sect better. It was inevitable that he risked everything.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey was taken aback by his determination. He suddenly felt that he shouldn't care too much for narrow personal gains and losses.</p>

  <p>"When will we make our way in?" Geoffrey asked.</p>

  <p>"We will wait for the right opportunity," replied Elder Xue.</p>

  <p>Over the next three days, Elder Xue imparted his knowledge to Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>Although Elder Xue had only deduced the information and experiences, they had been tested by the members of the Elemental race one by one, through practice.</p>

  <p>These people were only able to rise five feet in the chimney when he had first led them here. Now, even the weakest of performers could climb seventy to eighty feet high. And the most outstanding of them could make it all the way up to one hundred and sixty feet.</p>

  <p>This proved that what Elder Xue knew was valuable and effective.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey understood the gravity of their undertaking and had listened intently to Elder Xue's introduction the last few days.</p>

  <p>Three days later, some of the Deep Space races appeared on the huge square. They walked along the green lines and headed straight towards the giant chimney.</p>
