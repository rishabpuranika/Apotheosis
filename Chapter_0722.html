  <p>
</p>

  <p>The soul-killing poisoned blood was one of Bloodwood Cliff's secret methods. It was a frighteningly powerful skill that could push a cultivator's potential to the extreme, however, it had one crucial side-effect that it could cause the user great harm.</p>

  <p>Unless one's life was an inch from death, the soul-killing poisoned blood skill was not something a sane person would ever think of using.</p>

  <p>However, it was a risk Brody had to take. Taking Zheng down was a task given to him by his leader, and failure was not an option. He only hoped that his leader would give him a reward that would help him reach a higher refining level.</p>

  <p>After being planted the blood symbol, Brody's eyes burned with a blood thirst as he stared up at Zheng. When the curtain of light flickered and disappeared, hot, scarlet flames burst forth from his hand.</p>

  <p>"I have gained understanding and comprehension of one-third of the Fire Law. If you've got any brains, you know it would be better for you to just stand still as I burn you to ashes with my blood flames…" As soon as he finished talking, the blood flame in his hand soared menacingly, eager to kill, eager to burn.</p>

  <p>"Fire Law! I can't believe it. Brody actually mastered the Fire Law! What in the world is going on with this year's Martial Arts Contest? Law Power is not at all easy to learn. It is extremely difficult and complicated. How come all cultivators of the Internal Elixir Realm seem to have grasped it?"</p>

  <p>"Don't be so overly dramatic. Brody is one of the top disciples of Bloodwood Cliff after all. He's definitely qualified to be one of the people that can comprehend Law Power. But, to be honest, I'm still quite surprised by the strength of the contestants for this year's contest. So many of them have already comprehended Law Power. In the past, only the top three could accomplish such a feat…."</p>

  <p>"What are you talking about? Back then, only the strongest cultivators of the Virtual Tribulation Realm could master Law Power. It's amazing how so many talented cultivators suddenly showed up all of a sudden."</p>

  <p>"Blood flame? You want to burn me?" The scarlet flame burned bright, but it did not faze Zheng one bit. Smiling, as if to mock his opponent, he waved his hand and a wisp of pure fire appeared over his palm. He pointed at the flame, and in the next second, it formed a protective circle of fire around him. "Fight fire with fire," he said. "Since you want to attack me with your flames, I shall do the same to you."</p>

  <p>"W- What? I thought Zheng was only a body refiner? What the heck is going on?! His flame looks weak…</p>

  <p>But why do I feel so overwhelmed with its power?"</p>

  <p>"Oh my gosh! That's the complete Fire Law!" someone suddenly exclaimed in shock.</p>

  <p>"You're right! But how did he do it? That's impressive!"</p>

  <p>Another round of heated discussion broke out among the spectators.</p>

  <p>Hobbes, one of the three chiefs of the World Commercial Alliance rose from his seat. He narrowed his eyes at the pure flame that fiercely burned over Zheng's palm.</p>

  <p>The chief was a practitioner of fire-system techniques and had almost comprehended the first layer of Fire Law- Raging Fire and mastered 30% of its second layer- Ashes. However, since there wasn't a complete Raging Fire in the Central Region, he wasn't able to finish the first layer.</p>

  <p>Looking at the intense, pure flame over Zheng's palm, Hobbes realized that the lad had somehow fully mastered Raging Fire.</p>

  <p>'How did he do it?' he wondered to himself.</p>

  <p>Hobbes turned to Dillon. "Didn't you say that he was a runic expert?" he asked abruptly. "How did his comprehension of the Fire Law reach this degree?"</p>

  <p>Dillon did not answer and could only stare blankly at the flame burning in Zheng's hand, equally flabbergasted.</p>

  <p>Upon the platform wherein the people of the Ethereal Spirit Sect were seated, Brent stared in fixation at Zheng's flame. He curled his lips, and turned to Philip and said, "He's even way stronger than you said! That's the perfect power of the Fire Law!"</p>

  <p>Brent's words caused Philip to turn away from embarrassment and quickly change the topic. "So what?! Compared to Fire Law, isn't the Space Law you refine more powerful and difficult to master?"</p>

  <p>'Philip is right. Time Law and Space Law are considered the most powerful.</p>

  <p>However, only a few talented cultivators can master the complete Fire Law and Zheng is one of them. He has truly underestimated him, ' Brent brooded.</p>

  <p>"The complete Law of Fire. This young man is truly interesting. I feel like I've seen him before," Eddie murmured. He had ranked number one in the Central Region and had not paid much attention to Zheng since he had been more interested in the supposedly stronger warriors.</p>

  <p>Marilyn remained silent but his son was quick to dismiss his thoughts as he said, "Dad, you haven't set foot in the Central Region for years. You must've mistaken him for someone else."</p>

  <p>However, Eddie disagreed and shook his head, "No, I've met him once. I'm certain of it. I just don't remember where."</p>

  <p>And he was right. Back in the Cloud Sect, his huge face had sneered at Zheng.</p>

  <p>It wasn't really surprising that he forgot though, seeing that he had only met him once. At that time, Zheng was an unremarkable nobody to Eddie so there was no reason for him to remember him.</p>

  <p>"I would've never thought that the Cloud Hall would be able to cultivate such a genius. He not only reached the Illuminating Soul Realm but also comprehended the first layer of Fire Law. And he is a body refiner too.</p>

  <p>Eden, it looks like you should cultivate harder!"</p>

  <p>Eddie said with a composed and confident smile. He obviously did not consider Zheng to be strong enough as his son's opponent.</p>

  <p>Eden was his son.</p>

  <p>Hearing his father's words, Eden nodded. The confidence shining on his face, he declared firmly, "Don't worry Dad. I won't disappoint you."</p>

  <p>"Is that so?" Eddie asked, looking at his son.</p>

  <p>Eden nodded his head. "Of course! You invested a lot in me. If I fail to stand out in the contest, I'll be a laughingstock. Just wait and see. I'll defeat all these so-called geniuses!" he declared with certainty.</p>

  <p>His son's words were haughty but Eddie nodded his head approvingly. 'He is my son. I have complete faith in him. He is surely more powerful than the other contestants, ' he thought to himself, pride swelling in his chest.</p>

  <p>When she saw Zheng's display of the Fire Law, Yudie's eyes widened in astonishment.</p>

  <p>It was then that she realized that she truly knew nothing about her disciple.</p>

  <p>When they first met, she had been impressed by his display of great talent during the Cloud Road test. Ever since then, she had the gut feeling that Zheng would rise to be a key figure in the Cloud Hall which was why she spent so much time and energy cultivating him.</p>

  <p>It came as a surprise to her when Zheng later started to study runes. She fondly remembered how the chief runic expert marveled at his strength and claimed that Zheng was even better at runes than him. Then, when Zheng returned from the Dragon Soar Arena, she found out that he had actually comprehended the Space Law.</p>

  <p>Now, during the Martial Arts Contest, he had just showcased the body refining technique he was good at. She didn't have any idea that he had actually started learning the Fire Law.</p>

  <p>Even more surprising was that he had actually completed and comprehended the first layer of Fire Law!</p>

  <p>As far as she knew, there was no intact introduction to Raging Fire in the Central Region which was the primary reason why Hobbes of the World Commercial Alliance couldn't fully grasp the first layer of Fire Law.</p>
