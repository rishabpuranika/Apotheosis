  <p>
</p>

  <p>Standing not too far away was Yilia, looking at Zheng mischievously.</p>

  <p>Countless raindrops were gathering in the space. They transformed into short swords and shot towards Zheng, making the water ball surrounding him grow bigger and bigger.</p>

  <p>For a while, she looked Zheng up and down before suddenly lowering her head and saying, "Come to think of it, it's meaningless for me to defeat you."</p>

  <p>Her voice seemed obscure over the thick layer of water. Zheng was puzzled, wondering what she really meant.</p>

  <p>She walked toward the water ball slowly and tapped its surface with her finger, triggering a small whirlpool to appear on its surface. It continued spinning until it formed a fist-sized hollow passageway, directly penetrating to Zheng's head. She had brilliantly mastered the control of water.</p>

  <p>"The divine land is rather boring. It's not easy to find a warrior who has won twenty-two consecutive times. It's quite a pity that you will lose to me," said Yilia as she smiled at the passageway.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure you can defeat me?" Zheng asked in return.</p>

  <p>Though he couldn't speak in the water, because his head was in the passageway, he could still make a sound.</p>

  <p>In spite of him being restrained by the water, it was impossible for her to use it to kill him. 'She's not going to drown me, is she?'</p>

  <p>With a confident smile, she replied, "Since I managed to trap you, naturally, I have the ability to kill you as well. So tell me, do you want to defeat me?"</p>

  <p>"What's the point? So what if I say I want to defeat you?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Well then… Tell me your real identity and which clan you come from, will you?" With her hands clasped behind her back, she continued with a smile, "If you can tell me the truth, it won't be impossible for me to admit defeat."</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Zheng put on a strange expression.</p>

  <p>What were those disciples from the divine land thinking about all day?</p>

  <p>This Yilia seemed completely normal. Why would she make such a strange request?</p>

  <p>"Don't you care about the points?" Zheng asked again.</p>

  <p>"Points? Of course I care," she smiled. "If I defeat you, I'll get a lot of points. Even my brother will think highly of me. But what's the use?</p>

  <p>There's no point in moving our Floating Island one place up."</p>

  <p>Yilia's brother, Shahn Fang, was the one who won two consecutive victories in the open battles. This time, the Fang Clan had risen rapidly— it had been estimated that the Fang Clan, ranked sixth in the past, might reach the fifth or fourth place this time.</p>

  <p>"Think about this carefully. An anonymous man appeared out of nowhere. I think it will be more interesting to let you remain undefeated." Yilia's face was filled with loneliness as she said, "This divine land is so boring."</p>

  <p>The highest level of creatures' pursuit was the eternity.</p>

  <p>From the mortals in the universes to the powerful warriors of the Soul Sea Realm, and to the Supreme Lords, they all pursued a longer life span to get rid of the control of time.</p>

  <p>But whether it was the Supreme Lord who had a lifespan of over a hundred million years or the mortal who had a lifespan of about 60 to 70 years, none of them could resist time which would kill them all one day.</p>

  <p>Time was people's greatest enemy.</p>

  <p>But everything was different in the divine land.</p>

  <p>The divine citizens' lifespans were by no means short. Once they proved a Godly Way, their lives were to be sublimated from 'finite' to 'infinite, ' and they would complete the ultimate pursuit of all living beings.</p>

  <p>But many creatures lost their targets after this pursuit was fulfilled.</p>

  <p>Because Zheng had traveled from the Vast Sky Region to the Floating Island in a very short period of time, he hadn't seen the negative side of the divine land.</p>

  <p>In fact, there was a portion of the True Gods in the divine land who quickly sank into depression. They could make their own worlds and experience a variety of things in their own worlds, and everything could be easily possessed.</p>

  <p>One divine era passed as such, just as the next divine eras did, the next one hundred did, the next one thousand, and the next ten thousand. Time was meaningless to the True Gods.</p>

  <p>Only then did some of them realize that it was not such a wonderful thing to have an eternal life. Many True Gods even ended their lives after quietly expending two or three divine eras.</p>

  <p>Of course, more True Gods were still climbing to the peak of the Godly Ways, hoping to reach the consummation of True God Realm. Once they became Holy Beings, they would build Floating Islands, and supported their clans above the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>As for the disciples born in the wealthy clans like Yilia, she had a brother who loved her very much. In her eyes, the countless divine eras and the invariable divine land were too boring, so she was much more interested in anything that could surprise her.</p>

  <p>And the anonymous man in front of her with twenty-two consecutive wins was very interesting. It was truly exciting when he challenged her.</p>

  <p>Though she was well prepared as she intended to take points from him, she had changed her mind.</p>

  <p>"Sorry, I can't tell you," Zheng said as he shook his head. It was normal for others to have some strange ideas, but Zheng had no reason nor time to play with them.</p>

  <p>Disappointment appeared on Yilia's face, but she still said, "I promise I won't tell anyone else…"</p>

  <p>Zheng interrupted her, "No, it's impossible." It was a matter of life and death. How could Zheng believe a stranger's guarantee, even though he thought Yilia was likely to be a faithful kind of person.</p>

  <p>"Then I'm left with no choice but to kill you," Yilia threatened as she raised her brows.</p>

  <p>Seeing her serious expression, Zheng laughed and slowly raised his hand.</p>

  <p>Pointing his palm at Yilia, he said, "You seem to have made a mistake.</p>

  <p>Do you really think you can defeat me by trapping me in water?"</p>

  <p>"According to what Moore said, I think I can," Yilia returned carefully.</p>

  <p>"What an innocent girl..." Zheng sighed.</p>

  <p>Having grown up in the best possible environment, these disciples on the Floating Islands seldom fell into the jungle of deception. When they could rely on their own real strength to suppress their opponents, such tricks of deception were truly useless to them.</p>

  <p>As soon as his voice fell, an invisible force appeared before Zheng's palm.</p>

  <p>It made the water disperse quickly as a sword slowly condensed.</p>

  <p>But Yilia didn't take it too seriously. She merely thought that Zheng had just taken out an ordinary magic weapon and sighed, "Well then, I can only do it now."</p>

  <p>Yilia suddenly waved her hand and the huge water ball wrapped with Zheng twisted. Black water drops were constantly formed on the surface of the huge water ball until they turned into four dark turbid currents, slowly surging in the water ball, like four rapidly wriggling poisonous worms crawling toward Zheng.</p>

  <p>The Five Elements Godly Way contained the five most common laws.</p>

  <p>Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth all had their own Godly Ways, such as the Elementary Fire Godly Way, and the Parting Water Godly Way that Yilia cultivated.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of many True Gods outside of the Time Sea, the Parting Water Godly Way wasn't particularly powerful— at the very least, it was good for assisting others, and its own power was considered to be inferior.</p>

  <p>In fact, when one reached a certain level of the Parting Water Godly Way, they could cultivate several powerful theurgies. For instance, the 'Devouring Spirit Turbid Current' Yilia displayed now. It worked well in the face of extremely solid things. The stronger Zheng's body was, the greater the power of the Devouring Spirit Turbid Current would be.</p>

  <p>Noticing that four black turbid currents were slowly moving towards him, Zheng also felt a sense of danger. In a moment, traces of the internal momentum of the Emotion Closing Godly Way popped into his mind.</p>

  <p>After constant trials, Zheng became quite proficient in activating the Infinity Ruler by the internal momentum of the Emotion Closing Godly Way and removing all the internal momentum the next second.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>Then, two golden rings appeared in his eyes.</p>

  <p>... 'If the Parting Water Godly Way is cultivated to the extreme, it will be truly powerful.</p>

  <p>The Devouring Spirit Turbid Current is actually a type of corrosive water. Even the supreme primordial weapon will melt…'</p>

  <p>When Zheng's eyes instantly saw through the internal momentum within the Godly Way, he was left to unscramble it in his mind.</p>

  <p>Noticing Devouring Spirit Turbid Current's remarkable power, Zheng didn't hesitate at all.</p>

  <p>The Nine Divine Stars within his inner world began revolving rapidly until an invisible force gushed out. The sword handle seemed to be a Maitreya Buddha with the sword's middle part as wide as a wheel.</p>

  <p>It was the Buddha Emperor Sword…</p>

  <p>The killing sword in the Gods Killing Sword Array.</p>

  <p>It didn't take Zheng four swords to kill Yilia. So now, Zheng took out this one sword.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Since Zheng controlled only one single sword, he didn't need to activate the Purple Aura Godly Way. As soon as he made a thought, the Buddha Emperor Sword broke through the water rapidly and shot toward Yilia.</p>

  <p>The Buddha Emperor Sword was created by Power Shaping, and the Parting Water caused it no hindrance at all.</p>

  <p>"This sword..."</p>

  <p>At this moment, Yilia's eyes were filled with surprise.</p>

  <p>"Parting Water Divine Mirror!"</p>

  <p>Realizing that things weren't going well, Yilia clapped her hands, creating a piece of water mirror. The Parting Water Divine Mirror was also a powerful theurgy. The Parting Water could transform into anything, and the Parting Water Divine Mirror could clone anything reflected onto it rapidly and shoot it back.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>An identical Buddha Emperor Sword shot out from the Parting Water Divine Mirror.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Two Buddha Emperor Swords collided in the air, both falling apart in an instant.</p>

  <p>But Yilia's power was limited after all. It was impossible for the Parting Water Divine Mirror to perfectly copy the theurgy of her opponent. After the sword dissipated, it disappeared while Zheng's Buddha Emperor Sword once again took shape.</p>

  <p>With a clang, the Buddha Emperor Sword was smashed into Yilia's mirror. It was already pressed against her white neck and then it pierced right into her. Blood slowly flowed along the invisible sword, converging on the wheel in the middle of the sword, forming the word, 'kill.'</p>
