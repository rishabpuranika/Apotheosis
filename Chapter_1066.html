<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The moment the martial artists who were at the Virtual Tribulation Realm entered the red circle, they quickly charged towards its center.</p>

  <p>This red circle was only a few hundred feet in diameter, and a martial artist who was at the Virtual Tribulation Realm would be able to cross it in just one step. From the beginning, it was clear that every martial artist who entered tried their best to occupy the advantageous center spot in order to prevent others from pushing them out.</p>

  <p>"Get away! This is my place!" A warrior who was as robust as a gorilla roared to the others.</p>

  <p>This warrior was the first one who was able to get to the center point of the red circle. He stood there firmly while the warriors beside him glared at him ferociously, hatred and jealousy evident in their eyes. Despite that, the warrior stood sturdily in his place, his chin up. He was at the peak-level of the late stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm -- his temples were bulging, giving off a heavy aura, as if what he had practiced was an extremely aggressive cultivation technique. Because of that, no one dared to fight him for the central position.</p>

  <p>Just when the thirty of them had chosen their positions, a master at the Soul Sea Realm came into view and announced, "Now the first round... begin!"</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…</p>

  <p>As soon as the Soul Sea Realm master gave the pronouncement, the life vitality of every warriors suddenly exploded all at the same time!</p>

  <p>Upon seeing this scene, Zheng furrowed his eyebrows, and a strange look came over his face. He was confused and worried.</p>

  <p>The reason for that was because the power of the life vitality that erupted from those warriors was restricted inside the red circle!</p>

  <p>But after seeing that the other several hundred warriors didn't seem to be perturbed by what was happening, Zheng felt relieved. For so many years, the divine kingdoms developed and honed their powers. Now, they were certainly more developed than the Central Region. Zheng only felt strange about what was happening because it was his first time witnessing such a thing.</p>

  <p>'If a martial artist at the Virtual Tribulation Realm were to use his or her strength in its entirety, what kind of place would be able to withstand such destructive force?' he thought, amazed by the whole thing.</p>

  <p>If the thirty warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm fought each other with all their might, the Jade Martial House would surely be destroyed, let alone this plaza.</p>

  <p>But upon closer inspection, Zheng found that the floor had been embedded with all kinds of patterns. Together with the red circle, they worked to prevent the warriors and their immense power from damaging the place.</p>

  <p>As Zheng pondered over the magic that was holding the place together, the martial artists within the red circle had already begun to fight fiercely.</p>

  <p>The rule of this competition was very simple: step out of the red circle, then one was out. The last few ones who would be standing inside the fight area would be declared the winners.</p>

  <p>"Haha! That arrogant warrior in the middle would get ganged up on by the other warriors!" Zheng said as he started cackling.</p>

  <p>Although he said it in a very hushed voice, several martial artists at the Virtual Tribulation Realm heard him. Slowly they turned their gazes at him, disdain on their faces.</p>

  <p>What Zheng didn't know was that the sturdy warrior had the same exact background as him. He was also a famous independent warrior who had cultivated both his body and his life vitality. Moreover, the cultivation methods he had practiced were very powerful.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of many warriors, this warrior would undoubtedly be the one who would get a Harlen Token.</p>

  <p>Because of that, when they heard Zheng's comments about him, they immediately felt that Zheng was too ill-informed and considered him as an ignorant prick.</p>

  <p>A few moments after Zheng made his comment, action started happening inside the red circle.</p>

  <p>Inside it, as if on cue, nearly half of the thirty warriors went straight for the guy at the center. All of them looked like they were ready to kill him.</p>

  <p>No matter how powerful this burly martial artist was, how would he be able to take on a dozen Virtual Tribulation Realm martial artists all by himself?</p>

  <p>The red circle was so small that the distance between warriors was only about half a step. The guy would not have anywhere to hide, and he would just have to face the attacks head on!</p>

  <p>The warrior's face changed drastically at the moment he noticed that everyone was coming for him. He let out an explosive shout as he revolved his forceful energy and forcefully countered the attacks from more than half of the contestants in this round.</p>

  <p>"Ha!"</p>

  <p>"Bam!"</p>

  <p>The difference in power between the two sides was evident, and it was enormous.</p>

  <p>After a brief moment of chaos, the warrior who had been at the center of the circle was pushed out of the fighting area.</p>

  <p>"Puff! Puff! Puff!..."</p>

  <p>Breathing heavily, he spat out a mouthful of blood on the ground and glared at the people who had launched attacks on him.</p>

  <p>Less than a few seconds into the round, the most promising warrior had already been knocked out. It undoubtedly surprised many spectators who were expecting him to win the whole thing.</p>

  <p>The three powerful warriors of the Soul Sea Realm looked at each other, a faint smile gracing their lips. The three of them seemed to have expected this to happen as well.</p>

  <p>The warriors who had mocked Zheng and his comment earlier glanced back at him with a shame in their eyes. Their unwavering confidence a while back was replaced with shame and doubts. 'This fellow seemed to really have insightful observations, ' they all thought.</p>

  <p>Amongst all the warriors present, the only ones who had predicted this to happen were the three mighty warriors of the Soul Sea Realm, and Zheng.</p>

  <p>Aside from being strong, another thing that would help a warrior win this whole thing was wisdom. It might go unsaid, but it was the most important rule of the fight.</p>
