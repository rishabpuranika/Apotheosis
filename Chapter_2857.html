<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>In less than four hours after Clark came back to life, Zeke returned to the Fang Clan's Floating Island.</p>

  <p>He learned about everything in quite the same way as Clark, but Zeke was a very cautious fellow. He wasn't as angry as Clark. Instead, he dug deeper to find more information about the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>As the Holy Beings had died around the same time, the time it took for them to be revived would differ, but it wouldn't make too much of a difference.</p>

  <p>Over the next two days, the Holy Beings were revived one after another.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings had gathered on the Floating Island of the Mu Clan as they were summoned by Murphy.</p>

  <p>"What? Are you saying that Samuel is actually Gregorio?" Clark's eyes widened once more.</p>

  <p>Murphy nodded and said, "You were already dead when it happened, so you didn't see it."</p>

  <p>Zeke, who was next to him, added, "His spear was so powerful that it could destroy the space suppression of the forbidden area. He had an advantage in the forbidden area. We could do nothing to him..."</p>

  <p>The only one who was able to stop Samuel at that time was Rosie's clone.</p>

  <p>"Exactly how powerful is he?" Clark asked again, unable to fathom the recent developments.</p>

  <p>Murphy thought about this for a while, and said, "Let me put it this way: he's a little stronger than us and slightly weaker than Nicholas."</p>

  <p>However, the term "slightly weaker" was only applicable when Nicholas had not performed the Dark Light World Transformation. Once Nicholas sacrificed himself to perform the technique, he was so much stronger than all the other Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>"If Samuel is only a little stronger, how did he dare to plunder the Floating Island of Dongfang Clan?" Clark sneered.</p>

  <p>Jeremiah who was next to him chuckled as well. "It is said that Samuel even imitated Nicholas and gathered Holy Beings in the Hall of Holy Beings to form a new alliance of powerful clans. But his plan was ridiculed by some Holy Beings like Woodruff..."</p>

  <p>"Hahaha!"</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings of the alliance of the powerful clans suddenly burst into uncontrollable laughter.</p>

  <p>They were well aware of the Holy Beings' way of operating. Samuel had made a naive move. After all, it was very difficult to start a universe war.</p>

  <p>Murphy, who had done this once before, was certain of this fact.</p>

  <p>"Samuel is back and Nicholas is dead, so was it him who captured the two girls in the end?" Murphy assumed.</p>

  <p>After all, none of the Holy Beings present had survived, and they were not clear about who eventually took control of the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>"So what?" Clark sneered and said, "This is not the Abyss Demon Region and the Space Law is not prohibited here. Do you think we are afraid of him? Hah! What a joke!"</p>

  <p>"Clark is absolutely right! We should avenge Holy Nicholas' death!"</p>

  <p>Jeremiah advised calmly.</p>

  <p>"If there is no other option, we will start a universe war!" another Holy Being chimed in enthusiastically.</p>

  <p>It appeared that these Holy Beings were disgruntled on Nicholas's behalf, but in fact, they had selfish motives.</p>

  <p>If everyone joined hands and succeeded in killing Samuel, they would be able to get the two girls and control the Abyss Demon Region. Once anyone gained control of the Abyss Demon Region, they would naturally replace Nicholas and become the new leader of the alliance of powerful clans. It was enough motivation for any ambitious warrior.</p>

  <p>Once everyone agreed to this plan, all the Holy Beings moved in a flash and appeared in the air above the Floating Island of the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings hovered in the air together, emitting a strong aura, which immediately alerted the disciples of the Han Clan of their arrival.</p>

  <p>"So many Holy Beings have come to our island..."</p>

  <p>"These are the Holy Beings from the alliance of powerful clans! Gosh! Our clan is going to be in big trouble!"</p>

  <p>"They are surely here to avenge the Dongfang Clan!"</p>

  <p>The disciples of the Han Clan were in a state of panic. Their Floating Island was not very big. If the Holy Beings made a move, there was literally no place for them to hide!</p>

  <p>"Come out, Samuel!"</p>

  <p>Clark was the first to roar at the Han Clan's Floating Island.</p>

  <p>The other Holy Beings didn't speak, but released their auras silently. They were determined to flush out Samuel from wherever he was hiding!</p>

  <p>After a short while, a space fluctuation appeared at the bottom of the Floating Island and Samuel and Pascal stepped out of the space channel.</p>

  <p>Samuel looked at Clark, who was up in the air, and asked with a mocking smile, "Hello, Clark! Why are you so angry today?"</p>

  <p>Flames began to glow on Clark's body and his robust body emitted a scorching aura. The disciples of the Han Clan felt as if summer had arrived early and soon all of them were drenched in sweat. Clark replied, "Nicholas is dead and you dared to plunder the Floating Island of the Dongfang Clan, so you are our enemy!"</p>

  <p>Jeremiah, Murphy and other Holy Beings also took out their weapons and were ready for combat.</p>

  <p>Their plan was to kill Samuel first and then start a universe war.</p>

  <p>In the Abyss Demon Region, these Holy Beings did not have the Spear of Supreme Harmony, so they couldn't do any harm to Samuel.</p>

  <p>But here in the divine land, the situation was different.</p>

  <p>"You want to fight?" Samuel smirked as he narrowed his eyes. "Well, I'll show you what kind of power I have."</p>

  <p>Next to him, Pascal lifted his right hand gently, and streams of black energy began to flow around him.</p>

  <p>Samuel had also been pondering about the use of the ring recently.</p>

  <p>The Swirl Forest, Everest Spirit Mountain, Soul Wilderness and the Abyss Demon Region were called the four great forbidden lands, but of these, the Abyss Demon Region was ranked first.</p>

  <p>Rumor had it that anyone who controlled the energy of Abyss Demon Region would have the ability to destroy the divine land.</p>

  <p>Samuel had been contemplating these days. He thought that the reason why those Holy Beings did not respect or fear him was because the strength he displayed was not superior enough.</p>

  <p>When the black energy flowed around Pascal, the light gradually dimmed in the entire divine land.</p>

  <p>"What's happening? The sun... The sun is getting diminished!"</p>

  <p>"It's just morning. Why has it become so dark?"</p>

  <p>"What the hell! I've been in the divine land for so many years, and I've never seen anything like this before."</p>

  <p>The seasons changed as per their schedule and day and night alterations in the divine land were extremely stable. There was almost no deviation ever.</p>

  <p>But today, a strange phenomenon was taking place, which caused the entire divine land to fall into darkness. This event raised many speculations among the divine citizens.</p>

  <p>Pascal lifted his right hand and slowly floated off the ground with his father.</p>

  <p>The black energy circling Pascal's body now emitted an even more terrifying aura.</p>

  <p>This aura suppressed Clark's flames. The bright flames became as dim as a weak candle flame. It was almost unnoticeable now.</p>

  <p>"What kind of power is this?" Clark's face turned pale.</p>

  <p>Murphy's eyelids twitched. Maybe his guess was right. Maybe the Abyss Demon Region really fell into Samuel's hands. In that case, Zheng and Tianming might be dead. Could it be true?</p>

  <p>The tension between the two sides was growing and a battle was about to erupt. At this time, a faint figure quietly appeared behind Samuel.</p>

  <p>"We are in the same boat. So why do we have to fight it out? Stop it, Samuel!"</p>

  <p>As the voice rang out, an old man appeared in the air.</p>

  <p>"Master Hamish!"</p>

  <p>"Look! Master Hamish is here!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's Master Hamish!"</p>

  <p>When Murphy and the rest saw Hamish, their eyes lit up.</p>

  <p>As members of the alliance of powerful clans on the Floating Islands, these Holy Beings were, of course, well aware that Hamish was the real sponsor of the alliance.</p>

  <p>Samuel's eyes narrowed slightly and the murderous look in his eyes disappeared. Pascal also covered the ring with his fingers, bringing all activity to a halt.</p>

  <p>The dark skies quickly brightened again, and dazzling sunshine flooded the entire divine land once more.</p>
