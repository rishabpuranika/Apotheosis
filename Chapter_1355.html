<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1355 We'll Give It To You </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>In the hall on the highest floor of the Mist Palace, sat an old man wearing a long black robe. Next to him was a young woman wearing a cyan dress.</p>

  <p>The girl was very young. She was only twenty years old? two years younger than Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"I happened to drop by this world, so I thought I would visit you. By the way, I want you to do me a favor," the old man said slowly.</p>

  <p>Yolande, who was sitting on the side, was extremely respectful to the old man as she replied with a smile, "Master Xiao, please tell me. I'll do my best to meet your demand." As she spoke, she sized up the girl beside the old man and continued, "Could it be that you want to let this girl cultivate in our Mist Palace?"</p>

  <p>The reason Yolande was being so respectful to the old man was that he was one of the previous leaders of the Mist Palace and also the previous owner of the Thunder Wind Divine Sword. His name was Kyron Xiao.</p>

  <p>He was truly outstanding. It was rumored that he was planning to make a breakthrough to become a Supreme Lord. He was considered a popular character in the alliance.</p>

  <p>Kyron Xiao shook his head, before saying, "I had hosted the Mist Palace for 13, 000 years, and had taught countless disciples. However, I have never accepted a personal disciple. But now I have one. She is my only and last personal disciple."</p>

  <p>The cyan-clothed woman beside him stood tall with a trace of arrogance on her face.</p>

  <p>Yolande smiled at the woman's expression. If Kyron Xiao really became a Supreme Lord, this woman would be considered a Supreme Lord descendant. She had every reason to be arrogant having the opportunity of inheriting the resources and cultivation methods from a Supreme Lord at this age.</p>

  <p>"Congratulations, Master Xiao, for having such an outstanding disciple.</p>

  <p>If I'm not mistaken, your disciple seems to have the fate to lead the world of chaos," Yolande remarked.</p>

  <p>Kyron Xiao seemed to be very happy. After he finished laughing, his face revealed a hint of dejection. He let out a sigh and said, "The world of chaos has already revealed itself. Even Supreme Lords are destined to just be bystanders. We will have to see how the favorite warriors of this era will perform on the stage of the world of chaos."</p>

  <p>His disciple immediately said, "Master, I will definitely not let you down!"</p>

  <p>Kyron Xiao nodded and said, "You certainly won't disappoint me, Layla." Then, he turned to Yolande and said, "If I remember correctly, the alliance is going to hold 'Passing the Torch.' I want Layla to participate in it on behalf of the Mist Palace. Would you please do me the favor?"</p>

  <p>After hearing his words, Yolande finally understood why he had come.</p>

  <p>He wanted his disciple to participate in Passing the Torch.</p>

  <p>This was not a bad thing for the Mist Palace, and Yolande had no reason to reject it.</p>

  <p>There were many races in the universe that had ways of testing one's talent, and the one that humans used was known as Passing the Torch. It was similar to the three towers of the Celestial Position race, and it was also one of the most authoritative methods in the entire universe. But the difference was that Passing the Torch was only aimed at human warriors, while the Celestial Position race's three towers were aimed at all the talents in the universe.</p>

  <p>Yolande nodded. "Master Xiao, you don't need to be so formal with me.</p>

  <p>If she aces Passing the Torch, our Mist Palace would also be so proud. I'd be happy to see her succeed too."</p>

  <p>Kyron Xiao chuckled again before saying, "Layla has already activated the Nine-petal Lotus Flower. She will score well in Passing the Torch."</p>

  <p>Even though he spoke nonchalantly, he was still quite proud of the fact that Layla Ai had managed to activate the Nine-petal Lotus Flower. How many talents in the entire universe had managed to do so? With her potential, she would definitely excel in Passing the Torch. This was a guaranteed fact.</p>

  <p>The woman called Layla Ai pursed her lips. Her master had such high hopes for her. Her goal wasn't simply to do well in the test, she was planning to win first place!</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Kyron Xiao realized something. "If I remember correctly, one of my weapons is still in the Weapon House. Yolande, can you take us there later on and let Layla take it out herself?" he requested.</p>

  <p>Kyron Xiao did not ask for his weapon directly, but he wanted Layla Ai to take it by herself.</p>

  <p>No one had been able to take away the Thunder Wind Divine Sword all these years. But he was very confident about her. He was certain that she was capable of doing so.</p>

  <p>These words stunned Yolande, and a helpless smile revealed on her face.</p>

  <p>"What happened? Is something wrong?" A strange expression appeared on Kyron Xiao's face.</p>

  <p>Yolande shrugged her shoulders and explained, "Well, that sword was taken away by someone a few days ago."</p>

  <p>"What? Really?" Kyron Xiao asked curiously. He was not angry about the news. With his strength and status, a first-rank divine weapon didn't matter to him that much. He wanted Layla Ai to have it for herself, firstly because her cultivation method was perfect for using the Thunder Wind Divine Sword, and secondly, because he wanted to prove her strength to Yolande.</p>

  <p>But he never thought that someone else would actually take away the sword. When he was the leader of the Mist Palace, he had personally placed his own weapon in the Weapon House, so he was well-versed with the rules of the House. It was extremely difficult to take away his sword.</p>

  <p>"I wonder who took it and which cultivation level this person was at."</p>

  <p>Kyron Xiao actually was interested in that person.</p>

  <p>"His name is  Luo Luo Zheng Luo. He is at the fifth grade of the Life and Death Realm, and has just ascended from the Lower World." Yolande divulged the information about Luo Luo Zheng truthfully.</p>

  <p>"He is from the Lower World? And only at the fifth grade of the Life and Death Realm?" Kyron Xiao's eyes widened in shock. He was indeed very surprised to hear that someone with such a low cultivation level managed to take away his sword. "I never thought that this kind of warrior would appear in the Mist Palace!"</p>

  <p>Layla Ai seemed unwilling to accept the fact that someone else had taken away the sword. It should have been her! Her master did not compare her to Luo Luo Zheng, but she felt very unhappy about this development.</p>

  <p>"I would like to meet this warrior named  Luo Luo Zheng Luo. Is it possible?" Kyron Xiao asked.</p>

  <p>Yolande nodded and said, "Yes, certainly. Luo Luo Zheng is cultivating in the Mist Palace. I'll call him now."</p>

  <p>Not long after, Yolande's message rune reached Luo Zheng's ear, informing him that the previous owner of the Thunder Wind Divine Sword wanted to see him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was a bit perturbed. Could it be that the previous owner of this sword had reneged on his promise and wanted to take the sword back?</p>

  <p>But then he dismissed this notion. A warrior at that level wouldn't take a first-rank divine weapon so seriously. After tidying up, he rushed over according to Yolande's directions.</p>

  <p>He quickly entered the large hall led by two stewards.</p>

  <p>When Kyron Xiao saw Luo Luo Zheng, he stared at him unblinking. A bewildered expression came on his face, but he quickly suppressed it and said with a smile, "I heard that it was you who took away my Thunder Wind Divine Sword."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng cupped his hands towards him and said, "Yes. It was me who took away your Thunder Wind Divine Sword."</p>

  <p>"Good! You're at the Life and Death Realm and have only experienced five small Heavenly Tribulations. I think you will make good use of it,"</p>

  <p>Kyron Xiao commented.</p>

  <p>"From what you're saying, I hope you don't want it back?" Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>It was Layla Ai who spoke first. "Are you kidding me? Master doesn't care about a first-rank divine weapon. Why would we want it back? We will give it to you."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng bristled at her comment. "I took this sword with my own strength, and I also spent life vitality jades. How can you say that you'll give it to me?"</p>

  <p>If Kyron Xiao had made this statement, Luo Luo Zheng wouldn't have gotten so offended. But the woman beside him made it sound like she was doing charity to him. She got on his nerves. 'I'm not a beggar. And this sword is not given by you!' he thought angrily.</p>

  <p>"You..." Layla Ai bit back her retort when her master shook his head and said, "Indeed. The rules of the Weapon House were set by my master back then. Whoever has the ability to take a weapon in the Weapon House shall be its owner. Young man, since you have obtained the Thunder Wind Divine Sword, I shall also give you a set of mind method.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, the power of this sword will be greatly reduced in your hands."</p>
