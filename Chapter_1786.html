<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>...</p>

  <p>At the moment, what worried Brennan was that these people would feel reluctant to leave this place. He was after all the lord of the divine kingdom and couldn't let them really take over his continent. But after another careful thought, he realized that they didn't seem interested in his continent at all. No matter what, he had to talk to them.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng folded his hands at the man, while the rest others didn't take these rulers of divine kingdoms seriously. They were definitely figures in the Divine Kingdom Continent, but were not qualified to be the core disciples of some sacred place in Upper World.</p>

  <p>After the crisis was resolved, they discussed the way forward.</p>

  <p>The core disciples naturally hoped to return to the sacred place, but none of them were clear about the situation in Pure Jade Sacred Place right now.</p>

  <p>This problem was not difficult to solve. Luo Zheng and others could use Teleportation Token to return to the Upper World, understand the situation and come over to inform them.</p>

  <p>But while their discussions were going on, there was a strange tower built in the shadow of the world.</p>

  <p>In the dark the tower gave off a strange green light, and the tower was located at the center of Chaotic Ocean of Stars!</p>

  <p>Beneath the tower, thousands of giant skulls were floating, seeming to discuss something.</p>

  <p>These giant skulls seemed to belong to two groups.</p>

  <p>Although both of them belonged to the Shadow Race, one of the groups hid in this great world all the time, while the other entered the great world by chasing to kill Preston and his people in ascending passageway.</p>

  <p>And the heads of these two groups were two grand sorcerers!</p>

  <p>"Daly, how did you manage to let so many mice escape to the most important place?" said a grand sorcerer.</p>

  <p>The grand sorcerer named Daly who seemed to be in a bad mood, shook his head, "Humph! I began to cut them off when they were going into the great world, and I have done my best!"</p>

  <p>"They have only a warrior from Spirit Transformation Realm. You have enough power to wipe them all out, but you let them escape to such an important place. And you say you tried your best?" the grand sorcerer said coldly.</p>

  <p>But Daly shook his head again. "It seemed as if some Supreme Lords were watching over me. If I were to hit them by myself, I would have drawn the attention of those lords. That is why I had to let the others wipe them out..."</p>

  <p>"What we worried about the most happened in the end. If the plan was successful, it would have sped up the process! Don't you know how important this is to the sorcerer race? And now this turn of events!" the grand sorcerer said angrily.</p>

  <p>Daly sighed, "Tell me how we can resolve this".</p>

  <p>"Where are these new guys from?" asked the grand sorcerer.</p>

  <p>Daly shook his head and replied, "How can I know about something that even you don't know? But it is worth sitting back and noticing that a bunch of juniors at the Spirit Supreme Realm could cut off the curse chains with such strength. It goes to show that they are definitely not some ordinary beings."</p>

  <p>The grand sorcerer reflected and said, "If they will go away, leave them alone! Things will go as per planned. If those guys make any more trouble and barge into the Chaotic Ocean of Stars, kill them without wasting any time! Right now the top priority is to control the current situation. And until the situation is resolved, you will not return to the Upper World! "</p>

  <p>Daly nodded.</p>

  <p>Daly was one of the grand sorcerers from ancient sorcerer race who led the attack at the Pure Jade Sacred Place. He did not expect that these people would choose the most special ascending passageway.</p>

  <p>It would have been better to have chosen some other way of ascending, and Daly would not have come down with others to chase them, landing him in such trouble.</p>

  <p>They were actually walking on thin ice at the moment. If their secrets were exposed, the situation could get worse.</p>

  <p>While the two grand sorcerers were discussing, a green figure gradually appeared out of thin air.</p>

  <p>The figure emitted a jade-green light, coloring the dark space in an even eerie way.</p>

  <p>When the two grand sorcerers saw the green figure, they simultaneously raised the bone cane in their hands. From their expressions, one could clearly distinguish the look of reverence on their faces.</p>

  <p>"Greetings, supreme sorcerer!"</p>

  <p>"Supreme sorcerer, why have you made your appearance here?"</p>

  <p>The ancient sorcerer race also had their own hierarchy.</p>

  <p>Ordinary sorcerer race members were called sorcerer slaves. These sorcerer slaves had a very low status among the sorcerer race and their existences were insignificant.</p>

  <p>The stronger ones were war sorcerers and this type of sorcerers showcased stronger fighting ability. Most of the ones killed by Preston were war sorcerers. The capability of grand sorcerers was already at the level of a world lord, who were able to rule an entire clan among the ancient sorcerer race.</p>

  <p>The supreme sorcerers were similar to the Supreme Lords in the entire universe. These supreme sorcerers didn't have any Heavenly Destiny, but the spells they used were able to fight against the Supreme Lords!</p>

  <p>There were even more powerful existences above the supreme sorcerers, such as the ancestral sorcerers and the sorcerer sages, who only existed in the divine land.</p>

  <p>The green figure's form rippled with a shimmer and an authoritative voice boomed out, "Daly, Dean!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, my supreme sorcerer!"</p>

  <p>"Yes!"</p>

  <p>The two grand sorcerers quivered slightly. Judging from supreme sorcerer's voice, they could sense that he was in a terrible mood.</p>

  <p>"The Godly Geniuses have all descended into the great world. The old fox of the Celestial Position has already set his eyes on us. Why haven't you made your move yet?" The supreme sorcerer enquired.</p>
