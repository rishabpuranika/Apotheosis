<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The green-skinned creatures were all headless as the flying knife butchered them in a dash, rotating around Zheng.</p>

  <p>A green-skinned creature was pierced by Xun's spear that was positioned to the distance.</p>

  <p>The group of green-skinned creatures were in distrust. They had underrated the warriors who could clearly be enforced on. The other green-skinned creatures that had left weren't too far away. When they heard a deafening bang from behind them, their faces expressed disbelief. This was least expected from them.</p>

  <p>Zheng was under attack. The green-skinned creatures shot up in the sky to Zheng with spears on their hands. They were full of themselves, with lots of vitality and fortitude. Their commander had waved his cane and positioned it at Zheng and the others while drawing a long face. This contributed to the green-skinned creatures attacking Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng stomped on the ground after channeling up the strength of dragon scales to his feet. A taunting smile emerged on his face. A sparkling light was radiated from the flying knife in his hand that spun rapidly after firing up in the sky.</p>

  <p>Zheng outsmarted the green-skinned fellows. He was one stride ahead of them. He excluded all of them before they drew out their spears to attack.</p>

  <p>They all fell down in a thud.</p>

  <p>The living things had lesser cultivation techniques. Their cultivation techniques were divergent from those of Zheng and the others. Their strength was equal to that of the war fighters on the Sea God Continent.</p>

  <p>The great world had stronger regulations. This suggested that the small world rules were substandard. The war fighters had enormous strength in the great world, leaving the green-skinned creatures to be less mighty.</p>

  <p>The green-skinned creatures captured Zheng and the others. This was because of Yolande deterring them from contending with the creatures. If they had battled those creatures, they would have unleashed their wrath on them.</p>

  <p>Zheng's flying knife had already eliminated over ten green-skinned creatures instantly. Zheng shot towards the commander of the green-skinned creatures as his shadow flashed.</p>

  <p>The warrior expressed valour. This sight left the commander of the green-skinned creatures in astonishment. This was absurd! Zheng and the others couldn't fly, and the green-skinned creatures' leader noticed that. He had to act quickly and take this vulnerability as his weapon. He waved the cane in his hand and promptly hauled himself up towards the sky. This initiated a distance between them.</p>

  <p>The sound of horns could be heard from the environs!</p>

  <p>The green-skinned creatures had set up this place as a bastion. A troop of the green-skinned creatures were present in it. The sound of the horn was a signal, so when they heard it, the entire garrison was filled with the soldiers as they embodied themselves for a battle.</p>

  <p>Zheng crouched as he inclined his knees. The leader of the green-skinned creatures had ascended into the air. Zheng shot skyward. He had attained strength after an incessant flow of the dragon scales power surged out.</p>

  <p>Zheng had collected more strength and his pace was way faster than the commander of the green-skinned creatures. Shock and disbelief engulfed the commander at the sight of Zheng. Chanting, he raised his cane and wiggled it at Zheng. The ensuing event had him dismayed.</p>

  <p>Rays of fiery clouds tumbled and quickly engulfed Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng was stronger and this meant that even the fire that enclosed the Fire Law was painless to Zheng and wouldn't scorch him. There was a distance from the commander of the green-skinned creatures and Zheng. Zheng's strength to hop up had already been finished and his speed lessened leading to the distance between the two.</p>

  <p>The commander continued sending down coats of fiery clouds as he swiveled his cane. He was now collected and relaxed.</p>

  <p>As he was in a calm motion, Zheng's right hand darted out a white light. The flying knife drilled its way out of a fiery cloud and pierced through the chest of the commander of the green-skinned creatures.</p>

  <p>Zheng stood on the ground firmly as he and the leader descended from the air.</p>

  <p>The impact after Zheng attacked caused the leader to land badly as he fell down.</p>

  <p>Zheng and his comrades had one particular plan. That was to retrieve the sacred object away and leave this small world. The green-skinned soldiers continuously gathered towards Zheng, but they just scorned them.</p>

  <p>Yolande in a small motion moved to the diverse side where the commander of the green-skinned creatures was. She tried to talk sense into him using their language and see if he gave in to his woes. Unfortunately, the commander was so aggressive and determined. He guffawed loudly like a cougar as he gripped his chest.</p>

  <p>"What did he declare?" Zheng curiously asked.</p>

  <p>"He has declined to reveal where we will locate the sacred object. He won't utter a word even if we get rid of him," Yolande told Zheng as she gawked at the commander.</p>

  <p>"Let's end his life!" Zheng didn't let the leader take any chance to escape. He fulfilled his words by ending the leader's life using his flying knife that flashed immediately after his speech.</p>

  <p>The green-skinned soldiers were checking out at a glance while approaching after what befell on their leader. Fury boiling in them. Some leading green-skinned creatures were even roaring loudly and demanded their commander to be handed over to them. Their reaction was self-explanatory to Zheng and the rest and Yolande didn't need to translate. This was the only way they would be spared from their wrath and be allowed to go scot free.</p>

  <p>The green-skinned creatures had seen what their leader had bumped into in the hand of Zheng which caused indignation and bewilderment among them.</p>

  <p>Zheng had already seized the breath away of the green-skinned leader without thinking twice. The hundreds of green-skinned creatures at the front line all lifted their spears and ran towards Zheng. This was the sole thing they would vindicate.</p>

  <p>Thousands of other green-skinned creatures were behind these several hundred green-skinned creatures.</p>

  <p>There was nobody holding back anymore. They had been constrained, and it was their turn to make an advance like enraged bees. This was a bloody thirsty war. Esther, Fabian, and the rest had to battle back.</p>

  <p>The green-skinned creatures slumped down like grass being slashed after being massacred. The flying knife in Zheng's hand drew out streaks of white light, like a dancing wheel of light eliminating them instantly.</p>

  <p>Xun's long spear thrust out and pierced through several green-skinned creatures' bodies. Xun moved forward. Not even the green-skinned creatures restrained her from progressing.</p>

  <p>Zheng's own substantial body and strength were his garrison in this small world. Xun was so enormous, and their raids were so mighty that the green-skinned creatures in the small world were nothing in the eyes of Xun and Zheng. It seemed that Esther, Malcom, and Fabian were much feeble.</p>

  <p>Zheng's knife was so fast in motion. It eliminated all the green-skinned creatures. Despite charging up to the sky, they could not flee the wrath of the flying knife. The green-skinned creatures in midair were not left behind.</p>

  <p>They were eliminated in a blink. In the end, rows and rows of the green-skinned creatures were lying down dead.</p>

  <p>The figure of green-skinned creatures continued decreasing despite many in number.</p>

  <p>Zheng's act of wiping out the green-skinned creatures snapped their attention.</p>

  <p>This was a losing battle. They commenced backing off. Their tenacity and energy subdued. All their desire of winning went into thin air. All they left with was the clamor in misery and pain.</p>

  <p>"Run after them!" Yolande said expressionlessly.</p>

  <p>All the green-skinned soldiers started to run helter-skelter as their feeble lags could carry them out of the stronghold. They were withdrawing back into the darkness.</p>

  <p>Zheng and the rest maintained an intense pace as they followed behind the scattering green-skinned creatures.</p>

  <p>Taking the sacred object by pressure was their sole opportunity at hand.</p>

  <p>Stealing had become a hard tussle after they faced the green-skinned creatures. There was no time left for them to manoeuvre the small world and analyze its content or how many races it had or how large or small it was. Their leading ambition was securing the sacred object.</p>

  <p>A grandiose city finally appeared in front of them. This was after sauntering about a hundred miles as they trailed the green-skinned creatures.</p>

  <p>The sacred places on the Sea God Continent outshone this city. In contradiction to the stronghold they encountered initially, this was way much better and more powerful.</p>

  <p>The troops of the green-skinned creatures surged towards the city gate.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a group of green-skinned creatures appeared above the city barrier. These green-skinned creatures scraped their teeth as they struggled to wrest something away. Quickly, Zheng and the rest heard a loud bang. A giant stone rolled out from the city and was stuck at the city gate.</p>

  <p>This didn't trigger Zheng at all and the rest. This was a walkover. Zheng could easily jump over it with a single attempt despite the city wall was one hundred feet tall.</p>

  <p>"By the look of things we are not the only enemies these green-skinned creatures have," Zheng spoke.</p>

  <p>"That should be the least of our concern. Our main agenda is to get the object and get out of this place." Xun was about to fly up with the long spear in her hand. She was the only one in a position to do so as others were not in a position to fly.</p>

  <p>"Wait." Zheng stopped Xun. "Grant me the honour to do it."</p>

  <p>Esther and the rest glanced at Zheng who walked slowly towards the giant stone. Fabian suspiciously asked as he glanced behind his shoulder. "What in God's name is he trying to do?"</p>

  <p>His query was left unanswered. Zheng solely walked over to the stone. There were rather a few green-skinned creatures shooting arrows or even throwing long spears towards Zheng at the top of city wall. This never inflicted any change on Zheng and his motion in propelling forward. These storms were harmless considering his level.</p>

  <p>As Zheng approached, he lifted his head to glance at the giant stone. The stone was over two hundred feet tall, and it was like a medium-sized mountain which impeded the city gate.</p>

  <p>Zheng breathed an exhale of relief, assembled his power of the dragon scales and struck a blow towards the giant stone.</p>

  <p>He had the urge of exploding in laughter but he held it back. He had to prove this race why he was much superior to them by showing off his capabilities.</p>
