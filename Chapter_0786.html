<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Look. His body wasn't damaged at all. The flames were unable to harm him even a bit!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I don't get it! Even if Luo Luo Zheng was a Life and Death Realm expert, he would still have been injured while trying to resist the Fiery Star Flame.</p>

  <p>Even in the best possible scenario, he wouldn't have ended up like this after his encounter, with all his clothes burnt out and his body completely fine.</p>

  <p>But somehow, I get the feeling that the Mu Ning from Luo Zheng's body has become even stronger!"</p>

  <p>Apart from Ning Yudie, all the other warriors were looking at Luo Luo Zheng in shock and surprise, including Lady Poison-blood and the Holy Maiden of the divine kingdom.</p>

  <p>The Holy Maiden of the divine kingdom looked at Luo Luo Zheng, who was sitting not far away. For the first time now, there was surprise on her face.</p>

  <p>It was just as the elegant man had said. In her opinion, everyone here was lowly like an ant. She was well aware that this round's assessment was about luck and fortune, but whose luck could be stronger than hers?</p>

  <p>Even though that kid at the Illuminating Soul Realm did not have an extremely powerful luck factor and had taken only three steps after throwing the dice twice, his strength seemed unusual.</p>

  <p>Besides the Holy Maiden, the handsome man, and several other martial artists from the divine kingdom were also stunned.</p>

  <p>As an Illuminating Soul Realm practitioner, once he had entered the Mist Celestial Tomb and been suppressed by the energy that haunted its airs, Luo Luo Zheng should only have been a nature creature, right? How could he possibly block the Fiery Star Flame?</p>

  <p>Even a Life and Death Realm warrior would have found it difficult to resist the Fiery Star Flames. Therefore, it seemed extremely impossible that Luo Luo Zheng could pass through the punishment of the Fiery Star Flame without being harmed at all!</p>

  <p>Although the martial artists from the Central Region were also surprised, the shock on their faces was not as intense as the people from divine kingdom.</p>

  <p>Before today, Luo Luo Zheng had already displayed his ability to challenge opponents on much higher levels of cultivation. Therefore, the Central Region had already come to know of his monstrous strength and no longer treated him as an ordinary Illuminating Soul Realm warrior.</p>

  <p>However, even if Luo Luo Zheng was comparable to an Internal Elixir Realm cultivator, how did he manage to endure the Fiery Star Flame? Even a Virtual Tribulation Realm elder couldn't endure it, so how did Luo Luo Zheng survive?</p>

  <p>"I guess one can only say that this kid is completely unpredictable and can surprise you when you least expect him to," Dillon laughed as he shook his head.</p>

  <p>Eddie was calm. It did not matter to him whether Luo Luo Zheng was dead or not; Eddie would always see him as a dead man. No matter what happened, he had to kill Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Sitting right where he was, Luo Luo Zheng glanced at his chest before getting up. As his eyes caught a glance of his chest, they were filled with surprise. "Three textures? What's going on?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon answered in an indifferent voice, "A loss can actually turn out to be a gain. One man's trash is another man's treasure. For the others, this is perhaps bad luck; but for you, this is great fortune indeed! The true fortune does not lie in the smoothness, but in the overflowing adversity.</p>

  <p>Truly fortunate people are able to turn all adversity into their own opportunity! The Fiery Star Flame is a fire that is used specially to temper the stars. It is extremely beneficial for your body. But sadly, you did not get the full benefits this time... Your body should have directly become a sacred weapon. But that did not happen. You got so close."</p>

  <p>"These are three fairy textures? I now have a top-grade fairy weapon's physique!" A look of ecstasy appeared on Luo Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>Because of the existence of the black fire, it was not difficult for Luo Luo Zheng to obtain the Heavenly Essence. Inside the Central Region, as long as he had enough life vitality crystals, he could buy as much as he wanted. This meant that Luo Luo Zheng could light a greater number of dragon scales on his body and borrow more energy from them.</p>

  <p>However, because of the limitations of his physical body, Luo Luo Zheng had never dared to borrow too much strength. After going through body tempering, his body had now mastered the forceful energy that lay within him, and his strength had greatly increased. However, he only dared to borrow the power of five hundred dragon scales!</p>

  <p>Just now, when he had used the Fiery Star Flame to temper his body, all he had wanted to do was to turn his body into a fairy weapon. Since fairy weapons were extremely powerful, Luo Luo Zheng was satisfied with being able to become just a low-grade one, but he had never expected the effects of the flames to be so great that his body would temper itself into a high-grade fairy weapon.</p>

  <p>No wonder he had felt a desperate longing for the Fiery Star Flame just now. At that time, he could not understand it, but now, he naturally did.</p>

  <p>Once his body reached the strength of a high-grade fairy weapon, he was only one more step away from becoming a sacred weapon. For Luo Luo Zheng, as the strength of his body increased, the amount of dragon scales he could borrow also increased.</p>

  <p>A thousand? Two thousand? Five thousand?</p>

  <p>What would happen when such a terrifying force was suddenly unleashed?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did not know if he could beat Eddie to death at this level just yet, but he licked his lips nonetheless; his gaze sweeping over Eddie who was standing not far away.</p>

  <p>Eddie suddenly felt a hint of killing intent fall over him and his eyebrows knitted together. Of course he knew that this killing intent was coming from Luo Luo Zheng who was standing close by. This little brat was becoming more and more unbridled with time and had begun to underestimate him now.</p>
