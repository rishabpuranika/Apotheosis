<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 950 The Purge </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As the crowd looked at Maurice's ferocious expression, a single thought flashed through their minds: this guy was crazy!</p>

  <p>Facing the frenzied Maurice, Esther and the others kept retreating. So did Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>In this way, Maurice was always under the Dark Nether Death Light.</p>

  <p>Even though this area belonged to the periphery of the Dark Nether Cave and was quite far away from the Mad Scorpion, the power of the Dark Nether Death Light was still far from what a top-level war lord could resist.</p>

  <p>Moreover, in this crazy state, Maurice didn't even activate his forceful energy to protect himself. He only wanted to fight Luo Zheng to death. The three spiritual altars in his body were already burning, so why would he care about his life? Maurice had no plan to live on at all!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng retreated at lightning speed, and everyone followed closely behind him.</p>

  <p>As for Maurice, the moment he rushed out from his hiding place, his skin began to burn under the Dark Nether Death Light.</p>

  <p>As he sprinted forward, the skin on his body melted away, followed by his flesh and blood. His originally tall and sturdy figure gradually shrank, and his rough and brutal face melted away to reveal the skull underneath, making him look like a skeleton.</p>

  <p>"Ahhh!"</p>

  <p>As Maurice howled in pain, his attacks became more and more ferocious, and he managed to charge into the orange light barrier.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Zheng's eyes flashed, and he waved his long sword.</p>

  <p>"No Move!"</p>

  <p>Just because the name of the move was "No Move" didn't mean that there wasn't a move. This move was completely controlled by Luo Zheng, and he could freely bring it into full play.</p>

  <p>His sword attack contained a terrifying power. A raging sword intent roared and collided head-on with Maurice's fist light.</p>

  <p>Cluck, cluck, cluck...</p>

  <p>Maurice's body was almost burned to ashes by the Dark Nether Death Light. The flesh on his hands had completely disappeared, leaving only pitch-black bones behind. When his fist collided with Zheng's sword light, his bones began to crack and fall away.</p>

  <p>"Die!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shouted. He didn't cease his attack at all. The power of the dragon scales within his body erupted, forcing Maurice out of the light barrier.</p>

  <p>Maurice raised his head and fell backward. His eyes were filled with a sense of helplessness. He had lost the battle! Just like a snowman under the scorching sun, he turned into a pile of bones that fell into the Dark Nether Cave.</p>

  <p>Standing within the orange light barrier, Luo Zheng looked down in surprise. It had to be said that the ogres were indeed a battle race, and Maurice's plan had been very meticulous. Unfortunately, he had underestimated the complexity of the Dark Nether Cave as well as Zheng's strength.</p>

  <p>"So that's how it is," Esther said as she stared at the side of the Tower of Sin. "It seems that the ogres found the secret tunnel here a long time ago."</p>

  <p>The others slowly moved closer. "Neil and Colin had hidden here to cultivate. Malcom and Rehaan must have hidden here as well," Fabian said.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled faintly. "You can also arrange for people to hide here."</p>

  <p>Either by using the crab-like pendant on Zheng's chest or by hiding in this secret passageway, the humans and the Demon Night could send more top- level war lords into the Dark Nether Cave.</p>

  <p>However, breaking through inside the Dark Nether Cave would come at a price. Warriors who broke through inside the Dark Nether Cave would never be able to leave it. They would only be able to stay in the Tower of Sin for a short period of time before returning to the Dark Nether Cave� that was, unless they were able to find a new path or loophole like this one in the future. Of course, stumbling upon such a discovery would come at a great price.</p>

  <p>Some people were destined to die for the sake of their entire race.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and the others returned to the top of the Tower of Sin. The moment they entered, they saw several top-level war lords of the Night Group being controlled by the Demon Night and the humans.</p>

  <p>Zheng's gaze swept over the top-level war lords of the Night Group. "It's about time to take out the Night Group."</p>

  <p>Six months ago when Luo Zheng had banished the ogres, he had been lenient enough not to banish the Night Group. During his journey to the Dark Nether Cave, Malcom had found him partly because of the Night Group's help. Moreover, when the ogres had returned to the Tower of Sin, the Night Group had stood firmly on their side. So now, they had to be taken out of the picture as well.</p>

  <p>The next moment, there was another purge in the Tower of Sin. All of the Night Group warriors were banished.</p>

  <p>The news that Luo Zheng had killed all the ogre top-level war lords swept through the entire Sea God Continent like a storm. The Heavenly Feather Sacred Place and the Purple Heart Sacred Place once again entered a state of alert in case the ogres attacked all of a sudden.</p>

  <p>After all, the extermination of all the ogre top-level war lords was a fatal blow to the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>Those top-level war lords had been almost all the talents of their race. The future powerhouses of the ogres were supposed to have been chosen from them. This matter would definitely anger the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place, maybe even enough to fight back with all their might.</p>

  <p>However, the two sacred places eventually chose to be silent. After losing the Tower of Sin, they had lost their courage to start a war. If they were to fight against the Demon Night and the humans, they would be able to make them pay a considerable price, but the ogres themselves wouldn't be able to recover after suffering more losses.</p>

  <p>After all, the Demon Night and the humans had firm control of the Tower of Sin. As long as they weren't exterminated, they would be able to recover quickly. However, the ogres would never have such a chance.</p>

  <p>Compromise was the only way for the ogres to survive. Having lost the Tower of Sin, the decline of their race was destined to happen sooner or later. The Night Group, which was a vassal force of the ogres, also faced the same situation. They didn't even have the chance to resist. The Night Group was an expert in hiding and assassination, but at most, they could only organize a few innocuous assassinations. When it came to war, they couldn't even defeat the Purple Heart Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng continued to train in the Tower of Sin, occasionally entering the Cursed Land to communicate with the stars.</p>

  <p>As a Transcendent Divine Might, Stellar Body was undoubtedly powerful, but the biggest problem was drawing out the power of the stars. The more stars Luo Zheng could draw out power from, the more powerful Stellar Body would be. However, it was extremely difficult to draw out the power of a star. So when Luo Zheng successfully communicated with a star and cultivated Stellar Body for the first time, red dragon was immensely impressed.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng failed continuously in his next few attempts to communicate with the stars. It was normal for warriors to fail when they cultivated, so he didn't take it to heart. Since the first day he had stepped onto the martial arts path, he had clearly understood that this road was destined to be difficult.</p>

  <p>Even if he was someone with great luck, it would be impossible for him to succeed easily. He still needed to work hard. He had known that as long as he tried his best, he wouldn't regret anything even if he couldn't become the strongest warrior one day.</p>

  <p>Three months later, on the Heavenly Eagle Prairie, there were a few white clouds in the clear blue sky. The breeze blew occasionally. The sun was shining, but the weather was just warm enough for people to lie leisurely on the grass.</p>

  <p>Hundreds of tents had been erected on the prairie. A few strong and sturdy men were sitting on big horses, driving the sheep forward with half of their shoulders bare.</p>

  <p>The ogre race had been drastically weakening ever since their surrender.</p>

  <p>Originally, the Heavenly Eagle Prairie had been divided into three parts with the ogres, the Demon Night, and the humans occupying a third of the area each. But now, the entire Heavenly Eagle Prairie had become a true pasture for the humans alone.</p>

  <p>The surrounding herdsmen also slowly began to gather and form a small nomadic clan. There were warriors in this nomadic clan. If this nomadic clan was evaluated, it would be equivalent to a second-grade sect.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, dozens of beams of light shot through the sky.</p>

  <p>The sheep began to flee in all directions as they felt the pressure from the sky. The herdsmen began to shout, trying to gather the sheep.</p>

  <p>A girl on the pasture raised her head to the sky, widening her big black eyes. She wasn't afraid of the dazzling sunlight. She stared at it for a long time before excitement suddenly flooded her face. She turned around and ran to a nearby tent. "Father, Craig, it's the True God! The True God is here!"</p>

  <p>Hearing the little girl's shout, a young man suddenly jumped out of the tent, his face filled with excitement as well. In two years, the little boy had grown into a tall and handsome young man.</p>

  <p>"The True God? Where is he?" Craig asked excitedly.</p>
