<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It was easy for warriors with an extremely high cultivation base like Zheng to change the shape of their bodies. However, Zheng didn't just change his body form.</p>

  <p>Previously, no one was willing to go into the depths of the Divine River to hunt down Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin, because its waters were inhabited by two ferocious Spirit Sharks.</p>

  <p>Anyone who got into the water instantly died upon encountering the two Spirit Sharks. No one was exempted!</p>

  <p>Back then, the members of the Misty River race plotted to kill these two demon-like Spirit Sharks. However, three of their members were put to death while the two Spirit Sharks remained unharmed. In the end, the Misty River race had no other choice but to give up.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the two Spirit Sharks could only stay in the Divine River. The members of the Misty River race were then forbidden to enter this area of the river, keeping them safe.</p>

  <p>Many members of other races and Eternal Realm warriors in the Grand Pure Realm had been attacked by the two Spirit Sharks. They were trapped to no escape and swallowed whole.</p>

  <p>The hearts of the members of various races and the Eternal Realm warriors pounded hard at the mention of the two fish.</p>

  <p>However, why were these two fish at Zheng's mercy?</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi was astounded!</p>

  <p>He thought highly of Zheng, yet he had never expected that he would become so powerful in only a short period.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>Zheng threw the two Spirit Sharks on the ground while commanding, "Don't move!"</p>

  <p>How could the two Spirit Sharks possibly behave?</p>

  <p>Although they were intelligent and able to understand the words of humans, they were brutal and murderous.</p>

  <p>The two Spirit Sharks slammed against the ground as they landed, and then their small bodies quickly blasted out an astonishing force as they jumped into the Divine River.</p>

  <p>Clap! Clap!</p>

  <p>At fast speed, Zheng waved his hands, pulling the two little fish back to the ground.</p>

  <p>The Spirit Sharks landed on the ground again, this time changing strategies as they drilled into the ground.</p>

  <p>The soft soil was an advantage for the Spirit Sharks. They moved smoothly for a while, but Zheng's huge fist had already smashed the other side, stopping them.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The ground caved in, and the two Spirit Sharks were stuck under the squeeze of the soil.</p>

  <p>"Don't try to escape or I'll smash you into pieces," Zheng threatened them in a deep voice before pulling them out.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi looked at the two Spirit Sharks and asked Zheng, "Why don't you kill them? Why do you keep them with you?"</p>

  <p>"These two little fish seem to have a unique way of moving. If I can fuse with them, they must be good Other Shore Tokens," Zheng responded.</p>

  <p>The eyes of the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and King Ieuan lit up, but Eastern Emperor Taiyi shook his head and said, "The power from their small bodies is enormous, and the speed at which they swim is very fast. However, such living creatures would rather die than be the Other Shore Tokens."</p>

  <p>The two Spirit Sharks could understand the conversation. Their bean-like eyes widened, expressing their resistance. It was as if they would rather die than submit.</p>

  <p>"I have a way to make them yield," Zheng uttered confidently. "But how can I store them for now?"</p>

  <p>There shouldn't be any energy fluctuations in the Flaming Maple Forest, so the space ring couldn't be used. Moreover, the two little fish were powerful Other Shore creatures.</p>

  <p>"Squeak! I can take care of that," King Ieuan volunteered. It had been staying in the Flaming Maple Forest all year round, so it knew how to handle the matter.</p>

  <p>While King Ieuan was dealing with the Spirit Sharks, Eastern Emperor Taiyi finally asked, "Zheng, how did you make it to Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore so quickly? What about the situation of the Oneness Sky Palace?"</p>

  <p>Yasamin's face also reflected her concern. When the two of them were trapped in the Divine River, they were most worried about the Oneness Sky Palace and the seven mountains.</p>

  <p>"The Oneness Sky Palace..." Zheng hesitated for a moment and replied,</p>

  <p>"Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Madam Yasamin, you two being trapped in Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore was originally a conspiracy of Yellow Thearch and his fellows. The Sun Crow race had attacked and invaded our Oneness Sky Palace after you were trapped."</p>

  <p>Just as they had guessed!</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin looked at each other.</p>

  <p>Judging from all the actions of the Sun Crow race before they were trapped on the Other Shore, the two of them had predicted that this race would make an attack.</p>

  <p>However, the two of them remained safe and sound, which made them suspect that either the Sun Crow race did not attack, or the Oneness Sky Palace had already won the battle.</p>

  <p>Now that Zheng had already mentioned this matter, the Oneness Sky Palace was most likely to have won.</p>

  <p>Zheng reported to Eastern Emperor Taiyi about other details, including the invasion of the Sun Crow race and the death of Emperor Charm.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng narrated those events briefly, the danger and setbacks in them still shocked Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin.</p>

  <p>"Later on, after I entered the Eternal Scroll Painting, Yellow Thearch and Divine Farmer led their people to attack the Oneness Sky Palace. Elder Pearce and Elder Auden had no choice but to give up on the Bloom Divine Province and transfer the elites from the seven mountains to the Pear Hill, but they were stopped halfway..."</p>

  <p>During the first half of the battle of the Pear Hill, Zheng was also trapped on the Other Shore, like Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin. He didn't know much about the details of the battle. Fuxi then proceeded to tell Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin what had happened.</p>

  <p>When they heard about the Black Ship meddling in the battle and the Grandmaster of Heaven being defeated, Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin froze. Taken by great surprise, they were almost unable to move.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi was previously shocked that Zheng had easily taken down two Spirit Sharks, but now he was unable to say a word, even more impressed that Zheng had defeated the Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>Recovering from her shock, Yasamin suddenly realized a problem. "Zheng, where is Dora?"</p>

  <p>She had heard Zheng mention Elvinia several times, but he didn't talk about Dorothy at all.</p>

  <p>Since all the elites of the Oneness Sky Palace had moved to the Pear Hill, Dorothy was likely to be among them. Right?</p>

  <p>However, the hesitation on Zheng's face caused Yasamin to worry. She asked again, "What happened to Dorothy, Zheng? Tell me right now!"</p>

  <p>"Since you got trapped on the Other Shore, Dorothy has disappeared from the Origin Mountain. Uncle Winchell and Aunt Felicity have searched the whole Origin Mountain, but they didn't find her..." Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>"So Dora isn't in the Pear Hill. Is that what you're saying?" Yasamin asked in a serious tone.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid so..." Zheng nodded before a long pause. "Maybe she is figuring out a way to rescue you."</p>

  <p>Yasamin stared at Zheng angrily. She had asked Zheng to take care of Dorothy before, so he had to find answers about Dorothy's disappearance. However, when she saw the remorse on Zheng's face, she looked away and took a deep breath. "What way can Dora come up with?"</p>

  <p>"There is a door in Dorothy's mind, right?" Zheng suddenly asked.</p>

  <p>Yasamin had already associated the mystery of Dorothy's disappearance with that door. When she heard Zheng mention it, she shifted her eyes back to him. "You... you know that door?"</p>

  <p>"I've seen it before. I've seen it once when I entered Stage One of the Other Shore along with Dorothy," said Zheng. "I've seen it for the second time after entering the Heavenly Thunder Plain."</p>

  <p>At that time, Fuxi and the Snake Goddess also saw the door suddenly appear.</p>

  <p>"What's inside it?" Yasamin asked.</p>

  <p>Zheng answered, "When the door opened, two long-haired monsters emerged.</p>

  <p>These monsters were unafraid of the lightning of the Heavenly Thunder Plain. They wanted to drag Human Sovereign into the door, but they failed."</p>

  <p>When Yasamin heard about the long-haired monsters, her face had an indifferent expression.</p>

  <p>When Dorothy was still a child, Yasamin had entered her mind several times to come into contact with the door. She had seen one monster with long hair, and she had even communicated with it once.</p>
