<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3953 The Secret Of The Long-haired Monsters </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It was easy for warriors with an extremely high cultivation base like Luo Zheng to change the shape of their bodies. However, Luo Zheng didn't just change his body form.</p>

  <p>Previously, no one was willing to go into the depths of the Divine River to hunt down Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Ying, because its waters were inhabited by two ferocious Spirit Sharks.</p>

  <p>Anyone who got into the water instantly died upon encountering the two Spirit Sharks. No one was exempted!</p>

  <p>Back then, the members of the Misty River race plotted to kill these two demon-like Spirit Sharks. However, three of their members were put to death while the two Spirit Sharks remained unharmed. In the end, the Misty River race had no other choice but to give up.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the two Spirit Sharks could only stay in the Divine River. The members of the Misty River race were then forbidden to enter this area of the river, keeping them safe.</p>

  <p>Many members of other races and Eternal Realm warriors in the Grand Pure Realm had been attacked by the two Spirit Sharks. They were trapped to no escape and swallowed whole.</p>

  <p>The hearts of the members of various races and the Eternal Realm warriors pounded hard at the mention of the two fish.</p>

  <p>However, why were these two fish at Luo Zheng's mercy?</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi was astounded!</p>

  <p>He thought highly of Luo Zheng, yet he had never expected that he would become so powerful in only a short period.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng threw the two Spirit Sharks on the ground while commanding, "Don't move!"</p>

  <p>How could the two Spirit Sharks possibly behave?</p>

  <p>Although they were intelligent and able to understand the words of humans, they were brutal and murderous.</p>

  <p>The two Spirit Sharks slammed against the ground as they landed, and then their small bodies quickly blasted out an astonishing force as they jumped into the Divine River.</p>

  <p>Clap! Clap!</p>

  <p>At fast speed, Luo Zheng waved his hands, pulling the two little fish back to the ground.</p>

  <p>The Spirit Sharks landed on the ground again, this time changing strategies as they drilled into the ground.</p>

  <p>The soft soil was an advantage for the Spirit Sharks. They moved smoothly for a while, but Luo Zheng's huge fist had already smashed the other side, stopping them.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The ground caved in, and the two Spirit Sharks were stuck under the squeeze of the soil.</p>

  <p>"Don't try to escape or I'll smash you into pieces," Luo Zheng threatened them in a deep voice before pulling them out.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi looked at the two Spirit Sharks and asked Luo Zheng, "Why don't you kill them? Why do you keep them with you?"</p>

  <p>"These two little fish seem to have a unique way of moving. If I can fuse with them, they must be good Other Shore Tokens," Luo Zheng responded.</p>

  <p>The eyes of the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and King Ieuan lit up, but Eastern Emperor Taiyi shook his head and said, "The power from their small bodies is enormous, and the speed at which they swim is very fast. However, such living creatures would rather die than be the Other Shore Tokens."</p>

  <p>The two Spirit Sharks could understand the conversation. Their bean-like eyes widened, expressing their resistance. It was as if they would rather die than submit.</p>

  <p>"I have a way to make them yield," Luo Zheng uttered confidently. "But how can I store them for now?"</p>

  <p>There shouldn't be any energy fluctuations in the Flaming Maple Forest, so the space ring couldn't be used. Moreover, the two little fish were powerful Other Shore creatures.</p>

  <p>"Squeak! I can take care of that," King Ieuan volunteered. It had been staying in the Flaming Maple Forest all year round, so it knew how to handle the matter.</p>

  <p>While King Ieuan was dealing with the Spirit Sharks, Eastern Emperor Taiyi finally asked, "Luo Zheng, how did you make it to Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore so quickly? What about the situation of the Taiyi Heaven Palace?"</p>

  <p>Ying's face also reflected her concern. When the two of them were trapped in the Divine River, they were most worried about the Taiyi Heaven Palace and the seven mountains.</p>

  <p>"The Taiyi Heaven Palace..." Luo Zheng hesitated for a moment and replied,</p>

  <p>"Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Madam Ying, you two being trapped in Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore was originally a conspiracy of Xuanyuan and his fellows. The Jin Wu had attacked and invaded our Taiyi Heaven Palace after you were trapped."</p>

  <p>Just as they had guessed!</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Ying looked at each other.</p>

  <p>Judging from all the actions of the Jin Wu before they were trapped on the Other Shore, the two of them had predicted that this race would make an attack.</p>

  <p>However, the two of them remained safe and sound, which made them suspect that either the Jin Wu did not attack, or the Taiyi Heaven Palace had already won the battle.</p>

  <p>Now that Luo Zheng had already mentioned this matter, the Taiyi Heaven Palace was most likely to have won.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng reported to Eastern Emperor Taiyi about other details, including the invasion of the Jin Wu and the death of Emperor Di Jun.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng narrated those events briefly, the danger and setbacks in them still shocked Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Ying.</p>

  <p>"Later on, after I entered the Eternal Scroll Painting, Xuanyuan and Divine Farmer led their people to attack the Taiyi Heaven Palace. Elder Pearce and Elder Auden had no choice but to give up on the Bloom Divine Province and transfer the elites from the seven mountains to the Li Shan mountain, but they were stopped halfway..."</p>

  <p>During the first half of the battle of the Li Shan mountain, Luo Zheng was also trapped on the Other Shore, like Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Ying. He didn't know much about the details of the battle. Fuxi then proceeded to tell Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Ying what had happened.</p>

  <p>When they heard about the Black Ship meddling in the battle and the Grandmaster of Heaven being defeated, Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Ying froze. Taken by great surprise, they were almost unable to move.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi was previously shocked that Luo Zheng had easily taken down two Spirit Sharks, but now he was unable to say a word, even more impressed that Luo Zheng had defeated the Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>Recovering from her shock, Ying suddenly realized a problem. "Luo Zheng, where is Dora?"</p>

  <p>She had heard Luo Zheng mention Feng Ge several times, but he didn't talk about Dorothy at all.</p>

  <p>Since all the elites of the Taiyi Heaven Palace had moved to the Li Shan mountain, Dorothy was likely to be among them. Right?</p>

  <p>However, the hesitation on Luo Zheng's face caused Ying to worry. She asked again, "What happened to Dorothy, Luo Zheng? Tell me right now!"</p>

  <p>"Since you got trapped on the Other Shore, Dorothy has disappeared from the Origin Mountain. Uncle Winchell and Aunt Felicity have searched the whole Origin Mountain, but they didn't find her..." Luo Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>"So Dora isn't in the Li Shan mountain. Is that what you're saying?" Ying asked in a serious tone.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid so..." Luo Zheng nodded before a long pause. "Maybe she is figuring out a way to rescue you."</p>

  <p>Ying stared at Luo Zheng angrily. She had asked Luo Zheng to take care of Dorothy before, so he had to find answers about Dorothy's disappearance. However, when she saw the remorse on Luo Zheng's face, she looked away and took a deep breath. "What way can Dora come up with?"</p>

  <p>"There is a door in Dorothy's mind, right?" Luo Zheng suddenly asked.</p>

  <p>Ying had already associated the mystery of Dorothy's disappearance with that door. When she heard Luo Zheng mention it, she shifted her eyes back to him. "You... you know that door?"</p>

  <p>"I've seen it before. I've seen it once when I entered Stage One of the Other Shore along with Dorothy," said Luo Zheng. "I've seen it for the second time after entering the Heavenly Thunder Plain."</p>

  <p>At that time, Fuxi and the Snake Goddess also saw the door suddenly appear.</p>

  <p>"What's inside it?" Ying asked.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng answered, "When the door opened, two long-haired monsters emerged.</p>

  <p>These monsters were unafraid of the lightning of the Heavenly Thunder Plain. They wanted to drag Human Sovereign into the door, but they failed."</p>

  <p>When Ying heard about the long-haired monsters, her face had an indifferent expression.</p>

  <p>When Dorothy was still a child, Ying had entered her mind several times to come into contact with the door. She had seen one monster with long hair, and she had even communicated with it once.</p>
