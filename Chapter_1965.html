<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1965 The Great Weighty Sword </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Ever since Zheng sent Livingston to the weapon refining workshop, the latter had been immersed in perfecting the sword embryo. He'd spent day and night working on it, making sure it was in excellent condition and ready for battle.</p>

  <p>Though the sword embryo was unfinished, its weight was unbelievably heavy. This made it unfeasible for anyone to use it.</p>

  <p>To put it into perspective, the four-inch sword weighed as much as an entire great world.</p>

  <p>Even a Supreme Lord would struggle to lift a sword that was forged from the Star Essence Iron. It was simply impossible to use it freely.</p>

  <p>However, Saul gave him a solution. He suggested Livingston should use the mystical Infinity Stone to forge a sword hilt and inlay the blade of the long sword into the sword hilt.</p>

  <p>The Infinity Stone was very special because it had the power to change the weight of other things. When Livingston first entered the workshop, Saul gave him a pair of pincers made from the Infinity Stone, so it made it possible to lift the sword embryo.</p>

  <p>"In the refining workshop, other than this pair of pincers, there is only a small piece of Infinity Stone. I don't have enough material to forge a complete sword hilt," Livingston said, with a hint of sadness.</p>

  <p>Though professionals were usually perfectionists in their fields, what was admirable about Livingston was that he could admit to his flaws.</p>

  <p>The lack of Infinity Stone discouraged him, and he knew it wasn't enough to finish the sword hilt.</p>

  <p>In the end, the only thing he could do was to give up.</p>

  <p>"After I mixed the Infinity Stone with other materials, I successfully forged this sword hilt," Livingston said in a regretful tone. "It's a pity. It can only reduce the weight of the sword by half."</p>

  <p>"Reduce its weight by half?" Zheng smiled as he spoke, already with a plan in mind. His strength had greatly increased, but for some reason, he couldn't obtain a suitable weapon. He took a look at the sword and knew he'd need it.</p>

  <p>Livingston nodded, and then used the pincers to take out the sword from the furnace, presenting it to Zheng.</p>

  <p>Just as Livingston described, there was an exquisite cyan sword hilt at the end of the blade. Livingston had spent several years to forge that sword hilt, but he wasn't very proud of it.</p>

  <p>Who in the world could carry the weight of this sword in battle? It became useless.</p>

  <p>"Alas, the amount of Infinity Stone is too small! I'm afraid you won't be able to even use it," Livingston sighed. "I wanted to melt the pincers and use them for the sword, but Saul didn't like that idea. I could only compromise with him. Not to worry. I think I have a solution."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, Livingston's expression grew excited. He laid the sword by the furnace, and took out a beautiful sword sheath which was tucked away in the workshop.</p>

  <p>"This sword sheath is a Sumeru Space, made from the Sky Beam Mine. I spent a lot of time making this sheath," Livingston smugly said.</p>

  <p>"Tell me. What's so special about the Sumeru Space?" Zheng asked. He had no idea what Livingston was up to.</p>

  <p>Livingston gripped the sword with the pincers before stuffing it into the sheath. The sword blade was completely embedded inside, revealing only the exquisite hilt. It was evident that the sheath was made especially for the sword.</p>

  <p>"Now you can wield this sword without trouble," Livingston said, handing the sheath to Zheng.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Zheng's brows still pinched together, Livingston explained, "It's impossible for an ordinary Sumeru Space to contain such a heavy object.</p>

  <p>However, if made by the Sky Beam Mine, it can bear the weight of the sword."</p>

  <p>Zheng held onto the sword in his hand and asked curiously, "So what?"</p>

  <p>"That way, you'll be able to run around with the sword with the sheath controlling its weight," Livingston said with a smile.</p>

  <p>"And?"</p>

  <p>"When you meet your opponent, all you'll have to do is take the sword out and do what you need to do. Relying on the weight of the Star Essence Iron, it can crush many warriors at once. The sword does have the weight of a great world, after all. Haha!" Livingston said, smirking.</p>

  <p>"Huh?"</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"Are you kidding me?"</p>

  <p>Zheng and the group of people behind him were in awe with what he just said.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey, who was just eleven years old, was stunned to hear this.</p>

  <p>However, he understood what Livingston meant.</p>

  <p>The sword was extremely heavy as everyone knew. Not even a Supreme Lord could lift it up with ease.</p>

  <p>The creation of this sheath made it transportable. Livingston was resourceful with it, using the Sumeru Space to make it in the first place.</p>

  <p>Because this sword blade was located in the Sumeru Space, its weight wouldn't be transmitted to the sheath.</p>

  <p>The only problem was Livingston's suggestion for Zheng to take the sword out of its sheath and smash it toward his opponents. It was unfeasible and frankly, not very noble.</p>

  <p>What was Livingston even thinking?</p>

  <p>"Mom, what he said makes sense I guess. But how can Dad even take his sword back after he smashes it against his opponents? Wouldn't it just sink straight into the depths of the ground?" Geoffrey asked Yudie in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"Ignore him, boy. I knew he was going nuts." Yudie was also speechless.</p>

  <p>If she recalled correctly, the first time she followed her husband into the fairy palace, Livingston wasn't there. She didn't know where Zheng had found Livingston in the first place. She couldn't believe that Livingston had created such a useless sword after staying in the workshop for all these years.</p>

  <p>Zheng fiddled with the sheath in his hands and said, "Does this sword have a name?"</p>

  <p>"I've already thought of the name long ago. It's called the Great Weighty Sword," Livingston responded.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't expect much. He just nodded and grabbed the hilt of the sword with one hand. "Hello, Great Weighty Sword. Not bad. Not bad at all." After he finished speaking, he began to revolve his strength, getting ready to bring out the sword.</p>

  <p>"You can't just pull the sword out like that!" Livingston panicked and tried to stop him. "This sword is too heavy! The weight..."</p>

  <p>Before he could finish, Zheng had already activated his Eight Path Platforms, and the power of Nine Divine Stars in his body began to accumulate.</p>

  <p>With Zheng's current strength, it was enough to bear a considerable portion of the power of the Nine Divine Stars. He didn't need to use the Cross-world Theurgy to transfer his strength. He merely pulled the heavy sword out of its sheath.</p>

  <p>"Huh?"</p>

  <p>When he saw the sword slowly being pulled out of the sheath, Livingston's voice began to stutter.</p>

  <p>Even though he used the Infinity Stone and reduced the weight by half, this sword in Zheng's hand was still as heavy as half of a great world.</p>

  <p>"The weight of that is comparable to half of a great world... Half a great world!" How can you..." The words finally came out of Livingston's mouth.</p>

  <p>Everyone was in shock the moment they heard Livingston.</p>

  <p>Everyone knew that the weight of the sword was not to be joked about.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, no one would have been so interested in the first place. The fact that it was impossible to use made it so intriguing. They didn't think Zheng would have been able to pull it out.</p>

  <p>"Is this sword really as heavy as half of a great world?" Yudie's beautiful eyes grew wider as she was surprised.</p>

  <p>"Mother, Livingston said that the hilt of the sword could reduce the weight by half, but the sword itself is as heavy as an entire great world,"</p>

  <p>Geoffrey said in a serious tone. "Surely it can crush people to their deaths!"</p>

  <p>However, no one worried about that at the moment. People were still mesmerized by Zheng's ability to lift the sword, easily and swiftly.</p>

  <p>Zheng wielded the Great Weighty Sword and lifted it as if it were light.</p>

  <p>Would this mean he could easily lift a great world, too?</p>

  <p>Gripping the sword, Zheng suddenly took a step forward and thrust the sword out into the air. This sword did not have any additional effect, but the Star Essence Iron itself had an extreme weight, enough to slightly distort the surrounding space.</p>

  <p>Puff! Puff! Puff!</p>

  <p>The sword moved gracefully in the air with Zheng's swift movements.</p>

  <p>Although he wielded the sword without difficulty, the onlookers' eyes were filled with fear. What Zheng held in his hand was the weight of a great world.</p>

  <p>Zheng possessed strength no one could wrap their heads around.</p>
