<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"I also didn't believe it when I first heard it, but it is true," said Zheng, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>Emily knew that Zheng was no liar. But she still struggled to believe him.</p>

  <p>"The method used to grant a Rebirth Land is not that complicated," she said thoughtfully, turning to look at a woman of the Snake Goddess race aboard the ship. "Betty, write one and give it to Zheng."</p>

  <p>Betty nodded. With a flick of her slender hand, a long and narrow jade slip appeared.</p>

  <p>Her spiritual sense poured continuously into the jade slip, and after a while, it emerged, covered in her spindly writing. Smiling, she pushed the slip towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng opened the jade slip and glanced over its contents.</p>

  <p>Essentially, it reported that the number of Rebirth Lands granted in the inner world was limited, possibly no more than three.</p>

  <p>The divine land, however, was an exception. Over fifty Holy Beings' universes currently resided there. Even though it contained many Rebirth Lands, the Holy Beings' cultivation base was much lower than Chiyou's.</p>

  <p>Zheng quickly made a mental note of all the main points in the jade slip. Then, he proceeded to condense an avatar.</p>

  <p>To the north of his inner world lay a deserted land. Even though some creatures appeared there from time to time, they were few and far between.</p>

  <p>Legend said that the Thunder God and the Lightning Goddess lived in this deserted land. It was said that the destructive thunder and lightning storms that regularly swept the land were triggered when they were angry.</p>

  <p>The Evil God sat on a bald rock in the center of the deserted land.</p>

  <p>Throughout his life, he had never encountered a single impediment to his practice. He had cultivated effortlessly for years. The martial arts and the Godly Ways came to him with an ease that was almost laughable.</p>

  <p>However, now, he had encountered a problem for the first time in his life.</p>

  <p>The problem was to merge all the Godly Ways. How could one do that?</p>

  <p>The Evil God could read Zheng's expression, and knew that he had surpassed Zheng in this aspect. But the puppet beside him seemed to think nothing of what he had obtained.</p>

  <p>Yet, he was always ready to accept a challenge. Since he had decided to merge the three thousand Godly Ways, there was no turning back.</p>

  <p>It was not easy, unlike everything that had come before. Naturally, it had turned into his obsession, so much so that he did not care whether he could leave Zheng's inner world.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>A crash resonated through the Evil God's inner world, and his face darkened.</p>

  <p>"I failed again! No matter how much I try, I make no progress after merging 2, 994 Godly Ways. What should I do?"</p>

  <p>He expelled the extremely unstable Ways-blending Energy from his body and into the air. It flew hundreds of miles away before exploding.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The explosive power of even a small amount of Ways-blending Energy was incredibly destructive.</p>

  <p>The loud bang resonated through the entire desolate land.</p>

  <p>This was the truth behind the legend of the Thunder God and the Lightning Goddess. It was not their anger, but the sound of Ways-blending Energy explosions that shook the land. The explosions were so intense that they appeared to be thunderstorms.</p>

  <p>"That's it for today."</p>

  <p>Despite his words, the Evil God was not giving up. With each failure, his obsession grew even more. He would not take such a blow to his conceit lightly. He had made up his mind to merge the Godly Ways, and failure was not an option. In his opinion, it was only a matter of time and trial and error.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Using the Grand Teleportation technique, he returned to a corner of the deserted continent, where he lived in a simple thatched hut.</p>

  <p>"Edna, I'm back!" he yelled, thumping on the door.</p>

  <p>Edna was the princess of the Sky Defending Empire and the Evil God's first wife.</p>

  <p>Even though her talents were no match for the Evil God's, she had managed to rise to the low-rank True God Realm under his guidance.</p>

  <p>She was immortal, so she could stay with the Evil God forever.</p>

  <p>Both the Sky Defending Empire and the Evil Cloud Sacred Place built by the Evil God had disappeared with the passage of time.</p>

  <p>The dynasties changed and the forces collapsed.</p>

  <p>Even the Evil God's children had gone.</p>

  <p>If the Evil God willingly protected the Evil Cloud Sacred Place and the Sky Defending Empire, they would surely end up at the top of the world.</p>

  <p>However, immortality and the ease of practice had made him weary and indifferent. Nothing was new or enticing any longer.</p>

  <p>For years, he had contented himself for living a mundane and simple life with his first wife.</p>

  <p>As the Evil God opened the door, Edna smiled at him. "We have a guest," she said mysteriously.</p>

  <p>When the Evil God found Zheng sitting in the corner of the simple wooden room, his eyes popped with surprise.</p>

  <p>He knew Zheng very well, so he spoke to him unceremoniously. "So, are you going to release me from this world?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Zheng replied matter-of-factly, with a curt nod.</p>

  <p>"But didn't you say I still had to wait a few more decades?" asked the Evil God.</p>

  <p>Having already been waiting for so many years, waiting for another decade or so was not a problem. Waiting was just his life by this point.</p>

  <p>"The date has changed. According to the new plan, I'll be able to release you in two to three years at the most," Zheng said.</p>

  <p>The higher Zheng's cultivation level, the more perfectly his inner world was engineered, and this slowed down the time flow rate significantly. Soon enough, the time flow rate of his inner world would be synchronized with that of the outside.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, a year outside was equal to tens of thousands of years in his inner world. Now, one year outside had become equal to ten years in his inner world.</p>

  <p>Emily had told him that they would arrive at the Source World in three months, which was about three years in his inner world.</p>

  <p>Excitement sparked in the Evil God's eyes. However, Zheng had another step he wanted to make. "But before that, I want to make you a Holy Being," he said, before the Evil God got too excited.</p>

  <p>"A Holy Being? What do you mean?" the Evil God asked, baffled.</p>

  <p>"I will merge your inner world with a part of this world. Then, even if you leave it, you will retain your immortality, in the sense that when you die outside, you will be reborn in this world again. Moreover, the restriction on your cultivation will be lifted, and you will be able to reach the consummation of True God Realm," Zheng said, his voice somber.</p>

  <p>Edna's eyes lit up with joy as she heard Zheng's proposition.</p>

  <p>She and the Evil God had stayed together, supporting each other for so many years. If the Evil God left, she would be consumed by worry for his safety.</p>

  <p>If Zheng could help them in this way, however, she would feel safer.</p>

  <p>The Evil God, however, was not as happy to hear this as his wife. His eyebrows furrowed and his face turned gloomy and brooding. After a few seconds, he looked up from his thoughts. "Do I have a choice?" he asked pensively.</p>

  <p>Zheng shook his head. "No, you don't. If you agree, come to the floating island to see me tomorrow."</p>

  <p>Without further ado, Zheng left the thatched hut, not uttering another word.</p>

  <p>Her face etched with confusion, Edna turned to look at the Evil God. "Why are you acting like becoming a Holy Being is a bad thing?" she asked.</p>

  <p>As she spoke, the Evil God punched the blue stone table that stood in the middle of the room.</p>

  <p>That table looked rough and unrefined, with jagged edges, but it was in fact made from the most expensive stone in the world. A piece that size could buy a small country.</p>

  <p>With one punch, the entire stone table dissipated into powder.</p>

  <p>"Look, I don't know what it means to become a Holy Being, so I cannot say it is a bad thing, can I? But what I do know is that if my inner world merges with this one, he will have power and control over me forever."</p>

  <p>The Evil God didn't know what the Rebirth Land meant, but a man of his talent did not have to think long to figure out the costs and benefits of becoming a Holy Being.</p>

  <p>The only real reason why he wanted to leave this world was to experience something new, and be free. He didn't want to go from one prison to another. He knew Zheng, but he hadn't expected him to use such a dirty trick.</p>
