<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Li Bianxue was stunned for a while when she heard Phoenix's suggestion. Then, she said, "What? Did you just suggest that we go through the upper ice field? Are you trying to kill us?"</p>

  <p>The upper ice field was a forbidden area in the Blooming Jade Stage!</p>

  <p>If there wasn't a lower ice field, perhaps no one would've made their way to Stage Thirty-one.</p>

  <p>"Well, I have to admit that I am only interested in Luo Zheng's life. As for yours?</p>

  <p>I'm not interested in the slightest. You don't have to come with me if you don't want!" Phoenix retorted.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Luo Zheng chimed in and asked, "But since the upper ice field is so dangerous, why did you choose that path?"</p>

  <p>"According to your current situation, it's almost impossible for you to go through Stage Thirty in the normal way, unless you can overturn the entire Element Spirit Civilization with your strength," Phoenix explained.</p>

  <p>Phoenix had always analyzed things from a third-person point of view.</p>

  <p>For instance, she was well aware of both Luo Zheng's ability and the strength of the Element Spirit Civilization.</p>

  <p>Now, the death of Emperor Di Jun wasn't a big loss for the Element Spirit Civilization, but they might have paid greater attention to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>What was worse was that the news Luo Zheng had passed through the Soul City might have caused a stir.</p>

  <p>"If you don't trust me, you can summon my emperor and he will prove my loyalty," Phoenix pleaded with a serious look.</p>

  <p>"There's no need. I believe you," Luo Zheng said with a nod.</p>

  <p>Based on the current situation, he knew that the powerful warriors of the Jin Wu had no choice but to follow him. Furthermore, she could never deceive him due to the influence of the bloodline worship.</p>

  <p>Now that Luo Zheng had agreed, Phoenix decided to stop arguing with Li Bianxue.</p>

  <p>With a gentle flick of her wings, she flew up into the air and said, "I know of a way that leads to the upper ice field. Follow me!"</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng was about to activate the Thunder Materialization, he suddenly looked at Li Bianxue. An ordinary Soul of Light couldn't fly, but he still didn't know if a Holy Soul, which was also named Colorless Soul, was able to.</p>

  <p>To his surprise, several lines appeared on Li Bianxue's back and glowed brightly, then she quickly floated upwards and rose into the air.</p>

  <p>'So a Holy Soul could fly?' he thought as a pair of thunder wings formed behind his back.</p>

  <p>The crack of thunder filled the air, then he also flew up and followed closely behind Phoenix.</p>

  <p>As they flew in the sky, they saw that the distance between the lower and upper ice fields was over a hundred thousand feet!</p>

  <p>Therefore, it was no easy feat to fly from the lower ice field to the upper one.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the temperature of the air around them became lower and lower as they continued to fly higher.</p>

  <p>"Swoosh!"</p>

  <p>A strong gust of numbingly cold wind blew over their faces.</p>

  <p>If such powerful winds caught even an ultimate-level Indigo Soul, then they would freeze to death and shatter into pieces.</p>

  <p>When the winds blew over Phoenix, the meridians in her soul glowed and she easily resisted the cold.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Li Bianxue had much more difficulty doing so since she had just reached the Holy Soul Realm. When she saw how Phoenix dealt with the cold, she followed suit and the meridians in her soul also started to flicker with light. She managed to expel all the cold air that invaded her Colorless Soul in this way.</p>

  <p>As for Luo Zheng...</p>

  <p>Although he did feel cold, he could still withstand it and didn't even bother to put up any defenses.</p>

  <p>After the three of them reached a height of one hundred thousand feet, they finally arrived beneath the upper ice field.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng reached out his hand and touched the thick ice sheet above him. The moment his fingers touched it, white frost quickly spread around his hand like a monster's tentacles.</p>

  <p>He tried to pull his hand out, only to find that it was stuck firmly to the ice!</p>

  <p>Just as he was about to summon his strength to forcefully withdraw his hand, a ball of golden flames burst from the side and burned his hand.</p>

  <p>Phew!</p>

  <p>The flames blazed in his hand and quickly melted the white frost, and thus freed him from the ice.</p>

  <p>"Be careful not to touch the ice," Phoenix warned.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled with embarrassment and silently followed her.</p>

  <p>However, that sort of danger wasn't actually a problem for him. In fact, he could break through the thick ice directly if he wanted to ? but on second thought, he remembered that their goal was to pass through the Blooming Jade Stage without being noticed.</p>

  <p>Therefore, he decided not to mess things around and just follow Phoenix's instructions.</p>

  <p>They flew along the ice sheet for a long while until they seemed to have arrived at the very edge of the Blooming Jade Stage.</p>

  <p>There was a shallow channel at the edge of the ice sheet. Phoenix flew straight into the channel, then her body began to emit the divine flame of the Jin Wu.</p>

  <p>There were a few sizzling sounds, then thick, white fog spread out from where the fire and ice combined.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng and Li Bianxue watched Phoenix melt the ice for a while, the two of them heard her voice from above that said, "The ice sheet is about a thousand feet thick. Follow me, or you will get frozen in the ice."</p>

  <p>In turn, Luo Zheng and Li Bianxue went into the hole Phoenix created and followed her into the ice.</p>

  <p>Like several moths that bore through a thick book, they slowly penetrated through the ice sheet with the help of the divine flames.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, Phoenix was worn out from keeping the divine flames active for a long time.</p>

  <p>After she had advanced over two hundred feet in the ice, she stopped to rest. "May I try?" Luo Zheng suddenly offered.</p>

  <p>Phoenix looked at Luo Zheng in surprise. "Can you use a fire of the same level?" she asked.</p>

  <p>The flames created from Divine Dao couldn't melt the ice at this place.</p>

  <p>After all, they were in the Blooming Jade Stage, Stage Thirty of the Other Shore!</p>

  <p>Any block of ice in the area was an Other Shore Token with ice attributes.</p>

  <p>"I can't, but someone else can!"</p>

  <p>He communicated with the Primeval Lord of Heaven in his mind, then gently waved his hand. A fire lotus bloomed in his palm.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The fire lotus rotated gracefully as it flew towards the ice above.</p>

  <p>Hissss!</p>

  <p>It was Zhurong, the God of Fire, who had summoned the fire lotus.</p>

  <p>Even if he was only an energy soul of the real Zhurong, the fire lotus still possessed compelling powers.</p>

  <p>The ice melted quickly under the fire lotus' flames, and clouds of white mist immediately enveloped the three of them.</p>

  <p>"The ice melts so fast!" Phoenix exclaimed as she looked at the rising fire lotus with astonishment.</p>

  <p>The fire lotus created a cave that was more than two hundred feet long, before it gradually went out.</p>

  <p>"Let's go!" Luo Zheng shouted.</p>

  <p>He rushed forward first, followed by Phoenix and Li Bianxue.</p>

  <p>"Go!"</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng reached the end of the cave, he summoned another fire lotus in his palm.</p>

  <p>He lightly tossed the fire lotus, then it moved forward and melted another two hundred feet of ice.</p>

  <p>They kept going up in this way. When Luo Zheng threw out the fifth fire lotus, the ice sheet above them suddenly cracked.</p>

  <p>Zzzztttt...</p>

  <p>In the next second, a strange and shrill sound came from above.</p>

  <p>The fire lotus had penetrated the ice sheet, then strong gales of cold wind howled from above.</p>

  <p>The cold winds were quite powerful. It caught Luo Zheng, Phoenix, and Li Bianxue off guard as they dropped a certain distance. It was like a huge, invisible hand had slapped them.</p>

  <p>Among them, Luo Zheng dropped the shortest length, followed by Phoenix, while Li Bianxue dropped the most.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the cold winds only raged for three seconds before the broken ice sheet froze again. After the opening was blocked, the cold winds were gone.</p>

  <p>"Such strong winds?The upper ice field is truly worthy of its reputation,"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng remarked with a smile.</p>

  <p>He was fully covered in white frost, and so were Phoenix and Li Bianxue.</p>
