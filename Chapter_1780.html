<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Yudie and the remaining seven hundred core disciples retreated into the depths of the palace.</p>

  <p>Preston had already confided to Yudie that it was his mission to protect her life. If he couldn't fight off the sorcerer race's attack on his own, he had hoped that Yudie could get herself to safety.</p>

  <p>Yudie was moved by these words. She and Preston were not particularly close.</p>

  <p>As for Preston, he only risked his life to protect her because it was ordered by the Saint Lord of the Pure Jade Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>He was very dedicated to his mission. When the sorcerer race arrived, the entire Pure Jade Sacred Place was probably completely destroyed.</p>

  <p>Preston might have realized this much sooner than she did.</p>

  <p>Within the vicinity of the imperial palace of the York Divine Kingdom, giant skulls continued to smash down.</p>

  <p>The sorcerer race wasn't interested much in the warriors of the great world, so there wasn't a mass massacre. Only a few unlucky ones were smashed to death by the giant skulls.</p>

  <p>The jagged black figures left the skulls and headed towards the palace.</p>

  <p>Brennan had preemptively ordered the royal family's members to escape from the imperial palace. Currently, he floated high above the city and observed the entire place...</p>

  <p>"What kind of monsters are they?"</p>

  <p>The terrifying creatures advanced towards the palace in all sorts of strange postures, forming a dark wave that quickly surged from all directions.</p>

  <p>The horrific sight made Brennan worry.</p>

  <p>The only consolation that he got was that these monsters headed straight towards the palace. It seemed obvious that they only targeted Yudie and the people who stayed with her. They didn't harm the citizens of the York Divine Kingdom.</p>

  <p>A trace of hope bloomed in Brennan's heart. He wished that these monsters would directly leave after they fulfilled their mission of killing those powerful martial artists!</p>

  <p>"They are coming!"</p>

  <p>Preston, who was positioned in the middle, suddenly roared!</p>

  <p>The seven white conical crystals, placed neatly in front of him, suddenly exploded!</p>

  <p>"Buzz, buzz, buzz..."</p>

  <p>The Sky Demon Eliminating Array suddenly fired a blazing white light.</p>

  <p>The beams of white light flowed out and traced the perimeter of the palace walls. They adorned the entire palace and made it look as if it was a dreamland!</p>

  <p>All of the three hundred warriors of the Soul Sea Realm stood at their respective posts and released their life vitality simultaneously. Their movement speed increased exponentially!</p>

  <p>As he faced the first wave of the sorcerer warriors, Preston extended his hand and clapped!</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>A thunderous fluctuation was released from the center of the Sky Demon Eliminating Array, which was directly in front of Preston.</p>

  <p>As the fluctuation spread out, the space it passed through was folded!</p>

  <p>The Sky Demon Eliminating Array was arranged by utilizing the principles of the Space Law. As the one operating the array, Preston could be considered as powerful as a world lord at the moment!</p>

  <p>A space which was ten-foot long could be folded into a one-foot long space!</p>

  <p>After being folded and compressed, everything within the space would be deformed and destroyed...</p>

  <p>It looked like a door that was continuously being squeezed, shooting forwards continuously. The 'door' passed through the palace walls, and the entire wall was instantly compressed; its size rapidly reduced. The wall that was originally half a meter in width became as thick as a 'pancake'!</p>

  <p>It was a very bizarre sight. Though the wall looked like a thin piece of cake, it actually retained its sturdiness as it was squeezed firmly. It was still a wall, just made thinner...</p>

  <p>The wall was a lifeless object. It only deformed when it was squeezed.</p>

  <p>However, it was a different matter for living beings.</p>

  <p>The neatly trimmed grass and nearby plants were liquefied into a green ooze that flowed all over the ground. The trees transformed into planks with unusual shapes, which collapsed on the ground.</p>

  <p>As for the members of the sorcerer race, they were all crushed into pieces, and turned to fragments of black paper, scattered on the ground.</p>

  <p>It was as if there was a huge monster that had been squashed by someone.</p>

  <p>With things turning out the way they did, it seemed that the sorcerer creatures would definitely be destroyed.</p>

  <p>However, the three hundred warriors and Preston did not seem excited at all. Killing the sorcerer creatures was an easy task, but it was their curses that gave everyone a cause to be worried.</p>

  <p>"Kof, kof, kof..."</p>

  <p>Indeed, as they looked on, small skulls emerged from their squashed bodies, jawbones clattering as they swooped straight towards Preston.</p>

  <p>All of the martial artists present weren't cowards, as they were not afraid of the ordinary skulls. But now in their eyes, these small skulls were like evil spirits which would kill everyone.</p>

  <p>"Fuck off!"</p>

  <p>Preston unleashed his full power, and he brimmed with an imposing aura!</p>

  <p>He used the power of the Sky Demon Eliminating Array to strike back at the skulls. After all, his strength was comparable to a world lord's as he used the Sky Demon Eliminating Array!</p>

  <p>He wanted to see for himself if he could use the array to annihilate these annoying small skulls.</p>

  <p>The wave of compressing force once again headed towards the small skulls.</p>
