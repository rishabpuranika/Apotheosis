<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2634 The Wights </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Emily glared down at her hands and an unprecedented grave expression was displayed on her face.</p>

  <p>"How is this even possible?" she asked, feeling totally dazed.</p>

  <p>Luther, who was standing beside her, was also incredibly confused. Back when the conservative faction fought with the free faction, he had been too young and therefore, he didn't know much about the many situations that occurred in the Warden race.</p>

  <p>With a wave of his hands, Timotheus focused on his cinnabar field and took a deep breath, trying to forcefully activate the energy within his inner world.</p>

  <p>Yet, even as his face turned bright red with concentration, his cinnabar field still had no reaction whatsoever.</p>

  <p>Many of the other exiles attempted on their own behalf, in various ways.</p>

  <p>Whether they used the soul power, the pure strength, or even tried to feel the Other Shore, the results simply disappointed them.</p>

  <p>Ultimately, everyone focused their eyes on Zelda.</p>

  <p>Looking in the direction from which the scream came, she said flatly,</p>

  <p>"That is the Strength Equalizing token. They've finally activated it..."</p>

  <p>"And what exactly do you mean by that?" Emily asked with a sullen expression. "Can they weaken our strength directly?"</p>

  <p>If the Warden race had such a method, then they wouldn't need to be afraid of anyone. In their current state, they could only let themselves be slaughtered. If Spark attacked them now, he could kill everyone in the blink of an eye!</p>

  <p>In other words, this token was simply too domineering and unreasonable.</p>

  <p>"It has done much more than only weaken our strength." Zelda added,</p>

  <p>"But theirs, too. Every single creature's strength has been dulled down to the same level. This is the so-called Strength Equalizing token."</p>

  <p>Emily paused for a brief moment, and then a bitter smile appeared on her beautiful face. "Really?" she asked, surprised.</p>

  <p>Zelda nodded in response.</p>

  <p>In other words, the exiles, the elders of the various races as well as the elites among the Wild Gods all had the exact same strength level. Right now, no one was actually much stronger than a basic, ordinary mortal.</p>

  <p>"We're still in big trouble," said one of the exiles from the Star Deer race.</p>

  <p>And he was right.</p>

  <p>"Now that we have come to this stage, there is no turning back. If the Strength Equalizing token is really like what Zelda said and it can affect everyone, then they won't be stronger than us, but we'll still have to be prepared," said Emily.</p>

  <p>Emily quickly accepted this fact. She gently patted the jade bracelet on her wrist. She could still use the Sumeru Space, she thought to herself.</p>

  <p>The jade bracelet flashed with light, and a ring of glowing rays suddenly appeared in her hand.</p>

  <p>Clang!</p>

  <p>As soon as the ring appeared, it slipped out from Emily's hand and hit the ground with a loud clang.</p>

  <p>Emily frowned and tried to pick the ring back up, but she was unable to do so. It wouldn't move in the least!</p>

  <p>It was obvious to her now that her strength wasn't much higher than that of a mortal. The Palm Sky Ring was a well-known magic weapon in the Source World. Although it was a relatively light weapon, its weight was probably comparable to that of an entire mountain range.</p>

  <p>With nothing but a mortal's strength, lifting a mountain range was impossible - simply unheard of.</p>

  <p>Other exiles equally tried their weapons. However, the high-level magic weapons were all very heavy. Although they could easily use them in the past, now they had become a pile of waste.</p>

  <p>In the end, they realized that they could only use a few more practical weapons.</p>

  <p>Emily took out a sharp black saber instead. This saber was a weapon she used in the early ages, and she hadn't used it for many years. Her cultivation base had still been very low back then, and she had thus kept this black saber as a souvenir. Now, it came in handy.</p>

  <p>Timotheus, on his behalf, found a saber with a strange shape, while Ramzi found a grey spear to use. They were all ordinary weapons.</p>

  <p>A few exiles had no suitable weapons and they had to borrow weapons from each other.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng searched in his space ring for a while hopefully, but found nothing useful.</p>

  <p>In order to enter the divine land, he had to leave the weapons he obtained in the universe in the Celestial Position. After all, once he entered the divine land, everything in the universe would be turned into life vitality.</p>

  <p>For Luo Zheng too, his weapons obtained in the divine land were very heavy all of a sudden.</p>

  <p>Out of the blue, Zelda pulled out several weapons, as if by magic, for the crowd to select.</p>

  <p>Zelda was familiar with the Warden race and knew that they would activate the Strength Equalizing token. For this reason, during the two years she spent in the Torrent Bone Tower, she had collected quite a number of scrap metals. While she did so, a few of the Snake Goddess members felt Zelda's behavior very strange.</p>

  <p>It was only now that they realized that Zelda had already expected it, long before them.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng picked through the pile of weapons before finally choosing a long sword and a flying knife as thin as a cicada's wings.</p>

  <p>Just as they were preparing, a roar suddenly sounded from the depths of darkness on the high platforms.</p>

  <p>"Awoooo..."</p>

  <p>Previously, the exiles' spiritual will could cover a very vast area. Nothing within hundreds of miles could escape their detection.</p>

  <p>However, their souls had now been greatly weakened. Their detection capacities were null, and it was as if they were blind.</p>

  <p>When they heard the roar, everyone looked toward the voice's direction, but because of their cultivation loss, even their eyesight had been greatly weakened. They couldn't see clearly, and definitely not far enough!</p>

  <p>"Awoooo..."</p>

  <p>The screeching voice sounded once more. A figure slowly walked out from the shadows. Its pace was unsteady and its movement bizarre.</p>

  <p>Only when the figure had completely walked out from the darkness did they clearly see who was standing there.</p>

  <p>"It's only a Wight," an exile from the Fire Melting race stated disdainfully.</p>

  <p>Wights were simply too common in this world. They were weak, and were easily considered the lowest level creatures here. The more powerful Wild Gods didn't bother to deal with these fellows that wandered the Immemorial Wilderness, and it was even less likely for a group of powerful warriors in this world to take them seriously.</p>

  <p>"Did you say only a Wight?! Have you forgotten your current strength, by any chance?" another exile refuted.</p>

  <p>It was only then that the Fire Melting race exile suddenly remembered what Zelda had said. If everyone had equal strength after the Strength Equalizing token was activated, then the strength of this Wight would be on par with his. He hadn't thought of that earlier. As this thought settled within the group, everyone felt a little unsettled.</p>

  <p>"Besides... There's always more than just one Wight," said Emily, biting her lips and frowning.</p>

  <p>"Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo..."</p>

  <p>From within the cracks beneath the high platforms, Wights slowly staggered out one by one. The number of Wights here was really quite high!</p>

  <p>The unintelligent zombie-like creatures could tear up any targets that came anywhere close to them!</p>

  <p>"Wights don't have wisdom or weapons. We still have the advantage.</p>

  <p>Everyone, don't be discouraged." Although Emily understood the meaning of the Strength Equalizing token, and more so that her strength wasn't enough for her to take charge as chief, she still stood in front of the group without hesitating in the least.</p>

  <p>The Wights staggered forward for a good distance. When they realized that a pile of food had miraculously appeared in front of them, the Wight at the helm suddenly let out a howl. It instinctively pounced toward the group, and the others followed quickly behind.</p>
