<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Seamus scratched his chin in surprise. He didn't expect anyone would be able to escape.</p>

  <p>Then again, he didn't expect that Milo's sword strike would freeze the wall and Zheng would create a hole big enough for himself to get through.</p>

  <p>With a shrug, Seamus waved the thought away. He didn't care about Zheng's escape; after all, he was just one out of the many disciples gathered here.</p>

  <p>Right after his escape, disciples of the Divine Farmer race blocked the hole.</p>

  <p>What truly bothered Seamus was that the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace still fought fiercely despite being overpowered by the Champion Fish.</p>

  <p>When Zheng was trapped by the Champion Fish, Efrain carried the severely injured Milo on his back.</p>

  <p>As Zheng took care of majority of the Champion Fish, Efrain and the others grabbed the opportunity to escape. However, as they were rushing out, they saw Zheng cornered by a group of massive Champion Fish. They felt their hearts sink, knowing they failed to turn the tables and even lost Zheng.</p>

  <p>Once Efrain and Milo were safely on the other side, the other disciples pressed their backs against the wall, fighting tooth and nail to defend themselves.</p>

  <p>"Did Zheng really get swallowed by the Champion Fish?" Unable to believe the news, Konnor grabbed Efrain by the arm, gripping him tightly.</p>

  <p>The other elite disciples exchanged uneasy glances.</p>

  <p>"He was too impulsive..."</p>

  <p>"Alas, I don't think we'll be able to escape either. He isn't the only fallen disciple." Low morale permeated the atmosphere, as the disciples mourned the loss of their companions.</p>

  <p>"Look!" someone suddenly cried out. "The Champion Fish are coming!"</p>

  <p>Out of the five who had broken out of the encirclement and tried to kill Seamus, one had lost his life. However, they had managed to almost kill Seamus. While this lifted their spirits momentarily, they had been unable to turn the tables in their favor, dampening their spirits just as quickly.</p>

  <p>The disciples banded together, ready to fight for their lives with everything they got.</p>

  <p>However, upon a closer look, these Champion Fish looked different. They were bigger in size, on a higher defense level. It was extremely difficult to kill them off with only soul strength.</p>

  <p>As swarms of Champion Fish surged forward to close in on their prey, the Oneness Sky Palace disciples gritted their teeth. Soon, the disciples dwindled in numbers as one by one, the Champion Fish killed or injured them. With every lost disciple, their morale sank lower and lower.</p>

  <p>"We are done for."</p>

  <p>"I never expected I'd die like this."</p>

  <p>"I'm not giving up!"</p>

  <p>Dorothy declared as her eyes gleamed with hope.</p>

  <p>Among these disciples, only she knew that Zheng was not dead. Not only was he still alive, but he had also rushed out of the wall.</p>

  <p>Because she had left a mark in Zheng's soul before, she even knew where his soul was.</p>

  <p>She didn't know which stage of the Other Shore Zheng's body was in. If he could come back here in his physical body, the crisis the Oneness Sky Palace was facing might be overcome.</p>

  <p>As those around her were about to give up, she felt helpless.</p>

  <p>Because only a small number of people knew that Zheng was capable of entering the Other Shore in his body, she hesitated to tell the other disciples about this.</p>

  <p>Eyes darting back and forth amidst the madness, Dorothy racked her brains trying to figure out how to boost the morale of her fellow disciples. "Guys, quit being too pessimistic! We have strong reinforcements on their way!"</p>

  <p>"Strong reinforcements?"</p>

  <p>"How is that possible?"</p>

  <p>"We won't be saved unless the elders of our Oneness Sky Palace force the Bearing race to stop! But it seems the Bearing race has been plotting this for a while now."</p>

  <p>Majority of the elite disciples from the Oneness Sky Palace were already here, fighting for their lives. Meanwhile, the masters in the Desire World were unable to return to the Lust World, and wouldn't be able to come to their rescue. They were doomed.</p>

  <p>"There must be," Dorothy said with certainty. "I promise."</p>

  <p>She could sense Zheng's Soul of Light had already retreated from the Other Shore; at this rate, he should've been able to return to the Other Shore in his physical body by now. Looking around her, she noticed that, while her feeble attempt to cheer up the disciples was childish, they seemed to fight more fiercely now.</p>

  <p>Even though everyone had a strong desire to survive, it was still difficult for them to fight off these Champion Fish.</p>

  <p>The number of Champion Fish was doubled, and these Champion Fish came to the disciples to launch attacks.</p>

  <p>Efrain and the other Oneness Sky Palace disciples managed to kill off a group of Champion Fish, and they cheered victoriously. However, seemingly endless hordes of Champion Fish still swarmed towards them.</p>

  <p>"Ahhh... My arm!" someone screamed hysterically. When Dorothy turned to look, the Champion Fish had already chomped off the disciple's arm.</p>

  <p>"Help, help!"</p>

  <p>But before Dorothy could even react, another disciple was dragged off by a Champion Fish and devoured.</p>

  <p>More and more people were killed by the Champion Fish nonstop. In their desperation, the disciples lost all strategy and just lashed out wherever they could, leaving their attacks uncoordinated and clumsy.</p>

  <p>The air was filled with piercing screams as Champion Fish continued to mercilessly devour the Oneness Sky Palace disciples.</p>

  <p>Dorothy's expression darkened. Calming her soul, she reached out and clasped the Necklace of Mystic Soul that hung from her neck.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a bright blue light emanated from the Necklace of Mystic Soul. A powerful aura shot out, causing the Champion Fish to whirl confusedly, retreating chaotically.</p>

  <p>Somehow sensing the strange aura, Seamus smiled delightedly.</p>

  <p>"That necklace is wonderful! I absolutely must get my hands on it."</p>

  <p>The Champion Fish still swam about in complete chaos, temporarily out of control due to their fear.</p>

  <p>But Dorothy couldn't hold out forever. The power of the Necklace of Mystic Soul only lasted half a minute before the aura began to fade. What was worse, she could not summon the sword now.</p>

  <p>When the Champion Fish sensed the aura growing weaker, they surged forward once again.</p>

  <p>At this point, most of the disciples had accepted defeat, resigning themselves to their gruesome fate.</p>

  <p>"We're all going to die. There's no use trying to resist," said a lonesome voice.</p>

  <p>Dorothy sat on the steps of an altar, gritting her teeth. Her mind was filled with doubt. Could she be wrong about Zheng? Did he run away and refuse to come back? Or did he not make it because his body hadn't reached Stage Four of the Other Shore?</p>

  <p>Dorothy sighed. Disciples all around her fell prey to the Champion Fish.</p>

  <p>Unable to watch this gruesome scene anymore, she closed her eyes.</p>

  <p>Just as she was about to completely give in to her despair, she suddenly heard the sound of cloth being ripped violently.</p>

  <p>Opening her eyes, she turned towards the direction of the sound. Much to her surprise, a large crack appeared on the wall not too far from her.</p>

  <p>A pair of hands reached in from the other side of the wall, ripping open the crack. From the hole in the wall, a person stepped inside.</p>

  <p>The disciples whipped their heads around to face the new presence. They could sense this person was not a Soul of Light, but a physical body.</p>

  <p>"Who is he?"</p>

  <p>"How did a physical body get here?"</p>

  <p>"Haven't there been rumors about him? Someone has entered the Sea of Truth with his body. Is he the one?"</p>

  <p>Although everyone was confused, they still had their guard up. After all, they didn't know if he was friend or foe.</p>

  <p>The Oneness Sky Palace disciples had lost the will to fight, and froze in place, unsure of what to do. Even Seamus hesitated, unsure as to how to deal with this newcomer. But before he found the words to say, the figure stepped onto an altar.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>With just a stomp, the Champion Fish Altar was smashed into thousands of pieces.</p>

  <p>All the Champion Fish that were born from that altar suddenly exploded into thin air.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing? Stop!" Seamus shouted at the figure in shocked anger.</p>

  <p>The Bearing race had paid a price to get these altars that could produce Champion Fish. Each of the altars was extremely precious. Seamus didn't expect that someone could destroy the altars.</p>

  <p>Zheng ignored Seamus and proceeded to jump onto another altar, crushing it beneath his feet.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The second altar was smashed to pieces, and again, many Champion Fish vanished.</p>

  <p>With every step he took, Zheng trampled a Champion Fish Altar. Before Seamus even had the time to react, more than ten altars were destroyed, with nothing left but shards.</p>
