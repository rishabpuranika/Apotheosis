  <p>
</p>

  <p>Since Nicholas had made a decision, no one dared to object.</p>

  <p>They were having a brief break when the smoke in the distance suddenly rolled up. There was a faint flicker of fire in the thick smoke, accompanied by low growls.</p>

  <p>The billowing smoke and the noise attracted everyone's attention.</p>

  <p>"Demon Region Fire Spirits. There seems to be a large number of them approaching," one of them said.</p>

  <p>The faces of some of the consummate True Gods turned pale.</p>

  <p>Demon Region Fire Spirits were special creatures born in fire. They were known to wander in groups and leave destruction in their wakes.</p>

  <p>In the Abyss Demon Region, the coming of the Demon Region Fire Spirits was the same as a disaster.</p>

  <p>Naturally, any True Gods and even consummate True Gods who saw this scene would quickly escape and find a safe place to hide.</p>

  <p>If they were not quick enough, even consummate True Gods would die in the smoke.</p>

  <p>"Let me deal with them!"</p>

  <p>Samuel, who had been silent for a while, stood up immediately.</p>

  <p>"Creatures born in the fire of the Abyss Demon Region? I like it! Leave them to me, Samuel. Ha-ha!"</p>

  <p>Clark said. As he spoke, he leaped up and flew toward the sky.</p>

  <p>In mid-air, he stretched out his hands and released flames from his cinnabar field.</p>

  <p>These flames rolled together into a door of fire.</p>

  <p>Sizzle...</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, three fiery dragons that were a hundred thousand feet long charged out of the door.</p>

  <p>These dragons were all different in appearance, but each of them emitted a strong aura.</p>

  <p>All these fiery dragons had been raised by Clark for many years using the Elementary Fire Godly Way, and each of them was as strong as a Demi-holy Being. More importantly, they were all from the unceasing fire that Clark had created.</p>

  <p>Even if such a fiery dragon was killed, it could still be reborn in his inner world.</p>

  <p>From this point of view, it was similar to Holy Beings' reliance on their universes to live forever.</p>

  <p>Clatter...</p>

  <p>The three dragons flew straight into the billowing smoke, splitting it into three parts.</p>

  <p>Although the Demon Region Fire Spirits were powerful, they mostly relied on their numbers.</p>

  <p>When faced with the three dragons, they had no way of fighting them.</p>

  <p>Instead, they were engulfed by the dragons.</p>

  <p>Woo! Woo! Woo!</p>

  <p>As the flames in the smoke swirled frantically, shrill screams could be heard all around.</p>

  <p>Five minutes later...</p>

  <p>The flames and the smoke had disappeared, and only the three fiery dragons remained hovering in the air.</p>

  <p>After swallowing a massive number of Demon Region Fire Spirits, their bodies had become even larger!</p>

  <p>"Return,"</p>

  <p>Clark commanded calmly.</p>

  <p>The three fiery dragons raised their heads and roared at the sky. Then, after stretching their bodies, they flew back toward Clark's inner world.</p>

  <p>"The three Holy Fiery Dragons you've refined are getting stronger and stronger. Congratulations!" Samuel didn't miss the opportunity to flatter Clark.</p>

  <p>Patting his belly with a smile, Clark said, "You have a sharp eye. With consistent training, these Holy Fiery Dragons will be able to contend against a Holy Being within half a divine era!"</p>

  <p>"Maybe even one Holy Fiery Dragon will be enough to resist a Holy Being in the future!" Samuel added eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Ah, that might be too much for a Holy Fiery Dragon," Clark said with a laugh.</p>

  <p>The cultivation of Godly Ways had limits.</p>

  <p>After one reached the consummation of True God Realm, the space for improvement to reach higher realms was not great.</p>

  <p>That was why some very powerful consummate True Gods had the ability to fight against Demi-holy Beings.</p>

  <p>In reality, a Demi-holy Being or a Holy Being was still at the consummation of the True God Realm.</p>

  <p>No matter how powerful a Holy Fiery Dragon was, it would be impossible for it to fight a Holy Being. Samuel's flattery was too much.</p>

  <p>None of the Holy Beings spoke, but in their hearts, they disdained Samuel.</p>

  <p>After Clark dealt with the Demon Region Fire Spirits, the alliance of powerful clans resumed their journey.</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...</p>

  <p>Everyone soared to the sky and flew forward.</p>

  <p>Along the way, there were all sorts of ferocious beasts living in the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>These creatures were usually very fierce; countless True Gods, and even some consummate True Gods, had died at their hands.</p>

  <p>A Rock Scorpion Lion leaped out of its cave after sensing some movement in the sky. Standing on the top of the brown rock mountain, it raised its head and let out a loud roar.</p>

  <p>But the moment the roar sounded, an incomparably large iceberg suddenly fell from the sky without warning!</p>

  <p>The iceberg was too fast for the Rock Scorpion Lion to dodge; it could only cry out like a kitten before being flattened under the iceberg. Its body was completely torn apart under the pressure.</p>

  <p>After seeing a creature as strong as the Rock Scorpion Lion die a pathetic death like this, the other creatures in the second stage of the Abyss Demon Region could only choose to hide or avoid these strangers from the divine land.</p>

  <p>More than twenty Holy Beings, forty Demi-holy Beings, and a hundred consummate True Gods were flying through the second stage.</p>

  <p>The Abyss Demon Region was just too large.</p>

  <p>Even though this group of people moved extremely fast, it took them three days to reach their destination: a sea of lava where no one could see the bottom.</p>

  <p>But at the edge of the sea of lava seemed to be an invisible wall that was blocking the flow of lava.</p>

  <p>When the lava reached this invisible wall, it bent and flowed down instead of continuing to flow horizontally.</p>

  <p>From the distance, the edge of the lava sea looked like stairs. And in fact, the Abyss Demon Region was indeed layer upon layer that stretched downward into the deep ground.</p>

  <p>When they arrived, everyone looked at Tianming.</p>

  <p>"Lowell, where is the shortcut you mentioned?" asked Nicholas.</p>

  <p>"It should be around here!"</p>

  <p>Tianming slowly descended from the air.</p>

  <p>He flew around the lava sea with his eyes sweeping over every inch.</p>

  <p>Last time, when Tianming had been chasing a vicious creature, he had accidentally discovered the secret here...</p>

  <p>The lava formed surging waves as it flowed, and these waves, in turn, formed vortexes.</p>

  <p>But all the vortexes disappeared after barely even spinning? with the exception of one, which always stayed in the same place.</p>

  <p>It didn't take long for Tianming to find this vortex.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>He held his sword with one hand and stretched his body, the light in his eyes getting brighter.</p>

  <p>"Hiya!"</p>

  <p>With a cry, he stabbed at the vortex with his sword.</p>

  <p>Splash...</p>

  <p>The vortex was split by an invisible sword momentum, and a hole appeared in the lava sea.</p>

  <p>Strangely enough, the lava around the hole didn't merge, which made it possible for a tunnel to be formed. There was stable Space Law being emitted from the tunnel.</p>

  <p>When Nicholas saw the tunnel, a look of surprise came over his face.</p>

  <p>"This path was deliberately left here," he noted.</p>

  <p>Jeremiah nodded and said, "It might have been built by some fiend to serve as a shortcut for them to go up from the bottom."</p>

  <p>"Very good! Good job, Lowell!" Nicholas flashed a satisfied smile at Tianming.</p>

  <p>Tianming put away his longsword, clasped his hands toward Nicholas, and retreated to the side.</p>
