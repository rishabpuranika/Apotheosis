<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Bird Masters, the Monkey Masters, and the human spirits all stared at the humanoid figure in astonishment.</p>

  <p>His words, combined with the oppressive aura emanating from him, shocked them greatly.</p>

  <p>What were the so-called Cinnabar race and the Fostering race?</p>

  <p>Were they truly a hundred times stronger than the Four Spirits Sect?</p>

  <p>And what was the Sacred Spirit race?</p>

  <p>Could they really be ten thousand times stronger than the Four Spirits Sect?</p>

  <p>There were existences even more powerful than the Sacred Spirit race?</p>

  <p>What worlds was this humanoid creature talking about?</p>

  <p>All these questions buzzed in their minds as they tried to wrap their heads around everything the humanoid creature talked about. Among everyone present, Corbett seemed to be the calmest.</p>

  <p>Eyeing the humanoid creature warily, he asked, "The Stellar World... Are you talking about the Deep Space?"</p>

  <p>The Four Spirits Sect had referred to the world above the main world as the Deep Space. However, Kincaid once mentioned that the Deep Space had a specific name— the "Stellar World", he called it. Only very few people knew of this name.</p>

  <p>"What do you think?" the humanoid creature retorted indifferently.</p>

  <p>"The World of No Limits... And the Boundless Divine World... Their grades are higher than the Deep Space's?" Corbett queried further.</p>

  <p>"I have already downgraded those worlds," the humanoid creature declared proudly.</p>

  <p>Zheng stared at the humanoid creature incredulously. "Why did you do that?</p>

  <p>What does the downgrading mean to you?"</p>

  <p>The humanoid creature laughed sinisterly. "You don't need to know that.</p>

  <p>The only thing you need to do is give me the sword. Once I downgrade this world to the third grade, I'll let you live... Maybe I'll even let the human race rule the Lower Extreme World."</p>

  <p>This Lower Extreme World he referred to was actually the chaos.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes lit up with interest at the humanoid creature's offer.</p>

  <p>"What do you think?" the humanoid creature asked, noticing Zheng's sparked interest.</p>

  <p>It actually sounded like a good idea.</p>

  <p>After all, Zheng's original goal was to revive the human race.</p>

  <p>To his surprise, Zheng smiled. "After we rule the Lower Extreme World, you continue to downgrade it to the second grade," Zheng said slowly. "Then, I'd become your puppet, like the Snake Spirit King, right?"</p>

  <p>"If you refuse, I'll just kill you, along with your race," the humanoid creature said with a nonchalant shrug.</p>

  <p>The Bird Masters, the human spirits, the Primeval Lord of Heaven, the Snake Goddess, and the others who were listening to their exchange all felt their chests tighten.</p>

  <p>Even the usually valiant Monkey Masters had fallen silent, caution written all over their faces.</p>

  <p>The situation was definitely grim. This humanoid creature was so powerful that it was simply impossible to put up a fight.</p>

  <p>It seemed that Zheng's only choice was to accept his offer.</p>

  <p>However, to everyone's surprise, Zheng just smiled calmly. "What makes you think you're strong enough to kill me?"</p>

  <p>His words shocked everyone numb.</p>

  <p>Although he was extremely powerful now and had killed the Snake Spirit King twice, it would be no easy feat to kill this black humanoid figure.</p>

  <p>What made Zheng so confident?</p>

  <p>"If you were really that powerful, why did you leave this sword in the altar for so long? Why did you have to use the Snake Spirit King as a puppet?"</p>

  <p>By now, Zheng's calm smile had turned into a smirk. "I doubt you are strong enough to downgrade this world. The truth of the matter is that the Stellar World wasn't completely downgraded. Now, the remains of the starry sky are still floating above the main world. You were also unable to downgrade the main world, even though you wanted to. Therefore, you needed to have the Four Spirits Sect send the world builders to downgrade the worlds little by little. That was why secondary worlds were built one after another, including the chaos.</p>

  <p>The Lower Extreme World is not your ultimate goal. If I give you the sword, you will continue to downgrade it.</p>

  <p>What do you take me for? I'm not that stupid!"</p>

  <p>As Zheng spoke, he gradually raised his sword, and the energy in the cracks on the blade slowly began to surge.</p>

  <p>His face bore an unprecedented firmness.</p>

  <p>Although the ancestry-level bloodline had forgotten a lot of important memories, Zheng had gradually figured out that this humanoid creature in front of him was the root cause of all the trouble.</p>

  <p>Theoretically, if the worlds hadn't been downgraded so many times, there wouldn't be the Four Spirits Sect, the chaos, the human race, or Zheng, for that matter. However, this didn't mean that the humanoid creature was right.</p>

  <p>"You!" The humanoid creature's voice finally revealed a trace of anger, and his eyes flashed ominously. "You're courting death!"</p>

  <p>His black body began to tremble slightly, and black materials splattered out like ebony ink on white paper. A terrifying energy emanated from his body, and with a low growl, he waved a black hand fiercely towards Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>While the black hand didn't actually hit Zheng, he suddenly cried out in pain.</p>

  <p>He plummeted rapidly towards the ground, like a falling meteor.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>As soon as Zheng hit the ground, the humanoid creature stretched out his palm towards the ground.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>A black cloud that only he and Zheng could see suddenly enveloped Zheng.</p>

  <p>This was the free space that belonged to the Probability Extreme Form.</p>

  <p>The Probability Extreme Form and the Flame Extreme Form given to Zheng had not yet been removed.</p>

  <p>As he was enshrouded in the black cloud, he quickly divided himself into a thousand figures. The figures all jumped up at the same time, each brandishing their irregular heavy sword. Green flames erupted from the tips of the blades, whirling like tornadoes of fire.</p>

  <p>Clatter! Clatter! Clatter!</p>

  <p>The spiraling flames looked like a huge monster, constantly devouring the black cloud that tried to envelop Zheng.</p>

  <p>In a flash, the black cloud had been completely devoured. Then, Zheng brandished his irregular heavy sword and thrust it at the humanoid creature.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>With a sickening sound, the irregular heavy sword pierced clean through the humanoid creature's body, and the green flames quickly swept over his body, lapping at him crazily.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The humanoid creature struggled amidst the flames that were devouring him, but no matter how hard he tried, he was unable to extinguish the flames on his body. A few moments later, he was completely burnt by the flames.</p>

  <p>"Is he dead?"</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyebrows shot up cautiously.</p>

  <p>Although he firmly believed that the humanoid creature wasn't as powerful as he claimed to be, he shouldn't have been so weak. Zheng felt a little uneasy, suspecting something was wrong.</p>

  <p>Zheng's heart pumped agitatedly.</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng was carefully studying his surroundings, he felt a sense of oppression coming from behind him.</p>

  <p>Without any hesitation, he swung his irregular heavy sword towards his back and once again struck the humanoid creature.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Under the burning of the green flames, the humanoid creature was burnt to ashes again.</p>

  <p>"Is this an avatar?</p>

  <p>Where is his real body?"</p>

  <p>Zheng frowned deeply. After killing the second avatar, he was even more agitated, his heart filled with unease.</p>

  <p>While his mind raced, more and more avatars appeared in front of him, till he was surrounded.</p>

  <p>While these avatars were not strong enough to withstand the flames, as they multiplied, Zheng realized this fight would never end.</p>

  <p>One avatar, two avatars, ten avatars, a hundred avatars...</p>

  <p>Zheng slashed at these avatars one after another.</p>

  <p>Every time he killed an avatar, he became more irritated. He grew more and more paranoid with each avatar he struck, as though he couldn't stop until he killed all these avatars.</p>

  <p>In this crazed state, he didn't even notice that the surrounding environment was getting more and more hazy...</p>
