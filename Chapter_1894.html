<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1894 Cold Flame Poison (Part Two) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded in understanding. The Collapsing Mountain race had shown him respect and he too had agreed to their request. Naturally, he would do as he had promised.</p>

  <p>However, the precondition for him helping them out was that his safety was guaranteed. If Luo Zheng were to be in a desperate situation, it would be impossible for him to risk his life in order to help them. Since both sides were taking advantage of each other, they profited from equivalent exchange.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was not merely being realistic. The pressure he was shouldering currently was unprecedentedly heavy. The fate of the Evolutionary Universe alone was enough to give him a headache, not to mention the fact that he needed to enter the divine land in future.</p>

  <p>In other words, Zheng's life was more precious than the others in front of him. He could not die here. Otherwise, it would just be irresponsible of him.</p>

  <p>"The interior world? What is that?" Luo Zheng asked as he heard the unfamiliar term.</p>

  <p>Han Liusu continued to speak through her life vitality. "The Divine Refinement Forbidden Land is divided into exterior and interior worlds.</p>

  <p>Everything you see, including this enormous cave, is only the exterior world. The interior world is the core of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land…"</p>

  <p>The Han Clan had sent out many of their warriors into the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land previously. Staying at this place for so many years, they had a much better understanding of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land than other common warriors. As the princess of the Han Clan, Han Liusu had the natural advantage of being more aware of their current circumstances.</p>

  <p>Except for warriors who wanted to comprehend the Ice Law, there were very few who would go to the cold flame field.</p>

  <p>However, the cold flame field was a land of death for ordinary warriors from other races. Without the Skyland race's Gold Sun Fruits, they would have been severely injured by the cold flame poison in no time.</p>

  <p>As for the warriors from the divine land, they could straightaway comprehend the complete Ice Law on the divine land, so for them it was not required to comprehend the laws created by a Holy Being.</p>

  <p>Holy Beings had a perfect understanding of the various kinds of laws, however different Holy Beings had different comprehension of the same law, so their arrangement of the laws was also slightly different. Martial artists from the divine land could comprehend Law Power in the divine land itself and had no need of going to the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land to comprehend it.</p>

  <p>Therefore, there was only one reason why they crossed the cold flame field, and that was to enter the interior world…</p>

  <p>Truth be told, the joint action of the three great races had fulfilled Liusu's wish, because the Soul Suppressing Cliff that she had always wanted to go to was in the interior world.</p>

  <p>It was not easy for even Han Clan to enter the interior world.</p>

  <p>In the past, her brother Pascal had organized for the Han Clan, the Qin Clan, and other divine land forces in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land to come together to break into the interior world.</p>

  <p>They had paid a hefty price for it— with more than twenty world lords dead. Pascal too had been heavily injured.</p>

  <p>No one had ever made it to the Soul Suppressing Cliff, even with such a large-scale mobilization of forces. As for places like Sunflower Water Land and Equinox Sand, it was less likely for them to think of a way to set foot there. Pascal had no choice then but to retreat in disappointment.</p>

  <p>He had been dejected for a long time because of this failure.</p>

  <p>Back then when Pascal was sent to the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, the Han Clan had hoped that he could open the Soul Suppressing Cliff. Unfortunately, even though Pascal had made many achievements in his cultivation, he could not come up with a way to enter the Soul Suppressing Cliff before he left the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>This time, it was Liusu's turn to give it a try, and she really hoped that she would succeed in the mission that even her big brother couldn't complete.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of the others, Liusu's talent was far inferior to Pascal's.</p>

  <p>The only thing that made Han Liusu stand out was her preternatural flame, which she herself could not completely control.</p>

  <p>So when Han Liusu expressed her wish to enter the Soul Suppressing Cliff, it was taken to be no more than a jest.</p>

  <p>Even Kennan and several others who had perfunctorily expressed their support for her did not believe she had the ability to do so.</p>

  <p>After some preparations, the Skyland race warriors were the first to cross the visible snow boundary. Soon after, everyone else followed.</p>

  <p>The moment they entered the cold flame field, blue flames took shape on everyone's hair, clothes, even their eyebrows and eyelashes.</p>

  <p>Although these cold flames were condensed by ice or snow, they were not solid. They swayed like ice-blue flames.</p>

  <p>The flames were cold and did not make them feel the slightest of warmth. Instead, the chill was piercing cold and carried with it a burning sensation.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did not devour the Gold Sun Fruit. Crossing the boundary, he felt as if his entire body had frozen up. When he saw the cold flames all over his body, he was slightly surprised. They were indeed powerful.</p>

  <p>As he shook his body, the cold flames were doused out.</p>

  <p>But not long after, they came back again. The poison contained in the cold flames could penetrate anything and anyone. As it penetrated into Zheng's body, it flew through his meridians and spread into his inner world.</p>
