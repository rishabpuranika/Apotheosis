<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>When they arrived at the tavern, someone was already waiting for them.</p>

  <p>The person appeared ordinary in his grey clothes. He appeared to be trying not to stand out by repressing his energy.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Luo! I've heard so much about you!" the person greeted Luo Zheng in a surprisingly polite manner with cupped hands.</p>

  <p>When the other martial artists in the tavern saw this, they felt very strange.</p>

  <p>The terms war lord and war fighter sounded alike but they were different in status and realm. Luo Zheng was only a war fighter but why was he receiving a respectful greeting from a war lord?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng returned the gesture by bowing and asked, "You must be Elder Jing, right?"</p>

  <p>"Please sit down first, and we'll talk." Elder Jing waved his hand and motioned for them to take a seat.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng abided. After they all settled down, Elder Jing asked, "Mr. Luo, it's safe to assume that you didn't come from the Purple Heart Sacred Place, right?"</p>

  <p>Elder Jing asked directly. They had already investigated Zheng's identity and some things about him before meeting him. There were many talented martial artists in the Purple Heart Sacred Place, but with Zheng's remarkable talent, he couldn't have remained in obscurity if he was from the sacred place.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's right. I'm not from the Purple Heart Sacred Place," Luo Zheng replied honestly.</p>

  <p>"I see. Do you mind telling me where you came from?" Elder Jing asked.</p>

  <p>In the Sea God Continent, other than the Purple Heart Sacred Place, there were also some sects scattered around. However, most of those sects were attached to the sacred places, otherwise, they wouldn't survive the attacks from other races.</p>

  <p>"I don't wish to answer that." Luo Zheng smiled.</p>

  <p>He did not intend to hide anything from Elder Jing. Luo Zheng just felt that it wasn't the right time to tell the elder that detail about him.</p>

  <p>Elder Jing respected Zheng's decision and didn't push him. He smiled and nodded, "Since Mr. Luo doesn't want to talk about this, then let's drop it.</p>

  <p>However, I still want to ask if Mr. Luo is interested in joining our Purple Heart Sacred Place."</p>

  <p>The Purple Heart Sacred Place was a sixth-grade power established by the human race. When a sect reached the sixth grade, it would gain the sacred place status.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was a Cloud Hall disciple and didn't have any plans to join any of sacred places of other sects.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was also aware of the benefits of joining the Purple Heart Sacred Place, but it was not necessary for him to join the sacred place just now. It wasn't that Luo Zheng didn't want to give up the Cloud Hall. It wasn't the identity of the sect that bound the disciple to a certain sect after all.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng thought he didn't need the cultivation methods and other resources that the Purple Heart Sacred Place could offer. He didn't lack cultivation techniques or resources. He was just not interested in the responsibilities that a member of a sacred place would have to shoulder.</p>

  <p>Also, Luo Zheng was firm with his purpose for coming here–that was to enter the bottom floor of the Tower of Sin. If he were to join the Purple Heart Sacred Place, it would probably take him even more time to accomplish his goal.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had plenty of time, but Yan couldn't wait. He couldn't afford to make Yan wait. He had to save her.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, I'm already a member of another sect," Luo Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>Elder Jing wanted to ask which sect Luo Zheng was from, but he assumed that he wouldn't get an answer from Luo Zheng, so he gave up the idea. He came here today with the purpose to persuade Luo Zheng to join in the Purple Heart Sacred Place, and he was slightly disappointed when Luo Zheng had rejected his invitation.</p>

  <p>"As far as I know, there are very few human sects in the Sea God Continent.</p>

  <p>And from those, only a few grade-two sects are scattered around. Nearly 90% of the humans are gathered in our Purple Heart Sacred Place. So, if Mr. Luo joins in the Purple Heart Sacred Place, we would make all efforts to cultivate you." Elder Jing paused for a moment before continuing, "Mr.</p>

  <p>Luo, you should also be aware of our human race's position in the Sea God Continent. One should not only live for himself but also do something for the whole race!"</p>

  <p>"I am very clear about what you have said. But please understand, if there is something I can do for the sacred place, I am willing to do it with all my heart. However, please forgive me but I just can't join in the Purple Heart Sacred Place yet."</p>

  <p>Elder Jing smiled in resignation. Then he shook his head and said, "Since Mr. Luo has no intention to join us, that doesn't matter. And I'm pleased to hear that you are willing to do something for us. Although our human race only has four seats in the Tower of Sin, we are still considered one of the fourteen great races. If you need our help, please do not hesitate to ask."</p>

  <p>"Seat? What is it?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"The seat represents the right to enter the top of the tower. Only by obtaining a seat in the Tower of Sin would one have the right to enter the top of the tower," Elder Jing replied. "But there is another responsibility for the ones who own the seats now, and that is to establish the rules and punishment of the Tower of Sin! On the fifteenth floor of the Tower of Sin, there are a total of 128 seats. Every so often, the seats will be rotated according to the strength of the cultivators. But unfortunately, we humans have only a few seats. We only take 4 seats out of the 128 seats."</p>

  <p>"The right to enter the top of the tower?" Zheng's eyes glittered with excitement. This was exactly the goal that had driven him to travel thousands of miles and come to this Sea God Continent.</p>
