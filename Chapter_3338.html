  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng couldn't help but sigh. After all, he still knew too little about the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, he had entered the Other Shore only to obtain the Other Shore Tokens so that he could gain control of stronger powers.</p>

  <p>He didn't expect that the forces on the Other Shore were far more complicated than he had imagined.</p>

  <p>He was still communicating with the Regal Jade Spirit when Luo Nian, who stood beside him, had started to grow impatient.</p>

  <p>"Hey! You said you would take me as your disciple!" Luo Nian reminded the Regal Jade Spirit a bit harshly. "Don't be rude, Luo Nian," Luo Zheng shushed him.</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade Spirit was known to be quite kind.</p>

  <p>Not only that, but it always did what it had promised.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>A green light flashed in the Civilization Artifact, and turned into a green square that was as tall as a person. The whole square looked like a piece of high quality jade.</p>

  <p>"Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack!"</p>

  <p>Crisp crackles filled the air as the jade's surface trembled. Some green colored debris fell off from it, then the jade finally turned into a middle-aged man who looked like an exquisite sculpture.</p>

  <p>"This is you..." Luo Nian's eyes were as wide as saucers as he gawked at the figure.</p>

  <p>A smile dawned upon the Regal Jade Spirit's lips. He then turned to Luo Zheng and said, "Would you mind if I make a body and manifest myself in the human image while I stay in your inner world?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng cupped his hands towards the Regal Jade Spirit and said, "You are being too polite. Of course I won't mind."</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade Spirit looked around. When he saw the brown chaotic sea, a trace of doubt appeared on his face. "The sea of this world..."</p>

  <p>His sentence, however, was left unfinished. "What do you want to say?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng asked in confusion.</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade Spirit flew down from high in the air and went straight into the chaotic sea. He stretched out his hand and took a handful of the sea water and said, "Is this the sea water transformed from chaotic energy?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. What's wrong?" Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>The brown sea water boiled in the hand of the Regal Jade Spirit. It wasn't long before it turned into a trace of chaotic energy and dissipated. It made the Regal Jade Spirit even more surprised. "How exactly was your inner world formed?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The reason Luo Zheng's inner world acted like such was all because of the Primal Chaos Technique his master Bromley had given him. He had directly replaced the life vitality in his inner world with chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>"I cultivated a secret technique back then and that's why it has become like this," Luo Zheng replied frankly. After all, there was no need to keep it a secret anymore.</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade Spirit's face became even more unreadable. "You cultivated a secret technique. Where did you get it? The evolution in your inner world isn't complete. Why is it in such a state? It's so strange," he trailed off.</p>

  <p>In reality, Luo Zheng didn't have a chance to know where his master had obtained the Primal Chaos Technique. When his mother had later on asked about it, she had reprimanded Bromley for being too crazy to give Luo Zheng the incomplete Primal Chaos Technique to cultivate. Despite that, it had done Luo Zheng no harm and as a result, it actually wasn't so bad. Besides, Mike and Lorena didn't see anything wrong when they had entered Luo Zheng's inner world to check, so they just let the matter go.</p>

  <p>As for the claim that his inner world was incomplete, Luo Zheng had never heard anyone mention such a thing to him.</p>

  <p>There was a slight hint of confusion in his dark eyes. "What makes you think that my inner world is incomplete?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Once any world, including the Source World, has been formed, the chaotic energy in that world will fade away completely. The chaotic energy is the most basic energy, and it is extremely poisonous to living beings. It is very difficult for creatures to be formed in such an environment," the Regal Jade Spirit said, deep in thought.</p>

  <p>'The chaotic energy would fade away?' Luo Zheng pondered on the words the Regal Jade Spirit had said.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, only Holy Beings and warriors at the Other Shore Realm could roam through the chaos. On the other hand, there were a large number of low-level creatures in the Source World, and chaotic energy had never even existed in it.</p>

  <p>In Luo Zheng's inner world, however, it was different. The chaotic sea water in it was still in a primitive state, but the creatures in his inner world weren't afraid of it at all. In fact, it was in the chaotic sea where the creatures had been born.</p>

  <p>Of course, Luo Zheng knew what the Regal Jade Spirit meant, but he was more confused. What then was the use of having such an inner world? Even until now, he still didn't know where his master was and he couldn't find a way to ask him about it.</p>

  <p>When the Regal Jade Spirit saw Luo Zheng's puzzled expression, he quickly said,</p>

  <p>"I've only seen one possibility that could explain your situation."</p>

  <p>"What's that?" "Such a situation usually occurred in the early times of the primitive land.</p>

  <p>I have observed such a phenomenon after I became the Son of Truth," the Regal Jade Spirit answered. His eyes began to glow as he spoke, which meant that the story was a clearly distant memory.</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade Civilization was the 749th ruling civilization, and the Regal Jade Spirit was the Son of Truth of the 750th civilization. Therefore, he had observed how the 750th civilization came into being.</p>

  <p>"What is the primitive land?" Luo Zheng asked again. "The very initial form of your Source World is the primitive land.</p>

  <p>If let's say the whole chaos is an egg, then the Source World is the egg yolk, and the primitive land is what we call it when the egg yolk starts to form at the very beginning? If your inner world is really the primitive land, then it shouldn't be a virtual place inside your body. It's actually a real place in the chaos. Have you noticed it?" the Regal Jade Spirit continued.</p>

  <p>As soon as the Regal Jade Spirit finished speaking, Luo Zheng's body suddenly trembled.</p>

  <p>The borders of his inner world were made up of 1080 Sanskrit words, which circled the range of his inner world. Yet when his inner world had matured, he had once had a faint feeling that his inner world was at a certain place in the chaos.</p>

  <p>At that time, he was in the divine land and had thought that such a thing was a common phenomenon shared by all the creatures from the Source World. Now, it seemed that he was wrong.</p>

  <p>"It seems that I'm right," the Regal Jade Spirit said with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Isn't there only one primitive land?" Luo Zheng asked. If what the Regal Jade Spirit had said about the chaos being an egg while the Source World being its egg yolk was true, then there should only be one primitive land.</p>

  <p>"Dad, haven't you heard of an egg with double yolks?"</p>

  <p>Luo Nian, who had been listening to them silently all this time, chipped in.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stared at him. It indeed made sense according to this metaphor, but it was still only a metaphor.</p>

  <p>Could he take it for real?</p>

  <p>"When a round of chaos comes into being, there might be several or even a dozen primitive lands that are formed where different civilizations start to develop. However, I've never heard of a creature's inner world being a primitive land before," the Regal Jade Spirit said with a shake of his head and smiled. "It was a bit hasty to appoint you as the spokesperson of our Regal Jade Civilization and you were even not qualified--but now, things seem to be getting more and more interesting," he continued.</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade Civilization had been hiding in Stage Thirteen for a long time, and the Regal Jade Spirit also felt that there wasn't much time left.</p>

  <p>Choosing Luo Zheng to be their spokesperson was just a makeshift plan, but as the Regal Jade Spirit got to know more about him, he discovered that Luo Zheng was not as simple as he seemed.</p>

  <p>While Luo Zheng discussed things with the Regal Jade Spirit, the divine land on the other side of the chaos had already traveled through the boundless chaos for a long time.</p>

  <p>The divine land was like a bright gem that traversed through one chaos cloud after another. It was impressive considering that those chaos clouds were unimaginably large, and it usually took several months for the divine land to pass through a chaos cloud at its normal speed.</p>

  <p>Before Luo Zheng left the divine land, he had handed the Sun-resisting Umbrella over to Mike. However, it was Timotheus who actually controlled which direction the divine land would go.</p>

  <p>Timotheus stood in the sun, his hands controlling the four rings as his consciousness floated to the outside of the divine land. His eyes paid close attention to the surroundings of the divine land.</p>

  <p>It was actually boring to control this divine land. There were no sceneries in the boundless chaos, but Timotheus was extremely responsible in doing his job. He hadn't even blinked in the past few months and maintained the same posture all the time.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, he sensed something strange. "What's that?" he muttered. His eyes quickly widened when he realized what it was.</p>

  <p>When the divine land passed through a chaos cloud, a huge tombstone emerged from behind it. The tombstone was as large as the entire divine land!</p>
