<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1884 The Sky Pearl (Part One) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Zheng had defeated many warriors as he kicked them into the black water earlier. After they fell into the water, most of them moved to other platforms.</p>

  <p>However, there was someone who never appeared again. It was Quentin, the first warrior to fall into the water.</p>

  <p>Quentin was known for his vicious personality. A warrior like him who came from a powerful clan would prioritize his reputation above anything else.</p>

  <p>He suffered tremendously with his battle against Zheng. Humiliation enveloped him after Zheng pressed his face to the ground. A great grudge formed in Quentin as he vowed to murder Zheng for revenge.</p>

  <p>The black water surged violently. Some of the warriors were surprised and shouted, "The tide is coming again. Everyone, get ready to refine it!"</p>

  <p>Their shouts echoed as everyone braced themselves for another chance to loot.</p>

  <p>There were only seven Tidal Surges a day, and each one was an incomparably precious chance for the warriors to collect valuable resources. Since they had finally entered this place, they naturally wouldn't miss a single opportunity to obtain the rare resources here.</p>

  <p>They would risk their lives in order to harvest everything they could.</p>

  <p>However, some of the warriors felt puzzled as they gazed upon the water's surface. When the tide came, the water's surface should have risen evenly. But then, only the water at one side of the central platform surged.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't seem to be a Tidal Surge. Watch out! There's something in the black water!"</p>

  <p>The black water swirled as its center began to sink. A massive whirlpool suddenly appeared as if a monster opened its mouth to suck the water and everything around it. The whirlpool was so deep that its center was over 10 feet below its edge.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>The air in the middle of the whirlpool grew faster and more vicious.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a tornado was formed in the center of the whirlpool. The violent wind rose straight into the sky. Above it stood the warrior Quentin.</p>

  <p>His face was bloody and mangled because of the injuries he suffered when he had been pressed against the ground by Zheng. The wounds were so deep that some parts of his face revealed eerie white bones. A murderous expression painted his face which, coupled with his damaged appearance, made him look almost like a demon from hell.</p>

  <p>"What happened?" Kaydan, who was about to leave, became curious about the commotion. He turned around and recognized the person above the tornado. "The young man from the Qin Clan?" he asked with a vigilant gaze upon Quentin.</p>

  <p>"He looks pretty angry. I'm afraid he's going to fight to the death. Do you want me to stop him?" a warrior beside Kaydan asked with a fearless tone.</p>

  <p>However, Kaydan waved his hand and shook his head as he dismissed the warrior's query. "Let's just take a look."</p>

  <p>At the moment, Kaydan still only knew very little about Zheng's true strength. However, since the boy could block his fire serpent without any sign of struggle, Kaydan concluded that Zheng indeed had the qualifications to join the Divinity Hunt Squad of the Collapsing Mountain race, which granted him the equal status as an elder of the Skyland race.</p>

  <p>Quentin was only at the Spirit Transformation Realm. If Zheng indeed had such strength, Quentin wouldn't be a match for him.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Kaydan believed that it was a good opportunity to inspect Zheng's strength when Quentin attacked him out of anger. Of course, Quentin was in danger of getting beaten up even worse if Zheng was truly stronger than him.</p>

  <p>The Qin Clan would definitely question the Skyland race if Kaydan allowed such an event, but Kaydan didn't care at all.</p>

  <p>All of the six great sacred places for cultivation had their own pride.</p>

  <p>They were at the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land and they were always the ones who were begged to by others.</p>

  <p>"Dear Gods! Please listen to my dearest wish! I swear on the cost of my own life, as well as the demon in my heart, that I shall trample all obstacles in front of me and end this worthless man's life. Let your powers flow through my supreme primordial weapon which will heed my every command!"</p>

  <p>Quentin, who was high in the sky, shouted and began to chant the Wishing Spell with a determined voice. The chant echoed and was heard by the warriors below.</p>

  <p>The Wishing Spell was one of the three thousand Godly Ways, and it was also the most widespread one.</p>

  <p>The use of the Wishing Spell wouldn't conflict with the other Godly Ways a warrior used. On the contrary, it was always the last straw for every warrior. In the face of a life-or-death crisis, the Wishing Spell could increase a warrior's strength by several times!</p>

  <p>Even though Kennan was only a world lord, he had managed to seal the Formless Sky Python for a short while with the help of the Wishing Spell.</p>

  <p>Of course, there were pros and cons to everything. The more advantages one obtained, the greater the restrictions were. This was the principle of equivalent exchange. If one could not defeat the enemies after chanting the Wishing Spell, then he or she would have to carry out the unfulfilled wish in his or her remaining lifetime.</p>

  <p>If the wish remained unfulfilled, it would be impossible for them to improve their cultivation.</p>

  <p>Even though Kennan and Woodrow had managed to save Liusu that day, they did not have the strength to kill the Formless Sky Python. Their failure would have detrimental effects on their cultivation, but for the sake of the princess, they were willing to pay such a price.</p>

  <p>As for Quentin, he gave no attention to the negative consequences as he was already swallowed by his rage.</p>

  <p>After the Wishing Spell was cast, a supreme primordial weapon that dangled on his chest was activated successfully.</p>

  <p>It was a greyish pearl, which looked almost like a drop of water. Power radiated through its translucent and round appearance.</p>

  <p>Aroo!</p>

  <p>The moment the pearl was activated, a loud and clear voice echoed through the sky.</p>

  <p>All the members of the Skyland race on the top towers heard that voice.</p>

  <p>Anxiety appeared on their faces, including Kaydan and the elders of the Skyland race.</p>
