  <p>Actually, demons, humans, and ogres were all intelligent species.</p>

  <p>Since they all had intelligence and the ability to think independently, demons and ogres all felt the same emotions that humans did.</p>

  <p>Like love, fear, sadness...</p>

  <p>At this point, Luo Luo Zheng was covered in blood. Nevertheless, he stood before his rivals resolutely. The demon generals were overwhelmed by his perseverance and momentum. For a moment no one lunged at him!</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng... Luo Luo Zheng, don't bother to save me. If you can break through, make your escape!" Nina cried in a low voice as tears filled her eyes.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was not very tall, but at this moment, his lofty image as a hero was etched deeply in her heart.</p>

  <p>Hearing Nina's words, Luo Luo Zheng turned to look at her and responded with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>At the crucial moment of life and death, his smile was heart-warming.</p>

  <p>Holding the broken flying knife and wearing a robe soaked with blood, he confronted the demon generals bravely.</p>

  <p>Then he heard a few words in demon language. The demon general who had taken Nina hostage was speaking.</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished, the demon generals surrounding Luo Luo Zheng assumed an aggressive pose. They seemed to be planning to rush at Luo Luo Zheng together.</p>

  <p>A streak of purple-black demonic life energy rose from Luo Zheng's hand. Luo Luo Zheng intended to use all the demonic life energy in him. He held the knife in one hand to protect his chest, and made a fist with the other hand, around which the demonic life energy swarmed.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was prepared to fight the demon generals, even though he was outnumbered and seeming out-skilled. His stance conveyed to the demon generals that they should confront him if they were not afraid of death.</p>

  <p>When the first demon general ran forward, Luo Luo Zheng took a step back. At the same time, another demon general rushed Luo Luo Zheng with a bone spur aimed toward his chest. Luo Luo Zheng did not dodge the bone spur. Instead, he dashed toward the demon general and allowed the spur to penetrate his body.</p>

  <p>What was even crazier was that he pushed his body against the bone spur.</p>

  <p>"Puff!"</p>

  <p>When the bone spur penetrated his body, Luo Luo Zheng pressed against it and got closer to the demon general.</p>

  <p>The part of the bone spur that came out of Luo Zheng's back had turned from bronze to scarlet. Luo Zheng's blood dripped down the bone spur's point...</p>

  <p>Seeing that Luo Luo Zheng had fearlessly stood up against the bone spur in his chest and even pushed himself closer, the demon general suddenly panicked.</p>

  <p>He wanted to break the bone spur to distance himself from Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>But, it was too late.</p>

  <p>"Puff!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng punched the demon general on the chest and infused his body with wisps of the demonic life energy...</p>

  <p>Then, without sparing another glance at the demon general, Luo Luo Zheng turned to meet another one. He knew that once the demonic life energy entered the demon general's body, nothing could save him.</p>

  <p>The first one died...</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had barely turned his head when another bone spur pierced his body.</p>

  <p>With the same move, Luo Luo Zheng rushed forward against the bone spur and drove his demonic life energy into the body of the second demon general...</p>

  <p>The second one died...</p>

  <p>Then, the third one died...</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng... Luo Luo Zheng..."</p>

  <p>Tears blurred Nina's vision as she watched Luo Luo Zheng fight fiercely. Her eyes were now as swollen as two walnuts.</p>

  <p>But she could not do anything!</p>

  <p>Their enemies were demons, and she came from a different species!</p>

  <p>She couldn't even beg them as she didn't know their language!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng could not hear anything. What sustained him was his unyielding faith!</p>

  <p>To exhaust all the life energy in his body, to drain his strength, and to run out of his blood!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was determined to achieve this. He would not allow himself to fall or die before he killed all of the demon generals.</p>

  <p>Then the fourth one died...</p>

  <p>The fifth one died...</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng intentionally put himself in harm's way and killed five demon generals.</p>

  <p>Now his body was riddled with bone spurs.</p>

  <p>The previous bone spurs had only pierced Luo Zheng's limbs, not his vital parts.</p>

  <p>But these bone spurs had penetrated his body, and almost every spur was lodged in his vital parts!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was unable to walk anymore. The bone spurs that had pierced his body made him look like a hedgehog. He stood where he was, facing the last demon general.</p>

  <p>To become a demon general, a demon soldier must go through numerous bloody battles. Otherwise, he would not have become powerful.</p>

  <p>Compared with humans, demons were far more powerful in terms of both, willpower and physical resilience. Besides, they had a weapon growing in their bodies since childhood? the bone spur, and they were brought up with rigorous training that often decided whether they could live or die...</p>

  <p>Even the last demon general who grew up under such brutal training was deeply impressed by Luo Zheng's willpower.</p>

  <p>The demon general held Nina in one hand and pointed to Luo Luo Zheng with a bone spur sticking out of his other arm. "Boy, I admire your willpower and courage, but you and I are different species. You have to die today..." he shouted.</p>

  <p>In fact, all three present on the battlefield, the demon general, Nina, and Luo Luo Zheng, knew that Luo Zheng's injuries were so severe that he would die even if the demon general just left him here.</p>

  <p>But just to be sure, the demon general decided to kill Luo Luo Zheng himself.</p>

  <p>The bone spur on his arm began to contract under his muscles. Once the muscles rebounded to a certain extent, the bone spur would be shot out like an arrow.</p>

  <p>Just as the demon general was about to shoot his bone spur, Nina's life vitality surged up!</p>

  <p>She would not let Luo Luo Zheng be harmed any more.</p>

  <p>Nina's life vitality turned into fine red needles. Before the demon general could react, the needles flew toward their target.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, her attack didn't work. The demon general stretched out his arms and covered his eyes to block the attack. Then, he threw Nina far away with a wave.</p>

  <p>Nina's delicate body smashed against the trunk of a huge spruce and slowly fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>At this moment, this noblewoman, who had grown up with respect and care, showed her indomitable will. With a flip of her hand, she summoned a small golden box in her palm. Just as she was about to open the golden box, a short yet powerful bone spur shot at her and crushed the golden box.</p>

  <p>This strike was not from the demon general who had grabbed her. Not far away, in the spruce woods, there were several more demon generals. One of them had shot the bone spur.</p>

  <p>In addition, there were dozens of demon soldiers beside them.</p>

  <p>Nina despaired at the sight of so many demon soldiers and generals. She gave up the struggle, looked at Luo Luo Zheng blankly, and murmured, "I'm sorry, I couldn't help you..."</p>

  <p>After the brief episode, the demon general told Nina, "Your resistance is useless. You really can't help him." Then he turned and pointed the bone spur at Luo Luo Zheng again and yelled, "Get ready to die!"</p>

  <p>Just as Nina and Luo Luo Zheng thought that they were going to die, something happened.</p>

  <p>A small silver sword appeared in the sky.</p>

  <p>It began whirring, gathering speed with each turn. When it stopped spinning, it set its direction and thrust downward.</p>

  <p>"Swish, swish, swish!"</p>

  <p>The first small silver sword was followed by a second, and then a third, and a fourth...</p>

  <p>Each small sword spun round and round, settled on its target, and fell free like a raindrop.</p>

  <p>The small swords were made of life vitality, and each was sharp with frightening power.</p>

  <p>The demon general in front of Luo Luo Zheng was enveloped in a shower of silver swords before he could shoot his bone spur.</p>

  <p>These small silver swords covered a very large area. They appeared not only above that demon general but also above the demon generals and soldiers hidden in the spruce woods.</p>

  <p>This was a sword rain, controlled by death...</p>

  <p>The demon generals and soldiers fled and screamed in despair, but none of them could escape death.</p>

  <p>When the last small sword inserted itself in the ground, it turned into life vitality and vanished between heaven and earth. Silence descended on Sky Forest. All the demons had been wiped out by the rain of silver swords.</p>

  <p>At this point, a man was suspended in the air.</p>

  <p>He appeared to be a middle-aged man and was dressed in a dirty robe.</p>

  <p>His face was red, and his hair was tousled which made him look rather messy.</p>

  <p>At the sight of the middle-aged man, Nina's lifeless eyes immediately lit up, and her face broke into a radiant smile. "Uncle Lennie!" she exclaimed with delight.</p>

  <p>This ruddy-faced man turned out to be Nina's uncle, Lennie Zhu.</p>

  <p>In the Zhu Clan, Lennie Zhu's strength was ranked in the top three among all the elders. He was an expert in turning life vitality into swords, but he was a bit untidy in appearance. Since he was usually slovenly dressed even when he went out, people had nicknamed him as the Messy Sword Genius.</p>

  <p>"Nina! Are you okay?" he asked with genuine concern. "I came here as soon as I got your message!" Lennie Zhu stood on a small silver sword and descended slowly from the sky toward Nina. As he saw that Nina seemed fine, his worry dissipated.</p>

  <p>The moment the demon general had caught Nina, she triggered an Immediate Messager. The Zhu Clan had designed the Immediate Messager for its family members. Once it was triggered, the nearest family members would receive news in an instant!</p>

  <p>However, Immediate Messagers had a big drawback? rescuers, no matter how fast, often found it difficult to get to the scene in time.</p>

  <p>Usually, it was too late when rescuers arrived.</p>

  <p>Lennie Zhu was supposed to be fighting with demons on the Shura Battlefield beside White Emperor City on behalf of the Zhu Clan. A big event in White Emperor City forced him to leave the battlefield. When Nina triggered her Immediate Messager, he happened to be close to Sky Forest. That was why he was able to reach her at this crucial time.</p>

  <p>It seemed that Nina was not fated to die yet!</p>

  <p>"I'm okay, Uncle Lennie! I'm fine! Save him! Save Luo Luo Zheng!" Nina cried, looking excited.</p>

  <p>When Lennie Zhu turned and found that Luo Luo Zheng was covered in blood and that the corpses of a few demon generals were lying beside Luo Luo Zheng, traces of shock flashed across his face.</p>

  <p>'He looks very young! He is a disciple of Cloud Sect. He may have come to trial for slaying demons like Nina. Is this guy really so powerful that he killed a bunch of demon generals all by himself?' Lennie Zhu wondered.</p>

  <p>'His robe is white!</p>

  <p>If I remember correctly, the white robe should be the uniform of Cloud Sect's outer disciples!'</p>

  <p>As Lennie Zhu sniffed the air, the?shock deepened on his?face and his eyes widened with amazement. He smelled a vestige of life energy and was astounded to discover that Luo Luo Zheng was not a nature creature. He was only half-step into the nature level.</p>
