<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Freya knew very well that even if it was a minor problem, she wouldn't be able to solve it for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Judging from Zheng's expression, he had indeed met with quite a big trouble this time. She had to be as supportive as possible since she could do nothing to help.</p>

  <p>After the divine texture was activated, a purple light enveloped her as her descent rapidly came to a halt, following which, the purple light brought her upwards rapidly.</p>

  <p>Zheng's current falling speed was more than three times faster than before, and he was in a highly tense state from the exertion.</p>

  <p>He hadn't expected that this trip to the underground palace would bring him so much trouble.</p>

  <p>However, nothing was certain in this world. The unexpected was bound to happen, and everyone's life was different. Zheng's fate was not predetermined and could not be predicted.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, what Luo Zheng was facing now was a serious dilemma, but not a hopeless one.</p>

  <p>Now he had to seize the time to explore the Endless Abyss first. Long ago, Xun had stopped at the fourth lap of the abyss. However, she had come to the conclusion then that there was an even bigger secret hidden in the fifth lap of the abyss. Perhaps that secret could help Luo Zheng to escape from his current predicament.</p>

  <p>The sound of the wind blew crazily in Zheng's ears as his speed became faster and faster in exponential bursts.</p>

  <p>Not long after, he saw another stone platform appear in front of him.</p>

  <p>"The third cave!" Zheng's gaze froze in anticipation and trepidation.</p>

  <p>"You don't need to enter it," Xun stopped him. "There are all kinds of protective treasures scattered around the third cave. Although they are attractive, it will cost a lot of time to obtain them."</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng heard Xun's words, his eyes briefly flashed before he nodded. He did not adjust his position, but continued to descend rapidly, his gaze sweeping past the third cave.</p>

  <p>After quickly dashing past the third cave, Luo Zheng entered the fourth lap of the Endless Abyss with focus and determination.</p>

  <p>"The fourth lap will be a little more troublesome. Be careful," Xun warned.</p>

  <p>"Understood," Luo Zheng replied briskly. At the same time, he held his long sword in his hand, and the dragon scales within his body began to light up as well. His body began to accumulate a vast amount of power as he prepared himself for the unexpected.</p>

  <p>Xun, who had stayed inside Zheng's body, was equally nervous, but when she noted his serious expression, she suddenly smiled confidently.</p>

  <p>Although she had warned Luo Zheng, she still believed that he would be able to make it through the fourth lap. It had to be said that she had put Luo Zheng under a lot of pressure before, in the hopes of preparing him.</p>

  <p>'Rest assured, Luo Zheng. Anyway, I have already been exposed. I will help you with the remaining path in the abyss, ' Xun secretly thought.</p>

  <p>There were Demon Night martial artists present within the Endless Abyss. Moreover, the Saint Lord of the Purple Bamboo Sacred Place stood guard at the entrance of the underground palace, so Xun didn't plan on making any moves first. She had hoped to remain hidden.</p>

  <p>But now, everything had changed. Her biggest enemy, Yao, had already discovered her whereabouts, so there was no longer a need to hide herself. All she needed to do now was to help Luo Zheng through the Endless Abyss.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng kept plunging downward at meteoric speeds. Not long after, the sounds of ghosts' woeful wailing suddenly echoed up from the bottom of the abyss. Waves of eerie ghost Mu Ning were being transmitted from below, as if there were tens of thousands of ghosts wailing down there. At this moment, the Endless Abyss seemed to have been transformed into an abyss that led straight to hell.</p>

  <p>"Roar! Roar!"</p>

  <p>"Awoo..."</p>

  <p>There were countless densely packed gatherings of ghosts surrounding the wall.</p>

  <p>Some of these ghosts were big and some were small. Even in death, they had as much diversity as they had held in life. When they heard the commotion above them, they all raised their heads. Then they discovered Luo Zheng, and they all opened their mouths and began to roar with a terrible hunger.</p>

  <p>Faced with such a large number of ghosts, Luo Zheng did not hesitate at all.</p>

  <p>Instead he charged straight down.</p>

  <p>Of course, there was no use in hesitating. There was no way for him to fly, and he had no other way to avoid these ghosts, unless he crushed the divine texture and left the Endless Abyss, but that would be an unrealistic idea. Luo Zheng would not abandon his quest.</p>

  <p>Due to Zheng's fast speed, the gatherings of ghosts did not have any time to react before Luo Zheng shot into them.</p>

  <p>However, after he sped downwards a few miles, the ghosts that were clinging onto the wall had finally reacted. They jumped off from the wall ahead of time, and rushed to surround Luo Zheng with an awful intent.</p>

  <p>"Awoo�"</p>

  <p>A ghost that looked like a gorilla had leaped from the wall. Its entire body was emitting a pure black ghost Mu Ning. It was about to grapple with Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes flashed vehemently, and he thrust out the Thunder Wind Divine Sword with his mighty hand.</p>

  <p>These ghosts did not possess any physical bodies, so the Nether God Shadow and the wind blades were unable to cause any harm to them, but thunder could ward off evil spirits, so it had a miraculously powerful effect on them. Zheng's Thunder Wind Divine Sword lashed out with tremendous force and energy, shattering the ghosts.</p>

  <p>Knowing that the wind blades could have no effect, Luo Zheng had only activated the Thunder Law within the Thunder Wind Divine Sword.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>An azure bolt of lightning streaked across the pitch-black abyss, reflecting off the densely packed ghosts on both sides of the abyss. The scene could have made one's blood freeze. It was a vision of hell!</p>

  <p>The bolt of lightning struck the gorilla-like ghost's body, instantly causing it to vanish into thin air.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng's attack did not intimidate these ghosts. Instead, it had only served to incite their fierceness.</p>

  <p>One ghost after another raced along the wall with the intent to pounce on Luo Zheng. At the same time, Luo Zheng suddenly heard various beastly howls from above. It turned out that the ghosts that Luo Zheng had swept past, had left the wall and were chasing down after him.</p>

  <p>However, their speed of descent was far inferior to Zheng's, so they had been left far behind by Luo Zheng. As more and more ghosts flew past, they tightly blocked the top of the abyss.</p>

  <p>That was to say, Zheng's surroundings, including the space above his head, were now filled with ghosts. The air became littered with the incorporeal shapes and their howls became an endless drone which proliferated in the abyss.</p>

  <p>"All of you, go to hell!"</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>As the bolts of lightning reverberated in the abyss, the ghosts were killed by the lightning bolts released from the Thunder Wind Divine Sword.</p>

  <p>However, there were simply too many of them! Even though Luo Zheng brandished the sword crazily, he couldn't kill all of them in his charge by using his strength alone.</p>

  <p>A ghost finally struck Luo Zheng and attached itself onto his body. Although it was light and weightless, the moment it touched Zheng's body, streams of dark energy invaded his body. Luo Zheng felt an instant drain of his energy as the ghost began to suck the life from him.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng deftly turned his sword. He did not shoot out a single bolt of lightning, but rather, created a glittering arc that circled around his body like a silver dragon.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The lightning once again shattered the ghost and Luo Zheng felt a release from the pressure of the ghost draining him.</p>

  <p>However, three ghosts now attached themselves to Zheng's body as soon as he killed the first one.</p>

  <p>"Awoooo..."</p>

  <p>As the number of ghosts attached to Zheng's body increased, the streams of dark energy continued to invade his body with increasing intensity.</p>

  <p>The dark energy was very special and insidious. Although it did not cause much pain to Luo Zheng, other than the cold, he soon felt his reaction speed begin to slow down.</p>

  <p>"Awoooo..."</p>

  <p>As Zheng's speed fell, more ghosts attached themselves to him and clambered all over his body.</p>

  <p>Ten, a hundred, a thousand�</p>

  <p>Seen from a distance, Zheng's figure had completely disappeared. The ghosts clung to each other, tightly wrapping around Luo Zheng and forming a huge round ball that slowly fell towards the bottom of the abyss. He seemed to have become completely lost in the ghostly attack.</p>

  <p>The bodies of these ghosts were extremely light, but as Luo Zheng was wrapped by them, his falling speed had been greatly reduced.</p>

  <p>"What should I do?" Still wrapped within the ghosts, Luo Zheng knitted his brows in consternation. Even though he could use the Thunder Wind Divine Sword to release lightning, with every lightning bolt being able to annihilate dozens of ghosts, the speed at which he could kill them was far from being able to match the speed at which these ghosts were latching on.</p>

  <p>The most troublesome thing was, as the dark energy attacked him, Zheng's body and his reactions became slower and slower, and his speed plummeted.</p>

  <p>He had tried to expel the dark energy, but it seemed to be useless. The dark energy circulated rapidly throughout his body and even moved through his meridians, approaching his belly with every second that he was being invaded by the ghosts!</p>

  <p>Xun's voice sounded very faint as she spoke from within Luo Zheng. She could feel his anxiousness and quietly said, "Let me deal with them."</p>

  <p>At this moment, Xun's figure left the protection of Zheng's body, and expanded to overlap with the ghosts. At the same time, a red light passed through the endless space and gathered all over her body.</p>

  <p>Previously, Xun had been afraid of exposing her location, so she did not dare to use her own Pool of Faith. But now, having already been discovered, she no longer feared anything.</p>
