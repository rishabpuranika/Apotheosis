<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As the pressure of gravity that was exerted on the Evil God increased, he was rendered powerless and couldn't escape the situation he was in.</p>

  <p>If he continued freefalling at such a rapid pace, it wouldn't be long before he smashed into the ground forcefully. Even he wouldn't be able to bear the repercussions.</p>

  <p>When the distance between him and the ground decreased to less than two hundred feet, he shut his eyes bracing for impact. A trace of ruthlessness was smeared across his face.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a wild stream of energy rushed out!</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>It was like something as big and bright as the sun had exploded and sent ripples surging across the ground. A massive crater thumped to the surface with the Evil God lying inside.</p>

  <p>"That damned woman..." he cursed under his breath, his voice barely audible from the pressure of the air.</p>

  <p>After that, his head smashed against a weighty object as he finally collapsed on the ground.</p>

  <p>It almost made him faint, but he resisted the concussion.</p>

  <p>Attempting to get a hold of his senses, he shook his head several times and held it firmly. After he blinked several times, he noticed a black token lying near his feet. He picked it up carefully and flicked it to study it from all sides. It had a strange pattern carved into it. Other than that, there was nothing else worth looking at.</p>

  <p>As the Evil God got back up on his feet, he put away the token safely.</p>

  <p>Looking around his surroundings, he cursed Shera again, blaming her for his ordeal before climbing out of his self-made pit.</p>

  <p>The moment he climbed out, his ears alerted him to rustling sounds coming from a distance. As he looked in the direction of the noise, two wolves that were the size of humans lurking nearby enveloped his view.</p>

  <p>When their eyes fell on the Evil God, they gleamed under the dark as they spotted their prey.</p>

  <p>'You want to eat me now, huh?'</p>

  <p>A cold smile stretched across the face of the Evil God as he fearlessly continued walking in the direction of the Black Mountain Guild.</p>

  <p>Just as he turned around casually, the two wolves took advantage of the moment and pounced on him aggressively.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, two balls of light filled with massive energy erupted from behind the Evil God's back.</p>

  <p>The wolves whimpered in pain as they got crushed by the Ways-blending Energy.</p>

  <p>"It seems beasts will always be beasts..."</p>

  <p>The Evil God glanced back at the broken limbs splayed on the ground of the two black wolves and shook his head.</p>

  <p>When he turned his head back to look ahead, he frowned.</p>

  <p>He rolled his eyes as he examined the sunken ravine straight ahead. Strange creatures of all shapes and sizes made themselves known as they appeared before him from it. Some as big as a leopard, some as small as mice, but each of them was powerful. Other creatures of unfamiliar forms were among them too.</p>

  <p>"So, Shera has thrown me into the lair of beasts!" Pleased by how it all turned out for him, the Evil God laughed violently. He could feel the killing intent buried deep within him reignite as he glared back at the creatures.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the beast in the lead walked up and spoke in an authoritative voice. "Human! Hand over the Black Mountain Token in your hand!" The creature stretched out its palm as if to gesture the Evil God to give it up.</p>

  <p>"The Black Mountain Token is not something for you to take. If you give it to us, we will go easy on you and grant you a painless death!" Another beast came forward and erupted in frustration.</p>

  <p>Some of them stood behind in the ranks, and hissed at the Evil God who stood arrogantly.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, all sorts of noises began to surround him as the creatures howled declaring war.</p>

  <p>It so happened, the reason the two wolves attacked him in the first place was to retrieve the Black Mountain Token from him.</p>

  <p>Black Mountain Guild was very important to these creatures. It was well-known around these parts. It was willing to admit beasts from any race.</p>

  <p>Such a place was perfect for the nonhuman creatures who roamed the lands alone and hadn't been born in a strong group.</p>

  <p>Since it was a highly regarded place, getting access to it wasn't easy. It was close to impossible for these creatures to obtain the Black Mountain Token.</p>

  <p>In fact, some beasts that resided near Black Mountain Guild fought and ate each other, simply to get a Black Mountain Token.</p>

  <p>Sensing overwhelming aggression soaring from the creatures, the Evil God slowly began to let his arrogance fade.</p>

  <p>Although Shera didn't tell him anything about the Black Mountain Token, it was still evident the token could get him into the Black Mountain Guild.</p>

  <p>Each of these creatures stood in their ranks stationing themselves, ready to attack. But then, diamond-shaped light rings appeared under the Evil God's feet.</p>

  <p>Due to receiving some guidance recently, he had managed to reach a new level of Ways-blending Energy.</p>

  <p>As he stood there gathering all his energy, the creatures all dashed towards him to not give him the window to counterattack.</p>

  <p>"Tear him apart!"</p>

  <p>"That Black Mountain Token belongs to me!"</p>

  <p>The beasts roared violently with bloodshot eyes. They gathered motivation from one another's words and charged towards the Evil God.</p>

  <p>Right then, a piercing noise exploded and filled the air with its dominance.</p>

  <p>As the creatures gathered around the Evil God like moths to a flame, the rings of light exploded layer by layer in the air.</p>

  <p>An incandescent shock wave spread out far and wide like a fountain overflowing with energy.</p>

  <p>With the help of the impact force, the Evil God boosted himself forward like an arrow shot from a bow.</p>

  <p>Some of the beasts perished under the influence of the Ways-blending Energy, while the rest chased after him. They were unfazed by their fallen companions.</p>

  <p>These creatures inhabited near the Black Mountain Guild had grown up witnessing massacre and slaughter. Death wasn't something that could scare them, it was a common occurrence to them. Even though the Evil God's spectacle of strength was frightening, he failed to intimidate them.</p>

  <p>Squeak! Squeak! Squeak</p>

  <p>An extremely agile grey mouse leaped up towards the back of the Evil God amidst the commotion.</p>

  <p>Before it could cause much damage, he crushed it using his aura. However, the mouse had already succeeded in ripping off a piece of his flesh from his shoulder.</p>

  <p>Just then, a gigantic beast the size of an elephant used a long whip covered in thorns to slash at the back of the Evil God.</p>

  <p>It caused his clothes to tear apart as blood gushed out from his flesh. He almost staggered after getting attacked as he groaned in pain.</p>

  <p>'If I let these monsters surround me, I'm afraid I'll lose my limbs. Damn that Shera!' he cursed at her again in his heart to not voice his fears out to the beasts that chased after him.</p>

  <p>His journey in the Black Ship had caused him to expand his knowledge about a lot of things and broadened his perspective.</p>

  <p>Although Shera was an arrogant woman, she still helped the Evil God rebuild his points of view on many things.</p>

  <p>She had told him that Ways-blending Energy was pointless and even warned him that some people had failed to try to succeed in this respect.</p>

  <p>Instead, she gave him the suggestion of an alternative method he could use.</p>

  <p>Ignoring her advice at first, he stood firm on the fact that these energies would be mixed with each other sooner or later.</p>

  <p>But eventually, he gave up and decided to listen to her. After all, she was the woman who promised him freedom from the Rebirth Land that restrained him. In exchange for that, he was tasked to reach the Chaotic Source Realm.</p>

  <p>However, to enter the Chaotic Source Realm, one had to go to the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>The time when the doors of the Chaotic Source World would open was already drawing near. Time was running out of his hands like grains of sand. He had to increase his cultivation quickly before that happened.</p>

  <p>This was the reason why Shera had thrown him down from the Black Ship, to send him off into the Black Mountain Guild for cultivation.</p>

  <p>This guild housed many different races within it, and at times it was very chaotic. Killing and conspiring against each other was a common practice in there. It only produced the most ruthless warriors.</p>

  <p>It wasn't just a place for cultivation, but to test your survival instincts as well.</p>

  <p>The Evil God continued to rush his way away from the creatures for tens of miles without stopping and entered a ravine.</p>

  <p>Just as he walked inside, the beasts stopped chasing after him and stopped.</p>

  <p>"What should we do now? He has reached the gate of the Black Mountain Guild!"</p>

  <p>"We have no Black Mountain Token. Anyone who dares to step in there without a Black Mountain Token will surely die."</p>

  <p>"Let's just go. That human brat got lucky. But I know he won't be able to survive half a day inside the Black Mountain Guild!"</p>

  <p>As those creatures slowly dispersed and disappeared into the dark, the Evil God watched as his face declared a hint of viciousness.</p>

  <p>He had always been the one who would try to kill others, how could he swallow the insult of being the one hunted instead?</p>

  <p>At that point, he decided and wrote it on his flesh, once he made some achievements in the Black Mountain Guild, he would come back and annihilate all of them!</p>

  <p>When he thought of this, he felt a faint trace of cold air tickle his neck. Just then, he sensed an unsettling presence approach him from behind. A miserable voice echoed in his ears and caused him to turn around. "Human, do you have a Black Mountain Token?"</p>

  <p>He glanced in the direction of the sound and saw pieces of ragged cloth drifting in the air, beneath which was a skeleton. It was unknown to what creature it had belonged before, and on the back of the skeleton was a pair of folded wing bones.</p>

  <p>Witnessing a live structure of bones, the pupils in his eyes shrank as he handed over the token obediently.</p>

  <p>"All warriors of our Black Mountain Guild who have survived to get out of here are formidable. But I hope you can live to see that day. Hahaha...</p>

  <p>Follow me!"</p>

  <p>The skeleton let out a horrific laugh and turned around while gesturing him to follow after. The Evil God walked behind it with determined eyes, letting the darkness devour his existence.</p>
