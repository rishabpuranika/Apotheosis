<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Even though the Ear Mouse had specified some flaws regarding the Other Shore Token, it was still undeniably powerful.</p>

  <p>This Other Shore Token was the most powerful treasure of the Star Falcon race. It could also be activated on the Other Shore and be turned into a powerful Three-eyed Dragon Sparrow.</p>

  <p>The Ear Mice had their eyes on the Other Shore Token for a long time.</p>

  <p>However, the Star Falcon race would not give in no matter how grand the price they were offered.</p>

  <p>Now that the Star Falcon race had been exterminated, their most powerful treasure fell into the hands of Zheng.</p>

  <p>Although the Other Shore Token was extremely powerful, Zheng wanted something else.</p>

  <p>As he noticed that Feng Ge was actually interested in it, he asked, "What kind of Truth of Godly Way is needed to fuse with this Other Shore Token?"</p>

  <p>He thought that if the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent didn't match the Other Shore Token, Feng Ge might not be able to merge with it.</p>

  <p>"The Truth of Cultivation Nature," the Ear Mouse quickly replied.</p>

  <p>Zheng stared at Feng Ge's face. As he was about to speak, Feng Ge said, "I've already successfully cultivated the Truth of Cultivation Nature."</p>

  <p>She was indeed very talented. Even Flamine once said that Feng Ge matched the Truth of Cultivation Nature to a high degree. It was just that her cultivation was restricted when she was young.</p>

  <p>However, as Feng Ge had gone deeper and deeper in the Other Shore Realm, these restrictions were gradually lifted and ceased to exist.</p>

  <p>"Then that's great. You can take this Other Shore Token and fuse with it,"</p>

  <p>Zheng added with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>Since she really wanted it, Feng Ge didn't decline the offer and gladly accepted the Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>After that, Zheng gazed across the table and looked at the other items present.</p>

  <p>The two Ear Mice were very considerate in answering all of Zheng's queries about the items. They had a deep understanding of every Other Shore Token, which impressed Zheng very much.</p>

  <p>After some time of thorough inspection, he wasn't able to find an Other Shore Token that would be suitable for him to fuse with. However, there was a long sword that caught his attention.</p>

  <p>The long sword turned out to be forged by the Riverside race. There were layers of cloud patterns on the sword, and the structure was very complicated and exquisite.</p>

  <p>"This sword is a precious one from the Riverside race. If it were assessed as an Other Shore Token, it would easily be considered as a fourth-grade one in Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore," an Ear Mouse explained.</p>

  <p>"Really? I want this one," Zheng responded.</p>

  <p>"Do you want to fuse with it as an Other Shore Token?" the Ear Mouse asked.</p>

  <p>An Other Shore Token could be used as a weapon, but Zheng had something else in mind.</p>

  <p>"No, I don't," Zheng smiled faintly as he shook his head. "I would use this one as my accompanying sword on the Other Shore."</p>

  <p>Zheng had already entered the Other Shore for a long time, but he didn't have a decent weapon. He was just basically fighting with his bare hands. He thought that this might be a good choice to have a long, handy sword.</p>

  <p>After selecting the Other Shore Tokens, they had to consider going to the higher stages of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>If the one-eyed monsters got a hold of any Dark Nether Bugs in the Dark Region, they would give them to the Insect Master race. After they returned to Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore later, they would surely come get them.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge was totally determined to follow Zheng to the higher stages.</p>

  <p>At the gate of the Myriad Spirits City, Raul and Clyde saw them off in person. As soon as Zheng left, the entire Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore was managed by the two races.</p>

  <p>Before leaving, Zheng quickly asked, "Has Dorothy entered the Myriad Spirits City?"</p>

  <p>"Well, not recently," one of the Guide Weasels replied.</p>

  <p>"Should I go to the Origin Mountain and see her?" Zheng turned to Feng Ge and asked.</p>

  <p>When he went back to the Land of Sword Grief, Chaim filled him in on what had happened to the Origin Mountain. This made Zheng quite concerned about Dorothy.</p>

  <p>"The Origin Mountain is in a state of anxiety right now. I think it won't be wise for you to go there at this moment. Plus, there are so many powerful warriors in the Origin Mountain. I think Dorothy would be safe in their hands." Feng Ge tried to comfort him.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing this, Zheng nodded in agreement.</p>

  <p>Zheng exhorted Clyde for a while. He told him that all the resources should be distributed according to Chaim's requirements. However, he instructed that Dorothy must be able to have any resources she needed, including Zheng's resources, once she entered the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, Zheng also left some resources specifically for the Evil God.</p>

  <p>Since the Evil God entered the secluded cultivation room, Zheng had never disturbed him. He didn't know if the Evil God would be able to leave the Lust World and enter the Desire World in a short time, but he hoped he would have great progress while he was away.</p>

  <p>In the outside world, since the Evil God had become Zheng's Inner-world Generating Avatar, Zheng was able to interfere with the Evil God's actions at any time. However, that wouldn't be the case as he entered the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Zheng would not be able to know what the Evil God was doing, and so he had no choice but to trust him and let him proceed on his own.</p>

  <p>In the Lust World, the stages of the Other Shore were interconnected by star rings, and very race had an independent star ring. The same went for the Desire World.</p>

  <p>At the north of Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore, star rings were neatly placed.</p>

  <p>Although Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore had always been the home field of the Sun Crow race, the Star Falcon race had failed to occupy the Myriad Spirits City. Thus, the Star Falcon race wasn't able to control the star rings to collect the soul pills, failing the attempt to imitate what the Separate Abyss race did in Stage Eleven of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>As Zheng walked towards the star rings, he briefly stopped in his tracks.</p>

  <p>"Is there something wrong?" Feng Ge asked as she noticed Zheng's behavior.</p>

  <p>"I just thought of a serious problem." Zheng looked at her with a quaint smile.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if we can pass it successfully this time,"</p>

  <p>As a purified being, Feng Ge had gotten into great trouble when she crossed the energy vortex which connected the Lust World and the Desire World.</p>

  <p>This also almost caused Zheng to die. Though the circumstance later turned to be a blessing in disguise, Zheng didn't want such a dangerous thing to happen again.</p>

  <p>Theoretically, a purified being shouldn't be able to leave a certain stage of the Other Shore. Otherwise, it would not be appropriate for them to serve as the ruler of that stage.</p>

  <p>"We just have to give it a try!"</p>

  <p>Feng Ge didn't give it too much thought and seemed quite confident instead.</p>

  <p>She was a smart and wise woman. In the past, it was impossible for her to act so recklessly in any situation. However, ever since she experienced a few difficult crises with Zheng, she developed an attitude of trusting Zheng no matter how bad the situation had gotten.</p>

  <p>As a result, this hurdle seemed to be nothing for her since she was with Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Well, yeah, you're right. We'll never know if we don't try. I'll go in first,"</p>

  <p>Zheng answered, nodding his head.</p>

  <p>To be on the safe side, he took the initiative to step into the star ring first.</p>

  <p>As the star ring released traces of white light, Zheng felt like his body was being disintegrated.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Outside, Feng Ge saw that the star ring shot out rays of white light upwards.</p>

  <p>A nervous smile crept up at the corners of her mouth. "Everything is fine, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>As Zheng disappeared, she also stepped into the star ring and flew towards Stage Fifteen of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Both of them felt relieved as they realized that what they worried about didn't happen. Both Zheng and Feng Ge smoothly reached Stage Fifteen of the Other Shore. Perhaps it was because they were not Other Shore creatures that the rule preventing the stage ruler from traversing to other stages of the Other Shore didn't take effect.</p>

  <p>As soon as they reached the next stage, the anxiousness that they earlier felt dissipated.</p>

  <p>As Zheng left the star ring, a dark world immediately emerged in front of him.</p>

  <p>He perceived that the Dark Region existed in all directions, and felt a strange sensation within him.</p>

  <p>"Stage Fifteen of the Other Shore… is a complete Dark Region?" Zheng couldn't believe what he saw.</p>

  <p>"I've heard a long time ago that Stage Fifteen of the Other Shore had almost been completely eroded by the Dark Region, except for the center area. I didn't expect that the Dark Region was still expanding up until now. It seems that even the center area is being devoured," Feng Ge said softly behind Zheng, also surprised at the gloomy sight.</p>

  <p>The entire Stage Fifteen of the Other Shore, except the area where the star rings were placed, was engulfed by the Dark Region. For ordinary people, there was no value in this and it would just be a waste of time to explore this stage.</p>
