<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1040 One Ten-millionth Of Power </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Warm blood continued to gush out from the girls' necks, and then it soaked their clothes. Zheng's heart sank as he watched. Countless thoughts raced in his mind.</p>

  <p>Red blood continued to spill out of Yan's neck. She was losing her life fast.</p>

  <p>Millions of miles away from the Central Region, strange birds circled a desolate mountain beneath the vast sky.</p>

  <p>All of the strange birds spread out their wide, expansive wings, which looked like the size of a small universe.</p>

  <p>On a closer look, there were many living creatures that tried to settle down on the birds' bodies. Some of them were even warriors who tried to cultivate on the birds' wings, in hopes of flying into the Upper World one day.</p>

  <p>But however large the strange birds were, they were nothing compared to the massive mountain behind them. They were like small black dots on the largest sheet of paper.</p>

  <p>Because of the mountain's colossal size that exceeded people's imaginations, its height was difficult to measure. No one could see the entire mountain even from any angle.</p>

  <p>On the mountain peak, several people quietly sat down as they gazed at the chaotic turn of events in the distance.</p>

  <p>Nobody knew how much time they had been sitting there. It could be a day or a thousand years, even.</p>

  <p>For them however, time seemed to stop and flow quickly in succession. A thousand years could pass in a blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>"There seems to be a problem. The pointer is about to die," a young man who wore a feathered crest said.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I feel it too. If we don't do anything, then we will meet a dead end."</p>

  <p>Another white-haired old man nodded slightly.</p>

  <p>"Do something then," said the young man.</p>

  <p>Before either of them could respond, they were cut off by another voice.</p>

  <p>"I won't.</p>

  <p>The guy couldn't even protect his sister. Why did you choose him? He's not the only one who can lead the world of chaos! Can't you just pick another one?" a chubby man who stood at the edge of the mountain said.</p>

  <p>He shook his fat head to reject the young man's earlier suggestion when no one seemed to agree with him.</p>

  <p>"You don't know. He is very special, and the Heavenly Fragment is already in his hands," the young man muttered.</p>

  <p>"If you want to help him, do it by yourself. I don't want to get myself involved," the fat man said in refusal.</p>

  <p>"Alright, I'll go by myself!"</p>

  <p>With a huff, the young man disappeared from the mountain peak.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, time passed quietly in the Ethereal Spirit Hall.</p>

  <p>Every passing second sent a jolt of pain to Zheng's heart. Every time he watched the girls' bloody necks, he felt shattered.</p>

  <p>However, he couldn't do anything to help.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, Eden felt like he was on top of the world.</p>

  <p>His eyes proudly looked at Luo Zheng. He clearly felt the pain within Zheng's heart, and the more pain Luo Zheng felt, the happier he was. This was exactly what he wanted!</p>

  <p>"Don't worry. These girls will definitely die sooner or later," Eden cooed mockingly. He didn't want anything else. He only wanted to break Zheng's heart, and that was enough.</p>

  <p>Dillon and the others were at a loss as well. Who would've thought that they would run into a lunatic in the Ethereal Spirit Sect? They couldn't do anything at all.</p>

  <p>While the two sides were in a stalemate, a faint beam of light suddenly flashed in the sky, which enveloped the entire Ethereal Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>Although the light emitted a gentle glow, it was so powerful that it seemed to have engulfed their boundless world.</p>

  <p>It was too much that even a little bit of the light's power was enough to destroy the entire Central Region.</p>

  <p>Under the faint light, they were all shocked to discover that they couldn't move a muscle.</p>

  <p>Being motionless felt quite strange. At that moment, their eyes couldn't blink, and they couldn't even breathe. Even their blood stopped flowing in their veins.</p>

  <p>Eden, Luo Zheng, and everyone else in the hall stood still and unmoving like marble statues.</p>

  <p>After the flash of the faint, powerful light appeared a person out of thin air.</p>

  <p>A young man with an exquisite feathered crest on his head emerged. He seemed to be in his early twenties, but everyone felt as if he had experienced a million years of transformations.</p>

  <p>Fear was written all over Eden's face at the sight of the man. However, he couldn't move at all, and much less kill Yan.</p>

  <p>The young man walked towards Eden and stopped just in front of him. He then extended a finger and lightly tapped his forehead with a gentle touch.</p>

  <p>It looked like he didn't use much strength.</p>

  <p>What happened next shook everyone to their core. Eden disappeared completely in a blink of an eye, and so did the life vitality threads that were tied around the two girls' necks.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes twitched slightly as he felt unease rise in his chest. Who was this man?</p>

  <p>Why was he so strong?</p>

  <p>After Eden had vanished, the young man flashed a warm smile at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Right after that, Luo Zheng, Owen, Dillon, and the rest found that their hands and feet were back to their normal state.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" Dillon asked with an aghast expression.</p>

  <p>No one in the hall knew who this strange and powerful man was.</p>

  <p>Even the three fat leaders also felt the man's strength.</p>

  <p>This young man with a feathered crest was not at either the Life and Death Realm or the Soul Sea Realm. He must be an even more powerful warrior, but none of them knew how exactly powerful he was.</p>

  <p>The young man didn't respond to Dillon, and didn't even spare him a glance at all. Instead, he turned his gaze towards Luo Zheng and smiled.</p>

  <p>"I came to take Yan away."</p>

  <p>"No way!" Luo Zheng coldly refused.</p>

  <p>"I've already broken the rules by taking her away now," the man said and shook his head. "There's no other way. If I hadn't come, Yan would've been dead by now. Next time, there would be no such opportunity."</p>

  <p>But even if this man was so strong to the point where Luo Zheng couldn't comprehend, Luo Zheng would never let him take his sister away. He had fought so hard to defeat Eddie and finally got a chance to reunite with Yan. But he hadn't even said a single word to her, so how could he let the man take her away?</p>

  <p>"I know what you think, but Yan won't be in any danger if she follows me," the young man continued to smile when he eyed Zheng's persistent gaze.</p>

  <p>"That's not what I'm worried about. Yan is my sister, so I won't allow anyone to take her away," Luo Zheng said icily.</p>

  <p>The young man softly smiled. "Can you stop me?"</p>

  <p>"If I don't give it a try, how would I know?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng walked towards Yan as he spoke. Although her neck was injured, she couldn't feel any pain as her six senses were sealed.</p>

  <p>At that moment, a red beam of light flashed and Xun appeared next to Luo Zheng. She looked at the young man in shock and shouted, "Luo Zheng, don't go there!"</p>

  <p>As the queen of the Demon Night, Xun had never looked at anyone like that until now.</p>

  <p>Although she was almost a world lord, she had encountered numerous powerhouses. A Soul Sea Realm powerhouse, or even a Supreme Lord wouldn't be able to make her look that alarmed.</p>

  <p>"You are the little girl from the Demon Night who is in charge of killings."</p>

  <p>The young man smiled and nodded at Xun.</p>

  <p>After Xun became the Queen of Killings, she had lived for many years in the Demon Night. However, she was still a little girl for the young man.</p>

  <p>Thus, Luo Zheng couldn't even imagine how long this man had been alive.</p>

  <p>"Yan is Zheng's pointer. The two of them complement each other. It's not good for you to take her away like this," Xun shifted her gaze to the young man and pleaded.</p>

  <p>"Rather than making her suffer, it's better to go to the last step and take her away. If Luo Zheng has the strength, she will still guide him up the mountain," the young man replied.</p>

  <p>No words came out of Xun's lips. She knew that she couldn't change the young man's mind. Even if she held a high position in the Demon Night, the young man was much stronger than her.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng wouldn't give his sister up to the young man that easily. He ignored the young man and Xun's conversation and continued to walk towards Yan. He felt a pang in his heart when he saw Yan's six senses that were sealed. He wanted to remove the seal on her.</p>

  <p>"Don't go any further." The young man stopped in front of Luo Zheng and stretched out a finger. "I don't want to leave a shadow on your warrior spirit.</p>

  <p>If you go forward, I'll let you feel my power!"</p>

  <p>"Your power?" Luo Zheng raised his eyebrows and glared at the young man.</p>

  <p>"Yes, one ten-millionth of my power." The young man smiled.</p>

  <p>He stretched a finger out, and then circles of light spread out from his fingertip.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng saw the light, his face became serious.</p>

  <p>Was that really just one ten-millionth of his power?</p>
