<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Back then on the path of heavens, Zheng's father had given him several methods to expand his inner world.</p>

  <p>There were several ways to do so. One of them was to incorporate more life vitality into the body, and then gradually expand the entirety of the inner world.</p>

  <p>Most people adopted this specific method as it was the most reliable.</p>

  <p>However, this method also resulted in the slowest speed of expansion.</p>

  <p>While others needed to include the life vitality to execute this method, Luo Zheng needed to incorporate chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>During this period of time, he had tried to increase the speed at which the World Tree absorbed the chaotic energy to expand his inner world. To his disappointment however, the effects weren't as apparent as he had expected.</p>

  <p>Another method to expand one's inner world was to use brute force.</p>

  <p>Although the inner world might end up weak if one used this method to break it and rebuild it, the foreign force that would be channeled to the inner world could break through the inner world's boundaries in a short period of time. Thus, the desired effect of expansion would be achieved.</p>

  <p>However, there were devastating consequences for the lives that resided in the inner world. Therefore, a person who chose this method should make the necessary preparations before taking their plan into action.</p>

  <p>Now, Luo Zheng had currently used the second method.</p>

  <p>The difference was that Luo Zheng did not draw the spinulose wood fern's power to his inner world himself, and the power was too overwhelming.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Luo Zheng felt as if his inner world was about to collapse from the power.</p>

  <p>Yet, his inner world had expanded tenfold and had managed to stabilize itself, preventing its collapse.</p>

  <p>After the ten thousand eight hundred Sanskrit words had stabilized, they quickly released beams of golden light which then crossed Zheng's inner world. They converged continuously to the center until they had gradually formed a golden pillar of light.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>At that point, the golden pillar of light soared into the sky and merged with the killing power.</p>

  <p>The pillar of light crashed against the killing power and in the end, had extinguished the killing power. It continued to expand in the air until it had quickly reached the height of the nine stars, passed the height of the Godly Plate, and shot itself directly towards the inner world's peak.</p>

  <p>A slight heat warmed Zheng's elixir field; then he felt a scorching hot sensation. A beam of light the size of a thumb immediately hit the spinulose wood fern.</p>

  <p>Pah!</p>

  <p>The golden light beam was instantly submerged into the spinulose wood fern, which subsequently stopped spinning. Then, it quietly floated in the air without making any movements.</p>

  <p>Not too far away stood an astonished Maha, who couldn't understand what had just happened. Just what was that golden light that came out from Zheng's elixir field? Why had he lost his connection with the spinulose wood fern?</p>

  <p>And most importantly, why was Luo Zheng still safe and sound?</p>

  <p>After a short while, a cracking sound was heard.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The surfaces of the verdant and glistening spinulose wood fern began to crack.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>The cracks continued to spread throughout the spinulose wood fern, until they covered the entire surface area.</p>

  <p>Then, the spinulose wood fern suddenly collapsed in front of Maha and Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Right after, the momentum that had affected many great supreme worlds was completely gone.</p>

  <p>At the same time the spinulose wood fern collapsed, the heavens in the Murphy Universe began to shake violently. All the Supreme Lords who were presently in it felt the tremors.</p>

  <p>In the Murphy Universe</p>

  <p>The most magnificent Holy Spirit Palace of the Sacred race was empty, except for the presence of a middle-aged man with hair that hung down to his shoulders.</p>

  <p>It could be said that his appearance was seventy percent similar to Maha's. After all, he was Maha's father, the Grand Supreme Lord of the Sacred race.</p>

  <p>Behind him was a huge spinulose wood fern. This colossal spinulose wood fern was the real body of the Heavens-suppressing Object, and what Maha had used was simply one of its branches.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>A crisp sound reverberated throughout the hall, and one branch of the spinulose wood fern suddenly broke off. It fell down to the floor and was shattered into numerous emerald green granules that scattered everywhere.</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Lord couldn't help the shiver that ran down his spine.</p>

  <p>This Heavens-suppressing Object didn't belong to him, but rather to Murphy.</p>

  <p>In theory, it was almost impossible to destroy a Heavens-suppressing Object, or at least not in any universe. That was why the Grand Supreme Lord gave one of the spinulose wood fern's branches to Maha; the branch could be considered as Maha's talisman, and his trump card. The branch could summon the spinulose wood fern to use the momentum of the Murphy Universe to kill anyone at all.</p>

  <p>After it was used, the branch would return to the spinulose wood fern.</p>

  <p>However, the branch did not return and instead, was broken into pieces!</p>

  <p>What used to be the perfect spinulose wood fern was no more, as it was missing one of its branches.</p>

  <p>This Heavens-suppressing Object was extremely important to Murphy, but it had gotten broken in the hands of the Grand Supreme Lord. How could he explain this to Murphy?</p>

  <p>"Just what kind of existence is in the Evolutionary Universe? It can directly shatter a Heavens-suppressing Object. Oh, my Maha..." the Grand Supreme Lord lamented. If that was truly the case, then Maha's life was also in danger!</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Maha stood completely stunned on the spot.</p>

  <p>His mind was a mess and he couldn't comprehend what had happened before him.</p>

  <p>Why didn't this spinulose wood fern kill Luo Zheng? In fact, Luo Zheng had broken it!</p>

  <p>It was Murphy who had bestowed this Heavens-suppressing Object upon his father. If it was damaged, then Murphy might punish his father.</p>

  <p>Just as his mind had gone blank, a strong force suddenly pulled him forward. By the time he had gotten to react, his face was greeted by Zheng's fist.</p>

  <p>Bam!</p>

  <p>How much power did his punch have? It was imprinted onto his face without any obstruction!</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The treasure on Maha's body automatically moved to protect its master just as Zheng's fist collided with Maha's body. An armor surrounded him and blocked Zheng's strength. If it wasn't for the armor, Maha could've died.</p>

  <p>It was a top-grade defensive treasure from the Murphy Universe� the Red Armor of Heaven's Gift.</p>

  <p>"Huh?" Luo Zheng exclaimed.</p>

  <p>He clearly did not expect Maha to have such a protective treasure. He sneered and threw another punch towards Maha without a second thought.</p>

  <p>Bam!</p>

  <p>Bam!</p>

  <p>Bam!</p>

  <p>Every time a punch hit Maha, blood-red scales would appear around his body like armor.</p>

  <p>The armor could offset most of the power in Zheng's fist. It could be said that this armor was an extraordinary treasure.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Zheng's fist gradually became faster. After dozens of punches, he had finally broken through Maha's defenses.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Maha's body emitted a shattering sound. Red light glowed around him; then all of the red scales began to disintegrate.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had now shattered the Red Armor of Heaven's Gift as well!</p>

  <p>"Again!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng punched once more and this time, he wanted to kill Maha straight.</p>

  <p>A couple more punches and Luo Zheng had thoroughly smashed Maha. How could the latter even have the strength to fight back? He was like a lamb waiting to be slaughtered by now. He had lost almost all of his will to fight.</p>

  <p>"No!"</p>

  <p>A female's voice rang throughout the area.</p>

  <p>A graceful silhouette floated towards Luo Zheng. It was Connie, who had been silently watching the battle from afar.</p>

  <p>The moment she saw that Luo Zheng was about to kill Maha, she disregarded everything and wanted to stop Luo Zheng. Thus, she used the Grand Teleportation to block Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Fuck off!" Luo Zheng roared.</p>

  <p>Maha had various strange methods to protect himself. Therefore, Luo Zheng would never let go of this opportunity to kill him. Moreover, he would never pity a woman from another race.</p>

  <p>Bam!</p>

  <p>Zheng's fist landed on Connie. How would her body withstand his heavy punch? There was a loud, mournful cry, and a figure limply fell down like a piece of cotton. The power of Zheng's punch was enough to kill Connie.</p>

  <p>"Stop!"</p>

  <p>At the same time, a blood-red space crack exploded around Maha, from which a majestic Mu Ning poured out. It was Supreme Lord Barrie, who had used the Grand Teleportation as well to appear beside Maha and protect him.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Barrie worked for Maha and would do anything the latter told him to do. Therefore, he couldn't just sit and watch Maha get killed in front of him.</p>

  <p>When Supreme Lord Barrie appeared, he immediately activated his Heavenly Destiny.</p>

  <p>Just then, a sizzling sound was heard.</p>

  <p>The moment Supreme Lord Barrie had appeared, his whole body was pitch black; but it glimmered under the light. This was the Heavenly Destiny he carried� the Highly Toxic Body.</p>

  <p>The Highly Toxic Body was able to unleash a strong power in a short period of time, which allowed him to be immortal. Furthermore, his strength and the toughness of his body were both increased by several dozen times. In this way, an ordinary Supreme Lord would not be able to do anything to him. He didn't think Luo Zheng could deal with him. After all, Luo Zheng was a mere world lord.</p>

  <p>"I said fuck off!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was already anxious to kill Maha, and punched the Supreme Lord who had appeared square in the gut.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>His supposedly tremendously powerful punch seemed to have turned into a pillow of feathers; it actually failed to harm or damage Supreme Lord Barrie.</p>

  <p>"Hahaha!" Supreme Lord Barrie's lips stretched into a complacent smile.</p>

  <p>He knew that Luo Zheng wouldn't be able to hurt him.</p>

  <p>But just as he was laughing out loud, he saw Luo Zheng lift up the Great Weighty Sword in his hand. A layer of misty light flickered endlessly on the Great Weighty Sword as he swung it towards Supreme Lord Barrie.</p>
