<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2950 The Huge Whirlpool At The Bottom </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Something as enormous as the divine land could only start off at a very slow speed.</p>

  <p>Much like a running elephant, it might start by spinning rather slowly, but if it were to start going faster, it would quickly gain excessive speed.</p>

  <p>As Zheng pushed the two rings on his wrists forward delicately and with precision, the entire divine land began to tremble even more violently.</p>

  <p>Everyone across all the divine land could feel the intense vibration.</p>

  <p>However, the vast majority of people couldn't feel the divine land moving.</p>

  <p>Rumble!</p>

  <p>Zheng had successfully turned the divine land's direction and it began moving forward amidst the chaos.</p>

  <p>"Huh? Something isn't right at the bottom of the divine land!" he exclaimed loudly.</p>

  <p>In that very moment, Zheng felt a violent wave of energy coming from the bottom of the divine land. Its strength was undeniable.</p>

  <p>After fusing with the original will, Zheng was capable of feeling the entire divine land's existence. With such power, he quickly sensed that something was wrong with the divine land's bottom.</p>

  <p>With his own two eyes, he could equally see that the Lethal Fire Magma was flowing down there.</p>

  <p>"Does all of the divine land's driving force come from the Lethal Fire Magma?" he wondered aloud. Zheng's eyes suddenly flashed fiercely.</p>

  <p>The people of the divine land only knew that there was some kind of green liquid somewhere in the deepest depths of the divine land. In fact, this particular liquid was untouchable to all living things in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Even if a Holy Being were to touch it, they would definitely die, despite the power. There was no exception, for anyone.</p>

  <p>In the past, Lorena had killed several Holy Beings by using the Lethal Fire Magma.</p>

  <p>That said, nowhere was there any record of the Lethal Fire Magma's use or origin in all the divine land.</p>

  <p>After all, in places like the Time Sea, Holy Beings had the capacity of exploring the area for themselves. Who would actually go that deep into the Lethal Fire Magma, however?</p>

  <p>Rumble!</p>

  <p>Zheng pressed the rings on his wrists down this time, and the divine land began to move faster and faster. Below him, he also felt the Lethal Fire Magma at the bottom of the divine land gurgling and bubbling, becoming hotter and hotter and reaching boiling point.</p>

  <p>"This speed should be good enough," Zheng murmured to himself.</p>

  <p>Even if the Bear race was well aware of Clement's and his companions' deaths, it would still take them a long time before sending warriors to investigate such a place.</p>

  <p>And by then it would simply be too late. In other words, the divine land would have already reached an extremely high speed, flying away completely from this place.</p>

  <p>The divine land had now officially been activated and it wasn't before long that it no longer needed Zheng's control anymore.</p>

  <p>After disengaging himself from the rings, Zheng could still clearly feel the Lethal Fire Magma billowing at the bottom of the divine land through the original will.</p>

  <p>"I don't think that the Lethal Fire Magma was born out of thin air. In order to drive such a huge divine land, Chiyou must have planted something in the depths of the divine land. I've fused with the original will and therefore, I should've known everything about the divine land. Why can't I find out the Lethal Fire Magma's origin?"</p>

  <p>Once this curiosity arose, Zheng found himself unable to restrain it.</p>

  <p>In the hall, he sat upright and used the original will in order to spread his spiritual sense outward.</p>

  <p>His spiritual sense crossed paths with the sun and headed down from the sky. It pierced through the soft soil, drilled into the rock stratum, travelled across the layer of gangue, the layer of flint and the layer of soft stone, until it ultimately reached the Lethal Fire Magma.</p>

  <p>Prior to now, if his spiritual sense were to travel into the Lethal Fire Magma, it would have been immediately destroyed by the latter.</p>

  <p>This time though, once Zheng had fused with the original will, the Lethal Fire Magma's power was unable to eliminate Zheng's spiritual sense any longer. He was now capable of penetrating it like never before.</p>

  <p>His spiritual sense ran continually through the Lethal Fire Magma. It only took a few moments for Zheng to find that the green liquid was almost everywhere at the bottom of the divine land and was overwhelmingly thick.</p>

  <p>Under ground, the Lethal Fire Magma was like a huge ocean wrapped by the upper layer of soft stones. The ocean was almost as large as the divine land itself!</p>

  <p>In such a vast green ocean, Zheng wouldn't be surprised if any strange creatures were to appear or manifest themselves.</p>

  <p>A brief moment later, Zheng quickly found that he had overthought things a little too much.</p>

  <p>It was safe to say that the Lethal Fire Magma was still a forbidden area to the living beings. Even in the Sun Essence Flame, fire spirits were still born and continued to evolve into strange creatures. However, there was no creature in the Lethal Fire Magma, none at all.</p>

  <p>Plop! Plop!</p>

  <p>As Zheng's spiritual sense rapidly shuttled through the Lethal Fire Magma, he quickly found that the Lethal Fire Magma around him had become even more boiling, if that was even possible.</p>

  <p>The thick green liquid was scalding hot, bubbling and boiling like a pot of water on a heated stove.</p>

  <p>"The abnormal movements should come from up ahead!" Zheng declared.</p>

  <p>After determining the direction, he picked up speed. Soon after, an incredible scene came into view before his very eyes.</p>

  <p>In the center of the Lethal Fire Magma was an enormous green whirlpool. It was something like he'd never seen before.</p>

  <p>With the whirlpool now spinning at such high speed, it stirred the Lethal Fire Magma of the entire divine land. It was an unbelievable sight.</p>

  <p>"Let me come in and have a look!" Zheng couldn't contain his excitement.</p>

  <p>Without hesitating, not even for a second, Zheng injected his spiritual sense directly into the whirlpool, but it disappeared in an instant.</p>

  <p>He lost contact with his own spiritual sense.</p>

  <p>Zheng felt slightly stunned and his face demonstrated his confused emotion.</p>

  <p>Cutting off one's spiritual sense was actually pretty common. So much so, in fact, that even now, if Zheng felt that a True God was spying on him, he'd have the capacity to turn his soul force into a sharp knife and forcefully cut off the other's spiritual sense.</p>

  <p>To put it bluntly, the spiritual sense was nothing more than the extended range of one's soul. It actually contained only a relatively small strength of the soul power.</p>

  <p>Zheng simply couldn't restrain his curiosity and released yet another spiritual sense.</p>

  <p>Now that he knew where the abnormal movements were coming from, he was rather quick this time around. In the blink of an eye, he found the whirlpool, but the situation was exactly the same as the time before. As soon as his spiritual sense was injected into it, it was immediately absorbed.</p>

  <p>Zheng gave up on the third attempt as he knew the result would probably be the same. He had to find another means.</p>

  <p>After thinking for a while, Zheng suddenly made a deduction. This whirlpool was probably related to the fact that he had activated the divine land.</p>

  <p>As this thought lingered in his mind, he once again put the seven rings on his body. As he pulled the rings on his wrists back, the entire divine land slowly stopped spinning. It didn't take long before it was floating once again amidst the chaos, completely motionless.</p>

  <p>On the Floating Island, Emily, Timotheus and the others naturally felt the halt of movement, and their faces displayed sudden expressions of confusion and bewilderment.</p>

  <p>"Zheng had just activated the divine land not long ago, why the hell is he stopping it now, completely out of the blue?" one of them questioned.</p>

  <p>"Did you think he might have found something?" someone else asked.</p>

  <p>As he stopped the divine land from moving, Zheng injected his spiritual sense into the bottom of the divine land once more.</p>

  <p>Just as he had guessed, the huge whirlpool in the Lethal Fire Magma disappeared, and the boiling Lethal Fire Magma gradually calmed down.</p>

  <p>"It appears that this great whirlpool would be the divine land's power source. But what exactly is it?" Zheng asked himself.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng proved his hypothesis, and it appeared to be correct, he was even more curious about this whirlpool than ever before.</p>

  <p>A few seconds later, Zheng started the divine land again and left the palace in the sun, returning to the Floating Island.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, tell me why you stopped the divine land just moments ago?"</p>

  <p>Timotheus asked in absolute confusion. He was afraid that Zheng had encountered a few tough problems.</p>

  <p>Zheng thought for a moment before replying, "I found something strange at the bottom of the divine land, but my spiritual sense can't seem to enter it. I decide to go there myself instead."</p>

  <p>"Huh? The bottom of the divine land?" Leopold raised his eyebrows slightly in curiosity as he asked his question.</p>

  <p>They knew that the bottom of the divine land was full of Lethal Fire Magma. However, even the well-informed Leopold and Timotheus were incapable of determining its origin.</p>

  <p>The warriors at the Other Shore Realm were capable of enduring the burning of the Lethal Fire Magma. That was why Clement had hidden himself in the Lethal Fire Magma in order to escape the punishment of thunder, but it also took a lot of effort to protect his body.</p>
