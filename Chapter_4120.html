<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Everyone in the entire Source World was shocked by the recent events that just unfolded.</p>

  <p>From the super forces in the cities, to even the small races living in the remotest places, everyone discussed amongst themselves and tried to figure out who released that sudden stream of consciousness and resentment.</p>

  <p>Some of them guessed that it was Zheng who had caused all this.</p>

  <p>What happened in the large provinces under the control of the Bearing race was even more bizarre.</p>

  <p>Men made of soil, of all shapes and sizes, appeared in droves and set out to burn, kill, and plunder everything in their path.</p>

  <p>These strange men of soil had varying levels of strength, but all ended up dying by the hands of the warriors of the Bearing race.</p>

  <p>The men of soil that attacked the Moon Shield City of the Blood Sea Province were of the largest number. The warden, a bunch of prison guards and prisoners died in the dungeon.</p>

  <p>Those prisoners who were lucky enough to survive were temporarily transferred and imprisoned in the north of the city.</p>

  <p>Edna and the other prisoners had finally left the dark dungeon only to get locked up in a huge, iron cage.</p>

  <p>Edna couldn't help but lean against the bars of the cage and stare into the distance with unease.</p>

  <p>It seemed that the Evil God was able to obtain the power that was beyond her imagination.</p>

  <p>This was something that had been inevitable in her eyes. The Evil God was talented and she always knew it was only a matter of time before he truly became a force to be reckoned with.</p>

  <p>However, if he did come, he would have to face off against the entire Bearing race and directly fight against Yellow Thearch.</p>

  <p>"I heard Yellow Thearch is at the Eternal Realm.</p>

  <p>He's inherited the most powerful bloodline.</p>

  <p>No one can step into the Eternal Realm in these years.</p>

  <p>With my husband's strength, how could he be his match?"</p>

  <p>The other prisoners soon found out that Edna seemed to have lost her mind. She kept muttering under her breath all day long, just repeating those words every single day.</p>

  <p>"Can you not come over?</p>

  <p>Please..."</p>

  <p>Of course, the Evil God could hear her.</p>

  <p>However, her begging did not work whatsoever.</p>

  <p>The black ship continued to sail at an unprecedented high speed.</p>

  <p>A layer of invisible space membrane was wrapped around it so it seemed as if it swam through ordinary space. In truth, however, it was moving within an independent space where its speed increased tenfold.</p>

  <p>In just four days, the black ship was able to cross dozens of provinces and soon arrived at the edge of the Bearing race's territory: the Black Gorge Province.</p>

  <p>Over the years, both the Bearing and the Divine Farmer races expanded their territories by occupying large provinces. Soon enough, the two races became neighbors.</p>

  <p>Compared to the other super forces, these two races adopted a special feature for their territories. A green, crystal wall was erected in between every two provinces wherein modified Sanskrit words were written.</p>

  <p>Only the members of their own races could pass through the walls. Any outsider who dared enter would have to break the walls and fight against the two races.</p>

  <p>Underneath the Black Gorge Province's crystal wall was a huge outpost position wherein a huge bear statue was erected.</p>

  <p>The black ship soon arrived at the outpost position, which quickly attracted the people's attention. dozens of people came out from the outpost to look at these new arrivals.</p>

  <p>Most of those who came out were at the eighth or ninth stage of the Other Shore Realm, three were at the thirteenth stage, and one was at the Chaotic Source Realm.</p>

  <p>It seemed this outpost position was composed of very powerful people.</p>

  <p>A warrior at the thirteenth stage of the Other Shore Realm yawned and said, "It seems another reckless idiot gets lost."</p>

  <p>"Wouldn't it be better if it is a cargo ship that gets lost? At least we'd be able to get something from them," another warrior at the ninth stage of the Other Shore Realm remarked.</p>

  <p>These warriors were powerful but there was no denying that their jobs here were quite boring.</p>

  <p>A lost ship was a potential source of fun, so there was no way they would let it go so easily.</p>

  <p>Nobody in the entire Source World could afford to offend the Bearing race, so they usually got away with their crimes. Even trade groups dared not say anything when they forced them to hand over their stuff.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore Realm warriors all flew up towards the ship as it arrived with the full intent of crossing the crystal wall.</p>

  <p>Only the Chaotic Source Realm warrior didn't make a move.</p>

  <p>As he stared at the approaching ship, he felt that something was wrong.</p>

  <p>There was no indication at all of the ship slowing down as it approached, almost as if it was determined to hit the crystal wall.</p>

  <p>When the ship got close enough, the Chaotic Source Realm warrior's eyes widened in recognition. "That's the Black Ship!"</p>

  <p>Although the Black Ship was famous in the Source World, most people had yet to see it with their own eyes. This Chaotic Source Realm warrior had only seen it once but was immediately able to recognize it at a glance.</p>

  <p>When the Other Shore Realm warriors heard his words, their faces immediately darkened.</p>

  <p>The Black Ship was famous for its overpowering warriors. The weakest ones there were at the Holy Soul Realm. There was no way that mere Other Shore Realm warriors like them would be able to face against them!</p>

  <p>Like mice that suddenly met with the big cats, the warriors quickly retreated.</p>

  <p>"Don't panic. Even if it is the Black Ship, it will still take them a long time to break the crystal wall without our special Sanskrit word." Heightened with caution, the Chaotic Source Realm warrior saw it fit to assure his allies.</p>

  <p>Murmurs of approval followed. "That's right. The crystal wall isn't that easy to break."</p>

  <p>"Inform the defending troops of the province! Quickly!"</p>

  <p>"Tell them the Black Ship is coming!"</p>

  <p>This crystal wall was rebuilt through a method provided by the Element Spirit Civilization and its strength was three times stronger than other, ordinary, crystal walls.</p>

  <p>Since the black ship refused to slow down, it soon got to the point where it was about to hit the crystal wall.</p>

  <p>Shera couldn't help but turn towards the Evil God. "This crystal wall seems to be a little different."</p>

  <p>They had passed through several crystal walls before this.</p>

  <p>Those walls were completely under the Evil God's control so that whenever the black ship approached, a huge hole would appear as if greeting to let them through.</p>

  <p>However, this crystal wall did not do that. The Evil God, however, merely sported a look of indifference. "It's been modified. Just change it back."</p>

  <p>As he thought for a moment, the thick crystal wall began to twist crazily.</p>

  <p>The green light within quickly faded and turned into amber in just a blink of an eye!</p>

  <p>Clatter!</p>

  <p>A huge crack soon appeared and let the black ship pass through with no resistance whatsoever.</p>

  <p>The Chaotic Source Realm warrior from the Bearing race could only stare up in shock as the ship easily made its way inside their previously protected province.</p>

  <p>The other Other Shore Realm warriors were also dumbfounded to the point of silence.</p>

  <p>The Evil God stood on deck and looked down at the people in indifference.</p>

  <p>"Weak as ants," he uttered in distaste.</p>

  <p>Rumble, rumble, rumble...</p>

  <p>From below, the originally solid ground let out a roar, and stone pillars suddenly came out of nowhere. Each pillar stabbed through the warriors that guarded the outpost position.</p>

  <p>"Run away!"</p>

  <p>Having realized the hopelessness of their situation, the Chaotic Source Realm warrior gave the order and was about to use the Grand Teleportation.</p>

  <p>The other warriors thought the same thing and intended to escape as far away as possible.</p>

  <p>However, when they used the space theurgy, they found that the space had no reaction— it had been sealed.</p>

  <p>This feat, sealing the space, was a piece of cake for the Evil God.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, the members of the Bearing race found themselves wrapped in endless stalagmites.</p>

  <p>These stalagmites were as powerful as those men of soil!</p>

  <p>A blow could shatter these stalagmites but it did not completely destroy them, as they reconstructed and their strength doubled.</p>

  <p>Not long after, the warriors found themselves impaled onto the stalagmites.</p>

  <p>The Chaotic Source Realm warrior soon exhausted his strength as he lay dying upon a stalagmite pillar. "I'm the direct descendant of the Ji Clan!</p>

  <p>You cannot kill me like this!" he roared.</p>

  <p>When he said those words, the stalagmites suddenly stopped and a glimmer of hope rose in his chest. It seemed that the Ji Clan's reputation still terrified people.</p>

  <p>However, he soon found out that his assumption was wrong.</p>

  <p>"A member of the Ji Clan? Then it would be best if you die a slow, painful death."</p>

  <p>The stalagmites slowly rotated and caused the Chaotic Source Realm warrior intense pain as they drove deep within his flesh.</p>

  <p>Shera stared at the sight with a grimace. "Are you going to kill all of them like this?" she asked.</p>

  <p>The Evil God shrugged. "I guess so."</p>

  <p>The corners of Shera's eyes twitched.</p>

  <p>This guy was truly crazy. She had no idea what he aimed to achieve with all this chaos.</p>
