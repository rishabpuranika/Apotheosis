  <p>
</p>

  <p>The vines completely wrapped around Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>These were Bone-dissolving Vines. Once a person was trapped, the vines would suck their life energy until their prey was dry like a prune.</p>

  <p>Just now, Luo Luo Zheng had been able to withstand the Profound Holy Thunder.</p>

  <p>Ying wasn't adept at combat, but she knew better than to rely on her own strength to break through Luo Zheng's theurgy.</p>

  <p>If the Bone-dissolving Vines were truly effective and would completely absorb all of Luo Zheng's life energy, then she'd be more than satisfied.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," she said, her voice saccharine sweet.</p>

  <p>She really wasn't someone who enjoyed killing and she couldn't be less interested in Yao's schemes. It was just a pity she had to kill Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's expression remained the same. However, in the next moment, he felt a strange movement from the vines. Tiny vortices erupted on their skin and began to absorb his energy.</p>

  <p>Soon, green dots started to appear along the vines.</p>

  <p>The Bone-dissolving Vines were taking his energy.</p>

  <p>"It's working," Ying said with faint amusement.</p>

  <p>"Good," Yao nodded in praise. She hadn't thought that even after she'd exhausted her strength, she'd still have to rely on Ying to solve the problem.</p>

  <p>Ying, however, only glanced at her with indifference.</p>

  <p>Although the Soul-sealing Needle forced her to stand on the same side as Yao, she didn't like the girl, and she wasn't afraid to show it.</p>

  <p>The vines continued to absorb life energy, and were getting fatter every passing moment. Ying lightly tapped on a vine and it slithered onto her hand like a snake.</p>

  <p>The green energy flowed from Luo Zheng's body to hers, and she liked it very much.</p>

  <p>The moment life energy was extracted, it would begin to form a ball of energy. It would condense and grow bigger until it had absorbed all the nutrients and energy from its source.</p>

  <p>Not long after, more and more energy gathered in her hand, and soon enough, another ball of green light appeared.</p>

  <p>"Huh?"</p>

  <p>Ying frowned in confusion.</p>

  <p>This ball of green light held all of one's life energy.</p>

  <p>But if Ying had indeed extracted Luo Zheng's life energy, why was he still alive?</p>

  <p>Unless... This was not Luo Zheng's life energy!</p>

  <p>'Could it be that this brat has other life forms attached to him?'</p>

  <p>Scowling at the thought, Ying activated the vines again.</p>

  <p>After about half a minute, another ball of energy appeared in her hand.</p>

  <p>She shook her head in frustration and continued to draw more energy from her prisoner.</p>

  <p>Five minutes passed... and forty green blobs of light were now dancing in her hands.</p>

  <p>Rich life energy leaked out, and even Yao could feel that something wasn't right. "What's going on?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Ying frowned. She didn't know either.</p>

  <p>The process should have been done by now, but there were already forty energy blobs in her hands and Luo Luo Zheng was still as alive as when they started.</p>

  <p>Could it be that there were more than forty independent life forms residing in his body? Or that he had more than forty lives?</p>

  <p>And each of these blobs was incredibly powerful. They clearly had come from at least world-lord-level beings, which meant that right now, she was holding forty world lords' lives in her hands!</p>

  <p>Of the three queens, Ying was the most intelligent, but she didn't feel smart at the moment. She was utterly confused.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng's theurgy worked the same as her leaves of Willow of Destruction, it should be able to absorb all kinds of energy. The thing was, she wasn't releasing any form of energy at the moment. Instead, she was drawing out life energy from him?</p>

  <p>What she didn't realize, however, was that Luo Luo Zheng could make the Bone-dissolving Vines absorb life energy from other supreme worlds by using the power transfer.</p>

  <p>And within the supreme worlds covered by the will of worlds, martial artists from the Sacred race began drying up like mummies.</p>

  <p>Those who witnessed this shook in fear at the unnatural occurrence.</p>

  <p>Their companions were being sucked dry out of nowhere! For all they knew, this kind of thing only happened to world lords!</p>

  <p>Another moment passed.</p>

  <p>There were now more than eighty green blobs in her hands. Ying couldn't believe what was happening. How the heck was Luo Luo Zheng still smiling? He looked nothing like a man about to lose his life.</p>

  <p>It was only then that it dawned on her. What she was doing did not have any effect on him.</p>

  <p>Not wanting to waste the energy she gathered, she poured all of it into Supreme Lord Shadow's dying form.</p>

  <p>"Let me give it a try..."</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Korbin flew down from the sky, leaving Leroy alone in the air. Their battle was meaningless and what was happening below looked much more interesting.</p>

  <p>He had thought Luo Luo Zheng would be easy to deal with, so he had given him to Supreme Lord Shadow.</p>

  <p>He hadn't thought that such a strange thing would happen to this boy.</p>

  <p>After recovering from his wounds, Supreme Lord Shadow also joined in.</p>

  <p>Alone in the air, Leroy felt like an outsider. He didn't know what to make of the scene in front of him. 'No wonder the Celestial Position race valued Luo Luo Zheng so highly; he possesses such powerful theurgy! In time, he will be able to save the universe.'</p>

  <p>The two Demon Night queens and the two Supreme Lords used all sorts of methods but in the end, they were unable to kill Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Yao shook her head. This was futile. "I will activate the Punishment of Eternal Night and seal him in eternal darkness..."</p>

  <p>Punishment of Eternal Night was an extremely strong sealing method, and it was also the most brutal punishment of the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>Up until now, only a few dozen members of the Demon Night had received this punishment. Activating it required a considerable amount of Faith Energy, even for the Queen of Punishment, which was why Yao rarely used it.</p>

  <p>Not killing Luo Luo Zheng could not possibly end well. Even if he was sealed in eternal night, it wouldn't end their problem once and for all. It was just that at the moment, Yao saw no other option.</p>

  <p>"You should have just died. Now I can only let you enjoy the worst punishment of the Demon Night!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng remained calm. While they were beating him up, he used the will of worlds to check out the situation within the Inauguration Altar. The corners of his mouth curved to a smile. "You didn't sense anything?"</p>

  <p>Yao ignored him. Right now, she only wanted him locked up in eternal night.</p>

  <p>Punishment was Yao's specialty. Killing people was Xun's...</p>

  <p>But as Yao began to condense Faith Energy, a frown formed on her face. She couldn't collect any.</p>

  <p>Ying's expression mirrored Yao's. She could sense something wrong.</p>

  <p>The two women glanced at each other and saw the panic reflected in their eyes. They turned their attention to the Inauguration Altar.</p>

  <p>Rumble, rumble...</p>

  <p>The earth began to shake violently.</p>

  <p>Soon, massive cracks began to form in the Inauguration Altar's surface.</p>

  <p>"What's happening?" Leroy asked, his gaze fixed on the altar.</p>

  <p>The Inauguration Altar was probably one of the sturdiest buildings in the Evolutionary Universe. A Supreme Lord wouldn't be able to force their way in it. And before, when Luo Luo Zheng had fallen from the sky, he had only created a hole in the surface.</p>

  <p>The tremors that came from the Inauguration Altar at this moment were actually capable of shattering the entire Inauguration Altar. What exactly had happened here?</p>

  <p>BOOM!</p>

  <p>And right at that moment, the Inauguration Altar exploded.</p>

  <p>And from the rubble, a massive figure shot straight to the sky. A silhouette of a woman could be seen standing on top of a dragon's head!</p>
