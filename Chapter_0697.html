  <p>
</p>

  <p>When he saw Ning Yudie smiling but not saying anything, Cole hesitated. Her reaction was troublesome. Should he eliminate Luo Zheng from the magic array?</p>

  <p>After he thought things through, Cole turned to Ning Yudie. "Zheng's actions have affected the balance of the pre-qualifying match, so he must be disqualified.</p>

  <p>What do you think?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Once again, Michael and Xiao looked at each other before they quietly scolded Cole for being an idiot. But they stood aloof and distanced themselves because things were of no concern to them.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Ning Yudie watched Luo Zheng killing purple-jade centipedes through the Picture Slab. But once she heard Cole speaking, the gentle smile on her lips changed into one laced with cynicism that sent the temperature plummeting.</p>

  <p>Then the palace turned cold as an ice cellar. Even the guards standing at the door rubbed their hands together to warm themselves and wondered why it had suddenly turned cold.</p>

  <p id="top_1">"What do you mean? Is there a rule for this in the World Commercial Alliance?"</p>

  <p>Her eyes looked straight at his, while her voice was frosty.</p>

  <p>Quickly, Cole shook his head. "No, but Luo Zheng cheated, and this has seriously affected the balance. If this goes on, after he passes the first stage, it will be very tough for other warriors to compete with him in the second stage," he explained.</p>

  <p>"Oh, really?" Ning Yudie sneered. Her eyes were now vicious and icily. She said,</p>

  <p>"I wonder if you've heard this saying."</p>

  <p>"What saying?" Cole demanded. Although his status and strength were inferior to Yudie's, Cole was neither humble nor pushy but insisted on judging things for himself. And though he knew he had provoked Ning Yudie, he didn't give in.</p>

  <p>"Competitors can play any tricks except those written down," Ning Yudie said coldly. "Since you didn't announce this rule beforehand, Luo Zheng just took advantage of this loophole. You're obviously wrong. How can you now eliminate Luo Zheng from the magic array? You claimed it was for the sake of overall consideration, but you know what? It was your mistake and omission that destroyed the balance. How can you make Luo Zheng the scapegoat?</p>

  <p>It's selfish of you to even think of that!" she said furiously.</p>

  <p>Her outburst left Cole speechless.</p>

  <p>At the national level, people could do everything except those prohibited by law.</p>

  <p>In the magic array, Cole didn't stipulate that candidates couldn't do this, so in theory, what Luo Zheng did was reasonable. This was a mere omission when Cole made the rules for the magic array.</p>

  <p>What Ning Yudie said was true, so Michael and Xiao, two silent spectators so far, also nodded in agreement. Michael had previously dealt with Ning Yudie, so he knew what kind of person she was. Although she was the head of the Cloud Hall, she was like a little girl who allowed emotions to get the better of her. Her argument today was well-grounded, but even if she didn't have a point, she never listened to reason.</p>

  <p>So, after hearing what Cole told Ning Yudie, Michael knew for sure that the woman would answer back. If Cole eliminated Luo Zheng from the magic array, fighting would break out in the palace.</p>

  <p>And the result of that was clear. Cole was bound to suffer. In a sense, Cole was too honest and upright, and someone had to teach him a lesson.</p>

  <p>Anyway, the World Commercial Alliance was mainly engaged in business.</p>

  <p>And a man like him didn't fit the trade circle.</p>

  <p>To settle the dispute, Xiao came forward to mediate. He patted Cole on the shoulder and said, "Miss Ning is right. Even if Luo Zheng truly broke the balance, it's because of your negligence. Forget what happened today. But you have to clarify the rules before the pre-qualifying match starts tomorrow."</p>

  <p>The lack of expression on Yudie's face and Michael's insistence to be taken out of the picture forced a hesitant Cole to compromise.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Stoney had to deal with strained eyesight. He wanted to continue fighting, hoping to kill those purple-jade centipedes at a faster rate, but his forte was attacking souls, so he was much slower than Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He couldn't defeat Luo Zheng or grab his points, so he was at a loss what to do next.</p>

  <p>With Luo Zheng killing beasts for him, Stoney passed the first stage without difficulty. But by the second stage when candidates would engage in plundering, and with his pagoda not yet upgraded, he would be too weak to fight.</p>

  <p>So, he was likely to fail in this pre-qualifying match.</p>

  <p>The man had an axe to grind. Initially, he wanted to secure a good position in the main draw match after he passed the pre-qualifying match smoothly.</p>

  <p>Stoney knew his limitations. He didn't have the ability to take the first place, so the legendary Dragon Soar Arena was never his goal.</p>

  <p>His goal was to come in second or third.</p>

  <p>The World Commercial Alliance would give the top ten winners generous rewards, some of which were very important to Stoney. Using the Hatred Evil Attack, he was confident that he could make it into the top ten and proceed with his plan.</p>

  <p>However, things didn't work out the way he planned them. Now, Stoney realized that the reality he faced was crueler than he imagined. He might not be able to pass the pre-qualifying match, let alone land in the top ten of the main draw match. Quietly, he swore, 'Luo Zheng is such a formidable obstacle!'</p>

  <p>The obstacle was busy in his field. After disposing of the purple-jade centipedes at an astonishing speed, Luo Zheng quickly left.</p>

  <p>And when Stoney looked up, he found that Luo Zheng didn't fly above his field.</p>

  <p>He looked to be on his way to plunder other warriors.</p>

  <p>In the sixth wave of attack, Luo Zheng not only gained points of his own but also grabbed Stoney's. It was still early, so he went to challenge another martial artist to steal his points. His opponent resisted fiercely, but Luo Zheng fought like a rascal. And with his understanding of the Space Law, he managed to grab half of the martial artist's points.</p>

  <p>The result was his pagoda upgraded quickly.</p>

  <p>When the seventh wave of beasts attacked, Zheng's pagoda upgraded to level 8. By the eighth wave, the pagoda reached the level 10.</p>

  <p>In the ninth wave, Zheng's pagoda had reached level 11.</p>

  <p>And before the tenth wave began, Zheng's pagoda was already at level 12! At that moment, pagodas of other warriors had only upgraded nine times to level 9.</p>

  <p>Sighing heavily, Luo Zheng said, "Finally, it's the last wave!"</p>

  <p>He stood at the top of his pagoda and looked into the distance, curious about the last wave of beasts.</p>

  <p>Now, his pagoda had become a small fortress. At the top of the fortress stood twelve armed bowmen, each with a bow that sparkled with azure blue light, and arrows engraved with several complicated and obscure lines. It was not hard to imagine how powerful and devastating these weapons would be.</p>

  <p>And Luo Zheng believed these arrows would be more powerful than a full-blown attack at the late-stage Internal Elixir Realm.</p>

  <p>And he was right about this. That was exactly how they designed the magic array. Bowmen on the tenth-level pagoda were as powerful as a full-blown attack of warriors at the middle-stage Internal Elixir Realm. Those on the eleventh-level pagoda, on the other hand, were as mighty as a full-scale attack of warriors at the late-stage Internal Elixir Realm, while those on the twelfth-level pagoda were equivalent to a full-blown attack of warriors at the early-stage Virtual Tribulation Realm.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, it was only after a candidate defeated the last wave of beasts that he had a level ten pagoda and entered the second stage of assessment. But even before Luo Zheng vanquished the last wave of beasts, he already had a level twelve pagoda. So Cole had good reason to worry. Luo Zheng was already mightier than other warriors after what he achieved.</p>

  <p>"Thump! Thump! Thump!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the ground shook. As everyone braced for balance, three huge figures appeared in the distance.</p>

  <p>"Here they come!" Luo Zheng hollered. His eyebrows twitched as he got ready for battle.</p>

  <p>The enemy turned out to be three giant turtles!</p>

  <p>These giants resided in the deep sea. Each of them stood as high as 200 feet, and looked like a huge hill. Their strength was astonishing. Every step they took measured a hundred feet.</p>

  <p>In theory, their growth was infinite. Provided enough resources, they could grow to hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands of feet tall! With just a step, they could crush mountains. Moreover, they could even move mountains and drain seas. But Luo Zheng had never heard of such giants existing in his world.</p>

  <p>The three giants were heading in Zheng's direction!</p>
