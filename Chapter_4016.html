<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Odin's miserable death was a lesson to the remaining men in black robes.</p>

  <p>They didn't dare to act recklessly anymore.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and the three Eternal Realm Hunters, however remained calm.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess said, "I think the Treacherous Being that has possessed Luo Zheng knows what's going on.</p>

  <p>Maybe it can protect us."</p>

  <p>Letting the Treacherous Being protect them seemed an inconceivable thought.</p>

  <p>But it had given them a kind warning before.</p>

  <p>Perhaps seeking its protection was the only choice that remained.</p>

  <p>They didn't have much reason to hope but they still followed the Snake Goddess's instructions and retreated, step by step.</p>

  <p>"Wing King, can you tell Luo Zheng about the situation we are in?" the Snake Goddess asked.</p>

  <p>The Wing King nodded and sent the news of the monsters with big heads to the Regal Jade Spirit through the Civilization Artifact.</p>

  <p>In Luo Zheng's inner world, the Primeval Lord of Heaven had gathered dozens of people, ready to sing together.</p>

  <p>Now that the Treacherous Being had regained its consciousness, it was possible for them to communicate with it.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's avatar floated on the sidelines and watched them prepare.</p>

  <p>They had undergone periods of training, thanks to which they became more and more skillful. They only needed to wait for the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization to transmit the syllables to them.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had previously tried to communicate with the Treacherous Being, but had failed since the latter didn't have a mind of its own.</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade Spirit used the Grand Teleportation and appeared beside Luo Zheng before saying seriously, "Luo Zheng, the Wing King and the others haven't left."</p>

  <p>"What? Why?" Luo Zheng exclaimed, taken aback.</p>

  <p>"A number of Treacherous Beings have appeared and blocked their way."</p>

  <p>Treacherous Beings?</p>

  <p>This meant even more trouble!</p>

  <p>According to what they had predicted before, the Treacherous Being named Campbell would leave Luo Zheng's body after fulfilling his wish.</p>

  <p>But it now looked like things weren't that simple.</p>

  <p>"This round tray hasn't been visited in a long time and the big-headed Treacherous Beings appeared as soon as we arrived," Luo Zheng murmured.</p>

  <p>"I don't think it's a coincidence. Campbell obviously knows about it, or he wouldn't have warned the Snake Goddess and the others to leave," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said, trying to analyze the situation.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes flashed. He then said to the Civilization Artifact of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization, "Translate my words into Sanskrit."</p>

  <p>A while later, a chorus sounded from within Luo Zheng's inner world. "Master Campbell, can you hear me? I'm  Luo Zheng Luo, the owner of this body."</p>

  <p>Campbell stood still, silver spear in hand.</p>

  <p>Many big-headed monsters were slowly climbing up from the edge of the round tray. Some of them were playing with their huge, horrible heads, rolling them around as they went.</p>

  <p>They were slow but they gradually formed an encirclement.</p>

  <p>Campbell, however, was in no hurry. He seemed to be waiting for these monsters to appear. He had waited for a while before he saw the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and the others return.</p>

  <p>He howled, "You idiots! Didn't you understand what I told you?"</p>

  <p>He had asked these humans to leave out of the kindness of his heart.</p>

  <p>After all, they had a sort of connection with him because he was a human spirit, a continuation of the race.</p>

  <p>Campbell was still lost in thought when an unpleasant voice sounded from Luo Zheng's elixir field. The voice was neither male nor female. It was, instead, a combination of several voices. "Master Campbell, can you hear me? I'm  Luo Zheng Luo, the owner of this body."</p>

  <p>Campbell was stunned. This was the Sanskrit land.</p>

  <p>How could Luo Zheng speak Sanskrit?</p>

  <p>The voice was unpleasant on the ears but he could hear it clearly.</p>

  <p>"Why? Why can you speak our language?" Campbell asked.</p>

  <p>"You will know once you check my inner world," replied Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Out of curiosity, Campbell began to check Luo Zheng's inner world as he was told.</p>

  <p>He saw that a group of people were divided into three rows, making complicated sounds. "I once communicated with a creature from outside the chaos. I'm prepared."</p>

  <p>"A team of so many people. It's interesting..." Campbell was intrigued by what he saw.</p>

  <p>The creatures in the chaos lacked knowledge and experience. Limited by their world, neither could they communicate with creatures in the main world, nor did they have a complete understanding of the main world.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng had overcome the obstacles by virtue of the advantage in numbers.</p>

  <p>Campbell had never seen such a thing before.</p>

  <p>His companions would be shocked if they knew of this.</p>

  <p>Campbell became more interested in Luo Zheng. He asked, "What's the matter? Do you want to take back your body?"</p>

  <p>The Civilization Artifact transmitted this sentence to the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization for deciphering, and then to Luo Zheng. The core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization was fast, but it still took some time to decipher the message and transmit it to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng and the Primeval Lord of Heaven heard Campbell, they looked at each other, bitter smiles.</p>

  <p>It looked like taking back his physical body wasn't going to be an easy task.</p>

  <p>But right now, the most important thing was to ensure the safety of the Snake Goddess and her companions.</p>

  <p>"Let's talk about it later. Both of us are from the human race. Can you protect my friends?" Luo Zheng pleaded.</p>

  <p>As he spoke, the Snake Goddess and the others moved to his side.</p>

  <p>The big-headed monsters were still following them closely.</p>

  <p>"I'm not human," Campbell said arrogantly.</p>

  <p>Human spirits were one of the most noble creatures in the main world, which was why they were proud of themselves.</p>

  <p>Campbell continued, "I can't protect them. I don't even know if I can survive."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and the Primeval Lord of Heaven were shocked. "You don't know if you can survive these Treacherous Beings?"</p>

  <p>Campbell suddenly looked sad and weary. "Most likely not. We were no match for them, at least in the past many years.</p>

  <p>We wouldn't have been trapped in that damned place otherwise."</p>

  <p>Campbell didn't explain any further but Luo Zheng and the Primeval Lord of Heaven could tell that he was referring to the Whining Road.</p>

  <p>"We have tried many times. I myself have tried at least six times," Campbell said, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>Six stripes were engraved on the armor of his right arm.</p>

  <p>He then raised his long spear and used the tip of the spear to add another stripe on his right arm.</p>

  <p>This was his seventh time here.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and the others were confused as they watched this. They didn't know why Campbell had added that extra stripe.</p>
