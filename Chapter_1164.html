<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1164 Unique Law Of Causality </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The drop of blood fell on the Black Star pickaxe but did not seep into it.</p>

  <p>However, it did not fall down or get repelled by the pickaxe either.</p>

  <p>It was slowly crawling on the pickaxe like a small insect.</p>

  <p>"Will it work?" Luo Luo Zheng stared at it nervously.</p>

  <p>The drop of blood slowly slid from the top part of the pickaxe, moving all the way down. Luo Zheng's eyes followed it as it slowly inched downward.</p>

  <p>As the drop of blood continued rolling downwards, Luo Zheng's heart began to sink. It didn't look like this was going to work.</p>

  <p>He was starting to lose all hope when the drop of blood gently swayed and then suddenly split apart. It spread out on the pickaxe and then got completely absorbed in it!</p>

  <p>"Huh! I succeeded?!" Luo Luo Zheng was ecstatic!</p>

  <p>Soon after, he felt like he had established some sort of connection with the Black Star pickaxe. It felt like the bond between flesh and blood.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had experienced this feeling before. Back when he had condensed the sword spirit, he felt that his soul and that of the sword spirit were connected. But the difference here was that Xun, the sword spirit, had her own soul and thoughts, while the Black Star pickax didn't have a mind of its own. Its consciousness was only used to identify its master, so it was a simpler form.</p>

  <p>Buzz, buzz, buzz?</p>

  <p>Suddenly a dazzling light burst out from the three divine textures on the Black Star pickaxe. It pierced right through Luo Zheng's life vitality and soared into the sky!</p>

  <p>"What's happening in the pit?"</p>

  <p>"Who knows? Who has the courage to go over and take a look?</p>

  <p>Obviously Tianxing did all this to keep us from finding out what he's up to.</p>

  <p>Now whoever goes there will be courting death!"</p>

  <p>"I don't dare to go there. If I were to go over there, he would definitely kill me..."</p>

  <p>The corpses of the divine-level talents, who had tried to take the Black Star pickaxe from Luo Luo Zheng, served as reminders of what lay in store for those who dared to approach the pit.</p>

  <p>After the light dissipated, Luo Luo Zheng climbed out of the pit with the Black Star pickaxe and a smile on his face. In his mind, he was communicating with the cyan dragon, "Does this Black Star pickaxe have any special abilities?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng didn't know what a supreme divine weapon could do, but judging from the fact that a mere semi-divine divine weapon like Fiona's jade bracelet was so powerful, he assumed that the supreme divine weapon would have extraordinary powers.</p>

  <p>"The abilities of the Black Star pickaxe?" The cyan dragon replied, "This is a pickaxe. What abilities do you expect it to have? It can dig anything out."</p>

  <p>"It's?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was stunned at these words. "Just this?"</p>

  <p>"Isn't that enough? Don't look at it as a weapon. Though it's a pickaxe, it's an extraordinary one," added the cyan dragon.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's heart sank. What the hell was this?</p>

  <p>When he had seen the three ten-star divine textures on the Black Star pickax, he had high expectations from it. That was why he had worked so hard to obtain the Black Star pickaxe.</p>

  <p>It was a supreme divine weapon after all. Although it was just a mining pickaxe, it could still be used as a weapon! At least that was what Luo Luo Zheng thought. He couldn't believe that the pickaxe could only be used for digging...</p>

  <p>Seeing Luo Zheng's disappointed face, the cyan dragon slowly explained to him, "Don't underestimate the Black Star pickaxe. The supreme divine weapon contains the unique Law of Causality! There is hardly anything it can't break."</p>

  <p>"The Law of Causality!"</p>

  <p>Xun had also mentioned it to him before. A chill went down his spine and his face became more serious.</p>

  <p>The Law of Causality was extremely powerful! Luo Luo Zheng clearly remembered Eddie's Life and Death Wind. Anyone who was hit by the Life and Death Wind would instantly die as it contained the Law of Causality. Life and death corresponded to cause and effect. It was impossible for anyone to resist the Law of Causality.</p>

  <p>"Yes, and the Law of Causality in the supreme divine weapon is unique, that is how it earned its title," said the cyan dragon.</p>

  <p>"So what is the cause and what's the effect in this supreme divine weapon?" inquired Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon thought for a moment before replying, "The cause is the Black Star pickaxe itself, and the effect is its ability to dig anything out.</p>

  <p>As it's a supreme divine weapon whose function is to dig something, it can break everything?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng couldn't help but roll his eyes at this. What kind of a lame Law of Causality was this? In the end, it was still just about digging?</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon probably wasn't satisfied with his own explanation, but the fact remained that the Black Star pickaxe was indeed a very special tool. The weapon refiner who made this pickaxe had created it with the intention of making it the most powerful pickaxe in the universe. He had never intended it to be a weapon.</p>

  <p>But as per what the cyan dragon had said, the Law of Causality contained in this Black Star pickax wasn't that bad. Since it could break anything, all defenses against the pickaxe would be ineffective.</p>

  <p>Sadly, this tool was only a pickaxe, not a sharp sword. If this supreme divine weapon were a sword that contained the Law of Causality to break anything, no one would be able to block its attack.</p>

  <p>It was all wishful thinking because the truth remained that it was merely a pickaxe, and there had never been any pickaxe techniques since ancient times.</p>

  <p>Disappointed as Luo Luo Zheng was, he didn't want to waste any more time dwelling on it. He had taken a lot of effort to obtain this Black Star pickax, and his purpose of doing this was to break the leaves on the top floors. Since this tool could break anything, it would not be difficult to break the leaves on the forty-fifth floor and the floors above. The Black Star pickaxe contained the Law of Causality so no matter how hard the leaves were, they could not resist the pickaxe.</p>

  <p>Keeping this in mind, Luo Luo Zheng decided to take out the life crystals first.</p>

  <p>However, before he could climb up the pyramid, dozens of rays of light rapidly shot down from the sky!</p>

  <p>The Feather Holy Sea was still influenced by the power of blood sacrifice, which made it difficult for warriors at Virtual Tribulation Realm to fly. If these warriors were able to fly directly above the sky of Feather Holy Sea and maintain such a high speed, they must be the mighty warriors at Soul Sea Realm!</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng's guess was correct, this would be the group of mighty warriors of Soul Sea Realm from the divine kingdoms, including Turner, War Emperor York, Scott and War King Wind. All of them arrived at once.</p>

  <p>Being mighty warriors of the Soul Sea Realm, they would certainly not be interested in ordinary ores. As they could not break the leaves on the 45th floor and beyond, they were here to catch the mineral-devouring bugs in the mineral tree. They would not kill them all. The mineral-devouring bugs would lay eggs on the roots of the tree, and new bugs would hatch every year.</p>

  <p>They had pinned their hopes on the mineral-devouring bugs. They expected these bugs to devour the Soul Cores so that they could extract the Soul Cores before they were completely digested.</p>

  <p>Over twenty powerful masters at the Soul Sea Realm landed at the bottom of the pyramid. War Emperor York was the first one to arrive, and as soon as his feet hit the ground, several divine-level talents of the York Divine Kingdom carried over the unconscious Fredric to him.</p>

  <p>When War Emperor York saw that Fredric was weak and unconscious, his face instantly darkened. 'What was going on?' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>No one from the four divine kingdoms ever dared to offend the crown prince of York Divine Kingdom!</p>

  <p>"What happened to my son? Why does his soul feel so weak? Who did this? Who harmed Fredric's soul?" War Emperor York demanded menacingly.</p>

  <p>If an ordinary divine-level talent's soul was harmed, it would be a problem. However, for the crown prince of a divine kingdom, it was no big deal. The York Divine Kingdom's heritage was far beyond that of ordinary sects or noble clans. War Emperor York was just incensed that someone had dared to injure Fredric!</p>

  <p>To put it bluntly, this Divine Kingdom Continent belonged to the four royal families of the four divine kingdoms. The entire continent was like the backyard of these four families. The crown prince of Liu Clan was knocked unconscious in his own backyard! Who on this continent dared to challenge the authority of the royal family?</p>

  <p>When the War Emperor York asked the question, he already knew the answer. No one on the continent would dare to do so, except for Luo Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>There still was a small possibility that it might not be him because Luo Luo Zheng had a violent fight with him once and he spared Luo Zheng's life because Turner and several others persuaded him to spare his life. So he assumed Luo Luo Zheng would not offend him further. And if he did, he knew he was inviting death.</p>

  <p>A divine-level talent of the York Divine Kingdom looked at the furious War Emperor York and shuddered. He replied meekly, "Your majesty, it's, it's Luo Luo Zheng. His soul pressure did this to the crown prince!"</p>

  <p>War Emperor York took a step forward and reached out to his son. He put his hand in Fredric's robes and removed a necklace. The ornament looked feminine. The gem in the necklace had been completely shattered and its color had faded. War Emperor York clenched his teeth as he looked at Luo Luo Zheng and yelled, "Luo Luo Zheng! Kneel down before me and await your death!"</p>

  <p>Although this Heart Condensation Necklace was a top-grade sacred weapon, its value was equal to that of a semi-divine weapon. Now it was broken, and this made War Emperor York furious!</p>

  <p>Standing at the edge of the pyramid, Luo Luo Zheng blinked and said calmly, "If I really wanted to die, why would I kneel down in front of you?"</p>
