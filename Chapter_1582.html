<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1582 She Lost The Battle </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The walls of the Hall of Causality were riddled with the rules of heavens, just like the walls of the main city— they were virtually unbreakable.</p>

  <p>After being hit, the small skull unleashed some kind of overwhelming momentum. It bounced so fast that it was impossible for anyone to dodge.</p>

  <p>When the crowd witnessed the scene, they were left dumbfounded and stood blankly on the spot, not daring to make a single move.</p>

  <p>Bam!</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the small skull shot toward an ogre warrior, smashing right into a spike on his shoulder armor.</p>

  <p>The ogre's armor served as a first-rank divine weapon— it constantly absorbed the warrior's life vitality and fused with the warrior's body. Its strength was nothing to scoff at, either.</p>

  <p>But the small skull missed by only an inch and collided with the spike, turning it into powder. With that, the ogre's tall and sturdy body got knocked down to the ground.</p>

  <p>Pah! Pah! Pah!</p>

  <p>Then, the skull shot all the way to the endmost wall in the hall and bounced all the way back outside.</p>

  <p>The white deflected ray of light bounced out as well.</p>

  <p>Throughout the entire scene, no one dared to move.</p>

  <p>Staying still was the best thing to do in such a situation.</p>

  <p>After the two objects bringing fatal attacks disappeared from the hall, everyone released a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>But the ogre warrior stood from the ground and glared harshly at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Do you want to kill me? Once we leave this hall, we shall have a duel!"</p>

  <p>When the white light hit the small skull, it produced the powerful potential energy. Even though Luo Zheng had instantly released his hand, his fingers had still been paralyzed by the vibration. Hearing the ogre's proclamation, Luo Zheng stretched out his fingers and faintly smiled, his eyes tinged with a piercing light as he stared at the ogre warrior. Then, he responded, "If you want to challenge me, I accept."</p>

  <p>Seeing Zheng's calm gaze, the ogre couldn't help but feel a sense of nervousness. The fierceness of Zheng's eyes made the ogre stop himself just as he wanted to make some more rude remarks. Although the ogre appeared to be reckless, he was a cautious individual. In the room just then, he had observed the entire process of Zheng's cultivation.</p>

  <p>Although he couldn't quite understand what Luo Zheng cultivated, he could tell from the woman's reaction that Luo Zheng was extremely powerful. Earlier, he had challenged him recklessly out of anger, but he wasn't confident about fighting him. Currently, he only held five million Illusion Points, having spent all of them just to enter the Hall of Causality. It would be such a waste if he was driven out of the hall if Luo Zheng defeated him.</p>

  <p>Many of the other warriors were also left displeased. But it wasn't the time for them to quarrel about anything. Now that the rules of the first Hall of Causality were clear to everyone, it was actually very easy to pass through it so long as they took good control of the speed and frequency. For the rest of the journey, they spent only a short while passing through it.</p>

  <p>But just as they passed through the hall, a small, black object floated in from the front door.</p>

  <p>It was the small skull that shot out just moments ago.</p>

  <p>Earlier, it shot out at a great distance. After the great amount of potential energy was exhausted, it slowly flew back toward Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>But as it flew back, it bumped into another white light ray.</p>

  <p>Everyone, including Luo Zheng, ran away upon seeing this scene.</p>

  <p>They practically charged out of the Hall of Causality.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile…</p>

  <p>On the platform at the back of the Hall of Causality, a bunch of yellow Illusion Points suddenly appeared and flew right at the crowd.</p>

  <p>"The reward!"</p>

  <p>"There are only a hundred Illusion Points! That's not enough!"</p>

  <p>"Only this much for making it through the Hall of Causality? It has to be worth so much more than this!"</p>

  <p>Initially, everyone's anger was directed at Luo Zheng, but now that they saw how small the reward was, they began shifting their attention to the woman in white.</p>

  <p>She told them that the reward would be plentiful, but they only got a handful of Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>The woman in white then looked at them with wide eyes. "Why are you looking at me like that? I didn't arrange this place for you. Exploring the first Hall of Causality doesn't have that high of a difficulty level, so the reward isn't that big. You're already lucky! I only got fifty Illusion Points in the last round!"</p>

  <p>Hearing that, everyone turned morose— they had paid five million Illusion Points just to enter the place. Earning only a hundred Illusion Points from passing through it was undoubtedly a great loss on their end.</p>

  <p>But since they had already entered the place, they had no choice but to keep moving forward. If they were to give up, they would really have lost everything without getting a chance to earn it all back.</p>

  <p>Stepping onto the steps once again, the woman in white smiled and said to Luo Zheng, "You're making everything more difficult!"</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng merely shrugged. "I didn't know such a thing would happen."</p>

  <p>These little skulls were indeed more difficult to deal with than Luo Zheng could have imagined.</p>

  <p>The others looked straight at Luo Zheng as the woman from the Demon Night warned, "I hope that nothing like this will ever happen again."</p>

  <p>"Yes, it's too dangerous," added the short human warrior. "Although I know you want to deal with these skulls, it's better for you to consider everyone's safety first," he said to Luo Zheng with a small smile.</p>

  <p>Though that warrior had been rather irritable before, even threatening to kill the noisy ogre warrior, he now seemed less indignant when it came to addressing Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>If the warriors blamed him with a bad attitude, it would naturally put Luo Zheng in a solemn state. After all, his actions just put everyone in further danger. After hearing the warrior's words, Luo Zheng smiled and said, "Indeed, I was too reckless. I just didn't expect that the slow white light would contain such a powerful force."</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter. Just be more careful from now on. No one should be at the risk of harm. If they were bitten in the back by these skulls, they wouldn't be this calm. Are you still okay?" another human warrior asked from behind Luo Zheng. He couldn't figure out how Luo Zheng still looked completely unscathed even though his back had been bitten by the skulls. So he just had to seize the chance to ask Luo Zheng about it directly.</p>

  <p>"I'm fine. Let's keep going," Luo Zheng said with a smile. After all, he wasn't willing to just share the secret of his body with a stranger.</p>

  <p>Knowing that Luo Zheng wouldn't answer, the warrior merely stared at Luo Zheng before walking up the steps.</p>

  <p>After passing through the first hall, the woman in white no longer led the way.</p>

  <p>"Hey, I still don't know your name."</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng was about to take another step, he heard the woman in white ask.</p>

  <p>"My name?" With a flash of his eyes, Luo Zheng smiled and answered, "My name is Tianxing Luo."</p>

  <p>Under normal circumstances, it wasn't appropriate for Luo Zheng to say his real name— it was all too known throughout the universe and he wanted to avoid any unnecessary trouble from others finding out his real identity.</p>

  <p>The woman in white smiled when she heard Zheng's introduction. She then turned to Luo Zheng. "You're lying."</p>

  <p>"How do you know?" Luo Zheng asked, not bothering to hide anything after she figured it out.</p>

  <p>"It's my talent. When people lie, their hearts beat a tinge faster," she explained to him with a smile.</p>

  <p>"I see," Luo Zheng merely nodded. "What about you? What's your name?"</p>

  <p>"I'm Janet Ji," she answered.</p>

  <p>The Ji Clan was the fourth-ranked clan of the Thoughtless Minds.</p>

  <p>The Thoughtless Minds was different from the Humanity Alliance.</p>

  <p>Since the latter was called an alliance, it was also regarded as a colossus formed by countless sacred places.</p>

  <p>But the Thoughtless Minds was controlled by the four great clans which made it very powerful.</p>

  <p>Although these four great groups were called clans, they had an influence that went beyond that of the average tenth-grade sacred place.</p>

  <p>Anyone of these clans was more powerful than some entire races in the universe.</p>

  <p>But the main reason why they were so outstanding was that there were Supreme Lords supporting and guarding these four great clans.</p>

  <p>Janet Ji was particularly remarkable, second only to the ace talents in the four clans.</p>

  <p>"Janet... Well, it is a good name," Luo Zheng said with a smile.</p>

  <p>Returning the smile, Janet said, "The cultivation method you practiced just now was very familiar to me. I've seen one of my friends practice it before. I don't know if..."</p>

  <p>For a long time, she had been very curious about the origins of Zheng's cultivation method. But they hadn't been familiar with each other before then, so she knew that she couldn't get an answer out of him just any time.</p>

  <p>"Your friend? "Who?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>After a moment of thought, she replied, "Lucille Ji."</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Luo Zheng smiled again. "It so happens that the secret skill I cultivate was acquired from this woman."</p>

  <p>"Oh! You've seen Lucille, then?" The news was rather surprising. Never did she think that Luo Zheng would have learned such a secret skill from her.</p>

  <p>Why would Lucille teach him this cultivation method? Spreading the Ji Clan's secret technique was quite a crime. Even if she was an ace talent, she wouldn't be forgiven for having done such a thing.</p>

  <p>"I've seen her and I've fought with her."</p>

  <p>"Fought… Were you defeated by her?" Still pondering over the secret technique, Janet suddenly uttered the question upon hearing what Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>While she could see that Luo Zheng was indeed a powerful warrior, he was still nothing compared to Lucille in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"She lost the battle."</p>

  <p>This made Janet stop in her steps. After climbing up a few more steps, Luo Zheng turned around and asked, "What's wrong?"</p>
