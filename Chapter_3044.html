<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Please, take it. I have no lack of divine crystals," Zheng said, nodding his head encouragingly.</p>

  <p>He had a large sum of money on him, so the divine crystals truly possessed little value to him.</p>

  <p>However, the eyes of the other disciples of the Sword Light Palace filled with envy when he handed the bottle of Sword-reading Liquid to Kenelm.</p>

  <p>They had previously never imagined they'd be able to pass through the Sword Wall, but if they could get their hands on the Sword-reading Liquid, it would certainly give them a much better chance. Even Carlisle, a man of little talent, was confident in crossing the Sword Wall with the use of the Sword-reading Liquid.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng could make the normal Sword-reading Liquid perfect, he didn't have any more of such a treasure.</p>

  <p>The disciples looked at the Sword-reading Liquid with eager eyes.</p>

  <p>Although they did not speak, their thoughts had been written on their faces.</p>

  <p>Zheng looked at all the people waiting close by and a great idea popped into his head.</p>

  <p>He strode over to a group, all of them with fear etched onto their faces.</p>

  <p>What Zheng had done beneath the Sword Wall had clearly left a strong impression.</p>

  <p>"I would like to strike a deal with you," Zheng offered.</p>

  <p>"What... what kind of deal?" a middle-aged man asked nervously and wide eyed.</p>

  <p>"I would like to trade this bottle of Sword-reading Liquid with perfect truth aura for your diluted Sword-reading Liquid. The more diluted the better,"</p>

  <p>Zheng said holding up the bottle he'd received from Carlisle.</p>

  <p>He opened the small jade bottle as he spoke, allowing the aura to rush out and twirl playfully in the air.</p>

  <p>Their eyes ignited with excitement when the others saw the small jade bottle.</p>

  <p>The concentration of the diluted Sword-reading Liquid was only one percent of that of the undiluted one, and the price was far lower. What was Zheng thinking? What kind of deal was this?</p>

  <p>"How many bottles would you like?" the middle-aged man asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Zheng thought a while and asked, "How about you set the price?"</p>

  <p>The middle-aged man pondered on for a moment, unsure if he was being tricked somehow. Finally, he turned to the others and ordered them to hand over their diluted Sword-reading Liquid. "We will not be passing through the Sword Wall today!" he announced.</p>

  <p>The thirty men behind him had obviously come as a single force, for they all handed out their bottles without any hesitation.</p>

  <p>Zheng noticed that all the small jade bottles appeared the same, so he guessed they must have come from the same place. He wondered who sold this Sword-reading Liquid and whether he could produce some to sell.</p>

  <p>The men gathered their bottles in the hands of the middle-aged man who presented them to Zheng. "This is all the Sword-reading Liquid we have obtained. Would you trade your Sword-reading Liquid for all this?" he asked hopefully.</p>

  <p>The man was still unsure of this deal knowing Zheng could not make a profit from it. All he could do was to be hopeful and sincere, and show all they could offer.</p>

  <p>"Okay," Zheng replied with a friendly smile.</p>

  <p>The middle-aged man's face filled with joy. He could attempt to pass through the Sword Wall anytime he wished, but he could not get such a great deal every day. He could now make a handsome profit selling Zheng's Sword-reading Liquid. He made the exchange with Zheng and departed with his men without saying any more.</p>

  <p>Once they had gone, Zheng opened one of the small jade bottles and began softly reciting the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent.</p>

  <p>"Hooo..."</p>

  <p>The truth aura circled the bottle before slipping into it like a snake slithering underground.</p>

  <p>Soon a bottle of perfect Sword-reading Liquid was "created" by Zheng. He then walked on to another group of people, a smile on his face and the small bottle in his hand.</p>

  <p>After performing the same trade three times, namely trading the perfect Sword-reading Liquid for diluted ones, Zheng had amassed over one hundred bottles of diluted Sword-reading Liquid. All that was left now was to make them perfect.</p>

  <p>The disciples surrounded Zheng and watched him perfect the Sword-reading Liquid. They were astounded at what was taking place before their widened eyes.</p>

  <p>"I wonder how much money Zheng can make by using his truth aura."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid he'll be a millionaire in a matter of days!"</p>

  <p>"He earns money based on talent. Nobody can take his talent away from him..."</p>

  <p>The disciples were filled with admiration for Zheng, as those who came in contact with him often were.</p>

  <p>"I think it should be okay for Zheng to make the Sword-reading Liquid for us, but he may have a problem selling it in large quantities," Beldene then said flatly.</p>

  <p>"Why?" Elgin asked.</p>

  <p>"All these bottles come from the same place. That means that everyone buys this Sword-reading Liquid from the same shop, which might have had a monopoly on the Sword-reading Liquid market. It seems quite possible that it's the Oneness Sky Palace that sells this Sword-reading Liquid.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, how could the Oneness Sky Palace tolerate this practice? If Zheng sells it alone, it's likely to create some sort of trouble," Beldene uttered.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded as he released the Truth of Godly Way. "I agree with Beldene.</p>

  <p>It's reasonable to assume this could be an issue."</p>

  <p>Beldene had spoken the words Zheng had been thinking. It must be the Oneness Sky Palace that sold the Sword-reading Liquid, so he'd best tread carefully.</p>

  <p>To think they actually did such a thing, Zheng began to get a bad feeling about the Oneness Sky Palace, and only time would tell if this feeling was misplaced or not.</p>

  <p>"You can have this."</p>

  <p>"This is for you."</p>

  <p>"This one is yours..."</p>

  <p>Zheng began handing out the Sword-reading Liquid to the disciples one by one.</p>

  <p>The heavy jade bottles thrilled every disciple. A small bottle cost 20, 000 divine crystals. They were blessed to have such a precious object in their hands.</p>

  <p>After they all had their Sword-reading Liquid, a discussion began among them.</p>

  <p>"How do we use it?"</p>

  <p>"Do we apply it to the sword?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps we should drink it..."</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't know either, but he believed with so many people around, they would figure it out soon enough.</p>

  <p>They waited for another hour, and then the huge wall not far away suddenly began to tremble.</p>

  <p>'Rumble...'</p>

  <p>The trembling excited the crowd, and the anticipation of the next steps they would take began to build.</p>

  <p>"It's begun!"</p>

  <p>"God bless me. I must cross it this time!"</p>

  <p>"This is the most important challenge of my life!"</p>

  <p>People of all ages and genders lingered beneath the Sword Wall. Some had been trapped under here for as long as they could remember and every time this challenge was just as great to them.</p>

  <p>As the Sword Wall continued to shake, the long swords that were attached to it all fell off.</p>

  <p>"Clang! Clang! Clang..."</p>

  <p>The long swords collided in a metallic thunder as they fell. After falling a bit, the swords seemed to possess a mind of their own and flew towards the other side of the wall, like a storm of swords had rained down from the sky.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the long swords which had been attached to the wall had now disappeared completely.</p>

  <p>A young man in a white robe walked out of the Sword Wall and said in a low voice, "The Sword Wall has been opened. Anyone who wishes to join the Oneness Sky Palace can hang your sword on the wall. In doing this, you may climb over the Sword Wall!"</p>

  <p>Hearing these words, the disciples of the Sword Light Palace were stunned.</p>

  <p>This was much simpler than they imagined and only served to boost their confidence.</p>

  <p>"How hard could it be!"</p>

  <p>"Don't take it lightly.</p>

  <p>Hanging the sword on the wall is not that easy."</p>

  <p>Most of them then took out the small jade bottles and gulped down the Sword-reading Liquid in one swig before rushing to the Sword Wall. It was time.</p>
