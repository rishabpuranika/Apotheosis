<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2282 Dongfang Clan </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Her name is Pearl Dongfang, ranked second in the Hall of True Gods,"</p>

  <p>Quentin answered.</p>

  <p>'Pearl Dongfang?'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng knew he heard this name before but hadn't paid that much attention to it.</p>

  <p>Currently, the top three low-rank True Gods in the Hall of True Gods were as follows: Ling Shuang Mu, Pearl Dongfang, and Han Liusu Han.</p>

  <p>They were all women which hadn't really happened before.</p>

  <p>Harold also mentioned Dongfang Clan in his speech earlier. This clan ranked first among the Floating Islands. Luo Zheng hadn't come in contact with any of the low-rank True Gods of the Dongfang Clan yet.</p>

  <p>Since they were ranked first, it was only natural to assume that the Dongfang Clan had very high points at their disposal. Luo Zheng couldn't be too sure though since he never met any of them as he fought his way up the Hall of True Gods.</p>

  <p>"Why does she want to see me?" he asked. He didn't really know this so-called Pearl Dongfang after all.</p>

  <p>Quentin shook his head. "I don't know. I'm just here to deliver a message.</p>

  <p>You can go ask her if you want. I admit defeat now."</p>

  <p>With their battle ended, Luo Zheng immediately made his way to the door.</p>

  <p>From the doorway, he had a good view of the spiraling rooms in the Hall of True Gods. The height he was on indicated that he was almost at its peak.</p>

  <p>Each time he pushed open the door of his room, a crowd always awaited him which always caught him by surprise.</p>

  <p>A few True Gods simply stared at him in silence, not daring to come close, including Han Liusu and Ling Shuang, while a woman stood beside the door, waiting with a calm expression.</p>

  <p>This woman's face was covered with light blue gauze, revealing only her eyes that reflected a faint ray of light. Despite having her face covered, her eyes were terribly expressive and were enough to convey a thousand words to anyone who looked into them.</p>

  <p>"You're finally out," she said.</p>

  <p>"Are you Pearl Dongfang?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>The woman smiled and nodded in reply.</p>

  <p>Pearl Dongfang rarely came to the Hall of True Gods during this period of time. She heard about the anonymous man but never really had the chance to come into contact with him since he never went out of his room.</p>

  <p>Her status on the Floating Islands was far beyond Zheng's imagination.</p>

  <p>As Quentin emphasized, her words were law. A mere statement from her was absolute and could not be disobeyed. He didn't fight Luo Zheng seriously and merely imparted what Pearl wanted him to say because she ordered him to.</p>

  <p>Under normal circumstances, Quentin would've fought his best.</p>

  <p>"Do you also want to challenge me?" Luo Zheng asked directly.</p>

  <p>Despite this woman coming from the first-ranked clan among the Floating Islands, Luo Zheng did not see it fit to warrant her any special treatment mostly because he didn't really have a good first impression of the Dongfang Clan and also because they were on Harold's list.</p>

  <p>To Luo Zheng, these wealthy clans Harold had listed belonged to the same force, with Dongfang Clan as the most prosperous. They were his enemies as far as he was concerned.</p>

  <p>Pearl shook her head. "I'm not interested in your points."</p>

  <p>"What is it then?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I heard that you've cultivated the Buddha Emperor Sword in the Gods Killing Sword Array. You most probably inherited it from Joy from the Purple Soul Hall, right? I'm not sure how you cultivated the third stage of the Power Shaping but I think you're qualified," she started saying out of the blue.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng frowned. "Qualified for what?"</p>

  <p>"To join our Dongfang Clan," she said, her tone surprisingly firm, leaving him no room to argue.</p>

  <p>Both Ling Shuang and Han Liusu frowned when they heard this. A few other disciples of the wealthy clans also seemed unhappy.</p>

  <p>The Dongfang Clan was still domineering as usual.</p>

  <p>Since he performed the Buddha Emperor Sword and had said those words to her after Harold's fighting, Han Liusu was almost certain he was Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He had been in Joy's palace and learned the Buddha Emperor Sword, how could the anonymous man be anyone else but him?</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng refused to admit it so Han Liusu couldn't really say anything. Besides, there was still a chance that it had all been coincidences.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shook his head. "I refuse," he replied to Pearl. He never expected to come out of his room for such a thing.</p>

  <p>Despite the rejection, Pearl didn't seem to be annoyed at all. "This is a great opportunity for many people. Even if they ask, they won't be able to get it. You don't have to give it up."</p>

  <p>"I've already joined another Floating Island. I'm not going to change my position," Luo Zheng insisted.</p>

  <p>"We will talk to the Han Clan. There is no need to worry about it," Pearl countered.</p>

  <p>Han Liusu couldn't help but huff in anger when she heard this. Pearl clearly knew that the anonymous man belonged to the Han Clan but still insisted he join the Dongfang Clan. It was no secret that all disciples were afraid and wary of this first-ranked clan. They could offend either the Sword Clan or the Moon Clan, but never the Dongfang Clan.</p>

  <p>As time went by, the disciples strictly avoided incurring any conflict from the people of the Dongfang Clan.</p>

  <p>However, Han Liusu couldn't help but burst out, having taken great offense by Pearl's complete disregard for the Han Clan. As she took a step forward, Ling Shuang couldn't help but sneer, "Shouldn't you mind your own business?"</p>

  <p>"Shouldn't you?" Han Liusu shot back.</p>

  <p>"You know that the Dongfang Clan is always like this. Their people see no reason," Ling Shuang reminded her.</p>

  <p>The Mu Clan and the Dongfang Clan had a good relationship but it was more of a superior-subordinate type of alliance. Holy Beings of various wealthy clans also had disputes in the Hall of Holy Beings. The Dongfang Clan always held the upper hand. Aside from the Moon Clan and the Sword Clan, nobody else dared to come in conflict with them.</p>

  <p>Han Liusu snorted in reply to Ling Shuang. She could let other things pass, but not this one.</p>

  <p>However, before she could even open her mouth, Luo Zheng already had an answer. "This has nothing to do with the Han Clan!"</p>

  <p>Pearl, however, still looked indifferent. "It also has nothing to do with you whether you join our clan or not."</p>

  <p>She was always polite and did not have an overbearing attitude mostly because she didn't take Zheng's opinion seriously. The Dongfang Clan always got what it wanted after all. Even if the Holy Emperor of the Han Clan himself didn't want to give Luo Zheng up, he would have no choice if her clan insisted on having the young man.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings were divided into different classes and the Holy Emperor of the Han Clan was considered to be at the top, however, he was no better than Mike who had been so excellent many years ago.</p>

  <p>Mike was one of the few who refused to bow down to the Dongfang Clan, but he ended up dying.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng looked into Pearl's beautiful eyes, he saw nothing but contempt.</p>

  <p>He had already joined the Purple Soul Hall and even if he wasn't in the Floating Islands, he would still refuse the invitation. There was a ten-second pause as the two of them stared each other down. Then, Luo Zheng broke the silence with a chuckle. "I don't know if it's because I didn't make myself clear or if there's something wrong with your head.</p>

  <p>Whatever the case, I can only tell you these two words."</p>

  <p>"What?" Pearl asked.</p>

  <p>Zheng's nose flared. "Fuck off!" he exclaimed before going back into his room and slamming the door shut in his wake.</p>

  <p>The Hall of True Gods was rendered completely silent.</p>

  <p>It had been many years since the Dongfang Clan rose into power. Their disciples were even more distinguished than other warriors and everyone else was extremely cautious when dealing with them.</p>

  <p>However, this anonymous man just scolded Pearl, even insinuating that there was something wrong with her head. It was a very big offense.</p>

  <p>The anonymous man, in effect, had just signed his own death sentence for having gone against the Dongfang Clan.</p>

  <p>None of them were aware of the fact that Luo Zheng was already set on leaving the Floating Islands, as per Harold's suggestion.</p>

  <p>Ling Shuang was extremely surprised by how things turned out, not expecting the anonymous man to be so bold.</p>

  <p>Han Liusu, meanwhile, was delighted and couldn't help but notice the anonymous man's temperament to be completely in line with Zheng's.</p>
