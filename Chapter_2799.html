<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2799 Fighting Those Cold Fiends </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>The Cold Fiends puffed for a while before their mouths and eyes slowly closed and gradually, they began to fall in a deep slumber.</p>

  <p>The deadly chill surrounding the atmosphere came to a halt.</p>

  <p>Everyone knew that this was the interval they were waiting for.</p>

  <p>However, at this moment, Nicholas appeared to hesitate.</p>

  <p>There was no way below!</p>

  <p>"What should we do now?"</p>

  <p>"Are we going to jump?"</p>

  <p>"..."</p>

  <p>Just as everyone had no idea on what to do next, the woman's voice was heard once again. "Keep going down!"</p>

  <p>"Keep going down? How do we keep going down?" Clark asked, his face full of anger.</p>

  <p>"The Cold Fiends' lair is unique inside. Just destroy it," the woman simply said, unaffected by his angry tone.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you do it yourself?" Zeke snarled and was angry too.</p>

  <p>Even though the Cold Fiends were quite weak, the chill they spewed out was irresistible. The Holy Beings still had to be on guard and careful.</p>

  <p>And to make it worse, there were probably over a million Cold Fiends in this huge lair. Who would be brave enough to dare act rashly?</p>

  <p>Because they used the time to exchange words with each other during the interval time, their chance to move had already passed. The Cold Fiends at once opened their eyes and big mouths, and continued to spit out cold air.</p>

  <p>"Do as what I said in the next interval. Otherwise, don't blame me for being unkind," the woman demanded this time.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings and the Demi-holy Beings exchanged looks upon hearing her words and were urged to act.</p>

  <p>They felt that the woman indeed had no sense.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the consummate True Gods were shrinking behind.</p>

  <p>Their faces were full of panic.</p>

  <p>"We can't protect ourselves if we really offend so many Cold Fiends,"</p>

  <p>Shahn refuted, and his expression had turned gloomy.</p>

  <p>He noticed that the consummate True Gods had been trembling all the way.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the Holy Beings present were their elders and even their fathers. They were protecting them well from the dangers.</p>

  <p>As a result, the consummate True Gods had fewer deaths than the Demi-holy Beings.</p>

  <p>They feared that if they would really break into the Cold Fiends' lair as ordered by the woman, the Holy Beings would not be able to look after them. They would be left to tend for their selves. A great number of consummate True Gods would definitely perish if that event happened.</p>

  <p>"What can that woman do with us if we just huddle up in the groove?"</p>

  <p>Walton wondered and voiced out.</p>

  <p>"Haha..." Rachelle shook her head with a bitter smile, and commented,</p>

  <p>"Don't be that stupid, okay? That woman holds as many cards as we do.</p>

  <p>Moreover, she is located above. We will suffer if those Cold Fiends are disturbed by her. Wouldn't we die faster if we hid in this narrow groove?"</p>

  <p>"Then what should we do..." Walton was enlightened and asked with his eyes wide open.</p>

  <p>In the past, the consummate True Gods had thought that their elders were omnipotent. But when they arrived at this damned place, even the Holy Beings' strength appeared so weak.</p>

  <p>Two consummate True Gods and a Demi-holy Being from the Qin Clan heard the words being spoken. Their faces immediately turned ghastly pale.</p>

  <p>Abelard could be resurrected in the universe, but the process wouldn't be fast as they expected. It would still take much time.</p>

  <p>Everyone stared at the cold air until five minutes had quickly passed.</p>

  <p>The Cold Fiends once again closed their eyes and mouths, and another time for interval started.</p>

  <p>"Since you haven't reached an agreement, I will give you a push..."</p>

  <p>The woman's cold voice sounded, and then a golden flame floated down from above.</p>

  <p>As soon as the flame fell on the Cold Fiends' lair, it suddenly burst forth.</p>

  <p>Spark!</p>

  <p>The flame bust and raged as it instantly engulfed the area covering a few hundred feet.</p>

  <p>It didn't kill the Cold Fiends but the flame instead had only awakened all of them.</p>

  <p>All of the Cold Fiends that had just fallen asleep quickly opened their eyes and rushed out of the hexagonal grids.</p>

  <p>"Argh!" they all roared in a low voice, in order to antagonize their enemy.</p>

  <p>They acted like bees guarding the honey nests. Once intruders came, they would swarm up and attack as soon as possible, killing all potential enemies.</p>

  <p>Countless Cold Fiends moved and flocked quickly forming a circle at the bottom.</p>

  <p>Soon, they smelled a strange odor. They followed the smell and gathered in front of the groove. It was where the ally of great clans had stayed.</p>

  <p>"Ahhh!"</p>

  <p>Their heads produced strange sounds that summoned more companions.</p>

  <p>In just a few seconds, more than a hundred thousand Cold Fiends had been gathered.</p>

  <p>They piled up and made a wall. After they created a certain formation, their mouths slowly opened.</p>

  <p>"We're doomed..." Shahn cried with a grieved expression.</p>

  <p>The scene was too extreme to grasp as everyone was at a loss.</p>

  <p>Just then, they suddenly felt a warm current coming from behind them.</p>

  <p>Someone looked back and saw the figure of Nicholas holding a round bag.</p>

  <p>This was exactly the same bag that he used for the Explosive Crystals. After absorbing the Explosive Crystals, the bag was put in his space ring.</p>

  <p>However, the Explosive Crystals didn't disappear.</p>

  <p>Time was on a loop and kept repeating inside the bag. The Explosive Crystals went through a constant cycle of explosions and recovery.</p>

  <p>Nicholas acted and untied his bag. The powerful energy inside the bag was released following a straight line.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>The action had made everyone feel that their eardrums had burst.</p>

  <p>The small amount of energy still made their hair burn.</p>

  <p>As the energy of the Explosive Crystals was released, the over a hundred thousand Cold Fiends started to puff cold air at the same time.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>Two kinds of opposing energy collided, the Explosive Crystals against the cold air from the Cold Fiends. The energy flow of the Explosive Crystals had in no time occupied the absolute upper hand.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the cold air had disappeared completely the moment it met the red energy flow.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>The red energy bust forth without any damage from the cold air. It flowed as it hit the wall of the Cold Fiends in a fast speed.</p>

  <p>It smashed the Cold Fiends to pieces.</p>

  <p>"Bravo!"</p>

  <p>"This is the power of the Explosive Crystals!"</p>

  <p>"If Holy Nicholas had not used this bag to collect the Explosive Crystals, we would have died up there!"</p>

  <p>Everyone had already witnessed and known that the Explosive Crystals were powerful.</p>

  <p>It was still beyond their expectation that their power would be so amazing.</p>

  <p>Unbeknownst to them as they rejoiced, Nicholas' attack had stirred something big. The attack that killed more than a hundred thousand Cold Fiends at that time had spread all over the Cold Fiends' lair.</p>

  <p>Under the vibration of their lair, the remaining Cold Fiends inside flew into the air. These creatures obviously started a higher level of vigilance.</p>

  <p>"If we stay here, we'll definitely die. We have to rush out! Follow me! Let's not face those Cold Fiends head on!" Nicholas shouted and ordered.</p>

  <p>He led the group and rushed out first in a flash.</p>

  <p>The rest of the Holy Beings, Demi-holy Beings and consummate True Gods quickly followed him.</p>

  <p>The Cold Fiends flew around. Recognizing their target, they began to spit out cold air.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>The milky white cold air, like fatal light, was shot around above the lair.</p>

  <p>There was chaos as all the people fled in anxiousness.</p>

  <p>Nicholas was the fastest, hovering above the Cold Fiends' lair like an eagle.</p>

  <p>His extraordinary movement caught the attention of most Cold Fiends.</p>

  <p>The Cold Fiends flew over and puffed cold air behind Nicholas.</p>

  <p>Nicholas, being alert, seemed to be able to foresee the path of the cold air in advance. He moved and dodged swiftly among the cold air, and unexpectedly led these Cold Fiends to fly up.</p>
