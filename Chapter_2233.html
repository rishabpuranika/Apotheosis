<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The rich clans had introduced many rules and regulations among them.</p>

  <p>Some rules were written on the Ruling Slate, while some on the Hall of Holy Beings. Some were even the rules of the various rich clans and the sect rules.</p>

  <p>There was also a rule among the young men from the rich clans.</p>

  <p>The top-rank True God said to Grant, "Keep one thing in mind. No matter what you do to protect the princesses of the Han Clan, ensure you do not displease these children from the noble clans. Else you will be punished severely! If these warriors begin to fight with each other, you better stay away and watch from a distance. Don't involve in their fighting."</p>

  <p>It was a set rule that servants were not allowed to engage in fights among the core disciples of the rich clans.</p>

  <p>Aleyna was all set to challenge Zheng who was appreciated for his remarkable talent by Kelsey.</p>

  <p>However, she was now in a towering rage and rushed towards the nearest proving godly warrior.</p>

  <p>To make matters worse, she had clearly heard the warrior make some crude remarks with lustful eyes. She vehemently despised such people and to top it, she was ranked second among all the proving godly warriors!</p>

  <p>Hiss...</p>

  <p>The two rays of red light elongated and transformed into a mesmerizing blood-red pattern. It charged towards the reckless proving godly warrior!</p>

  <p>The pattern exuded an aura of murderous intent, creating an illusion of situating in the Abyss Demon Region. No matter where one stood, they would be affected by the surging malicious aura.</p>

  <p>The top-rank True Gods and mid-rank True Gods seemed to be unaware about the turn of events. They were not affected by this aura.</p>

  <p>But some of the low-rank True Gods felt their hearts suddenly race.</p>

  <p>Their blood pumped so much adrenaline that they were filled with an intention to kill others.</p>

  <p>The proving godly warrior, Egbert Zhou, who was about to be covered by the blood-red pattern was the core disciple of the Zhou Clan.</p>

  <p>The Zhou Clan's Floating Island was only ranked in the middle on the Time Sea. It could be regarded as a middle level island, but it was still guarded by a Holy Being. Although this clan did not showcase any extraordinary talent, they were socially active and were on good terms with other clans. It also maintained its own position and rank in the past few years.</p>

  <p>Egbert Zhou never realized that the younger daughter of the Holy Emperor of the Han Clan was so stubborn and reckless that she was just randomly going to kill him for no fault of his.</p>

  <p>The disciples from rich clans on the Floating Islands were all bossy and cruel by nature, but it was the first time that Egbert Zhou had met such a fierce and domineering woman. He was not prepared for such kind of behavior.</p>

  <p>Even if Egbert Zhou managed to maintain his composure, he was still no match compared to Aleyna.</p>

  <p>Aleyna was ranked second among the proving godly warriors, while Egbert Zhou was ranked beyond 80th. The two of them had confronted each other in the Arena of Legends twice, but Egbert Zhou lost in a very short period of time during each round.</p>

  <p>Warriors would not really die in the Arena of Legends, so Egbert Zhou could still hang on there. Now the blood-red pattern rushed towards him with a murderous intent making him so scared that he couldn't help but shout out for help.</p>

  <p>Zheng stood on the other side and watched the scene indifferently.</p>

  <p>He had already made the decision. Since he did not intend to show up in the first place, he would not make a move to interfere.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't care what the disciples from the rich clans were going to do or how they would stop. It had nothing to do with him. He didn't even bother to watch their attitude towards the current situation.</p>

  <p>If Zheng's father was still alive, and the Luo Clan was not destroyed, Zheng might have also grown up among the rich clans and become a member of these noble clan children. But there was no point mulling over events he could not control. He was not a member of this group. From the moment he was born, he was destined to fulfill the mission that was more substantial than that of these noble clan children.</p>

  <p>If Egbert Zhou died here, it would bring great trouble to the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>The Zhou Clan wasn't even worth mentioning in terms of the ranking, but with the friendly relationships with many other wealthy and influential clans, it would eventually bring trouble to the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>However, Aleyna did not think much on those lines. Ever since she had made great achievements in the Arena of Legends, she had never been bullied like this by her peers!</p>

  <p>However, before Aleyna's blood-red pattern could surround Egbert Zhou, a short figure appeared unexpectedly. He was very flexible, and he had a silver flute in his hand. He raised the flute slightly, and a ball of silver light was formed and rolled towards the blood-red pattern.</p>

  <p>The blood-red pattern contained an immense killing power. But the silver light seemed even more powerful because it immediately coated the blood-red pattern, making it look like fluid mercury.</p>

  <p>The original blood-red mark had now turned into a silver colored mark, totally exiting from Aleyna's control. Egbert Zhou was immensely relieved to have survived this situation by a hair's breadth.</p>

  <p>"It's been only a few days, since the last time we met. But you have great potential by reaching such a high level. I think you are now capable of challenging an ordinary True God." The man holding the silver flute said with a smile. He was Keenan Liu from the Liu Clan, and had reached the cultivation base of a True God. It was not appropriate for him to fight against Aleyna now, as he was much powerful than Aleyna.</p>

  <p>The Liu Clan's Floating Island ranked the last among all of the islands.</p>

  <p>The clan members were always on their toes, for they felt crisis might befall on them anytime.</p>

  <p>The clan would be qualified to be called a big clan only when its island was above the Time Sea. Till date the Liu Clan's foundation was still unstable.</p>

  <p>If the Liu Clan continued to fall behind other clans, its Floating Island would drop into the Time Sea, and its position would be replaced by another powerful clan. That was why, in the divine land, there were countless first-tier clans who were eyeing the Liu Clan's Floating Island to succumb. Once the Liu Clan was eliminated, other first-tier clans would be ready to compete for the vacant position.</p>

  <p>Although the Liu Clan's Floating Island ranked at the bottom, Keenan Liu, the low-rank True God, holding the silver flute, possessed immense strength and was ranked in the top 50 in the Arena of Legends. He was among the top 50 low-rank True Gods, while Aleyna was just ranked second among the proving godly warriors.</p>

  <p>The difference in strength between them was too wide. Hence Aleyna was no match for Keenan Liu.</p>

  <p>By virtue of his advantage in cultivation base, Keenan Liu could easily stop Aleyna's attack. Many people would have chosen to prevent from being in this situation, if they were in Keenan Liu's position. However, Keenan Liu became more interested in dealing with Aleyna today. After waving the flute, he smiled arrogantly and said, "I've heard so much about you. Well, today I'm going to compete with you!"</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, he slightly shook the silver flute in his hand, and a crisp whistling sound came out from it. It contained the soul method in it, which could make the soul go numb for an instant.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Aleyna felt that her spiritual sense went numb and blank. She just could not feel or think any more. It seemed like she was rooted to her place, without being able to move her limbs.</p>

  <p>By the time she could understand the situation, Keenan Liu had already placed his hand on her shoulder. He said in a low voice, "A wonderful night filled with the pleasant sound of a phoenix flute..." Before he could finish chanting, Aleyna came to her senses. There was bloody mist emitting from her body. And her innocent face transformed itself into a fierce one.</p>

  <p>All this while, Liusu was upset. Neither did she want to see Aleyna killing innocent people here, nor did she want to see her being molested by the disciple from a rich clan. However, as she was about to help Aleyna, Langston, her fiance stood in front of her.</p>

  <p>Langston said coldly, "Aleyna is a little bad-tempered, and it's not a bad thing for her to spar with Keenan. Keenan has the sense of propriety and might drive some sense into her."</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Liusu felt outraged. "Spar with him?" She knew that all of those noble clan disciples were not only powerful, but also eloquent.</p>

  <p>She just said coldly, "Get out of my way!"</p>

  <p>Langston shook his head and smiled. "You are not supposed to talk to me with that tone, but I still find it appealing!" he uttered.</p>

  <p>Langston was not afraid of Liusu's counterattack as he said those words. After all he was the top mid-rank True God, while Liusu had just mastered the Godly Way. Liusu was no match for him. Since Langston stood in front of Liusu, it was impossible for the latter to make any move.</p>

  <p>Grant who was in the hall was now sweating profusely. He was the guard responsible for protecting both Liusu and Aleyna. Faced with the current dilemma, he felt helpless. What should he do? What if anything untoward happened to the two sisters of the Han Clan? He knew he would be in a very grave situation if he failed to protect them.</p>

  <p>"Humph! How dare you bully my sister!"</p>

  <p>Kelsey shouted angrily when she saw that Keenan Liu was bullying Aleyna with the silver flute.</p>

  <p>But Kelsey's strength was inferior to that of Aleyna. It was an easy job for Keenan Liu to deal with the two girls. He enveloped both of them in the silver light that spread from his silver flute. All this while, he was stroking Aleyna's face from time to time, taking advantage of her position under the flute's spell.</p>

  <p>When the other rich clan disciples witnessed this scene, they merely started laughing. They showed no intention to prevent Keenan Liu, and even made fun of Aleyna.</p>

  <p>Zheng had never expected that the situation in the hall would create such a turn of events. Earlier he had planned to leave without anyone's notice, but now, he realized it would be difficult to do so. He silently shook his head and walked towards Aleyna.</p>
