<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Those rumors were not completely wrong. The Dark Nether Death Light had indeed come from the core area. To be exact, it was being emitted by the red dot!</p>

  <p>As the fog rose and covered it, the Dark Nether Death Light in the Dark Nether Cave was becoming weaker, which was why many creatures in the Tower of Sin had enjoyed the occasional chance to enter the cave.</p>

  <p>But now, as the group slowly approached that red dot, the Dark Nether Death Light became brighter, and it posed an even greater threat to everyone on the journey to the core.</p>

  <p>Thanks to the thick fog, they could still manage to resist the Dark Nether Death Light at first. But as they drew closer to the red dot, the power of the Dark Nether Death Light was becoming stronger. How would they be able to withstand it when they finally reached it?</p>

  <p>When this question entered their minds unbidden, everyone began to hesitate again, and their pace decreased…</p>

  <p>Previously, they had thought that, 'no risk, no reward'. They had hoped that if they shook off all of their worries and kept moving forward towards the core, there might be an opportunity which might present itself to get them out of there.</p>

  <p>But now, they knew without a doubt that they were heading down a path of no return. No one knew what awaited them, whether there were some extremely powerful beasts or monsters waiting for them in the core or not, but they all knew with certainty that just the Dark Nether Death Light alone was enough to claim their lives!</p>

  <p>"I'll stop here! If I go any further, I will definitely die. The Dark Nether Death Light alone is powerful enough to kill me!" Shane crumpled down to the ground in a pitiful heap. Fear had gnawed at his fragile courage.</p>

  <p>The rest also stopped. Although Shane was a little timid, what he had said was right. No one present could resist the Dark Nether Death Light.</p>

  <p>At this point, Yolande glanced at Shane. Perhaps she too was exhausted, so she gently lifted up the hem of her dress and sat down beside Zheng. She muttered, "It's the same whether we keep walking or not."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Malcom asked, confused.</p>

  <p>Yolande wrapped her arms around her knees and said lightly, "You will know in a little while."</p>

  <p>Malcom was already used to Yolande's strange manner and he stopped asking. They had traveled for half a day, so they decided to rest here for the time being.</p>

  <p>Esther retrieved a water bottle from her space ring and raised her head to drink. Everyone else also took the opportunity to get some rest. The danger fraught journey had taken its toll on their bodies and minds.</p>

  <p>However, not long after they had sat down to take a break, Fabian pointed at the horizon and said in a trembling voice, "That, that red dot! It seems to have grown bigger…"</p>

  <p>Everyone looked up with fear and suspicion written on their tired faces.</p>

  <p>Indeed, even though they had stopped, the red dot had still grown larger!</p>

  <p>"What…what is going on?" Shane cradled his head in his hands, his face full of despair.</p>

  <p>Thinking of what Yolande had just said, Malcom glared at her and said coldly, "You knew about it from the beginning?"</p>

  <p>Yolande nodded and said seriously, "Yes. Even if we don't move, we will still be dragged near to the red dot by the Space Law…"</p>

  <p>Only then did everyone understand why the red dot had become larger to them. This fog was like a gigantic trap made of quicksand! It had sucked them closer to oblivion! Now that they had stepped into the trap, they would not be able to escape. No matter how hard they struggled, it was utterly useless. Worse, the more they struggled, the faster they would fall into the mire of death!</p>

  <p>This bleak realization lowered everyone's spirits and scraped the very bottom of their supply of courage. Their frustrations were ready to reach boiling point.</p>

  <p>Noticing Yolande's calm face, Malcom suddenly raised his eyebrows. "You, why aren't you afraid?"</p>

  <p>With a cold voice, Xun said, "Of course she's not afraid!"</p>

  <p>"Why? Does she have some other way to keep herself safe?" Malcom asked again, his voice rising in pitch.</p>

  <p>Xun didn't bother to answer Malcom's question. How could she explain that the Yolande which they saw was just one of her incarnations; it was only one of a million separate bodies which Yolande controlled. Even if the current incarnation died, it would only be a minor loss to her!</p>

  <p>After they had rested for some time, Esther rose to her feet and said, "Okay, let's continue on our way!"</p>

  <p>Everyone continued moving forward in a drudging silence. Not long after they had set off again, they encountered something that they had not yet seen in the dense fog before. There were white objects scattered about the ground which they walked over.</p>

  <p>When they got closer, they saw that these were actually bones! The bones were scattered all around them in all directions. It was a massive necropolis!</p>

  <p>"Those are... human bones!" Fabian screamed, his voice shrill by fear.</p>

  <p>Jarrod bent down and reached out his hand to pick one up. However, just as his fingers touched the bone, it immediately turned into a cloud of dust and disintegrated into the air!</p>

  <p>"How many years have they been here? They actually turn into dust at just a gentle touch," Jarrod said as he shook his head in disbelief.</p>

  <p>As they continued to advance, more and more bones were seen lying on the ground, scattered about like a child's toys. The road in front of them was no longer flat, and before them a crater emerged from the fog. It was a deep hole in the ground ahead of them.</p>

  <p>Right at this moment, Yolande's eyes began glistering in a disquieting way.</p>

  <p>Then, she placed her slender index finger on her lips. It was a sign to remind others to keep quiet.</p>

  <p>Although Yolande had always appeared strange and fey in the other warriors' eyes, she knew the Dark Nether Cave better than anyone else.</p>

  <p>When she signaled to everyone to keep quiet, all the others immediately became silent and reached high alert. They looked at her carefully, trying to figure out what she would do next.</p>

  <p>There was no expression on her face as she continued to walk towards the center of the crater filled with white bones!</p>

  <p>While she was walking, the bones turned into dust under her wooden clogs and the dust sifted down like a powdery rain on the ground...</p>

  <p>This crater was a huge grave, filled with countless bones half-buried in the soil. Who knew how many bodies, how many bones, were buried there?</p>

  <p>There were even more bones protruding from the bottom of the crater. The bones were piled up into a small mountain roughly a few dozen feet high.</p>

  <p>Treading lightly on her wooden clogs, Yolande carefully walked to the hill formed by so many bones. Everyone around became even more nervous.</p>

  <p>Who knew what kind of demonic beast was hidden inside this hill of bones!</p>

  <p>After all they were now in the core area! Moreover, they had traveled for so long that this was probably the very center of the core area. It wouldn't be strange if an extremely powerful demonic beast suddenly appeared here!</p>

  <p>Their nerves were raw from abuse and they fully expected to be stormed by ferocious demonic beasts.</p>

  <p>Right at this dreaded moment, Yolande took a deep breath, and suddenly activated the power of the Wind Law. She blew at the hill of bones in front of her.</p>

  <p>It was just a simple blown out breath but as it contained the power of the Wind Law, the air coming out from her mouth immediately turned into a strong gust which roared forth.</p>

  <p>Those bones had been there for such a long time that no one knew exactly how long. As the wind blew, the small hill of bones turned into dust which was further blown away by Yolande!</p>

  <p>The entire crater which had been full of bones was suddenly covered in fine white dust. Yolande's figure was already covered until it became obscured within the dust. No one could see her...</p>

  <p>After a long while, the dust finally settled down, and Yolande's figure appeared again. Everyone then saw a corpse in front of her. It was a mummy!</p>

  <p>This mummy sat cross-legged, maintaining a posture showing that he was in the process of cultivation. Unlike the other bones, this mummy was still in perfect condition, even after so many years. One could even distinguish its features!</p>

  <p>Soon, a shocking scene unfolded. Yolande reached out her arms and actually embraced the mummy. While holding the mummy in her arms, Yolande softly said, "I've finally found you…"</p>

  <p>"What is she doing?" Zheng asked in horror while staring at Yolande.</p>

  <p>Xun looked dispassionately at her and said, "If I'm not mistaken, that's the leader of your human's True Sun World and also Yolande's brother."</p>

  <p>"So, Yolande's brother died here." Zheng nodded his head with sudden insight.</p>

  <p>Hearing the conversation between Xun and Zheng, Malcom's and Esther's gazes flickered. Someone at the level of the leader of a world was a notion too distant for them to fully grasp. Even the big shots of the Upper World would never notice the Sea God Continent. However, since this mummy was a world lord and he died here, everyone wondered what kind of treasure he had left with him at this place. It could be beyond their wildest imaginings!</p>

  <p>Thinking of this, the eyes of Malcom and those of several others with him became greedy.</p>

  <p>They knew it would be very difficult for them to leave this place. However, as the saying went, 'Man proposes, god disposes'. If they could somehow manage to successfully leave this place and they missed such a good opportunity, they would regret it for the rest of their lives.</p>

  <p>Thinking of this, Malcom took a step forward and rushed towards the bottom of the crater.</p>

  <p>At this point, Yolande took a bracelet off from the mummy's wrist. There was a golden skylark that hung at the end of the bracelet.</p>

  <p>"A space bracelet?" Weapon refiners could create Sumeru Space storage items in many forms. It could be a ring or a bracelet. Malcom's eyes flashed with excitement at the sight of the space bracelet. Just as he was about to reach out his hand to grab it, Yolande turned her head and warned him, "If you ever want to walk out of this fog, I'd advise you to keep your hands away from this."</p>

  <p>Then all of the other warriors also walked down into the crater. Since Malcom seemed about to attack, Esther and the rest were on their guard.</p>

  <p>After all, Yolande belonged to the human race.</p>

  <p>When they heard Yolande's words, their eyes widened. Malcom asked in a deep voice, "You mean, you have a way to get out of this fog?"</p>

  <p>Yolande didn't respond. Instead, she put the bracelet carefully away, still quite expressionless. Then she took out a yellow talisman from her own space ring. She gently placed it on the mummy's chest. With a light touch, the mummy suddenly opened its eyes!</p>
