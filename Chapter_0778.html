<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 778 The Chasm (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon possessed such keen eyesight. Taking into consideration the fact that he thought plucking these herbs would not be worth it, Luo Luo Zheng didn't think twice about it and headed straight into the center of the herbal garden.</p>

  <p>A handful of the elders had been collecting these aforementioned herbs crazily. Imogen and Ning Yudie didn't stop them whatsoever.</p>

  <p>The Cloud Hall had its very own garden full of herbs just as well, but these herbs were worlds apart in terms of quality compared to those of the Cloud Hall. These elders appeared as if they were more than willing to put their lives on the line just to set foot inside the Immortal Mist's celestial tomb, because they were so eager to search for their own opportunities, and also, they wanted to receive their own share of benefits. For that very reason, Ning Yudie also permitted all of these elders to harvest these herbs themselves.</p>

  <p>In regard to the disciples of the Cloud Hall, each and every single one of them looked as though they were in cloud nine.</p>

  <p>The herbs they were picking were regarded as high-level herbs in the Cloud Hall, and every bit of it would be worth a ton of money. The fact of the matter was that the elders at the Virtual Tribulation Realm themselves considered them as high-level herbs as well. So, it should come as no surprise that the disciples at the Internal Elixir Realm gave these herbs so much significance.</p>

  <p>Despite the fact that they didn't dare to take the herbs in the middle of the herbal garden like the elders, they were already deeply contented with merely picking the ones which were at the garden's edge.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng leisurely walked over to the center of the herbal garden. Everyone among the elders simply cast sideways glances at him without paying him much attention.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng tilted his head looking at the ground and scanned the area. The herbal garden had been completely filled with black soil, but at that point in time, he noticed a patch of brown soil that was about the size of a palm just beneath his feet.</p>

  <p>"Is this what you refer to as the Swelling Earth?" Luo Luo Zheng asked out of curiosity.</p>

  <p>"That is correct. Just go ahead and dig it out. It will be of use to you when the time comes," the cyan dragon casually responded.</p>

  <p>Without uttering another word, Luo Luo Zheng pulled out his long sword, and with a swoosh, he pierced it right through the ground. Making four cuts around the earth, he carefully pried the Swelling Earth out.</p>

  <p>This object's appearance was like that of a brown lump of earth, but in contrast to what Luo Luo Zheng had in mind, it was exceedingly heavy. Even with the arm strength Luo Luo Zheng possessed at that point, it still felt quite heavy. The moment the Swelling Earth had been taken out, it began flowing ceaselessly, taking the shape of a small brown ball which gave off a metallic luster.</p>

  <p>It appeared that this object was neither metal nor earth; truly quite a fascinating thing.</p>

  <p>"What's that thing you're holding in your hand?" Emanuel's eyes glimmered as he approached Luo Luo Zheng and stretched out his hand.</p>

  <p>The other elders also got curious and shot him a glance to see the small brown ball Luo Luo Zheng was holding. They might not have been able to recognize what it was, but it was easy to tell that it couldn't just be some ordinary object.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie tried her best not to do anything to get involved. Generally speaking, the objects within the herbal garden would normally become the property of whoever it was that found them.</p>

  <p>Still, Emanuel was the first to react among the elders. From the looks of it, it was apparent that he had intended to catch Luo Luo Zheng unawares and seize the Swelling Earth away from him.</p>

  <p>With a quick flip of his palm, Luo Luo Zheng swiftly evaded Emanuel's grip.</p>

  <p>Thereafter, in just a blink of an eye, Luo Luo Zheng stored the sphere of Swelling Earth inside his space ring. Giving Emanuel a dull look, he asked, "What do you think you're doing?"</p>

  <p>Emanuel just laughed it off and told him, "It was nothing. It just piqued my curiosity a little bit, so I wanted to take a closer look."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng let out a deep sigh and turned his head to check around the area to see if there were any other herbs which he could make use of. He was aware that Emanuel was interested in stealing the Swelling Earth, but sadly for him, Luo Luo Zheng had fast reflexes. If Emanuel had succeeded in snatching it away from him, it would prove to be quite hard for him to take it back. He also thought that Ning Yudie wouldn't want to step in and pressure Emanuel to hand over the Swelling Earth.</p>

  <p>Also under the assumption that Ning Yudie wouldn't get involved, Emanuel had made up his mind to immediately take advantage of the situation and grab it as soon as he could. Unfortunately, he had not taken into account the possibility that Luo Luo Zheng would be so quick to react.</p>

  <p>It didn't take too long before the herbal garden in its entirety had already gotten fully harvested by everyone in that crowd. As a matter of fact, even the roots of those herbs had not been spared.</p>

  <p>When they were done gathering all of the herbs they could find, they didn't stay for too long and moved forward.</p>

  <p>At this point in time, something suddenly came to Luo Zheng's mind? he had seen the word "Gift" written at the entrance of the herbal garden. He found it quite bizarre that a herbal garden could be found in such a place, and the word "Gift" was even written on the ground as well. The only logical reason he could think of was that the owner of this celestial tomb must have intentionally designed it to be this way.</p>

  <p id="top_5"><a id="p3929" class="calibre2"></a>Enchanted lamps, a passageway, gift... Everything seemed as though Immortal Mist himself had been enticing people to visit this place and take away his belongings. Luo Luo Zheng couldn't shake off the ominous feeling for he had no clue whatsoever what could be the Immortal Mist's reason for doing it.</p>

  <p>Regardless of that, since he was already inside anyway, he had not much of a choice but to keep moving forward.</p>

  <p>Just a few moments after passing through the herbal garden, everyone came across a huge door. This door in particular was so peculiar? embedded on it were a number of much smaller doors. These doors had been laid out in a row. Giving it a good hard look, Luo Luo Zheng counted about forty-five small doors.</p>

  <p>"Why would there be so many small doors in it?" With her eyebrows deeply knit, Ning Yudie glanced at the doors.</p>

  <p>"We should just all walk into the same door," suggested Saint Morphens.</p>

  <p>It would be better to move together as a group when traversing an unfamiliar space. Recklessly moving on your own was strictly forbidden.</p>

  <p>Saint Morphens' suggestion was the natural course to take.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie was a bit reluctant at first, but she went ahead and swung a small door open. The instant she walked through, the door was shut behind her.</p>

  <p>"What just happened?" Luo Luo Zheng and Imogen furrowed their eyebrows simultaneously out of surprise.</p>

  <p>"Could it be that only one person can enter each door?" Reaching out to push the door, Luo Luo Zheng discovered that it wouldn't budge no matter what.</p>
