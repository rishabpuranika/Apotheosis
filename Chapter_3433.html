<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng was well-accustomed to the Space Law. He had a general understanding of its operation.</p>

  <p>Based on his first impression, Zheng thought that he must be trapped in some kind of space or within the depths of the space crack.</p>

  <p>However, he doubted this as he watched the scene unfolding right in front of his eyes.</p>

  <p>Inside his mind, No. 9527 seemed to go blank for a while. Finally, it said,</p>

  <p>"It's an unknown place."</p>

  <p>"Unknown? What do you mean?" There was a note of incredulity in Zheng's voice. This information had absolutely stunned Zheng.</p>

  <p>"The power displayed by Mount was the unique theurgy of a Chaos Ancient God," responded No. 9527. There was no other way of explaining it.</p>

  <p>When Zheng heard this, a sudden realization dawned upon him. "You mean to say that Mount has the blood of a Chaos Ancient God just like me? That explains so much."</p>

  <p>Any high-level energy could easily get rid of the restraint of a low-level energy.</p>

  <p>All the strong warriors who created the Chaotic Source World had highly exceptional abilities. Therefore, it was quite impossible for these young warriors to break the restrictions of the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>However, Mount was able to do it effortlessly. This only meant that the level of his energy was extremely high.</p>

  <p>After careful judgment of his current situation, Zheng finally settled on an answer. Mount could also use a truth-level theurgy much like him.</p>

  <p>"He is different from you, though," No. 9527 suddenly spoke and dismissed Zheng's conclusion.</p>

  <p>"Really? What's the difference between the two of us?" Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"He is a part of the Chaos Ancient God. He had been raised from infancy to adulthood with the blood of the Chaos Ancient God in him," replied No. 9527 in a low voice. It seemed that it was depressed.</p>

  <p>"You mean he is a Chaos Ancient God?!" Zheng was absolutely taken aback.</p>

  <p>A look of pure astonishment registered upon his face. After taking a long time to digest this news, he asked, "Earlier, you said that this is an unknown place. What exactly does that mean?"</p>

  <p>No. 9527 thought for a moment and replied, "Mount's theurgy is the space itself. He masters the bottom-layer space concept of the chaos. If we compare the chaos to a house, then what he did just now was to cut a corner and throw you and the half hand within this corner out of the house. In other words, he has deleted this space from the chaos."</p>

  <p>Zheng blinked as he tried to absorb what No. 9527 just said.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 had given an easily comprehensible explanation. However, it sounded quite unbelievable.</p>

  <p>"Are you implying that this place is outside of the chaos?" Zheng inquired. He was starting to get a little worried now.</p>

  <p>"I have no idea," No. 9527 answered honestly.</p>

  <p>"Unbelievable. Even you don't know," Zheng muttered dejectedly.</p>

  <p>At first, he thought it wouldn't be too difficult for him to go back. But now, he started feeling a faint surge of panic. He finally realized the gravity of this situation.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what's outside the chaos. Actually, even if my master came personally, he might not be able to answer that question as well," No. 9527 replied morosely.</p>

  <p>Every creature had their own understanding of space.</p>

  <p>To a tiny bug, the space it felt was probably just a few rooms, and the world outside the rooms was unimaginable for it.</p>

  <p>As for the humans and other mortal races, they were well-aware that mountains, seas, and continents existed within the space they inhabited.</p>

  <p>However, that was all they knew about.</p>

  <p>The warriors in the Source World knew that their world had an end. Huge crystal walls existed at the end of the world. These crystal walls were steadfast and immovable. Only the True Gods were able to pass through them.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the True Gods in the Source World had a deeper understanding that the crystal walls divided the Source World into large provinces. Outside those provinces, it was the boundless and immeasurable chaos.</p>

  <p>However, the chaos had borders as well. Only the supreme masters in the Source World and the Chaos Ancient Gods knew about the existence of these borders.</p>

  <p>For example, the bottom of the chaos was a border at the lowest level.</p>

  <p>Up until now, no one had any idea what it was like outside the borders. The world outside the chaos was totally incomprehensible.</p>

  <p>Zheng pursed his lips. He perfectly understood that it wasn't that No. 9527 didn't want to tell him. It genuinely had no idea either.</p>

  <p>His gaze swept across the entire void. Eventually, he focused his eyes at some of the things he could see in the distance. He couldn't quite make out what they were so he decided to take a closer look.</p>

  <p>They were not that far away from where he was. He managed to reach them in less than thirty seconds.</p>

  <p>The things he saw turned out to be the remains of a house.</p>

  <p>There were several beautifully sculpted white jade pillars and crushed stones serenely drifting in the void. However, the pillars were severely damaged and seemed as though they had been floating there for years.</p>

  <p>"This must be the house of a certain race in the Source World," Zheng mumbled as he analyzed the ruins.</p>

  <p>"Most probably, they shared the same fate as you. After they were deleted, they were thrown out of chaos and ended up here," added No. 9527 quite frankly.</p>

  <p>No matter how harsh that might seem, Zheng wasn't thoroughly discouraged by it.</p>

  <p>He traveled through the ruins for a while. Finally, he found two long swords and a crooked hook. They were actually in pretty good condition, and their grade was at least the same as that of the Profound Blood Treasure.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, these treasures were of no use to Zheng. He casually threw them into the space ring and continued to move around the ruins while carefully looking for some valuable clues.</p>

  <p>The remains of the house stretched for about ten miles. Sadly, Zheng hadn't discovered anything worthwhile. Eventually, he reached the end of the house.</p>

  <p>Standing on the edge of the ruins, Zheng scanned the horizon and spotted another wreckage not far away. He swiftly headed towards that direction to search for clues.</p>

  <p>There he saw all kinds of metals floating in the void. The metals were distorted into various shapes and figures. Upon closer inspection, one could see the runes carved on the metals. Obviously, these runes were much different from those found in the Source World.</p>

  <p>Zheng passed by a huge object that looked like a giant metal cup. After checking the inside of it, his expression froze. He couldn't believe his eyes.</p>

  <p>"So many corpses..." Zheng whispered to himself while examining them carefully.</p>

  <p>There were dozens of corpses curled up inside the cup. Strangely enough, those corpses emitted a brass glow. Even after several years after their death, they still looked like they had just died.</p>

  <p>Zheng pulled out a long sword and lightly tapped one of the corpses. A crisp sound rang as he did this.</p>

  <p>"Hmm. Just as I suspected, these corpses are made of metal," Zheng murmured.</p>

  <p>Ever since he entered the Other Shore and merged with the Civilization Artifact, Zheng had a deeper understanding that not every life had flesh and blood.</p>

  <p>For instance, the bodies of the members of the Regal Jade Civilization were made of jade. Their entire civilization was built from a flying jade.</p>

  <p>Essentially, they were different from the other creatures in the Source World.</p>

  <p>Therefore, it didn't seem strange to Zheng that the Metal Civilization existed in the chaos. It was perfectly plausible.</p>

  <p>"These are not the creatures of the current civilization," No. 9527 added.</p>

  <p>In the previous chaos, there were other Chaos Ancient Gods that existed.</p>

  <p>They controlled the bottom-layer space theurgy. Naturally, they would delete some unnecessary spaces and throw them out like Mount did.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded in agreement. In any case, he was not interested in these metal bodies. He stood at the edge of the metal cup and sighed, "Is there no other living being in this place?" He felt exasperated.</p>

  <p>At the very least, there seemed to be no danger within this void. For some creatures with an infinite lifespan, they should be able to survive for a long time.</p>

  <p>Zheng couldn't help but get a little disappointed. The deafening silence of this vast space was too depressing.</p>
