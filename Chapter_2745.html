<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Yes! I was right there! So I heard it clearly!" The strange fish spoke in a firm tone, "I don't know what method they have come up with. They actually are planning to leave this damned place!"</p>

  <p>Its eyes suddenly showed signs of yearning to leave this place.</p>

  <p>Having such a sense and intellect, any creature would not be willing to stay longer at this place.</p>

  <p>"But it's impossible for the creatures of the forbidden area to leave the place," Leland contradicted. He thought that for them to be able to run away, it was beyond belief.</p>

  <p>It was a known fact. Every living being throughout the divine land was aware of this common knowledge. Otherwise, every beast in the forbidden area would have already fled and scattered all over the world.</p>

  <p>"I don't have any idea either. Those big fiends are surely planning this," the strange fish answered.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, on the other hand, couldn't be bothered anymore by this and shook his head. He candidly asked, "I don't want to talk about it at the moment. We must leave now. Can you show me the way?"</p>

  <p>In response to Luo Zheng's question, the strange fish's body twisted on the ground.</p>

  <p>From under its torso, slender legs instantly extended. One by one, about thirty pair of legs stretched out as its entire body was completely supported to stand on the ground.</p>

  <p>"Come with me!"</p>

  <p>The fish's slender legs twitched and swung in the air.</p>

  <p>In a while, it began to move and run at an extremely fast speed on the ground!</p>

  <p>"Let's go." Luo Zheng gave a nod, and in a flash moved following behind the strange fish.</p>

  <p>The next moment, Leland and the other three top-rank True Gods also moved in an instant. Their figures turned into streaks of light as they tagged along.</p>

  <p>The speed of the fish, as its legs moved back and forth, was extremely fast, but compared to Luo Zheng and the others, it was still slower.</p>

  <p>They continued to advance forward for quite a distance alongside the long coastline. Luo Zheng became a little impatient noticing the fish's speed and couldn't help but offer, "I will carry you now as we fly. You can just show me the way."</p>

  <p>Although the physique of the strange fish was not small, supporting its weight wouldn't be a burden to him.</p>

  <p>"I'm not used to it. Moreover, the exit of this pasture isn't very far, and it only takes at most an hour to get there." The strange fish turned down the offer. Naturally, it wasn't willing to be carried on the way by Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Since it wasn't willing, Luo Zheng just shrugged his shoulders and continued to speed up.</p>

  <p>On the way, he was caught in his own thought and examined Tianming's memory again. What he saw made him frown slightly.</p>

  <p>He saw and witnessed how Nicholas and the others got rid of the little fiends. As a result, their speed to move forward had significantly increased!</p>

  <p>This time, he had actually crossed the fourth stage and entered the fifth stage of the Abyss Demon Region. Throughout their path, they never had met with any hurdles or obstructions.</p>

  <p>This wasn't surprising at all.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings were, after all, considered to be the strongest in the divine land.</p>

  <p>The Abyss Demon Region had always been warned against as it was extremely dangerous. But Holy Beings' strength was powerful enough to survive it.</p>

  <p>Since their group wasn't blocked by any fiends again, they would surely defeat all of the other beasts that dared be an interference.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was still contemplating such a situation and realized that this was not good news.</p>

  <p>Provided that there was only one way to return to the fifth stage from the sixth stage of the Abyss Demon Region, the chances of meeting these people would be high.</p>

  <p>He came out from his thoughts and realized that the strange fish had already been leading the way for about an hour.</p>

  <p>The strange fish abruptly halted upon reaching the other side of the sea of lava. Luo Zheng, Leland and the other three top-rank True Gods also slowed down.</p>

  <p>Looking around, they noticed that there were two huge flaming mountains in front of them.</p>

  <p>The scorching flame on the flaming mountains had been burning all year round. One could feel the extremely high temperature even if they were dozens of miles away.</p>

  <p>"We have arrived at the pass!" the strange fish announced, staring at the flaming mountains.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, Leland and the rest of the group slowly descended in order to avoid being exposed.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng raised his gaze, looked into the distance and asked, "Are there fiends guarding this place?"</p>

  <p>"Yes!" The strange fish fixated its gaze at the pass and murmured, "There are a great number of them!"</p>

  <p>A feeling of grievance once again built up within it. The experience wasn't something new and the strange fish was extremely unwilling to be swallowed up over and over again. It had already been prepared for countless escape plans before.</p>

  <p>But by ill luck, it had failed every time.</p>

  <p>The strange fish, as a result of not being successful in its attempt to escape, had turned into a scrumptious food to the fiends guarding the area.</p>

  <p>"This is only the fiends' pasture. Is it so important?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>A strange laughter came out from the strange fish's mouth as it heard Luo Zheng's words. It spoke in an aggrieved tone, "The fiends like eating so much. Food is very important to them..."</p>

  <p>The fiends paid great attention to the fields of culture, art, and most importantly food.</p>

  <p>They were not allowed to get involved in anything outside the divine land, so they would naturally do their best to make good use of everything that would benefit them in the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shook his head. He once had an encounter with a fiend, and it was the fiend named Edmond. The experience surely had opened his eyes to something new and it was different from every encounter he had with other races. He didn't know nor understand the characteristics of this fiend race.</p>

  <p>"But since there are powerful warriors invading, the fiends guarding the pass should decrease in number, so I say this is a chance," the strange fish added, as a blue light flashed in its eyes.</p>

  <p>"Come closer and take back your spiritual sense. Don't let it spread out,"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng urged everyone.</p>

  <p>In silence, they walked towards the two flaming mountains, at the same time holding their own breath.</p>

  <p>After covering a distance of ten miles, they finally found that on one side of the flaming mountains, perched a huge pointed building.</p>

  <p>Looking over at the building for a while, Leland asked, "We just rush over like this?"</p>

  <p>"Of course not!" The strange fish opposed immediately after hearing the question.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?" Leland felt puzzled at the sudden outburst.</p>

  <p>"As long as we don't kill these fiends, they can quickly gather more companions." The strange fish's face revealed a hint of caution. "If we attract a great fiend to come over here, I will surely be eaten. However, it's hard to say what will happen to you."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and Leland looked cautious by the strange fish's warning, starting to be on their guard.</p>

  <p>The strange fish turned its gaze towards the two. It knew that the two of them were the strongest among the five humans, and asked, "Are you sure you can kill the ordinary fiends?"</p>

  <p>Assessing the capability of the fiends, it could be said that their strength differed by levels.</p>

  <p>Holy Beings were known to be powerful but the top fiends held much strength and could overpower them. As the top ferocious beasts of the Abyss Demon Region, the fiends rarely died. Thus almost every fiend had accumulated a lot of Faith Energy. Even the strength of ordinary fiends was no different from that of the consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>"We have to try our best," Leland encouraged.</p>

  <p>He was a Demi-holy Being but he did not come from a powerful clan on the Floating Island. He was not even in a high position. In terms of real strength, he was no match for Troy and Rachelle.</p>

  <p>"In that case, I have to be the bait this time, and you attack them from behind. What do you think?" the strange fish suggested with an awkward smile.</p>

  <p>The truth was that this suggestion would just be considered an adventure without danger.</p>

  <p>But it was a different case for both Luo Zheng and Leland. Not knowing what the strange fish had in mind, they were feeling under pressure as this was their only chance. Every action needed to be carefully planned out.</p>

  <p>"Okay," Luo Zheng agreed after a while.</p>

  <p>Back then, the fiend called Edmond was extremely strong among the fiends.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng's current strength was strong enough to subdue him. Moreover, the fiends that were guarding the pass shouldn't be stronger than Edmond...</p>

  <p>After further vigilant discussion, the strange fish made its move.</p>

  <p>Both Luo Zheng and Leland positioned themselves along the low-lying path on the side, and carefully walked matching its pace.</p>

  <p>As for the other three top-rank True Gods, they could only stay in place and wait. They would only follow after Luo Zheng and Leland had succeeded.</p>

  <p>Back to the strange fish, it was already near its destination.</p>
