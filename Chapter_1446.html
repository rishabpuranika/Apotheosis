  <p>
</p>

  <p>The walls of the abyss were smooth and there was nothing to cling on to.</p>

  <p>Previously, martial artists had tried to shatter the walls of the abyss. They had first wanted to make a big hole in the wall, but it was not long before they realized that all attempts would be futile.</p>

  <p>A faint enchanted barrier was present on the walls of the abyss. The enchanted barrier was not so conspicuous, but with the level of strength of this group of warriors, it was impossible for them to shatter it.</p>

  <p>However, Freya did not want to cling to the wall. Instead, she moved to make her body as close to the wall as possible, maintaining a distance of about a foot from it. When several enormous blades appeared from below again, she slapped the wall with the palm of her hand. By taking advantage of the counterforce, she was able to control her position in the abyss and dodge the huge blades.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes twinkled when he saw Freya's movements.</p>

  <p>The warriors had fallen from above but were unable to fly. It was indeed difficult for them to evade the huge blades. If they did not dodge them in time, the blades would cut them off. Freya's method proved to be helpful.</p>

  <p>Those who were willing to stay in the abyss were those with strong willpower. Facing the cold glint of the enormous blades, everyone was a little scared, but they clenched their teeth with determination and persevered. Seeing how Freya avoided the blades, they all followed suit, adjusted their positions, and approached the walls of the abyss.</p>

  <p>In the abyss, the scene was such that the warriors clung firmly to the wall and each time a batch of blades appeared, they hit the wall. Some warriors stomped on the wall with their legs, while some martial artists only used their hands to hit it. In this way, they managed to survive the marathon of blades that came at them.</p>

  <p>However, as they descended farther down, the number of blades increased. At the start, only two or three giant blades appeared deep into the abyss. Later, there were seven, eight, or even ten blades entangled together, leaving everyone with less and less space to pass through.</p>

  <p>"Pfft!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng reached out to tap the wall of the abyss and his body drifted twenty to thirty feet horizontally. His goal was to move to the position above the chasm in the middle, between the blades, which was about five to six feet wide. Luo Luo Zheng could then easily pass through the gap and avoid getting pierced by the blades.</p>

  <p>But just as Luo Luo Zheng adjusted his position and was about to rush toward the gap, he heard a loud, deafening sound. It was from an ogre who had hit the wall of the abyss. The counter-force made him move straight for the gap in the middle, like a huge elephant!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng and the ogre martial artist were at the same height. If they continued to fight for the chance of survival by going through the gap, one of them would definitely be pushed out.</p>

  <p>However, the problem was that Luo Luo Zheng was the first one to make the move.</p>

  <p>He had not used much force when he hit the wall. If he had done so, he would have likely crashed into the other side of the abyss... He saved his strength in order to make his body fit into the gap.</p>

  <p>But the ogre martial artist thought differently and had acted later than Luo Luo Zheng. He had perhaps seen Luo Luo Zheng try to fly toward the gap, so he immediately smashed his fists against the wall, his entire body like a small mountain as he charged at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The many martial artists also adjusted their positions, trying to go through the gaps formed by the intricately placed blades below. After they did so, they would not have to move to automatically fall into the gaps. Their gazes shifted to Luo Luo Zheng when they heard the loud sound.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng! Be careful!" Freya, who was below, saw this scene and was shocked.</p>

  <p>"You! Get out of my way!" The ogre martial artist sneered. As he shifted his body, he hit Luo Luo Zheng with his shoulders.</p>

  <p>The ogre was at the Spirit Supreme Realm and was as tall and sturdy as a mountain. Moreover, he had an armor with a golden skeleton resting on his shoulder. If Luo Luo Zheng were to be hit by the shoulder armor, his entire body would be smashed into pieces, even without the densely-packed blades below.</p>

  <p>The other warriors looked at Luo Luo Zheng with pity on their faces. To be targeted by an ogre martial artist in this abyss? this Luo Luo Zheng was truly unfortunate!</p>

  <p>The ogre warrior was one of the top talents in a tenth grade sacred place.</p>

  <p>In addition, his cultivation was at the Spirit Supreme Realm which was one realm higher than Luo Zheng's. The rest of the warriors were sympathetic toward Luo Luo Zheng and could imagine what would happen to him in this encounter.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, outside the underground palace, the Saint Lord of the ogre race abruptly frowned and could not help but curse, "What an idiot of that Awais!"</p>

  <p>Although the Saint Lords couldn't enter the Endless Abyss, they could clearly see every single movement within. The Saint Lord of the ogres had tested Luo Zheng's strength and was deeply impressed by it. He had used the power in his fingers to attack Luo Luo Zheng two consecutive times but failed to make him yield. He understood Luo Zheng's potential well by now. In strength alone, even the average warriors of the Spirit Supreme Realm were far from being his match, let alone anyone at the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>In fact, the martial artists from the three tenth grade sacred places were present when the ogre Saint Lord battled Luo Luo Zheng. Awais had also witnessed the event. However, ogre warriors were always arrogant and reckless in nature. Perhaps Luo Luo Zheng had been too conspicuous in his performance, which was why the ogre warrior intentionally targeted him.</p>

  <p>The ogre Saint Lord regretted that he had not reminded his warriors to be careful of Luo Zheng's strength. He knew the personality of these ogres of the sacred place, but he never expected Awais to look for trouble by attacking Luo Luo Zheng. If he had predicted this earlier, he would have warned each and every warrior of his before they entered the underground palace. He worried that Awais would provoke and seal his own fate.</p>

  <p>At this time, Luo Luo Zheng was already above the gap. Facing Awais, his eyes narrowed. He found another gap and his eyebrows scrunched together as a giant force gathered within his body.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Awais tilted his body and aimed the skeleton on his shoulder at Luo Luo Zheng to hit him violently.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Even though it was just a physical collision, the explosive sound was as loud as thunder.</p>

  <p>The moment Awais crashed into Luo Luo Zheng, the ogre's eyes widened as he stared blankly at the golden skeleton which suddenly shattered with a loud sound. It was a second-rank divine weapon. He had even used the armor to put a twelfth grade beast to death. How could it be smashed to pieces by a human kid?</p>

  <p>However, right now, Awais's biggest issue was not the broken golden skeleton armor. Just now, when he and Luo Luo Zheng collided, the two of them were pushed away by the impact of the collision. At this time, everyone, including Luo Luo Zheng and Awais, were descending rapidly and were incredibly close to the giant blades.</p>

  <p>Because of this collision, the two of them were distanced from the gap between the blades. Awais wanted to shift, but it was too late to find another gap. Looking at the blades that exuded rays of cold light from below him, a look of despair covered his face. Before he could sense his impending doom, he instantly activated the purple light dot, hoping that he could use the divine texture to return to the entrance of the underground palace before he was cut to pieces by the blades.</p>

  <p>As for Luo Luo Zheng, he had calculated the amount of impact force he would take on before colliding with Awais. He and Awais were like two clashing marbles, and the instant Luo Luo Zheng was pushed back, his body flew in another direction. In that space was another ogre martial artist.</p>

  <p>This particular ogre martial artist had already adjusted his position and thought that all he needed to do now was to wait to fall into the gap below without any worries. He would then pass through the layer of blades. Seeing Luo Luo Zheng fly over, the ogre martial artist was stunned and shouted, "You, you dare to touch me?"</p>

  <p>Bang?</p>

  <p>However, the problem was not that Luo Luo Zheng dared to do so. Even Luo Luo Zheng himself was unable to control his movements. He directly collided into the ogre martial artist and sent him flying back, but Luo Zheng's own body firmly stopped above the gap.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the enormous blades formed a fatal net, closing in on the crowd.</p>

  <p>Except for Awais and the other ogre martial artist who had just been sent flying by Luo Luo Zheng, the warriors dropped into the openings of the net, namely the cracks between the blades, and safely passed through.</p>

  <p>Awais's body fell straight onto the blades. At the instant before his body was about to be cut by the blades, the purple light wrapped around him and flew upward...</p>
