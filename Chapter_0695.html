<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Zheng is going to be skinned alive. If Stoney uses his Skull Ghost Hand on the top of his skull, Zheng won't even have the time to dodge," Xiao said while shaking his head.</p>

  <p>A trace of confusion flashed through Michael's eyes. He couldn't even think of a reason why Zheng was this confident of himself. He was letting Stoney use his spirit attack on him. What was more, he didn't even try to dodge for God's sake!</p>

  <p>The situation had been pretty good for Zheng so far. If he used his sword spirit to protect the small pagoda and stole points from other martial artists by himself, the level of his small pagoda would be much higher than others, and the final result would also be beneficial to him.</p>

  <p>"He's just too confident of himself... If he is killed in the magic array, he will be kicked out of the magic array." Michael couldn't help but sigh at Zheng's carelessness.</p>

  <p>The middle-aged cultivator didn't say anything. He was convinced that Zheng had cheated in the game. And if he were kicked out of the magic array, at least the balance of the magic array wouldn't be affected.</p>

  <p>The elders of the World Commercial Alliance watched the fight silently with serious expressions. Finally, someone cried out painfully, as if he had been badly hurt.</p>

  <p>And to everyone's surprise, the painful cry was not from Zheng, but from Stoney!</p>

  <p>The black lines on Stoney's face were slowly fading away. The redness on his skin had gone, and his face was even paler than the snow. The angry expression on his handsome face made him look scary.</p>

  <p>Contrary to him, Zheng was not affected at all. He turned around and left as if nothing had happened. Then he continued using his 'flick the sword' to kill the stone men made of basalt.</p>

  <p>"W-What... the hell did this guy do?" Michael's mouth was agape because he was astonished. He stared at Zheng with disbelief, watching him kill the stone men. Every time he flicked his sword, a stone man would shatter in front of him. Seeing the lithe and ethereal figure, Michael couldn't help but be deeply impressed by the young man at the Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>The looks on Xiao's and the middle-aged cultivator's face were similar to Michael's. But to be honest, anyone who saw what had happened would feel the same astonishment.</p>

  <p>They couldn't even begin to imagine how Zheng beat Stoney in the blink of an eye, making him this miserable.</p>

  <p>"Ahhhhhh!"</p>

  <p>Stoney's cry of pain lasted for a very long time.</p>

  <p>The Skull Ghost Hand was made from Stoney's soul. And it was a form of spiritual attack that belonged to the Hatred Evil Attack, just like Zheng's ability to turn his soul into a thorn.</p>

  <p>If Stoney had used his Skull Ghost Hand on any other cultivator, he would have won. Others couldn't deal with his Skull Ghost Hand.</p>

  <p>Unluckily, he was battling with Zheng, whose soul was in the Fighting Soul Realm!</p>

  <p>It was hard to imagine how powerful Zheng's soul had become since he entered the Fighting Soul Realm!</p>

  <p>Stoney's Skull Ghost Hand couldn't even fight against Christopher from the Dragon Lineage Human!</p>

  <p>Ever before Zheng's soul was in the Fighting Soul Realm, Christopher's spirit attacks did nothing to Zheng. Now that Zheng had successfully entered the Fighting Soul Realm, his soul had become stronger. Now, even Christopher couldn't hurt Zheng's soul despite using all kinds of spirit attacks on him!</p>

  <p>As for Stoney's Skull Ghost Hand... The attack felt more like an itchy spot for Zheng than a powerful spirit attack.</p>

  <p>As soon as the Skull Ghost Hand entered his head, Zheng cut it off.</p>

  <p>And for Stoney, the cutting of his Skull Ghost Hand felt like a deep injury to his soul! Anyone could imagine how painful it would be! Even Zheng, who had his soul burned a long time ago, would wince when he thought of the painful memory.</p>

  <p>Right now, Zheng didn't even blink an eye when he heard Stoney's painful cry.</p>

  <p>He just concentrated on killing the stone men.</p>

  <p>Zheng had infringed on Stoney's territory just to take his points, not to fight with him. Zheng was merciful toward Stoney by not doing more damage. If he had attacked back, Zheng would have completely erased Stoney's soul in one go. Although Stoney wouldn't die in the magic array, he would be kicked out.</p>

  <p>"Bang! Bang! Bang!"</p>

  <p>The stone men kept crumbling in front of Zheng, and his points rose at a crazy speed.</p>

  <p>Lily was killing the stone men in Zheng's territory, while Zheng was killing the stone men in Stoney's territory. So his points went up at twice the speed of other cultivators.</p>

  <p>After the pain of his soul tearing slowly went dissipated, Stoney saw what Zheng was doing in his territory, and he almost fainted. Zheng had finished killing all the stone men in his territory.</p>

  <p>"How... How did this guy..." Stoney couldn't even finish his sentence. He finally realized that he had met a very powerful and strong opponent today.</p>

  <p>When he first mastered the Hatred Evil Attack, Stoney used it to get revenge from the grade two sect that had tried to kill him. When he succeeded, Stoney felt ecstatic. He felt like the whole world was under his feet, and he could easily achieve anything. And most importantly, no one was at the same level as him! The spirit attack he practiced was so powerful and intimidating that even cultivators, who were stronger than him, couldn't fight against it.</p>

  <p>The bloke in front of his eyes didn't seem special to Stoney. But to everyone's surprise, he had easily injured Stoney's soul without getting hurt at all!</p>

  <p>How the hell did he manage that?</p>

  <p>The question lingered not only in Stoney's mind but also in everyone else's mind. Michael, Xiao, and the middle-aged cultivator all wanted to ask Zheng this question.</p>

  <p>After Zheng destroyed all the stone men, he turned to Stoney and said, "I will be here when the next round begins!"</p>

  <p>Hearing his words, Stoney felt like he was going to faint.</p>

  <p>He couldn't fight against this bloke, and now, he couldn't avoid him! Stoney had a feeling that he might not pass the pre-qualifying match today.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't care if Stoney passed the match or not at all. Now, he finally found a target, and Zheng was unwilling to let him go. He wouldn't kick Stoney out of the magic array so soon because if he were eliminated, Zheng would have to find another opponent to rob points from. And he didn't want any unnecessary fights.</p>

  <p>That was why Zheng decided to come to Stoney's territory again.</p>

  <p>When he returned to his territory, Lily was leaning against the big sword in the middle of the grassland. Her beautiful eyes that were filled with malicious red aura were staring at the sky.</p>

  <p>Seeing Lily like this, a suspicious expression appeared on Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>Lily was Zheng's sword spirit. And theoretically speaking, she was not alive, and couldn't think. But she was also special. She remembered the sword dance her former owner practiced. This indicated that Lily had memories.</p>

  <p>Other than the memory of the sword dance, Lily acted normally, and she was entirely under Zheng's control.</p>

  <p>This was a mystery that Zheng hadn't been able to solve. After all, even the cyan dragon couldn't understand it, so it was normal that Zheng couldn't figure it out either.</p>

  <p>He summoned Lily to his side before walking to his small pagoda. He had gained double the points in this round, and it was a big surprise.</p>

  <p>Zheng concentrated on the points. If he turned now, he would notice that Lily's eyes had flickered.</p>

  <p>Her gaze was not as emotionless and confused as it was before. Zheng's walking figure reflected in her irises. A smile slowly appeared on her usually emotionless face.</p>

  <p>But it only lasted for a short second. Once Zheng felt that someone was watching him from behind, he swiftly turned to look. But all he saw was Lily's pretty and enchanting face. Other than that, there wasn't anything different about her. Her pale face was emotionless as usual as if it were made of wood.</p>

  <p>"Am I overthinking? It felt like someone was watching me just now..." Zheng grumbled to himself. Then he lightly patted his forehead and pushed the question to the back of his mind. He shook his head and walked to his small pagoda.</p>

  <p>"More than thirty-six thousand points!" Seeing the points on his small pagoda, the corners of Zheng's lips lifted into a happy smile.</p>

  <p>"Upgrade!"</p>

  <p>Zheng used his points to upgrade his pagoda. But he only needed thirty-three thousand points.</p>

  <p>As soon as Zheng gave the command, his pagoda was surrounded by a red, beaming light. And when the first light dimmed, another red light appeared!</p>

  <p>His small pagoda had upgraded two levels in a row!</p>

  <p>Now, Zheng's pagoda level was one level higher than pagodas belonging to other cultivators!</p>

  <p>The pagoda that had upgraded two levels was wider than it was before.</p>

  <p>There was also a silver-white fence around it, and four flags on the four corners of the pagoda. The four flags were the symbol of the World Commercial Alliance.</p>

  <p>Six archers also appeared on the small pagoda.</p>

  <p>The bows in their hands, and the arrows on their backs had also changed drastically.</p>

  <p>The bows radiated the aura of fire, and on the arrows, there was a rune of fire too. This made Zheng feel powerful. He knew for sure that the archers were as good as the fighters in the Illuminating Soul Realm. He wondered how strong the small pagoda would become if he kept upgrading it.</p>

  <p>The number of the eliminated cultivators had risen during the fifth attack of the beasts.</p>

  <p>During the third attack of the beasts, only a few cultivators had been eliminated. And in the next attack, more than twenty cultivators had been kicked out. Then in the fifth attack, forty more cultivators had been removed! The number was rising quickly.</p>

  <p>Nobody could predict how many more cultivators were going to be eliminated during the sixth attack of the beasts.</p>
