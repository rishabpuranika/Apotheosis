  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng's Truth Boat sailed in a straight line in the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>The closer he got to the first line, the stronger the wind became, and the colder the sea water was.</p>

  <p>Moments later, he saw a small solitary boat bobbling up and down in the sea.</p>

  <p>"You didn't leave," Zheng said, smiling as he approached Dora's boat.</p>

  <p>"Leave? Just for a few dozen soul pills?" Dora said, frowning.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha!"</p>

  <p>Zheng felt the dissatisfaction radiating off her.</p>

  <p>He couldn't place an accurate estimate on the value of the soul pills, but they were of great importance to him now.</p>

  <p>Dora was not angry with Zheng. She had already guessed Zheng's identity, albeit vaguely.</p>

  <p>He was not from the Source World.</p>

  <p>He knew only a little about the Sea of Truth and the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>He hadn't even realized his own potential.</p>

  <p>Even Dora didn't know what Zheng could do.</p>

  <p>But when the news had spread from the Oneness Sky Palace, she had seen the expression on her grandma's face.</p>

  <p>She had never seen her grandma so surprised before.</p>

  <p>And now that she had met Zheng, she wouldn't miss this chance.</p>

  <p>"Well, here you go!"</p>

  <p>Saying this, she threw all the soul pills to Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng took the pills, counted them, and said, "Sixty soul pills. As I said, I'll take half of these. Thirty are for you."</p>

  <p>Zheng knew that there was a fatal flaw in his plan. If they withdrew from the Sea of Truth, he wouldn't be able to do anything to them.</p>

  <p>And if Dora hadn't stopped them from using the Illusion Breaking Rune, he wouldn't have obtained these soul pills.</p>

  <p>Dora didn't refuse Zheng.</p>

  <p>Though she didn't care much for the soul pills, she was afraid he would bear a grudge if she rejected them.</p>

  <p>Once the soul pills were divided, they continued to drive their Truth Boats forward on the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>"You haven't told me your name yet," Dora asked.</p>

  <p>Zheng threw her a look but decided to be honest with her. "My name is  Zheng Luo," he said.</p>

  <p>The Source World was an unknown field to him and he thought that no one had ever heard of him there.</p>

  <p>"Zheng Luo... Your surname is very rarely heard of," Dora muttered.</p>

  <p>Zheng was not surprised by Dora's reaction.</p>

  <p>After the Nine Li race had disappeared from the divine land, the indigenous people's culture had become different from that of the Source World.</p>

  <p>Their names and surnames were examples.</p>

  <p>At this, an idea occurred to Zheng. He thought for a while before asking, "Can I ask you something?"</p>

  <p>"Go ahead," Dora said, nodding.</p>

  <p>"Did anything important happen in the Source World during these past few years?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>After the divine land had left the Source World, it had become an isolated island, completely closed to the news of the Source World.</p>

  <p>Zheng had tried to read Nicholas' memories. Nicholas had been in the Sea of Truth for so long and had built up a group of contacts, so he must have known something about the Source World. It was quite possible that he had paved a way for himself in the Source World.</p>

  <p>But the Memory Flames only recorded memories within the divine land.</p>

  <p>There were no records about what happened outside the divine land, making it impossible to investigate through them.</p>

  <p>"Anything important?" Dora asked, surprised. "What do you mean by 'anything important'?"</p>

  <p>The Source World was vast and full of all sorts of news. Dora didn't pay special attention to any particular tidbits.</p>

  <p>Zheng blinked. "I want to know how the Yellow Emperor race is doing."</p>

  <p>He had wanted to be direct and ask about the Nine Li race, but he figured an indirect inquiry would be better, just to be safe.</p>

  <p>"The Yellow Emperor race? What's that?" Dora had never heard of this race before.</p>

  <p>The names of the Yellow Emperor race and the Nine Li race were used in the bone towers at the bottom of the chaos. There was another set of names in the Source World.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I mean the Yellow Thearch. We call him the Yellow Emperor," Zheng said sheepishly.</p>

  <p>"Aha, you want to know about the Bear race!" Only then did Dora understand what Zheng was talking about. But she was confused. "The Yellow Thearch has enjoyed a great reputation in the past few years. What's wrong?</p>

  <p>Why do you inquire about his race?" she asked.</p>

  <p>A man like the Yellow Thearch was a legendary figure for many people in the Source World. Asking for information related to him was practically useless because of how much the people adored him.</p>

  <p>"I'm just asking," Zheng said, smiling what he hoped was a disarming smile.</p>

  <p>"Why does the Yellow Thearch have a great reputation?"</p>

  <p>"You don't know? The Yellow Thearch, together with Divine Farmer, defeated the Nine Li race in Gilt Town, and killed his old enemy, Chiyou, in the Pearl Islet. After his race annexed the three islets of the Nine Li race, they prospered like never before," Dora said.</p>

  <p>These were now legends and were spread throughout the Source World.</p>

  <p>Everyone knew these legends now.</p>

  <p>"What? The Yellow Thearch killed Chiyou?" Zheng asked again, stunned.</p>

  <p>"I don't know whether he's dead or not. The people at his level are scheming. But the Nine Li race has been removed from the Source World."</p>

  <p>Dora shrugged. "The Nine Li race used to be a famous, powerful force. The eighty-one mages and so many of the Nine Li Guards were invincible. Even my grandma often sighs at their miserable ending."</p>

  <p>Zheng sighed inwardly.</p>

  <p>He had wanted to help his mother find some information in the Sea of Truth, but he hadn't expected to find such bad news.</p>

  <p>He had never met Chiyou before, but Chiyou was his grandfather, his mother's father.</p>

  <p>"You seem unhappy," Dora said, staring at Zheng and trying to figure him out.</p>

  <p>After all, the Soul of Light was a soul and emotions were easily released through the breath of the soul.</p>

  <p>Zheng was taken aback at Dora's words and reined in his emotions almost immediately.</p>

  <p>He didn't know which force Dora came from, nor did he know if she was an enemy or a friend. All he knew was that he shouldn't reveal his identity before he figured her out.</p>

  <p>"I'm fine. We have reached the first line. Let's cross it!"</p>

  <p>A line cut through the sea before them. The color of the Sea of Truth on the other side of this line turned from light blue to dark blue. Warriors crossing this line had to accept the fact that their Souls of Light would have to bear greater pressure.</p>

  <p>Dora blinked. She was observant and was adept at judging people's moods.</p>

  <p>She had clearly felt Zheng's mood fluctuating, especially at the moment she had told him that Chiyou had been killed.</p>

  <p>It was then that she realized that Zheng hadn't intended to inquire about the Yellow Thearch. He had wanted to know about the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>'Is he from the Nine Li race?' Dora thought to herself.</p>
