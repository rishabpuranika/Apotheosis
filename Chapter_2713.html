  <p>
</p>

  <p>There were only eight people left. Each of them carried a soft stone piece with great care as they moved forward on the road.</p>

  <p>The four-legged Earth Ghosts lived there all year round, so they were very familiar with the surrounding terrain.</p>

  <p>But with the joint efforts of Luo Zheng, Jalen, and Leland, they never got the chance to approach.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the Earth Ghosts were also afraid to die. At that point, streams of Lethal Fire Magma were shooting out everywhere in the cave. If they weren't careful enough, they could be burned to death.</p>

  <p>Over a hundred of them had already been burnt before the attacks stopped.</p>

  <p>They just kept creeping through the layer of soft stones, creating more and more holes to draw out more Lethal Fire Magma.</p>

  <p>After an hour of moving forward against the magma, the group finally found an open space.</p>

  <p>"Look! We're safe after we walk past the space ahead!" Jalen joyfully said.</p>

  <p>It was a huge cave ahead. The four-legged Earth Ghosts had drilled holes on the wall while relying on the pressure generated by the Lethal Fire Magma.</p>

  <p>There wasn't enough pressure in the open space, and the Lethal Fire Magma would also no longer be a threat to them.</p>

  <p>As they approached the open space, the creatures stopped digging holes as expected.</p>

  <p>They even stopped coming after the group and just hid under the layer of soft stones.</p>

  <p>Leland then turned to Luo Zheng and saluted. "Thank you for saving us."</p>

  <p>If it weren't for Luo Zheng, they all could've died.</p>

  <p>Even Leland wasn't so sure how he could avoid the Lethal Fire Magma without help.</p>

  <p>He gave up on the idea of killing Luo Zheng. Whether Luo Zheng came all by himself or followed them, he did a great job in saving their lives.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded his head and said, "In situations like that, we need to look out for one another. I took action not just to save you, but myself as well."</p>

  <p>Leland couldn't help the smile on his face as he nodded.</p>

  <p>Given his cultivation base, Luo Zheng was a man of a broad viewpoint.</p>

  <p>During countless years of exploration, many people had died of selfishness and distrust. Even if Luo Zheng didn't know them at all, he saved them, which was enough to prove his insight and vision.</p>

  <p>When they went to the open area and looked ahead, they got a little uneasy once again.</p>

  <p>"Plop! Plop! Plop!"</p>

  <p>Beneath the large cave were many huge, deep pools.</p>

  <p>Instead of water, there was Lethal Fire Magma inside each pool.</p>

  <p>The auras released by the pools were blazing, causing people to feel hot on the face.</p>

  <p>Everyone thought twice if they should move on or not.</p>

  <p>Without much hesitation, Luo Zheng, who was still carrying a soft stone, lightly tapped his toe and flew up.</p>

  <p>Others followed suit.</p>

  <p>The soft stone was as tall as a person, and it was not very convenient to fly with it, but no one chose to throw it away.</p>

  <p>After all, the soft stone could save their lives with its ability to resist the Lethal Fire Magma.</p>

  <p>"Plop! Plop! Plop!"</p>

  <p>Hot bubbles continuously came out of the pools, as if a giant beast was going to emerge from underneath.</p>

  <p>Despite knowing that there was no living being in the Lethal Fire Magma, they still couldn't help but be shaken up as each bubble popped out.</p>

  <p>As he flew, Luo Zheng peered through the pools and observed the Lethal Fire Magma silently.</p>

  <p>Just like its name, the Lethal Fire Magma was a kind of magma that contained deathly flames.</p>

  <p>In a flash, Luo Zheng quietly activated the Infinity Ruler in his mind.</p>

  <p>The golden circles in his eyes flickered slightly, but the Infinity Ruler did not respond at all.</p>

  <p>There was no trace of internal momentum in the flames, which meant that they were probably not formed by the Elementary Fire Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>'How strange?'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng thought to himself.</p>

  <p>His flesh body could resist all kinds of flames except for the Lethal Fire Magma.</p>

  <p>After they walked about ten miles in the spacious cave, thunders struck from ahead.</p>

  <p>"Splash!"</p>

  <p>A stream of Lethal Fire Magma suddenly belched from the pools. It washed against the top of the cave and splashed everywhere.</p>

  <p>Although the layer of soft stones at the top of the cave could resist the Lethal Fire Magma, the latter had scoured out several pits day by day.</p>

  <p>Witnessing that scene, everyone stopped in their tracks again.</p>

  <p>"Is this a fountain?"</p>

  <p>"How can we get past this?"</p>

  <p>They all realized that there was an even more terrifying place in the divine land in addition to the forbidden lands.</p>

  <p>"Splash!"</p>

  <p>The Lethal Fire Magma in the pools kept boiling, spurting out and bumping into each other in the air.</p>

  <p>After watching it in silence for a while, Luo Zheng finally said, "The Lethal Fire Magma erupts intermittently. If we know when exactly to move, it wouldn't be that hard to pass it."</p>

  <p>Leland nodded in agreement and said, "We need to figure out the right timing."</p>

  <p>It was easier said than done. One wrong step and they were doomed.</p>

  <p>They were under a great deal of pressure.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng slowly spread out his spiritual sense and closed his eyes.</p>

  <p>There were over a thousand deep pools before them. Some erupted in unison, while others erupted once after a long while.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng mentally took note of the rhythm of each eruption.</p>

  <p>After about an hour, Luo Zheng slowly opened his eyes and said, "Let's go together. Trust me!"</p>

  <p>Cameron was the first to follow Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>At that time, he trusted Luo Zheng more than Jalen and Leland.</p>

  <p>It was Luo Zheng, a stranger, who didn't leave him alone at such a crucial time.</p>

  <p>The others didn't say anything. They just marched forward through gritted teeth.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng flew out while everyone else followed closely behind him.</p>

  <p>After flying for about a thousand feet, Luo Zheng said, "Stop!"</p>

  <p>"Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!"</p>

  <p>They all stayed still in the air.</p>

  <p>"Splash!"</p>

  <p>About seven pools around them erupted in unison, and only the one under their feet remained calm.</p>

  <p>When the eruption was over, bubbles began to emerge from the deep pool below them.</p>

  <p>"Plop! Plop! Plop!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes flashed as he yelled, "Now!"</p>

  <p>At that moment, no one questioned Luo Zheng as they all flew with him without hesitation.</p>

  <p>Just as they had glided past it, the pool erupted.</p>

  <p>They were all in shock, but were also secretly admiring the way Luo Zheng had led them to safety with his correct calculations.</p>

  <p>They kept moving forward while alternately stopping, and they encountered no trouble.</p>

  <p>About two hours later, they all had finally flown past the deep pools. A small black altar appeared on the side of the cave wall not far away.</p>

  <p>A stone was pristinely placed on the altar.</p>

  <p>It was a grey mouse that was intricately and beautifully crafted.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's heart skipped a few beats as he saw it.</p>

  <p>He knew very well that the mouse was not carved, but had grown naturally. It was the reincarnation of the Stone Mouse.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Luo Zheng started to smell something fishy and sweet once again.</p>
