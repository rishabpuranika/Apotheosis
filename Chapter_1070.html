<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The competition was highly intense and not many remained. Numerous warriors were kicked out.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was extremely cautious and agile. Whenever someone wanted to target him, his body would suddenly flash without the slightest bit of warning and he would distance himself from them, going far beyond their reach but still staying inside the circle.</p>

  <p>In the red circle, no one had a clear goal and they had not decided just one person that they wanted to take on. Instead, they were trying their best to kick out as many people as they could until there were only three people left. In such a scenario, obviously very few people would stubbornly chase after Luo Zheng all the time.</p>

  <p>Be that as it might, Lord Randy's gaze, which was as vicious as that of a venomous snake, was still locked on to Luo Zheng all the time, which made him feel extremely unhappy.</p>

  <p>Similarly, just like Lord Randy, the three powerful masters who had reached the Soul Sea Realm had also focused their gazes on Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"He is well versed in the Space Law and even seems to have fully grasped its second layer. This boy has good potential!"</p>

  <p>"Judging by the strength he is currently showing, he can be considered a divine-level talent. He has the ability to reach the third tier in the Harlen Divine Kingdom. You know, I won't be surprised if he manages to make it to the top of the third tier as well!"</p>

  <p>"Someone like him deserves a Harlen Token, but I'm a bit worried�"</p>

  <p>With their sharp insight, how could the three powerful masters at the Soul Sea Realm not see that Lord Randy was targeting Luo Zheng?</p>

  <p>"Lord Randy has already declared that he alone will obtain the Harlen Token in this round. I'm afraid that with his strong cultivation and powers, it won't be hard for him to keep his word. What worries me is the possibility that he will make a move against Tianxing."</p>

  <p>"Alas. I have rarely seen such talent among independent warriors. I hope he can pass the test."</p>

  <p>"Well it's going to be a bit difficult. Only four people in the Harlen Divine Kingdom are in the first tier, and the difference in the strength of warriors between the first tier and the second tier is extreme. Only if this Tianxing reaches the top of the second tier will he be able to contend with Lord Randy!"</p>

  <p>Of course, Luo Zheng didn't know that these three powerful warriors of the Soul Sea Realm were worried about him.</p>

  <p>Lord Randy was indeed highly interested in Luo Zheng. When he had taken part in this test, he had planned to pay special attention to the young guys who took part in the test too.</p>

  <p>He had originally planned to search for talented people inside the Jade Martial House. However, the person who was ranked first in the Jade Martial House, was the crown prince's right hand man, who went by the name Gregory. He was perfectly loyal to his master and it would be impossible to win him over, but this young man in front of Lord Randy was different�</p>

  <p>Randy had a special talent when it came to reading people, which was a trait he had inherited from his father. From the very first moment he had seen Luo Zheng, he'd felt that this young man's strength wasn't as simple as it appeared to be.</p>

  <p>Those powerful masters at the Soul Sea Realm could only assess Luo Zheng by his current performance. According to them, Zheng's strength was only at the top of the third tier, but in the eyes of Randy, this guy who was constantly running away from everyone who tried to target him was deliberately hiding his actual strength!</p>

  <p>He estimated that Luo Zheng might not be able to reach the first tier, but it wouldn't be a problem for him to reach the top of the second tier.</p>

  <p>More importantly, he had never heard of this person before, which meant that as far as Randy was concerned, the guy was nameless. Therefore, he assumed that the latter wouldn't be favored by the crown prince. How could Randy let such a good chance slip by?</p>

  <p>The only thing Lord Randy needed to do now was to test Zheng's true strength!</p>

  <p>The first attempt to test his strength had already ended. It was true that Zheng's display of the Space Law had amazed Randy, but he wasn't satisfied at all. This boy's strength was definitely much greater than that and mastery of the Space Law was certainly not his trump card.</p>

  <p>The problem was that Tianxing was way too cunning. He avoided all the warriors and kept himself from fighting anyone. This way, it was impossible for anyone, let alone Lord Randy to measure his true strength. They didn't even know if he could truly fight!</p>

  <p>As the number of martial artists in the red circle dwindled, a faint smile appeared on Randy's face. His chance was finally going to be here. More fortunately, it looked like he would have to test Zheng's true strength all by himself!</p>

  <p>Very soon, only five martial artists were left inside the red circle. Other than Randy and Luo Zheng, there were three other Virtual Tribulation Realm martial artists contending for a place now. Now, since the space that each of them could move in had grown larger due to a lower density of warriors, it was difficult for them to drive each other out.</p>

  <p>Of these five people, only three were going to stay in the end. No one was willing to be thrown out at this moment since they all had fought hard to reach this stage. Therefore, everyone was extremely careful and cautious, and the situation was in a deadlock.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the red circle began to shrink�</p>

  <p>From what they had seen in the previous rounds, everyone understood this clearly that the red circle would shrink very quickly. The moment that it began to shrink, the result of the round was going to come out within minutes.</p>

  <p>So as soon as the shrinking began, everyone's expressions changed from concentration to alarm. They began to go all out in their attacks against the other martial artists.</p>

  <p>"Energy Destruction Fist!"</p>

  <p>"Heart-Shattering Palm!" two of them roared as they engaged each other.</p>

  <p>Other than carefully avoiding Lord Randy, the three other martial artists were using their trump cards to stay inside now.</p>

  <p>Two of the warriors were fighting each other, which meant that the third one, who would obviously not go to challenge Lord Randy, had to target Luo Zheng now.</p>

  <p>When Lord Randy saw that someone was chasing after Luo Zheng, a smile appeared on his face again. 'How are you going to run this time?' he thought.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was well aware that he had no choice but to strike back.</p>

  <p>Seeing that the martial artist was rushing towards him, Luo Zheng gently took a step forward and adjusted his breathing to the best rhythm. His strength began to flow through his body.</p>

  <p>At this moment in time, an extremely peaceful Mu Ning was being emitted from his body and he was in perfect harmony with everything around him.</p>

  <p>The Virtual Tribulation Realm martial artist who was attacking Luo Zheng had been able to stay inside the circle till now, which showed that his strength was not to be trifled with. In terms of power, he was at the top of the entire Jade Martial House, and he could easily secure a place in the third tier of the Harlen Divine Kingdom.</p>

  <p>The martial artist took a step forward. His figure flashed like a tiger, and his hands transformed into two gigantic claws as he struck out towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Aooo!"</p>

  <p>A fierce beast which resembled a tiger condensed on his body. As he placed one claw up and the other claw below it, the mouth of the beast had opened and was about to swallow Luo Zheng in one gulp.</p>

  <p>The Virtual Tribulation Realm warriors of the divine kingdoms weren't to be underestimated!</p>

  <p>This person's strength alone was comparable to a top-level war lord of the Demon Night. He was probably only very slightly weaker than Esther. However, if he really wanted to fight for the seat in the Tower of Sin, then he would definitely be able to rank himself among the top ten seat holders!</p>

  <p>Everyone was guessing about Zheng's strength right now, but Luo Zheng was taking a shot at the strength of the person in front of him.</p>

  <p>"Since you've picked me to fight with, then you should be out!" Zheng's footsteps became light as his figure slowly retreated!</p>

  <p>While the red circle was shrinking, Luo Zheng was retreating with his back facing the line that defined it. As he shot backward, Luo Zheng instantly arrived at the very edge. If he paused there for a few seconds, he would automatically be out!</p>

  <p>However, Zheng's feet only lightly touched the edge of the red circle, his tap as gentle as if a feather had stroked the rim. However, just as his toes touched the ground, he suddenly began to look intimidating and aggressive.</p>

  <p>"Forceful energy! Explode!"</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>In that instant, Zheng's Mu Ning changed dramatically as his entire body turned into a thin line and charged towards his opponent like a bolt of lightning!</p>

  <p>Before the enormous phantom of the vicious beast could bite down on him, and before the opponent's claws could meet together in an attempt to crush Luo Zheng, he had already arrived in front of his opponent.</p>

  <p>The fierce-looking warrior in front of him was determined to win this battle. As long as he could get rid of Luo Zheng, and the battle between the other two ended, there would only be three people left in the red circle, so he would definitely pass the test. No matter what happened, he had to pass the test. It was a crucial step which might influence his whole life.</p>

  <p>Therefore, he went all out to fight against Luo Zheng. He wanted to finish Luo Zheng in a single blow!</p>

  <p>In his eyes, Luo Zheng was nothing but a coward who only knew how to run away.</p>

  <p>Yet, at the very last moment, he clearly saw that Luo Zheng was retreating, but somehow, the fellow had appeared before him just as his eyes had blinked due to some sort of lightning flash. What was going on?</p>

  <p>This was impossible.</p>

  <p>The warrior was dumbfounded. He stared at Luo Zheng blankly, not knowing how to react.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng ignored his dumb expression. He reached out his hands and grabbed his opponent's hands. With a light snap of his five fingers, Luo Zheng locked the pulses in the warrior's arms. This way, the warrior's life vitality was going to be unable to reach his hands, making it even harder for him to break free from Zheng's grip.</p>

  <p>In fact, it was an unnecessary move for Luo Zheng to lock his pulses. His opponent had already forgotten how to revolve his life vitality and break free. While the warrior was still in a trance, Luo Zheng let go of his pulse and grabbed him with one hand. He then swung him around like a windmill, and threw him out of the red circle.</p>

  <p>It was such a smooth and clean stunt!</p>

  <p>The truth was that for martial artists at lower realms, this way of battling was very common. But once they reached the Internal Elixir Realm, the strength with which one's life vitality burst out would be extremely terrifying and no one would dare to go near them.</p>

  <p>As a result, in the battles in the red circle, warriors were often driven out by other warriors' forceful attack and strength, but nobody had been thrown out like that till now.</p>

  <p>At this time, when they saw Luo Zheng directly throw a martial artist out of the red circle, the other martial artists were also so shocked that they couldn't utter anything. The same doubt crossed their minds, "How did he do it�"</p>
