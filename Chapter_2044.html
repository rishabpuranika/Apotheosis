  <p>
</p>

  <p>Iron Moon City was aglow with bright purple from the orb of light that had spread quickly across the land, covering the whole city up to the hills.</p>

  <p>Maha's skill was apparent, especially when the opponent was Nathan. He would often try to intimidate him using the Grand World Technique; but even without it, Maha would have still been able to defeat Nathan.</p>

  <p>However, compared to Nathan, facing Luo Luo Zheng gave Maha a terrible headache.</p>

  <p>Whether in terms of strength or weaponry, Luo Luo Zheng could easily defeat him!</p>

  <p>Maha's speed had proved to be superior to many, but when he was faced with Luo Luo Zheng, escaping was its only function!</p>

  <p>The Grand World Technique was one of Maha's greatest assets. Once he activated it, he could dominate and make all the rules to his advantage.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, after being defeated by Luo Luo Zheng and fleeing in every direction, Maha had already lost face.</p>

  <p>Although Maha had already mentally prepared himself to fight Luo Luo Zheng and wholly removed all arrogance in his heart to be in his best condition, this did not mean that Maha lacked pride!</p>

  <p>As the top Godly Genius of Murphy Universe, being chased all the way down here and running around underground with his face covered in dirt was not Maha's style!</p>

  <p>Besides, Luo Luo Zheng continually swung his terrifying sword, and some human world lord had been continuously using the Roaring Token to exaggerate the situation. All creatures in the Evolutionary Universe and all of the Sacred warriors were immediately informed of his escape.</p>

  <p>"I do look like an earthworm..." Maha muttered, "but you will have to pay for saying that!"</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>At this moment, Maha gently stepped on the ground and shot out like an arrow leaving the bow. The saber in his right hand emitted a black light as he rushed towards Luo Luo Zheng at breakneck speed.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did not feel anything out of the ordinary, even when totally enveloped by the light. There were three thousand Divine Dao; it was impossible to understand the uniqueness of all of them.</p>

  <p>As he saw Maha rushing towards him, he didn't hesitate at all. His pair of heartless eyes flashed, and his fierce sword glowed with a majestic Mu Ning that once again cut down towards Maha!</p>

  <p>Huff!</p>

  <p>However, before Luo Zheng's sword could strike out, Maha raised his head and slashed with his saber.</p>

  <p>The strange thing was that Maha's blade wasn't aimed at Luo Luo Zheng. Rather, it was pointed in the direction of Iron Moon City?</p>

  <p>It was confusing, for where he had swung his blade was, after all, far from where Luo Luo Zheng was.</p>

  <p>The Iron Moon City was also in a state of disintegration. The human and Sacred world lords were all circling in the air, observing the two battle from a distance where if they were even slightly caught up in it, their lives would be in danger. Yet it seemed none of them cared.</p>

  <p>"Is Maha out of his mind?" one world lord said.</p>

  <p>"It's better to dodge it. It's heading towards us!" another onlooker exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Eh, what happened to you?" another said, puzzled.</p>

  <p>The world lords noticed the sudden shift in the space around them.</p>

  <p>Several of their companions had hurriedly retreated and disappeared from the crowd. In the next instant, they appeared in another place!</p>

  <p>At the same time ?</p>

  <p>The strike that Maha had made towards Iron Moon City also strangely appeared gearing towards Luo Luo Zheng. The saber light flashed, and with a clang, this saber had actually skillfully countered Luo Zheng's sword!</p>

  <p>Maha's face revealed a sneer. Then, his saber continued to slash in the direction of Iron Moon City.</p>

  <p>With the Grand World Technique, the power of Maha's saber light became even more intense. That saber light shot straight towards Luo Luo Zheng, attacking his vital points from every direction.</p>

  <p>Clank, clank, clank!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng gently lifted his hand and once again used the Great Weighty Sword to defend Maha's attacks, realizing that the Space Law in the surrounding area seemed to have been altered by Maha.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng wasn't the only one who noticed this. The martial artists in Iron Moon City also noticed that with every movement 30 feet to the east, they would naturally travel to a height of 60 feet!</p>

  <p>Therefore, when Maha slashed towards the east, that slash just so happened to cut down on Luo Luo Zheng, who was 60 feet above his head!</p>

  <p>This was the extraordinary capability of the Grand World Technique. It could change the rules as it wished!</p>

  <p>However, Maha's Grand World Technique was still incomplete in such a way that he could only change the rules to a certain degree. The true and complete Grand World Technique could change all the natural laws and create whatever rules the warrior wished for.</p>

  <p>In other words, the Grand World Technique's power seemed to be from an entire world of its own while being omnipotent in this world!</p>

  <p>During the constant clanging of their weapons, Luo Luo Zheng saw through the changes Maha made. He then used one hand to protect his head as he fell down, head first.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng and Maha crossed paths, their eyes met and flashed at the same time. The two of them could see the confidence in each other's eyes, letting the other know that they were sure to win!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled slightly, and suddenly slashed with his Great Weighty Sword!</p>

  <p>When the Gods-intimidating Strike was released, Luo Luo Zheng was already 30 feet below Maha, and his sword was also directed towards the east!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng thought that if Maha could change the rules, he would simply adapt to it.</p>

  <p>As Maha saw Luo Zheng's actions, he coldly smiled and said, "Childish!"</p>

  <p>According to the new rules of space created by Maha with his Grand World Technique, the laws that governed space and connections had changed.</p>

  <p>In this case, if a martial artist were to walk eastwards, they would appear 60 feet above the ground.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng plummeted downwards, and his eastward strike would have been ultimately slashing towards Maha, who was above him now.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, this rule was decided by Maha; therefore, he was able to instantly change the rules to his liking. At this moment, when Luo Luo Zheng struck, Maha once again had changed the rules. The course of Luo Zheng's strike was altered, and his slash went towards the west.</p>

  <p>In this instance, the attack had appeared behind Luo Luo Zheng, and Luo Zheng's sword was slashing towards himself!</p>

  <p>In the face of his continuous attack apparently appearing behind himself, Luo Zheng's heart trembled as he did a somersault in the air, forcibly dodging his own sword intent. He could not help but frown.</p>

  <p>Maha, who was above him, revealed an apologetic expression. He shrugged his shoulders and said, "I'm genuinely sorry. I'm the ruler here!"</p>

  <p>As his voice fell, Maha once again brandished the saber in his hand and rushed towards Luo Luo Zheng. The saber was raised high in the air, and as the orbs of black light gathered on the blade edge, it began to produce terrifying kinetic energy!</p>

  <p>The bizarre clothes Luo Luo Zheng was wearing seemed to be effective in protecting him, yet Maha didn't believe that he wouldn't be able to kill him.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Luo Zheng was about to swing his sword to block Maha's attack, he suddenly felt his body sink as he lost his balance and fell towards the ground. Furthermore, he was also unable to dodge Maha's slash!</p>

  <p>However, it wasn't just Luo Luo Zheng, but all of the martial artists within the scope of Maha's Grand World Technique simultaneously began to fall downwards.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Maha had changed the Wind Law.</p>

  <p>Under normal circumstances, a warrior could fly after they had reached the Illuminating Soul Realm, and that ability relied on the Wind Law.</p>

  <p>Therefore, when an Illuminating Soul Realm warrior practiced flying, the most important thing was to move with the wind.</p>

  <p>But at this moment, the Wind Law had been directly prohibited by Maha.</p>

  <p>Those within the range of the Grand World Technique, would not be able to fly, even Maha himself!</p>

  <p>Knowing this would happen, Maha prepared himself beforehand. After pointing his sword, he adjusted his body, and used the power of his descent to increase the strength of his strike!</p>

  <p>As for Luo Luo Zheng, who had suddenly lost his balance, facing Maha's saber was unavoidable.</p>

  <p>"This ability is impressive!" Luo Luo Zheng was smiling as he fell. As Maha's saber slammed down at him, he suddenly waved the Great Weighty Sword in his hand. Relying on the weight of the sword, he spun in the air without dodging and reached out to grab Maha's saber!</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Pfft!</p>

  <p>For the first time, the black light contained within Maha's weapon made Luo Luo Zheng bleed. It cut open Luo Zheng's palm, and golden blood flowed from the cut.</p>

  <p>Maha's blade remained impaled on Luo Zheng's palm, but it couldn't go any further.</p>

  <p>Maha thought, 'This fellow's physical body is...'</p>

  <p>What was happening made him gape.</p>

  <p>He knew that the long robe on Luo Zheng's body had an extraordinary origin. It was thin as paper, yet it was impervious to any weapon!</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, he didn't expect that Luo Zheng's physical body would also be extraordinarily strong. He had used almost all of his strength to slash, but he couldn't even cut off one of Luo Zheng's hands. How could there be such a creature like Luo Luo Zheng in the Evolutionary Universe? How was he supposed to defeat Luo Luo Zheng?</p>
