  <p>
</p>

  <p>Norris was known as one of the most powerful cultivators in the Grand Pure Realm. Only a few could match his overwhelming physical strength.</p>

  <p>Even the weaker members of the Misty River race were no match for him.</p>

  <p>That was why everyone who was watching didn't expect he would die in such a pathetic way. He died on the Flaming Maple Tree before he could even make a move.</p>

  <p>The creatures that followed Norris were left dumbfounded. Their eyes and mouths were wide open as they looked at the bloody scene on the Flaming Maple Tree.</p>

  <p>They trembled in fear as they realized that the warrior that they looked up to easily died in such a miserable way.</p>

  <p>As the creatures turned to look at Luo Zheng, their anger dissipated and was replaced by extreme horror. They couldn't help thinking if this guy was just really a human.</p>

  <p>After killing Norris, Luo Zheng looked at King Ieuan, Fuxi, and the Snake Goddess, who were still being detained.</p>

  <p>The three creatures that were guarding them were still in shock. However, as they discovered that Luo Zheng was looking at their direction, they quickly regained their senses and felt like an electric shock was running beneath their skin. Fearing greatly for their lives, they jumped into the Divine River behind them without thinking twice.</p>

  <p>Splash! Splash! Splash!</p>

  <p>As their bodies fell into the water, they wasted no time and quickly fled downstream.</p>

  <p>At that moment, there were still other creatures in the open space of the forest. Most of them were neutral, while a few of them were closely related to the Nihility race.</p>

  <p>However, right now, it was a conflict between Luo Zheng and the Element Spirit Civilization, and these creatures were having fun watching the commotion.</p>

  <p>"Now this is interesting."</p>

  <p>"I wonder if this guy's surprising strength is enough to challenge the members of the Misty River race."</p>

  <p>"Humph! That's nothing. He may be able to deal with the ordinary members of the Misty River race, but if that man reveals himself, this human will be ravaged into pieces. Don't even dream about it!"</p>

  <p>The creatures chatted and whispered among themselves.</p>

  <p>For a long time now, these creatures had lived beside the Divine River and were oppressed by the members of the Misty River race.</p>

  <p>They endured so many years, but they were just too weak to fight back. One could just imagine the grievance and agony in their hearts.</p>

  <p>With the sudden appearance of Luo Zheng, some creatures thought that he might be the glimmer of hope that they had been waiting. But when someone mentioned "that man", the remaining light of hope in their eyes quickly dissipated.</p>

  <p>That member of the Misty River race was exceptionally powerful. No one ever defeated him, at least in the Grand Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the center of the Snake Goddess's palm flashed a faint green light. Wherever the light passed, the wounds on the surface of her body instantly healed.</p>

  <p>Fuxi also started healing his wounds, and in no time, their bodies had already recovered.</p>

  <p>After that, Luo Zheng approached them and said, "I think those guys wouldn't dare to stop us anymore. It's our chance to swim downstream."</p>

  <p>There were actually still a few creatures left. However, they were much weaker than Luo Zheng. With Luo Zheng's current strength, he could just easily kill them all if they tried to hinder them.</p>

  <p>When they were about to set out, three members of the Misty River race, who were watching earlier, stood in front of them. Larkin, the leader of their group, deliberately blocked Luo Zheng's way.</p>

  <p>Even if Luo Zheng brought down a powerful warrior like Norris, they remained unfazed. For them, the place was the territory of their race, and all creatures had to obey them.</p>

  <p>"You're blocking the way,"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng said coldly as he stared down at Larkin. "Do you think you can just leave like that?</p>

  <p>You killed someone in our territory," Larkin answered in a condescending tone.</p>

  <p>"That someone didn't belong to your race," Luo Zheng said with a smirk. "And this is not your territory."</p>

  <p>When the other creatures in the open space of the forest heard this, a faint smile appeared on their faces as they repeatedly nodded. The Flaming Maple Forest itself was a shelter in the Three Purities Stage. Then, the Misty River race occupied the place and started threatening the creatures there. However, they couldn't fight back as the Misty River race was much more powerful than them here.</p>

  <p>But still, most of the creatures feared the authority of the Misty River race, so they didn't dare utter a word of support towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Obviously, Luo Zheng's words offended the Misty River race. The faces of the three members immediately darkened, and a strong killing intent oozed from Larkin's eyes.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng was just an ordinary Other Shore creature, Larkin would have already grabbed his head and smashed it to the ground.</p>

  <p>However, Larkin clearly witnessed Luo Zheng's strength when he killed Norris effortlessly. He did not dare to be rash and only managed to answer with a sinister smile, "Don't push your luck, human. You'll definitely regret it!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng just laughed away his threat. "Stop yapping, and just do it, if you can."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng took a quick step forward and knocked off Larkin's sturdy and heavy body with ease. He stared down at Larkin for a few seconds before he left with the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and King Ieuan.</p>

  <p>Fuxi had a smirk on his face while shaking his head as they left the area.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess and Fuxi seldom appeared in the Flaming Maple Forest. On the other hand, King Ieuan had been staying in the forest for quite a long time. In order to build a good relationship with the creatures on the Other Shore, it had no choice but to endure several hardships. But now that it was with Luo Zheng and the two Eternal Realm masters, it had a beaming self-confidence.</p>

  <p>When they approached the lower reaches of the Divine River, they saw that the currents became more turbulent. From time to time, there would be huge whirlpools rapidly appearing and disappearing.</p>

  <p>As they arrived at the river, they noticed that the creatures that should be standing guard had already fled.</p>

  <p>"Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Madam Ying are at the bottom of the river,"</p>

  <p>King Ieuan informed. "This area is very dangerous. The undercurrents are complex and several unknown monsters reside there."</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Ying were trapped and forced into the undercurrents. However, the two of them seemed to have known the rules applied there. They had stayed there for so long but didn't encounter any sort of danger.</p>

  <p>"If the undercurrents are too complex, then it would not be easy to find them. Is there a possibility that they could come out by themselves?" the Snake Goddess asked.</p>

  <p>"It should actually be possible. Not long ago, Eastern Emperor Taiyi surfaced and tried to escape. However, his attempt failed because several creatures were guarding the shore," King Ieuan said. "Now that the creatures that were supposed to be guarding have already fled, they should be able to come out on their own. The only problem is how we could inform them."</p>

  <p>The eyes of Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and Luo Zheng immediately lit up at its words. "Well, the two of them will have to suffer a little bit," the Snake Goddess said with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>After the Soul Interdicting Water on their bodies lost its effect, they quickly left the Other Shore and rushed to the residences of Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Ying.</p>

  <p>They saw that their bodies were still in good condition and their breath had not weakened. This meant that they were not hurt on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>After releasing their bodies from the red crystals, the Snake Goddess stretched out two of her fingers, and her shadow turned into a thin energy needle. Then she wrote something carefully on the arms of Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Ying.</p>

  <p>There were caves of various sizes at the bottom of the Divine River. As the caves were connected with each other, complex undercurrents were formed.</p>

  <p>Inside one of the undercurrents, there was a long and narrow cave that only a single person could pass through. In the innermost layer of this cave, Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Ying sat there with legs crossed, soaked in the Soul Interdicting Water.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi, who had been meditating with his eyes closed, suddenly felt a piercing pain in his arm. He immediately opened his eyes and saw that some words were being written on it.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, he thought of the person who could be writing them.</p>

  <p>"Concubine Yan?" he muttered.</p>
