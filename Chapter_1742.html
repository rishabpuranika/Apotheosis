<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1742 The Faces And The Murals </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was like an arrow that left the bow swiftly as he dashed forward at an astonishing speed!</p>

  <p>The speed of the shadow wasn't slow, either as its malicious Mu Ning disappeared in no time. It appeared to turn around and concurrently speed forward.</p>

  <p>But it seemed that their distance never got close.</p>

  <p>It was as if this black shadow had trained in Eight Smoky Melodies too.</p>

  <p>It was able to maintain the distance between the two of them at around a hundred feet.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng refused to believe this. The principle of the Eight Smoky Melodies made it nearly impossible for the distance to be that far. The space between them could have been three inches, five inches, or even more, but it could never be ten feet.</p>

  <p>One in front and the other flying behind, the surrounding terrain also underwent a change.</p>

  <p>Round holes that were about three feet wide continuously appeared in the ground as malicious Mu Ning continued to surge out from them, making them look like geysers. Only, what came from these holes was not spring water but malicious Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>This malicious Mu Ning became increasingly thick until one could only see what was in front of them!</p>

  <p>Sadly, Luo Luo Zheng was unable to lock onto the black shadow in this environment and lost its track quickly.</p>

  <p>"I lost it," Luo Luo Zheng said, stopping.</p>

  <p>As she floated behind Luo Luo Zheng, Xun keenly surveyed the surroundings and said with a face full of shock, "I never thought that the Killing Sword Mountain would have such a peculiar sight. How was it created?"</p>

  <p>Though seeing the scene made Xun a bit puzzled, her profound knowledge was more in-depth than that of Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Pop! Pop! Pop!</p>

  <p>The balls of malicious Mu Ning looked as if they were being spat out by the behemoths.</p>

  <p>For quite a time, Luo Luo Zheng had been submerged in the Killing Sword Mountain. And now, he was affected by the malicious Mu Ning as a restless feeling arose within his heart.</p>

  <p>"Still not right. This malicious Mu Ning is coming from deep underground?"</p>

  <p>Unable to find the shadow, Luo Luo Zheng landed next to a hole, and taking advantage of the interval, looked down inside.</p>

  <p>Much to his surprise, Luo Luo Zheng vividly saw a face.</p>

  <p>To be more accurate, it was not a human face, but one that looked like that of a fiend from the abyss with a pair of fangs covering its upper lip!</p>

  <p>The eyes in that face were tightly shut, as if they were lifeless.</p>

  <p>Not long after, it suddenly opened its mouth!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng quickly retracted his head, and a thick pillar of malicious Mu Ning spurted out from the hole.</p>

  <p>"What did you see?" A perplexed expression plastered on Xun's face.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng silently pointed at the hole with a strange expression. Soon after the pillar of air stopped, Xun also looked inside the hole.</p>

  <p>With a single glance, her face also underwent a drastic change. Xun possessed a sword spirit body, so naturally, she wouldn't turn deathly pale like a real person. However, Luo Luo Zheng could discern fear in her eyes.</p>

  <p>This kind of expression rarely appeared on Xun's face since she was incredibly decisive when it came to her fighting skills especially her killing way. And that decisiveness was one of her attributes that could resist any form of fear arising from within her heart. Luo Luo Zheng knew there was something unusual.</p>

  <p>"How is this possible?" Xun muttered, looking more confused than ever before sweeping her gaze around. "Are these holes full of this thing?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng glanced into another hole and confirmed, "It seems so. What are these things?"</p>

  <p>Xun contemplated for a while before pursing her lips. Shaking her head, she muttered, "I've only seen it once, and there should only be one of them. Why are there so many of them hidden at the bottom of the Killing Sword Mountain? Could it be that it has something to do with the calamity of the world of chaos?"</p>

  <p>"What is it?" Luo Zheng's curiosity was piqued.</p>

  <p>"Not now," Xun went on, shaking her head as she stared at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Xun was so straightforward ever since they were together. She had been brutally honest with Luo Luo Zheng and never concealed anything from him.</p>

  <p>'What are all these things? Why can't she tell me?' Luo Luo Zheng thought, staring at Xun in a baffled state He felt that since his return from the Illusion Battlefield, her temperament seemed to have changed, becoming more real, but at the same time, she was even colder towards him.</p>

  <p>"Let's keep going." Xun clearly understood what Luo Luo Zheng had in mind, but she didn't want to explain.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng inwardly sighed as he had no choice but to continue cautiously exploring this area. He slowly inched his way to avoid the pillars of malicious Mu Ning that was spewing out of the holes.</p>

  <p>Not long after he started moving forward, Luo Luo Zheng eventually discovered some specifics hidden in the depths of the Killing Sword Mountain.</p>

  <p>There was a cyan hall with two strange statues standing at the entrance.</p>

  <p>The heads of both statues that resembled goats were carved with incomparable malevolence. It was unknown what race's culture it was, but it was definitely not human.</p>

  <p>Silently sauntering towards the statues, Luo Luo Zheng couldn't believe his eyes as he inspected them. He marveled at the smoothness of their surfaces against the tips of his fingers as he gently and leisurely stroked them.</p>

  <p>Though he knew nothing about their material compositions and how long they had stood there, he concluded that the sculptures were extraordinarily exquisite since they had no signs of any decay.</p>

  <p>Looking up, Luo Luo Zheng found the hall was in total darkness like the big, open mouth of a monster lying on its stomach, quietly waiting for him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng didn't hesitate to take his initial step as he tightened his grip on the Thunder Wind Divine Sword.</p>

  <p>For Luo Luo Zheng, all these fears came from the fluctuations of one's state of mind.</p>

  <p>Since he had already found this place, there was no reason for him to turn back. Whatever inside, he was resolute in finding out.</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng and Xun entered, a figure slowly appeared outside the hall. Underneath this figure's feet, there was a black shadow crawling on the ground, whose pair of green eyes was very eye-catching against the darkness.</p>

  <p>That figure had only appeared briefly. And upon seeing Luo Luo Zheng move toward the main hall, they had soundlessly concealed themselves in a corner.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng walked within the hall, the malicious Mu Ning in the air seemed to have become less intense, and it also went with the restless feeling it had stirred up earlier on.</p>

  <p>Even so, Luo Luo Zheng detected that the hall was dark and with a slight trace of malicious Mu Ning. Though he activated his magical vision, it didn't get much better. He had no choice but to take out a Glint Pearl to light up the place.</p>

  <p>"There is Dark Law here to prevent light from passing through,"</p>

  <p>Xun reminded him from behind.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng slightly nodded. While holding the Glint Pearl in his hand, he got nearer to one side of the hall. A large mural stopped him in his tracks when the light hit the wall before him.</p>

  <p>The mural was magnificently carved into the wall, seemingly made of the same material components as the statues outside. Luo Luo Zheng didn't know how long it had been in existence, but the details were so vivid and lifelike.</p>

  <p>"This is ?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng leaned in close. He focused his gaze on the contents of the mural.</p>

  <p>There were numerous strange-looking creatures carved in the mural, and they came in different sizes; some were big, and some were small. A lot of them were unknown to him, but to his surprise, Luo Luo Zheng had recognized the largest one!</p>

  <p>He had seen this big beast before when he entered the blood-red castle during the second stage of the Illusion Battlefield. It was the gigantic beast statue standing at the entrance of the castle.</p>

  <p>In the mural, the gigantic beast was like a large ship. It opened its mouth and made a sucking motion, wanting to swallow the other countless creatures in the mural.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng looked ahead and continued strolling forward when a second mural appeared.</p>

  <p>The creatures in the second mural seemed to be resisting with all their might. It was as if they wanted to kill this enormous beast. In the third mural, however, Luo Luo Zheng noted that only the beast was present, while the other creatures had all disappeared.</p>

  <p>The murals were not difficult to read.</p>

  <p>It only implied that there were a lot of creatures resisting the gigantic beast. In the end, however, they failed and were recorded in the murals.</p>

  <p>These creatures must be real, judging from the lifelike carvings of the giant beast. However, after careful examination, Luo Luo Zheng did not find a single human among them.</p>

  <p>There was not a single human-shaped creature.</p>

  <p>In the present universe, many intelligent beings had great ties with humans. They were ogres, Demon Night, Giants, and so on.</p>

  <p>They all possessed four limbs, a head, and a torso.</p>

  <p>However, the creatures in the murals were extremely bizarre in appearance, even more bizarre than some of the beasts.</p>

  <p>This hall, in particular, wasn't constructed by humans. Why was it hiding here?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was deeply puzzled. He found himself having a hard time explaining and grasping even a single strange thing that he had seen right after he entered the Killing Sword Mountain.</p>

  <p>Xun, on the other hand, clearly knew something, but she chose not to answer his question.</p>

  <p>Contemplating deeply this, Luo Luo Zheng halted his steps in the darkness and opted to communicate with the cyan dragon in his mind.</p>

  <p>"Cyan dragon, do you know what place this is?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Cyan dragon had been quiet along the way. He did not utter a word when he encountered so many things. It was clear that he knew something.</p>
