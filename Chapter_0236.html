<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 236 Face To The Fight (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>After witnessing what had happened, Luo Zheng came up with an idea. He took the opportunity to summon the life energy in his body. He waved his fist as he shouted, "Ogres Shaking the World!"</p>

  <p>When the black shadow formed by the demonic life energy punched the giant hawk, the color of the hawk began to change from grey and brown to black.</p>

  <p>A smile appeared on Zheng's face. He hooked his finger at the hawk and watched as the bird flew to him and settled on his shoulder under his instruction.</p>

  <p>"Hey, young man!" The Illuminating Soul Realm master who had summoned the giant hawk shouted as he pointed at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Haha...you'd better mind yourself!" Seymour ignored what the man said and continued to chase the Illuminating Soul Realm master with the jade sword in his hand.</p>

  <p>The person who survived the battle would get everything in the fairy palace. Even if all opponents survived, the person with the rightful claim over the contents of the fairy palace was driven to kill his opponents as he didn't want to share the benefits with the others. After all, greed and selfishness are innate human qualities.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng walked on the edge of the pavilion with the giant hawk on his shoulder. He didn't intend on participating in the fight at this time.</p>

  <p>If someone's life vitality avatar came close to him, Luo Zheng would instruct the black hawk on his shoulder to devour that person's life vitality.</p>

  <p>After a short while, the black hawk began to grow in size. Soon, it expanded to over thirty feet in height!</p>

  <p>What a giant monster!</p>

  <p>The hawk was so big that it couldn't rest on Zheng's shoulder any longer.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Luo Zheng ordered it to hover around and wait for his command.</p>

  <p>Those Illuminating Soul Realm masters whose life vitality Luo Zheng had devoured were shocked and confused. However, because they were fighting with other masters who were at the same refining grade as them, they couldn't shift their attention to Luo Zheng. They watched helplessly as their life vitality avatar was consumed.</p>

  <p>"Ah! Ah!"</p>

  <p>A miserable shriek filled the pavilion as another Illuminating Soul Realm master was killed. A colorful spear had pierced his body. Of course, the owner of the colorful spear was an Illuminating Soul Realm master too.</p>

  <p>Not far from them, two Illuminating Soul Realm masters were hunting Sandra with the same long-handled broadswords in their hands.</p>

  <p>They were most likely twin brothers as not only did they have the same weapons in their hands, but their clothes were similar. Most importantly, they shared the same facial features.</p>

  <p>In spite of her wisdom, Sandra was not good at attacking. Under the attack of the two brothers, she seemed to be losing ground.</p>

  <p>"Sandra, don't run! You'd better take off all your clothes and let us have some fun!</p>

  <p>The place is so small. Where will you run to?"</p>

  <p>The twin brothers bullied and insulted Sandra as they chased after her.</p>

  <p>Finally, the twin brothers had cornered Sandra. With no way out, she shouted angrily, "If you dare to do anything to me, word of your deeds will spread. Then even the Yu Clan will not be able to save your lives!"</p>

  <p>However, the twin brothers didn't care about her warning at all. "Do you think anyone will live to talk about what we do today?" A smug smile spread on their faces as the brothers replied.</p>

  <p>Sandra's face darkened as regret filled her. She remembered the young man in the mask who had reminded her not to move the fifth statue. 'He must know something!' she thought. Unfortunately, she didn't have the chance to undo her actions.</p>

  <p>While being hunted by the twin brothers, she noticed that the young man in the mask had used a special method to swallow others' life vitality.</p>

  <p>'Maybe he can help me.' Thinking about this, she looked around for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Her beautiful eyes were filled with despair. When she found Luo Zheng, she waved to him. Soon, life vitality gushed out from her body.</p>

  <p>After a short while, a huge blue light ball appeared over Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had seen such a light ball before. He remembered that to prevent the lightning leopard from being affected by the giant puppets, the long-haired woman named Sandra had wrapped it with the light ball.</p>

  <p>'Why is she gathering so much life vitality? Is she transferring her life vitality to me?' wondered Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Then he turned to Sandra and saw her nod at him. After that, she burned all the remaining life vitality in her body and then exploded with a loud booming sound.</p>

  <p>"What a pity! She would rather die than let us have fun," one of the twin brothers said sadly with a shake of his head. Just then, he heard a gust of wind behind him.</p>

  <p>With a puff, a knife pierced his chest. He looked at the broadsword and found it belonged to his younger brother. He turned around and stared at his brother with disbelief on his face. "Why? Why did you kill me?"</p>

  <p>The younger brother shook his head and said, "Sorry! Since only one person can survive today, I didn't want you to become my last rival. I'll take care of our parents."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng couldn't help but sigh at the action of the younger twin brother.</p>

  <p>If the long-haired woman had trusted him, these Illuminating Soul Realm masters wouldn't have killed each other. Now, they were caught in a battle to the death and had no choice but to kill each other.</p>

  <p>From what he had seen, Luo Zheng understood that there was no basic trust, not even between brothers.</p>

  <p>Seeing that the blue light ball formed by Sandra's life vitality before her death hadn't disappeared, Luo Zheng commanded the bird in silence. The black hawk shrieked as it flew toward the blue light ball.</p>

  <p>After transforming the blue light ball into demonic life energy, the black hawk grew even bigger!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng wasn't eager to join the fight. He stood still and waited for a chance.</p>

  <p>.</p>
