<br/><br/>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Most of the elders gathered around the meeting hall, waiting for Yudie's arrival.</p>

  <p>Before Yudie stepped into the meeting hall, a fierce cold wind blew in and the entire place suddenly became as cold as ice. The strong killing aura immediately enveloped everyone and the few elders couldn't help but feel flustered.</p>

  <p>With a sullen face, Yudie walked in. The elders looked at each other, all of them confused as to why their leader was exasperated.</p>

  <p>"What happened to her?"</p>

  <p>"Who has ruffled her feathers?"</p>

  <p>"Keep it down. She might hear us!"</p>

  <p>It was obvious that she was in a terrible mood. No one dared speak up in fear of offending her. That was the last thing they all wanted.</p>

  <p>Saint Morphens bowed to Yudie and then said, "Master Ning, every one is ready in the Cloud Hall. We can set off at any time."</p>

  <p>"Okay," Yudie responded absent-mindedly.</p>

  <p>Seeing her gloomy face, Saint Morphens couldn't help but remind her,</p>

  <p>"Master Ning, Zheng is not here yet."</p>

  <p>The elders stared at Yudie in unison to see how she would react to that.</p>

  <p>Ever since Zheng's return to the Cloud Hall, the elders had a new assessment of his strength. Although Zheng was only at the primary stage of Virtual Tribulation Realm, he had easily killed Emanuel. His fighting capacity might have passed that of Morphens, making him an indispensable top fighter for the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>Although the sect wars had involved billions of martial artists, it was usually those top masters with formidable strength that had the power to decide the outcome of a battle.</p>

  <p>After a month of discussion, the Cloud Hall and the Oracle City finally reached an agreement. As the two strongest sects in the Central Region, they could not sit still and wait for death. They decided to join hands to fight against the Heavenly Evil Sect.</p>

  <p>At first, Saint Morphens had planned to notify Zheng about their moves, but Yudie told him that she wanted to do it herself. However, Yudie returned to the meeting hall with a murderous look on her face, and Zheng was nowhere to be seen.</p>

  <p>Everyone was confused about what was going on, especially Saint Morphens and the other elders.</p>

  <p>"There's no need to bring him with us. Gather all the warriors at and above the level of Illuminating Soul Realm. We will set off!" Yudie roared, her aura detonating. The cultivation methods she had cultivated were already powerful, but after she stepped into the Life and Death Realm, her strength had undoubtedly increased by a mile. As they witnessed such surge of energy burst out from her, many of the elders felt a chill down their spine.</p>

  <p>Up in the air right above the Cloud Hall, countless disciples had formed an army that then flew towards the Cloudy City below.</p>

  <p>If one from the Cloudy City looked up, the person could see black dots falling from the sky. All of those dots were actually martial artists. It was a spectacular view for the commoners of Cloudy City.</p>

  <p>"I heard that the Cloud Hall is out to battle!"</p>

  <p>"Alas, the influence of the Heavenly Evil Sect has expanded rapidly! I think the Cloud Hall and the World Commercial Alliance are going to start the final counterattack soon."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid that this battle will determine the fate of the Central Region!</p>

  <p>Eddie is truly an incredible person. If he succeeds, then he has the ability to unify the entire Central Region!"</p>

  <p>Since ancient times, there had never been a single force that had unified the entire Central Region. If Eddie were to make it, then he would be the first person in the history of the Central Region to unify the place.</p>

  <p>After the Cloud Hall warriors had entered the Cloudy City, they all flew straight towards the transmission array. The first ones to enter were the warriors at the Illuminating Soul Realm, the next ones were warriors at the Internal Elixir Realm, which were followed by the elders at the Virtual Tribulation Realm.</p>

  <p>Yudie, Saint Morphens and the others were the last ones to enter the transmission array.</p>

  <p>Standing beside the transmission array, Yudie lifted her head to look at the Cloud Hall floating above.</p>

  <p>"Master Ning, I think it's best to bring Zheng along for this expedition,"</p>

  <p>Saint Morphens said.</p>

  <p>There was no valid reason he could think of as to why Yudie chose to leave Zheng behind.</p>

  <p>The hostility Zheng and Eddie had for one another was not a secret. Even if it wasn't for the Heavenly Evil Sect, a skirmish between them was still bound to happen. Moreover, Zheng had not yet revealed his true strength.</p>

  <p>He had also made such remarkable contributions to the Cloud Hall, and it was irreverent to leave him out during such an important battle.</p>

  <p>"I think it's more appropriate for him to stay at the Cloud Hall," Yudie responded with a smile. Not every warrior from the Cloud Hall was there for the battle. A small group was left behind. After pausing for a while, Yudie continued, "Besides, he seems to like staying there. With a beauty accompanying him, I can say that he's having fun. He is quite obsessed with his current life. So let him stay."</p>

  <p>"But…</p>

  <p>Master Ning, we are facing a very ominous foe. I think personal affairs should be put aside for now." Saint Morphens' words were straightforward. In all honesty, he was referring to Yudie's jealousy. The fate of the Cloud Hall was more important than her feelings at that time.</p>

  <p>'Even if you feel sour about Zheng and Margaret, you should not disregard your supreme priority, ' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>Yudie only snorted at Saint Morphens' words. Without any more talking, she turned around and entered the transmission array.</p>

  <p>The other elders and Saint Morphens all exchanged glances with bitter smiles on their faces. Then, they followed suit.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng was already in his meditative state. He felt that his cultivation was one step away from the middle stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm. If he could surpass the thin layer of obstruction, then it was easier for him to steadily break through.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng knew so little about the situation in the Central Region, he could still thoroughly analyze it himself. To him, the time when he would fight with Eddie was approaching, so he believed it was imperative for him to break through to the middle stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm.</p>

  <p>In the practice room, Zheng had lost track of time. While he was meditating, both the cyan and red dragons barely made a sound.</p>

  <p>Normally, Xun could often just leave Zheng's body on her own, but at that time, she seemed to have fallen asleep and rarely showed up.</p>

  <p>After all, that was the perfect time for him to break through. Although it wasn't so difficult for him to step into the middle stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm, it was critical for a martial artist to break through a bottleneck. He must not be disturbed at any cost.</p>

  <p>Sitting quietly at the gate of the practice room where Zheng stayed was Margaret. On several occasions, she went to the Cloudy City to collect some rare flowers. She carefully trimmed them, and then cut them into exquisite shapes and created certain patterns.</p>

  <p>At that time, there were already at least six or seven pots of flowers placed in front of the practice room. Those flower pots were arranged in a row and looked very lush and beautiful.</p>

  <p>During that period of time, warriors in the Cloud Hall were lesser in number. Compared to the past, there were not as many warriors that came to the practice rooms. Most of the ones who still entered were nature creatures. It was rare to see an Illuminating Soul Realm or Internal Elixir Realm martial artist in the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>The entire place had become desolate.</p>

  <p>Although Margaret clearly felt the changes in the Cloud Hall, she didn't bother to think about it. In her heart, Zheng had already become the center of her world and she didn't want to mind the trivial things.</p>

  <p>The truth was that even the small tradesmen and porters in the Cloudy City knew about Cloud Hall and its huge expedition, but Margaret, an Internal Elixir Realm warrior didn't have a single clue.</p>

  <p>"His closed-door cultivation is taking a while."</p>

  <p>Pouting her lips, Margaret stared at the door of the practice room. She cut off an emerald green root with her fair-skinned fingers and with a flick, she inserted the violet into the pot with precision.</p>

  <p>The number of flowers at the entrance of the practice room continued to increase. Every day, she placed a pot of flowers there. Originally, there were only a couple of them. Now, there were too many.</p>

  <p>The number of flowers that had bloomed at the entrance of the practice room had increased to thirty-five.</p>

  <p>One day, a strong aura suddenly erupted from the practice room. That particular room was top-level in the Cloud Hall. The partitions in the room were all made of special metal, but even those were unable to obstruct the aura in the slightest.</p>

  <p>A smile found its way to Margaret's face. "Has he broken through? Will he come out today?"</p>

  <p>Her now flushed face was full of hope as she gazed at the door. Thinking of what she had to say to Zheng, she felt a bit embarrassed and hesitant.</p>

  <p>"Click!"</p>

  <p>The door to the practice room pushed open and Zheng's figure flashed out with a faint smile on his face. At that moment, he had already stepped into the middle stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm.</p>

  <p>"He did it! He broke through!"</p>

  <p>Margaret exclaimed, immediately standing up to walk over to Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Sorry for the wait!</p>

  <p>How long has it been since I entered the practice room?" Zheng had completely lost track of time upon his entry into a meditative state in the practice room.</p>

  <p>Margaret blinked and gently said, "Count these flowers and you'll know how many days have passed."</p>

  <p>Zheng's gaze swept across the flowers, and his expression changed when he got the number, "Thirty-five days. I've actually practiced in isolation for so long this time."</p>

  <p>"It's alright," Margaret reassured. She put her black hair to the side and softly whispered in his ear, "Zheng, can I stay at your place tonight?" As she spoke with utmost tenderness, her cheeks turned completely red.</p>

  <p>Surprised for a moment, Zheng nodded his head and disregarded his initial hesitation.</p>

  <p>The two of them were still quite young. When Zheng took her virginity energy away, it was both their first time. Inevitably, they both craved the warmth they gave each other when they made love. The reason why Zheng hesitated for a bit was that he still kept Yudie in his heart. He still didn't know that she was no longer in the Cloud Hall. . . .</p>
