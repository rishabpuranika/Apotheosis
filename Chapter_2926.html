<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2926 Original Will </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng turned the corner of the passageway, he finally saw what awaited him at the end.</p>

  <p>As he had expected, the passageway led to a desert made of colorful sand.</p>

  <p>A gust of strong wind blew a thin layer of colorful sand into the passageway.</p>

  <p>Without hesitation, Luo Zheng walked straight toward the desert. It was exactly the same as what he had seen in the space-times on both sides of the passageway.</p>

  <p>But he clearly knew that those spaces had been windows into the past; the desert in front of him was the one that existed in the present.</p>

  <p>The main difference he noticed was that the wind in this desert seemed to be much milder, and the tornadoes had disappeared altogether. Luo Zheng swept his eyes around for more clues and found that the sand dune in the center of the desert had collapsed.</p>

  <p>'Did the baby manage to materialize and climb out of the basin?' Luo Zheng wondered, a trace of anxiety gripping him.</p>

  <p>As if on cue, a chuckle rang out again. As he walked forward, Luo Zheng finally saw a gigantic baby on the other side of the sand dune.</p>

  <p>The baby was playing with the sand on the ground, and the cross that had been hovering above the basin had landed on its head.</p>

  <p>The baby inserted its hands into the sand and gently kneaded it before throwing the fistful of sand at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>As this fistful of sand flew in the air, it turned into a colorful spiral.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the spiral wasn't coming at Luo Zheng at full speed. He gently twisted his body and avoided the spiral.</p>

  <p>The baby didn't seem to care at all and continued to giggle with an innocent look on its face.</p>

  <p>Once again, it gathered the sand in its hands and threw it at Luo Zheng, and once again, Luo Zheng dodged the spiral.</p>

  <p>As he moved, he suddenly found that the Infinity Ruler in his mind had turned in the opposite direction.</p>

  <p>Now, the Infinity Ruler was pointing to the baby instead of some part of the maze.</p>

  <p>'Is the Infinity Ruler guiding me toward the baby?' Luo Zheng wondered in confusion. His eyes twitched as he struggled to understand what this baby's existence meant.</p>

  <p>As he was pondering over this, the baby suddenly got up on its feet and stood at a height of almost 400 feet.</p>

  <p>Then, it ran toward Luo Zheng like a tower!</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>As the baby ran, Luo Zheng felt a great rush of pressure approaching him.</p>

  <p>Not knowing the baby's intentions, he immediately stepped back. The baby was not slow by any means, but fortunately, it was still slow enough for Luo Zheng to avoid.</p>

  <p>But the moment he stepped back, the baby suddenly let out a cry of anguish.</p>

  <p>"Waah..."</p>

  <p>The cry contained a trace of anger, as if the baby was wondering why Luo Zheng refused to play with it.</p>

  <p>The loud sound made Luo Zheng's body tremble unwillingly, and he felt as if there was a bell ringing in his ears. The baby's cry, which seemed to be akin to a magic spell, took away his ability to move. He could only watch helplessly as the baby ran over to him.</p>

  <p>At this moment, he heard No. 9527's voice in his mind. "Don't you see?</p>

  <p>This baby is an original will. It wants to devour you."</p>

  <p>"An original will? And it wants to devour me?!" Luo Zheng was slightly stunned.</p>

  <p>The entire way, while he had been observing the changes in the passageway, No. 9527 had been making its own observations as well.</p>

  <p>At first, No. 9527 had also been a bit puzzled by the scenes in the spaces on the walls of the passageway. However, after Luo Zheng had arrived at this desert at the end of the passageway, realization had set in.</p>

  <p>"The truth is, when I followed you to the divine land, I couldn't figure out how the divine land managed to maintain its purity," No. 9527 said casually.</p>

  <p>"Maintain its purity? What do you mean? Tell me quickly! That baby is rushing over," Luo Zheng said anxiously.</p>

  <p>The baby looked innocent, but who knew what it was capable of?</p>

  <p>Anyway, it was able to take away Luo Zheng's ability to move just by crying. If the time to fight came, Luo Zheng didn't know if he would be able to deal with the baby.</p>

  <p>However, No. 9527 didn't seem to be in a hurry at all. "Don't panic. The original will is very simple and innocent. It doesn't have any strategies or ulterior motives. At most, it will just devour you and inherit your will."</p>

  <p>"You think me being devoured is not a big deal?" Luo Zheng asked incredulously.</p>

  <p>He didn't know whether to cry or laugh in his heart, but the expression on his face remained blank. He now realized that he couldn't even control his facial muscles. "Are you telling me that this baby is the will of the divine land? I can't believe this!"</p>

  <p>In fact, Luo Zheng had also pondered about the original will of the divine land.</p>

  <p>After all, the Evolutionary Universe also had its own will, but its will was controllable. However, he had never seen something similar in the divine land.</p>

  <p>"Yes," No. 9527 said. "Generally speaking, when one creates a world and the world leaves their hands, it will have a will of its own. This is inevitable in the Grand World Cultivation Method. Since the divine land has been out of Chiyou's hands for such a long time, it should have had its own will all along. But it seems that Chiyou took advantage of the Time Sea to constantly suppress the divine land's own will. What you saw in the space-times on both walls of the passageway is how the divine land's will had been suppressed until now."</p>

  <p>For countless years, this process had been repeated over and over again.</p>

  <p>Every time the original will was condensed, the water of the Time Sea would pour down and tear it into pieces, restarting the process.</p>

  <p>"But why has the divine land's will finally condensed now?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 shook its head. "I don't know. But it's obvious that the will has just been formed. It can't be long since it happened. There might have been an omission in a session. Or maybe the person who was responsible for overseeing the suppression of the original will died."</p>

  <p>No. 9527's speculation was actually very close to the truth.</p>

  <p>The person who was responsible for the suppression of the original will of the divine land was the leader of the Sun Blind race. Ever since she had taken over the Time Sea Forbidden Land, this had become her mission.</p>

  <p>However, when she had learned that the Mountain of Holy Beings had appeared in advance, she had known that the Infinity Ruler had been activated and that her mission had come to an end. In order to avoid being threatened or put in a tough spot, she had ended her life very decisively.</p>

  <p>"Anyway, it doesn't matter. The biggest problem now is how to deal with this baby," Luo Zheng said in his mind.</p>

  <p>"Well...it's actually not a problem. This original will is very pure. It has just been born, so it doesn't have any thoughts or intentions of its own; that's why it has taken a baby's form. Even if the baby devours you, your memories will quickly affect it, and then it will become you. So it wouldn't matter even if you were devoured," No. 9527 said with a laugh.</p>

  <p>"What? Are you kidding me? I don't want to be devoured!" Luo Zheng shouted in his mind.</p>

  <p>Deep in his heart, he knew that No. 9527's words were reasonable. Even if he was swallowed by the baby, he would still be Luo Zheng, and the baby would be affected by his chaotic memories and eventually turn into him.</p>

  <p>And yet, Luo Zheng felt a huge resistance to the concept of letting himself be swallowed by the baby.</p>
