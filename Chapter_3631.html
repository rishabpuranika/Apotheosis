<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The moment the Sun Crows disappeared, Zheng immediately noticed a problem.</p>

  <p>There was a limited number of theurgies in the Source World and even if a theurgy was created using more than ten Truths of Godly Ways, it would still be impossible to make so many Sun Crows invisible just like that.</p>

  <p>This effect could only be achieved through the use of an Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>These Sun Crows had been hidden right before launching an attack, which meant the cloaking technique could only last for a short period of time.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, they could just hide the Sun Crows when they were still far away and let them explode right above the nine positions of the array, which would be a disaster for the Mountain Sea Pass!</p>

  <p>Since the Sun Crows remained hidden during the charge, that meant the person who used the cloaking theurgy was within the group. Zheng had a hunch that it was most likely a demon woman from the Divine Lair.</p>

  <p>He summoned more than a hundred long swords to slash at the enemies around him. He wanted to kill as many Sun Crows as possible while searching for the possible demon woman.</p>

  <p>More than a hundred swords hacked and slashed all around, trying to find Zheng's true target. Finally, two swords were able to pinpoint this elusive demon woman. She thought the swords were mere ordinary blades, so she casually pushed them away.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately for her, her action attracted Zheng's attention, and he shot all the other swords towards her.</p>

  <p>She was just about to break out of the encirclement and sent several swords flying, but the rest of the swords immediately rushed towards her at top speed!</p>

  <p>"Draw more divine megatons of force!"</p>

  <p>There was no way Zheng was going to let go of this opportunity. He immediately let the power within his body erupt all at once!</p>

  <p>The transparent swords were originally infused with ten divine megatons of power, but Zheng's sudden burst of energy made three of the swords each contain four thousand divine megatons of power!</p>

  <p>"Bang, bang, bang..."</p>

  <p>Loud explosions followed after the barrage of these swords upon the demon woman. However, she simply used the Invisibility Curtain in her hand to block the attacks.</p>

  <p>"Using the swords to find out where I am? Very smart! Unfortunately, these swords are still too weak..." The demon woman stalked closer towards Zheng with a sneer.</p>

  <p>Dealing with an ordinary Sun Crow was possible with these puny swords imbued with ten divine megatons of power, but that wasn't going to cut it for her. There was no way a Chaotic Source Realm warrior such as her would ever be defeated by such weak energy.</p>

  <p>Just as she thought of this, ten more transparent swords shot towards her.</p>

  <p>"Bang, Bang..."</p>

  <p>The first few swords bounced off her, but when she touched the fourth sword, her cocky expression suddenly changed.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>This fourth sword did not contain just ten divine megatons of force, but four thousand! She could only watch in horror as it slashed through her fingers cleanly.</p>

  <p>Had she not been a Chaotic Source Realm warrior, then the sword would've cut off her entire arm!</p>

  <p>It was also fortunate that the Chaotic Source Spirits helped her resist the damage but they now surged restlessly in her body.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh..."</p>

  <p>Just as she was about to retaliate, another sword came towards her!</p>

  <p>In desperation to avoid this attack, the demon woman spread her wings and attempted to somersault in the air. Unfortunately for her, the sword still hit her.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The force that hit her was extraordinarily strong, but the Chaotic Source Spirits within her body pulled through and cushioned most of the blow.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng wasn't done.</p>

  <p>"The next sword..." he muttered.</p>

  <p>"Splash..."</p>

  <p>As he extracted the power from the Civilization Artifacts, the aura within Zheng's cinnabar field was released.</p>

  <p>His powerful aura startled Basil who was standing right next to him. "Zheng!</p>

  <p>What are you doing?!" Basil exclaimed in panic.</p>

  <p>Why was Zheng so serious in dealing with these weak birds? Why did he let out such an oppressing wave of power?</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Zheng's ears were sealed and Basil's question did not register.</p>

  <p>He was now solely focused on locating that demon woman and dealing the killing blow!</p>

  <p>The nine positions and the long swords outside them were maintained by the main array in the Mountain Sea Pass.</p>

  <p>Zheng naturally didn't hold back with the power he poured onto his swords.</p>

  <p>He forcefully drew out fifteen thousand divine megatons of power all at once!</p>

  <p>"Swish!"</p>

  <p>Not even Anthemar could ignore such an outstanding show of power!</p>

  <p>The oncoming transparent sword emitted a sharp sound, like a ferocious ghost screaming its battle cry, before shooting towards the void.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>The demon woman had no strength left in her to dodge. She could only watch as the long sword flew towards her, signifying her doom. The Chaotic Source Spirits were a frantic mess and tried to block it, but all of them instantly fell asleep the moment the sword pierced through her chest.</p>

  <p>"Puff!"</p>

  <p>A fountain of blood spurted from her chest and painted the sky a misty red.</p>

  <p>This explosion of blood mist attracted everyone's attention despite the constant explosions from the Self-exploding Sun Crows.</p>

  <p>"Come back!"</p>

  <p>After stabbing the demon woman, Zheng stretched out his finger and hooked it, commanding the sword to come back to him.</p>

  <p>Despite the obvious stab wound on her chest, Zheng worried that it might not have been enough to kill her. He couldn't take any chances.</p>

  <p>As the sword returned to Zheng, a figure stumbled into everyone's sight: the demon woman from the Divine Lair with a colorful cloth in her hand!</p>

  <p>The moment she appeared, the other Sun Crows also became visible and many Self-Exploding Sun Crows fell!</p>

  <p>Even Sinclair and the other experienced Oneness Generals couldn't help but shudder at the sight.</p>

  <p>This demon woman's eyes were filled with hatred.</p>

  <p>She had finally discovered the person who was controlling all those swords.</p>

  <p>It was Zheng who sat in a position of the array with his eyes closed!</p>

  <p>"Explode!" she ordered as she saw the long sword fly back towards her.</p>

  <p>"Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom..."</p>

  <p>Over a million Self-exploding Sun Crows floated in the air, but at this moment, all of them swarmed towards her and consecutively exploded.</p>

  <p>They wouldn't be able to stop Zheng but they could at least make him miss his target. This strategy proved effective as Zheng's sword narrowly missed her by inches.</p>

  <p>With a wave of her hand, the demon woman once again covered herself with the Invisibility Curtain and disappeared from sight.</p>

  <p>The moment she disappeared, Zheng wasted no time and once again gathered over a hundred long swords in an effort to scout her out. This time though, the demon woman was prepared and hid herself very well.</p>

  <p>However, she left in such a hurry that she failed to take the Self-exploding Sun Crows with her.</p>

  <p>Her last command had been for them to explode and so they did, sacrificing themselves like fireworks in the sky.</p>

  <p>When the last Self-exploding crow detonated, Sinclair and those surrounding the main array finally heaved a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>They were fortunate to have arrived at this outcome since they didn't have that many divine crystals on hand.</p>
