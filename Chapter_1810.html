<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1810 Failure Of Negotiation </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Maha must be of a remarkably high status as the Supreme Lords were so respectful towards him.</p>

  <p>He had already been as strong as a world lord, which was probably why it was not too difficult for him to get a Heavenly Destiny in another universe.</p>

  <p>He was not a Supreme Lord, but a Godly Genius.</p>

  <p>Maha had the true qualifications to become a True God.</p>

  <p>Maha wiped the blood off his mouth, shook his head, and said, "I've come here on behalf of the Sacred race and I have only one goal this time."</p>

  <p>"Just tell us," Supreme Lord of Oracle said coldly. She was clutching the small, exquisite sword in her hand so tight, and the knuckles of her hand were almost white.</p>

  <p>If both sides fell out, she would kill him immediately. But Maha was a Godly Genius with the potential to become a True God. Since the Sacred race had dared send him to negotiate, they must definitely have a way to protect him.</p>

  <p>Maha smiled faintly as he said, "The truth is that we do not like to fight and kill. We shouldn't use force to resolve this matter if we can help it.</p>

  <p>This is too barbaric."</p>

  <p>"Oh? You mean that the Sacred race will withdraw from our universe?"</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord of Oracle asked.</p>

  <p>The other Supreme Lords listened attentively, not knowing just what Maha was up to.</p>

  <p>Every race in the universe would be quite relieved if the members of the Sacred race were to leave the universe.</p>

  <p>Maha shook his head. "There are over a hundred thousand supreme worlds in this universe, with vast lands and sparse population. Our Sacred race has a countless number of descendants. We can establish our own sect here and coexist harmoniously with you. What do you think?"</p>

  <p>Everyone was shocked at Maha's words.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng sneered.</p>

  <p>What Maha said was surprising and his intention was unfathomable. The Sacred race was much stronger than many races in the universe. If this race passed through the Sighing Wall and established their own sect here, they could easily take control of this universe with their firm backing and support.</p>

  <p>"Personally, I think this plan is really good," Maha said with a broad smile.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord of Oracle looked solemn as she turned to look at the head of the Celestial Position race who was standing beside her.</p>

  <p>Master Feng mirrored Supreme Lord of Oracle's expression. These Supreme Lords were communicating with each other through the life vitality.</p>

  <p>They had understood what the Sacred race was planning on doing the moment Maha had proposed this plan.</p>

  <p>The Sacred race never lost an opportunity to invade the universe, but right now, they didn't want an all-out war.</p>

  <p>If the Supreme Lords agreed to Maha's request, they could give Luo Zheng and the other Godly Geniuses more time.</p>

  <p>As long as two or three of the ten Godly Geniuses became True Gods, they would have a chance to change the fate of the entire universe.</p>

  <p>The Sacred race was formidable, but they came from another universe, not the divine land.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords discussed this matter for a long time, during which many of them began to argue among themselves.</p>

  <p>Maha was showing great patience. He had both hands behind his back as his gaze swept past the Supreme Lords and landed on Luo Zheng and the others, observing them carefully.</p>

  <p>When the Sacred race had invaded the universe, they had slaughtered a number of members of the Spring race. They had obtained a lot of information after searching their souls continuously. The ten Godly Geniuses were publicly known throughout the universe, and Maha had a good understanding of who these young people were.</p>

  <p>Maha knew that the hope of the universe rested on these little fellows.</p>

  <p>But Maha didn't feel like taking the risk of killing them.</p>

  <p>Although he didn't care too much about his own safety, he would be in a spot if he acted right now and the Supreme Lords attacked him.</p>

  <p>His life was more precious than the lives of these Godly Geniuses.</p>

  <p>"We can agree to their plan. This plan is beneficial to us!"</p>

  <p>"As long as we prevent them from taking any action at this moment, Nathan will eventually become a True God."</p>

  <p>"What we only lack is time!"</p>

  <p>Some of the Supreme Lords agreed with Maha's demands, including Supreme Lord of Original Sin. He had put too much effort into cultivating Nathan, so he had a great deal of confidence in him.</p>

  <p>But the other Supreme Lords were against it.</p>

  <p>"This kind of compromise is just futile!"</p>

  <p>"We should counterattack and block them off from the edge of the supreme worlds. And we should not give them any chance to enter the universe!"</p>

  <p>"Pinning our hopes on someone else's kindness is very foolish."</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords held differing opinions on this issue and continuously argued with each other.</p>

  <p>However, the head of the Celestial Position race was silent the whole time. The Supreme Lords, having found it impossible to persuade each other, turned to look at the head of the Celestial Position race.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord of Oracle, Supreme Lord of Original Sin and Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment were on a level with the head of the Celestial Position race. As top-rank Supreme Lords, they carried the Heavenly Destiny which was far more powerful than that of an ordinary Supreme Lord. But the head of the Celestial Position race was more influential in terms of prestige. After all, he was the successor of the Holy Being's disciple.</p>

  <p>Seeing that everyone was looking at him, he said through the life vitality,</p>

  <p>"I think... Have you missed something?"</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords looked at each other, but most of them did not figure out what they had missed.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord of Oracle said, "They are not willing to make a move."</p>

  <p>Master Feng nodded. "Yes. And why are they unwilling to make a move?"</p>

  <p>If the Sacred race truly had absolute strength, Maha wouldn't have brought those Supreme Lords from another universe here to negotiate with them.</p>

  <p>The Sacred race could directly gather True Gods to occupy the supreme worlds one by one.</p>

  <p>Negotiation meant a lack of confidence and strength.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to say that the Sacred race does not dare to fight?"</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord of Original Sin asked.</p>

  <p>"I'm willing to take a gamble," the head of the Celestial Position race nodded.</p>

  <p>There was nothing in this world that they could be absolutely sure of.</p>

  <p>Since the opponent was willing to negotiate, it meant that they did not wish to start an all-out war. Plain and simple.</p>

  <p>Many Supreme Lords continued to think about it, their faces betraying none of their thoughts.</p>

  <p>If they truly agreed to Maha's request, the Sacred race might not comply with their agreement. An all-out war would erupt once the Sacred race was ready for battle.</p>

  <p>After all, the strong would never need to reason with the weak. And by then, it would be too late for regrets.</p>

  <p>But how would they deal with it if an agreement couldn't be reached during the negotiation? What would they do if the Sacred race launched an attack?</p>

  <p>But the head of the Celestial Position race was willing to take a big gamble.</p>

  <p>He believed that the Sacred race wouldn't dare make a move, that Luo Zheng and the others would be able to return from the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, making great progress in cultivation in a short period of time, and that they could become world lords and True Gods, even!</p>

  <p>Once the Supreme Lords had carefully analyzed this matter, they understood that the head of the Celestial Position race was right.</p>

  <p>It would be a shame if they temporarily appeased the Sacred race but ended up dead. They might as well take a gamble right now and stop these people at the edge of the supreme worlds from moving an inch further.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords quickly came to an agreement.</p>

  <p>The head of the Celestial Position race glanced at Maha once again.</p>

  <p>Maha knew that this group of Supreme Lords had reached an agreement, but he still smiled and asked, "So? What about my suggestion?" To him, the humans and the ogres were inferior races.</p>

  <p>These races didn't have a noble purpose of survival. In fact, they would compromise anything and everything in order to survive.</p>

  <p>But Master Feng responded, "There are many races in the universe, and no supreme world is superfluous. I represent all the forces in the universe as I reject your plan."</p>

  <p>Maha's cynical smile disappeared at Master Feng's words. He was cursing him from within, but his voice was calm as he threatened Master Feng. "You have only one chance."</p>

  <p>Everything would have been okay if Maha hadn't made such threatening remarks.</p>

  <p>But at his words, Master Feng and the other Supreme Lords laughed.</p>

  <p>When one became a Supreme Lord, their mental states became stable as steel. Their decision couldn't change that easily.</p>

  <p>Maha's threat had exposed the fact that the Sacred race had not enough confidence and strength.</p>

  <p>Even Luo Zheng and the others saw that the Sacred race was bluffing.</p>

  <p>"We don't need the Sacred race giving us opportunities. You can start a war if you have the guts!" Lawson laughed coldly.</p>

  <p>Of these ten Godly Geniuses, Lawson was the most eccentric. In fact, his character was somewhat similar to Maha's. He couldn't help but mock Maha's long rambling.</p>

  <p>The failure of this negotiation infuriated Maha. His anger only multiplied at Lawson's words. His purple eyes shone with lightning.</p>

  <p>"You are just a Spirit Supreme Realm warrior. How dare you interrupt us like that? I must teach you a lesson on behalf of your elders!" As his voice fell, the lightning in Maha's eyes formed an arc in the air. Before anyone could react, it shot towards Lawson.</p>
