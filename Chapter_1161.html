<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng quietly sat on the golden leaf, his gaze becoming calmer and his mind becoming clearer as time ticked by.</p>

  <p>As of now, he was unable to unleash all his strength because of the limitations on his physical body. Right now, the most urgent thing was to push this limit.</p>

  <p>He pondered over it all. The power that came from the outside world was essentially the same as his own…</p>

  <p>If that was the case, he could transfer his own power.</p>

  <p>After obtaining the will of the world from the little monster, Luo Zheng was able to maintain a connection with everything in the great world.</p>

  <p>It could be a flower, a log, a mountain, or a sea….</p>

  <p>Everything Luo Zheng saw could be linked to him magically. He could connect to things he had never even seen before. This was because the memories of the entire world were firmly stored in Zheng's psyche. He was now the spokesperson for this great world.</p>

  <p>He could feel the origin of the will of this great world. Certainly, he would explore it himself in future, but right now he had more important things to do.</p>

  <p>By transferring the power, Luo Zheng could take on immense strength while causing no damage to his own body, for another entity would replace him and absorb the strength. By the West Dragon River, Luo Zheng had taken on the punch from War Emperor York with the help of the mountains by the river. The vast Feather Holy Sea had helped him block the Heavenly Thunder Halberd from Fredric not so long ago.</p>

  <p>If he used the skill of power transfer, he could take on the power of ten thousand dragon scales, or even the power of one hundred thousand dragon scales. This way, the power that his body was supposed to consume would be borne by other things.</p>

  <p>However, the problem he was currently facing required a different solution.</p>

  <p>He now needed to pour all of his power into this light golden leaf. If he used the skill of power transfer, the power from the dragon scales would be transferred to somewhere else.</p>

  <p>'Transfer...'</p>

  <p>Thinking of this, Luo Zheng tapped his forehead at an important revelation.</p>

  <p>He had been too rigid in his way of thinking. It dawned on him that he could actually use this ability of power transfer in a different manner.</p>

  <p>Seeing Zheng's behavior and his shining eyes, Randy's eyes flashed. He wondered if Luo Zheng had come up with any good ideas.</p>

  <p>Fiona blinked, a smile starting to form at the corner of her mouth. With Zheng's intelligence, he truly might be able to find a way to solve this predicament.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Luo Zheng rose. Standing on the top of the leaf, he took a deep breath.</p>

  <p>"The power of dragon scales!"</p>

  <p>The scales of the cyan dragon on the furnace began to emit a jade-green light once again. The energy from them was like a tidal wave as it rushed into Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>One hundred dragon scales…</p>

  <p>One thousand dragon scales…</p>

  <p>Two thousand dragon scales…</p>

  <p>Three thousand dragon scales...</p>

  <p>Four thousand dragon scales…</p>

  <p>Terrifying power gathered like a whirlpool in Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>In the previous attempt while activating the power of the four thousand dragon scales, he had felt a considerable amount of pressure. Like last time, Zheng's body swelled up once again, growing taller.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't hesitate at all and straightaway activated the power of the five thousand dragon scales.</p>

  <p>Six thousand dragon scales!</p>

  <p>Seven thousand dragon scales!</p>

  <p>Eight thousand dragon scales!</p>

  <p>Nine thousand dragon scales… the number gradually soared.</p>

  <p>Last time when he had activated the power of five thousand dragon scales, Zheng's physical body had neared its limits. It had been impossible to pour any more power into it. Otherwise, his body would have immediately collapsed.</p>

  <p>But this time, it sustained the power of five thousand dragon scales.</p>

  <p>Moreover, this power kept on increasing. He did not suffer any damage.</p>

  <p>"Everyone, look! Under Zheng's feet!"</p>

  <p>"The golden leaf seems to be under a kind of great pressure. It is actually sinking!"</p>

  <p>"What the hell is going on?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was merely standing on the leaf and had made it sink!</p>

  <p>Everyone knew how sturdy and firm the leaf was. Even if a dozen mountains were placed on top of it, they would be unable to break it even a little. But Luo Zheng was able to unleash such power by merely standing on it. Everyone around him was shocked.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes revealed determination and became brighter by the second, as if a pair of stars were embedded in his pupils.</p>

  <p>Ten thousand dragon scales!</p>

  <p>Eleven thousand dragon scales!</p>

  <p>Twelve thousand dragon scales...</p>

  <p>At the beginning, since Luo Zheng had been too eager to find a solution, he had forgotten a special characteristic of the power transfer.</p>

  <p>He had thought that he could not use the power transfer skill to activate more of the power of the dragon scales, for it could only be used to transfer the power he had to take on to other places of the great world.</p>

  <p>But then, another thought struck him.</p>

  <p>Since he could transfer the power to any other place, how about he made the mineral tree take on the power, right on this golden leaf?</p>

  <p>In other words, Zheng's body had only taken on the power of four thousand dragon scales... and the power of the rest of them was diverted to this golden leaf.</p>

  <p>This was the reason why Zheng's body wasn't on the verge of collapse this time, even though he had activated the power of more than ten thousand dragon scales.</p>

  <p>Thirteen thousand dragon scales!</p>

  <p>Fourteen thousand dragon scales!</p>

  <p>All dragon scales had finally been activated by Luo Zheng. The power of ten thousand of them had been fully applied onto this leaf, and the power of the remaining four thousand had stayed inside Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>The golden leaf was steadily sinking. Under such heavy pressure, it was on the brink of collapse and seemed to have reached its limit.</p>

  <p>'It's about time!' Luo Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>At this moment, he once again spread out his legs and began to gather the power in his body into his fists.</p>

  <p>The veins on his arms bulged out like little snakes. This time, Luo Zheng had already used up his full strength. If he could still not shatter this golden leaf… he would not give up.</p>

  <p>If he really failed, he could just ask Fiona to go with him to the arsenal, and he would devour those cursed weapons again.</p>

  <p>At the thought of this, Zheng's fists smashed down on the golden leaf under him.</p>

  <p>The power of the ten thousand dragon scales had already been poured into the leaf. This time, Zheng's forceful energy erupted out. At the same time, the power of four thousand dragon scales inside his body surged forward.</p>

  <p>Bam!</p>

  <p>As his fists hit the golden leaf, a faint crack appeared on its surface.</p>

  <p>A crack!</p>

  <p>Zheng's face broke into a small smile.</p>

  <p>The warriors watching him were stunned.</p>

  <p>"He did it! Tianxing did it!"</p>

  <p>"Oh my god! The golden leaf that nobody could break for so many years has been shattered by Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>"This... Tianxing is too strong!"</p>

  <p>"The Black Star is just a pickaxe, but it's still a supreme divine weapon!"</p>

  <p>"It's a breakthrough. This really is extraordinary…"</p>

  <p>Their faces were full of surprise as various thoughts ran through their heads. However, except for a few people, such as Randy, Fiona, and Camilla, they were unable to contain the envy and jealousy in their hearts. It was almost as if it was their first instinct to feel jealous, like it was something unavoidable.</p>

  <p>Those who had been looking forward to Luo Zheng smashing the golden leaf didn't feel the satisfaction they should have, for they had in fact wished that Luo Zheng would fail. Humans were such contradictory creatures.</p>

  <p>'I'll strike it again!' Luo Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>He bent down once again, both his fists slamming down onto the golden leaf.</p>

  <p>Bam!</p>

  <p>A second crack appeared on the surface of the golden leaf, extending from the bottom of the first crack.</p>

  <p>Things had been tough in the beginning. After the first crack appeared on the golden leaf, it became its weakest point. Luo Zheng didn't let up. He kept hitting the first crack to make it shatter.</p>

  <p>Bang! Boom! Bang…</p>

  <p>Zheng's powerful strikes landed on the golden leaf one after another. More and more cracks became visible.</p>

  <p>At the sight of the cracks, Luo Zheng narrowed his eyes. Waves of life vitality rushed into his trembling fists. Soon after, the waves transformed into specks of starlight that enveloped Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>"Star shakes the earth! Smash to pieces!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng gritted his teeth and threw out his final punch.</p>

  <p>Boom…</p>

  <p>Bang…</p>

  <p>They all heard the sharp, unmistakable sound of a crack. The golden leaf under Zheng's feet cracked from the middle, and at the same time, the stems of the golden leaf broke apart.</p>

  <p>The Black Star pickaxe unveiled itself from beneath the tens of thousands of broken pieces.</p>
