<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1123 The Wrath Of War Emperor York </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Light filtered through Zheng's eyes and he blinked slightly. He had now merged himself with the will of this great world--so in a sense, the massive amount of memories belonged to him now. However, he couldn't fully digest the numerous memories, and could only observe them.</p>

  <p>Searching through memories was an easy task for him. All he had to do was to think about what he wanted to find.</p>

  <p>He filtered through them and not long after, he had found the information about the Soul Nurturing Wood.</p>

  <p>"There really is one! It's in the Divine Kingdom Continent!" Zheng exclaimed. His heart hammered excitedly in his chest.</p>

  <p>Thanks to luck and his talent, he had quickly found a Soul Nurturing Wood.</p>

  <p>It turned out that the Holy Maiden from the York Divine Kingdom was a Holy Maiden of a secret sect. The secret sect could open a channel called the 'Reverse Spirit Channel, ' which was used by the secret sect in the Upper World to constantly send resources to them.</p>

  <p>It was known that the Upper World was extremely rich in resources.</p>

  <p>They were so rich that the things they considered as trash turned into precious treasures when they reached the Lower World.</p>

  <p>As Zheng sifted through the memories, he noticed that the many treasures and materials that passed down the Reverse Spirit Channel had mostly been distributed to the four divine kingdoms!</p>

  <p>Moreover, three blocks of the Soul Nurturing Wood had been passed down through the Reverse Spirit Channel!</p>

  <p>Two of them had been used already. Two souls from two powerful warriors at the Soul Sea Realm had inhabited two blocks of Soul Nurturing Wood. After they had entered the Five Aging Processes, the two Soul Sea Realm masters' lifespans would come to an end.</p>

  <p>Even such powerful warriors couldn't resist the Five Aging Processes. In the end, they had no choice but to abandon their physical bodies and parasitize their souls in the Soul Nurturing Wood.</p>

  <p>Right now, there was still a piece of Soul Nurturing Wood left. However, it was in the hands of War King Wind of the Wind Divine Kingdom.</p>

  <p>The Soul Nurturing Wood had similar effect as the Immortal Mist's crystal ball. Back then, the Immortal Mist had parasitized his soul in the crystal ball, so in that way, he was able to keep his soul alive. War King Wind had also lived for more than ten thousand years, so he might have kept the Soul Nurturing Wood for himself. If he would enter the Five Aging Processes one day, he would be able to parasitize his soul inside the Soul Nurturing Wood.</p>

  <p>A piece of Soul Nurturing Wood was enough for one soul to survive another thousand years.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, Zheng withdrew himself from the memories with a determined look. He must obtain this Soul Nurturing Wood at all costs!</p>

  <p>At that point, Zheng looked at Xun again. Her face was ghostly pale and she looked drained. The dense cracks on the surface of her soul seemed to get bigger. It looked like she wouldn't be able to live through the day.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, I… I'm a bit tired," Xun blinked and whispered. Her usually intimidating crimson eyes were now dim and lifeless.</p>

  <p>Zheng drifted towards her and gently caressed Xun's face. "If you're tired, take a good rest. I'll get the Soul Nurturing Wood for you," Zheng said softly.</p>

  <p>At that same moment on the Sea God Continent, a commotion broke out in the Holy Tree Hall of the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>"Our queen, our queen... What happened to her?!"</p>

  <p>"The queen's statue is getting dimmer and dimmer. It's on the edge of being extinguished!"</p>

  <p>"Could it be that something happened to Zheng? Go and call Amber over!"</p>

  <p>The extinguishment of a queen's statue was definitely a sign of a huge disaster for the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>In fact, it was not only the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place that was in shock. There were thousands of sacred places of the Demon Night across the millions of great worlds, and this phenomenon was felt by all the members of the whole Demon Night. Everyone was rightfully worried.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile in the Upper World, the great worlds controlled by the Demon Night closely watched the changes in the queen's statue as well.</p>

  <p>The Demon Night race controlled many great worlds in the Upper World, and these great worlds were established with three of them as the core. The core three great worlds represented the three queens of the Demon Night race. They were the Dark Demon World, the Heavenly Fox World, and the Blood Night World.</p>

  <p>At that point, a woman in a light blue feathered dress who stood on the star in the center of the Dark Demon World coldly stared at the three queens' statues. Her gaze was fixed in the statue of the Queen of Killings.</p>

  <p>"Hahaha, this little bitch is so stubborn and reluctant to admit defeat. It seems that her days are numbered. I've originally planned to send a few people down Reverse Spirit Channel to kill that guy destined to lead the world of chaos. But now, it looks like I don't have to do anything. It has saved me so much effort!"</p>

  <p>The owner of the malicious voice turned out to be the queen who was in charge of the punishment in the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>Back then, her queen's statue had fought Zheng and was eventually defeated. Later her statue was smashed by Xun. She was also Xun's greatest enemy.</p>

  <p>When she noticed that Xun's statue was getting dimmer by the minute, she knew that Xun's soul was on the verge of collapsing.</p>

  <p>In fact, during their last confrontation, she had known that Xun lived in the body of a man, who was greatly destined to lead the world of chaos. At that time, she felt uneasy with the knowledge. As long as Xun was alive, the Demon Night wouldn't appoint a new Queen of Killings. This fact greatly stressed her out.</p>

  <p>But now, the tables had been turned. She was ecstatic when Xun's statue had dimmed and lost its luster. . .</p>

  <p>After a few moments, Zheng opened his eyes and was greeted by the inside of the enchanted barrier. He felt a sense of familiarity the moment he saw what was in front of him, even if somehow the entire world had changed drastically.</p>

  <p>He felt that everything around him was extremely familiar. With a little bit of thought, he would be able to know every person's faces, names, their past, and even their secrets as long as he wanted.</p>

  <p>Aside from humans, he could even trace back the origins of every tree, leaf, or grain of sand.</p>

  <p>Of course, Zheng wasn't that bored to search for those things.</p>

  <p>When he opened his eyes, the little monster still stood there dumbly like a log. Zheng strode towards him and gently pushed his forehead, then the small body fell onto the ground with a dull thud.</p>

  <p>The mysterious furnace quickly wiped out the little monster's soul. Right now, the little monster was just a walking corpse. No matter how strong his life force was, he wouldn't live for long.</p>

  <p>"Wow! Did you see it? The little monster fell!"</p>

  <p>When the martial artists saw this, they all went into a frenzied uproar.</p>

  <p>"Tianxing won! Tianxing really won! The little monster was knocked out!"</p>

  <p>"That little monster wanted death. He actually used his soul to attack Tianxing. Has he become a simpleton?"</p>

  <p>"Heavens! If that little monster has become a simpleton, the Nine Furnace Martial House wouldn't let Tianxing go."</p>

  <p>In the eyes of the divine-level talents below, the little monster's life wasn't important. No matter what, they wouldn't have the chance to spar with him and absorb his talent.</p>

  <p>Besides, the little monster had always been a hateful creature. Lots of people loathed him, like Fiona. When she saw that Zheng had won, her lips cracked into a smile. She had never killed anyone in her life, but this little monster had been a nightmare to her. Even if he died, she wouldn't even bother to feel pity.</p>

  <p>Many of the divine-level talents felt good, but the faces of the masters at the Soul Sea Realm looked the opposite...</p>

  <p>These powerful warriors of the Soul Sea Realm still waited anxiously for the little monster to enter the Life and Death Realm. Once the little monster reached the Life and Death Realm, his talent would help those said powerful masters, and help them break through the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>Once a martial practitioner reached the Soul Sea Realm, that would probably be their only goal.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng had killed the little monster already!</p>

  <p>Even Turner, who was quiet throughout the fight, looked mad.</p>

  <p>"Zheng! You actually dared to kill this little monster's soul. You're courting death!" an angry voice shouted. War Emperor York trembled with rage.</p>

  <p>He had never been so angry at a young man in his life as the ruler of the York Divine Kingdom.</p>

  <p>Many of the divine-level talents' faces suddenly changed when they saw War Emperor York's furious expression. Even Turner and the other powerful warriors at the Soul Sea Realm watched him apprehensively. It seemed that War Emperor York wanted to challenge Zheng!</p>

  <p>Turner mentally sighed. He regretted it when he didn't tell Zheng not to kill the little monster. Although the little monster was alive in some way, he was still no different from the dead.</p>

  <p>However, Turner and the other powerful warriors of the Soul Sea Realm were also very curious. How did Zheng kill the soul of the little monster?</p>

  <p>They had studied the little monster for so many years, but had never been able to unravel the mystery about him. But, they knew that this little monster was basically an immortal being.</p>

  <p>Not only was the little monster's body indestructible, his soul was also quite special. He emitted a strange light all the time. Even the soul of a Soul Sea Realm master at the Fighting Soul Realm couldn't compare to his soul!</p>

  <p>Thus, how did Zheng kill it?</p>
