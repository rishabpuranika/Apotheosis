  <p>
</p>

  <p>Through the slave seal, Luo Zheng could clearly sense the fear in Francis's heart.</p>

  <p>Since things weren't looking well for them, they started looking terrified. It seemed that some fierce beast had suddenly appeared right before them. As Francis shot up towards the sky, Luo Zheng did so as well.</p>

  <p>In this boundless universe, humans were not considered as the sole rulers.</p>

  <p>Even in the Sea God Continent, there were many different types of intelligent races.</p>

  <p>Also, in this world, the area that the sea occupied far exceeded that of land's. Because of that, the amount of fierce beasts that were inhabiting the sea was tens of thousands of times greater than that of the creatures on land.</p>

  <p>Many of them dwelt in the depths of the vast ocean, and it bestowed upon them richer resources and a wider space to grow and develop. It was more than what land could ever provide for them.</p>

  <p>This reminded Luo Zheng of the time when he had just entered Mist's celestial tomb. When he was on that journey, he encountered high-grade fierce beasts that were comparable to cultivators at the Life and Death Realm. But then, the place where Mist's celestial tomb was situated was not far from Central Region.</p>

  <p>At the center the Chaotic Ocean of Stars, there existed beasts that were comparable to powerful warriors at the Soul Sea Realm. There were even creatures which were more powerful than masters at the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng and Francis were rapidly rising up to the sky, a gigantic black shadow suddenly appeared beneath the vortex!</p>

  <p>As the loud sound of water splashing rang out, Luo Zheng looked back just in time to see a huge creature emerging from the water. Then, without warning, it leapt into the air!</p>

  <p>"What is that?" Luo Zheng asked as he stared at the huge creature behind him. Fear took a hold of his heart.</p>

  <p>The size of this fierce beast was probably not much smaller than that of the Mad Scorpion in the Dark Nether Cave!</p>

  <p>As he was now in the Chaotic Ocean of Stars, which was unimaginably vast, he wasn't as shocked as he had been when he had seen the Mad Scorpion in the Dark Nether Cave.</p>

  <p>'But then again, ' he thought, beads of sweat forming on his forehead. 'This fierce beast is more dangerous than the Mad Scorpion!'</p>

  <p>"This is the Water-eyed Swallowing Beast! The creature is known for its gigantic size, and there are only a total of four of them in the Chaotic Ocean of Stars. We still need to go up!" Francis shouted at Luo Zheng. "If this creature leaps up, it can reach a height of millions of feet!" Truthfully, Francis was unwilling to help Luo Zheng in any way, shape, or form. Right now, running for his life was the most important thing to him. However, as Luo Zheng had planted the slave seal on him, he had no choice but to answer him.</p>

  <p>"Millions of feet? How did you know? Have you encountered this creature before?" Luo Zheng said in a very calm manner. Despite not being as fearful as Francis, he still maintained his high speed as he flew upwards.</p>

  <p>"Of course I know!" Francis shouted back, rolling his eyes. "Everyone in the divine kingdoms knows that. The four divine kingdoms had once sent many powerful masters at the Soul Sea Realm to capture one. They stormed the Chaotic Ocean of Stars as a single force to attempt to capture a young Water-eyed Swallowing Beast. They were successful, yes, but immediately after that, one of the Water-eyed Swallowing Beasts charged all the way to the Divine Kingdom Continent in anger, and it turned a third of the territory of our York Divine Kingdom into ruins before returning to the ocean!" he further explained.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing this, Luo Zheng couldn't help but be speechless.</p>

  <p>The warriors of the four divine kingdoms were virtually crazy. Fierce beasts of that level were definitely not something masters at the Soul Sea Realm would be able to contend with, but they actually dared to enter the Chaotic Ocean of Stars to capture a cub!</p>

  <p>But Francis blew some parts of his story out of proportion. He mentioned that the Water-eyed Swallowing Beast destroyed one third of the York Divine Kingdom's continent, but truthfully, the York Divine Kingdom didn't suffer such a great loss.</p>

  <p>It was just like what Francis had said before, the important cities of the four divine kingdoms were all built around the Feather Holy Sea which was situated at the center of the Divine Kingdom Continent. The areas surrounding the Feather Holy Sea were extremely prosperous. Each divine kingdom occupied a quarter of the Feather Holy Sea's coastlines.</p>

  <p>But in the periphery of the Divine Kingdom Continent, the places were desolate. Even if a third of its land was destroyed, it wouldn't be a great loss to the York Divine Kingdom.</p>

  <p>Despite that, this whole story only proved one thing to Luo Zheng: the martial artists of the four divine kingdoms were even crazier and greedier than he had imagined.</p>

  <p>Ever since the incident with the four divine kingdoms, every time the Water-eyed Swallowing Beasts sensed any trace of a human, they would leap out of the water to attack.</p>

  <p>As Francis and Luo Zheng were talking, the Water-eyed Swallowing Beast had already completely leaped out of the water. It pounced on Luo Zheng and Francis.</p>

  <p>"Up! Up! We still need to go up!" Francis exclaimed anxiously.</p>

  <p>Their figures continued to ascend into the sky. Soon, they broke through the clouds and into the deep sky.</p>

  <p>"This... Can that thing really jump so high?" Luo Zheng asked as he gazed below him. He wanted to see how close the creature was to them but a thick layer of clouds had completely blocked his vision.</p>

  <p>Just as he thought that they were not being pursued anymore, he saw the colossal creature break through the clouds once again and continue to chase after them. Its sudden emergence disturbed the flow of air and even opened up a large hole in the thick clouds!</p>

  <p>"Good heavens! Keep on rising quickly!" Luo Zheng shouted once again, fear now evident in his voice.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng continued his ascent, he suddenly saw huge gusts of wind blowing towards them.</p>
