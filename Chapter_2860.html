</p>

  <p>"Condense more Truth Crystals?"</p>

  <p>No. 9527 had not given any thought to this before.</p>

  <p>Its master was the one in charge of the truth and was free to use it however he desired.</p>

  <p>And as for the Truth Crystal, it was a unique technique that its master had acquired after having observed the energy of the Great Unity in the chaos for a long time.</p>

  <p>Now its master's blood had fused with that of Zheng, and now flowed as one.</p>

  <p>Zheng was the one who had been selected by its master, the only one who had the honor to be chosen to inherit the blood of its master.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 was confident in the theurgies of truth energy, such as the Falling Star Palm. It could easily teach Zheng how to use them, but it had never considered what to do in case he needed to increase the number of Truth Crystals.</p>

  <p>"Hypothetically, the purer your blood, the more Truth Crystals you should be able to condense," pondered No. 9527 aloud. This proposition, even if it were correct, was of little use to Zheng. The only way he could further purify his blood was by absorbing that of the Chaos Ancient God, a feat that was presently impossible. "Luckily, there is a simpler way," said No.9527 quickly, having noticed Zheng's dissatisfied expression. "We would have to obtain and learn the truth rules that lie locked inside the crystal."</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes brightened somewhat as he heard this proposal.</p>

  <p>"The truth rules within the crystal..."</p>

  <p>He lightly tapped the air with his finger, thereby condensing a Truth Crystal again.</p>

  <p>Now, he was faced with a dilemma. He knew how to use the Truth Crystal but did not know why.</p>

  <p>He could condense it, but lacked the knowledge about the nature of the strange energy it contained.</p>

  <p>He recalled the way Nicholas had used the Truth of Dark and Light Chaos, and noted that his method was unfamiliar to him. Frustratingly, Zheng did not know the method by which the Furnace of Dark and Light could be created.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, that did not signify that it was, necessarily, untraceable.</p>

  <p>With enough time to cultivate the Truth of Dark and Light Chaos, he would finally become able to destroy that furnace.</p>

  <p>It was a testament to how complicated the energy of the Truth Crystal was that despite all his gifts and talents, Zheng hadn't yet been able to master it.</p>

  <p>Additionally, as it involved the topmost secret of the chaos, it was verging on impossible to use the Truth Crystal to obtain this knowledge.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, No. 9527 threw up its arms, its eyes widening in realization. "I remember!" it yelled, almost making Zheng jump. "I know of another way! If we cultivate the Ways-blending Energy and reproduce the energy of the Great Unity, we should be able to then cultivate all the truths within the chaos. Haha..." it trailed off, as if in disbelief at itself for not having thought of this earlier.</p>

  <p>Zheng, however, rolled his eyes in exasperation. He knew that No. 9527 was making a joke at his expense. It was nothing new, after all.</p>

  <p>Indeed, all the clues pointed to one conclusion: it was near impossible to obtain more Truth Crystals in the short term. They had to come up with a long-term plan.</p>

  <p>There must be a reason why the Chaos Ancient God left his blood to Zheng. If the Truth Crystal could only be used in this way, it really didn't help Zheng much.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Zheng could keep using the Falling Star Palm to maximize its power.</p>

  <p>If he succeeded in cultivating the Falling Star Palm to the fullest extent, he would be able to channel incredible power using nothing but one Truth Crystal. It had great potential: if he succeeded, this could become a signature move that rendered him invincible.</p>

  <p>Having made his decision, he proceeded to melt the Truth Crystal and absorb its essence into his body.</p>

  <p>Apart from the Falling Star Palm, Zheng also needed to merge more of the Godly Ways together. That, however, was not yet possible, and all he could do was bide his time, waiting for his father to return.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, he became aware of the sound of light footsteps behind him.</p>

  <p>Turning to look, he saw that the grass had been parted, and amidst it, Liusu appeared, clothed in rippling, ephemeral silk.</p>

  <p>"It's time to go home now," she said, her lips curving up into a small smile.</p>

  <p>Usually, no one disturbed Zheng when he practiced here. He knew that Liusu was not here for a trifle. There could only be one reason for her visit. "Has my father returned at last?" asked Zheng breathlessly.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Liusu, nodding. "Your mother returned to the fairy palace with Geoffrey, and they asked me to tell you," she added.</p>

  <p>"Well, what are we waiting for? Let's go!" said Zheng, full of anticipation.</p>

  <p>Without further ado, Zheng approached Liusu, took her hand and together, they set off towards the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>Augustus of the fairy palace was always exceedingly hospitable and generous. Even low-rank True Gods were able to travel freely in the Swirl Forest. The ordinary monsters there would not touch them if they happened to meet. As long as they didn't provoke them, the monsters would stay away, making it a very safe place.</p>

  <p>Before long, Zheng and Liusu had arrived at the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>As soon as they entered, they were greeted by a tall, heavy-set man of middle age. His eyes shone like two marbles, framed by a pair of ebony straight eyebrows. He gave off an air of wisdom and authority. It was Zheng's father, Mike.</p>

  <p>"Father!"</p>

  <p>Zheng greeted him with a broad smile.</p>

  <p>As he observed his father, he couldn't believe that the man he now saw before him was the same man he had seen dying all that time ago.</p>

  <p>The rebirth in the universe was equivalent to giving one a second chance at life. The dead would come back strong, and wiser than before.</p>

  <p>When Zheng had entered, Mike had been talking to Harold while Sword Chen, Hallet and the others stood watching them.</p>

  <p>Mike's eyes lit up with joy as he saw Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng noticed that something was off. "Father, where are my mother and sister?" he asked in a puzzled tone.</p>

  <p>His mother and Joy should have been here, and even Yan had disappeared.</p>

  <p>This was indeed strange.</p>

  <p>Just now, when Zheng was about to open his mouth to speak, Sword Chen gave him a wink. However, it was too late.</p>

  <p>Mike laughed sheepishly. "Your mother has not changed through all those years. Don't worry. I'll talk to her later," he said, looking rather embarrassed.</p>

  <p>Although Mike's explanation might have seemed vague to an outsider, Zheng understood perfectly what he meant.</p>

  <p>Even though Lorena had gone through so much, she still wouldn't allow herself to like Joy.</p>

  <p>After having returned to the fairy palace, Lorena hadn't made things difficult for Joy. Nevertheless, Joy refused to be outshone by her. Zheng had felt the weight of their conflict on the atmosphere of the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>As soon as Augustus sensed the arrival of Zheng's father in the Swirl Forest, he alerted Lorena to it. Without delay, Lorena had proceeded to tell Liusu to, in turn, inform Zheng. After that, she returned to the fairy palace with Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>However, as soon as she had entered the fairy palace, she had seen Joy crying in Mike's arms.</p>

  <p>This scene made Lorena so angry that she turned right around and left, with Yan following in her wake.</p>

  <p>"Not now?" Zheng said with a sly smile.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter," said Mike casually, waving his hand.</p>

  <p>Harold, Sword Chen and the others were obviously struggling to keep their faces straight. They nodded to show their agreement with Mike, while holding back their laughter. Mike was their master, and thus it would be disrespectful to joke with him. It was a privilege that Zheng, as his son, seemed to have.</p>

  <p>In fact, Mike had something important to tell Zheng, so he had chosen not to go after Lorena. It was imperative that he be there when Zheng arrived. "I went back to the Floating Island after I had left the universe," he said to Zheng. "The Holy Being of the Bai Clan let me know that the Floating Island of the Dongfang Clan has been robbed by the Han Clan."</p>

  <p>Zheng and the others all raised their eyebrows in surprise. This was unexpected news. "I suspected that Samuel would take action, but I didn't expect him to be so quick," said Zheng pensively.</p>

  <p>"Really? Why were you suspicious of Samuel? What clue did he give that he might do something of the sort?" Mike asked, flabbergasted.</p>

  <p>He had briefly spoken with Zheng when they were in the Ray Tree. They had been in a great hurry at that time, however, so their exchange had been short and many details had remained unclarified.</p>

  <p>Zheng then recounted the details of the trip to the Abyss Demon Region to his father, not failing to mention Gregorio's miraculous reincarnation.</p>

  <p>Mike remained quite surprised when he finally learned the truth. "Ian told me that Samuel had vowed to reestablish the alliance of powerful clans in the Hall of Holy Beings. The other Holy Beings, naturally, paid no heed to his words because of his lowly rank. To add insult to injury, he was humiliated by Woodruff. His plan had collapsed for the time being," Mike said with a frown.</p>

  <p>"Reestablish the alliance of powerful clans..." repeated Zheng thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>Zheng, Harold and Hallet all exchanged glances, wondering why Samuel had acted as he did.</p>

  <p>Indeed, they would have to fight the Yellow Emperor Guards one day, and the alliance of the powerful clans had been originally established by them.</p>

  <p>It was obvious what Samuel wanted.</p>
