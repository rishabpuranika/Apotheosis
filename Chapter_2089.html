  <p>
</p>

  <p>Wind ruffled through Luo Zheng's matted hair as he raised his head to look at the sky. Another giant star had exploded in the inky sky.</p>

  <p>The star released a blinding light that covered the entire sky the moment it had exploded. The vast expanse of light caught everyone's attention, but they risked getting blind if they had stared too long.</p>

  <p>Once the bright light had dissipated, a dot of star light quickly fell and flew across the sky at an incredible speed, and plummeted towards the Dream Sound World of the Thoughtless Minds.</p>

  <p>"Wynn!" Luo Luo Zheng raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile in the Dream Sound World, the other two Supreme Lords, namely Master Feng and the Grand Supreme Lord of the Sacred race were in the midst of a fierce battle.</p>

  <p>The situation was quite odd--the more the Evolutionary Universe was at a disadvantage, the more powerful Master Feng's Evolution Lotus Flower became. At that moment, Lotus Flowers bloomed continuously in the whole Dream Sound World. They bloomed everywhere from the rocks, the mountaintops, the plains, city walls, and even the pots and stoves and the cyan tiles in the mortals' homes.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, the whole Dream Sound World was like a sea of Lotus Flowers.</p>

  <p>The Sacred Grand Supreme Lord's spinulose wood fern had taken root within the Dream Sound World. Its web of roots continued to spread, and so did the tree itself until it had formed a large, lush forest.</p>

  <p>While Master Feng absolutely had the upper hand against the Sacred Grand Supreme Lord, he could not defeat him in such a short period of time. After all, as long as the Sacred race's momentum existed, the Sacred Grand Supreme Lord wouldn't be defeated.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the constant confrontation of the two caused the whole Dream Sound World to be plummeted into chaos.</p>

  <p>However, the two strongest Supreme Lords in the two universes stopped fighting when the comet-like light fell from the sky.</p>

  <p>Master Feng's face darkened as he saw the scene and said, "Wynn..."</p>

  <p>"Haha, the outcome of the war has already been decided. I'm afraid there is no meaning to our fight anymore!" the Sacred Grand Supreme Lord laughed.</p>

  <p>And so, the war between the two universes and the fights between the Supreme Lords had lost all their meanings. After all, the most important thing was still the battle between the True Gods. Since Wynn had already been defeated, then the victory would be on the side of the Sacred race.</p>

  <p>"All Sacred Supreme Lords, return to my side!" the Sacred Grand Supreme Lord declared through a Roaring Token.</p>

  <p>Just then, all the fighting between the Supreme Lords of the two universes had stopped as well. Suddenly, demonic red space cracks appeared behind the Sacred Grand Supreme Lord and a total of thirteen Sacred Supreme Lords emerged from them.</p>

  <p>The previously rejoicing Grand Sacred Supreme Lord was now appalled to see that only thirteen Supreme Lords survived.</p>

  <p>All in all, they had actually lost ninety percent of their Supreme Lords in this war against the Evolutionary Universe. What a hefty price did they pay!</p>

  <p>On the other hand, streams of Space Law flowed behind Master Feng as the Supreme Lords of the Evolutionary Universe came to him. Soon enough, over 30 Supreme Lords had gathered beside him, including Supreme Lord of Original Sin.</p>

  <p>If only the battle between the Supreme Lords was to be considered, then it could be said that the Evolutionary Universe had completely won.</p>

  <p>However, so many Supreme Lords of the Evolutionary Universe could've been saved if Mateo and Marko hadn't been involved.</p>

  <p>Then again, the Supreme Lords who had survived had also noticed what was happening in the starry sky. They knew that Wynn had probably been defeated, which made them feel even more depressed.</p>

  <p>Even if they had the better advantage in the battles among the Supreme Lords, what use would that be against the Supreme Lords of the Murphy Universe if Wynn was dead?</p>

  <p>"Huff, huff?"</p>

  <p>After quite a while, that comet-like stream of light had finally crashed in the Dream Sound World.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The entirety of the Dream Sound World was split into perfect halves with a violent explosion. A crack that extended tens of billions of miles long ran across the middle and broke the supreme world into two. Master Feng quickly led the Supreme Lords of the Evolutionary Universe to one side of the crack, while the Sacred Grand Supreme Lord and the other Supreme Lords stood on the opposite. The supreme world's floor plates continued to move and the two groups became farther and farther from each other.</p>

  <p>"Is Wynn? alright?" Supreme Lord Rowan of the ogre race asked nervously. While he was only a mid-rank Supreme Lord, he had displayed extraordinary combat abilities in the battle.</p>

  <p>"I'm not sure! True Gods couldn't die that easily," Supreme Lord Amritpal said with a frown.</p>

  <p>All the Supreme Lords thought that once Wynn was dead, then everything was over.</p>

  <p>The two floor plates of the Dream Sound World continued to move further and further away, and the crack in the middle naturally became larger. Even the mountains on both sides of the crack began to collapse.</p>

  <p>When the crack had reached a hundred miles in width, everyone present saw a tiny ball of light emerge from it.</p>

  <p>"Wynn!"</p>

  <p>"It's Wynnl!"</p>

  <p>"He hasn't died yet!</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords shouted in joy, but everything had changed when they finally saw what was inside the ball of light in clear view.</p>

  <p>Wrapped in the ball of light was indeed Wynn, but only his head. The body below his head was nowhere to be seen!</p>

  <p>It wasn't a big deal for True Gods to lose their limbs as they could regrow them with just a thought. The new limbs might not be as good as they were before, but it could be remedied with some secret training.</p>

  <p>However, the head and the cinnabar field were two parts that were indispensable. Losing a head was equivalent to losing a soul, and losing a cinnabar field was like losing the inner world and the Godly Tile within one's body that took eons to nurture.</p>

  <p>Even if Wynn technically wasn't dead--if his cinnabar field had been destroyed, he was as good as nothing.</p>

  <p>"Buzz buzz buzz?"</p>

  <p>A blazing white beam of light suddenly appeared on the side of the ball of light, which rapidly transformed into a human silhouette. After a few moments, Mateo arose from the silhouette.</p>

  <p>Moments ago, the Sacred Supreme Lords had been worried about Mateo's situation.</p>

  <p>After all, the power of the explosion in the starry sky was too overwhelming. The explosion of the star was enough to destroy thousands of supreme worlds. If Mateo hadn't withstood the strike and died, then their efforts wouldn't be worth it.</p>

  <p>Of course, the Sacred Supreme Lords still had a strong advantage. Even if the two True Gods Mateo and Wynn died together, they still had other two True Gods, Marko and Pranav. They could help them deal with the upcoming battles.</p>

  <p>What the Sacred Supreme Lords did not know was that Blayd had already killed the other two True Gods.</p>

  <p>"You old Wynn, you actually destructed your inner world, and turned it into the Star Tribulation Wave. You really wanted to die with me.</p>

  <p>Ahem!" Mateo grinned fiendishly as he spoke. Right after he finished speaking, he coughed twice and streams of black blood spurted out from his mouth.</p>

  <p>It was true that Mateo had won, but not without serious injuries.</p>

  <p>He had the upper hand during the first half of his battle against Wynn.</p>

  <p>However, he had underestimated his opponent.</p>

  <p>Although he was able to suppress Wynn in every aspect, his state of mind couldn't compare to that of Wynn. As Mike's favorite as well as youngest disciple, Wynn already had the resolve to sacrifice himself.</p>

  <p>Thus, his every strike meant to cause absolute destruction on both sides.</p>

  <p>That was also why Mateo had felt that the situation was very tricky.</p>

  <p>In the latter part of their battle, Wynn had lured Mateo straight into the star maze that he had set up beforehand. After that, he detonated the inner world in his body and launched a desperate attack, known as the "Star Tribulation Wave".</p>

  <p>In turn, Mateo had used the Wheel Swirl technique in that critical moment to guard his own body and stood the "Star Tribulation Wave" by force. Therefore, he had ended up with numerous injuries.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>A splitting sound was heard when Mateo loosely grabbed at the air and the ball of light landed in his hand.</p>

  <p>"No, stop!"</p>

  <p>A sharp gust of wind blew as Master Feng appeared beside the ball of light in a flash, in an attempt to snatch the ball of light from Mateo.</p>

  <p>"Who do you think you are? Get out of here!"</p>

  <p>Mateo was furious at the sudden intrusion and threw a punch. Master Feng felt as if he had been struck by lighting and a fist imprint appeared on his chest. He fell backwards like a kite with its string suddenly cut, then collided into the edge of the broken supreme world and shattered a mountain range in the process.</p>

  <p>When the other Supreme Lords who originally planned to wait for a chance to take action saw the scene, they gave up their ideas. The gap between them and Mateo was far too big.</p>

  <p>The ball of light finally ended up in Mateo's hands, and his lips curled into a sinister smile. He gently pinched the surface of the ball of light, which shattered like an eggshell. His hands grabbed Wynn's decapitated head and lifted it up for all of them to see.</p>

  <p>"Hahaha! I didn't expect you to be so troublesome, to the point that I had to use my Wheel Swirl technique! You old fellow, how do you feel right now? Would you like to share it with the followers of your master?"</p>

  <p>Once the words died on Mateo's mouth, he turned Wynn's head to the side and made it face the Supreme Lords of the Evolutionary Universe.</p>
