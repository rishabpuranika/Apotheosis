<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The stage ruler's several attacks failed. What was worse, his tongue was injured by the two people in the distance.</p>

  <p>His head that had been bobbing on the surface of the black marsh till just now suddenly rose as he climbed out of the marsh.</p>

  <p>Only then did Yan and Natalie realize how big this stage ruler actually was.</p>

  <p>"Those monkeys were right. They do have some skills." The stage ruler cocked his head to the side to look at the two trembling girls. "They're trying to save you, aren't they?"</p>

  <p>Yan tried to say something, but she was too struck with fear.</p>

  <p>Stretching out his huge claw, the stage ruler tried to reach for Yan and Natalie.</p>

  <p>The two thought that the stage ruler was going to kill them, so they shut their eyes tight. However, much to their surprise and relief, the claw grabbed the trap array and the soil under their feet. Carefully, the stage ruler tossed them onto his back.</p>

  <p>"He... He doesn't plan to kill us?" Natalie cried incredulously.</p>

  <p>Yan's eyes were trained on the two mysterious figures. "He's not interested in us. He's interested in the ones flying over there!"</p>

  <p>The two figures in the distance had suddenly launched themselves into the air, flying towards them at an incredible speed.</p>

  <p>Yan squinted. She couldn't tell who the other one was but she recognized the woman. She was Feng Ge from the Taiyi Heaven Palace!</p>

  <p>Yan and Natalie had seen her before in the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>Back then, Feng Ge didn't perform well in the Chaotic Source World. Yet now she was able to have a physical body on the Other Shore, and even her appearance could be seen clearly.</p>

  <p>"Is she the purified being?" Natalie blurted out.</p>

  <p>"I suppose so. But who is the other person?" Yan pondered.</p>

  <p>Back in the Chaotic Source World, Feng Ge had been following her brother the whole time. It was very likely her companion was no other than Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Narrowing her eyes at the indistinct figure, Yan realized the shape and movement were familiar. "Luo Zheng..." she said softly.</p>

  <p>"Hahaha..."</p>

  <p>As the two figures in the distance steadily approached, the stage ruler crawled on the ground, cracking his mouth wide open and laughing maniacally.</p>

  <p>The laughter echoed in the black marsh like dull thunder. The poisonous creatures that lurked in the black marsh panicked and fled everywhere.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng saw the huge monster in the distance, he frowned slightly.</p>

  <p>It turned out that the purified being of Stage Fourteen was actually a huge lizard!</p>

  <p>Upon seeing the huge lizard, Luo Zheng scanned the area. Finally, his gaze landed on the two faint human figures on his back. Even if he was far away, Luo Zheng was sure that they were two Souls of Light.</p>

  <p>'Yan...' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>A trace of anger welled up inside him, and he sped up.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge, who had been flying next to him, felt his change in behavior.</p>

  <p>Obviously, Luo Zheng was worried about his sister most. Feng Ge raised her eyebrow, deep in thought.</p>

  <p>In a matter of seconds, the two of them finally landed in front of the giant lizard.</p>

  <p>"Haha..."</p>

  <p>The stage ruler's muffled laughter finally ceased once the two landed in front of him. Stretching out a long, scaly claw to point at Feng Ge, he hissed,</p>

  <p>"Are you the purified being the monkeys mentioned?"</p>

  <p>Feng Ge looked at the stage ruler coldly but said nothing.</p>

  <p>Although the stage ruler's appearance was different from hers, she could still feel a sense of familiarity from him. This familiar feeling indicated to her that the stage ruler was the same as her.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge frowned deeply. How could such an ugly thing be her own kind?</p>

  <p>"Answer me!"</p>

  <p>The originally calm stage ruler suddenly became irritable.</p>

  <p>He was the ruler of Stage Fourteen. The creatures from the Dark Region and the Light Region didn't dare to ignore him.</p>

  <p>But Feng Ge was completely indifferent to him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, who stood in front of Feng Ge, pointed at the back of the stage ruler.</p>

  <p>"The black monkeys are using my sister as bait. If you don't want to be mindlessly manipulated by the black monkeys, please just let them go."</p>

  <p>The moment Luo Zheng spoke, Yan gasped softly. Natalie was also pleasantly surprised. It was really Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>The stage ruler's eyes swept over Luo Zheng's figure. Feng Ge was a purified being, but Luo Zheng was not. However, this was the man who had hurt his tongue, which puzzled him.</p>

  <p>"The black monkeys want to use me to kill your sister..." the stage ruler echoed.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Luo Zheng nodded. "Please don't be fooled by those monkeys."</p>

  <p>"Those ugly monkeys can't fool me!" Pointing his claw at Feng Ge, the stage ruler smiled. "I will release the two Souls of Light if you give her to me.</p>

  <p>What do you think?"</p>

  <p>When Feng Ge heard this, she sneered. Luo Zheng, on the other hand, remained calm. "What if I don't agree?"</p>

  <p>"Then all of you will have to stay." The stage ruler opened his big mouth and made a muffled, guttural sound. Now, he was interested in not only Feng Ge, but also Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The scales on his huge body suddenly spread out, and thousands of colors blossomed from the edges of the scales.</p>

  <p>The lights that the lizard released were not just in white, but in many other colors.</p>

  <p>The originally dark and lifeless swamp suddenly came to life, illuminated in colors. It was like the first breeze in spring, gently nudging the sleeping nature to an awakened state.</p>

  <p>The lights couldn't hurt Yan, Natalie, Luo Zheng, and Feng Ge, but they were fatal to the other creatures in the swamp.</p>

  <p>Everything that came into contact with the lights all turned into nothingness.</p>

  <p>What was even more terrifying was that all the creatures in the marsh seemed to be drawn towards the colorful lights. Snakes that were more than ten thousand feet long, crocodiles lying in the depths of the marsh, bugs in the shadows... All the creatures rushed towards the lights for some reason, only to be gruesomely annihilated.</p>

  <p>Then, it dawned on Luo Zheng. The creatures were actually sacrificing themselves!</p>

  <p>"The stage ruler is really powerful..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng muttered, tightening his grip on the javelin he was holding.</p>

  <p>Not long after Feng Ge became a purified being, her strength far surpassed that of any ordinary creature on the Other Shore. Even the creatures in the Dark Region were no match for her.</p>

  <p>The stage ruler in front of him was an ancient monster that had lived for countless years. His understanding of himself, the Other Shore, and the Great Sanskrit Light was not something that Feng Ge could compare with.</p>

  <p>The stage ruler threw his head back, unleashing a thunderous roar.</p>

  <p>Then, his sharp claw swung out to try to reach for Luo Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng saw this coming. Reflexively, he flew to the side like a ghost.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>After the claw smashed into the marsh, ripples quivered across its surface and spread out in all directions.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng leaped high into the air to dodge the stage ruler's blow. A sharp light flashed in his eyes, and he threw the javelin in his hand, aiming at the spot in between the stage ruler's eyes.</p>
