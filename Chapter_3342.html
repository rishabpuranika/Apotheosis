  <p>
</p>

  <p>Only one primitive land was usually formed in each round of chaos.</p>

  <p>Each round of chaos had only one Source World in the early stages.</p>

  <p>But as the Other Shore was created, more and more races entered it before the chaos could be destroyed. As the gathered powers on the Other Shore became more and more complicated, so did the chaos.</p>

  <p>The chaos often had several primitive lands in the later stages.</p>

  <p>The Source World and the Ruin Graveyard were among these primitive lands.</p>

  <p>Only, the Ruin Graveyard was far smaller in size when compared with the huge Source World.</p>

  <p>All the tombstones that Luo Xiao and the others had come across had been as large as the divine land. In all, there were a total of eighty-seven tombstones of this size in the Ruin Graveyard.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the Ruin Graveyard had already been large enough in the eyes of those from the divine land.</p>

  <p>These eighty-seven tombstones were home to different races, among which humans had the largest influence.</p>

  <p>At Bromley's explanation, one of the Holy Beings remarked proudly,</p>

  <p>"Humans are the spirit of all gods. It's no surprise that they are the strongest!"</p>

  <p>Chiyou, himself a human, had created the divine land. All other creatures within it, whether intelligent or not, were inferior to humans. These Holy Beings had never left the divine land, which was why they were under the impression that this was the case everywhere.</p>

  <p>Bromley shook his head in disagreement at the Holy Being's words. "No, it's not like that."</p>

  <p>Ramzi nodded and said, "Humans aren't top forces in the Source World, but they have improved a lot these past few years. Some races are born strong, and humans aren't as powerful as them."</p>

  <p>Bromley looked carefully at Ramzi and then asked, "Are you from the Source World?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am," Ramzi replied, folding his hands and bowing to Bromley.</p>

  <p>"Ramzi is a Nine Li Guard. The divine land can be safe thanks to them,"</p>

  <p>Luo Xiao said as way of introducing him to Bromley.</p>

  <p>Ramzi and Bromley nodded to each other. Ramzi then asked, "Who created this primitive land?"</p>

  <p>"Another force of the human race," Bromley replied.</p>

  <p>"What?" Ramzi was surprised at this answer. He stiffened, his renewed vigilance visible in his stance.</p>

  <p>These Holy Beings were born in the divine land but they couldn't claim to be descendants of the Nine Li race. Things would become complicated if the human force that Bromley had mentioned turned out to be the Bearing race or the Divine Farmer race.</p>

  <p>"As far as I know, there are only four orthodox human forces in the chaos.</p>

  <p>The Nine Li race, the Taiyi Heaven Palace, the Bearing race, and the Divine Farmer race. Which one of them created the Ruin Graveyard?" Ramzi asked.</p>

  <p>Bromley shook his head, an unfathomable smile on his lips, and replied,</p>

  <p>"None of them. You may have misunderstood something. The race that could obtain a primitive land would not be born in this chaos."</p>

  <p>Ramzi's eyes widened. "Do you mean a civilization on the Other Shore?</p>

  <p>They are humans?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Ramzi had heard about the Chaos Ancient Gods and the civilizations on the Other Shore from Timotheus. He didn't know much about them, but given the information he learned, he could roughly guess it.</p>

  <p>But Luo Xiao and other Holy Beings were confused.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng had left the divine land, the Holy Beings there had the opportunity to break through and enter the Other Shore Realm. They were all cultivating the Truth of Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>But only Joy and Estelle had succeeded in entering the Sea of Truth while the other Holy Beings were still painstakingly chanting the Truth of Divine Dao. It was probably because of their bad compatibility with the Truth of Divine Dao that they were making such slow progress.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Bromley nodded cautiously. "This particular human force used to be splendid. It was once the ruling civilization of the 77th chaos. It is a powerful civilization even on the Other Shore."</p>

  <p>Bromley's amazing feat in cultivation in the Ruin Graveyard was attributed to his extraordinary talent and the preferential treatment that the human race in the Ruin Graveyard had given him. After all, they were all human.</p>

  <p>The other Holy Beings drew a collective sigh of relief at this piece of information.</p>

  <p>They had thought that it would be a disaster for the divine land to sink into the Ruin Graveyard. But it no longer seemed to be a problem.</p>

  <p>"What will they do to the divine land?" Luo Xiao asked, putting everyone's concerns into words.</p>

  <p>Bromley thought for a while before answering, "They have been looking for their spokespersons among the eighty-seven tombstones. And now that the divine land is here, even if by mistake, they will probably include it in their searches."</p>

  <p>"Spokespersons?" Holy Jay looked confused. He knew little about this.</p>

  <p>Bromley nodded. "Sooner or later, there will be a fierce battle in the chaos.</p>

  <p>They need to first choose a few spokespersons from among the humans.</p>

  <p>And the divine land has a large number of humans, so it would prove to have some great choices if it were to join in the selection."</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings looked confused at his explanation. "There are many humans in the divine land but they are at a low cultivation level. Can they be selected?" one of them asked. "If we do join the selection, would the humans in this graveyard also support us?"</p>

  <p>Once Luo Zheng had left, a crazy rush had erupted within the divine land to comprehend the Truth of Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>Many consummate True Gods, Demi-holy Beings, and Holy Beings were struggling to comprehend the Truth of Divine Dao. But it was too difficult for anybody to comprehend it easily. They couldn't even step into the threshold without a good compatibility with it. But it would be of great help if they could get the support from the Ruin Graveyard. That was what the great clans in the divine land had long desired.</p>

  <p>These clans didn't care where the divine land was going. They only wanted it to remain immortal.</p>

  <p>Bromley smiled faintly. "Of course they will. I can assure you of this."</p>

  <p>Now that Bromley was an important figure in the Ruin Graveyard, he could easily provide them with the cultivation resources that they needed.</p>

  <p>The discussion regarding the current situation of the divine land went on for a while before Bromley asked Luo Xiao, "How is Estelle? Has she come out of the Immortal Mansion?"</p>

  <p>She had been locked in the Immortal Mansion for a long time because of her extra-strong personality.</p>

  <p>Bromley had had no choice in the past but he knew he still cared about her.</p>

  <p>"When I went to the Soul Wilderness and begged her to help me, she asked me to find you. And I think I've fulfilled my promise now. I made it!" Holy Jay said, a meaningful smile on his face.</p>

  <p>Bromley's eyes lit up at Holy Jay's words. "I'll go back to the divine land with you!" he said excitedly.</p>

  <p>He led the way and the other Holy Beings followed close behind.</p>

  <p>They emerged from the crack and headed straight for the divine land.</p>

  <p>Bromley was born in the divine land, so he wouldn't be blocked by the divine land's Heavenly Mirror Shield. The moment he entered the divine land, he activated his Grand Teleportation and rushed to the Floating Islands above the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>It looked like a significant change had taken place on the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>Only a few Floating Islands of great clans like the Gu Clan and the Luo Clan remained above the Time Sea. The huge central Floating Island stood still.</p>

  <p>When the divine land had accidentally entered the Ruin Graveyard, all the warriors of the divine land had been utterly shocked.</p>

  <p>They were waiting nervously for latest news on the central Floating Island.</p>

  <p>Among them were Harold, Hallet, Augustus and Estelle.</p>

  <p>One universe of the divine land had collapsed not long after the Holy Beings had left. It was proof that the Ruin Graveyard was evil.</p>

  <p>As these warriors waited, a middle-aged man appeared in the sky above the central Floating Island. Hallet and Augustus were dumbfounded when they saw who he was.</p>
