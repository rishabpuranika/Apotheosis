<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>When he saw the tremendous energy currents rushing towards him, Zheng was suddenly struck with an idea.</p>

  <p>These currents contained the internal momentum of the consummate stage.</p>

  <p>Zheng had planned to visit all the Godly Way Tablets but apparently, he couldn't do it any time soon.</p>

  <p>Every theurgy at the consummate level was powerful and couldn't be underestimated since it might play an important role in the future. There was no way he was going to pass up this opportunity.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>Two golden rings appeared at the edge of his pupils.</p>

  <p>Over twenty light dots on the Infinity Ruler in his mind were also instantly ignited.</p>

  <p>"The consummate level theurgy of the Five Elements Godly Way ..."</p>

  <p>"The consummate level theurgy of the Spiritual Wind Godly Way..."</p>

  <p>"The consummate level theurgy of the Earth Godly Way..."</p>

  <p>"The consummate level theurgy of the Murdering Godly Way..."</p>

  <p>The extremely consummate internal momentum formed marks on the Godly Tile in Zheng's inner world through the Infinity Ruler.</p>

  <p>"I don't have enough time..."</p>

  <p>He absorbed the Godly Ways at a fast rate but he had only gone through half before the energy currents surrounded him.</p>

  <p>"Divine Five Elements Body!"</p>

  <p>Zheng employed the theurgy belonging to the Five Elements Godly Way at the consummate level.</p>

  <p>The Magnetic Sacred Mountain he had discovered in the Lower World also gathered the power of the five elements which made it really solid.</p>

  <p>The Divine Five Elements Body mixed the Indestructible Metal Godly Way, the Earth Godly Way, the Parting Water Godly Way, the Elementary Fire Godly Way and the Cyan Wood Godly Way altogether.</p>

  <p>However, this combination was not like the one in the Magnetic Sacred Mountain. Instead, it was a theurgy produced through the comprehension of the Five Elements Godly Way.</p>

  <p>Five colors burst forth on his skin, making his body extremely strong.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>Zheng let the energy currents wash over him and he readily absorbed the internal momentum inside them...</p>

  <p>The huge mass of energy currents shrank as Zheng absorbed them, which made some of the consummate True Gods smile.</p>

  <p>Some people mocked Rachelle in their minds. Despite being so powerful, she was still only a woman.</p>

  <p>Zheng was not powerful at all, and they surely didn't need to wait for Troy to deal with him.</p>

  <p>It would surely be enough to kill him by having everyone attack at the same time.</p>

  <p>"He's just a consummate True God. Why should so many people have to fight him together? Don't take him so seriously!"</p>

  <p>"The Holy Beings ordered us to capture him, right? Now, he's sure to die!"</p>

  <p>These consummate True Gods looked relaxed but Rachelle, Shahn, Walton, and Troy showed no expressions on their faces.</p>

  <p>Since Zheng was able to control the jade seal, it wouldn't be that easy to kill him.</p>

  <p>Troy stared at the mass of energy currents with caution.</p>

  <p>They had begun to decrease rapidly and left a huge smoke cloud behind as they disappeared.</p>

  <p>"He's not dead yet," Troy muttered, sensing Zheng's existence through the smoke. "By using the jade seal, he's able to erase time just for a tiny bit.</p>

  <p>During those few seconds, he's basically immortal. Not even a Holy Being would be able to do anything against him. However, what will he do after that? Would he still be able to dodge?"</p>

  <p>Troy did not attack Zheng with the others earlier. He was cunning and waited for the right time to do so.</p>

  <p>"Indestructible Metal Hand!"</p>

  <p>"Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh..."</p>

  <p>The iron hand rapidly swelled.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, it reached the size of a huge mountain and reached out to grab the smoke cloud.</p>

  <p>Troy's behaviour made the other consummate True Gods curious.</p>

  <p>Since Zheng was trapped by the turbulent energy currents, it would be extremely hard for him to escape. In fact, they figured that these currents would be enough to cut him into pieces and kill him.</p>

  <p>What was Troy's point in taking action?</p>

  <p>As Troy's huge, iron hand was about to grab the smoke cloud, a huge fist suddenly appeared!</p>

  <p>"Clang!"</p>

  <p>There was a deafening thud as this huge fist suddenly crashed into Troy's palm.</p>

  <p>It was as if two, huge mountains had bumped into each other.</p>

  <p>Troy's Indestructible Metal Hand was the consummate theurgy comprehended from the Indestructible Metal Godly Way.</p>

  <p>He refined his right hand for countless years and consumed countless of the Dongfang Clan's resources.</p>

  <p>The power contained within his iron hand was so terrifying that even a Demi-holy Being would be cautious when faced against it.</p>

  <p>He had already thought that Zheng's jade seal would enable him to avoid most of the consummate True Gods' attacks. However, Zheng was unable to dodge his attack.</p>

  <p>His attack seemed to be enough to crush Zheng into pieces.</p>

  <p>However, the resistance that met his iron hand surprised Troy greatly.</p>

  <p>Where did this huge fist come from?</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the huge force transmitted back from his iron hand, which made him even more confused.</p>

  <p>It was so powerful that he was driven backwards!</p>

  <p>His iron hand was the size of a mountain but his body was not even six feet tall. The sight of Troy getting dragged away by his huge hand was a bit funny to look at.</p>

  <p>However, nobody paid attention to him.</p>

  <p>All the consummate True Gods' attention was focused on the smoke cloud that was now slowly fading away.</p>

  <p>From the smoke emerged a huge silhouette.</p>

  <p>Zheng had activated the Wild God Power in his body and had transformed into a forty thousand feet tall giant. He merely looked down on the crowd from his place in the sky.</p>

  <p>These consummate True Gods were mere ants compared to Zheng in terms of size.</p>

  <p>"What, what's this?"</p>

  <p>"How did his body become so huge?"</p>

  <p>"What a powerful force! How did he make it?"</p>

  <p>"He is even stronger than a Holy Being in terms of physical strength."</p>

  <p>Those present were dumbfounded at the sight of Zheng's giant form.</p>

  <p>The pressure of the Wild God Power emanated from Zheng in waves and was felt by the consummate True Gods around him.</p>

  <p>These consummate True Gods had never seen the Wild God Power before and mistook it as the power of pure strength. Even a Holy Being wouldn't normally be able to create such an imposing aura when activating the Nine Divine Stars.</p>

  <p>Tianming couldn't help but raise his eyebrows. He was standing at a distance but was still extremely overwhelmed by this surprising scene.</p>

  <p>He knew Zheng was imaginative but he never thought he would actually be able to become a literal giant.</p>

  <p>Never had he heard of such great theurgy. After Zheng transformed into a giant, his strength increased greatly and such level of skill simply amazed Tianming.</p>

  <p>'Where in the world did he cultivate such an ability?' Tianming thought to himself.</p>

  <p>"Anyone who dares stop me will get killed immediately," Zheng threatened coldly.</p>

  <p>His manner of speaking was gentle but his tone was extremely serious.</p>

  <p>His voice was also terribly loud and it made the consummate True Gods' ears buzz.</p>
