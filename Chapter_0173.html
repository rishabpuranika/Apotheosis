<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 173 Battle In The Sky Forest (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As the sun crossed the horizon, the disciples prepared for another day of demon hunting.</p>

  <p>The relief the disciples felt at having had an uneventful night was overshadowed by their fear and doubt. For a long time, only demon soldiers were seen in Sky Forest, which was the reason why the Sky Forest had become hunting ground for the disciples of Cloud Sect. The inner disciples could easily kill low-level demon soldiers, as these soldiers were simple-minded and not very strong.</p>

  <p>But a demon general was more powerful than a demon soldier. And if demon generals were in Sky Forest, then all the disciples of Cloud Sect would become their prey.</p>

  <p>Yesterday, Luo Zheng's team was not the only team to encounter a demon general. Disciples of Lady Peak had also come across one. Such a coincidence was rare and indicated that the number of demon generals in Sky Forest was far more than estimated.</p>

  <p>It was common knowledge that it was relatively challenging for a demon general to sneak into and remain undetected in Sky Forest. The absence of the danger posed by demon generals in Sky Forest was one of the reasons why Cloud Sect selected the forest as the training place for its disciples.</p>

  <p>But this year, the number of demon generals in the forest was beyond anyone's expectation. What drove them to the forest in such large numbers?</p>

  <p>Although each of the disciples from Lady Peak and Drizzle Peak pondered over this anomaly, none could come up with a feasible answer.</p>

  <p>After all, White Emperor City formed a solid line of defense against the demons in the Shura Battlefield. How could these demon generals break through the defense line and sneak into Sky Forest?</p>

  <p>Was something wrong in White Emperor City?</p>

  <p>Needless to say, the disciples had many questions and doubts in their hearts and could not get answers or solutions. Thus, their concerns added to the anxiety they were already feeling.</p>

  <p>They could not sleep well at night. When the sun rose, shafts of bright sunlight filtered through the green canopy and lit up the forest. The disciples collected their vitality, put out the fire, and continued on their way.</p>

  <p>Although everyone was worried and tired, no one chose to give up.</p>

  <p>Besides, at this time, even if they wanted to give up, they needed to return along the same path. No one could guarantee that they would not encounter a demon on the way back.</p>

  <p>Without another alternative, disciples of Drizzle Peak and Lady Peak decided to keep each other company and moved forward as per the original routing.</p>

  <p>Since both peaks had encountered demon generals the day before, they proceeded with caution today. To prevent a demon general from lurking in the team by shielding under human skin, the disciples would act in groups. And every hour, Nina would test everyone with her Demon-revealing Needle.</p>

  <p>In this way, they walked safely for around four hours. Suddenly, they heard a shout coming from ahead.</p>

  <p>Then came the sound of explosions.</p>

  <p>"There is a fight ahead!" Based on the noise, Cleve, who was walking in front of the team, surmised. He drew his sword from its scabbard as he prepared to join the battle. His previously relaxed expression now became serious. Without further delay, he instructed the team to get ready for battle.</p>

  <p>On hearing the command, all disciples clenched their weapons firmly, regrouped to two teams by gender, and dashed toward the source of the explosion. They did not know who were fighting in the front, but they thought that this could be a battle between disciples of Cloud Sect and the demons.</p>

  <p>When they moved closer, they could see what was happening in the forest. Their assumption was correct. The disciples of Cloud Sect were fighting fiercely with demons. For a time, the evil spirit being released by the several demons quickly dissipated the life vitality of the refiners.</p>

  <p>The evil spirit clashed with the life vitality, and the impact left the trees and grass around in chaos.</p>

  <p>In the center of the battle, a young man with a black sword and a white sword in his hands attracted their attention.</p>

  <p>Both his swords were simple in shape and forged in classic style. One was black, and one was white. They looked sharp in the young man's hands, as life vitality covered their blades. The young man swung his swords and generated layers of bright lights that bombed the area around him. He was fighting a demon general by himself, running neck-to-neck with his rival.</p>

  <p>"Ah, he is Lenard Zhu! Lenard from Skytop Peak!" Nina murmured when she saw the young man.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng also noticed this young man from a distance. This inner disciple, Lenard Zhu, had remarkable strength among the disciples present. At the fifth grade of the nature level, Lenard could battle a demon general alone and had not been defeated so far. It was thus established that he was the most outstanding disciple.</p>

  <p>There were many reasons why Skytop Peak was ranked the highest among the thirty-three peaks at Cloud Sect. One of those reasons was the outstanding abilities of its disciples.</p>

  <p>It was uncommon for a peak to dispatch its best disciples during the trial to slay demons. But, Lenard from Skytop Peak was present this year.</p>

  <p>What was more surprising was that he was confronting a demon general by himself. That already showed the advantages of Skytop Peak over the other peaks.</p>

  <p>Even with superior strength, the disciples of Skytop Peak were not fairing too well against the demons, as they were fighting two demon generals and dozens of demon soldiers.</p>

  <p>Besides Lenard who was fighting one demon general, another three inner disciples were withstanding the attacks from a second demon general.</p>

  <p>Even though the three refiners were together, they could not match their rival and were struggling to keep the balance. If the demon general killed any one of them, the balance of victory and defeat would tilt. The situation was very dangerous for these disciples.</p>

  <p>"Let's go and help them!" After saying these words, Cleve rushed into the battlefield and aimed his sword at one demon soldier. He summoned his life vitality, which enveloped the blade of his sword, thus making it glitter in the morning light.</p>

  <p>The other disciples of Lady Peak and Drizzle Peak also ran toward the fight against the demon soldiers.</p>

  <p>In previous trials, disciples would not intervene in a battle between disciples and demon soldiers as the situation was not dangerous enough to warrant interference.</p>
