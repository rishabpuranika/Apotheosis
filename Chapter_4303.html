  <p>
</p>

  <p>At that moment, the masters who gathered on the jadeite platform had dispersed and stood in different locations.</p>

  <p>The Troubled creatures were not that strong, but once they acquired the Hyperspace Extreme Form, the creatures from the third-grade world stood no chance against them.</p>

  <p>But there was a catch: once they lost the Hyperspace Extreme Form, they would get significantly weaker.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, a wisp of sword light that was as thin as hair continued to wander around.</p>

  <p>It was powerful, albeit restless. It could cut a Troubled Creature that came into contact with it in half. What was more amazing was that there were dozens of such sword lights.</p>

  <p>Tianming sat cross-legged by the end of the sword lights, and the Lone Sword stood in front of him.</p>

  <p>When he had first obtained the Lone Sword, he tried to learn more brilliant sword skills to use his sword to its maximum potential.</p>

  <p>However, after its merge with the Sunlight Annihilation Light, Kincaid gave him some advice which enlightened him and changed his views about some things.</p>

  <p>For instance, he realized that he did not have to spend too much time studying swordsmanship, spear skill, or blade skills.</p>

  <p>Generally, those who had reached a certain level in this field and possessed more energies that they were skillful enough to use would be the great masters.</p>

  <p>Therefore, it was useless to attach too much importance to the techniques or intents.</p>

  <p>Zheng had realized that when he merged with the Other Shore Tokens in the Source World. Although Tianming had fused with all kinds of powerful Other Shore Tokens, he lacked actual combat experiences. The latter only became aware of it much later than Zheng did.</p>

  <p>"The Sunlight Annihilation Light is indeed sharp and powerful. It's a useful tool to terminate so many Troubled Creatures, but the energy of the Destruction Extreme Form is too much…" Tianming muttered to himself.</p>

  <p>He looked around with fear in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Every time he took out a Troubled Creature, a purple light ball emerged from it.</p>

  <p>The energy of the Destruction Extreme Form inside the purple light ball was overwhelming.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Tianming figured that even the amount of energy he would obtain through burning ten Other Shore Tokens was less than that of the purple light ball.</p>

  <p>If he destroyed hundreds of Troubled Creatures, hundreds of purple light balls would appear.</p>

  <p>The mere thought of it sent him into a flurry of panic.</p>

  <p>He tried to break the purple light ball with the Sunlight Annihilation Light, but the sharp sword light only touched the purple light ball, then vanished into it. Even the amount of energy in a Holy Item was far less than that of the purple light ball.</p>

  <p>The only thing that made him slightly relieved was that the purple light balls descended quite slowly. It would take them quite a while to reach the Pear Hill.</p>

  <p>"Boom! Boom!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly, large Eight Diagrams shadows exploded in the air, and Fuxi's palm crushed dozens of Troubled Creatures in the process.</p>

  <p>Plop! Plop! Plop! Plop!</p>

  <p>After the Troubled Creatures had died, they turned into purple light balls and slowly came down.</p>

  <p>Just as his head ached because of the purple light balls and did not know what to do, he looked up, and what he saw surprised him.</p>

  <p>Thousands of purple light balls had appeared above his upper left side, and a figure floated among them. Although he could not see it clearly, he could tell that it was Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>Then, Geoffrey punched the Troubled Creatures.</p>

  <p>He used thirty percent of his strength for this attack.</p>

  <p>Afterward, a fan-shaped wave spread out in front of him.</p>

  <p>All the Troubled Creatures covered by the fan-shaped wave got pulverized and turned into purple light balls.</p>

  <p>Once Geoffrey had dealt with the Troubled Creatures around him, he went past the purple light balls and targeted another group of Troubled Creatures. Once again, he destroyed them with a punch.</p>

  <p>Since he had chosen the most efficient method to clear up the Troubled Creatures around his area, there were far more purple light balls in his surroundings than in the other places.</p>

  <p>"We have to stop!" Fuxi shouted.</p>

  <p>Kincaid, Hilario, the Snake Goddess, and the others tried to wipe out all the Troubled Creatures. When they heard Fuxi's call, they slowed down.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess's eyes flashed with confusion. "What's wrong?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Those purple light balls will destroy Pear Hill!" Fuxi answered.</p>

  <p>"So what?" the Snake Goddess asked again.</p>

  <p>"Can't we stop that?" Fuxi said with a pained expression.</p>

  <p>"Are you serious?" the Snake Goddess said and smiled. 'I have to admit that sometimes, Fuxi is too naive. He still does not know about our current situation.</p>

  <p>Everyone here has pulled out all the stops to fight the Troubled Creatures, and we know what we are doing.</p>

  <p>There are over seventy billion Troubled Creatures here.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, they were all infused with the energy of the Destruction Extreme Form.</p>

  <p>Even if these Troubled Creatures did not fight back and waited for us to put them down, the Extreme Form energy from their corpses will kill us all.</p>

  <p>We are doomed to lose, but Fuxi still wanted to win, ' she thought to herself.</p>

  <p>"Let me... give it a shot," a soft voice spoke. It was Yan.</p>

  <p>Everyone turned to look at her.</p>

  <p>Yan's Energy Shaft could transform the energy, provided that the energy had no master or that the energy didn't belong to those that carried it.</p>

  <p>Thus, Yan might successfully transform the energy inside those purple light balls.</p>

  <p>At that point, she took out her Energy Shaft.</p>

  <p>Then, her gaze landed on the purple light balls.</p>

  <p>For her, these Extreme Form energies were no different from wild monsters.</p>

  <p>She clasped her hands and tightly closed her eyes as if she tried to communicate with the owner-less energies.</p>

  <p>A few seconds later, something had changed.</p>

  <p>Tiny bubbles appeared on the surface of one of the purple light balls.</p>

  <p>Yan abruptly opened her eyes and shouted, "Stay put!"</p>

  <p>In turn, the purple light ball that was slowly falling stopped in its tracks and floated in the air.</p>

  <p>Everyone who saw what happened was dumbfounded. They did not expect that Yan would succeed.</p>

  <p>"She did it! She can control the Extreme Form energy!" Fuxi exclaimed excitedly.</p>

  <p>"She has special powers," Kincaid praised as he nodded his head.</p>

  <p>"But she only controlled one. There are still so many of them left. We can't change anything," Eastern Emperor Taiyi said with a bitter smile.</p>

  <p>As for Yan, she remained calm and composed even after she kept the Extreme Form energy under her control. Then, she opened her palms and said, "Separate."</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Purple flames came out of the purple light ball that she controlled and flew towards the other purple light balls. Eventually, she was able to control the other light balls and suspended them in the air.</p>

  <p>Just like that, she controlled even more and more purple light balls.</p>

  <p>In a short time, she had managed to make over twenty thousand purple light balls float in the air.</p>

  <p>"Well done!"</p>

  <p>"She has truly controlled the purple light balls!"</p>

  <p>"Can Yan really use the Extreme Form energy?"</p>

  <p>While everyone chattered about Yan's progress, Yan stayed focused as sweat broke out on her forehead.</p>

  <p>She drew the purple flames out of the twenty thousand purple light balls, then used the fires to make a net to trap the Troubled Creatures. In the blink of an eye, thousands of Troubled Creatures fell dead.</p>

  <p>All this time, the downgrader who hid in the cloud of Probability Extreme Form secretly watched the scene.</p>

  <p>"Energy Shaft? They've got so many interesting gadgets. But what's the point of holding on like this?" he murmured to himself.</p>

  <p>It was already amazing that Yan had controlled tens of thousands of purple light balls in such a short time.</p>

  <p>However, there were about seventy billion Troubled Creatures left. It only meant that she had to control another seventy billion purple light balls, even if they were lucky enough to kill all the Troubled Creatures.</p>

  <p>It was impossible for her to control all the purple light balls before they turned Pear Hill into ruins.</p>
