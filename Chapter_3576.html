  <p>
</p>



  <p>
</p>

  <p>With the current resources Luo Zheng possessed, the cost of tens of millions of divine crystals wouldn't be an issue. He was capable of producing the Sword-reading Liquid, which was highly valuable. As such, he had made a batch before he returned to the Heart Flow Sect.</p>

  <p>As for the earnings, Luo Zheng had requested Monica to distribute the divine crystals to the Sword Light Palace disciples instead of keeping them for himself.</p>

  <p>After all, Luo Zheng had Stage Fourteen to back him. The place had a massive amount of wealth. The number of divine crystals he gave to these disciples was nothing to him.</p>

  <p>Xi Youqin didn't have the easiest time refining the nourishing pills that her baby needed. However, with Trish's guidance, she showed exceptional tenacity and was able to focus a full week on refining all the pills using complicated methods.</p>

  <p>During the past few days, apart from taking care of Xi Youqin and accompanying Yudie and Aura, Luo Zheng also visited the neighboring courtyard house.</p>

  <p>Hutton, Sally, and the other Nine Li members waited for Ambrose to pick them up after they returned to the Taiyi Heaven Palace. However, Ambrose never arrived. They never mentioned anything about leaving, either.</p>

  <p>The tiny kingdom belonging to the remaining members of the Nine Li race couldn't hold a candle to the majesty of the Taiyi Heaven Palace. Luckily, Despite that they were unable to enter the Land of Sword Grief, Luo Zheng was able to provide them with the required resources in the Myriad Spirits City.</p>

  <p>Thanks to his help, they made rapid progress.</p>

  <p>If Sally could get into the Land of Sword Grief, she could attain a rank within the top nine hundred on the first floor.</p>

  <p>Soon after he returned to his own courtyard house after the visit, a strange sensation passed throughout Luo Zheng's body. With a slight frown, he sat cross-legged on the floor. With a slight thought in his mind, an avatar had appeared within his inner world.</p>

  <p>Even with the removal of the Evil God's Rebirth Land, everything within it remained.</p>

  <p>Ever since the Evil God was brought back to Luo Zheng's inner world, he had been imprisoned together with his wife, Edna.</p>

  <p>She proved her loyalty well, choosing to stay at his side despite her imprisonment.</p>

  <p>This time, when the Evil God returned, Edna noticed he seemed depressed.</p>

  <p>He talked less than usual, barely uttering a single word to her. She also noticed how he was lost in thought as if thinking of something profound.</p>

  <p>All of this worried her.</p>

  <p>She knew that her husband would never compromise or give up. He was as stubborn as a bull, never wanting to give up a chance to turn the tables? unless he was destroyed.</p>

  <p>The Creator of the world the Evil God and Edna were imprisoned in was an omnipotent being? all that existed in his inner world was essentially a part of him. If the Evil God even just thought about rebelling, the Creator would know immediately.</p>

  <p>Edna herself never dared to give any thought to the idea, afraid that if the Creator found out, he would be more wary of her husband.</p>

  <p>If there was anything she was thankful for, it was that the Creator gave her husband the Blood Essence Divine Dao. Ever since then, he'd been fully immersed in fusing the Divine Dao. It relieved her knowing that he had found something he was interested in.</p>

  <p>The Evil God had offered the Creator his Rebirth Land, and even a "Civilization Artifact"? which Edna, although not knowing much about it, knew that it possessed terrifying and threatening energy. In fact, the power it contained would be countless times more terrifying than that of the Ways-blending Energy her husband had.</p>

  <p>If her husband could manage to find a way to seamlessly merge the Blood Essence Divine Dao into the Ways-blending Energy, then he'd receive atonement for his sins and get the opportunity to roam freely in this world.</p>

  <p>Perhaps then, she and he could return to their old happy days.</p>

  <p>Lost deep in thought, Edna was startled back to reality by the sudden flash of lightning.</p>

  <p>The Evil God held a ball of great power in his right hand. It was the Ways-blending Energy, a power comprised of two thousand nine hundred and ninety-eight Divine Dao. His left hand wielded the Thunderstorm Divine Dao which startled her earlier.</p>

  <p>He gently opened his left hand, and with a cracking sound, the Thunderstorm Divine Dao had shot into the Ways-blending Energy. The Evil God was happy to see it still remain stable.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>With the wave of his left hand, a streak of small, blood-red energy spiraled around his fingers and turned into a blood-red dragon.</p>

  <p>There was no denying that the Evil God had an extraordinary understanding of the various Divine Dao. After Luo Zheng got the Blood Essence Divine Dao, he didn't pursue practicing it. As for the Evil God, he now actually could use it with such ease and at a super level.</p>

  <p>The blood-red dragon twined through his fingertips until it made its way to the ball of Ways-blending Energy. By then, the ball already had three thousand kinds of internal momentum within it!</p>

  <p>The Evil God had previously tried to combine the arc light energy with the other Divine Dao in order to reach three thousand Divine Dao in the Ways-blending Energy. However, it clashed with the Thunderstorm Divine Dao. So he began his long journey of trying various ways to combine but there was always a Divine Dao that was rejected.</p>

  <p>Now, the Evil God was successful. He managed to replace the arc light energy with the Blood Essence Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>"I did it!"</p>

  <p>The Evil God finally managed to smile after all this time as he gazed at his success in his hands? the ball of energy really had three thousand Divine Dao in it. It had been a while since he felt this happy.</p>

  <p>If it was before, the Evil God would have thought that he had finally achieved the Divine Dao Great Unity.</p>

  <p>But he already knew that there were more than three thousand types of internal momentum? around three thousand and two according to Luo Zheng. So, even if it reached three thousand, that still wouldn't be enough for him to achieve the Divine Dao Great Unity.</p>

  <p>After successfully merging the Blood Essence Divine Dao with others, his fingertips now flashed with the arc light energy which he shot towards the Ways-blending Energy he still held in his other hand.</p>

  <p>Once the arc light energy disappeared, the Ways-blending Energy began to alter once more. Unfortunately, it became unstable, and more than thirty Divine Dao escaped the powerful orb.</p>

  <p>"How can this be? I?I did everything right?"</p>

  <p>The Evil God was slightly shocked. He only hesitated for a moment. Seeing that the Ways-blending Energy was about to explode, he flicked his left hand and merged the more than thirty Divine Dao separately into a ball and then merge them with the Ways-blending Energy again.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>The Ways-blending Energy became stable once more. The fusion of the internal momentum of three thousand and one Divine Dao was successful.</p>

  <p>"It appears that fusing the more than 30 kinds of internal momentum that have escaped is what's required to stabilize the Ways-blending Energy and succeed." The Evil God muttered as a wave of relief washed over him.</p>

  <p>Such a creation of power wouldn't have been possible without the extraordinary talent showcased by the Evil God. Any other person who dared to re-enact what he just accomplished would have to explore for tens or even hundreds of thousands of years.</p>

  <p>Once three thousand and one Divine Dao were fused together, the Ways-blending Energy morphed once more into a bright, purple-tinged light.</p>

  <p>"Darling, the power seems to keep getting stronger!" Edna exclaimed as she drew near to her husband's side.</p>

  <p>"Yes!"</p>

  <p>The Evil God nodded, a smile of satisfaction plastered on his face. With each gentle wave of his hands, the Ways-blending Energy continued to shift into the shape of diamond. Then it began to overlap itself.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the Evil God had made the diamond-shaped energy superimpose into nearly one hundred layers!</p>

  <p>"Go!"</p>

  <p>The Evil God flicked his fingers, and the diamond-shaped energy shot forward.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the diamond shaped-energy exploded and emitted a blazing white light that shone as bright as the sun with hints of purple-tinged streams scattered throughout.</p>

  <p>Edna quickly covered her eyes and hid behind her husband. The Evil God, on the other hand, gazed at it head-on in excitement.</p>

  <p>The power of Evil God's Ways-blending Energy had reached beyond ten thousand Jun. This surpassed his expectations.</p>

  <p>He knew that with his current limits, he could enable the Ways-blending Energy to have up to one hundred and ninety-three layers. If this was the power that one hundred layers could achieve, surely nothing could stop him once he reached his limit.</p>

  <p>Using all of his strength would enable the power to double itself!</p>

  <p>The light emitted by the Ways-blending Energy shot in all directions. Just as it was about to wreak havoc in Luo Zheng's inner world, the light suddenly froze before shrinking back once more into its original diamond-shaped state. It was as if someone had forced the hands of the clock backward.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng appeared beside the diamond-shaped energy and gently reached out to take the ball of energy in his hand, watching it thoughtfully.</p>
