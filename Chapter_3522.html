  <p>
</p>

  <p>Witnessing the death of the Ghost Scorpion, the members of the Fragrant Butterfly race took on a ghastly expression.</p>

  <p>They had relied on the Ghost Scorpion, king of the underground world in the northern part of the Myriad Spirits City. Massive change was bound to happen due to his sudden death.</p>

  <p>Overwhelmed with anxiety, they froze in place, unable to even consider fleeing.</p>

  <p>The Souls of Light on the terrace of the oval-shaped building were also dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>"The Ghost Scorpion is actually weak?"</p>

  <p>"That man is too powerful. The Ghost Scorpion was no match for him..."</p>

  <p>"Alas, I made a wrong judgment before. I have to go back to report this."</p>

  <p>These Souls of Light had stayed to watch Tianxing and Feng Ge die. They had thought that their demise was certain, so the unexpected turn of events shocked them numb.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>A demon woman disappeared from the terrace and returned to the Source World.</p>

  <p>The demon women were not staying in the Divine Lair all the time. Most of the time, they lived in golden divine trees. When the demon woman appeared in a golden divine tree, she spread out her wings and flew towards the Divine Lair.</p>

  <p>At the sight of the flying figure, the Sun Crows rose high into the air and squawked excitedly.</p>

  <p>Upon the arrival of the demon woman, she knelt before Elizabeth.</p>

  <p>"The Ghost Scorpion at Stage Fourteen was easily killed by the man named Tianxing?" Elizabeth clarified.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he had no power to fight back," the demon woman answered, head still bowed.</p>

  <p>Even though she had witnessed the whole thing with her own eyes, she still couldn't believe it.</p>

  <p>"I see." Elizabeth nodded calmly. "The Ghost Scorpion is just an unimportant pawn, anyway. Don't worry. Continue observing. Someone else will fight Tianxing."</p>

  <p>The creatures at Stage Fourteen were the weakest in the entire Desire World. It didn't matter even if they failed.</p>

  <p id="top_11">However, something bugged Elizabeth.</p>

  <p>It was very likely that Tianxing was actually Zheng. Although Elizabeth hadn't been able to confirm it, it didn't matter. As long as she could get rid of Tianxing and Feng Ge, she would be willing to pay the price.</p>

  <p>Spreading out her massive wings, she closed her eyes and transferred to the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>The Souls of Light of the Bearing race, the Sun Crow race and the other two races were not the only stunned ones.</p>

  <p>All the creatures that secretly watched were also speechless, shocked stiff.</p>

  <p>Everyone was afraid of the Ghost Scorpion, the leader of the underground world. Ordinary creatures didn't dare to provoke him. They would stay away from him lest they cause trouble. However, just now, he didn't even have a chance to strike back and died at the gate of the Oneness Sky Palace's stronghold.</p>

  <p>The Oneness Sky Palace was just an ordinary force in the eyes of the creatures on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>The lowly Souls of Light of the Oneness Sky Palace were very careful to keep a low profile, and were usually polite to any creatures they stumbled across in the Myriad Spirits City.</p>

  <p>In fact, many creatures had taken advantage of their meek nature and robbed them of their soul pills, and occasionally, even soul crystal.</p>

  <p>"Is that human brat an outsider hired by the Oneness Sky Palace?"</p>

  <p>"I have never seen that woman. But that human man has actually come to the Other Shore with his corporeal body!"</p>

  <p>"I extorted 20, 000 soul pills from them not long ago. If they find out what I did, I might be in big trouble!"</p>

  <p>The people from the Source World could leave the Other Shore at any time if they wanted to, but the creatures on the Other Shore couldn't. If they had offended someone they shouldn't have, they'd have no choice but to run away from the Myriad Spirits City.</p>

  <p>Like the other creatures on the Other Shore, the several Ear Mice that were watching from the backs of giant mice were also dumbstruck, staring at the corpse of the Ghost Scorpion. They had originally planned to help Zheng get out of this situation, but apparently, he didn't need their help!</p>

  <p>At the same time, they felt somewhat relieved.</p>

  <p>At the very least, they didn't have any bad blood with Zheng. Then again, if they had been able to lend Zheng a hand at the time, they could've asked for something in exchange.</p>

  <p>"Ear Mice," Zheng suddenly called out, interrupting their thoughts.</p>

  <p>With a squeak, the leader of the Ear Mice answered promptly, "Tianxing, what can we do for you?"</p>

  <p>Zheng glanced at the corpse of the Ghost Scorpion and asked, "Since the Ghost Scorpion has occupied the northern part of the Myriad Spirits City for many years, he should have accumulated quite a bit of wealth and resources, right?"</p>

  <p>Hearing Zheng's words, the Ear Mice suddenly shivered.</p>

  <p>They had been so shocked by Zheng's power that they forgot this.</p>

  <p>The Ghost Scorpion occupied the underground world in the northern part of the Myriad Spirits City. Over the years, he had accumulated wealth, but with his death, what would become of it?</p>

  <p>As long as the news of the Ghost Scorpion's death was spread to the north of the city, the creatures that followed the Ghost Scorpion would definitely scramble to take as much of the wealth he had left.</p>

  <p>"I want half of his accumulated wealth. The other half belongs to you," Zheng said.</p>

  <p>The Ear Mice exchanged glances. Their leader promptly said to an underling, "Hurry up! Go to the north of the city!"</p>

  <p>Like the Ghost Scorpion, the Ear Mice were also active in the underground world of the Myriad Spirits City. The Ghost Scorpion was in the north, while the Ear Mice were in the south. They each minded their own business, without interfering with each other.</p>

  <p>Now that the Ghost Scorpion was dead, naturally, this was a great opportunity for the Ear Mice. Not only could they collect the immense wealth, but they could also take over the northern territory. As for Zheng's request, they wouldn't have objected even if he asked for all of the wealth!</p>

  <p>The appointed Ear Mouse left quickly.</p>

  <p>Zheng indifferently glanced at the women from the Fragrant Butterfly race not far away, who had tried to attack him with poison just now.</p>

  <p>However, he knew they were powerless against him, especially since the Ghost Scorpion was killed. He waved his hand at them and said, "You can go now."</p>

  <p>The women trembled slightly as Zheng addressed them.</p>

  <p>They had been standing there, not daring to run away.</p>

  <p>To their surprise, Zheng just asked them to leave like that.</p>

  <p>They couldn't believe their ears.</p>

  <p>Once Zheng finished his words, he immediately turned around and walked straight towards Feng Ge. Unexpectedly, Feng Ge cracked a smirk and joked,</p>

  <p>"Those women are beautiful. Take them back!"</p>

  <p>"What? Since when did you make jokes?" Zheng raised an eyebrow amusedly.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge's cheeks flushed.</p>

  <p>It was true that she had become quite cheerful in the past six months.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, she'd just blurt out something without thinking first.</p>

  <p>It suddenly dawned on the women of the Fragrant Butterfly race that Zheng truly didn't have any intention to deal with them, so they heaved a sigh of relief. Fluttering their wings, they prepared to flee.</p>

  <p>Just as they took off, they heard something whistling through the air.</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish! Swish!</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, sharp green arrows rained from out of nowhere, piercing the women's wings and bodies.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the several beautiful women had been shot ruthlessly by countless sharp arrows.</p>
