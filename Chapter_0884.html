<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 884 Sincerity </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>In this one particular hall at the living area on the tenth floor of the Tower of Sin, warriors who hung out there were asked to leave the place. Some with their heads bowed out of disappointment, some filled with rage.</p>

  <p>Regardless, they all made their way out.</p>

  <p>A group of top-level war lords had taken over. Back then, real rules included entering and leaving the place in your own free will. But, at that crucial point, rules were disregarded.</p>

  <p>Reluctantly leaving the place, some war generals kept their sentiments to themselves. A powerful war was brewing right before them, and to obey the order of the top-level war lords was the most honorable thing to do at that point.</p>

  <p>In the hall, Maurice was sitting on a corner with a scornful look on his face.</p>

  <p>Ogres all had impressive heights and enormous builds and Maurice's figure was above the average due to his extraordinary height. Even for an ogre, he was exceptionally tall, even when he was sitting.</p>

  <p>Right behind him were three expressionless top-level war lords that gave out a terrifying aura. Despite all their differences, they were somehow thinking about the same things at that exact moment.</p>

  <p>The death of the two war sages was a huge blow to the ogres. It was not easy for them to bear. It caused their race a lot, so to speak.</p>

  <p>What had made things more complicated was Zheng's effect on the ogres.</p>

  <p>They were now in a dilemma.</p>

  <p>Zheng was seated between Fabian and Jarrod. Even if Zheng was capable of defending himself and controlling the Tower of Sin altogether, they just couldn't risk Maurice attacking him.</p>

  <p>It was a grand idea that Esther took three top-level war lords from the Demon Night with her. If a war with the ogres started at that very scene, they would be more than prepared for it.</p>

  <p>"You truly are a young hero. For thousands of years, no living creature has ever completely controlled the Tower of Sin as you have. I'm no believer of fate, but with you, it just seemed like everything was meant to be!" Maurice laughed.</p>

  <p>"I don't believe in fate either. It solely depends on the man himself. We make our own choices. We write our own stories. We make our fate," Zheng smiled faintly in response.</p>

  <p>"A human once said that manpower has its limits. By assessing the situation carefully is how we determine whether or not we can proceed with our actions. Otherwise, we only suffer in the end." Maurice, amused by his own words, had managed to laugh once again.</p>

  <p>Indirectly, Maurice was trying to remind Zheng that even he could have the upper hand in the war by working with the Demon Night or he could even expel the entire ogre race from the Tower of Sin, he just couldn't disregard the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place as well as the Dread Ogre Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>Zheng only chuckled as a response.</p>

  <p>"But I'm curious. How much of the entire Tower of Sin can you control?</p>

  <p>Legend has it that the Tower of Sin is actually a weapon of a powerful master from the Upper World. Is that true?" Maurice asked.</p>

  <p>There were countless speculations surrounding the Tower of Sin. Some said that it was place owned by a certain race for cultivation of some sort, while others said that it was a weapon of an invincible master.</p>

  <p>It didn't even matter to Maurice what the Tower of Sin really was. He was only trying to find out how much of it Zheng could control.</p>

  <p>However, he knew that Zheng didn't want to talk about such matter.</p>

  <p>Nodding his head, Zheng then said, "I haven't refined the Tower of Sin, but…" he paused for a bit and then waved his hand. The walls suddenly began to disappear one by one due to his gesture.</p>

  <p>This hall was located at the outer layer of the living area, and there were quite a few practice rooms around. However, at this moment, the walls were starting to disintegrate in just one swift move of Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>The war generals who were meditating in the practice rooms inside the Tower of Sin stared in shock at the events that unfolded. Some of them were terrified at the scene. Seeing the top-level war lords sitting from afar, the war generals in cultivation began to panic.</p>

  <p>Figuring out that it was Zheng's doing, some of the ogre top-level war lords started to look grave, while Maurice's mouth almost fell to the floor.</p>

  <p>Confident about himself, Zheng wanted to let everyone know the depths of what he could do.</p>

  <p>Even if he hadn't refined the Tower of Sin just yet, he was able to control everything in it with the help of the weapon spirit.</p>

  <p>There was no need to hide anything from all of them. No words were needed, too. Through his actions, Zheng showed everyone what they had all longed to know. If they thought they had the power to act against him at the Tower of Sin, they now knew how wrong they were.</p>

  <p>While the others were threatened, Esther, Fabian, and some others were filled with excitement. As Zheng had demonstrated his power to control the Tower of Sin, the ogres now knew they had no right to bargain with Zheng.</p>

  <p>Maurice stood up and began clapping his hands, "You might not have refined the Tower of Sin, but this is truly groundbreaking, Zheng!</p>

  <p>However…"</p>

  <p>"What is it?" Zheng's eyebrows furrowed, his eyes looking aggressive.</p>

  <p>"You've been trying to kill me all this time. How should we settle this?"</p>

  <p>Maurice only chuckled. "You are a straightforward person indeed. To tell you honestly, the reason I proposed for a settlement is so we can all coexist peacefully in this tower."</p>

  <p>Saying that with a cautious, but very calm tone, Maurice's demeanor surprised everyone who heard him. It was rare for Maurice to speak of such.</p>

  <p>The fact that Esther defeated him in the Tower of Sin never stopped Maurice. All of the ogres had their fair share of terrible attitude. They were always rather overbearing.</p>

  <p>Except for the Demon Night, whenever the ogres had disputes with other races on anything, they never gave in.</p>

  <p>However, for Maurice, even if it was someone from the Demon Night, he didn't care and still acted on his own. Six months ago, there was a dispute between Maurice and Esther. It was not grave, but Maurice was determined to make Esther submit. She finally gave in to avoid fuss over such a trivial matter.</p>

  <p>Because of his intimidating nature, everyone found it hard to believe that Maurice would make such a nice proposal to coexist peacefully with other races. But at that certain time, he learned the beauty of compromise.</p>

  <p>Overjoyed at the situation, Fabian and Jarrod had their hearts climbing out of their throats.</p>

  <p>Since the ogres had chosen to coexist peacefully with other races, it only seemed natural that they had something in mind for a bargain. What was the most valuable thing in the Tower of Sin? Of course, it was the fortune that could be found in the Dark Nether Cave!</p>

  <p>Of course, it was impossible to obtain the said fortune of the Dark Nether Cave by staying in the Tower of Sin. But if any race had more seats in the Tower of Sin, it meant that more members of the race had the opportunities to enter the Dark Nether Cave, thus the chances of obtaining the fortune were much higher.</p>

  <p>The Dark Nether Cave had changed the fate of many races.</p>

  <p>Whether it was the Purple Heart Sacred Place or the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place, they had the Dark Nether Cave to thank their riches for. It was usually the case that some extremely lucky warriors got great fortunes in the Dark Nether Cave and finally established their own sacred places or developed the existing ones.</p>

  <p>'Three seats. We only need three more seats!'</p>

  <p>Fabian thought.</p>

  <p>It would have been of great help, Fabian thought to himself, if the ogres gave up three of their seats for them. Looking at Fabian's cheerful face, Jarrod thought about the same thing. Fabian had wished for getting three seats from ogres. However, for Jarrod, he expected less and two seats would already suffice.</p>

  <p>In comparison, Esther, who ranked the first among the 128 seat owners, had a much higher expectation than Fabian and Jarrod did.</p>

  <p>It would be foolish of Zheng if he didn't take advantage of the situation. He wanted to know how many seats the ogres were willing to give up, and it had to meet his requirement.</p>

  <p>If Esther was in Zheng's place, she would ask for at least ten seats.</p>

  <p>"To show my sincerity to coexist peacefully with you, we ogre race can give up five seats for you humans," Maurice stated and looked at Zheng with a smile.</p>

  <p>Some of the top-level war lords standing behind Maurice had indignant and sullen looks on their faces. Giving five seats for the humans was a humiliation for them. Ultimately, this would mean that five ogres would lose their seats at the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>Both Fabian and Jarrod were thrilled about this.</p>

  <p>It was quite a generous offer. Five more seats for the humans meant that they instantly got twenty-five more tickets to enter the Dark Nether Cave.</p>

  <p>In addition to the previous four seats they had, they would have a total of nine. Even if they still didn't qualify for the third rank at the tower, that was enough for them to rank fourth.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Fabian's and Jarrod's eyes were glinting with excitement like stars. How they hoped for Zheng to take upon the offer! They itched to report such good news to the Purple Heart Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>The Purple Heart Sacred Place constituents only hoped for a single seat the first time Zheng caught their attention.</p>

  <p>But earning five seats for humans while he was on the tenth floor, before he even reached the top of the tower? It was mind-blowing. They never imagined such a thing to occur.</p>

  <p>'Hurry up, kid! What do you think?' Fabian urged in her mind. Both Fabian and Jarrod clenched their fists in hopes that Zheng would agree immediately.</p>

  <p>With eager eyes, Jarrod looked at Zheng. The ogre race had imposed their authority over other races for a long time. It should be considered a huge gift for the human race that ogres were willing to give five seats to them.</p>

  <p>What if Maurice just suddenly changed his mind?</p>

  <p>Esther couldn't help but sigh upon having a glance at how desperate Fabian and Jarrod looked. Human race had been weak for too many years, and they couldn't change anything. Fortunately for them and for the fate of their race, Zheng emerged. The mere thought of having five more seats was going to make radical changes for them. No wonder they got so excited. However, it was a matter of serious discussion. They should be more patient and wait for Zheng to make a more clever bargain.</p>
