<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Geoffrey knew he wouldn't be able to go back at all. Still, he was frightened, so he couldn't help asking that question.</p>

  <p>Elder Xue said nothing. He looked away, observing the gray things in the water.</p>

  <p>Here, at the height of two hundred feet in the Levitation Tower, he had never thought there would be such things. He felt a strange calmness wash over him. He considered several possibilities, in line with the longstanding motto of the Bold Conjecture House: "Boldly make a hypothesis; carefully verify it." He had come up with that on his own.</p>

  <p>"Geoffrey, does the aura of these things strike you as somewhat familiar?" asked Elder Xue.</p>

  <p>"Familiar? No," Geoffrey admitted, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>It was the first time he had seen such things.</p>

  <p>Elder Xue thought for a while. After a few moments, he headed straight towards the water.</p>

  <p>He plunged his head in with a splash.</p>

  <p>As soon as his head was inside the clear water, one of the gray things swam quickly towards him. It spread out, forming the shape of sharp teeth, and started to bite him.</p>

  <p>Elder Xue immediately withdrew his head before the thing could bite him.</p>

  <p>Drops of water trickled down his face.</p>

  <p>The gray thing couldn't leave the water. It lingered in the spot where Elder Xue's head had been and spread outwards, before slowly retreating.</p>

  <p>Elder Xue repeated this action several more times, as though he was teasing the grey thing. As soon as it swam away, he poked his head back into the transparent water.</p>

  <p>Each time, the grey thing rushed back, but not quickly enough to succeed in biting Elder Xue.</p>

  <p>"Elder Xue, why are you doing that?" Geoffrey asked, wondering what game he was playing with the gray thing.</p>

  <p>"I'm trying to sense its aura. It's a pity that it's in water, because the water is blocking most of its aura, making it difficult to sense. I wanted to get a clear confirmation of what I was thinking," Elder Xue answered.</p>

  <p>"What did you learn? What kind of aura is it?" Geoffrey said. He himself had no idea.</p>

  <p>Elder Xue smiled. "I already knew, and I just wanted to make sure," he said, tapping his temple lightly. "The wisp of consciousness that entered our minds before is very similar to this aura!"</p>

  <p>Geoffrey was interested. "Really? If the aura of the things in the water is similar to the aura of that consciousness, then..."</p>

  <p>"It's possible that these are the souls of the Fostering race," Elder Xue finished. As usual with him, it was a clever and bold assumption.</p>

  <p>"The souls of the Fostering race!" exclaimed Geoffrey in surprise. He wasn't entirely convinced. "But why would they put their souls here? Just to attack us?"</p>

  <p>Elder Xue did not respond at once, as he mulled over the implications of his assumption. Finally, he said, "I can't be sure, but there's a good chance it is a reward."</p>

  <p>"A reward?" Geoffrey repeated, thoroughly confused.</p>

  <p>Just now, that member of the Elemental race had been killed miserably in front of them. How could it have anything to do with a reward?</p>

  <p>Moreover, a few days ago, the two members of the Elemental race had also climbed to this height. Both had also stopped here.</p>

  <p>Elder Xue ignored Geoffrey's obvious skepticism. He went on, "It's impossible for the Fostering race to set up an insurmountable barrier."</p>

  <p>"That's just because we haven't found a way, but it can't be a reward,"</p>

  <p>Geoffrey objected.</p>

  <p>Elder Xue stared at Geoffrey. "If a random human being with a strength level similar to yours or even weaker than you entered the Levitation Tower, do you think there would be a high probability of that human passing the six tests?"</p>

  <p>Geoffrey didn't understand why Elder Xue had asked this question. He hesitated and then said, "The probability of passing is very high!"</p>

  <p>Those tests of human nature were not too difficult. If his father or Tianming took part in the tests, they would definitely pass them.</p>

  <p>"Over the countless long years, about two million people from the six races of the Deep Space have entered the Levitation Tower. But only you, me, and three members of the Elemental race have come this far. Don't you feel that's strange?" Elder Xue asked, trying to make Geoffrey see his reasoning.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey had to admit that analysis wasn't his strong suit, but as Elder Xue spoke, Geoffrey tried to follow his thoughts. He asked, "Could it be that the so-called six large races of the Deep Space are too stupid?"</p>

  <p>As for human beings, even if they were placed in the savage land, they would probably develop a high level of intelligence after a few thousand years at most. That period of time would be enough for a civilization to rise and their race to become prosperous.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the six large races in the Deep Space had existed for a long time. The Elemental race had even been cultivated by Elder Xue.</p>

  <p>It was strange indeed if the members of these races had not yet developed a high level of intelligence.</p>

  <p>"After the Deep Space was broken, the conditions for advanced civilization were lost. These six races are like earthworms and ants that live underground. They have been restricted since they were born, so even if I teach them as much as I can, they can only learn so much. They still underperform and act unwisely on many occasions," said Elder Xue. He added, "If you put a wisp of soul into an ant or an earthworm, what will happen?"</p>

  <p>"Their heads would explode?" Geoffrey spoke tentatively. He had never imagined such a thing.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Elder Xue, pointing at the white ashes on the ground.</p>

  <p>"From the perspective of the Fostering race, the members of the Elemental race are ants, earthworms and bugs on the ground. They can't bear the souls of the Fostering race at all, so they exploded and were killed."</p>

  <p>"What about us? You think our heads will not explode?" Geoffrey asked.</p>

  <p>"We have no choice but to take a risk!"</p>

  <p>With a loud splash, Elder Xue went straight into the transparent water.</p>

  <p>Although he had the physical body of a member of the Elemental race, his soul was a human spirit. He came from the main world, but he was still more confident than his companions from the Elemental race.</p>

  <p>Once more, the grey thing formed teeth and approached Elder Xue.</p>

  <p>It bit him, and then it drilled into his head continuously. Geoffrey watched with his mouth open. He found the scene terrifying.</p>

  <p>Elder Xue's eyes rolled and his body twitched repeatedly.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey stared, afraid that Elder Xue's head would explode any second now.</p>

  <p>Three seconds passed, and then six, nine...</p>

  <p>Around a minute later, Elder Xue finally stopped trembling. He floated calmly in the transparent water. His gaze met Geoffrey's, and there was a deep, profound look in his eyes. He crooked his finger at him.</p>

  <p>"You can really bear it!"</p>

  <p>Geoffrey said excitedly, rushing forward. He started to enter the transparent water, but he stopped as soon as he approached the surface.</p>

  <p>He had forgotten that he was different from Elder Xue.</p>

  <p>Elder Xue was no ordinary human spirit, but among the strongest ones.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey was a human being from the chaos, and he was only a True God.</p>

  <p>The gap between them was too big.</p>

  <p>Elder Xue could bear it, but Geoffrey might not be able to.</p>

  <p>"Elder Xue, how about I wait for you here? You can save me after you get the Heavenly Ring Staff," Geoffrey said, smiling weakly at him.</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, Elder Xue swam from the transparent water. He stretched out a hand, grabbed Geoffrey by the neck, and dragged him into the transparent water.</p>

  <p>The water splashed around them as Elder Xue submerged Geoffrey in the depths.</p>

  <p>Another gray thing promptly swam towards Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>Like a blooming gray flower, the thing wrapped petal-shaped arms around Geoffrey's head, and drilled into his mind.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey trembled.</p>

  <p>He felt an intense, swelling pain as the powerful soul force forced its way into his mind.</p>

  <p>The soul power was very pure and untainted. Because it had no owner, Geoffrey absorbed it very smoothly and naturally.</p>

  <p>As the soul assimilated fully into Geoffrey's mind, the pain grew, becoming unbearable. He felt like his head was about to crack open.</p>
