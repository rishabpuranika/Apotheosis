  <p>
</p>

  <p>The exorbitant price required by the Separate Abyss race depressed the human girl as she could not afford it.</p>

  <p>She was afraid that she couldn't leave this stage today.</p>

  <p>Most people minded their business and would not meddle in others' affairs.</p>

  <p>She was, thus, grateful that Luo Zheng was willing to help her. Nevertheless, two hundred thousand soul pills were simply too much.</p>

  <p>"Fine," the girl gritted her teeth as she muttered, "I'll work for you."</p>

  <p>Although she knew it was dangerous, she had no other choice.</p>

  <p>At this time, Luo Zheng said, "I will pay two hundred thousand soul pills!"</p>

  <p>The Separate Abyss race always charged at will. What was worse, they increased the price randomly. Before the guards could change their minds, Luo Zheng nodded at Dorothy.</p>

  <p>Dorothy had been watching silently. When Luo Zheng nodded at her, she took one hundred thousand soul pills out of her space ring and offered it to the guards of the Separate Abyss race.</p>

  <p>The human girl's eyes opened wide. Even though they didn't know each other, Luo Zheng paid such a significant sum to get her out of trouble. She was surprised and extremely grateful.</p>

  <p>The Separate Abyss race, on the other hand, had been cunning as always.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng had stepped in to help the girl, they had increased the price tenfold and asked for two hundred thousand soul pills. Nevertheless, Luo Zheng still paid that amount.</p>

  <p>The Separate Abyss guards hadn't expected Luo Zheng to take out two hundred thousand soul pills. If they were to make things difficult for them now, it would ruin their race's reputation. Therefore, the leader of them waved his hand and said, "You can go!"</p>

  <p>The human girl walked up to Luo Zheng and said, "I'll wait for you in Stage Twelve. Thank you for your help. I will find a way to repay you!"</p>

  <p>Two hundred thousand soul pills were not a significant amount for any Souls of Light who could enter Stage Twelve or Stage Thirteen.</p>

  <p>But it was an exorbitant amount for the girl as her clan had declined. As she wasn't sure whether she could acquire two hundred thousand soul pills, she was hesitant to make the promise.</p>

  <p>"Never mind all that. You can fly upward now," Luo Zheng said with a smile.</p>

  <p>As she was a stranger who he had met by chance on the Other Shore, Luo Zheng didn't think he would see her again in Stage Twelve. Even though he knew that she couldn't return the soul pills, Luo Zheng had still helped her.</p>

  <p>The human girl nodded and walked toward the star ring.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and Dorothy waited in line for a while before it was finally their turn.</p>

  <p>According to the previous agreement, Luo Zheng paid one hundred thousand soul pills.</p>

  <p>But the guard of the Separate Abyss race pointed his huge finger at Dorothy and said, "You, one million soul pills."</p>

  <p>Dorothy's eyebrows shot up, and she asked, "Why?"</p>

  <p>"You paid two hundred thousand soul pills for him just now. It is fair to ask you to pay a higher price," the guard said with a sneer. "If you can't afford it, go that way!"</p>

  <p>He sneered as he pointed to the west.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>Enraged, Luo Zheng's Soul of Light exuded powerful soul aura.</p>

  <p>Even the alien races who were waiting in line felt that the Separate Abyss race was too greedy.</p>

  <p>"They are greedy bullies!"</p>

  <p>"That's what happens when you help others!"</p>

  <p>"If you want to pass Stage Eleven, you have to obey them."</p>

  <p>The other races whispered amongst themselves. They could tell that these two humans were in trouble.</p>

  <p>"What? Do you have a problem with that?"</p>

  <p>The guards of the Separate Abyss race glared at Luo Zheng. They didn't take him seriously.</p>

  <p>Never before in the history of the Separate Abyss race had anyone dared to start a fight in Stage Eleven!</p>

  <p>Dorothy could feel Luo Zheng's anger, but she didn't want to cause more trouble.</p>

  <p>She quickly interjected, "I don't have a million soul pills. Can I pay with soul crystal?"</p>

  <p>The eyes of the guards of the Separate Abyss race lit up as soul crystal was more valuable than soul pill.</p>

  <p>In fact, every race valued soul crystal. After all, even if you had soul pills and divine crystals, you would still be unable to exchange them for soul crystal, considering its rareness.</p>

  <p>"It depends on how much soul crystal you are willing to pay. Ha-ha..." The guards of the Separate Abyss race laughed. As they decided who proceeded to the next stage, they used their authority to extort greater amounts.</p>

  <p>"A finger-size chunk," Dorothy offered.</p>

  <p>"Deal," the guards of the Separate Abyss race agreed without hesitation.</p>

  <p>Everyone knew that soul pills could be slowly accumulated, but soul crystal was rarely seen. As they could find no way to buy some, one finger-size chunk of soul crystal was more precious than a million soul pills.</p>

  <p>Dorothy took out a finger-size chunk of soul crystal from her space ring and handed it to the guard of the Separate Abyss race.</p>

  <p>The other races' eyes shone with greed at the sight of the soul crystal. This was the rarely seen soul crystal. And she had actually paid the fee for passing Stage Eleven with it! What a reckless waste! Suddenly, everyone present was curious about her background.</p>

  <p>Although they sighed with envy at the sight of the soul crystal, they cursed the Separate Abyss race. Judging from the situation, they believed that the Separate Abyss race was becoming greedier and greedier!</p>

  <p>"Let's go." Dorothy walked to Luo Zheng and tugged at his arm. She wanted to avoid trouble, but Luo Zheng was rooted to his spot. He wasn't going to allow some guards to extort such an unfair price from them.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Luo Zheng wasn't leaving, the guards of the Separate Abyss race grinned, "Human boy, if you don't want to leave, you can stay here forever."</p>

  <p>"Settle your anger, please. Let's go!" Dorothy pleaded with Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Since staying here would only cause more trouble, Dorothy was naturally a little anxious.</p>

  <p>Finally, Luo Zheng turned and followed Dorothy toward the star ring. As soon as their Souls of Light entered the star ring, they turned into two rays of light and flew to Stage Twelve.</p>

  <p>The human girl had been watching the star ring all this while. She had been waiting for Luo Zheng in Stage Twelve, just as she had promised him.</p>

  <p>She wanted to repay Luo Zheng as she owed him a big favor. But, first, she needed to know more about him, including his name.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>As the two rays of light descended, Luo Zheng's and Dorothy's Souls of Light reached Stage Twelve.</p>

  <p>"Sir, thank you..."</p>

  <p>As soon as the human girl recognized Luo Zheng's aura, she rushed toward him.</p>

  <p>However, before she could say more, Luo Zheng turned his head and said to Dorothy, "Wait for me here." Before anyone could object, Luo Zheng had left the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Dorothy's plea to stay safe and be careful echoed in the space as Luo Zheng's figure had already disappeared.</p>

  <p>She shook her head slightly. Had the Separate Abyss race accepted two hundred thousand soul pills only, this would never have happened. But they had been unreasonable when they demanded a million soul pills. If she didn't have the soul crystal, she would have been left in Stage Eleven.</p>

  <p>When the human girl saw Luo Zheng disappear, she was at a loss for what to do.</p>

  <p>She stood silently for a while before she asked Dorothy, "Miss, where has he gone?"</p>

  <p>Dorothy replied, "He'll be back soon."</p>

  <p>She knew that it wouldn't take Luo Zheng long to turn Stage Eleven upside down.</p>

  <p>"Oh." The human girl shuffled her feet. "Then, I'll wait for him here."</p>

  <p>"Why are you waiting for him?" Dorothy asked as curiosity coursed through her.</p>

  <p>"I want to know his name. I will return the soul pills to him," the girl explained.</p>

  <p>Dorothy smiled at the girl. "You don't need to do that."</p>

  <p>For her and Luo Zheng, two hundred thousand soul pills were not a significant amount. She did pay a higher price of a finger-size chunk of soul crystal as demanded by the Separate Abyss race, but that had nothing to do with this young human girl.</p>

  <p>As Dorothy was generous and open-minded, she didn't blame the little girl.</p>

  <p>"No! I must return them to him!" The girl was surprisingly persistent.</p>

  <p>Since Dorothy's patience had waned, she said slowly, "I gave the soul pills on his behalf. Now, I'm telling you that I don't need you to pay me back.</p>

  <p>You can leave!"</p>

  <p>Dorothy's words upset the human girl, and she walked away reluctantly.</p>
