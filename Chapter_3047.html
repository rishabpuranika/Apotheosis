<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Although Faegan, Jago and the other disciples were from the Sword Dance Palace, this did not mean they weren't talented.</p>

  <p>Their talents were only inferior to Beldene's and Elgin's since those two were exceptionally gifted. Besides, there were more than ten disciples from the Burial Sword Palace and Demon Sword Palace, and they were also talented warriors.</p>

  <p>When the Flag Masters saw these disciples, they couldn't help but feel excited. With heavy numbers of warriors pouring in, they had a higher probability of convincing some of them to be their followers.</p>

  <p>As the Flag Masters began approaching them with hopeful eyes, Faegan and the others ignored them and moved on to follow Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The Flag Masters stood baffled at the rejection as they watched them pass by.</p>

  <p>"Am I seeing things?"</p>

  <p>"Are all these guys flocking to follow that young man?"</p>

  <p>"That guy must have a noble background. Which clan is he from?" The Flag Masters discussed among themselves while glancing at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>It could be a stroke of luck when Elgin and Beldene decided to follow Luo Zheng's lead. However, now that all these disciples went to stand behind Luo Zheng to pick him as their leader, things were different.</p>

  <p>Just as the Flag Masters attempted to process this awkward situation, another hundred warriors climbed over the Sword Wall.</p>

  <p>Their expressions made a quick switch from confused to glum as they stood there in dismay at the rare sight.</p>

  <p>Among these warriors, only sixteen or seventeen decided to stay back. The rest of them all gathered around Luo Zheng. No matter how much the Flag Masters tried to persuade them, they wouldn't budge. They were all standing with the utmost resolve next to him. The Flag Masters' efforts were all in vain.</p>

  <p>The disciples had made up their mind and they had no intentions of switching sides. All of them wanted to accompany Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>As a result, an awkward scene revealed itself as silence reigned over the Flag Masters who stood empty-handed, whilst Luo Zheng stood tall with no flag yet more than a hundred recruits.</p>

  <p>As more warriors continued to pass through the Sword Wall, the embarrassment of the Flag Masters reduced when they began to join them.</p>

  <p>Tens of thousands of warriors would take part in the Sword Wall trial every day. However, in the end, only one-third of them succeeded in climbing over it. This was still a notable amount.</p>

  <p>As more and more warriors began filling up their ranks, the Flag Masters' tensed expressions relaxed.</p>

  <p>After the trial, the Sword Wall closed up. The young man in a white robe standing over the wall declared in a clear voice, "The Sword Wall is closed now as the trial has ended. Everyone, leave here. Anyone who dares to try and climb over the wall will be killed."</p>

  <p>Several disappointed faces appeared on the other side of the Sword Wall.</p>

  <p>They stood with their heads hanging low from their necks. They had tried over a hundred times, yet failed. Some of them even borrowed money from their friends to buy a bottle of diluted Sword-reading Liquid. Crossing the wall meant a lot to them, and failure in doing so upset them.</p>

  <p>The pressure discharging from the Sword Wall dissipated, but they didn't dare act against the rules knowing the consequences. All that was left was for them to leave with heavy hearts until they could try again in the future.</p>

  <p>On the other side of the Sword Wall, the Flag Masters began to leave with their respective followers who celebrated their achievement.</p>

  <p>The group of disciples in white robes flew up in the air and left the vicinity.</p>

  <p>Harden stared at Luo Zheng and gave him a cold smile before leaving with the other disciples.</p>

  <p>Looking baffled, Luo Zheng glanced in all directions, not knowing what to do next. He had never been a Flag Master, and he did not know the world behind the Sword Wall.</p>

  <p>The female Flag Master approached Luo Zheng with the two women. She gave him a big smile. "Brave young man, you don't know what to do next, right?"</p>

  <p>Before Luo Zheng could say anything, she continued, "Head north, and you'll reach the foot of the Taiyi Mountain after covering a thousand miles.</p>

  <p>There you'll see a city called Dragon City. You can get your flag outside the city."</p>

  <p>"What is the use of this flag?" Luo Zheng asked curiously as he shrugged.</p>

  <p>The female Flag Master shook her head in disappointment and said curtly,</p>

  <p>"How dare you be a Flag Master while knowing nothing! The resources and missions the Taiyi Heaven Palace provide are all in the Dragon City. Only Flag Masters can enter the city. You will know once you get there to retrieve the flag. Besides..."</p>

  <p>She paused to look up at the sky. A dark expression painted across her face.</p>

  <p>It was already dusk and the sky was getting darker and darker as it chased away the sun. "You have to get your flag before it goes dark, or you will be in danger. Hurry up! Good luck to you, young man!"</p>

  <p>Then she turned around and continued to walk with the two women by her side. Since she only came for the women walking beside her, she was supposed to leave after the two women joined her. But she stayed back to guide Luo Zheng on what to do.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng frowned at her warning.</p>

  <p>"We will be in danger if we fail to get the flag before it gets dark? What does that mean?" Kenelm asked giving in to his curiosity.</p>

  <p>Beldene thought for a moment before responding, "This is the Taiyi Heaven Palace's territory. There can't be any nonhuman creatures. The only possible danger is from other people, right?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded in agreement with Beldene. "Harden wanted to give me a hard time. But ever since I climbed over the Sword Wall, he hasn't tried to attack me. I guess the rules change after it gets dark."</p>

  <p>After discussing among themselves, they speculated that the female Flag Master meant someone was most likely to attack them after dark.</p>

  <p>"But even so, what's the use of getting a flag?" Jago asked while he caressed his chin.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng bit his lip and shook his head. "I'm not sure, but it should be very important. There are only two hours left before dark. As the woman said, we'll know when we get there."</p>

  <p>Following the instructions of the female Flag Master, they journeyed a thousand miles north. Upon reaching their destination, they looked up to find a city so white that it was almost like it was dipped in snow.</p>

  <p>The city seemed to be carved with intricate designs made out of white jade.</p>

  <p>The pearly white color of the jade made it look pure and serene.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng walked ahead with the disciples, two guards at the gate of the city clad in iron armor stopped them in their tracks. They intertwined their jade swords to block their path.</p>

  <p>"Stop!"</p>

  <p>"Only the Flag Masters are allowed to enter the Dragon City."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng raised his hands in protest. "I am a Flag Master. Where can I get my flag?"</p>

  <p>The guards scanned Luo Zheng, looking puzzled. They had seldom seen someone who hadn't reached the Other Shore Realm come to get a flag. They finally snapped out of their confusion when one of them pointed to the side and said, "There!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng tilted his head to the side and noticed a small door. He waved the guards goodbye and walked towards it.</p>

  <p>As he opened the door and walked in, his eyes fell on a half-naked old man.</p>

  <p>He instinctively attempted to scan his aura but was unable to. The old man had no hint of power fluctuating from within his body. Naturally, Luo Zheng concluded him to be a mere mortal like the ones in his inner world.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng felt odd. This old man seemed to be even weaker than the divine citizens in the divine land. This was unbelievable!</p>

  <p>"Have you come for your flag?" The old man asked while stroking his chin.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded. "Yes."</p>

  <p>The old man drew out a tag hanging on the wall as he spoke, "Only one person managed to hang the sword on the sixth layer of the Sword Wall today. Was it you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, it was," replied Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The old man continued to walk to the corner of the room. He struggled to carry the weight of his body as he lifted his feet and stumbled with his steps. He raised one of the flagpoles and threw it at Luo Zheng while saying, "You should find your territory before night. Otherwise, you might get killed."</p>

  <p>"My territory?" Luo Zheng narrowed his eyes.</p>

  <p>With a smile, the old man demonstrated what he meant by stabbing the ground with a flagpole. "Insert the flagpole into the ground and you will know."</p>

  <p>"Can I insert the flagpole in any space outside?" Luo Zheng asked again while raising the flagpole in his hands.</p>

  <p>"Of course you can, as long as you can insert it into the ground," the old man said with a weak grin.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't understand what was so hard in just inserting the flagpole into the ground.</p>

  <p>He walked out from the room carrying the flagpole, and kept thinking about what the old man had told him.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng didn't dare underestimate the old man. His ability to suppress his aura impressed him. Even he was unable to pull off such a technique.</p>
