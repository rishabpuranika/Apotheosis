<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Before his voice had even faded, a figure floated out from the space crack. Supreme Lord of Original Sin gawked. It was Nathan himself.</p>

  <p>But compared to what he looked before, Nathan looked rather weak when he appeared from the space crack. His face was pale, and he did not have the slightest bit of vitality. But when Mu Ning was revived by the Heavenly Destiny of Revival, she was lively and full of energy.</p>

  <p>"Father." Nathan bowed and also became excited when he saw Supreme Lord of Original Sin. Just like Mu Ning, he had thought that he would be dead already. Despair and hopelessness enveloped him as he never thought that he would see the sun again.</p>

  <p>"There is no need to greet right now! You silly boy. It is good to see that you are alive!" Supreme Lord of Original Sin stepped forward and hugged Nathan. In the entire Xuanyuan Clan, he had treated Nathan with the most care. At first, Supreme Lord of Original Sin no longer held any hope to Nathan's revival. However, now that Nathan was healed, Supreme Lord of Original Sin felt comforted and let out a grateful sigh.</p>

  <p>Because Nathan had been killed by Maha, he wasn't aware of any of the conflicts in the universe. But after he heard some details from Supreme Lord Lester, his look at that time towards Luo Zheng was completely different.</p>

  <p>Previously, Nathan had gradually been convinced that Luo Zheng was his equal and treated him as a friend. However, after the events, Nathan was utterly in awe of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>As far as the other Godly Geniuses were concerned, no one was qualified to participate in the battle between the Supreme Lords. Tianming continued to cultivate arduously, while Lucille and Lawson hid. The other Godly Geniuses were also in closed-door training. Each of them planned to improve their strengths before they engaged in the war.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, not only had Luo Zheng defeated Maha, but he had also killed a significant number of Supreme Lords of the Sacred race. Such feats were extremely extraordinary!</p>

  <p>What was more shocking was that this guy could actually participate in a battle between True Gods. Luo Zheng was spectacular in the eyes of Nathan!</p>

  <p>That was no longer a simple matter of being the strongest in the Evolutionary Universe. Luo Zheng became the key to the outcome of the battle.</p>

  <p>And as he looked at Luo Zheng, Nathan's mind was filled with worship and admiration.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," Nathan said with a smile. Grateful eyes decorated his face.</p>

  <p>He also knew that his life had been revived with Zheng's help.</p>

  <p>However, his body had been destroyed to an extreme extent. Even though Supreme Lord Lester had used the Heavenly Destiny of Revival to revive him, his cinnabar field was still slightly damaged. Such harm was probably an irreversible injury to ordinary warriors. Nevertheless, to a member of the Xuanyuan Clan, it was not too big of a problem. It was still possible for Nathan to fully recover.</p>

  <p>Blayd didn't head to the fairy palace. The destination he had in mind was somewhere else.</p>

  <p>After he bid farewell to Luo Zheng, Blayd fled to a high place in the deep sky of the Evolutionary Universe. He escaped from a crack in the Sighing Wall that Murphy had smashed.</p>

  <p>As a member of the War God Hall, he did not have the same worry as Estelle.</p>

  <p>After the remaining Supreme Lords agreed to meet again, they all returned to their own territories. Each of them had to address the damages incurred by the war to their supreme worlds.</p>

  <p>Although all of Supreme Lords of the Sacred race had been completely exterminated, there were still many members of the Sacred race that survived and hid within the Evolutionary Universe. The Supreme Lords led their own clansmen to complete the final round of extermination.</p>

  <p>Accompanied with great purpose, they searched diligently for any survivors from the enemy.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng brought Xun and Mu Ning with him to the Breaking Cloud Sacred Place. At last, they were finally reunited with Ning Yudie, Geoffrey,</p>

  <p>Mu Ning and the others.</p>

  <p>After everyone had survived the disaster, the various races had also launched their own special celebrations. The time of peace and happiness had lasted for quite a long time.</p>

  <p>During that time, Supreme Lord of Oracle led her clansmen to take over the lost territories of the Humanity Alliance. At the same time, under the influence of the heavens' vibration, the Evolutionary Universe's heavens gave birth to another Crown of Destiny. That particular Crown of Destiny was obtained by the Thoughtless Minds. However, in the end, it was handed over to the Hidden Spirit Temple of the Blessed Buddha Land. It was a gesture of kindness.</p>

  <p>After all, during this war between the Evolutionary Universe and the Murphy Universe, the loss of the Blessed Buddha Land was the most serious. Not only did it result in the death of one top-rank Supreme Lord, namely Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment, but the other four Supreme Lords also perished at the same time. There was no remaining Supreme Lord in the Blessed Buddha Land after the war. Their defenses were weakened to a pathetic level.</p>

  <p>In the past, when such things happened, the other forces would be ready to make a move and try their best to divide up the Blessed Buddha Land.</p>

  <p>However, after the recent crisis, the different races had shown more mercy. All of them had a new appreciation for the lives of other creatures and started to cherish peace more.</p>

  <p>A year later, the Celestial Position race spread out their invitation letters and invited all the Supreme Lords in the Evolutionary Universe to gather in the Breaking Cloud Sacred Place. Additionally, there were also grand world lords of various races and Saint Lords of different sacred places who also went to the supreme world of the Celestial Position race.</p>

  <p>Countless gifts and tokens were brought by each visitor. It was because Luo Zheng had kept his promise to marry Mu Ning. As such, a marvelous wedding was celebrated, and Margaret's dream had finally come true.</p>

  <p>After this wedding, he would officially be Zheng's wife.</p>
