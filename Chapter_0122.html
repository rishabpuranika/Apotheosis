  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Get out of the way! Move! Once hit by a savage beast like that guy, I am afraid that the impact will jar Zheng's bones!"</p>

  <p>"Is Luo Zheng in a daze? Or does he want to stay rooted and withstand Keith's might directly?"</p>

  <p>"Hey, Luo Zheng has great strength at the marrow refining level. He would have a promising future. But this time, he is overconfident. It will be a pity if he suffers serious injury or death by Keith's attack."</p>

  <p>Although the strength of the outer disciples at Drizzle Peak was inferior to most, these disciples were knowledgeable. They understood that a disciple with considerable strength at the marrow refining level would have a bright future. That was why they felt sorry for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng stubbornly stuck to his previous strategy.</p>

  <p>A punch. That was all he used.</p>

  <p>The seven dragon scales erupted with extraordinary power. This power mingled with Zheng's when he punched Keith. The blow landed on Keith's shoulder, which was the sturdiest part of him.</p>

  <p>Keith had intended to collide into Luo Zheng with his shoulder. He wasn't deterred when he saw that Luo Zheng had decided to use his fist as a countermeasure. Confident of his strength, Keith rammed his body into Zheng's fist instead of evading.</p>

  <p>According to Keith's estimation, once Zheng's fist touched his shoulder, Zheng's arm would be broken by the force.</p>

  <p>However, when Keith's shoulder crashed into Zheng's fist, his facial expression changed.</p>

  <p>He could feel that there was a greater force, which was much stronger than his, coming from Zheng's fist.</p>

  <p>If Keith's power was like that of a furious savage beast, momentum vigorous and extremely explosive, then Zheng's energy was like that of the sea, boundless and unfathomable.</p>

  <p>"Bump!"</p>

  <p>At the moment of contact, the greater of the two forces was easy to figure out.</p>

  <p>Zheng's punch consumed all the impact, and the considerable back-draft transmitted through Keith's body immediately caused Keith to retreat more than a dozen steps.</p>

  <p>Keith wanted to stop his body from backtracking but found himself unable to do so. He stumbled back several more steps before falling outside the arena.</p>

  <p>Again, Luo Zheng won the fight with a punch.</p>

  <p>Just a punch.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had proven himself to be more powerful!</p>

  <p>The disciples of Drizzle Peak felt as though their hearts were jumping out of their mouths.</p>

  <p>Zheng's performance today had completely subverted some of their understanding of the world.</p>

  <p>It was hard to find a fitting word to describe Zheng's performance today.</p>

  <p>The closest one that any disciple could come up with to explain how they felt upon seeing Luo Zheng defeat the two disciples from Vulture Peak was 'enchanting'.</p>

  <p>Who would have expected that Keith, who was famous for his strength, would also be beaten by Luo Zheng with just one punch? What surprised everyone even more was that Luo Zheng didn't have a special knack for fighting. The only special skill Luo Zheng possessed was overwhelming strength.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng continued to flex his arms as he asked the disciples of Vulture Peak with an indifferent look, "Who's next?"</p>

  <p>Although Keith had been beaten with a punch, he was not injured. The stubborn expression on his face showed that he refused to accept his failure. "Wait a minute! I was not ready. I didn't expect you to be so powerful! I want to battle once again!"</p>

  <p>"According to the rules of the challenge, a contestant loses when he falls outside the battle ring. Who's next?" said Luo Zheng as he shook his head. He had just returned to Drizzle Peak today. He wanted a quick victory to end the fight. So, it was natural that he wouldn't want to give Keith another chance.</p>

  <p>Soon afterward, another person from Vulture Peak was dispatched to fight with Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>For the past two consecutive rounds, Luo Zheng had defeated each opponent with only one punch.</p>

  <p>Undoubtedly, this put a great deal of pressure on the outer disciples of Vulture Peak.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng was at the marrow refining level, his display of strength had earned him some caution and respect from the contestants of Vulture Peak. none of them would despise him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng hadn't defeated Keith by tricks or luck. Instead, he had used his actual strength, which proved that Luo Zheng was far more powerful than those at the same level as him.</p>

  <p>Soon, the fourth person sent by Vulture Peak walked into the battle ring.</p>

  <p>He?stared at Zheng's every movement prudently.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Luo Zheng did not give him any chance to attack.</p>

  <p>Still using only one punch, Luo Zheng dispatched the fourth challenger from Vulture Peak by sending him flying out of the arena...</p>

  <p>Jubilant, this was what the disciples from Drizzle Peak felt. No words could accurately describe their feelings. All they could do was cheer as if only this reaction could express their excitement.</p>

  <p>Hundreds of feet away, two women stood on a small building. They had been watching every fight.</p>

  <p>Both of them were elegant, poised, and startlingly beautiful.</p>

  <p>"Master Su, you tricked me! You suggested that we should arrange a competition to motivate the outer disciples of your peak, to which I readily agreed. Then, I came over with the most talented outer disciples of Vulture Peak. But what I didn't know was that there is such a genius here..." The woman who had spoken was Mia Mu. She was one of the masters of Vulture Peak.</p>

  <p>Actually, the two masters had cleverly arranged this challenge.</p>

  <p>To motivate the disciples in their respective peaks and to encourage them to work harder, masters would apply almost all methods they could think of.</p>

  <p>A challenge between peaks was a very effective method.</p>
