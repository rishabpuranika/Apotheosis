<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It seemed to rain a cloud of dusty mist as the fine powder danced continuously in the air, and then gathered in the Teleportation Token.</p>

  <p>"Is it successful?" Zheng asked excitedly.</p>

  <p>His heart pounded so ecstatically that he almost wanted to jump up and down.</p>

  <p>He thought before that everything would disappear and he wouldn't be able to get any items after the Illusion Battlefield was closed. Now, he could even take the Teleportation Token with him! This was better than he expected. How could he not be excited?</p>

  <p>A mark the size of an ant appeared on the corner of the Teleportation Token not long after.</p>

  <p>It looked like it was indeed possible for him to take the Teleportation Token out of battlefield.</p>

  <p>However, he still did not know if he could travel to other places by using the Teleportation Token.</p>

  <p>If it turned out that he couldn't use the Teleportation Token if he took it out, then it meant that Zheng would've wasted a perfect opportunity just because of it.</p>

  <p>This was like a gamble, but Zheng was willing to take the risk. After all, if the Teleportation Token proved to be useful, he would be able to freely travel around the whole universe by then.</p>

  <p>"Huh? What is this?" asked Coleman.</p>

  <p>He leaned towards Zheng, his curious eyes fixated on the small Teleportation Token in Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh..." Zheng quickly stuffed the Teleportation Token into his space ring and said, "Nothing."</p>

  <p>Coleman just stared at him with wide eyes. "So mysterious…" he muttered in disappointment.</p>

  <p>Zheng shrugged indifferently and simply ignored him.</p>

  <p>Among their group of warriors, Zheng was surprisingly not the one who found it the hardest to make a choice.</p>

  <p>The one who felt the most conflicted at that moment, was none other than Janet.</p>

  <p>Her body concealed a piece of Lofty Wood.</p>

  <p>She could consider the Lofty Wood her life's treasure. Moreover, it was actually a living creature which had integrated with her.</p>

  <p>Thus, Janet should naturally not hesitate to choose the Lofty Wood.</p>

  <p>However, her arms were cradling the flame kitten. A trace of doubt appeared on her face.</p>

  <p>She rocked the little flame kitten a bit, and thought that she actually wanted to bring it out of the Illusion Battlefield!</p>

  <p>The truth was that the flame kitten was also a high-level Law Creature. It was extremely rare to find even in the Divine Flame World. Plus, it wasn't easy to catch a flame kitten.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, her Lofty Wood was a legendary divine wood that was considered to be a product beyond the heavens. She now had the chance to duplicate and take it out, but she suddenly hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Janet, why are you hesitating?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>He looked at her in confusion after he had put away his Teleportation Token.</p>

  <p>Janet pursed her lips. "I'm thinking which thing I should take out..."</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! Why do you still think about it? You should choose the Lofty Wood!" Jeffrey chimed in. Although Janet had used the Lofty Wood as an adjustable fishing rod in the Hall of Causality, everyone could clearly see the powerful life force contained within it.</p>

  <p>If she chose the Lofty Wood, who knew what powerful abilities Janet could possibly employ.</p>

  <p>In Zheng's opinion, Janet really didn't need to think twice.</p>

  <p>"But, but... I want to take this kitten away," Janet said, her eyes blinking.</p>

  <p>"You are so crazy!" Jeffrey shouted in protest. Nearby, Hailey glanced at Janet indifferently.</p>

  <p>However, she just smiled and said nothing.</p>

  <p>Whatever Janet decided to take away had nothing to do with the other warriors. They were all members of the same team when they were in the Hall of Causality, but competitors when they'd gotten out.</p>

  <p>This flame kitten might be very rare, but it was definitely not a supreme treasure. The price for taming a similar flame kitten was probably equal to getting a first-rank divine weapon.</p>

  <p>The flame kitten was hardly comparable with the piece of Lofty Wood.</p>

  <p>Janet was torn between the two in the beginning.</p>

  <p>However, she looked determined now as she crushed the pink light dot in her hand.</p>

  <p>She didn't take out the Lofty Wood. The powder flew towards the flame kitten and left behind a mark on its thick fur.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Jeffrey and the others just watched dumbfoundedly with wide eyes.</p>

  <p>The pink light dot was of course very valuable, but Janet wasted it on a kitten just like that...</p>

  <p>The others didn't say anything about it, but just felt it was really a pity.</p>

  <p>Yet, Janet looked resolute and she did not feel any regrets at all. Instead, she happily played with the flame kitten in her arms.</p>

  <p>"Meow..."</p>

  <p>Perhaps the flame kitten also knew something as it looked earnestly at Janet and purred gently.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, everyone took their chances and chose an item to bring out.</p>

  <p>At the same time, six exits appeared on the wall— the exits to the Hall of Causality.</p>

  <p>"After we leave the Hall of Causality, will we return to the main city where we stayed before?" Jeffrey asked. Janet looked at him and shook her head.</p>

  <p>She said, "No, all of the exits of the Hall of Causality are fixed to a certain main city in the supreme world. All the warriors who enter the Hall of Causality will eventually gather in the same main city."</p>

  <p>"So, that main city..." Jeffrey frowned slightly.</p>

  <p>Janet nodded and added, "This is the Illusion Battlefield's true purpose.</p>

  <p>All the warriors who can enter the Hall of Causality are basically the best warriors in the supreme world. Since the exits are set in one place, the top warriors would fight each other after leaving the Hall of Causality!"</p>

  <p>Jeffrey's eyebrows cocked up at Janet's words. Everyone had a fighting intent in their eyes as well.</p>

  <p>Even Coleman, the weakest one among them, was absolutely the most powerful warrior of the main city where he stayed...</p>

  <p>And those who they wanted to challenge were on the same level as them!</p>

  <p>"Then... Let's go out," Hailey suggested.</p>

  <p>Just then, Janet tilted her head and cheerfully said, "Zheng, I have a request! Don't attack any of us after leaving the hall!"</p>

  <p>"That's a good idea! I agree!" Coleman immediately agreed.</p>

  <p>All of them had admired Zheng in their team efforts in the Hall of Causality. After they'd observed him for quite a while, they all wondered what would happen if they became Zheng's opponents.</p>

  <p>They believed that it wouldn't end well for them. They thought that they would all realize that they would never win against Zheng, no matter how hard they tried.</p>

  <p>Jeffrey, Hailey, Janet and the others were all afraid of Zheng. Therefore, Janet made her request before she left the hall.</p>

  <p>As for Zheng, he smiled faintly and nodded.</p>

  <p>Even Jeffrey, who thought highly of himself, stayed quiet. He only admired very few warriors, and Zheng was the only one he regarded highly among all the warriors in the same realm.</p>

  <p>After that, they all walked towards the six beams of light.</p>

  <p>Six rays of light suddenly appeared in the center of a main city within the central zone of the supreme world. Those rays of light had gradually formed into six doors of light.</p>

  <p>"They are coming out! Another team has passed through the Hall of Causality!"</p>

  <p>"This team doesn't seem to be that good. Only six of them survived."</p>

  <p>"They're only average, and even their strongest warrior might not be an ace talent..."</p>

  <p>Many warriors who were watching in the center of the main city chattered among themselves.</p>

  <p>These warriors were quite mediocre in strength. They weren't qualified to receive iron tickets or even more five million Illusion Points. They were unlucky to have been put in this main city where there were many invincible warriors.</p>

  <p>After all, the exit to the Hall of Causality was set in this city. Those who could enter the Hall of Causality were considered the best of all the main cities, which meant that those who passed the test in the Hall of Causality were extremely remarkable. They were either ace talents or second only to the ace talents!</p>

  <p>Thus, it was safe to say that the ordinary warriors in this main city were destined to be nobodies.</p>

  <p>When the first group of warriors that passed through the Hall of Causality emerged, they had carried out a slaughter in the main city.</p>

  <p>Those who were strong enough had fled away, and those who stayed were the weaker ones. They refused to leave the main city and simply remained there to watch the powerful warriors come out of the Hall of Causality.</p>

  <p>Some of the strong warriors didn't care about the weaker ones. They all quickly headed for other main cities or set out to explore more hidden places.</p>

  <p>However, there were still quite a few experts who chose to stay behind.</p>

  <p>Since the exit to the Hall of Causality was located in that main city, they believed that it was where they would encounter other experts.</p>

  <p>It could be said that one's ability to steal others' Illusion Points depended on their own skills and strengths.</p>

  <p>After Zheng stepped out of the door of light, he glanced around and asked,</p>

  <p>"Jeffrey, Janet, what are your plans?"</p>

  <p>Jeffrey's eyes flashed slightly. "I still have some things to digest. I need to find a quiet place to meditate and comprehend."</p>

  <p>The Past Solemn Kalpa was a Buddhist scripture, but it was also a type of cultivation method. This Past Solemn Kalpa was different from many other divine techniques, as it was a common Buddhist scripture in the Blessed Buddha Land.</p>

  <p>It was known that only a few warriors could truly comprehend it.</p>

  <p>It was similar to the Gods-intimidating Strike. Countless warriors had spent even more than ten thousand years to comprehend it, but only Zheng had truly mastered it.</p>
