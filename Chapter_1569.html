  <p>
</p>

  <p>Aurora's face was scrunched up in pain after having her back smashed against the tree trunk from the force of the explosion.</p>

  <p>She shouldn't have asked him to give it a try if she knew this was the way he was going to deal with these ants!</p>

  <p>After the dust settled, all of them decided to leave the safety of the tree trunk and check on the state of their surroundings.</p>

  <p>Having settled themselves, they jumped onto the broad branch. Except for Aurora, Amber, and Vivian, the rest of them were pale with shock.</p>

  <p>Although they were quite far from the center of the explosion, they were still slightly injured by the impact. A couple of them felt the beginnings of abnormal circulation and meridian stasis from the blast. It was a good thing that they stocked up on pills for a swift recovery. Soon after, they were surprised at what they saw.</p>

  <p>"This guy...</p>

  <p>How on earth did he manage to withstand such a powerful impact?!" Luo Luo Zheng stood firmly on the branch with no signs of injury at all despite being smacked in the middle of the explosion. Aurora pursed her lips as she looked up at the unharmed young man. She couldn't help but sulk at the fact that the world was so unfair. They were both Soul Sea Realm warriors but why was there such a huge difference in their strength?</p>

  <p>Amber, on the other hand, only sighed. She wasn't as surprised as the others. In fact, this was exactly what she expected. 'He's grown so much in just the span of seven years. Now I'm the one who has to look up to him, ' she couldn't help but think to herself as she looked at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>With the elimination of these Explosive Ferocious Ants, their way forward had now been cleared.</p>

  <p>The eighth branch would've normally taken them several hours to pass but that time had now been reduced to five minutes because of Luo Zheng's strong attack.</p>

  <p>The group stepped onto the plate at the end of the branch and continued their climb.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the Humanity Alliance, a petite figure had climbed out of an ascending pool in the Three Purities World.</p>

  <p>The water had drenched her entire body but with a gust of cold air, it immediately turned into ice shards!</p>

  <p>The woman shook her body and let the shards fall into the pool.</p>

  <p>"Ding ding..."</p>

  <p>"The vitality between heaven and earth here is so violent!"</p>

  <p>She looked around and took in her surroundings with curiosity.</p>

  <p>Wanting to see more of this strange place she had just arrived in, she slowly walked down from the side of the ascending pool...</p>

  <p>"You, and you, and the rest of you stay there! Don't move!" an armored warrior ordered.</p>

  <p>The woman slightly raised her brows as a brief display of defiance, however, she was quick to submit after finding out the cultivation level of this warrior. He was a powerful master at the late stage of the Soul Sea Realm!</p>

  <p>She did not resist and obediently followed the other warriors who had also ascended from the Lower World.</p>

  <p>These new arrivals had high hopes for the Upper World.</p>

  <p>None of them knew that the competition here was going to be even more grueling than that of the Lower World.</p>

  <p>These warriors had been top warriors and held absolute power back in the Lower World, but here Soul Sea Realm warriors were in the lower end of the social spectrum. They would have to get used to the status change soon enough.</p>

  <p>The woman curled up in a corner as she tried to get used to the violent vitality between heaven and earth. At the same time, a heavy feeling of melancholy descended upon her.</p>

  <p>'My husband's cultivation was at the Life and Death Realm back then.</p>

  <p>It's been more than six years since he left. I don't know which level he's reached now. Has he already reached the Soul Sea Realm?' she couldn't help but wonder to herself.</p>

  <p>This woman was no other than Cloud Hall's leader: Ning Yudie!</p>

  <p>She had finally reached the Soul Sea Realm after so many years.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng left, she had already been pregnant. Their child had been born as a boy whom she named Luo Nian Luo.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian was her only source of consolation for the past six years. He was the spitting image of Luo Luo Zheng which somewhat eased her loneliness but also added to her worries every single day.</p>

  <p>It was normal for warriors to separate for several years after getting married.</p>

  <p>Some even went to the extremes and practiced a hundred years in seclusion. A door would often separate them from their partners but the only time they would get to meet again would be after an entire century.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng and Ning Yudie had married young and Ning Yudie herself had no experience in dealing with lovesickness. These past few years of being separated from Luo Luo Zheng almost killed her.</p>

  <p>The only way she could rid herself of this torment was through immersing herself in cultivation and, after six long years, she finally reached the Soul Sea Realm!</p>

  <p>Her son, Luo Nian, was now six years old and an extremely intelligent boy. The Cloud Hall enjoyed a high status in the Central Region, and he had a much stronger foundation than his peers due to the advantage of having Cloud Hall's resources at his disposal. He had already reached the fourth grade of the nature level.</p>

  <p>Her ascension meant she had to leave her son but it was a necessary trade-off in order to reunite with Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"This supreme world is so vast and boundless that you can't even imagine how big it is...</p>

  <p>Even the travelling speed of Soul Sea Realm warriors would not be enough. It would still take you around a hundred years to cross it!</p>

  <p>This is the Pure Jade Sacred Place of our Three Purities World. it is a tenth-grade sacred place. The world lord of the Three Purities World is also the Saint Lord of our Pure Jade Sacred Place..." the armored Soul Sea Realm warrior informed them as a kind of briefing.</p>

  <p>His words immediately shook Yudie's heart.</p>

  <p>She knew the Upper World was vast and boundless and couldn't be compared with the great world she was from.</p>

  <p>She knew the path towards Luo Luo Zheng wasn't going to be easy...</p>

  <p>However, from what the armored warrior said, the size of these one hundred thousand supreme worlds was beyond her expectation and it was even harder for her to find Luo Luo Zheng than what she initially imagined!</p>

  <p>A hundred years for Soul Sea warriors to travel across a Supreme World?</p>

  <p>It was ridiculous! Not to mention that there were still one hundred thousand supreme worlds here! Finding her husband was going to be even harder than finding a needle in a haystack.</p>

  <p>And what was the warrior saying? She had ascended to a tenth-grade sacred place?</p>

  <p>Just how strong was this sacred place?</p>

  <p>These thoughts went through her mind as she sat there.</p>

  <p>"All the warriors from the Lower World, follow me!" the armored warrior ordered with a booming voice. "Since the opening of the Illusion Battlefield, the miners have all slipped in one by one. The entire mine is in a dire need of manpower. You all have to go to the mineral vein of our Pure Jade Sacred Place to do the mining."</p>

  <p>The Illusion Battlefield had opened and all Soul Sea Realm warriors were allowed to participate.</p>

  <p>It was generally forbidden for the ascended warriors to participate since they still needed to work in the mineral vein but it proved to be impossible to stop them. All the Soul Sea warriors needed to do was to step inside and leave the mining work behind so nobody could really do anything to stop them.</p>

  <p>What was even more infuriating was that the Pure Jade Sacred Place had forbidden all the stewards from entering the Illusion Battlefield. They could only look on in despair as the chance of improving themselves slipped away from their fingers.</p>

  <p>"Mining? How long will it take?" a newly-ascended warrior asked.</p>

  <p>"It all depends on your strength! Some people are fortunate and were able to leave after three to five years. Others, not so much. There are some who've stayed here for over a hundred years!" the armored warrior at the Soul Sea Realm answered with a laugh.</p>

  <p>His answer stunned the newly-ascended warriors.</p>

  <p>Ascending to the Upper World had been a lifelong dream from them back in the Lower World but now they had just been told that they might have to spend over a hundred years here just mining? This was definitely not what they expected.</p>

  <p>Yudie's heart was also filled with anxiety. She just mechanically followed the group and didn't know what she should do.</p>

  <p>She had initially been an independent woman but had grown reliant on Luo Luo Zheng after their marriage.</p>

  <p>But he wasn't here right now! He hadn't been for the past few years.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's talent was no doubt enough to make him a core martial artist in a tenth-grade sacred place.</p>

  <p>But there were so many supreme worlds here in the Upper World and she had no idea which one he ended up in.</p>

  <p>Would she really have to mine here for decades?</p>

  <p>If she had known this earlier, then she wouldn't have ascended. She would've just stayed in the Lower World with her Luo Nian.</p>

  <p>But it was too late for regrets now. The armored warriors quickly led them to a space tunnel and advanced.</p>

  <p>However, halfway through their journey, an armored warrior went into the group and stopped in front of Ning Yudie. "You, stop. You don't need to mine anymore."</p>

  <p>"Huh?" she could only remark in surprise.</p>

  <p>The armored warrior only shook his head. "Just follow me."</p>

  <p>Her eyes flickered in curiosity, not really knowing what was happening.</p>

  <p>Everything was just so strange here in the Upper World.</p>

  <p>But she took it as a good sign that she wouldn't need to mine anymore.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie split from the group and followed the armored warrior into the space tunnel. They walked through it for a while before finally arriving at a large city.</p>

  <p>Her eyes were wide in wonder as she took in the grandeur of the sights in front of her. Soon enough, she was being led into an equally exquisite hall. dozens of women were already gathered here, all of them at the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie took the chance to converse with some of them and found out that they too were all newly-ascended warriors from the Lower World.</p>

  <p>They were also brought here with no knowledge as to why and what exactly was waiting for them.</p>

  <p>Leaving wasn't an option since there were armored warriors who stood guard outside the hall.</p>

  <p>This was when Ning Yudie realized that there was something fishy going on.</p>

  <p>Why exactly had they been brought and gathered here? Nobody knew so they could only resort to focusing on their cultivation.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie and these other women had waited here for half a month until, one day, three young men arrived. Their bodies emitted strong auras and all of them were powerful masters at the Spirit Supreme Realm.</p>
