<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 192 The Five-clawed Blackish Purple Dragon (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As the spectators waited for the fight's next sequence with bated breaths, the golden dragon slithered around Zheng and pranced on its five, large claws like a giant snake. Zheng's Heavenly Ogre Fist was far weaker than that of the golden dragon's, and his power had been weakened a lot throughout the battle.</p>

  <p>After all, Zheng was still half-step into the nature level, which meant that he was only capable of condensing and exerting demonic life energy.</p>

  <p>Although demonic life energy was powerful as it was, it was nothing compared to the strength of life vitality. Apart from the incomparable differences between the two, the five-clawed golden dragon in front of him continuously consumed life vitality which only made it grow stronger.</p>

  <p>Thus, the battle between the dragon and Zheng was not the fairest. It was like pitting a chick against an eagle, and Zheng was the much weaker chick.</p>

  <p>"Boff!"</p>

  <p>The unmistakable cracking sound of a punch was heard from the shadow of Zheng's fist that collided against the five-clawed golden dragon. Right after the punch, the shadow stealthily slipped into the body of the dragon and vanished from their sight.</p>

  <p>The general of the imperial army's lips curved into a flat smile when the shadow had vanished. He sneered at Zheng's overestimation of his own strength and overconfidence about his own abilities. He used to think highly of his own "Magical Dragon Fist," but after a fierce attack, Zheng even didn't flinch at all. Very soon, the golden dragon defused Zheng's punch that he used his life energy to throw.</p>

  <p>The spectators, including Lenard and Cleve, shook their heads at the sight of the attack.</p>

  <p>The audience were witnessing what they had already expected.</p>

  <p>It was completely impossible for anyone else present to battle a strongman who had entered the Illuminating Soul Realm, simply because in such a fight, they weren't powerful enough to counterattack at all.</p>

  <p>In the audience, Nina's face had a serious and vexed expression. For this trip, she brought along three jade boxes with her, each containing a "Shock Dragon". She had previously called on her last Shock Dragon to counterattack the five-clawed golden dragon when it showed up for the first time, so she had none left.</p>

  <p>Even if all her Shock Dragons had been used up, she still had an arsenal of other hidden self-defense weapons ready at her disposal.</p>

  <p>For instance, she owned one "thunder stone," which was considered as one of the three most powerful weapons of the Zhu family despite its mere size and appearance.</p>

  <p>The process for making a thunder stone was extremely complicated. In addition to the complexity of producing one, it was also made out of highly expensive materials. It would roughly cost about ten thousand cubic crystals to create a single thunder stone. It was like consuming ten thousand cubic crystals in one go, which meant it was too costly to utilize one.</p>

  <p>For all those reasons, the Zhu family had only made seven thunder stones, one of which was possessed by Nina.</p>

  <p>In the event that Zheng couldn't defeat the golden dragon by himself, Nina was ready to throw one thunder stone at the creature to aid Zheng's attacks.</p>

  <p>Her slender hands clutched the small stone tightly. She grew increasingly nervous as she continued to watch Zheng's battle against the golden dragon.</p>

  <p>After the golden dragon crashed the intent of Zheng's fist, it ferociously jumped at Zheng right away. However, when it got quite close to Zheng, something strange took place.</p>

  <p>A little blackish purple spot suddenly showed up on the chest of the golden dragon, which swiftly began to grow bigger and bigger.</p>

  <p>The incident left Nina's mouth agape at the mysterious scene that played out in front of them. She knew that the blackish purple thing was just Zheng's life energy.</p>

  <p>Zheng's life energy showed up and dispersed slowly. Its dispersion gradually increased in speed, and when the golden dragon rushed very closely to Zheng, the demonic life energy had completely engulfed the dragon.</p>

  <p>The once glittering golden dragon had immediately turned into a blackish-purple skinned creature. The attack of Zheng's demonic life energy had forced it to cease moving and stop in front of him, as if it was frozen into its place.</p>

  <p>The strange occurrence took everyone by surprise, including the imperial army general whose face now wore a peeved expression. In this battle, he had previously exerted a Magical Dragon Fist, which called out the five-clawed golden dragon that attacked his enemy. Furthermore, he could still manipulate the direction where the golden dragon moved. He could even order the golden dragon to howl and roar in order to boost their morale to fight.</p>

  <p>However, in this moment, the five-clawed golden dragon that he had tamed with his life energy had not only turned blackish purple, but also lost contact with him. In other words, he was currently incapable of keeping the dragon completely under his control.</p>

  <p>His eyebrows furrowed as he thought about the situation. "What on earth has happened? Why did my golden dragon turn blackish purple? What the hell has this guy done to my dragon?" he muttered. Confusion and many unanswered questions filled his mind, all of which were beyond his comprehension.</p>

  <p>In the battle arena, Zheng was also quite stunned by the dragon in front of him. When he released the life energy, he had never thought he could manipulate the golden dragon. After all, he knew that he was only half-step into the nature level, so that was an impossible feat for him.</p>

  <p>However, the complete opposite happened as the dragon was now completely under his command. It was just too astounding especially for Zheng.</p>

  <p>Reaching half-step into the nature level meant that Zheng could only isolate the life energy from his body and conserve it for now. However, the life energy usually wouldn't be able to kill his enemies if it didn't attach itself to any weapon.</p>

  <p>Only if he had fully entered into the nature level, converted his life energy into life vitality, and turned his meditations into reality could he turn life vitality into substance and have the ability to kill his enemies under his control.</p>

  <p>The blackish purple dragon in front of him still remained docile under his command. It had originally been converted from the imperial army general's life vitality, but was now under Zheng's influence after it was consumed by his demonic life energy.</p>

  <p>Zheng's head whipped to the side for a moment. 'Then, how can I manipulate this five-clawed blackish purple dragon?' he thought.</p>

  <p>As he silently asked himself, he came up with an idea. He immediately proceeded to separate his soul from his body and bewitched the dragon with his mind.</p>

  <p>"Howl, rawr!" the dragon let out a thundering cry.</p>

  <p>It was as if it had been woken up from a deep slumber. The huge monster began to ascend towards the sky, as its body started to slither around Zheng's own.</p>

  <p>Eyes wide with astonishment, Zheng was completely amazed and pleased at the outcome of his magic. "That's it! I really can manipulate it now!" he exclaimed excitedly. The blackish purple dragon slithered this way and that, then lowered its head to face its current master. Zheng gave it a gentle pat on the forehead as he stared smugly at the furious eyes of the imperial army's general, who had reached the Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>All the spectators were utterly dazed by the scene. They were absolutely puzzled by how Zheng got the general's dragon under his control, especially with only his half-step into the nature level abilities.</p>

  <p>What had gone wrong? Just a few moments ago, they witnessed how the golden dragon was ready to kill Zheng. But, how could the dragon turn into a blackish purple color and be under Zheng's authority in just a blink of an eye? The dragon had really stopped its attacks against Zheng and seemed to have been under his dominance.</p>

  <p>Was there anything weirder than this in the world?</p>
