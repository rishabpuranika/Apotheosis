<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The entire Divine Emperor Island was composed of a massive, black cemetery.</p>

  <p>On the shore of the island, the other powerful Soul Sea Realm masters had already been waiting for quite a long time. Strange looks of curiosity were revealed when they saw that the four divine kingdoms' rulers came along with Fiona, Bram, and the other young warriors.</p>

  <p>"Your majesty, why did you bring them to the Divine Emperor Secret Land?" a Soul Sea Realm master of the Harlen Divine Kingdom couldn't help but ask.</p>

  <p>Since the group of masters waited in the same spot and hadn't traveled to the Feather Emperor Island, they had no knowledge of Zheng having obtained the Black Star and many Soul Cores.</p>

  <p>Since they didn't have enough Soul Cores every year, these masters would vie with one another to enter the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land.</p>

  <p>Because of that, many of them argued indefinitely over the qualifications of obtaining the Soul Cores.</p>

  <p>Because of the lack of the Soul Cores, the masters went as far as to suggest an actual fight.</p>

  <p>While they considered it for a time, they found that it would be too unrealistic— the impact of the fight among the Soul Sea Realm masters would be extremely grand. If they were to hold real fights, the entire Divine Emperor Island wouldn't survive a couple rounds.</p>

  <p>And since that problem hadn't yet been solved, why did the kingdom rulers bring the princes with them? How come Tianxing came with them as well? Could it be that the divine kingdom rulers planned on assigning a portion of Soul Cores to these juniors this year?</p>

  <p>Eventually, Turner managed a faint smile and said, "Mario, bring out all the spare spirit shrines!"</p>

  <p>Upon that, one of the masters, Mario Zhou, furrowed his brows in shock.</p>

  <p>"Your majesty, how many Soul Cores did you obtain this time? Must we use the spare spirit shrines?"</p>

  <p>The spirit shrine was used to stimulate the Soul Core, made by the blacksmith from the Harlen Divine Kingdom. Before departing this year, he counted twenty-nine Soul Cores, meaning there was a need for the same number of spirit shrines.</p>

  <p>Normally, if they obtained a single Soul Core after eliminating all the mineral-devouring bugs on the Feather Emperor Island, they would be considered lucky. Obtaining two Soul Cores would be completely unprecedented— such an occurrence hadn't happened in decades.</p>

  <p>Could it be that all the divine kingdom rulers were merely extremely lucky this time to have gotten over three Soul Cores?</p>

  <p>Since the spirit shrines weren't anything precious, Mario Zhou had prepared two hundred of them. But no matter how many shrines there were, they would be useless if there weren't any Soul Cores available.</p>

  <p>With a bland smile, Turner said, "Pull out all the spirit shrines. This time, we've obtained over a hundred Soul Cores."</p>

  <p>"What?</p>

  <p>Over one hundred Soul Cores? Does that mean everyone can enter the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land this time?"</p>

  <p>"How is that possible? Isn't that the number of the Soul Cores of the mineral tree? It's impossible! They couldn't have all been dug out by the mineral-devouring bugs!"</p>

  <p>Not only did all the Soul Cores need to be dug out, but they also had to be dug out just a few days ago. Otherwise, they would have already been digested.</p>

  <p>It was too unbelievable for the Soul Cores to have been taken straight from the bugs' stomachs.</p>

  <p>"Your majesty, did you find a way to open the top-layer leaves?" one of the Soul Sea Realm masters asked after a moment of thought.</p>

  <p>Because all the masters knew how nearly impossible it was to dig out the top-layer leaves, they all wore cautious and excited expressions as they waited for the answer.</p>

  <p>With a chuckle, Turner announced, "Everyone, we have to thank Tianxing.</p>

  <p>He's the one who dug all the Soul Cores out, one by one."</p>

  <p>The words left the masters stunned. As for those who rushed over from the Feather Emperor Island, they all wore wide smiles on their faces. All were astonished by the fact— no one thought that Zheng would ever be able to take out the Black Star.</p>

  <p>However, even with the shock of the Black Star and the mineral tree, the shock caused by Zheng undergoing a tribulation was incomparable.</p>

  <p>After that, Turner told the Soul Sea Realm masters what happened on the Feather Emperor Island. And when the masters turned to Zheng once again, the look in their eyes shifted.</p>

  <p>Repairing the ascending passageway… While unprecedented, it was rather joyous news. Compared to this, exploring the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land had become a trivial matter.</p>

  <p>With that, Mario Zhou quickly brought out the spare spirit shrines.</p>

  <p>These so-called spirit shrines were small, extremely exquisite boxes. The top side was broad while the bottom side seemed to be more narrow, attached to four small legs for support. The most special part of the box was its material. When Zheng attempted to probe it with his perception, he was instantly thrown back.</p>

  <p>It seemed that the spirit shrine could not be touched by a warrior's soul perception.</p>

  <p>Resigned, Zheng stood quietly to the side as he watched the Soul Sea Realm masters busy themselves with arranging all sorts of things. There was no more question— the masters wouldn't refuse to let him enter the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land anymore. He only had to wait.</p>

  <p>After the spirit shrines had been arranged and placed in order, Turner began to distribute the Soul Cores.</p>

  <p>Because there were enough at the time, not only the Soul Sea Realm masters obtained the Soul Cores, but Fiona, Callan, Randy, Bram, as well as the other divine kingdom princes got the chance to have one.</p>

  <p>Only Fredric, whose soul was injured, couldn't enter the Divine Emperor Secret Land this time.</p>

  <p>After all the preparations were complete, War King Wind said, "Alright.</p>

  <p>This time, many of the warriors can enter the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land. This is probably the most we've had in years. You must do your best to occupy the powerful corpses! But that all depends on your ability to do so!"</p>

  <p>After War King Wind made his announcement, some of the masters sat down, cross-legged in front of the shrines before pulling out the Soul Cores in their hands. In the next moment, the Soul Cores began spinning, emitting a strange power.</p>

  <p>Then, they all threw the Soul Cores into the spirit shrines. The moment they sank into the shrines, a strong, attractive force seemed to shoot out from each spirit shrine.</p>

  <p>On the other side of the spirit shrine, a faint, black shadow appeared, catching everyone's attention.</p>

  <p>"The soul body?" Zheng's eyes flashed.</p>

  <p>Seeing Zheng's astonishment, Randy uttered, "When the spirit shrine is paired with the Soul Core, it can help us separate our souls from our bodies so that they can enter the tomb and occupy the corpses."</p>

  <p id="top_7">If a warrior's soul was powerful enough, he could take the body shell.</p>

  <p>But he still had to make use of the Soul Core to make any use of the corpse.</p>

  <p>At this time, quite a few Soul Sea Realm masters were already sitting next to the spirit shrines, pouring the Soul Cores into them. One by one, their souls were sucked into the shrines and merged with the Soul Cores before turning into a mass of black shadows and rushing forward.</p>

  <p>Randy, Fiona, and Callan also followed suit, pouring the Soul Cores into the shrines. Soon after, three black shadows appeared beside the shrines.</p>

  <p>From the silhouette of the shadows, others could recognize the three warriors' souls— for instance, while Fiona's soul seemed delicate, Callan's soul seemed to stand tall and strong.</p>

  <p>Witnessing the scene, Zheng proceeded to throw the Soul Core in his hand straight into the shrine. A moment later, he could feel a strong, magnetic force emanating from the shrine.</p>

  <p>It was aimed specifically at Zheng's soul. Instead of resisting, he allowed himself to get sucked into it.</p>

  <p>In an instant, Zheng felt his soul fuse with the Soul Core before it appeared on the other side of the shrine— it was then free to leave his body and roam about.</p>

  <p>After his soul left his body, Fiona, Callan, Randy, and all the others present looked over.</p>

  <p>The souls of Randy, Bram, and Fiona, looked a grey-green color— these were signs of instability. The souls of the Soul Sea Realm masters were pitch black, while the souls at the Fighting Soul realm were utterly stable.</p>

  <p>But Zheng's soul was blooming with green luster. The faint light emitted by his soul was the will of the great world!</p>

  <p>"Zheng, your soul…"</p>

  <p>Through her consciousness, Fiona tried to reach him.</p>

  <p>Zheng's soul had been hidden within his mind in the past— without entering his mind, no one would see it. But now, it was impossible for him to hide it.</p>

  <p>With a faint smile, he called to them, "Come on. Let's go!"</p>

  <p>At this moment, many souls that had fused with the Soul Cores advanced deeper into the Divine Emperor Secret Land, which served as a perfectly renovated cemetery.</p>

  <p>After the soul bodies flew for some time, they stopped right at the entrance where a lamp hung near the gate.</p>

  <p>"Everyone, wait a moment," one of the Soul Sea Realm masters used his consciousness to envelop Zheng and the rest.</p>
