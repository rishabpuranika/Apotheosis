<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The outer area of the Dark Nether Cave had always been dangerous to anyone who dared to delve into its depths. Luo Zheng was well aware that a lot of people who once entered never made it out.</p>

  <p>Both Fabian and Jarrod didn't have the intention of going inside the cave from the beginning. It was far too dangerous and the chances of getting out alive were slim.</p>

  <p>It took an intensive and advanced preparation for the warriors to be all set for their entry into the inner area of the cave.</p>

  <p>However, years of preparation didn't mean a guarantee. A lot of warriors, most of the top-level war lords, had faced their demise in the said cave.</p>

  <p>It was also believed that numerous resources could be found in the inner layer. Those who were lucky enough to return brought with them enormous gifts from the cave. That was why countless warriors took the risk.</p>

  <p>While the others aimed for the inner layer of the cave, Luo Zheng, being the confident warrior, wanted to go into the core area.</p>

  <p>That part of the cave was a totally different story. None of the few who dared explore that particular area was able to return. It was basically a death trap.</p>

  <p>As written on the map, the outer layer of the cave was marked with a lot of threatening areas. The inner layer had lesser. The depths of the cave was somewhat still a mystery. For whatever it was worth, not a single soul had lived to tell stories about it.</p>

  <p>As for the core of the cave, the map had almost nothing to offer the seekers of wealth. It was completely blank, apart from vague directions, and had no markings of any sort. Not that it needed to be marked, as everyone knew it was deadly.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, are you… Are you joking?"</p>

  <p>Fabian uttered, looking at Luo Zheng with a deep concern written all over his face.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng chuckled and responded, "Just take it as a joke if you will."</p>

  <p>When Mist passed the token to Luo Zheng and asked him to obtain the inheritance, he wasn't able to explain the matter clearly. Having not entered the cave yet, Mist didn't exactly have all the information with regards to the whereabouts of the inheritance. All he knew was that it was somewhere inside the cave.</p>

  <p>Mist told Luo Zheng that the Jade Butterfly would light up when he was closer to the item.</p>

  <p>Despite his carefree attitude, Luo Zheng was not of the reckless sort. He knew all too well that he was risking his life.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the Jade Butterfly stayed still. Deciding that he'd explore the outer layer of the cave first, Luo Zheng would enter the inner layer next if the inheritance was still nowhere to be found.</p>

  <p>Knowing that the core area of the cave was extremely dangerous, Luo Zheng was cautious with his every move. If he still wasn't able to get a hold of the inheritance in the core area, he'd leave.</p>

  <p>Being able to get his hands on the inheritance was his priority, as it was very essential for the human race. Realizing that he might not be able to obtain it considering his current strength, he'd stop at once. It was too much of a risk.</p>

  <p>When he heard Zheng's answer, Fabian let out a sigh of relief. Luo Zheng still had some sense in him. Smiling to himself, he said, "If that's the case, then let's keep following the original route!"</p>

  <p>Including Xun, there were only five warriors walking side by side. It was a good thing. Any kind of noise wasn't good at all. Luckily, they weren't welcomed by danger while walking around the outer layer of the Dark Nether Cave.</p>

  <p>As they went deeper into the cave, the air suddenly shifted. At the same time, the once dim red light began to grow stronger.</p>

  <p>The Dark Nether Death Light that had weakened still had some might left in it. Any ordinary human without any cultivation base could have easily been fatally pierced through by that light.</p>

  <p>As the red light grew stronger, a thin layer of life vitality protection appeared on Fabian's, Jarrod's, and Yolande's bodies. It was to withstand the red light's assault. Luo Zheng didn't employ his forceful energy, as he had his weapon-like body to protect himself. The red light could not make him feel uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, as the sword spirit, Xun was unable to feel any pain.</p>

  <p>As they kept moving forward for about an hour, the sound of a battle nearby could be heard. Then, six figures appeared from the bushes.</p>

  <p>Two of them who held longbows in their hands began to shoot some arrows towards the jungle. A black ghost claw emerged from the jungle, grabbing the two archers and throwing them in the air. Unable to escape, the warriors died almost instantly.</p>

  <p>"Leave! Hurry! I'll cover you!" a woman behind them said. Among the other warriors, she showed greater strength. The unknown warrior lady suddenly released the endless light that produced colors and flowers that quickly enveloped the place.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh… Whoosh… Whoosh…"</p>

  <p>Countless of colorful petals began appearing. All of them grew only to fly towards the ghost claw. In just a split second, the murderous claw was covered entirely with petals!</p>

  <p>"Explode!" the woman shouted.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>Upon such an explosion, the claw's speed slowed down. However, the remaining four warriors charged towards Luo Zheng and his group immediately.</p>

  <p>Their eyes were all focused on Luo Zheng. However, upon seeing Xun, one of them calmly said, "My Queen, this place is deadly. You must leave now.</p>

  <p>Come with us!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng surmised that they were all from the Demon Night. Including Esther, they were top-level war lords.</p>

  <p>"Let's go!"</p>

  <p>Not saying much, the rest just followed suit. The ghost claw wasn't weaker than the Bull-like Giant Toad. Thanks to Esther, they managed to escape.</p>

  <p>After all, Esther was the top warrior at the Tower of Sin. Even Maurice, was no match to her strength.</p>

  <p>"So, there are only four members of the Demon Night left?"</p>

  <p>Fabian asked, his face glinting with astonishment.</p>

  <p>At the Tower of Sin, the Demon Night had more seats than the humans.</p>

  <p>When they entered the cave, there were a few dozens more of them as compared to humans. How come only four of them were able to make it?</p>

  <p>"Tide of Chaos is waiting. I realized that it was too much of a risk. I decided to dismiss some of the troops and asked them to retreat," Esther responded.</p>

  <p>"Figured." Fabian nodded. "I also allowed them to return to the tower."</p>

  <p>Just as they all began moving to escape, the Demon Night members started to kneel down before Xun to show their undying respect. "There is no time. You don't have to do that now. This place is dangerous," she said flatly.</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you guys go back in the first place?" Fabian asked.</p>

  <p>"The Tide of Chaos has already broken out and the risk increases, but the chances might also come sooner than we have all expected," Esther replied.</p>

  <p>It was the ultimate truth. Despite terrifyingly dangerous, the opportunities grew. The arrival of the Tide of Chaos at that moment drove other vicious monsters away to other places. During that particular time, most warriors had the chance to explore some more.</p>

  <p>However, the dangers were also greater than before. Due to her outstanding cultivation, Esther dared to enter such places. Earlier, Esther, along with a few Demon Night members, had obtained several Black Nether Beads.</p>

  <p>The said beads were of paramount importance. Each of them equaled to a middle-grade sacred weapon. Obtaining them, Esther had paid quite a heavy price. Two top-level war lords of the Demon Night had perished.</p>

  <p>"My Queen, these two Black Nether Beads were obtained by us. Please accept them." Esther respectfully walked up to Xun and presented the two beads to her.</p>

  <p>Reaching the highest level of cultivation, Xun's soul, even just one of the many, was abnormally strong. The small part of her soul was still far stronger than many warriors from the Lower World.</p>

  <p>For that reason, it was almost impossible to nourish her soul some more. All the pills and techniques for nourishment had no effect on her at all. Even if Xun entered the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place and absorbed the life power of the entire holy tree, changes would be slight.</p>

  <p>Labeled as treasures from the Upper World, the Black Nether Beads were used to repair damaged souls. Xun knew that she could put those items into good use. Nodding her head to Esther's gesture, she let Luo Zheng keep the beads for her.</p>

  <p>It was the greatest of all honors for Esther and the rest of the Demon Night members that Xun accepted her offer. The Black Nether Beads could come in handy if Esther needed them, but they were absolutely not as important as Xun.</p>
