<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Previously, the Moon Fire Slaves had to make their bodies smaller and compact in order for them to pass through the first area.</p>

  <p>As soon as they arrived at the second area, their height of several hundred feet was quickly restored.</p>

  <p>No. 14 had a very simple and straightforward idea. He had planned on defeating Zheng using sheer and brute strength. Afterwards, he would cut off Zheng's arm that recorded the Other Shore Key.</p>

  <p>The Moon Fire Slaves were known as the Element Spirit race's slaves.</p>

  <p>Despite that fact, they still disdained and belittled the ants in the lower stages.</p>

  <p>However, things took an unexpected turn as soon as No. 14 sped toward Zheng. He noticed that Zheng's body started to expand. Out of nowhere, one of his hands grabbed the Moon Fire Slave by his shoulder and threw a punch toward his chest with the other.</p>

  <p>"Unbelievable! His hand..."</p>

  <p>At this point, No. 14 had forgotten to defend himself. He was utterly dumbfounded as he stared at Zheng's hand in disbelief.</p>

  <p>The armor of No. 14 became instantly disjointed around the shoulder area.</p>

  <p>As Zheng extended his hand further, it sank even deeper into the Moon Fire Slave's shoulder. It was entirely enveloped by the Magical Star Flames emanating from within his body.</p>

  <p>Everything would be reduced to ashes as soon as it came into contact with the Magical Star Flames within his body.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng's hand remained safe and intact! He couldn't quite understand how Zheng managed to touch his body without getting burned.</p>

  <p>While No. 14 was still completely bewildered, Zheng had thrown another powerful punch toward his chest.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The punch landed with a sickening crunch. The armor on No. 14's back completely fell apart and got blown off. Upon impact with Zheng's fist, the Magical Star Flames inside No. 14's body turned into a column of fire that spurted out from his back. At the same time, his spiritual core also shot out.</p>

  <p>It was almost impossible to break the spiritual core with brute force. This showed how much strength there was behind Zheng's attack.</p>

  <p>Once the spiritual core left the Moon Fire Slave's body, the body would ultimately collapse.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>No. 14's armor had scattered all over the ground. There were flames flowing everywhere. All that was left of his existence were bits of shattered armor pieces, flames, and his spiritual core.</p>

  <p>He had already collapsed before in the annular desert area wherein a large amount of stardust was consumed before he had recovered. And now, he had collapsed once more under the might of Zheng's blow.</p>

  <p>The Magical Star Flames flooded the ground and were gushing everywhere.</p>

  <p>Because of this, Feng Ge was forced to fall back.</p>

  <p>While she was retreating, she felt utterly astounded at what she had witnessed.</p>

  <p>She had no doubt that Zheng would be able to hold out against a Moon Fire Slave. However, she knew it wouldn't be that simple. How was he able to defeat him with just a punch? Meanwhile, Zheng himself was a little confused as well. He was surprised at how he managed to put a lot of damage to the Moon Fire Slave.</p>

  <p>It was well-known that the most important thing in the body of the Moon Fire Slave was the spiritual core.</p>

  <p>With that said, the spiritual core was usually wrapped in the Magical Star Flames. When battling a Moon Fire Slave, there were very few opponents who dared to penetrate the Magical Star Flames and take the spiritual core away, because if they did, they would definitely get burned to a crisp.</p>

  <p>When facing some formidable opponents, the Moon Fire Slaves would allow their spiritual cores to wander constantly all throughout their bodies.</p>

  <p>They would not let the most important part of their bodies stay in the same place all the time.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, No. 14 was reckless. It never crossed his mind that Zheng could become that huge and wouldn't be afraid of the Magical Star Flames.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Da! Da! Da!</p>

  <p>The spiritual core flew for a few miles and fell directly on the gobi. It rolled directly in front of No. 12.</p>

  <p>"I have the Other Shore Key right here. Who else dares to take my hand away?" Zheng said coldly as soon as he came to his senses.</p>

  <p>The Moon Fire Slaves and the Nihility race were maintaining a balance.</p>

  <p>Zheng had to let them know that it wasn't that easy to take him down. If they lost, they would be devoured by their opponents.</p>

  <p>No. 12 bent down and took the spiritual core in his hands. He looked perplexed as he gazed at Zheng.</p>

  <p>The woman inside the red ball also frowned. It seemed incredulous to her that Zheng was able to kill a Moon Fire Slave with just a single punch. Zheng's actual strength was really way beyond her expectations.</p>

  <p>If she decided to attack him, the two other Moon Fire Slaves would surely take action immediately as well.</p>

  <p>After weighing out the stakes, the woman broke into a smile. "I have to admit, I was very much mistaken. You are indeed very powerful. Who else will dare to take your hand? I think it is better if we go through this dangerous place and open the temple together. What do you think?"</p>

  <p>No. 12 remained silent. He was fully aware of their current risky situation.</p>

  <p>The three parties still had the power to fight each other. Eventually, only one party would benefit from this.</p>

  <p>Their best option was to avoid any unnecessary battles and just open the temple together.</p>

  <p>"Humph!"</p>

  <p>Zheng grunted begrudgingly.</p>

  <p>He decided to come and open the temple because he wanted to go inside it with Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>However, he had not foreseen that the temple had already been targeted by the Nihility race and the Element Spirit race. It was clear that this temple was very important.</p>

  <p>Zheng disliked the idea of the Moon Fire Slaves and Nihility Spirits getting inside the temple.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the woman was quite patient. She waited calmly for Zheng's answer.</p>

  <p>Given the strength that Zheng had displayed, he was truly qualified to become the third force of this place. However, he had no other choice. He had to agree to her suggestion.</p>

  <p>"Hmm. Since you don't decline my offer right away, it means you are agreeing to my suggestion. Well then, let's just bury the hatchet and become allies," said the woman as she withdrew inside her red ball again.</p>

  <p>The two Nihility Spirits began slowly drifting towards the center of the gobi and led the way.</p>

  <p>After putting away No. 14's spiritual core, No. 12 glanced once again at Zheng. Afterwards, he walked off together with No. 13.</p>

  <p>Zheng knew that it was difficult to escape this situation now. Nevertheless, he had no intention of escaping. He really wanted to open the temple. In addition to that, with the Nihility Spirits and the Moon Fire Slaves leading the way, he knew it would be much easier to pass through the gobi.</p>

  <p>As soon as the red balls arrived at the center of the gobi, they halted and the woman came out again.</p>

  <p>She stretched out her hand. Then, she gently and cautiously probed the air ahead of her. As her soft fingertips touched a certain area, the space in front of her became distorted. Instantaneously, an invisible force left a huge footprint in the middle of the gobi.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The footprint appeared right in front of her. It was only a few inches away from where she stood.</p>

  <p>"The energy soul of heaven and earth is very powerful. Once it is formed, it will be indestructible for a very long time. Many of the temples found in Stage Thirty-one are guarded by it," explained the woman.</p>

  <p>It seemed like she was saying this to Zheng.</p>

  <p>"However, it also has a huge flaw. Anyone who enters it will be attacked indiscriminately," added the woman as she slowly opened her hand and gently blew on it. As she did this, a blood red mist gradually dispersed from her palm.</p>

  <p>The mist contained a faint energy. As soon as the mist drifted forward to the distorted space, a strange scene occurred.</p>

  <p>Huge invisible feet stomped down from above and began attacking the blood mist.</p>

  <p>However, the blood mist was formless. Therefore, the huge feet weren't able to damage it all.</p>

  <p>"This area is heavily guarded by the energy soul of heaven and earth. In any case, there should be a path around here that would allow us to safely pass through it. The path avoids all the attacks of the energy soul. Normally, it can't be seen clearly by the naked eye. But while the energy soul is attacking the blood mist, we will be able to see it," she continued.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>As the attacks continued, the blood mist was able to outline the countless footprints that appeared beneath it.</p>

  <p>Among these seemingly messy footprints, a winding path was exposed.</p>

  <p>There were no giant footprints along this path. Obviously, this was what the woman had mentioned earlier.</p>
