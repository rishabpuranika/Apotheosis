<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a feminine laughter came from the chilling abyss, making all the martial artists nervous once again.</p>

  <p>"This sound… Where did it come from?" a warrior asked worriedly.</p>

  <p>Everyone heard the soft laughter but nobody could tell where it was coming from…</p>

  <p>"Hee hee…"</p>

  <p>Immediately, everyone heard the sound again.</p>

  <p>The soft laughter rose and fell, echoing in everyone's ears.</p>

  <p>"What the hell is that?" an ogre martial artist roared incredulously.</p>

  <p>Nobody answered his question; not because they didn't want to, but because no one knew where it was coming from!</p>

  <p>Zheng's expression was wary, but he still asked in his mind, "What is that?"</p>

  <p>Xun hesitated for a moment, then replied, "If I remember correctly, it must be the Snow Demon…"</p>

  <p>"The Snow Demon?" Zheng's eyes flashed.</p>

  <p>Xun smiled faintly and said, "The Snow Demon won't pose much of a threat to you."</p>

  <p>While he was pondering over Xun's words, a white shadow flashed before his eyes, before disappearing into the depths of the abyss!</p>

  <p>It was not only Zheng who saw the quick flash of the white shadow, everyone else saw it, too.</p>

  <p>"What is that? This white thing seems to be circling us!" shouted a warrior.</p>

  <p>"Snow Demon! I know it! This damned thing can only exist in the frozen land… Isn't the Snow Demon a kind of evil creature, which only exists in the Snow World!?" another fighter yelled in panic.</p>

  <p>As soon as the martial artist finished speaking, white shadows emerged from the walls of the abyss one after another. They seemed to have no fixed form and could freely travel through space, and these white Snow Demons maintained the same speed as the warriors. They circled the crowd of martial artists, getting closer and closer to them!</p>

  <p>"Everyone be careful! The Snow Demons can take over people's souls, and make people lose themselves!" reminded another warrior.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! This damned thing can make me lose myself? What a joke!" roared an ogre martial artist. With a wave of his hand, he threw out a saw-toothed rotating wheel.</p>

  <p>The rotating wheel had sharp saw teeth embedded all around it, and it spun towards a Snow Demon. However, it only penetrated the Snow Demon's body lightly, and did not cause any damage to it!</p>

  <p>The Snow Demon was a famous evil creature in the Snow World. It could transform into different forms and was able to know the most important person to a warrior. It would then transform into that person to mislead the warrior. If a warrior was enchanted by a Snow Demon, it would invade the warrior's mind and occupy his body!</p>

  <p>Zheng did not move. His gaze was locked onto a Snow Demon. He carefully sized up these white Snow Demons around him...</p>

  <p>First, they looked like beasts with strange appearances, but as they circled around the warriors, they rapidly changed their shapes.</p>

  <p>The number of Snow Demons was equal to the number of warriors left in the abyss, which meant that each warrior would face a Snow Demon.</p>

  <p>The warriors were at different heights, and Zheng was still at the bottom. In other words, he was the bellwether.</p>

  <p>He soon discovered that the Snow Demon in front of him was like a lump of snow, constantly melting while at the same time reforming its body. When the Snow Demon changed its form, Zheng had a peculiar feeling, as if it was spying on his heart.</p>

  <p>"Hee hee…" The Snow Demon let out a feminine laugh while changing forms.</p>

  <p>At this moment, it was not only Zheng who was staring at the Snow Demon, Xun who was hiding within Zheng's body was also watching carefully. She actually looked expectantly to see what the Snow Demon would change into. She knew that these creatures could read people's hearts, and as the Snow Demon spun around Zheng, it used its talent to probe his heart.</p>

  <p>This sort of talent was extremely rare. It was a skill that the Snow Demons relied on to survive. The vast majority of martial artists had very strong wills, so it was difficult to confuse them! Only after a Snow Demon read one's mind could it turn into a certain form to mislead its prey!</p>

  <p>Very soon, the Snow Demon's body turned into a pair of fair and thin arms, then came the exquisite waist, two slender legs. When the entire body was formed, the features slowly materialized…</p>

  <p>When Xun saw this appearance of the Snow Demon, she was faintly disappointed. Clearly, the person created by the Snow Demon was not her.</p>

  <p>"Yan." Zheng was slightly surprised to see his sister's face, but he sneered.</p>

  <p>Did the Snow Demon think that by changing into his sister, it would be able to confuse him? This Snow Demon wasn't going to be difficult to deal with at all!</p>

  <p>Zheng slightly raised his long sword and held it horizontal. An azure-colored lightning shot out from the hilt of Thunder Wind Divine Sword and twirled around the blade!</p>

  <p>There were many methods to restrain the evil creatures in this world.</p>

  <p>Since Snow Demons were not afraid of ordinary attacks, presumably the lightning that counteracted evil force should be effective!</p>

  <p>As Zheng lifted his Thunder Wind Divine Sword and pointed it at the Snow Demon which was approaching him, a trace of hesitation appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>Zheng was not bewitched by this demon.</p>

  <p>He had come here all the way from the Lower World. The first thing he did upon arriving in the Upper World was to find his sister using the Roaring Token. However, to his disappointment, there was no reply from Yan.</p>

  <p>There were only two possibilities for this: either Yan was outside of the supreme worlds and could not hear Zheng's voice, or she did not have a Roaring Token, so she was unable to respond to him.</p>

  <p>Either way, he did miss his sister a lot…</p>

  <p>In fact, the Yan in front of him transformed by the Snow Demon was quite different from the real Yan. This was because the Snow Demon had transformed itself based on the image of Yan in Zheng's mind and not on the real Yan.</p>

  <p>When someone missed a person for a long time, one would imagine the person to be perfect in his mind.</p>

  <p>Yan was the one that Zheng cared the most. After all, blood was thicker than water, and there was a deep bond between siblings.</p>

  <p>Ever since Zheng stepped onto the path of learning martial arts, he rarely had spent any time with Yan. As his longing for her increased, in his heart, Yan had become more and more perfect.</p>

  <p>So, the 'person' in front of Zheng was actually the Yan that was in his mind.</p>

  <p>Zheng knew that what was in front of him was an illusion created by the Snow Demon, and he also knew that it wanted to take over his body.</p>

  <p>However, he hesitated the moment he raised his sword.</p>

  <p>There was no news of her ever since Yan was taken away by the young man. Although he was determined to find Yan, he did not know when he would meet her again. Facing the fake 'Yan', he could not help but want to see her more…</p>

  <p>Zheng's heart softened. At that moment, a flaw appeared in his state of mind.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the Snow Demon's eyes suddenly shone with a dreamy color…</p>

  <p>When the dreamy color flashed, Zheng's eyes also reflected the same color.</p>

  <p>He was completely lost in the illusion. Zheng's entire body was blankly falling down.</p>

  <p>Xun was still curled up within Zheng's body, doing nothing to stop this.</p>

  <p>But the cyan dragon spoke up to him at this time, "Why didn't you remind Zheng? He should have avoided getting lost in this illusion."</p>

  <p>Snow Demons might be a deadly existence for martial artists with weak warrior spirits, but for a martial artist like Zheng, they were not too much of a problem. Especially since he still had Xun, the cyan dragon and other dragons in his body to help him.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon remained silent, but that did not mean he did not pay attention to Zheng. However, since Xun was very familiar with the Endless Abyss, it was her place to advise Zheng. The cyan dragon naturally did not interfere too much.</p>

  <p>But Xun hadn't stopped Zheng. Instead, she just let him get immersed in the illusion created by the Snow Demon. This confused the cyan dragon.</p>

  <p>Xun smiled faintly and replied, "That was Zheng's own choice. Since he misses his sister, just let him stay in the illusion for a bit longer and I believe that he will be able to come out by himself…"</p>

  <p>After hearing this, the cyan dragon couldn't help but roll his eyes, which were emitting a mighty aura.</p>
