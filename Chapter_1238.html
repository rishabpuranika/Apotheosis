<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Lamar was sent flying backwards, and crashed into hundreds of towering trees. The trees had already been burnt during the previous chaotic battles, leaving only carbonized tree trunks.</p>

  <p>After repeated collisions, an intense fire erupted from within Lamar's body. He finally stabilized himself and looked at his empty right shoulder. The shock and anger on his face grew.</p>

  <p>When he heard someone shout "Luo Zheng Luo," Lamar was even more astonished.</p>

  <p>Never in his wildest dreams would he have imagined that the skinny human in front of him was the one who drove the ogres out of the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Rays of intense flames spread out from Lamar's body. The high temperature immediately burned the thousand-year-old trees to ashes.</p>

  <p>Lamar slowly rose higher as he stared calmly at Luo Zheng with his huge eyes.</p>

  <p>His calmness was even more terrifying than his rage. By now, everyone knew that Lamar had finally begun to take things seriously.</p>

  <p>"You are  Luo Zheng Luo!" Lamar asked Luo Zheng and stared at him coldly. "It is better to see once than to hear a hundred times. You've just become a war sage, yet you have such great power. No wonder the ogres were driven out of the Tower of Sin by you."</p>

  <p>Back then, when Luo Zheng had chased a group of top-level ogre war lords out of the Tower of Sin, Lamar was furious.</p>

  <p>For the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place, being chased out of the Tower of Sin by a human war lord was absolutely humiliating. Therefore, those top-level war lords who had left the Tower of Sin were useless existences in the ogres' eyes.</p>

  <p>Back then, being reprimanded by Lamar, the top-level war lords did not dare to raise their heads. However, a trace of unwillingness could be seen in their eyes.</p>

  <p>At that time, Lamar could not understand why these war lords were not convinced. Now, he finally understood that he could not judge Zheng's strength based on his cultivation level.</p>

  <p>There wasn't the slightest trace of fear in Zheng's eyes, and he was wondering how to deal with Lamar.</p>

  <p>His punch had damaged one of Lamar's arms, but he understood that if Lamar were to activate the Raging Fire Domain, he would be unable to fight back.</p>

  <p>Once his connection with the great world was cut off, he wouldn't be able to withstand the attack of a Soul Sea Realm master with the help of his sacred weapon's physique.</p>

  <p>This was Zheng's hidden weakness.</p>

  <p>Lamar, who was slowly approaching Luo Zheng, continued, "Although I don't know how you did it, the power that you just unleashed is enough to make me admire you. It's a pity that you're only a war sage and don't have your own domain yet. I wonder if you can defeat me using just your strength!"</p>

  <p>Lamar was treating Luo Zheng as an opponent on the same level as himself, and there wasn't the slightest trace of condescension in him anymore.</p>

  <p>He didn't hesitate in the slightest. His domain formed from streams of raging flames spread out, and he charged towards Luo Zheng once again.</p>

  <p>This time, Luo Zheng did not stand on the spot the way he had when he fought Lamar the first time. Now that his opponent had unleashed his domain, Luo Zheng would not stand there foolishly and accept his death. He started to retreat.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Seeing Zheng's retreating figure, Lamar mocked him, "What are you afraid of? My domain? I felt it. The power of the attack on you seems to have been absorbed by some kind of abyss. You are afraid that I'll cut you off from that abyss, right?"</p>

  <p>Lamar's guess was somewhat correct, except that he had not realized that the abyss he spoke of was actually the entire great world. Luo Zheng had transferred the attack that landed on him to the Magnetic Sacred Mountain.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyebrows creased. Lamar was indeed very sensitive. Although he didn't know that Luo Zheng had fused with the will of the great world, he had come very close to decoding the mystery.</p>

  <p>And now, Zheng's withdrawal from the fight confirmed Lamar's suspicions.</p>

  <p>The Raging Fire Domain spreading from Lamar's body became even brighter, and the heat wave even ignited the forest beneath the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place. The entire sacred place was already submerged in the sea of fire, and now, under the heat wave, the line of sight was also refracted.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was retreating fast, but Lamar was faster. Many of the Demon Night members immediately became nervous.</p>

  <p>For them, Zheng's sudden appearance was their last hope. However, as they watched Luo Zheng retreating, their hope started dwindling. He alone wouldn't be able to reverse the situation.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng was about to get enveloped by Lamar's domain, a blue ray of light descended and Lacey's Water Pattern Domain cut down from above, blocking the path between Luo Zheng and Lamar.</p>

  <p>"Do you have to go all out against a junior? Lamar, aren't you going too far?" Lacey's voice was icy. "Your real opponent is me!"</p>

  <p>Lamar shook his head and sneered, "Lacey, you are not my opponent.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng is not some junior. Even though he's just become a war sage, he has enough qualifications to be my opponent!"</p>

  <p>"It's my honor," said Luo Zheng from behind Lacey, the dark golden longbow appearing in his hand and a black arrow once again affixed on the bowstring. He then added, "Lacey, find a way to stall this guy."</p>

  <p>When he saw the black arrow in Zheng's hand, Lamar's eyes twitched.</p>

  <p>Lacey had already seen the power of this kind of black arrow. If she could stop Lamar, it might be possible for Luo Zheng to kill him.</p>

  <p>"Alright! I'll do my best."</p>

  <p>Lacey bit down on her tongue gently. With a sway of her body, she ignited her blood essence and a dark blue tornado appeared in her Water Pattern Domain. Like hundreds of tentacles, the tornadoes charged towards Lamar.</p>

  <p>"Stall me? Hah! In your dreams!" Lamar gently pinched the air, and a series of flaming sabers shot out from his domain, instantly cutting off the tornadoes one by one.</p>

  <p>Just as the two Soul Sea Realm masters were fighting, the black arrow in Zheng's hand shot out again.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>The black arrow accelerated three times in the air and reached Lamar in the blink of an eye. But he was prepared this time. His body flashed as he narrowly avoided Zheng's arrow.</p>

  <p>Zheng's first arrow had missed its target. The second arrow arrived in an instant.</p>

  <p>Following this was the third arrow.</p>

  <p>And then the fourth arrow...</p>

  <p>Lamar found it hard to deal with Zheng's and Lacey's attacks at the same time. His strength was enough to suppress Lacey, but it would take him a while to take her down. In addition to that, the water-related cultivation method that she practiced was the natural enemy of his fire-related cultivation method.</p>

  <p>On top of that, he also needed to focus on dodging Zheng's deadly black arrows. He had lost an arm, so it was even more difficult for him to focus on fighting Lacey's tornadoes.</p>

  <p>It was a losing battle. Zheng's black arrows flew past Lamar's ears several times and almost pierced through his head.</p>

  <p>"Hurry and help Master Lamar!"</p>

  <p>When the ogre war sages below saw Lamar in such a dangerous situation, they rushed forward to help him.</p>

  <p>However, the Demon Night war sages would naturally not let them come up. Soon, the war sages in the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place once again started a chaotic battle.</p>

  <p>Lamar cursed violently. He never thought that he would fall in trouble. If this carried on, he would be killed by Luo Zheng sooner or later.</p>

  <p>However, three more beams of light shot out from the horizon.</p>

  <p>Three more mighty warriors at the Soul Sea Realm!</p>

  <p>But when Lamar noticed who the three mighty warriors were, he was ecstatic while Lacey's and Zheng's faces darkened.</p>

  <p>"Omari! Santino! Help me kill that guy who's shooting the arrows!" he roared while resisting Lacey.</p>

  <p>Two of the three warriors in the sky were the other Soul Sea Realm masters from the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place. Omari and Santino were chasing down one of the Soul Sea Realm masters of the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place� Chantel.</p>

  <p>Chantel was slightly stronger than Omari and Santino, and she was able to continuously escape their combined attacks. Thus, from the start, she had lured the two ogre Soul Sea Realm masters away from the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place. After they circled around a corner of the Sea God Continent for over ten thousand miles, they had finally made a detour.</p>
