<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 648 The Upper World (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Y...Young master?" one of the warriors at the Internal Elixir Realm from the Xue Clan called out to him.</p>

  <p>It was then that the young master of the Xue Clan instantly came to wrap his mind around what had just happened. If they were standing there next to him, it must have been a failure of a transmission. After going through such lengths, he ended up being made a fool out by that young man.</p>

  <p>Unable to hold himself back and control his temper, the young master of the Xue Clan yelled out, seething with anger, "I failed to get transmitted straight into the Upper World. What the hell happened? Where did I go wrong?!"</p>

  <p>"Young master, there's a crowd of people watching..." the warrior at the Internal Elixir Realm whispered under his breath to remind the young master.</p>

  <p>Upon realizing what the warrior meant and coming to his senses, the young master lifted his head up. In an instant, his face turned pale. There was a group of warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm hovering in the sky just right above him.</p>

  <p>Raven peered down at them and questioned the young master of the Xue Clan, "Little man, who was it that got transmitted earlier?"</p>

  <p>The young master of the Xue Clan might have been revered as a high-level warrior through the eyes of the nature creatures and warriors at the Illuminating Soul Realm, but in front of the best and strongest warriors of the Central Region, he looked like a lamb who was at their mercy.</p>

  <p>With that in mind, he had no choice but to answer Raven's question truthfully, "The person who has been transmitted away was a man at the nature level. I have no idea who that person was, but he was so swift that I got left behind!" Right after he was done answering Raven's question, the young master had a look of resentment written all over his face. He was having a hard time comprehending what Zheng had done to get transmitted while he himself failed to do so.</p>

  <p>"A nature creature?" Yudie tried to confirm, seeming to be utterly bewildered. 'This nature creature must have been a brave one. Even warriors like us at the Virtual Tribulation Realm have to take some time to get ourselves ready if we could be transmitted away. It is rather surprising that a nature creature was able to pull it off today, ' she thought, her eyebrows knitted out of annoyance.</p>

  <p>Without any clue whatsoever of Zheng's whereabouts, of course, she never would've thought it was him who had actually been transmitted. All things considered, there was just a tremendous amount of living warriors in the whole world! It could even probably amount to billions of warriors in this world and the actual number of nature creatures was innumerable.</p>

  <p>So, it would be quite difficult for Tia to guess the possibility of Zheng turning out to be that nature creature.</p>

  <p>Even though they all could sense something unusual, no one actually bothered to dwell on it too much. The top priority of the sect leaders at the moment was to acquire ownership of the Dragon Soar Arena.</p>

  <p>Lady Poison-blood then declared to the warriors waiting in the area, "We should settle down and discuss this peculiar occurrence. But first and foremost, shall we go ahead and come up with a decision on how we're going to deal with the winged dragon?"</p>

  <p>The winged dragon let out a mighty roar. The winged dragon was not merely a pure animal. It actually had a mind of its own. As the designated guardian beast of the Dragon Soar Arena, he sensed an ominous threat. Lying In front of this great number of strong opponents, it was difficult to survive, not to mention to guard the Dragon Soar Arena...</p>

  <p>Zheng could feel that he was floating in the void. Every single fiber of his being had been torn into shreds and was moving at breakneck speed.</p>

  <p>Soaring at such an unfamiliar state, Zheng even lost his sense of time and had no damn clue where he was.</p>

  <p>After quite some time, Zheng had the sensation of his body beginning to materialize, albeit slowly, much like a jigsaw puzzle. Eventually, his body abruptly trembled drastically, and finally, he had arrived at his destination.</p>

  <p>'Where am I? Where have I been transported to? What is this place?" Zheng had a lot of questions in his mind.</p>

  <p>Scanning the area, it was hard to miss the cyan city right in front of him.</p>

  <p>And as he looked back from where he came, he saw rows of transmission arrays! Lifting his head up and shifting his gaze upward, the transmission arrays stretched as far as his eyes could possibly see. From what he could wildly guess, it looked as though there were approximately more than a hundred thousand transmission arrays!</p>

  <p>"Such a huge quantity of transmission arrays!" Zheng found it hard to fathom that he could not help himself from thinking out loud. The sheer amount of transmission arrays truly astonished Zheng.</p>

  <p>From where Zheng had been residing, constructing a single transmission array would cost a great many supreme crystals. But from where he stood, he laid his eyes on a hundred thousand transmission arrays. How fascinating that scene was!</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon, however, did not even bat an eye. He told Zheng, "A single transmission array is connected to a Dragon Soar Arena. You might assume that the hundred thousand transmission arrays are quite a lot to take in, but the fact of the matter is that they are simply parts of our Genuine Dragon's world. By now, you should understand that this city was constructed for Dragon Lineage Humans like you! It is merely a fragment of your whole existence..."</p>

  <p>The Genuine Dragon constituted not just the actual dragons, but the Dragon Lineage Humans as well. The anatomy of these so-called Dragon Lineage Humans held Genuine Dragon blood inside them and they also had the ability to learn the most powerful cultivation methods put into practice by the mighty dragons. In truth, there were even a handful of warriors who were much more powerful than the Genuine Dragon!</p>

  <p>All in all, there was actually a vast number of Dragon Lineage Humans residing in the Lower World. That was the main reason why the Genuine Dragon decided to build lots of Dragon Soar Arenas acting as the passageway for the Dragon Lineage Humans in the Lower World to gain access to the Upper World.</p>

  <p>So, the best fighters of the Central Region were extremely eager to fly straight to the Upper World through the Dragon Soar Arena. When all was said and done, it was the quickest path that the Genuine Dragon designed for use of the Dragon Lineage Humans.</p>

  <p>Surveying everything around him for a second, Zheng walked toward the cyan city. At this point, a handful of guards riding on some strange creatures appeared and walked over to Zheng and surrounded him. The weird creatures seemed to be half human and half avian.</p>
