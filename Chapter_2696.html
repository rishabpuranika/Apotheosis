<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Doubt was written all over Luo Zheng's face. "The powerful Yue Clan?</p>

  <p>I've never heard of the Yue Clan in the Time Sea," he said.</p>

  <p>He had come to know a lot about the history of the powerful clans back when he had been in the Floating Island.</p>

  <p>During his time there, he had never heard of the Yue Clan. He felt unfamiliar when he first heard the name.</p>

  <p>"Because Nicholas killed them," Harold interjected as he pushed the door open, his eyes transfixed on the mouse's corpse. "Most of the younger generation from the powerful clans don't know about the glory of the Yue Clan in the past, or a man named Gregorio Yue."</p>

  <p>Beside Luo Zheng, Joy nodded and said, "Right. At that time, Gregorio was powerful enough to challenge Nicholas. Later on, Nicholas was forced to fight him, and subsequently destroyed his universe. After he was killed, his clan's Floating Island sank into the Time Sea. Since then, Nicholas has made a rule that whoever is surnamed Yue is not allowed to enter the Time Sea, which is why there are no True Gods with the surname Yue among the powerful clans."</p>

  <p>Naturally, Luo Zheng was shocked but he asked, "Nicholas is such an arrogant man. Was he actually so afraid of a surname? He's made a mountain out of a molehill."</p>

  <p>All the clans had very few Holy Beings even when trillions of years had passed. Why was Nicholas afraid that the Yue Clan would have another Holy Being? Such a thing was almost impossible.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps he was making a mountain out of a molehill, but perhaps he was not," said Harold with a faint smile, and then added, "Because there is a rumor that Gregorio hasn't died."</p>

  <p>"I've heard about that rumor too," Joy said and nodded as well.</p>

  <p>"Isn't that strange? Last time I checked, the Holy Beings will die once their universes are destroyed," Luo Zheng said in surprise.</p>

  <p>The reason why Holy Beings were able to stay alive was that they relied on their universes. Since Gregorio's universe had been destroyed, how could he survive?</p>

  <p>"Generally speaking, it's true but Gregorio's case is somewhat different.</p>

  <p>His spiritual beast is the unique Stone Mouse in the divine land, which has died many times and has been reborn many times," said Harold with a grin.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's brows slightly shot upwards as he asked, "So you think that Gregorio has been reborn, just like the Stone Mouse?"</p>

  <p>"Well? Yes," Harold answered.</p>

  <p>Truth be told, they didn't live in the same era as Gregorio did.</p>

  <p>Yet although Nicholas had banned everything related to the Yue Clan, he couldn't affect the other Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>Things about the Yue Clan in the past had been recorded and passed down from generation to generation.</p>

  <p>For example, Joy knew about the existence of the Yue Clan in an important book. The book contained drawn pictures of the Stone Mouse, which was why she was familiar with the mouse's corpse.</p>

  <p>"What? How come there are so many hidden stories behind this mouse?"</p>

  <p>Master Evil exclaimed. How did he not know about such things?</p>

  <p>He knew the origin of the Stone Mouse, but he had no idea that Gregorio was behind that mouse.</p>

  <p>"But you said the Stone Mouse was as powerful as a Holy Being. Back in the cave of the Vast Sky Region, it was just as strong as a mid-rank True God," Luo Zheng said in confusion.</p>

  <p>With a flick of Harold's finger, the mouse's corpse on the ground floated towards his hand.</p>

  <p>The corpse shimmered with a faint, orange light.</p>

  <p>"The Stone Mouse and Gregorio died together in the past. After the mouse was reborn, it was as strong as a Demi-holy Being. After Nicholas killed it, it was weakened again until it was just like a consummate True God. Later, it was said that it was reborn in a first-tier clan. After it underwent multiple deaths, it is now as powerful as a mid-rank True God," Harold explained.</p>

  <p>Some internal momentum spread out of his hand as he spoke, which merged with the orange light from the Stone Mouse. The two combined together and formed a unique image in his head.</p>

  <p>After a short while, light flashed across his eyes. He turned to the main entrance of the hall and said, "The Evil Ghost Region in the south."</p>

  <p>"The Evil Ghost Region?" Luo Zheng thought for a moment, and then said, "It's said that the Abyss Demon Region is linked to the Evil Ghost Region."</p>

  <p>Harold nodded. "The reborn Stone Mouse is on the edge of the junction of the Evil Ghost Region and the Abyss Demon Region, which is very strange. Why was it reborn in that place?" he wondered.</p>

  <p>The Abyss Demon Region and the Time Sea Forbidden Land were the most mysterious among the numerous forbidden lands in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Yet because the Time Sea Forbidden Land was located in the center of the Time Sea, the vast majority of divine citizens didn't know that such a forbidden land existed within their territory.</p>

  <p>The situation in the Abyss Demon Region, however, was different.</p>

  <p>The Abyss Demon Region had gathered the resentment of almost all the living beings in the divine land, and there were even many different legends about it.</p>

  <p>Over the years, the Abyss Demon Region had expanded quite fast, until it had occupied three other regions. Furthermore, it was still expanding at a high speed.</p>

  <p>After a few moments, Harold returned the Stone Mouse to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>In turn, Luo Zheng also released a strand of internal momentum and merged it with the orange light just like what Harold did. Then, an illusionary picture appeared in his mind.</p>

  <p>In the image, his consciousness seemed to have traveled through most of the places in the divine land and entered the Evil Ghost Region.</p>

  <p>In the depths of the bleak plain was a huge crack.</p>

  <p>The crack stretched long, and the Abyss Demon Region was located at its end. The Abyss Demon Region was an abyss that spanned several regions.</p>

  <p>Dark green smoke rose from the depths of the abyss and blocked all the views of the Abyss Demon Region. The divine citizens outside were unable to see the depths of the abyss, and because of this, the Abyss Demon Region appeared terrifyingly mysterious.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, he opened his eyes and said, "I want to go to the Evil Ghost Region."</p>

  <p>"Is it too dangerous to go out now?" a voice from his side chimed in.</p>

  <p>It was Yudie, who had been sitting quietly beside him. She felt uneasy when she heard that Luo Zheng planned to leave.</p>

  <p>She didn't know much about the divine land, only that her husband had quite a lot of enemies there. The last time he left, there had been no news of him for ten years. She was afraid that one day, he would really disappear.</p>

  <p>"The powerful clans can't enter the Soul Wilderness, the Everest Spirit Mountain, and the Swirl Forest right now, so they'll probably go to the Abyss Demon Region." Joy fretted as well.</p>

  <p>"I think Luo Zheng can make a trip to the Evil Ghost Region," Harold opined with a small smile and then continued, "He would have no problems protecting himself with his current strength. Moreover, although it is adjacent to the Abyss Demon Region, its entrance is in the Red Lotus Region, which is very far away from the Evil Ghost Region."</p>

  <p>There was usually only one entrance to each forbidden land.</p>

  <p>There was no way to enter the Abyss Demon Region from the Evil Ghost Region, and the transmission arrays of the powerful clans on the Floating Islands were also connected to the entrance of the Red Lotus Region.</p>

  <p>Besides, Luo Zheng had the mountain token in his hand. Even if the opponent found any trace of him, he would be able to return to the fairy palace immediately by using the mountain token.</p>

  <p>When Yudie heard that Harold was in favor of Luo Zheng going to the Evil Ghost Region, she could only lower her head and fidget with the hem of her clothes. Her eyes were filled with loneliness.</p>

  <p>Now, she was no longer the mighty leader of the Cloud Hall that she used to be. She had already fallen too far behind Luo Zheng. She couldn't stand the comparisons with him anymore.</p>

  <p>Most of the time, she could only choose to be silent in order to avoid being a hindrance to him.</p>
