  <p>
</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Myles was the only one who had survived among the five Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>However, his aura was declining and his face was as pale as a sheet right at this moment.</p>

  <p>As a mid-rank Supreme Lord, his strength might be slightly higher than the other four Supreme Lords. Nonetheless, one's strength was no longer important in such a chaotic battle. The only thing he relied on to survive was a wisp of luck.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Myles stared at the grain of sand with lingering fear. He had to admit that Zheng truly had the qualifications to be so arrogant by relying on the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>All of the Supreme Lords deliberately maintained a certain distance from that grain of sand, afraid that they would once again be caught by that black and white light band.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Supreme Lord Ranell had a sullen face. He had joined the fight earlier to save Supreme Lord Addison. It was unfortunate that he failed to save him and even got himself severely injured in the process.</p>

  <p>However, unlike all the other Supreme Lords who stayed far away from this grain of sand, Supreme Lord Ranell even approached it alone. His face was cold as he sneered, "The Desperate Melee is truly amazing. It is indeed beyond imagination. But I'm here alone, so you are unable to use the Desperate Melee on me, right?"</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Ranell was probing.</p>

  <p>He already knew that the Desperate Melee was just an array that would cause all living things bound up to kill each other. This type of array was not rare in the Upper World. Many great races had arrays with similar functions.</p>

  <p>For example, if a hundred people entered the Hundred-in-one Array together, only one person would survive. This person could also absorb the energy of other people's flesh and blood to strengthen his or her own body. This was the ogres' array to cultivate their elite warriors. The only one to survive the brutality would be an elite warrior.</p>

  <p>The Slaughter Feast Array had the same effect. It was being used by the Upper World's Blood Spirit race.</p>

  <p>However, normal arrays had no effect on Supreme Lords or even world lords.</p>

  <p>That black and white light band just now was something that not even Supreme Lords could break free from. This was truly unbelievable.</p>

  <p>Zheng looked at the overbearing Supreme Lord Ranell, a smile on his face.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'm unable to use the Desperate Melee on you alone. But what is the use of you standing here? Are you planning to guard here forever?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Ranell snorted. "There is no need for me to guard this place. A mere Soul Sea Realm warrior like you isn't worth dealing with personally. I will only send a world lord to guard this place. I'm afraid you will never be able to leave this fairy palace for the rest of your life!"</p>

  <p>The other Supreme Lords also agreed after hearing Supreme Lord Ranell's words.</p>

  <p>Tricking and killing four Supreme Lords was a heinous crime. How could they tolerate Zheng after he did such? Of course, they wouldn't let him go that easily.</p>

  <p>With how the situation looked like, Zheng's only method to deal with them was to use the Desperate Melee. It might be powerful but then it would be utterly useless if there was only one warrior guarding that place. Thus, sending just one person there to guard would mean that Zheng couldn't leave the fairy place.</p>

  <p>This was probably the Supreme Lords' only method to deal with Zheng.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Supreme Lord Ranell's suggestion immediately attracted the support of many other Supreme Lords. After a simple discussion, each of the Supreme Lords agreed to dispatch a world lord of their respective races to take turns in guarding the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>Among everyone present, the one with the strongest killing intent towards Zheng was naturally Yao. She immediately called Tanya and Maddox over. The two Demon Night warriors had been thrown away by Supreme Lord Addison, but they did not leave and instead maintained a relatively far distance from the Supreme Lords as they observed the fairy palace. Hearing the queen's summons, the two of them rushed over as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>Both of them were the first ones to see the mini fairy palace. After the two of them forced Zheng out of the Reincarnation Plate, he then stepped into the mini fairy palace.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, Tanya and Maddox weren't thinking much about the mini fairy palace at that time. They were under the impression that they could simply destroy the fairy palace after they had destroyed the Reincarnation Plate. Unfortunately, Supreme Lord Addison came and threw them away. They were full of desperation and self-blame back then as they failed to complete the mission assigned by their queen.</p>

  <p>As the situation slowly evolved, the two of them realized that the mini fairy palace was not something that they could deal with. Even the Supreme Lords had suffered great loss in dealing with the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>Four Supreme Lords had already died.</p>

  <p>Some Supreme Lords were already leaving when they heard Yao summon them. On the surface, these Supreme Lords said that they would send world lords of their respective races to take turns on watching Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, their true intentions were obvious.</p>

  <p>Sending a world lord to guard this fairy palace was just a small matter.</p>

  <p>These Supreme Lords already had other motives.</p>

  <p>Four Supreme Lords had been killed today. Not long from now, the Crowns of Destiny that disappeared with the four Supreme Lords would appear again. They were sure that the crowns would appear randomly in the corners of the universe.</p>

  <p>Zheng's mini fairy palace only had one Crown of Destiny, and that Crown of Destiny didn't seem to be of the right origin. After all, it was the 129th Crown of Destiny in the universe. Nonetheless, the deaths of the four Supreme Lords caused four more Crowns of Destiny to be of no owners.</p>

  <p>Four Crowns of Destiny were enough to create four new Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>It was enough to change the fates of many races.</p>

  <p>Having been arranged by Yao to guard this place, Maddox and Tanya also felt reluctance.</p>

  <p>Both of them possessed the strength of a grand world lord and their biggest dream was to become a Supreme Lord. For Zheng's Crown of Destiny, Yao had placed the two of them here to guard Zheng. Naturally, they did not have a share of the four Crowns of Destiny. One had to know that there were still thousands of world lords that wanted to obtain a Crown of Destiny within Demon Night alone. The two of them were the elite warriors among these world lords.</p>

  <p>Although they were unwilling, they couldn't defy the imperial order.</p>

  <p>Yao left wordlessly after making this arrangement for them. Honestly, she still couldn't accept her defeat.</p>

  <p>Xun just came back to the Upper World and she had made Yao's follower, a Supreme Lord, lose his life. However, Yao hadn't even seen Xun.</p>

  <p>Yao was more than sure that she would face the questioning of the Board of Elders once she returned to the Demon Night's base. The other two Supreme Lords of the Demon Night would also come to her and ask about this thing. The only way left for Yao to take back the losses was to take back a Crown of Destiny. She swore in her mind that she must obtain one of the four Crowns of Destiny.</p>

  <p>All of the Supreme Lords left in a few hours.</p>

  <p>The Middle Sky Region had once again returned to silence.</p>

  <p>For a while, there was only the deafening emptiness radiating across the universe.</p>

  <p>It was an indescribable humiliation for any Supreme Lord to return with a defeat in front of a Soul Sea Realm warrior. No one was willing to use the Roaring Tokens at this moment.</p>

  <p>Maddox was guarding the grain of sand. He didn't try to attack it. Even a Supreme Lord was unable to break through the fairy palace, and he was also unable to do so.</p>

  <p>To be safe, Maddox had even stayed several hundred miles away from Tanya. Otherwise, the light band of the Desperate Melee would lock the two of them, causing one of them to die.</p>

  <p>At this moment, a faint luster appeared on the surface of the grain of sand. The originally slowly rotating grain of sand began to rapidly spin, gradually expanding into a palm-sized fairy palace. This mini fairy palace continued expanding.</p>

  <p>Maddox stared at the constantly changing fairy palace without even a blink. The tiny thing had expanded all the way until it transformed into its original size.</p>

  <p>Both his and Tanya's expressions grew complex. He couldn't help but sigh. There was actually such a precious treasure in this universe.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>After the fairy palace had been restored to its original size, it continued to flee towards the north.</p>

  <p>Maddox and Tanya glanced at each other from afar and followed behind the fairy palace. Their goal wasn't to destroy the fairy palace but to keep Zheng inside it. Wherever the fairy palace ran, they would follow.</p>

  <p>Inside the fairy palace, Zheng had already entered a meditative state and began a new round of cultivation.</p>

  <p>The power of the fairy palace came from his master, which was also the first owner of the fairy palace. In other words, its power wasn't his.</p>

  <p>It was impossible for him to stay in the fairy palace for his entire life.</p>

  <p>However, Supreme Lord Ranell's words had brought him some trouble.</p>

  <p>If they really sent their world lords to take turns to guard outside the fairy palace, it would be equivalent to isolating Zheng from the outside world. He wouldn't be able to step out of the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Zheng couldn't think of a way to solve it. If he were to leave the fairy palace now, he would be killed instantly by the two Demon Night world lords. He could only make the fairy palace move towards the Northern Sky Region.</p>

  <p>Another voice suddenly echoed around him just as he entered his meditative state.</p>
