<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Barnard hesitated for a moment, but ultimately chose to retreat. The five warriors moved toward the surface of the water and quickly left the place.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng's eyes were closed, he knew clearly that he had just been targeted by five people at the Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>He was truly unlucky. Back when he entered the Sea God Continent for the first time, he had encountered a violent space windstorm and directly smashed onto the Heavenly Eagle Prairie. Now, when he returned, he had once again encountered a space windstorm.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Luo Luo Zheng had already comprehended the second layer of the Space Law. Moreover, his cultivation had also improved, so he was a lot stronger than he had been before. Even though the second space windstorm was more intense than the first one, he wasn't seriously injured. However, a lot of power of space had permeated his body, and it was going to take a lot of effort to expel that power out of his body.</p>

  <p>"These five people know their own limitations." Luo Zheng's eyes were closed as his pupils gently rolled under his eyelids.</p>

  <p>Just then, he sensed three people approaching and furrowed his eyebrows. Didn't they say that there were very few signs of life in the Chaotic Ocean of Stars? Why were there so many people coming and going?</p>

  <p>The three warriors who were getting closer to Luo Luo Zheng had also reached the Illuminating Soul Realm. Once they got closer, they plunged into the water.</p>

  <p>"Bess, I've found a Black Cyan Clam! It's right at the bottom of that reef!" Luo Luo Zheng hadn't expected to meet three female warriors. They weren't independent warriors but inner disciples of the Fish Dragon Sect.</p>

  <p>However, the Fish Dragon Sect's trial at sea was not only for independent warriors. Even inner disciples had to complete the mission.</p>

  <p>After the three girls took water-avoiding pills, they continued to swim in the sea. Dressed in feathered clothes and swimming agilely in the sea, they looked like three mermaids.</p>

  <p>"Yes, there is a Black Cyan Clam hiding under the reef! First, we need to? Ahhh!" One of the girls was talking when she suddenly noticed that there was a person sitting beside the reef. Her scream didn't travel very far in the sea. Seeing the panicked expression on her face, the other two girls became curious. They followed her gaze and saw Luo Luo Zheng, who was meditating at the bottom of the sea.</p>

  <p>"How can there be anyone at the bottom of the sea? Is he dead?"</p>

  <p>"Could it be that he's cultivating there?"</p>

  <p>"It's so strange." "Wait a minute. Look. He seems to be meditating and recuperating. Is he injured?"</p>

  <p>The three girls had great talents, but they came from a second-grade family in the east and had never received training outside. Compared with warriors who had faced life and death situations, these girls were much more naive and less cautious.</p>

  <p>Seeing Luo Luo Zheng sitting at the bottom of the sea, the three of them didn't feel afraid at all. Instead, they watched him with great curiosity. One of them even slowly floated over and gently touched his body with her finger, as if to confirm whether he was dead or alive.</p>

  <p>After feeling Luo Zheng's body temperature, they discussed with each other through their life vitality and decided to take Luo Luo Zheng to the surface.</p>

  <p>The whole time, Luo Luo Zheng didn't move the slightest inch. He was using all his strength to expel the power of space from his body. With his control over the power of space, this process wouldn't take long.</p>

  <p>The three girls moved Luo Luo Zheng onto a reef with all their strength.</p>

  <p>"Oh, my God! I'm so tired!"</p>

  <p>"This fellow doesn't look fat. Why is he so heavy? He's even heavier than a piece of pig iron!"</p>

  <p>"And he's keeping his eyes closed like a statue. What's going on?"</p>

  <p>The three girls were curiously sizing Luo Luo Zheng up.</p>

  <p>Of course, Luo Luo Zheng could hear everything that was going on and sighed inwardly. There were all sorts of people in this world. These three girls were truly too naive. As the saying went, curiosity killed the cat. If they continued to act this way all the time, they would soon get themselves into trouble.</p>

  <p>Just then, Luo Luo Zheng felt something unusual. He sneered as he thought, 'It seems I underestimated those greedy fellows.' He sensed that there were a few people approaching from a distance: the five warriors from a while ago and another three warriors who belonged to the later stage of the Internal Elixir Realm.</p>

  <p>The five warriors had already wanted to attack Luo Luo Zheng a while back, but they had retreated, probably afraid that they wouldn't be able to defeat him. Now, they'd gone and brought strong reinforcements with them.</p>

  <p>At one point of time, Luo Luo Zheng had found it a little bit difficult to fight with warriors at the later stage of the Internal Elixir Realm.</p>

  <p>But now, he could defeat them as easily as blowing off dust.</p>

  <p>"He's the one in front of us?" a warrior at the Internal Elixir Realm asked with a cold expression.</p>

  <p>Barnard quickly nodded. "Elder Hu, he's the one. He's seriously injured, and it seems like he won't be able to recover in a short time!"</p>

  <p>A warrior at the Virtual Tribulation Realm who was injured and unable to defend himself was a temptation for anyone.</p>

  <p>"He has just reached the Virtual Tribulation Realm. With the three of us working together, we'd be able to defeat him easily even if he wasn't injured! If he doesn't resist, I'll spare his life. But if he resists?" another warrior at the Internal Elixir Realm said in a shrill voice.</p>

  <p>The warrior surnamed Hu shook his head. "It doesn't matter whether he resists or not. We should kill him. If he comes from some large sect and we let him go, the potential for disaster will be enormous!"</p>

  <p>"Agreed! Elder Hu is right!" Barnard exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Soon, the eight people arrived at their destination. At first glance, all they saw was three female disciples from their sect on a reef, but then they noticed the man sitting beside them.</p>

  <p>Elder Hu frowned. As he slowly approached the girls, he berated them,</p>

  <p>"Bess Yuan! What are you doing here?"</p>

  <p>At the sight of Elder Hu, Bess stood up and said, "Elder Hu, we found a warrior here. It looks like he's injured."</p>

  <p>A sinister smile crept across Elder Hu's face. "Okay, I see. You can leave.</p>

  <p>I'll take care of him."</p>

  <p>However, Bess shook her head. "We're not leaving. Let's wait for him to wake up first."</p>

  <p>"Do as I said! Just leave. I'll take care of him!" Elder Hu said firmly.</p>

  <p>Bess didn't dare to talk back anymore. Out of their respect for Elder Hu, the three female disciples flew away with bitter expressions on their faces.</p>

  <p>As soon as they left, Elder Hu sneered and took out a long spear. The other two Internal Elixir Realm warriors also pulled out their weapons.</p>

  <p>They weren't sure how serious Luo Zheng's injury was. They figured that since he was still meditating now, he must be more than slightly hurt.</p>

  <p>Still, the three warriors at the later stage of the Internal Elixir Realm were on high alert. After all, they were dealing with a warrior at the Virtual Tribulation Realm, so it was better to be cautious. "Kill him now, no matter how serious his injuries are!"</p>

  <p>At Elder Hu's command, the other two warriors directed their life vitality, ready to launch an attack on Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng narrowed his eyes slightly and prepared to fight back. Suddenly, he heard a cry of surprise. The three female disciples had returned. "Elder Hu, what are you trying to do?" Bess asked.</p>

  <p>Elder Hu snorted before turning to Barnard. "Since they have a death wish, I'll leave them to you!"</p>

  <p>When Barnard and his friends heard Elder Hu's words, their faces immediately lit up. "Elder Hu, what do you mean by giving them to us?"</p>

  <p>Barnard asked.</p>

  <p>"Do whatever you want with them.Kill them after you finish." Elder Hu knew what was going through Barnard's mind.</p>

  <p>"Great!" Barnard and his friends were immediately filled with excitement. Ever since they had joined the Fish Dragon Sect, they had had to follow the sect rules and refrain from sleeping with women.</p>

  <p>Moreover, these three girls were at the Illuminating Soul Realm. It would be thrilling to have sex with them!</p>

  <p>The five men charged toward Bess and the other two girls.</p>

  <p>The three girls might be simple and naive, but they weren't idiots. They knew what would happen next if they stayed here.</p>

  <p>"Let's go back! We have to tell our master!" An expression of ruthlessness crossed Bess's face. The three girls turned around and sped away on the surface of the sea.</p>

  <p>The five men chased them with sinister smiles on their faces. "Go back?</p>

  <p>Do you think you'll have the chance to go back?"</p>

  <p>At the same time, Elder Hu finally made his move. The moment he thrust his spear toward Luo Luo Zheng, Luo Zheng's eyes shot open. He looked at the three warriors at the Internal Elixir Realm with a faint smile on his face, as if he was looking at three dead men.</p>
