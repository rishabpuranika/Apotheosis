<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4039 The Possibility Of Repair </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>According to Campbell, this place called the Night View Island was an independent Pure Sky Platform.</p>

  <p>There was no way to cross the Pure Sky Platforms. Once the passageway was destroyed, the pursuers could no longer chase the human heroes.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess judged reasonably.</p>

  <p>Both Zheng and the Primeval Lord of Heaven in his inner world agreed.</p>

  <p>"Since the passageway is broken, can't we fly there?" suggested Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>

  <p>The passageway hanging above was reachable that everyone could easily fly to it.</p>

  <p>"Let's have a try."</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess snapped her fingers and her shadow stretched out from behind her. It then turned into a blood-red bird and flew upward.</p>

  <p>At more than one hundred feet away, the shadow disappeared without a trace. It appeared to be swallowed by a monster in the void.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess narrowed her eyes, surprised. She shrugged at Zheng and said, "It seems that this place also belongs to the Jade Pure Realm."</p>

  <p>The area beyond the Pure Sky Platforms in the Jade Pure Realm devoured all the energies and materials in it. It was dangerous to fly there.</p>

  <p>Zheng looked at Campbell floating on the surface of the water and asked,</p>

  <p>"Master Campbell, can you find a way through this passageway?"</p>

  <p>Campbell didn't answer. Instead, he swam to the edge of the water and stretched out his hand to explore outside the passageway. "We can't pass through it," he said. "There's so much Void Dust in this area."</p>

  <p>"Void Dust?" Zheng asked with a puzzled look.</p>

  <p>Campbell replied, "The Jade Pure Realm is filled with dust that cannot be seen. You can imagine it as invisible dust, and anything that gets close to it will be devoured."</p>

  <p>The shadow that the Snake Goddess released was indeed devoured by the Void Dust.</p>

  <p>These people were subject to many restrictions since they were all from the chaos.</p>

  <p>The core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization was already of great power in itself. Aside from helping Zheng understand Sanskrit, it could even restore the white light dots in the Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>However, the so-called Void Dust didn't have a white light dot, so the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization was unable to decode it.</p>

  <p>The others attempted to access the area, following the Snake Goddess's example.</p>

  <p>Pearson released a living creature. It was a black bat from the Supreme Pure Realm which was highly toxic. Pearson wanted to tame it for his use after capturing it, but he had not succeeded. Therefore, he decided to throw it away.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>After departing from his hand, the black bat darted forward like a weapon.</p>

  <p>It didn't know where it was, but it was glad that it could finally get rid of Pearson. No one could catch its speed now.</p>

  <p>However, its excitement lasted only for a short while. Coming to its senses, it felt its body being devoured and quickly disappeared.</p>

  <p>Energies couldn't make it through the passageway, and neither could living creatures.</p>

  <p>"There is a way to deal with the Void Dust. Only the Spiritual Boat can pass through it, so I don't know what exactly to do," said Campbell after the bat had disappeared.</p>

  <p>Zheng and the Primeval Lord of Heaven in his inner world were saddened.</p>

  <p>The hearts of the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and all the other heroes sank after the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization translated Campbell's words.</p>

  <p>"So this Pure Sky Platform is a dead end?" Zheng asked hopelessly.</p>

  <p>"In a sense, yes." Campbell nodded and thought for a while. "Unless we find a way to repair the passageway."</p>

  <p>"Repair the passageway?" Zheng's eyes lit up.</p>

  <p>Seeing the excited expression on his face, Campbell smiled as he shook his head. "Forget it. There was a way back then, but over a thousand chaotic eras have passed. I'm afraid the material needed doesn't exist anymore."</p>

  <p>"What material?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>He knew that the material needed to repair the passageway was by no means ordinary, but he was unwilling to give up.</p>

  <p>The energy souls of the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the other people in his inner world were also waiting. As long as there was the slightest chance, they refused to quit.</p>

  <p>"It's the Eternal Twilight Seed," Campbell said. "It looks like a copper pea and it's found in the main world."</p>

  <p>"The seed from the main world..." Zheng murmured.</p>

  <p>In his inner world, everyone's face was painted with hesitation.</p>

  <p>When it came to the Abstruse Energy World, everything was extremely complicated. They couldn't do anything about it.</p>

  <p>"The Eternal Twilight Seed is very unique. It is actually a kind of metal but is also a plant. It is a live metal that grows up with superior stability," said Campbell, his hand patting the edge of the passageway. "After its metal branch stretches out, the hollow branch will form a passageway and a huge, flat corolla is formed at the end. With some simple pruning, it will quickly form a Pure Sky Platform."</p>

  <p>During that time, it was a mature plan to build the top of a world with the Eternal Twilight Seed. It was also a necessary skill for every world builder.</p>

  <p>Zheng raised his eyebrows slightly upon Campbell's mention of the metal branch. "Master Campbell, how big is the branch of the Eternal Twilight Seed?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"It will be this huge after the seed fully grows up," said Campbell, pointing at the passageway. The passageway and even the Pure Sky Platform sprung from the Eternal Twilight Seed.</p>

  <p>"But the branch that has just sprouted is about this big," Campbell said extending his arms.</p>

  <p>"Is it metal-colored all over, with flower on it?" Zheng's eyes glistened.</p>

  <p>The conversation between him and Campbell relied on the group of people singing in his inner world. Naturally, Campbell and the others couldn't sense his mood fluctuations.</p>

  <p>However, when he transmitted his words into his inner world, his voice was abnormally excited.</p>

  <p>Even the Primeval Lord of Heaven, the Snake Goddess, and the others also experienced violent mood swings.</p>

  <p>Campbell nodded. "That flower is the one that needs to be pruned. Have you seen one before?"</p>

  <p>On Zheng's right hand, an azure square appeared out of nowhere. He reached out his hand, gently pinched it, and took out a metal branch. "I wonder if this is the metal branch you mentioned," he said, showing it to Campbell.</p>

  <p>Not long after Zheng entered the Other Shore, he obtained this metal branch in the Sacred Mallow Temple.</p>

  <p>He had once shown it to the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the others, but none of them knew what it was.</p>

  <p>Campbell glanced at the metal branch and took it from Zheng's hand. "At least two thousand Pure Sky Platforms hadn't been completed at that time, and these two thousand Eternal Twilight Seeds must have all sprouted and grown into such branches."</p>

  <p>The metal branches were exquisite in appearance. They didn't respond to any energy, so they couldn't be used as Other Shore Tokens. It was believed that they had some magical characteristics yet to be discovered.</p>

  <p>However, they couldn't grow into Pure Sky Platforms without the world builders.</p>

  <p>In addition, normal methods couldn't destroy them. For more than a thousand chaotic eras, they had spread all over the Other Shore. Zheng had encountered just one of them.</p>

  <p>The Dreaded Eye Demons obtained a metal branch by chance. Like many other races on the Other Shore, they studied it for a long time but didn't find out how to use it. In the end, they hid it in the Sacred Mallow Temple as rubbish, only to be retrieved by Zheng later.</p>
