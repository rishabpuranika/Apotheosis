<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"But there will be tons of Faith Energy around. Can you really devour all of it?" Stuart questioned her, unwilling to give up.</p>

  <p>Looking at him with cold eyes, the woman shook her head slightly and answered, "It's none of your business. Just do as I say."</p>

  <p>The entire Abyss Demon Region was believed to be a negative Pool of Faith.</p>

  <p>All dead beasts would release their extra Faith Energy.</p>

  <p>Some of these Faith Energy would turn into divine might coins, while some would quietly nurture the entire Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>Therefore, over the years, the total amount of the Faith Energy in the Abyss Demon Region consistently increased. Although the rich clans had taken away divine might coins from the Abyss Demon Region, in comparison with the Faith Energy being replenished every year, it was just a negligible loss.</p>

  <p>But this time, something strange happened in the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>All the beasts, regardless whether they were powerful or weak, rushed to the Holy Beings one after another.</p>

  <p>By committing suicide, they meant to willingly offer their Faith Energy.</p>

  <p>Instead of spreading in the Abyss Demon Region, their Faith Energy was collected by the woman.</p>

  <p>After being stared at by the woman for a while, Stuart finally lowered his head and nodded helplessly. "Okay."</p>

  <p>Gallio had led most of the fiends to offer their Faith Energy.</p>

  <p>Currently, there were only a small number of fiends that still maintained their strength, and that included these three big fiends who possessed much Faith Energy.</p>

  <p>"What do you think?" The woman tilted her head to stare at Azazel and another big fiend. Their eyes met hers, making them feel the cold stare of death.</p>

  <p>Stuart had already given in to this woman, so there was no point for them to resist.</p>

  <p>Moreover, they knew that this woman really had the ability to take them out of the Abyss Demon Region, so they nodded at the same time.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, another battle was starting between the lofty mountains on the sixth stage of the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>Oink, oink, oink!</p>

  <p>In the sky, countless two-winged fire bats rushed over in all directions.</p>

  <p>They swarmed around like bees.</p>

  <p>"These fire bats are a bit concerning. Although they are not destructive to us, they have overwhelming explosive power. The explosion of a fire bat can cause injury even to Demi-holy Beings. And I can see there are hundreds of thousands of them around us now. We need to kill them on the periphery!" one of the Demi-holy Beings advised, feeling a bit scared upon seeing the two-winged fire bats.</p>

  <p>The two-winged fire bats lurked in a lava cave on the second stage of the Abyss Demon Region. Although they often appeared in flocks, there were usually about a hundred of them. However, the lava cave was so deep that no one was willing to explore it. So seeing hundreds of thousands of them suddenly flying out in the open now was quite shocking.</p>

  <p>"You can count on me!"</p>

  <p>Zeke immediately confirmed, waving his hands as he jumped up in the air.</p>

  <p>An enormous aura of soul pressure spread out from his body.</p>

  <p>"The Great Dominance Technique!"</p>

  <p>The soul pressure had no effect on all the members of the union of powerful clans, but it was quite effective when used to deal with the two-winged fire bats.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, each two-winged fire bat that was manipulated by Zeke's Great Dominance Technique turned around and hit the bat nearest to it.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>The two-winged fire bats exploded, emitting a streak of dazzling light in the air, and creating a shock wave enough to shake the space around them.</p>

  <p>As the Demi-holy Being explained earlier, the explosive power of the two-winged fire bats was terrifying.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, more than a dozen fire bats nearby started exploding as well.</p>

  <p>The scene was too bloody to behold.</p>

  <p>Although the other two-winged fire bats tried their best to avoid the shock waves caused by each explosion, they were soon manipulated by Zeke's Great Dominance Technique and exploded in quick succession.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>The deafening explosions resounded in everyone's ears.</p>

  <p>The crowd felt like they were watching fireworks, except there were no colorful display.</p>

  <p>However, what the Holy Beings did not know was that the invisible and colorless Faith Energy left behind by each bat after it exploded was gathering just above the smoky air.</p>

  <p>In addition to the two-winged fire bats above them, there were also all kinds of ferocious beasts running over on the ground.</p>

  <p>The members of the union of powerful clans were still trapped here.</p>

  <p>Of course, this was not a dilemma for the Holy Beings. After all, even if these beasts rushed from all directions, they were too weak for them to worry about. Even with their number, sometimes, it could still not be an advantage.</p>

  <p>Thump!</p>

  <p>A loud vibration suddenly sounded along with the explosions of the two-winged fire bats in the air.</p>

  <p>Thump! Thump!</p>

  <p>"Did you hear those footsteps?" Nicholas asked cautiously.</p>

  <p>The other Holy Beings started to get serious. They did not believe that it would be so easy to deal with the fiends.</p>

  <p>Soon, some huge figures appeared in front of Nicholas, causing his surprise.</p>

  <p>"Three big fiends!" he warned the others.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid there will be another fierce battle!"</p>

  <p>"Earlier, Nicholas went to great lengths to deal with Gallio. Now, three other big fiends appear out of nowhere."</p>

  <p>Some consummate True Gods turned pale upon seeing the big fiends.</p>

  <p>Even the Demi-holy Beings tried their best to maintain their calmness.</p>

  <p>Staying still, no one dared to start the attack.</p>

  <p>However, the Holy Beings all wore an expectant look on their faces. After all, it was too boring to deal with the weak beasts in the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>Their real opponents were only the big fiends.</p>

  <p>Thump! Thump!</p>

  <p>The three big fiends, including Stuart and Azazel, now stood in front of the members of the union of powerful clans.</p>

  <p>However, compared to Gallio, they didn't seem interested to fight. Even Stuart, who was in the lead, seemed to avoid getting into a battle.</p>

  <p>Nicholas and other Holy Beings could not help feeling curious, but they also became alert. They were afraid that the fiends would play tricks on them.</p>

  <p>Just then, the Holy Beings were surprised when the fiends started something that they did not expect.</p>

  <p>Looking at each other, the three big fiends smiled bitterly before stabbing their hands into their own chests all at the same time.</p>

  <p>"They? What are they doing?"</p>

  <p>"Are they trying to get themselves to explode?"</p>

  <p>"Gallio did the same earlier. Why do they all try to explode themselves before we even have a fight?"</p>

  <p>Countless thoughts flashed through the crowd's minds as they tried to make sense of it. No one knew what the fiends were doing.</p>

  <p>Although they felt strange, almost everyone retreated as fast as they could, knowing that the power of these big fiends' self-explosions was too terrifying. If they happened to get caught in the explosions, they would probably be smashed into pieces.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the explosions this time gave them enough time to retreat and save themselves.</p>

  <p>After the three big fiends' self-explosions, the impact that spread out was several times more terrifying than Gallio's.</p>

  <p>The rolling mountains were crushed in a flash, having magma burst out from their bottoms like fiery dragons crazily brandishing the magma on the ground.</p>

  <p>Although the members of the union of powerful clans had avoided the impact unharmed, they were dumbfounded, having no idea on what these three fiends were doing.</p>
