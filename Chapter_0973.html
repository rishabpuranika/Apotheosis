<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 973 It All Looked Fishy </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Xun turned around and darted towards Eddie with a spear in her hand. The next moment, she thrust the spear at Eddie.</p>

  <p>"A mid-grade sacred weapon!"</p>

  <p>Eddie's eyes widened in amazement. There were only a few low-grade sacred weapons in the Central Region. How could he not be envious when he saw Luo Zheng's sword spirit wielding a mid-grade sacred weapon?</p>

  <p>But at the same time, there was a hint of doubt in Eddie's mind. Didn't Luo Zheng's sword spirit use a huge sword? How did it suddenly become a spear!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's luck was truly beyond anyone's wildest imagination. Not only had he broken through to the Virtual Tribulation Realm, he'd even managed to obtain a mid-grade sacred weapon.</p>

  <p>"It's a good weapon. But it's a pity that this mid-grade sacred weapon will come into my hands in the end. All of your luck and your secrets will belong to me!" Eddie was certain that Luo Luo Zheng was hiding a huge secret.</p>

  <p>If he found out what it was, he would be able to become an emperor.</p>

  <p>And that was not all, he would even be able to attain greater power in the future. Eddie's ambition would not be confined only to the Central Region. There existed four divine kingdoms on the other side of the Chaotic Ocean of Stars. The world was boundless. Eddie had been constantly conquering regions his whole life, and his final goal was to reach the pinnacle of the world.</p>

  <p>Defeating Luo Luo Zheng was the most crucial step for him to reach success!</p>

  <p>Xun's spear was right in front of him but Eddie did not hesitate to counterattack. A brownish-yellow light flashed on his fist and shot towards Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Humph! Break into pieces!"</p>

  <p>Xun wasn't scared. The long spear suddenly jolted and emitted a wave of formless energy. An astonishing power burst forth from it and immediately destroyed the radiance emitting from Eddie's fist.</p>

  <p>Eddie looked at Xun in utter disbelief.</p>

  <p>How did Luo Zheng's sword spirit become so powerful?</p>

  <p>True, Eddie hadn't employed his full strength in this punch, but if a mere sword spirit managed to block his attack, it was incredible! How could he not be astounded?</p>

  <p>Xun looked at Eddie wickedly, "Surprised?"</p>

  <p>"You can actually speak?" Eddie's jaw dropped when he heard her voice.</p>

  <p>How could a sword spirit speak? He was baffled. He had seen Luo Zheng's sword spirit before. Although this particular one's sword dance had been incomparably exquisite, it didn't seem extraordinary to Eddie back then.</p>

  <p>The spear skills that the sword spirit had displayed were impeccable.</p>

  <p>Eddie was astonished beyond words.</p>

  <p>However, Eddie had recovered from the shock quickly. His expression became serious. He realized that the man before him was not as easy to defeat as he once thought he would be. He could no longer treat Luo Luo Zheng as an amateur warrior who had just entered the Virtual Tribulation Realm. It was just like in the past, when Luo Luo Zheng was only a martial artist at the Illuminating Soul Realm, and yet he was able to defeat a martial artist at the primary stage of Internal Elixir Realm. In fact, at that time, even a martial artist at the middle-stage of Internal Elixir Realm was no match for him!</p>

  <p>"You have surprised me," observed Eddie calmly but grimly. His face revealed confidence and he exuded a domineering Mu Ning. "As the number one cultivator in the Central Region, I have not been so impressed with anyone in a long time! What a pity, Luo Luo Zheng! You came back too early. If you had come two or three years later, I really would be no match for you!</p>

  <p>Ha-ha!"</p>

  <p>Eddie's Mu Ning became heavier and heavier, creating a suffocating effect on the people around. It felt like countless boulders were falling from the skies and crushing everyone.</p>

  <p>Many of the warriors in the Ethereal City felt their hearts tremble vehemently. Their eyes were filled with fear as they looked up at the sky.</p>

  <p>As for the thousands of common folks in the Ethereal City, they felt like they had been struck by something. Their heads became heavy and their eyes dulled. One by one they slumped to the ground, unable to get up.</p>

  <p>After several hours, they managed to open their eyes but they were still in a daze, not knowing what had transpired.</p>

  <p>But what Eddie had told Luo Luo Zheng was absolute bullshit. Luo Luo Zheng knew it would be best if he returned after he reached a higher level of cultivation. If he had become a top-level war lord in the Tower of Sin, he would be able to defeat Eddie, and might have even had the chance to kill him!</p>

  <p>But he didn't have the luxury of time on his side. If it were not for Luo Zheng's return, Eddie would have captured the young Miss Xi of the Xi Clan and he would have set up his Lustful Demon Array!</p>

  <p>What was more, if he hadn't returned, Eddie would stand a good chance of breaking through in the Life and Death Realm. And once he became a powerful master of the Soul Sea Realm, it would be impossible for Luo Luo Zheng to defeat him.</p>

  <p>"A mere Life and Death Realm martial artist dares to claim to be the number one cultivator in the Central Region. It's making me crack up!"</p>

  <p>Xun sneered and a dignified Mu Ning emitted from her. She didn't mean to release the Mu Ning, but the mighty Mu Ning naturally exuded from her as she had been the supreme queen for a long time.</p>

  <p>Although her Mu Ning was not as imposing as Eddie's, at that moment, he felt inferior to her!</p>

  <p>"You're only a sword spirit. How dare you have the nerve to be so arrogant in front of me?"</p>

  <p>Eddie threw another punch. Xun laughed, thrusting out the spear and obstructing another attack!</p>

  <p>Currently, Eddie was a warrior at the fourth level of the Life and Death Realm. One year ago, he had gone through the fourth tribulation of the Life and Death Realm and his power had increased since.</p>

  <p>According to the ranking system in the Sea God Continent, Eddie was already a fourth level war sage. But he was so strong that he wasn't just a common war sage. He was much stronger than Malcom, who Luo Luo Zheng had encountered in the Dark Nether Cave.</p>

  <p>Eddie had put all his strength into this punch, releasing the brownish-yellow light, which was filled with the power of the Earth Law. The radiance emitted from his fist was substantial, as if it had turned into a real substance that could be touched, instead of an abstract phenomenon.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Xun quickly dissipated into specks of red light and zoomed backwards along with her spear towards Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Xun's goal was only to hinder Eddie's attack. After returning to Luo Zheng's side, the red dots of light condensed again. Her slender figure rematerialized, together with the long spear, which she held in her arms.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was already escaping, but the route he followed was very strange.</p>

  <p>He was originally planning to run out of the city, but at this moment, he was heading in the opposite direction. He was actually circling the outer perimeter of the Ethereal City!</p>

  <p>Holding the spear in her hands, she set her sharp eyes on Mu Ning, staring at her insolently with a faintly mocking expression.</p>

  <p>She had long since considered Mu Ning to be a pain in the ass. Mu Ning was a delicate and charming young girl, but at the same time, she never knew when to stop and was full of herself. Xun was hot-tempered, and she would've killed this woman the first time she saw her. That way she wouldn't have become the burden that she was on Luo Luo Zheng now.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was weaker than Eddie right now, but it was not difficult for him to escape using his full strength. But, he still had to carry his 'burden' when he escaped.</p>

  <p>Xun knew Luo Luo Zheng well. He wouldn't kill an innocent person recklessly, and he also had a soft spot for women. So she couldn't kill this girl? it would only anger Luo Luo Zheng more.</p>

  <p>"You...why are you looking at me like that?" Mu Ning felt flustered under Xun's menacing gaze.</p>

  <p>Xun sneered, "You are not afraid of death, right? Why are you still holding on to Luo Luo Zheng so tightly?"</p>

  <p>At first, Mu Ning was not very happy about being carried by Luo Luo Zheng, however, as he was flying extremely fast, she had now firmly and instinctively grabbed his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"I?" Xi Youqin's face darkened. She did not know how to respond to Xun's jibes. She paused to think, and an idea struck her. Her stubborn temper rose again. "Luo Luo Zheng, let me down," she commanded.</p>

  <p>"Let you down?" Xun blinked and said, "Let you off so that Eddie can catch you and set up the Lustful Demon Array? You aren't important, but Yan is a hundred times more important than you!"</p>

  <p>From Luo Zheng's point of view, it was indeed so. It didn't matter to him whether Mu Ning was dead or alive. He only wanted to take her away for the sake of his sister.</p>

  <p>"Then...then just kill me!" It was then that Mu Ning truly understood that there was no other path in front of her. She was either to die or just to tolerate all this.</p>

  <p>"Xun, stop. That's enough for her," Luo Luo Zheng said nonchalantly.</p>

  <p>He didn't know why Xun was intentionally irritating Mu Ning. She might be doing it just to mock the young lady and make him give up on her and, maybe even kill her. But Luo Luo Zheng would not let that happen.</p>

  <p>Although the world of martial artists was cruel, Luo Luo Zheng could choose what he could and couldn't do. Xun's solution would indeed be the safest and easiest one, but Luo Luo Zheng did not want this innocent young girl to lose her life!</p>

  <p>He circled in the sky above the Ethereal City with Mu Ning in his arms.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Eddie was closing the distance between them. Just as Luo Luo Zheng leaped into a palace-like building in the Ethereal City, he suddenly stopped and turned around to face Eddie, a strange smile playing on his face.</p>

  <p>Eddie became more alert when he saw Luo Luo Zheng stopping suddenly. This kid couldn't have just given up and wait to be captured. It all looked fishy.</p>
