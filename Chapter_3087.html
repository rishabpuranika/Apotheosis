<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3087 Luo Zheng's Eye </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Over ten enormous balls of light appeared in the air, flashing brightly.</p>

  <p>Suddenly they stopped.</p>

  <p>Fergus remained floating, the Wild Snow Sword by his side.</p>

  <p>Moments after he launched his fierce attacks, he had to stop, gasping for air.</p>

  <p>His physical body, overweight and weak, could not withstand the strain of his own attacks. He was fatigued.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stood across him, expressionless, a sword clasped in one hand. Tilting his head, he said, "Is that all you have?"</p>

  <p>"Who...who are you?" Fergus asked, still wheezing.</p>

  <p>He faced Luo Zheng and pretended to be unfazed, but a trace of fear had entered his heart.</p>

  <p>Not even the best and most extraordinary young men in the Taiyi Heaven Palace were as powerful as this man.</p>

  <p>"Why should I answer that?" Luo Zheng asked, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>Fergus ground his teeth, frustrated.</p>

  <p>Whatever else they might be accused of, the members of the Taiyi Heaven Palace were not foolish, and Dragon City was not just a tourist spot.</p>

  <p>The Dragon City had been carefully planned. Everything in that bewitched city was designed to attract the most talented humans, and the rules set in place were intended to develop their abilities and identify out the most worthy among them.</p>

  <p>Fergus knew all this very well, as he had been an inhabitant of the Dragon City for many years.</p>

  <p>And he knew that a man possessing even half of Luo Zheng's strength would surely have been chosen by the Taiyi Heaven Palace immediately. It was impossible that such talent would go unnoticed for too long in the Dragon City.</p>

  <p>Fergus realized he might just be outmatched, but there was no way for him to retreat.</p>

  <p>Staring at Luo Zheng, he clenched his jaw and tapped the top of his own head. A white bone appeared above him.</p>

  <p>It was the unique Frosty Jade Bone on Stage Five of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>As soon as the Other Shore Token appeared, gleaming white frost began forming on the Wild Snow Sword in Fergus's hand.</p>

  <p>"You are quite strong, especially for someone who has just reached the Other Shore Realm. Warriors like you are rare even in the Taiyi Heaven Palace." Fergus' voice was low and cold, with a tone that had caused many a young man to tremble with dread.</p>

  <p>"But you are not wise. Far from it." As he spoke, he raised his hand and pointed the Wild Snow Sword at Luo Zheng. He wore a strange, cruel expression.</p>

  <p>"You should have cultivated to develop your powers properly. Maybe in a year or so, you'll be able to defeat me, but right now you can't!"</p>

  <p>Fergus was not nearly as confident as he pretended to be, but he set his misgivings aside.</p>

  <p>He had already decided to keep fighting Luo Zheng. He had always enjoyed defeating and suppressing young talents.</p>

  <p>"Frigid Sword Prison!" he shouted.</p>

  <p>The Truths of Divine Dao and the swordsmanship manuals had the same big flaw.</p>

  <p>It was difficult for them to perfectly match with the Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, for instance, had fused with the demonic eye through the Truth of Cultivation Nature. But they didn't match each other perfectly. Though the demonic eye resisted the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent but accepted the Truth of Cultivation Nature, a more perfect match for the demonic eye would be the Truth of Goodwill and Malice.</p>

  <p>Some people had devoted their time to studying the truth swordsmanship manuals, but later they found that they had fused with an Other Shore Token that didn't match properly with the truth swordsmanship, and they were very upset about it.</p>

  <p>For the Heart Flow Sect, however, this was not a problem.</p>

  <p>This particular sect allowed its disciples to do whatever they wanted. Each of them was capable of comprehending the most suitable token in the Flow Tower.</p>

  <p>Their theurgies were of their own creation with the help of the Flow Tower.</p>

  <p>And so every member of the Heart Flow Sect comprehended a unique token.</p>

  <p>A clatter sounded.</p>

  <p>As Fergus brandished his sword, icy sword shadows began spreading across the place.</p>

  <p>The icy sword shadows fused and interlocked with each other, forming an ice prison. Luo Zheng was trapped inside.</p>

  <p>The ice prison began shrinking rapidly. Luo Zheng would be chopped into pieces by the sharp edges of the icy sword shadows.</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't be able to resist this strike," Ioan said, shaking his head as he assessed his own skills.</p>

  <p>"If I gave it my all, I would probably be able to resist the Flow Strike, but this sword attack is beyond my capabilities. I would definitely die," Walter agreed.</p>

  <p>Someone else said, "As for me, the first strike would have killed me already." While witnessing the battle between Luo Zheng and Fergus, some of the Alliance Chiefs had believed that they were no match for Fergus. His strength was on a far different level than theirs.</p>

  <p>Galen, who had been hit early by Fergus, was just getting up from the ground.</p>

  <p>He had felt indignant at first, wanting to show Fergus what he could do. But the demonstration of power by Fergus and Luo Zheng had surprised him.</p>

  <p>There was no way a person of his level could hold his own in a battle like this.</p>

  <p>Had he sought to join the fight on Fergus' side, he probably wouldn't have been able to withstand Luo Zheng's sword attack.</p>

  <p>"The sword prison should be on the same level as the third floor of the Sword Tower."</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, as Luo Zheng saw the icy cage shrinking around him, he allowed his body to become unusually flexible. He darted and jumped past the icy sword shadows with lightning speed.</p>

  <p>When there were icy sword shadows in his path that he couldn't avoid, he raised his sword and launched the Three Annihilation Strike, smashing the obstacles into pieces.</p>

  <p>Fergus cast a stern glance at Luo Zheng who floated in the Frigid Sword Prison.</p>

  <p>With his eyes wide open, he entered the Frigid Sword Prison, floating back and forth among the icy sword shadows.</p>

  <p>The shards of ice were bright and reflective. As soon as he entered, hundreds of mirror images of Fergus appeared in the Frigid Sword Prison, and it was impossible to tell which one was the real person.</p>

  <p>The Frigid Sword Prison could trap an enemy. If the person inside could fight off the icy sword shadows, then the icy cage would still be useful in launching an attack impossible to defend against. As for Fergus, he was the one who could kill his enemy inside the cage.</p>

  <p>"If your force is, at most, twenty Jun, then you won't be able to resist this!" Fergus shouted. His voice echoed and bounced off the icy sword shadows, adding to the confusion of his reflected images.</p>

  <p>Vigorously, Fergus began drawing out the power of the Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>Small cracks formed on the surface of the Frosty Jade Bone.</p>

  <p>This was because the Other Shore Token also had limits. Extracting too much power from the token would damage it. Then a large amount of divine crystals would be necessary to repair and replenish the power of the Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>The most common Other Shore Token of Stage Five could have force of fifteen Jun. In comparison, the Frosty Jade Bone was quite strong. If all its power were extracted in a single blow, it could reach well over forty Jun. Fergus intended to do just that. He would use all the power of the token to launch the Flow Strike, and it would make the attack extremely forceful and terrifying.</p>

  <p>He swished his sword.</p>

  <p>Under the cover of the icy sword shadows and his multiple reflections, he rushed towards Luo Zheng, determined to launch a final blow.</p>

  <p>This was his best and only plan. He had already exhausted all his strength in this attack, and he had to finish Luo Zheng off right now.</p>

  <p>'This strike is strong, and troublesome for me, '</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng thought. Even as he twisted and turned among the icy sword shadows, he kept an eye on the hundreds of fat figures reflected in the shards around him, wondering in which direction Fergus would attack.</p>

  <p>In terms of force alone, Luo Zheng believed that he was at least evenly matched with Fergus. But the nature of this attack was unusual, and difficult to overcome. He honestly couldn't tell which one among the figures floating around him was the real Fergus.</p>

  <p>If he didn't figure it out as soon as possible, Fergus would be able to kill him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng made a decision. As the shards closed in on him, the images of Fergus drew closer and closer. He narrowed his right eye. A ray of red light formed in his pupil, growing brighter and brighter.</p>

  <p>Fergus saw that Luo Zheng was squinting his right eye, and his heart skipped a beat. He did not understand what power this was, but he could sense the great threat hidden in the depths of that eye.</p>

  <p>However, there was no chance of backing down at this point. He had already deployed the Flow Strike.</p>

  <p>There was a loud bang.</p>

  <p>As Fergus drove forward, brandishing his Wild Snow Sword, the icy sword shadows splintered into shards.</p>

  <p>In the same instant, Luo Zheng fully opened his right eye, emitting a beam of vivid red light.</p>

  <p>Fergus saw the red light and he faltered in his lunge, his entire body trembling.</p>

  <p>Fergus was not the only one affected. Everyone present had seen the red light in Luo Zheng's eye, and everyone was affected by it. They felt as though they had seen something dreadful and unbearable. Even the most courageous among them would be unable to look into Luo Zheng's terrifying eye.</p>
