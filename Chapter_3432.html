<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Mount used his spatial transference again and appeared behind Yan.</p>

  <p>The space cage was thirty feet high, and as his fingers made contact with its surface, it began to crack in a million different directions before splitting into pieces.</p>

  <p>Yan didn't understand why Mount would release her now. Just as she had begun questioning all this, another figure appeared on the other side. It was the Evil God!</p>

  <p>Yan had regarded Mount as the enemy after he banished Luo Zheng, but her hatred for the Evil God was far stronger!</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>Without hesitation, countless energy beams materialized from the shadow of Snake Goddess behind her and slashed at the Evil God.</p>

  <p>The energy beams were so incredibly powerful that they would surely have killed the ordinary warriors at the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>The Evil God sneered at the beams charging at him. "Don't be a fool."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, the shadow of Snake Goddess behind him flew towards Yan.</p>

  <p>Countless blood red energy beams converged together, like octopuses entangled in battle.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, a winner was decided.</p>

  <p>The Evil God's energy beams had split Yan's!</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>Yan's face was awash with confusion.</p>

  <p>Her shadow of Snake Goddess was the most powerful. No one in the same realm could surpass her in terms of blood, yet she was defeated. It didn't make sense!</p>

  <p>"That's impossible!"</p>

  <p>Natalie exclaimed, her eyes widened. This shocked other members of the Snake Goddess race as well.</p>

  <p>Even if the Evil God could replicate anyone's blood, his bloodline token still shouldn't be as powerful as Yan's. But now, it seemed he could quite easily surpass Yan.</p>

  <p>Mount stood behind Yan, calmly watching on.</p>

  <p>The fight between the shadows of Snake Goddess did not concern him.</p>

  <p>Fuxi would most certainly get involved, if the Evil God showed any intention to kill Yan.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The Evil God manipulated his shadow of Snake Goddess to overwhelm Yan's, crushing it before sweeping forward.</p>

  <p>Yan had resigned to retreat when suddenly, the energy beams disappeared.</p>

  <p>They had gone through the space Yan was in and rushed out behind her towards Mount.</p>

  <p>"He's so cunning!"</p>

  <p>Mount thought the arrogant Evil God would try to kill Yan. He hadn't expected him to let her go and hone in on him instead.</p>

  <p>The Evil God might have looked wild and unruly, but he was actually quite calculated and focused.</p>

  <p>Fuxi had punished him before he entered the Chaotic Source World and he knew he was no match for him now. So, he made a wise decision.</p>

  <p>At least this woman called Yan couldn't be killed, or his chances of escaping the Icy Snow Province would probably be non-existent.</p>

  <p>Of course, the Evil God was not as wise as Mount. Mount understood the relationship between Yan and the Li Shan mountain and used this knowledge to lure Fuxi into the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>But the Evil God's instincts told him to not take the risk.</p>

  <p>Mount was now left with no choice but to use the Grand Teleportation again.</p>

  <p>After teleporting three or four times, they had ended up at the edge of this world created by Evil God.</p>

  <p>The Evil God had predicted with great accuracy where Mount would teleport to and had gotten there before even he had. Scarlet energy beams turned into sharp spears and rushed towards Mount.</p>

  <p>If Mount could use the Other Shore Token to activate the Other Shore Power, this attack would not scare him in the slightest.</p>

  <p>But he couldn't.</p>

  <p>As the Evil God had all his attention fixed on Mount, wisps of soft hair suddenly wrapped around his leg, pulled him and threw him away.</p>

  <p>"Uncle Mount, I'm back!" Mya said with a smile stretched across her face.</p>

  <p>She was unwillingly teleported outside of the core area and had now hurried back.</p>

  <p>She used her long hair to throw the Evil God away on seeing him attack Mount.</p>

  <p>She felt proud to have saved him.</p>

  <p>"Watch out!" Mount yelled at her desperately.</p>

  <p>He sped towards her in an attempt to teleport her away but it was no use.</p>

  <p>Mya was not aware of the danger in front of her. The Evil God gently hooked his finger and connected the two spaces. The blood red energy beams had passed through the space and pierced through Mya's body.</p>

  <p>Phew! Phew! Phew!</p>

  <p>Mya's face went pale and petrified when she saw the energy beams burst out through her chest. She looked at Mount in despair, not daring to move a muscle.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Just a moment later, her body was torn apart and fell rapidly.</p>

  <p>Everyone outside the Chaotic Source World exclaimed in shock and terror.</p>

  <p>All the leaders of the Divine Farmer race went ghastly pale.</p>

  <p>Mya was their most powerful member.</p>

  <p>Mount was powerful too, but he had a special background and this made him different from the ordinary members of the Divine Farmer race.</p>

  <p>Mya's death was the last thing in the world on their minds. This would be difficult to explain on their return.</p>

  <p>"Look at this! Whoever dares get in the way while I fight will meet a horrific demise, just like this!" the Evil God mocked as he glared at the broken corpse lying on the ground.</p>

  <p>Mount quietly rose up in the air, bubbling with rage like a volcano on the brink of eruption.</p>

  <p>Thin lines glittering with an orange glow appeared on his body. The space around him began trembling.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The space around him collapsed into pieces.</p>

  <p>They did not disappear, but hovered around him like sharp glazed tiles.</p>

  <p>"Using the broken space as a weapon?" The Evil God's eyes lit up with excitement.</p>

  <p>The more powerful Mount's bloodline token was, the more excited the Evil God was.</p>

  <p>He could give full play to other people's bloodline theurgies. Some bloodlines even enhanced the power of other bloodlines.</p>

  <p>This was why his shadow of Snake Goddess was stronger than Yan's; he had mixed it with the bloodlines of the Moon Spirit race and another large race. It was possible, at that time, he was the only one to have mixed several bloodlines.</p>

  <p>Among all the bloodlines, Mount's was the most mysterious.</p>

  <p>Till now, the Evil God could only call forth thirty percent of its power, but he was curious about what would happen if he pushed it to its limit.</p>

  <p>Everyone in the core area, including the disciples of the Li Shan mountain and the Taiyi Heaven Palace, all hoped that Mount was able to triumph over the Evil God.</p>

  <p>In another void, half a giant hand floated silently.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng darted to the side of it.</p>

  <p>He reached out and gently removed some amber crystals from the smooth and neat crack on the giant hand.</p>

  <p>"Wow, it's no wonder the body of the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits is so tough. There are more than one thousand crystals in this hand," Luo Zheng murmured to himself.</p>

  <p>After putting all the amber crystals into the space ring, he began surveying his surroundings.</p>

  <p>It was a dark place with a dreadfully silent environment.</p>

  <p>Vague shapes of objects could be seen in the distance, and even further than that, lines with a faint luster were visible.</p>

  <p>"Where am I?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng asked utterly perplexed.</p>
