<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2453 Antennae </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>If the group of True Gods were to fight together, they could definitely resist the troublesome snakes that surrounded them.</p>

  <p>As they advanced while fighting, their speed was slow.</p>

  <p>"What should we do?" The whole debate venue was swarming with enemies.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyebrows were scrunched together. The situation was getting ugly really fast. Each one of their fears had a physical manifestation, and the Snake Spirit and other powerful existences they met around the debate venue were just a few of them.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Multiple Antennae Snake that attacked them before was nowhere to be seen now.</p>

  <p>None of them knew where it was hiding but all of them were on guard for a surprise attack.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, Yan, let's rush out and kill the Snake Spirit," said Reinhard, stepping up to the occasion.</p>

  <p>"The others, hold your ground."</p>

  <p>Zheng let out an affirmative grunt. Now was not the time to hesitate.</p>

  <p>Just then a soft squeaky voice spoke from Zheng's left, halting his steps. "Can you bring me with you?"</p>

  <p>It was the short True God whose eyes were like two soybeans.</p>

  <p>While the other True Gods didn't pay this person much attention, Zheng had quietly watched him along the way.</p>

  <p>The soybean-eyed guy was not from a Floating Island and he kept a low profile but he had a deep understanding of the Truth of Godly Way. Plus, his avatar was much stronger than those of other disciples from the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>Reinhard hesitated but Zheng nodded his head. "Alright."</p>

  <p>Since Zheng had agreed, Reinhard didn't say anything else. He looked back to the others. "Disciples of the Sword Clan, set the Soaring Sky Sword Array!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir!"</p>

  <p>"Aye!"</p>

  <p>After a chorus of affirmative noises, Solomon and the other disciples began to arrange the array.</p>

  <p>It wasn't the most critical moment yet. The disciples of the Sword Clan still had a trump card, namely the Calamity Swords given by Marsh. They'd wait for the moment they stared death in the face before they used the Calamity Swords.</p>

  <p>"Let's go!"</p>

  <p>And without delay, Reinhard, Zheng, Yan, and the soybean-eyed guy sprinted ahead.</p>

  <p>Among the four of them, Yan, Reinhard, and the soybean-eyed guy could fly with no problem, but Zheng had to resort to the flying sword given by the Sword Clan.</p>

  <p>"You have incredible talent, Zheng. Why are you still a low-rank True God?"</p>

  <p>Reinhard couldn't help himself from asking.</p>

  <p>In his opinion, it was not difficult for the disciples of the wealthy clans like Yan and Zheng to improve their cultivation base. They might meet some restrictions on the way to becoming consummate True Gods, but it shouldn't be difficult for them to become top-rank True Gods.</p>

  <p>Moreover, even if Zheng's talent was not high enough to make him a top-rank True God, it should still be easy for him to get pills and opportunities that could help him become a mid-rank or even a top-rank True God.</p>

  <p>"It's a long story," Zheng answered with a bitter smile.</p>

  <p>His cultivation base had been far inferior to that of his sister.</p>

  <p>It wasn't that he didn't want to advance to a higher level. It was just that the situation couldn't be helped at the moment.</p>

  <p>However, with the small divine land in his body, he had not fallen behind in terms of strength improvement. Although he was only a low-rank True God, when he encountered ordinary top-rank True Gods, he wasn't inferior in the slightest.</p>

  <p>"The snakes are coming again!"</p>

  <p>The Red Phosphorus Snakes surged in waves, coming down towards the four people.</p>

  <p>Reinhard attacked first.</p>

  <p>"Wind Splitting Sky!"</p>

  <p>Previously, his sword moved so fast that the True Gods present didn't even notice the movement until his opponent was sliced in two.</p>

  <p>But now, his movement was oddly sluggish.</p>

  <p>He unsheathed the long sword in his hand and swung it towards the Red Phosphorus Snakes.</p>

  <p>"Chop!"</p>

  <p>With this sword strike, the fabric of space was instantly shattered, forming a black space crack.</p>

  <p>A hurricane arose from both sides of the space crack as he swung his sword.</p>

  <p>Under the sweep of the hurricane, those Red Phosphorus Snakes were sucked into the crack.</p>

  <p>"So powerful!" Zheng exclaimed in great surprise, eyes impossibly wide.</p>

  <p>Although Duke and Reinhard had shown some powerful skills before, Zheng had been pretty sure he could defeat them.</p>

  <p>But now it seemed that as the strongest top-rank True God of the Sword Clan, Reinhard was not to be underestimated.</p>

  <p>This group of top-rank True Gods were the top existences in the divine land. They were probably more powerful than Soren and the others in the Time Sea Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>The space in the divine land was extremely stable.</p>

  <p>And the crack mended in an instant even after Reinhard's mighty attack.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, a path had been cleared and the four men transformed into streaks of light and shot out of the place before the snakes closed in.</p>

  <p>"The Snake Spirit is still fleeing, but we're faster than it," said Reinhard.</p>

  <p>Ahead of them, the Tribulation Exterminating Sword constantly changed its direction. "According to the historical records, the Snake Spirit isn't powerful. It's not difficult to kill it."</p>

  <p>The snake curse was the Snake Spirit's curse. The Snake Spirit was a special curse itself, and strictly speaking, it was not considered a creature.</p>

  <p>As the four of them sprinted, Zheng's eyes narrowed. Through the thick fog, he saw a jasper snake shadow. It was a small translucent snake with a shape different from other snakes. Reinhard's Tribulation Exterminating Sword was pointing at it.</p>

  <p>"I have found the Snake Spirit!" Zheng pointed to the distance and everyone's gazes followed his finger.</p>

  <p>"Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!"</p>

  <p>Just then, a large number of snakes gushed out from beside the little Snake Spirit.</p>

  <p>Now another five minutes had passed, and just as they had guessed, the level three fierce beasts, Three-Element Snakes were surging out. Their front ends were red, the middle parts were black, and the tails were purple.</p>

  <p>They had three deadly poisons in their bodies, making them several times stronger than the Red Phosphorus Snakes.</p>

  <p>"Another five minutes has passed. I wonder if they can block these Three-Element Snakes. Let's kill the Snake Spirit first!"</p>

  <p>Reinhard then charged at the Snake Spirit.</p>

  <p>However, the Snake Spirit, sensing danger, darted and went underground.</p>

  <p>"You can't escape!"</p>

  <p>Reinhard brandished his sword.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>At once, the soft ground cracked open, revealing the Snake Spirit.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>Reinhard didn't hesitate or show mercy. He had to kill the Snake Spirit as soon as possible, or all of them would die.</p>

  <p>But just as Reinhard was about to make the final blow, a huge antenna filled with fist-sized suckers suddenly erupted from the ground, held on to his ankle, and dragged him below.</p>

  <p>"Holy crap!"</p>

  <p>"Damn it!"</p>

  <p>Yan, Zheng, and the soybean-eyed guy looked on with gaping mouths and pale faces.</p>

  <p>Then more than ten huge antennae suddenly extended from the ground and surrounded them.</p>

  <p>They didn't expect that at this critical moment, the long lost Multiple Antennae Snake would reappear!</p>
