<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1268 Go To The Immortal Mansion Again </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Ning Yudie was in an extremely bad mood. "He has so many women! He's not a good guy!" she fumed.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning didn't know why, but the sight of the normally dignified girl's pout made her smile. Maybe she found it endearing. Mu Ning wasn't sure, but Yudie's jealousy seemed to cancel the bitterness in her heart.</p>

  <p>"But Luo Luo Zheng got to know this woman first," she teased.</p>

  <p>"I don't care! No matter what, he's not a good guy!" Ning Yudie huffed, her face red in anger.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning tutted, "If Luo Luo Zheng was a bad guy, he would've just left and never come back. His righteousness is what made him keep his promise."</p>

  <p>But Ning Yudie still adamantly shook her head as tears welled up in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"No! He is not a good guy!" she stubbornly whined.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning sighed in resignation and extended her sleeved arm towards her.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie flinched at her sudden movement. "What are you doing?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning ignored her question and used her sleeve to wipe away the tears from her face. "He's not a good guy, but he's still our husband," she reminded Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>Her words stunned the crying girl in silence. Mu Ning was right. No matter what Ning Yudie thought of Luo Luo Zheng, at the end of the day, he was still her husband who she had to stick with through thick and thin. She knew she could get very possessive of him, but she had already known that someone like him couldn't belong to her entirely. It was time she swallowed this bitter truth.</p>

  <p>Kenneth, on the other hand, couldn't help but feel a bit jealous as he looked at Ning Yudie. 'Luo Luo Zheng is really so awesome!' he thought to himself as he floated further away.</p>

  <p>It was normal for a warrior to have multiple women. Kenneth himself had dozens of women.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng only had three, but the thing was, all his women were top-notch!</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie was the leader of Central Region's biggest sect. Although the woman beside her was unknown to Kenneth, he knew her background couldn't be simple. Luo Zheng's brides were sure to be of high status. How could they ever be compared with ordinary women?</p>

  <p>'He just married Master Ning and held a grand wedding ceremony not too long ago, but here he is with Mu Ning. Luo Luo Zheng is indeed a real man!'</p>

  <p>Kenneth thought, admiring Luo Luo Zheng from the bottom of his heart. However, he also could not help but steal a glance at Ning Yudie. 'She looks rather furious, but there's nothing she can do about it...'</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng took his time comforting Mu Ning. After a while, the topic finally shifted to her father.</p>

  <p>Kane had once been a steward of Cloud Hall, but disappeared during a mission. There was no news of him until now.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Luo Luo Zheng was able to gather the information regarding Kane's whereabouts within the memories of the world's will which contained all the happenings in this great world.</p>

  <p>A trace of sadness visibly appeared on his face. "Your father has passed away in some relic in the Central Region," he told Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>The girl's eyes dimmed. "Oh, is that so?" she muttered sadly. She had already expected this since her father had been gone for so long, but there was always that small sliver of hope in her heart that he was alive.</p>

  <p>Getting this information from Luo Luo Zheng finally confirmed her fears.</p>

  <p>"I will have Cloud Hall send someone to bring back his remains," he assured her.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning nodded quietly. She was more reserved compared to Ning Yudie, and now that Luo Luo Zheng had let go of her, she purposely put some distance between the two of them.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Mu Ning saw that Ning Yudie had finally calmed down. She grabbed the other girl's hand and pulled her up. "Come on."</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie frowned and tried to pull away. "What are you doing?"</p>

  <p>Mu Ning smiled, "Let's go and say our greetings." "No!" Ning Yudie stubbornly refused.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning shook her head at her childishness. Who knew the leader of the biggest sect in Central Region could act like this. "In the end, we still have to get to know each other. How can you avoid that?" she reasoned.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie bit her lip, unable to think of a reply to Xi Youqin's sound logic.</p>

  <p>She helplessly let Mu Ning drag her away as they flew towards the mountainside.</p>

  <p>Xi Youqin's way of thinking made her baggage much lighter compared to Yudie's. So long as she could accompany Luo Luo Zheng to the very end, then it was paradise. It did not matter how many women he met and fell for along the way.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's expression, on the other hand, couldn't be painted once he saw Mu Ning and Ning Yudie arrive. He had no idea how to deal with his relationship with three women, but he had to force himself to introduce them to each other.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning, fortunately, was extremely sociable and greeted Mu Ning first.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie merely stood to the side quietly. The three of them looked unsurely at each other, not really knowing what to make of the situation.</p>

  <p>Each one of them felt differently about this arrangement but it was a harmonious first meeting, for now at least. Luo Luo Zheng felt he got lucky this time for passing this kind of test.</p>

  <p>The next two days were spent in the Cloud Sect. According to reports, Nory, with his own strength, had regained his position in the Mo Clan.</p>

  <p>Wurth, on the other hand, had officially taken over the Zhang Clan's business. It seemed everyone managed to accomplish a lot over the past few years.</p>

  <p>After those two days, Luo Luo Zheng headed south, back to the Luo Clan in C County.</p>

  <p>Although its location wasn't in the Burning Sky Imperial Capital, the Luo Clan's sudden rise in power couldn't be ignored. They had even managed to surpass the force of the seven noble clans, mainly because of Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>They knew his rise and fall in Central Region. He had even disappeared for two years, but no one ever dared to offend the Luo Clan in case Luo Luo Zheng ever returned. That was how much they feared him.</p>

  <p>This fear from others allowed Luo Clan's influence to expand rapidly, making them an unbeatable force in C County.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's presence was now celebrated in the Luo Clan. He had also brought with him treasures and precious cultivation methods.</p>

  <p>Of course, these things he brought were just mere, ordinary trinkets for him, but they were extremely valuable to the Luo Clan. Luo Luo Zheng was careful not to give them too much of the good stuff.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, he helped them when he could. Luo Luo Zheng knew he was fated to live an extremely long life and when he came back again, probably many years later, the entire clan might have already been replaced with new faces. He also knew he wouldn't be able to care for them forever since he would need to focus on his training and preparation to ascend to the Upper World.</p>

  <p>It was a good thing that the Eastern Region was under the control of Cloud Sect, which in turn was under the control of Cloud Hall. Even if he didn't ask, the Could Sect would still look after the Luo Clan for him.</p>

  <p>However, living well would still depend on the capabilities of the clan itself. He could only hope the best for them.</p>

  <p>A few days later, he left the Luo Clan and went west.</p>

  <p>This confused his ladies. Since Luo Luo Zheng had already finished his tasks, he should be rushing back to the Central Region. Why were they heading west?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, of course, refused to tell them and chose to act mysterious. He simply told them that he was bringing them to a mysterious, secluded place.</p>

  <p>This "mysterious, secluded place" turned out to be the Dragon Valley of the Cloudy Mountain. It was the location of the Immortal Mansion that Luo Luo Zheng had entered before.</p>

  <p>This Immortal Mansion was extremely strange. Aside from Luo Luo Zheng, the only person that had ever come here was Immortal Mist.</p>

  <p>But, even with his cultivation level at the Spirit Supreme Realm, Immortal Mist was still unable to control the Immortal Mansion and had only managed to obtain one more token than Luo Luo Zheng. The token he got had the character "thunder" on it. He had given it to Luo Luo Zheng, who had initially gotten the one with "wind."</p>

  <p>According to what Immortal Mist told him, this Immortal Mansion did not have a name since nobody, in the entire a hundred thousand supreme worlds of the universe, had the qualifications to name it.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng thought Immortal Mist might've been exaggerating, but he knew that it was a place he definitely had to explore before he ascended to the Upper World. He did not know if he'd be able to obtain the Immortal Mansion's secrets despite reaching the Life and Death Realm, but he would have to see.</p>

  <p>"So this is where you wanted to take us?" Ning Yudie said, looking at the empty valley.</p>

  <p>"Follow me!" he said, walking towards a seemingly insignificant corner.</p>

  <p>He slowly walked between two bamboo sticks before a green light flashed and he disappeared right before their very eyes.</p>
