  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Jade Pure Realm was still peaceful, even though everyone was depressed.</p>

  <p>Most of them were dead, and their biggest supporter, the Monkey Spirit King, had escaped.</p>

  <p>What on earth was going on?</p>

  <p>"What should we do now? I'm afraid we can't stand our ground against the Snake Spirit Sect without the help of the Monkey Spirit Sect," Gonggong said.</p>

  <p>"Should we leave the Jade Pure Realm first?" Zhurong asked.</p>

  <p>Some of them had thought of giving up.</p>

  <p>It was not their fault. The support of the Monkey Spirit Sect was a prerequisite if they wanted to take this action. Without it, there wouldn't be any plan. It would be best for them to retreat first and then take a decision.</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord said, "The exit of this passage is on the other side of the Jade Pure Realm. Now that the Snake Spirit King is exclusively targeting us, I don't think he will let us go."</p>

  <p>"Then we can't retreat," said the real Fuxi, looking straight ahead.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what the Monkey Spirit King saw and why he had to run away. But he is huge, and we can find him by following the traces that he has left." The Snake Goddess had calmed down enough to think straight and find a solution.</p>

  <p>"The Monkey Spirit King is extraordinary but also very reckless. It looks like the Snake Spirit King will kill him soon enough." Eastern Emperor Taiyi sighed helplessly.</p>

  <p>"Let's start looking for him," Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>Swoosh...</p>

  <p>The Wing King flapped his wings as he remained beside Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The seven people, including Luo Zheng, the Primeval Lord of Heaven, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and the Snake Goddess, climbed on to the Wing King's back. With a flash of his wings, he turned into a cyan shadow and shot into the air.</p>

  <p>Hundreds of miles into their journey, they found a number of low mountains and rivers. There were also a few Other Shore creatures that had been born there and that still lived there, but they were very docile.</p>

  <p>They didn't have the slightest intention of attacking Luo Zheng and his companions when they spotted them making their way through the air.</p>

  <p>If the Other Shore Realm warriors were to be sent here, none of them would believe that this was the Jade Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>"There are footprints!"</p>

  <p>"These are the Monkey Spirit King's footprints!"</p>

  <p>"Follow the footprints!"</p>

  <p>There were huge footprints on the ground. Only a huge creature like the Monkey Spirit King could leave such giant footprints. So the Wing King followed this footprint trail.</p>

  <p>The Wing King was so fast that he had covered five hundred miles before long.</p>

  <p>There were lots of footprints along the way, but the Monkey Spirit King was nowhere to be seen.</p>

  <p>The scenery began to change the moment they reached a distance of about eight hundred miles.</p>

  <p>The green color was gradually replaced by a grey white and a large area of grey stones were exposed on the ground.</p>

  <p>There were still footprints that were clear enough to attract their attention.</p>

  <p>"The footprints are still here. We are probably headed in the right direction," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said, confused.</p>

  <p>"How is the Monkey Spirit King running so fast?" The Snake Goddess frowned. She had a premonition that something was terribly wrong.</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord said, "The Space Guiding Stone can create a lot of illusions. It could have deceived the Monkey Spirit King, and it could probably also have made these footprints to deceive us."</p>

  <p>"Let's go and have a look!" Luo Zheng said to the Wing King.</p>

  <p>The Wing King understood what Luo Zheng meant. He flew forward and came to a stop beside a huge footprint.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng walked up to the edge of the footprint that was as huge as a lake.</p>

  <p>He put his hand into the pit from the edge where he was standing, then closed his eyes and began to analyze the energy structure within the pit.</p>

  <p>He did not sense an aura belonging to any Treacherous Being. What he did find was a trace of remnant space power.</p>

  <p>He suddenly opened his eyes and said in all seriousness, "I'm afraid these footprints have been created by the space token, not the Monkey Spirit King."</p>

  <p>"Someone has deliberately led us to the wrong path!" the Snake Goddess exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Well, it does look like the Snake Spirit King is playing tricks on us, doesn't it?" Fuxi said, looking warily around.</p>

  <p>Nervousness rippled through everyone present.</p>

  <p>All sorts of methods had been used to target them ever since they had stepped into the Jade Pure Realm. This was bad news.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, come back here. We need to leave," said the Wing King.</p>

  <p>Once Luo Zheng jumped onto the back of the Wing King, the Wing King dived and flew to the other side in a huge arc.</p>

  <p>Now that Luo Zheng had seen through the origin of these footprints, the Wing King was naturally backtracking to avoid any danger.</p>

  <p>But they had barely traveled a few dozen miles when the sight of another huge footprint caused everyone's faces to darken.</p>

  <p>"Someone is doing this on purpose!" the Snake Goddess said through gritted teeth.</p>

  <p>"I agree. It does look like someone is trying to make a fool of us!"</p>

  <p>Zhurong said. He was so furious that his eyes had reddened with rage.</p>

  <p>The Wing King's wings trembled and he changed direction. But yet again, they had barely flown ten miles in the new direction when another huge footprint made an appearance.</p>

  <p>"Ignore these footprints. Grand Supreme Elderly Lord, please lead the way. Let's move towards the center of the Jade Pure Realm," Luo Zheng said suddenly but sternly.</p>

  <p>The footprints shouldn't have been used as reference objects. Their persistence in avoiding the footprints had played a huge role in their getting lost.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you going to find the Monkey Spirit King?" asked the Wing King.</p>

  <p>"There is no way to find him. So that's the only thing we can do at the moment," Luo Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>The Wing King didn't change direction and continued to fly onwards. He ignored the footprints, irrespective of how many of them continued to appear.</p>

  <p>In the Heavenly Square City</p>

  <p>Two stones appeared above the Snake Spirit King's head.</p>

  <p>One was an amber, diamond-shaped gem. This was the Limited Omnipotent Stone.</p>

  <p>The other was a light blue triangular gem, and this was the Space Guiding Stone, also one of the Holy Items.</p>

  <p>Through the Limited Omnipotent Stone, the Snake Spirit King could see everything in the Jade Pure Realm, right from tiny particles of sand to the Monkey Spirit King who was running crazily in all directions. He could tap into any secrets and all details.</p>

  <p>The Space Guiding Stone could change the space of any area at will.</p>

  <p>It could easily create a large space sink, forming a huge footprint.</p>

  <p>To the Snake Spirit King, the scene was like a cat playing with a mouse.</p>

  <p>The previous Space Devouring Technique had also been released by the Snake Spirit King. He didn't need weak opponents, and it was obvious that the weaker ones would be eliminated.</p>

  <p>Buzz, buzz, buzz...</p>

  <p>Every time the Space Guiding Stone flashed, a footprint would appear in front of Luo Zheng and his group. But they ignored them and continued to move in the established direction.</p>

  <p>"Are you no longer affected by the footprints? It's not interesting anymore, so I will go ahead and kill a few more!"</p>

  <p>The blue light on the Space Guiding Stone began to flicker violently. A number of large blue space awls formed out of nowhere and shot towards the Wing King.</p>

  <p>According to the Snake Spirit King, he would torture this group of people and in the end, only one of them could survive.</p>

  <p>Swish, swish, swish...</p>

  <p>The space awls were too powerful for ordinary Eternal Realm warriors to face and deal with.</p>

  <p>The Wing King, feeling the power of the space awls, began to rapidly wave his wings and flew forward at an incredible speed. But he was still unable to escape the scope of the space awls.</p>

  <p>Puff, puff, puff...</p>

  <p>The space awls smashed everything that they enveloped.</p>

  <p>After all the space awls had shot out to hit everything, the Snake Spirit King consulted the Limited Omnipotent Stone again. What he saw there left him stunned.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and his group had disappeared in the Limited Omnipotent Stone.</p>

  <p> </p>
