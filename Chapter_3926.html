<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Even before the battle began, Luo Zheng's body had already started mutating, and the Snake Goddess had noticed it.</p>

  <p>When the huge monster suddenly appeared, she had a hunch but was still a little uncertain. The gap between the monster and Luo Zheng was just too great.</p>

  <p>For one, Luo Zheng's Wild God Body was only a little over four million feet tall.</p>

  <p>However, this monster's body was over ten million feet tall. It was more than twice of Luo Zheng's size.</p>

  <p>"It's a pity that you dodged it," Luo Zheng said with an unpleasant sound coming from his chest.</p>

  <p>The voice had a strong penetrating power that would send shivers on one's spine, and there was also a bewitching power in it.</p>

  <p>Almost all living things would instinctively feel fear and disgust towards Luo Zheng when they heard his voice. Even those powerful Eternal Realm masters were of no exception.</p>

  <p>"Who the hell are you?" the Grandmaster of Heaven asked again. He instinctively felt that this monster would be difficult to deal with. If it was possible, he wouldn't take the chance to fight it.</p>

  <p>"This is impossible. There is no such existence in the chaos!" The captain of the Black Ship was in denial as the monster didn't give a direct answer.</p>

  <p>It was the Black Ship's duty to gather news and information in the chaos for the Nihility race.</p>

  <p>If the captain missed accounting such a powerful existence, it would be a grave dereliction of his duty.</p>

  <p>The captain was so puzzled. If the monster was really from the chaos, there was no way that it would just appear out of nowhere. 'Is this creature from the Other Shore then?' he thought.</p>

  <p>"Such a bother! What..."</p>

  <p>As the Grandmaster of Heaven was still conversing with the captain of the Black Ship, the monster secretly turned and gave a hint to Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>

  <p>With that, Eastern Emperor Taiyi condensed his golden sword again and took the opportunity to hack it towards the Grandmaster of Heaven's head while his guard was down.</p>

  <p>However, the Grandmaster of Heaven was too strong to fall for a sneak attack. With just a flip of his Cyan Misty Sword, he deflected the incoming sword strike.</p>

  <p>But what he didn't know was that it was just a diversion created by the white-haired monster. While the Grandmaster of Heaven was busy with the attacks from Eastern Emperor Taiyi, he didn't notice that the monster had already disappeared. The next moment, it emerged inside the Lawless Cage, next to Fuxi and the Snake Goddess.</p>

  <p>Herbert was the one who created the Lawless Cage. It looked ordinary on the outside, but it was extremely powerful.</p>

  <p>Even Chaos Ancient Gods like Gerald, Judson, and Herbert himself, were completely suppressed by the Lawless Cage.</p>

  <p>With the sudden appearance of the white-haired monster, they thought that it might have the chance to defeat the Grandmaster of Heaven. Everyone who was held captive inside the Lawless Cage thought that the monster could bring the situation a favorable turn.</p>

  <p>However, to their dismay, they didn't expect that the monster would enter the Lawless Cage on its own volition.</p>

  <p>"Why are you here? Are you out of your mind?"</p>

  <p>Fuxi's eyes widened as he stared at the white-haired monster. He wanted to curse as he discerned that the monster just made a seemingly stupid move.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, both the Grandmaster of Heaven and the captain of the Black Ship didn't understand what just happened but were overjoyed by the unexpected turn of events.</p>

  <p>No one expected that the monster would throw itself into the Lawless Cage.</p>

  <p>No matter how powerful a person was, their strength would be greatly weakened if they were trapped inside the Lawless Cage. As a result, the Grandmaster of Heaven could do anything to them as he wished.</p>

  <p>He initially thought that the white-haired monster was going to be troublesome, but he didn't expect it to be so reckless.</p>

  <p>Now, almost all his powerful opponents were already inside the cage. Only one remained outside.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, a sharp light flashed in the eyes of Eastern Emperor Taiyi. A line of undecipherable Sanskrit words flowed down his face like tears.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>As the Sanskrit words glinted, his strength and speed immediately surged.</p>

  <p>Right now, he was the only one who could move freely and take on the Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the Grandmaster of Heaven also increased the aura gushing from his body. This instantly made Eastern Emperor Taiyi heighten his senses and defenses. Under the constant activation of his bloodline power, the golden sword emitted a blinding light again.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the Lawless Cage, the black fire that enveloped several parts of the bodies of the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, Gerald, and Judson hadn't been extinguished. While the Grandmaster of Heaven was dealing with the white-haired monster earlier, the suppression force of the cage had somewhat weakened. Therefore, they were able to at least stop the fire from expanding further.</p>

  <p>However, now that the Grandmaster of Heaven was just dealing with Eastern Emperor Taiyi, the suppression force of the Lawless Cage had increased greatly again.</p>

  <p>Given the speed and the intensity of the black fire, it wouldn't be long before it devoured all those who were affected.</p>

  <p>At this crucial moment, the white-haired monster suddenly reached out and grabbed the purple pillars of the cage.</p>

  <p>The purple pillars of the Lawless Cage were supposed to be indestructible from the inside. Even with the combined powers and efforts of the two Chaos Ancient Gods, Fuxi, and the Snake Goddess, the purple pillars didn't budge at all.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing what the monster was doing, all of the prisoners inside laughed bitterly. Herbert, who was also watching, shook his head.</p>

  <p>However, a few moments after the white-haired monster grabbed the pillars, the purple light on their surface instantly dimmed and gradually turned into a gray light, which spread rapidly throughout the entire cage.</p>

  <p>"What's happening?"</p>

  <p>"Hey, what is this?"</p>

  <p>"Are you breaking the Lawless Cage?!"</p>

  <p>Everyone's eyes widened and their jaws dropped.</p>

  <p>In front of them, the seemingly invincible Lawless Cage was collapsing like a fragile sculpture.</p>

  <p>Herbert, who was the creator of the Lawless Cage, was the most surprised.</p>

  <p>As he comprehended the mechanism of the Lawless Cage from the power of truth, he knew that only the outer layer of the cage was vulnerable.</p>

  <p>That was why the sword attack of Eastern Emperor Taiyi from before made the Lawless Cage tremble. But there was no way to deliberately destroy it from the inside.</p>

  <p>Or so they thought? until they witnessed how the white-haired monster destroyed it with its bare hands.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven was about to go all out on capturing Eastern Emperor Taiyi when he suddenly perceived that something wrong was going on. As he turned at the direction of the Lawless Cage, his face grew pale at what he saw.</p>

  <p>The purple light of the Lawless Cage had turned to gray. It seemed like it was eroded by some kind of opposing energy.</p>

  <p>"What did you?"</p>

  <p>Victory was almost in the grasp of the Grandmaster of Heaven. Once he killed all the people inside the cage, the problem in the chaos would be solved. The only thing that he needed to focus afterward was the war on the Other Shore. However, all his plans crumbled when this unknown monster suddenly appeared and destroyed the Lawless Cage effortlessly.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven was quick-witted. He didn't want to believe his suspicion, but it was the only explanation. "Damn it! You are Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>Previously, Luo Zheng had used a similar ability, and only he possessed such an unusual and powerful skill in the entire chaos.</p>

  <p>Fuxi, who had just escaped from the Lawless Cage, glared at the white-haired monster when he heard the cry of the Grandmaster of Heaven. "Wait.</p>

  <p>Are you really Luo Zheng? What kind of ability is that? No offense, but you completely look like an ugly monster."</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess was just calm. Gerald and Judson also had a hunch earlier. When they saw how the monster easily crushed the Lawless Cage, they instantly knew the identity of the white-haired monster.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it's me. Ha-ha, you don't have to emphasize the ugly part." Luo Zheng had no intention of hiding his identity.</p>

  <p>"Well, given your remarkable strength, your appearance doesn't really matter," Fuxi said as he stared at Luo Zheng's body with admiration. Although it was weird, every part of it was useful and suitable for killing and fighting.</p>

  <p>"Herbert, are you seeing this? As a zillion creatures have been born in these over a thousand chaotic eras, there are always some powerful beings that would appear no matter what. Now, do you still want to be part of the other side?" Gerald pointed out as he tried to persuade Herbert.</p>

  <p>Herbert chose to follow the Purge Way, though he was a little uncertain.</p>

  <p>The ancient and powerful Element Spirit Civilization made him think that it would be much easier to complete the Purge Way.</p>

  <p>However, after seeing what Luo Zheng did today, Herbert began to harbor doubts and have a little change of perspective. He thought that perhaps, it was destined that this round of chaos became different from the rest.</p>

  <p>Herbert kept quiet and didn't reply. As a Chaos Ancient God, he didn't have the luxury to easily change his mind. But for now, since he was released, the only certain thing was the Grandmaster of Heaven was his enemy.</p>
