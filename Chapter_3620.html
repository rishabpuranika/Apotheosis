  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade Spirit was glad to see the human beings arrive.</p>

  <p>He had learned about powerful human warriors from King Manard. They were a race that had almost disappeared on the Other Shore, and were once powerful enough to contend with the Element Spirit Civilization.</p>

  <p>Most importantly, they shared the same interests as the Regal Jade Spirit.</p>

  <p>After speaking with him, the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked Zheng to release the people from within the Civilization Artifact.</p>

  <p>There were a total of eighteen independent spaces in the Creation Myth Temple and hundreds of thousands of people in each space. A considerable amount of them were born on the Other Shore, but nearly half of them came from the 77th civilization.</p>

  <p>These were not the most powerful humans at the time, yet they still held high positions.</p>

  <p>Zheng obliged the Primeval Lord of Heaven. However, since so many humans would be added to his body, he required a new space.</p>

  <p>With a flash of his mind, in the distance, the chaotic sea began trembling.</p>

  <p>From beneath the water's surface, a gigantic mound of some sorts broke through, splashing water in all directions as it emerged. Just like that, a new continent came into being.</p>

  <p>"Primeval Lord of Heaven, please place the spaces there, on that new continent," requested Zheng.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven waved his hand gently and the pages of the book began flipping over. The eighteen spaces descended from the sky onto the continent. Humans began walking out in small groups, looking around the new world with varying reactions.</p>

  <p>Energy souls, such as Fuxi, Chiyou and Gonggong, flew down and guided their respective clansmen.</p>

  <p>Now that they had been assigned to this continent by Zheng, naturally, they would rebuild their homeland here.</p>

  <p>These people had been hiding in the temple for too long. Since the humans lost, most of the weaker ones had been hiding in the spaces in the Creation Myth Temple. After countless years, they were finally able to see the light of day again, so it was only natural to have mixed feelings about it.</p>

  <p>Looking at the humans brought up some questions for Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Primeval Lord of Heaven, as far as I know, my inner world is a primitive land. So these humans should be viewed as returning from the Other Shore to the chaos, right?" Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>As a leader of the humans, the Primeval Lord of Heaven was extremely knowledgeable.</p>

  <p>But Zheng's question stunned him, left him trapped.</p>

  <p>In principle, the Other Shore and the chaos were two worlds separated from each other.</p>

  <p>Once someone entered the Other Shore, there was no way back.</p>

  <p>During the past more than a thousand chaotic eras, the creatures on the Other Shore had tried to influence one civilization after the other, but none of them had come to the chaos.</p>

  <p>This truth had still not changed thus far.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven had used a loophole on the Other Shore to let humans' seeds descend. Other races had done the same thing, causing the chaotic phenomena in this round of chaotic era.</p>

  <p>However, all they sent down were seeds, not their real bodies.</p>

  <p>Even though the true body of the Primeval Lord of Heaven was incredibly powerful, once he left the Other Shore for real, he would be killed by the truth in an instant. No other possibility existed.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven paused a moment before nodding and saying,</p>

  <p>"Indeed."</p>

  <p>"The primitive land and the inner world are two different concepts. Every primitive land is located in the chaos. Of course, we are coming to the chaos," the Snake Goddess chimed in from the side.</p>

  <p>"But why didn't the truth punish them?" Zheng asked, somewhat confused.</p>

  <p>Carefully thinking back, he realized that his inner world had been a "primitive land" for a long time. That meant, as soon as he carried the first Other Shore Token, he had brought something from the Other Shore to the chaos.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven narrowed his eyes and thought a while, a bitter smile forming.</p>

  <p>The Source World was another primitive land, but it did not serve as anyone's inner world. It was the countless creatures in the Source World that carried the Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>It was certainly the first time he had met an exception such as Zheng, and so he had no answer for him.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it's because this place is not connected to the outside world. If it is really connected to the chaos, we energy souls, and them, and even the Other Shore Tokens will not survive," the Snake Goddess speculated.</p>

  <p>"It's indeed possible," said the Primeval Lord of Heaven.</p>

  <p>From this point of view, entering Zheng's inner world was not advantageous.</p>

  <p>It might in fact cause unforeseen trouble.</p>

  <p>"Then what should we do?" Zheng asked now frowning as well.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven offered some words with a faint smile, "Don't worry. Every problem has a solution. A primitive land has its own significance. Since such a primitive land came into being within your body, there will naturally be a solution. Let's take it easy and find it."</p>

  <p>He was very fond of exploring unsolved mysteries, and this was the purpose of his Enlightenment Sect as well. He had already lived unimaginably long, and yet he still explored everything he could tirelessly.</p>

  <p>"You're right." Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>His inner world was situated in a corner of the chaos. It wasn't large, and the chances of it being found were slight. There was no need to worry.</p>

  <p>In Stage Thirteen of the Other Shore, the Evil God received a message from Shera. It told him to wait at the foot of the Heavenly River Mountain in Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>In the past he would not have obeyed an order from Shera.</p>

  <p>In fact, he had disobeyed her many times in his brief stint on the Black Ship.</p>

  <p>Right now though, he was left with no other choice. He had to stay on the Other Shore in exchange for a brief window of freedom.</p>

  <p>After receiving the order, the Evil God passed through the energy whirlpool and headed straight for the Myriad Spirits City.</p>

  <p>Zheng had reserved soul crystal for the Evil God in the Myriad Spirits City.</p>

  <p>He hadn't meant to use it at first. He could strengthen himself by simply devouring souls, so it was not an urgent need. Besides, he did not want to owe Zheng a favor.</p>

  <p>But if he left on his own without receiving the soul crystal, he feared that Zheng would be suspicious.</p>

  <p>As Zheng's Inner-world Generating Avatar, any of his mistakes would destroy him.</p>

  <p>The Evil God absorbed the soul crystal and left the Myriad Spirits City.</p>

  <p>Exploring Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore was common for a Soul of Light and so drew no suspicion.</p>

  <p>He arrived at the foot of the Heavenly River Mountain and waited there patiently.</p>

  <p>He had always been very confident, but this time he wasn't sure if he could escape Zheng's control.</p>

  <p>"Rumble..."</p>

  <p>He had been waiting a while when he heard furious rumblings of beasts' hooves thundering from the mountain, as if thousands of horses ran wild.</p>

  <p>He raised his head to see a group of unicorns galloping down the mountain road not far away.</p>

  <p>His soul was powerful to be sure, but it was still difficult for him to face the fierce beasts on the Other Shore head on.</p>

  <p>Escape was the only thought on his mind.</p>

  <p>Just as he was about to take a step forward, he felt as if his feet were nailed to the ground and he was unable to move.</p>

  <p>"Illusion Breaking Rune!"</p>

  <p>Recognizing something was wrong, the Evil God immediately chanted the Illusion Breaking Rune in an attempt to leave the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>But just as he opened his mouth, a green thread wrapped around his Soul of Light. That was an exceptionally thin Soul Binding Thread.</p>
