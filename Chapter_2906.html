<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, Tianming, and Sword Chen walked for more than a thousand miles along the valley. With each step, the road before them became broader and broader.</p>

  <p>From the outside, the Mountain of Holy Beings looked like an ordinary mountain, but its interior was not soil.</p>

  <p>The space was not cramped at all. Moreover, the silver light overhead gave them the feeling of walking under the sky, even if its color was a little strange.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng walked forward, he scanned the surrounding environment.</p>

  <p>Unlike everyone who would enter the mountain, his main concern was not the chance to become a Holy Being but rather finding the way out of the maze.</p>

  <p>Before he had entered the mountain, Mike had told him all about what to expect inside the Mountain of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>The space within the Mountain of Holy Beings was vast, but it was not as complex as the other forbidden areas.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng, Tianming, and Sword Chen finally came to the end of the valley, they saw an open plain in front of them. The plain looked vast and endless.</p>

  <p>In the distance, there was a line where the plain seemed to merge with the sky made of silver light.</p>

  <p>Once the competition began, silver holy springs would appear in this plain.</p>

  <p>Anyone who could occupy one of the holy springs would become a Holy Being.</p>

  <p>However, the number of holy springs that would appear was different each time. It could be two or three or more.</p>

  <p>At the time when Mike had become a Holy Being, there had only been one holy spring. Therefore, Mike had beaten everyone else to become a Holy Being.</p>

  <p>The rules were simple, but occupying a holy spring was not an easy task.</p>

  <p>On one hand, warriors had to pass tests from the Mountain of Holy Beings itself; on the other hand, they had to compete with other warriors for the chance to occupy a holy spring.</p>

  <p>"I don't see any silver holy springs." With a light tap on the ground, Tianming flew up into the air and looked over the entire plain, which was completely empty.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it's not the time yet," Sword Chen said unworriedly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng took a few steps toward the plain. "My father said that a certain number of people must arrive before the silver holy springs appear."</p>

  <p>Usually, when the Mountain of Holy Beings appeared, a whole crowd of warriors would swarm in. But this time, only the three of them had arrived at the plain. It was likely that there were not enough people to start.</p>

  <p>Not long after Luo Zheng finished speaking, he felt a chaotic aura coming from behind him.</p>

  <p>He turned his head and saw dozens of people coming slowly from the valley.</p>

  <p>It had taken Luo Zheng less only seconds to enter the Mountain of Holy Beings from the spatial passageway, so he hadn't had time to pay attention to his competitors. Now that he looked around, he was surprised to see some acquaintances.</p>

  <p>'Leland?' Luo Zheng's eyes flashed when he saw him.</p>

  <p>Much to Luo Zheng's surprise, Leland seemed to have left the Abyss Demon Region all by himself.</p>

  <p>He nodded his head lightly at Leland in the crowd. Leland opened his mouth slightly and, with his life vitality, said, "Luo Zheng, be careful. These people want to kill you."</p>

  <p>At first, Luo Zheng was a little surprised to hear such a warning from Leland, but he soon realized what was happening.</p>

  <p>The Yellow Emperor Guards would, of course, do everything they could to kill him. Since they were unable to enter the mountain themselves, they would definitely have sent some people to kill him.</p>

  <p>As if on cue, a group of Demi-holy Beings approached Luo Zheng in silence.</p>

  <p>Although they were expressionless and had completely concealed their killing intent, Luo Zheng could see right through them.</p>

  <p>These Demi-holy Beings were not from the large clans on the Floating Islands. In fact, they were even more arrogant and conceited than the ones who were, because they believed that the disciples from the large clans only relied on a large number of resources to become Demi-holy Beings.</p>

  <p>Everyone in this group was from a first-tier clan and had relied entirely on their own talent to become a Demi-holy Being. Naturally, they thought that both their strengths and talents were better than those of the Demi-holy Beings from the large clans.</p>

  <p>When they were still a few hundred feet away from Luo Zheng, Luo Zheng suddenly smiled and said, "If you want to kill me, go ahead. You've been suppressing your killing intent for too long. I'm afraid you won't be able to bear it much longer."</p>

  <p>Exposed by Luo Zheng's words, the group of Demi-holy Beings immediately felt flustered.</p>

  <p>The leader of the group was a red-haired man. "Since you already know our intentions, you should die obediently so that we don't have to waste our energy!" he sneered.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng sighed exaggeratedly as if he was fed up with them. "If you stop now and give up this stupid thought, I'll spare your lives, and you can continue to strive for the chance to become Holy Beings."</p>

  <p>"Spare our lives?" the man echoed in surprise. The rest of them were taken aback too.</p>

  <p>In their eyes, Luo Zheng and his little group were completely cornered. But Luo Zheng still dared to be so arrogant!</p>

  <p>The red-haired man laughed. "You are indeed very arrogant! Let me see how qualified you are to spare our lives, then."</p>

  <p>"They are just two consummate True Gods and one Demi-holy Being!"</p>

  <p>"We have more people and we are more powerful. Killing them is going to be a piece of cake!"</p>

  <p>Led by the red-haired man, they all swarmed over.</p>

  <p>Aside from this group, there were a few people who stayed behind to watch.</p>

  <p>Alfredo and the others from the alliance of wealthy clans didn't move an inch.</p>

  <p>They hadn't become consummate True Gods and Demi-holy Beings without being smart and talented. In their eyes, if the Yellow Emperor Guards were willing to go to such lengths to kill Luo Zheng and his two companions, the three of them must be hard nuts to crack.</p>

  <p>Of course, the warriors who were charging at Luo Zheng and his companions were also smart and could have realized this if they had looked at this situation from an outsider's point of view. However, people always tended to overestimate themselves and underestimate others. They thought that no matter how powerful Luo Zheng and his companions were, they wouldn't stand a chance against tens of consummate True Gods and Demi-holy Beings.</p>

  <p>Hearing what Luo Zheng said, Tianming and Sword Chen understood at once.</p>

  <p>As they watched the group of warriors charge at them, they had a glint of coldness in their eyes.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Both of them drew their swords at almost the same time.</p>

  <p>When Sword Chen unsheathed his sword, his lips curved up into the slightest hint of a smile.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The sword threads that he created with the Emotion Closing Godly Way turned into a large golden net that flew out in front of him.</p>

  <p>In the Abyss Demon Region, his strength was comparable to that of a top Holy Being, putting him on par with even Clark and Murphy. However, that was only because he could use the force of primitive fear when he was there. Outside the Abyss Demon Region, he couldn't borrow the power of the dark water.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, he was still strong enough to fight against ordinary Holy Beings by only using his Emotion Closing Godly Way.</p>

  <p>"What a powerful move!"</p>

  <p>Feeling the power hidden in the sword net, the Demi-holy Beings in the front moved their bodies lightly and avoided the attack. None of them dared to face the net head-on.</p>

  <p>They were unable to use Grand Teleportation in the Mountain of Holy Beings, but their bodily movement skills alone were good enough for them to avoid the attack. Moreover, since they were on an open plain, they had more than enough space to dodge.</p>

  <p>However, just as they dodged this net and prepared for a counterattack, they saw Tianming in front of them.</p>

  <p>They hadn't expected Tianming to charge at them alone.</p>

  <p>"Water Cloud Hacking!"</p>

  <p>"Mountain-splitting Sword Strike!"</p>

  <p>The Demi-holy Beings all made their moves without hesitation.</p>

  <p>They didn't think that it was hard to deal with Tianming at all.</p>

  <p>But just as their internal momentum turned into their respective theurgy, a strange aura suddenly came from Tianming, and the killing intent in their heart disappeared without a trace.</p>

  <p>"I can't cut it down!"</p>

  <p>"I can't do anything to him..."</p>

  <p>"What kind of ability is this?"</p>

  <p>They felt a sacred aura emitting from Tianming that rendered them powerless against him.</p>
