<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Kill all Yellow Emperor Guards in all regions of the divine land! Don't stop attacking them until they are all dead!"</p>

  <p>In fact, the rules should be very precise especially if they were written on the Ruling Slate.</p>

  <p>For example, just to be exactly clear, what did the 'Yellow Emperor Guards' mean?</p>

  <p>Countless dwellers inhibited the divine land. What would happen if a certain normal divine citizen was called as a 'Yellow Emperor Guard'?</p>

  <p>Would the citizen be killed on the spot even though he or she was not a Yellow Emperor Guard?</p>

  <p>However, it was still Zheng's first time writing a rule. Without putting much thought into it, his rule appeared like he just described what he wanted to do.</p>

  <p>After Zheng finished writing the rule, a golden light flashed across the surface of the words, making the rule effective immediately.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>In an instant, the sky displayed blue streaks of lightning.</p>

  <p>The lightning carried such powerful and extraordinary might that Emily was not able to help but let out a gasp of surprise.</p>

  <p>"How could this slate have such terrifying power?" Leopold exclaimed in awe.</p>

  <p>Calmly explaining, Timotheus spoke, "It was made by the Grand Chieftain.</p>

  <p>Of course it is by no means ordinary."</p>

  <p>Moreover, the Ruling Slate's power was mightier than its previous attacks on Zheng. At that time, the disciples of the large clans below were once again in trouble.</p>

  <p>But after their last lesson, most of them had already realized that the Floating Islands were now the epicenter of the chaos. As a result, many of them had fled the area, only planning to return once the Time Sea regained its peace.</p>

  <p>Seeing that the Floating Islands were on the verge of collapse, the Holy Beings all prepared to take action to protect them.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng looked down at them. Afterwards, he waved his hand gently and all the Floating Islands became stabilized in the air.</p>

  <p>The Ruling State unleashed great power, but the Floating Islands remained calm and unshaken. Given this scenario, the True Gods still had to suffer under the immense pressure. However, this also served as a training for them.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, six streaks of lightning spiraled out one by one, heading in all directions of the divine land.</p>

  <p>It was known that the Ruling Slate had a considerably high authority within the divine land. But in terms of influence, Zheng was deemed to be superior to the Ruling Slate for he had merged with the original will.</p>

  <p>Considering that Zheng had already written down the rule that implemented the killing of the Yellow Emperor Guards, the Ruling Slate automatically located where they were hiding and launched several attacks towards them.</p>

  <p>"It's done. The Ruling Slate will certainly kill them all," Zheng smiled as he said to both Timotheus and Emily.</p>

  <p>As a response, Emily nodded. "It seems that the power of this slate is indeed very strong. It has more than enough power to kill the other Yellow Emperor Guards with just one bolt of thunder. However, I'm afraid that it won't be enough to kill Clement."</p>

  <p>When Emily turned into a Wild God, she had used all of her strength. But unfortunately, her powers were still not enough to kill Clement.</p>

  <p>Clement had prepared a set of powerful secret techniques, and there was no easy way to kill him.</p>

  <p>"If one bolt of lightning cannot kill him, then send him tens, hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands. Once the rule on the Ruling Slate comes into effect, it will not stop attacking until the target is killed. The Ruling Slate is absolute and they will have no chance to escape death," Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>To avoid the punishment of the Ruling Slate, Zheng had to exchange his blood in the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>If he had used another method to sneak into the divine land, then he would have suffered endless punishment from the slate.</p>

  <p>Smiling, Emily heaved a sigh of relief upon hearing Zheng's detailed explanation.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng turned his gaze to Ramzi who had been on a coma for a long while. During combat, Clement had mercilessly cut his legs. Leopold, on the other hand, saved him by carrying him on his back.</p>

  <p>"How is Ramzi's condition now?" Zheng asked as he furrowed his brows.</p>

  <p>Leopold replied, "There's nothing to worry about. It's not a fatal injury. He just needs to have a good rest."</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded and said, "Then let me find a quiet place for you to rest."</p>

  <p>Glancing across the Floating Islands below, Zheng finally said, "Let's go to the Floating Island of the Han Clan first."</p>

  <p>The Floating Island of the Luo Clan had already fallen into the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>But for now, it was just an easy feat for Zheng to build another Floating Island for the Luo Clan. After the internal strife and external trouble in the divine land had subsided, there were still a lot of things for him to deal with and this was not one of his priorities for now.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the Han Clan suddenly lost their leader ever since their Holy Emperor died. Now, Alfredo was fighting to become a Holy Being in the Mountain of Holy Beings with only a few elders of the clan remaining on the Floating Island.</p>

  <p>Afraid of being implicated, many disciples of the Han Clan had no choice but to flee from the Floating Island and return to the Six-Burden Region.</p>

  <p>As soon as Zheng and the rest arrived in the area, the elders of the Han Clan all trembled in fear. During the past days when Samuel was in charge of the alliance, every member of the Han Clan had been quite arrogant on the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>But now that Samuel had been killed, most disciples thought that the entire clan would soon be doomed.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Leopold and Timotheus found a secluded house where Ramzi could heal his wound, while Emily repaired her broken arm.</p>

  <p>Compared to their wounds, Mike and Lorena were the ones who suffered the least during the war.</p>

  <p>Under the nervous gaze of the elders of the Han Clan, Mike gently stretched out his hands and built a space channel with space fluctuations. This space channel was connected to a star in the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>It wasn't long before...</p>

  <p>Joy, Hallet, Harold, Aleyna, Liusu, and others walked out from it one after another.</p>

  <p>"It's Master Joy!"</p>

  <p>"The Demi-holy Being of our clan!"</p>

  <p>"And there's Princess Liusu!"</p>

  <p>Upon seeing these people, the elders of the Han Clan could not help but applaud in excitement.</p>

  <p>At this moment, even a fool could see that today would be a watershed on the Time Sea's history.</p>

  <p>If Joy stepped out for them now, then surely, the whole clan would survive the disaster!</p>

  <p>"Eh, but why are we on the Floating Island of our clan?" Curious, Aleyna asked as she looked around with surprise.</p>

  <p>Feeling the same thing, Liusu also looked at Zheng, bewildered.</p>

  <p>"I can't find any other safe place for the time being except for here," smiling, Zheng said.</p>

  <p>When Harold, Joy, and the others saw that Zheng was safe and sound, they roughly guessed what had happened in the divine land. During the past few days, they had been nothing but very worried as they hid and waited in the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>However, just as they were about to ask what had happened, an elder of the Han Clan rushed up to Joy and cried, "Master Joy! I know that in the past, Holy Samuel treated you unfairly, and we had no way of helping you. But now that he's dead, can you please make the decisions for the Han Clan!"</p>

  <p>Joy, Liusu, and Aleyna were all taken aback upon hearing this elder's plea.</p>

  <p>"Wait. Samuel... is dead?" puzzled, Joy asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes! In fact, even his universe was destroyed," the elder said with tears starting to form in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Meddling in the conversation, Zheng added, "It was me who destroyed his universe."</p>

  <p>Just before he killed Samuel, Zheng still had some hesitations.</p>

  <p>However, Samuel was not at all qualified to be a father. He had even tried to use his own daughters in exchange for his life right before he was killed.</p>

  <p>With this, Zheng couldn't find any reason to forgive him.</p>

  <p>Pursing her lips, Liusu shook her head and said, "I know he deserved what happened to him."</p>

  <p>"But what about my brother?" Aleyna asked. She knew that Pascal had been controlled by Samuel, and she was worried about his safety.</p>

  <p>"Samuel asked him to enter the Mountain of Holy Beings and kill me, but I managed to remove Samuel's soul mark from him. In fact, he is here," Zheng said as he gently waved his hand. In a blink of an eye, Pascal appeared in front of them out of the void. However, his soul had lost all memories and was reduced to nothing but a walking corpse now.</p>

  <p>Zheng turned to Lorena and said, "Mother, please help us and look for Pascal's Memory Flame."</p>
