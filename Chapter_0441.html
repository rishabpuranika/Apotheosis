<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Jacques was a little surprised when he saw that Luo Zheng still had the strength to rise to his feet and speak.</p>

  <p>Although Jacques had more powerful skills, he hadn't expected that Luo Zheng would have resisted his attack with his soul.</p>

  <p>It meant that Luo Zheng could withstand the power from the flood dragon.</p>

  <p>The flood dragon bone spear in Jacques' hand was made of the third section of the flood dragon's vertebra, which contained the most vigorous energy and blood among all sections.</p>

  <p>Besides, to refine this bone spear, he had asked one of the most well-known weapon refining masters, Brady to draw thirteen lines of array Sanskrit on it. From among these, six lines of the array Sanskrit were able to initiate the power of the dragon bone while the other seven lines were used to amplify the power of the spear.</p>

  <p>Each line of the array Sanskrit had cost him about one hundred thousand cubic crystals! So he had spent one million and three hundred thousand cubic crystals for all thirteen lines of array Sanskrit.</p>

  <p>Jacques was more surprised than the onlookers to see that Luo Zheng had survived the attack from such great dragon power, because only Jacques knew how powerful the dragon bone spear was.</p>

  <p>"This is quite unexpected," Jacques said, disappointed. After all, he had put a lot of efforts into this attack and had expected to defeat Luo Zheng with a blow. It seemed he had miscalculated Zheng's competence. "You withstood my attack, but your soul has been injured badly. Although you're good enough to bear the power of the three dragon roars, if I use more powerful attacks, you will die or become an idiot. If you admit you're defeated now, I will let you go."</p>

  <p>With his personality, Jacques wasn't the kind of person to show mercy to his opponent. However, maybe because Luo Zheng had withstood the three dragon roars, he changed his mind and decided to give a chance to Luo Zheng to throw in the towel.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean that I should thank you because you asked me to admit that I'm a loser?!" Luo Zheng wiped the blood off his lips and asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes! Since you have almost used up your strength, I don't think you are capable of continuing the fight," Jacques answered with a shake of his head.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng continued with a smile, "I admit that you have something to be proud of and be admired for by most disciples of Cloud Sect because they might not reach your level in their lives. However, no matter how strong you are, there's always someone stronger. I don't believe you are stronger than I am. You are not in a position to ask me to surrender!"</p>

  <p>Jacques' eyebrow shot up. He wondered why Luo Zheng was speaking this way in such a situation. 'Either he is an idiot, or he has something to fall back on. Obviously, he is not stupid. Does he have some powerful skills up his sleeve?' he wondered.</p>

  <p>Just as Jacques was contemplating the situation, the demonic life vitality behind Luo Zheng was forming into demonic phantoms.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng wouldn't admit failure in the competition. To earn the top position during the All Peaks Competition and to become the best disciple of Cloud Sect, he couldn't back off just because of a minor setback. He had won several rounds of the competition already. And so, it wouldn't affect his ranking if he lost in the competition with Jacques. However, Luo Zheng firmly believed in the 'Never Surrender' principle.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, he remembered that the cyan dragon had requested his help in securing and consuming the bone spear.</p>

  <p>So there was absolutely no reason for him to give up.</p>

  <p>"Then don't blame me for the consequences," Jacques said. The arrogance in his eyes faded and was replaced by extreme seriousness.</p>

  <p>Since Jacques had been able to reach such a high level, he must be a top class talent too. Since he knew of his abilities, he had always been arrogant and proud. However, Jacques couldn't figure out Zheng's real competence. He thus decided not to brag too much. Otherwise, he wouldn't be taken as a talent, but as an idiot instead.</p>

  <p>He could tell that in this fight with Luo Zheng, he should not only be more cautious, but also he should try his best.</p>

  <p>Now, two top-class talents from Cloud Sect started attacks at the same time.</p>

  <p>"Demonic phantoms, go!"</p>

  <p>With Zheng's order, the six demonic phantoms scattered and then approached Jacques from different directions. Soon, they were in front of Jacques.</p>

  <p>Jacques glanced at these demonic phantoms indifferently. Then he rotated the bone spear in his hand and thrust it toward them.</p>

  <p>"Puff! Puff! Puff!..." all six demonic phantoms were hit in the center of their bodies. In the next instant, they exploded and turned into wisps of demonic life vitality.</p>

  <p>With the magical power of these demonic phantoms, even if they had transformed into demonic life vitality, they could gather together and form demonic phantoms again. However, that didn't happen this time.</p>

  <p>Surprisingly, the demonic life vitality didn't disappear but continued to spread in the air instead.</p>

  <p>In fact, Jacques had not caused this irregularity in the demonic phantoms' properties— it was Luo Zheng who had caused this deliberately.</p>

  <p>Demonic life vitality was violet black and could block light and vision. It wasn't long before the demonic life vitality soon covered the center of the battle ring.</p>

  <p>The other disciples of Cloud Sect were confused when they found that they couldn't see anything in the center of the battle ring.</p>

  <p>"What the hell is this? Why did Luo Zheng spread the life vitality? Now we can't see what's going on in the battler ring!"</p>

  <p>"What are you talking about? A competition is a competition, not a show! They were battling with their lives, not performing for you! If you want to watch the show, go to Imperial Capital. It's easy to find well-known performers there. Then you can enjoy their performance as long as you want!"</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng still hasn't given up despite being in such a difficult situation. He must have some powerful unique skills that he hasn't used before. Who knows how many powerful skills he has!"</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng had any other choice, he wouldn't have blocked the vision of the other disciples with the demonic life vitality.</p>

  <p>Since he had promised the cyan dragon that he would help consume Jacques' bone spear, he couldn't expose the swallowing process to the public.</p>

  <p>Even though Luo Zheng had blocked the visibility of the battle ring with the demonic life vitality, he had no confidence in his success when battling with Jacques. However, he was determined to do his best.</p>

  <p>Jacques glimpsed at the thick demonic life vitality around him, and then injected a touch of his life vitality into it.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, Jacques' life vitality was swallowed by the demonic life vitality and turned into demonic life vitality.</p>

  <p>Jacques said with a slight smile, "I have heard that your demonic life vitality can swallow others' life vitality. It is indeed special! It seems to be at par with my Bleached Bone Distilled Soul. I don't know why you spread the demonic life vitality in the battle ring, but what you did is in vain. I will now use my most powerful skill to end this battle!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was covered in the demonic life vitality, so it was impossible for Jacques to see his face or expression clearly. Since visibility was low, Luo Zheng took out his Streamer Sword.</p>

  <p>Obviously, the competition between them was drawing to a close.</p>

  <p>Jacques initiated the attack first. With a pinch, the array Sanskrit carved in his dragon bone spear emitted a golden light. After his life vitality had thoroughly circulated through his body, he delivered a most powerful blow.</p>

  <p>"Multiple Stabs!"</p>

  <p>Jacques shouted as an incredible pressure was released with the blow and formed a stream of air.</p>

  <p>Now Jacques had concentrated all the power of the dragon bone spear at the spear's tip. In the light of the golden array Sanskrit, the air stream condensed from the pressure was coated with a thin layer of gold. It lingered around the spear tip slowly.</p>

  <p>With a thrust of the spear, a loud dragon roar was released. This time, the roar was twice as loud as the last ones.</p>

  <p>Everyone was shocked when they heard the terrible roar. However, they didn't know what was happening in the battle ring as Luo Zheng had blocked their vision with the demonic life vitality.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng has been losing ground. Now I guess he has been defeated."</p>

  <p>"Yes. But it is possible that aside from being defeated, he has been turned into an idiot as well."</p>

  <p>"It was not easy for Drizzle Peak to find such a super talent like Luo Zheng. It will be a pity if he becomes an idiot in the All Peaks Competition!"</p>

  <p>Master Wen's face paled when he heard the disciples' discussion. He worried that something terrible might happen to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Yehudi's wound had healed. He stood beside Master Wen and said,</p>

  <p>"Master Wen, don't take their words seriously. Luo Zheng has been in danger many times before. However, he always turned the situation to his advantage. I'm sure that he will be fine."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but I'm afraid this time is different. You saw that the three dragon roars hurt Luo Zheng. Now Jacques has combined his attack with the dragon roar. It will be difficult for Luo Zheng to stay safe," Master Wen said, depressed.</p>

  <p>He had placed all his hope on Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Yehudi sighed. In fact, he wasn't sure that Luo Zheng could dodge Jacques' attack either. After all, Jacques was extremely powerful. His incredible bone spear gave him a bigger advantage. Since the current situation did not favor Luo Zheng, Yehudi could do nothing other than comfort Mater Wen.</p>

  <p>"Maybe...Luo Zheng figured out a way to get rid of the danger."</p>

  <p>Yehudi didn't even believe these words.</p>

  <p>Just then, another deafening dragon roar came from the mist of the violet black demonic life vitality.</p>

  <p>This time, the dragon roar was louder than any of the previous dragon roars.</p>

  <p>The difference between them was significant. If the previous roar of the flood dragon could be compared to a roar from a child, then this roar of the dragon sounded as though it came from an adult.</p>

  <p>Words couldn't describe the difference between these roars.</p>

  <p>The roar brought a sense of desolation, antiquity, and dignity...</p>

  <p>Even if a person exhausted all words in the human vocabulary trying to describe the roar, he wouldn't be able to.</p>

  <p>Elder Xu who had been shielding the impact of the dragon roar was shocked too because even he could sense the menace now.</p>
