<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 415 A Murder Plan (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Magnificent and superior, Cloud Hall stood high above the Cloud Sect or maybe even the entire Eastern Region.</p>

  <p>If even only a core disciple from the Cloud Hall came to Cloud Sect, the leader would greet him in person. Just from this, one could see that the Cloud Hall was much more superior to the Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>Because he knew that what Saint Viana was saying was right, Saint Zara remained at a loss for words.</p>

  <p>If Zheng could really enter the Cloud Road and then the Cloud Hall, the rest of their lives would be spent in fear. If Zheng truly became a core disciple of the Cloud Hall or he made some contributions and got promoted to some important position in the Cloud Hall, it would be a piece of cake for him to get his revenge.</p>

  <p>Probably, the best way to exchange their fate was to come for Zheng now.</p>

  <p>"Ah! I didn't expect that Aura would be trapped in the internal strife of the Burning Sky Empire so soon. If I had known this earlier, I would have killed Zheng during the court trial!" With a firm voice, Saint Viana remained indignant.</p>

  <p>On the day the court trial began, Saint Zara didn't take move because Aura had the Emperor's Token. The emperor of the Burning Sky Empire had strength, much about the same as Kenneth. It was said that the emperor even enjoyed a higher position than Kenneth did in the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>If Aura had gone all out to confront Saint Viana and used the Emperor's Token, the latter would be in great trouble.</p>

  <p>In the past two months, he didn't expect that the Burning Sky Empire had any internal strife. Of all the abundant news he heard about it, the most shocking one was that Kane had already died. Since the news came from the royal palace, it couldn't just be a rumor.</p>

  <p>In fact, Kane was the person behind Aura. Now that he was gone, and the several princes were busily rivaling for the throne. In this situation, Saint Viana no longer felt afraid of Aura.</p>

  <p>As Saint Viana analyzed the advantages and disadvantages, Saint Zara already got an answer. Now, it seemed that Zheng was a threat they had to get rid of, otherwise, he would eventually become their biggest trouble.</p>

  <p>Johanson was Saint Zara's pride. While Saint Zara ranked the last among the ten great saints of the Cloud Sect in terms of strength, his disciple Johanson made him feel honored. Although there were seldom any chances for personal disciples to compete with each other in daily life, they had to test their real strength in the competition and acknowledge their rankings.</p>

  <p>In Saint Zara's eyes, he was not sure whether or not Johanson could get the first prize, but he was rather confident that Johanson could enter the top five.</p>

  <p>That was to say, in the Cloud Sect, there were no more than four or five people that could pose a threat to him.</p>

  <p>With that, Saint Zara firmly believed that the task of killing Zheng would be as easy as a wink for Johanson with his great strength.</p>

  <p>Confident in his disciple's abilities, Saint Zara sent a message to Johanson through life vitality, telling him to be prepared to enter the arena for a fight.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Saint Viana arranged everything to make sure that Zheng and Johanson would land in the same round.</p>

  <p>All the while, Zheng remained oblivious to the inner workings of the competition, clueless about a whole murder plan unfolding, leaving his death on its way.</p>

  <p>At this point in battle, the entire arena turned heated.</p>

  <p>"Jill from Lady Peak vs. personal disciple Tracy!"</p>

  <p>The Cloud Sect had very few female disciples. So far, Jill was the only disciple from Lady Peak that hadn't yet been knocked out from the competition, while Tracy happened to be the only female personal disciple.</p>

  <p>Both of them were God's favored ladies and both were very beautiful. A dainty woman, Jill was graceful and vivacious like a sika deer walking out of a forest in the early spring. Her natural beauty and friendly manners put people at ease.</p>

  <p>Tracy Mo, on the other hand, was a tall, fair-skinned woman. In comparison to Jill, she was less lively and more attractive, her sexy figure making her look even more mature.</p>

  <p>Even though it was a battle between two gifted, female warriors, truthfully, their strength far exceeded the majority of male disciples.</p>

  <p>Even if they were not flashily strong themselves, they could still attract much attention.</p>

  <p>Like Zheng, Jill also maintained her winning streak so far. While Tracy was a personal disciple, it was her first time entering the arena.</p>

  <p>As she sat beside Patrick, she heard Jill's name be announced, followed by her own. "Patrick, I hate fighting women," she said, her lips pursed.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you a woman yourself?" with a chuckle, Patrick said.</p>

  <p>"Too weak," Tracy concisely spat out.</p>

  <p>With a warning tone, Patrick interrupted.</p>

  <p>"Jill is not weak. You don't know how many strong disciples lost to her.</p>

  <p>You'll regret it if you take her lightly."</p>

  <p>The comment made Tracy's lip curl as her expression turned disdainful.</p>

  <p>With a sneer, she said, "Patrick, the strong disciples you mentioned are only rubbish among the thirty-three peaks. You hateful hypocrite!</p>

  <p>Obviously, their strength isn't worth mentioning, and I know you thought of them the same as I did. Yet you still referred to them as powerful ones.</p>

  <p>Did you say that intentionally to hint that you are a lot better than them?</p>

  <p>Let's just drop it. Since Jill is really so strong, then I'll end her winning streak now. I wonder how strong I will be if I defeat her."</p>

  <p>Finishing her words, Tracy walked towards the arena with grace in ladylike steps.</p>

  <p>Having been mocked by Tracy, Patrick smiled helplessly and continued to sit in meditation, his eyes remaining shut.</p>
