<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 486 My Master </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Evan Li dreaded meeting Yan like a rat feared a cat.</p>

  <p>At that time, Yan was the top disciple at the Lady Peak. She had excellent talent and was exceptionally strong. Yan was comparable to the personal disciples in terms of strength.</p>

  <p>The difference between Yan and Luo Luo Zheng was how they had become famous.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng became a powerful and well-known disciple all of a sudden. Before that, his extraordinary talent and strength had been known only by a few people, including Roger Meng, Zachary Zhao, and the disciples of the Drizzle Peak.</p>

  <p>While Yan had gained popularity differently. She had been granted special admission to Cloud Sect on account of her talent. She had been taken good care of since she became a disciple of Cloud Sect. Most people at Cloud Sect watched her and protected her. As a matter of fact, she had faced almost no obstacles during her time at Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>The only trouble Yan suffered was that she had to handle numerous pursuers.</p>

  <p>Yan was as pretty as a fairy. She was nice to everybody around her, and so everyone liked her. Since she had tremendous talent, Cloud Sect regarded her as one of the most important disciples. A girl as perfect as Yan, of course, was attractive to the young disciples of Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>Disciples without outstanding strength, talent, or powerful background did not dare to express their feelings to her, as Yan was too excellent.</p>

  <p>So only the elite disciples from the top seven noble clans dared to convey their interest in Yan.</p>

  <p>Fancy Yun, Yun Clan's young master had been Yan's most ardent admirer. In the end, Fancy Yun paid a painful price? Yan cut off his penis. And that was why Cloud Sect claimed to have imprisoned Yan at Hell Mountain.</p>

  <p>Evan, one of the most outstanding personal disciples, also admired Yan at that time. But Evan always behaved kind of dottily, and some disciples egged him on to purse Yan and to tease her at the same.</p>

  <p>At that time, Evan was at the top of the Cloud Sect disciple list. That meant he was the strongest disciple among all disciples at Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>Yan had found it challenging to cope with Evan.</p>

  <p>But Yan was smart and found a way to lure Evan to bet with her.</p>

  <p>Evan was very strong, and his talent was far beyond that of other disciples. Even in such a huge sect, his skills and talents would ensure his promotion to principal disciple.</p>

  <p>Since he had won the final fight of the last All Peak Competition, he had the chance to pass Cloud Road and enter Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>It was said that Evan did go to Cloud Road, but during the examination, he felt tired and actually fell asleep...</p>

  <p>Being selected for Cloud Road was a dream that all disciples of Cloud Sect shared, regardless of whether they could pass it or not.</p>

  <p>But to everyone's surprise, Evan had fallen asleep there...</p>

  <p>Kenneth Shi was enraged due to Evan's behavior. He had thought that Evan would pass Cloud Road and become a principal disciple of Cloud Hall. But reality had been too far from his expectation. After Evan returned, Kenneth imprisoned him at Hell Mountain for a whole year!</p>

  <p>After that, everybody could see that Evan was a fool.</p>

  <p>Yan also understood that and made a bet with him. Of course, Evan lost.</p>

  <p>Yan was not as strong as Evan, but she was much smarter than Evan. She used her intelligence to trick him.</p>

  <p>Evan didn't learn his lesson and bet more than once with Yan.</p>

  <p>Evan lost a significant number of points during their first bet. After gambling against Yan the second time, he lost his sword. The third time, Evan had nothing worthy left to give, so they made a deal that every time Evan met her, he had to call her 'my queen'.</p>

  <p>Although Evan was not clever, he understood that it was humiliating to call a little girl "my queen", especially as he had been the strongest disciple at Cloud Sect and the girl was much younger than he was.</p>

  <p>From then on, Evan didn't dare to meet Yan anymore. He tried his best to avoid her. If he really had to confront her, he forced himself to call her, my queen.</p>

  <p>Three years ago, he won the All Peak Competition easily. And he had improved dramatically during these three years. Had he fought against Luo Luo Zheng, it would have been unfair, and everyone would feel as though he was bullying the weak.</p>

  <p>Since Elder Ge had agreed with the suggestion, Luo Luo Zheng didn't say anything else. He was willing to fight, of course.</p>

  <p>Although they could not use their life vitality, Evan was confident in his sword skills!</p>

  <p>"Since we will only fight with sword skills, you cannot complain that I bully you, and you must admit defeat if you lose. Are you agreeable?"</p>

  <p>Evan asked while staring at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded, "I understand that sword skills have nothing to do with a person's strength. It depends on how much we learned. Of course, I won't say that you bully me."</p>

  <p>"Good," Evan replied. With a quick nod, Evan smiled and removed a sword from his space ring. The sword looked ordinary and of a low quality. Despite its appearance, the sword was a top-grade mysterious weapon.</p>

  <p>Being the strongest disciple of Cloud Sect, it was expected that Evan would use a fairy weapon or even a middle-grade one. No one thought that Evan would use a mysterious weapon.</p>

  <p>It was common for outer disciples to use a top-grade mysterious weapon.</p>

  <p>Evan knew that the sword's quality was too low for him, but he only laughed in embarrassment.</p>

  <p>He had owned a fairy weapon, but he had lost the bet and had to surrender it to Yan. And Yan never thought about returning the sword.</p>

  <p>So, Evan only had a mysterious weapon.</p>

  <p>"Ting!" A metallic sound was heard when Luo Luo Zheng took out his sword. He was serious now as he knew that Evan was stronger than Patrick.</p>

  <p>Although he looked a bit crazy, Luo Luo Zheng had a hard time identifying Evan's weakness.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng estimated that Evan was thrice as strong as Patrick.</p>

  <p>The thought that perhaps he wouldn't be able to defeat Evan, dawned on Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng knew that he had to try, even if they were only using sword skills.</p>

  <p>After all, as Luo Luo Zheng said before, sword skills had nothing to do with life vitality. But, Luo Luo Zheng knew that he had to take Evan seriously.</p>

  <p>"Good. You have great potential. But..." Evan stopped mid-speech and gazed at Luo Luo Zheng curiously. "Are you going to fight me with basic sword skills?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded and replied, "Yes, I am."</p>

  <p>"You are insulting me! I refuse to fight!" Evan shook his head and said,</p>

  <p>"If you don't want to battle, you can tell me. Why do you want to use basic sword skills to fight against me? Am I not strong enough for you?"</p>

  <p>"If you refuse to fight, you can admit defeat," Luo Luo Zheng answered calmly.</p>

  <p>"Admit defeat? That is ridiculous! You are asking me to admit defeat because you intend to use basic sword skills? Let's do it this way--I'll fight against you without a sword. If you can force me to use my sword during our match, I will call you, My Master!" After he finished his sentence, Evan returned his sword to his space ring. Evan laughed coldly.</p>

  <p>An indignant look replaced the curious expression he had before.</p>

  <p>Apparently, he was convinced that Luo Luo Zheng was humiliating him by only using basic sword skills.</p>

  <p>After hearing Evan's declaration, all the disciples, including Yan, and the masters looked at Evan as if he was a fool.</p>

  <p>They shook their heads and thought, 'Evan is really a fool.'</p>

  <p>Evan had cultivated in isolation for a long while. He hadn't had the chance to watch the process of the All Peak Competition. But most disciples had viewed it from the arena or through the Picture Slab.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had impressed everyone except Evan with his mysterious and powerful basic sword skills.</p>

  <p>Although Evan's position was high on the disciple list, none of the disciples thought Luo Luo Zheng would lose if they only fought with sword skills.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, they believed that even with Evan's skills, a draw would be the best result he could achieve.</p>

  <p>And now he wanted to battle Luo Luo Zheng without a sword. He hadn't considered that Luo Luo Zheng could force him to use his sword. If Luo Luo Zheng did, did he actually consider calling Luo Luo Zheng "My Master"? He was really naive!</p>

  <p>Previously, Evan had to suffer the humiliation of calling Yan, My Queen.</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng were to defeat him, wouldn't Evan look twice as foolish?</p>

  <p>Since Evan insisted on acting like an idiot all the time, no one reminded him of his past mistake. That meant that Evan had made a trap for himself and that he would step in it without any hesitation.</p>

  <p>"Okay. Since you insist, let's begin," Luo Luo Zheng replied. Luo Luo Zheng didn't want to say anything else to Evan. As soon as he finished speaking, Luo Luo Zheng attacked.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's first move was the most common one, stabbing levelly with all his strength focused on the tip of the sword. This sword skill was called horizontal stab.</p>

  <p>Evan had been indifferent at first. He was so confident that he believed he could avoid the attack with his eyes closed. Just as Evan took his first step, his face paled.</p>

  <p>"Gosh! This is..." At this moment, Evan's expression changed.</p>
