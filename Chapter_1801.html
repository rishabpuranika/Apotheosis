<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1801 Overpower This Great World's Will </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords were summoned here by Supreme Lord Mirage and Supreme Lord Sky.</p>

  <p>Upon arrival, the first thing they did was to protect the eight Godly Geniuses. Now that things had calmed down a bit, they were very eager to leave. Luo Luo Zheng, however, was determined to stay.</p>

  <p>Since the young man insisted, then they would not force him. They willingly left him there with Mu Ning before flying into the void.</p>

  <p>The space imprisonment must have been lifted since these Supreme Lords managed to come here.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was now left behind due to his decision to stay.</p>

  <p>He had a lot of things to address. No matter how the situation in the great world developed, it was his utmost priority to relocate Ning Yudie and the others to a safer place.</p>

  <p>With this in mind, he took both Ning Yudie and Mu Ning with him and left Cloud Hall. They eventually met up with Imogen and Luo Nian three hundred miles north of Cloudy City, and then also managed to run into Lewis, Patrick, and a few others.</p>

  <p>Then Luo Luo Zheng activated the token of mountain in front of everyone.</p>

  <p>He hadn't told them anything about the Immortal Mansion since it was something whose secrets he could not easily reveal to others. Given their current situation, however, Luo Luo Zheng figured that this place could serve as a temporary refuge for all of them. He didn't worry too much about them being there since the Immortal Mansion itself imposed restrictions everywhere and without his tokens they couldn't freely move around in the Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, however, did not enter the Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>Ever since his return to this great world, he felt something off. It was as if it had undergone some changes with its will which was really strange.</p>

  <p>One end of the great world was broken. That meant that two great worlds were connected to each other without any hindrances between them!</p>

  <p>He also discovered that the barrier at the other end of this great world was gone as well!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng tried to search through the memories of the great world's will for an explanation but he found nothing. Right now, however, he was sure of two things: the barriers were definitely destroyed by someone, and the person who destroyed them was most definitely not from around here.</p>

  <p>This was highly possible to be the work of the sorcerer race, as for their intentions of doing so, Luo Luo Zheng had no idea.</p>

  <p>This was his primary reason for staying.</p>

  <p>The turmoil in Cloud Hall plunged the entire Central Region into a panic.</p>

  <p>News of disaster always spread like wildfire. All of Cloud Hall's warriors had been dismissed and numerous people in Cloudy City spread out through various transmission channels.</p>

  <p>Central Region was their home. If they left, where would they go? Not everyone could pass through the storm in the Chaotic Ocean of Stars.</p>

  <p>Once Luo Luo Zheng arranged for everyone's safety, he quickly went to the back of the great world.</p>

  <p>On this side of the world was a void, completely shrouded in darkness.</p>

  <p>This was where Master Feng and the other Supreme Lords entered but they had already flown far away.</p>

  <p>After confirming the direction that they had gone in, Luo Luo Zheng decidedly flew into this void.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lords moved thousands of miles in an instant during their battles so Luo Luo Zheng figured that it might be impossible for him to catch up to them.</p>

  <p>Ten thousand miles away from Luo Luo Zheng, the enormous Torch Dragon was coiled high up in the air. On its huge head was a wisp of dim, strange fire. It's eyes gazed with sinister intent at its opponents.</p>

  <p>Its body was currently covered in wounds.</p>

  <p>Given the state of the Torch Dragon, it could most probably only contend against a mid-rank Supreme Lord. Unfortunately, it was currently faced with a number of powerful opponents: Master Feng, Supreme Lord of Original Sin, Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment, and Supreme Lord of Oracle; they were all top-rank Supreme Lords in the universe.</p>

  <p>There was no way that this sacred beast of the sorcerer race would be able to fight back.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Mirage had already flown away after sustaining major injuries during his fight with the Torch Dragon. Supreme Lord Sky, on the other hand, had already killed the supreme sorcerer and joined the attack against the sacred beast.</p>

  <p>All of the Supreme Lords were expressionless.</p>

  <p>They had all gathered here to do one thing - to eliminate the sorcerer race.</p>

  <p>This Torch Dragon was going to be extremely valuable to them once killed. Whether it be the eyes or the flame above its head, every single part of its body was going to be harvested as extremely precious material. The Supreme Lords were already thinking about how to divide the spoils amongst themselves.</p>

  <p>However, at that moment, countless war sorcerers prostrated themselves in front of a tower hidden deep within the core of the storm in the Chaotic Ocean of Stars.</p>

  <p>The grand sorcerer that led the group held a bone cane from which rose a Nether Flame. There was a hum as everyone chanted a complicated spell.</p>

  <p>As they chanted, the war sorcerers began to disintegrate one by one.</p>

  <p>Their bodies and souls transformed into dark-green flames as they vanished. These flames gathered together and strengthened the flame at the tip of the grand sorcerer's bone cane.</p>

  <p>The wisp had now transformed into a furious, burning flame!</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>The Nether Flame rose high into the air, like a violent pillar of fire. The grand sorcerer carefully raised it up and put it near the tower.</p>

  <p>"Sizzle..."</p>

  <p>Dark-green flames quickly sparked and spread all throughout the tower.</p>

  <p>"Uyaka!''</p>

  <p>It was the grand sorcerer who screamed the final chant before transforming into a Nether Flame himself to join the others.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the tower began to slowly rotate, gaining speed with each revolution. As it spun around, many tiny cracks began to appear on its surface.</p>

  <p>Crack, crack, crack?</p>

  <p>The tiny cracks continued to spread and expand as if there was something within the tower that wanted to escape!</p>

  <p>At the same time, the storm at the core of the Chaotic Ocean of Stars also grew stronger and the space itself began to crack under the devastating slashes of the wind blades.</p>

  <p>Space cracks continued to appear all over the area wherein the wind blades seeped through.</p>

  <p>"Boom..."</p>

  <p>The tower exploded inevitably.</p>

  <p>An invisible will then began to spread rapidly.</p>

  <p>And this storm helped this will to spread faster.</p>

  <p>Several hundred great worlds away, a similar tower also exploded. This place was called the "Wind God Forbidden Land" due to the stormland in this great world. Legend said that a wind god resided in the center of this storm. Even a Soul Sea Realm warrior had no chances of surviving this place's endless gust.</p>

  <p>As it exploded, an invisible will was also released.</p>

  <p>These weren't the only two towers to have done so. Other towers, all constructed by the sorcerer race, were exploding in succession all over the great worlds. These structures were erected with precise calculation and meticulous planning by the entire race.</p>

  <p>As these towers exploded, their wills began to spread through numerous great worlds. The barriers between different great worlds had been removed, which enabled the wills to spread even more effectively.</p>

  <p>Master Feng and the other Supreme Lords were still locked in a face-to-face battle with the huge Torch Dragon.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord of Original Sin was the first to initiate an attack. He was not afraid despite the beast's powerful, physical body.</p>

  <p>"Hiss!"</p>

  <p>The massive Torch Dragon twisted in midair with a sharp cry. To everyone's great surprise, it chose to retreat!</p>

  <p>How could they let this precious beast leave so easily? All the Supreme Lords turned into beams of light that surrounded the Torch Dragon.</p>

  <p>However, the will from the tower at the core of the storm had already spread out by this time. The Supreme Lords all felt it in the air and they stopped in their tracks as if someone had cast a spell on them.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng also felt it. A look of confusion fell on his face. "What is that..."</p>

  <p>This will was extremely domineering as if it wanted to directly overpower this great world's will!</p>
