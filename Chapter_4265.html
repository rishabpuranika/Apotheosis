<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>When Geoffrey still felt a little uneasy, he saw a blue light flashing from the left side of the mountain peak.</p>

  <p>Once the blue light chose an area and shone on it, many giants' figures appeared within that glow.</p>

  <p>They were all members of the Colossus race, and their number stretched over a thousand.</p>

  <p>"Master Ziya, let's flee from here!"</p>

  <p>Geoffrey cautioned as he raised the Heavenly Ring Staff.</p>

  <p>A burst of invisible wind swept violently downward, rolling the two of them up into the sky. They then left, carried on the wind.</p>

  <p>When the members of the Colossus race saw Geoffrey and Ziya depart, they didn't give chase at all, since they couldn't catch up to them.</p>

  <p>The leader of the Colossus race looked up at the sky and stated, "Master, they have escaped."</p>

  <p>Buzz, buzz, buzz...</p>

  <p>Colorful lights appeared above the heads of these members of the Colossus race. The colorful lights possessed varying flashes in length.</p>

  <p>They blended with each other. Soon, a giant roc-fish appeared and floated in the air.</p>

  <p>If Zheng had witnessed this scene, he would have recognized it. This was the Starry Roc-fish he had seen in the Soul City.</p>

  <p>The Starry Roc-fish was the mount of Kincaid. It was not a sentient being, but a ball of intelligent energy. As a member of the Four Spirits Sect, the Starry Roc-fish was probably the only one who had escaped the big disaster.</p>

  <p>For many years, it had been circling outside the chaos, and it could be observed in the Three Purities Stage.</p>

  <p>The Starry Roc-fish's voice was quickly transmitted, "Don't worry. They can't escape...</p>

  <p>As long as I don't remove this Absolute Existence Form, you won't really die.</p>

  <p>I will continue to project you and make you appear in front of them again and again until they are killed!"</p>

  <p>The Starry Roc-fish had been a sacred beast of the Colossus race all this time!</p>

  <p>The Colossus race, which had been born after the disaster, had been able to reach this level of development because of the kindness and mercy of the Starry Roc-fish.</p>

  <p>The leader and the members of this race were all subservient to the Starry Roc-fish.</p>

  <p>However, the members of the Colossus race hadn't noticed the change in the Starry Roc-fish. At the top of the originally colorful horns, there was now a bit of black light mixed in, and the Starry Roc-fish's pair of bright eyes were filled with conflicting colors.</p>

  <p>At this time, the Starry Roc-fish was no longer the sacred beast that had protected them for centuries.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh...</p>

  <p>After Geoffrey and Ziya had flown a safe distance in the air, they slowly descended to a forest of giant trees.</p>

  <p>Standing on the swingy boughs of one of the giant trees, the two of them were a little depressed. However, Ziya remained calmer, while Geoffrey began to complain, "We can't return! What's the use of me discovering this object?"</p>

  <p>As Geoffrey spoke, he raised the Heavenly Ring Staff and brandished it around.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Bang! Bang! Crack...</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Ring Staff smashed straight onto a tree trunk. How could a mere trunk withstand Geoffrey's power?</p>

  <p>Thus, the tree trunk snapped with a loud bang.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the Heavenly Ring Staff itself was not an ordinary object, and it didn't suffer any damages. The rough tree trunk was as hard as metal, but it still could not withstand the strike.</p>

  <p>Feeling the weight of his frustration, Geoffrey lost his temper again.</p>

  <p>Ziya remained silent.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey had no idea how to find the chaos.</p>

  <p>He was also quite certain of the consequences of not being able to return to the chaos.</p>

  <p>While Geoffrey was still venting his anger, another ray of blue light flashed on a treetop not far away.</p>

  <p>Just as before, the members of the Colossus race appeared within the radius of the blue light again!</p>

  <p>"You are everywhere! You fools are... courting death!"</p>

  <p>Geoffrey instantly and without hesitation wielded the Heavenly Ring Staff.</p>

  <p>"Geoffrey!"</p>

  <p>Ziya tried to stop Geoffrey from using the Heavenly Ring Staff, but he was too late. Nearly one-third of Geoffrey's power had been absorbed.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Ring Staff would use a fixed ability when dealing with a specific object.</p>

  <p>As the energy flashed from the Heavenly Ring Staff, another outburst of violent thunderbolts obliterated the members of the Colossus race.</p>

  <p>Boom...</p>

  <p>In the blinking of an eye, the members of the Colossus race were decimated.</p>

  <p>The loud thunderous roar made flocks of birds fly around in shock, screaming in fear.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey felt weakened after his strength had been extracted.</p>

  <p>Although his physical body was able to recover swiftly, it couldn't face his overuse of the power.</p>

  <p>As soon as he killed this group of giants, another ray of blue light drew a circle on the top of another tree. Those giants reappeared again!</p>

  <p>"Don't try to fight against them. Let's go!" Ziya urged.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey nodded and raised the Heavenly Ring Staff with all his remaining strength. Then he made use of the wind pressure to pull him and Ziya up into the sky again.</p>

  <p>Since the members of the Colossus race were able to follow them all over, he and Ziya were surely being tracked.</p>

  <p>Choosing to hide behind these giants, their opponent was not afraid of Geoffrey, but he surely feared the Heavenly Ring Staff in his hand.</p>

  <p>Once he noticed that Geoffrey's strength was depleted, their opponent would probably take action to snatch it away.</p>

  <p>Swoosh...</p>

  <p>"Master Ziya, is there anything that can replenish lost energy?"</p>

  <p>"Divine crystals.</p>

  <p>Do you want to eat some?"</p>

  <p>The Stellar World held a higher set of standards. When one relied on the materials from a lower-grade world to nourish themselves, the efficiency was extremely low.</p>

  <p>After flying across some distance, the two of them descended again.</p>

  <p>However, the situation remained the same as before. Whenever the two of them touched the ground, that blue light would appear. At the same time, the group of giants would be transported there, forcing Geoffrey to escape by flying into the sky again.</p>

  <p>After this happened for three or four times, Geoffrey felt that his strength had become even more weakened, and he was not recovering.</p>

  <p>If this continued, he would be doomed!</p>

  <p>Realizing this, Geoffrey suddenly made up his mind. "Take us to the top of the holy pillar!"</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The higher the world grade was, the more difficult it would be to use the spatial transference. Geoffrey didn't know if the Heavenly Ring Staff could be moved by means of the Grand Teleportation technique, nor did he know if his physical body could withstand that.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Ring Staff had almost drained the last of Geoffrey's physical strength. His energy was insufficient, and the Heavenly Ring Staff now even began to draw out his soul power!</p>

  <p>Geoffrey felt dizzy and almost fainted. Then the two of them were wreathed in a layer of blue light and immediately disappeared from the sky.</p>

  <p>The next moment, the two of them instantly appeared at the top of the holy pillar.</p>

  <p>Ziya stood there steadily, while Geoffrey was so weak that he almost crashed down on the pillar.</p>

  <p>"Sir, hurry up. Tell my father..."</p>

  <p>Currently, they probably wouldn't be able to enter the chaos. The only possibility was to ask Zheng to come out.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey had extracted the last of his strength in order to get to the pillar.</p>

  <p>Without saying a word, Ziya moved straight to the edge of the holy pillar.</p>

  <p>He put his finger on the light ray that connected to the Lone Sword and began to gently pull it.</p>

  <p>Previously, he had known how Geoffrey operated it.</p>

  <p>On the jadeite platform</p>

  <p>Zheng and the others were restlessly waiting.</p>

  <p>The distance from the holy pillar to the chaos was not great. Ziya would bring Geoffrey and descend from the Deleting Space at any moment now.</p>

  <p>As time ticked by, Zheng and the others became more and more impatient.</p>

  <p>"Why haven't they come back yet?"</p>

  <p>"Could it be that they can't descend from the Deleting Space?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe they can't find their way back..."</p>

  <p>"What happened?"</p>

  <p>Just as everyone began burning with anxiety, Tianming's Lone Sword began to tremble again, and new information was transmitted from the other side.</p>

  <p>"I'm Ziya. We can't locate the chaos and are unable to return!"</p>
