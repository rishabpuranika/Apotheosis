<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Nina's eyes glinted brightly with hope for Luo Zheng to win, as she also got lost in the same thoughts. The hand that tightly held the thunder stone in its grip still slightly trembled, but deep inside, she had realized that maybe, she had thought too much. Although Luo Zheng was only half-step into the nature level, it was true that he was a rare talent. Thus, it was no wonder that he got to keep the dragon under his control.</p>

  <p>Even though his opponent had reached the Illuminating Soul Realm, Luo Zheng had finally figured out a way against his opponent.</p>

  <p>She was happy that Luo Zheng at least got to hold his own ground against a much more capable contender.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Lenard, who held a black sword and a white one, was in total disbelief. Under the current situation, he had contemplated if he should still help Luo Zheng or not.</p>

  <p>It was true that Lenard was always too conceited. Although he didn't rank top ten in terms of strength on the Skytop Peak, he had a wealth of many other talents, wherein he had quickly reached one level after another at the fastest pace. Even if he was not in the top 10 rankings now, he would undoubtedly be included in the list in the future.</p>

  <p>No vain man wanted to owe a debt of gratitude. It was completely opposite to their character.</p>

  <p>Previously in the Sky Forest, Luo Zheng had saved Lenard's life. Because of that, he was protective of Luo Zheng in this battle against the general. However, it was simply because he wished to repay him the debt of gratitude.</p>

  <p>Strongmen who were at the Illuminating Soul Realm were surely powerful. However, unlike them who entered this realm, Lenard was also cultivating a mystical skill. Once he had harnessed this skill, his strength would be significantly enhanced over a short period of time. He had been confident that his abilities would help Luo Zheng reduce the general's strengths in half, but whether Luo Zheng could defeat the general or not still depended upon himself.</p>

  <p>Like all the other spectators preset, Lenard was also confused about which weird trick Luo Zheng had played. It came as no surprise that he was totally shocked by what Luo Zheng had achieved as well. Luo Zheng didn't flinch at all when faced with a fierce attack from the general who was at the Illuminating Soul Realm. He had even caught the five-clawed golden dragon and got it under his control. Lenard had never seen nor encountered anything more bizarre than this...</p>

  <p>At this point, some people in the audience such as Cleve, Qiu, and Gury had witnessed what a "trick" was.</p>

  <p>And just now, Luo Zheng had given "the trick" a brand new definition.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Zheng was able to battle the general who had entered the Illuminating Soul Realm despite the fatal attack on him, perhaps all inner disciples of the Drizzle Peak were no match for him.</p>

  <p>Henry and Gury were merely outer disciples, so naturally they weren't really clear about the situation of the inner disciples in Drizzle Peak.</p>

  <p>However, on the other hand, Cleve and Qiu caught a glimpse of each other when they witnessed that the tables had been turned on Luo Zheng. Both of them silently agreed on one thing.</p>

  <p>That was, although Drizzle Peak ranked the last among the thirty-three peaks, its inner disciples were absolutely not weak at all.</p>

  <p>Ever since Master Su came to Drizzle Peak, she had found several highly talented disciples in quick succession. All these talented ones diligently cultivated their abilities to accumulate even more superior skills so that one day, Drizzle Peak would be ranked among the top of the thirty-three peaks.</p>

  <p>In his opinion, Cleve had always been impressed by Harry Lu, Glenn Yu, and Charlie Liu who had ranked top three among the inner disciples.</p>

  <p>They all bore the expectations and hopes of Drizzle Peak.</p>

  <p>However, Cleve now found that Charlie was no match for Luo Zheng, so were Glenn and even Harry, who ranked Number One among the inner disciples of Drizzle Peak.</p>

  <p>Who was the dark horse then? From the current predicament of this battle, the answer was clear and definite. Luo Zheng, who was only an outer disciple, was the real dark horse.</p>

  <p>The five-clawed blackish purple dragon dominated by Luo Zheng revolved around him in several circles, but after a while he realized that it was impossible for him to make this dragon be with him all the time.</p>

  <p>The reason was very simple. It was because his life energy wasn't enough to let him dominate this dragon.</p>

  <p>Once life vitality was converted into substance, one would always have to transfer his life vitality to the substance continuously so that the substance could always exist.</p>

  <p>While Zheng's body differed from an ordinary person's, the life energy inside him was far stronger than other people who were at the same level as him. Nevertheless, it meant nothing at all for a strongman at the Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>A few moments ago, Luo Zheng had directly overwhelmed the general's five-claw golden dragon by his demonic life energy and turned it into a blackish purple dragon--but now� The dragon under his control spun around him while it incessantly consumed his demonic life energy.</p>

  <p>The dragon's ceaseless consumption of his life energy was so amazingly fast that Luo Zheng could already clearly see the drastic decline of his life energy near his navel.</p>

  <p>"Since it is impossible for me to always get this dragon under my control, then I will... Go! Go and treat him in the same way as he has treated me!" he shouted.</p>

  <p>He stretched a hand out and pushed the dragon gently as he yelled at it.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, the five-clawed dragon raised his head and roared. The ferocious sound echoed loudly throughout the arena and resonated strongly in the ears of everyone present.</p>

  <p>After a while, the dragon abruptly and wildly hurled its body forward in an alarming speed, in an attempt to pounce on the imperial army's general who stood far away.</p>

  <p>A spasm rippled out through the imperial army general's body when he saw the dragon rush towards him. Everyone would be in a sour mood to witness his opponent see through the trick, and now, the general was even going to be attacked by the very dragon that he unleashed to battle Luo Zheng...</p>

  <p>Without any more time for over thinking, the general posed one of his hands like a claw. Another five-clawed golden dragon showed up in his hand in a flash. Just like the former dragon, this one also lunged on the five-clawed blackish purple dragon.</p>

  <p>The dragons' bodies twisted and writhed violently against each other as they fought fiercely in the sky.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, their battle had come to an end.</p>

  <p>It turned out that the new golden dragon was far more vicious than the blackish purple one. After only battling for a few moments, it had torn the blackish purple dragon's body into pieces, and destroyed it into several parts.</p>

  <p>A self-satisfied smile made its way on the general's face at the final outcome of the battle. "The dragon under your control is just an illusion!</p>

  <p>Your dragon has given itself away immediately after battling my five-clawed golden dragon!" he said triumphantly.</p>

  <p>The truth was, the strengths of the two dragons weren't even on par with each other.</p>

  <p>First and foremost, the newer five-clawed golden dragon was converted from life vitality, but the blackish purple one was only formed by life energy. In other words, their natures completely differed from each other.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the golden dragon consumed life vitality which significantly enhanced its power by a mile.</p>

  <p>The battle was grueling and had everyone on the edge of their seats. The general had the upper hand at first. Then, Luo Zheng suddenly made a surprising move which turned the odds in his favor, but in the end, the general still won. Although the tables had been turned for his win, the imperial army general's smile didn't last long.</p>
