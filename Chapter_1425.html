<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>All that Freya had known about the supreme worlds was from hearsays and stories. The Upper World had always been described as a place so immense that one could only imagine its vastness.</p>

  <p>A normal warrior at the Soul Sea Realm would have to expend all his life earnings in order to use a space channel that linked supreme worlds.</p>

  <p>Even Simply traversing across the Spiritual Force Sacred Place would take a considerable amount of time.</p>

  <p>And yet here was Luo Zheng, a warrior who had travelled to a place which was more than a thousand worlds away. Furthermore, he came back! It was truly an incredible feat.</p>

  <p>Freya had no knowledge of the thirteen palaces that Master Shen had spoken of, but she seemed to have understood Zheng's history bit by bit. He was an extraordinary warrior. What could be his reason for appearing in an Ascending Well? He had even mined with her.</p>

  <p>The contradictions were tangled threads that she failed to unravel.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had spoken freely, but Master Shen did not probe into his true intentions of this trip.</p>

  <p>At some point in their conversation, Master Shen steered into another direction. Turning to Freya, he asked, "Young lady, you are Julian's niece and had also ascended to our Spiritual Force Sacred Place. I wonder what your plans for the future are."</p>

  <p>Master Shen was a clever man. He could see that Freya and Luo Zheng got along quite well, but he had gleaned from his earlier conversation with Luo Zheng that he was simply passing by, and by chance had saved this woman.</p>

  <p>It was likely that Luo Zheng would not bring Freya along as he headed to the Dark World. Master Shen's question spoke of another implication� knowing that Freya would not be travelling with Luo Zheng for long, he would be offering her a position in the sacred place.</p>

  <p>A faint smile crossed Zheng's lips for a moment. Master Shen was indeed a person of wisdom. He remained silent as the older man waited for Freya's answer. Luo Zheng and Freya were acquaintances at best, and they had yet to be closer to consider each other friends.</p>

  <p>The question made Freya turn nervous. "I...I don't know..." she stammered.</p>

  <p>Her thoughts swirled wildly in her head as she considered the question.</p>

  <p>She had gone to her own uncle, but he had offered her nothing but disappointment. He offered her no assistance, and had even wanted to send her off to another man as a gift. Now that her uncle was dead, she had no direction. No clear answer came to her even as she pondered over the question.</p>

  <p>Master Shen's next words came as a surprise. "If you would like, I can help you enter the Myriad Spiritual Force House of our Spiritual Force Sacred Place. It would give you a chance to hold the position of a city lord in the future. I can keep your uncle's position for you. What do you think?" he said with a smile.</p>

  <p>'The Myriad Spiritual Force House? A city lord?'</p>

  <p>Freya's thoughts were all in a muddle. There had been no earlier indication from the older man that he would be offering her such a big opportunity. She gaped at him wordlessly for some moments before finally being able to respond.</p>

  <p>'Entering the Myriad Spiritual Force House to cultivate and taking over my uncle's position?'</p>

  <p>She felt as if her feet had left the ground and she was floating in the air.</p>

  <p>She was on cloud nine. How had she come across such wonderful fortune?</p>

  <p>None of this would have been possible if not for the man who was standing not far from her.</p>

  <p>Back then, Freya had persuaded Luo Zheng to go with her and visit her uncle.</p>

  <p>Now she felt like she was a fool.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked at Freya, who appeared to be deep in thought. It was true that it would not be convenient for him to bring her to the Dark World.</p>

  <p>Danger awaited at every corner, and truthfully speaking, she would be of little help.</p>

  <p>Now that Master Shen took the initiative to propose such generous conditions, Luo Zheng thought that Freya would definitely accept.</p>

  <p>Freya's eyelashes trembled. There was an excited glint in her bright eyes, but its light disappeared the next moment. She cast her gaze downward and took a deep breath.</p>

  <p>"Master Shen, I'm sorry, but I cannot accept," she said, her voice firm with resolve.</p>

  <p>As these words left her mouth, Luo Zheng and Master Shen were both stunned.</p>

  <p>What Master Shen had just offered her was a great chance. They could find no reason for her not to agree.</p>

  <p>Recovering from his surprise, Master Shen proceeded to ask, "I wonder what the reason is behind your decision."</p>

  <p>Freya suddenly stood up and walked towards Luo Zheng, her eyes fixed on his steadily. She knelt down towards him and said, "Luo Zheng, you saved my life.</p>

  <p>I don't know how I can ever repay you. Please let me stay by your side and serve you."</p>

  <p>Her face was set in a serious expression.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Master Shen knew how terribly he had underestimated her. A look of pleasant surprise crossed his face as he secretly praised,</p>

  <p>'This girl is smart.'</p>

  <p>She was able to figure out the parts of the situation the two men chose not to reveal and had pieced the puzzle on her own. The reason why Master Shen made such a generous offer was because of Luo Zheng. It was a perfectly good opportunity, but Freya herself knew that if she could stay at Zheng's side, it would work more to her advantage in the long run.</p>

  <p>However, these thoughts were only half right. It was true that Freya wanted to stay at Zheng's side because she knew that the benefit would be far greater. However, there was another more personal reason. She didn't know yet what exactly she wanted. Nevertheless, Luo Zheng had saved her life, and she had a debt to repay.</p>

  <p>She had nothing. No valuable possessions, no wealth, and even the few precious treasures in her space ring were unlikely to interest Luo Zheng. The only thing she had left was herself and her skills. After a moment's hesitation, she made this bold decision.</p>

  <p>This put Luo Zheng in a bit of a difficult position.</p>

  <p>Master Shen remained silent. He was curious what Luo Zheng would do next.</p>

  <p>Freya knelt in front of him with a resolute expression. She had a determined Mu Ning, her body taut with seriousness.</p>

  <p>After a brief moment of consideration, Luo Zheng reached a hand out to Freya and helped her up. Flashing her a small smile, he said, "Don't say such unnecessary things. I don't need a servant. If you want to follow me and risk your life, then you are free to do so."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had already been travelling far and long. He had no need for a servant� he was perfectly capable of taking care of himself. However, when he saw the determination in Freya's eyes, he couldn't find it in him to refuse.</p>

  <p>If they found themselves in a precarious position, he could just transport Freya inside the fairy palace for her safety. The mountain token in his possession would be a useful card in this gamble.</p>

  <p>Only then did a smile appear on Freya's face. She had her own doubts if she had made the right decision, but she had already steeled herself even in the Lower World to face the dangers of the Upper World straightforwardly. Otherwise, her ascent to the Upper World would have all been for nothing. She would look unflinchingly even at death.</p>

  <p>A great world in the Lower World was more than enough to accommodate a Soul Sea Realm warrior like her. Countless creatures bowed their heads before her. She would always be a superior existence.</p>

  <p>Freya was nobody when she ascended to the Upper World. Just like everyone else, she had to start at the very beginning. There was no place for fear and troubled thoughts after she had come this far. If she just wanted peace and stability, she would have stayed in the Lower World.</p>

  <p>As of this time, Luo Zheng had been staying in Master Shen's palace for more than half a month.</p>

  <p>Throughout this time, he continued to cultivate diligently, not even sparing a moment to rest.</p>

  <p>Apart from cultivation, he was also still reflecting on the Gods-intimidating Strike that he had just comprehended.</p>

  <p>The most profound aspect of the technique was still beyond him. Perhaps he would never be able to unleash that sword strike unless he abandoned all emotions.</p>

  <p>It was a task that demanded much, but Supreme Lord Sword had perfectly executed it.</p>

  <p>It was not that Luo Zheng overestimated himself and compared himself to a Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>It was just that he already had a rough notion of the Gods-intimidating Strike's secret.</p>

  <p>In the legends of the Upper World, it was said that one could become a True God after abandoning his emotions.</p>

  <p>The very few Supreme Lords who were able to jump out of the heavens were the ones that could successfully sever ties to their mortal nature and lay claim to a True God's character. Only then would they have the qualifications to become True Gods.</p>

  <p>Abandoning all of one's emotions was a feat that troubled even Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>Like those who were cursing at each other with the Roaring Tokens, all of them possessed violent tempers, and this anger was the most difficult to subdue.</p>

  <p>Despite their unbelievable strength, this was the task of a lifetime.</p>

  <p>Even Supreme Lord Sword had yet to become a True God.</p>

  <p>However, the power of his sword strike would be enough to face a True God. Legend had it that he had once injured one. There was only one explanation for this. His Gods-intimidating Strike had been executed in a completely emotionless state, but he was still unable to completely relinquish his emotions. Had he done so, he would have long since become a True God.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Sword must have used some other method as replacement, or perhaps he had found a way to reach a state when he was free of emotions. Luo Zheng pondered for a long time, thinking of what method Supreme Lord Sword had used.</p>
