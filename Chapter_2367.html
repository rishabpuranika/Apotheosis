<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>In his hands, Zheng held the Great Weighty Sword tightly and fixed himself on the snake's head.</p>

  <p>As he bumped and jolted along the way, he ended up face to face with the beams at the top of the temple. He was so close that at times, he was pressed and even rubbed up against the ceiling.</p>

  <p>Thanks to his powerful physical body though, such a collision wouldn't cause him any harm. On the contrary, in fact, the Heavenly Wheel Temple's ceiling was instead pitted by him.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>Rachelle, who was firmly fixed on the other side of the snake's head, went through the same thing. Both she and Zheng were currently facing the same fate.</p>

  <p>She was in a position higher than Zheng. As the Heavenly Wheel Snake continued retreating, her head, of course, crashed onto countless beams.</p>

  <p>Although she was a consummate True God and her body's physical strength was much stronger than that of an ordinary True God, it was safe to say that her body wasn't as strong as Zheng's. Moreover, Zheng's body was protected by a layer of Redemption Armor, which was extremely secure. After several rounds of collisions, she felt dizzy.</p>

  <p>She looked a mess with the pieces of broken stone in her hair and grey-black ashes on her face.</p>

  <p>From the opposing side of the snake's head, Zheng sent her a glance just fast enough to reveal a faint smile. Having caught a glimpse of his expression, Rachelle flew into a rage and shouted, "What the hell are you laughing at?"</p>

  <p>Zheng shrugged his shoulders and the smile on his lips only spread wider.</p>

  <p>Just as Rachelle was about to abuse him angrily, her head made contact into a beam again, causing it to smash. She was dazed.</p>

  <p>In contrast, Shahn, hanging low, was feeling much better. His cyan sword was nailed to the huge snake's side, and he stood on his tiptoes on the hilt. Even though the snake's head was shaking in irregular rhythm, he maintained his balance as would a solid, mature mountain.</p>

  <p>As he noticed Rachelle's messy face and hair, he couldn't help himself from laughing out loud.</p>

  <p>Rachelle was so angry that with her temper, she might just roll right over to the other side of the snake's head and kick Zheng straight off.</p>

  <p>Despite her desire, the snake head was retreating back far too fast. If she was accidentally thrown down to the ground, it would be difficult to keep up with it. She couldn't take such a risk.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Wheel Snake continued to withdraw toward the depths of the Heavenly Wheel Temple.</p>

  <p>The consummate True Gods behind the snake followed Zheng all the way, and at the end of the line was Nelly. Her speed was much slower than the others' at the moment.</p>

  <p>It wasn't before long that a whole five minutes had passed.</p>

  <p>Nobody knew how the Heavenly Wheel Snake had reached the bottom of the ground exactly, and the surroundings were completely immersed in darkness.</p>

  <p>Zheng clenched the hilt of his Great Weighty Sword, activating his magical eyes in order to look around in the pitch blackness. Now that he could see again, he discovered that this was still the inner part of the Heavenly Wheel Temple. He hadn't expected it to be so large. According to the distance that the Heavenly Wheel Snake retreated, this part of the Heavenly Wheel Temple was hidden underneath the desert and probably ran several million feet deep.</p>

  <p>He couldn't help but wonder how such a huge building had been built out here, right in the middle of such a vast desert.</p>

  <p>At least another five minutes had passed, and Zheng felt a ray of light coming from up ahead. Thanks to the sudden burst of light, he saw the temple had reached its end. At the exit near the temple's base stretched a thick, round pillar.</p>

  <p>All around this pillar was a whole other world.</p>

  <p>The lights of different colors spread out like spider webs, wrapping the upper, lower, left and right sides of the enormous pillar.</p>

  <p>"This is... Is this the path of time?" Zheng questioned, feeling slightly shocked.</p>

  <p>On both Rachelle's and Shahn's faces could be seen a hint of surprise. Of course, they too, were shocked by the scene before their eyes.</p>

  <p>As they had entered the jade seal world through a path of time too, they obviously recognized the light rays.</p>

  <p>"Those insects..." Zheng's eyes narrowed as he wondered aloud.</p>

  <p>Black insects crawled up and down, side to side, on the noodle-like lights. There were so many of them that it was impossible to count.</p>

  <p>When Zheng had entered the path of time, he had seen two True Gods being swallowed practically whole by these insects. What was more, a black insect had even come out of the path of time, trying to drag Zheng back in. It tried hard, but in the end, Zheng slashed off its pair of pincers and the nasty insect was forced to retreat.</p>

  <p>"What do these insects have to do with the giant Heavenly Wheel Bugs?" Zheng's eyebrows furrowed a little more.</p>

  <p>Constructing space wasn't anything special or unusual for Zheng and the other consummate True Gods. In fact, they all had an intact space within their cinnabar fields, and it was even possible that their inner worlds were more complete than the one in the jade seal.</p>

  <p>However, in general space, time would go on just the same. Even this world's controller had no other choice but to let time move forward naturally. It was now impossible to change the world back to its past.</p>

  <p>It appeared as though the world made by the jade seal had to be greatly related to the time. This would explain why the path of time was opened in the first place.</p>

  <p>After being coiled around in circles on this huge pillar, the Heavenly Wheel Snake finally came to an unpleasant stop.</p>

  <p>"Hiss..."</p>

  <p>A tongue popped out of the snake's huge mouth and its long, pointy fangs were bared. It raised its huge head to spin around the pillar. It wanted to throw Zheng and the others out.</p>

  <p>There was nothing surrounding the pillar, and only black insects crawled the surface of the noodle-like lights. If Zheng and the rest were really to fall inside, they'd be stretched into noodles and eaten alive. Their fate wasn't bright.</p>

  <p>Zheng, Shahn and Rachelle all realized the danger at once. They no longer took the situation lightly and grasped their swords' hilt even tighter.</p>

  <p>However, being shaken around wildly, Zheng felt that something wasn't right. His Great Weighty Sword that had been stuck deep into the snake's head was now slipping out inch by inch. If it slid out to a certain limit, Zheng would probably be thrown out along with his sword!</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Wheel Snake probably noticed the sword too, and it quickened the pace of its swinging head.</p>

  <p>After six or seven shakes, the snake's head suddenly flew downward.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's Great Weighty Sword slid completely out of its head.</p>

  <p>Barely a few seconds later, Rachelle's short sword was also thrown off the snake, and both she and Zheng were flung down together.</p>

  <p>Over and done with, it seemed that Rachelle had already prepared for such an occurrence. After leaping high into the air, she pulled a chain out from her space ring. One end of the chain was connected to the machete in her hand, which she abruptly shot upward. It circled around wildly in the sky above before embedding itself deeply into the Heavenly Wheel Snake's body. Once complete, she freely swung herself back up.</p>

  <p>As Rachelle was swinging, she zoomed by Zheng. Zheng was in the air not too far off, and she stared at him with her beautiful eyes. A mocking smile appeared on her face. "Go to hell!" she cursed. It was her turn to laugh at him.</p>

  <p>As she fixed her gaze on Zheng, who was undoubtedly going to die, she inexplicably felt a sense of peace in her heart.</p>

  <p>She watched Zheng falling a good thirty to forty feet down and as she did, she noticed a silver light suddenly flash in his hand. A huge silver sword was formed beneath his feet! She couldn't believe her eyes.</p>

  <p>In a moment of desperation, Zheng had suddenly remembered the Space-striking Ring in his hand.</p>

  <p>He stomped on the hilt of the huge silver sword, and an extremely powerful force exploded forth. His entire body shot upward once again.</p>

  <p>With a leap, he jumped onto the Heavenly Wheel Snake's back. He was not in the same position as Rachelle.</p>

  <p>As Zheng caught his balance, the huge silver sword made from the Space-striking Ring had turned into a silver light. It was shooting toward the void and firing into the noodle-like lights.</p>

  <p>When the huge silver sword shot into the glow, it also turned into a silver light ray and flowed rapidly along with the other light rays.</p>

  <p>A black insect that lay on a light ray didn't even have time to dodge before it was pushed over by the silver light and killed instantly.</p>

  <p>"You're quite the tough one to kill!"</p>

  <p>It had never occurred to Rachelle that Zheng would use this method in order to get back onto the Heavenly Wheel Snake's body. She was pissed alright, but still impressed.</p>

  <p>Before Zheng was even standing completely still, she drew back the chain that circled the beams and the snake's body, and with one foot, she stepped on the machete that connected with the chain. She pressed it further and further into the Heavenly Wheel Snake's body, making sure that she wouldn't fall anymore. After that, she grabbed the chain and turned into a red light once more, rushing toward Zheng.</p>

  <p>Of course, Zheng had no desire in admitting that he was inferior. With a flick of the Great Weighty Sword in his hand, the two of them began fighting violently on the Heavenly Wheel Snake's back anew.</p>

  <p>Only Shahn was left alone, holding the snake's head. He also noticed that his cyan sword was being thrown out little by little. If it went on like this, he would eventually fall down, sooner or later. Shahn couldn't help shouting out at Rachelle, "Rachelle, you should save me first! Please! I'll take that guy's life for you!"</p>
