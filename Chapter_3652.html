<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Elizabeth landed, followed by more than a dozen Corpse Spirit Sun Crows.</p>

  <p>Dugan saw them and scoffed disdainfully, "It took you so long to get just these few Corpse Spirit Sun Crows back?" He raised a brow in Zheng's direction. "You even kept that bastard alive."</p>

  <p>As far as Dugan was concerned, it was because of Elizabeth's carelessness that the Sun Crow race lost the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows. The least she could do was to get them back.</p>

  <p>Dugan sneered. He had thought with her long departure, she would have managed to retake more of the beasts. But she even failed to kill Zheng.</p>

  <p>"I tried my best," Elizabeth said weakly, avoiding meeting Dugan's eyes.</p>

  <p>Dugan rolled his eyes and shifted them onto Zheng and Libby. He smirked at Zheng. "I don't know why you threw yourself into the net, but feel free to go to hell together with that beautiful girl!"</p>

  <p>The fire net that had been broken by Zheng was restored to its original state. It began to shrink at an alarming speed.</p>

  <p>Libby was still confused, but Zheng hadn't answered her question.</p>

  <p>She gritted her teeth. "I have no other choice..."</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Three ice crystals emerged over Libby's head. They were Snow Ice Crystals from Stage Twenty-nine of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>As soon as the Snow Ice Crystals appeared, the temperature around Libby dropped sharply.</p>

  <p>A big ice cocoon enveloped her and Zheng.</p>

  <p>The ice cocoon had amazing defensive effect. It could not be broken by even 20, 000 divine megatons of force.</p>

  <p>However, the Snow Ice Crystal could only serve as passive defense, and could not be used as a main Other Shore Token. Back then, Libby had merged with this Other Shore Token because she thought it might come in handy some time.</p>

  <p>Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!</p>

  <p>The surface of the ice cocoon pushed into the fire net. The blazing flames started to melt the firm ice, slowly but surely.</p>

  <p>"At this rate, the ice cocoon can only hold for half a minute at the most.</p>

  <p>Once it's all melted, we're still dead," Libby said with a trembling voice, desperate and helpless.</p>

  <p>She turned to look at Zheng and was surprised to see that he looked quite calm, without the slightest trace of panic.</p>

  <p>She wondered angrily how he could be so unperturbed at a time like this.</p>

  <p>Zheng looked Dugan straight in the eye and motioned toward Dugan's side.</p>

  <p>"Watch your left."</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled.</p>

  <p>Puzzled, Libby looked to the left of Dugan.</p>

  <p>So did Dugan.</p>

  <p>A few thoughts raced across his head as he turned to look. The icy cocoon was holding on for now, but not for long.</p>

  <p>It seemed the fire net would kill Zheng and Libby quite soon.</p>

  <p>But Zheng didn't look like a person on the verge of death at all. He even had the gall to continue chatting with him. Now what could be so important on his left?</p>

  <p>Dugan's eyes landed on Elizabeth.</p>

  <p>The moment Dugan turned his head, Elizabeth approached him and grabbed his neck with one hand.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing?" he cried out.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth's only answer was a ball of flame in her palm.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Elizabeth used all her strength to attack Dugan, not to kill him, but to exhaust the Chaotic Source Spirits in his body.</p>

  <p>Dugan was stupefied that Elizabeth would attack him.</p>

  <p>The Chaotic Source Spirits in Dugan's body began to lose power under the force and the divine flame of the Sun Crow race combined.</p>

  <p>Now that Dugan's Chaotic Source Spirits were depleted, his physical strength became negligible.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth cut her fingertip lightly, infusing a drop of her blood into the meridian on Dugan's neck.</p>

  <p>"Have you gone mad? What is this, Elizabeth?"</p>

  <p>Dugan covered his neck with his hand and stepped back. Of course his first thought was that Elizabeth had betrayed their race, but if that were so, why hadn't she killed him?</p>

  <p>Libby was as confused as Dugan.</p>

  <p>She turned to look at Zheng. "What the hell is going on? What are you two up to?"</p>

  <p>After Zheng appeared, Libby had been expecting a fight, not this inexplicable scene.</p>

  <p>"Just wait and see," Zheng said in a flat tone.</p>

  <p>Stumbling away from Elizabeth, Dugan suddenly felt a fierce pain from his neck, spreading all over his body rapidly. The blood in his entire body felt like it was boiling as it was assimilated by the blood Elizabeth had just infused him with.</p>

  <p>The pain went on for a while before subsiding as quickly as it began. There seemed to be nothing wrong with Dugan's body now except for the exhausted Chaotic Source Spirits within him.</p>

  <p>"Elizabeth, if you don't explain this to me right now, I'll kill you along with them!" Dugan screamed, seething.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth heaved a deep sigh.</p>

  <p>The bloodline worship was a kind of faith rooted in their blood. The culture of the Sun Crow race, entrenched across generations, made this faith stronger than steel. Elizabeth felt that she was somehow betraying her Emperor Charm like this, but she literally had no control in the matter.</p>

  <p>Now that there was someone else caught in this dilemma though, she started to feel a little better.</p>

  <p>"Ask him," Elizabeth said, pointing at Zheng.</p>

  <p>Confused, Dugan and Libby turned to look at Zheng again. The shadow of Emperor Charm now appeared above his head, making a pronouncement,</p>

  <p>"When you see Zheng, consider him as you would me. Obey his orders unconditionally."</p>

  <p>"Why you..."</p>

  <p>Dugan was about to curse Zheng for that vague illusion of Emperor Charm.</p>

  <p>But just then, an overwhelming force took over him. "Yes, I will do as Zheng commands," he ended up saying.</p>

  <p>Libby's mouth hung open in surprise at this turn of events.</p>

  <p>She seriously wanted to hurl profanities right now.</p>

  <p>It all seemed like a charade, but she knew this was all real.</p>

  <p>"And we have the second one. Very good." Zheng smiled faintly. He glanced up at the sky.</p>

  <p>High above the Oneness Array, the Lofty Swords and the members of the Sun Crow race continued to fly around, caught in a fierce battle.</p>

  <p>What the Oneness Sky Palace could really use right now was some higher-caliber combat power.</p>

  <p>The strength of Emperor Charm's royal guards alone could match that of the leaders and powerful warriors of the seven mountains.</p>

  <p>If Zheng could infuse the blood into these guards, they would all be under his control and would serve their side instead.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth had been the first infusion. Dugan was the second.</p>

  <p>"Explain to me what the hell is going on. Right now!" Libby shouted, frustrated at not having been given a straight answer all this time.</p>

  <p>In response, Zheng only said, "Please melt the ice cocoon."</p>

  <p>"Just answer my question, or I swear I'll lock you in here for the rest of your life!" As she said this, the Snow Ice Crystals above her head flashed with light. The ice cocoon grew thicker.</p>

  <p>Zheng gave Libby an exasperated look. He didn't understand why she was so angry, but it seemed he had no choice but to explain. "I just had some means to make them defect. All you have to know is that they are now subject to my control."</p>

  <p>Having gotten a simple answer, Libby reluctantly opened the ice cocoon.</p>

  <p>She actually still didn't understand exactly what Zheng did, but it seemed he was telling the truth. After all, two prominent members of the Sun Crow race, Elizabeth and Dugan, were indeed obeying his orders.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A group of Corpse Spirit Sun Crows arrived. Libby watched Zheng stand on one and take to the sky. She was left in a daze, bracing against the updraft of their flight.</p>
