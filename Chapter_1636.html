<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>After exploring a secret land, Malachi had obtained three Exemption Medallions.</p>

  <p>He would be invincible with the power of the Saint Killing Spear.</p>

  <p>After offering himself up to the Saint Killing Spear, he could even kill Godly Geniuses, not to mention the ace talents.</p>

  <p>But this was possible only when he was in the wilderness�</p>

  <p>He would definitely kill Luo Zheng if he were to fight Luo Zheng in the wilderness, far from the main city!</p>

  <p>The good thing was that Malachi wouldn't lose Illusion Points even though he had offered himself to the spear.</p>

  <p>However, after Luo Zheng had toyed with him, Malachi was unable to restrain himself.</p>

  <p>The truth was that his best option was to lead Luo Zheng into the wilderness and slay him there. Right from the start, he felt that he could defeat and kill Luo Zheng using just his spear. But he lost that opportunity when he fell into a passive situation. That was the prime reason why he chose to sacrifice himself to the Saint Killing Spear.</p>

  <p>No doubt it was a foolish plan of action. He was right next to the main city. Even after he sacrificed himself, and his strength increased dramatically, it would still be a herculean task to kill Luo Zheng in the main city.</p>

  <p>As a result, his Saint Killing Spear was snatched away by Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>One could imagine just how perturbed Malachi was at this moment. He naturally had to find some way to vent his frustration. He saw Hailey standing not too far away and called out to her.</p>

  <p>Hailey trembled when she heard Malachi's command.</p>

  <p>"Don't go over to him," Janet whispered.</p>

  <p>Hailey felt a mix of emotions as she stood there motionless.</p>

  <p>"Bitch! Don't forget where you are right now!" Malachi yelled nastily as he stared at her. The corner of his mouth showed a hint of a sneer.</p>

  <p>Hailey was still in his palace. While she was in the Illusion Battlefield, perhaps he couldn't do anything to her, but once she left that place, she was just a toy to him.</p>

  <p>Hailey pursed her lips as sadness filled her eyes.</p>

  <p>Although she did not share her thoughts, Jeffrey and Janet could see that she didn't have a choice.</p>

  <p>She trudged towards Malachi.</p>

  <p>The evil smile on Malachi's face grew wider and wider. His conflict with Luo Zheng had started because of her. He had suffered a loss because of Luo Zheng, but there was nothing else Luo Zheng could do to him.</p>

  <p>When Hailey was halfway there, Luo Zheng stood between the two of them once again, and stared calmly at Malachi.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" Malachi demanded. His voice carried a hint of ridicule.</p>

  <p>"Let her go," Luo Zheng said softly.</p>

  <p>"No problem," Malachi laughed deviously. "Give me back my spear first!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng hesitated a little� He actually had plans to duplicate a Saint Killing Spear.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Malachi could also see that although Luo Zheng appeared apathetic, he valued his companions. Even though Hailey had only ventured into the Hall of Causality once with Luo Zheng, he wouldn't sit by idly and watch her suffer.</p>

  <p>"Hahaha� Take off your clothes and get everyone in the mood. Let's have an erotic dance from you!" Malachi ordered, staring lustily at Hailey.</p>

  <p>When the martial artists surrounding him heard his words, their eyes immediately lit up with lurid excitement.</p>

  <p>The women of the Demon Night were all noble and sophisticated. People hardly had a chance to see the beauty of their naked bodies.</p>

  <p>Deeply humiliated, Hailey gritted her teeth. "Malachi, I�" she stuttered.</p>

  <p>"Remember, you are not my woman, you are only my plaything. Don't forget your status. You have no choice!" The cruel smile on his face intensified.</p>

  <p>In Malachi's eyes, Hailey didn't have a choice in the outside world or the Illusion Battlefield!</p>

  <p>The reason was simple. Hailey's clan was not the only one in the Saint Spear Sect that had been controlled by him. Many people of the Saint Spear Sect, including Hailey's relatives were also imprisoned. It was now up to Malachi whether she and the others lived or died. If she didn't do as he said, she would risk everybody's lives.</p>

  <p>Hailey gritted her teeth and swept her gaze across Luo Zheng. She then asked softly, "Luo Zheng, will you and my queen return to Demon Night?"</p>

  <p>By "my queen," of course, she was referring to Xun, the Queen of Killings, who the Saint Spear Sect had always supported.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was slightly surprised by her question. Hailey was a reserved person. Although he had a general idea of what was going on between her and Malachi, it was impossible for him to guess the ins and outs of it.</p>

  <p>After all, he was not a prophet.</p>

  <p>"For six years, I've been waiting for the day when you and Xun would return and save me from that damned place!</p>

  <p>I'm very young, only twenty-eight years old, and I still have a chance to become an ace talent of the Demon Night. I don't want to be reduced to Malachi's plaything. I'm so much more talented than him!</p>

  <p>But I also know that a few years is not enough time. It's impossible to be that fast...</p>

  <p>I might... I might not be able to make it to that day..."</p>

  <p>Tears welled up in her eyes as she spoke.</p>

  <p>She wasn't the only one who was looking forward to this. The entire Saint Spear Sect was enduring humiliation and suffering as they struggled to survive. They were all waiting desperately for the day that Xun would return.</p>

  <p>Hailey was very clear about the consequences of defying Malachi. When she left the Illusion Battlefield, she would be very miserable in the future.</p>

  <p>But she also understood that even though Malachi was making things difficult for her, he was actually using her as a pawn to threaten Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Now that she understood his motives, she did not want to become a handle against Luo Zheng. At this point, she only wanted an answer from him.</p>

  <p>Looking at her expression, Zheng's heart was filled with tenderness.</p>

  <p>Helping Xun return to the throne had been a conundrum till now.</p>

  <p>He and Xun had gone to the Dark World and sent people back to the Demon Night, and then Viveca, Elspeth, Salvador, and Aneisha had told them that a secret was hidden in a star, but since Luo Zheng was trapped in the fairy palace, he had not been able to do anything for the past six years!</p>

  <p>What he didn't know was that so many people in the Demon Night had very high expectations of him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stared at her and reached out to wipe away the tears on her face.</p>

  <p>"Yes, we will!" he said nodding.</p>

  <p>It was a short answer, but it was all she needed to hear. After nodding, Hailey rubbed her eyes and walked towards her tormentor with a despairing expression on her face. "Malachi, in fact, I've always wanted to tell you that if not for your father, you would be nothing more than a piece of trash," she said proudly. She paused for a moment, and then continued, "And you're worse in bed."</p>

  <p>When she finished speaking, there was a relieved expression on her face and she was smiling triumphantly.</p>

  <p>She had endured enough all these years.</p>

  <p>Taciturn as she was, she had never talked so much.</p>

  <p>As a race, the Demon Night was a lot more open-minded about sex, so she spoke without any restraint.</p>

  <p>Still, as a man, it was the most insulting thing for a woman to expose his weaknesses in front of everyone, and Hailey, who was only one of his playthings, had dared to do so!</p>

  <p>"Pfft!"</p>

  <p>Not far away, Janet blushed slightly. She couldn't help but laugh.</p>

  <p>The warriors present there had strange expressions on their faces�</p>

  <p>Malachi was an ace talent, and a powerful warrior at the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>He couldn't possibly be bad in bed, right?</p>

  <p>Jeffrey put his palms together. His expression was calm, but the corners of his mouth turned up slightly.</p>

  <p>Coleman, on the other hand, was not quite so discreet. He snickered out loud; the laughter from his thick throat was incomparably ear-piercing.</p>

  <p>Malachi's face stiffened. He stared coldly at Hailey, wanting to rip her to pieces with his gaze. Despite his fury, he actually laughed. "Hahaha! I didn't expect that you would become so bold after entering the Illusion Battlefield. Very good, very good � Do you know what the price for your impudence will be?"</p>

  <p>"Death," she said calmly and confidently. At this point, her wish had been fulfilled by Zheng's promise. And in any case, she was tired of living like a slave to Malachi.</p>

  <p>"No," Malachi shook his head. "How can I let you die so easily? You must be well aware of the most powerful punishment that the Demon Night has given!"</p>

  <p>Hailey flatly replied, "Punishment of Eternal Night."</p>

  <p>"That's right. I am going to throw you and your entire clan into the Punishment of Eternal Night! I want you to experience torture in a way that you will never forget! Hahaha..." Malachi roared with excitement.</p>

  <p>This was the only outlet for his anger.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng sighed softly in his heart. All this was happening only because he wasn't strong enough. The sooner he gained more strength, the sooner he would be able to take Xun back to the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>Just then a booming voice sounded. "The rules of the Illusion Battlefield have changed, and the restrictions on battle will be lifted from the main cities, along with the restriction on flying."</p>
