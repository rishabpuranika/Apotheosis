<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>After being wrapped by those bubbles, their speed had seemed to be increased significantly. 'Bubbles?</p>

  <p>How were these bubbles produced? Was it because of the rotation of the axes?</p>

  <p>If so, I can make my knife rotate too!'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng thought to himself. Then he hooked his thumb slightly, and the broken flying knife which had been flushed away flew back immediately.</p>

  <p>The next time he threw out the flying knife, it was rotating at a very high speed too.</p>

  <p>However, although its rotating speed wasn't slower than that of the axes, all that appeared in the water were some swirls. And after a short while, the flying knife even stopped rotating because of the water resistance.</p>

  <p>'It seems that the bubbles were not produced by the mere rotation of the axes. They must have used some other method!' Luo Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>In order to find the answer, when those blue Murlocs attacked him again, Luo Zheng reached out and tried to grab an ax while dodging the attack of the other ones.</p>

  <p>But the moment he touched the ax, he felt a sharp pain in his hand.</p>

  <p>He was shocked and drew his hand back immediately.</p>

  <p>He found that several tiny wounds had appeared on his hand.</p>

  <p>If his body hadn't been as solid as a spiritual weapon, Luo Zheng might have lost his hand there and then.</p>

  <p>'I got it!'</p>

  <p>He suddenly understood why those axes could produce so many bubbles.</p>

  <p>In the course of their rotating, they were vibrating at an extremely fast speed, which was why a large number of bubbles were being produced.</p>

  <p>After being wrapped by these bubbles, the axes would rotate like in the air, so their rotation speed increased significantly.</p>

  <p>However, how did they manage to vibrate those axes?</p>

  <p>Now Luo Zheng wasn't eager at all to dive downwards. Since his purpose of coming to the Lake of the Magical Fish was to cultivate, if he could acquire some skills while in the lake, then the points he had spent would be worth it.</p>

  <p>Taking the advantage of his speed, Luo Zheng had left those blue Murlocs far behind.</p>

  <p>Although these axes were a threat to Luo Zheng, they were not enough to kill him. Moreover, since he was in a magic array, even if he was killed because of his own mistakes, he wouldn't die in reality, and would be merely sent back to the surface of the Lake of the Magical Fish instead.</p>

  <p>After keeping a certain distance from those blue Murlocs, Luo Zheng began to attract the axes to attack him.</p>

  <p>When a Murloc was just about to throw his ax, Luo Zheng suddenly saw his short but strong paw become a blur.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the ax in his hand turned into a blur too.</p>

  <p>'I didn't guess it wrong. The Murloc's paw was vibrating rapidly at the moment he threw out his ax!' Luo Zheng stared closely at the Murloc who was about to throw the ax.</p>

  <p>With the rapid vibration, a lot of tiny bubbles appeared. After reaching a certain number, the bubbles wrapped the ax completely, and it was then that the Murloc thew the ax out.</p>

  <p>The world was big and full of remarkably wonders. Flowers, plants, animals, and birds were all unique and they each had their own unique set of skills.</p>

  <p>Strictly speaking, the blue Murloc wasn't a mighty creature. However, they still had their own specific skill.</p>

  <p>There weren't many other creatures who could vibrate at such a high speed. However, the blue Murlocs had done it with their strong front paw.</p>

  <p>The corporeal body of an ordinary man couldn't increase his vibration frequency to such a horrible level.</p>

  <p>However, it wan't a problem for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Because first, his corporeal body was much tougher than that of an average man, he could bear the negative effects caused by such intense vibrations. Second, the Phoenix Crystal embedded in his right arm had increased his speed significantly.</p>

  <p>After knowing what had caused the vibration, Luo Zheng flashed through the water and dodged the ax which was flying right towards him.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, he pulled his broken flying knife back and held it tightly in his hand.</p>

  <p>The power of the Phoenix Crystal came out from his arm and spread all over his arm along the meridian of it.</p>

  <p>"Vibration?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng narrowed his eyes and began to swing his right arm up and down.</p>

  <p>At the beginning, he swung his arm in a large range, as if he was waving it.</p>

  <p>However, soon his swing range became smaller and his strokes became shorter.</p>

  <p>With the smaller swing range, his speed became faster.</p>

  <p>After a short while, his arm started turning into a blur gradually. Because of the extremely high vibrating speed, one couldn't even distinguish that it was an arm!</p>

  <p>At the same time, a large number of tiny bubbles came out along his arm.</p>

  <p>With the sound of gurgles, his arm started looking like it was covered by boiling water. As soon as the bubbles came out, they started floating upwards in the lake.</p>

  <p>In addition to Zheng's arm, the broken flying knife in his right hand was also vibrating at an extremely high speed.</p>

  <p>"Hit it!"</p>

  <p>With the high speed vibration, Luo Zheng suddenly thew the broken flying knife out.</p>

  <p>"Glug! Glug..."</p>

  <p>Of course, no sound of air breaking could be heard in the water.</p>

  <p>However, a string of intense and tiny bubbles appeared when the broken flying knife flew out.</p>

  <p>With the technique, the speed of the broken flying knife had increased more than tenfold!</p>

  <p>It flew only a little bit slower than it did in the air. And in the heavy water, such speed was already an amazing horror.</p>

  <p>Now Zheng's broken flying knives had dwarfed the axes thrown out by those blue Murlocs.</p>

  <p>The blue Murloc not far away could never have expected that Luo Zheng would have copied their method in such a short time. As soon as he saw the flying knife coming towards him with a string of bubbles, he thrust forward with his frog-leg like legs, trying to run away.</p>

  <p>Of course Luo Zheng wouldn't let go of him. Although the Murloc had already dodged the flight route of the broken flying knife, as soon as Luo Zheng pulled it, the broken flying knife arced in the water and cut at him who was immediately transformed into bright spots.</p>
