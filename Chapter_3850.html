  <p>
</p>

  <p>Usman hadn't fully grown up yet, so he was still much weaker than his previous self in the past.</p>

  <p>Moreover, no one could tell how powerful a fully grown Usman would be.</p>

  <p>The leaders of the super forces concluded that he could control the entire Source World in the future. He had so much potential that once he had fully grown up, no one would be on a par with him.</p>

  <p>However, Usman's betrayal of the Black Ship gave them a severe headache back then. On the contrary, the other super forces were pleased since the Black Ship was notorious all over the Source World.</p>

  <p>Still, Usman's unrestrained growth worried them. Therefore, they finally helped the Black Ship kill Usman.</p>

  <p>The only thing was, Usman was already very strong even though he hadn't fully grown up yet.</p>

  <p>Of course, Fuxi was much more powerful. He marked his opponent with the Eight Diagrams and left no space for him to dodge his punches.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>Thus, Usman got reduced to an immovable live target.</p>

  <p>Now that he couldn't wield his invisible blade and kill, the disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace finally had a chance to breathe.</p>

  <p>Some of the disciples floated in the air, while the others stayed on the ground as they all watched Fuxi beat Usman with the countless fist shadows he created. Adrenaline rushed through their veins at the thrilling sight.</p>

  <p>They knew that Fuxi's ferocious attacks could crush even an Eternal Realm master into muddy flesh.</p>

  <p>Yet, Usman remained unharmed. How was that possible?</p>

  <p>The young disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace didn't understand it, but the powerful masters figured out why.</p>

  <p>As soon as Usman had arrived in the Separate Amber Province, his real presence fused with the whole land. Thus, all the damage he suffered went to the ground.</p>

  <p>For instance, every punch Fuxi threw at him created a large hole on the once indestructible boundary wall of the Separate Amber Province.</p>

  <p>That boundary wall surrounded the entire province. Although it was sturdy and extensive, it would collapse anytime soon because of the large holes that continually appeared on it.</p>

  <p>Yet, Usman still couldn't transfer the damage he bore at his own will. After all, he was only an incarnation of resentment in the Source World. Once the boundary wall completely collapsed, he would undoubtedly die.</p>

  <p>That was how the last Usman died in the past.</p>

  <p>Back then, it was a large province twelve times bigger than the current province, but a powerful Other Shore Token had trapped the last Usman in the center of the province. With no way to escape, he had suffered from the attacks of several Eternal Realm masters. In the end, they smashed the last Usman to death after the boundary wall of the entire province was completely destroyed.</p>

  <p>Now, Fuxi tried to kill him with the same method.</p>

  <p>Since Xuanyuan, Divine Farmer, and Mahoney refused to show up, he would beat Usman to death first.</p>

  <p>Unlike the other great masters who preferred to scheme and calculate a lot before they made their move, Fuxi chose to deal with things simply and directly? that was, to fight with his fists.</p>

  <p>And because of his involvement in the war, all the others stopped their battles.</p>

  <p>When Pearce, Auden, and the others saw Fuxi had come to their rescue, all of them lit up with hope.</p>

  <p>Because Luo Zheng couldn't wake up and help them under the current circumstances, the Taiyi Heaven Palace's only back-up was probably Li Shan mountain. Although their seven flying ships were all destroyed and many disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace had died, Fuxi's appearance was timely for them.</p>

  <p>The Holy Soul Realm warriors of the Bearing race looked up at the sky above the boundary wall. They knew that none of them was a match for Fuxi, but they wanted to know their leader's next plan.</p>

  <p>However, Xuanyuan only stood at the top of their flying ship and remained silent.</p>

  <p>The sounds of the collapsing boundary wall lingered in his ears, like Usman's pathetic cries for mercy. They reminded him of the ruthless beating Usman endured.</p>

  <p>"He will soon be killed," Divine Farmer's voice resounded in Xuanyuan's ears. He knew he couldn't just stand by now.</p>

  <p>Xuanyuan squinted his eyes and eventually opened his mouth to plead Fuxi, "Human Sovereign, this person is a member of my clan. Please show mercy on him."</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Fuxi's punch stopped halfway, but its power still exploded and cast the Eight Diagrams' mark on Usman's body.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Usman still didn't suffer any damage from the attack, but another large hole appeared on the boundary wall.</p>

  <p>Several holes connected, then a large part of the boundary wall collapsed to the ground.</p>

  <p>Fuxi looked up at the sky and sneered, "Since the member of your clan dared to kill the disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace at will, why should I show any mercy?"</p>

  <p>"The Taiyi Heaven Palace has offended the Bearing race. As the leader of the race, it's reasonable for me to punish them. On the other hand, I don't think it's justifiable for you to intervene. Human Sovereign, don't you think so?" Xuanyuan replied in a calm voice.</p>

  <p>Although the situation in the Source World had been quite tense recently, the conflicts between the super forces still hadn't escalated into an all-out war.</p>

  <p>At least the Bearing race still hadn't declared war against Li Shan mountain, so Fuxi's intervention somehow lacked a good reason.</p>

  <p>With a disdainful look on his face, Fuxi still retorted, "Xuanyuan, there's no need to waste your breath on bickering at this point! From now on, the Taiyi Heaven Palace and Li Shan mountain are one. I will smash anyone who dare hurt a disciple of the Taiyi Heaven Palace into pieces! Am I clear now?"</p>

  <p>All the disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace were deeply moved upon hearing Fuxi's words.</p>

  <p>The Human Sovereign had always been regarded as the strongest warrior of the human race, and now he was quite determined to protect them.</p>

  <p>"Do you want to declare war on my Bearing race?" At that point, the veins on Xuanyuan's forehead popped, and there was a fiery rage in his eyes.</p>

  <p>As the emperor of the Bearing race, he could no longer stand Fuxi's defiance against him no matter how good-tempered he was.</p>

  <p>Fuxi glanced at him, and chuckled, "You came all the way here not just to enjoy the scenery, did you?"</p>

  <p>In reality, several super forces already knew that the Source World was already on the brink of a full-scale war, and it could probably happen today.</p>

  <p>"You're right. It would be my pleasure to fight you..."</p>

  <p>At that moment, Xuanyuan gently slid his finger across his chest, then his golden silk robe floated away with the wind and revealed a close-fitting black armor inside.</p>

  <p>Fuxi was well-known as the Human Sovereign, and the title was enough to demand the respect he enjoyed from all the humans.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the Bearing race's influence hugely increased over the years because they had allied with other races. Still, Xuanyuan's real strength was a secret to outsiders. There were even rumors that he was mightier than Fuxi.</p>

  <p>Xuanyuan spread out his hand in the air, and a crack appeared in his palm. Blood gushed out from the crack and quickly formed a simple three-foot-long sword.</p>

  <p>It was his lifeblood treasure, the Xuanyuan Sword, which came from his root-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>Even though Xuanyuan and Fuxi belonged to different super forces, they had dealt with each other for countless years.</p>

  <p>Xuanyuan knew what kind of person Fuxi was. He was the type that once he had chosen a path, he never showed mercy to anyone who dared hinder him.</p>

  <p>That was why Xuanyuan would certainly fight him with all his strength.</p>

  <p>"I'll hold Fuxi back. Mahoney, you should go and block the Black Ship.</p>

  <p>Divine Farmer, you're responsible for taking Luo Zheng away," Xuanyuan said through his life vitality.</p>

  <p>Before he set out, he had set other goals, including killing Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Ying.</p>

  <p>But since the three forces confronted each other now, the situation became too complicated.</p>

  <p>As a result, Xuanyuan began to feel uncertain due to pressure from the battle. "What about the Snake Goddess?" Mahoney asked.</p>

  <p>Everyone was afraid of Fuxi's formidable fighting ability, but what they feared more was the wisdom of the Snake Goddess.</p>

  <p>When they realized that the Snake Goddess still hadn't shown herself, all the Eternal Realm warriors further increased their guard.</p>
