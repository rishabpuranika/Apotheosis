<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Buddha Emperor Sword charged straight at Nathaniel's head at lightning speed.</p>

  <p>But he spun his black axe wildly, making it seem as though he was carrying an airtight shield.</p>

  <p>Soon, the invisible Buddha Emperor Sword collided with the black axe.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>With a rather dull sound, the black axe in Nathaniel's hand steadily blocked the attack. His heavy axe was still trembling when Zheng's Buddha Emperor Sword collapsed.</p>

  <p>"You're not even qualified yet," Nathaniel sneered.</p>

  <p>But Zheng remained calm as the pieces of the Buddha Emperor Sword suddenly gathered into form where it collapsed.</p>

  <p>It was only two feet away from Nathaniel and it grew more solid and thicker as it condensed. Then, it slashed at Nathaniel so fast that it was impossible for him to defend himself this time.</p>

  <p>Most impressive was that Zheng could somehow freely shape the illusory sword again.</p>

  <p>Normally, the strength source Zheng used to shape the four swords occupied only a small part of the Nine Divine Stars' power, but Zheng could adjust it as he pleased.</p>

  <p>A few moments earlier, Zheng had seen the great power of the black axe and chose not to fight it head-on. The sword collapsing from Nathaniel's counterattack was by design. As soon as Nathaniel let down his guard, Zheng suddenly released fifty percent of his strength source. The power of the Buddha Emperor Sword immediately intensified when it was shaped once again, making it clear how much greater its speed and strength had gotten.</p>

  <p>Feeling the great power before him, Nathaniel narrowed his eyes slightly as a smile appeared on his face. Then, the Buddha Emperor Sword came slashing at his head.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The invisible Buddha Emperor Sword cut his neck with a dull sound.</p>

  <p>If it were any other True God, their head would have fallen to the ground at that very moment. But a brownish yellow light flashed across the surface of Nathaniel's body and forcefully blocked the Buddha Emperor Sword's slash.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, a crack appeared on the ground beneath his feet.</p>

  <p>Nathaniel used the Earth Godly Way to transfer the slashing power of Zheng's Buddha Emperor Sword to the ground.</p>

  <p>The crack on the ground continued to extend until it spread towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>When it reached the ground right under Zheng's feet, an invisible force suddenly shot out and charged towards him.</p>

  <p>It happened to be exactly the power of the Buddha Emperor Sword.</p>

  <p>After being absorbed by Nathaniel's theurgy, it flowed along the ground and was returned to Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng reacted rapidly and ordered the Grant Sun Sword to set up its defense from under him.</p>

  <p>This Grant Sun Sword mainly served as Zheng's thickest defense. With a crisp sound, it pressed down and blocked the invisible force.</p>

  <p>But Zheng frowned slightly.</p>

  <p>The Earth Godly Way was similar to the power transfer skill he mastered in the universe.</p>

  <p>He had inherited the will of the entire universe and could transfer any sort of attack to any corner of the universe. But it seemed that Nathaniel could transfer the power only to the earth, able to return any attacks through the ground.</p>

  <p>"Joy's illusory sword is indeed worthy of its reputation. Please, go on,"</p>

  <p>Nathaniel said mockingly with a relaxed smile.</p>

  <p>The comment made Zheng snort as he snapped his fingers. The Buddha Emperor Sword, the Heavenly Tooth Sword, and the Long Vine Sword surrounded Nathaniel and took turns attacking.</p>

  <p>Indeed, the attacks Nathaniel received could be transferred back through the ground, but Zheng believed that there must be a limit. So long as the limit was exceeded, the yellow internal momentum protecting him would eventually be dissipated.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The three swords started flying constantly around Nathaniel, just like a pack of wolves surrounding sheep on the grassland. As long as there was a sign of a chance, they'd make a lethal bite at him.</p>

  <p>At the start of the battle, Nathaniel used the black axe to defend himself, but Zheng's illusory swords were very flexible. Even if he destroyed the swords, they would soon take shape again and swing at him ferociously.</p>

  <p>So he decided to give up defending himself directly and instead concentrated on constantly returning the attacks he received.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Cracks were constantly appearing on the ground under Nathaniel's feet from the power of Zheng's attacks— Nathaniel merely threw them all back at Zheng.</p>

  <p>While moving around Nathaniel and avoiding the cracks, Zheng continued controlling the three long swords, slashing at Nathaniel constantly. The battle between the two fell into a deadlock.</p>

  <p>But Nathaniel clearly had it easier— he only needed to stand still and keep returning Zheng's power back to him. He was rather curious to see how long Zheng could hold on.</p>

  <p>Still, Zheng seemed just as unhurried.</p>

  <p>Since his identity had been exposed, he no longer had to hide any other skill, save for the Emotion Closing Godly Way.</p>

  <p>Zheng had also recorded the Earth Godly Way on the Infinity Ruler. But ordinary theurgy of Earth Godly Way could only borrow the earth's power. Nathaniel's skill of transferring attacks must have been a theurgy beyond way that was created by the Dongfang Clan.</p>

  <p>Because Zheng had mastered the power transfer skill himself, he knew that it was indeed powerful. Taking advantage of this opportunity, Zheng's eyes flashed quietly with two small golden rings. He began analyzing the internal momentum scattered on the surface of Nathaniel's body.</p>

  <p>"This theurgy is indeed ingenious!"</p>

  <p>Soon, Zheng understood the principles of this theurgy beyond way.</p>

  <p>"However, it is still incomparable to the power transfer skill of the universe. Nathaniel can transfer the attacks to the ground within a 1000-foot radius. I only just learned this skill from him so I can transfer to the range of twenty to thirty feet."</p>

  <p>After Zheng gained a full understanding of the theurgy beyond way, the cracks on the ground around Nathaniel grew abundant.</p>

  <p>The ground under his feet seemed to have been plowed through, becoming softer and softer. It had all been turned into a plot of broken land.</p>

  <p>"It's my turn now!"</p>

  <p>With a slight smile, Zheng waved his hand. The Long Vine Sword and the Heavenly Tooth Sword immediately plunged into the soil.</p>

  <p>Noticing Zheng's grin, Nathaniel was rather stunned, wondering what his next move would be.</p>

  <p>In an instant, a circular crack suddenly appeared within a one-foot range around Nathaniel. He felt a tremor under his feet as the entire piece of the ground beneath him rose abruptly into the sky.</p>

  <p>"Your theurgy is indeed powerful. So long as you are connected to the ground, you're practically invincible. But under the effect of the Blood Breaking Bite, you can't move freely. Once I cut off the connection between you and the ground, things will get even more interesting!"</p>

  <p>With his hand raised high, Zheng explained calmly.</p>

  <p>Under the piece of ground Nathaniel was currently standing on, the Long Vine Sword created countless vines, lifting the whole piece of earth into the air. At the same time, some vines crossed the ground and firmly wrapped around Nathaniel's legs. With that, Nathaniel was sent flying into the sky.</p>

  <p>And since he moved vertically, the wound on his neck from the Blood Breaking Bite began bleeding.</p>

  <p>After finishing his words, Zheng gently waved his right hand.</p>

  <p>The Long Vine Sword carried Nathaniel up rapidly, making him hover in the sky above the valley.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, his blood spurted from the wound, falling like heavy rain.</p>
