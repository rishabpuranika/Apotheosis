<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Godly Ways Great Unity was the power source of the whole chaos.</p>

  <p>Everything in the chaos was formed by the Ways-blending Energy.</p>

  <p>When the chaos was created, the Ways-blending Energy was divided into 3, 000 kinds of power, which were known as the 3, 000 Godly Ways.</p>

  <p>A lot of powerhouses had mastered the 3, 000 Godly Ways, but up until now, no one had been able to fuse them all to form the Godly Ways Great Unity.</p>

  <p>Even so, Zheng did not give up the Ways-blending Energy. However, in recent years, he had spent most of his time on the Other Shore and was too busy to attempt to fuse the Godly Ways.</p>

  <p>"This nonsense again? The 3, 000 Godly Ways have never been fused perfectly. I don't think they'll ever be fused!" No. 9527 told Zheng firmly.</p>

  <p>Zheng questioned the Regal Jade Spirit, "As far as I know, many people in the Source World practice the 3, 000 Godly Ways, but no one has succeeded in merging them into one. Even the Chaos Ancient Gods who had observed the Godly Ways Great Unity and mastered the truths couldn't do it."</p>

  <p>"The Chaos Ancient Gods who had mastered the truths? Do you mean the Sons of Truth?" The Regal Jade Spirit smiled faintly. "The Sons of Truth were just some housekeepers after the chaos was created. The truths that they had mastered were defective."</p>

  <p>"The truths were defective? How is that possible?" Surprise was written all over Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>"No way! Nonsense! The truths are the most powerful forces in the chaos.</p>

  <p>How can there be flaws? Impossible!" No. 9527 shouted defensively from within Zheng, unconvinced.</p>

  <p>The reason why the Chaos Ancient Gods were supreme in the chaos was that they each mastered an insurmountable truth that was above all the power. However, the Regal Jade Spirit actually said that the truths were defective. Naturally, it was difficult for No. 9527 to accept.</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade Spirit sneered, "I was a Son of Truth before; I had also mastered a truth. How could I speak nonsense?"</p>

  <p>"You had mastered a truth before?" Zheng's eyes widened in shock.</p>

  <p>"Yes, in the era when the 750th civilization, also known as the Grand Sky race, ruled the chaos, I was a Son of Truth, or what you call a Chaos Ancient God," the Regal Jade Spirit said calmly, as though this was no big deal.</p>

  <p>Once the Godly Ways Great Unity created the chaos, its energy had been completely depleted. Creatures born after the chaos was created would never have the chance to observe the Godly Ways Great Unity and thus could not become Chaos Ancient Gods.</p>

  <p>No. 9527's master was a creature of the last chaos.</p>

  <p>All of the Grand Nature Treasures were passed down from the last chaos.</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade Spirit was born in the 749th chaos. After the 749th chaos was destroyed, all the energy was consolidated and fused into the Godly Ways Great Unity again. Then, the Regal Jade Spirit had a chance to study the Godly Ways Great Unity, enough to master a truth from it. Thus, it was able to become a Chaos Ancient God in the following chaos.</p>

  <p>The Grand Sky race was also a ruling civilization. Zheng had heard of it from the Ear Mice before, but he never would've thought that the Regal Jade Spirit was a Chaos Ancient God of this civilization.</p>

  <p>Zheng reflected on this for a moment. What did the Regal Jade Spirit mean when it said the Son of Truth was nothing but a housekeeper of the chaos?</p>

  <p>"But why are truths defective?" Zheng finally muttered. Although the Regal Jade Spirit was an actual legend, he still felt what it said was unbelievable.</p>

  <p>"The energy of the Godly Ways Great Unity they observed had defects; consequently, the truths they mastered were also defected," the Regal Jade Spirit explained. "Only the first ruling civilization had observed the perfect Godly Ways Great Unity. All the following Godly Ways Great Unity had flaws."</p>

  <p>It started to make sense, yet Zheng still found himself shaking his head.</p>

  <p>"What kind of civilization is the first ruling civilization?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Chaos had been created and destroyed alternately, but it all started with the first ruling civilization. Naturally, Zheng was curious about it.</p>

  <p>"It is also known as the Instant Civilization," the Regal Jade Spirit answered.</p>

  <p>"The Instant Civilization?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. It only lasted for an instant. Then the whole chaos was destroyed," the Regal Jade Spirit explained.</p>

  <p>A civilization, from its inception to its peak, would have to last countless years. However, this Instant Civilization had only existed for an instant. Zheng rubbed his temples in utter confusion.</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade Spirit, observing Zheng's reaction, continued to explain, "An instant passes in the blink of an eye for you and me. But for the Instant Civilization, it is eternal. Their concept of time is different from ours.</p>

  <p>Nearly half of the Sanskrit words were created by the Instant Civilization.</p>

  <p>You should have seen Sanskrit words as you entered the Other Shore by the Truth of Godly Way."</p>

  <p>"The Sanskrit words were created by the Instant Civilization?"</p>

  <p>Zheng repeated numbly. He had long known that Sanskrit words were spread from the Other Shore, but he didn't know who had created them, not until now.</p>

  <p>He never thought the Sanskrit words would date back to the earliest stages of the chaos.</p>

  <p>As Zheng and the Regal Jade Spirit continued talking, the pictures continued to slide. The Regal Jade Civilization had been split into two divisions, and there was an extremely fierce battle.</p>

  <p>The majestic Wing King appeared in the battle, his wings fluttering with luminous colors.</p>

  <p>Zheng was familiar with this colorful luster. It was exactly the Ways-blending Energy. However, it was much fuller and stronger, and it seemed to emit an indescribable energy. Although the energy was tiny, he could tell it played an important role.</p>

  <p>Although he was just being presented with an illusion, Zheng could still feel its massive power.</p>

  <p>"So this is the perfect Ways-blending Energy? Is this the Godly Ways Great Unity?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>He thought he knew the answer, but to his surprise, the Regal Jade Spirit continued, "We once thought that the Wing King had grasped the perfect Ways-blending Energy, but after the Regal Jade Civilization was destroyed, we realized that it was not perfect."</p>

  <p>If the Wing King had grasped the perfect Ways-blending Energy, the 749th chaos ruled by the Regal Jade Civilization would've lived on. It would not be punctured by that needle, and the Finale Way would have been realized.</p>

  <p>"It was still not perfect?" Zheng exclaimed, at a total loss.</p>

  <p>"No. The Wing King made up for one flaw of the Ways-blending Energy.</p>

  <p>But there are still two flaws in it," the Regal Jade Spirit said. "So, we have been waiting for the right person to make up for the two flaws."</p>

  <p>"And who is the right person?" Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"The one who has our Civilization Artifact," the Regal Jade Spirit answered bluntly.</p>

  <p>Zheng glanced at Feng Ge, who stood next to him. Her big eyes were bright and full of curiosity as she eagerly watched the colorful pictures that constantly changed in front of her.</p>

  <p>"You mean Feng Ge?" Zheng raised an eyebrow.</p>

  <p>"She..." the Regal Jade Spirit trailed off in hesitation. Then it said, "She can't do it."</p>
