  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Divine Dao Great Unity was the power source of the whole chaos.</p>

  <p>Everything in the chaos was formed by the Ways-blending Energy.</p>

  <p>When the chaos was created, the Ways-blending Energy was divided into 3, 000 kinds of power, which were known as the 3, 000 Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>A lot of powerhouses had mastered the 3, 000 Divine Dao, but up until now, no one had been able to fuse them all to form the Divine Dao Great Unity.</p>

  <p>Even so, Luo Zheng did not give up the Ways-blending Energy. However, in recent years, he had spent most of his time on the Other Shore and was too busy to attempt to fuse the Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>"This nonsense again? The 3, 000 Divine Dao have never been fused perfectly. I don't think they'll ever be fused!" No. 9527 told Luo Zheng firmly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng questioned the Green Jade Spirit, "As far as I know, many people in the Source World practice the 3, 000 Divine Dao, but no one has succeeded in merging them into one. Even the Chaos Ancient Gods who had observed the Divine Dao Great Unity and mastered the truths couldn't do it."</p>

  <p>"The Chaos Ancient Gods who had mastered the truths? Do you mean the Sons of Truth?" The Green Jade Spirit smiled faintly. "The Sons of Truth were just some housekeepers after the chaos was created. The truths that they had mastered were defective."</p>

  <p>"The truths were defective? How is that possible?" Surprise was written all over Luo Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>"No way! Nonsense! The truths are the most powerful forces in the chaos.</p>

  <p>How can there be flaws? Impossible!" No. 9527 shouted defensively from within Luo Zheng, unconvinced.</p>

  <p>The reason why the Chaos Ancient Gods were supreme in the chaos was that they each mastered an insurmountable truth that was above all the power. However, the Green Jade Spirit actually said that the truths were defective. Naturally, it was difficult for No. 9527 to accept.</p>

  <p>The Green Jade Spirit sneered, "I was a Son of Truth before; I had also mastered a truth. How could I speak nonsense?"</p>

  <p>"You had mastered a truth before?" Luo Zheng's eyes widened in shock.</p>

  <p>"Yes, in the era when the 750th civilization, also known as the Grand Sky race, ruled the chaos, I was a Son of Truth, or what you call a Chaos Ancient God," the Green Jade Spirit said calmly, as though this was no big deal.</p>

  <p>Once the Divine Dao Great Unity created the chaos, its energy had been completely depleted. Creatures born after the chaos was created would never have the chance to observe the Divine Dao Great Unity and thus could not become Chaos Ancient Gods.</p>

  <p>No. 9527's master was a creature of the last chaos.</p>

  <p>All of the Grand Nature Treasures were passed down from the last chaos.</p>

  <p>The Green Jade Spirit was born in the 749th chaos. After the 749th chaos was destroyed, all the energy was consolidated and fused into the Divine Dao Great Unity again. Then, the Green Jade Spirit had a chance to study the Divine Dao Great Unity, enough to master a truth from it. Thus, it was able to become a Chaos Ancient God in the following chaos.</p>

  <p>The Grand Sky race was also a ruling civilization. Luo Zheng had heard of it from the Ear Mice before, but he never would've thought that the Green Jade Spirit was a Chaos Ancient God of this civilization.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng reflected on this for a moment. What did the Green Jade Spirit mean when it said the Son of Truth was nothing but a housekeeper of the chaos?</p>

  <p>"But why are truths defective?" Luo Zheng finally muttered. Although the Green Jade Spirit was an actual legend, he still felt what it said was unbelievable.</p>

  <p>"The energy of the Divine Dao Great Unity they observed had defects; consequently, the truths they mastered were also defected," the Green Jade Spirit explained. "Only the first ruling civilization had observed the perfect Divine Dao Great Unity. All the following Divine Dao Great Unity had flaws."</p>

  <p>It started to make sense, yet Luo Zheng still found himself shaking his head.</p>

  <p>"What kind of civilization is the first ruling civilization?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Chaos had been created and destroyed alternately, but it all started with the first ruling civilization. Naturally, Luo Zheng was curious about it.</p>

  <p>"It is also known as the Instant Civilization," the Green Jade Spirit answered.</p>

  <p>"The Instant Civilization?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. It only lasted for an instant. Then the whole chaos was destroyed," the Green Jade Spirit explained.</p>

  <p>A civilization, from its inception to its peak, would have to last countless years. However, this Instant Civilization had only existed for an instant. Luo Zheng rubbed his temples in utter confusion.</p>

  <p>The Green Jade Spirit, observing Luo Zheng's reaction, continued to explain, "An instant passes in the blink of an eye for you and me. But for the Instant Civilization, it is eternal. Their concept of time is different from ours.</p>

  <p>Nearly half of the Sanskrit words were created by the Instant Civilization.</p>

  <p>You should have seen Sanskrit words as you entered the Other Shore by the Truth of Divine Dao."</p>

  <p>"The Sanskrit words were created by the Instant Civilization?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng repeated numbly. He had long known that Sanskrit words were spread from the Other Shore, but he didn't know who had created them, not until now.</p>

  <p>He never thought the Sanskrit words would date back to the earliest stages of the chaos.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng and the Green Jade Spirit continued talking, the pictures continued to slide. The Green Jade Civilization had been split into two divisions, and there was an extremely fierce battle.</p>

  <p>The majestic Wing King appeared in the battle, his wings fluttering with luminous colors.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was familiar with this colorful luster. It was exactly the Ways-blending Energy. However, it was much fuller and stronger, and it seemed to emit an indescribable energy. Although the energy was tiny, he could tell it played an important role.</p>

  <p>Although he was just being presented with an illusion, Luo Zheng could still feel its massive power.</p>

  <p>"So this is the perfect Ways-blending Energy? Is this the Divine Dao Great Unity?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>He thought he knew the answer, but to his surprise, the Green Jade Spirit continued, "We once thought that the Wing King had grasped the perfect Ways-blending Energy, but after the Green Jade Civilization was destroyed, we realized that it was not perfect."</p>

  <p>If the Wing King had grasped the perfect Ways-blending Energy, the 749th chaos ruled by the Green Jade Civilization would've lived on. It would not be punctured by that needle, and the Finale Way would have been realized.</p>

  <p>"It was still not perfect?" Luo Zheng exclaimed, at a total loss.</p>

  <p>"No. The Wing King made up for one flaw of the Ways-blending Energy.</p>

  <p>But there are still two flaws in it," the Green Jade Spirit said. "So, we have been waiting for the right person to make up for the two flaws."</p>

  <p>"And who is the right person?" Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"The one who has our Civilization Artifact," the Green Jade Spirit answered bluntly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng glanced at Feng Ge, who stood next to him. Her big eyes were bright and full of curiosity as she eagerly watched the colorful pictures that constantly changed in front of her.</p>

  <p>"You mean Feng Ge?" Luo Zheng raised an eyebrow.</p>

  <p>"She..." the Green Jade Spirit trailed off in hesitation. Then it said, "She can't do it."</p>
