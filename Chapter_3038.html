<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Disappointed, Dorothy walked back to the square. She glared at Daisy and said, "Aunt Daisy! Zheng is the person that even grandma cares about!"</p>

  <p>She had been expectant to meet Zheng but now that he had left, she had become pretty annoyed.</p>

  <p>But she was also puzzled. Daisy was behaving very strangely today, very unlike herself.</p>

  <p>Daisy's aggressive expression morphed into a gentle smile. She sighed and said, "Of course I know it. He is, after all, someone who could enter the Sea of Truth with his physical body. If we were to really keep him, we would agree even if he brought a thousand people with him, not to mention that he only brought a hundred...The Origin Mountain is so huge, and it could easily hold them."</p>

  <p>Felicity and Evaristus looked curiously at each other, while Dorothy frowned. "So why did you let him go?"</p>

  <p>"The Oneness Mountain already knew all about it when Winchell brought Zheng back," Daisy said, smiling helplessly.</p>

  <p>"So what? Could the Oneness Mountain even interfere with Zheng's choice?</p>

  <p>Will grandma allow it to happen?" Dorothy asked, displeased with how things had been going.</p>

  <p>The Oneness Sky Palace claimed to be a unified force to the outside world.</p>

  <p>But from within, there were a thousand complications tangled with each other.</p>

  <p>The Oneness Sky Palace had occupied the Oneness Mountain. Its branches occupied the Origin Mountain, Bright Mountain, and the Azure Mountain, etc.</p>

  <p>These huge mountains could dominate a region if they were placed anywhere in the Source World.</p>

  <p>There was no doubt that the palace in the Oneness Mountain was the main force. But Dorothy had known Zheng for quite a time, and this time, the people from the Origin Mountain had saved him. So it was taken for granted that he would join the Origin Mountain.</p>

  <p>The Oneness Sky Palace did have the ability to force Zheng to join them, but doing that didn't make any sense.</p>

  <p>To Dorothy, her grandma was an aggressive figure and wouldn't ever make a concession in a matter as serious as this.</p>

  <p>Daisy shook her head and said, "Zheng joined the Sword Light Palace after he entered the Source World. His talent was spotted when he cultivated Athemar's Lofty Sword. The boy could actually attain Instant Enlightenment. The Oneness Sky Palace has sent out a few guiders before us, but they were killed ..."</p>

  <p>At this, Dorothy, Felicity, and Evaristus realized what happened. No wonder the Oneness Sky Palace was refusing to give up on Zheng, and no wonder grandma was willing to make a concession.</p>

  <p>"But Zheng was brought here by us!" Dorothy complained angrily.</p>

  <p>Daisy smiled. "Never mind. It's also good for Zheng to join the Oneness Sky Palace. It has a better foundation than us, and maybe he can learn more there. You have to keep an eye on him in the Sea of Truth. We are still counting on him to save Evaristus!"</p>

  <p>"Okay," Dorothy replied sullenly.</p>

  <p>It was difficult for Dorothy to get involved in the disputes of the elders, but at least Zheng had joined the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>At the foot of Origin Mountain, the disciples of the Sword Light Palace were still fuming, simmering with indignation.</p>

  <p>"The Origin Mountain is not the Oneness Sky Palace anyway. They were full of themselves," Jago said discontentedly.</p>

  <p>Beldene thought for a moment, and then said, "I find all this a little strange.</p>

  <p>We have just arrived at the Origin Mountain, but they suddenly changed their attitude. It didn't make any sense."</p>

  <p>Zheng, who was walking at the front of the group, nodded in agreement and said, "I think so too."</p>

  <p>He was not a total stranger to them. It was illogical for the lady to act like that.</p>

  <p>"We've come all the way here, but now we don't know where to go," sighed Kenelm. "If we had known this earlier, we would have stayed in the Sword Light Palace."</p>

  <p>The Oneness Sky Palace was unattainable to these disciples of the Sword Light Palace. It was difficult for even people like Elgin and Beldene to enter the Oneness Sky Palace. Kenelm and his friends were far behind in the equation. If the Oneness Sky Palace didn't make an exception for them, they wouldn't be qualified to join such a force.</p>

  <p>At Kenelm's words, the other disciples felt frustration rising.</p>

  <p>"We might as well go back to the Seven-Star Province."</p>

  <p>"It's such a long way back though. It's not easy."</p>

  <p>It wasn't easy to cross a large province even for warriors at the Other Shore Realm. With their cultivation level, it would be difficult for them to return to their hometown.</p>

  <p>At their long faces, Zheng smiled and said, "Don't be upset. We can find a solution. Let's look around before making a decision."</p>

  <p>No matter how bad the situation was, they were currently in an area that belonged to the territory of the humans. At the very least, they didn't have to worry about losing their lives.</p>

  <p>The huge mountains were like canopies of the heavens that covered the heads of the crowd. They were all extremely tall and awe inspiring. They walked for about three hundred miles along the road between the mountains before a huge wall loomed ahead of them.</p>

  <p>The wall was a metallic grayish brown.</p>

  <p>What was most strange about it was that the huge wall was covered with swords.</p>

  <p>There were all kinds of swords of different sizes and shapes: long, bent, thin, and wide. There were broken swords, and there were also swords embedded with gems. Some of them looked precious. But they were all firmly stuck on the wall.</p>

  <p>A lot of people were gathered under the wall.</p>

  <p>Most of them were consummate True Gods. They each occupied their own territories and sat down cross-legged, as if they were waiting for something.</p>

  <p>"What wall is this?" Kenelm asked.</p>

  <p>Some disciples of the Sword Light Place had no idea what was happening.</p>

  <p>"I've heard of it before," Beldene said excitedly. "It's the famous Sword Wall!"</p>

  <p>"What's that?"</p>

  <p>"Why are there so many swords hanging on it?" a disciple asked.</p>

  <p>Beldene looked up at the Sword Wall and said, "The Oneness Sky Palace is located in the Bloom Divine Province. It is a traditional great human force, so there are tens of thousands of people coming to worship every day. But it's impossible for the Oneness Sky Palace to carry out tests every day, which is why they put a wall here. Crossing the Sword Wall is the first step to joining the Oneness Sky Palace."</p>

  <p>Zheng gazed at the wall and asked, "It isn't easy crossing the wall, right?"</p>

  <p>"That completely depends," Beldene said seriously. "If you're highly compatible with the swordsmanship, it will be easy for you to succeed. If not, you might not be able to cross the wall in your whole lifetime."</p>

  <p>Compatible?</p>

  <p>At this, he remembered that Dorothy had mentioned this before. It turned out that the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace used this wall to test their compatibility degree.</p>

  <p>But going by what Dorothy had said, if one could achieve Instant Enlightenment, they would be one hundred percent compatible. Seen that way, he had a high level of compatibility with the swordsmanship. So he assumed it wouldn't be a problem to pass through this wall. But it might not be that easy for the others.</p>

  <p>"Get off! This is our place. Go back, you losers!" a loud voice scolded.</p>

  <p>Zheng turned in time to see more than twenty angry young men coming their way. The young man in black in the front carried two swords that crossed at his back, his eyes glinting coldly. He was shouting at the disciples of the Sword Light Palace.</p>

  <p>"Your place? Have you engraved your name on your turf?" At these words, Elgin's face darkened.</p>

  <p>He had never been humiliated like this in the Sword Light Palace.</p>

  <p>Beldene, Kenelm, and some others could tolerate this. But Elgin, Faegan, and Jago raised their eyebrows at the young man's words.</p>
