<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The two Sacred world lords emitted really strange auras. Their bodies looked old and withered but they were brimming with life.</p>

  <p>"Cultivators from remote ages?"</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng was in a hurry to pass through the True Path, he knew rushing would only screw things up.</p>

  <p>"They were the first ones to understand the Godly Way," said Saul.</p>

  <p>In the early days of the divine land, a number of low-rank races existed alongside the famous Holy Beings from ancient times.</p>

  <p>One of them was the Sacred race.</p>

  <p>Back then, they were far stronger than the other races.</p>

  <p>They were the ones who established the three thousand Divine Dao in the divine land.</p>

  <p>When the Creating Axe created the divine land, it created the 3, 000 Divine Dao, which were formed in tablets and scattered throughout the divine land.</p>

  <p>Aside from a very small number of Divine Dao that were passed down by Holy Beings from ancient times, most of the three thousand were comprehended by the Sacred race, and were only spread through the divine land after.</p>

  <p>Some of these were the Five Elements Godly Way, Truth Godly Way, and Star Godly Way.</p>

  <p>Gaining insights was easier for the later generations, but it had cost the forerunners an extreme amount of effort.</p>

  <p>The tablets in the divine land were no ordinary Law Tablets, as Luo Luo Zheng had found in the Cloud Hall, the Genuine Dragon World, and the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>Usually, when a warrior wished to understand a Law Tablet, they only needed to make sense of the law written on it to be able to control the Law Power that lay within. The entire process did not entail any risks.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, understanding Godly Way Tablets required one to undergo testing. Those who dared take the test would have their bodies worn down, their souls destroyed, and their inner worlds in chaos.</p>

  <p>That was why every cultivator from the remote ages was a pioneer of the divine land. They had a much deeper understanding of the Divine Dao than the Godly Geniuses.</p>

  <p>Although these two Sacred warriors were only world lords, they had comprehended the Godly Way, and so could be considered Godly Geniuses. And they were more powerful than the Godly Geniuses Luo Luo Zheng had encountered before.</p>

  <p>"Master," Saul called worriedly. More of Luo Zheng's wounds had reopened causing golden blood to seep through his clothes. "Perhaps you're putting too much pressure on yourself."</p>

  <p>Before his body had been tempered by Holy Drew, Luo Zheng's ability to heal had been terrifying. However, now that his body had become stronger and tougher than ever, his ability to heal had significantly slowed.</p>

  <p>Naturally, Saul wanted Luo Luo Zheng to fall back and rest for a while before attempting to get through the True Path.</p>

  <p>Under normal circumstances, the two cultivators from the remote ages wouldn't be difficult to kill with Luo Zheng's current strength. However, Luo Luo Zheng wasn't in optimal condition and it would be too risky for him to try.</p>

  <p>"I'm not!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng growled, a look of determination appearing on his face.</p>

  <p>The Evolutionary Universe was in danger, which meant that his father was in danger. There was no time for breaks.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng floated off the ground as he raised the Great Weighty Sword above his head and chopped down at one of the cultivators.</p>

  <p>"Gods-intimidating Strike!"</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng had taken in the essence of the Beginning Swordsmanship, each of his strikes had gotten a heavier weight.</p>

  <p>For instance, this chop would normally be very easy to dodge. A step backward, left, or right would allow the opponent to evade the attack, but since Luo Luo Zheng made this move, it made it hard for one to determine the direction of the strike.</p>

  <p>No matter in what direction his opponent went, he wouldn't be able to dodge. The cultivator from the remote ages realized this just in time, and so, with a relaxed smile, he extended a withered hand and pinched his thumb and middle finger to form a strange gesture.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng had sensed its strangeness, he had no way of holding back his attack. Affected by the Emotion Closing Godly Way, he swung his sword without hesitation.</p>

  <p>The Great Weighty Sword made a fan-shaped beam in the air and slashed down in a lethal strike.</p>

  <p>The beam's edge was less than an inch away from the old cultivator when the old man snapped his fingers.</p>

  <p>"Huh?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was stunned, a strange feeling permeating through his body.</p>

  <p>Everything was retreating...</p>

  <p>The Great Weighty Sword, his body... Even his thoughts were retreating...</p>

  <p>Phew!</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, Luo Luo Zheng was back to his original spot, the Great Weighty Sword clenched in his right hand just as he had six seconds ago.</p>

  <p>"How...?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng couldn't wrap his head around what just happened.</p>

  <p>Although he was back in his original place, his memory of what transpired still existed. It was just that the order was a little fuzzy.</p>

  <p>He seemed to have gone back in time...</p>

  <p>"This person comprehended the Timing Godly Way. He's the most troublesome fellow," Saul sighed sadly. Bromley had already mastered the Dark and Light energies to the extreme, and the life forms created with those two energies were almost exactly the same as when they were alive. Hence, the difficulty of breaking through the True Path almost made it impossible.</p>

  <p>In the universe, the Space Law and Time Law were two heaven-defying laws that could be cultivated to the 10th level. The higher the level of the Space Law, the further one could go by using the Grand Teleportation.</p>

  <p>However, the Grand Teleportation was one of the most important techniques for warriors, so everyone trained in it.</p>

  <p>The same went with the Time Law. All world lords and Supreme Lords trained in it, but unlike the Space Law, they rarely used it in ordinary matches. The reason for this was that activating the Time Law allowed one's opponent to activate it in the same way, and there wouldn't be much difference in the Time Laws between a Supreme Lord and a world lord. Even if one had cultivated to the top and was able to compress a portion of the time, their opponent would still be able to find a way out of it.</p>

  <p>This was because Holy Beings had strict control over time and space.</p>

  <p>Almost no Holy Being would pass down the best understanding of these two laws as Heavenly Destiny. Mike was no exception. These two laws were just too powerful.</p>

  <p>But in the divine land, there were no restrictions to the Time Law.</p>

  <p>The cultivator from the remote ages grinned at the sight of Luo Luo Zheng, who was dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>Perhaps it was because the Evolutionary Universe had been invaded by these pseudo-Sacred warriors that Luo Luo Zheng felt the urge to annihilate Sacred warriors whenever he saw them.</p>

  <p>Phew!</p>

  <p>As his body shot forward, a sharp gust of wind blew. His sword moved fluidly, and Luo Luo Zheng used his momentum to hack at the old cultivator.</p>

  <p>"Gods-intimidating Strike!"</p>

  <p>This time, Luo Luo Zheng released the sword light ahead of time.</p>

  <p>As the fan-shaped energy spread out, it formed a crescent moon about a thousand feet long, which rapidly swept across the area.</p>

  <p>This guy could force Luo Luo Zheng back into the past. Could it be that he could also force his strike back into the past?</p>

  <p>If that was the case, then there was no need to get through the True Path.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng could just go home.</p>

  <p>As expected, the cultivator did not use the Timing Godly Way again.</p>

  <p>Instead, he leapt up and dodged Luo Zheng's attack. While airborne, he lightly tapped on air and pounced on Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Want to fight face to face?" Luo Zheng's face almost broke into a smile, but just as he was about to accept the invitation, the cultivator dove below Luo Luo Zheng, intentionally missing him.</p>

  <p>At the same time, a crisp sound was heard. Luo Luo Zheng, for the second time, returned to the past and went to where he was six seconds ago. The cultivator from the remote ages had already anticipated where Luo Luo Zheng would be, and his fists landed on Luo Zheng's face before Luo Luo Zheng had realized it.</p>

  <p>Thanks to the two massive forces, Luo Luo Zheng was instantly sent flying dozens of feet away?</p>

  <p>Fortunately, his physical body was not what it used to be.</p>

  <p>Because of the Redemption Armor he wore, even a Supreme Lord would find it difficult to harm him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng rolled off the ground and brushed off the dirt on his clothes. He was unharmed, but he was getting frustrated by the minute. He needed to find a way around this fellow's troublesome ability.</p>
