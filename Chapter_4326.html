<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The black ship slowed down to a stop next to the fairy palace. The Evil God and Zheng exchanged a quick glance, their eyes roaming vigilantly.</p>

  <p>Despite being cornered, neither of them intended to give up.</p>

  <p>"Humph!" the Evil God snorted. Jumping up from the bow, he landed to the side of the gray soil.</p>

  <p>His line of thinking was similar to Geoffrey's. If he couldn't stop the downgrading, the best thing he could do was break past the barrier of the world and escape.</p>

  <p>Zheng calmly watched the Evil God from the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>He was keenly aware that the gray soil was indestructible. Since the Evil God wanted to make a move first, he figured there would be no harm in trying.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Raising his fist in the air, the Evil God threw a mighty punch at the surface of the gray soil.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>A dull sound rang out upon the punch's impact. When the dust cleared, they found a fist-shaped mark was made on the soft gray soil. It seemed that all of the energy contained within the punch had been completely absorbed by the gray soil.</p>

  <p>The Evil God couldn't hide his surprise. Confusedly, he eyed the small fist mark. How could such ordinary soil contain that much power?</p>

  <p>He took a step back.</p>

  <p>The surface of his body began to glow as he channeled all the energy in the void to pour into his body. In a matter of seconds, he looked like a human-shaped body of energy.</p>

  <p>Erring on the side of caution, Zheng distanced the fairy palace away from the Evil God. He wanted to avoid falling into the line of fire.</p>

  <p>At the moment, the Evil God had no intention of attacking Zheng.</p>

  <p>After absorbing a considerable amount of energy, he launched himself into the gray soil, colliding into it violently.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The sound of the collision was much louder than the previous one, echoing throughout the space.</p>

  <p>Under the impact of such a powerful blow, the gray soil once again caved in, but when the Evil God recovered, he found that only a shallow indentation was made on the gray soil.</p>

  <p>As Zheng watched, his eyes narrowed slightly. "The gray soil... Did it absorb all that energy?"</p>

  <p>The rule of infinite energy was that whenever energy in the void was used, it would simply return back to the void. However, this gray soil had actually absorbed all the energy, which meant that a portion of energy in the world was lost!</p>

  <p>The expression on the Evil God's face was the same as that on Zheng's. He too was aware of the rule of infinite energy.</p>

  <p>And yet, the gray soil was breaking that very rule.</p>

  <p>"It's not what you think." Clarence's voice suddenly echoed in Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>"The gray soil can indeed absorb energy, but after a while, it will spit it out again."</p>

  <p>"Is there no limit to the energy that can be absorbed by the gray soil?" Zheng asked incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Remember I said that there was a time I used up ninety-nine percent of the energy to launch an attack in the eighth-grade world? I was attacking the gray soil," Clarence started to say.</p>

  <p>"What happened then?" Zheng asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>Although he could also manipulate energy infinitely now, ninety nine percent of the energy in the whole world was still very terrifying.</p>

  <p>"A huge pit with a depth of more than ten miles was created. However, I didn't see the upper limit of the gray soil. Later, as the gray soil slowly repaired itself, the energy was gradually returned," Clarence answered calmly.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eye twitched.</p>

  <p>He couldn't believe what he'd just heard. The shockingly huge impact of ninety-nine percent of energy only caused a ten-mile-deep crater. What exactly was this gray soil in front of him?</p>

  <p>After the second attempt failed, the Evil God flared his nostrils, still unwilling to give up. Urging the black ship to move backwards, he also called out to Zheng, "Retreat a little!"</p>

  <p>He was planning to absorb more energy to launch yet another attack, but he didn't want Zheng to misconstrue his actions.</p>

  <p>This time, however, Zheng finally cut in. "It's useless," he said.</p>

  <p>"You mean the soil can't be broken?" The Evil God frowned.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded. "Clarence once used ninety nine percent of the world's energy and caused a pit that ran for around ten miles, but even he couldn't break it."</p>

  <p>The Evil God didn't reply.</p>

  <p>Instead, he clenched his fists in deep frustration, causing the surrounding space to fluctuate.</p>

  <p>He had seen a lot of battles and hardships in his life, yet in the face of this seemingly unremarkable soil, he could do nothing!</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Distressed, the Evil God slammed his fist into the gray soil once again.</p>

  <p>Falling onto his knees, the Evil God succumbed to despair. Then, Edna quietly approached him from behind and wrapped her arms around him.</p>

  <p>"Stop trying," she said softly. "Go back to the ship and accompany me in our last moments."</p>

  <p>The Evil God's eyes widened. "We are about to die! Aren't you afraid of death?"</p>

  <p>"No." Edna smiled at her husband calmly. "It's not a sad thing to die by your side."</p>

  <p>Upon hearing this, the Evil God was moved. Instantly, all feelings of despair and regret vanished from his heart.</p>

  <p>While he still didn't want to resign himself to his fate, he decided it was time to compromise. He took Edna's delicate hand in his, and they both headed back to the ship.</p>

  <p>There, they found the Grandmaster of Heaven, Shera, and the former captain blankly staring at the soil, quietly resigned to their fates.</p>

  <p>Even the people in the fairy palace began to bid each other goodbye. They all knew they were about to die, but in the face of death, they remained calm. However, despite being calm, they couldn't avoid the overwhelming feelings of sadness and regret sweeping over them.</p>

  <p>Zheng's avatars said goodbye to Yudie, Margaret, Xun, Aura, and the other women. Zheng had informed them of the possible consequences before, so even Margaret held her head high when their fears were confirmed.</p>

  <p>For the next few moments, a hush fell over the fairy palace and the black ship as they quietly awaited their doom.</p>

  <p>In the distance, the blue arc rapidly expanded. Everything along the way, whether it was a huge monster or a speck of dust, whether it was flowing energy or solidified material, was quickly absorbed by the Wall World.</p>

  <p>Zheng counted backwards silently, 'Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.'</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the fairy palace and the black ship were crushed into countless pieces.</p>

  <p>Because Zheng and the Evil God were a lot more powerful, they lasted a little longer in the midst of the downgrading force. However, eventually, they too succumbed to it and were pressed into the Wall World.</p>

  <p>"Hahaha...</p>

  <p>The Stellar World, the Grand Lower World, and the Lower Extreme World have all been downgraded!</p>

  <p>Now, I hereby announce the beginning of the Wall World!"</p>

  <p>Now, only the wisp of black light in the center and the downgrader within it maintained their original forms.</p>

  <p>Then, the black light also began to be downgraded, slowly sinking into the center of the Wall World.</p>

  <p>The materials in the third-grade world had been in a mess before this began, so when they were downgraded, they grew into an even bigger mess. But the black light was different.</p>

  <p>After the black light merged into the Wall World, it transformed into a sphere, surrounded by ripples of energy of the same length and width. If one overlooked the Wall World, they would find an exquisite black sun symbol.</p>

  <p>Of course, there was no one else in the world to overlook the Wall World.</p>

  <p>After the black sun symbol shrank into oblivion, the downgrader emerged and slowly crawled onto the surface of the Wall World.</p>

  <p>He looked very strange now, as if he were a monster made up of many fragments, just like the strange sculpture on the totem of an ancient race.</p>
