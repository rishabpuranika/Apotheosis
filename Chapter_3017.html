  <p>
</p>

  <p>Located in the south of the Seven-Star Province, the Star City was deemed to be the smallest city in the area. In the whole city, the Star Tower, which was over a thousand feet tall, caught the attention of most people.</p>

  <p>Built by the Sword Light Palace, the Star Tower was an outpost position which was heavily guarded by the Stinger Guards all year round.</p>

  <p>Many divine citizens in the Star City hoped to be an apprentice to the Stinger Guards. Although the Stinger Guards didn't accept disciples, the divine citizens still hoped that the latter could give them some valuable advice, and that was enough for them.</p>

  <p>Annoyed by the persistence of the divine citizens, the Stinger Guards felt that they had no choice but to lock the Star Tower.</p>

  <p>On top of the tower, two men clad in cyan leaned idly against the cushions.</p>

  <p>One of them complained, "I've been on duty here for only one month and I'm already at wit's end! I can't stand this any longer! Imagine, I'll have to stay on duty in this tower for three more years! Is this the life of a Stinger Guard? How could it get so boring?"</p>

  <p>The man who spoke was named Chester Qiu. Six months ago, he passed the assessment of the Sword Light Palace and became a one-star Stinger Guard.</p>

  <p>Being a new Stinger Guard, Chester thought that he could go to other provinces to exorcise demons with the other Stinger Guards. However, he thought wrong for he was assigned to guard the Star City for three years.</p>

  <p>"Oh, come on. Quit ranting. You should be contented. That's only three years compared to my five-year stay here. I've been staying here and will stay for more years in this barren place! By the time I get out, I guess that I won't have any recollection of what the Seven-Star City looks like," the other young man replied.</p>

  <p>The other young man was Hasan Yuebai, also a one-star Stinger Guard.</p>

  <p>After being promoted to Stinger Guards, the disciples of the Sword Light Palace had their first task? to guard the major cities in Seven-Star Province.</p>

  <p>Since the Lofty Sword was there to protect the province, few nonhuman demons dared to cause chaos, making the guards' jobs so boring.</p>

  <p>Rumble!</p>

  <p>While the two guards were talking, there was a low and sudden rumble that came from the ground. The rumbling even caused the Star Tower to shake.</p>

  <p>"What happened?" Hasan curiously asked as he felt the ground tremble.</p>

  <p>"Is there an earthquake?" Chester asked back, frowning.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the ground continued to rattle more violently and so did the Star Tower. Many divine citizens even looked at each other in disorientation as they had no idea of what was happening.</p>

  <p>"Ugh, forget it! Hey, look, what's that?"</p>

  <p>Suddenly, they noticed that there was a huge crack on the ground in front of the Star City.</p>

  <p>Quickly, the crack expanded exponentially and a thick vine consisting of many Man-eating Demon Flowers emerged from it.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the vine rose in the sky and above the whole city.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>High up in the sky, hundreds of thousands of Man-eating Demon Flowers split from the vine and fell like rain.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing the Man-eating Demon Flowers, Chester opened his mouth in disbelief and said, "Damn it! These creatures are the demonic plants from the Gracious Province!"</p>

  <p>"How dare they invade the Seven-Star Province? Do the citizens of Sand Country and the Man-eating Demon Flowers have a death wish? I can make that happen," Hasan shouted out loud.</p>

  <p>Each of the Man-eating Demon Flowers was more than a hundred feet high.</p>

  <p>Falling from the sky, the first group of Man-eating Demon Flowers caused all the buildings in the city to collapse.</p>

  <p>All of the divine citizens in the area fled, but unfortunately, some of them did not make it because they were swallowed by the Man-eating Demon Flowers. Some of the True Gods in the city made an effort to resist the attacks, but there were only a few of them and so many of the enemy creatures. How on earth could they defeat them?</p>

  <p>Seeing this wretched scene in front of him, Chester took out his cyan sword.</p>

  <p>As soon as he unsheathed it, wisps of Truth of Divine Dao spread out from his sword.</p>

  <p>Chester was a Stinger Guard and part of his obligations was to kill the demons that threatened the city. He was not afraid of the gruesome scene. In fact, he felt so excited that his blood was boiling.</p>

  <p>"What the hell are you doing?" Hasan asked angrily as he tried to stop Chester from doing something.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to kill those Man-eating Demon Flowers!"</p>

  <p>Lifting his sword, Chester replied and flew into the air. After flashing the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, streaks of cyan-purple sword radiance suddenly divided the sky.</p>

  <p>The power demonstrated by the sword radiance was great, even invincible.</p>

  <p>And in a heartbeat, dozens of Man-eating Demon Flowers were slashed in perfect half.</p>

  <p>The Man-eating Demon Flowers could fight against top-rank True Gods at most. They were no match for the mighty Stinger Guards.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Hasan rushed to Chester's side like a ghost as he pressed his sword hilt. "There are so many! Can you possibly kill them all? Their king has already reached the fifteenth stage of the Other Shore Realm! If it decides to come here in person, then you would surely die a graveless death. Hurry, we must return to the Sword Light Palace at once!"</p>

  <p>"I'm a Stinger Guard of the Sword Light Palace. How can I..." Chester answered back, displeased.</p>

  <p>"Idiot!"</p>

  <p>Hasan did not hesitate to grab Chester's arm and the sword from his hand in an attempt to use the Grand Teleportation to leave the area.</p>

  <p>Just as he had condensed the space fluctuation, a thick vine shot towards them.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>The vine hit the Star Tower and smashed it into pieces. Upon impact, they felt an overpowering force from the vine.</p>

  <p>In a flash, their bones broke like flimsy sticks and they fell into the city like two blown off kites.</p>

  <p>However, it wasn't yet the end for the vine as it kept attacking, going down in a small arc.</p>

  <p>As they landed harshly on the ground, Hasan limply lay flat on his back and had blood on his face. Chester, on the other hand, had fainted away. Upon seeing him, Hasan cursed, "Damn it! You almost got me killed!"</p>

  <p>He finally became a Stinger Guard. Of course, he didn't want to die in the Seven-Star Province yet without spreading his wings first.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the vine hovered over the city, covering a large area. With its power, it was able to crush everything that was on its way.</p>

  <p>For only a short period of time, hundreds of thousands of Star City divine citizens had been devoured. Afterwards, the Man-eating Demon Flowers attached themselves again to the huge vine and went underground. The vine moved towards the north, leaving the now chaotic city full of mess and appalling holes.</p>

  <p>Tens of thousands of miles away, the thick Lofty Sword would have never been made possible if it weren't for Qiu Yinhe's painstaking efforts.</p>

  <p>Many magic arrays were set in the sword. One of them monitored the entire Seven-Star Province. In fact, it was said that no nonhuman monster could ever escape it.</p>

  <p>But this time, the Lofty Sword did not sense the attack of the Man-eating Demon Flowers.</p>

  <p>Now the Sword Light Palace and the Seven-Star City still remained at peace.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, on the Sea of Truth, both Luo Zheng's and Ling Shuang's Truth Boats propelled forward at an increasing speed.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the anger burning in Ling Shuang's heart had already vanished.</p>

  <p>As a chatterbox, she had been blabbering nonstop while she was behind Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Occasionally, some people would drive their Truth Boats and follow behind Ling Shuang. In this way, they could try and save some of their remaining soul energy. However, she had almost instantly driven them away.</p>

  <p>After about an hour, Luo Zheng heard something from not far away. Listening closely, he interpreted the sounds as cries of some strange insects.</p>

  <p>"Hush! Listen, do you hear that? What's that sound?" Luo Zheng said as he put his finger near his mouth as a sign of silence.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing the instruction, Ling Shuang complied and stopped talking. She listened attentively as she heard the sounds of insects from the soft waves.</p>

  <p>"Look over there!" Luo Zheng reminded in a low and soft voice.</p>

  <p>Ling Shuang looked into Luo Zheng's direction. She saw some Truth Boats that were about half the height of a man floating on the sea not far away from their right.</p>
