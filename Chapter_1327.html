<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1327 Mervin Tie </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The warriors saw that Luo Luo Zheng had no intention of entering the Myriad Spiritual Force House to cultivate, and immediately changed their opinion.</p>

  <p>"Who does he think he is?"</p>

  <p>"Such arrogance. Is he so great to think of himself above the Myriad Spiritual Force House?"</p>

  <p>"How dare a warrior from the Lower World disdain cultivating in here!</p>

  <p>Bastard!"</p>

  <p>The air shifted throughout the entire Myriad Spiritual Force House with the warriors spitting out indignant sneers about Luo Luo Zheng. Soon enough, the rumors of an arrogant Lower World warrior even reached the Holy City.</p>

  <p>It was unheard of that a mere warrior from the Lower World had dared look down on the sacred place that many of them could only yearn for.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had become the target of everyone's ire. At first, they saw it as nothing more than a joke, but now they seriously took offense in his actions.</p>

  <p>The sixth day arrived with a group of warriors appearing in the Myriad Spiritual Force House.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had recognized them instantly. He had seen them before? they were the young warriors who clashed with him when he had just entered the Holy City.</p>

  <p>Two of their strongest warriors had been beaten half to death after the fight. It had taken a few days for them to even barely recover.</p>

  <p>Most of these warriors were direct descendants of the elders of the sacred place. Their talent was undoubtedly of a high-level, but so was their arrogance. News had reached them about the warrior who had appeared and looked down upon the Myriad Spiritual Force House. There was no way that they would tolerate such humiliation.</p>

  <p>When the two warriors had regained their health, the group finally returned to the Myriad Spiritual Force House, where they belonged.</p>

  <p>Their anger fuelled by the rumors, they came and discovered a man sitting in one corner with his eyes closed in meditation. However, when they recognized who he was, their eyes widened in disbelief.</p>

  <p>"How could it be him?"</p>

  <p>"Humph! We've been looking for this bastard everywhere. I never thought that he would enter the Myriad Spiritual Force House."</p>

  <p>"What do we do now? Should we teach him a lesson?"</p>

  <p>That day after their clash, the group had immediately investigated Luo Zheng's identity. The Holy City was such a broad territory, and finding even one person would prove to be a difficult task.</p>

  <p>They never had thought that they would see him in the Myriad Spiritual Force House, of all places, and on top of that, he was the same bastard in the rumors.</p>

  <p>"To think he's a nobody. A scum from the Lower World. Isn't this just hilarious?"</p>

  <p>"It's best not to be careless. This bastard's strength is a bit strange. It would be better to find someone to deal with him."</p>

  <p>"I'll go find someone! I think Mervin Tie would be pretty good. Ha-ha!"</p>

  <p>These warriors were conceited in nature. Had there been no previous conflicts, they still would have found a way to make trouble. To them, the previous clash was favorable. It gave them the perfect excuse to deal with Luo Luo Zheng, for old and new wrongs.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng had displayed great power, and they had first-hand experience with it. The two warriors' injuries were still fresh in their memory. They had to hold back. After some consideration, the group decided that it was best to send someone after him, rather than deal with him on their own.</p>

  <p>Mervin Tie was ranked among top 100 of the 9, 000 warriors in the Myriad Spiritual Force House. Without a doubt, his strength was formidable.</p>

  <p>Having him come and deal with Luo Luo Zheng would be another matter. It would cost a fortune for him to do their bidding, but money was the last concern that the group had. One way or another, they had to save face.</p>

  <p>That was of the utmost priority.</p>

  <p>Thus, they temporarily withdrew today.</p>

  <p>Unbeknownst to them, Luo Luo Zheng heard every word clearly.</p>

  <p>The corners of his mouth curled up in an arc as Luo Luo Zheng kept his eyes closed.</p>

  <p>He had long understood that avoiding trouble with the group was impossible. If they wanted trouble, then he would give them exactly that.</p>

  <p>It was a day later that the warriors returned. This time, however, a noticeable addition to their little group stood out. They walked inside the House, a dark-skinned warrior following them.</p>

  <p>He looked to be around 20 years old. His eyebrows were knit together, and his eyes were ruthless with dagger-like sharpness. Three deep scars ran across one side of his face, giving him a menacing air.</p>

  <p>The group stopped inside the House, and only the dark-skinned man walked directly towards Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"A few days ago, I heard about a Lower World warrior joining the Myriad Spiritual Force House," he said, not bothering with introductions.</p>

  <p>"I heard that he had been looking down on the House and hidden here to cultivate by himself. Is that you?" He spoke coldly, his eyes fixed on Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>At this, Luo Luo Zheng opened his eyes. His expression had remained calm. "I have never looked down on the House. I am only staying here to wait for someone. Therefore, there is no need for me to cultivate in the House," he answered, returning the man's stare with his steady eyes.</p>

  <p>"Waiting for someone?" the dark-skinned man repeated, as if Luo Zheng's answer did not satisfy him. He regarded him for a moment and said,</p>

  <p>"Alright. If you say so." He paused, a cold smile appearing on his face.</p>

  <p>"Then why don't the two of us spar?" he asked. It was not a direct challenge. The dark-skinned man wanted to make sure that Luo Luo Zheng would not be able to refuse. After all, he could not force anyone into fighting against him in the Myriad Spiritual Force House. If Luo Luo Zheng refused, that would be the end of it and there was nothing else he could do.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng swept his eyes over him and repeated, "Spar with you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes!" The warrior smiled and nodded enthusiastically.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng shook his head.</p>

  <p>At this, the warrior's face sank. "What? Are you too afraid?"</p>

  <p>The young warriors listened to the exchange from where they were, wearing dissatisfied expressions. They had spent a lot of money making Mervin Tie agree to what they wanted. Even if Luo Luo Zheng refused, they wouldn't be able to take the money back.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled as he lifted his head. "It's not that I don't dare to." He stared at the young man before continuing, "It's because you are not qualified."</p>

  <p>As the words left his mouth, an angry flush crept onto Mervin Tie's face.</p>

  <p>At once, he turned completely red, like a piece of burning iron.</p>

  <p>He himself was one of the top 100 talents in the Spiritual Force Sacred Place. During his tribulation, his Lotus Flower had sprouted three petals.</p>

  <p>Even beyond all this, he had already entered the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>Although he was only at the first stage, his strength was not to be underestimated. Other ordinary warriors at the Soul Sea Realm were no match for him.</p>

  <p>And yet here was a Life and Death Realm warrior telling him that he wasn't qualified to spar with him. He boiled over in fury, and his fists clenched in an effort to contain his anger.</p>

  <p>Mervin Tie was quite strong, and he was a man of action. He did not say anything back to Luo Luo Zheng, but held his breath and locked his burning eyes at him as if he wanted to swallow him whole.</p>

  <p>The young warriors behind Mervin Tie could no longer hold back their anger and began cursing.</p>

  <p>"How dare you! You are nothing but a Life and Death Realm warrior.</p>

  <p>You are not qualified to even talk back."</p>

  <p>"You think this is the Lower World? The talents in our Spiritual Force Sacred Place are masters that your puny brain cannot even imagine!"</p>

  <p>"If you are too scared and does not want to accept, then you can just say so. How can you reject it with such outrageous reason? I've never known Lower World warriors are such cowards."</p>

  <p>The atmosphere grew heavy as the other talents of the Spiritual Force Sacred Place grew outraged at the scene. Luo Luo Zheng was looking down on Mervin Tie, a warrior who was ranked among the top 100. This meant that he was looking down on them as well.</p>

  <p>Mervin Tie finally made his move. He took a few deep breaths, seemingly to calm himself, and then said to Luo Luo Zheng, "It doesn't matter whether you think I am qualified or not. You must accept my challenge.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, don't blame me for what happens here."</p>

  <p>The Myriad Spiritual Force House was not a place where they could freely attack. However, at this moment, all of the warriors' anger prevailed. Even if Mervin Tie broke the rules, no one would stop him for doing so. All they wanted was to see Luo Luo Zheng get beaten up.</p>

  <p>Mervin Tie knew this as well, and he was prepared to take advantage of his favored position.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng remained calm despite all the animosity directed at him. "You are not qualified, and I mean it. If you attack me, it'll bring nothing but humiliation to yourself. Are you sure you are prepared for that?" he said seriously.</p>

  <p>Mervin Tie's ears almost rang in his anger. His closed fists shook at Luo Zheng's words. He no longer had any desire to talk. He circulated his life vitality.</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng wouldn't accept his challenge, then he would just have to force him into action.</p>

  <p>At this moment, a white-clothed warrior appeared. "Mervin, what he says is true. Your strength is still inadequate to face him," he said indifferently.</p>

  <p>"Fenton!"</p>

  <p>"Fenton Sima actually came!"</p>

  <p>"Is he here for  Luo Luo Zheng Luo too?"</p>

  <p>Fenton was the number one talent in the Myriad Spiritual Force House.</p>

  <p>Even the second-ranked warrior was very far inferior to him in terms of strength and skills.</p>
