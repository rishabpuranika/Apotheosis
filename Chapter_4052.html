<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4052 Sacrifice </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Decker's eyes lit up. "Let's go there!"</p>

  <p>"What's happening?" the Snake Goddess asked.</p>

  <p>"There is an entire race to be sacrificed and there will be a lot of Arcana. I wonder whether you are interested in making a move or not," said Decker.</p>

  <p>The prey on the Night View Island was not enough. There would often be wars among the various races. The races that lost would become captives, and the only fate of being captured was to be sacrificed.</p>

  <p>All the people present had experienced a lot of fights. They understood the cruelty on the Night View Island.</p>

  <p>Since the members of a whole race were to be sacrificed, the number of Arcana to be produced was large.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and his group didn't get many Arcana?now was their chance.</p>

  <p>"Let's go and take a look," suggested Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Fuxi and the others nodded. That night, they quietly left the cave and headed south.</p>

  <p>Miserable screams echoed from two mountains away. The distance wasn't far from them.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng and his group climbed over the first mountain, white hairs slowly flew towards them, coming from the mountain's side.</p>

  <p>Although the Ghost Powder could hide the aura of life energy, they could still attract white-haired monsters as long as they moved.</p>

  <p>Everyone stopped moving and stood like statues. The white-haired monsters then disappeared, and they continued with their journey.</p>

  <p>Near a lake at the foot of the mountain, hundreds of creatures appeared trapped, bound by silver chains.</p>

  <p>They didn't have Ghost Powder on their bodies and the silver chains disabled their every move.</p>

  <p>Out of nowhere, the white-haired monsters appeared like sharks that had smelled blood, devouring the poor creatures.</p>

  <p>The number of creatures that each white-haired monster swallowed was limited to ten. After that, the monsters turned into a pile of white hairs and gradually dissipated?leaving behind many Arcana.</p>

  <p>The remaining creatures trembled as they saw their companions being swallowed little by little. Their chests were filled with fear as the blood of different colors splashed out from the horrible scene.</p>

  <p>Screams, pleas, and the sound of kowtows rang one after another, yet no one could save them...</p>

  <p>Flocks of bird-like creatures stood by the lake. Their wings were folded on their backs and they possessed sharp claws. Their bodies were similar to a human's. Their claws each held a sharp wooden stick, with the end smeared with thick black poison.</p>

  <p>"Glede Demon race!" Decker exclaimed in surprise.</p>

  <p>"I feel that they are very strong," Pearson said.</p>

  <p>"It's one of the strongest races on the Night View Island," Decker said with a complicated expression. "But that's not the problem. How dare they catch so many races and sacrifice them all!"</p>

  <p>"Why, aren't they supposed to do that?" Pearson was confused.</p>

  <p>For both the Grand Pure Realm and the Supreme Pure Realm, the weak races were like helpless fish on a chopping board; they were always slaughtered by stronger races.</p>

  <p>Since the Glede Demon race was very powerful, they wouldn't have any difficulty sacrificing their captives.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess figured out Decker's point. "If they sacrifice so many creatures at a time, it might cause a backlash..."</p>

  <p>"Exactly." Decker nodded.</p>

  <p>Sacrificing the defeated races often happened on the Night View Island, but it was rare to see several races sacrificed at a time.</p>

  <p>Even the Red Demon race and the Grand Mighty race which were at par with the Glede Demon race on the Night View Island wouldn't do that.</p>

  <p>The weak races were not idiots themselves. They were connected, and some of them had close associations.</p>

  <p>Any force sacrificing several races at a time would cause a large number of weak races to team up as allies.</p>

  <p>After allying, there would be a reshuffling of powers among the forces on the Night View Island.</p>

  <p>Such things had happened several times in history. The top-ranked races were killed by the alliance every time. As time passed, the alliance fell into a state of disunity, and finally, the situation returned to its original state.</p>

  <p>"If the Glede Demon race dares to do so, something must have happened in the Ghost Mountain. They need to accumulate enough Arcana, alas..."</p>

  <p>Decker concluded. The Wooden Leaf race was also a weak race. He felt sorry upon realizing the fate of these several races.</p>

  <p>The process of the sacrifice was rough.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, more than ten strong warriors had broken the silver chains, fleeing in all directions.</p>

  <p>The Glede Demons on guard flew one after another. They raised the wooden sticks, aimed at the creatures, and threw them down swiftly.</p>

  <p>"Puff, puff, puff..."</p>

  <p>The wood sticks thrown by the Glede Demons hit their targets hard and accurately. They nailed the warriors to the ground, forbidding their escape.</p>

  <p>The well-trained Glede Demons returned and lined up once again.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and the others couldn't help but frown upon witnessing the fighting strategy.</p>

  <p>Just as Decker said, the strength of the Glede Demon race was far stronger than that of ordinary races. It would indeed be very difficult to fight them.</p>

  <p>The white-haired monsters were efficient. In just an hour, hundreds of creatures from other races had been completely devoured at the foot of the mountain, leaving the Arcana on the ground.</p>

  <p>These creatures had lost a lot of blood as they were swallowed. The blood flowed into the lake, dying it with vivid colors as it mixed with the water's rippling.</p>

  <p>"These Arcana are enough to let you all enter the Ghost Mountain," said Decker. "But the Glede Demons are very troublesome. They like to act as a group while each of them is very strong!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, the Snake Goddess, and the others didn't say anything. They observed in silence.</p>

  <p>Getting these Arcana could save them a lot of time, and they didn't have to invade the mountains one by one.</p>

  <p>It would be difficult to obtain the Arcana directly from the Glede Demon race, however, there was still a chance. They still had the Light of Annihilation, which could burst out and destroy the Treacherous Beings that the Glede Demons had merged with.</p>

  <p>The Glede Demons quickly collected the Arcana on the ground and put them into a gray cloth bag. One of the Glede Demons flew to a huge nearby tree while carrying the bag.</p>

  <p>Only then did Luo Zheng and the others discover that a Glede Demon was hiding on the top of the tree!</p>

  <p>The Glede Demon had sharp eyes; each of his feathers was like a dagger sticking out from his body. The feathers were pure silver, reflecting light that was inconcealable by the layer of Ghost Powder on his body.</p>

  <p>"That's Bacchus, the leader of the Glede Demon race," said Decker in almost a whisper.</p>

  <p>Taking over the cloth bag, Bacchus looked at the Arcana within it and seemed dissatisfied. "Nearly five hundred captives afflicted, yet you only obtained a few Arcana. These are only two thousand. Why?"</p>

  <p>Several Glede Demons lowered their heads in silence.</p>

  <p>The number of Arcana produced after a captive was afflicted did not result in a fixed amount.</p>

  <p>Up until now, no one had figured out the rules.</p>

  <p>The number of Arcana produced was at random.</p>

  <p>In some cases, a lot of Arcana had appeared after small creatures were swallowed up, while there had only been a few Arcana with large creatures.</p>

  <p>Even after a pair of identical twins were killed, there was a huge difference in the number of Arcana from them.</p>

  <p>In other words, the amount of Arcana that appeared after the creatures were sacrificed was entirely based on the mood of the white-haired monsters.</p>

  <p>For ordinary races such as the Wooden Leaf race, two thousand Arcana was a rare great harvest.</p>

  <p>However, Bacchus was still unhappy with this number because the Glede Demon race paid a huge price to get these captives.</p>

  <p>"We... we have accumulated a lot of Arcana. Isn't it enough?" one of the Glede Demons couldn't help asking.</p>

  <p>Around this time, they had already slaughtered nearly more than forty races; there were even a few large races among them.</p>

  <p>They had already surrendered a lot of Arcana in the hands of the leader, but these Glede Demons couldn't figure out the reason it was not enough.</p>

  <p>"It's not enough," Bacchus answered coldly. "That's all for tonight. Follow me to the West Shrine Mountain tomorrow!"</p>

  <p>When he was about to leave, he looked up at the mountain and said in a chilling voice, "You have hidden for so long. Why don't you come out?"</p>
