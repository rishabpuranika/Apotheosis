</p>

  <p>Camilla smiled as she replied, "Don't worry, I won't hurt him!"</p>

  <p>But just as she finished talking, the palm shadows around Luo Luo Zheng became more intense and intimidating by the minute.</p>

  <p>Her hands were delicate but she was capable of chopping a bronze statue made of fine iron into pieces. If Luo Luo Zheng couldn't think of a way to deal with her, then she would definitely hurt him.</p>

  <p>A light sparkled and burst out of Luo Zheng's eyes as he tried to comprehend the Time Law that Camilla was using.</p>

  <p>"It won't help if you don't move. I'm really going to attack!" Camilla said with a hint of disdain as she saw Luo Luo Zheng staring blankly at her. Who knew what kind of tricks this fellow had used to fool Randy into including him in the team?</p>

  <p>She used a majority of her strength to hack at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had been comprehending for a long time, but he finally shook his head. He reached out and easily grabbed Camilla's slender hands. He then said softly, "The power of the Time Law in your strike is too little for me to comprehend."</p>

  <p>He had caught Camilla's hands so swiftly and easily that it looked like Camilla had just offered them to him to hold instead of trying to attack him.</p>

  <p>Camilla was dumbstruck for a moment. She wanted to pull her hands back from Luo Zheng's, but found that she couldn't. It was as if her hands were clamped down by a pair of large pincers.</p>

  <p>Renzo and Barry had expected this to be a good show. They wanted to see what kind of method Luo Luo Zheng would use to fight against Camilla's attack.</p>

  <p>Camilla's attack from the Thousand Lady Hands dazzled the people present there as if they had seen countless flower petals falling down. It contained a trace of the Time Law, which could change the time flow rate in a short period of time. It was next to impossible to break it; only method which was more powerful could do this.</p>

  <p>But they never expected Luo Luo Zheng to break it with a simple move. They looked at each other, exchanging puzzled glances and they knew that each was more shocked than the other.</p>

  <p>A faint smile appeared on Randy's face, as if everything was happening according to his will. But there was still a trace of surprise in his smile.</p>

  <p>He had predicted that Luo Luo Zheng would be able to break Camilla's attack, but he hadn't expected it to be so soon, as simply as having a meal or drinking water.</p>

  <p>It was as if Luo Zheng's strength had far exceeded the strength that a Virtual Tribulation Realm warrior should technically have. Only this line of reasoning allowed for the fact that he had demonstrated such an amazing stunt.</p>

  <p>"You, leave me!" Camilla wanted to pull her hands out of Luo Zheng's but after trying several times, she was still unable to do so. She glared at Luo Luo Zheng, her eyes almost popping out of their sockets. Her face flushed in anger.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng then let go of her hands, a smile playing on his face. But before he could say anything, Camilla asked angrily, "What do you mean by the power of the Time Law is too little? You want to comprehend the Time Law from me!"</p>

  <p>Everyone was baffled at this.</p>

  <p>To start with, it was difficult to comprehend the Time Law. Moreover, the Time Law that Camilla had displayed was activated by her own life vitality. The Time Law activated by life vitality would usually be in a state of chaos, and only someone who had mastered the Time Law could control it. It would be impossible for Luo Luo Zheng to comprehend his opponent's Law Power during battle, however badly he wanted it.</p>

  <p>What they didn't know was that Luo Luo Zheng had the highest degree of affinity with the Law Power in the entire universe after withstanding the baptism by laws. It might be difficult for others to comprehend the Law Power, but not for Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The two most powerful laws were the Space Law and the Time Law. Luo Luo Zheng had already comprehended the Space Law, but until now, he hadn't experienced the Time Law. This was the first time that he had ever seen it in action!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled faintly and said, "Why would I let the chance to comprehend the Time Law slip by?"</p>

  <p>"Humph!" Camilla snorted coldly. "Even I have only comprehended just 10% of the Time Law! You think it's that easy to comprehend it?"</p>

  <p>"It's 10% of the first layer of the Time Law, right?" Luo Luo Zheng asked nonchalantly, not caring if his remarks offended her.</p>

  <p>Camilla's face swelled with anger and she glared at him, as if she would like nothing better than to kill him.</p>

  <p>Compared to the other basic laws in the universe, the Time Law and Space Law were extremely rare and precious, making it much more difficult to practice them.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had learned the first layer of the Space Law in the Genuine Dragon World, and the second layer from the Talent Tablet in the Tower of Sin. It was extremely difficult to find the tablet that carried the inheritance of the Space Law or the Time Law in the great world.</p>

  <p>But the Time Law that Camilla had cultivated was even more difficult than the Space Law. Its power was even greater than that of all the other basic laws combined. The Time Law could enable the cultivator to change the time flow rate, which left much room for the cultivator to bring out his or her best potential and bring the enemy down.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the fact that Camilla was able to comprehend 10% of the first layer of the Time Law was enough to make her far superior to the other martial artists at the same level.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng, on the other hand, pitied her for having comprehended so little.</p>

  <p>And his pitying look pissed Camilla off to no end.</p>

  <p>Randy walked over, grinning. He said, "Alright, let's call it a day. Tianxing's strength should be no less than mine. He will definitely be of great help if he joins our team."</p>

  <p>"Humph!" Camilla huffed and puffed, unconvinced.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had casually broken her attack by simply reaching out and grabbing her. And with Randy's obvious favor to him, she realized that Luo Zheng's strength was at the same level as Gregory's. He was an extraordinary talent who should have been ranked in the first tier.</p>

  <p>There were countless martial artists in the Harlan Divine Kingdom. But there were only four people at the first tier. And right now, Luo Zheng's strength was beyond her imagination.</p>

  <p>Randy said to Luo Luo Zheng, "I can tell that you've always been a loner. You don't seem to understand the meaning of teaming up."</p>

  <p>Randy's words reminded Luo Luo Zheng of the Heavenly Evil Sect that Eddie had set up. Back then, the Heavenly Evil Sect had a special way to combine the life vitality of tens of thousands of Illuminating Soul Realm warriors, which made it possible for these low-level warriors to display a power that was terrifying to say the least.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded at Randy's words.</p>

  <p>Randy waved at Renzo, Camilla, and Barry, and then walked to the center of the hall to extend a hand to Luo Luo Zheng, saying, "You can try to attack me."</p>
