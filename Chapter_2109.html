  <p>
</p>

  <p>The divine land, over time, had developed countless divine eras.</p>

  <p>The passage of time here was unimaginably long.</p>

  <p>A set of strict rules had been put into place in the divine land. A few of these rules were so important that even a Holy Being wouldn't dare be caught defying one of them.</p>

  <p>Once Murphy had put his anger into action, he received the punishment he deserved, to say the least. There was no room for disobedience!</p>

  <p>Wynn didn't speak up much about the way Luo Luo Zheng was going to be sent into the divine land. In fact, it had taken quite some time for Mike's disciples to figure out a plan for forcing Irene into returning to the divine land.</p>

  <p>Tianming, in fact, had also entered the divine land by sneaking in.</p>

  <p>No matter if it was Tianming or Luo Luo Zheng, if they entered the divine land using any normal method, the Mu Clan would immediately be informed about their arrival.</p>

  <p>One of the reasons why their blood had been exchanged was just for that: to avoid being tracked.</p>

  <p>If Murphy had been able to track them, then the ten Godly Geniuses would all be doomed.</p>

  <p>"I have no choice but to sneak into the divine land..." Luo Luo Zheng frowned as he murmured to himself.</p>

  <p>"This has been decided a long time ago. Even if I die, there will still be others to help you sneak over there," Wynn said.</p>

  <p>Wynn had managed to survive the great war. If he died now though, the weighted responsibility of helping Luo Luo Zheng and the others sneak into the divine land would be handed over to Master Feng and the other Celestial Position members.</p>

  <p>"I understand," Luo Luo Zheng nodded. In the end, it didn't matter to him what method he used in order to enter the divine land.</p>

  <p>"When you're ready, you can come and find me. That said, it's best if you enter the divine land as soon as possible. Although they can try their best to hinder the Jiang Clan, they might send someone else over at any moment..." Wynn added, matter-of-factly.</p>

  <p>"You know, Irene is a friendly young lady. Try not to worry too much, she isn't as harsh as she seems," Luo Luo Zheng explained as he recalled his conversation with her.</p>

  <p>Wynn smiled. "Well, she isn't as friendly as you think, either. Anyone who sent by the Jiang Clan to control the heavens is far more powerful than you can ever imagine. It's not that simple. What's more, she isn't a 'young lady'.</p>

  <p>Judging by the average life span of a True God, she would still be relatively young.</p>

  <p>However, if one was to calculate according to the time flow rate in the Evolutionary Universe, she would be over twenty billion years old!"</p>

  <p>Both Luo Luo Zheng and Master Feng were rendered speechless in an instant.</p>

  <p>That meant that even Master Feng was much younger than Irene, not to mention that Luo Luo Zheng himself was nothing more than a few decades old.</p>

  <p>Twenty billion years of age... Unbelievable! That was equivalent to several grand eras.</p>

  <p>This woman had lived for so long and yet she was still capable of communicating with Luo Luo Zheng like any other ordinary young lady. It was indeed hard to imagine how she had lived through the past countless years.</p>

  <p>Now that Luo Luo Zheng had the right conditions for going to the divine land, his only remaining task was to arrange his family members well.</p>

  <p>Over the years, Luo Luo Zheng had always been worried about the problem of time.</p>

  <p>However, in the Immortal Mansion, Luo Luo Zheng had finally discovered a way to solve such an issue.</p>

  <p>Saul told Luo Luo Zheng that after he obtained the last token? the earth token, he would be able to enter the training tower. The Time Law in the training tower was steady, and Bromley's ingenious design had allowed the time on different floors to be condensed to different levels.</p>

  <p>The training tower was divided into four floors: The first floor had a time flow rate of one to one, the second floor had a time flow rate of one hundred to one, the third floor had a time flow rate of one thousand to one, and the fourth floor was ten thousand to one. Generally speaking, anywhere affected by the Time Law wasn't suitable for cultivation, because other Laws would also be twisted by the distortion of the Time Law.</p>

  <p>Within the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, Holy Drew had helped Luo Luo Zheng refine his body. The Time Law there had been distorted beyond recognition, it was therefore almost impossible to cultivate in such a state.</p>

  <p>Despite that though, the training tower was a rare exception. Bromley had created this unique tower with his own power and it was thus extremely stable. Once the training tower was opened, Luo Luo Zheng would without a doubt have enough time to cultivate. According to Saul, the Immortal Mansion was located in the Swirl Forest, which was known as a forbidden area in the divine land.</p>

  <p>The time flow rate in the Swirl Forest was the same as that of the entire divine land. However, once the enchanted barrier was activated, the time flow rate within the Immortal Mansion matched that of the Evolutionary Universe. This was because the enchanted barrier that enveloped the Immortal Mansion isolated it from the rest of the divine land, affecting the flow of time.</p>

  <p>Once Luo Luo Zheng had obtained the earth token and collected all eight tokens, he would have the capacity of removing the enchanted barrier that shrouded the Immortal Mansion. Following this, the time flow rate in the Immortal Mansion would no longer match that of the universe but instead, would be the same as that of the divine land.</p>

  <p>As a result, arranging his family members there, in the Immortal Mansion, became Luo Zheng's only clear option.</p>

  <p>Throughout that period of time, every time Luo Luo Zheng would set foot in the Immortal Mansion, Master Evil and Wayne would circle him like flies.</p>

  <p>The blue-robed woman had returned to the Immortal Mansion. She had penetrated through the enchanted barrier with ease and left the Immortal Mansion on her own.</p>

  <p>Master Evil and Wayne also had the desire to leave the Immortal Mansion and yet, they dared not approach the woman. When the blue-robed woman returned to the Immortal Mansion, both men had already disappeared, hiding in the dungeon. After she left, the enchanted barrier automatically closed behind her, and neither of them had the ability to break through it. All they could do now was to wait patiently for Luo Luo Zheng, in hopes that he would let them out.</p>

  <p>The problem was that Luo Luo Zheng still couldn't control the opening and closing of the enchanted barrier on his own. He still hadn't obtained the earth token and was unable to completely control the Immortal Mansion just yet.</p>

  <p>Irritated and annoyed by these two people who bothered him all the time, Luo Luo Zheng suggested that they enter the Evolutionary Universe and leave through there. However, they immediately refused his suggestion. They knew that the universe was closely monitored by Holy Beings. How would they even have the guts to appear in the Evolutionary Universe?</p>

  <p>In other words, that was the equivalence of courting death.</p>

  <p>With such negation toward his suggestion, Luo Luo Zheng could only ask them to sit patiently and wait.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had finally made up his mind: he decided to challenge the True Path once again.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had made full preparations for the final phase of the True Path. With his current abilities, he believed that it wouldn't be too difficult for him to get through the True Path.</p>

  <p>Despite his abilities though, the final phase of the True Path had been ingeniously designed by Bromley. It would certainly be a difficult task for Luo Luo Zheng, whether he liked it or not.</p>

  <p>In fact, this phase of the True Path was no longer a path, but a huge maze!</p>

  <p>The Sacred warriors in this maze weren't very strong, though. At least Luo Luo Zheng would easily defeat them with his current strength.</p>

  <p>The maze itself was very complex. Straight from the entrance, it contained the powers of the five elements. Luo Luo Zheng wandered around within it for dozens of hours before finding himself exactly where he had started. He was confused and dizzy.</p>

  <p>In the end, he felt helpless enough to give up and leave the True Path.</p>

  <p>This was the first and only time that he ever had given up halfway on the True Path!</p>

  <p>"I wonder why Master set up such a confusing and irritating maze at the end of the True Path," Luo Luo Zheng furrowed his brow and muttered aloud.</p>

  <p>"Because this maze is very important." As Luo Luo Zheng obtained more and more tokens, Saul seemed to hide less and less information from him. "Master wants you to remember this maze."</p>

  <p>"What's the meaning of it, though?" Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter what the meaning is. You just need to succeed in finishing this maze!"</p>

  <p>"I just can't wait any longer. I've already been delayed for a few more years!"</p>

  <p>Master Evil and Wayne both dreamed of the day they'd finally leave the Immortal Mansion. Although Luo Luo Zheng had finally released them from the dungeon, they never thought that they would be trapped inside the Immortal Mansion's enchanted barrier!</p>

  <p>If it wasn't for the fact that they were afraid of triggering a few of the restrictive spells within the Immortal Mansion, they would've already tried destroying it long ago.</p>

  <p>Right now, they had to wait for Luo Luo Zheng to pass the True Path!</p>

  <p>"This maze is related to the disappearance of the Sacred race, and it was not invented by Master. It actually exists in the world," Saul explained.</p>

  <p>"However, the maze built by the Sacred race was countless times larger and more complicated than the one in front of you. Back then, even Master was unable to pass through that maze... until he was trapped inside it for twelve divine eras. After finally escaping from the maze, he replicated a small part of it according to his memories."</p>

  <p>"Even Master can't successfully pass through the Sacred race's maze?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng asked as obvious astonishment quickly filled his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that is true, but this maze really does have an exit. Master wants you to firmly carve this maze into your mind. Just as it was carved into his," Saul replied.</p>

  <p>Since Saul had described it as of utmost importance, Luo Luo Zheng had no other choice but to challenge the maze again and again. In fact, with Luo Zheng's current memory, no matter how complicated the route was, he would still remember it. This maze seemed to be an illusionary one though, and therefore Luo Luo Zheng wouldn't have the chance of repeating the same route twice.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's only option left was extremely stupid: that of only turning right in the maze. Theoretically, even in the most complex maze, he would eventually find the exit if he always chose one same direction.</p>

  <p>Ultimately, Luo Luo Zheng spent nearly four months in the maze before managing his way out, after a countless number of attempts and failures.</p>

  <p>Just like Saul had said, this maze had been deeply engraved in Luo Zheng's mind from beginning to end. That said though, he couldn't think of any use for remembering the maze's route.</p>

  <p>Once Luo Luo Zheng had the earth token in hand, he didn't even have the time to open the training tower before Master Evil and Wayne were already anxiously asking him to open the enchanted barrier for them.</p>
