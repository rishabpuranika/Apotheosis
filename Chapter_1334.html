</p>

  <p>This technique of using the sword to draw the state consumed a great deal of blood essence!</p>

  <p>And it was not easy for any martial artist to restore blood essence once it had been consumed.</p>

  <p>However, Fenton did not want to lose against Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Fenton didn't think himself to be an invincible one among his peers, who were on the same level as him.</p>

  <p>Fenton was an undefeatable figure in the eyes of many warriors of the Spiritual Force Sacred Place. However, in the Spirit Reading World, he was only ranked in the third place.</p>

  <p>There were many extraordinary talents in the top two sacred places of the Spirit Reading World, such as the son of the world lord of the Spirit Reading World?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had only ascended to the Upper World.</p>

  <p>Be it the resources or environment, those in the Lower World couldn't compare to those in the Upper World. Thus, the martial artists who had ascended from the Lower World were a great deal weaker than those who were born and raised in the Upper World from the start.</p>

  <p>This idea was carved into the bones of the martial artists in the Upper World and even Fenton was no exception.</p>

  <p>As his blood essence continued to spurt out, the golden colored state in the painting became tainted with a trace of the intense bloody Mu Ning!</p>

  <p>In the painting, the state was not a peaceful land where songs and dances were performed, signifying good times, but it was a place where horses trampled on the land and heroes contended for hegemony!</p>

  <p>Countless blood-stained soldiers were depicted in this sword painting.</p>

  <p>The bright red colors served as the finishing touches to this enormous State Painting!</p>

  <p>By now Fenton had accumulated enough energy for this strike! He swung his sword all of a sudden.</p>

  <p>"Pa?"</p>

  <p>When his sword struck, a beam of bright silver light flashed like a pair of sharp scissors, slicing the State Painting into two!</p>

  <p>All the images on the painting started to twist and distort, converging into the beam of light and charging towards Luo Luo Zheng at the same time!</p>

  <p>"It's coming!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng retreated quickly when he was faced with Fenton's full attack.</p>

  <p>The power contained within this strike was extremely special. Although this State Painting had been created using the Metal Law and the Wind Law, and it was also infused with Fenton's blood essence, it created an extraordinary and special intent!</p>

  <p>This kind of intent also put psychological pressure on Luo Luo Zheng. Its power could not be underestimated.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng was no longer the same warrior as before. He had many methods of dealing with this strike. The simplest and crudest one was to use the Magnetic Sacred Mountain.</p>

  <p>This Magnetic Sacred Mountain was so powerful that even the masters of the Spirit Supreme Realm couldn't do anything to deflect it. The sword couldn't move it even the slightest bit.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng's intention was not to use the Magnetic Sacred Mountain to block Fenton's attack.</p>

  <p>After all, he was only sparring with Fenton. Even though Fenton had used a secondary first-rank divine weapon and there would be nothing wrong in using the Magnetic Sacred Mountain against him, Luo Luo Zheng was not going to rely on the Magnetic Sacred Mountain to defeat his opponent.</p>

  <p>He wanted to use his own strength to avert the sword strike. He needed to gauge the gap between himself and the talents of the Upper World?</p>

  <p>As the consummate sword intent swirled out from Luo Zheng's hand, the chaotic energy in his body also slowly spun!</p>

  <p>Since his sword intent had reached the consummate level, he had stopped practicing further, but he had developed some insights in the art of swordsmanship. As the chaotic energy fueled his sword intent, he felt his sword intent getting enhanced!</p>

  <p>'I will resist this attack with my body, a sacred weapon!'</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng retreated some distance and made up his mind about how he would deal with the attack. Unexpectedly, he charged towards the beam of light coming from Fenton's sword.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Fenton was astonished once again. 'What was this guy trying to do?' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>He had thought that Luo Luo Zheng would have some sort of trump card or defensive weapon to block his attack, or that he would be able to evade his sword with his flexible physical skills.</p>

  <p>However, this fellow didn't dodge the strike, instead he was coming alone, unarmed, to face a secondary first-rank sacred weapon!</p>

  <p>The thousands of martial artists in the Dragon Tiger Hall, who were watching them, were also confused. They finally saw Luo Zheng's strength, as the Wind Law erupted from him. Although they were confident about Fenton's State Painting drawn by his sword, they were still a little worried.</p>

  <p>Who knew what trump card Luo Luo Zheng had up his sleeve?</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng didn't seem to have any special ways of dealing with the attack.</p>

  <p>He was still using his 'life vitality' to drive the sword intent. This meant that either he was not taking Fenton seriously or he was courting death!</p>

  <p>The Saint Lord of the Spiritual Force Sacred Place didn't pay much attention to this battle. The result didn't matter to him as he could not keep Luo Luo Zheng in the sacred place either way. However, when he saw that Luo Luo Zheng was fighting Fenton's strongest move this way, a strange expression appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>"This kid is taking such a radical stance. His every move has been beyond my expectations?" Elder Gong muttered, "But he has overestimated himself this time. It's wishful thinking on his part if he thinks he can just rely on the consummate sword intent to fight against Fenton's State Painting. But considering that there is no danger in the Illusion Space, maybe he is only trying it out... This brat is very bold!"</p>

  <p>Elder Gong had actually guessed Luo Zheng's strategy to a certain extent, but he didn't expect what happened the next!</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng fell into the beam of light, countless soldiers materialized in front of him out of nowhere. Each of them held a sword in their hands, which they swung at Luo Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>"This beam of light is... It's just like an army of ten million men! If they were to rush over like this, they would make a clean sweep of all the obstacles in their paths!"</p>

  <p>What was even more terrifying was that the illusory soldiers seemed to be synced to each other. Every time an attack was launched, tens of thousands of them would attack with their swords at the same time. If he let his guard down even for a micro-second, he would be dismembered.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng didn't cease his attack at all, bravely trooping forward!</p>

  <p>He instantly blocked countless strikes with his long sword. In order to strike faster, Luo Luo Zheng also employed the Time Law!</p>

  <p>Within a fraction of a second, his sword created thousands or even tens of thousands of beams of light!</p>

  <p>"Whoosh! Clank! Clank! Clank! Clank!"</p>

  <p>As the beams of light from the sword clashed, metallic sounds rang out throughout the place!</p>

  <p>"Kill!"</p>

  <p>As the sword intent swirled in the air, it instantly shredded thousands of soldiers. However, the number of soldiers in the State Painting was infinite. As Luo Luo Zheng killed crazily, the number of soldiers in the painting kept swarming out. It was impossible to kill them all, and the number of soldiers was increasing.</p>

  <p>Fenton's face was calm. 'The intent of the State Painting is fused with the unceasingly formidable power. How will it be possible to obliterate it with just the sword in your hand? To use a single sword against my move is simply too reckless. In the end, it will only bring you shame?'</p>

  <p>Just as Fenton thought, Luo Luo Zheng was indeed in big trouble!</p>

  <p>Although the beam of light from Fenton's sword was powerful, it was not very sharp. Within this endless intent, the illusory soldiers rushed over like tidewater. There were too many of them. Luo Luo Zheng kept killing them desperately but there seemed to be no end in sight.</p>

  <p>Other than ordinary soldiers, there were also some generals wearing red armors! The illusory generals were even stronger, and it was even more difficult for Luo Luo Zheng to fight them.</p>

  <p>Right now, he was in a dilemma!</p>

  <p>'Fenton's move cannot be endless? ' When Luo Luo Zheng unleashed his sword intent once more, a look of contemplation appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Luo Zheng's figure flashed upwards, and the beam of light from Fenton's sword followed closely behind him as if it was a maggot attached to his bone. Luo Zheng's figure only paused for a moment before it dropped on him once again. He had to face the endless attacks from the illusion of the soldiers and generals once more.</p>

  <p>"I found it!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>The beam of light had absorbed the State Painting, and the state in it was ruled by people, and the mountains and rivers also belonged to the people. They must be ruled by someone!</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng widened the distance between them, he discovered that there was a king dressed in yellow robes hiding deep within this beam of light.</p>

  <p>The soldiers, generals and the king must have been formed by a kind of spiritual projection technique, which was much more profound and extensive than that of the Lower World?</p>

  <p>"That's him!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did not retreat now. Instead, he charged straight at his target? the king!</p>

  <p>If he could kill him, the beam of light emitting from the State Painting would naturally dissipate!</p>

  <p>Seeing Luo Zheng's actions, Fenton's mouth curved slightly. "You finally found him. But do you think you can defeat him?"</p>

  <p>"Whoosh whoosh whoosh?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng shattered numerous illusions and in an instant, he had passed the thousands of soldiers and arrived in front of the king.</p>
