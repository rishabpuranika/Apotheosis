  <p>
</p>

  <p>Most of the people from the Nine Li race who had acquired the Nine Li Wild Body could only grow one additional head and two additional arms.</p>

  <p>Warriors whose blood purity was at the fifth grade or above, however, had three heads and six arms when they activated their Wild Body, but they were far and few in between.</p>

  <p>Other than the exiles, only about five people in the Nine Li race had such a Wild Body.</p>

  <p>Moreover, except for the Grand Elder, who had ended up with three heads and six arms the very first time she had gone through the Body Tribulations, the other warriors had gotten only two heads and four arms after the first time they had gone through the Body Tribulations. It was only after their second time that they had ended up with three heads and six arms.</p>

  <p>But since the purity of Luo Zheng's bloodline was far greater than that of ordinary people, it was no surprise that he had three heads and six arms after becoming a mid-rank Wild God.</p>

  <p>'The brains in the two new heads are empty, and there is no soul. They are still controlled by my own soul...' Luo Zheng inferred.</p>

  <p>Since it was his first time assuming the form of the Nine Li Wild Body, he was still trying to get used to the strange sensation of having three heads and six arms.</p>

  <p>When he raised his two arms, all six arms rose up. And when he lowered his head, three heads lowered at the same time.</p>

  <p>As he looked down with his three pairs of eyes, Luo Zheng realized that he had a wider vision and could see a lot more things around him.</p>

  <p>"Interesting... I guess I'll need some time to get used to this. Eh? What's this?"</p>

  <p>Suddenly, he discovered an odd structure in his body.</p>

  <p>At the center of his ribs, in his chest, there was a diamond-shaped sclerite.</p>

  <p>This sclerite was something that had appeared after he had reshaped his body, but since all his focus had been on his new heads and arms before, he was only noticing it now.</p>

  <p>"What's this sclerite?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's spiritual sense swept over this sclerite but he couldn't recognize it.</p>

  <p>After pondering over it for a while, he still couldn't figure out what it was. Was it possible that everyone who could form the Nine Li Wild Body would have this sclerite?</p>

  <p>Finally, he made the Wild God Power dissipate. Once his body had shrunk back to its normal size, he flew over to the old man.</p>

  <p>"How are you feeling now?" the old man asked.</p>

  <p>"Very good," Luo Zheng said with a genuine smile. "It's just that the process of the Body Tribulations put me in so much pain that I almost died.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the Body Tribulations were a bit different from how you explained them. After the five tribulations, why did they occur once more?"</p>

  <p>Before Luo Zheng had gone into the cave, Giacomo had explained to him in detail the precautions that he would have to take to undergo the Body Tribulations.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had done as he was told and survived the first five Body Tribulations. However, he had been totally unprepared for the process to repeat again.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, the old man looked at Luo Zheng with a complicated expression.</p>

  <p>"It seems that you don't know..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng indeed did not know that his body had been infused with the blood of the Chaos Ancient God. "Don't know what?"</p>

  <p>"When you were undergoing the Body Tribulations, you might have been infused with another bloodline," the old man explained.</p>

  <p>"Another bloodline?" Luo Zheng looked down at his body, but he didn't feel like anything was unusual. "But I don't feel like anything's changed."</p>

  <p>The old man studied Luo Zheng's appearance closely, but he didn't see anything strange either.</p>

  <p>It was true that the bone marrow of the Chaos Ancient God was present in the Cave of Wildness. But as for how one would be different after infusing the Chaos Ancient God's bloodline, even the old man, who had wide knowledge, could not tell. What was more, it was only his deduction that Luo Zheng's blood had fused with the Chaos Ancient God's.</p>

  <p>"You just finished the Body Tribulations, and need more consolidation.</p>

  <p>Let's talk about it later."</p>

  <p>Soon, the news of Luo Zheng's resurgence spread throughout the whole Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>The exiles were overjoyed. Adele once again arranged for Elsa and a few others to cultivate in preparation for the battle with the Yellow Emperor race.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng constantly absorbed Wild God Power in the following three months.</p>

  <p>In addition to cultivating the Wild God system, Luo Zheng was also paying close attention to his inner world.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng had gone to see his mother, she had injected a large number of Spiritual Darknesses into his inner world.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had used most of them to strengthen his own Godly Tile, but there was still a considerable number of Spiritual Darknesses left.</p>

  <p>These Spiritual Darknesses were like mice that lived in the underground in Luo Zheng's inner world.</p>

  <p>As long as the Spiritual Darknesses didn't touch the chaotic sea, they wouldn't be gasified. They began to split and reproduce, and increased steadily in number.</p>

  <p>Every once in a while, Luo Zheng drove these Spiritual Darknesses into the chaotic sea and made them turn into brown mist to strengthen his own Godly Tile. By doing this repeatedly, his cultivation improved day by day.</p>

  <p>In this period of time, the old man occasionally came to the cultivating place to visit Luo Zheng. Every time he came, he asked Luo Zheng if he had noticed any special changes in his body.</p>

  <p>And every time, Luo Zheng gave him a negative answer, though he was confused as to why the old man kept asking him this question.</p>

  <p>The only thing that he found slightly strange was the sclerite in his chest.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng absorbed the Wild God Power, this small diamond-shaped sclerite always guided most of the Wild God Power toward itself.</p>

  <p>However, when Luo Zheng took a look inside the sclerite, he didn't find anything strange, so he just didn't take it seriously and ignored it.</p>

  <p>Three months flew by.</p>

  <p>It was finally time. Hundreds of Nine Li members swarmed out of the bottom of the bone tower.</p>

  <p>"Elsa, Luo Zheng, Romeo, Monty, Yeoman? the five of you, come with me,"</p>

  <p>Adele said flatly.</p>

  <p>In front of Adele, there was a huge bone ship.</p>

  <p>In this world, most materials were unusually rare. Bone, however, was almost inexhaustible. Bones never decayed even after countless years.</p>

  <p>They were also very tough and naturally suited for crafting certain things. For example, this huge ship, which was over ten thousand feet long, was built completely out of bone.</p>

  <p>"Finally, this day has come," said Elsa with a smile. Then, she floated over to the bone ship.</p>

  <p>Without a word, Luo Zheng, Romeo, and the others also jumped onto the bone ship.</p>

  <p>In addition, several elders also set off with them for the war.</p>

  <p>Now, there was no need for these elders to protect the bone tower of the Nine Li race. After all, as long as the exiles stayed in the bone tower, the other races wouldn't dare to attack it.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Ramzi, who was a little worried about Luo Zheng's safety, had hoped that one of the exiles could accompany him.</p>

  <p>However, Ramzi's suggestion had been rejected by the Grand Elder.</p>

  <p>After all, the disputes between the Nine Li race and the Yellow Emperor race were disputes of the descendants of the two parties; they had nothing to do with the exiles. If the exiles got involved, the situation would change, and it would most likely sow further discord between the Nine Li race and the Yellow Emperor race.</p>

  <p>Anyway, the exiles were all powerful warriors at the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>If there really was any danger, they could leave the bone tower and use Grand Teleportation to get there in an instant.</p>

  <p>Crack...</p>

  <p>The body of the huge bone ship creaked slightly before rising into the air and heading south.</p>

  <p>Elsa, who was standing on the deck, sized Luo Zheng up with her beautiful eyes. Then, she asked with a smile, "Your name is Luo Zheng, right?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded slightly.</p>

  <p>"I'm Elsa!" Then, she continued, "I heard that you died in the Cave of Wildness. How did you come back to life?"</p>

  <p>"Elsa, what are you saying?!" Romeo, who was standing next to her, was flabbergasted. Then, turning to Luo Zheng, he quickly explained, "Luo Zheng, please don't mind. This is just how Elsa is."</p>
