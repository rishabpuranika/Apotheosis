  <p>
</p>

  <p>The miserable death which Herbert had suffered was still lingering on everyone's mind. Trapped and unable to escape, Gerald was obviously about to end up the same.</p>

  <p>Fuxi, the Snake Goddess and Judson were becoming anxious now.</p>

  <p>"Come on! Let's destroy this light column!"</p>

  <p>"How? It's not going to be so easy to destroy it."</p>

  <p>"We have to try! I'm afraid that Gerald won't be able to hold on for any more than thirty seconds."</p>

  <p>Although they knew that the light column was almost completely invulnerable, they still had to try. Therefore, they launched their attacks in unison, trying to destroy the light column that had trapped Gerald.</p>

  <p>Even under their attacks, the pressure in the light column increased sharply, and the hard shell on the surface of Gerald's body began to emit cracking sounds. Countless cracks spread out, like lines of minuscule bugs crawling over his body.</p>

  <p>Gerald himself also knew how powerful the light column was. Trapped inside, he had to try and make an effort to save himself since no one else could do so.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>A green colored light began to leak out from the cracks.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven felt the strong life energy that was contained within the light column with a look of contempt on his face.</p>

  <p>Gerald was a Chaos Ancient God who had mastered the truth of life.</p>

  <p>However, it was impossible for him to use that power to repair his body.</p>

  <p>"Huh! Don't try to struggle. It is useless," the Grandmaster of Heaven sneered. And as soon as his words finished, the squeezing force in the light column doubled suddenly.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>With a wispy, cracking sound, Gerald's shell was suddenly broken completely. Under the irresistible pressure, the tissues in his body began to bleed profusely, and his huge and fragile compound eyes exploded outside.</p>

  <p>However, the truth power surrounding him did not try to repair his body. It could not. Instead, it was transforming his body.</p>

  <p>The truth was, even if it did try, it was useless to repair the broken shell.</p>

  <p>The shell was just a broken defense mechanism. It was not suitable for such a high pressure environment.</p>

  <p>The truth power was instead growing a thin layer of tissue over the hard shell. The tissue was flat and weirdly thin, as if it were made of countless pieces of paper.</p>

  <p>This was the only visible change on the surface of Gerald's body. At the same time, several more changes were taking place inside him.</p>

  <p>The squeezed body tissue was quickly being transformed by the truth power. Gerald's height was being reduced constantly. Finally, he became completely flat. In fact, that was what he wanted to do.</p>

  <p>In a short while, the originally scorpion shaped Gerald had turned into a thin pie.</p>

  <p>This was a highly powerful move. Some fishes in the deep sea had to bear intense sea water pressure all year round, which had evolved their bodies into flat shapes. However, they needed millions of years to evolve, but Gerald had done this in an instant.</p>

  <p>A green light flickered on the side of his flat body, and a pair of slender eyes grew to observe everything around him.</p>

  <p>"What the hell?"</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven was confused now.</p>

  <p>Herbert had also been crushed into a meat pie just now, and therefore the Grandmaster of Heaven hadn't paid much attention to the change in Gerald's body. But the strong life energy that had leaked out could not repair Gerald's body, which had surprised him a bit.</p>

  <p>Maybe the repair speed was not as fast as the squeezing speed. Therefore, he had not thought much about it. And yet, after a few seconds, Gerald still had a lot of life energy left and there wasn't much damage to him.</p>

  <p>When the Grandmaster of Heaven realized what had happened, he sneered,</p>

  <p>"Your desire to survive is strong. In this form, your pressure bearing ability has increased by at least six times. But that is still in vain!"</p>

  <p>Once he had finished speaking, his palm emitted a strong white light.</p>

  <p>From the way he was utilizing his strength, the power of the foundation seemed to be inexhaustible. The squeezing force in the light column continued to increase even now.</p>

  <p>"Goo Goo..."</p>

  <p>Still being squeezed continuously, Gerald's body became more and more flat, and his slender eyes revealed a sad expression. Since the pressure was explosively increasing even now, it was going to be difficult for him to resist for too long.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>Outside the light column, Judson, Fuxi and the Snake Goddess were still attacking it with all kinds of methods and moves, but the outer wall of the light column was still totally intact.</p>

  <p>"Where is Zheng?"</p>

  <p>Judson cried among the battle. He was placing his hope on Zheng.</p>

  <p>Just now, after Zheng had dodged the sword strike of the Grandmaster of Heaven, he seemed to have disappeared.</p>

  <p>Even Judson didn't know his whereabouts since he had the power to teleport himself anywhere and everywhere without a trace.</p>

  <p>At Judson's words, a thin thread suddenly appeared in the void. And out of nowhere, Zheng appeared.</p>

  <p>And when he was finally visible, they saw that his entire body had changed greatly.</p>

  <p>In addition to the terrifying and strange head he had already developed, his limbs had turned into over a hundred tentacles, which were covered with over ten thousand circular suckers.</p>

  <p>Now, Zheng no longer resembled a human from any angle. Instead, he looked like an octopus.</p>

  <p>The moment he appeared, he placed his limbs on the light column, and the suckers began absorbing the Great Sanskrit Light without a moment's hesitation.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Black patches quickly appeared on the surface of the originally indestructible light column. As the light column became more and more fragile through Zheng's sucking, Zheng pulled at it hard.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>The light column suddenly collapsed like a large structure made of water, and the pressure inside was instantly released. Gerald's pie-like body fell down rapidly like a heavy hammer.</p>

  <p>After escaping death, Gerald regained his life energy once again. His body tissue, outer defensive shell, and even his tail, which had disappeared, recovered at a speed visible to the naked eye.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven looked at the octopus-like Zheng with a cold expression in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Previously, it had taken Zheng a long time to break the light column, but now, he was powerful enough to easily break the column. This was after he had disappeared for just a little while.</p>

  <p>Such a speed of growth in strength was unimaginable. Zheng was omnipotent now!</p>

  <p>An opponent with power of this magnitude was going to be extremely tricky to deal with.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Dragging over a hundred tentacles around him, Zheng suddenly disappeared once more, turning into a thin line and rushing towards the Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven felt threatened at this sight. If he were to be trapped by Zheng's tentacles, his Sanskrit Light Body would be absorbed soon and he would be dead.</p>

  <p>As he retreated rapidly, a blue light flashed in his eyes. Once he had located Zheng, he reached out his hand and grabbed at something in the air. With a buzzing sound, a light column materialized and covered Zheng.</p>

  <p>As Zheng's tentacles absorbed the wall of the light column for a while, the wall was broken down once again. The light column was able to hinder Zheng for just a single second.</p>

  <p>However, the Grandmaster of Heaven didn't have any other way to deal with Zheng as of now. Therefore, as soon as the light column was broken, he summoned yet another one. The light columns kept on materializing one after another and this bought him some time.</p>

  <p>Splash! Splash! Splash!</p>

  <p>All the light columns were broken by Zheng.</p>

  <p>If one observed carefully, the suckers on his tentacles were subtly changing shape during the whole process.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, the suckers had been circular, but now they had slowly evolved into a diamond-shaped structure. That way, they could absorb the Great Sanskrit Light much more efficiently. The speed at which they could break the light columns was increasing with every strike, which left the Grandmaster of Heaven flabbergasted.</p>

  <p>Gerald, who was quickly repairing his body, along with Judson, Fuxi, and the Snake Goddess quietly watched the scene unfold before their eyes, without any intention of interfering. They knew their presence wouldn't make much of a difference in this battle.</p>

  <p>What confused the Grandmaster of Heaven was that after breaking the light columns, Zheng could have just moved forward to attack him. If he were caught by Zheng's tentacles, he would definitely die.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng was pressing forward very slowly. What was he up to?</p>

  <p>While the Grandmaster of Heaven was lost in thought and trying to understand what was going on, a thin line was floating in the void behind him.</p>

  <p>When he finally approached the thin line unwittingly, a mass of tentacles appeared out of nowhere and swallowed him.</p>
