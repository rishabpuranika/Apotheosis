  <p>
</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng stopped in midair, the Demi-holy Beings and consummate True Gods watching him began to feel a little nervous.</p>

  <p>Just now, Luo Zheng's movements had been so fast and strange that they hadn't been able to observe him clearly. Now that he was staying still, however, they noticed the dramatic change in him.</p>

  <p>His aura seemed to be completely different now.</p>

  <p>Although it was gentle, it also seemed to be almighty, as if Luo Zheng was the ruler of the world. The Demi-holy Beings and consummate True Gods suddenly had an urge to bow or even kneel to him.</p>

  <p>Anyone who could cultivate enough to become a consummate True God or a Demi-holy Being was considered a top talent in the divine land. All of the people here fighting over the holy springs had the ambition and desire to break through to be a Holy Being. For this, they would even risk their lives.</p>

  <p>They would indeed feel awe in the presence of a Holy Being or a warrior at the Other Shore Realm, but they might not submit to them easily.</p>

  <p>However, the moment they saw Luo Zheng, they felt an involuntary urge to submit to him. It was so irrational that it took them by shock.</p>

  <p>"You say I came back to occupy a holy spring?" Luo Zheng laughed. Then, he stretched out his hand and waved it, causing the entire area to tremble.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Under everyone's gaze, silver holy springs spurted from the plain one after another.</p>

  <p>Soon, there were more than a hundred holy springs in front of them! These holy springs were arranged in a ring, like a magnificent fountain.</p>

  <p>"What? Am I daydreaming?"</p>

  <p>"So many holy springs!"</p>

  <p>"Does this mean every one of us can become a Holy Being?"</p>

  <p>The eyes of these Demi-holy Beings and consummate True Gods nearly popped out in surprise.</p>

  <p>Never in their wildest dreams could they have imagined that Luo Zheng could create so many holy springs with just a wave of his hand. How had Luo Zheng done it?</p>

  <p>But regardless of how confused or curious they were, they were much more eager to go ahead and occupy one of the several holy springs.</p>

  <p>"We don't have to fight with each other anymore! Ha-ha, I can also become a Holy Being."</p>

  <p>"I can do it too!"</p>

  <p>"There are more than enough holy springs for all of us."</p>

  <p>The truth was, none of these people actually wanted to fight with each other. It was just that the scarcity of the holy springs had pitted them against each other. At least this time, five holy springs had appeared, so the chances of them becoming Holy Beings had been relatively larger than in the past, when only one holy spring would appear. Back then, the competition had been much more fierce.</p>

  <p>But now that so many holy springs had appeared, there was no need for competition at all.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Just as they all began to rush toward the holy springs, Luo Zheng waved his hand once again.</p>

  <p>The holy springs withdrew into the ground just as quickly as they had appeared.</p>

  <p>Everyone stopped in their tracks and turned to Luo Zheng, feeling like they had been given candies only to have them snatched back. They had no idea what was going on or what to say, but they all looked at Luo Zheng with pleading eyes.</p>

  <p>"From now on, I will change the rules of the Mountain of Holy Beings,"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng announced calmly.</p>

  <p>Then, he flew away toward the remote valley.</p>

  <p>Everyone watched him in silence until his figure finally disappeared out of sight.</p>

  <p>"What happened to Luo Zheng?"</p>

  <p>"How can he change the rules of the Mountain of Holy Beings?"</p>

  <p>"You saw what he did with the holy springs! I wonder what he's obtained from the Mountain of Holy Beings."</p>

  <p>They were so shocked that they even forgot to fight over the remaining three holy springs.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Yellow Emperor Guards were busy taking care of a few things.</p>

  <p>Even though Samuel's attempt to use Pascal to kill Luo Zheng had failed, the Yellow Emperor Guards still had some use for him. Samuel could use all his divine might coins to write a rule on the Ruling Slate.</p>

  <p>Leyton had originally intended to use this rule to deal with the Nine Li Guards outside the divine land.</p>

  <p>However, since Clement was here, he and his people could kill the Nine Li Guards; Leyton didn't need this rule to deal with them anymore. Instead, he decided to make Samuel write a rule targeting Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He couldn't predict the consequences of Luo Zheng's entry into the Mountain of Holy Beings, so he had to make sure that Luo Zheng would die. Thus, he ordered Samuel to write an extremely strict rule to deal with Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The harsher the rule, the more divine might coins it would consume.</p>

  <p>However, Samuel had plenty of divine might coins in his possession.</p>

  <p>Except for a small number of divine might coins which he couldn't summon here because of the distance, most of the divine might coins in the divine land had been brought to the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>Samuel melted all these coins into ink and wrote down a rule to kill Luo Zheng on the Ruling Slate.</p>

  <p>However, he soon ran into a complication. He had wanted Luo Zheng to perish in the Mountain of Holy Beings, but it was not until he began writing that he found that the rules on the Ruling Slate couldn't involve the Mountain of Holy Beings. Any rule involving the Mountain of Holy Beings would disappear from the Ruling Slate as soon as it was written.</p>

  <p>In a fit of desperation, Samuel wrote the next best thing he could come up with. "As long as Luo Zheng steps into the divine land..." he began to write.</p>

  <p>This was no longer a rule, but a curse.</p>

  <p>If such a curse was aimed at a group, it would cost a huge number of divine might coins, perhaps more than the number of divine might coins that actually existed in the divine land. In that case, Samuel might not even be able to write a single word. After all, such a rule would destroy the balance of the entire divine land. Perhaps Chiyou had carefully designed the Ruling Slate with this in mind.</p>

  <p>However, since Samuel's rule was aimed at Luo Zheng alone, the number of divine might coins required was just barely within the range of acceptance. He had to use up almost all of the divine might coins that the Han Clan had robbed recently to vaguely write down this rule.</p>

  <p>After that, all they could do was wait. The moment Luo Zheng left the Mountain of Holy Beings, he would be killed by this rule, and then they would have no more worries.</p>

  <p>Clement and his people had already gone to the outside of the divine land, and no one in the divine land could contend with them anymore. Everything was developing for the better.</p>

  <p>The other Yellow Emperor Guards did not remain above the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>Before Luo Zheng and the other two entered the Mountain of Holy Beings, Estelle had given them her support. She had silenced the whole divine land so that the three of them could enter the Mountain of Holy Beings. However, at the last moment, Leyton had used the Sea Cracking Skull to break Estelle's Scepter of Gods' Silence.</p>

  <p>Enraged by the incident, Leyton had ordered Zavier and Salim to hunt Estelle down.</p>

  <p>Every time Estelle used the Scepter of Gods' Silence, powerful energy waves would be generated, and then they would quickly dissipate.</p>

  <p>However, the traces that they left behind would linger for a long time. Such traces would go unnoticed by normal warriors, but they didn't escape Salim's eyes.</p>

  <p>In addition, Salim was also able to find out her whereabouts through the space fluctuations produced when she used the Grand Teleportation. Thus, Salim and Zavier followed the space fluctuations all the way.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, Estelle and Holy Jay were as careful as they could be.</p>

  <p>Ever since Luo Zheng successfully entered the Mountain of Holy Beings, Estelle and Holy Jay had used the Grand Teleportation more than a hundred times until they finally stopped in a small remote place, where they believed they would be safe.</p>

  <p>Of course, leaving the divine land altogether would have been much safer, but they wanted to stay behind to observe whether Luo Zheng succeeded or not.</p>

  <p>"Two universes shook, indicating that two of them have succeeded in becoming Holy Beings. But only two. Do you think something has gone wrong?" Estelle speculated.</p>

  <p>Holy Jay had made the same observation, but he still said, "The competition in the Mountain of Holy Beings won't end so soon. It's useless for us to speculate about it. Let's just wait and see."</p>

  <p>Just then, a space crack opened above this small town, and Zavier and Salim jumped out of it. They found Estelle and Holy Jay!</p>
