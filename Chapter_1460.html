<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The warrior lost control of his faculties as the Snow Demon took over his body like a string puppet.</p>

  <p>Although the human warrior was at the Spirit Supreme Realm, the Snow Demon who occupied his body probably couldn't even unleash at least ten percent of his strength.</p>

  <p>Xun had previously given a firm order, and Luo Zheng didn't hesitate to comply. After the Snow Demon had occupied the human warrior, he could no longer be considered human.</p>

  <p>His legs turned to jelly as he swayed and grasped the long sword with some difficulty, He wanted to resist those three Nether God Shadows, but the Snow Demon couldn't even draw out his life vitality. How could he resist then?</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the warrior's body dropped dead, courtesy of the three Nether God Shadows.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng was finished with the warrior, he once again focused on Freya.</p>

  <p>While Xun wasn't worried, Luo Zheng still checked up on Freya just in case. After all, being possessed by a Snow Demon was equivalent to death. One couldn't blame Luo Zheng for being worried that Freya wouldn't get to escape from the Snow Demon's illusion.</p>

  <p>But just as he turned his head, he saw a blast of cold energy which suddenly burst out from between Freya's fingers. A stream of blood from her fingertip immediately followed.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, her body twitched and her eyes opened. Her lids fluttered to reveal a gaze as clear as water. When she saw Luo Zheng looking at her concernedly, she smiled and said, "I'm fine."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng couldn't help but be surprised as he eyed Freya's wounded finger with confusion. "What's this?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Just now, I was afraid that the Snow Demon would bewitch me, so I formed an ice spike using my life vitality. Then I held onto it. If I didn't melt the ice spike within five minutes, it would explode," Freya explained.</p>

  <p>It was known that the Snow Demon could build an illusionary land for warriors where they could immerse themselves in wonderful dreams, and then used this opportunity to devour their souls and occupy their bodies.</p>

  <p>However, Freya's little trick had worked. The moment she felt the pain, she would have a chance to break out of the Snow Demon's illusion.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng couldn't help but admire her. He realized that even though Freya wasn't particularly strong, she was quite intelligent. She knew how to make use of small tricks, and those tricks could prove significant in critical moments.</p>

  <p>At that point, more and more warriors regained their consciousness.</p>

  <p>While the Snow Demon was fierce, the warriors who had already come this far had strong warrior spirits, which meant that they could shake off the illusion anytime soon.</p>

  <p>Most of the warriors still struggled to get out of the Snow Demon's illusion, but a few of them unfortunately lost themselves and were possessed by the Snow Demons. Thus, the other unaffected warriors had no choice but to kill them.</p>

  <p>Some warriors didn't maintain the correct falling position. As a result, their bodies floated towards the edge of the abyss and smashed into the ice spikes on the wall while they were in illusion. Some of them ended up with broken heads and bloody, wounded bodies. Some of them were seriously injured and had no choice but to activate the divine texture to leave the Endless Abyss. It was unlucky of them to have failed because based from past experiences, there was a reward after breaking out of the Snow Demon's illusion.</p>

  <p>Sure enough, another stone platform stuck out from the wall of the abyss not long after.</p>

  <p>The remaining warriors' faces lit up when they saw the stone platform.</p>

  <p>Everyone had tried their best to stay and descend from the abyss. Their goal was to reach that kind of stone platform.</p>

  <p>However, this stone platform was slightly different compared to the previous one. It was wrapped entirely in a thick layer of ice. Luo Zheng adjusted his position and landed on the stone platform.</p>

  <p>His landing's momentum could crush even a hundred-foot-thick layer of ice into pieces, but there was only a slight sound when Luo Zheng stepped on it.</p>

  <p>The three-inch-thick layer of ice that enveloped the stone platform didn't even have a single footprint on it. It turned out that the Supreme Lord from remote ages had used a special method on the ice.</p>

  <p>After a while, the other warriors all landed on the stone platform.</p>

  <p>However, no one expected for something tragic to suddenly happen. Ab, who had followed Lincoln in the underground palace, also adjusted his position after he found the stone platform. But he never thought that he'd slip on the ice platform and down to the abyss. "Aaaaaargh!" he cried out.</p>

  <p>"What bad luck!" Zheng's gaze remained frozen on where Ab had stood.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Lincoln, who stood beside Luo Zheng, just laughed and said, "Ha-ha! I can only wish him good luck." Lincoln didn't really have a good impression of the seven Hou brothers. He thought that it would be best if Ab died. Even if he didn't, Lincoln might not let him go when they left the underground palace.</p>

  <p>Ab had directly entered the third cycle of the Endless Abyss. As for whether he could go through the third cycle alone, or chose to activate the divine texture to leave the Endless Abyss, it all depended on him.</p>

  <p>The rest of the crowd stood on the stone platform; none of them would pay attention to such a person. They advanced towards the cave behind the stone platform. They ran so fast as if they were all fighting for it.</p>

  <p>But, it was for a good reason� the cave contained some rather impressive treasures. The items in the second cave were all quite unique.</p>

  <p>Thus, all the warriors were filled with anticipation.</p>

  <p>"What's in the second cave?" Luo Zheng asked Xun. His eyes travelled to the warriors' anxious faces and he couldn't help but shake his head.</p>

  <p>"Ancient treasures," Xun said simply. "Various ancient treasures left behind by the Supreme Lord."</p>

  <p>"Ancient treasures? Wow! I'm looking forward to them."</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! You will be disappointed. They're useless. A hundred thousand years ago, I entered, looked around, and just left," Xun replied.</p>

  <p>Not even divine weapons were spared from the erosion of time if left untreated. Their strength gradually weakened as time went by. No one knew just how many million years had passed since the Supreme Lord had built the Endless Abyss. Even if the ancient treasures he had left behind had been impressive in the past, it was likely that they had lost their effect by now.</p>

  <p>The warriors stood in a row once they reached the cave. Then, a treasure mountain appeared in front of them.</p>

  <p>Swords, halberds, spears, sabers, hammers, bows, axes...</p>

  <p>There were all sorts of weapons, but everyone looked at them in pain.</p>

  <p>These weapons were basically divine weapons back then. After they underwent countless years of erosion, they were nothing more than a pile of scrap metal now.</p>

  <p>Although these weapons were not rusty or damaged, they were all greyish-white in color and no longer possessed their original luster.</p>

  <p>Even most of the Spirit Supreme Realm warriors in the three major sacred places in the Dark World only had secondary third-rank divine weapons. Third-rank and secondary second-rank divine weapons were extremely rare. The ancient treasures were at least second-rank divine weapons. There were even first-rank and secondary first-rank ones among them.</p>

  <p>However, they had lost their heavenly essence as time went by. The divine textures carved on them were also incomplete. After all, their materials had a time limit once the divine textures had been inscribed on them. Some extraordinary divine weapons might be able to stay the same after a million years, but after hundreds of millions of years, they too weren't spared from the corrosion of time. In fact, all of them weren't even considered "ancient treasures" now.</p>

  <p>No wonder Xun had left the cave after she looked around.</p>

  <p>However, some warriors weren't willing to leave empty-handed. Perhaps they would not be able to make it to the next cave, and weapons were what they needed the most. After a moment of hesitation, they soon dug through the treasures, in hopes of finding something special.</p>

  <p>Many of the warriors rummaged through the mountain pile of various weapons, and picked one weapon after another.</p>

  <p>Once they were satisfied, they placed the weapons into their space rings, even if they knew that the weapons were all just scrap metal. Although the ancient treasures had lost their magic and weren't worth much, they still had a certain collection value. But of course, their collection value was also low.</p>

  <p>Freya blinked, and joined in the search as well.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Luo Zheng did not join them. It wasn't that he looked down on such things, but he still had a little doubt.</p>

  <p>Were these ancient treasures really the Supreme Lord's inheritance?</p>

  <p>From the looks of it, something wasn't right. The Supreme Lord had meticulously planned out the Endless Abyss, and then spent a lot of effort spreading the keys and methods that could open the underground palace throughout the entire universe. He would've foreseen that the weapons he had left behind would definitely become a pile of junk after hundreds of millions of years.</p>

  <p>However, the Supreme Lord still did it despite knowing that it was the case. After Luo Zheng thought about it for a while, he felt that there was something fishy going on.</p>
