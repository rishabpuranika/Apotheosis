<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Emily was already exhausted and reached her limit.</p>

  <p>She started losing her strength because of the excessive loss of blood, and her face paled just like a piece of paper.</p>

  <p>She felt like she was at the gate of death, and her spirit would leave her any time now.</p>

  <p>She had no recollection at all about what had happened. She only knew that this time, she had to rely on her remaining willpower to hold on.</p>

  <p>In the midst of her struggle, the orange light suddenly shot into her body.</p>

  <p>Her originally suppressed cultivation was quickly restored.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the almost exhausted power of life was powered up and became full!</p>

  <p>Her weakened body had been instantly energized exponentially as her haggard breath had recovered.</p>

  <p>She didn't need to use any token. She could recover in a short period of time by just depending on her powerful physical body and blood.</p>

  <p>The dagger, which was stabbed on her chest, drew itself out of the wound under the wriggling of her muscles.</p>

  <p>The wound was then completely healed without a scar, leaving only a flawless skin.</p>

  <p>At the same time Emily began to recover, the other severely injured exiles had also been healed.</p>

  <p>Powerful auras spread out and pervaded the space.</p>

  <p>The black robed men of the Warden race were not excluded and had also restored their own cultivation.</p>

  <p>Of all the members of their race, no one had ever reached the Other Shore Realm. As a result, compared to Emily and the other exiles, their auras were comparably small.</p>

  <p>The surroundings were still. Emily and the rest did not make a move.</p>

  <p>Everyone turned their gazes to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>An extremely powerful monster was standing beside him.</p>

  <p>The tomb keeper could get rid of the power of the Strength Equalizing token by himself. With just a single slap, he could easily kill Spark of the Yellow Emperor race.</p>

  <p>Both Emily and Timotheus were in awe looking at such a powerful man.</p>

  <p>If by chance, the tomb keeper would fight along the Warden race's side, they would surely have no chance of survival at all.</p>

  <p>But at the thought, Emily didn't feel anxious. The tomb keeper was obviously not, in a chance, under the control of the Warden race.</p>

  <p>His power alone could defeat all the exiles. It just showed that the Warden race didn't have a hold on him. If the Warden race could really order him around, then they wouldn't need to activate the Strength Equalizing token.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, who was no longer suppressed by the Strength Equalizing token, slowly stood up from the ground.</p>

  <p>When the tomb keeper displayed such powerful strength, the battle between them and the tomb keeper seemed to be of no importance.</p>

  <p>After everyone's normal condition had been restored, they waited for the instructions of the tomb keeper.</p>

  <p>"Click! Click!"</p>

  <p>The head of the Warden race threw away his walking stick and quickly walked up to the tomb keeper, making a bow with his hands clasped.</p>

  <p>The scene of the tomb keeper's act just now greatly shocked the Warden race.</p>

  <p>"Our race has been your neighbor for so many years. Please drive these exiles away for the sake of our master!"</p>

  <p>The head of the Warden race knew in his heart that the tomb keeper would be a bigger help as the last life-saving straw for their race.</p>

  <p>Hearing his words, Emily and the rest of the exiles were stunned.</p>

  <p>Once the tomb keeper was persuaded to join hands with the Warden race, they would surely lose everything.</p>

  <p>"Sir, I was the leader of the Rose Sect in the Li Shan mountain, and I'm not willing to be imprisoned here. If I can return to the Li Shan mountain, I will remember the favor," Emily interjected and said.</p>

  <p>The tomb keeper looked at Emily and spoke in a cold voice, "You are from the Li Shan mountain? Hahaha..."</p>

  <p>His weird laughter made Emily's blood freeze.</p>

  <p>The crowd that just heard his words and laughter stood still and felt nervous.</p>

  <p>In the Source World, There were countless powerful masters.</p>

  <p>Since the ancient times, a lot of people had been born with indescribable talents. Due to this, powerful forces had been established.</p>

  <p>Among the powerful forces that had been established was the Snake Goddess race, which was one of the strongest races in the Source World.</p>

  <p>If the tomb keeper had a grudge against the Snake Goddess race, Emily's words might have an adverse effect.</p>

  <p>She certainly knew how to weigh the pros and cons.</p>

  <p>But the tomb keeper had helped the Warden race after the Strength Equalizing token was activated.</p>

  <p>And if he agreed to help the Warden race this time, they might have no chance to survive being on the losing end.</p>

  <p>The tomb keeper had stared at Emily for a while, and his face slowly darkened. It was as if some unforgettable memories had been stirred up and haunted him. He uttered, "Not to mention that you're just an insignificant sect leader of the Li Shan mountain, even if the Snake Goddess feels grateful to me, I, as her brother, will not accept!"</p>

  <p>"Brother?"</p>

  <p>Did the Snake Goddess have a brother? Luo Zheng's expression turned strange as he heard the tomb keeper's words.</p>

  <p>Not just Luo Zheng, but Emily, Timotheus and other exiles were once again given a start by the sudden revelation.</p>

  <p>It had never occurred to them that they would meet the Snake Goddess's brother in this place.</p>

  <p>Emily stared in disbelief at the tomb keeper and stammered, "You... You are the Human Sovereign, Fuxi*!"</p>

  <p>(*TN: Fuxi is a culture hero in Chinese legend and mythology.) The existence of the Human Sovereign Fuxi in the Source World was extraordinary, and he held a high position. Every exile was aware and had heard of his name.</p>

  <p>The tomb keeper snorted and acquiesced in Emily's guess.</p>

  <p>"Master Fuxi, the Snake Goddess has been depressed since your disappearance. We have never seen her smile over the past countless years. I didn't expect that you were trapped, no stayed, here," Emily humbly said.</p>

  <p>This prison had served as a trap for the exiled but it was not the same case for the tomb keeper. For her, Fuxi couldn't be trapped in this place.</p>

  <p>A glimmer of light showed in Fuxi's eyes as he asked, "Really?"</p>

  <p>"Of course. Before I was exiled, we held a party in the Li Shan mountain but the Snake Goddess didn't appear. It was said that it was also because of you," Emily responded.</p>

  <p>As the leader of the Rose Sect, Emily enjoyed a high position in the Li Shan mountain, so she knew some secrets.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess and Fuxi were originally brother and sister, but later they became husband and wife.</p>

  <p>But for some unknown reason, Fuxi suddenly left in anger and eventually disappeared from the Source World.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess had tried her means to look for him, but failed several times.</p>

  <p>Unbeknownst to everyone, he had already left the Source World and hid at the bottom of the chaos, stayed and never went out for so many years.</p>

  <p>Fuxi heard Emily's words and had a complex expression on his face. He let out a long sigh.</p>

  <p>He, after all, still cared about his sister.</p>

  <p>He looked back at the head of the Warden race and said, "As I told you, this world is a failure, and Herbert has abandoned it. I helped you as we agreed. You have lost. Let them go, and I will protect your race."</p>

  <p>The head of the Warden race already knew that Fuxi could not be on their side as he listened to his conversation with Emily. It was a great honor that he was still willing to protect their race. The head had no other choice but to accept.</p>

  <p>Fuxi, after speaking his statement, swiftly grabbed Luo Zheng and ordered,</p>

  <p>"Follow me!" Immediately after, he and Luo Zheng flew backwards.</p>

  <p>Seeing this scene, Timotheus panicked and shouted, "Master Fuxi..."</p>

  <p>But Fuxi just ignored him. In the blink of an eye, the two disappeared from everyone's sight.</p>

  <p>Emily saw how anxious Timotheus was and comforted him, "Don't worry. Luo Zheng will be fine."</p>

  <p>Fuxi's intention on taking Luo Zheng away was still unclear, but she knew that he had no reason to harm him.</p>

  <p>She shrugged the thought aside and kept her focus on what was important at this moment. Now that they had already won the battle, it was time to cut off the Curse Chains on their bodies.</p>
