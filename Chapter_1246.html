<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1246 Activate The Tower Of Crystal </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The entire grand era had been initiated by the Heavenly Law. Because of that, the Heavenly Law knew the fate of everyone living in the worlds like the back of its hand.</p>

  <p>It also meant that it was in control of everything— how and when a person would come into and leave the world, when would he or she laugh, when would he or she cry...</p>

  <p>However, there would always be accidents that would create exceptions from this rule. Throughout time, there were people who had fates that were not under the control of the Heavenly Law.</p>

  <p>In other words, the Heavenly Law could not calculate and foresee when and how these people would be born, and it had no idea how their fates would play out in the future.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked extremely stunned. Even the cyan dragon in his mind was caught off-guard, and couldn't do anything but sigh. "Alas! I never thought that I would ever feel inferior to this human girl. Luo Zheng, even the Heavenly Law doesn't know anything about your future."</p>

  <p>Yolande slowly stood up and said, "That's why I hadn't tried to change Zheng's mind when he appeared and obtained the golden title of Celestial Position. As for you, people from the Celestial Position race, if you decided to persuade Luo Zheng to join you, I will not intervene. However, you cannot do anything to Klein, who just obtained the silver title of Asura."</p>

  <p>The seven members of the Celestial Position race were all silent. In their eyes, Luo Zheng had already become an anomaly.</p>

  <p>Max turned to look at Luo Zheng and asked, "Are you willing to join our Celestial Position race?" He believed that regardless of whether the Heavenly Law could tell Zheng's fate or not, since Luo Zheng had the golden title of Celestial Position, they could not afford to let him go. If they did, the Celestial Position's upper echelons would find out, and it would mean a huge trouble for all of them.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng thought for a moment, his thick brows furrowed. He then smiled and said, "I don't seem to have any other choice."</p>

  <p>Woody sneered, "It seems like you have a clear estimation of yourself and your abilities."</p>

  <p>"Well, no one could see through my fate," Luo Zheng replied, smiling. "Joining the Celestial Position race doesn't sound like a bad thing, but I have a request." With that, the expression on his face suddenly changed.</p>

  <p>"What request?" Max asked.</p>

  <p>"I need you to keep the Tower of Crystal on the Sea God Continent for 500 years."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had his mind made up since the very beginning. The tower was extremely important to the many races that resided on the Sea God Continent, especially the humans and the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>Even though the threat from the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place would probably disappear in the near future, the Purple Heart Sacred Place hadn't fully developed yet. If he let the Celestial Position members take away the tower, it wouldn't affect the Demon Night much, but for the Purple Heart Sacred Place, it would still be a big problem.</p>

  <p>"500 years?" Max repeated, pondering for a moment.</p>

  <p>No matter how they looked at it, the deal was extremely worthwhile.</p>

  <p>They could easily convince Luo Zheng to join the Celestial Position race without having to spend too much effort if they agreed with it.</p>

  <p>Delroy, however, seemed to have another plan. "300 years!" he firmly said. "Right now, the Tower of Crystal only displays half of its original capabilities. We can help you activate the entire tower. After that, the Lucky Light will have greater effect, and the number of its floors could easily reach up to thirty."</p>

  <p>"Activate the entire tower?" Luo Zheng asked, his eyes suddenly lighting up.</p>

  <p>Delroy nodded. Actually the three trial towers of the Celestial Position race all had thirty floors. But only fifteen floors of the Tower of Crystal in front of them had been activated.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng appreciated the plan Delroy put forward, but he shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Forget about that. In the Tower of Crystal, warriors can only cultivate up to top-level war lords. Even if you help them activate the entire tower, it would not really change anything."</p>

  <p>The Tower of Crystal was located in the middle of the Cursed Land.</p>

  <p>They could only become top-level war lords, because if they exceeded that limit, they would be affected by the curse. Therefore, activating the entire tower would be useless.</p>

  <p>"This problem is easy to solve. We can just set up a transmission array inside the Tower of Crystal," said Delroy.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shook his head again. "The Tower of Crystal will absorb everything.</p>

  <p>Transmission arrays will also be absorbed."</p>

  <p>At this, Delroy smiled proudly. "The transmission array that you set up will naturally be absorbed. But the one we will set up will not!"</p>

  <p>These words amazed Luo Zheng. If they could really set up a transmission array that wouldn't be absorbed by the Tower of Crystal, then war sages and Soul Sea Realm masters would be able to freely enter and leave the tower. As long as they didn't stay inside the tower for more than a month, they wouldn't be afflicted by the curse.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked at Yolande and asked, "Are Fabian and Jarrod still at the bottom of the tower?"</p>

  <p>Yolande nodded. "That's right. After becoming war sages, they have been training there intensively."</p>

  <p>"It seems that they will be able to see the light of day again," Luo Zheng humored, chuckling. "Call them over first."</p>

  <p>If what Delroy was saying was true, then they wouldn't have to stay at the bottom of the tower any longer.</p>

  <p>On that note, Luo Zheng and the people from the Celestial Position race knew that they had reached an agreement. Yolande promptly sent a message to the seat owners of the human race and the Demon Night, telling them to evacuate all creatures from the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>"Leave the Tower of Sin? What does that mean?"</p>

  <p>"Are the Celestial Position warriors really taking the Tower of Sin away?"</p>

  <p>"What the hell! I just became a level eight war general! I never thought that the Tower of Sin would be taken away, especially at this time. Why do I have such bad luck?"</p>

  <p>Creatures from many different races were immediately displeased upon hearing the news. With anger on their faces, they all began shouting, airing their opposition.</p>

  <p>Yolande, however, couldn't be bothered to explain anything to them when she and the Celestial Position warriors arrived at the top of the Tower of Sin. They invited Fabian and Jarrod, the two human war sages, from the bottom of the tower. Upon seeing Luo Zheng, they became pleasantly surprised.</p>

  <p>Then, when they learned that the people beside Luo Zheng would actually be helping them set up a transmission array, the two became even more ecstatic.</p>

  <p>At that point, their minds became so much at ease. Although they could return to the tower from time to time, it was still very boring to spend most of their time at the bottom of the tower. It always made them feel depressed at the thought of how they would never be able to leave the Cursed Land in their lifetimes as they were trapped in the Dark Nether Cave and this small tower.</p>

  <p>But once the transmission array was built, they could return to the Purple Heart Sacred Place at their own will. It was indeed something to celebrate and be happy about.</p>

  <p>On the Cursed Land, the creatures from various races were densely packed around the Tower of Sin. As they stared at the tower in front of them, many of them had unwilling expressions on their faces.</p>

  <p>"Aren't those people too overbearing? How can they take the tower away just like that? The Tower of Sin belongs to the Sea God Continent!"</p>

  <p>"Although I am also very unwilling, according to the legends, this tower does belong to the Celestial Position race. Taking something that belongs to them could not be considered as overbearing, right?"</p>

  <p>"But then again, so what if we are unwilling? Have you heard? Those people are at the Spirit Supreme Realm! Do you know what the spirit Supreme Realm is? It is a realm even higher than the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>They could destroy our sacred places with a snap of their fingers!"</p>

  <p>Actually, even the guy himself didn't know what the Spirit Supreme Realm was. He only knew that the Spirit Supreme Realm warriors were much more powerful than the Soul Sea Realm ones.</p>

  <p>Under the gaze of many creatures, the entire Tower of Sin suddenly began to shake violently.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The buildings in the surrounding villages began to shake as well. It was as if there was a small earthquake. Some of the weaker houses even collapsed in the middle of what was happening.</p>

  <p>"Will they... will they make the Tower of Sin fly away?" someone muttered.</p>

  <p>Under the constant tremors, the tail of the Tower of Sin began to stretch continuously.</p>

  <p>The giant tower then started to act like a living being. With this extension, it grew taller in front of everyone's eyes. The tower's first floor quickly rose into the air. The two giant warriors guarding the door could only stand on the ground in a daze.</p>

  <p>Flying was prohibited within the Cursed Land, so no matter what happened, no one dared to fly.</p>

  <p>The tremor lasted for about an hour. After that, the section of the tower that was above the ground had significantly elongated, reaching a height of 16 floors. As for the underground section, it maintained a height of 14 floors.</p>

  <p>Delroy fulfilled his promise and fully activated the Tower of Sin.</p>
