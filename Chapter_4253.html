<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The little girl, who was leading the way, didn't want to entertain Geoffrey's rudeness.</p>

  <p>She knew that there was such a huge gap between civilizations. Thus she couldn't believe and imagine why Geoffrey could laugh at it.</p>

  <p>As she took the two of them to climb another twenty feet, the sixth-grade world welcomed them.</p>

  <p>However, Elder Xue quickly stopped just before they entered the sixth-grade world.</p>

  <p>He noticed that the steps in front of him were no longer visible. What he could only see were these mysterious-looking square frames. At one moment, they would merge to form larger frames, and then the next moment, they would quickly divide again into the smaller ones. It was a cycle that didn't make sense to him.</p>

  <p>As a creature of the fourth-grade world, it was extremely difficult for Elder Xue to fully grasp the Deep Space. In fact, he only managed to adapt to the Deep Space because he was able to obtain the physical body of the Elemental race by chance. Now that he was about to enter the sixth-grade world, he had some worries that he might not be able to adapt to it.</p>

  <p>"I know what you're thinking. This is the World of No Limits. It won't be that easy for you to adapt," the little girl said with a straight face.</p>

  <p>"If I can't adapt, can I pass it?" Elder Xue asked, just to make sure.</p>

  <p>Although he had reached so far in the Levitation Tower, he still wanted to leave alive.</p>

  <p>Right now, there was just the two of them. If he wouldn't be able to make it, there was still Geoffrey. If Geoffrey could still go up smoothly, he would have no regrets. He could place all his hopes on the young man without reservations.</p>

  <p>"Of course not. That's not how it works," the little girl answered straightforwardly. She even wondered why the elder would ask such a question. "You must be able to completely adapt to this world and see everything clearly before you can pass."</p>

  <p>"Adapt to this world? See everything clearly?" Elder Xue almost laughed at the little girl's statement. "It's impossible for the creatures from the lower-grade worlds to do what you're saying. Even the masters of your race weren't able to do it."</p>

  <p>"What are you saying? Just accept the Soul Reincarnation. This way, the creatures from a lower-grade world would be able to comprehend a higher-grade world. What's the point of the Levitation Tower bestowing you such a strong soul power? Think about it. It is so you can withstand the Soul Reincarnation," the little girl explained.</p>

  <p>After listening to her, Elder Xue finally understood this simple logic.</p>

  <p>Actually, he remembered that there was a technique in the Four Spirits Sect that was similar to the Soul Reincarnation. It was the Red Jade Rite that was developed by the Bold Conjecture House. Using this method, the third-grade creatures were able to smoothly transform into fourth-grade ones.</p>

  <p>However, the drawback of this method was that the creatures would have to endure a lot of pain in the process. Once they failed to withstand it, they would eventually be shattered to pieces.</p>

  <p>"I see. Then let's see how many times I can withstand the Soul Reincarnation!" After saying that, Elder Xue took a step forward with a determined expression on his face.</p>

  <p>As he stepped into the World of No Limits, he instantly felt that his entire body transformed into the countless square frames of various sizes that he saw earlier. All of his senses had undergone violent changes that he couldn't determine what was going on.</p>

  <p>While Elder Xue quickly fell into a state of panic, he saw a bright red square frame appear before him. This frame enveloped him, and he felt like his body was being cut into countless pieces.</p>

  <p>He realized that this sensation wasn't coming from his physical body, but directly from his soul. It could be said that he was just hallucinating, but he had no way of knowing for sure. He only felt that his body and soul were in immense pain and suffering. There was no way to avoid the pain, and he couldn't even pass out. He could only resist it through his willpower. He needed to overcome this or he might not be able to return to his original form.</p>

  <p>This went on for five minutes before the process suddenly stopped.</p>

  <p>The frames began to arrange themselves and combine together to form a unique rule.</p>

  <p>While this was happening, Elder Xue gradually understood the rule and saw the steps in the sixth-grade world. "Did I finish the Soul Reincarnation?" Elder Xue asked as he gasped for air.</p>

  <p>"Yes," the little girl standing beside him replied briefly. It seemed that she had been there this whole time and was completely unaffected by the shift to the sixth-grade world.</p>

  <p>"It's his turn now," she continued as she pointed at Geoffrey who was still standing at the other side.</p>

  <p>Just now, Geoffrey was able to clearly see the pain and agony that Elder Xue underwent. Since he had no choice but to proceed, he got very nervous. "I... If I can understand the sixth-grade world, does it mean that I don't need to undergo this Soul Reincarnation?"</p>

  <p>The little girl glanced at him coldly and was annoyed at his procrastination. "Cut the crap and just step over here!"</p>

  <p>With that, Geoffrey was forced to step inside.</p>

  <p>The rules of the two worlds were completely different. As soon as a creature made a step into the higher-grade world, he shouldn't be able to take the next one without experiencing the Soul Reincarnation. However, to the little girl's surprise, Geoffrey entered the sixth-grade world and proceeded to walk up the stairs easily.</p>

  <p>The little girl couldn't believe what she just saw. "You came from the sixth-grade world? No, I don't think so. Did you experience the Soul Reincarnation already? But that was too fast."</p>

  <p>Geoffrey just shrugged his shoulders while the little girl was still busy analyzing what had really happened.</p>

  <p>The fact still remained that he was able to travel through different worlds effortlessly.</p>

  <p>In fact, Geoffrey had no idea about the Soul Reincarnation, so he must have not experienced it.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Elder Xue, whose face was still pale, let out a faint smile as he saw Geoffrey's relaxed expression as he walked around. His confidence grew stronger that even if he couldn't make it, Geoffrey still had a huge chance.</p>

  <p>As he climbed up the steps of the sixth-grade world, Geoffrey couldn't avert his eyes from the center of the tower.</p>

  <p>"Hey, what are those square stone tablets over there?" he finally asked out of curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Those are not stone tablets. They are the Sacred Spirits," the little girl answered, quite annoyed at Geoffrey's ignorance.</p>

  <p>"Huh? Did you mean that those are the stone tablets set up for the Sacred Spirits?" Geoffrey asked again, confused at the little girl's earlier answer.</p>

  <p>"No. You heard me right the first time. They are the Sacred Spirits, the strongest race in the World of No Limits. They are also the origin of the Fostering race," the little girl replied in an impatient tone. According to the rules, she shouldn't get emotional at any time. However, the guy in front of her was really starting to get on her nerves.</p>

  <p>"Hmm, then why do they look like stone tablets? It is ominous and ridiculous," Geoffrey remarked indifferently.</p>

  <p>Elder Xue, who walked in front of them, was rendered speechless. He could only shake his head helplessly as he heard Geoffrey's comments.</p>

  <p>Even the little girl just stayed silent as she gritted her teeth.</p>

  <p>After they passed the sixth-grade world, they had already reached a total height of three hundred and sixty feet. The little girl stopped for a moment as she was about to introduce the next world.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Elder Xue's legs started to slightly tremble. In the past, if he had an opportunity to experience the Soul Reincarnation, he would be deeply overjoyed.</p>

  <p>However, after experiencing it once, he realized that the pain it brought was totally unbearable. He also got the hint from the little girl that as the grade of the world got higher, the pain from the Soul Reincarnation would also increase.</p>

  <p>"This is the seventh-grade world, the Boundless Divine World. Please come in," the little girl said with an emotionless face.</p>

  <p>This time, her gaze was fixed on Geoffrey. She really wanted to see him suffer the torture bestowed by the Soul Reincarnation.</p>

  <p>But unexpectedly, just like what happened in the sixth-grade world, Geoffrey walked in leisurely and proceeded to look at the center of the Levitation Tower. His eyes lit up as if he had seen something amusing.</p>

  <p>"Bamboos! There are so many bamboos. Don't tell me that they are the natives of the Boundless Divine World!"</p>

  <p>"This guy…" The little girl's eyes widened in surprise.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing that Geoffrey still roamed around in a carefree manner, she was both shocked and frustrated at the same time.</p>

  <p>'This is already the seventh-grade world. He is neither a fifth-grade nor a sixth-grade creature. Then, he's a seventh-grade creature?</p>

  <p>That should be a nasty joke! Why isn't the Soul Reincarnation activated on him?</p>

  <p>Is there something wrong with the Levitation Tower? But, it couldn't be. It worked just fine with the elder earlier.'</p>

  <p>While she was still at a loss for words, Elder Xue took the liberty to step into the seventh-grade world. With his first step, he instantly fell into the torture of the Soul Reincarnation once again.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, the little girl was fully convinced that there was nothing wrong with the Levitation Tower. As she looked towards Geoffrey, she finally realized that his ability was way beyond her imagination.</p>

  <p>"Does it mean that the worlds of different grades do not affect you?" That was all the little girl could conclude at this point.</p>

  <p>"I honestly don't know," Geoffrey answered frankly. He then pointed at the stairs and said, "If we continue to go up, we'll know."</p>
