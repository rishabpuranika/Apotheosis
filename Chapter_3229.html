<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3229 The Cause Of The Whole Thing </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The three men from the Bearing race paid Dorothy no heed.</p>

  <p>Their leader gently raised his hand. The Soul Snakes raised their heads attentively, their threadlike tongues darting in and out.</p>

  <p>Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!</p>

  <p>Dorothy trembled slightly.</p>

  <p>Then, the man said, "Call Milo Mo from your Oneness Sky Palace over to receive his death!"</p>

  <p>Hearing this, the Oneness Sky Palace disciples exchanged confused glances.</p>

  <p>"Milo?!" a disciple cried in surprise.</p>

  <p>"He came to the temple a few days ago, but we haven't seen him in a while," someone chirped.</p>

  <p>"Several days ago, he challenged some disciples from the Bearing race," another added. "Did he cause any trouble?"</p>

  <p>Dorothy's brows knitted. She was puzzled. No one had expected this predicament had anything to do with Milo. "Zheng, isn't Milo also a member of the Flow Sword Sect? Have you seen him recently?" she asked in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"I did see him," Zheng admitted.</p>

  <p>"Then what happened?" Dorothy asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Zheng shook his head. "I don't know exactly what happened, but I guess he might have hurt someone important from the Bearing race, and now they're trying to take revenge."</p>

  <p>Although Zheng had no idea what had happened exactly, Milo had disclosed to him about a great breakthrough in the Flow Swordsmanship. He had eagerly practiced what he discovered on some unfortunate souls on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>After all, the best place to practice the Flow Swordsmanship without holding back was on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Milo had also specifically said that he had beaten many rivals and even the Bearing race was afraid of him. Zheng was afraid that Milo might have bullied the Bearing race on the Other Shore. So the disciples from the Bearing race were going to seek revenge today.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, Zheng and Milo were both from the Flow Sword Sect. He took a step forward. "Milo is my fellow disciple. May I ask what he's done to offend you?"</p>

  <p>"Yesterday he almost killed my younger brother in the Soul Arena. My brother is still in a coma today. I would like to face the man who did this!" the man said in a cold voice.</p>

  <p>The Soul Arena was an open field that stood in the middle of the three temples of the human race. Souls of Light would go here to compete against one another, to determine the strength of their souls.</p>

  <p>"Oh, this is so trivial," Dorothy said in an annoyed tone. "A soul battle is likely to cause accidents. Since your brother chose to enter the Soul Arena, he should've been aware of the risks. Yet you have the nerve to demand for an explanation!"</p>

  <p>Many had lost their lives in the Soul Arena. Anyone who entered knew their fate would be determined by the strength of their souls.</p>

  <p>"Who said I am here to ask for an explanation?" he sneered. "He should've known he wouldn't get away with this so easily. If he doesn't come out to fight me, I won't let you go." The snakes hissed ominously.</p>

  <p>Zheng surveyed his surroundings. Everywhere he turned, hordes of snakes blocked his way. Even the gate of the temple was swarmed with the vicious creatures; no one could go in or out. The Oneness Sky Palace was in for a lot of trouble if this kept up.</p>

  <p>"What should we do?"</p>

  <p>"Shall we go get Milo?"</p>

  <p>In terms of strength and status, the Bearing race was indeed more powerful than the Oneness Sky Palace. Although the Oneness Sky Palace disciples were angry with the situation, it seemed they had no choice.</p>

  <p>Some of the warriors quietly left the Other Shore and delivered the news to the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>Sophia and her three companions looked at Zheng silently.</p>

  <p>"This man is from the Flow Sword Sect," the man next to Sophia said in a low voice. "I heard that the Flow Sword Sect's talent, Milo, is capable of Instant Enlightenment. But this is not Milo. Could he be Konnor?"</p>

  <p>"I have seen Konnor before," another man answered, puzzled. "That can't be him."</p>

  <p>Looking Zheng up and down, Sophia was filled with confusion.</p>

  <p>She couldn't shake off the feeling that she'd met him before. His aura and voice were exactly the same as those of the man she had met on the Sea of Truth. That man could swim in the Sea of Truth! Could this be the same guy?</p>

  <p>Among the people of the Oneness Sky Palace, it was Sophia and her companions who had first found out that someone could swim in the Sea of Truth. After all, they had witnessed it themselves.</p>

  <p>But since then, she had never run into Zheng again.</p>

  <p>But that person hadn't been a member of the Oneness Sky Palace at the time. Why was he a member now?</p>

  <p>Sophia's mind buzzed with so many questions.</p>

  <p>On the outside, however, she tried to remain composed. Deciding not to tell her companions the truth, she just shook her head to drop the subject.</p>

  <p>The horde of snakes continued to block the entrance of the temple.</p>

  <p>The three men from the Bearing race were stubborn. They weren't going to leave till they faced Milo.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a man appeared inside the temple. Strolling past the crowd to face the three men, he said, "Didn't I tell you I would go to the Soul Arena three days from then? Why are you so impatient?"</p>

  <p>He smiled. Of course, who else could it be but Milo?</p>

  <p>A faint purple light flashed on his Soul of Light. Although it wasn't as bright as Zheng's and Dorothy's, people could tell it was not that far from reaching the Indigo Soul. It seemed the Flow Sword Sect was offering him many resources.</p>

  <p>"You are Milo Mo?" asked the leading warrior of the Bearing race with a snort.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am," replied Milo calmly.</p>

  <p>"Do you dare to enter the Soul Arena and fight me?" the man continued, baring his teeth.</p>

  <p>"Why not? But..." Milo gestured at the snakes. "Get rid of that crap."</p>

  <p>The man did not refuse. Raising his right hand, a bright silver halo appeared. Reaching into the halo, he pulled out a brown pot. Then, he pointed the mouth of the pot at the black Soul Snakes.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>All the Soul Snakes transformed into pools of black light that the pot seemed to suck in.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, all the Soul Snakes that blocked the entrance of temple had disappeared.</p>

  <p>The disciples in the temple heaved a sigh of relief. While they were glad the matter didn't escalate, they were worried for their companion, Milo.</p>

  <p>The three Souls of Light of the Bearing race were Indigo Souls. Indigo Souls could try to surpass the Lust World. After they finished the Chaotic Source Reinforcement, they would be promoted to Chaotic Source Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>Milo's soul was undeniably a bit weaker than that of the leading disciple of the Bearing race.</p>

  <p>"I've heard that Milo is capable of Instant Enlightenment," a disciple whispered. "No wonder he is a rare genius in the Oneness Sky Palace. He doesn't seem to be nervous at all!"</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately his soul is a little weaker," another one said wistfully.</p>

  <p>"Really? I don't think so. A few days ago, he defeated three Indigo Souls from the Bearing race all by himself."</p>

  <p>The man who had summoned back the Soul Snakes put away the pot and gestured towards the arena.</p>

  <p>Without a word, Milo followed them.</p>

  <p>Although they had been filled with fear just minutes prior, curiosity overcame the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace. They too wordlessly followed Milo and the men to the arena.</p>

  <p>By now, the news had spread so quickly, permeating the depths of the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>The normal disciples, elite disciples, and the direct descendants of the various mountain heads visited the Other Shore, streaming out of the temple gate. It seemed the interest of the entire Oneness Sky Palace was piqued.</p>

  <p>"Let's go and have a look too," Dorothy said excitedly.</p>

  <p>It was not a trivial matter anymore. While many disciples of the Bearing race had died in the Soul Arena, no one had dared to block the entrance of the Oneness Sky Palace's temple before. To a certain extent, this somewhat represented the true attitude of the Bearing race.</p>

  <p>Zheng had just become an Indigo Soul. Originally, he had wanted to go to Stage Thirteen of the Other Shore with Dorothy, and perhaps he could find an Other Shore Token that was suitable for the Truth of Cultivation Nature.</p>

  <p>He didn't expect such a thing to happen before he could do so. With a sigh, he followed after Dorothy.</p>
