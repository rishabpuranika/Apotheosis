<br/><br/>

  

  <p>The mighty oppressing force subjugating the soul in the third ring was twice as powerful as that in the second ring, and thus fourfold as that in the first ring.</p>

  <p>The moment Luo Zheng crossed the threshold of the third ring, the unseen force almost knocked him off and dominated his body at once. He gritted his teeth as he felt the push and pull against his soul, which was being tightly pressed and squeezed into an irregular shape like a piece of rag.</p>

  <p>The intensity rendered him barely breathing, but he didn't resist. As a small smile was seen slowly forming on his lips, he embraced the massive force in total surrender!</p>

  <p>Surely, he was a really bright spark. He silently thanked himself up for being wise enough to get well prepared. He had anticipated that this was bound to happen anyway. So the moment he gained access to the third ring, he braced himself hard and dashed straight towards the tiny oil lamp emitting a soft light in the center.</p>

  <p>Christopher never slowed down a bit in chasing his target. As a strong and determined opponent, he followed Luo Zheng closely at his heels, no matter how fast the latter could run. And there wasn't much difference in time which they took to burst into the third ring.</p>

  <p>In contrast to Zheng's calmness, Christopher wore startled expression on the sudden impact of the strengthened force emanating from the third ring.</p>

  <p>The strong cyan light shield surrounding Christopher's soul was comparably weaker against the mighty oppressing force in the third ring.</p>

  <p>The layer of cyan light, which wrapped his soul perfectly to protect it from any harm, cracked unexpectedly!</p>

  <p>His soul was characteristically more powerful than Zheng's soul. But having it exposed directly unprotected now against the mighty oppressing force that was quadrupled in strength, he felt he was close to the limit of his endurance. He grimaced as he focused his gaze towards the nearest oil lamp. Under the massive oppressive force, he gathered an ounce of his strength and advanced towards the direction of the soft light strenuously with clenched teeth, determined to reach it.</p>

  <p>The area of the domain was mapped out of having the outer rings larger than the inner rings. Therefore, the third ring was much shorter than the first ring in terms of circumference.</p>

  <p>Since there were 32 oil lamps in the first ring, the number of oil lamps would be lessened gradually as the ring turned smaller and smaller. As a result, there were only 16 oil lamps in the second ring, 8 oil lamps in the third ring, 4 oil lamps in the fourth ring, and 2 oil lamps in the fifth ring.</p>

  <p>As for the sixth ring that was the nearest to the owl beast devil spirit, there was only one oil lamp in it.</p>

  <p>Gearing himself up, Christopher watched Luo Zheng closely. However, his cyan light was becoming weaker and weaker under the attack of the mighty oppressing force, and its power was slowly dwindling away. When his shielding light had finally lost its ability to protect his soul, he was as vulnerable as Luo Zheng. They were on an equal footing now.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng dashed for the next oil lamp at the same time when Christopher rushed out of the protection range of his oil lamp. Both of them had to recover their soul energy with the power of the oil lamp.</p>

  <p>In this way, they moved forward strenuously, with Luo Zheng always ahead of Christopher to occupy the next oil lamp. Each oil lamp had become their rest station to replenish their energy for the next one. Christopher felt the urge of annoyance as he was always one lamp behind of Luo Zheng. And in spite of all his effort, he was unable to narrow the distance.</p>

  <p>Admiration filled the hearts of all those warriors who were watching the fierce contest under the oil lamps. They respected Christopher for his perseverance in following Luo Zheng and his ambition to overtake him. But what stunned them the most was Zheng's surprisingly rapid progress. No one among the spectators had expected that Luo Zheng would enter into the third ring at so fast a speed!</p>

  <p>The soul energy would be promoted fast and dramatically if the soul could practice in the black ball. Once it reached the sixth ring, it would enter the Fighting Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>The word "Fighting" in the Fighting Soul Realm indicated that it was a realm in which the soul could directly participate in the fight. The soul would have the extreme fighting ability once it passed into the Fighting Soul Realm. Instead of being weak and in need of some protective measures, it would grow much stronger, and thus could be filled in as a weapon to kill enemies.</p>

  <p>The most ordinary leaves and flowers would be much stronger than some fairy weapons and even some sacred weapons, once they were filled with the fighting soul in the Fighting Soul Realm. That was the most powerful ability of the fighting soul in the Fighting Soul Realm!</p>

  <p>All the warriors who were able to practice in the black ball would hope for their souls to enter into the Fighting Soul Realm. But to reach the Fighting Soul Realm, it was by no means an easy job! The forging of soul, however, had nothing to do with a forger's accumulation of energies. So it was natural that some practitioners who had entered the later stage of the Internal Elixir Realm, and even some capable practitioners in the Virtual Tribulation Realm, were unable to have any opportunities to knock the door of the Fighting Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>"Christopher seems to have lost his mind! There's no way for him to overtake his opponent!"</p>

  <p>"It's useless. Luo Zheng is ahead of him all the time. Christopher is just wasting his energy. What he could do to Luo Zheng if he really surpasses him?"</p>

  <p>"Hey, do you know who Christopher is in the Lower World? A talent! A big name! He has no choice! He must win his face back since he was defeated by that guy. It's understandable why he is unwilling to lose again in this contest."</p>

  <p>The three companions of Christopher continued to discuss, feeling somewhat ridiculous for Christopher's stubbornness in catching up with Luo Zheng. He had never relaxed a single moment in chasing Luo Zheng, as he had a strong desire of overtaking Luo Zheng and killing him. He didn't know, however, that after so many circles of run-and-chase, Zheng's soul was getting stronger and stronger.</p>
