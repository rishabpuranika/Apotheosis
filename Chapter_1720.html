  <p>Kurt's Buddhist heart was extremely stable.</p>

  <p>Back in the Hidden Spirit Temple, there was an ancient bell. Each time this bell was rung, the six realms of existence would appear as an illusion and create endless cycles of reincarnation.</p>

  <p>The temperance of one's heart meant entering the six paths of reincarnation.</p>

  <p>The Hidden Spirit Temple's core disciples were the only ones qualified to enter the ancient bell's interior and ring it once a month.</p>

  <p>This process helped them cultivate and temper their Buddhist heart.</p>

  <p>The illusion of six realms was unforgiving. It was something that truly tested a disciple's Buddhist heart in ways one could not even begin to describe. But if disciples went into it more than once in a month, it might shatter their hearts in the process.</p>

  <p>However, Kurt was different. Instead of once a month, he rang the bell every day for four hundred consecutive days!</p>

  <p>When he left, his heart was understandably stronger and much more stable than others.</p>

  <p>Kurt was the only one who had done and could sustain such an ordeal.</p>

  <p>It could be said that he had the most stable heart out of all the disciples in the Hidden Spirit Temple. Nothing could shake him, except perhaps the scene right in front of him.</p>

  <p>No amount of ringing the ancient bell could ever prepare his heart for something like this. What Kurt comprehended was great wisdom and tremendous courage that bordered on pure fearlessness.</p>

  <p>However, Nathan's strike seemed to have the ability to destroy the Buddhist heart!</p>

  <p>His vision of the future had been extremely grim and it was soon about to come true!</p>

  <p>Nathan would indeed be able to kill him with a single spear strike!</p>

  <p>This event would happen in the next nine seconds and each second he spent thinking about it made his chest feel stuffy. It felt as if a heavy hammer was slamming itself down his Buddhist heart. The knowledge of his imminent destruction made Kurt turn a pale shade of white.</p>

  <p>Nathan, on the other hand, remained calm as he held onto his spear.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh..."</p>

  <p>Kurt continued to revolve around Nathan.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Nathan simply stood in his spot, spear still aimed at Kurt.</p>

  <p>This went on for ten more rounds.</p>

  <p>"Puff!"</p>

  <p>The battle had been at an initial standstill. However, this quickly changed the moment Kurt spat out a mouthful of blood and stopped moving.</p>

  <p>This scene astonished the warriors outside.</p>

  <p>"The two of them haven't even fought yet so how in the world did Kurt get injured?"</p>

  <p>"I have no idea. I'm just getting more and more confused..."</p>

  <p>"Could it be that Nathan knows some kind of evil martial art?"</p>

  <p>The last assumption was highly unlikely to be true. Ordinary evil martial arts wouldn't have worked in these circumstances.</p>

  <p>Also, Nathan was not someone who would practice such a thing since it wasn't in his character to make use of such despicable tricks.</p>

  <p>Kurt stood still to stabilize himself. He then put his hands together and closed his eyes.</p>

  <p>The future still hadn't changed and no matter where Nathan attacked, the result would still be the same.</p>

  <p>This wasn't good. His Buddhist heart was in danger because of Nathan's spear!</p>

  <p>He would not die for real in the Illusion Battlefield. All Kurt would need to do was to restore his physical body. However, if his state of mind was affected, then it would bring unnecessary trouble to his Buddhist heart.</p>

  <p>"I admit defeat," Kurt announced. He saluted with one hand and retreated.</p>

  <p>"What?!" "What was that? He just admitted defeat straightaway!"</p>

  <p>"That monk is useless... The fight hasn't even started yet! What a good-for-nothing fighter!"</p>

  <p>"He got scared the moment the battle was about to begin. Ha-ha! It seems the Hidden Spirit Temple doesn't really have any peerless talents to boast of!"</p>

  <p>Nobody in the top ten admitted defeat. At least, not normally.</p>

  <p>Everyone was understood to have unfathomable strength and nobody would be willing to give up so easily. This was the reason why fights amongst those at the top were often incredibly intense.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning, of course, was an exception. Ever since she entered, she had always performed casually and did not try her best at all.</p>

  <p>This was the reason why Kurt's admission of defeat was incredibly surprising and also a tad bit scandalous. Nonetheless, Nathan quickly put away his spear and stuffed it into his own Sumeru Space.</p>

  <p>He did not say a word as he flew towards the sky. Kurt could only watch his figure as he too flew back towards the stone.</p>

  <p>His actions today would no doubt haunt him in the form of harsh criticism. Despite that, he still believed that he made the right decision.</p>

  <p>"Tianming, what's your opinion on this?" The way Nathan held the spear just now left a really deep impression on Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Just holding the spear in a certain way was enough to make his opponent admit defeat.</p>

  <p>Tianming had a cautious look in his face. "This guy's strength seems to be extremely special!" Since Nathan won against Kurt by default, he now needed to fight Luo Luo Zheng for first place. If Luo Luo Zheng were to win, then he would need to fight against Tianming for second place.</p>

  <p>"How special is it?" Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Tianming shrugged. "I don't know. I just feel that his actions are really strange..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes immediately lit up when he heard this.</p>

  <p>He too noticed this.</p>

  <p>Nathan's stance looked seemingly normal. However, the spear's position and altitude were strange. The spear's tip just seemed to be angled in such a way that confused Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He just had a feeling about it, the kind that was hard to describe. It was as if Nathan was standing there but also not there!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng didn't really have the time to figure it out since he was now about to face him in the next round!</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng versus Nathan. These two will fight for the first place in this round," the mysterious girl announced in her characteristically cold voice.</p>

  <p>This battle would be the most crucial event in the Illusion Battlefield...</p>

  <p>The victor of this round would emerge as the top warrior of the universe and also as the main character of this era!</p>

  <p>According to the Supreme Lords' speculations, the victor would get the heavens' support. His luck would also be greatly affected.</p>

  <p>Everyone's focus was now on the two who faced against each other for the title of this universe's top warrior.</p>

  <p>Yao pulled a long face.</p>

  <p>She almost won the battle between her and Xun, but now...</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng initially only had the fate to lead the world of chaos, but this was already enough for Yao to deem him as a threat.</p>

  <p>However, she kept in mind that there were tens of thousands of warriors that carried the same fate. Her caution against Luo Luo Zheng would have to ultimately be decided by the results of this competition.</p>

  <p>She never expected it would turn out like this...</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was now about to compete with the Godly Genius of the Xuanyuan Clan for first place!</p>

  <p>This person was truly invincible and unstoppable!</p>

  <p>"How could Xun be so lucky?" Yao was extremely beautiful, but she was born with a ruthless and vicious Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng truly got first place then it would be impossible for her to force him to stay in the Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>But would she just let him return with Xun to attack her?</p>

  <p>Of course not!</p>

  <p>Right now, Xun was still in the Immortal Mansion with no idea of what was currently happening.</p>

  <p>She was most probably bored out of her wits...</p>

  <p>There was no Illusion Space within this Immortal Mansion, so she had no way of knowing Luo Zheng's ranking.</p>

  <p>Freya had also entered the Illusion Battlefield but got eliminated fairly quickly, so she also did not know anything about the current situation.</p>

  <p>The past few days had been quite lively as the entire universe was filled with roars from the Roaring Tokens.</p>

  <p>Some Supreme Lords would also mention Luo Luo Zheng occasionally.</p>

  <p>A few praised him while others cursed him.</p>

  <p>Judging by those remarks, it was highly likely that Luo Luo Zheng managed to enter the final stage.</p>

  <p>Freya had no idea of his ranking, but it would be great if he made it to the top ten. She was still a bit worried though. There were so many powerful talents from the larger clans and Luo Luo Zheng might not necessarily be a match for them. She felt that he didn't really have that much experience and cultivation to pose as a threat against those geniuses.</p>

  <p>Xun sat on one side of the octagonal pavilion and dipped a toe in the water. This caused a small ripple to appear on the surface that she found herself staring at as she got lost in her thoughts.</p>

  <p>She was not normally like this. Even she herself knew that this wasn't really her normal personality. She had only gotten like this because of Luo Luo Zheng and staying by his side for so many years.</p>

  <p>She was no longer the Queen of Killings. Instead, she was now a woman who seldom cared about anything and was extremely reliant on Luo Luo Zheng for everything.</p>

  <p>Back in the Illusion Battlefield, Nathan once again stood on the Heaven Earth Board.</p>

  <p>He was extremely wary of Luo Luo Zheng, having observed the battle between him and Tianming.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's extremely cold internal momentum had the capacity to suppress his warrior spirit. At that moment, Nathan's indestructible confidence wavered.</p>

  <p>Even a True God wouldn't be able to do anything about it.</p>

  <p>That split second of influence caused Nathan to suddenly doubt his life's struggle and effort.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the Mu Ning around Luo Luo Zheng disappeared after a few seconds.</p>

  <p>Nathan had no idea how Luo Luo Zheng did that. It was as if this ability of him had been forced out by Tianming earlier. However, Luo Luo Zheng didn't seem to have the ability to control it.</p>

  <p>Nathan observed the situation very carefully and noticed the split-second doubt that appeared in Luo Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>It was alright.</p>

  <p>Even if Luo Zheng's sword was powerful, he still had a chance to defeat him.</p>

  <p>"Clap, clap!"</p>

  <p>Two stones were placed on the Heaven Earth Board as the two of them landed on its surface.</p>

  <p>The sight of where the stones landed filled Nathan with joy. He almost couldn't believe his luck!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng couldn't help but frown when he noticed the joy on his opponent's face. He had heard Nathan talk nonsense because of the stone placement previously and it made Luo Luo Zheng very unhappy.</p>

  <p>"It seems like I have no shortage of lucky chances in my life," Nathan said as he laughed out loud.</p>

  <p>    </p>
