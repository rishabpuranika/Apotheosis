  <p>
</p>

  <p>The menacing Soul-eater was approaching.</p>

  <p>It was massive, around the size of a mountain, and although it did not use Grand Teleportation, it still managed to cross several supreme worlds in just one minute.</p>

  <p>"It's coming!"</p>

  <p>"Supreme Lord Lester, you have to go now!"</p>

  <p>"Let me block it..."</p>

  <p>If Blayd was unable to defeat this monster, then what more the other Supreme Lords could do? They knew they couldn't possibly win this fight but they couldn't just revert into meek lambs who waited to be slaughtered by the wolf. They were Supreme Lords and they would fight this monster to the death if need be.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Zheng raised his head and stared up at the sky. "You... are you still not going to make your move?"</p>

  <p>His words stunned Master Feng, along with the other Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>They all looked at him with strange expressions.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, who are you talking to?"</p>

  <p>"Do you know someone who can help us?"</p>

  <p>"Is that person more powerful than that long-haired man?"</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords began to ask in earnest.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Zheng wasn't that nervous from the start, Supreme Lord of Oracle figured that the young man might have some tricks up his sleeve, and he seemed very confident in his trump card.</p>

  <p>Zheng chose not to directly answer their questions but there was a faint smile on his face as he looked at the Sacred Supreme Lords on the other side.</p>

  <p>The blue-clothed woman was enslaved by him but he still respected her.</p>

  <p>If she wasn't willing to appear right now, she might have her reasons. He could only ask her.</p>

  <p>"Hooo... hooo..."</p>

  <p>The blast of the wind was deafening as the Soul-eater continued passing through several more supreme worlds. It was now only a few million miles away now. It would only take it a split second to cross this distance with its fast travelling speed.</p>

  <p>The Sacred Supreme Lords were naturally overjoyed. If the Soul-eater managed to kill all these Supreme Lords in one go then that would save them a great deal of effort in truly conquering the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>After all, the Sacred race had lost so many Supreme Lords on their side and if they acted rashly now, they were afraid that they would lose more.</p>

  <p>However, at that moment, a pillar of blazing light appeared in front of Zheng. From the space crack emerged a burly figure.</p>

  <p>"Blayd? No. You're too injured... You don't have to fight!" Zheng told him.</p>

  <p>He had thought that it was the blue-clothed woman that was going to make her move.</p>

  <p>Blayd's body was currently bathed in blood. After that slap from the Soul-eater, his body was worse for wear: he had broken bones and muscles all over his body, and blood that poured continuously from his wounds. His entire body was like a porcelain figure which was fit together with broken pieces.</p>

  <p>"Huff, huff…"</p>

  <p>Blayd breathed heavily. "I promised you that I would help you kill those three enemies. I'm not someone who goes back on their word."</p>

  <p>Zheng shook his head. "You're not that guy's match. Moreover, you've already helped me kill three True Gods: Mateo, Pranav, and Marko!"</p>

  <p>"Hahaha! The warriors of the War God Hall always keep their promises.</p>

  <p>I cannot go against my heart."</p>

  <p>As he said this, a heroic aura burst forth from Blayd's body. The wounds he had endured suddenly healed and a fighting intent, fiercer than before, emanated from him. This fighting intent turned into bands of light that visibly surrounded him in ripples.</p>

  <p>"Grand Fighting Technique!"</p>

  <p>"Six-Five Fist!"</p>

  <p>Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop!</p>

  <p>Six circular patterns suddenly appeared in front of Blayd. He grabbed each one and the six patterns quickly converged and glowed on his palm.</p>

  <p>The aura then disappeared along with the fighting intent. At that moment, Blayd closed his fist which emitted a faint blue light from the patterns earlier. There was only determination in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Deep in the dense fog of the divine land...</p>

  <p>"Woodruff, this young man is not bad. He's a good person!"</p>

  <p>"There aren't many people who have mastered the Six-Five Fist, not even in the War God Hall, right?"</p>

  <p>"What a pity. There is a high possibility for him to die if he were to fight a Soul-eater head-on."</p>

  <p>"Blayd! Don't be a fool!" A roar reverberated in the fog from the Holy Being of the War God Hall.</p>

  <p>Blayd's spirit was very admirable but his actions were no different from suicide. The War God Hall had searched for him for so long and the moment he appeared, it seemed that he was about to give his life away for the virtue of the fight.</p>

  <p>Holy Beings were forbidden from interfering in the war between universes, Mike and Murphy were no exception. The consequences of breaking the rules written on the stone slab were too serious for them to bear.</p>

  <p>"You… Do you still not want to come out?"</p>

  <p>Zheng asked a second time. He also didn't want Blayd to lose his life like this.</p>

  <p>"Alas…"</p>

  <p>A faint sigh murmured near his ear. The sigh was almost inaudible but a voice then began to speak softly in his mind. "I indeed do not want to reveal myself so I can only borrow your body for now. I hope you don't mind, Master. Hehe…"</p>

  <p>There was another soft laugh that gradually faded out.</p>

  <p>At the next moment, Zheng suddenly felt as if he had lost control of his own body!</p>

  <p>It seemed that the blue-clothed woman had possessed him!</p>

  <p>Zheng couldn't help but feel as if he had been tricked.</p>

  <p>The Enslaving Token ensured that he had that woman under his thumb but she was able to take over his body so easily. This was quite ironic and far too much.</p>

  <p>However, no matter how loud he yelled in madness, nobody would really be able to hear him.</p>

  <p>The moment she took control of his body, she had already isolated his soul from his mind. At that moment, Zheng didn't even have the ability to release his perception.</p>

  <p>"Zheng? What are you doing?"</p>

  <p>Xun asked as she looked at Zheng strangely.</p>

  <p>Before she could stop him, Zheng had already darted past and arrived in front of Blayd! Zheng's movements were too fast. What she saw was only a flash of light in the whole process.</p>

  <p>His movements also stunned the Supreme Lords. Supreme Lord of Oracle and the others also couldn't help but look at Supreme Lord Healum.</p>

  <p>Zheng was only a world lord who could cross a distance of 10, 000 miles at most using Grand Teleportation. Blayd had been millions of miles away from him so it was impossible for him to have gotten so close at such a short amount of time. Had Supreme Lord Healum thrown Zheng using the Space Lock?</p>

  <p>What was his purpose in sending Zheng there? Did he want to send the young man to his death?</p>

  <p>Noticing the strange looks the other Supreme Lords were giving him, Supreme Lord Healum was quick to prove his innocence. He shook his head fervently. "This... It's not me! I have long since unshackled the Space Lock on Zheng!"</p>

  <p>"Then how did he do it?" one of the Supreme Lords asked.</p>

  <p>"How should I know?" Supreme Lord Healum shot back. "There are a lot of unimaginable things that had already happened to that guy. Ask him yourself!"</p>

  <p>"What should we do now? Should we go to help him?" Supreme Lord of Oracle did not care why Zheng was suddenly behaving like this, all she cared about was his safety.</p>

  <p>Master Feng frowned as the Evolution Lotus Flower spun above his head. "Let us watch what will happen first. Zheng would never act so rashly. He might be planning something."</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Blayd was already brimming with fighting intent and was ready to unleash his Six-Five Fist. Zheng's sudden appearance suddenly threw him off. "What are you doing here?"</p>

  <p>Zheng merely smiled at him and Blayd couldn't help but feel something strange with that smile. "Step back," Zheng told him.</p>

  <p>The tone and the expression on Zheng's face confused Blayd greatly. He knew that the voice was Zheng's but it was definitely another person. Why did he feel as if the young man's manner resembled that of the blue-clothed woman?</p>

  <p>Thinking quickly, Blayd finally realized what just happened. Just as he was about to speak, Zheng had already placed his hand on his shoulder. An intense mysterious aura hit Blayd on the face as Zheng made a strange gesture by pressing the tips of his thumb and forefinger together while keeping the other three fingers raised. The young man then lightly brushed against Blayd's shoulder with his fingers.</p>

  <p>Blayd suddenly felt himself shooting backwards before smashing into the supreme world where the Supreme Lords of the Evolutionary Universe were staying.</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng pushed Blayd away, the Soul-eater burst forth and suddenly charged towards him. Zheng quickly turned and brushed his hand upwards towards the monster. As his fingers lightly brushed his opponent, Zheng was able to skillfully change the Soul-eater's direction and made it charge up into the sky!</p>
