<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 524 Smashing Through The Walls (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Holding Aura's hand, Luo Zheng raced away rapidly. Mu Ning could feel a mighty force drag her forward. She didn't need to take any steps to follow him, since that mighty, invisible force was pushing her and she felt like she was riding on a cloud.</p>

  <p>After running for a while, a vermilion wall appeared in their path and blocked the way. All the walls in the palace were painted in vermilion and were one meter thick. However, Luo Zheng didn't stop. When he finally approached the wall and got close enough to it, he simply bumped into it without any hesitation at all. As a result, the wall cracked open and a big hole appeared in it.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng grew more and more uneasy, looking like a caged beast. He had brought his strength and speed into full play. While Mu Ning, who was standing behind him, cracked into a smile.</p>

  <p>She had been caught in the Shine Palace for quite a period of time and today, she felt very pleased to see that Luo Zheng had grown so strong. She was blissfully happy. She looked as if she was intoxicated. She followed Luo Zheng silently as she watched his broad back. It almost seemed to her that she really didn't care whether they could get out of the Burning Sky Palace or not.</p>

  <p>More importantly, Mu Ning was clear that it was impossible for Luo Zheng to get out with her.</p>

  <p>"Your Highness, let us go and stop this man."</p>

  <p>The guests of the Feathery Star Hall volunteered to accompany the old man behind Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Ray turned a deaf ear towards them. He was busy gazing firmly at Lily who was now fighting with Uncle Kyle.</p>

  <p>Kyle was the old man Luo Zheng had been fighting. He was a trusted follower of Ray, and also an elder of the family.</p>

  <p>As Lily initiated her sword dance, Kyle panicked. Now, with his spear broken into two by her sword, it was very difficult for him to deflect Lily's sword dance.</p>

  <p>But after several rounds, Kyle finally took control with his life vitality.</p>

  <p>He became more valiant in the fight. Gusts of winds came from his palms and streams of life vitality escaped from his body which helped him withstand the attacks of Lily's sword dance. He was finally successful in forcing Lily to retreat.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Lily's eyes, which were originally full of malicious Mu Ning, suddenly flashed a dark shade of red. She turned into a dot of red light and whirled around the Drinking Blood Sword, rushing out of the Feathery Star Hall. As Lily was Zheng's sword spirit, their hearts were connected. Luo Zheng clearly knew that Lilly would not be able to hold on for too long, so he immediately summoned her back.</p>

  <p>Kyle cupped his hands and bowed to Ray, "Your Highness, please let me go and catch Luo Zheng."</p>

  <p>Ray shook his head and refused, "No. We have already created quite a stir with the loud noise your fighting made. I have sent a message to Hendy."</p>

  <p>"Hendy? Your Highness, do we really have to bother Hendy for this matter?" Kyle was slightly surprised.</p>

  <p>"Yes. We didn't have to do that earlier on. But now, a group of hateful eunuchs have come in the middle. What else can I do?" Ray sneered.</p>

  <p>Kyle frowned as Ray's words sank into his mind. If the eunuchs got a hand in this matter, there was going to be great trouble.</p>

  <p>"Come with me tonight. Things are getting a little tricky now." Ray floated up in the air and flew out of the Feathery Star Hall. Although he had never taken admission into the Cloud Sect, as the most competitive prince of his generation, he still was pretty talented. And the resources that came into his hands were no less than the resources that any elite disciple of the Cloud Sect could enjoy. He had reached the Illuminating Soul Realm long ago.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Several walls were smashed into pieces with loud crashes accompanying each hit.</p>

  <p>Seeing them whirling through the palace, many maids and eunuchs shrieked in horror.</p>

  <p>When he was hitting the walls, Luo Zheng was also applying a slight vibration with his hands. At the moment he touched the wall, his body vibrated intensively with a low amplitude. Therefore, the impact on the wall was destructible. And every time Luo Zheng casually smashed into the wall with his body, the wall cracked into a hole as big as two meters high.</p>

  <p>Zheng's face and head were covered with ash and mud, and he looked like something the cat had dragged in. Mu Ning was in stark contrast to him though. She was following closely behind him, looking immaculate, with no signs of dirt or ash on her at all.</p>

  <p>"Why the hell is this accursed Burning Sky Palace so big?' Luo Zheng got frustrated now. He had gone in a straight line the moment he had gotten out of the Feathery Star Hall and he had broken dozens of walls along the way. It was beyond him why he hadn't walked out of the Burning Sky Palace yet.</p>

  <p>"The Feathery Star Hall is situated at the left-front of the Burning Sky Palace. You're heading into the very depths of the palace since you took a right. If you continue on this route, I'm afraid you will have to walk through the whole palace before we see the light of day. No wonder you feel that the palace is so big," Mu Ning replied slowly with a graceful smile.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng lost his head upon hearing her. "Oh my god! Why didn't you tell me that earlier?" He was depressed. It turned out that he had been headed the wrong way all the time. He was going into the depths of the Burning Sky Palace instead of getting out. What a disappointment!</p>

  <p>"It's okay�" Mu Ning replied in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"Okay? Why? If we had taken the right turn earlier on, we might have already gotten out of the Burning Sky Palace!" While talking, Luo Zheng smashed against another wall and they entered into a beautiful and delicate garden. The idyllic scene in the garden was quite a feast to the eyes, with several birds singing in the air, flowers casting forth their fragrance, and trees throwing a pleasant shade on the ground. They felt as though they had entered a fairyland.</p>

  <p>Under a willow tree sat a young man wearing a purple hat. In front of him was a string plucked instrument. He was plucking those strings gently with his slender fingers and a sad melody engulfed the air.</p>

  <p>Looking at the young man, Luo Zheng suddenly stopped. It was not that he was afraid of the young man. He could sense that the young man's strength was at the initial level of Illuminating Soul Realm at best. And Luo Zheng would certainly not take him seriously.</p>

  <p>It was the three people who were standing beside the young man that made Luo Zheng hesitate. Those men were clad with kohempcloth archer uniform. And they were wearing a black belt connected by white jade on their waists.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng could not figure out the real strength of these three men. He could only sense from the Mu Ning they were emitting that the strength of the two men standing on the side were relatively weaker. And the man who was standing in the middle was even stronger than Elder Xu, and among the masters Luo Zheng had seen, he might be only lesser to Kenneth.</p>

  <p>"I said it was okay, because I knew you would not be able to get me out of the Burning Sky Palace..." Mu Ning replied sweetly with a gentle smile.</p>
