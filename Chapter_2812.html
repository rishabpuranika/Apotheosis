<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2812 A Sea Of Crimson Magma </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The woman charged towards Samuel. With the brown energy gathered in her hand that turned into a long saber, she slashed him in a flash.</p>

  <p>The strike was quick and fierce, taking Samuel by surprise. It was too late when he realized that the blade had already pricked his skin.</p>

  <p>The force of primitive fear took over Samuel in an instant, its effect stunning him in place.</p>

  <p>During this critical moment, he gritted his teeth and activated the Spear of Supreme Harmony.</p>

  <p>The spear carried him away, leaving a few streaks of blood flowing on the woman's long brown saber.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, Samuel was carried over ten thousand feet away from where he had been. Putting his finger on the wound, he tried to extract the force of primitive fear in his body. Staring at the woman, he shouted, "We are not enemies. Why did you attack me?"</p>

  <p>Right now, the only thing he feared the most was his clone.</p>

  <p>The Grand Teleportation could move the Holy Beings to any places as they wished, making it impossible for them to kill each other.</p>

  <p>It was conceivable that Samuel, with the use of his Spear of Supreme Harmony, had gotten the edge on the others.</p>

  <p>In the past, he couldn't resist so many Holy Beings, but now he was able to make the two girls his best weapons.</p>

  <p>The only problem was, his clone also had a Spear of Supreme Harmony.</p>

  <p>Staring coldly at Samuel from far away, the woman called out, "You shouldn't have killed Zheng!"</p>

  <p>"Zheng?" Samuel was a little surprised. Although the woman had always protected Zheng, he didn't think he was important. After thinking for a moment, he replied, "Zheng is just another consummate True God. Why should I care if he dies?"</p>

  <p>Just now, more than a dozen consummate True Gods were already killed by Samuel.</p>

  <p>The woman couldn't hide the anger flashing on her face upon hearing Samuel's answer. "For you, he may just be an ordinary consummate True God, but for me, he is very important!"</p>

  <p>The next second, Samuel's clone stretched out his arm, waving his Spear of Supreme Harmony.</p>

  <p>From not so far away, an arc-shaped space channel was shrouded in ice flowers. With a thud sound, those fatal ice flowers spread along the space channel to cover Samuel.</p>

  <p>Noticing that the situation was unfavorable for him, Samuel immediately activated the Spear of Supreme Harmony again, disappearing from his current position. As soon as he appeared again, he continued, "I control the secret of the reincarnation. If you give me enough time, I will be able to find Zheng's Memory Flame. If you stop attacking me, I promise to bring him back to life."</p>

  <p>Samuel was no longer fully confident that he would win, so he tried to sue for peace.</p>

  <p>But the woman shook her head and replied, "What I want is Zheng's blood, not his memories. Now that he's dead, the Nine Li race has no descendants."</p>

  <p>The Nine Li race's blood...</p>

  <p>A bitter taste rose from Samuel's throat as he didn't expect that this woman would care about it so much.</p>

  <p>Nicholas' eyes flashed. Clasping his hands, he said in a clear voice, "You're wrong. There is still one descendant of the Nine Li race left in the divine land. Even if Zheng is dead now, the Nine Li race still has another descendant."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" The woman seemed confused. She turned her eyes to Nicholas, waiting for an explanation.</p>

  <p>Nicholas answered, "A member of the Nine Li race is still alive."</p>

  <p>"Who?" she asked again.</p>

  <p>Pointing at Samuel, Nicholas suggested with a grin, "Let's work together to kill him before we discuss it. What do you think?"</p>

  <p>He thought that this could be an opportunity.</p>

  <p>But he couldn't tell this woman about Lorena.</p>

  <p>Although he had treated Lorena with great respect in the past years, Lorena had always been cold to him.</p>

  <p>This woman appeared to be so loyal to the Nine Li race. It was likely to bring more trouble if Nicholas told her about Lorena now.</p>

  <p>The woman looked suspiciously at Nicholas. Although she did not completely trust him, she saw hope knock on her door. As she couldn't leave the Abyss Demon Region for so many years, perhaps there were some news that she did not know of. Maybe the situation of Nine Li race was not what she had imagined.</p>

  <p>Anyway, she must kill Samuel.</p>

  <p>Samuel's clone, who now stood behind her, brandished the Spear of Supreme Harmony in his hand, creating several space channels.</p>

  <p>Some of these space channels directly enveloped the other Holy Beings' clones, while some were connected to the blue-eyed girl.</p>

  <p>Seeing what was happening, Samuel's eyes froze. He then quickly thrust out the Spear of Supreme Harmony in his hand.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>He just made the space within dozens of miles in the void abnormally complicated.</p>

  <p>Some space channels led directly to the ice flowers or the sea of fire, while some people were flying in others. Samuel, the woman and the Holy Beings' clones appeared every once in a while but then disappeared weirdly.</p>

  <p>Their movements were too swift for the naked eye to see.</p>

  <p>Although the two sides hadn't fought yet, everyone had that strange feeling of an impending crisis.</p>

  <p>Two Holy Beings' clones, who entered the space channel, fell into the sea of fire on the other side. After being wrapped by the red lotuses, they were finally burnt to ashes.</p>

  <p>Now, it was Nicholas and his group's turn to watch the fight on the sidelines.</p>

  <p>The sea of fire raged continuously.</p>

  <p>Each of the red lotuses blossomed into blazing flames one after another.</p>

  <p>The red-eyed girl floated in the flames, staring at the scene not far away with her big eyes.</p>

  <p>Watching the scene drew all her curiosity.</p>

  <p>She could see Zheng's body bathed in a golden light.</p>

  <p>The golden vortexes enveloped all the flames released by the red lotuses.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you my food?" the red-eyed girl asked.</p>

  <p>In her perspective, all the things in this world could be converted into energy, which she could then accelerate to the extreme to make the beautiful red lotuses.</p>

  <p>There shouldn't be any exception in the entire divine land. Also, she was born to do this.</p>

  <p>However, before she left her "home", she saw an exception - this young man in front of her.</p>

  <p>He was shining with golden light, unafraid of the red lotuses. Instead, he was eating them.</p>

  <p>The red-eyed girl could not obtain external information. Since her intelligence was only made up from fragmented information, she made her strange judgment just by watching Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Why are you swallowing these red lotuses? Are we of the same kind?" she asked, confused.</p>

  <p>Zheng did not seem to hear her.</p>

  <p>Being burnt by the fire, the Sanskrit words started a magical reaction again.</p>

  <p>He then found himself in the sea.</p>

  <p>It was a sea of crimson magma.</p>

  <p>The sea undulated in front of Zheng, sending off mysterious auras. He stared at it and wondered, "These auras seem very similar to the Truth of Godly Way. But at the same time, they are quite different. Am I at the Sea of Truth?"</p>

  <p>Zheng shook his head.</p>

  <p>Back when he was cultivating the Truth of Cultivation Nature, he could vaguely sense the existence of the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>With that being said, he had a completely different perception of how the Sea of Truth would be like. It wasn't the same as the one right in front of him now.</p>
