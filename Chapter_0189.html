<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 189 The Killing Intention (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Despite her recent actions, Nina looked calm and even sported a sneer.</p>

  <p>The female disciple did not open her mouth to speak while she stood beside Luo Luo Zheng. As long as he was nearby, she could feel a sense of security, which was reassuring.</p>

  <p>Those who came from noble clans rarely fought each other, as they were often aware of the other clan's strength. It was why they were cautious whenever they met someone from another noble clan.</p>

  <p>However, the woman from Zhu Clan startled him with her reckless behavior. Josef had not planned to fight, but she tried to destroy him by releasing the Shock Dragon. Had he failed to evade the attack, it would have been the end of him!</p>

  <p>Enraged by her audacity, Josef said, "I don't care who you are. Because of what you did, I will make sure you die today. No. I will make you serve my brothers in the army, and then kill you! You, and you, both of you get over here this instant. I am afraid there are demons lurking around. Kill all the resisters!"</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng appeared to be calm after hearing the counselor's commands, there was a distinctive murderous glint in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Indeed, Luo Luo Zheng hesitated a little in the beginning. He did not wish to go up against Josef and all the people who chose to fall for the latter's deception. On the other hand, that did not mean that he was afraid of them.</p>

  <p>After all, the opponent was an army man, and they were in White Emperor City.</p>

  <p>If it were up to him, he wouldn't resort to an aggressive solution like fighting. In fact, he preferred Lenard's approach earlier. He almost subdued Josef by merely making him doubt his own judgments.</p>

  <p>Alas, Josef's commands made it clear that some people were going to get hurt today. Nonviolent resolutions were out of the question, and Luo Luo Zheng saw no way of changing that.</p>

  <p>Anyone who knew him would know that his calm appearance was only a cover-up for the rage that was consuming his heart.</p>

  <p>In a steady manner, Luo Luo Zheng took one light step forward as though he were drifting.</p>

  <p>When his right foot touched the ground, the power of more than a hundred dragon scales in his mind burst out.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, when he deliberately reversed the tip of his foot, an immense power erupted from the ground.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>With Luo Zheng's foot tip being the center of a circle, the hard ground started to split open and spread rapidly. A huge crack spread across the whole floor of the room, and then it crossed the wall. It even reached all the way up the roof.</p>

  <p>With great force, Luo Luo Zheng shot himself towards Josef like an off-string arrow.</p>

  <p>The two guards on both sides of Josef were the quickest to react. Upon seeing Luo Zheng's powerful and explosive force at high speed, their expressions changed.</p>

  <p>After all, he was only half-step into the nature level. No matter how powerful his strength was, it was limited. After the two made meaningful eye contact, they blocked Luo Luo Zheng from reaching Josef as though they were two gates.</p>

  <p>After facing Luo Zheng's power, the two did not dare to disregard it. They activated the life vitality all over their body and exerted the life vitality to create two khaki shields.</p>

  <p>The two guards had plenty of combat experience, and their cultivation methods were superior. The khaki shields they made with the life vitality were not eye-catching but could repel the attack of the demon general.</p>

  <p>They thought, 'It must be more than enough to block this bloke. He dashes at such a high speed. At this point, only the anti-seismic force is enough to stop him!'</p>

  <p>"Get out!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng dashed in front of them and swung his fists to punch the khaki shields.</p>

  <p>His fists nearly pierced the life vitality shields, but not as much as he had wanted. Each of the shields had a thickness of three inches. As they were made from the life vitality, they decreased the hardness on purpose to effectively dissolve most of the opponent's power.</p>

  <p>These life vitality shields were truly effective!</p>

  <p>Even when Luo Luo Zheng exhausted all the power of the dragon scales in his mind, he still could not break the shields.</p>

  <p>However... an idea came to him.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng realized that he could not break the life vitality shields with his strength, two wisps of demonic life energy arose in his fists.</p>

  <p>When the demonic life energy soared into the life vitality shields, it was as though cold water was poured on the boiling oil. The demonic life energy swallowed and transformed the two life vitality shields rapidly.</p>

  <p>The expressions of the two soldiers changed instantly. When they saw the dark purple life energy, they knew they were in trouble. Afraid that they might come in contact with it, they let go of the shields.</p>

  <p>Being on the battlefield all year long, the two soldiers' instinct saved them this time. If they had not released their grip, the demonic life energy would have swallowed their corporeal bodies quickly.</p>

  <p>But the two who just lost the protection of the life vitality shields were now destined to face Luo Zheng's fists directly.</p>

  <p>"Bang! Bang!"</p>

  <p>While they were off their guard, Luo Luo Zheng punched the two defenseless soldiers in the chest. Both soldiers ended up flying backward like the off-string kites.</p>

  <p>When he threw the punch, he did not apply all his strength. After all, the two were just under Josef's orders, and it was not all their fault. They did not deserve to die.</p>

  <p>When the two soldiers were defeated, there was no one else to defend Josef from him.</p>

  <p>As soon as Josef realized this, he wore an unreadable expression. It appeared as though he was assessing his situation.</p>

  <p>He was a warrior at the grade six of nature level, but his abilities were cultivated depending on the pills. Unfortunately, he did not possess an astounding physical strength. The counselor was only good at strategy and military science.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, he was more than aware of the strength of his two guards.</p>

  <p>When they fought together, they could bring down four demon generals.</p>

  <p>No matter how much Josef thought about it, he couldn't justify how Luo Luo Zheng defeated the two guards so easily.</p>

  <p>When Yale warned him not to underestimate Luo Luo Zheng and not to see him as a refiner half-step into the nature level, he thought his plan was more than enough for a single prisoner.</p>

  <p>Based on his warnings, Josef thought two guards was all it would take to defeat the man.</p>

  <p>Alas, Luo Zheng's strength was beyond Josef's expectation.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Josef was at a loss. He could do nothing else but take a step back!</p>

  <p>Filled with inexplicable fear, the counselor fled from the fight. As a desperate attempt in causing a diversion, he threw willow leaf darts at his opponent while running away.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did not take the willow leaf darts seriously, and let the counselor shoot them. Then, with these sharp darts going in his direction, he rushed towards Josef without batting an eye.</p>
