  <p>
</p>

  <p>By then, the Celestial Spear had returned to its peak, capable of increasing Zheng's strength ninefold.</p>

  <p>If Zheng now went all out and unleashed two hundred thousand divine megatons of force, the blow would be as powerful as one million eight hundred thousand divine megatons of force; a truly terrifying figure.</p>

  <p>But he only had one shot at it and so had to be very precise.</p>

  <p>He exercised great patience when fighting the fox girl and now he waited for his final opening!</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>The power of two hundred thousand divine megatons surged along his arms like a vigorous tide.</p>

  <p>The Chaotic Source Spirits could now only bear one hundred thousand divine megatons of force, while Zheng's physical body would have to bear the remaining one hundred thousand divine megatons of force. Consequently, one hundred thousand divine megatons was actually his body's limit.</p>

  <p>"Crack, crack, crack..."</p>

  <p>Faint cracking noises came from within him as he brandished the Celestial Spear.</p>

  <p>He was at his limit and his body was struggling to bear such great force and so thin cracks began appearing on his bones.</p>

  <p>If he remained in this extreme state for much longer, his body could collapse.</p>

  <p>But the Celestial Spear had already been drawn towards the fox girl.</p>

  <p>With two hundred thousand divine megatons of force contained in the attack, the Celestial Stone embedded in the tip of the spear emitted intense light and an indescribably heavy pressure was exerted on it.</p>

  <p>As Zheng waved the spear around, its shaft was pressed into the shape of a full moon.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>The Other Shore creatures felt a strong wind whip and cut at their faces.</p>

  <p>They tried to dodge the intense pain but there was nowhere in the room to escape to.</p>

  <p>From the very beginning, the fox girl had never viewed Zheng as her opponent, as capable of challenging her, and she certainly had never thought he would pull out a weapon such as this.</p>

  <p>The power she felt from the tip of the Celestial Spear changed everything and wiped a look of pure shock across her glazed face.</p>

  <p>She could not accurately deduce the Celestial Spear's power, but she knew that if she was hit by a strike from it, she would most definitely die.</p>

  <p>Her body was in an incredibly powerful state. Under normal circumstances it was impossible to break. But once the power climbed too high, breaking a single spot would shatter her entire body.</p>

  <p>Egan and Kirk were awestruck at what they saw. They hadn't expected Zheng to still have a trump card like this hidden up his sleeve.</p>

  <p>The Celestial Spear was about to strike the fox girl when suddenly, a huge hand drew a line into the No-break Maze. The line just so happened to be drawn in the room Zheng was in.</p>

  <p>The line was nothing but a black mark on the Eternal Scroll Painting. But in the room, between Zheng and the fox girl, a wall had been added, and the Celestial Spear carrying a power as high as one million eight hundred thousand divine megatons hit it.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>A deafening boom rang out and the entire No-break Maze trembled under the massive force. The two Evil Orochis blocking the way were rattled too.</p>

  <p>They held great power themselves and so any power stronger than theirs frightened them.</p>

  <p>The wall was unbreakable but still caved in from the extraordinary force.</p>

  <p>Even from above the Eternal Scroll Painting, the new line was curved.</p>

  <p>The crying face was not worried about it being smashed through though.</p>

  <p>All walls in the No-break Maze were a whole; unless the entire maze was erased, none of the walls would be destroyed.</p>

  <p>Zheng was stunned and frustrated that his strike had been blocked by a wall appearing out of the blue.</p>

  <p>Regardless of how it had appeared, he now had no other way to fight back against the fox girl.</p>

  <p>She had planned to close her eyes and wait for death to take her. The sudden appearance of the wall stunned her too. She raised an eyebrow and fell into deep thought.</p>

  <p>A few moments later, a murderous look appeared on her face. She moved around the wall in an attempt to get at Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng stepped back, gritting his teeth.</p>

  <p>The fox girl took two steps forward and another wall was placed in front of her.</p>

  <p>She refused to give up. She stepped back and tried going around the other side.</p>

  <p>"Swish!"</p>

  <p>A third wall appeared, completely blocking her off.</p>

  <p>The room was now divided into two. Once the fox girl accepted she was unable to enter the area Zheng was in, she helplessly exited the hexagram array and turned into a flat picture.</p>

  <p>She immediately looked up at the face in the sky, which was constantly changing between crying and smiling.</p>

  <p>"Master Brush-wielder! Why did you stop me from killing him?" the fox girl asked furiously.</p>

  <p>"Because you had already lost," said the smiling face calmly. "If I hadn't done something, he would have smashed you to bits."</p>

  <p>"Why not just help me?" she asked, still upset.</p>

  <p>"Hahaha..." the smiling face chuckled gloomily. "The reason I helped you in the first place was because I needed you to do something that was inconvenient for me to do myself, not because you needed help killing people in the passages. If all I want is death, I could do it myself."</p>

  <p>This revelation left the fox girl speechless.</p>

  <p>The face gave her and her companions everything they had. What it said made sense.</p>

  <p>But the fox girl was smart and quickly picked up on something. "No, you would not have paid so much attention to me just because you're worried about me!"</p>

  <p>There was no doubt about her strength. It was very unlikely she would encounter any danger she couldn't handle, so the brush-wielder would not need to pay so much attention to her. There was nothing he'd have to rescue her from.</p>

  <p>The only possibility that remained was that he was watching someone else.</p>

  <p>It was obvious: it was the human boy she had been fighting. The brush-wielder was concerned for his safety.</p>

  <p>Her guess was right. The brush-wielder's eyes never left Zheng. He wanted to test Zheng's limits and see how far he could go, but he had never imagined he would be able to kill the fox girl.</p>

  <p>At the critical moment, he stepped in and stopped the fight from continuing.</p>

  <p>"Why? Is he special?" inquired the fox girl curiously.</p>

  <p>"Yes," the smiling face replied.</p>

  <p>"Is it possible that he may enter the final room?" The fox girl's attitude had now shifted.</p>

  <p>"At the least, he passed your test," said the smiling face, turning into a crying face but still with an unusually happy voice.</p>

  <p>The fox girl fell silent for a moment, feeling that the brush-wielder seemed to be acting reasonably.</p>

  <p>If she put aside his abnormal behavior of silently protecting Zheng, she had to admit that the human had indeed defeated her and was even about to kill her.</p>

  <p>"All I know is that he is one we have waited for, but whether he is able to reach the end, I'm unsure," said the crying face slowly. "When all is said and done, he is the most likely to reach the end. So, according to our agreement, you will have to talk with him."</p>

  <p>"Got it, sir."</p>

  <p>The fox girl lay in the Eternal Scroll Painting and returned to the room.</p>

  <p>Zheng and the others were unable to leave because of the several walls that had been put into place.</p>

  <p>They had no idea what was going on and were all worried about what would happen to them.</p>

  <p>They were lost in thought when the sound of something being erased scratched in all their ears and the walls quickly vanished before their eyes.</p>

  <p>The disappearance of the walls displeased them as the fox girl stood in front of them once more.</p>
