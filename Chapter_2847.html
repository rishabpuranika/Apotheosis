<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng openly stared at the half-dead man for a moment and silently searched for the familiarity he had before, in his heart.</p>

  <p>There were really times when Zheng himself was totally confused.</p>

  <p>Was his father the man in front of him? He tried hard, searching for his memories of him, but everything seemed blurry.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>Before Zheng could do anything, Lorena had already taken a big stride towards Mike and wordlessly took him into her arms.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>A sound reverberated at the moment she embraced Mike. The array around him reacted.</p>

  <p>And an abnormally powerful force surged at Mike.</p>

  <p>"It's soul suppression," exclaimed Sword Chen as he wrinkled his brows.</p>

  <p>It was by no means easy to suppress a Holy Being, especially a powerful one like Mike.</p>

  <p>A cold light flashed in Lorena's eyes. She was about to destroy the visible array in prison. There was a hint of impatience in her demeanor.</p>

  <p>"No! No, don't do that. If you destroy the array, Mike will die immediately,"</p>

  <p>Pierson hastily cautioned. He stood still at the gate, looking so anxious.</p>

  <p>Apparently, it was the array that kept Mike alive all this time.</p>

  <p>"What to do then?" Lorena countered back in a cold voice. She refused defeat in not knowing what they should do to bring him back to life.</p>

  <p>"I will remove the soul suppression," suggested Pierson.</p>

  <p>Then, he decisively sauntered towards the edge of the array. Wordlessly, he stretched out his hand into the array and started manipulating it.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>With the sudden contact, the array on the ground created a quick flash, and the force suppressing Mike's soul gradually disappeared.</p>

  <p>The instant the force swiftly dissipated, Mike's body soon started to shake violently, making them feel more anxious as moments went by.</p>

  <p>After a short while, Mike finally woke up. With a blank look in his eyes, he merely stared at Lorena's face for a long time, not uttering a single word as his eyes were getting brighter and brighter. All the people surrounding him couldn't help waiting, with great anticipation mixed with anxiety.</p>

  <p>"Lorena... Is it really you? Am I dreaming?"</p>

  <p>A soft mumble came from Mike's throat, almost a whisper.</p>

  <p>He had been imprisoned over the years, and his vital energy had been notably weak. Even his soul had decayed after being suppressed for such a long time.</p>

  <p>"My dear..." Silent tears swiftly rolled down from Lorena's eyes. "No, you are not dreaming. Nicholas has been killed, and his universe has also collapsed."</p>

  <p>A bright burst of light flashed in Mike's eyes, and instantly his voice became more powerful. "Really? Nicholas is dead? Who killed him?"</p>

  <p>Although Lorena was crying, a gratified smile gently appeared on the corner of her mouth. She looked up at Zheng who was beside the door of the prison and prompted, "It is your son, no, our son."</p>

  <p>Almost exhausted, Mike tried hard raising his head and gazed at the entrance of the prison.</p>

  <p>"Crack..."</p>

  <p>He hadn't moved for many years. So the moment he raised his head, his back spine naturally made a series of strange sounds.</p>

  <p>"Father..."</p>

  <p>Zheng called out earnestly. Excitement filled his mind.</p>

  <p>At the first sight of Mike, he quite felt he was a stranger to him.</p>

  <p>Staring at him, he couldn't link the man in front of him with his father.</p>

  <p>In his impression, his father was full of vitality and had broad shoulders, unlike this man before him now.</p>

  <p>As he observed Mike intently, the expression in the other's eyes finally reminded him of his father. Though he could vaguely recall it, there was a resemblance.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Zheng hurriedly strode over and quickly knelt on one knee in front of his father.</p>

  <p>Like him, Mike also gazed at his son with a pleasant smile on his lips. He nodded slightly and said, "After we parted from each other when you were a child, it's not our first meeting."</p>

  <p>"Right. I once saw you in the Evolutionary Universe," Zheng shared.</p>

  <p>Mike took a deep breath and replied, "Good. When Bromley proposed the idea, I had a bit doubt that you would make it, but it turns out that you have done better than I thought."</p>

  <p>The plan that Mike, Bromley, and Holy Jay made was more like a desperate attempt than a hope. They really had no choice but to take the risk.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng's performance far exceeded the expectations of everyone. It was unmatched in comparison to anyone.</p>

  <p>Even Harold hadn't thought that Zheng would kill Nicholas in the Abyss Demon Region by accident.</p>

  <p>Zheng firmly held Mike's rough hand and blurted excitedly, "I never forget what you taught me when I was young."</p>

  <p>Mike gently shook his head, and sympathetically said, "It's tough for you. I wish I could make you a carefree playboy on the Floating Island, just like those powerful clans. But you were born with countless adversity and tortures in your life. Don't blame me."</p>

  <p>"How could I blame you?" Zheng uttered in a voice soft with affection after becoming speechless for a moment when he heard how regretful his father was.</p>

  <p>From the Eastern Region to here, Zheng had indeed suffered a lot.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, the trial was some excellent training. He was like a raw jade that finally turned into a sharp sword after all series of hardships he met along the way.</p>

  <p>As the family of three gathered inside the prison, they couldn't help but reminisce about the past as they talked in a low voice. They all sighed with deep emotion.</p>

  <p>Five minutes later, Mike suddenly urged, "Lorena, kill me."</p>

  <p>Lorena was surprised at his unexpected request. "Why?"</p>

  <p>"My body has already become decadent and it is hard to repair. Better to be reborn in the universe. In that case, I will be able to recover quickly," he explained reflectively, making an effort to sound reassuring.</p>

  <p>In addition to that, there were still memories of his soul in the universe. He was going to find them bit by bit.</p>

  <p>Lorena pursed her lips and hesitated. Her eyes danced with slight helplessness.</p>

  <p>Although she fully knew that killing him was only for bringing him back to life, she couldn't bear to end his life with her own hands.</p>

  <p>She immediately averted her gaze from Mike. She cast a glance at Zheng, who, like her, was also hesitant.</p>

  <p>"Let me do it, Master," suggested Sword Chen with a casual smile on his face as he hastily stepped forward. "At most, Harold will blame me."</p>

  <p>Mike trained his gaze at Sword Chen and then towards Tianming, who was standing not far away. He nodded with a smile.</p>

  <p>He was the one who created the two, so he was very familiar with them.</p>

  <p>Soon after, without an ounce of hesitation, Sword Chen brandished his sword to slash the light that immediately broke the array in prison.</p>

  <p>The broken array could no longer give Mike life energy. So he quickly lost his breath and died.</p>

  <p>Lorena snapped back from her daze and carefully put Mike's body in the Sumeru Space. The dead body wasn't Mike any more. The real Mike would be reborn in the Evolutionary Universe, but she wouldn't just leave the dead body here.</p>

  <p>After she had done putting away the dead body, she glanced at Pierson and stated coldly, "Zheng, let's go!"</p>

  <p>Pierson, on the other hand, finally felt relieved when Lorena and her companions started leaving.</p>

  <p>He definitely feared that this group of fierce people would destroy the Ray Tree in a fit of anger after witnessing Mike's tragic plight.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the bottom of the Abyss Demon Region was continually roaring.</p>

  <p>"Rumble..."</p>

  <p>Then a lofty palace rose from the ground like a fast-growing tree.</p>

  <p>The fiends below were all ashen with fear, having no idea what was going on. They were all startled.</p>

  <p>"That woman has left, hasn't she?" someone exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"What about the others? Is there anyone still in the ice palace?" interjected by another.</p>

  <p>"Who is it? How powerful this person is to build this palace in this way!"</p>

  <p>All the fiends looked up and incessantly discussed among themselves.</p>
