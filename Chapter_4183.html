  <p>
</p>

  <p>Duran didn't treat the Evil God as a subordinate, but actually viewed him as a partner.</p>

  <p>Since he was talking to a partner, he felt the need to display the true strength of the Bird Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>Duran felt quite confident. After all, the Evil God had no choice but to cooperate with the Bird Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>"The Bird Spirit King... You said there are four kings. Then, who are the other two?" the Evil God asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"The Human Spirit King and the Snake Spirit King," Duran answered.</p>

  <p>Then, his eyes grew misty. "The four sects were a family many years ago..."</p>

  <p>Usually, it would take a long time to tell the entire story of the Four Spirits Sect.</p>

  <p>However, Duran took only around five minutes to give a brief overview of the history of the Four Spirits Sect to the Evil God.</p>

  <p>When he had finished, the Evil God's eyes lit up with interest. "But since your Bird Spirit Sect has been annihilated by the Snake Spirit Sect, you should take revenge. Why do you want to destroy everything instead?"</p>

  <p>"This is the wish of our king. We have to fulfill it," said Duran. All the birds were extremely loyal to their ruler.</p>

  <p>The Evil God didn't reply.</p>

  <p>After seizing control of the Source World, the Evil God felt no need to destroy it all.</p>

  <p>In the past, he had been alone. With his difficult personality, he made too many enemies, so he ended up cooperating with the Nihility race and then later joined the Black Ship.</p>

  <p>But once he became the ruler of the Source World, his thoughts somewhat changed. At the very least, he no longer followed the Nihility Way.</p>

  <p>But now, he was reliant on the Bird Spirit Sect. No matter how arrogant he was, he knew he couldn't oppose the Bird Spirit King's wish, especially not in front of Duran.</p>

  <p>"I once defeated a little black snake in the consciousness of the Source World. Did he come from the Snake Spirit Sect?" The Evil God suddenly recalled.</p>

  <p>When he found out that there was an intruder in the consciousness of the Source World, he had been quite puzzled.</p>

  <p>Theoretically, only he was supposed to be able to enter that place. What kind of theurgy did the little black snake possess to forcefully enter it?</p>

  <p>"Yes, it's very likely it was the Snake Spirit King himself," replied Duran.</p>

  <p>"Occupying the Source World was originally a part of the Snake Spirit Sect's plan, but you ruined it."</p>

  <p>The corners of the Evil God's mouth curled up in amusement as he heard this.</p>

  <p>"That's why the chaos was attacked," said Duran.</p>

  <p>"You mean these heads?" the Evil God asked, his smile instantly wiped from his face.</p>

  <p>Duran nodded. "Yes. The Snake Spirit King has begun a new round of world downgrading. It is to constantly devour these heads in order to expand the Source World, till it grows to be around the size of the chaos."</p>

  <p>"Oh?" The Evil God's eyebrows shot up, as his interest was piqued once more. "Expand the Source World to the size of the chaos?"</p>

  <p>"Right. Maybe it will be even larger than the chaos, and expand to an unimaginable size..." Duran said.</p>

  <p>"How does one devour these heads?" the Evil God asked.</p>

  <p>Duran smiled. "Just smash the heads in the Source World. You've already devoured lots of heads. Didn't you notice the changes in the Source World?"</p>

  <p>"Changes?"</p>

  <p>The Evil God closed his eyes gently and entered the consciousness of the Source World.</p>

  <p>The Source World was too vast. Although he had devoured a lot of heads, the Source World was so large that he hadn't noticed the small change before.</p>

  <p>After carefully examining the Source World, the Evil God slowly opened his eyes wide. "The Source World has actually expanded by about ten percent!"</p>

  <p>The Evil God grew excited. This speed of expansion was actually quite terrifying.</p>

  <p>He didn't expect that devouring the heads would have such benefits.</p>

  <p>"There is only one Source World in the chaos... So, are you saying the chaos will also belong to me in the future?" the Evil God asked pointedly.</p>

  <p>Duran shook his head. "There is only one Source World, but there are several primitive lands. Since the Snake Spirit King has begun the downgrading, he will definitely use another primitive land. Therefore, you have to devour as many heads as possible, because there will inevitably be a battle between your Source World and the Snake Spirit King's primitive land, and only one primitive land will be left in the end."</p>

  <p>"There will be a battle..." the Evil God echoed mindlessly. Lowering his head, he was lost in thought for a while. Zheng suddenly came to mind.</p>

  <p>If these heads were all over the chaos, it would be difficult for the Pear Hill to escape. Was this the end for Zheng?</p>

  <p>The Evil God had always regarded Zheng as his ultimate opponent. Now that the Snake Spirit King had suddenly entered the picture, he felt somewhat regretful.</p>

  <p>"You must win this battle. Don't worry, the Nihility race and the Bird Spirit Sect will help you."</p>

  <p>After saying that, Duran exited the Source World.</p>

  <p>One day later, the Evil God ordered the transformation of the Source World.</p>

  <p>Over ten thousand avatars desperately racked their brains to try to come up with a new plan quickly.</p>

  <p>They planned to create three huge cracks at the edge of the Source World, each of which spanning hundreds of large provinces. Within each crack, they would arrange huge magic arrays in the provinces.</p>

  <p>Once the heads in the chaos were lured into the cracks, the arrays would be activated to immediately kill those heads.</p>

  <p>This plan was exactly the same as the Snake Spirit King's.</p>

  <p>And it all went very smoothly. However, the Evil God was visibly depressed these days.</p>

  <p>Even Edna couldn't figure out what was going on in his mind. Nothing she said could comfort him.</p>

  <p>One day, the Evil God was staring blankly at the sky in the distance when someone suddenly draped a robe over his shoulders. Frowning slightly, he asked in an annoyed tone, "What are you doing here?"</p>

  <p>The figure standing behind him was not Edna, but Shera.</p>

  <p>Ever since Edna came, the Evil God rarely ever talked to Shera.</p>

  <p>This saddened Shera greatly, but she didn't show it. After all, she was still the liaison between the Evil God and the Nihility race.</p>

  <p>"I know why you are unhappy," said Shera, eyes flashing.</p>

  <p>The Evil God glanced at her indifferently. "What do you know?"</p>

  <p>Shera leaned down to whisper in his ear, "You think you have lost Zheng, your opponent."</p>

  <p>The Evil God didn't say anything. Instead, he just let out a heavy sigh.</p>

  <p>"He might not die. Perhaps, just like you, he is rapidly growing," said Shera.</p>

  <p>The Evil God raised his eyebrows and turned around abruptly to stare at Shera. "What do you mean?" he demanded. "Can the Pear Hill escape this disaster?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know for sure," said Shera. "But there is one thing I am certain of.</p>

  <p>You should have been born in a primitive land. Otherwise, you wouldn't be able to devour Usman, nor would you be able to obtain the consciousness of the Source World."</p>

  <p>The Evil God's eyes lit up excitedly. "You mean that Zheng's inner world is a primitive land?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Shera with a nod.</p>

  <p>When the Evil God had been absorbed by Zheng, Shera and the brass man had already suspected this, but she was not so sure at that time.</p>

  <p>However, when the Evil God successfully devoured Usman, she was certain.</p>

  <p>As the Evil God heard this, his expression suddenly relaxed. Smiling confidently, he said, "I'll definitely win this competition."</p>
