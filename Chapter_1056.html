<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The many powerful masters at the Soul Sea Realm who were trapped in the Bewitching Domain felt their hearts beating rapidly at first. However, they soon returned to normal.</p>

  <p>Powerful warriors at the Soul Sea Realm fought differently from ordinary warriors. Their fights started with the suppression of each other's domains, and this was followed by the collision with life vitality and physical bodies.</p>

  <p>A domain's impact on a martial artist's strength was enormous, and each martial artist's domain was different.</p>

  <p id="top">Some warriors' domains could be very aggressive to the point of being insane and indomitable, while some other warriors' domains only played a subsidiary role.</p>

  <p>The Bewitching Domain of Master Wallace could disrupt his opponent's state of mind. His domain could cause a huge change in the mind of a powerful warrior at the Soul Sea Realm in a one-on-one fight. It could make the opponent extremely irritable for a short time and make it hard for him to draw out his strength.</p>

  <p>However, there were nine powerful masters of the Soul Sea Realm in Master Wallace's domain. As the Bewitching Domain was spread across the nine of them, its impact would be reduced and wouldn't be much of a threat.</p>

  <p>Miguel gently waved both of his hands within Master Wallace's domain, sending out colorful strips, which spread out in spirals. These colorful spirals spun around Miguel several times, and then suddenly shone with rays of dazzling light. Miguel looked like a small sun, shining so brightly that nobody could even open their eyes.</p>

  <p>"A domain that can disrupt one's mind? That is quite interesting, but it's too weak. Ha-ha!"</p>

  <p>Miguel's confident voice rang out from the light!</p>

  <p>The Purple Heart Sacred Place of the human race was a low-ranked sacred place in the Sea God Continent, but it didn't mean that the elite martial artists of the human race were weak, because otherwise the Purple Heart Sacred Place would have been destroyed long ago.</p>

  <p>The human race would have been wiped out of the Sea God Continent for good, but they were able to sustain until now, largely due to the fact that they had relied on these three top-notch masters of the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>Miguel's strength might be inferior to that of Amber's, as well as that of the leaders of the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place, but it was significant enough to make him enter into the top ten rankings of the Sea God Continent!</p>

  <p>"Soul Division Domain!"</p>

  <p>The way the Soul Sea Realm's domain worked was that one could use one's own strength to carve out one's own territory. By relying on one's own strength, one could change the rules of the domain within a limited range!</p>

  <p>This was also what was called "snatching a turf from the world".</p>

  <p>Of course, the Soul Sea Realm's domain had a limited range of influence, and the changeable rules were also relatively limited.</p>

  <p>If the domain's influence could be spread throughout the entire universe and the rules could be changed as per one's will, then the cultivator would gain control of the natural law of the heavens.</p>

  <p>Miguel's Soul Division Domain was able to create countless souls within the range that was covered by the light.</p>

  <p>Countless Miguels appeared in the shining light. It looked like there was an army of thousands of Miguels!</p>

  <p>As soon as they appeared, these souls began to surround Master Wallace.</p>

  <p>Master Wallace was shocked to see this aggressive group of souls rushing towards him. He tapped the top of his head gently and an eye appeared above his head. Just looking at the eye could make people feel suffocated.</p>

  <p>"Evil Eye Flame! Kill them all!"</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Flames flickering with an illusory luster shot out from the eye. This Evil Eye also had great origins. Normally Master Wallace would not use it to fight his enemy. Now that he was in great danger, he employed it without hesitation.</p>

  <p>The flames were indeed very powerful. The sea of flames that shot out from the eye were able to restrain Miguel's souls. As the flames swept through, over a thousand souls instantly burned into nothingness!</p>

  <p>"Not bad. But what a pity� It is far from enough." Miguel was certain that he could beat Master Wallace. He had personally come to the Central Region on Zheng's invitation and certainly had some skills to show.</p>

  <p>Miguel was almost invincible in his Soul Division Domain. The only way to defeat him was if some more powerful master could kill all the souls at the same time. Then he might be able to force Miguel's true body to appear.</p>

  <p>But Master Wallace was no match as he certainly couldn't do that.</p>

  <p>Miguel's souls kept coming at Master Wallace nonstop. All the souls had a faint smile on the faces. He gently pinched his fingers, and a wave of formless energy emitted from him.</p>

  <p>Miguel was like an ancient sacred emperor at that moment. He exuded the Mu Ning of a supreme ruler of the heavens and the earth!</p>

  <p>"Emperor Destruction Finger!"</p>

  <p>Only those in the Soul Sea Realm could become emperors!</p>

  <p>But in general, the war kings and war emperors only existed within the four divine kingdoms.</p>

  <p>There were many sacred places on the Sea God Continent but there wasn't a tradition of setting up monarchy. However, this didn't mean that they didn't have the ability to establish their own kingdoms and have an extremely powerful person as their emperor!</p>

  <p>Over ten thousand souls of Miguel suddenly erupted with a power so violent it felt like it could annihilate all lives in the heavens and on earth. It shot fiercely towards Master Wallace. Every single beam of light that shot out from a soul was equal to one-thousandth of Miguel's strength. With the tens of thousands of beams of light shooting out, Miguel's strength was amplified ten times.</p>

  <p>In other words, Master Wallace had to fend attacks from ten Miguels at the same time. Such formidable strength was unimaginable and unbeatable!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stood atop the walls of Oracle City and watched this scene with gleaming eyes. The opportunity to observe a battle between the masters of Soul Sea Realm was a blessing for him.</p>

  <p>'Is this the power of the domain?'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng thought in a daze�</p>

  <p>If he could step into the Soul Sea Realm in the future and create a domain, what would his domain be like? Would it be comparable to Miguel's domain?</p>

  <p>This was an opportunity for Luo Zheng as well as for the many martial artists in Oracle City to study domains.</p>

  <p>A fight between the masters at Soul Sea Realm could affect a large area.</p>

  <p>Although other warriors at the Soul Sea Realm were guarding the area, there was no guarantee that fighters would always be able to contain their energy within the range. If the formidable energy waves accidentally came out of the domains, it could vaporize the entire Oracle City.</p>

  <p>Still, the warriors of the World Commercial Alliance risked their lives to observe the battle in the sky.</p>

  <p>It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to witness such a high-level battle!</p>

  <p>As the martial artists saw the scene of how these masters fought, their bodies trembled in anticipation. Those martial artists whose warrior spirit was not strong enough would not be able to watch the fight, as they would be worried that their generation wouldn't be able to reach this height. It would frustrate them.</p>

  <p>But the eyes of those martial artists who had a positive attitude glistened in excitement. They hoped that one day they would be able to go through life and death crises and enter the Soul Sea Realm and obtain such formidable powers!</p>

  <p>This was the effect of cultivation on the warrior spirit! It could make positive people want to pursue higher goals!</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>A small sun once again appeared in the sky with an explosion. The sound was dull and distant, spreading over a thousand miles.</p>

  <p>As the light gradually dispersed, a small boy appeared once again. Master Wallace had hidden himself in a small turtle shell just before the Emperor Destruction Finger was about to hit him.</p>

  <p>The turtle shell was emerald green, as if it was made out of a large piece of jade. It looked incredibly beautiful.</p>

  <p>It was this gorgeous turtle shell that had resisted Miguel's massive attacks.</p>

  <p>But Master Wallace was still in a miserable state despite being hidden in the turtle shell. His face took on a scary dark red color. Obviously, he had suffered great injuries.</p>

  <p>Miguel was surprised to see that Master Wallace had withstood his attacks.</p>

  <p>The Central Region was weaker than the Sea God Continent, but the inheritances of a divine kingdom were stronger than those of the Sea God Continent!</p>

  <p>If it weren't for the turtle shell, Master Wallace would have been instantly obliterated by Miguel.</p>

  <p>"Humph, I am determined to fight you to the finish!" Master Wallace spoke to Miguel through gritted teeth.</p>

  <p>"Fight me?" Miguel smirked, "Or us?"</p>

  <p>Master Wallace thought he would have a one-on-one fight with him. Miguel was confident of defeating him, but it was very difficult for one master at the Soul Sea Realm to kill another in a one-on-one battle. Moreover, Miguel didn't want Master Wallace to escape by using some tricks.</p>

  <p>The domains of several other powerful masters at the Soul Sea Realm began to inch towards Master Wallace.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Master Wallace's heart sank. Now he was surely doomed...</p>

  <p>He had ambitiously set out from the York Divine Kingdom and traversed the Chaotic Ocean of Stars in high spirits and hopes. He never thought that the Central Region would become the place where he breathed his last.</p>

  <p>All the powerful masters at the Soul Sea Realm attacked at the same time.</p>

  <p>Different domains entwined with each other, firmly trapping Master Wallace and Master Abraham within. For a moment, loud explosions burst forth from the sky, sending shivers down onlookers' spines.</p>

  <p>The two mighty warriors at the Soul Sea Realm from the York Divine Kingdom finally perished with the nine powerful masters from the Sea God Continent ganging up on them. Dillon and the others, who were watching the battle from Oracle City, couldn't help but shake their heads. It was such a pity that powerful figures, who had the ability to become emperors, were killed just like that.</p>
