  <p>
</p>

  <p>Somehow, they could tell the branch was something rare.</p>

  <p>Dorothy took it from Zheng to take a closer look. However she didn't know what it was either.</p>

  <p>"Whatever it is," she murmured, "keep it safe. It might be useful one day."</p>

  <p>She stored the branch into her space ring.</p>

  <p>After that, she and Zheng headed back, leaving the Sacred Mallow Temple behind them.</p>

  <p>After Zheng retreated his body from the temple, he allowed the people at the gate to leave.</p>

  <p>Each of those warriors had merged with half a square brick, and most of them felt satisfied. Such Other Shore Tokens were enough to make them the top warriors in Stage One of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>But there was still a small portion of them who tried to enter the temple.</p>

  <p>Zheng and Dorothy had taken away all the valuable treasures that used to be stored there, so he was lax with letting warriors enter the temple.</p>

  <p>Thus, everyone rushed in together in excitement.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng pondered over quickly enhancing his cultivation base on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Dorothy had already been to Stage Four on the Other Shore. With her leading the way, the journey ahead would be much easier.</p>

  <p>After leaving the Sacred Mallow Temple, they trudged through the valley and ended up on a green grassland.</p>

  <p>Half a day later, Zheng saw something in the distance. A building loomed at the edge of the grassland.</p>

  <p>"The Other Shore Key to this temple is the least valuable. It is said that there is nothing inside, and no one visits it now," Dorothy explained.</p>

  <p>Ignoring the grassland temple, they continued until they came across a wide road.</p>

  <p>There were some other Souls of Light following the road. It seemed they were heading for the same destination as Zheng and Dorothy.</p>

  <p>After four hours' journey, Zheng saw the third temple in the distance.</p>

  <p>"The Other Shore Key to this temple is extremely rare," Dorothy said, following Zheng's gaze. "I've never seen or heard of anyone entering it."</p>

  <p>With his physical strength, Zheng might be able to smash the door and enter by force. But he decided not to entertain the idea, as there might have been strong races behind those doors.</p>

  <p>Moreover, his main goal this time was to grow rapidly stronger on the Other Shore. It was useless for him to linger in Stage One. He needed to progress to the next stages.</p>

  <p>A day and a night passed.</p>

  <p>Zheng's and Dorothy's Souls of Light had finally reached the end of the road.</p>

  <p>They were not alone; tens of thousands of other Souls of Light were also stationed there, sitting motionlessly.</p>

  <p>Towards the front, a large, white ring of starlight hovered.</p>

  <p>Even from a distance, Zheng could feel the power pulsating from the ring.</p>

  <p>The power felt familiar; it was similar to the chill of the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng could tell it was much, much stronger. If he was still as weak as he was when he first stepped into the Sea of Truth, he wouldn't be strong enough to approach the star ring.</p>

  <p>After having absorbed the soul crystal back at the Sacred Mallow Temple, Zheng's Soul of Light had doubled in strength. Although its nature as a soul had remained the same, it was several times stronger than the ordinary Souls of Light.</p>

  <p>"Stage One and Stage Two are connected by a star ring. If you want to go to Stage Two, you just need to go through the ring," Dorothy said to Zheng in a serious tone.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded. Turning to face the star ring, he saw that several Souls of Light had stood up. Steadily, they approached the circle of light.</p>

  <p>The moment they stepped into it, the ring started to spin rapidly. It seemed that something was about to spurt out of it.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p id="top_20">The star ring was whirling violently.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the ring shook and the several Souls of Light that had just entered were spat out violently.</p>

  <p>"They failed," Dorothy said, shaking her head.</p>

  <p>One just needed to pass through the white star ring to get into Stage Two.</p>

  <p>However, these people's Souls of Light were obviously not strong enough.</p>

  <p>The Souls of Light that were violently rejected by the ring were all badly injured, lying helplessly on the ground. Although this place was not as dangerous as the Sea of Truth, one could still get seriously hurt here.</p>

  <p>"It's our turn," Dorothy said gravely.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded calmly, following closely behind her towards the white star ring.</p>

  <p>It wasn't Dorothy's first time to pass the white star ring, so she looked very relaxed. Zheng, although this was his first time, was quite confident he'd make it.</p>

  <p>As soon as the two of them entered the white star ring, it began to spin at high speed again.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>As the star ring was spinning crazily, Zheng felt as though his soul were being crushed.</p>

  <p>He couldn't release his spiritual sense, so he couldn't tell what was going on around him. Panic started to well within him as things grew more and more chaotic.</p>

  <p>After a short while, another ray of white light shot out from the star ring towards the sky.</p>

  <p>The other Souls of Light who had been watching closely began to murmur amongst themselves in low voices.</p>

  <p>They didn't envy Zheng or Dorothy at all; the auras their souls emitted were too strong. The other souls had actually thought that the two had descended from the upper stages of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>The white light coiled around Dorothy's and Zheng's Souls of Light, launching them upwards as well.</p>

  <p>After about five minutes, Zheng felt that his Soul of Light had been restored.</p>

  <p>He returned to his human form and his spiritual sense had returned to normal.</p>

  <p>He opened his eyes and blinked. He realized he was standing in a huge square.</p>

  <p>Even more Souls of Light were gathered in the square. Zheng guessed the number was around more than a hundred thousand. Another white star ring hovered in the center of the square, with an aura even fiercer than the one prior.</p>

  <p>Zheng could sense the Souls of Light present were much stronger than those in Stage One.</p>

  <p>"This is Stage Two?" Zheng asked. Gant had been trapped in Stage Two. He wondered whether Gant was among the souls in the square.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Zheng, if you're tired, let's take a break first," Dorothy said in a concerned tone.</p>

  <p>"No need. Let's continue," Zheng said resolutely.</p>

  <p>True enough, he felt rejuvenated after passing on to Stage Two so easily from Stage One.</p>

  <p>Now he knew how Dorothy had made it to Stage Four in such a short period of time. With a powerful Soul of Light, she could easily cross from stage to stage!</p>

  <p>However, in case of any accident, Zheng swallowed a few more soul pills before they walked towards the star ring again.</p>

  <p>Just like earlier, Zheng felt his spiritual sense was sealed again. In the blink of an eye, more ribbons of light coiled around him and sent him flying again.</p>

  <p>In no time at all, they made it to Stage Three.</p>

  <p>Very few warriors could make it to Stage Three from Stage One in so short a time. But the first stronghold of the Oneness Sky Palace was located in Stage Four which was where Zheng needed to go, so the two moved forward without hesitation.</p>

  <p>However, the aura of the white star light in Stage Three felt threatening to Zheng. His eyes narrowing, he decided not to go into it so recklessly.</p>

  <p>Dorothy had rested for half a month before she went to Stage Four for the first time.</p>

  <p>But Zheng rested only for two days. They swallowed dozens of soul pills, and then stepped into the star ring which led them to Stage Four, the Mysterious Root Stage.</p>

  <p>As soon as he regained his spiritual sense, he saw four enormous buildings standing not far away. They were similar to the temples he had seen before, but they were not locked. The gates were wide open, and many Souls of Light were streaming in and out.</p>
