<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>While Zelda and Luther looked at Zheng as though he was a monster, Zheng slowly stood up.</p>

  <p>The Wild God Power was nothing like the strength source, life vitality, or the chaotic energy. All three of those powers could be used at will.</p>

  <p>The Wild God Power, on the other hand, was completely a part of one's body.</p>

  <p>As this thought flashed across Zheng's mind, he immediately ignited the Wild God Power.</p>

  <p>He felt his body shake violently and his muscles, bones and even veins began to swell at once. As the swelling increased, he felt an indescribable power surge throughout his body.</p>

  <p>This was the first time that Zheng had ever absorbed the Wild God Power.</p>

  <p>Seeing as he'd only absorbed a small piece of wild bone of the lowest level, he couldn't instantly turn into a two-hundred-foot giant like Zelda was capable of.</p>

  <p>His body only stretched very little, and a brief moment later, he was a good inch taller.</p>

  <p>Even so, all this had made Zheng feel very excited.</p>

  <p>"The Wild God Power is really very unique," Zheng muttered. "It's nothing like I've ever experienced before." It was then that he noticed the surprise in Zelda's eyes and asked, "What's wrong?"</p>

  <p>"You... You haven't answered my question yet," Zelda replied excitedly.</p>

  <p>Zheng was capable of absorbing all the Wild God Power. In fact, his efficiency was three times better than Zelda's.</p>

  <p>In other words, when Zheng refined a single piece of wild bone, it came out to the same as when Zelda refined three pieces. The gap was very wide.</p>

  <p>How could Zheng answer such a question? It was difficult and confusing to explain.</p>

  <p>All he could do was shrug his shoulders and reply in a confused manner,</p>

  <p>"I don't know either."</p>

  <p>Zelda stared at Zheng's face suspiciously. Based on Zheng's previous performance, it was clear that he knew nothing about this power, but once he began putting it into practice, the technique went far beyond the common sense she could comprehend.</p>

  <p>Had she not seen it with her own two eyes, there was no way she would believe it now.</p>

  <p>Ultimately, Zelda said, "Maybe you really are suitable for cultivating to become a Wild God."</p>

  <p>Any time she had faced a problem that couldn't be explained, she always eventually put it down to talent.</p>

  <p>Although she didn't want to compare herself with such a talented young man, she couldn't help but feel a sense of frustration right now.</p>

  <p>Becoming a Wild God was more than having the capacity for absorbing a piece of wild bone.</p>

  <p>The unsatisfied Zheng quickly turned his eyes toward the Immemorial Wilderness.</p>

  <p>Over the past few days, the people of the tribe came and went. They were busy collecting wild bones on the edge of the Immemorial Wilderness.</p>

  <p>Even on the edge of the Immemorial Wilderness, they still had very high chances of being attacked by the Wights, which was actually very dangerous. Moreover, even if hundreds or thousands of people in the tribe went out collecting wild bones for an entire month, they'd only pick up two or three in total, and that was when they were lucky enough.</p>

  <p>Clearly, their method wasn't very efficient.</p>

  <p>Just as Luther had said earlier, the deeper they went into the Immemorial Wilderness, the higher their chances were of finding the wild bones.</p>

  <p>After all, it was safe to say that not many people even dared to go deep into the Immemorial Wilderness. If it weren't for Zheng, Luther could have nearly lost his life.</p>

  <p>However, these weren't problems for Zheng whatsoever.</p>

  <p>When he suggested entering the Immemorial Wilderness in order to search for the wild bones, Luther recommended himself immediately. He smiled cunningly and said, "The Immemorial Wilderness is so vast that you'll get lost if you aren't careful enough. Take me with you. I can be your guide."</p>

  <p>Zheng glanced at Luther, who had a convincing speech. Despite that, Zheng knew Luther would be a burden in the Immemorial Wilderness. He gently waved his hand, and a scroll appeared in his hand. "Don't bother.</p>

  <p>Here, this is a method for cultivating life vitality. You can learn it by yourself first. If you have any questions, just ask me."</p>

  <p>He extended the hand that held the scroll, giving it to Luther. As previously agreed, Zheng would teach Luther how to cultivate life vitality.</p>

  <p>Luther was unhappy because Zheng had refused him, but on the other hand, Zelda had strictly forbidden him from going into the Immemorial Wilderness, much less allowing him to follow Zheng.</p>

  <p>Moments later, Zheng entered the Immemorial Wilderness alone.</p>

  <p>Recently, he had the chance to develop a general idea of what the world might resemble at the bottom of the chaos.</p>

  <p>The real Out-of-Land Fiends lived in the tall and huge beast bones. Zelda and Luther called them 'bone towers', because they were literally as large as the divine land itself. Each bone tower was equally considered a strong force.</p>

  <p>And within such strong forces, a few of the Wild Gods could transform into giants that were anywhere from a thousand to over ten thousand feet tall!</p>

  <p>In comparison, Zelda was relatively weak among the Wild Gods.</p>

  <p>'In order to enter a bone tower, I have to become a Wild God. Zelda is a Wild God, and even she still desires to become stronger. Why doesn't she just simply enter a bone tower then?' Zheng wondered to himself.</p>

  <p>As he flew above the Immemorial Wilderness, Zheng continued guessing at different possibilities in his mind. Anyway, he'd always felt that Zelda and Luther had their own unspeakable secrets.</p>

  <p>However, those secrets had nothing to do with him. After all, Zheng couldn't even protect himself right now. What he hoped for was to become stronger and ultimately return to the divine land one day.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>He hastily flew all the way down the Immemorial Wilderness. Before long, Zheng had reached its true depths.</p>

  <p>Back when he had just fallen from the divine land, he had no idea about the existence of the wild bones. At the time, he only faintly felt that a mysterious aura appeared to be emitting from this wilderness filled with bones.</p>

  <p>Only now did he realize that the aura he had felt back then was from the Wild God Power.</p>

  <p>Only about an hour later, Zheng landed with a thud.</p>

  <p>His feet crunched over the numerous bones.</p>

  <p>Due to the quantity, it was impossible to distinguish the regular bones from the wild ones with nothing but the naked eye.</p>

  <p>Zheng tried squinting his eyes a little, and the spiritual will in his mind immediately spread out, reaching dozens of miles around him.</p>

  <p>"It's much easier to use the spiritual will when looking for wild bones."</p>

  <p>Although he was talking to himself, a smile appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>Currently, he was sensing that the area held at least seven or eight wild bones.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>In a split second, Zheng chose a direction and flew over. With a casual push, an invisible wave of force swept up layers and layers of bones.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>The bones surged like a thrashing white wave, and all the bones that were covered at the bottom suddenly rolled upward.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes flashed as he stretched out his hand quickly, and a piece of wild bone fell directly into his grasp. He tightened his fingers around the bone.</p>

  <p>As soon as he obtained the first wild bone, he flew to the next location and repeated his technique. In this way, he had obtained all eight of the wild bones in the surrounding area.</p>

  <p>It was obvious that Zheng's method was much more efficient in finding the wild bones than that of ordinary people.</p>

  <p>After obtaining the wild bones, Zheng flew into the air once more and continued flying deeper into the Immemorial Wilderness. As he continued on his way, he used his spiritual will in order to search an area of at least a dozen miles around him.</p>

  <p>After performing his technique several times, he had more than thirty wild bones in his hand. During this time, the ruckus he inevitably caused had also alarmed a few Wights.</p>

  <p>As he attacked and killed a few of them, all the others left as quickly as they could. From that point on, no one dared attack him again.</p>

  <p>In half a day's time, Zheng had already traveled thousands of miles deep into the Immemorial Wilderness. His pace was unbelievable.</p>

  <p>Just as his mind was off elsewhere, absorbed in collecting as many wild bones as he could, he suddenly heard an astonishing howl.</p>

  <p>The howl contained an extremely powerful, ear-piercing force. As the sound spread, it actually lifted countless bones up off the ground, forming a tsunami of bones.</p>

  <p>Zheng looked in the direction from which the howl came. Tens of thousands of miles away, he was certain that he could see a huge skeleton shadow appearing and heading closer his way!</p>

  <p>He was startled, and with reason.</p>

  <p>Even from so far away, the skeleton shadow could still be seen quite clearly. No doubt about it, this huge skeleton must be at least a thousand miles tall.</p>
