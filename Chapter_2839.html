<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2839 The News Of Nicholas' Death </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>On the Floating Island of the Dongfang Clan.</p>

  <p>The grand and beautiful gardens stretched around the exquisite palace. It was lush and divine that you could wander all afternoon and get lost in its secret nooks. The palace itself was full of grandeur and beautiful paintings and frescoes. From afar, a smoke of incense ascended slowly.</p>

  <p>The booming sounds had Iris startled, making her stand up immediately.</p>

  <p>Looking up at the sky, deep concern filled her eyes.</p>

  <p>It had been a long time since the members of the alliance of the powerful clans had stepped into the Abyss Demon Region, leaving them with no news about them.</p>

  <p>Hearing those booming sounds now delivered a piece of news back.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, it was a bad one. It meant that some Holy Being had departed forever, and could never come back to life.</p>

  <p>Was this Holy Being part of the alliance of the powerful clans?</p>

  <p>If so, who was it?</p>

  <p>Even the Holy Being couldn't escape death. Where could her husband be now?</p>

  <p>Feeling ill at ease, Iris trotted back and forth in the palace. Clearly, she couldn't sit around and wait.</p>

  <p>Making up her mind quickly, she walked out of the palace.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in one of the other palaces of the Dongfang Clan Several elders of the Dongfang Clan gathered to set up a magic array.</p>

  <p>A huge chess board lay in the center of the magic array, while a big drum stood inside it.</p>

  <p>As soon as the elders activated the magic array, the big drum thumped.</p>

  <p>Every time there was a rumble in the sky, a drumbeat also echoed its booming noise.</p>

  <p>On the chessboard, a small chess piece was jumping up and down.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings' universes were distributed in different directions. They used this method to determine which universe had collapsed, noting from which direction the voice came from.</p>

  <p>"Da!"</p>

  <p>The small piece would jump slightly on the chessboard each time the drum beat.</p>

  <p>It had been moving to the upper right bit by bit.</p>

  <p>Noticing the direction where the piece jumped, the elders of the Dongfang Clan couldn't hide the ominous look on their faces.</p>

  <p>"Could it be..." one of the elders started to assume.</p>

  <p>But before he could say his thoughts out loud, another old man interrupted him, "No way! No matter who that Holy Being is, it's not our Holy Emperor!"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely! Our Holy Emperor has far more supernatural power than ordinary Holy Beings. How could he die so easily?" the third old man concluded, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>However, as he was saying this, the small piece jumped all the way to the upper right.</p>

  <p>Everyone's expression went gloomy.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps, it's Woodruff of the Moon Clan," the fourth old man said.</p>

  <p>"Right! It is most likely to be Woodruff!" another replied.</p>

  <p>Situated in the westernmost area, Woodruff's universe was marked as the rightmost spot on the chess board. If the piece crossed the location of Nicholas' universe, then it must be Woodruff.</p>

  <p>It was their last ray of hope.</p>

  <p>But everyone knew how slim the chances were.</p>

  <p>Woodruff hadn't gone to the Abyss Demon Region. Over the years, the entire Moon Clan including the War God Hall had remained low-key. Who could take his life now?</p>

  <p>Their Holy Emperor, Nicholas, had led many Holy Beings to explore the Abyss Demon Region. In such a damned place, anything could happen.</p>

  <p>At last, the piece reached its destination on the chess board, leaving it without any moves to the right.</p>

  <p>As the sky rumbled again, the drum beat and the piece jumped from its position on the chess board and landed there again.</p>

  <p>"Da! Da! Da!"</p>

  <p>Seeing how the piece landed, two old men fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>"What, what?" another middle-aged man mumbled, having no idea how to deal with this matter. The movements of the piece caught him by surprise.</p>

  <p>Rushing out from the palace, a slightly younger True God roared wildly with his bad news, "The Holy Emperor is dead!"</p>

  <p>"The Holy Emperor is dead!"</p>

  <p>The True God went out and spread the news to every corner of the Floating Island, making sure not a single soul missed it.</p>

  <p>Hearing the True God's cry, Iris felt her legs had gone weak and finally gave up as she slumped on the ground.</p>

  <p>Of all the things she could imagine, this was probably the last thing she wanted to hear.</p>

  <p>If even Nicholas didn't survive, then who could protect her husband?</p>

  <p>"Really? So the Holy Emperor's universe was broken?"</p>

  <p>"Why? He is so far the strongest man! How could he die?"</p>

  <p>"It must be just a rumor! Nonsense!"</p>

  <p>Even with the news being announced, most of the disciples of the Dongfang Clan chose not to believe this fact.</p>

  <p>Being the leader of the alliance of the powerful clans, the Dongfang Clan had always been superior to the Sword Clan and the Moon Clan, and they had offended many people. Nicholas' death would definitely make the Dongfang Clan decline as well.</p>

  <p>The Dongfang Clan still had great prestige on the Ray Tree.</p>

  <p>However, Nicholas' successor couldn't be known anytime soon.</p>

  <p>If any of the other powerful clans started attacking them in retaliation, they would be undoubtedly dead.</p>

  <p>Nicholas' death was impossible to hide from the public.</p>

  <p>In fact, as soon as the vibration of the broken universe was transmitted, everyone was made aware of what was going on. Calculating the direction of the broken universe, the various powerful clans quickly came to a conclusion.</p>

  <p>"The Holy Being who died is from the Dongfang Clan."</p>

  <p>"Hahaha! Thank goodness! That damned Nicholas is now dead!"</p>

  <p>"What should we do now? Without the protection of the Dongfang Clan, what would happen to our status?"</p>

  <p>The people's reaction were a combination of everything. Some rejoiced, some felt upset, and some took pleasure in Nicholas' death.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Nicholas' universe was undergoing an unprecedented disaster.</p>

  <p>Nicholas had run his universe very well.</p>

  <p>Apparently, the other Holy Beings were not just afraid of his own strength.</p>

  <p>If he were to launch a war in a universe, then no one in the divine land would dare to meet his attack.</p>

  <p>Three thousand three hundred races, numerous worlds, and countless stars.</p>

  <p>There were countless talents among the secondary creatures. Some of them were not inferior to the outstanding warriors in the divine land, but they were unable to resist the collapsing crisis in the universe, even though their eyes were full of unwillingness and confusion.</p>

  <p>After the stars fell and the supreme worlds collapsed, it all ended up with numerous casualties.</p>

  <p>Watching helplessly, these secondary creatures could only feel devastated with what had occurred.</p>

  <p>In the Swirl Forest.</p>

  <p>Standing in the yard, Harold raised his head to look up at the sky.</p>

  <p>Augustus, Hallet, Joy and the others were watching him from afar.</p>

  <p>"Rumble!"</p>

  <p>Clasping his fingers, he couldn't hide a thoughtful expression that flashed on his face.</p>

  <p>His gesture would change each time he heard another roar, making him unfathomable.</p>

  <p>After a long while, he finally saw it.</p>

  <p>A glint flashed in his eyes as his conclusion was drawn.</p>

  <p>"Who is it?" It was Hallet who spoke first.</p>

  <p>With the universe collapsing, Hallet and Augustus were the most concerned about their own master Bromley.</p>

  <p>Although they weren't sure as to where Bromley was, the fact that his universe was safe meant that he was also still alive.</p>

  <p>A trace of doubt crossed Harold's eyes as if he suspected that he had miscalculated. Calculating by bending his fingers again, he commented,</p>

  <p>"The sounds are coming from the northwest. It is Nicholas' universe that collapsed."</p>

  <p>"So Nicholas is dead?" Augustus asked, leaving his mouth wide open.</p>

  <p>Hallet knew exactly what it meant. His eyes flashed with a dazzling light.</p>

  <p>"If his universe has collapsed, he can no longer come back to life!"</p>

  <p>They still had the chance to revive Mike, Zheng's father, because the Evolutionary Universe was still running smoothly.</p>

  <p>Joy's mouth remained slightly open in shock after she heard the news.</p>
