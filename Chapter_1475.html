<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>However, one thing they were completely oblivious about was that all of the 128 Supreme Lords in the universe were now frantically trying to calculate the location of the Crown of Destiny.</p>

  <p>Concurrently, just outside the underground palace, every other warrior who had entered the underground palace had returned outside one by one.</p>

  <p>This expedition deep into the underground palace was quite an abundant harvest for these warriors. Apart from the second cave, they were all able to acquire good fortunes in the third and fourth caves.</p>

  <p>Sad to say, the number of casualties inside the underground palace was quite huge. All in all, more than half of the members of the Demon Night race, the humans, and the ogres had lost their lives during the exploration.</p>

  <p>Having already received Yao's instructions, the Demon Night Saint Lord was lying in wait for Luo Luo Zheng and Xun to come out of the underground palace. Never in her wildest dreams would she have thought that this trip to the underground palace would involve such a big issue!</p>

  <p>In any case, deciding on which side to pick between the two queens was such a no-brainer. Yao had already sent out Salvador, Viveca, Aneisha, and Elspeth into the Dark World. Although she still had some qualms regarding Yao's orders deep inside, as the Saint Lord of the Purple Bamboo Sacred Place, she was the one responsible for the well-being of the entire sacred place. Most importantly, she knew full well what the repercussions would be for going against Yao's orders. With Yao being the only authoritative figure in the Demon Night race, it would be foolish to oppose her.</p>

  <p>As luck would have it, the only thing she had to do was to wait here and let Yao's men take care of everything. With the level of strength she had at present, she could lay waste to Xun and Luo Luo Zheng with such ease.</p>

  <p>However, if Xun were to put up resistance, she would find it hard to bear the crime of killing the queen.</p>

  <p>Through the eyes of the ogre warriors inside the underground palace, the ogre Saint Lord had been watching everything the entire time. Luo Luo Zheng was someone he couldn't stomach. At this point, he really couldn't care less what problems existed between Luo Luo Zheng and the Demon Night race, as he was dead set on not letting Luo Luo Zheng go so easily.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the Saint Lord of the human race was caught between a rock and a hard place at the moment. He was well aware that Luo Luo Zheng was a warrior of the Mist Palace, but the situation right now had already gone out of hand, so he had no idea if he should be poking his nose into it.</p>

  <p>At the very bottom of the Endless Abyss.</p>

  <p>Walking toward the center of the palace, Luo Luo Zheng did as Livingston instructed. He went ahead and sat down in the middle of numerous divine textures.</p>

  <p>"Learning how to control the Reincarnation Plate will require you to have a complete mastery of all the 3600 divine textures. The amount of time it's going to take will rest on how well your divine texture perception is." Livingston explained, as his voice emanated from the other end of the palace.</p>

  <p>Screwing up his eyes, Luo Luo Zheng did his best to impress the divine textures into his memory as he tried to activate them.</p>

  <p>True enough, it was just as Livingston had told him. The Reincarnation Plate was an enormous space tool. If he could successfully learn how to control it, then he could take advantage of it and leave this wretched place!</p>

  <p>All of these 3600 divine textures had been passed down from the previous grand era. To Luo Luo Zheng, these things were utterly unheard of, meaning to say, learning to master them would be exceptionally troublesome. So, the best he could do at the moment was to just try and wrap his mind around them as soon as he possibly could.</p>

  <p>Two hours later, the divine textures surrounding Luo Luo Zheng started to illuminate one by one.</p>

  <p>However, it was barely over a hundred of them that had been lit up. If this continued at the current rate he was learning, it would most probably take about seventy-two hours before he could activate the divine textures in its entirety!</p>

  <p>But for all that, Luo Luo Zheng increasingly became even more familiarized with the patterns of these divine textures, so much so that the speed at which he was able to activate them became much, much faster.</p>

  <p>Four hours later, close to three hundred divine textures had been illuminated!</p>

  <p>Six hours later, he already managed to activate over a thousand divine textures, making such a significant improvement in contrast to what he was able to accomplish in the first four hours.</p>

  <p>And eventually, after eight hours of concentration, every single divine texture was now giving off such a radiant glow. At this point, Luo Luo Zheng finally opened his eyes again.</p>

  <p>"Are you good to go?" Xun asked, standing on the other end.</p>

  <p>Beaming her a gentle smile, Luo Luo Zheng nodded his head in response. Then, he proceeded to raise his hands and stretch his arms up in the air.</p>

  <p>With this simple gesture, the ground began trembling all of a sudden.</p>

  <p>And in no time at all, the underground palace in its entirety was already shaking uncontrollably!</p>

  <p>At the same time, the warriors standing close to the entrance to the underground palace had been thrown off balance. They had no idea what was going on inside, but they all watched in awe as the space outside the underground palace started to collapse.</p>

  <p>"The underground palace looks like it's shifting!"</p>

  <p>"How could this possibly happen? The Endless Abyss is actually moving?"</p>

  <p>"Only God knows what the hell has caused this phenomenon!"</p>

  <p>Even the three Saint Lords themselves had confusion written all over their faces as they feasted their eyes on this. Their attention was completely fixated on the inconceivable event that was transpiring right in front of their very eyes.</p>

  <p>The Reincarnation Plate was a sizeable space tool. Having it under his disposal, Luo Luo Zheng made it ascend from tens of thousands of miles deep underground!</p>

  <p>Not long after, a great chasm appeared in Auspice City right at its very center. One after the other, the houses started to cave in, and a thick cloud of dust started to form. In the end, everyone was forced to watch in disbelief as an enormous golden plate came out of the crack and floated into the air.</p>
