  <p>
</p>

  <p>Since she entered the Heavenly Stellar Sacred Place, Fiona had been acting strange.</p>

  <p>While the strange dragon-shaped monsters were indeed troublesome to deal with, they weren't particularly deadly to the many powerful warriors at the Soul Sea Realm. After all, they were only cubs— they weren't a threat so long as the warriors were careful enough to not be besieged.</p>

  <p>With a glance at Fiona, Zheng grabbed the dragon-shaped beast and said, "I guess this is not what Fiona is afraid of. This is merely a cub."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I think so too!" a Soul Sea Realm warrior nodded with a solemn face.</p>

  <p>While it was dragon-like, the thing wasn't quite a dragon yet. The very shape of the young beast was already terrifying. What would happen when it grew up later on?</p>

  <p>But even though this monster was still a cub, there could be a mother beast lurking around. Could their mother be in the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land?</p>

  <p>This conclusion wasn't too difficult to come to— most of the powerful warriors at the Soul Sea Realm could easily figure it out.</p>

  <p>The most important question, however, was what kind of mother beast gave birth to these dragon-shaped monsters? And what level of strength did it possess? Would the crowd be able to resist it?</p>

  <p>The thought made the emperors frown. "How about having this year's Heavenly Stellar Secret Land exploration end here? There will still be a great number of opportunities in the future," Scott suggested.</p>

  <p>In truth, what he wanted to say was that since the ascending passage would be opened because of Zheng, sooner or later, everyone would be able to ascend to the Upper World— there was no need to risk their lives in the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land.</p>

  <p>The four emperors along with the Soul Sea Realm warriors of the four divine kingdoms had worked themselves to the bone, all for the benefits of the Reverse Spirit Channel.</p>

  <p>If they could ascend to the Upper World, they would obtain endless resources— they wouldn't have to fight over the Ancestral Dragon Egg any longer.</p>

  <p>"But if Derek asks, how will we account for it?" one of the Soul Sea Realm experts asked cautiously.</p>

  <p>"Hmph! Why didn't he just enter the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land himself? He's stronger than us, so he's just bullying us because we're still unable to ascend to the Upper World. He's just using trash from up there to trick us into working for him!" another Sea Soul Realm powerhouse exclaimed angrily.</p>

  <p>Although the four divine kingdoms listened to the secret sect, they were absolutely not its submissive subjects. Each of them planned for their own future.</p>

  <p>They had already stepped into the Soul Sea Realm. Once Zheng's information was relayed and the passage was repaired, they only had to wait for the day to ascend.</p>

  <p>And as for the Ancestral Dragon Egg… it was indeed good stuff, but what did it have to do with them?</p>

  <p>Seeing that everyone maintained the same kind of attitude, War King Wind was also interested. After some pondering, he decided, "Okay, if that's the case, when Derek asks, let's tell him that we failed. This sacred place has already changed so much. For safety's sake, we should go back!"</p>

  <p>With that, a positive response resounded from the other Soul Sea Realm warriors— everyone's life was valuable. While they could perhaps obtain some lucky chance and benefit from the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land, compared to their own lives, it wasn't that important.</p>

  <p>However, just as they were to retreat, the ground began to tremble.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>It was as if a huge beast was beating the ground.</p>

  <p>"What was that?" War Emperor York was an extremely cautious person.</p>

  <p>His face turned gloomy.</p>

  <p>Rumble…</p>

  <p>The tremor continued like a strong earthquake. All the buildings in the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land began to rise and fall, collapsing piece by piece.</p>

  <p>"Go! No matter what it is, it's definitely not something good! And it has nothing to do with us!" After shouting, Turner took the lead to run back.</p>

  <p>Everyone felt a tinge of regret— they should've left when they encountered that puppet archer.</p>

  <p>For all the years they spent exploring the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land, they hadn't yet obtained the Ancestral Dragon Egg— they were all well aware of the many dangers in this sacred place. For the past ten years, not a single person had died in the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land and they grew too complacent. Now, it was no easy task to retreat.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The warriors at the Soul Sea Realm turned into streams of light and started running back. As for the small dragon-shaped monsters they found on the way back, they couldn't care less about them now.</p>

  <p>While Zheng had come for the Ancestral Dragon Egg as well, there was a difference in the essence of his purpose. Although Zheng wanted to obtain the Ancestral Dragon Egg because of the cyan dragon, this group of Soul Sea Realm experts were all too ready to retreat— this was bad.</p>

  <p>But at this moment, a black blade-light suddenly appeared from the building before them.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>It then spread out at lightning speed.</p>

  <p>Pfft!</p>

  <p>In an instant, the corpse of one of the Soul Sea Realm experts was cut into two pieces before his soul was separated from his mind to float away in the air.</p>

  <p>Witnessing the scene, some of the warriors behind him jumped in surprise, while others fell to the ground to avoid the blade light— fear filled them all.</p>

  <p>"Who is it?"</p>

  <p>War King Wind sensed life vitality emitting from the light. It was clear that their opponent was neither a fierce beast nor a puppet.</p>

  <p>To their right was an exquisite-looking tower with a stable foundation— even after the earthquake, it remained standing.</p>

  <p>Creak!</p>

  <p>The door to the second floor of the tower opened abruptly. A young man, clad in black, walked out— he had long hair, a thick beard, and a lazy look on his face. In his hand, he held a black saber.</p>

  <p>"Huh! Strange. Why is there a group of corpses running around here?"</p>

  <p>The young man sniffed something for a moment. "It doesn't smell like zombies. Some people seem to have abandoned their own bodies and occupied the corpses of the Dragon Lineage Human. This is weird.</p>

  <p>Dorothea, what's going on?"</p>

  <p>As soon as he asked the question, another person stepped out of the ruins— a beautiful, silver-haired woman stood in front of them. The only twist to her beauty was in her right eye— a pale, pink flower grew there, its root deeply embedded in her eye socket. It was a terrifying trait.</p>

  <p>"Hmph, it's simple. These folks couldn't even resist the power of blood sacrifice, but they managed to come up with such a method. They used Soul Cores to control the corpses of the Dragon Lineage Human and snuck into the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land. They should be natives of this great world," the silver-haired woman responded indifferently.</p>

  <p>Afterward, a tall and sturdy man walked over along the street, carrying a fiery red sickle on his shoulder.</p>

  <p>While the burly man walked toward War King Wind and the others, he remarked, "Seems like we're lucky. We're lacking in bait to lure that thing out. But since these live souls are in corpses, the bodies are perfect for bait!"</p>

  <p>It seemed as though the three of them weren't taking the warriors seriously at all— Scott, War King Wind, and Turner were all utterly offended.</p>

  <p>"Friend, what do you mean?" War King Wind asked coldly.</p>

  <p>With a sinister smile, the silver-haired woman asked, "Who is your friend? Weren't we clear? We're capturing the Evil Dragon. We want to borrow your corpses… and your souls!"</p>

  <p>"How conceited! To keep so many of us here? As if you could! Humph!"</p>

  <p>War Emperor York scoffed.</p>

  <p>Although the Soul Sea Realm warriors couldn't use their full strength due to the occupation of the corpses, they were still at the Soul Sea Realm— they wouldn't submit to defeat so easily.</p>

  <p>"Haha! Conceited? No one has mentioned that!" the silver-haired woman laughed in amusement.</p>

  <p>As the burly man walked to the other side, carrying the giant sickle, it seemed as though he paid no mind to Zheng's group. Faintly, he said,</p>

  <p>"Dorothea, capture them. Max can't wait any longer!"</p>

  <p>With a slight nod, the silver-haired woman revealed an enchanting smile.</p>

  <p>And then, the flower in her right eye began to spin.</p>
