<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It all happened so suddenly that Phoenix and Li Bianxue barely had any time to react.</p>

  <p>All they saw were light dots fluttering by like restless fireflies, and then a pair of giant hands reached out to grab their heads.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Luo Zheng's superior reactions came to their rescue.</p>

  <p>Over and over again, the giant hands were only inches from them. The girls felt incredibly unsafe and in serious danger.</p>

  <p>But it all happened as quick as a flash and their astonishment didn't last long. When they had come to their senses, the giant hands had extended to their limit.</p>

  <p>Dark cyan chain was wrapped tightly around the wrists of the giant hands, tingling and clanging.</p>

  <p>At the same time, a rhythmic tune could be heard coming from the Cold Prison. It was as melodious and pleasant to the ears as singing, yet a hint of anger was clearly hidden within.</p>

  <p>"That sound is very similar to the one from the soul cloud in the Soul City!"</p>

  <p>Li Bianxue remarked.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded in agreement.</p>

  <p>It had been many years since Phoenix had passed through the Soul City and so this had not occurred to her immediately.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng and Li Bianxue had just come from the Soul City and so it was still fresh in their minds.</p>

  <p>"Bang! Bang! Bang! "</p>

  <p>The pair of giant hands slapped down on the ice, sending waves of ice shards flying through the air with every slam.</p>

  <p>They shot in all directions and flew like invisible weapons, one of them hitting Phoenix in the arm. Even though she had already stepped in the Holy Soul Realm, the ice fragment still pierced her skin, causing her to let out a muffled groan.</p>

  <p>"Get behind me!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng turned the Divine Fire Shield around and stood in front of the girls to block them from the ice fragments.</p>

  <p>The giant slapped the ground a dozen times before he finally tired himself out.</p>

  <p>Such a terribly cold environment affected the giant as well. Due to this, a layer of white frost had condensed on the surface of his skin. Clapping the ice violently had actually created about a dozen cracks across his arms.</p>

  <p>The pair of giant hands then slowly retracted into the Cold Prison.</p>

  <p>To Phoenix's and Li Bianxue's eyes, the hands turned to a stack of incomprehensible white light dots as they retracted.</p>

  <p>"The bald giant seems afraid of the cold too, but why isn't the extremely low temperature in the Cold Prison affecting him?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>The temperature in the Cold Prison could almost not go any lower. Any creature sucked into it should die.</p>

  <p>According to Luo Zheng's observations in the Deleting Space, the creatures in the Abstruse Energy World were not immortal.</p>

  <p>"It's their form. Their form allows them to avoid the damage of the low temperature," the green figure replied.</p>

  <p>The Abstruse Energy State was different from the rest. If one wanted to destroy them in the Abstruse Energy State, they certainly couldn't use ordinary means.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded in understanding.</p>

  <p>From what he saw, the bald giant opened his mouth, waved his hands and roared endlessly in the Cold Prison.</p>

  <p>But what he heard was a melodious and rhythmic song.</p>

  <p>It was perhaps the expression he could see on the giant's face that gave him the sense of anger in the song.</p>

  <p>"Can you decipher what he is saying?" Luo Zheng inquired.</p>

  <p>"I can give it a go," the green figure said.</p>

  <p>The Calculation Civilization wouldn't miss this chance to communicate with a creature from the Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>However, this was also the first time the Calculation Civilization would attempt to translate the sounds of the Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>A lack of previous samples for reference meant it would take much longer to decipher the song.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Zheng had come this far, he was in no rush to move on to Stage Thirty-one of the Other Shore. After asking for Li Bianxue's and Phoenix's opinions, he decided to wait on the spot.</p>

  <p>This time, the core of Heavenly Obsession Civilization calculated for more than twenty hours.</p>

  <p>Day and night did not actually exist in the Blooming Jade Stage, but around a day and a night had passed before the core of Heavenly Obsession Civilization got a rough translation of the bald giant's language. It was made easier by the fact the giant used simple words.</p>

  <p>"He is cursing the Element Spirit race...</p>

  <p>He says that the members of the Element Spirit race are cunning swindlers who lured him to this damned place..."</p>

  <p>"?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng now began to understand the situation a little more.</p>

  <p>The bald giant appeared to have been tricked into entering this world by the Element Spirit race, and then imprisoned in this damned place.</p>

  <p>Anyone would be as angry as he was after being imprisoned for so long. It was understandable that he wanted to tear apart any creature he came across.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and the girls had been waiting for a whole day and night and the bald giant had sung the entire time. His resentment towards the creatures in the chaos was quite clear.</p>

  <p>"Is there any way to communicate with him?" Luo Zheng asked hopefully.</p>

  <p>Since he was capable of using language, communication with him should be possible. Luo Zheng would not waste the chance to get speak to him.</p>

  <p>"We have only deciphered part of his words. We can try, but I'm afraid it's difficult to imitate the way he speaks," the green figure said.</p>

  <p>The bald giant's speech seemed to have multiple syllables and when he spoke it sounded as if more than ten people spoke together.</p>

  <p>The green figure taught Luo Zheng a rough method of pronunciation, and he then walked off singing.</p>

  <p>Just as he began singing, the bald giant suddenly stopped. He stared intensely at Luo Zheng with eyes wide open.</p>

  <p>'Does he understand me?'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's heart filled with joy. He continued walking forward, and at the same time, singing what he wished to say.</p>

  <p>But then, the giant pounced and an enormous hand appeared once more, drawing a large arc as it slapped down towards the three of them.</p>

  <p>"Retreat!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng frowned and retreated under the cover of the Divine Fire Shield.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The gigantic hand left a mark of five fingers on the solid ice surface. The bald giant snickered and slowly withdrew his hand.</p>

  <p>"Your song must be very unpleasant to the ears," Phoenix said with a cheeky smile.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shrugged helplessly. "I suppose I don't sing the right way."</p>

  <p>The giant's way of speaking involved multiple syllables.</p>

  <p>Expressing it through a human's way of speaking was incredibly difficult.</p>

  <p>It was possible that despite Luo Zheng singing for a long time, the bald giant didn't understand a word.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng tried a few more times, even asking the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the Snake Goddess to brain storm solutions, but all attempts failed.</p>

  <p>The bald giant maintained a furious frown, reacting violently to Luo Zheng's every approach.</p>

  <p>Feeling helpless, Luo Zheng had to give up, for now.</p>

  <p>After bypassing the thirty-mile wide Cold Prison, they continued towards the other side of the upper ice field.</p>

  <p>The Cold Prisons were in the center of the whole ice field. Once they left this area, moving forward would be easy.</p>

  <p>Several hours later, they finally arrived at the other side of the upper ice field.</p>

  <p>Phoenix chose a spot and melted a cave a thousand feet deep beneath the ice.</p>

  <p>Going down the cave, they reached the lower ice field.</p>
