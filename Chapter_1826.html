  <p>
</p>

  <p>There was hardly a hair's breadth between Luo Luo Zheng and the Princess Royal as they lay on the huge silver stone, which made it quite hard to turn over.</p>

  <p>The huge silver stone on the other hand emitted an irresistible force of attraction under the chaotic force field.</p>

  <p>"You can't move too, right?"</p>

  <p>Princess Royal asked. The two of them had been pressed too close against each other when they had fallen on the stone.</p>

  <p>After that, they kept glancing at each other like a first-time couple.</p>

  <p>"It's a little hard..." Luo Luo Zheng tried to shake his head, but it was extremely difficult to move his neck. The attraction force was far too powerful.</p>

  <p>"The members of the Collapsing Mountain race are extraordinarily strong. It is said that if ordinary warriors enter their territory, they would instantly freeze, and only slaughter awaits them," the Princess Royal said with a smile.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stared at her, utterly speechless.</p>

  <p>"You've known about this since a long time ago, right?"</p>

  <p>"This place is where the strength source is. Of course I've heard of it before." "Then why did you still lead me here?" Luo Luo Zheng asked shrilly.</p>

  <p>Truth be told, he was rather annoyed. "But we have no other way to go,"</p>

  <p>Princess Royal stated calmly.</p>

  <p>Extreme sadness washed over Luo Luo Zheng once again. This woman was not wrong. They wouldn't be able to get rid of the Formless Sky Python no matter where they fled.</p>

  <p>It seemed that this place was the only area left where they could try their luck.</p>

  <p>"I bet the Formless Sky Python doesn't dare enter the Collapsing Mountain race's territory," the Princess Royal inferred. She had her own judgment of things, but she wasn't stupid.</p>

  <p>The Divine Refinement Forbidden Land was originally a trial ground. It was where warriors could grow and be promoted the fastest, and not even the divine land could compare to it. Yet since it was an extremely dangerous place, it came with much bigger risks.</p>

  <p>This Divine Refinement Forbidden Land was only the size of at least three supreme worlds. It had many trial grounds, and the Collapsing Mountain race guarded its strength source. The place was for body refiners to cultivate.</p>

  <p>"What a pity... You must have guessed wrong," Luo Luo Zheng said, a wry smile on his face.</p>

  <p>They heard the familiar sound of explosions again. Although Luo Luo Zheng and the Princess Royal were within the huge silver stone, they could still see the ground and the mountains tremble.</p>

  <p>"Rumble..."</p>

  <p>It was as if an immense earthquake had occurred, and even the ground began to ripple like water. Clearly, a huge monster moved underneath...</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng inhaled deeply. At that moment, he wanted nothing more than to stand up and break free from the stone's constraints!</p>

  <p>However, it was impossible to do it with his own strength alone. Thus, he had no choice but to use the power of the dragon scales.</p>

  <p>The nine Genuine Dragons and Luo Luo Zheng had quite the conflict after the Genuine Dragons came to their senses. They had never communicated with Luo Luo Zheng until now, but Luo Luo Zheng was still able to use the cyan dragon's power.</p>

  <p>After he had poured all the power into his body, his entire being suddenly shook.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing?" The Princess Royal was astonished when she saw Luo Zheng's reaction.</p>

  <p>"Stand up!" Luo Luo Zheng said through gritted teeth. 'Is he crazy?' the Princess Royal thought.</p>

  <p>Her melodious laugh filled the tight space.</p>

  <p>Although it was hard to communicate with the Collapsing Mountain race, they didn't kill innocents. However, many martial artists chose not to enter unless they were fully prepared. If they got up from the stone, it only meant that they were really ready to enter this place.</p>

  <p>Therefore, many of the martial artists who had entered the place were stuck frozen to the ground like cold meat patties! It was impossible to cultivate or reach the strength source under such conditions.</p>

  <p>"It's impossible... Unless you have the cultivation base of a world lord..." the Princess Royal said. The Princess Royal continued to talk, but she suddenly stopped when she saw that Luo Luo Zheng had indeed gotten up.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the powerful suction force pressed Luo Luo Zheng down firmly against the rock like a huge hand, which rendered him motionless!</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng had been infused with the power of the dragon scales. He eventually made use of the power and slowly lifted up his hands, feet, and then his waist. Finally, he bent his knees and tried to get up.</p>

  <p>"How did you do it? You must've used some external force," the Princess Royal guessed. She was greatly perceptive and was quickly able to figure out that Luo Luo Zheng didn't use his power alone.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded and did not deny it.</p>

  <p>His own strength would grow in time and besides, he couldn't rely on the power of the dragon scales forever.</p>

  <p>Since the Collapsing Mountain race's territory was a good place for body refining, how could Luo Luo Zheng pass it up?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng exhaled once more, straightened his back, and slowly stood up!</p>

  <p>It was just a simple standing motion, but Luo Luo Zheng felt like he had carried a dozen mountains on his back. It was incomparably hard for him!</p>

  <p>"Crack, crack, crack..."</p>

  <p>His spine emitted an ear-splitting crack every time he stretched out. Even his divine weapon body found it hard to endure the pain.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was also confused. The Collapsing Mountain race had lived in the place for generations, so how could a baby born there bear such power?</p>

  <p>Even a martial artist who had become a world lord would find it immensely troublesome to withstand such an attraction force. Ordinary warriors who would enter this place would be instantly crushed into ground meat!</p>

  <p>As the Princess Royal stared on, Luo Luo Zheng stood up!</p>

  <p>"You're so amazing!" she exclaimed with a giggle. After she had heard the flower vendor's prophecy, she was the first to believe that Luo Luo Zheng was destined to be extraordinary.</p>

  <p>However, the Princess Royal came from the divine land and she believed that he was extraordinary because he was able to bring her into the Soul Suppressing Cliff. That was why she recklessly wanted to take him back at the beginning.</p>

  <p>Only now did the Princess Royal realize that she had underestimated this young man of the Spirit Supreme Realm.</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately, it's useless." Luo Luo Zheng, who had stood up, looked ahead with a wry smile.</p>

  <p>Apparently, Luo Luo Zheng had fallen horizontally towards the huge silver stone. He stood parallel to the ground once he had gotten up, and saw the scene below!</p>

  <p>The ground underneath the huge stones, which was several thousand feet long, began to cave in and form a small basin!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had already seen it before. It was a sign of the Formless Sky Python's attack.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>The basin only existed for three seconds before it disappeared before Luo Zheng's eyes. The Formless Sky Python suddenly rose upwards, wanting to swallow up the princess and Luo Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>The silver stones that floated in the air were naturally enormous, but they were actually nothing compared to the massive size of the Formless Sky Python.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the strong attraction force from the huge silver stone did not affect the Formless Sky Python in any way.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had just arrived in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, but he had already fallen into danger thrice. It made him quite depressed as he thought that it was all pure bad luck.</p>

  <p>He believed that without the help of the two world lords' Wishing Spells, he wouldn't be able to escape this time. He lowered his head, and his gaze landed on the woman beside him. Just as when the Princess Royal was about to speak, Luo Luo Zheng said, "You don't have to apologize to me. I'm just unlucky this time!"</p>

  <p>However, the Princess Royal did not look sad. Instead, she smiled and said, "I'm not going to say sorry. Look over there..."</p>

  <p>The Princess Royal was not a warrior who refined her body. Thus, she could not turn her head under the effects of the attraction force, and could only look straight ahead.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng followed her gaze and saw a few figures from a near distance who rapidly approached the scene.</p>

  <p>"Martial artists?" Luo Luo Zheng froze instantly.</p>

  <p>"The members of the Collapsing Mountain race!" The Princess Royal's face lit up as if she had personally seen the reinforcements.</p>

  <p>The warriors with bared arms had bronzed, toned muscles and looked very strong. Were they the members of the Collapsing Mountain race that the Princess Royal had spoken of?</p>

  <p>Based from their appearance alone, they seemed nothing special and were almost similar to ordinary humans. However, what surprised Luo Luo Zheng was that these warriors actually jumped crazily on the silver stones at a shockingly high speed!</p>

  <p>They weren't affected by the attractive force at all. Perhaps there was some secret technique that allowed them to escape the attraction force.</p>

  <p>The Formless Sky Python's huge mouth below only rose half the distance, and the members of the Collapsing Mountain race had arrived quickly.</p>

  <p>What happened next immediately corrected Luo Zheng's guess. The group of Collapsing Mountain members didn't escape from the attraction force at all.</p>

  <p>In reality, they were already used to the giant silver stone's attraction force due to their immense strength.</p>

  <p>"Bang, bang, bang!"</p>

  <p>Three strongest men of the Collapsing Mountain race rushed in front and punched the Formless Sky Python at the same time.</p>

  <p>The Formless Sky Python, whose body was like a rapidly growing bamboo, rose slowly? only to be destroyed by the three fists when it was halfway up.</p>

  <p>"This..." Naturally, Luo Luo Zheng was also a bit stunned. They had such a strong, formidable power to the point where Luo Luo Zheng couldn't comprehend it. He thought that maybe after all the cyan dragon's dragon scales had been lit up, it could reach the same effect.</p>
