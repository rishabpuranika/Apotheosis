<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Your master?" Zheng raised his eyebrows slightly and then ventured a guess.</p>

  <p>"Were you created by the fiends?"</p>

  <p>"The fiends?" The phantom shook its head and said, "Those fiends are working for my master. How can I be created by them?"</p>

  <p>"So you were indeed created by someone?" Zheng smiled.</p>

  <p>The phantom laughed in response. "Don't think such tricks can get me to talk. It's true that I was created, but I have everything that you possess.</p>

  <p>Therefore, it won't be hard for me to take your place in the divine land."</p>

  <p>Zheng's face darkened when he heard this. So that was what this whole thing was about...</p>

  <p>He had no idea who the so-called master mentioned by the phantom was.</p>

  <p>And if Zheng really died in the Abyss Demon Region, the guy in front of him was indeed very likely to replace him without anyone noticing.</p>

  <p>Of course, Zheng would not allow such a thing to happen. The killing intent once again appeared in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"It's meaningless," the phantom continued. "Even if you own the Wild God Power and are stronger than me, you still won't be able to kill me. If my master wants to copy you, it won't take much effort. I advise you not to waste your energy.</p>

  <p>Just wait here!"</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, on the Desperation Plain, a Demi-holy Being from the Mu Clan tapped the ground with his toes.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>Wisps of golden light intertwined and formed a huge golden bow.</p>

  <p>The Demi-holy Being suddenly bent his body and drew the golden bow.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>Rays of golden arrows began condensing on the bowstring.</p>

  <p>The golden arrows were spread in the shape of a fan, and lay close together on the long bowstring of about ten feet.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>With an explosive sound from the bowstring, hundreds of rays of golden light shot into the sky.</p>

  <p>Each dazzling golden light released a terrifying power. These golden arrows seemed to have eyes and an extraordinary accuracy.</p>

  <p>In the sky, the giant birds were flying in the midst of the smoke, and every time they appeared, they would spit out thick lightning.</p>

  <p>They were a major threat to the True Gods on the ground.</p>

  <p>However, the golden arrows shot out by the Demi-holy Being turned into thin and long golden lines before piercing through the giant birds in the sky.</p>

  <p>Screech...</p>

  <p>The giant birds whined as they fell from the sky.</p>

  <p>After the initial tension of the battle on the Desperation Plain, the Holy Beings were gaining ground.</p>

  <p>There was indeed a great number of Abyss Demons, but none of them could beat the consummate True Gods. Moreover, this particular group of consummate True Gods from the union of the great clans were extremely powerful? almost invincible.</p>

  <p>Even the fiends and their commanders were far from being a match for a Demi-holy Being, let alone a Holy Being.</p>

  <p>Unleashing just half of the Holy Beings' strength would be enough to exterminate these fiends.</p>

  <p>Nicholas, however, was under a lot of pressure as he faced off against Gallio.</p>

  <p>As one of the four great fiends, Gallio had absorbed countless times more Faith Energy than ordinary fiends.</p>

  <p>He was able to hold his ground even against Nicholas.</p>

  <p>Clark, who had turned into a burning figure, was floating in the air and panting for breath. His body was completely shrouded in flames that had been dazzling and bright at first, but were becoming dimmer and dimmer by the second. However, his burly figure still exuded a sense of unyielding aggressiveness.</p>

  <p>Murphy was in a bad condition, too. He was floating in the air, his hair loose and his eyes flashing with a dark green light. There was not a single part of his body that was fully intact.</p>

  <p>In actuality, a Holy Being could heal their injuries in an instant, but Murphy had no time to care about them at the moment.</p>

  <p>By contrast, Nicholas looked much better.</p>

  <p>Facing Gallio with a smile on his face, he appeared indifferent as usual. He put one hand behind his back and shaped his other hand like an eagle claw.</p>

  <p>"I won't kill you," said Nicholas coldly. "We can sit down and have a good talk."</p>

  <p>Ferocious monsters in the forbidden lands were immortal creatures that would come back to life even if they died.</p>

  <p>However, every time Gallio died, his strength would fall, and his status in the fiend race would be threatened. If that happened, there would come another fiend to replace him.</p>

  <p>There was no doubt that Nicholas's offer was tempting.</p>

  <p>Since none of the creatures were able to resist these Holy Beings, sitting down and talking with them was a much better option. After all, the goal of the Holy Beings was to take control of the Abyss Demon Region, not to eliminate the fiend race.</p>

  <p>Gallio's huge body was already covered with shocking scars, and the bones of his left leg were exposed. Unable to support himself any longer, he got down on one knee.</p>

  <p>However, there was no expression of pain on his face. When he heard Nicholas's offer, he laughed out aloud. If this were several divine eras ago, he might have agreed. "That's impossible now..."</p>

  <p>"Why?" asked Nicholas.</p>

  <p>Gallio shook his head. Instead of answering Nicholas's question, he shoved his hand hard into his chest.</p>

  <p>Every fiend had a huge crystal hidden in their chest that contained all the Faith Energy that they had absorbed over time. The stronger a fiend was, the bigger the size of this crystal. Gallio's crystal, needless to say, was enormous.</p>

  <p>"Demonic Crystal Explosion!"</p>

  <p>The very next moment, Nicholas heard a sound that was similar to glass shattering.</p>

  <p>A powerful energy was madly condensing in Gallio's body, and Nicholas keenly sensed that this energy was unstable.</p>

  <p>"Retreat! Hurry up!" he urged everyone at once.</p>

  <p>Clark and Murphy immediately realized how grim the situation was.</p>

  <p>"Let's go!"</p>

  <p>"Retreat!"</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>As the two Holy Beings retreated, they sent a message to everyone on the Desperation Plain with their life vitality.</p>

  <p>Although the alliance of the great clans was about to win the battle, there were still many Demi-holy Beings and consummate True Gods who were fighting with all their effort. Just after they received the message from the two Holy Beings, they felt a vibration under their feet that was coming all the way from the other end of the Desperation Plain.</p>

  <p>An extremely terrifying energy had exploded from Gallio's body.</p>

  <p>The explosion turned into a mass of horrifying energy that rushed over from the end of the Desperation Plain.</p>

  <p>Although Nicholas had asked Clark and Murphy to retreat, he was still standing firmly in front of the surging energy with his hands clasped together.</p>

  <p>The dark and light energies, which were black and white respectively, spread out from his hands.</p>

  <p>"Heaven and Earth Breaking!"</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack...</p>

  <p>The brown energy rushed toward Nicholas, but it only reached a few hundred feet before being blocked by an invisible wall.</p>

  <p>At the moment, Nicholas was like a big dam standing at the end of the Desperation Plain, singlehandedly holding off all the energy waves that were coming from Gallio's exploded crystal.</p>
