<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The exiles were imprisoned in this world and they were all aware of each other's existence.</p>

  <p>Ramzi could tell from the voice that it was Spark Yan from the Yellow Emperor race who was speaking.</p>

  <p>This person's status in the Yellow Emperor race was the same as that of the old man in the Nine Li race. He was one of the most powerful characters in this world.</p>

  <p>However, this didn't intimidate Ramzi. He didn't back off.</p>

  <p>The Yellow Emperor race only fought for the Sky South Bone Tower in these challenge matches, so it was amply clear that they didn't intend to start a war.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the Light of Adjudication, which appeared once every one thousand years, was about to arrive. This was not the ideal time to have a big face-off.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, even if the Yellow Emperor race really wanted to start a war, the Nine Li race would not fear its opponents.</p>

  <p>Ramzi was pretty confident about this.</p>

  <p>Ripples flashed in the space behind Tyler once more, and Spark's voice came through the ripples.</p>

  <p>"So then... What do you want?"</p>

  <p>It sounded like Spark wanted this to be over now.</p>

  <p>Adele, Giacomo, and some others exchanged silent glances.</p>

  <p>Admittedly, they were furious that Tyler had manipulated David during the battle. But strangely, Tyler had recklessly exposed himself, which gave the Nine Li race a chance to take advantage.</p>

  <p>The Nine Li warriors knew exactly what that question meant and Ramzi was even clearer what he was going to do. He smiled faintly and said,</p>

  <p>"It's very simple. The Yellow Emperor race should take their hands off the cities within five million miles around the Sky South Bone Tower."</p>

  <p>If they took their hands off, it meant that they would have to quit.</p>

  <p>These large races would never publicly announce that they had occupied these cities. After all, the cities where the people of the wilderness gathered were not important enough to attract the attention of these large races. Those who controlled the cities were usually sects that belonged to the race that occupied the place.</p>

  <p>What Ramzi meant was that the sects that belonged to the Yellow Emperor race should leave the area of five million miles around the Sky South Bone Tower!</p>

  <p>When the warriors of the Yellow Emperor race heard this, they were furious!</p>

  <p>For this generation, the Sky South Bone Tower had been shared equally by the two races. Even if the Yellow Emperor race gave up the Sky South Bone Tower, they would only lose one bone tower and four cities.</p>

  <p>If they were to retreat five million miles away...</p>

  <p>This would have a great influence on the Yellow Emperor race.</p>

  <p>"This is too much!"</p>

  <p>"We can't agree!"</p>

  <p>"It's impossible?"</p>

  <p>The warriors of the Yellow Emperor race immediately heard a buzz.</p>

  <p>Lancelot's face darkened. But since Tyler was here, as the Grand Elder, he had no say so he had to remain silent.</p>

  <p>It was Tyler's fault that the matter had ended like this. If Tyler hadn't cheated in the fight, Yellow Emperor race would have lost only the Sky South Bone Tower and nothing more. Besides, the idea of having this challenge was also Tyler's. Unfortunately, his disciple failed and was defeated by Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Lancelot looked at David in the distance and shook his head sadly.</p>

  <p>Although he didn't like David, he had to admit that David indeed had extraordinary strength.</p>

  <p>If he were Tyler, he might have made the same choice.</p>

  <p>Who would have thought that a boy in the Nine Li race would be even more powerful than David?</p>

  <p>The ripples in the air were calm for a while. After a long time, the voice said, "Okay. As compensation, our Yellow Emperor race will leave the area of five million miles around the Sky South Bone Tower."</p>

  <p>Ramzi was stunned that Spark agreed so quickly.</p>

  <p>He had just made his demand casually and was ready for negotiations.</p>

  <p>But he didn't expect it to be so easy. The other party seemed unfazed by it.</p>

  <p>This uncharacteristic behavior made him a little suspicious, but he couldn't figure out what Spark was thinking, so he simply replied,</p>

  <p>"That's good!"</p>

  <p>"Spark! How can you agree to such an outrageous condition?" Tyler was a little incensed.</p>

  <p>Although this predicament was caused by him, this agreement would cause a lot of losses to the Yellow Emperor race. Of course, Tyler was unhappy.</p>

  <p>"We will discuss this after you come back," came Spark's voice.</p>

  <p>Tyler was filled with helplessness. Looking at the Nine Li warriors, especially Luo Zheng, a strong hatred arose in him. But he could do nothing about it now.</p>

  <p>Just as Tyler was about to leave, Lancelot, the Grand Elder of the Yellow Emperor race suddenly stopped him. "Wait!"</p>

  <p>Glancing at Lancelot, Tyler asked, "What more do you want now?"</p>

  <p>Lancelot's eyes fell on Luo Zheng in the distance, and he said, "For this battle, we required that the warriors participating in the fight should be the members of the two races. Luo Zheng is indeed powerful and he has defeated David, but he doesn't seem to have the bloodline of the Nine Li race."</p>

  <p>If there was really such a talent disciple in the Nine Li race, it was impossible that they would not have heard of him in the Nine Li race before.</p>

  <p>Previously, Lancelot had his doubts. More importantly, Luo Zheng hadn't displayed his Nine Li Wild Body!</p>

  <p>Therefore, Lancelot suspected that the Nine Li race had borrowed Luo Zheng from another race who also had a noble bloodline. In that case, it was impossible for Luo Zheng to obtain a set of bloodline of the Nine Li race. If this was true, then Nine Li race would have violated the rules first and then this challenge would be dismissed.</p>

  <p>The moment Tyler heard Lancelot's words, his eyes lit up. He had come in a hurry without catching this point.</p>

  <p>"Yes! Let that boy prove that he is a Nine Li member!"</p>

  <p>"I've never heard of such a person in the Immemorial Wilderness. It's impossible for him to just pop out of a rock!"</p>

  <p>"This is true. Luo Zheng's background seems to be unknown."</p>

  <p>The people of the Yellow Emperor race seemed to have got a life-saving straw. This was probably the only thing they could hold on at the moment to turn the tables.</p>

  <p>But David was indifferent about the entire matter.</p>

  <p>He didn't care about who would finally get the Sky South Bone Tower or where Luo Zheng was from. He only knew that he had been defeated by Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The Yellow Emperor members began to make a ruckus, but the people of the Nine Li race were calm.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did not come from the Sky Spirit Bone Tower, but he was a genuine Nine Li member.</p>

  <p>A strange smile appeared on Adele's face when she heard Lancelot's words. She then said to Luo Zheng blandly, "Since Lancelot has doubts about your origin, you might want to clear his doubts."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded slightly.</p>

  <p>It was not difficult for him to transform into the Nine Li Wild Body. It was just that he had not got the chance to use it in these battles.</p>

  <p>Lisa and Jerome didn't pose any threat to him. In fact, while going against David at the beginning, he was able to suppress him easily.</p>

  <p>After David was manipulated by Tyler, Luo Zheng had no chance to transform into the Blood Wild Body.</p>

  <p>With everyone's gaze on him, Luo Zheng activated his Nine LI Wild Body through his thought. The bones and meridians in his body were surging, and another two heads and two pairs of arms sprouted from his body. He quickly turned into a creature with three heads and six arms!</p>

  <p>Three heads and six arms, and that too, all real!</p>

  <p>Moreover, there were few mid-rank Wild Gods who could turn into this form with three heads and six arms. If Luo Zheng could also achieve it, it meant that his blood was pure and rare. Considering this, it was not strange that he could manage such a feat.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Tyler snorted and stepped into the air, disappearing right before everyone's eyes.</p>

  <p>Lancelot cupped his hands towards Adele but had nothing else to say. He led the Yellow Emperor members and left.</p>

  <p>As for the Wild Gods who were quietly watching in the distance, some were happy while others were worried. After all, today's battle had determined the division of power in the territory of the Sky South Bone Tower.</p>

  <p>From now on, all the forces that were attached to the Yellow Emperor race would be removed and other people would replace them.</p>
