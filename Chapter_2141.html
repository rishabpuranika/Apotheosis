<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"I don't need to lie to you. As a matter of fact, it would only take me a single thought to kill you," Zheng continued to say.</p>

  <p>The Evil God froze.</p>

  <p>His wife had deduced that the God of Creation had the ability to get rid of any living beings and wasn't someone they could contend against by just relying on their own strength.</p>

  <p>Quite unfortunately, the Evil God was extremely stubborn and was determined to eliminate this God of Creation himself, causing him to end up like this.</p>

  <p>It was like he was a joke in the God of Creation's eyes. Zheng could have easily killed him off, but he gave him a chance instead.</p>

  <p>"You... why give me a chance?" The Evil God asked cautiously. The way Zheng dealt with things greatly differed from what the Evil God had thought. He had lost and he had thought that he would die for sure, but why the hell did Zheng spare his life and even help him? This had to be a trap!</p>

  <p>To his surprise, Zheng smiled. "Just do as I say. You're not qualified to collect Faith Energy. Don't get me wrong. I may be giving you a chance but it has nothing to do with you."</p>

  <p>With that, Zheng's avatar quietly dissipated.</p>

  <p>As soon as Zheng disappeared, the woman in the sideline regained her freedom to move. She ran straight to her husband and bit her lip in worry. "Are you alright?"</p>

  <p>"Why did he do that?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Why did he say that it had nothing to do with you?" The woman was also left confused by Zheng's words.</p>

  <p>The Evil God was embedded in the mountain, still in a daze.</p>

  <p>"It has nothing to do with me... nothing to do with me..."</p>

  <p>Not long after, the Evil God scoffed and looked at his wife. He smiled wryly. "If I spare an ant, is it because of the ant itself?"</p>

  <p>The woman shook her head. "Of course not."</p>

  <p>"That's what I am in his eyes. An ant."</p>

  <p>The woman blinked in realization. "He... is a life form at a level which is beyond our comprehension, and it's normal for him to think of us as ants."</p>

  <p>The Evil God sneered and his eyes burned with flames. "I will prove to him that this ant is an extremely special ant!"</p>

  <p>Truth be told, the Evil God was indeed a special ant in Zheng's eyes.</p>

  <p>With the population steadily growing in Zheng's inner world, the appearance of unique existences was inevitable. With his omniscient ability, Zheng knew that the Evil God had completely comprehended the Law Tablets that he had placed in his inner world, Not only that, but he had also comprehended a portion of the Ice Soul Flame when he entered the ice field. In addition, his attainments in the runes had also reached a high level!</p>

  <p>Zheng did not pass down the divine texture technique into his inner world but the Evil God was able to rely on his own comprehension to activate the power of the nine stars through the original runes. Even in the divine land, this kind of talent and perception would be considered extraordinary, let alone in any of the universes.</p>

  <p>When he encountered such talent, it was only natural that he valued him, which was why he only asked him to dissolve the totem of faith and eliminate the totem of Evil God, so as not to affect Zheng's ability to use his Godly Tile to extract the Faith Energy in the future.</p>

  <p>Once the Evil God set a certain goal, he would do everything in his power to achieve it.</p>

  <p>He understood that Zheng did not like him to gather Faith Energy, so he dissolved his secret sect immediately and disbanded his Evil Cloud Sacred Place at the same time. But with the help of his core subordinates in the sacred place, he rearranged the faith totems on several continents in the world.</p>

  <p>However, these totems weren't of his own image, but Zheng's. At the same time, he spread all sorts of legends about the God of Creation.</p>

  <p>His plan went on without a hitch. After all, legends regarding the God of Creation and the Venerable Creator had already been circulating around this world since the ancient times. In fact, when he had first started gathering Faith Energy, he had already encountered a considerable amount of resistance. It was expected however, as the people in this world had always worshiped Zheng as their God of Creation.</p>

  <p>Before, the Evil God had had to erase the legends regarding Zheng in order to gather Faith Energy. At one point, he even had to massacre almost a third of humanity. At present, Zheng had no need for this Faith Energy.</p>

  <p>However, once he condensed a Godly Tile in the future, Faith Energy would be crucial in the process of forming his momentum.</p>

  <p>When Zheng came out of his inner world, the wound caused by the Stone Mouse had almost healed.</p>

  <p>"I don't know how powerful that poison is, but it's a pity that you killed this Stone Mouse," Zheng heard Master Evil sigh.</p>

  <p>"Why?" Zheng rolled his eyes. "If I didn't poison this mouse to death, I would've been long dead. Besides, wasn't your body also destroyed by this mouse? You should have a grudge against this little thing."</p>

  <p>"But you don't know how precious this Stone Mouse is," Master Evil said. "Back then, a True God had relied on this Stone Mouse to become a Holy Being! Seven divine eras ago, in order to obtain this Stone Mouse, I gambled my entire fortune. I believed I was right to make that decision, but who would have thought that the Stone Mouse would hatch in advance and I would miss the opportunity to form a contract with it."</p>

  <p>A one-of-a-kind true spirit truly would never lose its memory.</p>

  <p>The Stone Mouse had assisted a Holy Being of remote ages in earning his title. Later on, when the Holy Being perished, the Stone Mouse died as well.</p>

  <p>However, the mouse didn't really perish. After it was "reincarnated", it turned into a strange stone in the shape of a mouse. Then, it once again formed a contract with another martial artist, and although that marital artist didn't become a Holy Being, he was able to become a True God and reach the consummate level of a True God.</p>

  <p>Having a contract with the Stone Mouse was comparable to getting the key to a treasure trove.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is indeed a pity," Zheng said with a shrug of his shoulders. "I've been blabbering about how special this mouse is to you, and you're still going to leave it there?"</p>

  <p>"Isn't this mouse dead already? What else could it possibly be used for?"</p>

  <p>Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>As Master Evil said, the theurgy of the mouse was not in its own abilities, but in its memories that it had inherited as a one-of-a-kind true spirit.</p>

  <p>What was the use of a dead Stone Mouse?</p>

  <p>"You still know so little about the divine land," Master Evil said helplessly. "Even if the Stone Mouse is only a corpse, you will find countless True Gods who will fight for it. Even the wealthy clans in the Floating Islands won't back down from getting it!"</p>

  <p>"Why?" Zheng asked again.</p>

  <p>"Because, through the corpse of the Stone Mouse, you could be able to find the place where it reincarnates and dig out that strange mouse-shaped stone. Even if you only use it as an exchange for something, the value of this mouse's corpse is beyond your imagination!" Master Evil patiently explained.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded, finally getting the point. The Stone Mouse held incredible value, and even if he had no use of its memories, he'd still be able to exchange it for something else!</p>

  <p>With this in mind, Zheng walked towards the mouse's corpse, plucked it from the ground, and put it away.</p>
