<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The skull that occupied three fourths of the island was in fact the entrance to the Land of Bone Tribulation.</p>

  <p>"The Land of Bone Tribulation opens every eight hundred hours. Six hundred and forty hours have now passed," the Sturdy Bull replied.</p>

  <p>"So it will open in seven days?" asked Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Yes!" The Sturdy Bull answered.</p>

  <p>Seven days...</p>

  <p>Zheng pondered this a while and decided not to leave the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>These Other Shore creatures were not reliable. If he left, there was no guarantee they wouldn't set up arrays and wait for an opportunity to strike at him...</p>

  <p>He sat down cross-legged facing the skull, dead still in meditation, waiting for its opening.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore creatures stood behind him, sizing him up silently. They didn't want to provoke him anymore and so waited with him.</p>

  <p>Seven days passed by quickly.</p>

  <p>Once it had been eight hundred hours, the huge skull trembled and began rising slowly.</p>

  <p>Zheng sensed the change and opened his eyes, staring intently at the rising skull before him.</p>

  <p>He now realized it was a complete skull but the lower end of it had been buried in the island before.</p>

  <p>As it continued to rise, more and more was revealed and a cervical spine now became visible; it turned out to be a complete skeleton!</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>Once the skull had risen a fair bit, a strange sound echoed from between its jaws. Its mouth slowly opened, releasing, incredibly, a pathway.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore creatures itched to give it a go. When the Land of Bone Tribulation had opened before, they would swarm in.</p>

  <p>But this time, as Zheng stood at the front, none of them dared to move first.</p>

  <p>Zheng walked without hesitation, straight into the large mouth of the skull.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore creatures followed in as soon as he entered.</p>

  <p>Inside the skull were stairs made of thin bones. After walking down the bone stairs, they returned to the bottom of the sea. Then another wondrous scene was revealed to them.</p>

  <p>The Soul Interdicting Water with dark blue light was blocked by an invisible force, forming isolation walls.</p>

  <p>In the center were many floating white bone plates.</p>

  <p>This was Zheng's first time entering, so he stood on the stairs and looked at the bone plates carefully.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore creatures behind him dared not to force him further, so all they could do was wait silently. Zheng watched the plates for a full five minutes before they could not wait any longer. After all, time was precious when the Land of Bone Tribulation opened.</p>

  <p>"Human friend, you should sit on the white bone plate first to enter the Land of Bone Tribulation," the Sturdy Bull said from behind.</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled faintly, sensing the angst among these creatures. He jumped down from the stairs and landed on one of the bone plates.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The moment he set foot on it, the bone plate carried him to the side.</p>

  <p>The other creatures jumped onto the bone plates too and sat down, also retreating to the side.</p>

  <p>Once they all sat on bone plates, identical bone plates appeared on the opposite side with skeletons placed on them.</p>

  <p>On the plate opposite to the Sturdy Bull, was a huge skeleton similar to him.</p>

  <p>On the plate opposite to Zheng, was a human skeleton, the same size as he was, making the same moves he did.</p>

  <p>Zheng raised his hand and so did the opposing skeleton.</p>

  <p>Zheng turned his head, and so did the skeleton...</p>

  <p>It seemed to be a mirror image, but with no flesh and blood-it was just a pale white human skeleton.</p>

  <p>"Is this my tribulation skeleton?" Zheng asked, staring at the skeleton.</p>

  <p>In the Land of Bone Tribulation, everyone had their own corresponding tribulation skeletons. When they accepted the test of the land, their tribulation skeletons would in turn undergo a significant change.</p>

  <p>Zheng's tribulation skeleton had just been born when he had entered, so it was as white as white jade.</p>

  <p>But the huge tribulation skeleton corresponding to the Sturdy Bull was covered with a faint layer of golden glaze. He had been here for a long time and clearly had gained a lot.</p>

  <p>However, this was all gained for the tribulation skeleton. Before it merged with him, he had gained nothing on his own body.</p>

  <p>Although these creatures had been here a long time, they still did not possess the ability to compete with Zheng!</p>

  <p>"Your tribulation skeleton is too new," the Sturdy Bull said with a trace of pride. He looked at his own tribulation skeleton, which shone with golden light, with love glinting in his eyes. He finally had something to be proud of in front of Zheng.</p>

  <p>The other creatures shared the same sentiment. They didn't know what Zheng had done to obtain control of that amazing power, but what did that matter?</p>

  <p>Here, he was still a newcomer!</p>

  <p>Once they obtained the Myriad Tribulations Body, their strength would still be able to surpass Zheng's!</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes flashed with mockery as he asked, "How long have you cultivated here?"</p>

  <p>"I've been here only seven years. I've reached this level quite fast actually!" the Sturdy Bull admitted confidently.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Brice is quite talented, mainly because he has a divine body which is stronger than other creatures' from the moment he was born," said an Other Shore creature. He then pointed to a centipede-shaped creature close by.</p>

  <p>"That long insect there is even stranger. He has cultivated a unique body refining method. In just a year, he has already entered the sixteenth layer of the Myriad Tribulations Storm!"</p>

  <p>The surface of that centipede's tribulation skeleton shone with golden light as well. It was almost a Myriad Tribulations Body!</p>

  <p>The centipede had been silent this whole time, lying motionless on his own bone plate. He was focused solely on cultivating the Myriad Tribulations Body and had no interest whatsoever in other matters. Even when the Element Spirit race had sent a message to attack Zheng, he paid it no mind.</p>

  <p>As they spoke, an intense pressure overtook the entire space, suddenly expanding and contracting along with the violent rising and falling of the surrounding sea water. A storm had formed in the center!</p>

  <p>The storm rose and swept out the Soul Interdicting Water from the surrounding "walls".</p>

  <p>Drops of Soul Interdicting Water gathered in the center of the storm.</p>

  <p>Zheng was inevitably hit by the Soul Interdicting Water as he sat on the bone plate.</p>

  <p>He tried to dodge, but the Soul Interdicting Water was too dense. He was hit and then gave up trying to dodge it. He had accepted that he was unable to leave the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The Soul Interdicting Water was completely submerged in the rising storm, forming a larger blue storm.</p>

  <p>'Is this the Myriad Tribulations Storm?' Frowning, Zheng looked at the scene unfolding in front of him. At the same time, he felt confused as to whether he should refine his body with the Soul Interdicting Water.</p>

  <p>When he was still at a loss for what his next move should be, streaks of golden liquid suddenly rose from the bottom of the storm.</p>

  <p>Feeling the aura of the golden liquid shrank his pupils. Even the Primeval Lord of Heaven who was observing in his inner world seemed to remember something, which changed his face in an instant!</p>
