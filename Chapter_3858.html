<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3858 A Good Weapon </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>There was no way the brass man could think of anything else during this critical moment.</p>

  <p>He knew that Zheng was the crux of all these matters and was the reason for Divine Farmer's chase.</p>

  <p>They wanted Zheng for a specific purpose and until this purpose was fulfilled, there was no way they would harm him.</p>

  <p>It was fortunate that the brass man's conjecture turned out to be true. Divine Farmer's frown was very obvious when he decided to use Zheng as a weapon.</p>

  <p>Divine Farmer, Yellow Thearch, and Mahoney all received the same order from the Element Spirit race: take advantage of Zheng's inability to leave the Other Shore and capture him!</p>

  <p>Seeing the brass man carry Zheng on his shoulders as he rushed towards him, Divine Farmer had no choice but to tilt his Divine Farmer Ruler to hit the brass man's head and avoid harming Zheng.</p>

  <p>Given his rich experience in combat, the brass man easily saw through his opponent's move. He ducked and swung Zheng's body forward to use him as a shield!</p>

  <p>Determined to protect himself, the brass man raised Zheng's body and smashed it towards the Divine Farmer.</p>

  <p>In fear of hurting Zheng, Divine Farmer chose to withdraw his ruler. In his haste, he did not have enough time to dodge the swipe heading towards him and could only take the force of the attack head-on!</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Zheng's head directly slammed onto Divine Farmer's chest with a loud thud.</p>

  <p>The impact was so strong and penetrated deep into Divine Farmer's chest, through his heart, and onto his spine.</p>

  <p>This strong, penetrating force was the result of the brass man's theurgy: the Combat Dragon Power.</p>

  <p>It did not just stop with the Divine Farmer's body, in fact, the same power erupted on several thousand feet of ground behind him. The amount of destruction caused by this theurgy was terrifying and could very well play a decisive effect in normal combat.</p>

  <p>Divine Farmer's body trembled and the sharp pain he felt in his chest confirmed his injuries.</p>

  <p>A murderous glint flashed through his eyes, furious that this brass man managed to deal such heavy damage to him. Divine Farmer quickly made a dash and came upon his opponent's back.</p>

  <p>He raised his Divine Farmer Ruler and brought it down!</p>

  <p>Clatter!</p>

  <p>The surface of his weapon glowed an ominous dark green as numerous black carvings flowed through it.</p>

  <p>Divine Farmer was good at detoxification but he was also considered an expert at weaponizing poison.</p>

  <p>This Willow Green Poison, for example, was a unique concoction Divine Farmer himself created.</p>

  <p>It was so potent that not even an Eternal Realm master could hope to survive it.</p>

  <p>He did not normally use this on Holy Soul Realm opponents but the rage he felt from being hoodwinked by the brass man was enough to make him pull out all his cards.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately for him, the brass man was also set to go all out in this fight.</p>

  <p>Although Divine Farmer's agility was on par with his, all the brass man really needed to do was be fast enough to wield Zheng as his shield.</p>

  <p>As the poisonous ruler headed towards him, the brass man quickly brandished Zheng as his primary defense. He didn't even need to turn around.</p>

  <p>This counterattack was so sudden that Divine Farmer couldn't react in time.</p>

  <p>He watched in horror as his Divine Farmer Ruler chopped down towards Zheng's body and he was unable to stop it.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>There was a loud, clanging sound as the weapon hit Zheng's leg. Instead of going through the flesh, it was as if another weapon collided with the ruler.</p>

  <p>The sound and sight shocked not only Divine Farmer and the brass man but the rest of the Black Ship's members.</p>

  <p>There was no way the brass man expected Divine Farmer to hit Zheng so carelessly.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Divine Farmer was at his wits' end in fear of Zheng dying from his poison.</p>

  <p>However, what astonished everyone was that Zheng remained unharmed through this entire ordeal.</p>

  <p>The attack dealt by Divine Farmer had at least one hundred thousand divine megatons of force!</p>

  <p>How in the world was Zheng able to resist such a blow? Could it be that his Chaotic Source Spirits managed to absorb the attack and saved his life?</p>

  <p>Were his Chaotic Source Spirits truly so strong that they were able to resist one hundred thousand divine megatons of force?</p>

  <p>The exchange of blows boosted the brass man's confidence. It was basically a confirmation that he could choose to wield Zheng as an invincible weapon, so he carried the man towards Divine Farmer. "Brothers of the Black Ship!</p>

  <p>Lend me a hand!"</p>

  <p>Ready to answer his call, a member of the Black Ship stretched out his hand and patted the top of his skull where an Other Shore Token emerged. It was a black and withered branch.</p>

  <p>"Withering Power!"</p>

  <p>This was similar to the Latent Theurgy Zheng once used to resist Elizabeth in the past!</p>

  <p>Another member of the Black Ship patted his chest and a small circular lens appeared. He quickly chucked it towards the brass man.</p>

  <p>"Power Transfer Lens!"</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>These two Other Shore Tokens worked well together: the Withering Power released by the black withered branch, that could increase one's strength sixfold, was reflected by the lens. The brass man could easily feel its effects rush through him.</p>

  <p>Since the brass man was a power type warrior, his full strength could very well reach over fifty thousand divine megatons!</p>

  <p>Such formidable strength truly stood out among all Holy Soul Realm warriors and could easily reach the threshold of the Eternal Realm!</p>

  <p>However, with the use of Withering Power, his strength soared to three hundred thousand divine megatons!</p>

  <p>So long as these two other members of the Black Ship continued to assist him then the brass man could continuously unleash such frightening amounts of power.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A white mist began to emanate from the brass man's hand that held Zheng's body. He felt really good considering the significant increase in his strength.</p>

  <p>Though cooperation wasn't a strange concept to the Black Ship, this was the first time they used such a strategy against such a powerful being like Divine Farmer.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Even Divine Farmer faltered in the face of this ferocious attack.</p>

  <p>He fully intended to avoid this all-powerful force headed his way but he was also worried and wondered if Zheng would be able to withstand the brass man's super-strength.</p>

  <p>Before Divine Farmer could come up with a decision, another Black Ship member decided to intervene. It was Edith, the controller of the Invisible Ship.</p>

  <p>"Invisible Ship!" she commanded.</p>

  <p>The Invisible Ship itself was an Other Shore Token. Although it was virtually useless in combat, it had other functions that could be put to good use.</p>

  <p>"Space Imprisonment!" In times of need, the Invisible Ship could be used as an escape method or a way to trap enemies.</p>

  <p>With Edith's command, the Invisible Ship instantly disassembled into countless, transparent space fragments that recombined into a space cage intended to trap Divine Farmer.</p>

  <p>Given Divine Farmer's strength, it wouldn't be that difficult for him to break out of this space cage if he had the time, around twelve seconds to be exact.</p>

  <p>However, when Edith trapped him inside, she also let the brass man in!</p>

  <p>Divine Farmer was essentially cornered! There was nowhere left he could run to escape the brass man's attack!</p>

  <p>A wicked grin flashed through his opponent's face. "Divine Farmer! Let's see if you can withstand this!" he shouted.</p>

  <p>The brass man could feel the blood within his body boil as his mist-covered hands raised Zheng's body and smashed it against Divine Farmer's head.</p>

  <p>Left with no other choice, Divine Farmer slid his fingers across the Divine Farmer Ruler.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>Green light flashed from the ruler and spread all throughout his body, like a blossoming willow.</p>

  <p>Just as the light began to shine, Zheng's head made contact with Divine Farmer's body.</p>

  <p>Pop!</p>

  <p>Despite the harsh blow, Divine Farmer was unharmed.</p>

  <p>However, his once indestructible Divine Farmer Ruler twisted so suddenly.</p>

  <p>Pop!</p>

  <p>Determined to not give Divine Farmer any chance to recover, the brass man quickly smashed Zheng down on him.</p>

  <p>This second attack twisted the Divine Farmer Ruler even more and completely distorted its shape.</p>

  <p>Pop!</p>

  <p>Upon the third smash, Divine Farmer fell back and smashed the space cage Edith trapped him in.</p>

  <p>His weapon was now greatly distorted but at least he managed to withstand three, incredibly fatal attacks!</p>

  <p>Of course, the state of his Divine Farmer Ruler made his heart ache. It would take a long time to nurture his lifeblood weapon back into shape.</p>

  <p>Still, Zheng's unharmed state concerned him more. How in the world was the young man completely intact after enduring intense bouts of power?</p>

  <p>A look of regret flashed through the brass man's face when he realized that he had failed to subdue Divine Farmer. Just a few more smashes and he was certain to have ended him. It would take the brass man a few seconds to realize that the astonishment on Divine Farmer's face wasn't directed at him, but to Zheng whom he wielded as a weapon.</p>

  <p>'Well, I got to admit this boy's physical body makes for a good weapon, ' the brass man thought to himself.</p>

  <p>Then he remembered that Zheng withstood nearly three hundred thousand divine megatons of force but was barely injured.</p>

  <p>It wasn't long before the brass man's face was the exact mirror of astonishment on Divine Farmer's.</p>
