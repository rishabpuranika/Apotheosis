  <p>
</p>

  <p>The newcomers behind Luo Zheng were all nervous and fidgety.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng's strength was unquestionable, it was another matter for him to challenge the strongest warrior on the first floor.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the senior disciples in the Land of Sword Grief were merely waiting for a good show.</p>

  <p>Abdul observed Luo Zheng quietly from the sidelines.</p>

  <p>For some reason, he had a hunch that something was going to go wrong.</p>

  <p>A person who was able to survive the Chaotic Source World and reach the Chaotic Source Realm must be extremely outstanding. But that person shouldn't have done such a stupid thing.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked all too calm as though he was brimming with confidence.</p>

  <p>It didn't seem like a mask.</p>

  <p>Even if he was pretending, the fight would expose his true strength.</p>

  <p>Did he do it for the sake of the new disciples?</p>

  <p>About an hour later, two figures appeared before the door of the bronze palace. Then, Cleon's booming voice came through, "Who on earth wants to challenge me?"</p>

  <p>"Cleon is back!"</p>

  <p>The senior disciples' eyes flickered in excitement.</p>

  <p>Abdul stepped forward and cupped one hand in the other, making obeisance to Cleon. Then, he pointed to Luo Zheng. "It's him."</p>

  <p>Taking a casual glance at Luo Zheng, looking him up and down, Cleon didn't find anything particularly special. But he heard Chance gasp loudly in surprise from beside him.</p>

  <p>"Chance, for heaven's sake!" Cleon chastised.</p>

  <p>But how could Chance not react at all?</p>

  <p>Never did he expect to see Luo Zheng there, let alone find out he was the one who challenged his elder brother.</p>

  <p>Not long ago, he was defeated by this very man. Because of his failure, he was thoroughly reprimanded by his elder brother, and even mocked by his younger one? Ahmad.</p>

  <p>Now, Luo Zheng had just entered the Chaotic Source Realm. Chance had never thought he would be so bold as to challenge Cleon.</p>

  <p>"Brother?that's  Luo Zheng Luo," Chance muttered.</p>

  <p>The revelation had Cleon's eyes slightly widen in surprise.</p>

  <p>In truth, he never understood how Chance could have been defeated by Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's Green Jade chessboard, as described by Chance, sounded way too powerful to be real.</p>

  <p>Never had Cleon heard of such an Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>But Cleon hadn't expected Luo Zheng to be bold enough to challenge him as soon as he reached the Chaotic Source Realm and joined the Land of Sword Grief.</p>

  <p>After a moment of thought, Cleon smiled gently as he said, "So, you're Luo Zheng?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's my name," Luo Zheng replied plainly.</p>

  <p>"You defeated my younger brother, Chance, before you even reached the Chaotic Source Realm. You must be very good." Cleon's tone was flat.</p>

  <p>His words instantly caused an uproar among the senior disciples in the Land of Sword Grief.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"Did I hear that wrong?"</p>

  <p>"This guy defeated Chance before reaching the Chaotic Source Realm?"</p>

  <p>On the Ranking Stone, Chance stood at the 1022nd. It was a rather lagging position, but there were still nearly a hundred people below him on the list.</p>

  <p>That meant that Luo Zheng could have defeated the senior disciples at the bottom of the list before reaching the Chaotic Source Realm.</p>

  <p>The thought had the seniors' faces turn grim.</p>

  <p>"Brother!"</p>

  <p>Cleon's casual mention of Chance's defeat had him rather embarrassed.</p>

  <p>To keep his defeat a secret, Jean, his mother, had ordered to dismiss all the guards of the Phoenix Palace.</p>

  <p>This kept the knowledge of his failure limited.</p>

  <p>But Cleon made it public so easily. Chance wasn't the only one disgraced.</p>

  <p>But Cleon didn't seem to care about his brother's protest. "You did lose? it's a matter of fact. There's no need to hide it. Someone was lucky enough to get some special Other Shore Token. It was luck on his side that let him defeat someone stronger than him."</p>

  <p>Then, he turned to Luo Zheng and bored his gaze into him firmly. "I'm afraid you won't be so lucky in front of me. Since you've chosen to challenge me, I won't refuse the fight. But you must be prepared to pay the price!"</p>

  <p>With that, Cleon went straight to the back of the bronze palace. When he passed by Abdul, he gave him a pat on the shoulder. "Bring him here," he said.</p>

  <p>The other senior disciples followed Cleon and left the room. Luo Zheng and the new disciples were the last to walk out.</p>

  <p>While the disciples on the second floor looked down upon the first-floor disciples, they were rather intrigued to hear of a newcomer challenging Cleon.</p>

  <p>They wanted to see for themselves if Luo Zheng was merely arrogant or if he actually had any formidable strength.</p>

  <p>Behind the bronze palace stood an arena.</p>

  <p>It was where the disciples of the Land in Sword Grief trained for martial arts.</p>

  <p>Once Cleon's foot met the ground, he stood in the very center of the arena.</p>

  <p>Tilting his palm, he gestured for Luo Zheng to enter the area.</p>

  <p>Excitement was building up among the disciples on the first floor.</p>

  <p>"Cleon! Make him suffer!"</p>

  <p>"He probably can't even take a single punch from Cleon! He's just entered the Chaotic Source Realm!"</p>

  <p>"A single punch will be enough to exhaust all the Chaotic Source Spirits in his body. A second punch will smash him into pieces!"</p>

  <p>In the midst of the hubbub, Luo Zheng jumped up and confidently took his place on the arena.</p>

  <p>From there, he saw snake-shaped arrays arranged around them.</p>

  <p>Noticing how Luo Zheng examined the arrays curiously, Cleon said, "This is the first time you've stepped onto the arena. There are some rules I must explain. The Other Shore Tokens of the descending type cannot be used in the Land of Sword Grief."</p>

  <p>That made Luo Zheng frown questioningly. "I can't use any Other Shore Token of the descending type?"</p>

  <p>Seeing Luo Zheng's face, Cleon's eyes showed a hint of complacence.</p>

  <p>Chance had told him what Luo Zheng had relied on was the Green Jade chessboard. If the statues that descended could grow infinitely, it would be truly terrifying. But if the Other Shore Token was forbidden, Luo Zheng would pose no threat to Cleon.</p>

  <p>"Not only the Other Shore Tokens of the descending type, but also those of the mysterious type and the auxiliary type are prohibited. If you attempt to use any of them, you will be rejected by the arrays and in turn, lose the battle," Cleon continued.</p>

  <p>"Got it." Luo Zheng nodded once.</p>

  <p>The standard for joining the Land of Sword Grief rested on reaching the Chaotic Source Realm.</p>

  <p>Disciples of this realm had to go to the extreme to increase the bearing capacity of their Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>All sorts of incredible abilities were within the Other Shore Tokens. Once they were used, unforeseen consequences were likely to unfold. Naturally, they had been prohibited in the arena.</p>

  <p>"If you got it, then? You will lose!" Cleon declared as a tremendous aura spread from his body.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore Power constantly surged out of his inner world, fueling his body. With all the Chaotic Source Spirits activated simultaneously, his aura grew wildly.</p>

  <p>"But it won't really be a shame for you to lose to me. I am number one on the first floor, after all. But unfortunately, you have once humiliated my younger brother, Chance. I won't be showing you any mercy. You're going to suffer what you must."</p>

  <p>Then, as Cleon stretched out his hand to condense his power, his strike was already on its way to Luo Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>"Wow!"</p>

  <p>The palm strike held over three thousand Jun of Other Shore Power.</p>
