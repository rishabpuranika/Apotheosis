<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Malcom didn't say anything. He could still rely on his strength to keep him safe inside the Dark Nether Cave.</p>

  <p>However, with his forceful energy being completely blocked, he couldn't exert his strength to the full. Now, there was nothing he could do except for keeping his chin up.</p>

  <p>The land ahead of them was empty. There was nothing there but some withered shrubs.</p>

  <p>However, this didn't mean that they dared relax their vigilance. They were afraid that some demonic beasts or monsters might suddenly appear and pounce on them.</p>

  <p>The group followed closely behind Yolande. However, Xun, in her incorporeal form, was floating next to Luo Zheng. As his sword spirit she had no weight at all. Although some unknown power in this world had restrained everyone's life vitality and forceful energy, it only exerted a minimal influence on Xun.</p>

  <p>While everyone was walking forward, Yolande's footsteps suddenly slowed and eventually stopped.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" Esther asked in alarm, her hand going to the small knife which she carried.</p>

  <p>The warriors who had lost their life vitality were like tigers with their teeth pulled out. If they were confronted by some fierce beasts, they would not be able to fend off their attacks.</p>

  <p>Yolande's gaze was fixed on a place not far ahead of them. Behind a pile of grass a fat, innocent-looking rat had stuck its head out. Its two soybean-sized eyes cautiously measured Luo Zheng and his companions. Its whiskers trembled in the air as it regarded them.</p>

  <p>"It's just a rat," Malcom sneered trying to brush past them to continue walking.</p>

  <p>"Be careful of those Murderous Rats!" Yolande warned seriously, restraining him with a raised arm.</p>

  <p>"What?!"</p>

  <p>Given all that had happened, everyone was jumpy and scared of everything around them. Besides, during this adventure, they had come to know Yolande better. If it wasn't extremely dangerous, she wouldn't raise the alarm at all.</p>

  <p>They all looked around vigilantly. Fabian and Jarrod had even drawn their swords to prepare for any possible enemy attack.</p>

  <p>"There are many more of those rats." Fabian saw that three to four rats were lurking behind each and every clump of grass up ahead.</p>

  <p>"Just some rats, not something you should worry about," Jarrod said while shaking his head in denial of the seriousness of the situation.</p>

  <p>"They're coming," Yolande warned again.</p>

  <p>Just then, everyone heard a squeaking sound. It was abnormally sharp and with very rhythmic variation in the sound, it seemed as if it was some form of communication.</p>

  <p>Hearing this squeaking sound, the innocent-looking rats seemed to grow restless. Their bean-sized black eyes were now glistening with ferocious luster. Their hair stood on end and appeared as sharp as needles.</p>

  <p>The rats were squeaking with excitement.</p>

  <p>Then, more of the Murderous Rats rushed out of their caves, and in the blink of an eye, the ground was full of them, crawling, running, and squeaking.</p>

  <p>Some of them were already rushing towards Luo Zheng, intent on devouring him alive!</p>

  <p>"Hump, those rats are so bold!" Malcom said and took two steps forward.</p>

  <p>Though one of his arms had been broken by Yolande, he could still try to scatter the rats by swinging his good arm. He lifted his foot and tried to kick them away.</p>

  <p>Malcom was wearing steel boots made of black iron. Given his massive body, even if he didn't use his forceful energy, he could still create a hole with just one kick of his leg.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>These Murderous Rats were however abnormally agile, and Malcom's kicks all missed.</p>

  <p>The five to six Murderous Rats dispersed quickly and scurried onto Malcom. Some of them even wormed their way into his armor and began to gnaw through his flesh!</p>

  <p>Malcom felt the sharp pain as their teeth sank into his skin, and he tried his best to endure the agony while cursing in rage. He reached out his hand to slap at them as they crawled over his body, and finally caught a Murderous Rat. He slammed the creature onto the ground heavily, turning it into a bloody mess under his heel.</p>

  <p>There was nothing special about these rats, except for them being annoyingly agile.</p>

  <p>However, more and more Murderous Rats were coming out of their nearby caves. If any of these warriors had been capable of using his or her life vitality, those rats would have been wiped out completely in mere seconds.</p>

  <p>Now, they all grew increasingly desperate.</p>

  <p>"Get out of here. Stay and we'll all die," Esther said as a rotating wheel appeared in her hand. The rotating wheel ruthlessly slaughtered the rats which dared come near her.</p>

  <p>"Let's go!" Fabian raised his sword, and it effectively pierced through dozens of Murderous Rats as he stabbed out with it.</p>

  <p>Seizing the opportunity, the warriors ran forward as quickly as possible.</p>

  <p>However, Malcom and Rehaan could only move slowly. Both of them wore heavy suits of armor which they had spent a great deal of money refining.</p>

  <p>Although wearing this armor could enhance the wearer's defense against attack by most enemies, the suits also hindered their mobility and agility.</p>

  <p>They were basically reduced to great lumbering metal plates.</p>

  <p>Without using their life vitality, the other warriors could still move quickly.</p>

  <p>After all, their bodies were enhanced as they had entered the nature level.</p>

  <p>Now, the open field had been filled with hundreds of those Murderous Rats.</p>

  <p>They were coming out of the caves by the dozen and they seemed to be unstoppable. Trapped and surrounded by these Murderous Rats, a warrior might soon be torn apart by them!</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's long sword lashed out at the rats, and dozens of them were instantly halved. However, hundreds of rats appeared on Zheng's left flank, forming into dark waves and coming at him with ferocious determination.</p>

  <p>Before he could respond, he was engulfed by thousands of rats. They packed all over his body, knocking him off from his feet.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng!" Fabian and Jarrod were greatly frightened by the sight of Luo Zheng being taken down.</p>

  <p>Yolande frowned, but didn't move or go to Zheng's rescue.</p>

  <p>Being surrounded and attacked by hundreds of rats, Esther couldn't get away or move to help Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Malcom and Rehaan were being badly bitten by the Murderous Rats, despite them being strong and tall. They tried to push forward, stamped their feet and shook their arms to get the rats off their bodies.</p>

  <p>Malcom grinned when he saw Luo Zheng fall down under the attack of the Murderous Rats. He had really wanted to kill Luo Zheng, despite them being in the same boat, but he hadn't been able to find an opportunity to murder him. If Luo Zheng was bitten to death by these disgusting creatures, then that would be more than satisfactory for Malcom.</p>

  <p>Xun, floating near Luo Zheng, stabbed at a rat with her long spear. She blinked then, and a faint smile appeared on her face. Suddenly Zheng's dangerous situation didn't seem to bother her at all.</p>

  <p>This damned place had really restricted these warriors' life vitality and forceful energy. However, Xun knew the secrets of Zheng's body. Even those common fairy weapons hadn't been able to leave a mark on Zheng's body, and these insignificant and disgusting rats were no threat to his safety either.</p>

  <p>The number of Murderous Rats pouncing on Luo Zheng had increased quickly, and he was soon completely engulfed by these creatures. As seconds passed by, the small hill forming over Luo Zheng became larger and larger. Soon it was a small mountain of rats which covered him!</p>

  <p>"Go get Luo Zheng!" Even now, Fabian couldn't forget his mission. After killing dozens of Murderous Rats, he rushed over to Luo Zheng, followed closely by Jarrod.</p>

  <p>Before he could reach Luo Zheng, Xun's long spear stretched before him and barred his path.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing? If we don't save him now, there'll be nothing left of him!" Fabian asked anxiously, his face filled with confusion. He knew that Xun was Zheng's sword spirit, and if he was killed, she wouldn't live either. However, Xun looked relaxed, bored even, and not at all concerned about Zheng's safety.</p>

  <p>Xun answered indifferently, "Don't worry, he's fine!"</p>

  <p>Just as she finished speaking, they saw the Murderous Rats which were gnawing at Zheng's body started to scatter in all directions. Then, they heard a muffled sound coming from where Luo Zheng was trapped.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>The thousands of rats on Zheng's body were all sent flying into the air at the same time, falling in all directions. Their bodies were crushed and they went limp.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng just stood there, in the nude, as his clothes had been torn apart by the rats. His body was barely bruised or hurt!</p>

  <p>Yolande stared at his naked body and blinked, wondering how could he have succeeded in resisting those disgusting rats. Meanwhile, Esther and Xun looked at Luo Zheng boldly. Since females enjoyed superior status to males in the Demon Night, his naked body didn't make them blush with embarrassment at all.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng's face had turned a bright red. Those rats had really embarrassed him! He hurriedly took a suit of clothes from his space ring which he donned while trying to avoid all the eyes which were focused on him.</p>
