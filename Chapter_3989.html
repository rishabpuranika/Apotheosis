<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Fuxi picked up the Augury Dog when they were passing by the neat row of thatched huts and held him in his arms.</p>

  <p>The Augury Dog was sensitive to all kinds of power. Now that they were on the Whining Road, the unpleasant aura around the place was beginning to overwhelm him. He looked sickly and weak.</p>

  <p>Every time Fuxi passed by a thatched hut with the dog in his arms, his glassy eyes glinted with obvious hostility.</p>

  <p>He probably understood that the things in the thatched huts were too strong for them, so he dared not bark wildly. Instead, he whimpered, trying not to let his voice be obvious.</p>

  <p>The Augury Dog continued to whimper as they walked past the first row of thatched huts.</p>

  <p>When they reached the end of the first row, Fuxi whispered to him, "Is there a thatched hut available for us?"</p>

  <p>The Augury Dog shook his head.</p>

  <p>Fuxi and the Snake Goddess exchanged a worried glance.</p>

  <p>When they had entered the Whining Road the last time, they had found a thatched hut in the front row pretty easily.</p>

  <p>Their luck seemed to have run out this time. All twenty-six thatched huts in the first row were occupied.</p>

  <p>"Let's try the second row!"</p>

  <p>Fuxi knew there was no time for them to lose. He hurriedly went to the second row with the Augury Dog in his arms.</p>

  <p>There were a lot of thatched huts in the second row as well. As before, the Augury Dog sniffed at each thatched hut and tried to find a safe place for them to stay.</p>

  <p>But they combed through the second row and the Augury Dog still couldn't find an unoccupied hut.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess blinked but didn't say a word, while Fuxi's face darkened. "The third row then!" he growled.</p>

  <p>The others following them remained silent, but they began to become more worried with every passing minute.</p>

  <p>It was true that Fuxi and the Snake Goddess had once made their way to the Supreme Pure Realm through this path. But their previous success now seemed to have stemmed out of sheer luck.</p>

  <p>And luck didn't seem to be on their side this time.</p>

  <p>If they couldn't find an available thatched hut this time, things would become hard for them— even harder than being under siege on the top of the Sky Ladder Plateau.</p>

  <p>There were seven rows of thatched huts in this area, like a large village in a savage land.</p>

  <p>Fuxi took the Augury Dog along to check on every thatched hut in the remaining five rows, but to no avail. His face looked ghastly pale, as if he was terribly ill.</p>

  <p>"It's getting late. The sky is much darker now," Zheng reminded them, looking up at the sky.</p>

  <p>This area was covered in white mist and it was hard to tell the time, but it was obvious that the sunlight had dimmed.</p>

  <p>Fuxi looked up, alert at this news, anxiety coursing through him.</p>

  <p>They would be in great trouble once night fell.</p>

  <p>Fuxi looked like an ant in a hot pot and the Snake Goddess took it upon herself to console him in a calm, soft voice. "There are more huts scattered around here. Let's check each of them out. There's no hurry, Fuxi. We still have time."</p>

  <p>The thatched huts in the middle of this area weren't the only ones. There were many others on the periphery.</p>

  <p>Drawing comfort from the Snake Goddess's words, Fuxi took a deep breath and nodded. He then walked towards the scattered thatched huts with the Augury Dog.</p>

  <p>He examined one thatched hut after the other but the result disappointed him yet again.</p>

  <p>The sky was already dark, night drawing close.</p>

  <p>"Since we need an unoccupied thatched hut, why don't we work together to drive the Treacherous Being in one of the huts away? Why should we go to all this trouble to find an empty one?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi grumbled impatiently, unable to stand it anymore.</p>

  <p>He thought that no matter how powerful the Treacherous Beings were, it wouldn't be a problem for them to tackle them.</p>

  <p>Even discounting Zheng, all the warriors present were collectively a force to be reckoned with in the Three Purities Stage.</p>

  <p>However, Eastern Emperor Taiyi had barely finished talking when a deep, angry howl suddenly sounded from the nearest thatched hut.</p>

  <p>It was hard to tell whether the voice was male or female. The howl seemed to contain an extraordinary magical power, causing everyone to cover their ears.</p>

  <p>More shrill wails followed the first howl, each emanating from a different thatched hut. The Treacherous Beings had begun to wake up in succession.</p>

  <p>"Oh no!"</p>

  <p>The Augury Dog in Fuxi's arms whimpered, terrified.</p>

  <p>"There are several more thatched huts over there. We can give them a try," the Snake Goddess pointed at a corner. There were six or seven thatched huts in the direction she was pointing.</p>

  <p>Fuxi didn't hesitate this time. He strode up to them, the Augury Dog still whimpering in his arms.</p>

  <p>The Augury Dog tried hard to quell his fear and sniff at each hut. When Fuxi passed by the third hut on the left, his eyes suddenly lit up with hope.</p>

  <p>"Thank God! This one is empty! Let's go in!"</p>

  <p>Zheng, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and the others were anxious as they followed.</p>

  <p>But the Augury Dog's words were instant in cheering all of them up.</p>

  <p>Fuxi lifted the flap of the hut and hurried inside, the others following closely behind.</p>

  <p>The thatched hut was almost as tall as the shrunken Wing King, but it was still barely tall enough to let him in. Upon noticing this, the Wing King had to shrink himself further. Only then did he dive into the hut.</p>

  <p>Fuxi didn't close the flap until the Wing King had entered the hut.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, the piercing howls that had lingered for so long in everyone's ears died out. And thanks to this, the discomfort that had haunted everyone was now finally gone.</p>

  <p>There was nothing inside the thatched hut apart from a wooden pillar at its center.</p>

  <p>This pillar, pockmarked with several fist-sized holes, seemed to have existed for a long time and looked like it would fall apart at any time.</p>

  <p>"The Whining Road is worthy of its name. It's terrifying enough even though we haven't encountered anything yet," King Ieuan commented solemnly.</p>

  <p>"Well, we wouldn't be talking like this if we had encountered something," said Fuxi with a wry smile.</p>

  <p>Yasamin breathed a sigh of relief before she asked, "How long will it take us to pass through the Whining Road?"</p>

  <p>"Thirty-two hours make for a day on the Whining Road. We only need to stay here for about three days," the Snake Goddess replied.</p>

  <p>Zheng had zoned out and had been staring at the pillar. At the Snake Goddess's words, he looked around, his eyebrows raised, and said, "We only need to stay safe for three days?"</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess nodded. "That's all, yes. We'll stay here for three days and after that, we'll return the way we came. We'll then be able to enter the Supreme Pure Realm."</p>

  <p>"I didn't know the Whining Road is such an easy path!" Thurston was surprised at the rules. The Eternal Realm Hunters had their own way to reach the Supreme Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>In fact, they had more than one way.</p>

  <p>But no matter which path they took, they would have to expend full courage and strength.</p>

  <p>In contrast, the Whining Road seemed too easy.</p>

  <p>"It can't be this simple," Sawyer said, shaking his head. "If this was the case, many more creatures and Eternal Realm warriors would've chosen this path and this path wouldn't be called the strangest of all. Don't forget that there are a bunch of Treacherous Beings outside."</p>

  <p>At the mention of the Treacherous Beings, it was as if the light was turned down, given how everyone's faces paled, their hearts sinking within them.</p>

  <p>"What on earth is a Treacherous Being?" King Ieuan asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Except for Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and the three Eternal Realm Hunters, no one else knew what their enemies on the Whining Road were or what a Treacherous Being was.</p>

  <p>"They have no specific form. They-" The Snake Goddess paused, trying to think up the correct word to describe them. After a while, she said, "It doesn't matter. When it gets darker, you'll be able to see them with your own eyes."</p>
