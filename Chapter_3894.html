<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>At that moment, a burst of blue light shone from a side of the large triangular pyramid.</p>

  <p>Upon closer inspection, it appeared that some obscure words formed tiny dots of light.</p>

  <p>When the blue light lit up, so did the orange light on the second side of the triangular pyramid, then the purple light on the third side, and the grey light under everyone's feet.</p>

  <p>Fuxi looked up at the triangular pyramid and frowned.</p>

  <p>The six Chaos Ancient Gods were undoubtedly strong, and they possessed extraordinary power of the truth-level theurgy, which relied on the chaos.</p>

  <p>Othniel gently raised his hand, and the four light rays quickly disappeared.</p>

  <p>Then, the blue light flashed again, and the space fluctuation immediately surrounded the triangular pyramid. In turn, the Grandmaster of Heaven, Zheng, Fuxi, and the Snake Goddess all fell.</p>

  <p>It turned out that the space rule in the triangular pyramid had changed.</p>

  <p>Since the rule that they adapted to wasn't applicable anymore, they could not stay in the air.</p>

  <p>However, they were aware of the space rule. As soon as the blue light flashed, they sensed that something was wrong. Therefore, they quickly adapted to the new space rule.</p>

  <p>Among them, the Snake Goddess was the fastest to adapt. After she fell for more than one hundred feet, she abruptly stopped mid-air.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Fuxi and the Grandmaster of Heaven managed to stop and float in the air almost simultaneously.</p>

  <p>The slowest one was Zheng.</p>

  <p>The blood in his body flowed around when the space rule had changed.</p>

  <p>Moreover, he understood the essence of the triangular pyramid through the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>He had obtained the method to break the triangular pyramid, but he still needed to adapt to the rule by himself.</p>

  <p>That was why he fell for over a thousand feet before he barely adapted to it.</p>

  <p>Othniel sneered when he saw that everyone had steadied themselves in just a short period. Then, the blue light dimmed, and the orange light flashed.</p>

  <p>The rule changed again!</p>

  <p>Everyone fell again, and they began to adapt to the new rule once more.</p>

  <p>But just as they had adapted to it, the orange light faded, and the purple light glowed.</p>

  <p>Othniel had set up a total of four space rules. Those sets of rules weren't that different from each other, but they could switch quickly.</p>

  <p>To put it simply, when the lights on the four sides of the triangular pyramid switched, the rules regularly changed.</p>

  <p>Even the Snake Goddess now found it hard to adapt to them. She had just adapted to the first rule, but in the next moment, she had to change for the second rule. Before she could fully adjust to the second one, she had to face the third rule!</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>The large triangular pyramid shone with four kinds of light. Zheng, the Grandmaster of Heaven, the Snake Goddess, and Fuxi finally fell hard to the bottom of the space.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the rules in the space were gone.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Othniel's body changed, and rapidly expanded, until he turned into a massive one-eyed monster.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven looked gravely at the one-eyed monster. After all, he had no choice but to fight a Chaos Ancient God who was in peak form, while his space theurgy was lacking.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>At that point, he also grew into a giant with a height of millions of feet.</p>

  <p>Since Othniel revealed his real body, then the Grandmaster of Heaven also activated the Wild God Body!</p>

  <p>The two gigantic creatures unleashed bursts of energy, which filled every corner of the space as if it was real. "It is better if the two of them get injured!" Fuxi yelled as he looked up at them.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter if they are injured or not. The most important thing is that we should leave, Master Fuxi!" a loud voice exclaimed behind him.</p>

  <p>Fuxi turned around and saw Zheng. He shook his head and said, "Leave? It might not be that easy to open this space!"</p>

  <p>He stood at the bottom of the triangular pyramid on his tiptoes. It wasn't easy to destroy such a tough space imprisonment.</p>

  <p>Zheng was still too young, and his idea was too simple. "Zheng, do you have a way to take us out?" the Snake Goddess slowly said as she stared at Zheng.</p>

  <p>Based on Zheng's tone, it seemed that he had controlled the Fishing Drum to release Othniel. Furthermore, Othniel could not resist at all because the Heart-piercing Lock had restrained him. It was likely that Zheng had broken the Heart-piercing Lock.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess didn't know how Zheng had such an incredible ability, but that was most likely related to the bloodline he had obtained. But what kind of bloodline could be so unbelievable?</p>

  <p>"What kind of way can he have?" Fuxi shrugged.</p>

  <p>Zheng glanced at Fuxi, squatted down, and gently scratched the ground with his finger. A circular mark appeared on the transparent ground.</p>

  <p>Clap!</p>

  <p>He pushed the mark hard, and then a round hole appeared.</p>

  <p>"What the hell is this method?" Fuxi's eyes widened.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess covered her mouth in shock, and smiled. She walked towards the round hole.</p>

  <p>No matter what kind of method it was, they should leave first.</p>

  <p>The three of them entered the hole, turned into three beams of light, and rushed into the space channel.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Othniel and the Grandmaster of Heaven were still in battle inside the triangular pyramid. The triangular pyramid completely isolated both their auras and voices.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven attacked in a slightly passive way since he still couldn't use the Space Law. However, he was still stronger than Othniel.</p>

  <p>The two of them fiercely kept fighting each other.</p>

  <p>Othniel had sensed that Zheng penetrated the triangular pyramid he had released, but he had no time to care about that because he currently focused on his battle against the Grandmaster of Heaven. Thus, he had no choice but to let Zheng run away.</p>

  <p>In the space channel, Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and Zheng all flew at high speed.</p>

  <p>Although they were still in danger, Fuxi couldn't wait to ask, "How did you do it? You shouldn't be able to suppress or control both the Fishing Drum and the Grandmaster of Heaven."</p>

  <p>When Zheng casually drew a circular mark just now, it looked simple, but Fuxi felt the unique energy from it. That energy was also a kind of space power, but it was very different from Othniel's.</p>

  <p>Othniel's space power came from the truth. And what kind of power did Zheng use?</p>

  <p>The opposite truth?</p>

  <p>He felt amused by his guess, but that was his intuition.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, the Snake Goddess attentively listened as she didn't have any baseless speculations.</p>

  <p>Since Zheng had entered the deepest part of the Eternal Scroll Painting and successfully came back, he must've obtained a unique bloodline power, and at least it was stronger than that of the Eye Spirit.</p>

  <p>"I can find a way to restrain the opponents in a short period of time," Zheng said.</p>

  <p>Fuxi narrowed his eyes and gently waved his hand at Zheng. The mark of the Eight Diagrams appeared on his body. "Is there any way to restrain it?"</p>

  <p>He had never heard of a theurgy that could restrain the Grandmaster of Heaven and Othniel in a short period, so of course, he wanted to verify it in person.</p>

  <p>In turn, Zheng got up and dusted his body. The mark of the Eight Diagrams just fell off him like dust.</p>

  <p>When Fuxi saw what happened, the corners of his eyes twitched.</p>
