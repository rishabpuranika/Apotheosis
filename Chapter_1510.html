  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was running at top speed along the True Path.</p>

  <p>The second half of the third section of the True Path had been secretly changed by Gus. He himself was the only test.</p>

  <p>Now that Luo Luo Zheng had defeated Gus, the Dark and Light energies no longer condensed, and there was no longer any resistance. Therefore, Luo Luo Zheng passed through the rest of the path with ease.</p>

  <p>Not long after, Freya, Livingston, and the others appeared in front of Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>After he passed through the True Path, a white light flashed in the sky as the dense fog dissipated. Then, it slowly descended. It was a token of the Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>Everyone's gazes, including Luo Zheng's, were focused on the token.</p>

  <p>Livingston screamed out, "A token! Is this the token used for opening the weapon refining workshop?"</p>

  <p>When it came to this adventure along the True Path, Livingston was the one who cared the most about the result.</p>

  <p>Saul said in his usual emotionless voice, "Except the tokens of heaven and earth, it could be any of the other six tokens. Weapon refining needs fire, so the token of fire is related to the weapon refining workshop. It's only a one-in-six chance."</p>

  <p>"A one-in-six chance!" exclaimed Livingston, shaking his metallic head.</p>

  <p>This probability was neither high nor low, and it immediately made him feel excited.</p>

  <p>The corners of Luo Zheng's lips curved up slightly. To him, anything was fine as long as the tokens didn't repeat themselves.</p>

  <p>As the token slowly descended, Luo Luo Zheng reached his hand out to grab it and flipped it over.</p>

  <p>"What token is it?" Livingston waved his sharp claws, looking extremely excited.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng gently waved his hand and, with a smile, showed the token to Livingston. On the front of the token, the word "fire" was impressively carved in large letters.</p>

  <p>Livingston tossed his head back in a howl of berserk laughter. "It really is the token of fire! Luck is on my side. The heavens have given me what I want!"</p>

  <p>Freya, Xun, and even Saul couldn't help but roll their eyes at Livingston.</p>

  <p>The Immortal Mansion was a place that surpassed the heavens. The things above the heavens had nothing to do with Livingston's luck.</p>

  <p>If anything, this was Luo Zheng's luck.</p>

  <p>After obtaining the token of fire, the group walked back to the main courtyard of the Immortal Mansion and followed the path in the pavilion. As Luo Luo Zheng activated the token in his hand, the door to the weapon refining workshop opened.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was the first to enter, and Livingston, who could hardly wait, followed right behind him.</p>

  <p>After entering the workshop, Luo Luo Zheng looked around in surprise.</p>

  <p>There were all sorts of materials placed around the workshop, layer upon layer.</p>

  <p>"These materials..." Not far away, Luo Luo Zheng saw a pile of wood. These pieces of wood had been cut into one-inch-thick blocks and were piled up like mountains. What was strange were the rings on the pieces of wood that looked like strange ghost heads.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was not proficient in weapon refining. Although he sensed a special kind of power from the wood, he had no idea what kind of wood this was.</p>

  <p>And it wasn't just him. Freya didn't know either. Even Xun, who was much more knowledgeable than Luo Luo Zheng and Freya, was at a loss.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng wanted to grab a piece of wood casually, but before he could touch it, he heard a sharp cry from Livingston.</p>

  <p>"Stop!"</p>

  <p>Clank! Clank!</p>

  <p>After the scream, Livingston quickly squeezed his way to Luo Zheng's side, stretched out his claws, and said with a trembling voice, "This is... This is Primeval Death Spirit Wood!"</p>

  <p>At first, Livingston didn't know what kind of wood this was either.</p>

  <p>But in this short period of time, he had read all the books about weapon refining in the library, and he had come across records of Primeval Death Spirit Wood.</p>

  <p>"What is Primeval Death Spirit Wood?" Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>In a shaky voice, Livingston answered, "The tree has no bark or leaves.</p>

  <p>All it has is a bare trunk."</p>

  <p>"How does it grow without bark or leaves?" Freya asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Livingston laughed, and then excitedly explained, "I just learned about the Primeval Death Spirit Wood from the books in the library. I thought it only existed in legends, but surprisingly, it actually exists in real life.</p>

  <p>The tree grows because of the countless dead people that are buried beneath it. Although it doesn't have bark or leaves, it has stems that can absorb the nutrients from corpses. It grows very slowly. For example, it will take at least 300 million years to grow from the seedling stage to the wood we see. It needs to absorb trillions of dead souls to stay alive. My word, there really is such a tree!"</p>

  <p>The difficulty of cultivating Primeval Death Spirit Wood was beyond imagination.</p>

  <p>It wasn't just because it grew slowly. It was actually a very fragile tree that could only survive by absorbing dead souls. That meant that corpses had to be constantly buried under it.</p>

  <p>If it needed only hundreds of years to grow, it would not be a big problem. Some large clans and sacred places could bury the corpses of their martial artists under the tree, so that it could absorb their souls.</p>

  <p>However, the tree needed hundreds of millions of years to grow.</p>

  <p>What did hundreds of millions of years mean?</p>

  <p>It was equivalent to the lifespan of a Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>Moreover, during these hundreds of millions of years, nothing could go wrong. If the smallest thing went wrong, the tree would wither and die.</p>

  <p>The difficulty of nurturing the wood was evident.</p>

  <p>That was why when, a while ago, Livingston had found the records of Primeval Death Spirit Wood in the books on weapon refining, he hadn't taken it seriously. He had thought that such a thing simply did not exist in the world. Even a Supreme Lord would not be able to cultivate such wood, because if the slightest mistake was made during the hundreds of millions of years, then the tree would be lost altogether.</p>

  <p>But now, a pile of Primeval Death Spirit Wood had appeared in front of Livingston. He was so excited that he almost couldn't believe his own eyes.</p>

  <p>Seeing the indifferent expressions of Luo Luo Zheng and the others, Livingston could barely wait to tell them about the history of the Primeval Death Spirit Wood.</p>

  <p>"But what is it used for?" After Luo Luo Zheng heard what Livingston said, he looked curiously at the wood. It was indeed something of great origin.</p>

  <p>The existence of something that needed so much care over hundreds of millions of years seemed almost impossible.</p>

  <p>Livingston laughed and said proudly, "The Primeval Death Spirit Wood can produce the mixed element flame, which is one of the most perfect flames."</p>

  <p>"The most perfect flame?" Luo Zheng's eyes flashed.</p>

  <p>Livingston began to show off his knowledge. He knew much more about the materials for weapon refining than the others present. Moreover, he had broadened his horizons in the library. After he read so many weapon refining books, his knowledge had expanded by more than ten times.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it's one of the three most perfect flames. By 'perfect, ' I mean that they are the most suitable for weapon refining. Other than the mixed element flame, there are two other perfect flames. One is the Sun Spring essence flame, and the other is the divine flame. These two types of perfect flames are not easily obtainable. It is said that the Sun Spring essence flame exists exclusively in the Sun Spring. As for the divine flame, it is said that it is born within the Divine Flame Cauldron."</p>

  <p>At first, Luo Luo Zheng had no interest in Livingston's answer.</p>

  <p>However, when Livingston mentioned the Divine Flame Cauldron, Luo Zheng's eyes suddenly flashed.</p>

  <p>It turned out that the black flame within the Divine Flame Cauldron was the divine flame, one of the three perfect flames.</p>

  <p>Livingston, however, didn't notice the change in Luo Zheng's expression and continued to impart his knowledge to the others even though he himself had only learned these things a while ago.</p>

  <p>While he was speaking, his eyes fell on a nearby weapon refining furnace.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Livingston casually threw away the Primeval Death Spirit Wood in his hand and rushed toward the furnace, which was placed in a corner of the workshop.</p>

  <p>It had a very unique shape; the bottom was thin and the top was thick. It looked like a large wine pot, with the mouth missing.</p>

  <p>Livingston threw himself at the furnace and opened the door at the side of the furnace. Soon, a rainbow-colored light shot out from within.</p>

  <p>Surprisingly, the furnace was still burning, and there was a red-hot sword embryo lying inside.</p>

  <p>Obviously, the sword embryo had been burned for hundreds of millions of years in the furnace.</p>
