  <p>
</p>

  <p>Once a round of chaos was destroyed, the rules of the new chaos would suppress everything from the last chaos.</p>

  <p>Creatures, objects, and even consciousness would be rejected.</p>

  <p>All creatures, except the Chaos Ancient Gods who had comprehended the truth, had to enter the Other Shore to save their lives. That was the only way.</p>

  <p>The space where King Manard lived was separated from the chaos. It was true that he could avoid the Deleting Pillars and control this space. But he could only hide in there, just like the creatures on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>"Another Other Shore..." Luo Zheng muttered, his eyebrows rising.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 and the Green Jade Spirit were taken aback. They had always only seen this space as a recycle bin. But this space could avoid being involved in the extinction of the chaos. It was indeed another Other Shore.</p>

  <p>A smile appeared on King Manard's face as he said, "I actually plan to turn this place into another Other Shore that belongs only to the human race.</p>

  <p>Other races won't be allowed to enter it!"</p>

  <p>The Other Shore was complicated. There were not only a number of Souls of Light, but also different kinds of creatures.</p>

  <p>How terrifying would it be if a race were able to occupy the Other Shore?</p>

  <p>What an ambitious man King Manard was!</p>

  <p>This news was good for the human race, of course. Luo Zheng thought for a moment before asking, "But how do the creatures in the chaos enter this space?"</p>

  <p>Mount and the Chaos Ancient God behind him controlled the entrance to this space. King Manard couldn't make sure that the Chaos Ancient God was on his side.</p>

  <p>King Manard asked calmly, "How do the creatures in the chaos enter the Other Shore?"</p>

  <p>"By cultivating the Truth of Divine Dao, of course," replied Luo Zheng without hesitation.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 and the Green Jade Spirit exchanged a nervous glance. They had a premonition.</p>

  <p>A sudden thought occurred to Luo Zheng. "Is there a Truth of Divine Dao that can bring the creatures here?"</p>

  <p>King Manard smiled meaningfully. He reached out a hand, and the red, yellow, and blue energies spiraled upwards. "I have devoted my life to this Truth of Divine Dao. I name it the Truth of Three-energy Construction."</p>

  <p>"You created a Truth of Divine Dao?" No. 9527's eyebrows were arched in supercilious surprise.</p>

  <p>"How is that possible?" The Green Jade Spirit also looked confused.</p>

  <p>Everything they had seen and heard today was against what they had learned over the years.</p>

  <p>The Green Jade Spirit knew more than No. 9527. He had been the one to spread all the Sanskrit words from the Other Shore. The thirteen Truths of Divine Dao should have been created by the first civilization.</p>

  <p>Special Other Shore Tokens were often discovered, but no one had ever created any Truth of Divine Dao!</p>

  <p>King Manard mixed the three kinds of energy and turned them into a single ball of black energy.</p>

  <p>As the black energy rolled forward, it came to a stop after turning into a stone statue shaped like a horse's head.</p>

  <p>"Void construction!" Luo Zheng's eyes twitched in excitement.</p>

  <p>Void construction was supposed to be accomplished in one's inner world.</p>

  <p>But King Manard had made a stone statue by taking advantage of the Truth of Three-energy Construction.</p>

  <p>His actions had shocked Luo Zheng, No. 9527, and the Green Jade Spirit.</p>

  <p>A resounding crack sounded.</p>

  <p>King Manard had pinched the statue of the horse head gently and crushed it into pieces. He said, "The thirteen Truths of Divine Dao were created by the Instant Civilization, but the Element Spirit Civilization had emasculated all of them. They have lost their corresponding theurgies. When we fought a bloody battle with the Element Spirit Civilization in Stage Thirty Two, the Element Spirit race had suffered a great loss. Since then, all the Truths of Divine Dao have lost their corresponding power."</p>

  <p>"The human race used to be so powerful? They fought against the Element Spirit Civilization?" The Green Jade Spirit was even more surprised.</p>

  <p>The Green Jade Civilization had been strong, but not strong enough to fight the Element Spirit Civilization. The Green Jade Spirit had never expected the human race to be this glorious on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>But the 77th civilization was countless years away from the 749th civilization. After the human race had been defeated and went into their hiding, their legends had disappeared. It wasn't surprising that the Green Jade Spirit had never heard of them.</p>

  <p>The corner of King Manard's mouth curled upwards. He didn't respond to the Green Jade Spirit. The previous human race had certainly not been a small and weak race.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng thought for a moment before asking, "The Truths of Divine Dao were emasculated?"</p>

  <p>King Manard smiled and looked at Luo Zheng. "What's wrong?" he said. "Did you notice it?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shook his head and said, "No. When I practiced the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, I accidentally got two Sanskrit words of the Truth Enlightenment, which were able to complete the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent. I wonder if these two Sanskrit words belong to the emasculated part."</p>

  <p>King Manard stared at Luo Zheng. "Show me what you've got," he said.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded, closed his eyes, and meditated, reciting in silence.</p>

  <p>Soon, a white cyclone emerged in Luo Zheng's brain. He hadn't learned many words of the Truth Enlightenment but he was able to easily create this cyclone.</p>

  <p>The moment King Manard saw the cyclone, he nodded and said, "You can stop."</p>

  <p>"Is this the emasculated part?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>King Manard nodded. "You could say that. Someone has deliberately released the Truth Enlightenment that you are talking about."</p>

  <p>Once Eastern Emperor Taiyi got the yellow paper, he deciphered and learned the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent from it. He then built the base of the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>Only Eastern Emperor Taiyi knew how he got the yellow paper, whether he had come upon it by accident or someone had given it to him.</p>

  <p>"Have the emasculated parts of any other Truths of Divine Dao apart from the Truth Enlightenment been passed down?" King Manard asked.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shook his head. "I've never heard of it."</p>

  <p>King Manard looked at No. 9527. No. 9527 replied, "No."</p>

  <p>"The thirteen Truths of Divine Dao of the 749th civilization must have been incomplete as well," the Green Jade Spirit replied.</p>

  <p>A thought crossed Luo Zheng's mind and he said, "It's not just that. We can't practice the Truth of Powerful Holy Body now. It's impossible to use the physical body to enter the Other Shore."</p>

  <p>"The Truth of Powerful Holy Body is prohibited?" At this news, King Manard was plunged deep in thought. It was a while before he smiled and said, "Those hiding on the Other Shore began to be afraid."</p>

  <p>The human race had never been weak. It was precisely to see this day that they had been hiding themselves for so many years.</p>

  <p>"But if you want to build this place into an Other Shore, where can we find the Other Shore Tokens? How can we obtain the Other Shore Power?" Luo Zheng asked again, confused.</p>

  <p>King Manard pointed to the void in the distance and said, "The Other Shore Tokens are over there."</p>

  <p>There were many remains floating in the air.</p>

  <p>"?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, No. 9527, and the Green Jade Spirit were rendered speechless.</p>

  <p>It was a strange sight, the remains floating in the air. It was stranger that King Manard believed that these remains were Other Shore Tokens. But they had to take him at his word.</p>
