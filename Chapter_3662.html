<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Phoenix along with the rest of the Jin Wu stood by and watched Luo Zheng soar into the air, without a word.</p>

  <p>On the one hand, they hoped Luo Zheng would finally perish this way, but on the other, they still worried about him almost instinctively.</p>

  <p>The common contradicting feelings left them in an uncomfortable position.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>The moment Luo Zheng left the enchanted barrier, his physical body turned blazing white. He could barely open his eyes in the strong light.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Sanskrit words began appearing on his body, spinning ceaselessly and frantically absorbing the heat.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The Corpse Spirit Sun Crow was normally immune to water and fire, but after it reached ten thousand feet outside the barrier, its feathers started burning.</p>

  <p>"How powerful these flames are!" Luo Zheng exclaimed in awe.</p>

  <p>He didn't know what kind of method Emperor Ji used to create the crow beneath him. Its defensive power was extremely astonishing. Even if the members of the Jin Wu were highly powerful, they couldn't burn the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow, nor could they tear it apart by trapping it in fire.</p>

  <p>But as it approached ten thousand feet high in the air, its feathers were already burnt. Luo Zheng wondered how terrifying the suns' temperature was.</p>

  <p>He wasn't certain if he could withstand it himself.</p>

  <p>But at this point, there was no way back.</p>

  <p>On the back of the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow, Luo Zheng stood upright, his eyes flashing with determination as the crow then rapidly sped up.</p>

  <p>The nine suns were still in the midst of expanding, slowly moving south.</p>

  <p>They were no doubt about to pour all their heat into the North Mysterious City.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng continued to rise, the temperature rose along with him.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>The surface of the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow beneath Luo Zheng's feet was crackling from burning.</p>

  <p>The bones of the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow turned to ashes.</p>

  <p>Once the bones of the wings exploded, the rest of the crow was completely destroyed.</p>

  <p>In another bursting sound, the creature collapsed, falling to the ground.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Luo Zheng merely took a step and flew upward on his own.</p>

  <p>"Is this distance enough?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>He had already risen to about eighty thousand feet in the air, with the nine suns like white mountains above his head. While they appeared close because of the sheer size, there was still a considerable distance until Luo Zheng reached them.</p>

  <p>"Not enough," Houyi said plainly.</p>

  <p>Frowning, Luo Zheng continued moving upward.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The golden whirlpools continued circling, sucking in the heat. On the surface of Luo Zheng's body, they seemed like little monsters devouring flames like food.</p>

  <p>Finding no damage done to his physical body, Luo Zheng sighed in relief.</p>

  <p>If even the Nine-Sun World Destruction Theurgy couldn't burn him to death, there was unlikely any fire in the world that could touch him.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng continued rising rapidly, something sour was unfolding in the North Mysterious City.</p>

  <p>Many powerful warriors began taking turns activating the enchanted barrier to resist the scorching suns. But even as they did all they could, the time they managed to maintain the barrier was only lessening.</p>

  <p>Despair spread throughout the city.</p>

  <p>The Oneness Guards, the Other Shore Realm warriors, and a great number of Oneness Generals were all losing hope. Even the Chaotic Source Realm warriors couldn't hold on for much longer. Once the enchanted barrier was destroyed, they'd die along with it.</p>

  <p>Above the transmission array stood Li Bianxue, holding a thin sword in her hand.</p>

  <p>Her bright eyes looked around vigilantly, examining her surroundings.</p>

  <p>Previously, she managed to quell the turmoil in the city and stabilize its situation by killing a warrior as a warning to the rest.</p>

  <p>But as the enchanted barrier above the city continued deteriorating, everyone could feel how critical the situation was getting. It was likely that the mountain masters were to fall any minute, leaving everyone else to burn as the city was burned to ashes.</p>

  <p>"I have to go ahead!" an Oneness General guarding an area nearby roared and shot toward the transmission array like an arrow.</p>

  <p>The rest of the Oneness Generals had the same thought, following suit and going for the array.</p>

  <p>"Get out of my way!"</p>

  <p>In the lead, the Oneness General dashed forward and punched the air before the transmission array.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>In terms of strength, the Oneness General was far superior to the Other Shore Realm warriors. In a single punch, the wave of impact sent the people near the transmission array flying out.</p>

  <p>"How dare you!"</p>

  <p>Li Bianxue felt her brows raise at the scene, slashing at the Oneness General's head with her thin sword, triggering the sword's radiance to shoot out.</p>

  <p>Among the many Oneness Generals, that man was the best. While he was once on the second floor of the Land of Sword Grief like many, his current strength was enough to allow him to enter the third floor. He didn't even bother dodging Li Bianxue's attack, as he knew it wasn't at full power. Instead, he reached out to block it.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, a black shield appeared in his grasp. Li Bianxue's sword radiance was blocked with a clatter against the shield.</p>

  <p>Frustrated, Li Bianxue turned over and continued relentlessly stabbing her sword at the Oneness General.</p>

  <p>"Da! Da! Da!"</p>

  <p>The dense rays of sword radiance pierced toward her opponent like a series of violent winds and rain, but the Oneness General had no trouble raising his defense and easily blocking the attacks with his shield.</p>

  <p>But Li Bianxue's full strength was still greater than that of the Oneness General.</p>

  <p>As more and more long and thin rays of sword radiance approached, the Oneness General still had to take a few steps back. As a result, the distance between him and the transmission array was growing wider.</p>

  <p>In the battle against the Jin Wu, the Oneness General had proven to be truly brave and courageous. When he guarded the North Pool Pass, never had he taken a step back. However, his current situation left him with nearly no chance to escape. Li Bianxue's sword attacks forced him back quite a bit, making him grow even more indignant.</p>

  <p>"If you won't let me live, everyone else must die!" the Oneness General roared as he burned the black shield in his grip.</p>

  <p>His face twisted in extreme pain, and the black shield turned into dark fragments, merging into his fist.</p>

  <p>With a sudden wave of his hand, he smashed his fist into the transmission array.</p>

  <p>The sight had Li Bianxue shocked. The Oneness General was by no means inferior to her in status, so she had no intention to kill him. All she did was to force him back? never did she expect him to go to such extremes and fight for his life.</p>

  <p>Once the Other Shore Token was burnt, the power of the punch was truly formidable. Even Li Bianxue, who was undoubtedly powerful, couldn't withstand its force head-on.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>Along with a great rumble, the transmission array had been smashed into pieces, and the many Other Shore Realm warriors who were lining up were affected.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the masters of the mountains had their attention fixed on the suns in the sky. They were all racking their brains, trying to figure out a way to buy some time and open up enchanted barriers to allow the others to retreat. Even the Jin Wu was helping them out.</p>

  <p>The loud rumble drew everyone's attention. Even the mountain leaders were shocked upon witnessing the scene.</p>

  <p>A considerable distance stood between the North Mysterious City and the border of the North Unicorn Province. Even if a mountain leader used the Grand Teleportation technique, jumping back to the Bloom Divine Province in a single move was still impossible.</p>

  <p>The transmission array remained the only means to leave the North Unicorn Province. No one expected it to be destroyed so suddenly. Now they lost their only way to retreat.</p>
