<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>If he counted the crystal core of the queen blade locust, Luo Luo Zheng would be able to exchange all the cores for one thousand and five hundred points.</p>

  <p>As a new disciple who had joined Cloud Sect less than a month ago, Luo Luo Zheng had accumulated one thousand five hundred points through his effort. If the other disciples knew about this, they would sigh at the injustice of fate.</p>

  <p>Early on the sixth day, Luo Luo Zheng prepared to hunt with the Green Haze Group.</p>

  <p>They went into the jungle and killed two flocks of blade locusts. While the soldiers were stripping the corpses off their crystal cores, Martin asked Luo Luo Zheng, "You said that as long as you stay here, the conspirators will plan another attack on you. But nothing has happened in the past few days. What happened to them?"</p>

  <p>Since Luo Luo Zheng had promised to help Martin get his revenge, Martin hadn't reported Randall to the main camp. Martin knew that his complaint would backfire as he had no evidence and his superiors at the main camp wouldn't believe him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had reassured Martin that they would take action again, but it had been several days, and no one had come for Luo Luo Zheng. Martin was understandably anxious.</p>

  <p>"I didn't expect these guys to be so patient. Don't worry. We will kill our blade locusts and wait," said Luo Luo Zheng. He pulled out the crystal core of a leader of the blade locust and stuffed it into his space ring.</p>

  <p>Sensing tension in the air, Luo Luo Zheng looked up and said, "I've just praised the conspirators for their patience. But it seems that they can no longer wait."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was more acute than the average people. He was able to feel a person's intent to kill from far away.</p>

  <p>After a while, three men came out of the jungle.</p>

  <p>Liam of Drizzle Peak led the way. Behind him walked two men. One was dark-skinned, and the other was white-skinned. Luo Luo Zheng had seen them in the military camp's yard before. He had been deeply impressed by their contrasting skin colors.</p>

  <p>Liam came closer and sneered, "You know we want to kill you, but you still stay in the Dragon Fort. You are bold enough to step out of town and hunt blade locusts. Are you confident or are you stupid?"</p>

  <p>During these six days, they had many chances to kill Luo Luo Zheng, but they had waited patiently.</p>

  <p>They needed to study the relationship between Roger and Luo Luo Zheng before making their move. They wondered why a young master of a noble clan would help a humble civilian like Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Since this matter involved two noble clans, the Meng Clan and the Zhuge Clan, the three conspirators knew they needed to handle the issue with caution. Otherwise, they would face the wrath of both noble clans.</p>

  <p>After six days of observation and gathering intelligence, they had reached a conclusion.</p>

  <p>Roger and Luo Luo Zheng had met by chance and adventured along with the Green Haze Group. In fact, their friendship was not deep.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng persuaded Roger to intervene and save Martin's life. Roger just did Luo Luo Zheng this favor, nothing special.</p>

  <p>Now that they were sure that Luo Luo Zheng and Roger were not friends, their concerns about the Meng Clan getting involved were gone, and they could proceed boldly.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng narrowed his eyes and pointed at Liam. "You followed me all the way from Cloud Sect to kill me. I haven't settled this matter with you.</p>

  <p>How can I leave? It has been six days since your last attempt. Since then, you have not dared to come out. I overestimated you," Luo Luo Zheng sighed and shook his head.</p>

  <p>Despite facing strong enemies, Luo Luo Zheng did not show any traces of timidity.</p>

  <p>He had been refined by the fire of the earth's core and stepped into the rank of spiritual weapon a few days ago. Now, he wanted to see how much his strength had improved.</p>

  <p>Liam and his two co-conspirators were just practice targets for Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Liam's heartbeat quickened when he saw the confidence in Luo Zheng's eyes.</p>

  <p>He didn't understand why he felt afraid when he faced Luo Luo Zheng, a person who was only at the marrow refining level. 'He must be putting on a show of confidence. He's not that strong.' Liam reassured himself. He didn't want to be known that he was afraid.</p>

  <p>"Really? Since you can't wait to end your life, then we will help you," said Liam with feigned placidity. Liam waved his hand toward his companions and said, "Black Fiend and White Fiend, my friends. Kill him now!" Liam grinned at Luo Luo Zheng and retreated.</p>

  <p>White Fiend and Black Fiend had been restless all this while. They had stayed at the Dragon Fort for many days. Killing Luo Luo Zheng should have been a short day's work. However, this assignment had stretched to well over a week. So they were very displeased.</p>

  <p>A fierce fight was about to begin. Soon a constant flow of life vitality was running through White Fiend and Black Fiend's bodies.</p>

  <p>The two Fiends slowly approached Luo Luo Zheng. A cold smile danced on their faces as they imagined the pain they would mete out to Luo Luo Zheng. Luo Luo Zheng could feel the pressure in the air that only those at the nature refining level possessed.</p>

  <p>"Green Haze Group, get ready to fight!" shouted Martin.</p>

  <p>As soon as the soldiers heard Martin's order, they wielded their weapons and rushed into battle formation.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng waved his hand to stop Martin. He quickly explained,</p>

  <p>"You don't have to get involved in this. They came for me, and I have to deal with them myself."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stepped forward to prepare for the battle. The Green Haze Group had lost so many soldiers because of Luo Luo Zheng. He didn't want to involve them any more.</p>

  <p>Black Fiend and White Fiend emitted strange laughter when they heard Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Not only will you die today, but the whole Green Haze Group will also die with you."</p>

  <p>"If I were you, I would kneel and kill myself at once. Now fall into our hands, you will die miserably."</p>

  <p>After saying that, White Fiend and Black Fiend mutated their life vitality into black and white smog. In the next instant, the smog turned into two pythons and swept along the ground toward Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>'They are releasing their life vitality, ' thought Luo Luo Zheng while dodging two Fiends' attacks.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng was confident of his body, which had become a spiritual weapon, he still needed to be cautious. After all, this was the first time he was facing cultivators at the nature refining level. What made the fight even more challenging was that he was fighting two people at the same time.</p>
