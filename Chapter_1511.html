  <p>
</p>

  <p>The sword embryo was a piece of the Star Essence Iron that had been forged before. As soon as Livingston's eyes landed on it, they were glued to it.</p>

  <p>The sword embryo was not a refined one. It had been absorbing the flames from the furnace for many years, so it exuded a rainbow-colored light.</p>

  <p>The craft of weapon refining was very complicated.</p>

  <p>The process involved lots of steps, and refining a high-grade weapon needed more operations. The higher the grade of the weapon, the more intricate the process of refining it.</p>

  <p>The most crucial step of refining a weapon was smelting the metal.</p>

  <p>Many unimaginable materials existed in this world, such as the Star Essence Iron, which was derived from a star known as the 'Dark Star'.</p>

  <p>The Dark Star was very small and it could not shine, so it was tough to locate it.</p>

  <p>Every substance made out of the Dark Star was surprisingly heavy.</p>

  <p>Even a piece of it the size of a fingertip could weigh as much as a hundred thousand mountains. Undoubtedly, the Star Essence Iron weighed a lot more.</p>

  <p>It was almost indestructible.</p>

  <p>Even if someone was to obtain a piece of the Star Essence Iron, it would be difficult to preserve it. After all, it was too heavy.</p>

  <p>Once upon a time, a peerless master had taken a piece of the Star Essence Iron from the bare Dark Star, but he had no way of keeping it.</p>

  <p>When this piece fell to the ground, it directly penetrated into the earth, forming a small but bottomless hole.</p>

  <p>Storing the Star Essence Iron was indeed asking for trouble. Once, someone had tried to place it into the Sumeru Space, but the weight of it instantly broke through and smashed the space.</p>

  <p>However, such a problem could not defeat humans. The warriors of this universe were brave in the face of all difficulties and tried to figure out the solutions to them with their endless efforts.</p>

  <p>It had happened that once, someone used a weaker material to create a bracket and then placed the Star Essence Iron on the top of the bracket.</p>

  <p>Three hundred thousand giant logs were then used to build up a huge chassis under the bracket to support the iron's weight, with eight million divine textures placed around it as well.</p>

  <p>The bracket finally succeeded in holding the Star Essence Iron. The eight million divine textures were simultaneously activated and supported the huge chassis as well as the bracket to hold the Star Essence Iron.</p>

  <p>Before this activation, when the piece of Star Essence Iron was placed onto the bracket, the entire chassis sunk thousands of feet deep into the ground due to the massive weight, forming a huge crater.</p>

  <p>It was only after activating the eight million divine textures and forming a powerful floating force that the chassis finally stopped sinking down and was able to support the piece of the Star Essence Iron.</p>

  <p>But the eight million divine textures consumed life vitality jades at every moment. Keeping this piece of the Star Essence Iron in the supreme world required tens of thousands of life vitality jades a day. It was a massive expense for a year.</p>

  <p>The piece of the Star Essence Iron before them, however, was laid casually in the middle of the furnace.</p>

  <p>The furnace, obviously, had to take the mass weight of the Star Essence Iron. So did the ground beneath the furnace.</p>

  <p>Livingston circled the furnace a few times, and then told the others about the origin of the Star Essence Iron.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, Freya, and Xun were all petrified by it. Only Saul looked calm.</p>

  <p>Saul had come across such things too many times by now, so he was not caught by surprise anymore.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, as the current owner of this Immortal Mansion, could not express his astonishment. It would be mortifying for him to reveal his ignorance in this aspect.</p>

  <p>'That explains it!' Luo Luo Zheng finally realized something.</p>

  <p>The Star Essence Iron could be kept here easily like other ordinary items, which meant that the structure of the Immortal Mansion was distinctly tough.</p>

  <p>No wonder that when the group of Supreme Lords had been attacking on the outside for so long, the enormous Immortal Mansion never shook once.</p>

  <p>As Livingston finished talking about the origin of the Star Essence Iron, his brows knitted together, the expression on his face betraying the bitterness he felt in his heart. "I can see that this sword embryo has been here for countless years. With its weight, it's impossible to process it with my current abilities. Forget forging it, I won't be able to move it at all?"</p>

  <p>Even the smallest piece of the Star Essence Iron was incredibly heavy.</p>

  <p>This sword embryo, however, was four feet long. A supreme world would find it hard to take on such mass weight.</p>

  <p>Listening to what Livingston said, Luo Luo Zheng agreed with him. At the same time, he smiled and said, "Even if you possessed the ability to process it into a sword, I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to lift it."</p>

  <p>When Saul heard their conversation, he walked to a corner of the weapon refining workshop and took out a light cyan pair of pincers.</p>

  <p>It was a common pair of pincers, but since it had been placed in here, it was obviously special.</p>

  <p>If made to touch the burning flames of the furnace, an ordinary pair of metal pincers would melt down instantly. However, Saul placed the pair of pincers into the furnace and firmly gripped the sword embryo with it and smiled, "You both can try."</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Livingston reached out with his sharp claws at once. He had created this body for himself for the sake of weapon refining. The claws were just about perfect to grab onto the end of the pair of pincers.</p>

  <p>Livingston hoped to lift it up.</p>

  <p>What happened next did not come as a surprise. The sword embryo did not move at all!</p>

  <p>It was as if it was embedded into the furnace.</p>

  <p>Obviously, it was not truly embedded in it. This just meant that the sword embryo was heavy beyond measure.</p>

  <p>According to Livingston, a piece of the Star Essence Iron the size of a fingertip could weigh as much as a hundred thousand mountains.</p>

  <p>Compared to that, the sword embryo before them must weigh tens of millions of mountains. Or even more, if one were to calculate the weight.</p>

  <p>If anyone could pick up this sword embryo, he or she would have enough strength to lift up a great world.</p>

  <p>Livingston withdrew his claws and stepped aside.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng immediately took the pair of pincers from Livingston and looked at the four feet long sword embryo. He used the pair of pincers to grab it.</p>

  <p>As his eyes narrowed, the dragon scales in his body was activated and their power started to surge toward his arms.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Luo Luo Zheng experienced renewed strength. The muscles in his body seemed to inflate. The faint sound of growing bones could be heard.</p>

  <p>"Still not moving?" Freya neared him and stared at the sword embryo, gently shaking her head. No matter how strong Luo Luo Zheng was, he could not lift up a great world. So how could he move the sword embryo?</p>

  <p>In the end, Luo Luo Zheng had no choice but to release his grip. A helpless smile surfaced on his face and he gave the pair of pincers to Saul.</p>

  <p>Saul returned the pair of pincers to its original place. But when he got back to the furnace, he held another pair of pincers in his hand.</p>

  <p>It was a black pair of pincers with carved lines on its surface.</p>

  <p>"Is this pair of pincers made out of wood?" Curiosity was all over Luo Zheng's features.</p>

  <p>Many people knew that fire and wood neutralized each other. A metal pair of pincers would melt in these rainbow-colored flames. Would this wooden pair of pincers not burn in an instant?</p>

  <p>"Master, you can try first," Saul said with a smile.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded quietly. He reached to take the pair of pincers and was dumbstruck when he held it. "Eh? This pair of pincers... It's weightless!"</p>

  <p>Everything in this world had weight.</p>

  <p>Even the air had weight. The clouds floating in the sky turned into water upon condensing. The weight of the water was then equal to the weight of the clouds. Similarly, although paper and feathers were all very light, they still had a certain amount of weight.</p>

  <p>However, the pair of pincers in Luo Zheng's hand was actually weightless. He did not feel as if he was holding something light in his hands. It was like he was not holding anything at all. The pair of pincers was entirely without weight.</p>

  <p>Saul laughed, "Master, you can try to lift the embryo with this pair of pincers."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was curious as he looked at the pair of pincers. Since Saul had requested him to try to lift the sword embryo with it, he stuck the pair of pincers into the furnace with some hesitation. It then clamped onto the sword embryo.</p>

  <p>As it did so, a strange sensation spread through Luo Zheng's hands.</p>

  <p>At this moment, it was as if the sword embryo had lost its weight as well.</p>

  <p>With a gentle lift of the pair of pincers, the sword embryo lifted like it was a feather. Luo Luo Zheng quickly pulled it out of the furnace.</p>

  <p>The sword embryo, glinting with rainbow-colored light, had not been refined. It had a coarse surface and looked nothing special. It was no doubt that the sword embryo could be processed and forged into a peerless divine weapon.</p>
