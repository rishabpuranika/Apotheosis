<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1664 Defensive Stance (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Norvin had now lost two battles.</p>

  <p>At this moment, he had become exceptionally cautious.</p>

  <p>He didn't know the full depths of Zheng's strength; however, he had already lost both battles in just one move, which had extinguished much of his previously cocky fighting spirit.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Norvin was no longer hoping for success.</p>

  <p>Of course, if he could win against Zheng, that would be wonderful. But knowing that he might lose again, he could only hope that he wouldn't lose in a single move again, like he had in the previous two confrontations.</p>

  <p>So, the instant that he stepped onto the Heaven Earth Board again, he brought out his supreme divine weapon, that huge drum.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>The moment that he unleashed the mighty drum, it began to emit rhythmic sounds.</p>

  <p>The sounds of the reverberating drum were not created by Norvin hitting the drum, but they were the sounds of the beating heart inside the drum.</p>

  <p>As the sounds of the drum echoed forth, Norvin also let out a full-throated cry.</p>

  <p>The protective life vitality which wrapped Norvin's body also fluctuated in accordance to a pre-determined rhythm, and it transformed into a layer of black scales that formed a shining armor, superimposed over his body.</p>

  <p>"Magic Glowing Protection!"</p>

  <p>This move would strengthen Norvin's defenses to the maximum.</p>

  <p>An ogre's body was already incomparably strong. After the Magic Glowing Protection was applied, the degree of his body's brutality was now equal to that of those thick-skinned legendary beasts which were feared by most warriors. He would now be exceptionally difficult to beat.</p>

  <p>But even this was not enough!</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>Immediately following this, there was an urgent staccato of drumming.</p>

  <p>"Magic Glowing Wind!"</p>

  <p>With this, Numerous, formless gales surrounded him, creating a living tornado. This was the fastest way to increase his speed.</p>

  <p>While Norvin was busy releasing these two skills, Zheng calmly floated down from the black stone.</p>

  <p>This was the first time that Zheng had battled in this stage of the Illusion Battlefield, and he was very curious about the Heaven Earth Board beneath his feet.</p>

  <p>A strangely vigorous look appeared in Zheng's eyes the moment he set his feet on the board.</p>

  <p>It was unclear what the Heaven Earth Board was made of, but it emanated a feeling of being connected to the earth.</p>

  <p>It felt as if the mysterious girl had turned the three hundred of them into living stones, and she was playing a game of Go against herself.</p>

  <p>The Heaven Earth Board was an imitation of their universe.</p>

  <p>Could it be that the universe evolved according to the outcomes of battles on this Heaven Earth Board?</p>

  <p>Zheng's conjecture was indeed accurate.</p>

  <p>In truth, the Supreme Lords who were scattered all across the universe were also closely watching these warriors and the battles occurring on the Heaven Earth Board.</p>

  <p>Of course, they paid attention to their own descendants and the ace talents from their own forces. But they were more concerned about the battles between the variables and determinants.</p>

  <p>This Go game was predicative to events in the world of chaos.</p>

  <p>The mysterious girl used these battles as a means to make calculations.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords also viewed this as a chance to make their own calculations. If they could pierce the veil of the secrets of the heavens, they could discern some variables within their clan, and they might be able to turn the tide and even seize the chance to greatly improve themselves.</p>

  <p>Now, as an ogre ace talent, Norvin had continuously fought many times already. Moreover, from the very beginning, he had inexplicably provoked the human warriors. Perhaps, this was fate at work.</p>

  <p>The ogre race and the human race had never walked the same path, but Norvin was not brainless. Continuously provoking the humans in the Illusion Battlefield would definitely arouse the wrath of the masses, and Norvin's strength was definitely not invincible. If he continued on this path, it would not end well for him. Did he know about this?</p>

  <p>There was definitely something strange afoot, and there was something fishy going on here.</p>

  <p>It was an easy matter to calculate one single person's fate, but much more difficult to calculate the combined fates of a group of people.</p>

  <p>The complications of these calculations for all living things in the universe were unimaginable.</p>

  <p>It might have presented a precise calculation, but even a tiny mistake could bring about a series of unexpected deviations.</p>

  <p>Many Supreme Lords seized this opportunity to come up with calculations as they observed the battles. And so they tried to make predictions not only for themselves, but also for their own races.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Mathias, an ogre Supreme Lord, was also watching the battles and making his calculations. Even if his own race's ace talent had been defeated again and again in one move, he was still focused on deducing the implications within this. Although he had not reached a conclusion yet, he had a faintly dire premonition that this did not bode well for the ogre race.</p>

  <p>He tried to make the calculations carefully and find countermeasures to deal with the unseen crisis lurking in the world of chaos.</p>

  <p>Zheng stood where he was and judged the situation for a while before walking towards Norvin, who had taken enough time to prepare.</p>

  <p>Apparently, Zheng was very confident in himself.</p>

  <p>"Zheng is going to attack his opponent," Tianming murmured. Fondly touching the long sword strapped to his back, he had a faint smile on his handsome face.</p>

  <p>'Has the gap between us narrowed or widened? Can I win against him?</p>

  <p>Can I beat him?' he pondered and hoped that there would be a chance for him to engage Zheng in combat later. He was eager to find out what a fight between Zheng and him would be like after so many years.</p>

  <p>He wasn't in a hurry, though. As long as he could win his battles in the meantime, sooner or later he would have a chance to duel with Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, all the best!" Margaret shouted. After she shouted this encouragement, her long eyelashes blinked twice, and she then changed her form of address. "Honey! You can do it!"</p>
