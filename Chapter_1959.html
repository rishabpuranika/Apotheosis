<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Zheng's Mu Ning rose to the sky. He didn't cultivate the Great Dominance Technique, but the power of his soul that erupted then was no less than Maha's. The two auras clashed, even though the two were still far apart.</p>

  <p>"Maha, you are from the fake Sacred race. You don't have a noble bloodline. How dare you make me surrender to you? Ha-ha! That's ridiculous. Maha, who do you think you are?"</p>

  <p>As he spoke, Luo Zheng also activated his Roaring Token. As a result, the whole universe heard his insults towards Maha.</p>

  <p>After she was exposed to Zheng's Mu Ning, Connie in Maha's arms suddenly felt tightness in her chest and shortness of breath. Her mind grew disoriented while her face turned pale. The expression on her face showed how badly she was affected by Zheng's Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>'I can't believe this! His soul is no weaker than Maha's. How's that possible? What is he?!' she thought.</p>

  <p>At this moment, even Maha and the two Supreme Lords of the Sacred race behind him found it hard to believe. Their eyes gawked with surprise and wariness against Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Gold Fighting Soul! Emperor Soul Imprint! You..." Maha was at a loss for words. The expression on his face had grown even bitter.</p>

  <p>"Hahaha!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng laughed out loud. Under the influence of the Emperor Soul Imprint, his heart was also filled with great heroism, which was completely different from his usual introverted temperament. In a big and brave voice, he said, "There are 130 people who have obtained the complete Emperor Soul Imprint in the Divine Soul Ancestral Land of the Soul Seal race! You, Maha, the number one Godly Genius in the Sacred race, is only ranked 80th among the 130 people. You didn't even achieve the average rank! But I, Luo Zheng, is ranked the first. Do you know your Sacred race is a fake one? You are nothing but a fraud. Even if you were from the real Sacred race, you wouldn't be able to make me surrender. The Mu Ning you possess is incomparable to mine! You are not qualified!"</p>

  <p>"You are not qualified..."</p>

  <p>"You are not qualified..."</p>

  <p>Zheng's voice reverberated through the whole universe. Everyone heard how he mocked Maha in such a brave voice.</p>

  <p>At that moment, all warriors of the Sacred race had a sullen face. Their confusion was accompanied with grim expressions.</p>

  <p>From the moment they invaded this universe, they had proclaimed that they were the descendants of the Sacred race. They established that they were the purest, the oldest and the most perfect race in the divine land.</p>

  <p>All the other creatures were supposed to be beneath them.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng proclaimed that their Sacred race was fake. And this was true. The real Sacred race was already extinct. Moreover, the Sacred race they were from was only created by Murphy. This was the most intolerable part for the warriors of the fake Sacred race. In their eyes, Luo Zheng belittled and ridiculed the glory of their Sacred race.</p>

  <p>Additionally, the warriors became even more shocked with Maha's ranking in the Divine Soul Ancestral Land. Bewilderment enveloped the warriors as they tried to comprehend Zheng's words.</p>

  <p>Maha was the number one Godly Genius in the Sacred race. However, Luo Zheng said that Maha was only ranked 80th in the Divine Soul Ancestral Land.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng even proclaimed himself as ranked number one!</p>

  <p>Disbelief and confusion devoured the warriors' minds. They couldn't accept such an absurd truth.</p>

  <p>The Mu Ning of Luo Zheng was unable to impact Maha at all. After all, he also had the Emperor Soul Imprint. Moreover, Maha cultivated the Great Dominance Technique. His control over the Mu Ning was more skilled and powerful than that of Luo Zheng. If Maha maintained a calm mind, Zheng's Mu Ning would also be ineffective against him.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng's words struck a nerve and angered Maha.</p>

  <p>How could Luo Zheng be ranked number one in the Divine Soul Ancestral Land? What a ridiculous thought!</p>

  <p>Maha refused to believe Zheng's crazy proclamations.</p>

  <p>The Divine Soul Ancestral Land gathered the top talents from all of the universes. The peerless geniuses from the divine land were also invited there. Maha could accept to be listed in the top 80 since it was quite a good result. However, how could Luo Zheng get the first place? Such a result was outrageous and impossible!</p>

  <p>"You bastard… You are lying! How could that be possible? You don't even have any proof!" Maha retorted as he clenched his fists. Rage flowed through his murderous expression.</p>

  <p>But at that moment, Maha forgot something. They were bickering with each other, and proof would be useless against each other.</p>

  <p>The two warriors were in a fight of provocations and temperament. The one with a smarter mouth would win while the one who got distracted would suffer a shameful defeat. However, Maha still wanted Luo Zheng to provide proof. It was a laughable claim.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng still held the token of mountain in his hand. If Maha were to make a move, he would activate the token and hide in the fairy palace. After all, he was alone, while Maha had two Supreme Lords behind him. Maha himself was also a mighty warrior and more than a match for Luo Zheng. A strategic retreat for Luo Zheng at that situation would not be shameful for him.</p>

  <p>Before he left, Luo Zheng wanted to shake the morale of Maha and the Sacred race.</p>

  <p>"You want proof? Okay? You are ranked the 80th. The guy who is ranked 79th is named Faust Lu. The guy who is ranked 81st is called Lacy Zuo. Do you still remember them? Your power is only around the level of those two. I'm ranked first and most powerful. Tianming is ranked 3rd while Nathan is 15th. When the three of us entered the list, your ranking immediately dropped to 83rd. What a pity! A weakling like you might fall out of the list soon," Luo Zheng said with a laugh. Mockery was explicit in his tone.</p>

  <p>Actually, there were only a few creatures who could obtain the Emperor Soul Imprint in the Divine Soul Ancestral Land. After all these years, only a hundred or so creatures had successfully done so. It was hard to make Maha fall out of the list. His cultivation was still powerful enough to call him a worthy warrior.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng's goal was to shake the morale of Maha and the Sacred race. He exaggerated his claims to make them depressed.</p>
