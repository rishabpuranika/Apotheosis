<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Yan Clan's decline had something to do with the Zhao Clan.</p>

  <p>The master of the Zhao Clan knew full well.</p>

  <p>If Zheng looked any further into it, it would probably only cause more trouble.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Trish was just his maid, and he said he didn't want to get involved in this.</p>

  <p>When the master of the Zhao Clan finally calmed himself down, he heard Lachlan scream, "Father! Some pills for my wounds! It really hurts! Who is that guy? Is he the son of the head of the Oneness Sky Palace? Father, why were you so respectful towards him?"</p>

  <p>Lachlan lay on the ground in pain.</p>

  <p>He knew he had offended someone he shouldn't have; his father was just putting on a show and trying to prove a point.</p>

  <p>His arms and legs being broken was no big deal. The pills of the Zhao Clan would heal him up in an instant.</p>

  <p>But his father still refused him the pills, and only continued to drive his foot into him again and again.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>The kicks almost killed him. His father yelled furiously, "You bastard! You almost got us all killed! You want the pills? Forget it! You will stay on the ground this year! If anyone dares to heal you, I'll break their arms and legs as well!"</p>

  <p>The master of the Zhao Clan left with his people in tow.</p>

  <p>Trish's stepmother was trembling in a corner. Until now, she still didn't understand what had happened, but she vaguely knew that Trish's master was a somebody, and that 'somebody' had made a statement that the Zhao Clan could no longer make life hard for the Yan Clan.</p>

  <p>On the flying ship, Zheng sat upright at the front end.</p>

  <p>Trish contemplated a while before finding the courage to walk up to Zheng.</p>

  <p>She walked up silently and unassumingly, and bowed to him.</p>

  <p>"There's no need to be so courteous," Zheng said with a friendly smile.</p>

  <p>"I'm just your maid, yet you care so much for me," Trish said meekly.</p>

  <p>The fate of the Yan Clan had always been controlled by the Zhao Clan.</p>

  <p>If things went on like this, 'Yan' would be removed from the city name sooner or later, and the city would be renamed the Zhao City.</p>

  <p>But Zheng's warning was surely enough to scare off the master of the Zhao Clan.</p>

  <p>"It's no big deal. Don't think on it too much," Zheng said, smiling tenderly.</p>

  <p>Trish smiled too. She paused a moment before she spoke again, "There's one more thing. The master of the Zhao Clan is a powerful and influential man. Why is he so afraid of you?"</p>

  <p>Even if Zheng was an outstanding disciple of the Flow Sword Sect, he was still not strong enough to intimidate a clan living by the Clear Lake.</p>

  <p>"It's because today, Flag Master killed Marco, as well as his strong followers," Gant explained with a wry smile.</p>

  <p>Trish's eyes widened.</p>

  <p>"Are you afraid? If you are afraid, you're free to leave," Gant said, toying with her still.</p>

  <p>Offending the direct line of the Oneness Sky Palace would bring quite serious trouble to whoever dared do such a thing. Zheng, however, didn't just offend them. He killed one of them!</p>

  <p>Noticing Trish's shock and stillness, Gant continued to threaten her playfully, "There's probably going to be something disastrous waiting for us when we return to the Oneness Sky Palace. And I'm afraid those of us who work for Flag Master Zheng are likely to be put under fire too."</p>

  <p>After a moment of panic, Trish managed to compose herself. She stood up straight, tightened her jaw and said, "I'm not afraid of anything. At the worst, I will die with Mr. Luo!"</p>

  <p>Seeing she was taking Gant's words seriously, Zheng smiled and said, "Don't listen to Gant. I know what I'm doing."</p>

  <p>Truthfully, he wasn't too sure what he was doing.</p>

  <p>In his current position, he really couldn't afford to offend the Vastness Mountain.</p>

  <p>All depended on Marco's status in the Xu Clan on the Vastness Mountain. If Marco really was very important, it was possible that even Athemar would not be able to simmer the anger of the Vastness Mountain.</p>

  <p>But Zheng had an important bargaining chip, and that was the Truth Enlightenment of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent.</p>

  <p>He firmly believed that the Truth Enlightenment could solve all problems.</p>

  <p>Half a day later, the three stepped into the transmission array.</p>

  <p>It was already early morning when they returned to Dragon City.</p>

  <p>The dark starry sky began to fade and brighten.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't go directly up the mountain but instead left the Dragon City with Gant and Trish.</p>

  <p>Monica had completely adapted to her role.</p>

  <p>Amongst the Alliance Chiefs, she was the weakest, but none of them dared to disobey or ignore her.</p>

  <p>Zheng gave her enough divine crystals to keep the operation of her alliance running.</p>

  <p>She had more and more Flag Masters join her and more than ten thousand people at her command, making her alliance the largest outside the Dragon City.</p>

  <p>When Zheng arrived, Monica appeared pleasantly surprised and noticeably uneasy at the same time.</p>

  <p>The disciples from the Sword Light Palace, including Beldene, Elgin and Kenelm, had also come when they heard the news. It had been a long time since they had seen Zheng last time.</p>

  <p>"Zheng... Alliance Chief... Flag Master..." Kenelm stammered as he ran over.</p>

  <p>He had called him all these things at one point or another. Now that Zheng had gone up the mountain, he didn't know what to call him.</p>

  <p>"Just call him Flag Master!"</p>

  <p>"Right. He will always be our Flag Master."</p>

  <p>"…"</p>

  <p>Jago and the others giggled casually.</p>

  <p>Zheng glanced around and asked curiously, "Why don't I see Nelly, Xun and Liusu?"</p>

  <p>Monica appeared distressed by hearing their names. She spoke solemnly to Zheng, "I have something to tell you. A few days ago, I asked someone to go to the mountain to look for you, but you weren't there."</p>

  <p>"What happened? Where are they?" Zheng asked, his concern growing with every word.</p>

  <p>Zheng had won first place in the Seven Mountains Meeting and offended many people. No one had come after him as blatantly as Marco. Perhaps they would use some dirty tricks to get back at him.</p>

  <p>If anyone hurt his family...</p>

  <p>At the thought of this, Zheng's face darkened.</p>

  <p>"They have gone up the mountain," Monica said. "Elder Sellers from the Dragon City said the Oneness Sky Palace had sent out an invitation. They said that the three of them had outstanding talent and they wanted to meet them."</p>

  <p>"I know them. They would not agree to something like that," Zheng said affirmatively.</p>

  <p>Liusu and Xun would definitely ask for Zheng's opinion if they wanted to join a sword sect on the mountain.</p>

  <p>They wouldn't go up the mountain without telling him.</p>

  <p>"You're right. They didn't agree, but someone from the mountain took them away. Someone forced them. I'm sorry..." Monica said full of remorse.</p>

  <p>Zheng trusted Monica and felt safe leaving his three wives with her. Her heart was filled with great sorrow and guilt as she had failed him. The last few days had been hell for her trying to figure out how she would break it to him.</p>

  <p>"Don't blame yourself. It's not your fault," Zheng comforted Monica.</p>

  <p>No matter how strong Monica was, she was only an Alliance Chief of the Dragon City. The people on the mountain didn't even take the Oneness Guards seriously. It was simply impossible for Monica to have stopped them.</p>

  <p>After staying outside the Dragon City for a while, Zheng ordered Trish to go up the mountain by herself. Then, he went into the Dragon City and headed straight to the Sword Tower.</p>

  <p>Now that Sellers was involved, he seemed to know exactly what was going on.</p>
