<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4231 The Energy Ball </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Evil God remained calm.</p>

  <p>Once again, he waved his left hand. The fourth flame rose slowly from his palm.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, the Grandmaster of Heaven appeared even more shocked.</p>

  <p>'I heard that the Evil God was able to cultivate the three thousand Divine Dao. Furthermore, he managed to integrate them. But how did he get his hands on the bloodline powers? Did he get them through the three thousand Divine Dao?</p>

  <p>That would be impossible!' the Grandmaster of Heaven thought to himself as he stared at the flame.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, something incredible happened.</p>

  <p>The fourth flame had instantly merged with the mixture of the other three flames.</p>

  <p>Soon after, the Evil God manifested a faint purple bloodline power. This power was from the life quadrant. Without any sign of hesitation, he combined this with the mixture of the four flames.</p>

  <p>"That's it? Is that the magic you wanted to show me?" Duran was already getting impatient.</p>

  <p>The Evil God's performance of blending the bloodlines meant nothing to him. He actually found it quite boring.</p>

  <p>"Be patient and watch," replied the Evil God with a confident smile.</p>

  <p>Out of nowhere, they heard a swishing sound. Phew! They heard it one after another.</p>

  <p>The Evil God snapped his fingers several times. Each time, more bloodline powers kept appearing. They immediately merged with the mixture of those he had shown before.</p>

  <p>Duran was utterly bewildered when he saw so many different kinds of blood powers.</p>

  <p>He pondered upon this. 'The Evil God is incredible! How was he able to obtain that many kinds of bloodline powers?'</p>

  <p>He blended about thirty bloodline powers. Afterward, it formed a black and red ball. It began to expand for a second and then shrunk the next. It was like a human's heart beating madly. It seemed like it might explode at any point in time.</p>

  <p>Shera and the Grandmaster of Heaven were very apprehensive about the energy contained inside the ball.</p>

  <p>If the ball exploded, it wouldn't kill the Evil God and Duran. After all, the Evil God had infinite avatars and Duran was a Treacherous Being. On the other hand, Shera and the Grandmaster of Heaven wouldn't be able to survive the explosion.</p>

  <p>"What on earth is this?" Duran asked with furrowed brows.</p>

  <p>In fact, he didn't understand why the Evil God would show this to him.</p>

  <p>Based from his observation, it was not that easy for the Evil God to blend the energies.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the power of the destruction quadrant was extremely unstable.</p>

  <p>He wondered what the purpose of the Evil God was for doing this.</p>

  <p>The black and red ball sprang from the Evil God's hand and traveled for a distance. At that moment, he stretched out his hand and made a cubic space to envelope the ball.</p>

  <p>The cubic space was stable because it contained the truth energy. Even masters at the Grandmaster of Heaven's level would have a hard time breaking it.</p>

  <p>With a wave of his hand, the Evil God made another cubic space and covered the ball. He proceeded to make more spaces to fully wrap the ball.</p>

  <p>Each cubic space was an inch larger than the previous one. The Evil God didn't stop until he acquired fifty layers of it.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Duran, the Grandmaster of Heaven, and Shera remained silent. All they could do was watch.</p>

  <p>They decided to wait patiently and see what the Evil God was up to. They were compelled to do so by their curiosity and the fact that they didn't have any choice.</p>

  <p>Afterward, the Evil God pointed at the ball inside the cubic spaces.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, he shouted, "Explode!"</p>

  <p>Sizzle! Boom!</p>

  <p>A loud booming sound reached their ears.</p>

  <p>The black and red ball exploded within the cubic spaces. Raging fire filled the insides.</p>

  <p id="top_25">The upper layer was engulfed in light green flames. Meanwhile, the lower layer was a swirling vortex. The two forces eroded each other.</p>

  <p>"That was incredible!" Shera exclaimed. Her eyes lit up with amazement.</p>

  <p>The flames were trapped within the fifty cubic spaces. Therefore, she was not afraid of getting hurt anymore.</p>

  <p>The flames continued to move down. Finally, the first layer of cubic space couldn't withstand them any longer. They heard a muffled sound. After that, the first layer of cubic space disappeared into thin air. It was immediately followed by the second, third, and fourth layers.</p>

  <p>Simply put, the cubic spaces were now collapsing.</p>

  <p>As they did, the flames became more violent.</p>

  <p>"Evil God, over twenty cubic spaces have been broken," reminded the Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>However, the Evil God remained composed and calm as he stared at the flames. "Focus on the fire." He gestured at the Grandmaster of Heaven to remain silent.</p>

  <p>In a mere couple seconds, more than twenty spaces vanished.</p>

  <p>If it continued at this rate, the fire would be able to break all of the cubic spaces soon.</p>

  <p>The power of space emerged from Shera. As soon as the fire broke free, she would immediately escape.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Grandmaster of Heaven didn't do that. He thought that it would be embarrassing. He was at the Eternal Realm. If he acted like Shera, it would mean that he was a coward. Hence, he pretended to be calm even though he felt really anxious.</p>

  <p>When there were only two cubic spaces left, the flames stopped spreading.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, they began to vanish.</p>

  <p>After the flames disappeared, they left a black and red item inside the cubic spaces. It looked like an ore.</p>

  <p>"What is that? Is it an ore?" Duran's curiosity was aroused.</p>

  <p>All the Bird Masters were incredibly sensitive. He had a feeling that it was not a common ore.</p>

  <p>The Evil God put his hand into the square spaces. He carefully took out the black and red ore. At the same time, he spoke, "This thing is very powerful. I will show you what it can do."</p>

  <p>The Evil God threw the ore into the distance. As it rotated in the air, he released a streak of lightning.</p>

  <p>The lightning struck the ore.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the ore exploded and turned into an energy ball. Its diameter was hundreds of feet long.</p>

  <p>"Unbelievable! This, this is..." The Grandmaster of Heaven's eyes almost popped out as he saw the energy ball. Disbelief and astonishment were written all over his face.</p>

  <p>Even though Duran remained silent, he was obviously shaken up by what he just witnessed. He realized that the energy ball released by the Evil God was similar to those that the downgrader had shown.</p>

  <p>"What is the matter, sir?" Shera asked the Grandmaster of Heaven confusedly.</p>

  <p>"That energy ball is exactly the same as those that obliterated the entire Three Purities Stage," replied the Grandmaster of Heaven. His eyes were fixed at the area where it exploded.</p>

  <p>Shera's eyes widened in shock. She felt the power of this energy ball. Yet, she found it hard to believe that it could reduce the entire Three Purities Stage into ruins.</p>

  <p>"I understand now! This is the power of the fifth-grade world! It's from the Deep Space!" Duran made an eye-opening realization. He fixed his eyes upon the Evil God and asked excitedly, "How... How did you make it? How were you able to get that power?"</p>

  <p>The Evil God smiled confidently. "I think you should ask me how I acquired the bloodline powers first."</p>

  <p>"Fine, how did you get them then?" Duran inquired immediately. He couldn't keep the excitement from his voice.</p>

  <p>The Evil God tilted his head and raised one hand above his shoulder. "The Ways-blending Energy is the origin of all the energies in the chaos," he replied calmly.</p>

  <p>As he said that, the colorful Ways-blending Energy grew bigger in the Evil God's hand.</p>

  <p>"Even the six truth powers are born from the Ways-blending Energy.</p>

  <p>Thus, the Ways-blending Energy is the foundation of all materials. To sum it up, the Ways-blending Energy and the bloodline powers in the main world are the same thing. Therefore, the two things can change into one another," continued the Evil God.</p>

  <p>"What? That can't be right!"</p>

  <p>Duran shook his head as he retorted determinedly.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, the people of the Bold Conjecture House had long come up with the theory that the Evil God just told him.</p>

  <p>However, the Bird Masters were not interested in these theoretical things back then. Therefore, Duran didn't hear about this theory. When he heard what the Evil God said, he thought he was merely talking nonsense.</p>

  <p>Duran might believe it if he heard it directly from the intelligent scholars of the Bold Conjecture House.</p>

  <p>The members of the Bold Conjecture House worked out lots of theories and did lots of experiments. Unfortunately, no one was able to prove those theories back then.</p>

  <p>The Evil God smiled ambiguously. He put his palm down so that it faced the ground. The Divine Dao energy came out through his fingers. In the blink of an eye, hundreds of kinds of Divine Dao energy appeared. It was quite easy for the Evil God to do that.</p>

  <p>"Watch this first then tell me later what you think," answered the Evil God mysteriously.</p>
