<br/><br/>

  

  <p>The condensation of one's own Godly Tile was a very complicated process.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the situation would be completely different from each martial artist. The difficulty would be based on their own comprehension of the Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's talent was not inferior to Tianming's. However, Tianming was still able to condense his Godly Tile before Luo Luo Zheng. The reason for such fast development had something to do with the composition of Tianming's inner world.</p>

  <p>Tianming's inner world was completely condensed with life vitality. After his sea of life vitality was formed, it turned into ordinary seawater. Every day the seawater evaporated and gathered in the clouds in the sky. As such, a complete life vitality cycle was formed in his inner world. The design was simply ingenious!.</p>

  <p>In fact, the cycle was a "purification" process.</p>

  <p>Ten Godly Geniuses had received a Godly Plate from Irene. To this day, the Godly Plates had remained fixed within their inner worlds.</p>

  <p>As the life vitality got constantly purified, it transformed into pure, white clouds. The clouds contained one's comprehension of the Godly Way.</p>

  <p>Additionally, the clouds would be continuously filtered through the Godly Plate. A Godly Tile would then be slowly formed in the Godly Plate?</p>

  <p>However, there was no such process within Luo Zheng's inner world. His inner world was completely different from Tianming's and the others'.</p>

  <p>Without that particular process, it became very difficult for Luo Luo Zheng to condense his Godly Tile. He tried to activate the power of chaotic energy. Additionally, he combined it with his comprehension of the Emotion Closing Godly Way. He wanted to inject the chaotic energy into the Godly Plate, but after countless experiments, there was no significant effect. There was still no Godly Tile formed in his Godly Plate.</p>

  <p>Back then, Mike had already followed Luo Luo Zheng into his inner world. With a single glance, Mike had already found the problem. However, his father did not give Luo Luo Zheng a perfect solution. After all, the Primal Chaos Technique was not complete. It was still enigmatic and had some problems. Even Bromley could not do anything about it if he had been there.</p>

  <p>At that time, Mike suggested that Luo Luo Zheng turn the chaotic energy into other things, or specifically, turn it into pure clouds. The conversion would probably help Luo Luo Zheng in his comprehension. Luo Luo Zheng had tried his best to convert his chaotic energy, but he failed in the end?</p>

  <p>Therefore, in the period before he left the Evolutionary Universe, Luo Luo Zheng himself was also very confused. Without enough knowledge about the chaotic energy inside him, he was left dumbfounded. He was unable to figure out a way to master his Godly Way. To make matters worse, the methods that others used were also not suitable for him.</p>

  <p>However, after he practiced the Primal Chaos Technique up to his current stage, Luo Luo Zheng knew that he no longer had a way back. Regardless of whether that path would lead him to success or failure, it would be impossible for him to go back and cultivate life vitality.</p>

  <p>Up until that moment, Luo Luo Zheng had vaguely come to a conclusion. It seemed that an extremely important link was absent in his cultivation of the Primal Chaos Technique. If he could figure out what it was, he might be able to achieve a higher level.</p>

  <p>Even though Bromley was a Holy Being, he was still an ordinary creature and a member of the divine land. As such, Bromley still had some impediments in his cultivation and knowledge. Although the Primal Chaos Technique was a martial art created by him on a whim, Bromley could not escape the limitations of being an ordinary creature.</p>

  <p>For example, the Evil God in the inner world of Luo Zheng's body did indeed possess extraordinary talent. Even Luo Luo Zheng was amazed at the things he had done and some of his brilliant ideas. If that person was born in the divine land, he would likely be an extremely extraordinary warrior. But because he was born in Luo Zheng's inner world, his perception and knowledge were limited. Sadly, one's origin could affect their limitations and possibly their abilities.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the flaw of the Primal Chaos Technique was not Bromley's fault. As Bromley was a mere ordinary creature, his knowledge of the chaos was incomplete. As such, the Primal Chaos Technique was also incomplete. Therefore, when Bromley passed the Primal Chaos Technique to Luo Luo Zheng, it was already a huge risk in the first place!</p>

  <p>The grayish-brown clouds slowly formed and imprinted themselves onto Luo Zheng's pupils. An expectant expression was seen in Luo Zheng's face. Hope could be seen on the horizon. It was because Luo Luo Zheng saw that the clouds seemed to have a soul as they floated eastward. That was where the Godly Plate was!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes suddenly flashed as a golden light appeared. His comprehension of the Emotion Closing Godly Way constantly revolved in his mind.</p>

  <p>At the same time, from the brown clouds, faint sword shadows could be seen. As those sword shadows flew around, they emitted a sharp Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>Sound of the metals clashed against each other reverberated through his inner world.</p>

  <p>"Sword clouds, condense!"</p>

  <p>With expectant eyes, Luo Luo Zheng had condensed all of his insights about the Emotion Closing Godly Way into those clouds. Afterward, the brown-colored clouds had turned into a cluster of sword clouds!</p>

  <p>"This momentum! What's happening?!"</p>

  <p>The Evil God looked at the "clouds" in the sky with eyes filled with shock. A small gap could be seen in his mouth as his mind was filled with confusion.</p>

  <p>Although the Evil God had lost to Luo Luo Zheng before, the power Luo Luo Zheng used was the power that governed this inner world. As such, the Evil God could not resist the power. That was the Creator's privilege. Luo Zheng's power would irresistibly affect those inside his inner world.</p>

  <p>However, the Evil God had never seen Luo Zheng's true strength.</p>

  <p>Now that the Evil God had seen Luo Zheng's comprehension of the Emotion Closing Godly Way, his heart was stirred. A strong emotion had swirled deep inside the Evil God.</p>

  <p>The sword clouds floated rapidly in the air. Finally, they reached the side of the Godly Plate. With great precision, they moved towards the Godly Plate and gathered around it?</p>
