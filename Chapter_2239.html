<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2239 Forced To Kill (Part Two) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Now, a murderous intent formed in his mind. His entire being filled with fury as he saw his fiancee being attracted to another man. Deliberately, he walked towards Zheng, with a cold smile on his face, and said, "I've seen a lot of people who look tough in the outside, but actually turn out to be cowards! Do you want to exchange your life with his? Do you dare?"</p>

  <p>"Lang?" someone shouted. The crowd stirred, shocked.</p>

  <p>"That guy is a little crazy. You'd better..." someone warned.</p>

  <p>"Don't provoke him. Just let the matter go, okay?" yelled another voice.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing Zheng being so serious, the crowd didn't want to provoke him to do something stupid. Seeing Langston make his move made them uneasy.</p>

  <p>They didn't expect Langston's reaction either. Instead of backing down, he walked slowly and deliberately towards Zheng and pointed at him.</p>

  <p>"Humph!" he said, addressing the crowd. "This kind of person probably had a hard time climbing up from the bottom of society. I'm pretty sure he won't have the guts to push through with this and risk losing everything." As he spoke, his eyes followed the changes in Zheng's expression.</p>

  <p>Of course, Langston didn't care a smidge about Sheridan's safety. He only wanted Zheng to die and at least be humiliated.</p>

  <p>If Zheng dared kill Sheridan, he was doomed. Everyone knew that. Even if Langston himself didn't kill him, the Xie Clan would never let him go. If Zheng managed to solve the problem by words and threats alone without spilling any blood, things would be a lot less complicated. That was exactly what Langston wanted to do.</p>

  <p>As Langston kept moving forward, Zheng saw through his mind. He sneered, "Some people are so arrogant that they think they can read other people's minds." As he spoke, Zheng stumbled forward slightly, his feet unstable on the uneven surface and the squirming Sheridan.</p>

  <p>Langston took that as a sign to make a move. He rushed towards Zheng at a lightning speed, shouting, "How dare you!"</p>

  <p>The rest of the crowd looked at Zheng in disbelief. In their eyes, it seemed as though Sheridan had been hit with an enormous, invisible blunt object. The skin all over his body seemed to be stretched taut, and bleeding cracks began to appear.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>Sheridan appeared to have been crushed by a powerful force from head to toe. His body collapsed, almost flattening against the floor, as if he had turned into a piece of paper. A huge amount of blood splashed around his collapsed body, spreading out like the petals of some grotesque flower.</p>

  <p>"Ahhhh!" he shouted in enormous pain. The entire crowd gasped in horror.</p>

  <p>Aleyna and Kelsey covered their mouths at the same time. They were trying not to scream. Staring blankly at the blood stains on the floor, Liusu bit her lips sharply as her face turned deathly pale. Langston had provoked Zheng to kill Sheridan. She realized that had been his ultimate goal. He wanted to send Zheng to his own death.</p>

  <p>Langston turned to address the crowd once again, triumphant. His plan had worked. "What a cruel man! You all saw what he just did, every one of you! Let me kill him now! If we spare him, he will surely become an evil warrior and destroy us in the future. He must be killed, for the good of us and our clans!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes still exuded murderous intent. At the same time, something inside him seemed to shift. A ray of golden light began to flicker on the surface of his soul.</p>

  <p>However, the golden light flickered and died.</p>

  <p>He knew that if he were to use his Emotion Closing Godly Way, he would definitely fight to the death with his enemies. He might have the tiniest chance of winning, but he would still have to suffer after this fight. Was he going to use such a forbidden Godly Way in front of so many warriors who all had powerful backgrounds?</p>

  <p>Zheng had been very restrained from the beginning. He had been careful not to displease the group of disciples from the wealthy clans on the Floating Islands. There had been too many responsibilities on his shoulders, and that had made his resolve occasionally waiver after he entered the Divine Land. Moreover, since the moment he entered the Floating Island of the Han Clan, he had been making doubly sure to not act as arrogantly and practice the utmost restraint.</p>

  <p>But sometimes, situations can get out of control no matter how hard one tries to maintain it.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>As soon as he had crushed Sheridan with his feet, Zheng moved backwards.</p>

  <p>As he retreated, he pulled out his Great Weighty Sword. Without looking, he swung his sword left and right at everything and anything coming at him.</p>

  <p>On the list of the Arena of Legends, Langston ranked fifth among all the mid-rank True Gods of the divine land.</p>

  <p>Master Evil was a top-level warrior among the mid-rank True Gods. But compared to Langston, Master Evil was far inferior in skills and capabilities.</p>

  <p>The Arena of Legends wasn't the ultimate test of ability. Outside the Time Sea, Langston could easily overpower and even kill some of the top-rank True Gods from the second tier clans.</p>

  <p>Zheng was unable to resist such a strong enemy.</p>

  <p>He didn't use the Emotion Closing Godly Way, but a considerable amount of strength source was poured into the sword strike.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>With a blast of wind, Zheng's sword didn't land on his enemy, but swayed off course and cut through the empty air.</p>

  <p>Langston's speed was beyond Zheng's imagination.</p>
