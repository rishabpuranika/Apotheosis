<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2629 The Erasing Water </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>No one had ever charted out the entirety of this world's expanse.</p>

  <p>The prison in which they were incarcerated only took up a very small area at the bottom of the chaos.</p>

  <p>The exiles only needed to pass through the serrated area and they would be able to leave this world.</p>

  <p>A number of exiles had already tried this, including Emily and Timotheus.</p>

  <p>Considering their strength, it would have been an easy task for them to make it through the serrated area, as the prison didn't actually use real walls to keep them inside. What really stopped one from leaving was the Curse Chain.</p>

  <p>So far, no one had been able to break free from the Curse Chain yet. The chain would have pulled them back immediately even if they thought they had been successful in escaping from this world.</p>

  <p>The exiles knew that Luther was the only one that had the ability to destroy the Curse Chain. They looked to him for guidance in getting out of this world.</p>

  <p>As she gazed upon the serrated area, Emily asked curiously, "Is the Warden race's lair not located in this world?"</p>

  <p>Luther only looked ahead and nodded in response. He drew a circle in the air as he extended his hand.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, they saw a unique scene appear inside the circle.</p>

  <p>The Curse Chains binding hundreds of thousands of people were entangled with each other in a great mass that extended beyond the serrated area into the darkness.</p>

  <p>The chains made a tortuous path that twisted and turned.</p>

  <p>"Can we find the lair of the Warden race along that path?" When Emily saw the path clearly, she raised her eyebrows slightly.</p>

  <p>The other exiles expectantly directed their gazes towards Luther.</p>

  <p>In turn, Luther looked towards Zelda.</p>

  <p>Actually, he still hadn't reached a deeper understanding of his own race's secrets. His sister was the one he depended on for this type of matter.</p>

  <p>Zelda nodded in acknowledgment and confirmed, "Yes, we can find them by following this path, but I think they've been well-prepared."</p>

  <p>"We've been well-prepared, too," Emily sneered.</p>

  <p>Almost all of the exiles had cold smiles on their faces, and several of them even clenched their fists in their intense desire to finally get their revenge on the Warden race.</p>

  <p>After being imprisoned for eons by the damned Warden race, it was understandable why the exiles all bore a grudge against the said race.</p>

  <p>Now that they finally had an opportunity to make the Warden race pay, they could barely hold back their glee.</p>

  <p>"Then, please follow us," Zelda said with a smile.</p>

  <p>At the head of the group were Luther and Zelda; Emily, Timotheus, Luo Zheng, and the other exiles followed closely behind.</p>

  <p>The hundreds of thousands of Wild Gods had no other choice but to stay outside.</p>

  <p>Just like in other cases where the situations were less than favorable for them, the Wild Gods chose to wait outside to see what would happen.</p>

  <p>As they traveled along the path, Luo Zheng noticed that the ambient light around them was growing dimmer and dimmer. Gradually, all of them were enveloped by a dark grey light.</p>

  <p>After about two hours, the group had already traveled more than a hundred miles when they caught sight of the vast sprawling horizon in front of them.</p>

  <p>"Is this our destination?" Luo Zheng's eyes slightly widened and his eyebrows raised.</p>

  <p>The other exiles' eyes also flashed with excitement and anticipation.</p>

  <p>Previously, they could only see the existence of the Curse Chains through Luther's ability. But after they went through the path together, it seemed that all of them gained the ability to see the Curse Chains by themselves and they no longer needed Luther's assistance.</p>

  <p>All the creatures in this world were connected to the Curse Chains that were floating in the air in front of them, probably reaching tens of millions or even hundreds of millions. The number of Curse Chains was so great that they seemed to cover the sky and sun, extending as far as their eyes could see.</p>

  <p>Large platforms were located some distance away, and all the Curse Chains were attached to them.</p>

  <p>"We've finally found this damned place, haha..." One of the exiles, someone from the Fire Melting race, was apparently unable to contain his excitement. "All I need to do is break the Curse Chain on my body, right?"</p>

  <p>Right after speaking, he stepped up into the air and summoned a spiral of flame that swirled around his whole body? it seemed that he used the spatial transference for this ability.</p>

  <p>"Please don't!"</p>

  <p>When she saw what he was about to do, Zelda attempted to halt the man by shouting out loud.</p>

  <p>But it was too late.</p>

  <p>In an instant, a mass of black liquid came out from the same space channel that the exile had created earlier. The black liquid engulfed him as soon as it came in contact with him.</p>

  <p>No one present knew the nature of this black liquid; all they saw was that it had wrapped the man tightly as it engulfed him completely.</p>

  <p>"Quintin!"</p>

  <p>The other exiles from the Fire Melting race were shocked at the scene that unfolded in front of them.</p>

  <p>A short old man came forward and waved his hand. A white jade ruler appeared in his hand. He immediately pointed the jade ruler towards Quintin Qin, and a tremendous burst of energy was released from the jade ruler.</p>

  <p>The old man obviously wanted to help liberate Quintin Qin from the clutches of the black liquid.</p>

  <p>But the black liquid was not budged by the white jade ruler. In retaliation, it spread quickly over the white jade ruler, intending to devour the ruler together with the old man who wielded it.</p>

  <p>The old man was left with no choice but to accept that he couldn't save Quintin Qin. He gritted his teeth hard and let go of the white jade ruler.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, Quintin Qin and the white jade ruler had been completely engulfed by the black liquid. Just like that, they had disappeared without a trace in front of everyone.</p>

  <p>The exiles had just witnessed one of them be obliterated in front of their very eyes.</p>

  <p>Being a member of the Fire Melting race, he had been considered at the middle rank among the exiles. They hadn't expected that he wouldn't be able to put up even a bit of resistance against the black liquid.</p>

  <p>No one was able to speak for a time; they could do nothing but stare at the spot where Quintin Qin had been just a few moments ago.</p>

  <p>"They already knew we would come, and they must have set several traps waiting for us. We can't act rashly!" Zelda told the exiles, a worried frown on her face.</p>

  <p>A sliver of fear could be detected behind Emily's eyes as she stated, "If my eyes didn't deceive me, this black liquid is the Erasing Water. They actually filled the space with the Erasing Water. How wicked they are!"</p>

  <p>Timotheus agreed. "It is indeed the Erasing Water. It can only exist in the space channel. We have no cause to panic as long as we are careful not to tear space apart. Everything will be fine!"</p>

  <p>Even after Timotheus reassured them, everyone's spirits were still down.</p>

  <p>It had not been an easy task for the exiles to reach this place. The two sides hadn't had a direct confrontation yet, but one of them had already died out of the blue. This trip would most probably be more challenging than what they had expected.</p>

  <p>Since the start of their journey, Luo Zheng kept his silence as he followed the group quietly.</p>

  <p>Although he had already made great progress, he knew he still wasn't powerful enough as compared to these exiles.</p>

  <p>At the moment, he knew he wouldn't be able to be of much help yet, so he could only wait and see.</p>

  <p>"Master Timotheus is right," Zelda nodded in affirmation. "Everyone, follow me. Even though they have set many traps, they are not as powerful as you think. Just be careful and don't be so reckless!"</p>

  <p>With Zelda in the lead, the group of a hundred people made their way forward in the dark world.</p>

  <p>Right at that moment, there was a group of more than thirty people standing on an elevated platform deep in the world's recesses.</p>

  <p>They were not members of the Warden race, but another group of exiles from the bone towers.</p>

  <p>They were apparently led by no other than Spark of the Yellow Emperor race.</p>

  <p>"Hey, this proves that this place is indeed powerful. Quintin hadn't been able to resist it and it became the end for him. In the past, I was his defeated opponent!" one of the exiles said with a laugh.</p>

  <p>With a grim expression on his face, Spark shook his head and said,</p>

  <p>"Don't be too careless. I'm afraid it's not as easy as you think."</p>
