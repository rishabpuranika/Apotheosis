  <p>
</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, a grey compass appeared in Kenelm's hand as soon as they arrived in the Cyan Brocade Plain.</p>

  <p>Kenelm gave the compass a gentle pat, and the compass began to spin.</p>

  <p>Being true to its name, the Cyan Brocade Plain resembled a piece of green tapestry at first glance. Without any object as a reference, anyone could get lost in it.</p>

  <p>As a man from the Excellence City, Kenelm quickly found the way to the cave with the help of the compass.</p>

  <p>After an hour of traveling, he stopped in the middle of the plain.</p>

  <p>Releasing his spiritual sense, Zheng noticed that there was a small pit at the bottom of the grass. Out of curiosity, he let his spiritual sense follow the pit and saw a cave.</p>

  <p>"Come on, let's go down the cave!"</p>

  <p>Kenelm was in a hurry to go downwards.</p>

  <p>Knowing that his friend had decided to get ahead of him, he became extremely anxious.</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, he sprinted downwards. Zheng, along with the other three consummate True Gods, followed suit.</p>

  <p>The cave below the grass was so narrow that it was possible for only one person to get in and out of it. One by one, the five people went down and crawled onward this narrow entrance.</p>

  <p>After a few hundred feet down the passageway, a broad karst cave appeared.</p>

  <p>After entering the karst cave, Kenelm held the compass to see which way they should be heading. Then he said, "Follow me, over there..."</p>

  <p>Walking a few steps along a path, Zheng suddenly stopped and gave a slight frown.</p>

  <p>Walking in front of him, Kenelm turned his head and asked, "Zheng, what's wrong?"</p>

  <p>Just behind Zheng, the consummate True Gods looked the exact same way.</p>

  <p>"Didn't your spiritual sense perceive it? Some things seem to be crawling over here," Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>Whenever a consummate True God, just like them, explored a strange place, they would spread out their spiritual sense very vigilantly. This was what Zheng was doing at this very moment, so were Kenelm and the others.</p>

  <p>To them, the spiritual sense was similar to another pair of their eyes.</p>

  <p>"I didn't sense anything!"</p>

  <p>"Well, me neither."</p>

  <p>Then they looked around, and their faces were full of caution.</p>

  <p>Kenelm's face darkened, and he continued, "Are they using some kind of hiding skill?"</p>

  <p>"I think so."</p>

  <p>By using his spiritual sense, Zheng could feel that the figures of those things were very blurry, like grass snakes or gray threads that appeared and disappeared, fluctuating.</p>

  <p>Whenever Zheng and the others stopped, those invisible things also seemed to stop moving forward. Once hidden, they remained undetected, even by Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Move on. Kenelm, please lead the way," spoke Zheng.</p>

  <p>Moving forward, the five people continued to go deeper into the karst cave.</p>

  <p>The moment Zheng took a single step forward, he could sense the movement again from the undetected creatures.</p>

  <p>Right at that moment, Zheng didn't say anything and just silently stayed behind Kenelm, following him.</p>

  <p>After a couple of more steps, they were already deep into the karst cave.</p>

  <p>After a few hundred feet, the things sensed by Zheng's spiritual sense also quickened all of a sudden. At the same time, they heard a rustling sound that came to surround them quickly.</p>

  <p>Now, it was not only Zheng who felt them but also the four other warriors who were with him.</p>

  <p>What was strange about it was that although they heard so many crawling and strange noises, they were still unable to see them visually, nor by using their spiritual senses.</p>

  <p>"What the hell are these things?"</p>

  <p>"Don't move! Stay put! We can't see them!"</p>

  <p>As Zheng noticed the nervous expressions of the four other warriors, his lips were pressed into a thin line.</p>

  <p>Although they were the aboriginal people of the Source World, their endurance was really quite terrible, making them freak out by the tiniest of sounds and trouble.</p>

  <p>Just then, from the depths of the cave, a voice sounded saying, "You'd better not move!"</p>

  <p>As soon as the voice trailed off, a light green figure emerged gently. A young man leaned on a corner of the cave and spoke faintly.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyebrows lifted at the sight of this young man.</p>

  <p>In reality, this young man was also a consummate True God, but he had already comprehended the Truth of Godly Way. His hiding theurgy was created using the Truth of Cultivation Nature.</p>

  <p>Zheng was also able to hide himself by taking advantage of the Truth of Cultivation Nature, but his hiding skill relied on the natural laws of the Truth of Cultivation Nature, which was why it wasn't as good as this young man's.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the young man gently waved his hand and the cave began to emit green light spots the size of a rice grain. But after the green light dissipated, what appeared were rice-sized ants.</p>

  <p>"Interesting. No wonder these ants could avoid my spiritual sense's perception. They also use the Truth of Cultivation Nature," Zheng said after observing, with the corner of his mouth curling up.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng could still keep calm, it was far difficult for the other four to do the same.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, all of their faces changed greatly as soon as they saw the black ants.</p>

  <p>"Noxious Army Ants! What do you want from us?" a consummate True God shouted as he feared for his life.</p>

  <p>The Noxious Army Ant was a well-known poisonous insect in the Gracious Province. If a True God was bitten by the insect, its poison could spread all over their body, making their body instantly decay which would lead to a miserable death.</p>

  <p>Someone had said that a martial artist had to cut the area bitten by the Noxious Army Ant within three seconds. Otherwise, they would definitely die. Obviously, the Noxious Army Ant was a very deadly insect.</p>

  <p>How could they not panic when they found out that there were so many Noxious Army Ants around them?</p>

  <p>As the young man waved his hand lightly, a wisp of green light emanated from the surface of the Noxious Army Ants, which disappeared again from the crowd's eyes. At the same time, he said, "I don't want to do anything.</p>

  <p>Tanner has predicted that someone would explore this cave. That's why he asked me to stay here and guard it. If you are clever enough to leave, we can just pretend that this didn't happen. But if you take one more step forward... After all, this karst cave has such beautiful scenery, making it the perfect place to bury you,"</p>

  <p>With his eyes filled with murderous intent, the young man threatened the group.</p>

  <p>"Tanner!"</p>

  <p>Kenelm's eyes filled with furious resentment.</p>

  <p>Tanner, Kenelm and the others had the same cultivation base, and they had a good relationship in the Excellence City.</p>

  <p>However, it was out of Kenelm's expectation that Tanner took some strangers here, and that now he even wanted to block them outside. How could he not hate his own friend?</p>

  <p>Looking at Kenelm's irritated eyes, Zheng heaved a soft sigh in his heart. He sympathized because he knew that betrayal was one of the worst feelings in the world.</p>

  <p>"Go back, losers. After all, none of you are qualified to enter the Stinger Guard's tomb," the young man said impatiently as he waved his hand.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the other three consummate True Gods already wanted to retreat. They knew that no matter how attractive the Stinger Guard's tomb was, it still wasn't worth losing their lives for.</p>

  <p>"So, Kenelm, what shall we do? Shall we just go back?" one of them asked, waiting for an instruction.</p>

  <p>Kenelm hesitated for a while as he thought that he might have underestimated Tanner's helpers.</p>

  <p>Although he had invited Zheng, a consummate True God who had stepped into the Sea of Truth and had a Soul of Light that could subdue the evil spirit in the tomb, he still was not aware of how strong Zheng was, nor did he expect too much from him.</p>

  <p>Kenelm felt helpless at that moment. He nodded his head in frustration and accepted his friend's suggestion for there was nothing more he could do.</p>

  <p>Just as he was about to instruct everyone to leave, Zheng suddenly asked,</p>

  <p>"Kenelm, do you know if the Noxious Army Ants are afraid of fire?"</p>
