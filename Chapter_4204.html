<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4204 The Death Sword (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As the Monkey Spirit King glared at Sewell, he remembered what this cunning Snake Master had done to him in the Night View Island. After several painful, but unsuccessful attempts to wriggle his way out, Sewell was forcefully kneaded into a ball by the Monkey Spirit King along with several Holy Stones. As the Holy Stones lit up and erupted with Light of Annihilation, Sewell's body was reduced to ashes as he burned to death under the overwhelming heat...</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, inside the stone hall, the battle between Zheng and the irregular heavy sword continued on.</p>

  <p>He had smashed the irregular heavy sword so many times that he lost count. As he continued his relentless attacks, he began to notice that the irregular heavy sword was taking longer intervals to recover compared to before.</p>

  <p>When Zheng smashed it once more, the green light that shone through the sword started to weaken as it got dimmer. Simultaneously, it took even longer to regenerate itself back to its complete form.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>This time, while the irregular heavy sword was in the middle of repairing itself, it was struck by Zheng's fist again.</p>

  <p>Before the crack could completely recover itself, it began to expand further as it spread across the sword.</p>

  <p>Taking advantage of its vulnerability from having endured several blows, Zheng threw in countless punches at the damaged sword. As a result, many cracks extended from the hilt of the sword before it finally gave in and broke into dozens of pieces.</p>

  <p>Click, click, click...</p>

  <p>As the irregular pieces fell to the ground, they scattered in all directions.</p>

  <p>"I finally finished it..."</p>

  <p>Zheng let out a sigh of relief before he turned to walk straight towards the black armor after sensing he had wasted too much time on this one single sword.</p>

  <p>As soon as he took two steps forward towards his destination, the irregular pieces of the sword on the ground began to tremble as they rose up to the air and floated in the space above him. Zheng watched as the broken pieces gathered in one place and pieced themselves together to reshape the sword.</p>

  <p>"Damn it. When will this end!?"</p>

  <p>Zheng balled his hands into fists as he tightened his jaw, his eyes reflected unparalleled rage coupled with a hint of impatience. With a flash, he returned to the irregular heavy sword and threw a punch, channeling his inner frustration out.</p>

  <p>However, before this punch hit the blade, the irregular heavy sword suddenly became ethereal. Zheng's fist penetrated through its shadow, while the irregular heavy sword returned to the black armor's hand.</p>

  <p>Sizzle, sizzle, Sizzle...</p>

  <p>Traces of thick black fog began to emanate from the sword. As the fog began to spread across the entire stone hall, it consumed all the light and continued to expand its inky influence, as everything fell into darkness.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, inside the black armor, Kincaid remained in a state of shock.</p>

  <p>This mere human had actually managed to defeat him!</p>

  <p>He couldn't help but wonder what had happened to the main world after witnessing such a spectacle.</p>

  <p>How could a creature as powerful as him appear in the chaos?</p>

  <p>At that point, he was a product of many conflicting emotions welling up inside of him. On one hand, he was left speechless by Zheng's actions and potential, but on the other hand, he sympathized with him.</p>

  <p>'Breaking my Life Sword will be the worst mistake you've made in your entire life, ' Kincaid thought to himself. He knew full well about the boundless potential that the Death Sword possessed.</p>

  <p>Kincaid had spent a decent amount of time with this heavy sword. During the countless battles he had experienced, Kincaid had only wielded the Death Sword three times. The fact that once the Death Sword was activated, even Kincaid would find it difficult to control it was evident enough to vouch for its strength.</p>

  <p>Both he and the sword would find themselves in a tough situation where they would be unstoppable and incapable of controlling their impulses.</p>

  <p>The darkness that shrouded the area lasted for three seconds, before several horizontal and vertical streaks of green light bounced off each other and lit up the space.</p>

  <p>These light streaks refused to meet an end, as they would extend to infinite distances, outlining numerous large cubes in this space.</p>

  <p>"Did the space just change? Are we no longer in the stone hall?" Zheng couldn't help but blurt out his inner thoughts as he paid attention to his switched surroundings.</p>

  <p>"The space isn't the only thing that's changed..." The ancestry-level bloodline's voice resounded in his ears. "This sword has changed all the rules. This is another world, a world with new rules."</p>

  <p>"Is that so... A world with different rules..." Zheng exclaimed in an awestruck voice as though he was hypnotized by what he witnessed.</p>

  <p>"You are correct..."</p>

  <p>Kincaid replied nonchalantly from inside the black armor.</p>

  <p>Unable to control himself, he clenched the heavy sword securely in his grip and charged towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Damn. What an incredible speed..."</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes widened subconsciously as he watched Kincaid close in on him.</p>

  <p>Before he could have a moment to dodge, Zheng was struck hard with the heavy sword.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Zheng was thrown off into the air as though he were weightless, and his body flew past countless cubes from the impact.</p>

  <p>If he were still in the stone hall, his trajectory would have been interrupted after getting knocked into a wall at a distance of several hundred feet.</p>

  <p>But now, he had been falling backward in the space for dozens of miles, unable to stop himself as the path was endless, and there was no obstruction in the way to break his fall. This was a world of infinite length and width.</p>
