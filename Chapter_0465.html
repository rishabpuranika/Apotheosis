<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 465 Sword Washing Pool (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The greatest gain he had achieved in his epiphanic state was to establish a connection with the Killing Sword Mountain. This wouldn't have been visible immediately to the audience but he would feel the effects. After he had practiced the killing sword skill, the benefits of that connection would appear and increase gradually. His second greatest gain was the sword spirit. Born with powerful malicious Mu Ning, Lily had now become a great battle force that Luo Zheng could rely on as soon as she came into being.</p>

  <p>But he hadn't let Lily appear in front of the public just yet. She was hidden inside Zheng's mind, and her Mu Ning naturally did not spill over.</p>

  <p>Therefore, no one noticed that there was an entirely new person hidden inside him.</p>

  <p>Tianming's sword intent overflowed for a long time, and then slowly calmed and restored. Tianming took a deep breath and let it out slowly. A peaceful and delighted smile appeared on his face. With Tianming's grave character, such a happy expression could indicate only one thing: that he had gained a lot in his sleep.</p>

  <p>That he had!</p>

  <p>As soon as he had understood the consummate sword intent, he had been pulled into a place called the Sword Washing Pool!</p>

  <p>As someone who was crazy about swords and intents and legends, Tianming had paid special attention to the stories of the masters. The Sword Washing Pool had been mentioned in a book he had read. The book had said it was a semi-holy place.</p>

  <p>So, on finding himself granted an opportunity to go into the Sword Washing Pool, how could he restrain his excitement? After all, only a very small number of people among the tens of millions of swordsmen would have received such an opportunity. Not everyone would have managed to perfect the sword intent and even if they did, they weren't sure to be allowed to enter the semi-holy land to improve their sword intent.</p>

  <p>Cultivating in the Sword Washing Pool could not only improve his sword intent, but could also add a special attribute to it.</p>

  <p>So Tianming had dipped his sword into the Sword Washing Pool and began to practice his intent.</p>

  <p>After a long time, changes had taken place in the Sword Washing Pool.</p>

  <p>The water of the pool had emitted glaring blue thunder and lightning, which had poured crazily into Tianming's body and his Blood-corroding Sword. In the end, the thunder and lightning had merged with his sword intent, granting it several new powers.</p>

  <p>With that in his mind, he had named his new sword intent as the Extreme Thunder Sword Intent.</p>

  <p>Thunder and lightning was a kind of natural phenomenon, which was also seen as a divine punishment. The Heavenly Sword Tianming was practicing was already powerful in attack. Now its attack was greater after being mixed with the strong natural powers of the world. Thunder and lightning could have dealt catastrophic damage to his opponents. It was quite obvious that the Extreme Thunder Sword Intent could enhance Tianming's fighting capability greatly.</p>

  <p>"Congratulations, Tianming, it looks like you got a great opportunity in your state of epiphany." Luo Zheng congratulated him with a smile.</p>

  <p>Tianming nodded. He didn't need to be modest. To be able to cultivate in the legendary semi-holy place was enough for him to show off his good fortune.</p>

  <p>The person with such kind of good fortunes was favored by the heavens and was destined to be a great man. There wouldn't be a second one for a thousand years in the whole Eastern Region. If he continued to be modest, it would be hypocritical in nature.</p>

  <p>"I tried my best in my last attack, but I still couldn't defeat you. That means I have already lost the game," Tianming said slowly. "But since both of us understood the consummate sword intent at the same time, the battle had to be suspended in between. With that situation taken care of, I want to challenge you once again with both of us at a higher level of swordsmanship now."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded when he heard Tianming's words. "Ok, I accept your challenge. Let's see who wins the final battle."</p>

  <p>The disciples of Cloud Sect had been sitting in their places for more than two hours, waiting for Luo Zheng and Tianming to complete their epiphany. They were all quite bored now.</p>

  <p>Those who had been watching through the Picture Slab were in a slightly better state. They could have left the Picture Slab for a while to do what they wanted to do when there was nothing interesting to see. But those on the scene of All Peak Competition were unable to do so.</p>

  <p>This naturally meant that as soon as they heard Tianming say that he had lost, they were fired in anger and ready to swear and shout.</p>

  <p>'We have been waiting for you for so long and all you can do is admit defeat? Boo! Are you kidding?'</p>

  <p>Then they heard Tianming say that he would challenge Luo Zheng once again.</p>

  <p>They cheered at once.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Sword of Tianming had been so powerful. Now that he had understood the consummate sword intent and there was an additional thunder and lightning power in his sword, how strong could he be now?</p>

  <p>That remained to be seen but one thing was clear: there was going to be much flash and much bang now in the arena.</p>

  <p>"Can he defeat Luo Zheng and turn him into a piece of lightning-struck burnt wood with his sword?" One of the disciples asked.</p>

  <p>"I am not sure whether he will chop Luo Zheng into burnt wood pieces or not.</p>

  <p>But I can say for certain that Luo Zheng is a difficult opponent to deal with," answered another.</p>

  <p>"Yes. You know? I used to think that Luo Zheng would defeat Tianming easily.</p>

  <p>But it's hard to say now. Obviously, both of them have grasped the consummate sword intent. But Tianming seems to have gained more benefits than Luo Zheng did. When Luo Zheng woke up from the epiphany, he showed no signs of a sharp increase in strength. And Tianming emitted lightning himself. It seems that Luo Zheng has clearly not gained much from the epiphany," A third one remarked.</p>

  <p>The state of epiphany was a great opportunity for the martial art refiners but not everyone was sure to reap remarkable benefits from it. Anything could happen in that state. Sometimes, people entered the state of epiphany, but ended up getting nothing helpful from it. Stories like this could be found everywhere.</p>

  <p>Tianming raised his Blood-corroding Sword slightly. After he had understood the consummate sword intent, every sword cyclone around him was more and more aggressive now, and there was a trace of thunder and lightning hidden inside them. Tianming knew clearly that the power of thunder and lightning he had obtained from the Sword Washing Pool was by no means ordinary. They were definitely more powerful than any mortal man could imagine.</p>

  <p>He was confident that he could defeat Luo Zheng this time.</p>

  <p>As Tianming was building up the power of his sword with full confidence, Luo Zheng called upon the sword spirit in his mind. Lily faded into existence gradually at his side.</p>

  <p>"Wait what...! There is another person inside the arena! And she is a beauty! Where did she come from? What happened? What's going on?"</p>

  <p>A disciple shouted out uncontrollably.</p>
