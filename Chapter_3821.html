  <p>
</p>

  <p>The doors of these two rooms with hexagram arrays were opposite each other.</p>

  <p>Zheng and the others stayed in the room on the left and saw what happened in the other room. All of them blanched in fear at the scene.</p>

  <p>The fox girl's lips curved into a smile as she knew the Other Shore creatures in the left room were watching her. "I'm coming," she said.</p>

  <p>Her tempting voice sounded like the final judgment of death, which sent a chill down everyone's spine.</p>

  <p>"Retreat!"</p>

  <p>"We have no choice but to fight her!"</p>

  <p>"Fight? Even the Blessing Myriad Token had no effect on her. Do you have any better ideas than that?"</p>

  <p>The Other Shore creatures in the right room were by no means weak. They bravely fought back, but they still ended up dead!</p>

  <p>One of the most terrible things that could happen to anyone was to be unable to do anything in a desperate situation.</p>

  <p>They silently watched the fox girl step out of the hexagram array, turn into a beautiful painting, and slowly walk towards them while they couldn't think of any solutions at all!</p>

  <p>"What kind of method did she use just now? It looked like she directly dissolved the energy in the Blessing Myriad Token," Egan said thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>He was one of the few people who could remain composed.</p>

  <p>Of course, Zheng also thought hard about the same question.</p>

  <p>The Blessing Myriad Token Walden had summoned was indeed quite powerful. Even if they weren't in the same room, Zheng could sense its strength.</p>

  <p>However, the fox girl didn't fight the Blessing Myriad Token directly.</p>

  <p>Instead, it seemed that she had used a special method to dissolve its energy.</p>

  <p>But how could she erase such an immense amount of energy in the Blessing Myriad Token without a trace?</p>

  <p>What kind of method was that?</p>

  <p>"I've never seen such a powerful method before. I didn't even know that someone so strong was hiding within the Eternal Scroll Painting," the Primeval Lord of Heaven commented.</p>

  <p>If even the knowledgeable Primeval Lord of Heaven couldn't understand what method she had used, then it was over. Zheng's heart sank in despair.</p>

  <p>Just then, Egan suddenly said, "I have a Soul-trapping Rope. If I can capture her with it, everything she will do will be useless!"</p>

  <p>"A Soul-trapping Rope?! Is that true?"</p>

  <p>At that moment, the miserable Other Shore creatures in the room quickly lit up with hope.</p>

  <p>These Other Shore creatures who had entered the Eternal Scroll Painting were outstanding elites and highly valued in their respective races. Sure enough, they all carried some precious treasures with them.</p>

  <p>"The only problem is if the Soul-trapping Rope will have any effect on the fox girl," said Egan hesitantly.</p>

  <p>"Whether it will work or not, we still have to try," Zheng said determinedly as his fighting intent rose in his chest.</p>

  <p>According to his rich experience in fighting in desperate situations, those who were indecisive and hesitant always lost and died. On the other hand, they could still have a chance of survival if they launched a counterattack against the odds.</p>

  <p>"Okay then," Egan said with just as much resolution.</p>

  <p>Then, he took two steps forward and shook his right hand. A golden rope appeared on his arm and coiled around it like a snake.</p>

  <p>As for Zheng, he retreated to a side and stood beside the hexagram array.</p>

  <p>Since the fox girl was a creature who lived in the Eternal Scroll Painting, she must be somehow different from them. Whether ordinary methods were effective against her or not was an important question, but they practically had no other choice at the moment.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the remaining Other Shore creatures retreated to the back of the room.</p>

  <p>"This is useless..."</p>

  <p>"She's just too invincible!"</p>

  <p>"We all will die. We will truly die here today!"</p>

  <p>After they witnessed the horrible scene in the other room, they lost their will to fight. They believed that it was useless to counterattack like what Zheng and Egan did.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, I have a treasure that will protect you well," offered Kirk, who managed to conquer his fear.</p>

  <p>In his hand was a small purple gourd. He pointed the gourd towards Zheng and Egan as he spoke, then its opening emitted shimmering light films.</p>

  <p>The rays of light floated in the air and gathered around Zheng and Egan.</p>

  <p>"This is the Heavenly Gourd Robe. It can help you withstand fifty thousand divine megatons of force," explained Kirk.</p>

  <p>Fifty thousand divine megatons of force was a substantial amount of energy.</p>

  <p>If Kirk's treasure and a Holy Soul's Chaotic Source Spirits were combined, then it would be enough to block an ordinary Eternal Realm master's attacks. Evidently, the Heavenly Gourd Robe was an extraordinary Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>Zheng and Egan held their breaths in concentration. The fox girl on the ground slowly moved into the room and approached the hexagram array.</p>

  <p>She turned from a painting into a living creature, and her attractive figure quickly materialized in front of them. "Do it!" Zheng commanded in a low voice.</p>

  <p>With a flick of Egan's hand, the Soul-trapping Rope slipped from his arm and wrapped around the fox girl's body.</p>

  <p>As soon as the Soul-trapping Rope wrapped around the fox girl, Zheng's body unleashed his strength. Driven by tremendous power, his fist collided against the fox girl's head like a hammer to a nail.</p>

  <p>In turn, all the other creatures in the room were stunned into silence.</p>

  <p>The Blessing Myriad Token that Walden had just summoned was quite powerful, but Zheng's punch contained nearly half of the same force. Did it mean that his physical strength was on par to half the power of the Blessing Myriad Token?</p>

  <p>Weren't Eternal Realm masters the only ones who possessed such a level of strength?</p>

  <p>All of the creatures present came to the Eternal Scroll Painting with the desire to reach the Eternal Realm, but Zheng was already as strong as an Eternal Realm master!</p>

  <p>However, their current situation was extremely critical. Although everyone was shocked at Zheng's display of strength, they were still worried about the fox girl and not him. Would his punch be enough to kill her?</p>

  <p>The fox girl, who was bound by the Soul-trapping Rope, did not have time to react before she saw a massive fist smash down her head.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes widened to the size of saucers when his fist hit the fox girl's skull. It worked!</p>

  <p>It seemed that the fox girl truly lost her powers and theurgies after the Soul-trapping Rope bound her. Zheng's fist broke her skull open, then blood and brains gushed out of it.</p>

  <p>Although half of her head was gone, she was still alive. She raised her right hand and crossed two fingers together. It turned out that she wanted to use her strange theurgy!</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>In return, Zheng quickly twisted her slender arms and ruthlessly broke her bones in the process. That way, he prevented her from unleashing the strange law power from her fingertips.</p>

  <p>It was a critical moment, so Zheng naturally didn't show any mercy. After he broke her arms, he threw another punch to her chest. The strong force hit her chest so hard that it sent her petite body flying backward.</p>

  <p>Because the hexagram array was in her path, she turned back into a painting on the ground as she flew out of the room. Finally, she hit the wall opposite the room, and her mangled body was torn into pieces.</p>

  <p>The painting she turned into was no longer in a human shape but scattered on the ground like a broken sack.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Egan still tightly held on to the other end of the Soul-trapping Rope.</p>

  <p>Half of the rope was in its normal form, while the other half was entangled with the broken pieces of the painting outside the room. "Is she dead?"</p>

  <p>Egan asked cautiously.</p>

  <p>Even if Zheng's attacks had mutilated the fox girl's body, he didn't dare retrieve the Soul-trapping Rope until he confirmed she was dead.</p>

  <p>"If she was a normal Other Shore creature, she should have died," Zheng said with a frown.</p>

  <p>He had crushed her head and pierced her chest. Even an Eternal Realm master would've died from such serious injuries.</p>

  <p>Those Other Shore creatures who had given up also stared at her damaged body on the ground. Zheng's counterattack completely turned the tables, and they started to see the hope in survival.</p>

  <p>However, their optimism only lasted for several seconds. About ten seconds later, the broken limbs suddenly moved.</p>
