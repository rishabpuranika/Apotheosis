<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2903 A Fleeting Chance </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>An orange scepter appeared in Estelle's hand. She gently said, "Do I need to take action?"</p>

  <p>"Wait!"</p>

  <p>Holy Jay said as he looked ahead.</p>

  <p>He had only one chance; naturally, his judgment was crucial!</p>

  <p>On the top of the divine land...</p>

  <p>Mike pulled a long face.</p>

  <p>Holy Jay told Mike what he saw.</p>

  <p>According to their originally planned schedule, they would get the best opportunity when Leif took action. However, the Yellow Emperor Guards seemed to be more prepared than expected.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?" Luo Zheng asked as he stared at his father.</p>

  <p>"Hamish is still blocking the gate of the Mountain of Holy Beings," said Mike, frowning.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng thought for a moment and said, "I can head down there first."</p>

  <p>Hamish's flames might be extremely terrifying, but Luo Zheng thought he could withstand them. As long as he got into the Mountain of Holy Beings, everything would be fine.</p>

  <p>Mike shook his head and said, "It's not just Hamish who is blocking the gate; another Yellow Emperor Guard is also stationed there."</p>

  <p>"It's impossible to find a perfect chance," Luo Zheng said earnestly. "This scene is exactly what we have predicted in our original plan. Besides, we still have Estelle."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng also knew that although his father intended to send him to the Mountain of Holy Beings, he was still worried about him.</p>

  <p>However, they had no other choice but to risk storming into the Mountain of Holy Beings. The perfect opportunity to do so was fleeting, so they could only take so many risks.</p>

  <p>Mike didn't say anything because he believed in Holy Jay's judgment.</p>

  <p>At the foot of the Mountain of Holy Beings, after its poisoned blood arrow was blocked by Salim, the Emperor Resentment stretched out its thick tentacles again towards the two Other Shore Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>Its body also rushed toward them.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Salim said with a laugh, "This beast is stupid!" As he spoke, he once again unleashed the Truth of Holy Words. This time, he uttered two words, "Sword Strike!"</p>

  <p>The invisible giant swords rotating at a high speed materialized in front of Salim.</p>

  <p>The Emperor Resentment's tentacles and body were cut into pieces by the giant swords. Blood splashed like rain with mangled flesh flying everywhere.</p>

  <p>Woo! Woo! Woo!</p>

  <p>The Emperor Resentment became mad with rage and it hurled itself with all its might against the swords.</p>

  <p>The power of the colossal creature was terrifying. Salim's token was extremely remarkable, but the flesh that those swords severed from the Emperor Resentment was like nothing. Although the Emperor Resentment felt a sharp pain, it did not die.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>Finally, the Emperor Resentment's huge body hit the oval-shaped light ball which pressed against the Mountain of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>The light ball was extremely strong, but its defensive power was limited.</p>

  <p>The oval-shaped light ball made a sizzling sound while being squeezed between the Emperor Resentment and the Mountain of Holy Beings. Small cracks began to appear on its surface.</p>

  <p>When Hamish suddenly saw the cracks, a worried look appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>He was not afraid of this monster, but he had to admit that the Emperor Resentment was still too powerful. Given enough time to challenge the Emperor Resentment, he would be able to kill it in his unharmed state. No matter how powerful the Emperor Resentment was, it was hard for it to give play to its strength.</p>

  <p>However, they had to guard the Mountain of Holy Beings now. If the light ball was broken, they would probably be crushed by the Emperor Resentment.</p>

  <p>"Can you stand it?" Hamish asked worriedly.</p>

  <p>Salim smiled bitterly. "I can't bear it, I'm about to..." Then his expression changed and he shouted, "Go!"</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The ball of light shattered, and the large body of the Emperor Resentment hurtled toward them.</p>

  <p>The two powerful Other Shore Realm warriors reacted quickly. They employed the Grand Teleportation technique to escape the instant the light ball broke into pieces.</p>

  <p>Crash!</p>

  <p>The Emperor Resentment's huge body slammed against the side of the Mountain of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>The Mountain of Holy Beings was so solid that the Other Shore Realm warriors could not shake it. Although the body of the Emperor Resentment was about as large as the mountain, the Mountain of Holy Beings did not budge an inch under such massive impact.</p>

  <p>"They have finally left! Now's our chance!"</p>

  <p>Overjoyed at this scene, Holy Jay immediately sent a message to Mike, who was currently outside the divine land.</p>

  <p>When Mike informed Emily, the Truth of Void Destruction shot downwards from Emily's fingertip.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>A space channel materialized, penetrating the outer layer of the divine land at a high speed, passing through a Holy Being's universe, and accurately ending up about a hundred feet away from the gate of the Mountain of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>The location and distance of the space channel had been carefully calculated and prepared beforehand, ensuring its accuracy.</p>

  <p>"Go!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng jumped into the space channel without hesitation.</p>

  <p>Tianming and Sword Chen followed closely behind.</p>

  <p>Instantaneously, the three of them disappeared into the space channel...</p>

  <p>Just as Hamish and Salim were escaping using the Grand Teleportation technique, a space channel descended. Their expressions changed dramatically.</p>

  <p>"It's a space channel!"</p>

  <p>"It is the channel formed by the Truth of Void Destruction. The warriors outside the divine land are making their move!"</p>

  <p>Leyton ordered Hamish and Salim to guard the gate of the Mountain of Holy Beings and never abandon their posts. With the recent attack by the monster, they had to get out of the way.</p>

  <p>They didn't expect the warriors from outside the divine land to take action after they were just forced by the Emperor Resentment to escape from the gate of the Mountain of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>Since the Emperor Resentment failed to hit the two warriors, it adjusted its direction and rushed towards them again. However, they no longer had any intentions of fighting the Emperor Resentment.</p>

  <p>The two of them were about to use the Grand Teleportation technique to move to the gate of the Mountain of Holy Beings and stand guard. At that moment, Holy Jay, who was located one thousand miles away, nodded at Estelle.</p>

  <p>Estelle wielded her scepter without the slightest hesitation, and an invisible force field enclosed her. In the blink of an eye, the force field spread throughout the whole of the divine land, from the North Star Region to the South Dipper Region, and from the Floating Islands to the Time Sea. An eerie silence descended over the entire place.</p>

  <p>In addition to sound, everyone's abilities were temporarily blocked. True Gods were unable to communicate with their inner worlds, and Holy Beings were unable to communicate with their universes.</p>

  <p>Such a skill blocked nearly all of the strength of the whole divine land.</p>

  <p>Even the Other Shore Realm warriors were not immune to the power of the Scepter of Gods' Silence.</p>

  <p>How could Hamish and Salim employ the Grand Teleportation technique?</p>

  <p>Not only could they not make use of this technique, but their flying abilities were blocked. They both plummeted down from midair.</p>

  <p>However, the Emperor Resentment's attack did not stop. It used its physical strength, so Estelle's spell could not seal it. A thick tentacle immediately hit the bodies of the two Yellow Emperor Guards.</p>

  <p>There was no sound, and the only sight was that two warriors rolled in the air like broken kites, their strings of blood leaving traces behind them.</p>

  <p>The two of them were not the only ones who were affected. The consummate True Gods and Demi-holy Beings, who all flew into the sky in order to avoid the Time Sea's tsunami, were now dropping rapidly.</p>

  <p>As they fell down, their faces turned deathly pale.</p>

  <p>They were not afraid of falling down from a height of over one hundred thousand feet. However, the colorful sea water created by the tsunami swirled ominously below them, and falling into the Time Sea meant a sure, inescapable death.</p>
