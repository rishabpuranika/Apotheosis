<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 200 Fierce Fight In The Sky (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The bright moon appeared as though it were a silver pan hanging in the sky. With no clouds seen at night, it was indeed such a remarkable sight.</p>

  <p>Upon raising his head and looking around, Zheng noticed more than ten people not too far away floating in the high sky. As he slowly got closer, Zheng started to recognize them. They were the powerful men of the Illuminating Soul Realm that he had seen in Governor's House earlier.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in front of these powerful men were four giant animals floating in the sky as well.</p>

  <p>All of these giant animals exuded a terrifying evil spirit. However, they were different from the evil spirits of demon soldiers and generals, as theirs could be seen!</p>

  <p>Secretly, he could not help but be frightened. 'Their evil spirits are so strong! The four giant animals must be demon kings!' Zheng thought to himself.</p>

  <p>A demon king was the most powerful. It was the top-tier among all other demons.</p>

  <p>In the past, every time a demon king was born, it would bring great damages and horrible deaths.</p>

  <p>Before the Burning Sky Empire was founded, a demon king was a nightmare even for powerful men.</p>

  <p>According to an ancient book, a demon king once fought all the way in the Eastern Region and destroyed hundreds of cities. He led his subordinates to massacre residents in the city. As a result, in the northwest of the Eastern Region, humans were destroyed and not a soul could be found for thousands of miles.</p>

  <p>When the Burning Sky Empire was founded along with the Cloud Sect, the situation was secured at last.</p>

  <p>In the last thousands of years, as all kinds of secret skills, cultivation methods, treasures, and geniuses appeared, the power of the demon king was gradually suppressed. Humans in Eastern Region hit back successfully and killed many demon kings.</p>

  <p>Regardless, no wise man ever underestimated the strength of a powerful demon king. Especially not in the course of this battle as four of them had banded together. What made the situation worse was that among the four were two old famous demon kings, Aldrich and Oceiros!</p>

  <p>"Humans, the demons will eventually occupy this area. If you are wise enough to surrender, I might give each of you a chance to stay alive," one of the demon kings said.</p>

  <p>The demon king was different from a demon general who could only speak very little in a harsh voice. Conversely, the demon king could talk like a human. If people did not see his appearance and only heard his voice, they would think it was just a human speaking.</p>

  <p>"Aldrich, White Emperor City is guarding the country here and won't make any concession. If you are wise, please retreat quickly!" It was Spencer speaking. As soon as he tightened his grip on a big hammer, the orange life vitality emanated from the weapon.</p>

  <p>Although the life vitality did not possess great strength, the power hidden within it was terrifying.</p>

  <p>Standing beside Aldrich, the demon king called Oceiros flapped the huge wings on his back as he spoke, "Quack, Aldrich. It is no use talking to these humans. Cut the crap. If you want to truly convince them, you must show them some blood and death."</p>

  <p>After hearing what Oceiros said, all the powerful men of the Illuminating Soul Realm changed the expression on their faces. From the look of things, there was no way to prevent the battle today.</p>

  <p>At the top of the city wall, the battle between the imperial army and demon soldiers and generals was a piece of cake.</p>

  <p>What could really decide the war situation, however, was the battle in the sky.</p>

  <p>More than that, humans had to take on the assault of four demon kings at the same time, which never happened before as far as anyone could remember. All the powerful men of the Illuminating Soul Realm had immense power, but they felt inferior to the demon kings floating before them.</p>

  <p>"Hmm! You are right. The weak humans have a strong will. Generally, it is hard to persuade them. We can only teach them with a bloodbath!" As soon as Aldrich stopped talking, he sped up suddenly.</p>

  <p>The people only managed to see a flash of the wings on Aldrich's back before he disappeared without warning. Then, they saw a black shadow descending from the dark sky. The demon king steered towards a powerful man of the Illuminating Soul Realm at an incredible speed.</p>

  <p>Anyone who joined the Illuminating Soul Realm was, by design, a genius with elite talents.</p>

  <p>Although the targeted man had prepared in advance, none of them imagined that Aldrich's speed would be so off the roof. By the time he reacted, it was too late for him to evade the demon king's attack.</p>

  <p>"Poof!"</p>

  <p>Three bone spurs had cut through the body of the powerful man in an instant. His body was ruthlessly crushed. Through the bone spur, the demon king could suck the man's flesh as well as blood all at once!</p>

  <p>In no time, the three bone spurs dried him completely. When the demon king was done with him, only the shriveled skin was left to collapse on the ground lightly.</p>

  <p>As the people witnessed the horror, their expressions vastly changed!</p>

  <p>There were two kinds of demon kings.</p>

  <p>One was the ordinary demon king, while the other was the demon king with a name, like Aldrich and Oceiros. The second kind was much more powerful than the ordinary ones as they could amplify their strengths continuously.</p>

  <p>In the past, the imperial army fought against demons and defeated them many times. However, they had never killed Aldrich.</p>

  <p>Since then, no one had projected that Aldrich could reach this level.</p>

  <p>Even Spencer did not see the demon king's speed clearly just now.</p>

  <p>Aldrich curled his lips and said, "The human is delicious as always.</p>

  <p>What do you think? I can give you another chance. It is not late yet if you surrender now. Otherwise, I will eat all of you one by one in this way!"</p>

  <p>"No way!" Spencer answered coldly. As the governor, he could not lose the momentum at any time. "Everyone, be careful. Aldrich's speed has increased a lot. Don't let him get close to you!"</p>

  <p>While Spencer concentrated on warning everybody, Aldrich moved again unexpectedly. The latter flapped his huge wings and flew at a high speed. Again, no one caught him with his or her own eyes.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, Aldrich appeared beside Yolande and caught her. "I will eat this white and tender baby!" the demon king said mercilessly.</p>

  <p>Yolande was expressionless, though she reacted more rapidly than the powerful man whom Aldrich had swallowed just a moment ago. She shook her finger, and an invisible enchantment appeared like a shield in front of her.</p>
