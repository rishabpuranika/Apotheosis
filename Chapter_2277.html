</p>

  <p>"The Golden Beast Statue is a real gem. Its full body was made from a special material, and it can transform into the shapes of thousands of beasts. After refining it, the user can skillfully resist the low-rank True Gods with it. But to you, I believe it isn't of much use as you can already defeat most of the low-rank True Gods easily. Therefore, I was wondering what use it is to you?" Her eyes lit up with curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Well, I just have a liking for it," Luo Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>Joy nodded but didn't quite believe Luo Luo Zheng. He must have known something about the Golden Beast Statue, but since he didn't want to discuss it, she didn't pursue the subject.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled triumphantly as she left.</p>

  <p>The mud tray at the bottom of the Golden Beast Statue was of great importance to him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng knew that he had to prove his Divine Dao before he went to the Everest Spirit Mountain. Otherwise, he wouldn't be able to enter the Cloud Dragon Ravine.</p>

  <p>The mud at the bottom of the Golden Beast Statue was present in great amount, but he was not sure whether it was enough for him to smoothly condense his Godly Tile.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng gave the Golden Beast Statue one last glance and finally put it away.</p>

  <p>He knew that he still had to fight against the low-rank True Gods. If he made a breakthrough in his cultivation base and became a low-rank True God himself, he wouldn't be able to earn a great deal of points by fighting other low-rank True Gods. Therefore, he decided to absorb the mud after the rankings of the Floating Islands were determined.</p>

  <p>He had thirteen days before the rankings of the Floating Islands were to be decided.</p>

  <p>This led to an increase in the number of open battles in the Arena of Legends.</p>

  <p>The warriors who were fighting in the open battles were the consummate True Gods in the divine land. Their strength was second to that of the Holy Beings and the Demi-holy Beings on the various Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>The disciples of the wealthy clans on the Floating Islands were quite keen on watching the open battles, and the arena was jam-packed with spectators every time an open battle took place.</p>

  <p>Walton from the Tang Clan was successful in defeating Cora of the Zhou Clan.</p>

  <p>Shahn from the Fang Clan completely wiped out Malisa from the Li Clan.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was also quite keen on witnessing these open battles of the consummate True Gods. He had not missed a single battle till date.</p>

  <p>He knew that the big clans didn't always get along with each other, and now he had a general understanding of the grudges among those wealthy clans.</p>

  <p>The wealthy clans on the Floating Islands were divided into three factions.</p>

  <p>One of the three factions was made up of several powerful clans which were responsible for the destruction of the Luo Clan. These clans were led by the Dongfang Clan.</p>

  <p>Another faction consisted of clans which were neutral, like the Han Clan and the Li Clan. These clans were quite independent and didn't form an alliance with other powerful clans.</p>

  <p>However, Han Clan seemed to have allied with Leng Clan recently, and the engagement between Han Liusu and Langston confirmed the news.</p>

  <p>Yet to everyone's disbelief, Han Liusu and Langston fell out with each other.</p>

  <p>As for the Moon Clan and the Sword Clan, they were two powerful clans who were ranked second and third respectively. The warriors on these two Floating Islands came from the four divine trees.</p>

  <p>The divine land had four angles. There were four trees of great importance that stood at the four angles that supported the divine land.</p>

  <p>With the help of Sunset Tree, Ray Tree, Lofty Tree and Hidden Tree, many powerful warriors were born in the areas around these four divine trees. There were rumors that before the appearance of the Time Sea, the four great divine trees played host to strong warriors. As the Ruling Slate appeared, the strong warriors came to know the importance of rules.</p>

  <p>Thus, they established their own Floating Islands above the Time Sea, attracting warriors from all the directions in the divine land. This was how the Time Sea became the heart of the divine land.</p>

  <p>Much to everyone's surprise, the two consummate True Gods from the Gu Clan refrained from participating in the open battles this time.</p>

  <p>It was a fact that whenever the rankings of the Floating Islands were to be decided, the efforts of the Gu Clan's two consummate True Gods were quite commendable. The Gu Clan's Floating Island didn't have many disciples, due to which the Gu Clan's points were expected to be quite less than that of the rest of the powerful clans. However, Hallet's and Augustus' efforts were enough to rank the Gu Clan's Floating Island eighth in the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>People said that if Augustus and Hallet were on the Floating Island of some other wealthy clan, that clan would have been in the top three.</p>

  <p>However, Hallet and Augustus were nowhere to be seen this year. And the ranking of the Gu Clan was at risk of falling out of the top ten, if they decided not to fight in the Arena of Legends.</p>

  <p>Three days remained before the rankings of the Floating Islands were to be decided.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng finally entered the Jade Wall of Legends. While in his own room, he noticed that there were one hundred and ninety-five low-rank True Gods that had challenged him to battle.</p>

  <p>According to the rules of the Hall of True Gods, only the warriors who were ranked one to a hundred places higher or lower than Luo Luo Zheng could challenge him. Luo Luo Zheng was ranked 96th and only ninety-five warriors were ranked higher than him, and one hundred and ninety-five low-rank True Gods had offered to fight with him, which meant that everyone who was eligible to challenge Luo Luo Zheng did so.</p>
