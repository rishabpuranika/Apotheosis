  <p>
</p>

  <p>Vale left quickly because Mu Ning had arrived.</p>

  <p>In terms of strength, Vale was not scared of Mu Ning, but he had hesitated because of her identity and background.</p>

  <p>The others lifted Perrin from the ground and hurriedly followed Vale.</p>

  <p>"Why did you make such a promise to him?" asked Mu Ning as she leaped from the flying chariot and walked toward Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was obstinate when it came to matters pertaining to Yan. Hearing Aura's question, he thought for a moment before replying, "I don't want someone like Vale to get close to Yan."</p>

  <p>"Vale is not only Cloud Sect's outstanding disciple, valued by the entire sect, but also the only son of the Master of the noble Wang family. Is he very bad?" asked Mu Ning, puzzled.</p>

  <p>"Yes, very bad!" Luo Luo Zheng concluded without hesitating.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning smiled and said, "Maybe you're the only one who thinks he's bad.</p>

  <p>Vale is a desirable potential husband for all the unmarried girls in the Imperial Capital..."</p>

  <p>"He is too good for my sister. He can marry anyone he wants, but he shouldn't come near Yan!" stated Luo Luo Zheng coldly.</p>

  <p>Aura's heart skipped a beat when she looked at the serious expression on Luo Zheng's face. She had misunderstood Luo Luo Zheng. She had no idea that Luo Luo Zheng was Yan's brother, and that Luo Luo Zheng had worked so hard to earn points to save Yan from Hell Mountain.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's idea was naive, but Mu Ning still sighed. It was rare to see such love and devotion between siblings in a family. In her opinion, Luo Luo Zheng was too innocent and trustworthy when it came to matters about Yan.</p>

  <p>"Master Su, I'm going up the mountain top to see Yan," Luo Luo Zheng said as he turned toward the path that would take him to the top.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning quickly shook her head and said, "You can't see her."</p>

  <p>"Why?" Luo Zheng's eyebrows bristled like sharp swords. He had been told that he needed points to see someone imprisoned on Hell Mountain. And yet, Vale had said that Luo Luo Zheng was not eligible to visit Yan. And now, Master Su was stopping him.</p>

  <p>'Why? Why the hell? Now that I have entered Hell Mountain, why am I not allowed to see Yan?' he roared in his heart.</p>

  <p>"The people imprisoned on the top of Hell Mountain are not ordinary people. How can you be allowed to see her when you are only an outer disciple? A great array called the six-pointed star array has been set up on the top of the mountain to prevent the prisoners from escaping. You can't get past this great array using your strength. You need permission,"</p>

  <p>Mu Ning explained to him slowly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's face turned sour at the news shared by Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>Everything Luo Luo Zheng had done, from escaping the Luo Clan to entering Cloud Sect to hunting blade locusts, had been because he was driven to visit Yan. After the effort he had made and the challenges he had overcome, Luo Luo Zheng found it unacceptable that he couldn't see Yan.</p>

  <p>Determined, Luo Luo Zheng began walking up the mountain. But he had forgotten that his body was covered in wounds. Although the terrible gashes on his body had stopped bleeding, his movements tore some of them open. The sudden pain was so unbearable that Luo Luo Zheng turned pale and almost passed out.</p>

  <p>He fell to the ground with a thump.</p>

  <p>"Why do you have to do that?" Mu Ning said helplessly. Apparently, Luo Luo Zheng would not listen to her at all.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng lay on the ground and focused on his breathing before struggling to get back on his feet. He was desperate to reach the top of Hell Mountain.</p>

  <p>After his struggle, wounds that had not re-opened began to ooze blood as well.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Mu Ning shook her head and sighed. She stretched her hand, and three streaks of life vitality rolled over Luo Luo Zheng. Magically, he was transported onto the flying chariot. Then, Mu Ning jumped into the chariot.</p>

  <p>Before Luo Luo Zheng could protest, the flying chariot began its ascension toward the top of Hell Mountain.</p>

  <p>About a thousand feet from the mountaintop, a bright blue light suddenly lit up and enveloped the whole summit.</p>

  <p>"This is the six-pointed star array. We can't get past it," stated Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng struggled to his feet and began searching the summit with the hopes of catching a glimpse of his sister.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's hearing had become much sharper and his vision much wider since he entered the marrow refining level. However, the distance was too far to find Yan.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng was absorbed in searching for Yan, a brilliant light suddenly appeared on the right side of his line of sight.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng then fixed his eyes upon it.</p>

  <p>He saw a girl standing gracefully on the edge of a stone platform in the distance. She was burning her life vitality. The extremely dazzling light rose from her and formed a purple light column, which was even brighter than Vale's.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng narrowed his eyes as he tried to focus his vision on the young girl.</p>

  <p>From this considerable distance, he could make out her silhouette, but he couldn't see her features. Once his sight focused, even though the girl looked blurry, Luo Luo Zheng recognized her!</p>

  <p>She was Yan. His sister.</p>

  <p>They looked at each other for a long while. Even though they were too far apart, Luo Luo Zheng and Yan were at peace at the moment.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Luo Luo Zheng leaned forward and gestured to Yan.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning and the elder beside Yan were puzzled by the gesture. They didn't understand its meaning.</p>

  <p>But Yan smiled at it.</p>

  <p>She knew the meaning of his gesture and what he was trying to say to her.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had communicated that he would always protect her.</p>

  <p>Yan had seen this gesture many times when she was a child.</p>

  <p>She was more powerful than Luo Luo Zheng now.</p>

  <p>The girl, who had been delicate and fragile in the past, didn't need Luo Zheng's protection any longer.</p>

  <p>However, the gesture still filled her heart with warmth as it had done before. Now she felt safe...</p>

  <p>"We can go back now... " said Luo Luo Zheng. He seemed more relaxed than when Mu Ning had met him.</p>

  <p>"Don't you want to stay a little longer?" Mu Ning whispered.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng shook his head. "No," he said.</p>

  <p>With a smile, Mu Ning turned the direction of the flying chariot and flew down Hell Mountain.</p>

  <p>It wasn't until they had left Hell Mountain and Yan couldn't see him that Luo Luo Zheng collapsed on the chariot.</p>

  <p>The effort to stand and seek out his sister had used up all his strength.</p>

  <p>'What a tough guy!' Mu Ning thought. She curled her lips and said, "You're badly hurt."</p>

  <p>"It's not enough to kill me," said Luo Luo Zheng as he stared blankly at the star-filled sky. The sky was cloudless and surprisingly bright. Scattered stars formed a delicate Milky Way.</p>

  <p>"Fa-thud!"</p>

  <p>A blood-red pill fell on Luo Zheng's side and rolled down the deck to Luo Zheng's ear.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng reached over and picked up the pill. Then he took a deep breath when he realized what kind of pill it was. "Red all over, with five cloud stripes. If I'm reading this right, it's a five-grade pill, the Red Cloud Pill."</p>

  <p>"I thought you were blind," Mu Ning chuckled at Luo Zheng's remark.</p>

  <p>"Unexpectedly, you recognize it," teased Mu Ning, who was steering the flying chariot.</p>

  <p>"The five-grade Red Cloud Pill, after being swallowed, will immediately activate blood and build muscle. As long as the user is not dead, the wound, no matter how serious, will recover within an hour. It is also known as the holy potion. For a refiner, a Red Cloud Pill is equal to an extra life. It's invaluable! It costs about a thousand points in market prices. I can't afford it," Luo Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>"Take it. You can pay me for it later," Mu Ning laughed.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng shook his head and said, "I'm poor, and I have to collect many points... I'm afraid I can't pay you back."</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng spoke, Mu Ning suddenly turned around. Quick as lightning, she grabbed the Red Cloud Pill from Luo Zheng's hand and poked Luo Zheng's jaw with her finger. As Luo Luo Zheng opened his mouth reflexively, Mu Ning pushed the pill into his mouth.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry. My investment in you will pay off sooner or later. It will come back to me with a price more than the points for the pill. So, as your creditor, you had better listen to me!" stated Mu Ning in a severe tone of voice. A slight smile danced on her face, however. After that, she turned and continued to drive the flying chariot.</p>

  <p>Having consumed the Red Cloud Pill, Luo Luo Zheng felt as if there were a raging fire burning inside his stomach. Then a pleasant tingling sensation seeped from the gashes on his body.</p>

  <p>The five-grade pill was indeed exceedingly magical. Luo Zheng's severe injuries were now recovering at a remarkable rate.</p>

  <p>The intense effects quickly spread through Luo Zheng's entire body. Gradually, Luo Luo Zheng became drowsy, and sleep overcame him. Finally, he passed out.</p>

  <p>This was probably the best sleep Luo Luo Zheng had ever had in years.</p>

  <p>While imprisoned in the cellar of the Luo family, Luo Luo Zheng always woke up every morning before dawn to read.</p>

  <p>But today, when he woke up, he saw that the sun was already high in the sky.</p>

  <p>"What a long rest!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng said in surprise as he stretched and examined his body. The wounds from his battle with Vale on Hell Mountain the day before had healed now. The effect of Red Cloud Pill was truly extraordinary.</p>

  <p>He sprang to his feet. Feeling refreshed, Luo Luo Zheng found no reason to waste his time. He sat cross-legged and began to work his power according to the Heavenly Ogre Fist.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng had first left the library with the book, he had been determined to learn this cultivation method. However, no matter how much he practiced, Luo Luo Zheng had never succeeded. To his surprise, he practiced the cultivation method when he was forced by Vale yesterday.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng opened his eyes today, all he cared about was whether he could still refine the demonic life energy as he had done the previous day.</p>
