<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2268 An Open Battle </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The difference between the top two hundred warriors in the Arena of Legends wasn't that large.</p>

  <p>There were more than thirty rich clans on the Floating Islands and if each one possessed around five talents, then that would mean a total of 200 talents in the entirety of the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>At this stage, Luo Zheng's opponents were now as strong as Moore.</p>

  <p>He remembered his battle with him. If Luo Luo Zheng hadn't made use of the Ice Soul Flame, then he might've lost that fight.</p>

  <p>In order to face off against the top two hundred low-rank True Gods, Luo Luo Zheng would have to make use of the Gods Killing Sword Array if he wanted to ensure his victory.</p>

  <p>There was still a month and a half before the re-ranking of the Floating Islands and so far, Luo Luo Zheng had won twenty-two consecutive times and owned three hundred and seventy thousand points. He wasn't as anxious as he was before and only needed to wait for the last period to win a few more crucial matches.</p>

  <p>With this strategy, even if others were to discover that he was from the Han Clan, it would be too late to attack him. This was all well-thought-out by Joy.</p>

  <p>However, his sudden departure from the Hall of True Gods left the other talents feeling quite anxious.</p>

  <p>Even Han Liusu was upset.</p>

  <p>The young woman was under a lot of pressure mostly due to the conflict between her and Langston.</p>

  <p>Their relationship at the moment was less than ideal but she had to consider the overall situation as a member of the Han Clan. Sometimes, the disciples of the rich clans on the Floating Islands ended up being more helpless than ordinary people.</p>

  <p>Han Liusu was ranked third among all low-rank True Gods. However she found it difficult to win consecutively and even if she did, she could only get around one thousand points. Such a meagre amount wouldn't be able to change their current situation.</p>

  <p>During this time, Pascal spent his days persevering in the Arena of Legends and participating in battles above his level. He challenged a top-rank True God and found it quite challenging given his cultivation of a mid-rank True God.</p>

  <p>After three consecutive wins, he was then defeated three consecutive times by other warriors. The top-rank True Gods still had the advantage of flight, which made Pascal suffer while he was fighting with them.</p>

  <p>Even without saying anything, Han Liusu knew that he did it all for her.</p>

  <p>Pascal didn't want to obey the Leng Clan either. He wanted to help her with his own strength. Unfortunately, he might be far too weak to do so.</p>

  <p>However, Han Liusu still had a chance.</p>

  <p>Just recently, an anonymous warrior appeared within the Hall of True Gods and participated in the battles above his level. That warrior won all 22 consecutive fights he took part in and gathered more than 300, 000 points.</p>

  <p>After seven or eight more rounds, there was no doubt that his points would reach all the way to a million.</p>

  <p>If Han Liusu could defeat that anonymous man and take away 90% of his points, she could have as many points as that of a consummate True God.</p>

  <p>Taking into account the number of people in the Floating Islands, such a feat could help the Han Clan move up one or two places.</p>

  <p>Everyone, including Han Liusu, expected the anonymous man to win.</p>

  <p>However, five days passed and his ranking remained at 96. He no longer participated in any battles which greatly discouraged Han Liusu.</p>

  <p>She would enter the Jade Wall of Legends almost everyday, wandering around the anonymous man's door.</p>

  <p>It wasn't just her. Ling Shuang Mu and Pearl Dongfang, ranked first and second respectively, also waited. Sebastian Zhao, ranked 196th, was also waiting. Everyone who had the qualifications to challenge the anonymous low-rank True God all waited and hoped for a miracle to contribute to their noble clans.</p>

  <p>"Is the anonymous man afraid? He hasn't shown up in the Hall of True Gods for five consecutive days."</p>

  <p>"He was one of the top 1, 000 warriors in the beginning and he is now ranked 96th. No matter which clan he came from, his 22 consecutive wins and 300, 000 cumulative points could get him everything he could ever possibly want!"</p>

  <p>"I guess he knows he isn't that powerful, so he's stopped fighting after getting so many points. I don't think we'll be able to challenge him at this rate. We don't have the time to come here every day. Let's just leave."</p>

  <p>The speaker persuaded but, contrary to his words, he stayed. Somewhere deep down, he also hoped that the anonymous man would open the door of his room.</p>

  <p>"Have you received any latest news on the anonymous man?" Han Liusu asked Marcus Han when she saw him.</p>

  <p>Marcus Han was ranked 130th. He was a highly gifted warrior of the Han Clan but Han Liusu remained high above him in terms of status and power. He nodded respectfully before answering her question. "There's been no news, Your Highness. However, Moore seems to know something but doesn't want to reveal it!"</p>

  <p>Moore was the strongest warrior the anonymous man had encountered so far.</p>

  <p>A weaker, low-rank True God might not be able to bring out the anonymous man's real strength, but Moore could.</p>

  <p>"The warriors of the Moon Clan are unkind and mean. The rankings of the Floating Islands have nothing to do with them but Moore still refuses to tell us anything!" one of the talents from another rich clan whined.</p>

  <p>Even Han Liusu had to sigh. Sometimes, she even doubted whether Luo Luo Zheng might be the anonymous man.</p>

  <p>That young man had shown quite a remarkable strength. He was able to kill Sheridan who was ranked 40th at the time. Despite his victory having something to do with his luck, his performance was still amazing.</p>

  <p>It was definitely possible for him to make it by means of his own strength.</p>

  <p>She had sent a few friends to the Purple Soul Hall to inquire about Luo Luo Zheng, but all they told her was that the young man was concentrating on cultivating himself under Joy's tutelage.</p>

  <p>Han Liusu wanted to go to the Purple Soul Hall herself to see how Luo Luo Zheng truly was doing, but he stayed in Joy's palace all the time. She hadn't forgotten Joy's mocking remarks and dared not go to the Purple Soul Hall anymore.</p>

  <p>It would be great if Luo Luo Zheng was the anonymous man. If he was, then the Han Clan's Floating Island would gain an exorbitant amount of points.</p>

  <p>However, there was still a chance that it wasn't Luo Luo Zheng. There were so many rich clans on the Floating Islands and it was possible for them to also house an amazingly talented warrior.</p>

  <p>"I'm getting quite bored waiting for this anonymous man. How about I challenge you, Han Liusu?" a frivolous voice shouted over the crowd.</p>

  <p>Han Liusu raised her head and saw that it was Quentin of the Qin Clan.</p>

  <p>He was a core disciple of his clan and the heir of the Holy Emperor. If he hadn't used the Wishing Spell in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, then he would have most probably been in the top ten by now.</p>

  <p>The Holy Emperor of the Qin Clan helped Quentin suppress the effects of the Great Wishing Spell and become a low-rank True God. However, the impact on his body was still great. His talent was greatly limited. He was very powerful but he was still only ranked 21st.</p>

  <p>Quentin held a grudge against Han Liusu since it was her who brought Luo Luo Zheng into the Skyland race and made him suffer such a huge loss.</p>

  <p>"I'm not interested," she replied coldly.</p>

  <p>"You don't want to accept my challenge, Your Highness?" he asked, almost mockingly. "I heard there's something wrong between you and Langston."</p>

  <p>Gossip in the clans always spread like wildfire. Quentin was not close to nor had a friendly relationship with Langston, but he still knew about the matter between him and his fiancee. "It was said that a proving godly warrior emerged from your clan and killed Sheridan. I'm wondering if this proving godly warrior is the anonymous man. His name is Tianxing, right?"</p>

  <p>It wasn't just Han Liusu who had her suspicions of Luo Luo Zheng being the anonymous man.</p>

  <p>Many warriors saw Luo Luo Zheng kill Sheridan and hurt Langston after all. His strength wasn't really a kept secret.</p>

  <p>Since he had the capacity to kill Sheridan, then he most certainly had the qualifications to participate in battles against those with a higher cultivation base than him.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng's name was never on the ranking list. He just directly participated in the battle anonymously. There were little to no clues offered to mere spectators. Even Quentin could only make his guesses.</p>

  <p>"It's possible but I've already sent people to inquire about this matter.</p>

  <p>Tianxing seems to be focused on learning the Purple Mu Ning Godly Way from the Demi-holy Being of our Han Clan," Han Liusu replied. She wasn't really sure about the current situation, but since she didn't have anything to hide, then there was no need to lie.</p>

  <p>"I see!" Quentin replied indifferently. He too was only speculating.</p>

  <p>At that moment, a majestic voice suddenly boomed in the Hall of True Gods. "Harold Yu from the Luo Clan is challenging Rachelle Mu from the Mu Clan. Low-rank True Gods can pay 40 points to watch the open battle on-site..."</p>
