<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Seeing that Sword Chen didn't understand, the woman commented casually,</p>

  <p>"We have been neighbors for so many years. This is the first time we have seen each other..."</p>

  <p>"Neighbors? Do you also live in the Sea of Meditation? Are you one of the Devils?" Sword Chen asked, staring at the woman totally dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>He was of the opinion that only those Devils could control the force of primitive fear.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, the woman smiled faintly. "Those Devils... are controlled by me!"</p>

  <p>Saying so, she waved her hand.</p>

  <p>The areas where the firelight couldn't reach were submerged in the dark mist. The Devils who were wandering in this dark mist immediately responded to her.</p>

  <p>"Aoo... Aoo!"</p>

  <p>The Devils cried like babies.</p>

  <p>Sword Chen looked at the woman differently now. He asked seriously, "So, you are the master of the Sea of Meditation?"</p>

  <p>"The master of the Sea of Meditation?" she repeated. She bowed her head, pondered for a while, and said lightly, "Sort of I guess."</p>

  <p>She did not pay attention to the surprised look on Sword Chen's face, and gently floated over to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Sword Chen had already completed his mission according to her.</p>

  <p>He had contributed greatly. She had already figured out the way through numerous experiments. This time, she was determined to succeed!</p>

  <p>And after that, the most important thing to deal with was Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Why did you clone these Holy Beings?" Luo Zheng asked as he stared at the woman who was gliding towards him.</p>

  <p>"Because they have immeasurable strength!" the woman remarked as she reached out to stroke Luo Zheng's face with her hand.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng's body subconsciously leaned backwards gently and avoided her touch.</p>

  <p>Surprisingly, the woman did not get annoyed. As Luo Zheng's phantom walked over, she sat on his shoulder and said, "Now the Holy Beings who have invaded the Abyss Demon Region are trying to control that supreme treasure of belief. If they succeed in doing so, the Abyss Demon Region will be under their control."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng frowned slightly when he heard this.</p>

  <p>Since Nicholas had stepped into the Abyss Demon Region, he was naturally prepared for this.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's current strength level made it difficult for him to stop them.</p>

  <p>"So you will allow them to take control?" Luo Zheng asked in shock.</p>

  <p>His gaze was fixed on the Holy Beings' clones.</p>

  <p>The auras exuded by so many Holy Beings' clones standing together were extraordinary.</p>

  <p>If this woman could stop Nicholas and his group with her extraordinary abilities, then it would be fantastic!</p>

  <p>"Of course I won't," spat the woman with her eyes glinting fiercely. "The True Demon Body will always belong to me. These Holy Beings? They will all die here! It is a pity that they will still be reborn in the universes.</p>

  <p>However, sooner or later, I aim to destroy the universes of these Holy Beings!"</p>

  <p>She did not only want to destroy the Holy Beings and their universes. What was more, she couldn't tolerate any of the divine citizens or True Gods in the divine land either!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and Sword Chen exchanged a meaningful look when they heard this woman's words.</p>

  <p>"So what are you going to do?" Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>"Just...follow me." the woman restrained the fierce look in her eyes and tried to smile faintly at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"It seems that I have no choice, isn't it?" Luo Zheng asked again.</p>

  <p>"Of course you don't have a choice!" the woman answered firmly.</p>

  <p>Fleeing from this woman was not a possibility for Luo Zheng and Sword Chen.</p>

  <p>Moreover, there were so many clones of Holy Beings with her!</p>

  <p>At the bottom of the ice palace...</p>

  <p>As they steadily approached the ice coffin, the chill became stronger and stronger.</p>

  <p>But at this point they could still withstand the cold temperature.</p>

  <p>Everyone stared at the ice coffin cautiously. They felt no soul energy from the girl sleeping in it, but the Holy Beings, whose senses were sharper, realized that something strange was happening in the ice coffin.</p>

  <p>"Stop!"</p>

  <p>Nicholas stopped when he was about sixty feet away from the ice coffin.</p>

  <p>All the other Holy Beings also hovered in the air cautiously.</p>

  <p>"We have to find a way to open this coffin!"</p>

  <p>"It won't be that easy. Do you think that woman is really so kind as to leave it to us?"</p>

  <p>"But we can't waste time just standing around watching it without trying anything."</p>

  <p>Some of the Demi-holy Beings and consummate True Gods discussed various possibilities with each other while keeping an eye at the ice coffin.</p>

  <p>Nicholas slowly closed his eyes, and then transformed his spiritual sense into a silk thread, and made it sweep across the ice coffin.</p>

  <p>They didn't believe that everything would be so simple that all they had to do was just easily open the ice coffin and get the True Demon Body. Who knew what would pop out of the damned coffin?</p>

  <p>When his spiritual sense spread across the coffin, his eyes suddenly flashed.</p>

  <p>"What did you find?" Murphy, who was beside him, asked.</p>

  <p>"Try to have a look yourself," said Nicholas, pointing at the transparent coffin.</p>

  <p>Murphy then released his own spiritual sense too...</p>

  <p>Not long after, he spoke with a strange expression, "This transparent coffin doesn't seem to exist at all!"</p>

  <p>"It's just an illusory projection. The space under the coffin is a void,"</p>

  <p>Nicholas said with a frown.</p>

  <p>"It reminds me of the jade seal that Luo Zheng had taken," said Zeke suddenly.</p>

  <p>"The jade seal is connected to a passage."</p>

  <p>"Exactly! Maybe there's another world beneath this transparent coffin!"</p>

  <p>"??"</p>

  <p>Behind the Holy Beings, Rachelle, Shahn and the others recalled their encounters with the jade seal.</p>

  <p>They remembered that they were so close to getting the jade seal, but strangely, somehow it fell into Luo Zheng's hands in the end. Even now when they thought of it, they were still unwilling to accept that fact.</p>

  <p>After observing it for a while, Nicholas approached the ice coffin once more.</p>

  <p>The closer he got to the ice coffin, the stranger he felt about the little girl lying in it!</p>

  <p>When the ice coffin was only a few feet away from him, Nicholas suddenly reached out towards the ice coffin.</p>

  <p>Buzz.</p>

  <p>Just as he expected, the surface of the ice coffin was rippling like water. He had not touched anything substantial. There was nothing there. It was truly a lifelike projection.</p>

  <p>However, a faint power of space came from below the illusory ice coffin.</p>

  <p>Nicholas continued to explore but suddenly the little girl in the ice coffin opened her eyes. Her little face was full of anger.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>A burst of cold air circled the ice coffin. The chill could be felt deep in the bones now. Then, Nicholas suddenly disappeared in front of everyone's eyes.</p>

  <p>The other Holy Beings were shell-shocked, especially the two Demi-holy Beings of the Dongfang Clan and Troy along with the others. They immediately rushed to the ice coffin.</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!</p>

  <p>The moment they rushed to the ice coffin, they, too, disappeared in front of everyone.</p>

  <p>"Let's go, too!"</p>

  <p>Clark said and rushed toward the ice coffin too.</p>

  <p>They were not sure whether there was any danger under the ice coffin, but since they had already reached this stage, and Nicholas had entered it too, no one wanted to retreat.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings from various rich clans on the Floating Islands led their own clans' Demi-holy Beings and consummate True Gods in.</p>

  <p>Not long after the alliance of the rich clans on the Floating Islands entered...</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, Sword Chen, that woman and the many clones she controlled also arrived at the bottom of the ice palace.</p>

  <p>The woman's eyes lightly swept over the girl in the ice coffin, and her face revealed a cold smile. "As they broke in without placating the True Demon Body, these Holy Beings are going to have a hard time!"</p>
