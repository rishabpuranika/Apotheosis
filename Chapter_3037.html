<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3037 An Unpleasant Meeting </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Several days had passed.</p>

  <p>Upon their release from the small world, the disciples of the cultivation palaces found themselves in a vast, empty square. However, Winchell and Goran did not appear.</p>

  <p>A beautiful, majestic mountain gate stood at the end of the square. The colossal gate had a huge plaque in its center, engraved with ornate lettering:</p>

  <p>"Origin Mountain". The design evoked sword intent.</p>

  <p>Everyone gazed at the gate for a moment, and then looked up. There was something blocking the view of the sky above the gate. It looked like a large, dark brown curtain.</p>

  <p>"What kind of place is this Origin Mountain?"</p>

  <p>"It isn't the Taiyi Heaven Palace, is it?'</p>

  <p>"What the hell is that curtain? It's blocking the stars!"</p>

  <p>Everyone in the group was confused by the curtain, including Beldene, Kenelm, and even Luo Zheng. They had no idea what it was.</p>

  <p>"That's not a curtain... That's the Origin Mountain itself! It is so high, so massive, that when one stands at the foot of the mountain, it seems like a curtain covering the sky," said someone behind them. The speaker had a pleasant, calm voice.</p>

  <p>Everyone turned around when they heard these words. A feeling of excitement came over them as they saw who was approaching them.</p>

  <p>Three beautiful women walked slowly and gracefully towards them. They were accompanied by a young man who looked to be young, and a few guards.</p>

  <p>The Sword Light Palace had occupied the Seven-Star Province for many years. Although it was a relatively small force, the palace was known to hold many lovely women. Surely, however, they could not all be winsome and charming as the women who now came towards them.</p>

  <p>The girl in the lead had fair skin and flowing hair, and wore a gauze dress in sky blue. She had a faint smile on her pretty face. She seemed to be very young.</p>

  <p>Despite her air of elegance and gentleness, there was a faint aura of sword intent around her. It was clear that she cultivated the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent.</p>

  <p>The two other women looked just as lovely, and slightly older. Their cultivation base could not be seen through at all. It was obvious that they were Other Shore Realm warriors, known for their power. The disciples did not dare to look directly at these two women, and kept their eyes focused on the youngest girl.</p>

  <p>"Which of you is Luo Zheng?" asked one of the women directly.</p>

  <p>The girl's faint smile lingered. "Aunt Daisy, don't be in such a hurry. See, I think I can guess, let me try..." she said softly.</p>

  <p>She moved closer to the disciples as she spoke, her gaze sweeping across every person in the group. In an instant, she had fixed her lovely eyes on Luo Zheng, and she strolled towards him. She tilted her head, studying him curiously.</p>

  <p>In the Sea of Truth, they could not have seen each other clearly. Thus, this was the first time they had met truly, and seen each other's appearance.</p>

  <p>"There's no need to guess. The cultivation base of my companions is not high enough. Only I crossed the second line. My truth aura alone would be enough for you to recognize me," said Luo Zheng. He spoke to her with a familiar tone, as though they were friends.</p>

  <p>The woman named Daisy quickly walked up to them. To the girl she said,</p>

  <p>"Is this Luo Zheng?" Dorothy nodded, smiling slightly. Daisy faced Luo Zheng. "Can you save my son from the whirlpool?"</p>

  <p>Evaristus, who stood beside Daisy, looked at Luo Zheng expectantly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng frowned. However, he recognized that the woman was anxious to save her son, so he nodded. "Yes."</p>

  <p>A flash of relief appeared in Daisy's eyes. She couldn't help but hope that Luo Zheng would indeed be able to do as he said. "Good. Then you must stay. But the rest of them can be sent away."</p>

  <p>At her words, the guards came forward and surrounded the disciples, clearly intending to escort them away.</p>

  <p>The disciples, including Elgin, Beldene, and Kenelm, were unable to hide their disappointment. Although they did not know where or what exactly this place was, they were eager to understand, and they did not wish to be driven away.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng watched the guards, his face darkening. He said, "These people are my companions, and I wish them to stay with me. If you want them to go, then I must leave with them."</p>

  <p>Daisy raised her eyebrows at Luo Zheng. Her tone was displeased. "My husband saved your life. You have just vowed to save my son. Do you think we would allow you to walk away from Origin Mountain?"</p>

  <p>There was a threatening note in Daisy's voice, and her aura shifted, becoming darker and more imposing.</p>

  <p>"I promised to save your son. But I did not set a timeline for saving him.</p>

  <p>You might have noticed that I have just passed the second line, and I have heard from Dora that your son is trapped in the sixth line. When I get that far, then I will save your son. Until then, farewell." With that pronouncement, Luo Zheng turned and gestured to his companions, ready to leave.</p>

  <p>The disciples looked unhappy, especially Elgin and Beldene. However, they followed Luo Zheng without hesitation.</p>

  <p>After all, as elite disciples of the Sword Light Palace, they were confident and accustomed to authority. In this territory, they had to submit to the rule of others, and that was a role unfamiliar and unwelcome to them.</p>

  <p>Daisy called for them to stop, and Luo Zheng and the others turned to face her. In a proud voice, she said, "The Origin Mountain can help you. What you gain here will help you pass the sixth line easily. Moreover, upon saving my son, you will be given the greatest of rewards. Leaving the Origin Mountain now will bring you nothing but regret."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked straight into her eyes. "I agreed to save your son only because Winchell saved my life. I don't care about the reward. And I will find my own way to pass the sixth line. So don't worry that I'll regret anything!"</p>

  <p>This time, when he walked away, he did not look back.</p>

  <p>"Aunt Daisy! Hey, Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>Dorothy shouted at both Daisy and Luo Zheng, a bit surprised at the sudden turn of events.</p>

  <p>"Mother, please,"</p>

  <p>Evaristus said. He scowled at his mother. His expression said clearly that he thought Daisy was in the wrong, and had acted too aggressively.</p>

  <p>The third woman, Felicity, finally spoke. "Winchell saved him, Daisy, and now you have been unkind and driven him away. Is this what you want?"</p>

  <p>"Let him go! He will realize soon enough the value of Origin Mountain, and then he will return," said Daisy stubbornly.</p>

  <p>"He is my friend!" Dorothy said, sounding equally stubborn. She shot Daisy a sharp glance and ran after the departing disciples.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and his companions reached the edge of the square. Before them, the cliff sloped steeply downwards, with at least ten winding mountain roads extending down the cliff.</p>

  <p>They would not need the roads. The cultivation base of the disciples was sufficient for them to just fly down the slope.</p>

  <p>Before they could leave, Dorothy caught up with them. She rushed towards Luo Zheng, holding out a hand in entreaty. "Luo Zheng, please do not take my aunt's words to heart. She is very anxious to save her son."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded. "I know."</p>

  <p>"Despite her harshness, some of the things she said are right. It is much better for you to stay here in the Origin Mountain," Dorothy said.</p>

  <p>"Are you saying that I won't be able to pass through the Sea of Truth if I don't rely on the Origin Mountain?" Luo Zheng asked, staring at Dorothy.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng does not need the Origin Mountain. He can cross the Sea of Truth without it. He is a superior talent, and he is capable of Instant Enlightenment. On his first try, he succeeded in cultivating the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent! And even Master Qiu Yinhe has invited him to enter the Taiyi Heaven Palace."</p>

  <p>"Yes, all that is true! We see that the Origin Mountain seems extraordinary, but is it more powerful than the Taiyi Heaven Palace?"</p>

  <p>In response to Dorothy, a couple of the disciples had spoken up, eager to defend Luo Zheng and talk of his prowess.</p>

  <p>Dorothy listened, looking stunned. "Instant enlightenment... Luo Zheng, is this true? You achieved that?"</p>

  <p>She realized that Luo Zheng had used the Truth of Cultivation Nature to enter the Sea of Truth before. And this time, he had instantly grasped the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent. It occurred to her that if all this was accurate, then he was far more powerful than she had thought.</p>

  <p>The Origin Mountain had no hold on him if he was capable of all these things. Indeed, even the very leaders of the Origin Mountain would be quick to welcome such a talented and outstanding man into their group.</p>

  <p>Given his stature, Dorothy no longer knew how to persuade him to stay.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng gazed at her with a faint smile. "It's better for us to meet in the Sea of Truth."</p>

  <p>With that, he leaped lightly into the air, and soared down the mountain. The disciples followed his lead. In a moment, they had vanished from sight, leaving Dorothy standing alone at the edge of the cliff.</p>
