<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4034 Powerful Weapons </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Blood spurted out from Darby's chest as if a rain of blood had fallen. His entire arm was torn apart, exposing a terrible wound.</p>

  <p>"Darby!" Stella's voice trembled at the scene. She didn't expect that the three members of the Bone Blade race would be this powerful. "Heal yourself quickly! I'll guard you for as long as I can."</p>

  <p>Saying this, she drew out a second sword.</p>

  <p>She only used the first one to deal with the Treacherous Beings, while the second one was actually her personal weapon.</p>

  <p>Although she was determined to fight until death, she was still trembling in fear.</p>

  <p>Darby calmly said, "Don't move."</p>

  <p>"What? What do you mean?" Stella was panicking so she could just ask in confusion.</p>

  <p>"Just do it! Hurry up and hide behind me! We don't have much time!"</p>

  <p>Darby ordered loudly as he saw that Stella was out of it.</p>

  <p>Seeing Darby's serious face, she immediately did as she was told, even though she didn't understand what was going on.</p>

  <p>Darby immediately stretched out his hand. Suddenly, three items emerged on his palm.</p>

  <p>There were a green rune, a yellow rune, and a sheet of transparent glazed glass.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Darby quickly threw the yellow rune at their feet. Then, as the rune spread out, butterfly-shaped shields emerged from it.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The shields grew and covered them tightly.</p>

  <p>Crash! Bang!</p>

  <p>Just when they put up the shields, the members of the Bone Blade race launched another barrage of powerful attacks.</p>

  <p>Their speed and strength were completely terrifying. They would be in extreme danger if Darby hadn't put up the shields in the nick of time.</p>

  <p>Even the umbrella from before couldn't block their all-out attack.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the densely-packed butterfly-shaped shields were able to resist them, buying Darby a few seconds to prepare for his next plan.</p>

  <p>The yellow rune was a life-saving treasure for Darby. He had over a thousand treasures with him, and this one would certainly belong to the top three in terms of value and capability. Though he was hesitant to use it at first, he had no other choice if he wanted to save their lives.</p>

  <p>Then, Darby used the green rune and attached it to his wound. With a flash of green light, the wound healed rapidly, and his torn arm regenerated.</p>

  <p>Now, their only problem was the powerful foes that were still attacking them.</p>

  <p>As he completely recovered, Darby raised the glass in his hand. Upon a closer look, the glass was divided into two layers, and there was a strange creature in it. The creature had an odd shape as if it had been crushed and turned into a specimen.</p>

  <p>"Master doesn't want me to tell you about it," Darby finally spoke.</p>

  <p>"About what?" Stella asked. Crack!</p>

  <p>Darby broke the glass by his bare hands.</p>

  <p>Then, the creature contained in it immediately surfaced.</p>

  <p>It was like fluid in form, but it returned to its original shape in no time. It turned out to be a Treacherous Being!</p>

  <p>"There are so many things in this world that are being controlled by Treacherous Beings," Darby said in a soft voice. Then, the Treacherous Being suddenly drilled into his eyes, ears, mouth, and nose. Afterward, a faint shadow appeared on the surface of his body.</p>

  <p>Three milky white claws, as sharp as sickles, slowly grew on his arm, while a chain formed in his other hand.</p>

  <p>"The Treacherous Beings' power is considered to be the strongest power,"</p>

  <p>Darby said sadly. "But sooner or later, the ones who borrow their power would inevitably become their slaves."</p>

  <p>This was the warning that their master told them as he bestowed the Treacherous Beings.</p>

  <p>Darby raised his right hand, and the chain drew a visible arc in the air. The claws on his arm spun viciously under the pulling of the chain.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The three members of the Bone Blade race quickly reacted and retreated. At the same time, the monkeys surrounded them.</p>

  <p>The power and speed that were granted to Darby left Stella stunned.</p>

  <p>She only saw Darby's figure flash before her eyes, and then the huge claws spun at incredible speed, creating several irregular arcs in the air. The arcs drove away the monkeys and caught up with the three members of the Bone Blade race in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>They successfully hit their targets.</p>

  <p>Crash! Splat!</p>

  <p>The bodies of the three members were instantly cut in half.</p>

  <p>Soon after, the Treacherous Beings hidden in their bodies had come out.</p>

  <p>These three Treacherous Beings were very similar to the monkeys, but they were a bit larger in size.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>As Darby returned to Stella's side, the claws and chain quickly retracted back into his body. Then, he took out the long stick embedded with the Light of Annihilation and said, "Stella, you can make your move now."</p>

  <p>Stella was still recovering from shock after witnessing all of this. As Darby spoke beside her, she came to her senses. She waved her long sword and rushed towards the monkeys.</p>

  <p>Because the Light of Annihilation was fatal to the monkeys, they were all easily killed.</p>

  <p>The three Treacherous Beings that escaped from the bodies of the three members of the Bone Blade race were also killed.</p>

  <p>After a narrow escape from absolute death, Stella stared at Darby and took the opportunity to ask, "Where did you acquire the Treacherous Being?"</p>

  <p>Darby fell silent for a while before he decided to start talking. He didn't intend to hide anything from Stella, so he told her everything he knew.</p>

  <p>In the entire Three Purities Stage, the Treacherous Beings were, without a doubt, the most terrifying creatures.</p>

  <p>However, the Nihility race and the Element Spirit Civilization knew they were afraid of the Light of Annihilation. To avoid the Light of Annihilation, they had to sneak into the bodies of other creatures.</p>

  <p>Campbell was even able to use the Light of Annihilation to deal with the other Treacherous Beings after he possessed Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng was possessed passively.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Darby took the initiative to be possessed. He used the Treacherous Being as a weapon.</p>

  <p>Although Maynard had got the Light of Annihilation from his master a few years ago, he was still unsatisfied.</p>

  <p>Indeed, the Light of Annihilation could deal with the ordinary Treacherous Beings, but when it came to the truly powerful ones, it would not be enough.</p>

  <p>Moreover, it was more difficult to deal with the Treacherous Beings that possessed powerful warriors.</p>

  <p>"But it means that you'll become a walking corpse if you are possessed by a Treacherous Being, right?" Stella asked, knowing how the process usually worked.</p>

  <p>Darby smiled and said, "While that is true for most cases, not all Treacherous Beings will take total control of one's body. Some of them are friendly, and will even help you defeat your enemies. That's the friendly type of Treacherous Beings. They can become our most powerful weapons."</p>

  <p>As Darby spoke, he took out two pieces of glazed glass. Then, immediately after, the Treacherous Being that was attached to his body got out from his eyes, ears, mouth, and nose, and returned to the glass.</p>

  <p>Right there and then, Stella was able to see the Treacherous Being's form through the glass. From it, she could clearly see the claws and chain that Darby had used earlier.</p>

  <p>"Use the Treacherous Beings as weapons, huh?" Stella muttered to herself.</p>

  <p>It still seemed kind of unbelievable to her.</p>

  <p>But what frustrated her was the fact that her master and brothers had hidden this fact from her and her sisters.</p>

  <p>"Then, why did you hide it from me?" Stella asked Darby with disappointed eyes.</p>

  <p>"Our master didn't tell us anything at the beginning either," Darby said as he shook his head. "After being able to kill a follower of the Element Spirit Civilization, Maynard got a hold of this secret from him. Then, Maynard approached our master and tried to confirm this matter."</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven was famous for his bloodlust, but he favored his disciples very much. Maynard pestered him until he got his consent to use the Treacherous Beings.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean? Our master deliberately hid this secret from us? Why would he do that?" Stella asked as her brows furrowed.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he did," Darby replied as he stared at Stella seriously. "But he did it for our own sake. As I've said, not all Treacherous Beings will be willing to cooperate with you. If we control them for a long time, there would be consequences. Possessing others is their way to regain their consciousness.</p>

  <p>Therefore, our master didn't really want us to resort to this method. He would rather pass this method to Phelps and Ewing than teach us."</p>
