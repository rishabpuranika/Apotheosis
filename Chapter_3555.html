  <p>
</p>

  <p>The javelin whistled through the air.</p>

  <p>Whoosh...</p>

  <p>The stage ruler was caught off guard, and the javelin sank into his forehead.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had thrown the javelin with a lot of force. If it had managed to pierce the stage ruler's skull, it would've shattered his head.</p>

  <p>However, this was not the case. Such a powerful strike even failed to pierce through his skin. Only the tip of the javelin had hit him.</p>

  <p>"Swish!"</p>

  <p>Even though his forehead had been struck, the stage ruler fiercely swiped at Luo Zheng who was still floating in the air with a claw. Luo Zheng didn't have the time to dodge.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was smashed into the marsh, ripples waving from where he had landed.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge's face fell as she saw what happened. Before she could take a step towards Luo Zheng, the stage ruler's other claw was reaching for her. "I've stayed on Stage Fourteen for a long time," the stage ruler's voice boomed. "I've tasted almost all the creatures here, but the most delicious is still the Dark Nether Bugs. But, I think you will taste just as good..."</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>The huge claw encircled Feng Ge in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>However, she was quick on her feet. Immediately, she somersaulted backwards, narrowly avoiding his clutches.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh...</p>

  <p>The stage ruler's sharp claw kept swiping towards Feng Ge. She continued to move nimbly on the black marsh, dodging the claw like a dragonfly skimming on the surface of a pond.</p>

  <p>Actually, it had been extremely dangerous while she was retreating to evade his attacks.</p>

  <p>After she had become a purified being, she had made great progress relying on this physical body. Back when she was on Stage Thirteen, she could easily unleash a power of more than three thousand Jun, which surpassed even Luo Zheng's strength.</p>

  <p>Now that she had entered Stage Fourteen, her physical body was definitely not considered weak, but her opponent was the ruler of Stage Fourteen who had numerous years of experience. The difference in strength was painfully obvious.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Phew!</p>

  <p>As she retreated, her body kept transforming into different shapes to evade the claw which was only inches away from her.</p>

  <p>"Let me see how long you can keep this up!"</p>

  <p>The eyes of the stage ruler revealed a trace of excitement.</p>

  <p>As the ruler of Stage Fourteen, he had been standing at the top of this stage for too long.</p>

  <p>In the entire Stage Fourteen. there seemed to be nothing worth his attention.</p>

  <p>Now that he finally met someone powerful enough, naturally, he felt somewhat of a thrill.</p>

  <p>As he rushed forward, he reached out his two claws. As the two claws intersected, colorful lights pierced through the darkness.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge clenched her teeth and continued to dart from left to right in the shadows.</p>

  <p>"Puff..."</p>

  <p>A sharp claw swiped at her chest, slicing through her flesh. A deep gash appeared under her clavicle, a wound so deep that one could see her bones.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge winced and was about to leap to the other side, but the stage ruler had already guessed her next move and yanked at her before she could even try.</p>

  <p>"I'm done for..."</p>

  <p>Her heart sank. She suddenly realized that her journey on the Other Shore would come to an end.</p>

  <p>Yet somehow, even in the face of death, she felt no regret.</p>

  <p>Ever since she entered Stage Thirteen, until now, she had gotten to know herself better.</p>

  <p>But if she died, then, Luo Zheng...</p>

  <p>Before she could even finish the thought, she realized the sharp claw that was reaching for her abruptly stopped a few inches from her face.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge blinked confusedly, it was as though time had stopped.</p>

  <p>Not only did the stage ruler's claw not move forward, it actually seemed to be slowly moving backward. Turning to look at the stage ruler's face, Feng Ge was surprised to see an intensely angry expression.</p>

  <p>As the massive claw retreated inch by inch, the stage ruler let out a deep roar.</p>

  <p>Only then did Feng Ge notice that Luo Zheng was holding the tail of the stage ruler tightly, dragging the huge lizard backwards!</p>

  <p>"Damn human!" the stage ruler roared and gave up chasing Feng Ge. Turning around furiously, he pounced on Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>As the mud splashed, Luo Zheng was thrown under the stage ruler.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>Yan screamed from the back of the big lizard, but she could do nothing as she was still trapped inside the array.</p>

  <p>As Feng Ge watched this scene, she gradually regained her senses. This whole time, she had been evading the stage ruler; however, upon seeing Luo Zheng in trouble, she was enraged. Planting her foot into the mud, she suddenly launched herself into the air, rushing towards the huge lizard.</p>

  <p>But before she could even get close, the stage ruler's tail swept an arc in the air.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The stage ruler's tail alone was enough to land a blow with four thousand Jun of force.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge collided right into the tail, and was smashed into the ground. Letting out a muffled groan, she tasted a fishy, bittersweet taste well up from her throat. Dazed, she lay in the ground motionless for a moment.</p>

  <p>Ignoring Feng Ge, the stage ruler focused his attacks on Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Under such a situation, Luo Zheng had almost no room to retreat. He could only lie on the ground and try to resist with his arms.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>After the stage ruler landed a blow, the light spots within Luo Zheng's body became extremely active, helping Luo Zheng absorb the power of the blow.</p>

  <p>But the power of the stage ruler was too strong. While the Chaotic Source Spirits bore the power, they started showing faint signs of fatigue.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>At the same time, the golden light in Luo Zheng's body also glowed. It was the Truth of Divine Dao washing over him, restoring the energy of the Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>The stage ruler's huge eyes flashed with a strange light.</p>

  <p>He had never left Stage Fourteen, so he naturally had never seen anything like the Chaotic Source Spirits. He had been under the impression that Luo Zheng's body was just extraordinarily tough.</p>

  <p>But no matter how tough one thing was, there had to be a limit!</p>

  <p>Determined, the stage ruler launched another strike at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>The Chaotic Source Spirits, which had just been washed by the Truth of Divine Dao, once again were on the verge of falling into the state of fatigue.</p>

  <p>However, while Luo Zheng was momentarily suffering from the attack, the Truth of Divine Dao quickly restored the Chaotic Source Spirits...</p>

  <p>After being attacked by the stage ruler twice in a row, not only was Luo Zheng completely unharmed, the Chaotic Source Spirits were still full of vitality.</p>

  <p>A sly smile crept on his face.</p>

  <p>Recently, when Luo Zheng was testing the Chaotic Source Spirits within his body, he had come up with a theory.</p>

  <p>When the Chaotic Source Spirits' power reached a certain level, the Truth of Divine Dao of his body and the Chaotic Source Spirits could operate in a cycle, which could greatly slow down the speed of the Chaotic Source Spirits getting exhausted.</p>

  <p>As a result, the attack that the Chaotic Source Spirits inside Luo Zheng's body could withstand was ten to twenty times more powerful than what others could bear...</p>

  <p>What if the Chaotic Source Spirits continued to grow in power?</p>

  <p>The Truth of Divine Dao used the attacks Luo Zheng suffered to fuel the Chaotic Source Spirits. As long as Luo Zheng wasn't killed in one blow, his physical body would be practically indestructible!</p>

  <p>What was happening right now was proving his theory correct.</p>

  <p>The power of the stage ruler was indeed very strong, but he was unable to destroy the Chaotic Source Spirits all at once, which meant that the Chaotic Source Spirits would never fall into exhaustion thanks to his Truth of Divine Dao!</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>Every time the stage ruler landed another attack, the shock and disbelief in his eyes intensified.</p>

  <p>In all his years, he had never encountered such a strange thing before. At one point, he even began to doubt himself. Was he too weak, or was this human too strong?</p>
