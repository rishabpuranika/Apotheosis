  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng desired to know the reason he was unable to form a Godly Tile.</p>

  <p>Thus, he read quite a few books after he entered the Purple Soul Hall.</p>

  <p>The description of the Godly Tile lay bare in one of the classics.</p>

  <p>The Godly Tiles were the True Gods' profound comprehension of the Divine Dao, and they were condensed after the Internal Momentum Clouds formed.</p>

  <p>These Godly Tiles had different shapes. They were square, circular, rectangle and even polygonal shaped. The dual Godly Tile was formed by two equal parts, whereas the triple Godly Tile consisted of three equal parts.</p>

  <p>The edge of Luo Zheng's Godly Tile was covered with dense scales. It was quite like the Infinity Ruler. It was as if the Infinity Ruler had rolled up to the edge of the Godly Tile. Luo Luo Zheng could also feel the internal momentum of the Divine Dao from the scales.</p>

  <p>As the light emerged from the Infinity Ruler, it made its way towards the Godly Tile. About three thousand rays of light were emitted. The majority of the light rays were light golden, but some rays were of different colors.</p>

  <p>The light that contained the Snow Divine Dao emitted a ray of white cold light.</p>

  <p>With a sudden whoosh, Luo Zheng's body was suspended in the cold light.</p>

  <p>The cold light made its way towards the chaotic sea.</p>

  <p>Faint snowflakes began to appear where the light fell. These snowflakes also contained the internal momentum of the Snow Divine Dao, and the surface of the chaotic sea began to slowly freeze.</p>

  <p>A moment later, Luo Zheng's body flashed and appeared under another ray of purple light.</p>

  <p>The purple light hit the coast of the continent.</p>

  <p>The onlookers on the coast were in awe as they noticed the light. The humans that were present in Luo Zheng's inner world were shocked as to where the light came from.</p>

  <p>"Is this purple light auspicious?"</p>

  <p>"I think it contains something that is beyond our comprehension."</p>

  <p>"Who is talented enough to cultivate this kind of light?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's sudden appearance shocked the onlookers.</p>

  <p>There were a few people in this world who could instantly teleport to any place. Luo Luo Zheng was one of them. He could even teleport silently without any space fluctuation. No one was able to do so in his inner world.</p>

  <p>These people belonged to the sixth-grade sacred place on the continent.</p>

  <p>Many of them had reached the Soul Sea Realm, and they also had a vast experience and knowledge.</p>

  <p>"Who is he?" An old man at the Soul Sea Realm stared at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"He is the Venerable Creator!" another middle-aged man at the Soul Sea Realm stated. He knelt in front of Luo Luo Zheng. "Greetings, Venerable Creator!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had many titles in this world, and each culture had a different name for him. According to the culture followed by the people in this continent, Luo Luo Zheng not only created this world, but also took it upon himself to carry the entire world with his shoulder.</p>

  <p>As the two Soul Sea Realm warriors knelt, so did everyone else one by one. Behind them was a young martial artist, who looked quite unconvinced. This person was a recognized talent from a sixth-grade sect, and also was the son of the sect leader. He had achieved great many feats that many people couldn't when they were his age. Thus, he was a tad bit proud and arrogant.</p>

  <p>Although, he was aware of who Luo Luo Zheng was, he still refused to kneel.</p>

  <p>"Get down, Cody!" the warrior at the Soul Sea Realm said quite anxiously. A gust of cold wind blew which almost knocked the young warrior.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Luo Luo Zheng smiled. As he casually waved his hand, an invisible force spread out. "Please rise, all of you."</p>

  <p>These warriors then involuntarily stood up due to Luo Zheng's invisible force.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's attention was caught by the purple light.</p>

  <p>As the light gathered, it turned into streaks of purple smoke which flowed and leaped cautiously. It was the internal momentum of the Purple Mu Ning Divine Dao, and it was passed down from the Divine Dao Tablet Joy had built in the Heavenly Han House.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, the internal momentum that Luo Luo Zheng had absorbed was not the complete internal momentum.</p>

  <p>The Five Elements Divine Dao's internal momentum that he assimilated possessed six levels as well as the consummate level. It was the complete internal momentum.</p>

  <p>But other Divine Dao were somewhat incomplete. For example, the Purple Mu Ning Divine Dao only consisted of four theurgies. When Joy had set up the Divine Dao Tablet, she was a mere a top-rank True God who had little to no comprehension of the Purple Mu Ning Divine Dao or cultivating the Purple Sky Land. This made it impossible for her to obtain the six ordinary levels and one consummate level of this Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>"There are three thousand Divine Dao Tablets in the divine land. Have all of these Divine Dao Tablets also been derived from the internal momentum?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's heart was pounding out of his chest as he looked at the rays of light. These rays looked like the skeleton of the world, connecting to the Godly Tile above. Thus, he understood his father's purpose of putting the Infinity Ruler into his mind.</p>

  <p>His father was aware that he had mastered the Primal Chaos Technique.</p>

  <p>Perhaps his father and his master were not able to foresee how further Luo Luo Zheng could go while cultivating the Primal Chaos Technique, but they must have guessed the effects of mastering the Primal Chaos Technique.</p>

  <p>The life vitality could also be transformed into the warrior's inner world, the secondary world. With the continuous improvement of the warrior's cultivation base, the inner world became bigger and bigger. But the world was always the secondary world, and no living creature at any secondary world could leave the warrior's cinnabar field. Otherwise, it would directly be restored to the vitality between heaven and earth.</p>

  <p>Besides, the ultimate form of the secondary world could only be considered as a universe.</p>

  <p>The universe was gigantic, and it gave a Holy Being the ability to become immortal. However, it was only a dependency of the divine land.</p>

  <p>The inner world made from the chaotic energy was quite different. The ultimate form of the world was the divine land, but the divine land was constructed differently from the inner world. The Infinity Ruler was the critical factor as well.</p>

  <p>Perhaps Luo Zheng's father foresaw what might happen in the near future. Thus he gave Luo Luo Zheng the Infinity Ruler.</p>

  <p>'The Infinity Ruler, the Primal Chaos Technique, '</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng pondered. The Luo Clan might have been attacked and destroyed by the Mu Clan and the Dongfang Clan due to these things.</p>

  <p>The old man at the Soul Sea Realm interrupted Luo Zheng's chain of thought.</p>

  <p>He slowly floated towards Luo Luo Zheng, his face full of admiration and respect as he whispered, "Venerable Creator."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng asked the old man, "What's up?"</p>

  <p>"The purple Mu Ning seems to contain something endless and profound. Can I gain some insight into it? I would really appreciate if you could give me some advice, Venerable Creator," the warrior asked quite keenly.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng shook his head. "Only a woman who possesses the Purple Power Body can cultivate this internal momentum. If there is a woman with a Purple Power Body here, she could give it a try."</p>

  <p>"This is the internal momentum... Oh, I see." The old man at the Soul Sea Realm immediately nodded, but he was a little disappointed in his heart. The internal momentum was an extremely new word for him, let alone the Purple Power Body. It seemed that he could only let the female disciples of his sect come over to have a try.</p>

  <p>"You won't be able to cultivate the Purple Mu Ning Divine Dao, but look..."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng pointed towards the sky and said, "Did you notice the rays of light?"</p>

  <p>The old man of the Soul Sea Realm gave him a nod. The phenomenon was quite unusual. He brought the elites of the sect to this place along the rays of light.</p>

  <p>"Except the golden light rays, the internal momentum of other light rays can be comprehended," Luo Luo Zheng stated.</p>

  <p>The golden rays of light were from the Divine Dao that Luo Luo Zheng had never absorbed. The scales of the Divine Dao that had been absorbed reflected all sorts of Mu Ning and colorful light rays.</p>

  <p>The old man was quite pleased when he heard what Luo Luo Zheng said. He and his sect members wanted to rush over and comprehend immediately, but given that the Venerable Creator was present, they just stood there.</p>

  <p>There was a splash, and a huge Boundary Cloud was visible far away in the distant sky of the inner world.</p>

  <p>Someone had become a world lord.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was quite surprised by the unexpected turn of events, as the shadow of the Evil God flashed right before him. Then he smiled with relief. The Evil God's talent was extremely terrifying. Luo Luo Zheng had just proven the Divine Dao while the Evil God was immediately able to become a world lord.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng addressed the old man, "Goodbye." There was a flash, and he disappeared with a flash. His body still did not produce any space fluctuation.</p>

  <p>After seeing Luo Luo Zheng leave, the old man of the Soul Sea Realm pointed at the grey light and said, "Quick. Don't let the Dark Cloud Sect get ahead of us. Send more people to guard this purple light ray, and then bring out all the female warriors of our sect."</p>

  <p>The Dark Cloud Sect was also a sixth-grade sacred place.</p>

  <p>The grey light ray that was visible contained the internal momentum of the Tortoise Divine Dao.</p>
