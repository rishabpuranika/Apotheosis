  <p>
</p>

  <p>On the surface it seemed as if Tianming had visited Luo Luo Zheng to talk about the old days.</p>

  <p>However, his true purpose was to question Freya.</p>

  <p>Freya seemed to have appeared by Luo Zheng's side by accident. She had left the Ascending Well with Luo Luo Zheng, left behind a message rune to him, and then was found by Luo Luo Zheng, all by coincidence.</p>

  <p>Tianming was unable to predict where those people might be, but he was able to find an abrupt clue to it.</p>

  <p>He truly did not have any evidence to prove that Freya belonged with them, but he could prove that Freya was not reliable.</p>

  <p>"You have no other choice, believe me," Tianming said in a frigid voice.</p>

  <p>Freya retreated a few steps, feeling betrayed and wronged. "I don't have any intentions toward Luo Luo Zheng. I just want to stay by his side. Why are you doing this to me?"</p>

  <p>Tianming stared fixedly at Freya as he searched for a reason that would betray her in her eyes. However, her performance was flawless, as though she had appeared by Luo Zheng's side thanks to sheer luck.</p>

  <p>"I am grateful to Luo Luo Zheng for saving me. As long as I can stay by his side, I am willing to serve him like a servant," Freya continued.</p>

  <p>The lightning in Xenia's hands grew intense as she waited for Tianming to make the next move.</p>

  <p>Indeed, there was no way of questioning what Freya was saying.</p>

  <p>Tianming's eyes were serene. He raised the Soaring Snake Sword in his hand and slowly swung it at Freya.</p>

  <p>The sharp point of the sword reached the center of Freya's eyebrows and the extreme sword intent gave off a light silver glow. His sword intent was relatively mediocre and extreme, unlike Luo Zheng's lively one. If Luo Zheng's sword point was pointed at a person, that person would die under the threat of his sword intent alone.</p>

  <p>"I won't give you another chance. Tell me. What is your goal?" Tianming asked, his face unreadable.</p>

  <p>No matter how powerful warriors were, they would compromise in the face of death, unless they truly did not care for their lives. Tianming wanted to drive Freya to the brink of death so that she would admit to her wrongdoings.</p>

  <p>In truth, he did not dare to kill Freya before he received irrefutable evidence.</p>

  <p>Previously, he had done a thorough evaluation of Luo Zheng's character. Luo Zheng's talent was greater than his own, but he was like a simple child. He had full trust in the people around him.</p>

  <p>Freya had been by Luo Zheng's side for a long time. If he killed her, its impact on Luo Luo Zheng would be immeasurable. He needed unquestionable evidence to incriminate her, so his words just now about killing her were mere threats.</p>

  <p>However, Freya's performance was far better than what Tianming had imagined.</p>

  <p>Even in the face of death, she did not reveal any signs of panic. Her tone was very decisive. "If you kill me, I will die uncleared of a false charge.</p>

  <p>Why do you want to kill me? I'm sure Luo Luo Zheng won't want you to do it."</p>

  <p>Xenia frowned and shook her head. "Actually, we can just search your soul. The Celestial Position has a technique to search one's soul without damaging it. It will take a long time, but we will finally find out the truth."</p>

  <p>"Okay," Freya replied calmly. "I can cooperate with you in everything, but you must let me prove my innocence! I don't want Luo Luo Zheng to suspect me."</p>

  <p>As soon as she finished speaking, Tianming laughed.</p>

  <p>He slowly withdrew the Soaring Snake Sword and stared at Freya as he said, "I am sure now..."</p>

  <p>"Sure of what?" Freya was confused.</p>

  <p>"You're one of them," Tianming said confidently.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Freya's face darkened.</p>

  <p>"I don't see any imperfections in you," Tianming replied. "But that is your biggest flaw. You are far too confident and calm. As a warrior of the Soul Sea Realm who ascended to the Upper World, without any foundation and support like you claimed, how are you so level-headed while facing these accusations? You are indeed different."</p>

  <p>"Bullshit! You can say whatever you want, but it's not true," Freya said coldly.</p>

  <p>Tianming shook his head again. "I won't kill you, and I won't tell Luo Luo Zheng who you really are. No matter what reason you have to stay by Luo Zheng's side, as soon as I find an opening to your truth, I will not hesitate to kill you!"</p>

  <p>Freya snorted. She had no way of convincing Tianming otherwise. She bent down to carefully help Luo Luo Zheng up, carrying him back to the building.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Tianming and Xenia stood by the mirror-like lake for some time. "I still feel it would be better for us to kill the girl," said Xenia.</p>

  <p>"We can't, or Luo Luo Zheng will be against us." Tianming shook his head. "She's just so sure that I won't dare to kill her! But she's right. I won't."</p>

  <p>"If she stays with Luo Luo Zheng, it will bring more trouble," Xenia said, sighing.</p>

  <p>Tianming gave her a faint smile. "Trouble is inevitable. We'll talk about it when the time comes."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had a strange and long dream, long enough to recapitulate his entire life. He dreamed of how he grew up and accidentally fell into a large black hole connected to the back of the world. He saw the leader of the sorcerer race.</p>

  <p>A sudden flash of lightning lit up the leader's face, and in that moment, Luo Luo Zheng saw Yudie's familiar face! Did this mean that he could not trust Ning Yudie either?</p>

  <p>An intangible sense of sorrow enveloped Luo Luo Zheng, pity streaming through his veins. He really did not like this feeling. He hated feeling sorry for himself.</p>

  <p>Truth be told, it was a tragedy to have lived his entire life in a trap.</p>

  <p>His once indomitable momentum collapsed overnight.</p>

  <p>That indomitable momentum had been built on the confidence he had in himself. Good fortune had been the foundation of his warrior spirit.</p>

  <p>He was an ace talent and a Godly Genius. Even the heavens favored and protected him. Along the way, all sorts of evil spirits had to give way so he could walk and pursue his path.</p>

  <p>However, all of it had been artificial. He was not fated to be there.</p>

  <p>Someone had carefully guided him and created these different scenarios for him, step by step, for some unidentifiable, ultimate goal.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>An explosion sounded in his mind. The Soul-burning Wine he had gulped down had been highly toxic. Even though his soul was powerful, there were strong aftereffects of getting drunk on poison.</p>

  <p>Waking up, Luo Luo Zheng found himself lying on a stone bed.</p>

  <p>Seeing Luo Luo Zheng stir awake, Freya, still in her cotton shoes, quickly poured out a cup of warm, fragrant tea from a teapot. The tea would calm his soul and neutralize the effect of the wine. After Luo Luo Zheng drank it, it would remove the poison of the Soul-burning Wine from his body.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, you have woken up." Freya smiled at Luo Luo Zheng. Her smile was gentle as ever? heartwarming and lovely. Her own unique charm was infused into it. It was like having a cup of fresh green tea.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was still confused. He seemed to have forgotten something, something he had really wanted to inquire about before he fell into the deep sleep.</p>

  <p>At the sight of Freya, he thought harder. It seemed that before he fell asleep, he had heard Freya arguing with Tianming.</p>

  <p>The thought of it was incredulous.</p>

  <p>"What did you say to Tianming?" Luo Luo Zheng asked her.</p>

  <p>The expression on Freya's face remained calm. "You can ask him. I don't want to talk about it," she said, feeling wronged again.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?" Freya's expression made Luo Zheng's heart sink. Had Tianming tried to bully her? He pushed that thought out of his head. He knew very well that Tianming was a very upright person. He would not be so dull as to bully Freya in Xenia's presence.</p>

  <p>"It's nothing. Luo Luo Zheng, can I not talk about it?" Freya asked pitifully.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was confused to see her in this state, but he did not pursue the matter further. He told himself to ask Tianming about it at a later stage.</p>

  <p>However, Master Feng had brought him here and told him to wait. He did not know where Tianming had gone, so he could only wait until he appeared next.</p>

  <p>The scenery here was pleasing to the eye. Although Luo Luo Zheng was not in a good mood, he experienced rare moments of comfort. Sometimes, his mind went completely blank as he enjoyed the flowers with Freya by the lake outside.</p>

  <p>Three days later, more people began to arrive one after another.</p>

  <p>They were all black-robed Celestial Position warriors and made off after leaving behind a few things.</p>

  <p>These were all rare and priceless medicinal herbs. It was impossible to put a value to them.</p>

  <p>Even Luo Luo Zheng, who had seen many rare treasures in his lifetime, could not help but suck in a sharp breath when he saw the herbs. The Celestial Position was indeed so rich in treasures that it was hard to imagine it.</p>

  <p>After this, three black-robed persons arrived, seeming like leaders. They were all world lords.</p>

  <p>They introduced themselves as important figures in the Celestial Position, each of the three proficient in healing warriors. Their means and methods were among the best in the universe.</p>

  <p>One of them checked Luo Zheng's arm and frowned. "As a general rule, Corrosive Liquid corrodes all things. It is a miracle that your bones have not yet corroded, but I have to say that it will be harder to heal your hands."</p>
