<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Yudie's heart trembled, and a strong feeling of regret sprouted in her heart.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>Even if Ning Yudie was hit by this attack, she wouldn't be able to escape without any kind of defense.</p>

  <p>While she knew that Luo Luo Zheng had an extraordinary physique and had already broken through to the Virtual Tribulation Realm, she wasn't sure if he could block such an attack.</p>

  <p>"Do you really want to die because of a single sentence? Don't be so silly!"</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie stared at the light, her face full of worry.</p>

  <p>Not long after, the blazing white light slowly disappeared. Many of the martial artists' eyes were focused on it. Darius had a cold smile on his lips.</p>

  <p>He thought the man should have already turned to ash.</p>

  <p>However, his expression immediately darkened the moment he saw that the warrior he tried to kill was still alive, unharmed.</p>

  <p>"Am I stupid?" Luo Luo Zheng asked, as he floated unharmed, with a smile on his face.</p>

  <p>He looked back and turned to where Ning Yudie was.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng was safe and sound, Yudie's anxious heart became fully at ease.</p>

  <p>However, her face darkened as she coldly said, "Well, you can go to hell!"</p>

  <p>The life vitality of over ten thousand Illuminating Soul Realm warriors, when gathered together, would be exceedingly terrifying. Even if Luo Luo Zheng had the body similar to a high-grade fairy weapon, he still wouldn't be able to resist such magnitude of power. If he had resisted the blow physically, he would have been seriously injured, if he didn't die.</p>

  <p>However, before that power erupted, Luo Luo Zheng had already circulated the power of the Space Law to float outside the space.</p>

  <p>This was what made the Space Law invulnerable. The Space Law and the Time Law were the two most mysterious of all laws. It was true that controlling this type of law was difficult, but once one was able to control it, he or she would have unlimited edge over his or her opponents.</p>

  <p>Now that Luo Luo Zheng had mastered the second layer of the Space Law, he was like a fish swimming in space. No matter what storm might come, he would be as good as a fish in water. It was very difficult to hurt him unless his opponent was also proficient in the Space Law.</p>

  <p>Facing this man who suddenly appeared out of nowhere, Darius realized that he was probably in big trouble.</p>

  <p>Previously, with the Birdcage, he could guard River Wave City without any worries. Occasionally, he would lead thousands of warriors to go out and train. Those ordinary Virtual Tribulation Realm martial artists weren't matches for him. As long as he waved his banner, he could easily kill them.</p>

  <p>The moment he returned to River Wave City, the head of Cloud Hall had already launched crazy attacks on his city.</p>

  <p>As they were caught off guard, thousands of people were killed. Even Darius himself had almost lost his life. Fortunately, he was able to run away fast enough. In a moment of desperation, he quickly gathered all of the warriors in the city and quickly arranged his Birdcage.</p>

  <p>When he realized that he had captured a huge bird, a Life and Death Realm warrior, and he had the liberty to kill her, he was overjoyed.</p>

  <p>It was only a matter of time before he succeeded. If Ning Yudie wouldn't be able to break through the Birdcage soon, her life vitality would be exhausted at last. By then, she would be too weak to fight back.</p>

  <p>Also, Darius had so many plans with her.</p>

  <p>That woman was the head of Cloud Hall. She was probably the strongest woman in the Central Region. Moreover, she was shockingly young and had not yet married. If he could capture this woman alive... Darius had already been lost in reverie.</p>

  <p>He was very confident that he would be able to turn his illusions into reality. As long as he exhausted Yudie's life vitality, he would have a lot of methods at his disposal that would make her lose her ability to resist.</p>

  <p>Moreover, he would change her into a dissolute woman.</p>

  <p>That was why Darius had been extremely patient in this battle. Under that patience, he had hidden a burning desire that would do everything to get satiated.</p>

  <p>Never would he have thought that a Virtual Tribulation Realm martial artist would appear at this time, and ruin everything!</p>

  <p>River Wave City was the outpost position of the Heavenly Evil Sect. For the time being, Oracle City would not send out any troops to attack them, but why did Luo Luo Zheng suddenly attack them?</p>

  <p>When Darius saw Luo Luo Zheng, he immediately gathered the power of the Birdcage in order to get rid of him.</p>

  <p>He never expected that Luo Zheng's strength was far beyond his imagination.</p>

  <p>Darius was experienced, but he wasn't sure what method Luo Luo Zheng used to avoid his attack.</p>

  <p>He only knew that he was in danger now.</p>

  <p>However, at this critical juncture, he would not easily retreat, much less flee. River Wave City was a sturdy fortress, so he wouldn't leave it behind.</p>

  <p>Moreover, he knew that he couldn't outrun the head of Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>Right now, he could only fight as his life was on the line.</p>

  <p>Whirl!</p>

  <p>Darius quickly waved his banner, and the six Virtual Tribulation Realm elders also quickly changed their positions. While drawing life vitality to support the rune in the air, they were setting up another giant rune. The rune flashed and immediately shrouded in Luo Zheng's direction.</p>

  <p>No matter what happened, Luo Luo Zheng would not let Darius get what he wanted. He didn't stop at all but flew straight towards the Illuminating Soul Realm warriors at the bottom of the group. If they kept supporting those Virtual Tribulation Realm warriors above, this array would never be broken.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng knew how to break the array with a glance, and a sneer appeared on his face as he turned towards the Illuminating Soul Realm warriors. Since these independent warriors had chosen to join the Heavenly Evil Sect, then they must be ready to die at any time.</p>
