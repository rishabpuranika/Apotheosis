<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1713 It Was Delicious </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Only the tiniest droplet of sweat rolled down Tianming's temple as he didn't fully exert himself in this fight with Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Besides, he had deliberately imparted the Beginning Swordsmanship to Luo Zheng by this sparring session with him.</p>

  <p>Perhaps Luo Zheng wouldn't be at a disadvantage if he were to spar with Tianming using the sword strikes...</p>

  <p>However, that was Tianming's own way of cultivation, not his.</p>

  <p>If he wanted to win the fight, he needed to use his own strengths.</p>

  <p>He drew out the chaotic energy, which welled up together like clumps of ink and coiled around Zheng's meridians. Then, it flowed towards Zheng's right arm.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had now controlled the previously overwrought and fidgety sword intent and fixed it firmly on the sword blade.</p>

  <p>The sword blade emitted a golden light, which was quickly covered by the grey light. The two light beams mixed together looked like a ray of fireflies in the night sky.</p>

  <p>The weapons weren't that important during the fight.</p>

  <p>The Soaring Snake was indeed powerful, but the Thunder Wind Divine Sword could also be considered a supreme chaotic weapon after it was mixed with the chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>The true competition was between their respective actual strengths.</p>

  <p>"They've finally begun to fight!"</p>

  <p>"I've already cultivated for one lap, but their fight's only starting now?</p>

  <p>These two are really so slow in battling..."</p>

  <p>"Tianming, come on! Please try your best to win this time. I bet everything on you!"</p>

  <p>When Tianming previously saw Luo Zheng prepare for the battle, there was a gentle smile on his face. The Soaring Snake quickly rose up to the side of Tianming's face.</p>

  <p>"Even though you have comprehended the Emotion Closing Godly Way, it is still not enough. It is far from enough..." Tianming shook his head.</p>

  <p>It was known that there were many different types of destinies in this era.</p>

  <p>Almost everyone knew that Yan was the one who Luo Zheng kept looking for.</p>

  <p>She was the North Star that hung in the Northern Sky Region.</p>

  <p>The North Star could give direction and guide people to prevent them from getting lost. It pointed towards the right direction with the brightest illumination.</p>

  <p>Yan was a star that flickered only for Luo Zheng, and guided him all the way to the divine land.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Tianming suddenly had a dawning realization.</p>

  <p>He believed that his fight with Luo Zheng would be very intense.</p>

  <p>The battle between them might not be limited to this time. They might fight again soon even in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Still, that was just Tianming's prediction, and he clearly wasn't sure of something that hadn't happened yet!</p>

  <p>But if nothing unexpected happened in this battle, then Tianming would definitely win.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Tianming brandished the Soaring Snake and a wave of light suddenly spread out!</p>

  <p>His feet glided on the light beam which enabled him to move extremely fast.</p>

  <p>It was true that Zheng's Chaotic Gods-intimidating Strike was truly formidable.</p>

  <p>However, Tianming wasn't afraid of it even in the slightest.</p>

  <p>While the sword attack was indeed powerful, it wouldn't be effective if it failed to hit him.</p>

  <p>Tianming's lightning speed gave Luo Zheng enough reasons to be worried.</p>

  <p>Tianming's effortless movements were too fast!</p>

  <p>The Chaotic Gods-intimidating Strike was condensed in the sword, but Tianming's body was like a ray of light which constantly traveled back and forth on the Heaven Earth Board. Luo Zheng had a hard time figuring out his accurate position!</p>

  <p>Despite that, Luo Zheng didn't hesitate at all.</p>

  <p>He left the board as well, while the Thunder Wind Divine Sword appeared by his side as it approached Tianming.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>The two battling figures crossed each other and were only three feet away from each other!</p>

  <p>"Now is the time!</p>

  <p>Chaotic Gods-intimidating Strike!</p>

  <p>Stab!"</p>

  <p>Crazy as it might seem, Luo Zheng had learned the move on the spot!</p>

  <p>The sword in Zheng's hand emitted a sharp, long ray of light which quickly pierced Tianming. The light also contained a majestic momentum, which made its gold and grey luster quite eye-catching!</p>

  <p>The sharp light beam elongated even further and looked like it was about to pierce through everything that was in its way!</p>

  <p>However, something strange happened. Tianming's figure stopped and leaned aside at a certain angle the moment he passed by.</p>

  <p>That pause did not even influence his physical body's movement!</p>

  <p>It did however, allow the sword ray to pass by Tianming's side.</p>

  <p>Just a hair's breadth away...</p>

  <p>But it was not dangerous.</p>

  <p>He could dodge the ray at a farther distance if he wanted to, but Tianming didn't do so on purpose.</p>

  <p>He just felt that straying away more was unnecessary.</p>

  <p>"Again!"</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng did not stop and the chaotic energy within his body rose ceaselessly.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the chaotic sea in his body continued to shrink at a high rate.</p>

  <p>It was also at that moment that the World Tree appeared in Zheng's inner world. More time passed and it continued to grow and flourish with vigor.</p>

  <p>There was a fierce glint in Zheng's eyes as he did his first slashing motion� which already consumed 10 percent of his chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>He slashed again for the second time, and drew out even more chaotic energy. By the time he had drawn out 40 percent, the entire chaotic sea had been reduced by half!</p>

  <p>Zheng's plan was to seal off Tianming's escape route by the second time he swung his sword. As a result, he slashed out four times in a row.</p>

  <p>Three sword strikes had cut off Tianming's path and stopped him from escaping, while one sword strike was aimed straight at him.</p>

  <p>That one strike contained the boundless momentum, which turned the clouds into a shade of gold.</p>

  <p>Four sword strikes were quickly released.</p>

  <p>The sword intent and life vitality formed from the chaotic energy flooded the entire Heaven Earth Board like a surging tide.</p>

  <p>"Splash!"</p>

  <p>"Tianming won't be able to escape!"</p>

  <p>"Zheng's sword strike is too powerful. If Tianming can't escape, he'll be killed!"</p>

  <p>"Sadly, Tianming was too careless. He should've used his stronger methods to kill Luo Zheng at the beginning. Look at where he is now!"</p>

  <p>The crowd of spectators erupted into a noisy chatter at the battle's current situation.</p>

  <p>However, they didn't notice that the Soaring Snake in Tianming's hand began to throb slightly.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, waves began to spread around Tianming and envelope him.</p>

  <p>He faced Zheng's four sword strikes head on without any trace of fear on his face.</p>

  <p>What he had comprehended had already surpassed the Godly Way. Thus, he clearly knew that the Gods-intimidating Strike which Luo Zheng had mastered wasn't actually the real Gods-intimidating Strike.</p>

  <p>The waves spread out in all directions while surrounding Tianming. A small crack appeared on the Heaven Earth Board after the waves had covered it, which grew bigger until the board shattered.</p>

  <p>The waves continued to fan out and spread in the air before they finally landed on Tianming's sword.</p>

  <p>The four sword strikes Luo Zheng had unleashed fused with half of his chaotic energy and were his most powerful trump cards.</p>

  <p>Even then, Tianming still looked indifferent as before. When Luo Zheng launched his sword attack, Tianming already had a plan on how to deal with him.</p>

  <p>But just as Tianming was preparing to defend against Zheng's sword strikes, the Soaring Snake suddenly vibrated!</p>

  <p>"You..."</p>

  <p>Tianming suddenly looked troubled.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the Soaring Snake had been starved for too long. It was already quite irritable and almost broke the sword sheath before. It even wanted to swallow the Otherworldly Swordsman's sword back then.</p>

  <p>Tianming had managed to calm it down, but not without great difficulty.</p>

  <p>However, the sword was about to burst now. This time, its target was Zheng's sword.</p>

  <p>The Thunder Wind Divine Sword could be considered a good sword in the universe, but it was still inferior to a supreme divine weapon.</p>

  <p>But since Luo Zheng had drawn out a massive amount of chaotic energy and fused it with the sword, the sword released an Mu Ning that was quite similar to that of a supreme chaotic weapon!</p>

  <p>Tianming's sword then felt that this supreme chaotic weapon was even more delicious than the Otherworldly Swordsman's sword.</p>
