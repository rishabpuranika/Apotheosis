  <p>
</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The star grew for a short while and then plummeted towards the white hole.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng returned to the divine land, there wasn't much time left for him to learn about the Falling Star Palm.</p>

  <p>Although an immense amount of mysterious energy was contained in the Truth Crystal, it was not particularly powerful in terms of its strength.</p>

  <p>But when it came to the energy of truth, it was impossible to transform it using only the Furnace of Dark and Light.</p>

  <p>Even the Furnace of Dark and Light set up by Fuxi personally would also be the same case. Of course, if he took action, there might be other methods he could use to cope with the Falling Star Palm.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The star exploded as soon as it fell into the white hole.</p>

  <p>But the energy flow was swallowed up by the white hole so it disappeared without a trace.</p>

  <p>It was as if it had never appeared in the first place.</p>

  <p>In no time, beams of green energy suddenly gushed out from the black hole on the other side. The energy flow, like exploding fireworks, quickly filled up the entire Eight Diagrams disk.</p>

  <p>"It's impossible!</p>

  <p>I can refine anything with the help of my Furnace of Dark and Light, absolutely everything in the world!"</p>

  <p>Nicholas' eyes were about to crack. He tried his best to control the Eight Diagrams disk and forcefully drew it down. At the same time, the whirlpool below started to shrink rapidly.</p>

  <p>Sword Chen had fainted and was being propped up by the woman. Samuel had almost reached his limit, as there was a look of despair on his face.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The Eight Diagrams disk could no longer maintain its shape. It started to collapse and explode at the last moment.</p>

  <p>Nicholas calmed himself down. He was in deep thought. The unwillingness on his face disappeared and was replaced by calmness and coldness.</p>

  <p>Shortly after, countless cracks appeared on his head, which then turned into red crystals.</p>

  <p>At the moment of the explosion of the Eight Diagrams disk, the huge whirlpool that had shrunk to sixty to seventy feet also collapsed.</p>

  <p>As soon as the fetters disappeared, the woman took Sword Chen and quickly retreated. Samuel clenched his teeth trying his best to hold on till the end. He used the Spear of Supreme Harmony to build a space channel and exited through it.</p>

  <p>As for Luo Zheng and Tianming, the violent shock wave created by the Eight Diagrams disk propelled them dozens of miles away.</p>

  <p>Although the shock wave was very strong, Tianming's body was covered by the golden light so he was unhurt.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng himself was so strong. He escaped without a scratch on his body. He drew a parabola in the void. As soon as his body stabilized, he rushed forward.</p>

  <p>"Mother!"</p>

  <p>Nicholas brought Lorena there.</p>

  <p>By reading Nicholas' memories, Luo Zheng knew that he had hidden Lorena in a special small world.</p>

  <p>But after the Furnace of Dark and Light was activated, it refined everything in the big whirlpool. Did Lorena and the small world get refined as well?</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shot off towards the center of the whirlpool explosion.</p>

  <p>A frosted red statue came into view. It was actually a woman's statue.</p>

  <p>However, the statue didn't have a head.</p>

  <p>"This statue..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes narrowed slightly. He suddenly thought of something, and used the Reincarnation Soul Weapon again.</p>

  <p>He and Tianming had to destroy the Eight Diagrams disk at that moment, so he didn't spend time reading Nicholas' memories.</p>

  <p>Although Nicholas died, his Memory Flame was still alive. However, the Memory Flame was in a state of stagnation and didn't update any fresh memories anymore.</p>

  <p>So when Luo Zheng saw Nicholas' last memory, he was astonished.</p>

  <p>"I have failed in the end.</p>

  <p>I knew you'd come to read my memory.</p>

  <p>Since I used the Furnace of Dark and Light, I was prepared to sacrifice my own life. I knew that I would die, but as I am a Holy Being in the divine land, I would be reborn with the help of my universe. My soul would then occupy the treasure body again. That was my plan.</p>

  <p>I thought if I could refine the True Demon Body into the treasure body, it might work. That was why I was willing to sacrifice myself. But in the end, you shattered my hopes. I have to say that it's decreed by fate, and I can't do anything to change it!</p>

  <p>Lorena is sealed in the mysterious yellow world within the ring on the treasure body's finger. Although I have used the Furnace of Dark and Light, I can still protect the small world. I promised to help her find her body, but I failed. Although the treasure body can't refine the True Demon Body, it is the last gift I want to give her."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes searched the hand of the statue after he finished reading the last memory of Nicholas.</p>

  <p>As predicted by him, there was a dark golden ring on the statue's finger.</p>

  <p>"Mother..."</p>

  <p>Nicholas' last words had got Luo Zheng excited.</p>

  <p>He approached the statue with the intention of removing the ring.</p>

  <p>However, just then, a space fluctuation appeared from the side and a figure popped out from it. It was Samuel!</p>

  <p>Like Luo Zheng, Samuel could also read Nicholas' memory.</p>

  <p>When he realized that the treasure body was extraordinary, he had the idea of grabbing it.</p>

  <p>He knew he was no match for Luo Zheng, but he had the Spear of Supreme Harmony with which he could come and go as he pleased and Luo Zheng could do nothing to stop him.</p>

  <p>Obviously Luo Zheng was stunned at this turn of events. A trace of anger was visible on his face.</p>

  <p>"Get the hell out of here!"</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>With a wave of his hand, he fired a red lotus at Samuel.</p>

  <p>Just as the red lotus was about to reach Samuel, he snatched the treasure body and fled into the space channel.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Another space channel came to him from afar, crisscrossing Samuel's space channel.</p>

  <p>The two space channels collided and forced him out of his space channel.</p>

  <p>Now there was no escape.</p>

  <p>Samuel staggered, his face darkened and he threw the treasure body into the air. This time, he used the Spear of Supreme Harmony to tear up the void and drill his way out of the Cold Fiends' lair.</p>

  <p>The woman didn't mean to hunt him down. After all, his clone was in bad condition, and it was difficult for him to use the Spear of Supreme Harmony. But she had succeeded as Samuel left the treasure body behind.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was in no mood to pursue Samuel anymore. He flew over to the treasure body to take off the dark golden ring from its finger.</p>

  <p>There was a simple seal on the ring. Luo Zheng activated his spiritual sense and broke the seal with a bit of force.</p>

  <p>When he removed the seal, an unexpected beam of bright red light shot out from it.</p>

  <p>Lorena emerged from the little world with her long hair trailing behind her.</p>

  <p>She had expected to see Nicholas upon coming out of her world, so she pulled a long face, but when she saw Luo Zheng, her expression froze and her eyes were filled with disbelief.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng? Why are you here? Did Nicholas catch you?" Lorena sounded a bit worried. After all, the void didn't seem like a normal place.</p>

  <p>She glanced around and was surprised to see the woman not too far away from her.</p>

  <p>The woman covered her mouth with her hand and stared at Lorena with her beautiful eyes. She couldn't believe she would meet Lorena here of all places!</p>
