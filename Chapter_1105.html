<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As a princess of Wind Divine Kingdom, Fiona rarely had a chance to showcase her true strength.</p>

  <p>The imperial families of the four divine kingdoms all had their own secret training grounds, some of which were built using methods from the Upper World.</p>

  <p>Never had Fiona competed with anyone in public— everyone had only judged her strength from her position in the Wind Divine Kingdom.</p>

  <p>No one truly knew of Fiona's cultivation method, nor the laws she had comprehended.</p>

  <p>Though they all knew her to be strong, they never expected her to be this powerful. Faced against her, Zheng had no way to fight back.</p>

  <p>Even though she had only used seventy percent of her power with that strike, the bracelet on her wrist slightly shook before vibrating intensely, releasing a great force.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>A sound like a watermelon being crushed reverberated.</p>

  <p>After that, Zheng's figure suddenly fell and crashed straight into the enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, it was set up by a mighty warrior at the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>When he made impact, the barrier twisted and caved in, but the eyes of that mighty warrior flashed and he instantly restored it.</p>

  <p>If it were any other warrior on the receiving end of that strike, it would have been difficult for him to stand back up.</p>

  <p>Zheng, however, had the fairy weapon's physique. As soon as the huge force entered his body, it turned into primordial energy that let his body recover.</p>

  <p>Since his body had been refined into a fairy weapon, he never had the chance to refine it further. The fairy weapon's physique was still not enough to use against a warrior as mighty as Fiona. Even as he tried his best, he could only manage to convert seventy percent of the force into primordial energy, letting the rest do him damage.</p>

  <p>Still, he was able to withstand it, sustaining only minor injuries. In his current physical condition, at least, it took mere seconds for him to recover.</p>

  <p>Fiona's white and blue gown swayed in the wind. When she looked down at Zheng, her expression filled with worry, as did her heart. Even though she held back, she thought the hit might have still been too much for him.</p>

  <p>But in the blink of an eye, her worries were dispelled. A smile of relief replaced her expression of worry as she watched Zheng jump up from the enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>'This little girl is really kind as a saint, ' Zheng sighed inwardly.</p>

  <p>"Hmm? You've taken a fancy to her?"</p>

  <p>Of course, Xun didn't miss the opportunity to make such a remark.</p>

  <p>Without a word, Zheng smiled. Immediately ascending to the top, he met Fiona's eyes.</p>

  <p>"It's done!"</p>

  <p>Fiona suddenly shouted, turning to Zheng.</p>

  <p>The exclamation stunned him momentarily. "What's done?"</p>

  <p>At that moment, Fiona revealed a rather strange expression. In a daze, she said, "Isn't the competition over? Didn't I win?"</p>

  <p>Upon hearing her, all the other warriors wore a strange expression, looking at each other questioningly. A moment after, the entire crowd burst into laughter, save for the warriors of the Wind Divine Kingdom, who held the princess in their hearts as if she was some kind of goddess.</p>

  <p>Even for the many powerful warriors at the Soul Sea Realm, smiles were also surfaced on their faces. 'This girl is so innocent, ' they all thought to themselves.</p>

  <p>A helpless smile appeared on War King Wind's face— he could only blame himself for this matter. Ever since discovering her talent, he had spoiled his daughter way too much, never letting her go off alone.</p>

  <p>Of course, just because she had never trained alone, it didn't mean that she wasn't working hard. Many of her years were spent on cultivation, almost completely disregarding any other leisure activity. Her personality was still that of a young girl. Indeed, she was kind and naive, while possessing terrifying strength and talent.</p>

  <p>"The competition isn't over yet," Zheng replied in a grave tone.</p>

  <p>Fiona's relieved expression turned into one of confusion. "But…but you just lost to me…"</p>

  <p>As Zheng smiled, his face seemed to have a sense of craftiness about it. He said playfully, "But...but I haven't given up yet."</p>

  <p>After a blink of her eyes, she murmured, "Huh? I see. In other words, you have to admit defeat! I understand now."</p>

  <p>Indeed, she was innocent, but that did not make her a fool. In her opinion, Zheng had just lost— this was just a spar. There was no need for them to risk their lives and fight each other to the death. Now that the situation was clear to her, she had only one thought in her mind— she must make Zheng admit defeat.</p>

  <p>As soon as they finished speaking, her dress fluttered in the wind.</p>

  <p>Leaning her body forward, like a fairy, she flew toward Zheng.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, the bracelet on her wrist began vibrating as the Time Law began spreading from her arm.</p>

  <p>The bracelet was not used for attacking, but it had the ability to increase her strength and life vitality to a certain extent. The moment the Time Law spread, Zheng was already ready to reflexively retreat.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the Time Law spread impossibly fast. And because the space within the enchanted barrier wasn't large enough to begin with, there wasn't much of a chance for Zheng to escape.</p>

  <p>As he was enveloped by the Time Law, Zheng's figure became incomparably slow. Although he had already found a nearby space node, he was stuck to where he was by the Time Law just as he was going for it.</p>

  <p>'Holy... crap...'</p>

  <p>Under the effects of the Time Law, even Zheng's mind began to run slow.</p>

  <p>Though he could see Fiona rapidly approaching him with a seemingly heightened speed, he didn't have much of a choice.</p>

  <p>As Fiona approached Zheng once again, her delicate eyebrows knitted together in frustration. To make him admit defeat, she had to completely defeat him— fighting was not something she liked.</p>

  <p>However, Fiona understood that she was a representative of the Wind Divine Kingdom, and she belonged to its imperial family. Not wanting to lose the battle, she was left with no choice but to raise her power again.</p>

  <p>'I'll have to use ninety percent of my strength this time.'</p>

  <p>As she thought of it, her jade-like hand was already going for Zheng's forehead.</p>

  <p>Though the pat looked extremely gentle, as if she was merely stroking his head, Zheng had to be thankful that his body was as tough as a monster's— no warrior could underestimate her strength. If it were any other warrior in front of her, his or her head would have been completely crushed in an instant.</p>

  <p>Even with the body of a fairy weapon, he still felt dizzy to the point that he saw stars.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>Once again, Zheng's body crashed into the enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>Under Fiona's Time Law, Zheng fell incredibly slowly. After she removed the Time Law, his speed increased astonishingly, and he smashed hard into the enchanted barrier below.</p>

  <p>"Will you admit defeat this time?" Fiona asked with a deep frown.</p>

  <p>"No, I won't." Wiping the blood from the corner of his mouth, he shouted, "I won't admit defeat!"</p>

  <p>"Then come face me again!"</p>

  <p>With that, Fiona appeared instantly in front of Zheng. As the bracelet on her wrist trembled, her lily-white hand lightly brushed past him and Zheng's body charged into the sky within the enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>This time, Fiona had used a hundred percent of her strength.</p>

  <p>"Do you admit defeat?" As she asked once again, she was turning extremely intolerable— it was as though taking Zheng down was making her extremely uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>Puff! This time, Zheng rushed directly toward the left. Once again, blood spurted from his mouth.</p>

  <p>"Do you admit defeat?"</p>

  <p>Fiona asked again, sounding rather pleading.</p>

  <p>"No," he replied indifferently, looking up at her.</p>

  <p>Never did she think such a fighter existed in this world— his stubbornness was making her truly anxious at this point. Even though he was clearly no match for her, he endured with sheer willpower. After a moment, she suddenly opened her mouth and pleaded, "I'm begging you, just admit defeat!"</p>

  <p>She didn't want to kill Zheng, but he refused to admit defeat no matter how hard she struck. To other warriors, it was a simple matter— they would simply kill him.</p>

  <p>To Fiona, however, it was an impossible hurdle.</p>
