<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Well..." Master Wu hadn't thought about things so deeply just yet.</p>

  <p>Listening to Luo Zheng, he solemnly nodded in agreement. The top-rank True Gods, consummate True Gods and the Holy Beings had monopolized nearly ninety percent of the divine might coins in the divine land. Six times refined pills were nothing more than common objects in their eyes.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was right. They had no reason whatsoever for using the force of iron to break taboos. Master Wu continued, "Indeed, from the looks of it, the nameless senior you're speaking of is an intelligent warrior with a humble background. I have studied the Five Elements Godly Way all my life, but I have never thought of such a method. As you said, I must be blinded by the old system. Alas..."</p>

  <p>"In fact, I need your help in the Heavenly Han House," Luo Zheng took this opportunity to make a request.</p>

  <p>Master Wu glanced at Luo Zheng. Although Luo Zheng hadn't told him what his purpose was, Master Wu could easily take his guess. "You want to join the Heavenly Han House, I presume?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>The reality was, too many proving godly warriors wished to join the Heavenly Han House.</p>

  <p>All of the proving godly warriors viewed the Heavenly Han House as a springboard to success. Once they joined the Heavenly Han House, they knew they would become True Gods.</p>

  <p>Almost every day, a few warriors burned with the desire to ask Master Wu for help in joining the Heavenly Han House. However, in the end, they had to rely on their own strength and talent in order to be accepted there.</p>

  <p>Master Wu finally understood that this warrior, who was named Tianxing Luo, wasn't from any influential clan, nor was he extremely talented. He was only an ordinary proving godly warrior, and had simply been lucky enough to find a way for breaking the taboos. Using his discovered method as an exchange, he wanted to join the Heavenly Han House.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had enlightened Master Wu with his words and had truly helped Master Wu quite a bit by doing do. Therefore, Master Wu felt Zheng's request was one he could not refuse. He only shook his head and said,</p>

  <p>"Although I am a True God of the Heavenly Han House, I can't make the exception of bringing you into the house. You have to pass the selection process before you enter, just like anyone else."</p>

  <p>When the Heavenly Han House recruited proving godly warriors, there were usually over a hundred thousand warriors participating in the test at the same time. However, only about ten of them would be recruited in the end. Master Wu wasn't even the one to decide who made the cut.</p>

  <p>Moreover, those who joined the Heavenly Han House were all highly talented among the proving godly warriors. Even if Master Wu helped Luo Zheng cheat, Luo Zheng would quickly expose himself if he was not talented enough to enter the Heavenly Han House.</p>

  <p>"I can recommend you and help you get a place in the test, though."</p>

  <p>Master Wu wore an odd expression on his face as he said this.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, it was hard for ordinary martial artists to enter their names for the test. After all, a place in the test could be sold for seven or eight divine might coins, which wasn't considered a small amount.</p>

  <p>However, the mystical method for breaking the two taboos that Luo Zheng had told Master Wu was far from being worthy of such a price. Sure, Luo Zheng had rendered enormous help to Master Wu, but Master Wu could only help him obtain a place in the test, so he felt rather apologetic.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled slightly. "Your help will be greatly appreciated if you get me a place. I'm not picky."</p>

  <p>What Master Wu didn't know though, was that Luo Zheng didn't value the opportunity of furthering his training in the Heavenly Han House. The Heavenly Han House was just a springboard beneath his feet, and his final goal was the Floating Island of the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>If he couldn't even enter the Heavenly Han House with his true abilities, how would he ever be able to enter that Floating Island?</p>

  <p>It was already more than enough for Luo Zheng to obtain a spot in the test.</p>

  <p>There was no need for Master Wu to worry about the rest.</p>

  <p>"If that's the case, then so be it. You have picked the right timing. The Heavenly Han House assesses only once in a year, and the test will begin in one month. Already more than half of the slots to take part in the test have been given out. Wait here a minute. I'll get a slot for you." With that, Master Wu turned on his heel and left the courtyard.</p>

  <p>Not long after, he came back with a White Jade Token in his hand. He handed the token to Luo Zheng and said, "Just engrave your name on it."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng accepted the White Jade Token and held it in his hand. There was a cool feeling that seemed to be radiating from it. This kind of jade was extremely rare in the universe, but rather common in the divine land. Luo Zheng stood up and bid farewell to Master Wu.</p>

  <p>Once Luo Zheng had left and was out of earshot, Master Wu shook his head and muttered, "I hope that you can rely on your own abilities to enter the Heavenly Han House, but I'm afraid that there's no hope for you this year."</p>

  <p>This year was a great year for the Han Clan's test, and all of the talented disciples of the 36 regions under the jurisdiction of Han Clan would be gathered in the Heavenly Han House. Luo Zheng was less than 100 years old.</p>

  <p>Although Master Wu didn't have the chance to verify his talent, he knew he stood no chance in front of all those super talented martial artists. He still wished him good luck in his heart though.</p>
