  <p>
</p>

  <p>Reinhard's sword strike was way too fast.</p>

  <p>Not even a top-rank True God would've been able to avoid it.</p>

  <p>"These Fanged Cicadas aren't very scary. So long as they don't get into our heads, then we'll be fine," Reinhard said. "Everyone! Follow me."</p>

  <p>With that, he lightly stomped on the sword under his feet and shot down vertically.</p>

  <p>Reinhard's orders from Marsh were to protect Zheng and his sister, but to him, if these two siblings couldn't manage to get through here, then protecting them wasn't going to be of any use.</p>

  <p>The dangers they would face were grave, and there was no way they'd be able to approach the skeleton if they were too weak.</p>

  <p>To him, it was better for them to pin their hopes on the members of their own clan.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The remaining eleven disciples of the Sword Clan followed Reinhard and also swooped down.</p>

  <p>Enoch and the other top-rank True Gods saw Reinhard courageously wielding his sword. The sight painted a very reliable and valiant image of Reinhard in their hearts, and they naturally followed after him, confident that he would be able to protect all of them.</p>

  <p>Yan had a smile on her face, seemingly unaffected by Reinhard's attack.</p>

  <p>"Let's go, Zheng," she told her brother. "Just hide behind me no matter what happens."</p>

  <p>Zheng could only smile back and follow his sister down.</p>

  <p>As they fell, their speed also increased. Some even opted to kick the flying swords under their feet away and just delved into the free-fall.</p>

  <p>The Fanged Cicadas lurked in the larva's body. Whenever a creature passed by, a black blur would suddenly jump out which turned out to be a Fanged Cicada.</p>

  <p>Reinhard was in the front. He held his scabbard with one hand and the hilt of his sword in the other.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>There were numerous cracking noises as the larva's skin crumpled.</p>

  <p>Reinhard lightly moved his right hand and let out a sharp sword light that immediately cut the cicada in half.</p>

  <p>There weren't that many Fanged Cicadas in the beginning. One or two would come out every thousand feet or so.</p>

  <p>However, as they went farther down, more and more Fanged Cicadas shot out of the larva's body. Reinhard's sword wielding got even faster in order to keep up. A few Fanged Cicadas would escape every once in a while but the other Sword Clan disciples took care of it.</p>

  <p>Seeing the fierceness of the Sword Clan members, the other top-rank True Gods felt relieved.</p>

  <p>"This place is not dangerous at all."</p>

  <p>"Those Fanged Cicadas only move fast. As long as we stay alert, we can kill them too."</p>

  <p>"Eh? Did the Fanged Cicadas disappear just now?" a top-rank True God exclaimed. Reinhard seemed to have also stopped wielding his sword.</p>

  <p>Zheng's brows were creased as he looked at the larva that hung on the cave wall.</p>

  <p>Its body was more than a hundred thousand feet long.</p>

  <p>Since it was dead, then it's flesh should've already been eaten up by the Fanged Cicadas. There should be Fanged Cicadas crawling all over the larva's body, and there was no way they could've just disappeared just like that.</p>

  <p>He didn't know it, but Reinhard was thinking the same thing.</p>

  <p>It wasn't Reinhard's first time here, and the Fanged Cicadas didn't just make their home here. These creatures were scattered all over the Sunrest Tree.</p>

  <p>The Fanged Cicadas already lived here way before the Sword Clan came.</p>

  <p>There was a system in the way these Fanged Cicadas hunted. If they went after a large beast, they would kill its soul and then gradually invade its body. The flesh would then serve as both food and a place for them to multiply.</p>

  <p>They also had their different groups. Fanged Cicadas of one group would often go head-to-head with another group in order to fight for dominance over a creature's body.</p>

  <p>It wasn't until they had devoured their prey's flesh entirely that the Fanged Cicadas would leave.</p>

  <p>This larva next to them was huge. It had also been dead for a long time judging from its state. Something didn't feel entirely right.</p>

  <p>Reinhard went down tens of thousands of feet more.</p>

  <p>It was then that he heard a cracking sound.</p>

  <p>The sound caused Reinhard to look at the larva with apprehension.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>Numerous tears appeared on the larva's outer skin as an army of black cicadas crawled out and lay in wait for the warriors.</p>

  <p>It was only then that everyone clearly saw the appearances of these Fanged Cicadas.</p>

  <p>Circles of red lines adorned the back shell of the creature where a pair of wings, as sharp as two blades, hid. On its head were a pair of awls, similar to sharp thorns, that served as their teeth.</p>

  <p>These Fanged Cicadas simply stood there, motionless and not attacking.</p>

  <p>Many top-rank True Gods paled at the sight. There were just too many of them!</p>

  <p>Even Reinhard's face darkened and he finally remembered something.</p>

  <p>"The king of the Fanged Cicadas has been born. We should all pray!" he announced.</p>

  <p>A regular Fanged Cicada wasn't very intelligent which made it easy to deal with.</p>

  <p>However, this wasn't the case with the king, which was highly intelligent and could very well command a swarm effectively against enemies.</p>

  <p>The situation they were in right now proved to be more dangerous than what they initially thought.</p>

  <p>The Sword Clan had killed many Fanged Cicada kings in the past, but it always entailed sacrificing a lot of their disciples' lives.</p>

  <p>There was no way for Reinhard to have expected a Fanged Cicada king in this year's debate over Godly Ways.</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, more Fanged Cicadas emerged from the larva's skin. They stayed put, not daring to attack the warriors just yet.</p>

  <p>"Charge down!"</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>With Reinhard's command, everyone moved down at full speed.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the Fanged Cicadas also made their move, turning into black streaks as they shot towards the top-rank True Gods.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Each Fanged Cicada was a deadly killer.</p>

  <p>A swarm merely looked like a collection of thousands of black lines that swiftly charged towards them.</p>

  <p>"Watch out!"</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The top-rank True God who shouted to warn the others was the first to fall as a small hole appeared in his forehead.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>His elixir field flashed blue before his entire body burst into a huge fireball.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, nobody could afford to pay any attention to this top-rank True God.</p>

  <p>It was every man for himself in the utter chaos and all the True Gods could only watch out for their own backs as they dived down.</p>

  <p>The purple light in Yan's eyes grew brighter. As a top-rank True God, she had the ability to fly and had no need for the flying sword. She quickly kicked it under her feet and grabbed Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>"They are coming!"</p>

  <p>In an instant, sixty to seventy streaks of black light appeared not too far away from them.</p>

  <p>Zheng was very much ready to fight against these Fanged Cicadas.</p>

  <p>These creatures were fast but it wouldn't be terribly difficult to kill them.</p>

  <p>He never expected that his sister would only need to utter a single word to deal with all of them.</p>

  <p>"Annihilate!"</p>

  <p>Then, something strange happened.</p>

  <p>Just as she spoke, the Fanged Cicadas heading towards them all fell to the ground, as if they had suddenly died in mid-air.</p>

  <p>While this happened, Zheng did not feel even the slightest fluctuation of energy.</p>
