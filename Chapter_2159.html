<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2159 Special Way To Eat (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Cyan flame rose up from Luo Zheng's wine. It burned intensely and condensed into the shape of a crescent moon.</p>

  <p>The wine was one of the famous wines in the Six-Burden Divine City. It was called the Moon Melting Wine. Just a small pot of it would cost twenty divine might coins. Only extravagant and wealthy warriors were able to afford such wine.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng thought the price was outrageous. However, Master Evil had recommended it strongly and told him that this pot of wine was the key.</p>

  <p>Everyone felt a sense of novelty when they saw Luo Luo Zheng ignite the cup of wine. Most of their attention was focused on Luo Luo Zheng. Some of them started to speculate about Luo Zheng's origins. Eric's round eyes also stared intensely at Luo Luo Zheng, for he also didn't know what Luo Luo Zheng was about to do.</p>

  <p>After he caught everyone's attention with the cyan flames, Luo Luo Zheng held his chopsticks and reached for his first dish.</p>

  <p>The snow lotus petals on the plate overlapped with each other to form a small arched bridge. The delicate formation of the dish made it more attractive to eat. It was the famous dish of the Brilliant Moon Restaurant, the Snow Lotus Arch.</p>

  <p>The snow lotus which had been harvested from a snowy mountain of a snowy region was naturally cold. At that moment, the petals still emitted a dense, cold Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>In the divine land, even the ordinary divine citizens could swallow such an extremely cold object. If it was any living being below the Life and Death Realm in the universe, they would not even be able to come close to a three feet radius from the table, let alone eat it, which would be no different from courting death.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng used chopsticks to pick up a petal of the snow lotus, a layer of frost immediately covered his chopsticks. The petals emitted a chilly atmosphere in which Luo Zheng's breath could be seen.</p>

  <p>Soon after, Luo Luo Zheng roasted the snow lotus petals on the fire above the cup.</p>

  <p>The crescent-shaped flame surrounded the snow lotus petals.</p>

  <p>Extremely cold objects often had extreme reactions to fire. Snow lotus petals continuously melted under the fire, and at the same time, emitted a strange stench. A smelly odor immediately filled the restaurant.</p>

  <p>"So smelly!"</p>

  <p>"What's that disgusting smell? What is this fellow burning?!"</p>

  <p>"This is too smelly! Can anyone stop that fellow?"</p>

  <p>The stench spread out and rushed into the noses of the bystanders. This caused many people to quickly cover their noses and frown. The customers and the restaurant crew immediately threw stares of disgust at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng turned a deaf ear to those voices and focused on Master Evil's instructions.</p>

  <p>"The Moon Melting Wine is brewed in a special way. The marrow within it smells very good. However, after being burnt, its smell becomes unbearable. Additionally, if it is mixed with a snow lotus, the stench becomes even worse. Then, you will mix them with the earthy crystal tendons in the Fire Duck Stand, and then use the fire to refine them.</p>

  <p>Then grind the spice into powder and sprinkle it on them..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's reaction was very quick. He would immediately do whatever Master Evil said. With great precision, he had done each task successfully.</p>

  <p>Amid the stench, the onlookers were dumbfounded. The expressions were filled with anger and disgust. The impudent fellow wasn't eating; he was obviously in the restaurant just to concoct a golden pill.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's hands continuously moved. Inside his head, he also reached the same conclusion as the bystanders. It seemed that Master Evil's instructions were for the concoction of pills, just that there was no furnace.</p>

  <p>He was also quite confused. Aside from his confusion, his hunger had also made him rather impatient. Why did it take him so much effort just to eat something?!</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng still followed Master Evil's instructions, up to the very last step. Finally, Luo Luo Zheng reached out his hand to gently condense another fire to burn.</p>

  <p>After a short while, a "ding" sound was heard. A golden pill had actually been burnt out from the food. The instant the golden pill appeared, a strange fragrance diffused into the air and covered the entire Brilliant Moon Restaurant.</p>

  <p>"He was really concocting..."</p>

  <p>"It smells so good!"</p>

  <p>"I've never smelled such a pill before. It doesn't smell like medicine at all. On the contrary, it smells like food..."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stared at the golden pill with a look of surprise on his face. With curious eyes, he investigated the pill in front of him. He then said to Master Evil, "So you wanted me to concoct a golden pill?"</p>

  <p>"Nonsense! Do you think it is very easy to concoct the golden pills? This is only a food pill, it can only fill the stomach," Master Evil smugly said.</p>

  <p>His tone remained arrogant.</p>

  <p>The fragrance of the food pill continued to grow stronger and stronger. It was as if the aroma could seep into their souls. It caused many of the martial artists present to feel their throats churn, and they couldn't help but have a strong appetite. The delicious scent incited their hunger and made them unconsciously salivate.</p>

  <p>Naturally, Luo Luo Zheng was no exception. A strong sense of hunger enveloped him. Curiosity for the taste of the pill eventually got the better of him. He couldn't help but grab the pill and put it in his mouth.</p>

  <p>An extremely complex taste spread rapidly across Luo Zheng's tongue. A mixture of different delicious flavors bombarded his taste buds. The pill was so good that it caused Luo Zheng's soul to tremble. He was simply unable to describe the taste, and could only lower his head to savor it. The moment he tasted it, he knew that he would remember it for the rest of his life, and never forget it.</p>

  <p>It was only then that he understood why Master Evil wanted him to come to the Brilliant Moon Restaurant after he had entered the Six-Burden Divine City.</p>

  <p>As the life span of these True Gods in the divine land was limitless, they had a lot of time to study other things. In addition to the comprehension of the Divine Dao to the peak, they were also able to reach the pinnacle of other things such as eating. This made Luo Luo Zheng have a new appreciation for the cultural inheritance in the divine land.</p>

  <p>On the top floor of the Brilliant Moon Restaurant, Watts Han and Jimmy Han looked down at Luo Luo Zheng with a strange expression on their faces. Intense curiosity developed in their heads as they witnessed Luo Zheng's actions.</p>

  <p>"That person is less than a hundred years old, but he is truly knowledgeable. He can even concoct an Original Pure Food Pill," Watts said in surprise. His eyes widened as he gawked at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"I don't know which senior he got the secret recipe from, but it was a splendid display. He's rather interesting. This year, Han Clan's examination attracts some strange people again," Jimmy said with a smile.</p>

  <p>The two brothers had represented the Han Clan as the manager of the Brilliant Moon Restaurant for three divine eras. Countless customers had already visited the restaurant and the menu had changed from time to time. They had heard of the Original Pure Food Pill, but they had never seen it with their own eyes. Since they saw such an extraordinary recipe from a proving godly warrior, they were naturally confused.</p>

  <p>"Should we bring in that fellow and ask him?" Watts asked. His curiosity about the pill grew even stronger.</p>

  <p>"No, this person will definitely take the Han Clan's exam. Then whether he's a dragon or a dog, we'll know when the time comes," Jimmy replied as he shook his head. Expectant eyes were on his face.</p>

  <p>Although the Original Pure Food Pill was truly magical, it could only satisfy one's appetite for a while. It was still not the right way in the eyes of some people.</p>
