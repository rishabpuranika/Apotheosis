<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 198 The Attack From The Demon (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Dubious looks were plastered on everyone's faces and hushed whispers were heard in the room. If someone else had mentioned these words, people would take them as a joke.</p>

  <p>It had been a while since Hugh entered the Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>Although he wasn't the strongest refiner among the people at the Illuminating Soul Realm, he would definitely be a great power in front of the refiner of half-step into the nature level. Those in the Illuminating Soul Realm and half-step into nature level differed in strength, as was the case with a strong tiger versus small ant. It was a common knowledge among the people.</p>

  <p>However, when did the Illuminating Soul Realm refiners become so weak that a refiner half-step into the nature level could defeat Hugh?</p>

  <p>So, people at present felt confused to hear what Yolande had said just now.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, all of them knew Yolande very well. She wasn't born to tell a lie and she was honest by default. If she said that Hugh was almost killed by the boy half-step into the nature level, it must have really happened. They wanted to believe what she said, but they couldn't see how it happened.</p>

  <p>"Are you serious, Yolande?" Spencer asked. He was surprised to hear that too, and he could only ask about it on behalf of all the people present with them.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Hugh would have died had I not interfered," Yolande replied in her usual calm tone.</p>

  <p>Everybody fell silent again when they heard this. As they watched Luo Luo Zheng again, a strange tinge of light shone in their eyes when they saw that Luo Luo Zheng could defeat Hugh at the Illuminating Soul Realm by using only the strength that was just half-step into the nature level. What a strong and strange refiner Luo Luo Zheng was!</p>

  <p>Unlike the curious looks on most people, Hugh felt annoyed and shameful after Yolande's explanation as he was one of the heroes of the conversation. His face turned red like a mature persimmon. He flushed like the shade of cherries so deep that his skin almost turned purple. It seemed as though the blood would bleed away with a mere gentle press on his face.</p>

  <p>"No, no, no, I wouldn't die even if Yolande did not intervene! I would only be seriously wounded at most," Hugh explained hastily. He couldn't help but stand up as he defended himself.</p>

  <p>However, after he had finished, he realized that he was too dumb and impulsive to say that. He would have cried, if there weren't so many important people among them. When Hugh thought of the whole thing, he felt that he wanted the ground to swallow him up instead, rather than just stand here under the curious stares of so many people.</p>

  <p>The first time Yolande mentioned that, they still held doubts even if they all thought that she was telling the truth. After all, the fact that an Illuminating Soul Realm refiner couldn't match against someone of a lower level was simply ridiculous and unheard of.</p>

  <p>Everyone remained quiet. When Hugh yelled rather defensively awhile ago, he had admitted that Yolande had been right after all.</p>

  <p>To be seriously injured by someone from the younger generation who was only half-step into the nature level, and to be defeated to death? Was there any big difference between the two?</p>

  <p>"Ehem?" a barely audible cough broke the silence. Finally, Lennie, who had been silent the whole time, felt that he had something to say to clear the whole situation. He spoke, "I was also there at that time. The boy half-step into the nature level is called  Luo Luo Zheng Luo, and he has a good relationship with my niece. Today for some reason, he had certain conflicts with Hugh. I think Hugh's defeat is not really because he was less strong than Luo Luo Zheng, but because of the fact that he was so careless and overconfident that he underestimated his rival. Thus, it led him into defeat."</p>

  <p>After Lennie's speech, everyone looked at each other in doubt once again. Even after his explanation, they still couldn't fully understand the situation.</p>

  <p>What? Since when did the powers of the Illuminating Soul Realm have to be careful when faced against the boy only half-step into the nature level? That was totally unheard of. It was simply preposterous!</p>

  <p>When Spencer noticed Lennie's failure to solve the current dilemma, he ordered, "No matter what happened, the demon is now attacking our city.</p>

  <p>Yolande, you can't always take this boy with you, and he couldn't attend our Military meetings either. Could you let him go first? If this disciple from Cloud Sect, Luo Luo Zheng, really did something wrong, he would be punished by the Military Office in the future." Even if Spencer was also quite interested in Luo Luo Zheng, he didn't want to waste too much time on the investigation of this matter, especially that the demon was about to lay siege to the city. The key for them was to talk through things and find a solution.</p>

  <p>"No, Spencer. If I do not lock him up, he would run away," Yolande said, shaking her head. Now, they were a bit lost on finding a compromise.</p>

  <p>Even Spencer had no more ideas at this point. He knew that it was difficult to persuade her once Yolande had decided on one thing. He had to dissuade Yolande, he wanted to insist. But then again, he understood that fighting Yolande's nearly abnormally strong power, even though it was on par with his strength, wasn't an easy thing to do.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, how could he waste his energy challenging Yolande when all of the imperial military forces had to deal with the demon's assault?</p>

  <p>Now, the current problem was that Luo Luo Zheng could not be allowed to attend their military meeting. Spencer therefore tried to think about alternative solutions. After a brief consideration, a smile broke on his face.</p>

  <p>"Yolande, how about I announce that I'm going to reopen the Military Office now? I'm going to ask the military officers to come here. You let Luo Luo Zheng go and we could arrest him in the Military Office, where he couldn't escape," he proposed.</p>

  <p>Yolande blinked her eyes and nodded without expression. "That's fine."</p>

  <p>"That's good," Spencer said and promptly ordered the man beside him to inform the military officer to come here.</p>

  <p>Yolande gently waved her hand. Her magic made the six pieces of indestructible transparent enchanted barriers which wrapped around Luo Luo Zheng disappear immediately without a trace.</p>

  <p>Once all the barriers left, Luo Luo Zheng suddenly felt relaxed and comfortable. The imperial army still seemed to have reasonable people among their ranks.</p>

  <p>Perhaps, this imperial army governor wasn't that bad after all!</p>

  <p>His joints popped in a satisfied sound when he stretched his body out, and then he stood up. He had to move his limbs for a bit before his stiff body returned to its usual state.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, you just have to go with the officers of the Military Office..." Luo Luo Zheng heard someone whisper close to him.</p>

  <p>It was Lennie, who closely approached him and secretly muttered in his ear, then gave him a knowing wink.</p>

  <p>For most soldiers, the Military Office was a dangerous place. However, Lennie was confident that he could rescue Luo Luo Zheng from that place. Josef, who was a counselor for the imperial army, was actually killed by Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>It was easy for Lennie though, to protect Luo Luo Zheng through the Military Office.</p>

  <p>In turn, Luo Luo Zheng nodded to show his understanding. Soon enough several Military Office officers came in. Two of them carried out Spencer's command to take Luo Luo Zheng out. They escorted Luo Luo Zheng out of the room and quietly shut the door.</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng and the officers had left, Spencer began to arrange the Imperial Army's combat plan.</p>

  <p>The remaining people in the room gathered around Spencer and the discussion started. "This time, the demon must have planned the attacks for long. Since the demon dares to attack the city at this moment, we must not despise them and must be extremely careful in the fight,"</p>

  <p>Spencer said as he analyzed the current situation. The demon never started a fight without extensive preparation and unless they were fully confident to win.</p>

  <p>For example, the Heaven Tower and the Earth Tower had been built so long ago that they had never been attacked head - on by the demon.</p>

  <p>Last time, however, the demon came well-prepared and surprised the imperial army. The demon had successfully occupied these two towers with only one fight.</p>

  <p>And now, they were planning to attack the White Emperor City. Who could know what the demons had prepared and on what great power were they going to rely?</p>
