<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Below the River Wave City, tens of thousands of Illuminating Soul Realm martial artists were sitting in a neat row and were releasing their life vitality as they maintained a meditative posture. They were all wearing the garbs of the Heavenly Evil Sect.</p>

  <p>Many of them would occasionally take out low-grade life vitality crystals, crush them, absorb their life vitality, and then release it through their own bodies.</p>

  <p>Above them, hundreds of Internal Elixir Realm martial artists were rapidly traveling back and forth. After being divided into groups, their life vitality would be gathered together and it would form several thick beams of life vitality that would then shoot upwards.</p>

  <p>Above these Internal Elixir Realm martial artists, there were six Virtual Tribulation Realm martial artists in green who were setting up a giant rune using the beams of life vitality. In the middle of the rune, there was one person - Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>No one in River Wave City could match Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>If what happened had happened in the past, no sect would be able to bring Ning Yudie down, even if they gathered all of their warriors to fight as a single unit. In that scenario, Ning Yudie would be strong enough to slaughter all of the warriors in River Wave City all on her own.</p>

  <p>But that was before. The Heavenly Evil Sect had developed an uncanny way to fight, and it had worked brilliantly for them. First, they would gather the life vitality of tens of thousands of Illuminating Soul Realm disciples in order to form a big array that could cover the sky. This big array would then be controlled by six Virtual Tribulation Realm warriors, and with that, they would trap their prey - Ning Yudie, in this instance.</p>

  <p>Despite being a warrior at the Life and Death Realm, Ning Yudie couldn't break out of the bubble that was enclosing her. She continued to attack the rune, but she was already showing a trace of exhaustion on her face.</p>

  <p>Every time she accumulated her life vitality, a horrifyingly cold energy would burst out of her body. Under the extreme cold, the rune that was trapping her would greatly dim.</p>

  <p>Still, she would not be able to break through the rune. Despite that, no one from the Heavenly Evil Sect dared to underestimate her, and her strength as a Life and Death Realm warrior.</p>

  <p>When the life vitality in the rune became depleted, the Illuminating Soul Realm martial artists below would take out life vitality crystals to supplement it. After that, they would continuously send life vitality upwards.</p>

  <p>They didn't need to fight. All they needed to do was to sit, and spend their own life vitality.</p>

  <p>This method of fighting was eerily similar to Luo Zheng's Small Circulation Killing Array. Its primary principle was to use over a thousand small runes to provide energy for a larger, much stronger rune. The division of labor was clear, and its efficiency was increased by tenfold.</p>

  <p>The six Virtual Tribulation Realm martial artists continued to control the life vitality coming from below them. Then, using the rune, they would launch a counterattack at Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>The space inside the rune was several thousand feet long and wide. Ning Yudie was moving around, trying her best to avoid the attacks. Although she was enclosed in such a space, it was clear that it would not be easy for them to kill her.</p>

  <p>And within a short period of time, the two sides were already starting to confront each other.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng rushed over. He had no idea how long Ning Yudie and the Heavenly Evil Sect had been locked in a face-off, but seeing Yudie's miserable state broke his heart into pieces.</p>

  <p>Deep in his heart, he still cared about Ning Yudie a lot.</p>

  <p>To be honest, Ning Yudie held a much more important position in Luo Zheng's heart as compared with Mu Ning. When Luo Luo Zheng got angry earlier, he had contradicted Ning Yudie defiantly. He didn't expect that she would run away in anger.</p>

  <p>More surprisingly, she actually went all the way to such a dangerous place by herself. River Wave City had been occupied by half of the forces of the Heavenly Evil Sect. Even the alliance had avoided the city. 'What were you thinking? Did you really intend to take the city by yourself? Is everything just a game to you now?' Luo Luo Zheng thought as he looked on what was happening.</p>

  <p>It didn't take Tianming, Lewis and Patrick long to arrive. As they saw the scene before them, the expressions on their faces drastically changed.</p>

  <p>"Master Ning! Master Ning is trapped in the rune! Hurry back to Oracle City and call for reinforcements!" Lewis immediately cried out the moment he saw what was happening.</p>

  <p>"It's too late for that," replied Tianming with a cautious look on his face.</p>

  <p>Patrick was also wearing a worried look on his face. As members of Cloud Hall, how could they just stand watching as their head was being attacked in front of them? And worse, she had a high possibility of perishing in front of them!</p>

  <p>At that moment, Luo Luo Zheng said to Tianming and the others, "Guys, please, don't do anything now. Let's just wait for a moment."</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Evil Sect martial artists had used such a special tactic to unleash a power that could even trap Ning Yudie. As Tianming and the rest weren't as strong as Ning Yudie, it was almost sure that they would be killed if they acted on impulse. Thoughts swirled inside Luo Zheng's head. 'How would we deal with this situation?'</p>

  <p>Tianming didn't say anything else. But soon enough, he took out his long sword, closed his eyes and then started to gather all his energy.</p>

  <p>He was fully aware that his combat power was insufficient to deal with the disciples of the Heavenly Evil Sect. The only people he could match with in terms of strength were the warriors at the later stage of the Internal Elixir Realm. But even if he was no match for the warriors at the primary level of the Virtual Tribulation Realm, if he used his Sword Eye to gain momentum, he might have a chance.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Patrick and Lewis braced themselves. They were not any stronger than Tianming, and so all they could do was to stand on his sides with the sole purpose of protecting him. Such a battle was not something that warriors of their level could get involved in.</p>

  <p>As all of these were happening, Luo Luo Zheng started slowly approaching River Wave City. At that time, he was only five or six miles away from the city. Slowly, he raised the message token and said in a low voice, "Tia, I see you."</p>

  <p>While he was speaking, he was looking at Ning Yudie who was still trapped by the rune. A burning attack was just launched against her and fortunately, she was able to dodge it. When she heard Luo Zheng's voice, her head jerked up, and she immediately looked towards his direction. Her face was pained, but she still did not say anything and just continued to attack the rune.</p>

  <p>"I know you heard me," Luo Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>Indeed, Ning Yudie had heard him, but she was just unwilling to talk to him.</p>

  <p>"You don't want to talk to me? Well then, I'm leaving," Luo Luo Zheng said half-jokingly.</p>

  <p>But Ning Yudie once again didn't reply. Instead, he saw that she was once again starting to attack the rune. Unfortunately, the rune looked very stable, and Yudie's attack did not harm it one bit. With an exasperated voice, Ning Yudie suddenly replied, "Just leave. You're no longer a disciple of Cloud Hall. My life or death has nothing to do with you."</p>

  <p>Upon hearing Yudie's words, Luo Luo Zheng couldn't help but sigh. 'This woman is really stubborn, ' he said to himself. His anger was slowly brewing inside him, but he thought for a while and calmed himself down. With a deep breath, he said, "I'm sorry, Tia."</p>
