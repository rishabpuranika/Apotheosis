<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1090 Four Strikes (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Space Chopping Sword was like an invisible venomous snake that charged ferociously towards Willard.</p>

  <p>The expression on Willard's face shifted drastically. He was scared. He had used all his skills as he forcefully swerved in the air. However, the sword was able to graze past his neck and sliced off a large portion of his thick, long hair.</p>

  <p>Instead of showing his disappointment, Willard showed his smiling face.</p>

  <p>After all, he still avoided Logan's second strike.</p>

  <p>"You've dodged the second strike! Well done, Willard!"</p>

  <p>"One more! One more strike to avoid and you will make it!"</p>

  <p>"Come on, Willard! You got this!" the martial artists from the Star Field Divine Kingdom all exclaimed. All of them also knew that Willard was only trying to get past the first three strikes. He knew quite well that more was coming.</p>

  <p>At the top of the steps, the crown prince of the Wind Divine Kingdom who had remained silent for the most part, coldly looked at the cheering martial artists and said, "A bunch of idiots!"</p>

  <p>A lot of other warriors shared the same thoughts as Luo Zheng. What could happen after Willard dodged those three strikes? He couldn't keep up like that. He didn't stand a chance to win.</p>

  <p>Very quickly, Logan launched his third strike.</p>

  <p>The Space Chopping Sword directly swung past Willard's back but was only able to slice a huge cut on his robe. With just one twist of his body, Willard had successfully dodged the third strike. So far, he had not yet been injured.</p>

  <p>"Three strikes! You weren't able to triumph over me in just three strikes!</p>

  <p>You were wrong! You can't defeat me in just three strikes!"</p>

  <p>The joy Willard expressed made it seem as if he had won at that moment.</p>

  <p>He was laughing loudly, and his face lit up with extreme excitement.</p>

  <p>Before he could continue rejoicing, the Space Chopping Sword followed him like a shadow. A trace of Space Chopping Sword passed by and left a straight line right beside where he stood. As the line disappeared, people saw Willard's arm fall off from his body, hitting the ground with a thud. Thick spurts of blood began to gush out of his shoulder.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Willard was too vexed to feel the pain. He glared at Logan with immense disdain and asked, "Didn't you say you'd only use three strikes on me?"</p>

  <p>"Logan broke his words! It was him who announced that the battle shall end in three strikes!"</p>

  <p>"What a cunning bastard! You should be ashamed! Either apologize or kill yourself, Logan!"</p>

  <p>Many Star Field Divine Kingdom warriors joined in. All of them were angered by Logan's rather phony words.</p>

  <p>A sympathetic smile appeared on Logan's face as he said, "Did you hear me say that three strikes will immediately end the battle? You must have been dreaming! I just said I'd take you down in three strikes! Since three strikes didn't suffice, I attacked again. This is a battle. What are you thinking about? Who told you I'm not allowed to do such a thing?"</p>

  <p>Ultimately, the strong ones ruled the world. When Logan mentioned "three strikes", it was some kind of rule he made. And since he made the rule, he could change it any time he pleased. Even if other people didn't approve, they weren't strong enough to disobey.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing his words, the Star Field Divine Kingdom martial artists fell silent. Each and every single one of them had nothing to say at that very moment.</p>

  <p>Logan then turned his head and swept his eyes across the warriors of the Star Field Divine Kingdom and said, "You are too weak! What else can you do apart from causing a commotion down there? If you think you can take on me, come up here! I'm waiting!"</p>

  <p>"Huh! Stop making it sound like you're that strong! Must we remind you that you are only at the late stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm?"</p>

  <p>There were still a few others who remained unconvinced and still chose to argue with him.</p>

  <p>Shaking his head, Logan continued, "I'm not as strong as you think! In fact, I'm pretty weak! In this world, most martial artists are trash like you! My abilities are only slightly higher than yours! And because I'm a little more hardworking than the lot of you are, I have enough reasons to stand out among all of you!"</p>

  <p>When Logan said all those things, everyone was speechless for a moment. At that time, War Emperor York suddenly clapped his hands.</p>

  <p>"Logan! Well said," War Emperor York cheered.</p>

  <p>The reason why the four divine kingdoms were able to exterminate the Dragon Lineage Human was that they had help from the human race in the Upper World.</p>

  <p>Back then, the humans of the Upper World had forcefully opened up a Reverse Spirit Channel in order to help the four divine kingdoms and provide them with assistance.</p>

  <p>It was a historical moment. Unlike the martial artists in the Central Region, those from the four divine kingdoms knew a lot about the Upper World. In the hearts of the hundreds of millions of martial artists in the Central Region, the Upper World was only a vague concept. But for the martial artists of the four divine kingdoms, they had actually witnessed the strength and advantages of the martial artists of the Upper World.</p>

  <p>Although Logan didn't say anything about the warriors of the Upper World, how could the many Virtual Tribulation Realm martial artists not get the implication of his words?</p>

  <p>In front of the martial artists from the four divine kingdoms, he wasn't shy of his pride. However, thinking about the masters in the Upper World humbled him greatly. Only when he was compared to the Upper World talents could he be considered weak.</p>

  <p>Logan's words echoed throughout the inner thoughts of many powerful masters of the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>Those who had lived for ten thousand years shared one great regret in their hearts. All of them weren't able to ascend to the Upper World.</p>

  <p>In the four divine kingdoms, they could undeniably dominate a place.</p>

  <p>But as martial artists, their pursuit was not limited in that continent.</p>

  <p>Moreover, being in the Soul Sea Realm wasn't enough for them.</p>

  <p>Therefore, after living for about ten thousand years, many powerful masters at the Soul Sea Realm had left the Divine Kingdom Continent to search for more opportunities in the endless mysterious seas. They even wanted to find ways to enter other great worlds.</p>

  <p>Up until now, no one at the Soul Sea Realm had succeeded.</p>
