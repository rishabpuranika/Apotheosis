  <p>The interaction between the Mad Scorpion and the Heavenly Immortal Root created strong gales that blew away more than a thousand feet in depth of soil surrounding the chasm.</p>

  <p>With the onslaught of the strong gales, the two-thousand-feet-deep pit that Luo Luo Zheng and his companions had dug turned useless as it only seemed to be like a hundred or so feet against the raging force.</p>

  <p>The group couldn't keep still, so all of them began climbing out of the pit as their hearts pounded wildly. As soon as they slightly emerged out of the pit, they felt their limbs shake as they took in that chaotic scene.</p>

  <p>In great apprehension, they watched the intense battle unfolding above the abyss. They seemed to be musing in unison that being able to survive this kind of havoc was indeed a blessing!</p>

  <p>The Mad Scorpion wildly roared as it rushed straight towards the Heavenly Immortal Root, which was equally savage. Nevertheless, the terrifying and earsplitting sound the Mad Scorpion grumbled did not cause any damage to the Heavenly Immortal Root. Instead, the latter quickly twisted its enormous root, which was as thick as a mountain, and brandished its ugly head to charge aggressively towards the Mad Scorpion.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>A booming sound soon reverberated in the air! That Mad Scorpion's physical attributes were a bit deceiving. It looked huge, creating an impression of being slow and sluggish, but its movements were surprisingly agile.</p>

  <p>Just as the Heavenly Immortal Root reached its head over, the Mad Scorpion's pincer landed on its hideous head with so much precision as a counterattack. The sound of this slap was like hundreds of thunderclaps exploding at the same time.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Luo Luo Zheng and the others could only temporarily shut off their hearings with their skills. Otherwise, the sound of the slap would surely damage their hearing abilities.</p>

  <p>Roar!</p>

  <p>After being assailed, the Heavenly Immortal Root turned its head again as if nothing happened and continued to rush towards its opponent. But then another attack from the Mad Scorpion followed.</p>

  <p>That slap was so terrifyingly powerful that if it landed on the Sea God Continent, it would surely destroy even a mountain range.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>After a series of continuous slaps, the incomparably ferocious Heavenly Immortal Root finally succumbed to its defeat against the Mad Scorpion.</p>

  <p>Xun glanced at Luo Luo Zheng and told him with her life vitality, "The Heavenly Immortal Root is nothing but only a type of vegetable."</p>

  <p>"Vegetable?" Luo Zheng's eyes were fixated on the battle between the giant monsters as he repeated it in a daze.</p>

  <p>"Right. It's a type of vegetable used to feed super legendary beasts. If you don't believe me, you can ask the cyan dragon in your mind," Xun said with a smile.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was indeed a bit curious, so he asked, "Man, is that so?"</p>

  <p>"Don't listen to her nonsense! You know, strong warriors like me don't need to eat anything." The cyan dragon, however, wasn't willing to admit it.</p>

  <p>"But you needed to eat before you became strong. What did you eat then?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng teasingly asked. He could tell that the cyan dragon didn't want to admit it.</p>

  <p>"I didn't eat it before!" The cyan dragon chuckled and denied it. "The Genuine Dragon World is rich in resources. Although the Heavenly Immortal Root is nutritious, its taste is horrible. Only the Mad Scorpion can endure that peculiar taste. We Genuine Dragons would never eat it. It looks so hideous!"</p>

  <p>The sizes of an ordinary legendary beast and the flood dragon puppet, which was seen by Luo Luo Zheng previously, were almost the same. And this was considered normal. On the contrary, a super legendary beast could grow as large as a continent. And that would mean food must be in abundance!</p>

  <p>Super legendary beasts could prey on each other. But none of them was weak. Besides, they were only a minority. As a result, even though they were all on top of the food chain, food was still scarce for them. They could hardly find sustenance to make them strong enough and to reach the stage where they didn't need to eat anything.</p>

  <p>As a result, most super legendary beasts relied on vegetables to grow up.</p>

  <p>Such a huge Heavenly Immortal Root was one of the food for these huge fierce beasts.</p>

  <p>Soon, the Heavenly Immortal Root was subdued by the Mad Scorpion. The Mad Scorpion stretched out its claws, strangled the root, and opened its huge mouth.</p>

  <p>"What do we do now?" Luo Luo Zheng looked expectantly at Yolande, waiting for her answer.</p>

  <p>Everyone stared pitifully at Yolande. They were also frightened by what was happening in front of them. Even though Fabian, Esther, and the others had gone through the cultivation of the Gate of Samsara, their emotions were still in disarray now. Such fight between the Mad Scorpion and the Heavenly Immortal Root was just too horrifying and appalling!</p>

  <p>Yolande had agreed in her own accord to lead everyone out of the fog, but they didn't expect her to take them to such a dangerous place. What was going on? They had no idea at all.</p>

  <p>"Everyone, grab Luo Luo Zheng!" Yolande stretched out her hands nimbly and seized hold of Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Not understanding the meaning behind her words, Luo Luo Zheng wore a strange expression as he gazed at Yolande.</p>

  <p>The others didn't understand either, but they still followed Yolande's orders hastily as if it was a conditioned reflex.</p>

  <p>Esther also stretched out her hands and clutched Luo Zheng's arm. The other top-level war lords also quickly grabbed hold of him.</p>

  <p>Malcom's reaction wasn't slow either as he clasped Luo Zheng's neck.</p>

  <p>"Hey, hey!" Luo Luo Zheng felt uncomfortable being firmly grasped by them like this, but his resistance was useless. The others continued to clasp him tightly as if they would lose their lives once they let him go.</p>

  <p>Rehaan was the last to react. When he started moving, Luo Luo Zheng had already been tightly encircled by everyone, and there was no place on Luo Luo Zheng for him to grab anymore. Without any other choice, he could only hug Malcom tightly.</p>

  <p>If he couldn't get hold of Luo Luo Zheng, then clinging to Malcom was also a choice.</p>

  <p>Xun directly stuffed the long spear into Luo Zheng's space ring, then immediately transformed into small light spots and flew into Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>Soon after they were all ready, they heard the sound of the wind blowing.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A huge attraction force was released from the Mad Scorpion's mouth.</p>

  <p>Like the gales they had just experienced, they could not resist this attractive force. It was way beyond their abilities.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, everyone's feet left the ground, and they were directly pulled towards the sky above the chasm. Everyone held onto Luo Luo Zheng tightly as they rolled around in the air and flew towards the Mad Scorpion's mouth.</p>

  <p>"What's going on?"</p>

  <p>Malcom was shocked and furious. He roared at Yolande angrily. He had never expected that she would have them be sucked into the Mad Scorpion's mouth. Wasn't this courting death?</p>

  <p>"Yolande, what is going on?" Even Esther, who had always been calm, had a long face right now.</p>

  <p>If they only had continued to dig underground and hid in the pit, they could have completely avoided being sucked into the Mad Scorpion's mouth. If the Mad Scorpion swallowed them in one gulp, they would be dead for sure.</p>

  <p>Fabian also cried out with a sad face, "We're dead for sure this time.</p>

  <p>Yolande, didn't you say you'd take us out of the fog? Why are we going to be sucked into that monster's mouth?"</p>

  <p>Yolande blinked her eyes. At the questioning of the crowd, her expression did not change at all. Instead, she said indifferently, "If you want to leave the fog, you must enter its mouth. I did nothing wrong. It is my plan."</p>

  <p>"Can you at least tell us first?" Jarrod said with a conflicted expression as he tightly hugged Luo Zheng's arm.</p>

  <p>"There's no need for that. If you do what I tell you, you might not die. But if you don't do what I tell you, you will definitely die!" Yolande blinked and turned her head to the side, sniffing Luo Zheng's chest. She still had time to smell Luo Zheng's scent! What a crazy woman!</p>

  <p>"Hey, guys. Can you be gentler? My bones are about to break!" Luo Luo Zheng interjected with a bitter smile.</p>

  <p>How could they be willing to listen to Luo Luo Zheng? As soon as they let him go, they would immediately be shot to death by the Dark Nether Death Light. So naturally, everyone held onto Luo Luo Zheng tightly for their dear lives! The group danced and dangled in the air, quickly revolving and being sucked into the Mad Scorpion's big mouth. They felt dreadful as they witnessed the Heavenly Immortal Root being sucked into its big mouth, piece by piece.</p>

  <p>For the Heavenly Immortal Root, the Mad Scorpion's mouth could be called simply as a mouth. However, to Luo Luo Zheng and the others, it was like a huge cave that was tens of thousands of feet high. Even if ten mountain ranges were placed side by side, they could still be stuffed easily into the mouth of the Mad Scorpion.</p>

  <p>As far as the Mad Scorpion was concerned, Luo Zheng's group could not even be considered ants or dust. They were merely close to nothingness. It was more likely that they didn't exist in the Mad Scorpion's line of sight.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>A few ten feet wide boulders were also sucked over by the Mad Scorpion.</p>

  <p>Some of the boulders directly smashed into Luo Luo Zheng and the others. However, before the boulders could hit them, they were immediately broken by Yolande's and the others' attacks.</p>

  <p>After flying above the chasm for a while, they were eventually pulled inside the Mad Scorpion's mouth. At that precise moment, the life vitality within everyone's body suddenly disappeared strangely. As for Malcom and Rehaan, their expressions changed greatly. The forceful energy within their bodies had also vanished!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, who possessed both the life vitality and the forceful energy, found himself in the same situation. Whether it was life vitality or forceful energy, both faded without a trace at the same time.</p>

  <p>Earlier, when they were constantly being tossed around in the sky, they were still able to rely on their life vitality or forceful energy to stabilize their bodies. But now, their life vitality or forceful energy had strangely disappeared. They soon found themselves suddenly being blown around by the turbulent winds, falling heavily into the darkness.</p>
