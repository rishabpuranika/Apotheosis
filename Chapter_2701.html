<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Godly Way Tablets had always been regarded as cultivation resources in the divine land.</p>

  <p>And apart from a tiny number of the three thousand Godly Way Tablets, the rest of them were controlled by all sorts of forces.</p>

  <p>The Thunderstorm Godly Way Tablet was under the control of the Fang Clan, which had a powerful Floating Island above the Time Sea. No outsiders dared object to this.</p>

  <p>But a few Godly Way Tablets were occupied by some first tier and even second tier clans.</p>

  <p>Other clans were envious of the profit that the Godly Way Tablets had brought. It would obviously cause disputes. Wars, even.</p>

  <p>A few hours later...</p>

  <p>The jungle that had seemed so endless to Luo Zheng disappeared suddenly, replaced by a mysterious grassland.</p>

  <p>Lush green grass grew at an incredible speed, and then withered and turned yellow just as quickly. And then, from the dead grass, new grass continued to sprout, and the cycle repeated over and over again.</p>

  <p>The entire expanse of this grassland constantly turned from green to yellow, and yellow to green in a circle.</p>

  <p>"Ordinary grass usually flourishes and withers once every year. But the grass here flourishes and withers so quickly!" Luo Zheng muttered as he stared at the grassland.</p>

  <p>This looked magical, but on second thought, Luo Zheng understood the meaning of all this.</p>

  <p>This place derived its power from the Life Godly Way Tablet. The grass grew faster than normal since it was driven by the life force. This was also why it reached the end of its life ahead of time and withered rapidly.</p>

  <p>Not long after he walked along the grassland, a huge cyan-colored stone tablet appeared in the distance.</p>

  <p>This powerful life force was so strong that it was showing its effect on Luo Zheng even from such a distance.</p>

  <p>On the other side of this first stone tablet, stood another huge stone tablet. It was the Cyan Wood Godly Way Tablet, and on the other side of this Cyan Wood Godly Way Tablet stood a row of lush trees.</p>

  <p>These two Godly Way Tablets were only a thousand feet apart.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng wasn't surprised. The Infinity Ruler had created a scene that lingered in his mind, in which the two Godly Way Tablets were close to each other.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had previously thought that if these two Godly Way Tablets were to have people guarding them, he would give them some divine might coins to get closer.</p>

  <p>And then once he finished absorbing the two Divine Dao, he could make a quick exit.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng looked surprised as he got near to the Godly Way Tablets.</p>

  <p>There was not a single True God around these two Godly Way Tablets.</p>

  <p>Previously, there had been quite a few True Gods around the Thunderstorm Godly Way Tablet, and the Fang Clan had specially sent people to guard it.</p>

  <p>There were many martial artists practicing the Life Godly Way and the Cyan Wood Godly Way in the divine land. It was hard to believe that no one had come to comprehend them. It seemed almost illogical.</p>

  <p>But a voice rang out just as Luo Zheng approached the Godly Way Tablets.</p>

  <p>"Outsiders are not allowed to approach the Godly Way Tablets. Get out of here if you don't want to die!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng frowned.</p>

  <p>The sound emanated from the ground, but there was no True God lurking there.</p>

  <p>Thanks to Luo Zheng's powerful soul, even consummate True Gods could not escape his detection. And this warning seemed strange to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did not heed this warning. Instead, he continued to approach the Godly Way Tablets.</p>

  <p>"One more step and you will die!"</p>

  <p>The warning rang out again.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stared at the green grass below him. He muttered, "It looks like someone is using the grass to send these messages."</p>

  <p>The actual person who was speaking these warnings wasn't hiding here.</p>

  <p>They were only using the Vegetation Voice Transmission, a theurgy of the Cyan Wood Godly Way, to transmit their voice through the vegetation around Luo Zheng. It was only a small trick.</p>

  <p>"I am just observing the Godly Way Tablets. I will do nothing harmful,"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>He then approached the Godly Way Tablets calmly.</p>

  <p>To his surprise, the moment he took a step forward, he felt a wave emerging and rolling off the ground.</p>

  <p>Rumble...</p>

  <p>Long wooden sticks with sharp thorns on them popped out of the soil and came zooming towards Luo Zheng one after the other.</p>

  <p>The thorns on these long wooden sticks glowed with a faint green light.</p>

  <p>They looked toxic.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's body became a flash as he dodged these thorny sticks with ease.</p>

  <p>He wasn't afraid of these sticks, nor of the poison on the thorns. But the fact that whoever was attacking was doing so without investigating still made him furious.</p>

  <p>"I said I just wanted to observe the Godly Way Tablets. If you still want to attack me, don't blame me for retaliating!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had barely finished talking when more thorny sticks broke through the earth and came straight for him.</p>

  <p>His eyes flashed as he twisted his body and threw himself at these sticks.</p>

  <p>He suddenly fell, cutting through the air.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The thorny sticks hadn't caused any harm to Luo Zheng when they had touched him.</p>

  <p>Instead, they had all broken clean, and Luo Zheng parted through the broken pieces to fall.</p>

  <p>The moment Luo Zheng landed, a powerful force poured into the ground.</p>

  <p>The soil here was soft, and Luo Zheng's force had now created a huge crater a thousand feet wide. The ground around it seemed to ripple, spreading with each passing minute.</p>

  <p>And then, the entire place seemed to sink into silence.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng glanced at the Godly Way Tablets and walked forward again.</p>

  <p>This time, he saw that there were a number of cyan arrows flying towards him from the distant forest.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng said, finally somewhat annoyed.</p>

  <p>In a flash, Luo Zheng moved to the front of the jungle.</p>

  <p>As he pulled out his sword, it formed a sword radiance that was ten thousand feet wide. It shot forward with a mighty rumble.</p>

  <p>The sword light cut off tens of thousands of towering trees as it flew.</p>

  <p>It traveled for miles around, causing a countless number of towering trees to collapse. It looked like a complete mess!</p>

  <p>Screams emerged from the mess that these fallen trees had created, with people constantly flying past them.</p>

  <p>These people were fast, and they used the Wood Invisible Theurgy of the Cyan Wood Godly Way to blend in with the trees. But they still couldn't escape Luo Zheng's perception.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng glanced over the forest with his spiritual sense and was surprised.</p>

  <p>Thousands of True Gods were hidden in there. It looked like it was a big clan.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't want to kill too many people and commit a sin for no reason.</p>

  <p>He only wanted to teach these guys a little lesson.</p>

  <p>But just as he turned around to approach the Godly Way Tablets, a voice from the jungle sounded out. "The warrior sent by the Mo Clan is too powerful! Let's fight it out with all our might! Form the Cyan Tree Array to suppress him!"</p>

  <p>The moment the voice had faded away, bits of cyan light shot up into the sky. The True Gods hiding in the forest had collectively released their internal momentum.</p>

  <p>These streams of internal momentum connected with each other and formed a mysterious array.</p>

  <p>The forest was now integrated into one whole with the connection of the internal momentum and had now turned into a huge beast.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was finally a little flustered, now that he was facing the pressure of the surging internal momentum. According to what he had heard, it seemed that he had been mistaken for the enemy that the Mo Clan had sent here.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was not afraid of the Cyan Tree Array. But he knew that once the opponents formed an array, it meant trouble for him.</p>
