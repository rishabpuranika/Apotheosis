<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The old man couldn't help but rub his forehead, trying to figure out just what happened to Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>His wife was the supreme master of the Purple Power World and countless warriors would kill to become her disciples. Mu Ning, however, was different. He was actually the one who tried his best to convince her to cultivate and become his wife's disciple. It took him so long to persuade the young lady and she had finally agreed!</p>

  <p>He also had wanted to say something to Luo Luo Zheng but it wouldn't be appropriate given the context of the situation, so he could only put it aside for now.</p>

  <p>The celebration lasted for hours with festivities going on well into the night. It was very late when the guests finally departed, leaving the Cloud Hall in silence once again.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie sat stiffly on the bed, the sheets underneath made of exquisite golden silk and brown cocoon fibre. It felt like soft, buttery clouds underneath her touch.</p>

  <p>In this world, an ordinary girl was normally married at the age of fourteen or fifteen. Ning Yudie was by no means old, but it was true that she had married a bit late compared to other mortal girls.</p>

  <p>She was also a virgin, which naturally made her nervous and also a bit frightened.</p>

  <p>The discomfort made her chatty, constantly finding random stuff to talk about with her new husband. "Who was that old man we met today?" she asked in a hushed voice.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng shook his head and smiled. "I'm not sure."</p>

  <p>The old man had made no effort to reveal his identity, but he stayed in Cloud Hall for the meantime. Luo Luo Zheng roughly guessed that he was someone powerful, maybe even a master sent by the Celestial Position. Or perhaps he was from the human race. After all, he knew Derek would have surely reported his information to the Upper World.</p>

  <p>Yudie's bright eyes widened. "You're not sure who he is? Then why did you take his pill?" Her expression was stern but the playfulness in her tone made her look adorable.</p>

  <p>Her face tugged on Luo Zheng's heartstrings as he sat down next to her. "You also saw him feed it to me so?"</p>

  <p>It was true that he didn't know what that pill was for but his body remained the same. There was no reaction so far so maybe it still hadn't taken effect. Luo Luo Zheng would have to wait to find out what effect the pill that old man gave him would have.</p>

  <p>"Do you feel uncomfortable?" she asked, turning her face to look at him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng gently pulled her into his arms. "No," he murmured softly, lifting her chin so that he might have easier access to her lips.</p>

  <p>Only when Luo Luo Zheng was close enough did she realize what he was trying to do. "You!" she exclaimed but she did not struggle. The proximity made her heart race but she wasn't sure if it was from hesitation or anticipation.</p>

  <p>Still, she figured she wouldn't have any reason to struggle tonight so she decided to curl up like an obedient lamb.</p>

  <p>The dim room was bathed by the light of a single candle, casting a sensual, romantic mood between the two lovers. The golden silk was soft and light between their two bodies and the tell-tale fragrance of love was heavy in the air.</p>

  <p>The two had a very wonderful night, but the same could not be said for Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>The Light of Water rippled above her and the dark clouds hid the beams of the waning moon. She was in an awfully bad mood and the melancholic night sky was not helping.</p>

  <p>"Caw," the Ancestral Dragon cried out. It was normally very energetic but it somehow sensed Xi Youqin's unhappiness. It only cawed every now and then but did not dare misbehave.</p>

  <p>"This place isn't fun," Mu Ning said, rubbing her shoulders for warmth in the cold night. The Ancestral Dragon tilted its head at her in curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Want me to bring you somewhere interesting?"</p>

  <p>"Caw!" It did not refuse at all and was very eager with Xi Youqin's proposal. The Ancestral Dragon might have built an initially close relationship with Luo Luo Zheng because of the imprinting but after being taken care of by Mu Ning, the dragon seemed to have grown closer to the young woman.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning stood up. "Let's go then," she said, opening her arms and allowing the Ancestral Dragon to happily jump in her embrace.</p>

  <p>A purple haze surrounded Mu Ning and coiled around her body while her eyes glowed a dim purple. The purple smoke slowly enveloped her until her entire body disappeared and stepped into the Purple Power World.</p>

  <p>The old man had told her that once she entered the Purple Power World, his wife would be sure to find her. She wanted to test that out now for herself.</p>

  <p>The Purple Power World, contrary to its name, was not a complete world but a shattered one.</p>

  <p>However, despite its state, it was still significantly bigger than the great world.</p>

  <p>"Caw! Caw!" the Ancestral Dragon cried out with glee once it entered the Purple Power World, seemingly pleased with what it saw. It circled around the vast, limitless space and constantly let out its lively caws.</p>

  <p>The Purple Power World was big and empty but Mu Ning wasn't scared of anything at all. This place gave her a sense of security, as if she belonged here and it belonged to her.</p>

  <p>She looked around for a bit before sighing, "The old man told me that someone would take me in as her disciple. Did he lie to me?" She curled her lips, unhappy with the possibility of having been fooled.</p>

  <p>She was initially averse to cultivating. However, Luo Luo Zheng made her think otherwise. She imagined a wonderful future with him where she could stand proudly at his side once he rose to the top of the universe. It would be her greatest happiness if she managed to help him reach his goals and fulfill his destiny.</p>

  <p>The urge to cultivate as soon as possible was driven by her excessive need to stay by his side.</p>

  <p>'By then, I'll be a thousand times stronger than you, ' she thought in confidence as she imagined Ning Yudie in a red dress, facing her as an enemy.</p>

  <p>'Cultivate! I want to cultivate too!</p>

  <p>Even if my master doesn't appear, I will still cultivate, ' she thought in determination. A firm and resolute expression appeared in her eyes, signifying her strong commitment to walk the path of a warrior for love.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh..."</p>

  <p>With a light wave of her hand, a gigantic sword descended from the sky.</p>

  <p>"A sword..."</p>

  <p>"Whoosh..."</p>

  <p>"Two swords..."</p>

  <p>"Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh..."</p>

  <p>Countless gigantic swords were summoned and descended upon the Purple Power World.</p>

  <p>These nine hundred and ninety-nine swords were densely packed in the sky, arranged by a certain order. These swords would normally disappear and return to their original positions after slashing down.</p>

  <p>However, Mu Ning was currently in the Purple Power World and her summoned swords did not return to their original positions.</p>

  <p>These swords were controlled by warriors from different sky regions of the Purple Power World.</p>

  <p>In the Southern Sky Region, a large ship decked in precious jewels glided in the sky. At the bow of the ship stood a woman, seemingly around 30 years old and still charming with her fair, exquisite face.</p>

  <p>Her purple robe floated elegantly around her figure as the wind whooshed past the ship. However, this serene image was quickly interrupted by the sight of huge swords dropping rapidly from the sky.</p>

  <p>The woman frowned. "What's going on?"</p>

  <p>The gigantic swords of the Purple Power World had the ability to penetrate space and arrive at their destination in an instant. This could be considered as a type of Law of Causality so that no matter where a warrior was, in this world or another, they could make use of these swords so long as they had the Purple Power Body.</p>
