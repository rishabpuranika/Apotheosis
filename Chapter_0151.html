  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was confused about the silver particles.</p>

  <p>Curious, Luo Luo Zheng tried to look them up in the weapon refining methods left by Evil Lan, but he got nothing about them.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng assumed if Evil Lan were a better weapon refiner, he would have written about it in his weapon refining methods.</p>

  <p>In C County, Evil Lan had been regarded as a superior weapon refiner, but compared with the refiners in Imperial Capital, he was just so so.</p>

  <p>So many people in the auction house desired to get the heavenly essence, which got Luo Luo Zheng further perplexed by what it was and its purpose.</p>

  <p>Were these silver droplets really so valuable?</p>

  <p>"23, 000 cubic crystals! I will take the heavenly essence!" An old man cried out. His hair was white, but his ruddy face gave him an energetic appearance.</p>

  <p>"Aha, Huang! You cannot have sole ownership of these heavenly essence drops. I offer a price of 25, 000 cubic crystals!" A muffled voice came from an old man with a black face.</p>

  <p>The old man with the ruddy face frowned and said, "Joah Yu, I shall get the heavenly essence. So don't compete with me today!"</p>

  <p>The two men stood and glared at each other, which lent tension to the atmosphere in the auction house.</p>

  <p>In the room, Nory said, "As to these two old men, one's surname is Huang, and the other is Yu. so one must come from the Huang Clan, and the other must be from the Yu Clan. Both clans enjoy a high reputation in Imperial Capital as they are listed among the seven prestigious noble clans. Since they are both determined to buy the heavenly essence, you can expect the final price to be unrealistically high."</p>

  <p>Money wasn't a problem for any member of the top seven noble clans.</p>

  <p>The two old men seemed to be venerable with high prestige in the noble clans. Thus, they could scramble for the heavenly essence at any cost if they really wanted to do so.</p>

  <p>However, although the Huang Clan and the Yu Clan were prominent, other more powerful clans were also present at the auction.</p>

  <p>Apart from these two old men, many people were unwilling to give up the opportunity to acquire the heavenly essence.</p>

  <p>At that time, Luo Luo Zheng gaped at the auction block.</p>

  <p>"What is the heavenly essence? Why is it so valuable? Why do so many people want to get it?" Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Nory laughed and said, "I have often considered that you were knowledgeable enough to know everything. But now, you seem somewhat ignorant as you don't know what heavenly essence is!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng shook his head. Although he had read some books on weapon refining, he had never come across any mention of heavenly essence.</p>

  <p>The first time that he saw it was when the black fire in his head refined the weapon.</p>

  <p>To show off his knowledge, Nory cleared his throat and said, "Several years ago, some people discovered heavenly essence. But do you know how weapon refiners can make mysterious weapons, spiritual weapons, and even fairy weapons? That is because when they are refining, they put some heavenly essence into the weapons. In other words, the more powerful the weapon is, the more heavenly essence it contains!"</p>

  <p>So that was it.......?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng seemed to understand.</p>

  <p>The iron essence Luo Luo Zheng had swallowed could be related to heavenly essence.</p>

  <p>The scales of the cyan dragon mold in his head could be brightened as soon as he swallowed the heavenly essence.</p>

  <p>There were 5 to 6 droplets of heavenly essence in a good quality mysterious weapon. So to some extent, heavenly essence shouldn't be so valuable. Why did such a little bottle of heavenly essence cost tens of thousands of cubic crystals? What was more, the final price of the transaction seemed to be much higher!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng questioned.</p>

  <p>Nory smiled and said, "Yes, it's true. Normally, all known weapons and even the low-grade ones contain heavenly essence. But no one can extract heavenly essence from any weapon. People have tried all sorts of ways including burning and breaking weapons down. And that is why, once heavenly essence appears, several people will clamor to buy it. And that's why the price goes higher and higher......."</p>

  <p>"Since no one can extract it, how come it is here at the auction?" Luo Luo Zheng asked, pointing at the heavenly essence in Nestor's hand.</p>

  <p>Nory shrugged his shoulders and said, "I don't know. Perhaps some people are lucky enough to find heavenly essence by chance!"</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng learned more about heavenly essence from Nory, the price of the heavenly essence at the auction soared!</p>

  <p>The basic price had been 20, 000 cubic crystals. However, it had now risen to 80, 000!</p>

  <p>More than 100, 000 cubic crystals was a significant spend even for a big noble clan.</p>

  <p>However, the two old men showed no intention of stopping. Instead, they became more determined to bid for the heavenly essence. Furthermore, other people tried to bid with them now and then.</p>

  <p>Finally, the 50 droplets of heavenly essence were taken by Mr. Huang from the Huang Clan at a price of 120, 000 cubic crystals.</p>

  <p>120, 000 cubic crystals could buy 50 droplets of heavenly essence.......</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng began thinking.</p>

  <p>It cost about 100 cubic crystals to buy a top-grade mysterious weapon.</p>

  <p>Only about 5 droplets of heavenly essence could be extracted from a top-grade mysterious weapon.</p>

  <p>10 top-grade mysterious weapons would cost 1, 000 cubic crystals. From these, 50 droplets of heavenly essence could be refined.</p>

  <p>If the cyan dragon could consume the 50 droplets of heavenly essence, 10 dragon scales would be lit up.</p>

  <p>But if the 50 droplets of heavenly essence were sold then 100, 000 cubic crystals would be earned.</p>

  <p>For Luo Luo Zheng, it would be a harmless transaction, which could bring him tremendous wealth.</p>

  <p>If everything went smoothly, Luo Luo Zheng could possess considerable wealth in a short time, and the cubic crystals could be exchanged for enough points to save Yan.</p>

  <p>For a moment, Luo Luo Zheng was so excited that he was in no mood to pay attention to what was happening at the auction. It was not until Nestor took out the crystal core of the fire scorpion lion did Luo Luo Zheng realize that it was time for his object to go under the hammer.</p>

  <p>The crystal core of the fire scorpion lion was placed for sale after the heavenly essence. That indicated that the crystal core of the fire scorpion lion was much more valuable than the heavenly essence.</p>

  <p>That was true.</p>

  <p>The auction room became unusually crowded the moment the crystal core of the fire scorpion lion was brought out.</p>

  <p>Compared with the heavenly essence, people seemed to be more interested in the crystal core of the fire scorpion lion. After all, there had been no mature crystal core of the fire scorpion lion for many years in the market.</p>

  <p>However, the final hammer price of the crystal core of the fire scorpion lion was a little disappointing for Luo Luo Zheng. Although it sold for 70, 000 cubic crystals, which was higher than the basic price Nestor had quoted, the crystal core of the fire scorpion lion was sold at a rate much cheaper than the heavenly essence.</p>

  <p>That was because the Huang Clan had bought the heavenly essence, and Mr. Huang had already spent a significant amount on the heavenly essence. So he didn't bid for the crystal core of the fire scorpion lion. Mr.</p>

  <p>Yu from the Yu Clan had bought the crystal core of the fire scorpion lion.</p>

  <p>'70, 000 cubic crystals is enough! Deducting the commission given to the Blessed Auction House and the cost of the book, Weapon Refining Principle, I can get about 40, 000 cubic crystals and more importantly, I have learned the function of the heavenly essence!'</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng was thinking about that, the auction at the Blessed Auction House ended.</p>

  <p>And the people there began to leave quickly.</p>

  <p>The only people still at the auction house were the ones who stayed to change their money into the goods for which they had bid.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng just stood, he saw a young man dressed in silk walking toward him with a smile. Beside the young man was the charming woman who had visited Luo Luo Zheng in his room.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng understood that the man was Fren, who was always ready to trouble him and had even tried to hire people to kill him!</p>

  <p>Fren gestured at Luo Luo Zheng and then grinned wickedly.</p>

  <p>Without any fear, Luo Luo Zheng pointed at Fren and sneered.</p>

  <p>Tit for tat!</p>

  <p>The people who saw this scene could only sigh silently.</p>

  <p>If the two men were at the same level, their hostility toward each other could be regarded as tit for tat.</p>

  <p>However, the man in the room was only a half-step into the nature level!</p>

  <p>What made him so arrogant? He dared to confront Fren! Was he crazy?</p>

  <p>Or did he have a powerful backer?</p>

  <p>Somehow, Fren was a little confused......</p>

  <p>This was supposed to be his first time meeting Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Even if Fren was being unreasonable, why did Luo Luo Zheng think he could do the same? After all, Fren was more powerful than Luo Luo Zheng! Fren couldn't figure it out.</p>

  <p>At that moment, a servant dressed in the uniform of Fren's clan came up.</p>

  <p>"I asked you to investigate. Did you get the result?" Fren asked.</p>

  <p>"My young master, the boy's name is  Luo Luo Zheng Luo."</p>
