<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1991 A Queen's Order </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>This team consisted of over three thousand warriors and had close to a thousand world lords.</p>

  <p>Most were at the Spirit Transformation Realm. Amber was actually the one with the lowest cultivation amongst everyone present. There were also two grand world lords.</p>

  <p>Of course, the one with the highest cultivation was Supreme Lord Leroy who served as their leader.</p>

  <p>The Purple Cloud Sacred Place couldn't hide their shock when they saw them approach.</p>

  <p>Even in the entire Demon Night race, a group of over a thousand world lords was definitely not a small power.</p>

  <p>Every world lord had the qualifications to become a Saint Lord of a tenth-grade sacred place. The Purple Cloud Sacred Place was nothing in the eyes of these people, so their unease was understandable.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Not long after, the three thousand warriors slowly descended upon the Purple Cloud Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>Seeing such a strong force arrive in front of their doorstep, Loraine, the sacred place's Saint Lord bowed. "I am Loraine, the Saint Lord of the Purple Cloud Sacred Place. We humbly welcome you!"</p>

  <p>The elders behind her also came forward to pay their respects.</p>

  <p>"These people's auras are so strong!"</p>

  <p>"They're all world lords after all."</p>

  <p>"What is that old man's cultivation level? The one in the lead? He seems to be their leader. Could he also be a grand world lord?"</p>

  <p>The Demon Night warriors gossiped amongst themselves in lowered voices, but did that really help given how sensitive the eyes and ears of these warriors were? These people could hear an insect's chirp from tens of miles away. Loraine blushed in embarrassment when she heard her warriors' conversation. She quickly turned her head and shushed them.</p>

  <p>"Silence!"</p>

  <p>Everyone quickly shut up under the Saint Lord's order. Now, the only sound that could be heard was the fluttering descent of snowflakes upon the ground.</p>

  <p>Loraine looked back at Supreme Lord Leroy with a look of utter bewilderment.</p>

  <p>All the Demon Night members were very familiar with their three queens. Whether it be by appearance or Mu Ning, all were very familiar with those three supreme rulers whom they had worshipped since their childhood.</p>

  <p>However, it was different for Supreme Lords. Most Demon Night members only heard about their names, but had no idea what their faces looked like.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the disparity between a Supreme Lord and a grand world lord wasn't in terms of cultivation but of Heavenly Destiny.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, Supreme Lord Leroy had hidden himself for so many years. It was only normal for Loraine to not recognize him.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, most of the Demon Night members' gazes lingered on Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Why was there a human here? Weren't the Demon Night warriors against humans now? Could he be a prisoner? It didn't seem like it.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Leroy did not waste any more time. He calmly swept his gaze amongst the crowd and voiced out his order. "I want to use the queens' statues."</p>

  <p>Loraine and the elders were taken aback at his request. The place where the statues were located was at the center of each Demon Night sacred place. All statues connected with each other and were only used for the most urgent of matters. What did these people want with their queens' statues?</p>

  <p>Unable to refuse these powerful warriors, Loraine could only ask about their background. "May I ask who you are? Which of the six sects do you belong to?"</p>

  <p>Only the six great sects would've been able to gather such a mighty force. However, all six already accompanied the two queens into battle in the ogres' supreme worlds. Who were these people then? Why did they appear here?</p>

  <p>"Saint Spear Sect," Supreme Lord Leroy replied calmly.</p>

  <p>"Saint Spear Sect?" Loraine repeated in astonishment. Her strength wasn't that impressive but she was still a Saint Lord who was entitled to some information. As far as she knew, the Saint Spear Sect had already fallen.</p>

  <p>"I am Leroy," Supreme Lord Leroy added.</p>

  <p>Saint Spear Sect, Leroy...</p>

  <p>"Huh?" Loraine's entire body froze.</p>

  <p>It wasn't just her. Most of the elders also looked as if they had seen a ghost. Supreme Lord Leroy had disappeared for such a long time that the Demon Night race actually forgot that he existed in the first place. Some warrior poked another in the waist and mumbled in a small voice,</p>

  <p>"Supreme Lord Leroy."</p>

  <p>"Supreme Lord Leroy!"</p>

  <p>Loraine announced in realization, bending down on one knee to salute him.</p>

  <p>The elders naturally followed suit.</p>

  <p>Regardless of rank, a Supreme Lord stood in front of them and it was only proper that they gave him the due respect to him. Only the three queens and the Supreme Lords had this privilege in the Demon Night race.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Leroy nodded appreciatively. "Get up and bring us to the queens' statues!"</p>

  <p>Loraine stood up and cupped her hands in respect. "Please follow me!"</p>

  <p>She quickly turned and led the way. Luo Luo Zheng, Amber, and Abby followed closely behind her with the three thousand Demon Night warriors in tow.</p>

  <p>The Saint Lord couldn't help but sweat nervously as she led them to the statues.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Leroy was gone for so many years. The Demon Night race knew it was mostly because of the conflict between the two queens.</p>

  <p>Yao had declared him to be a traitor. Now that he was here, Loraine did not have the slightest idea as to what to do.</p>

  <p>If the Purple Cloud Sacred Place got embroiled into the conflict in the upper echelons, then they would most probably suffer.</p>

  <p>However, Loraine quickly shook this thought away from her mind. No matter the outcome, it wasn't anything she or her eighth-grade sacred place could control.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, the entourage arrived at the Purple Cloud Sacred Place's holy tree.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng couldn't help but notice how similar this holy tree was to the one he saw on the Sea God Continent. The only difference was that this one looked more majestic.</p>

  <p>In the middle of the hall were three gigantic statues. Each statue was translucent and golden in color as if made from the most exquisite amber. The Demon Night had various sacred places and each one had its own unique statues made of the best materials that sacred place could gather.</p>

  <p>With her job done, Loraine quickly stood to the side and watched whatever Supreme Lord Leroy and his group sought to do.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng noticed nothing abnormal with Xun's statue. When she erased the Soul-sealing Needle, the damage her soul took wasn't that great.</p>

  <p>However, what was most troublesome was that all her memories had been erased.</p>

  <p>Soul damage would've been an easier problem to fix. The Celestial Position race was always at the ready to help him.</p>

  <p>However, that couldn't be said for memories. As of right now, Luo Luo Zheng still had no idea how to fix this for Xun.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Leroy took a good look at Xun's statue before turning to Luo Luo Zheng. "Prepare yourself. What we are going to do will no doubt cause a huge commotion within the Demon Night race."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded. "I'm ready."</p>

  <p>Whatever they needed to do, be it a small action against the Demon Night race or a decisive battle against the Sacred race, all would be a step closer towards the end.</p>

  <p>What he needed to do was face them head-on without any sort of hesitation.</p>

  <p>'Cause a huge commotion? What is Supreme Lord Leroy going to do?'</p>

  <p>Loraine wondered nervously.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Leroy reached out and placed his hand on the forehead of Xun's statue.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>The statue began to emit a faint, demonic red light as if it had suddenly come to life.</p>

  <p>At the same time, all the statues of the Queen of Killings in all of the Demon Night race's sacred places, whether it be in the Upper or Lower world, began to tremble.</p>

  <p>These statues were made of various materials: rock, gold, crystal, wood, bronze... Yet at that moment, all of them released a demonic red light.</p>

  <p>In addition to the statues in the sacred places, there were also two squads, led by Ying and Yao, that carried statues with them since it was a must to pray in front of them every day. These two also emitted the red light.</p>

  <p>"It's all on you now," Supreme Lord Leroy said.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded and took two steps towards the statue.</p>

  <p>He once again brought out Xun's soul and quickly fused it with the statue. This caused Xun's statue to emit even more light!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng took two steps back. Now, it was Supreme Lord Leroy's turn.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the Supreme Lord was Xun's representative and could issue orders in her stead.</p>

  <p>Xun's soul activated the statue but she was unable to announce any sort of order. Luo Luo Zheng, being human, did not necessarily qualify to be her representative. Only Supreme Lord Leroy held enough qualifications and authority to issue an order.</p>
