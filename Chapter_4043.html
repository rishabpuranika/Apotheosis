</p>

  <p>"You are outsiders. Of course, you don't know the cruelty of the Night View Island. Generally, outsiders are killed on the first night!" Decker's face turned pale. "The Night View Island is full of Treacherous Beings. There are a lot of hostility-level Treacherous Beings which are the weakest ones.</p>

  <p>There are also some stronger resentment-level Treacherous Beings, not to mention the hatred-level Treacherous Beings which are the overlords of the island!"</p>

  <p>Thurston, Sawyer, and Pearson looked at each other hesitantly.</p>

  <p>Although the Night View Island was many times larger than the previous Pure Sky Platform, it was still small compared to the Supreme Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>The hostility-level Treacherous Beings and resentment-level Treacherous Beings, which appeared occasionally in the Supreme Pure Realm, could wreck everything there. Many Treacherous Beings inhabited such a small island, so one could only imagine how dangerous it was!</p>

  <p>Pearson was thinking of persuading the others to return to the Supreme Pure Realm. He had to leave along with Sawyer and Thurston even if they couldn't retreat.</p>

  <p>After all, as long as a hatred-level Treacherous Being appeared, everyone would die. Staying there and continuing to explore was no different from courting death.</p>

  <p>"Almost all the Treacherous Beings are very dangerous. How did you survive?" The Snake Goddess stared straight at Decker as if attempting to read his mind.</p>

  <p>"The members of our Wooden Leaf race have fought with the Treacherous Beings for countless years. Countless members have sacrificed during the battles so we could live..." Decker sighed as he appeared to relive past events.</p>

  <p>"Is there any safe place in the Night View Island?" King Ieuan asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes." Decker nodded.</p>

  <p>"Where?" King Ieuan asked again, this time with eagerness.</p>

  <p>"Our race's territory," Decker replied.</p>

  <p>"Squeak! Can we go there?" King Ieuan was almost hurrying to go.</p>

  <p>Decker smiled instantly and said, "Of course, our Wooden Leaf race like to help outsiders the most. There are often some who seek our protection. You can come with me!"</p>

  <p>"Okay!" King Ieuan answered with excitement.</p>

  <p>Decker then proceeded to lead the way.</p>

  <p>However, the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, Zheng, and the Eternal Realm Hunters refused to move. They were doubtful deep inside.</p>

  <p>There were some races on the Other Shore who were kind and willing to help others. Decker seemed to be a trustworthy person, but some of his words sounded suspicious.</p>

  <p>He claimed that the Wooden Leaf race often helped outsiders, but the Night View Island was originally isolated. There was no way to enter it.</p>

  <p>They had just repaired the only passage. How could there have been outsiders before?</p>

  <p>He also said that if the Ghost Powder was applied to a living creature, it would attract something from the sky. Weren't these plants considered living beings on the island? If so, how did all the plants on the island manage to stay undamaged?</p>

  <p>Moreover, Decker didn't seem to be surprised upon seeing Campbell who was also a Treacherous Being.</p>

  <p>"King Ieuan," the Snake Goddess uttered.</p>

  <p>King Ieuan turned around and blinked. Through its life vitality, it told the crowd, "We are not familiar with this place. It's too strange. We need to know more about it."</p>

  <p>"But..." The Snake Goddess hesitated.</p>

  <p>"You're right. We can't communicate with those Treacherous Beings, but we can talk to this race," Fuxi said to everyone. "Besides, both the sloth and the member of the Wooden Leaf race mentioned that something powerful would descend from the sky. We can't find out if we just stay and explore here. It's much more dangerous!"</p>

  <p>"That's true," Zheng agreed. "The biggest problem is the Ghost Powder."</p>

  <p>The Treacherous Being had let them apply the Ghost Powder to avoid the things from the sky. What Decker said was the complete opposite, implying that the Ghost Powder would cause disaster. Thus, one of them must be lying.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng tended to believe the Treacherous Being, the Treacherous Being did not have intelligence and he could not obtain information from it.</p>

  <p>He would pay a price if he misunderstood the meaning of the words.</p>

  <p>"It's simple." Pearson moved his lips slightly. "I'll collect the Ghost Powder.</p>

  <p>It can be used in critical moments!"</p>

  <p>Pearson's suggestion was a valuable compromise.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," Zheng commended him.</p>

  <p>After discussing for a while, the crowd started to follow Decker.</p>

  <p>Low-lying areas and sloping fields lined the way with an uneven pattern.</p>

  <p>Occasionally, a layer of ashes covered the green grass and trees.</p>

  <p>Swoosh...</p>

  <p>A gust of wind suddenly blew over while the trees swayed gently to its rhythm.</p>

  <p>The Ghost Powder that had been sprinkled on the surface of the trees fell, revealing a large area of green leaves.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>From the trees, white claws suddenly stretched out, holding a handful of ashes. Then the sloth-like Treacherous Beings carefully covered the trees with ashes again.</p>

  <p>"Look!"</p>

  <p>"There are Treacherous Beings!"</p>

  <p>"The Treacherous Beings are really everywhere on the Night View Island..."</p>

  <p>After some sloths finished sprinkling the ashes, they noticed Zheng and his companions. They grabbed a handful of ashes and climbed down the trees, walking towards them.</p>

  <p>According to the first sloth's movements, they were aiming to sprinkle ashes on the group's bodies.</p>

  <p>However, just as these sloths took a few steps forward, Decker raised his hand and shot arrows at them.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The arrows were planted to the ground in front of the sloths, which immediately scared them back to the trees.</p>

  <p>Seeing the sloths' timidity, Fuxi, Pearson, and the others curled their lips in confidence.</p>

  <p>Not all of the Treacherous Beings were born strong, and some were indeed weak.</p>

  <p>While walking, Pearson glanced at his hand and peeled off a spider thread from one of his fingers.</p>

  <p>The spider thread trailed all the way to the nearby forest. It spread up a tree and continuously weaved into a broken hand of Pearson. With a flick of the hand, a blue ring appeared. It was Pearson's Sumeru Space.</p>

  <p>The hand continued to shake the leaves. It caused the Ghost Powder to fall from the leaves and branches, collecting it into the Sumeru Space.</p>

  <p>The movement of the hand soon attracted a few sloths. They took out the Ghost Powder from their pockets again and went to sprinkle it to the hand.</p>

  <p>This was exactly what Pearson wanted, so he used his Sumeru Space to collect and store the Ghost Powder.</p>

  <p>Several sloths kept sprinkling the Ghost Powder, which was all absorbed by the Sumeru Space.</p>

  <p>Although they felt confused and wondered why the Ghost Powder couldn't fully cover the hand, they continued doing so. They took out all the Ghost Powder from their pockets and sprinkled until the last bit. After they had none left, they turned around and left.</p>

  <p>Not long after, Pearson had collected almost all of the Ghost Powder. After that, the hand turned back into a single spider thread and drew back into Pearson's body.</p>

  <p>Everything happened without anyone noticing.</p>

  <p>After a long walk, they arrived at the nearest mountain.</p>

  <p>One side of the mountain was rowed with circular caves. As Decker led Zheng and the others towards it, many members of the Wooden Leaf race drilled out from the caves.</p>

  <p>These members didn't come up to welcome Decker. They stood at the entrances of the caves, like zombies staring at Zheng and the rest. Their eyes were filled with coldness, hatred, and greed.</p>
