  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stared at the girl in the coffin. Coldness drifted out of the ice coffin, his eyes constantly flashing.</p>

  <p>"Is this the True Demon Body you talked about?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>The woman nodded and looked at the body in the coffin with expectation.</p>

  <p>She had come this far. No one knew how she had tried every means and multiple times in order to get the body.</p>

  <p>And now, this day had finally come. She paved countless ways and troubles just to get to this point.</p>

  <p>She then slowly took a step as she approached the ice coffin. She stretched out her arm and reached out to explore what was inside.</p>

  <p>But all of a sudden, her action was brought to a stop.</p>

  <p>A blast of cold air instantly rose from the bottom of the ice coffin.</p>

  <p>The girl inside had suddenly opened her eyes. Her face showed a trace of anger.</p>

  <p>A black energy flashed from the woman's arm and dripped onto the top of the ice coffin. It was the force of primitive fear.</p>

  <p>Other things could pierce the ice coffin, but pure energy was actually absorbed by it!</p>

  <p>After the ice coffin absorbed the force of primitive fear, the anger on the girl's face gradually subsided, and was replaced by a serene expression.</p>

  <p>"She can absorb the force of primitive fear?" Sword Chen asked in surprise as he stared at the ice coffin.</p>

  <p>The woman smiled faintly and responded, "She can absorb all kinds of forces. It's just a gesture of affection for her."</p>

  <p>Due to her experience and continuous great efforts, she had gotten a clear understanding of the characteristics of the True Demon Body.</p>

  <p>She once had successfully entered the world of the ice coffin. At first being inexperienced in dealing with such situation, just like Nicholas, she was met with the fury of the True Demon Body.</p>

  <p>It took her a long time to figure out the secret.</p>

  <p>After stabilizing the girl's emotion, she threw a glance at the replicas of the Holy Beings. A thought occurred to her, and then the Holy Beings rushed towards the ice coffin and disappeared in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>More than ten of the replicas had already entered the ice coffin. The woman made a satisfied expression as she grabbed Luo Zheng's arm and said, "It's our turn to go in now."</p>

  <p>She wouldn't expect Luo Zheng and Sword Chen to help her get the True Demon Body, but she couldn't let Luo Zheng run away either. After all, she still wanted to use his most precious bloodline.</p>

  <p>Naturally, Luo Zheng and Sword Chen did not resist.</p>

  <p>They were well aware that this woman was not a kind person in their eyes.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the woman was too strong and was not someone to be offended as they couldn't escape. They could only play it by ear for now.</p>

  <p>Sword Chen himself wanted to grab the supreme treasure of belief before Nicholas. Thus, now it was not only a crisis, but also an opportunity for him!</p>

  <p>They followed the woman as they moved towards the ice coffin.</p>

  <p>The sky and the earth turned round, and the space shuttled.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>A surprised expression appeared on Luo Zheng's face as he stepped into the space passageway beneath the ice coffin.</p>

  <p>From the universe to the divine land, Luo Zheng had experienced all sorts of strange space passageways. The time passageway built inside the jade seal was so far the most extreme experience for him.</p>

  <p>But this time, he felt something more complicated.</p>

  <p>He felt that he wasn't traveling through the space passageway, but that he was constantly getting smaller.</p>

  <p>It felt like he was turning from a Wild God tens of thousands of feet tall into a person of a normal size.</p>

  <p>If that was the case, it was supposed to only take an instant for him to shrink to his normal size. But this time, instead of shrinking quickly, the same feeling had been going on ever since he had entered the passageway.</p>

  <p>He wondered if it was an illusion.</p>

  <p>The woman noticed Luo Zheng's expression and smiled. "What did you detect?"</p>

  <p>"We're getting smaller," Luo Zheng straightaway remarked.</p>

  <p>Sword Chen was shocked. "What? Getting smaller?"</p>

  <p>"You're really an acute observer. How could you be able to perceive it in such a short time? I traveled through tens of thousands of times before I discovered this secret," the woman said retaining her smile, her eyes gleaming with appreciation.</p>

  <p>There was no reference object in this space, and everyone was rapidly shrinking at the same time. Originally, it was supposed to be difficult to sense the change of their figures.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng observed the spinning void around him. He asked with a frown, "How small will we become?"</p>

  <p>The woman thought for a while and answered, "Until we are as small as dust..."</p>

  <p>As soon as she finished speaking, the previously crazily spinning void disappeared from Luo Zheng's sight.</p>

  <p>It was abruptly stopped.</p>

  <p>In a flash, a fit of wild whooshing sounds roared in his ears.</p>

  <p>Huge ice crystals drew a curve in the air and rushed toward him.</p>

  <p>Clap!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng punched out and the ice crystal floating closest to him immediately broke into countless pieces.</p>

  <p>But as soon as he smashed one, more ice crystals came at him.</p>

  <p>Only then did Luo Zheng realize that these huge ice crystals were snowflakes.</p>

  <p>His figure now had shrunk to a size countless times smaller. Compared to his size, the insignificant snowflakes looked bigger and of twenty or thirty feet tall.</p>

  <p>"Sacred Twilight Shield!"</p>

  <p>A huge protective shield of three-colored flame appeared as Clark's voice was heard.</p>

  <p>It instantly covered the replicas of the Holy Beings, Luo Zheng and Sword Chen underneath.</p>

  <p>The three-colored Sacred Twilight Flame was one of Clark's most powerful martial arts skills.</p>

  <p>The huge snowflakes continued to approach, but as soon as they touched the fire shield, they immediately turned into a mist!</p>

  <p>Inside the Sacred Twilight Shield, warmth was overflowing!</p>

  <p>Sword Chen was surely given a start as he witnessed the changes of events in mere seconds. He discreetly talked to Luo Zheng through his life vitality, "This woman is very strong, and now she even has so many Holy Beings to assist her. What if she really manages to control the Abyss Demon Region?"</p>

  <p>"Let's keep our wits about us. I don't think she will succeed. Besides, Nicholas won't give up easily. And the replicas she created might not be stronger than the real Holy Beings," Luo Zheng responded.</p>

  <p>Theoretically, this woman's replicas were almost flawless, but in fact, there was big difference between the strengths of a warrior and their replica.</p>

  <p>One example was Luo Zheng's replica. It was much weaker than him.</p>

  <p>From this point of view, she wasn't necessarily stronger than Nicholas and the other Holy Beings. They might have some skills that she could not clone.</p>

  <p>"Let's hope so," replied Sword Chen.</p>

  <p>The current situation was too complicated.</p>

  <p>They knew that they could defeat neither Nicholas nor the woman. They could only hope that both Nicholas and the woman would suffer a loss!</p>

  <p>They continued descending all the way from the sky, but the storm did not seem to stop.</p>

  <p>Countless snowflakes constantly hit the Sacred Twilight Shield. And in turn, they broke every time and turned to wisps of mist. They became ice crystals at a very low temperature and drifted away with the wind.</p>

  <p>It was five minutes later that they finally landed on a snow plain.</p>

  <p>As soon as they landed, a violent roar came from the depths of the snow plain. A visible shock wave spread out right after.</p>

  <p>The shock wave quickly spread over the snow land, like an invisible plow that plowed the snow on the ground. The whole area was slowly engulfed by a freezing coldness. The Sacred Twilight Shield protecting the group had even darkened instantly. The duplicated Clark turned pale at the sight.</p>

  <p>'What a powerful chilly energy!'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was also shocked. Even with the protection they had, it still penetrated through. As the cold air passed over his body, his blood seemed to freeze.</p>

  <p>What made him more confused was that the chilly energy was not produced by the internal momentum of the Mysterious Ice Divine Dao, but an indescribable power. He had never seen it before.</p>

  <p>The woman looked into the depths of the snow plain and said lightly, "It seems like the True Demon Body is quite angry. To subside this anger, three or more Holy Beings will have to die. Huh, such bad luck for them..."</p>
