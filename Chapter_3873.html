<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Just when Usman was about to struggle, Samantha, who was standing next to him, waved her horsetail whisk gently on his body.</p>

  <p>As the whisk touched Usman's face, he instantly felt his body become stiff all over.</p>

  <p>He was desperately trying to utter a word, but even his mouth was paralyzed, unable to say a word.</p>

  <p>"How to devour him? Do I just eat him up directly?" the Evil God said as he looked at Usman with a wicked grin.</p>

  <p>Although the Evil God would not devour the human flesh, he was pretty satisfied with Usman.</p>

  <p>The aura being emitted by Usman was almost exactly the same as his. That was why he thought that Usman was very suitable to be a part of him.</p>

  <p>"Don't you have the ability to absorb one's soul?" Samantha asked in confusion.</p>

  <p>"That's right. You just need to devour his soul," Shera added.</p>

  <p>There was actually nothing wrong with devouring Usman's physical body, but the most important thing was to fuse with his soul by consuming it.</p>

  <p>With that, Samantha reached out her hand towards Usman's forehead, and a ray of cyan light was released from her palm.</p>

  <p>Unable to move an inch, Usman only felt a grueling gravitational force coming from Samantha's hand. His eyes rolled and his body trembled violently. Soon, his soul was gradually dragged out of his body.</p>

  <p>Generally, one's soul would look the same as their physical body, and there were only a very few exceptions.</p>

  <p>Usman's soul was one of them. His soul was very unique. It sort of looked like a cat with its fur standing on end and covered with soul thorns. As Samantha dragged it out, it started struggling insanely in her hand.</p>

  <p>However, if his physical body wasn't able to escape from Samantha, then his soul would be much more helpless.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Samantha waved Usman's soul and quickly placed it on the Evil God's head, for it to be absorbed into his mind. In just a matter of seconds, Usman's soul was successfully integrated into the Evil God's mind.</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, as soon as Usman's soul fused with the Evil God, it struggled and even tried to take over.</p>

  <p>However, Samantha didn't have any intention of helping the Evil God out.</p>

  <p>Instead, she asked him to deal with it by himself.</p>

  <p>"Will he be okay?" Shera asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"Well, it depends on him. But he better sort it out quickly." Samantha shrugged her shoulders and didn't seem to care much about it.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing the indifferent expression on Samantha's face, Shera also backed off.</p>

  <p>In fact, even the entire Nihility race treated the Evil God and Usman with the same attitude. As the incarnations of the evil wills, they weren't destined to be faithful partners for their race.</p>

  <p>Besides, the Nihility race just needed their identity, and it didn't matter to them whoever played the dominant role.</p>

  <p>However, for Shera, it was a bit complicated. Previously, she was infatuated with the original Usman, and the two of them shared some memories. So, she had quite a mixed feeling as the current Usman's soul was given to the Evil God.</p>

  <p>"We have already given so much to the Evil God. If he can't even deal with the recently reborn Usman, then we might as well support Usman instead,"</p>

  <p>Samantha added.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, a sharp look of pain suddenly appeared on the Evil God's face.</p>

  <p>The muscles on his face twisted constantly and gave off strange expressions.</p>

  <p>After a few seconds, his eyes closed and all his movements stopped. He seemed to have calmed down already.</p>

  <p>Then, after a short while, he finally opened his eyes. Something definitely changed as his eyes were as deep as the ancient wells.</p>

  <p>"So, you won?" Shera was the first to ask.</p>

  <p>Shera felt that the Evil God didn't really change physically, but many incomprehensible expressions were contained in his eyes this time.</p>

  <p>Then, the Evil God moved towards Shera. He looked at her with a peculiar expression in his eyes. "I found some strange memories."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by strange memories?" Shera asked.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, the Evil God reached out his hand, touched Shera's face, and drew her straight black hair towards him. As he smelled it, there was a visible frown on his face and he said, "There's a strong stench of corpses.</p>

  <p>Why does that guy find it fragrant?"</p>

  <p>"W-why do you have his previous memories?" Shera stuttered as she quickly stepped back. Her pale face turned a little red.</p>

  <p>The other members of the Black Ship who were present eventually realized what was going on, but were also confused as to why it happened.</p>

  <p>Usman often did that to Shera in the past. He loved her scent even though it smelled like corpses. But it was obvious that the Evil God didn't like that smell.</p>

  <p>"When I merged with his soul, I also found some of the memory fragments.</p>

  <p>I guess the current Usman wasn't aware that these memory fragments existed within him," the Evil God explained.</p>

  <p>With the appearance of the incarnation of the evil will, the memories of his previous life should have completely disappeared. Even in the Source World, that was how they viewed reincarnation because the Memory Flame had completely vanished.</p>

  <p>However, it seemed that some memories from the previous life of Usman were somehow carried on. And now, even the current Evil God had them.</p>

  <p>"Well, it doesn't matter. What's important is how much impact you will have on the Source World," Samantha butted in.</p>

  <p>To be able to control the Source World was equivalent to controlling the core of the chaos. This was also how other Eternal Realm masters thought.</p>

  <p>But of course, it was no easy task to control the largest primitive land in the chaos.</p>

  <p>Moreover, there had never been an incarnation of the primitive land, so they thought that theoretically, it was impossible to gain control of it.</p>

  <p>However, many primitive lands had the incarnations of evil will. Take the one in Zheng's body as an example. It was so small, but the Evil God still appeared.</p>

  <p>The Black Ship and the Bearing race intentionally cultivated the incarnations of the evil will for the same purpose. They wanted to control the Source World through them.</p>

  <p>"My impact on the Source World, huh?"</p>

  <p>The Evil God's eyes narrowed as he looked at the boundary wall not far away.</p>

  <p>After he devoured Usman's soul, he instantly felt that the broken boundary wall was somehow related to him.</p>

  <p>Without wasting any time, the Evil God stretched out his hands towards the boundary wall.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the amber crystal clear boundary wall began to flow like melted honey.</p>

  <p>Under his control, the boundary wall that stretched for hundreds of miles quickly collapsed and flowed steadily.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, the other members of the Black Ship, including Shera and even Samantha, were greatly shocked.</p>

  <p>After the previous Usman's appearance, he was carefully cultivated by the Black Ship.</p>

  <p>At that time, Usman told them that he felt there were five stages that he could attain to improve himself.</p>

  <p>When he reached the second stage, he was already able to merge with the boundary walls. It meant that he could open and close the boundary walls of the Source World.</p>

  <p>He said that when he reached the third stage, he would be able to control the boundary walls at will. When that happened, even powerful Eternal Realm warriors would have a hard time dealing with him.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, as he was about to reach the third stage, he had become the rebel and was killed.</p>

  <p>Eventually, the next Usman was cultivated by Yellow Thearch. But he was already devoured by the Evil God while he was still at the early level of the second stage.</p>

  <p>Logically speaking, even if the Evil God had fused with Usman's soul, he would be able to reach the second stage at most. However, what they were seeing now defied logic and exceeded their expectations.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Crash!</p>

  <p>At the same moment, a huge whistling sound came from the skies above.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven suddenly appeared and was smashed down towards the boundary wall by Claire.</p>

  <p>When the Evil God saw this, a pitch-black light flashed in his eyes and he stretched out his hand.</p>

  <p>In a matter of seconds, the boundary wall which was flowing like a fluid suddenly began to condense into a long spear.</p>

  <p>The boundary wall that was hundreds of miles wide was condensed into a nine-foot-nine-inch-long spear. He held it in his hand as it released a tremendous amount of power.</p>

  <p>As Claire viciously threw the Grandmaster of Heaven down, her figure flashed and she kept chasing after him.</p>

  <p>At her top speed, her body could flicker and her figure couldn't be perceived by the naked eye. Even Samantha would find it difficult to capture her.</p>

  <p>However, now that the Evil God had devoured Usman, he also gained the connection to the Separate Amber Province. It meant that as long as any object was within the Separate Amber Province, he could easily tell its location in an instant. With that, he raised the long spear with his right hand, and forcefully threw it in a certain direction.</p>
