  <p>
</p>

  <p>The changes within the energy channel also manifested externally.</p>

  <p>Chaim was the last to leave the vortex and enter Stage Fourteen, just before Zheng and Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>Upon exiting, he found that the previously stable energy vortex began to fluctuate with the energy bands constantly rolling around abnormally and blocking the exit.</p>

  <p>Chaim couldn't help but gasp in astonishment. "This is..."</p>

  <p>After Feng Ge became a purified being, Chaim learned a few bits of important information.</p>

  <p>From what he was able to gather, a purified being was the ruler of a stage, thus, in theory, they shouldn't be able to leave that certain stage.</p>

  <p>If that was the case, then wouldn't that mean Feng Ge had to stay behind and would be unable to reach the Desire World? She was bound to encounter some problems at least.</p>

  <p>Looking at the energy channel, Chaim realized that the problem had just materialized itself. If the energy vortex was sealed then that meant Zheng and Feng Ge wouldn't be able to pass through it at all.</p>

  <p>"What happened?!" "The passageway! It's closed!"</p>

  <p>"Everyone from the Oneness Sky Palace got through, right?"</p>

  <p>"I think so! That was really close. It's a good thing we were able to get through before it did that!"</p>

  <p>None of the disciples from the Oneness Sky Palace thought that the purified being had anything to do with it. To them, the vortex was simply strangely malfunctioning.</p>

  <p>"Wait. I think someone is missing!" someone remarked.</p>

  <p>"You're right! Where's Princess Feng Ge? Was she unable to pass through?</p>

  <p>She is different from us anyway."</p>

  <p>"Is it because she has a corporeal body on the Other Shore?"</p>

  <p>The disciples began to whisper amongst themselves at this current development.</p>

  <p>Dorothy's heart was erratic as she analyzed the situation.</p>

  <p>"Feng Ge, Zheng..."</p>

  <p>In an instant, she immediately dissipated her Soul of Light.</p>

  <p>The next time she opened her eyes, she was back in her cultivation room, worried sick about what was currently brewing.</p>

  <p>She didn't really care about Feng Ge's safety, but Zheng...he was an entirely different matter.</p>

  <p>"Crack..."</p>

  <p>Dorothy opened the door and headed straight to the No. 1 cultivation room in the far right where Zheng was in.</p>

  <p>Several senior disciples of the Land of Sword Grief rushed over when they saw her in such a hurry. All of them sported flattering smiles on their faces.</p>

  <p>"Princess Dorothy, what made you so anxious all of a sudden?"</p>

  <p>Dorothy could only look at Zheng's room in worry. "Can that door be opened?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Her deepest fear would be if she opened that door and found only Zheng's mangled corpse waiting for her.</p>

  <p>The senior disciples who greeted her could only look at each other.</p>

  <p>"This... it's a private place. It's not really advisable to disturb the cultivator inside. If the warrior inside is unwilling to open it, then the people outside should..."</p>

  <p>However, Dorothy was in no mood to listen to their nonsense. "Can the door be opened?" she repeated with urgency. "Can it be broken or something?!"</p>

  <p>Her suggestion was immediately met with obvious hesitation. "Break it?</p>

  <p>Well, it could work but..."</p>

  <p>There was nobody that dared provoke Zheng, not when he gained a bit of a reputation ever since coming to the Land of Sword Grief. Opening his cultivation room wasn't a wise thing.</p>

  <p>"I'll bear the consequences, whatever they may be," Dorothy declared confidently.</p>

  <p>The man smiled. "Alright then."</p>

  <p>Since Dorothy already expressed her willingness to take accountability, he would willingly break the door down for her. Reaching out his hand, the man gathered the Other Shore Power in his palm.</p>

  <p>With the force of over a thousand divine megatons, he pushed at the door and broke through!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Dorothy wasted no time and rushed inside. "Stay outside!" she ordered the senior disciples clustered behind her.</p>

  <p>All of them were curious but could guess why Dorothy had been so anxious and demanding.</p>

  <p>"Do you think Zheng died on the Other Shore?"</p>

  <p>"It's possible. They are supposed to leave the Lust World and enter the Desire World today."</p>

  <p>"Died? How is that possible? He's so powerful. I can't imagine him not reaching the Desire World, given his skills."</p>

  <p>Although the energy vortex could be dangerous, most warriors got through it with no problems.</p>

  <p>Inside the cultivation room, Dorothy found Zheng sitting cross-legged on the floor, with faint golden light glowing on the surface of his body. She gently pressed on the spot between his brows and breathed a sigh of relief when she sensed the fluctuation of his soul aura.</p>

  <p>Within the vortex, Zheng and Feng Ge were moving in a very strange way.</p>

  <p>He had gradually figured out the rules of the energy bands.</p>

  <p>These energy bands composed the entirety of the vortex. However, Zheng found that they could be divided into two layers. On the outer layer, the energy bands were in a dissociative state and were easily disturbed, sweeping up and attacking those that passed by.</p>

  <p>The energy bands in the inner layer were more stable and formed the walls within the passage.</p>

  <p>When Feng Ge had approached the outer energy bands, it led to her getting attacked crazily.</p>

  <p>This was the consequence of breaking the rules of being a purified being.</p>

  <p>The inner energy bands, since they were more stable, did not harm Feng Ge in any way. It was only when Zheng hit them with the internal momentum of the Godly Way did they launch a counterattack.</p>

  <p>Zheng felt a bit more relaxed after learning all this.</p>

  <p>He specially launched attacks towards the energy bands in a certain direction and waited for their reaction. Once they rolled up, the big hole continued to move forward.</p>

  <p>A strange feeling came over Feng Ge as she watched the energy bands that were tens of feet away around her.</p>

  <p>In such a dangerous circumstance, it was hard to believe that the two of them not only survived, but were able to move forward bit by bit.</p>

  <p>She couldn't help but sigh in relief.</p>

  <p>"Can we dig into the Desire World by continuously doing this?" she whispered to Zheng.</p>

  <p>While focusing on releasing lightning, Zheng said, "The direction should be right but it's hard to say. Duck!"</p>

  <p>Zheng warned just as an energy band flew right past his right arm.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Feng Ge heard his warning just in time and lowered her head.</p>

  <p>Whoosh...</p>

  <p>A wound appeared on Zheng's right arm. At the same time, all the light dots formed by the Chaotic Source Spirits in his body were extinguished, falling into a state of fatigue.</p>

  <p>He couldn't bring the Shade Stone liquid with him to the Other Shore, but the Chaotic Source Spirits were different.</p>

  <p>Since Zheng's body had entered the Other Shore, the Chaotic Source Spirits, which were from there in the first place, could naturally work.</p>

  <p>"The energy is so powerful..." he muttered in shock.</p>

  <p>He initially thought he could count on the Chaotic Source Spirits to resist an energy band. But it seemed they couldn't even bear the force when an energy band merely brushed past him.</p>

  <p>Zheng found himself becoming more cautious as they moved forward.</p>

  <p>He tried to lure only one energy band into attacking them at a time which slowed down their speed significantly. He pulled out the energy bands one by one as if painstakingly reeling threads from a silk cocoon.</p>

  <p>Two hours later, Zheng pulled out an energy band and found an iron plate in front of them.</p>
