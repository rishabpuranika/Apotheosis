<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1730 The Birth Of A New World </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>There was a knowing look in Luo Zheng's eyes. The big Heavenly Tribulation this time was also a test for his skills.</p>

  <p>First came the Grand Meteorite Tribulation, then the Raging Fire Tribulation, then the Inner Demon Tribulation...</p>

  <p>After a series of tribulations, the Thunder Tribulation finally dawned on him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was no stranger to the Thunder Tribulation, as the Thunderbolt Annihilation he practiced could trigger it directly.</p>

  <p>However, there was something special about this Thunder Tribulation. It had a green bolt of lightning.</p>

  <p>The Thunder Tribulation struck his abdomen and fell into his internal world. Therefore, Luo Luo Zheng couldn't avoid or touch it.</p>

  <p>The moment the Thunder Tribulation made contact with his elixir field, a searing pain wracked his whole body.</p>

  <p>Then, the World Tree absorbed most of the Thunder Tribulation.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the World Tree began to grow under the Thunder Tribulation's baptism as the waters of the chaotic sea rolled violently at the same time, and formed a stormy sea in Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>At that moment, his soul also underwent a strange change.</p>

  <p>It felt like he had fallen into the deepest pits of chaos.</p>

  <p>Everything around him was grey and hazy. His body rolled listlessly as he fell even further into the chaos.</p>

  <p>After an unknown period of time, the rolling finally slowed down. Luo Luo Zheng suddenly felt like he was pushed on a patch of land. He opened his eyes, and was greeted by the shocking sight of the huge World Tree.</p>

  <p>What was more, there appeared to be an island beneath it.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes lit up in a flash.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the entire chaotic sea began to solidify.</p>

  <p>What used to be a seemingly endless ocean of chaotic energy in his internal world was now changed by the sudden appearance of this island.</p>

  <p>The island wasn't that big. Luo Luo Zheng looked like he knew something, but couldn't quite place it.</p>

  <p>He had seen this type of place before; that was for sure.</p>

  <p>Back when he had entered Brianna's inner world, he had seen an island too.</p>

  <p>However, the island in her body was much larger than Luo Zheng's. Hers had many forests and dwarf shrubs growing on it. There was even a relatively primitive tribe.</p>

  <p>"I have already reached the Spirit Supreme Realm!" Luo Luo Zheng exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Although he was still in a dazed state, the scene before him made him realize that he had already broken through the Soul Sea Realm and reached the Spirit Supreme Realm, which was why he had encountered that green Thunder Tribulation.</p>

  <p>That same Thunder Tribulation which was filled with life energy gave life to the entire chaotic sea.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stood there in silence as he witnessed the passing of time, the rudiments of the world, and the evolution of life.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>His eyes averted to the brown ocean, where its brown waters rolled in thick, foamy waves towards the island.</p>

  <p>He noticed that the island continued to expand when a part of the chaotic energy solidified, which happened with every wave that came.</p>

  <p>If one looked more closely at the sea, there were actually some plankton that were mixed in the waters.</p>

  <p>Some of the plankton were washed onto the brown-colored island and were drilled into the "mud," which was also formed from chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, the ground began to turn green and was eventually covered with slippery moss.</p>

  <p>Only when the inner world had evolved to this point, did its speed slow down.</p>

  <p>Everything present, whether the plankton or the moss, was the most primitive form of life.</p>

  <p>It would take a lot of time to reproduce all sorts of creatures, even humans.</p>

  <p>Brianna had spent over 100, 000 years and only managed to develop a tribe. How long would Luo Zheng's inner world take to create humans?</p>

  <p>On the other hand, there was endless chaos outside the divine land.</p>

  <p>Such a place was a forbidden zone, even to the True Gods.</p>

  <p>Only a handful of truly powerful warriors were able to traverse through the deadly chaos.</p>

  <p>There had been some mighty warrior in the past who had traveled the chaos for a trillion miles, but the depths of the chaos remained the same as before.</p>

  <p>In other words, no one knew where the chaos ended.</p>

  <p>At that moment, a small ball appeared in some area in the chaos.</p>

  <p>It was no ordinary ball as it rapidly expanded like a bubble.</p>

  <p>But it suddenly stopped when it had reached a certain point, and seemed to wait for the next expansion.</p>

  <p>Any warrior who were to see it would be utterly shocked. There was actually a World Tree inside the bubble, and the bubble even formed a world of its own.</p>

  <p>Ever since the Creating Axe had split the heaven and earth, all of the worlds were built around the divine land.</p>

  <p>This meant that no one had ever been able to create a world in the chaos.</p>

  <p>The world that had been formed in the chaos was extremely small compared to the divine land, that it was almost insignificant.</p>

  <p>However, it was slowly expanding. No one knew how large it could grow.</p>

  <p>Then again, the chaos was so vast that its size was even unimaginable. It wouldn't be unusual if even the mighty warriors wouldn't be able to notice the tiny little world.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng opened his eyes after he had observed the island in his belly for quite some time, a hint of joy on his face.</p>

  <p>His cultivation level had definitely improved a lot after he had entered the Spirit Supreme Realm.</p>

  <p>He then turned his gaze towards the Lotus Flower above his head. The Lotus Flower rotated slowly as its thirty-five petals glinted under the light.</p>

  <p>A thought seemed to have crossed his mind when he looked at the Lotus Flower.</p>

  <p>"It looks like I'll have to make a trip to the Sword Manor," he murmured.</p>

  <p>His Lotus Flower had yet to reach perfection, and it should have something to do with the Emotion Closing Godly Way. Supreme Lord Sword had once told Luo Luo Zheng that he still had a flaw that he had yet to comprehend, and this flaw was something he couldn't comprehend if he relied only on himself. That was why he needed to go to the Sword Manor.</p>

  <p>It was also why Supreme Lord Sword had put a sword rune in Luo Zheng's arm.</p>

  <p>Now, Luo Luo Zheng had three places to go to.</p>

  <p>The first was the Northern Twilight Star, because the secret left behind by Viveca, Elspeth, Salvador and Aneisha was to be found there.</p>

  <p>The second was where the Celestial Position race lived. The world lords had blocked the fairy palace before the Illusion Battlefield had opened, so he hadn't been able to make it to the Celestial Position's location.</p>

  <p>Lastly, the third destination that appeared was the Sword Manor.</p>

  <p>He began to talk to Xun about his plans as thoughts about the Sword Manor swam in his head.</p>

  <p>However, Xun's mood didn't seem to improve. She still looked ill and unhappy, which was far from the valiant and murderous Queen of Killings. She now resembled a weak girl, which made men have an instinctive urge to protect her when they saw her.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was also concerned about this situation and asked her about it two or three times, but Xun always changed the subject. She was even cold towards him. Luo Luo Zheng was really clueless.</p>

  <p>"These three places are very far away from each other. It would take at least ten years to travel back and forth between two places, even with the speed of the fairy palace," Xun said. She thought for a moment before another vague sentence spilled from her lips. "From now on, you need to make decisions by yourself!"</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Xun suddenly dissipated in front of him, transforming into the sword spirit that entered his body.</p>

  <p>"Huh?" That made Luo Luo Zheng even more confused.</p>

  <p>Not far away stood Freya, who watched the whole scene with a smile on her face.</p>

  <p>Xun was cold and seldom talked to Freya. But Freya had stayed in this fairy palace for many years. A bystander is always clear-minded.</p>

  <p>She knew exactly what Xun was thinking.</p>

  <p>Still, Xun had always been by Luo Zheng's side. That made it hard for Freya to personally tell him about Xun's situation.</p>

  <p>After a while, Luo Luo Zheng came to a decision. And this time, he didn't forget that he had brought something else with him from the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>With a flip of his hand, a small token appeared on his palm.</p>

  <p>"What is this?" Freya asked curiously. Luo Zheng's lips curved into a small smile in response.</p>

  <p>"This is a Teleportation Token."</p>

  <p>The Teleportation Token had allowed Luo Luo Zheng to move back and forth within a supreme world in the Illusion Battlefield. That was why he had made a copy of the Teleportation Token and took it out of the battlefield.</p>

  <p>He wasn't sure if it would work in the universe, though. But there was no harm in trying, right?</p>
