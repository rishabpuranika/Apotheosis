<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It was true that there were many forces in the chaos, but it didn't make things complicated.</p>

  <p>After the six Chaos Ancient Gods split into two factions, the division of powers in the Source World became quite stable.</p>

  <p>Fuxi was the one who wanted to complete the Finale Way the most. He tried his best to make himself stronger, enough to kill the Chaos Ancient Gods and break the balance.</p>

  <p>The only thing was that the Chaos Ancient Gods were invincible, and this was one of the truths in the chaos.</p>

  <p>He couldn't break that truth, but Zheng had surprisingly done it.</p>

  <p>Othniel looked at Zheng again, but this time with a hint of fear and caution.</p>

  <p>After all, the Chaos Ancient Gods were not immortal. Anyone whose life was on the line, like him, would be on guard.</p>

  <p>Although he already believed what Zheng said, he still countered, "Just you?</p>

  <p>Don't brag about yourself!"</p>

  <p>Zheng glanced at him indifferently and said, "You'll know whether I'm bragging or not soon."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he suddenly disappeared from where he stood.</p>

  <p>Moreover, his disappearance didn't cause any space fluctuation, nor did he build a space channel.</p>

  <p>It was as if he had used another theurgy that never existed before to teleport!</p>

  <p>Naturally, Othniel was shocked when he saw that Zheng had disappeared.</p>

  <p>After all, he was a Chaos Ancient God in charge of the space truth. What skillful method did Zheng use to avoid his detection?</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>His eye glowed a bright blue then he released a mighty truth power. That was when he finally noticed something.</p>

  <p>There was an immensely thin line in the black void that moved like a worm as it swiftly approached him.</p>

  <p>When he got to see it more clearly, it was already quite close to him!</p>

  <p>"Go!"</p>

  <p>In turn, he used the Grand Teleportation without a second thought.</p>

  <p>Zheng had already jumped out from the end of the line the moment Othniel disappeared, but it was too late. Othniel had already teleported far away.</p>

  <p>"He actually spotted me. If it was any other Chaos Ancient God, they probably couldn't have done that." Zheng shrugged.</p>

  <p>After the ancestry-level bloodline devoured Lamont, it naturally became more interested in consuming Chaos Ancient Gods.</p>

  <p>The ancestry-level bloodline also played an active role when Zheng dealt with Othniel. For instance, the bloodline released this particular space theurgy that even Othniel found it hard to see through it. Zheng almost succeeded in devouring him just now.</p>

  <p>Even though Othniel could also still turn into multiple Minimum Spaces to escape, such a method consumed a lot of energy, and he might not be able to get away after a few uses.</p>

  <p>As for Zheng, he failed to catch Othniel at his first attempt. At that point, he turned around and nodded at the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>

  <p>The real Eastern Emperor Taiyi understood what Zheng meant. His eyes flashed with a sharp light, and the long sword in his hand turned into golden lights that filled the sky and swept towards Othniel. At the same time, Zheng disappeared again.</p>

  <p>Othniel dodged the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi's golden sword radiance and simultaneously watched out for the curved line.</p>

  <p>The line was easy to miss, and it was almost impossible to distinguish it among the bright golden sword radiance.</p>

  <p>He used the Grand Teleportation once more, and his large body dashed forward while he avoided the golden sword radiance. In a short amount of time, he was already millions of miles away.</p>

  <p>But the moment he stopped, the line appeared behind him out of nowhere.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng's ribs extended and seized him from behind once again!</p>

  <p>"Puff, puff, puff, puff..."</p>

  <p>The thick, sharp ribs pierced through his body and left sixteen gaping, bloody holes on it.</p>

  <p>This time, he did not struggle anymore. He immediately turned into trillions of Minimum Spaces and escaped from Zheng's arms before his body condensed and took shape again.</p>

  <p>However, although he was powerful, he felt exhausted the second time he turned into multiple Minimum Spaces.</p>

  <p>Just as he took shape again, Zheng disappeared and turned into a thin line once more, then flew straight towards him. He didn't even have a chance to catch his breath!</p>

  <p>As he observed Zheng's aggressive attack, he only sighed and finally chose to exile.</p>

  <p>He couldn't exile Zheng, but he could exile himself.</p>

  <p>When Zheng appeared at the end of the thin line, Othniel had already gone to the edge of the Source World.</p>

  <p>"He didn't use the Grand Teleportation this time?" Of course, he was surprised.</p>

  <p>"He must have exiled himself. I'm afraid it will take some time to get him back," the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi said with certainty.</p>

  <p>"He sure ran fast," Zheng muttered with a shrug. At that point, the chaos cloud in the distance burst and unleashed a strong energy fluctuation.</p>

  <p>He and the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi glanced at each other, then swiftly went straight for the chaos cloud.</p>

  <p>The chaos cloud was incomparably enormous. It was so big that a body millions of feet high was only like a drop in the ocean compared to it!</p>

  <p>Outside the chaos cloud were sixteen tall purple pillars that floated in the air. Each purple pillar was painted with mysterious patterns and contained vast amounts of hidden power.</p>

  <p>Then, the purple pillars turned into a perfect cage and trapped all those from the Pear Hill inside it.</p>

  <p>The real Fuxi, the real Snake Goddess, Gerald, and Judson all had suffered heavy injuries.</p>

  <p>There was a big hole one million feet wide on the real Fuxi's chest. A black fire burned on the hole to prevent the horrible wound from healing.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Judson lost an arm, and half of his head got broken.</p>

  <p>However, Gerald looked the worst of them all. Both of his pincers were damaged.</p>

  <p>Only the real Snake Goddess looked slightly better. Although she was not injured, her face still looked fatigued. The battle with the Grandmaster of Heaven had cost a lot of her energy.</p>

  <p>Gerald's life truth-level theurgy could immediately heal all their wounds, but the black fire kept their wounds burning at bay.</p>

  <p>The black fire was the nemesis of the life truth. Back then, it took Gerald a lot of time to get rid of the black fire when it burned him once. Now that he was currently in an intense battle, he didn't have time to help his companions deal with the fire.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the cage formed by the purple pillars was the Lawless Cage, which Herbert had made using the confinement truth.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the warriors who were inside it lost half their strength.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven stood on one of the purple pillars and looked down at them. "I can give you a chance to join our Nihility race and surrender to me," he said with a cold smile.</p>

  <p>As Herbert, who had built the Lawless Cage, heard those words, his face instantly darkened.</p>

  <p>It was true that the Grandmaster of Heaven was powerful, but Herbert also contributed greatly in subduing the four warriors.</p>

  <p>Also, his stand was completely different from the Grandmaster of Heaven's.</p>

  <p>The only reason they worked together was that they wanted to fight against the Pear Hill. After that, a battle would probably ensue between them.</p>

  <p>Now, the Grandmaster of Heaven wanted to make all the people of the Pear Hill surrender to him. How could he accept that?</p>

  <p>"Grandmaster of Heaven, you and I worked together in order to take down the Pear Hill. These people can't be restrained; they can only be killed," he said bluntly.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven turned to look at him and sneered, "Why should I listen to you?"</p>

  <p>"I also did my part to take them down," he threatened. "If I remove the Lawless Cage, I'm afraid you'll also be in trouble."</p>

  <p>No matter how strong the Grandmaster of Heaven was, it was hard for him to deal with the two Chaos Ancient Gods at the same time. What was more, the real Fuxi and the real Snake Goddess were there as well, so he was less likely to win the fight.</p>

  <p id="top_4">"This Lawless Cage is indeed powerful, but I'm afraid you are not the only one who could control it," the Grandmaster of Heaven said nonchalantly and ignored the threat. Suddenly, four of the sixteen purple pillars rose and trapped Herbert.</p>
