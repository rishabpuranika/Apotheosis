<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Aurora's usually clear eyes darkened a bit. She and Vivian had the same reason why they compared themselves to Zheng.</p>

  <p>A martial artist would naturally be cautious in the face of a powerful opponent. It was because of this that they were even wary of their companions sometimes.</p>

  <p>Aurora and Zheng did not know each other.</p>

  <p>Zheng seemed to have been brought in by Vivian. However, why would he be willing to help her if he was strong enough on his own?</p>

  <p>The Deadwood Gate was a supreme sacred place where martial artists grabbed Illusion Points. They would receive at least a few million Illusion Points every time they entered. If Zheng took control of the place, the Demon Night wouldn't be able to do anything.</p>

  <p>Therefore, no one could blame Aurora for being worried.</p>

  <p>All the ogre martial artists were afraid and nervous because of Zheng's attack.</p>

  <p>The ogre martial artists had good perception, even though they were irritable. They were well aware that they were at the point where they were on the verge of death.</p>

  <p>There was only a path in the huge tree branch. Zheng guarded one side, and the Falling Leaves Array was on the other side. They would lose their chance of resistance if they were surrounded.</p>

  <p>"Kill this guy first!" the ogre martial artist with the giant shield on his shoulder said quickly.</p>

  <p>Then, he dashed forward as soon as he finished speaking.</p>

  <p>The other ogre martial artists followed suit since they understood their current situation.</p>

  <p>The ogre martial artists' tall and sturdy bodies looked like small mountains when they pounced towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, Vivian stayed at the other side of the tree branch and did not lead the Demon Night members to follow Zheng. Instead, her mouth gently moved, as if she was communicating with Aurora.</p>

  <p>However, neither Vivian nor Aurora made a move.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Amber was lost in her own world.</p>

  <p>She simply stared indifferently at the young man in the distance.</p>

  <p>He was just a youth back then when he had arrived at the Sea God Continent. He was rather lanky and even a bit immature.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng gave her a strong sense of confidence now. He could kill all the ogre martial artists in front of him with just a wave of his hand.</p>

  <p>How hard would it be for a martial artist who could kill Supreme Lords to kill some ogre martial artists?</p>

  <p>Amber decided to believe in his strength since she knew him.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The giant shield in the hands of the ogre martial artist at the front exploded with a violent crash.</p>

  <p>Opposite him was Zheng who dashed fluidly like a ghost as he continuously moved around the ogre martial artists.</p>

  <p>He moved so gracefully that he could still slip into the smallest gap like a wisp of smoke. He maintained an extremely close distance from the ogre martial artists, as if he was tailing them.</p>

  <p>Then, he stretched out his hand and slapped the back of an ogre martial artist's neck.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>The ogre martial artist fell on the ground with a dull thud.</p>

  <p>It was followed by his body exploding into a yellow ball of Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>Before the exploded Illusion Points could enter Zheng's body, he had already circled along a large blade. He even skimmed upward on its surface, as if not being afraid of getting cut at all.</p>

  <p>As soon as he rushed forward, he ruthlessly crushed his knee onto another ogre martial artist's face.</p>

  <p>Another ball of Illusion Points exploded!</p>

  <p>A huge number of Illusion Points crazily went after Zheng's figure.</p>

  <p>However, they still kept a distance of three inches away from him.</p>

  <p>The energy emitted by the Illusion Points was almost insignificant, but Zheng's body became as light as a feather after he activated the Eight Smoky Melodies.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Each of Zheng's movements was followed by a muffled sound, and with each sound, an ogre martial artist fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>All the fallen ogre martial artists were powerful. The weakest of them were core martial artists of tenth grade sacred places; and since they participated in the Illusion Battlefield, their weapons were at least second-rank divine weapons. There were even a few first-rank divine weapons.</p>

  <p>Yet, they couldn't catch Zheng's ghost-like figure. Even if they could, Zheng was like a loach that slipped away without a trace, and then floated away in a blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>If Zheng was interested in fighting back, he would directly twist the divine weapons in their hands into a pile of scrap metal.</p>

  <p>This battle was practically a joke. Even the spectators from the Demon Night felt powerless as they watched the fight. They tried to imagine if they were the ones who fought Zheng, but soon realized that they were no match for him either.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The last ogre martial artist fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>Only then did Zheng's light figure finally stop. At the same time, the Illusion Points that had been after him just started to rapidly enter his body.</p>

  <p>"These Illusion Points..." Zheng's eyes flashed, and went wide open after he had completely absorbed all the Illusion Points. His lips curved into a little smirk. "There are actually about a million Illusion Points."</p>

  <p>These ogre martial artists were not as powerful as their clansman Layne.</p>

  <p>But as the Illusion Battlefield had been open for an increasing amount of time, the Illusion Points began to gather in the bodies of a few warriors.</p>

  <p>If Zheng were to head towards the main city of the ogre martial artists once again, those powerful martial artists' accumulated Illusion Points would be many times greater than before.</p>

  <p>It took Zheng less than 90 seconds to kill these ogre martial artists.</p>

  <p>Not too far away from Zheng was the Falling Leaves Array that hadn't dispersed. The edges of the fallen leaves glowed with a faint golden light, and they clearly looked quite sharp.</p>

  <p>When Zheng's gaze swept past the fallen leaves and locked onto Aurora, he saw the wariness on her face.</p>

  <p>'I see. She didn't make a move just now because she didn't trust me, ' Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>Still, he didn't care since he had already found Amber.</p>

  <p>All the members of the Demon Night were now tense as they faced Zheng, since they knew they were powerless.</p>

  <p>The moment Zheng stepped forward, all the fallen leaves tumbled simultaneously and formed a mysterious Falling Leaves Array. They rolled on the ground with soft rustling sounds as they maintained the same direction, facing Zheng.</p>

  <p>Although Aurora didn't say anything, she gave Zheng an obvious warning.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng didn't seem to care at all as he walked towards Aurora.</p>

  <p>"Don't come over here," Aurora warned. The life vitality within her body began to spread out as she stared at Zheng with her pale blue eyes. Her fingers trembled slightly, as if she would make a move if Zheng took a step forward.</p>

  <p>Zheng continued to walk slowly with a smile on his face, as if he hadn't heard the warning.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, Zheng entered the Falling Leaves Array, and even stepped on a few leaves. Aurora's blue eyes had a murderous glare as she gritted her teeth. Zheng was too powerful, and she wouldn't be able to deal with him once he was out of the Falling Leaves Array.</p>

  <p>Just as Aurora was about to control the tens of thousands of leaves to attack Zheng, Amber also stepped into the Falling Leaves Array.</p>

  <p>"Amber?"</p>

  <p>Aurora was slightly surprised, but she saw that Amber had a slight smile on her face.</p>

  <p>Amber nodded at Aurora and said, "Don't worry. He's an old friend of mine."</p>

  <p>"He's your old friend?" Aurora couldn't help but be stunned.</p>

  <p>Amber continued to nod and smile, and then added, "Remember what I told you before? There is only one person in the universe who can change my fate, and that is him."</p>

  <p>Aurora was now even more surprised.</p>

  <p>During their adventures, Amber had told her briefly about what happened to her in her past.</p>

  <p>For example, how she had offended the Queen of Punishment, and how she was imprisoned and bore the cruel torture.</p>

  <p>Amber said that there was only one person in the universe who could save her. This person was the storyteller in the universe. He had a special Roaring Token. Moreover, even dozens of Supreme Lords couldn't do anything to him.</p>

  <p>If she followed what Amber said, then this person must be Zheng indeed.</p>

  <p>Even if he had many detractors, Zheng was already a legend in the universe.</p>

  <p>Despite his many feats, his strength set off a storm of speculation among martial artists.</p>

  <p>Some people said that since Zheng had inherited the fairy palace, his own power must be terrifying. He could go toe to toe against ace talents and Godly Geniuses of many various races.</p>

  <p>Others said that he was mediocre, and that he relied on external objects when he'd killed the Supreme Lords. He wasn't a powerhouse as he seemed to be, and was simply a nobody among the crowd.</p>

  <p>However, he could definitely fight the ace talents judging from the strength he had just displayed.</p>

  <p>Aurora's heart hammered in her ribcage as the legendary young man was standing right in front of her.</p>

  <p>Then, she asked, "Are you the Zheng that Amber mentioned?"</p>
