<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The power of the aura was incomprehensible by the Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>Besides Gibson, Woodruff, Ian and the other Holy Beings, who didn't belong to the alliance of the powerful clans, were all taken aback.</p>

  <p>"Who is this guy?"</p>

  <p>"As far as I know, Hamish who is the main sponsor of the alliance, doesn't practice the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent."</p>

  <p>"Have the other Yellow Emperor Guards been released?"</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings were astonished!</p>

  <p>The Demi-holy Beings and True Gods could also feel the overwhelming pressure.</p>

  <p>All the disciples of the powerful clans raised their heads to look at the sky.</p>

  <p>It felt like the ubiquitous aura was piercing through their chests with a kind of indescribable force.</p>

  <p>Everyone present in the Hall of Holy Beings, including Clark and Murphy, sucked in their breaths when they felt Leyton's aura.</p>

  <p>Leyton took two steps in the air and hovered above the middle hall, looking down at everyone.</p>

  <p>Soon, he seemed to have spotted someone in the distance. With his fingers pressed together, he pointed downwards.</p>

  <p>The Truth of Eternal Sword Intent accumulated on his fingertips, turning into a bright white sword light, and hit the floor of the Hall of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The sword light immediately penetrated the floating Hall of Holy Beings, leaving a small round hole on the floor.</p>

  <p>The sword light went straight through the Hall of Holy Beings, the Floating Island of the Dongfang Clan, and the Floating Island of the Sword Clan!</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The cyan tiles of a three-story building on the Floating Island of the Sword Clan were hit and they crumbled like a pack of cards. Then the sword light rushed towards Gibson.</p>

  <p>By the time Gibson realized what happened, it was too late for him to teleport himself.</p>

  <p>Before he could step into the space channel, the thin sword light went through his head all the way to his feet.</p>

  <p>The sword light did not stop there. It rapidly impaled the Floating Island of the Sword Clan. Leaving a long trail in the air, it penetrated through the Floating Islands of the Tang Clan and the Leng Clan and landed in the Time Sea at a certain angle.</p>

  <p>"Master Gibson!"</p>

  <p>"Holy Emperor Gibson!"</p>

  <p>"How are you? Are you okay?"</p>

  <p>When the members of the Sword Clan rushed into the building, they saw that Gibson was standing motionless. He could not move at all!</p>

  <p>The disciple standing in front touched Gibson and he fell to the ground with a thud. The group of disciples was stunned!</p>

  <p>They could not hear the conversations in the Hall of Holy Beings. They could only feel the powerful aura. Nobody could figure out why Gibson had been killed on their Floating Island just like that.</p>

  <p>"I have killed the Holy Being of the Sword Clan, but with the support of his universe, he can be brought back to life. This is just an easy punishment.</p>

  <p>The next time I attack, you will die once and for all," threatened Leyton.</p>

  <p>Hearing his words, all the Holy Beings turned pale.</p>

  <p>"He killed Gibson with a single move?"</p>

  <p>"He has terrifying strength!"</p>

  <p>"Gibson is one of the top five Holy Beings. He is powerful!"</p>

  <p>"None of that matters. The important thing is that he can kill Holy Beings forever and they will not be able to revive!"</p>

  <p>Holy Beings were not afraid of being killed because they would be reborn in less than two months, but what Leyton claimed to do had shocked them.</p>

  <p>If he could really kill the Holy Beings and destroy their universes, then they would no longer be immortal, which was their greatest gift!</p>

  <p>This brought back unpleasant memories of what happened several years ago to the Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>At that time, Nicholas was leading the alliance of the powerful clans to capture Lorena. Several Holy Beings of the alliance were devoured by the Lethal Fire Magma. No one knew what Lorena had done to the Holy Beings at that time. They were unable to be reborn, and their universes collapsed too.</p>

  <p>Sensing the fear of the Holy Beings present, Samuel put on a smug smile.</p>

  <p>He spoke once more, "Now it's time for you all to show up, right? Do you want me to send special invites to you all one by one?"</p>

  <p>His warning had the desired effect and as soon as he finished speaking, the Holy Beings appeared in the hall.</p>

  <p>They didn't take his words seriously before, but they didn't dare to disobey him seeing he had a powerhouse to support him.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the War God Hall of the Moon Clan, Woodruff was frowning and his face was gloomy.</p>

  <p>Hallet had visited the Moon Clan before. He wanted to join hands with the Moon Clan and the Sword Clan to fight against the alliance of the powerful clans.</p>

  <p>That was a smart move on his part, actually.</p>

  <p>It didn't matter how powerful Nicholas was, united they could beat him.</p>

  <p>The prospect of finishing Nicholas convinced the Moon Clan to join hands with the Sword Clan.</p>

  <p>Once the battle with the alliance of the powerful clans started, the Moon Clan would fight without hesitation.</p>

  <p>However, things had changed. Nicholas had actually died in the Abyss Demon Region, and now their new opponent was powerhouses at the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>Just then, someone appeared in the War God Hall with a flash.</p>

  <p>Seeing the shadow, Woodruff cupped his hands and yelled, "Shall we go to the Hall of Holy Beings, brother?"</p>

  <p>The person that Woodruff was addressing was Moon Li, the leader of the Moon Sect.</p>

  <p>The Moon Clan was made up of three forces: the Moon Sect led by Moon Li, the War God Hall led by Woodruff and the Mysterious Soul Building led by Vanessa.</p>

  <p>Among them, Vanessa was the only one who wasn't on the Floating Island.</p>

  <p>She was staying on the Hidden Tree in the south.</p>

  <p>Moon's face darkened. It was natural for anyone who had to face such a powerhouse to feel defenseless.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Let's see what Samuel and that powerhouse have in mind and then we can plan our strategy," said Moon.</p>

  <p>"But we can't just surrender to Samuel this way! We..." Woodruff gritted his teeth.</p>

  <p>"There's no need for us to fight Samuel. Let's find out their purpose first." A glint of smartness flashed in Moon's eyes.</p>

  <p>The Moon Clan was ranked third among all the powerful clans above the Time Sea. The three Holy Beings of the Moon Clan believed that they were by no means weaker than Samuel, so they were unwilling to surrender, but right now they had no choice given the current situation.</p>

  <p>"Let's go!"</p>

  <p>Buzz, buzz!</p>

  <p>The two of them stepped into the space channel and instantly appeared in the Hall of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>The moment Samuel saw Woodruff, his mouth twitched and he had a wicked smile. "Woodruff, you finally show up."</p>

  <p>Woodruff stood there sullenly and did not speak.</p>

  <p>"That day, you asked me what I relied on to challenge you. Is this powerful enough?" Samuel sneered and looked at him aggressively.</p>

  <p>Woodruff was not used to being taunted like this.</p>

  <p>He had always defied power. In fact he was the one who had the guts to oppose Nicholas. The War God Hall had never been afraid of war and death.</p>

  <p>The blue veins on his forehead protruded. Just as he was about to refute, Moon stopped him. He cupped his hands and yelled out to Samuel,</p>

  <p>"Samuel, why do you summon us to the Hall of Holy Beings today?"</p>

  <p> </p>
