<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 449 The Heavenly Sword (Part Two) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Their Sword Steps appeared to interlace with each other even as they competed, looking like a beautiful dance of sorts. The disciples of Cloud Sect were dazzled and expressed it in raised voices.</p>

  <p>"This... This is so captivating!"</p>

  <p>"It's a treat for the eyes. If I can practice the Sword Step this way someday, I would be so strong at the nature level!"</p>

  <p>"Huh. If you want to learn the Sword Step, you would need to comprehend the sword intent first. If you do comprehend it, you would be invincible at the nature level, but do you really think you can do it?"</p>

  <p>As people talked, Tianming struck first. Deciding to tip the balance scale, he launched an attack.</p>

  <p>He slid in his steps as if there was oil under his feet. When he finally stopped, thirteen sword intent cyclones dashed in Luo Zheng's direction.</p>

  <p>Six sword intent cyclones came from the front, three cyclones from the left and the right respectively, and the last one was from the air above.</p>

  <p>They moved in a whirlwind, blocking Luo Luo Zheng in all directions.</p>

  <p>"Nice." Facing the thirteen sword intent cyclones coming at him, Luo Luo Zheng too performed a slippery step. He created four sword intent cyclones. Even if his own sword intent cyclones were fewer than Tianming's, each cyclone was larger and more potent.</p>

  <p>Poof...</p>

  <p>The sword intent cyclones of the two opponents collided with each other and then shattered in the hit. It was a dead heat.</p>

  <p>Just then, Tianming unsheathed his sword.</p>

  <p>His attacks always went this way. At certain times, he wouldn't launch an attack at all, but once he attacked, he would fight non-stop, not giving any leeway. He had no plans to give the opponent a chance to even breathe halfway.</p>

  <p>"Megrez Sword!"</p>

  <p>This was Tianming's first time wielding his sword in this round.</p>

  <p>When he wielded the sword, his breath seemed to change. The Blood-corroding Sword in his hand blurred.</p>

  <p>What was stranger was that Tianming pointed the sword upward, the hilt tipping toward the ground. Luo Luo Zheng felt the strong sensation of pressure, as if the sky had fallen on him.</p>

  <p>'Has he cultivated the Heavenly Sword? He can borrow the power of the heavens?'</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng wondered at the scene before him as he raised his brows.</p>

  <p>Obviously, Tianming seemed to have borrowed heavens' powers to subdue Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The natural law of the heavens was profound. Millions of generations of humans couldn't see through it to this date. The power of the heavens was unmatched. After all, if the sky fell, who could fight it?</p>

  <p>But Tianming seemed to have borrowed a little of this power. He didn't have enough strength and hadn't yet touched the threshold of the natural law of the heavens, so he only had a tiny bit.</p>

  <p>But even that little bit of heavens' power was so dreadful that it gave Luo Luo Zheng a hard time. He felt like he had a terrible dead weight over him, making him unable to breathe.</p>

  <p>'Tianming is really powerful, but... this power was borrowed, and he can't control it. My own swordsmanship is certainly all in my control!'</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng chose not to retreat. Instead, he hit back with his basic swordsmanship. "Chop!"</p>

  <p>He made a simple arc. It was the most basic movement, but the power hidden in the sword was beyond the imagination of ordinary people.</p>

  <p>The greatest truths were the simplest of all. They reached the same goal by different means. No matter how they changed, they couldn't get to escape the simplest of sword moves.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The two swords collided with each other, a clear sound resounding in the arena.</p>

  <p>Many swordsmen would retreat if they didn't have the upper hand in the sword move and then try to attack more aggressively.</p>

  <p>However, neither of the two seemed to want to back out.</p>

  <p>Clang...</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the two opponents wielded their swords at each other seven or eight times in a row. They dodged the quick attack efficiently. It made the onlookers gawk at them in wonder.</p>

  <p>Both of them looked calm, as if they were not fighting with swords but sitting across each other in a silent game of chess.</p>

  <p>The disciples on the sidelines appeared far more nervous than the two on the competition field.</p>

  <p>Among warriors, swordsmen were the kings. They were also the most in number.</p>

  <p>As Tianming and Luo Luo Zheng fought, the disciples of Cloud Sect held their breaths at the spectacle before them. Some swordsmen even clinched their fists, beads of sweat trickling on their foreheads.</p>

  <p>As swordsmen, they comprehended what was happening in this match.</p>

  <p>The disciples wouldn't understand a fight between top powerful men of the Illuminating Soul Realm or those of other higher levels, let alone comprehend its intricacies.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Luo Luo Zheng and Tianming were strong, but not much more powerful than the other disciples. As long as the swordsmen got a gist of what was occurring behind the swordsmanship, they too could promote themselves. Some of them might even experience breakthroughs in such a situation.</p>

  <p>"They have wielded the sword fifty times now..."</p>

  <p>"A hundred times..."</p>

  <p>"A hundred and fifty times..."</p>

  <p>"Ugh..."</p>

  <p>Tianming sighed heavily, at last moving back in silence.</p>

  <p>He realized he couldn't prevail against Luo Luo Zheng when it came to swordsmanship, so it was meaningless to fight him through sword moves.</p>

  <p>There was simple power hidden behind Luo Zheng's basic swordsmanship. But when the simple went to the extreme, it became more complex.</p>

  <p>However, this was not a contradiction. It was just a complicated tactic.</p>

  <p>Tianming couldn't see through Luo Zheng's basic swordsmanship.</p>

  <p>As soon as Tianming stood steady at a distance, he drew a circle with the sharp sword in his hand casually. Life vitality spread out around him.</p>

  <p>Mixed with the sword intent, it made the Blood-corroding Sword buzz with life.</p>

  <p>"The light and dark swordsmanship! I am not cruel, but I must prove the power of the heavens!"</p>

  <p>Momentum spread across Tianming's body. His demeanor seemed to have changed, as if he were a spokesman of heaven in a world of humans. He looked like he was the son of heaven.</p>

  <p>"Megrez Sword! Dubhe Sword! Merak Sword! Phecda Sword! Start all four kinds!"</p>
