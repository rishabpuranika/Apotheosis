<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The power of a Supreme Lord was simply magnificent.</p>

  <p>If the several Supreme Lords present there released all of their powers at once, then they would probably be able to instantly shatter this giant Yellow Sand Star!</p>

  <p>They were restraining their strengths even when they were fighting for Luo Zheng's Immortal Mansion. In reality, they were not looking at this battle as a matter of life-and-death at all.</p>

  <p>But even so, the power that erupted from these Supreme Lords was far superior to that of an ordinary warrior. They were just beyond imaginable.</p>

  <p>As Addison roared in both anger and shock, the other several Supreme Lords all joined in the battle at the same time.</p>

  <p>The first target of these Supreme Lords was to get the mini Immortal Mansion located on the desert.</p>

  <p>Yao slightly furrowed her brows upon realizing that. Her eyes flashed with hostility when she immediately raised the Saint Thunder Meteor Hammer in her hand. As the hammer gently shook, it released a streak of lightning of a hundred thousand feet long!</p>

  <p>Countless beams of lightning circled her, forming a massive vortex around where she stood.</p>

  <p>The Thunder Law contained within this thunder had already reached the eighth layer or even the ninth layer!</p>

  <p>Even a Supreme Lord would have no choice but to back away if faced with a sharp vortex of thunder.</p>

  <p>Thus, the faces of the Supreme Lords were suddenly flooded with both surprise and anger. The Demon Night's Queen of Punishment really took action to attack without the slightest hesitation!</p>

  <p>All the other Supreme Lords were startled except for Yao, who remained calm and determined. How could she allow others to snatch away the things she wanted to get?</p>

  <p>After the lightning dissipated, she looked down and was slightly stunned, finding out that the mini Immortal Mansion was already gone!</p>

  <p>"It's too childish to expect to run away..."</p>

  <p>In Yao's eyes, relying on a space treasure to escape before so many Supreme Lords was simply daydreaming!</p>

  <p>She then gently raised her hand and instantly, a huge crack appeared at the edge of the desert on the Yellow Sand Star. It didn't even take a second when the crack continued to extend and circled the entire desert!</p>

  <p>Beneath the desert was soil and beneath the soil was a layer of rock stratum.</p>

  <p>"Rumble..."</p>

  <p>The desert, the soil below the Yellow Sand Star, the rock stratum and even the mantle underneath the star's surface were completely lifted by Yao.</p>

  <p>If one were to look from above the starlight, it seemed that a giant was holding a ladle, scooping up a large part of the Yellow Sand Star!</p>

  <p>She was that strong!</p>

  <p>There was a huge pit that was thousands of miles deep at the bottom of the dessert.</p>

  <p>After digging up the ground, Yao once again waved the Saint Thunder Meteor Hammer in her hand. With a light wave, the hammer burst with lightning and smashed into the desert!</p>

  <p>"Boom..."</p>

  <p>Right after the hammer drilled the desert, the entire desert started to collapse and disappear under such a strong attack.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>A tiny Immortal Mansion shot out from the debris as the ground broke and threw out dust from it.</p>

  <p>With a sneer, Yao began to chase after the Immortal Mansion again.</p>

  <p>The other Supreme Lords all began to move at the same time. Yao might be slightly stronger than them but it was still extremely difficult for a Supreme Lord to kill another Supreme Lord. More so, those who were skilled with spatial transference.</p>

  <p>The several Supreme Lords passed through space and headed toward the mini Immortal Mansion too.</p>

  <p>Yao wielded the Saint Thunder Meteor Hammer once again to disturb her opponents. The power of this strike was more than twice as great as the previous strike under the infusion of a dense amount of Faith Energy.</p>

  <p>"Humph! Do you really think we're afraid of you?"</p>

  <p>A crimson fire ring suddenly appeared in the hand of one of the Supreme Lords. His body was erupting with fire.</p>

  <p>"Heavenly Annihilating Flame!"</p>

  <p>An extremely terrifying heat shot all over the place when he released his fire ring. Cracks appeared in the space around the fire ring and the space started to collapse continuously. Even the space could not withstand the power of fire. Then, the red fire ring continuously circled in the air and went straight for Yao.</p>

  <p>Another Supreme Lord also took action and attacked Yao right at that moment. As his hands flicked out, his entire figure seemed to be floating in the water. He stretched out his hands and pointed at Yao, freezing her before softly whispering, "Break!"</p>

  <p>"Crack..."</p>

  <p>A strange crack suddenly appeared right where Yao was standing.</p>

  <p>Shockingly, the crack spread through Yao's body!</p>

  <p>Yao's entire body was enveloped in a thick Mu Ning of Faith Energy by that time. The Faith Energy was the solid foundation of strength for her to battle against the Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, the crack that appeared in the space was a very strange method of attack. It was extremely overbearing and had directly split the Faith Energy apart. A moment after and a gash appeared on Yao's bare right shoulder, making her blood burst out from the fresh opening!</p>

  <p>If the crack continued to extend, it would directly split Yao's body into two!</p>

  <p>It was at that moment when the Saint Sky Armor on Yao's body suddenly flickered with a rich light. Many streaks of strange and obscure light appeared on the surface of the Saint Sky Armor, forcefully stopping the crack from extending any further!</p>

  <p>This was, after all, a Saint Sky Armor. In the entire universe, this Saint Sky Armor was a defensive supreme divine weapon and was incomparable.</p>

  <p>Although Yao succeeded in avoiding the first attack by using the Saint Sky Armor, the blood-red fire ring of the other Supreme Lord swept towards her.</p>

  <p>Other than these two Supreme Lords, the other two Supreme Lords were also eyeing her like tigers eyeing their prey. It was really hard for Yao to resist the siege of four Supreme Lords at once. However, retreating was not necessary in her mind right now.</p>

  <p>Since these four Supreme Lords attacked and delayed her, Yao failed to obtain Luo Zheng's mini Immortal Mansion again. The palace drilled into another desert on the Yellow Sand Star while all the clamor was happening.</p>

  <p>It was clear to the Supreme Lords that the mini Immortal Mansion wouldn't escape them regardless of what it could do. Therefore, the most important thing for them now was to deal with Yao, who had every intention of taking the mini palace away.</p>

  <p>Those Supreme Lords had different ideas and plans in their minds. Some wanted to sit down and discuss while others wanted to get a chance to take the Immortal Mansion directly. However, none of them expected Yao to appear and go straight to the Immortal Mansion in an exceptionally domineering manner. Thus, she became the center of their attention, making some of the Supreme Lords want to besiege her.</p>

  <p>Now that they had joined hands to force Yao to back away, one of the Supreme Lords tried to catch up to the mini Immortal Mansion. He intended to grab the tiny space treasure first regardless of anything.</p>

  <p>Within the Immortal Mansion, Luo Luo Zheng, Xun, and Saul were closely watching the battle outside.</p>

  <p>Saul was the one who was controlling the Immortal Mansion at that time. He commanded it to drill into the desert again. With a huge grin on his face, he said, "I'll transform the Immortal Mansion once more!"</p>

  <p>Although the Immortal Mansion was transformed from a token with the word 'mountain' embedded on it, it could also freely morph into various shapes. After entering the interior of the Yellow Sand Star, it directly transformed into a palm-sized stone!</p>

  <p>Just as the Immortal Mansion had completed its transformation, a Supreme Lord waved his hand and once again the massive desert was dug out from the Yellow Sand Star. The Supreme Lord used the same method as Yao's and then burnt the desert with the blazing flames.</p>

  <p>Being burnt by the flames, the desert sand turned into numerous transparent crystals which began to melt.</p>

  <p>Not long after, a desert of one hundred miles long had been burnt down and only a little part of it was left. A few scattered items fell to the large hole at the bottom of the Yellow Sand Star.</p>

  <p>As a stone among the items, the Immortal Mansion kept tumbling in the air before falling into the hole and stopped moving.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lord got no clue that what he was searching for just flew out somewhere!</p>

  <p>"Huh?" A wondering expression appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>He stood bewildered, looking at his empty hand. He almost grabbed it!</p>

  <p>How could the Immortal Mansion disappear? He had burned the entire desert, yet he couldn't find that Immortal Mansion again.</p>

  <p>"There was no space fluctuation happening right now. That space treasure must be on top of the Yellow Sand Star!" another Supreme Lord said indifferently.</p>

  <p>"Humph! I reckon that the Immortal Mansion must be here." Another Supreme Lord began to count on his fingers and try to figure out the palace's location. As long as the Crown of Destiny wasn't carried by anyone, it wasn't difficult to figure out its position. Moreover, the Supreme Lord was not far away from the Crown of Destiny, so it would not be so complicated to deduce its location!</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lord, who was calculating the space, suddenly turned towards the Yellow Sand Star. Then with a frown, he muttered, "It is indeed still on the Yellow Sand Star but what happened just now?"</p>
