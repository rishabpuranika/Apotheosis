<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, the wall around where the Warden race had gathered was only ten feet high.</p>

  <p>It was built as such because their race never thought that they would be invaded. Besides, their city wall was only a form.</p>

  <p>When Spark and the two exiles escaped, a man climbed over the low city wall!</p>

  <p>Spark recognized the man on the city wall as the Nine Li race member who had fought David before. Even Tyler had failed to defeat him at that time.</p>

  <p>The man, who was actually Zheng, met Spark's gaze. He smiled a bit then jumped down.</p>

  <p>Instead of chasing after Spark, however, he went straight to Sandy!</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>A swishing sound came from Sandy and her billowing cloak. Although she couldn't fly, she was extremely light and moved rapidly along the street.</p>

  <p>On the other side was Zheng who continuously jumped up and down along the high and low houses. He took advantage of the topography and ran much faster than Sandy.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, Sandy heard footsteps from her right.</p>

  <p>She looked around confusedly and saw Zheng, who wasn't far away from her.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry. Someone wants you to stay," Zheng said softly with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Really?" she sneered.</p>

  <p>She didn't know where he came from, but if he was able to catch up with her, then it only meant one thing.</p>

  <p>He was very powerful.</p>

  <p>Even then, she didn't panic.</p>

  <p>The Warden race couldn't completely get rid of the Strength Equalizing Theurgy just like what Zelda had said, but the Chaos Ancient God had bestowed them with something that could help them in this situation.</p>

  <p>"Swish!"</p>

  <p>At that moment, she ran forward and gently tugged at the belt on her waist.</p>

  <p>The cloak which was previously wrapped tightly around her began to split from the top to the bottom. Her long, white hair flowed freely as well.</p>

  <p>The people of the Warden race always wore that cloak, and rarely took it off in the presence of others. They only removed it when they were engaged in a fight.</p>

  <p>Sandy's cloak revealed her flexible figure. Her lips moved slightly. Then a blue beam of light flashed from her elbows and a unique type of energy began to form.</p>

  <p>"The fluctuation of the energy..." Zheng muttered.</p>

  <p>He now looked seriously at Sandy as he moved along with her on the roof.</p>

  <p>It was known that all the exiles had become mortals, or beings just slightly stronger than mortals under the influence of the Strength Equalizing Theurgy.</p>

  <p>Despite that, a member of the Warden race could actually unleash an unimaginably great amount of power with an ordinary physical body.</p>

  <p>"But you are just daydreaming," Sandy whispered. With a wave of her hand, the blue energy accumulated some more and soon turned into two sharp blades.</p>

  <p>She held her blades proudly and grinned at Zheng. Suddenly, her body twisted!</p>

  <p>"Swish!"</p>

  <p>A blue ring of light flew towards Zheng!</p>

  <p>"Hoo, hoo, Hoo..."</p>

  <p>The ring of light moved at an extremely fast speed. In a moment of desperation, Zheng turned over and rolled down from the roof. He stretched his arms on the ground to support himself until he could stand steadily.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the house behind him collapsed when the ring of light cut through it.</p>

  <p>"Boom! Boom! Boom..."</p>

  <p>The ring of light didn't stop. After one broken house, it went straight and destroyed dozens of houses!</p>

  <p>If it weren't for the Strength Equalizing Theurgy, its power would be nothing. Any of the Wild Gods could easily destroy their place.</p>

  <p>Yet, it was astonishing that Sandy could reach such an extent after she just launched a sword strike.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh, whoosh!" The wind blew as Sandy gently waved the two sharp blades and sneered at Zheng.</p>

  <p>Although she couldn't kill him right now, she still felt a bit complacent.</p>

  <p>"Are you still going to chase me? If you leave now, I can give you a chance and spare your life," said she.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Zheng stopped looking at the damaged houses and turned to her. "I don't need your chance," he answered with a smile.</p>

  <p>Hearing his words, her face burned red with anger. She waved her sharp blades and rushed towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>Since she had originally intended to kill Zheng anyway, she would do it as fast as she could. She just had to finish him before that group of intruders surrounded her, or she would be in great trouble.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>She wielded the blades in the air and they turned into two, huge crescents, which chopped at Zheng from both sides.</p>

  <p>Because she attacked him with such a formidable move, he performed the Sword Step and gently twisted his body to dodge the blades.</p>

  <p>"Those are very exquisite movements, but how long can you dodge?"</p>

  <p>Sandy snickered.</p>

  <p>Just then, the blue light that glowed around her hands shot towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>After that, all her strikes became fiercer and faster!</p>

  <p>Zheng kept a tight grip on his sword with one hand as he dodged the attacks.</p>

  <p>He maintained a distance of about four feet from Sandy all throughout.</p>

  <p>With his nimble bodily movement skill, he shuttled through Sandy's light blades.</p>

  <p>Anyone who would watch them would be worried about Zheng. After all, even the smallest mistake could get him cut into pieces. However, Zheng even seemed to be happy.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, Sandy became restless after having launched dozens of strikes. The man was more difficult to deal with than she had expected!</p>

  <p>If Zheng's reinforcements arrived, then she would not be able to leave!</p>

  <p>She couldn't help but hiss at the thought of it. The two blue sharp blades intertwined with each other and she pushed Zheng with the blades, forcing him to retreat.</p>

  <p>However, she suddenly stopped.</p>

  <p>The corners of her lips twitched slightly. Then the two blades quickly changed their direction and charged towards Zheng's shoulders.</p>

  <p>If she could hit him, then his shoulders would be amputated.</p>

  <p>At that point, however, he raised his head and smiled at her as he held a long sword across his chest.</p>

  <p>His smile confused her. In reality, what he actually planned to do was to use an ordinary long sword to block her two sharp blades, which she thought was silly, because her sharp blades could cut his sword and his body into pieces.</p>

  <p>This young man should know about that well because he had always refused to use his sword to touch her sharp blades. Therefore, why did he resist the attack in such a stupid way this time?</p>

  <p>They just fought for a short while, and she didn't have time to think about his behavior which puzzled her.</p>

  <p>As soon as she cut towards Zheng with her two sharp blades, Zheng's arm quietly released a little green Truth Crystal. Then, a green beam of light quickly spread along his arm and covered his long sword.</p>

  <p>"Clang!"</p>

  <p>There was a loud, crashing sound from the collision, but the scene that Sandy had anticipated did not happen.</p>

  <p>Zheng, however, had discovered her flaws while she was confused.</p>
