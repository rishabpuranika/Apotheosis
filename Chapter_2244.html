  <p>
</p>

  <p>Pascal Han did not possess a very impressive height nor was he physically appealing. However, after he entered the hall, he gave a remarkable aura.</p>

  <p>Most of the playboys and disciples of the wealthy clans in the Floating Islands were already proving godly warriors, low-rank True Gods, or mid-rank True Gods.</p>

  <p>After reaching the level of the top-rank True God, they stopped their practices and focused on reaching the consummation of True God Realm and other higher levels. The mid-rank True Gods had the supreme power among the wealthy clans. After all, their cultivation level was the most powerful one in this circle and their strength was naturally the strongest.</p>

  <p>Pascal ranked first in the mid-rank True Gods, and was also the strongest among the younger generation of these clans.</p>

  <p>Hence, Pascal scoffed at these so called 'playboys'.</p>

  <p>These playboys were divided into four to five circles depending on their clan backgrounds. In the past, they had tried to impress Pascal, but he rarely bothered about them much.</p>

  <p>Pascal glanced at Langston indifferently and looked around. Soon, his eyes fell on Liusu.</p>

  <p>The slap received from Langston was quite hard. Her swollen cheek and clear palm print were proofs of that.</p>

  <p>Pascal's blood boiled when he saw the palm print and he asked coldly,</p>

  <p>"Who hit you?"</p>

  <p>Before Liusu could say anything, Aleyna pointed at Langston and shouted, "He was the idiot who hit her!"</p>

  <p>With his eyes fixed on Langston, Pascal replied casually, "You are a bold man, Langston, to do such a gross thing."</p>

  <p>Langston asked coldly, "Pascal, do you even know what your sister did?"</p>

  <p>Langston firmly believed that he had the right to teach Liusu a lesson.</p>

  <p>After all, she was to marry into their clan sooner or later. No man could remain indifferent after what she did.</p>

  <p>But Pascal was slowly advancing towards Langston as he said, "I don't care what my sister has done. Whoever dares to hit her, he or she must be prepared to face the consequences!"</p>

  <p>Seeing Pascal approach him, Langston started to retreat. He raised his hands in defense and continued to explain, "Pascal, there is a reasonable explanation for everything. Our Leng Clan..."</p>

  <p>Langston thought that after hearing his own clan's name, Pascal might stop. After all, the Leng Clan was much richer and more powerful than the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>But Pascal left him with zero chance.</p>

  <p>Everyone felt that a great force was about to be released. All of a sudden, everyone's shoulders got heavy. Soon, Pascal was rushing towards Langston at an unbelievable speed.</p>

  <p>Pascal didn't even use his Godly Tile, to crash into his shoulder.</p>

  <p>Pascal ranked first in the mid-rank True Gods, while Langston was fifth.</p>

  <p>In general, the difference between their strengths shouldn't have been too big. But this was not the case here. While the competition among mid-rank True Gods was extremely fierce, this was only reflected between the second and eighth places.</p>

  <p>There was a cutthroat competition among the seven disciples from the second to the eighth place. For example, Langston just ranked third last month, but now he dropped to the fifth place. There was not much difference in the strengths of these seven people.</p>

  <p>However, the one in the ninth place was no match for these seven people.</p>

  <p>Similarly, these seven people were no match for Pascal.</p>

  <p>In the Arena of Legends, these seven people were all defeated by Pascal.</p>

  <p>Langston Leng, had been defeated by Pascal four times, in the Arena of Legends. Although Langston tried his best, he was nevertheless defeated with no great effort by Pascal. And that was the most humiliating part.</p>

  <p>When he met this guy again outside the Arena of Legends, Langston had no desire to fight him at all.</p>

  <p>Even after Pascal's attack, Langston did not try to fight back. He kept moving backwards, while trying to dodge the attack. Even though his speed was not slow, Pascal's speed was even faster.</p>

  <p>When he realized that he was unable to avoid Pascal's attack, Langston gritted his teeth and twisted his body. Two golden Sanskrit words appeared at the back of his hands.</p>

  <p>As the rising hope of the younger generation of the Leng Clan, Langston had obtained a lot of favors from his clan. These two golden Sanskrit words had always been his trump card, and it was totally unnecessary for him to use them to deal with Zheng before. Now facing Pascal, he didn't hesitate at all. In the eyes of all the mid-rank True Gods, Pascal was considered a monster.</p>

  <p>"Is that really necessary?" Noticing the golden Sanskrit words at the back of Langston's hands, Pascal smirked as he stretched out his hand and pulled him from a distance.</p>

  <p>An intense invisible force had Langston hurled towards Pascal.</p>

  <p>Before Langston could even react, Pascal slapped him hard on the face.</p>

  <p>This slap was much more powerful than the one Langston had slapped on Liusu's face. However, Pascal still had some mercy. Otherwise, with his comprehension of the Godly Way, this slap could have slashed Langston's head off.</p>

  <p>In the Arena of Legends, many people had been slapped by Pascal and most of them were almost beheaded.</p>

  <p>Clap!</p>

  <p>The sound reverberated in the hall.</p>

  <p>Langston twisted and rolled in the air for a distance of more than 100 feet, before he slumped into a corner of the wall and passed out.</p>

  <p>"I don't know or even care what the rules are. Whoever dares to touch my family must ask himself if he has the strength to face my wrath!"</p>

  <p>Pascal shouted. His words seemed to be directed at both Langston and the playboys present from the wealthy clans.</p>

  <p>... "Pascal, your clan is at the mercy of our clan now. Do you really think you can have a good life after you offended our clan?" Another voice came from the crowd. It was Langston's cousin, Hogan Leng.</p>

  <p>When Hogan saw his elder cousin being thrashed mercilessly, he felt humiliated and angry. That was why he threatened Pascal with the Leng Clan.</p>

  <p>Everyone was aware that the Han Clan cherished Leng Clan's support, so Langston being bullied by the Han Clan was not at all acceptable.</p>

  <p>Pascal sneered, "You mean you have the capabilities to represent the Leng Clan? Or for that matter, can that guy lying senseless on the floor, represent the Leng Clan?"</p>

  <p>As the fourth-ranked clan, the Leng Clan's situation was complicated.</p>

  <p>Even if the Leng Clan was willing to let Langston marry Liusu, it didn't mean that Langston had a very high position in the clan. Just like Pascal, even if he ranked the first in the mid-rank True Gods, it did not make great deal of difference. What he represented was only the future of the Han Clan, but even then he didn't have much say in it.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of the Holy Beings, the Arena of Legends was just a game for the children. If one wanted to obtain full strength in their own clan, they should be able to at least stand for themselves and be heard among others after reaching the consummation of True God Realm. This was the rule of most wealthy clans.</p>

  <p>Hogan was speechless after Pascal's statement. Because what Pascal said was indeed the truth.</p>

  <p>"Now get out of our Han Clan's Floating Island," Pascal shouted angrily.</p>

  <p>The people from the other wealthy clans slightly trembled as they heard Pascal. Having left with nothing to say, they walked out of the hall with their heads bowed. Hogan also followed them, carrying Langston on his shoulder. Before he left, Hogan said, "It is true that we are no one to represent the Leng Clan, but someone has to be responsible for Sheridan's death."</p>

  <p>As he said this, Hogan glared at Zheng before leaving.</p>

  <p>Earlier, as soon as Pascal had entered the hall, he noticed a pool of blood in the middle of the hall. But at that time he was not aware that Sheridan had been killed.</p>

  <p>After the men left, he asked with a cool expression, "Who killed Sheridan?"</p>

  <p>Those men from the wealthy clans might not have decision-making power amongst themselves, but if they died, then things would get terribly serious.</p>

  <p>It was the same case like children when at home might not have much power, but if something happened to them, the parents would definitely demand an explanation. And the wealthy clans were no exception.</p>

  <p>"It's him who killed Sheridan," said one of the disciples of the Han Clan, pointing at Zheng.</p>

  <p>Pascal turned his head and stared at Zheng. He was a little confused, and then asked coldly, "Who are you?"</p>
