<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3377 Fierce Ants </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The hook with bait shot past the warriors and went directly towards the stone pillar. Afterwards, Chaim slightly shook his hand to simulate movement of the bait.</p>

  <p>Almost instantly, a series of red lights flashed within the small holes of the stone pillar. Around six or seven creatures rushed out of the holes and ripped the bait off the hook. They immediately withdrew back into the pillar. Their movements were as quick as lightning.</p>

  <p>In spite of their speed, Luo Zheng had no difficulty in seeing them clearly. He realized what the creatures were almost at once.</p>

  <p>"Those creatures are ants?" Luo Zheng couldn't believe his eyes. But he could not be mistaken.</p>

  <p>Those ants had half of an arm's length. Their tentacles were shining with a bright scarlet light. They also had big jaws that glinted dangerously. Upon observation, it was obvious that they were poisonous.</p>

  <p>Chaim nodded as he confirmed what Luo Zheng had surmised. With a frown, he said, "They must be the kind of wild and ferocious ants unique to the Chaotic Source World. They are highly poisonous. There is no doubt that we must not approach them."</p>

  <p>Having said this, he pointed to an area not that far away from them.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked towards the direction he pointed. There, a member of the Celestial Wolf race lay lifeless on the ground. He had a black mass all over his body. Clearly, he died due to the poison that spread in his system.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng turned his head back at the stone pillar. He pondered for a while and then said, "It seems like these ants do not intend to leave their nests. Is it possible to attack them with the Other Shore Tokens?"</p>

  <p>"My Other Shore Token is of the descending type, Luo Zheng. Watch this," Sally said as she wanted to demonstrate something to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>A little round ball materialized from Sally's hand. It seemed really heavy and compact. Its surface was covered with a rainbow-like luster.</p>

  <p>This Other Shore Token was known as the Iridescent Stone unique to Stage Thirteen that contained astonishing Other Shore Power. Upon throwing it, the user would be able to control its movement to hit the target accurately.</p>

  <p>Sally launched the Iridescent Stone towards the stone pillar. It soared towards the target with such accuracy.</p>

  <p>Pew! Boom!</p>

  <p>The incredible power of the Iridescent Stone caused ripples in the space as it flew in the air. It heavily crashed upon the stone pillar.</p>

  <p>The blow must have unleashed over a thousand divine megatons of force. It was truly remarkable.</p>

  <p>Even strong warriors like Chaim would not be able to take that kind of hit head on. It was a force that could probably cause a mountain to collapse upon impact.</p>

  <p>Sally might seem like a delicate beauty. However, her strength should not be underestimated.</p>

  <p>Dong!</p>

  <p>No matter how strong the attack was, it only crashed upon its target with a dull thud. The pillar only trembled a little. Apart from that, it appeared completely unharmed.</p>

  <p>The pillar itself could not have been that sturdy. The only possible explanation for this would be many Chaotic Source Spirits were probably hiding inside it.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Iridescent Stone Sally had thrown just now disappeared from where it crashed into the pillar. Instantaneously, it reappeared in her hand.</p>

  <p>"The Other Shore Tokens that Sally and the member of the Celestial Wolf race have belong to the descending type. They are not particularly afraid of the deadly poison those vicious ants possess. Even after several rounds of attacks, however, the pillar remained intact. One thing can be deduced from that. There might be many Chaotic Source Spirits hiding inside the pillar," explained Chaim.</p>

  <p>The distinct characteristic of a Chaotic Source Spirit was that it could absorb power. No matter how strong the attack was, it would just absorb it all.</p>

  <p>Because of this distinct feature, many powerful masters in the Source World underwent the Chaotic Source Reinforcement to raise the level of their body strength.</p>

  <p>However, this characteristic made the Chaotic Source Spirits extremely difficult to capture.</p>

  <p>It would be a much easier task if there was only one Chaotic Source Spirit hidden in the rock. They could just tire it out by unleashing continued attacks and then break the rock to capture it. Luo Zheng had successfully done this before.</p>

  <p>However, this was a different matter. There were many Chaotic Source Spirits hidden together inside the rock. Therefore, they were probably even more powerful. Naturally, it was out of the question to exhaust them all. It would be too difficult and energy-consuming. This seemingly ordinary stone pillar was actually tough to break.</p>

  <p>To top it off, there were poisonous ants that built their nests inside the stone pillar. This made it more troublesome to deal with. No one would be able to come close to it.</p>

  <p>Chaim was a wise man. Nevertheless, there was nothing else he could do after trying so many times and failing each time. This situation seemed hopeless.</p>

  <p>"How about you, Luo Zheng? Do you have an idea?" Chaim asked with an air of frustration.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng pondered upon this problem for a while. After observing the stone pillar, he responded, "If there are many Chaotic Source Spirits hidden in the stone pillar, I'm afraid one or two people are not enough to break it."</p>

  <p>"Of course. That much is obvious," replied Chaim with a nod.</p>

  <p>"Then, that leaves us with one option. Let's kill those ants first," said Luo Zheng with a confident smile.</p>

  <p>Actually, he had another simple and crude tactic up his sleeve. He could use that chess board to summon the Regal Jade Beasts. The Regal Jade Beasts should not be afraid of the poison of these ants. But many divine crystals would be consumed. Moreover, Luo Zheng had no intention of using the Civilization Artifact this early.</p>

  <p>"That is easier said than done. These vicious ants are very strong." A werewolf of the Celestial Wolf race was listening to their conversation. He couldn't help but chime in. His clansman was poisoned to death. Needless to say, he was very afraid of the fearsome ants.</p>

  <p>In actuality, the beasts in the Source World were not that powerful. Those that were not very intelligent were even less powerful. Because of their low intelligence, they were unable to cultivate the Truth of Godly Way and could not bear an Other Shore Token. Therefore, their strength was not on the same level as that of the warriors at the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>Soon after the werewolf shared his opinion, a strange expression crossed Luo Zheng's face. "I'll give it a try," he replied boldly.</p>

  <p>He was not afraid of the poison. He might as well try to kill these pesky ants.</p>

  <p>As soon as he said this, he rushed towards the stone pillar. In the blink of an eye, he was standing right next to it.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, please be careful!"</p>

  <p>Naturally, Chaim knew that Luo Zheng was truly extraordinary.</p>

  <p>Though he didn't know that Luo Zheng was the man known as Tianxing in the Dark Region, the treatment he received at the gate of the Chaotic Source World was good enough to prove his strength.</p>

  <p>Chaim thought that Luo Zheng's aura was somewhat similar to Tianxing's.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, it didn't really matter whether they were the same person or not.</p>

  <p>Sally looked extremely nervous while watching Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The moment Luo Zheng approached the pillar, it trembled slightly. He felt as though there was some kind of power emanating from it. However, it vanished instantly. This made Luo Zheng feel a little uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>Shortly after, red lights flickered inside the small holes on the pillar again.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, dozens of ants rushed out of the stone pillar. They flapped the wings on their backs and headed straight towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Chaim, Sally, and the others were over a thousand feet away. But as soon as they saw the poisonous ants flying in the sky, they were all forced to retreat.</p>

  <p>If the ants chased after them, they would escape from the cave without a second thought.</p>

  <p>"Their speed is astounding!"</p>

  <p>As the ants flew fast and circled around Luo Zheng, they appeared like solid black lines. The speed of their flight was way beyond Luo Zheng's expectation.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The ants circled Luo Zheng a few more times before they opened their mouths and charged towards Luo Zheng. Their huge clicking jaws looked absolutely menacing.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng moved his feet slightly and levitated in the air. With slight twists and turns, he perfectly avoided the attacks of the ants.</p>

  <p>At the same time, he grabbed a fierce ant by its abdomen and forcefully smashed it on the ground.</p>

  <p>However, the ant just turned its body in an incredibly unusual angle and sank its huge jaws into Luo Zheng's arm.</p>

  <p>Puff! Puff!</p>

  <p>Both its left and right jaws were able to puncture Luo Zheng's skin.</p>

  <p>"What? Unbelievable!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was absolutely startled.</p>

  <p>He realized that he clearly underestimated the strength of these ferocious ants. He didn't activate the Shade Stone liquid to protect his body. Thus, the ant was able to pierce his skin directly.</p>

  <p>This was why even strong warriors like Chaim were incapable of dealing with these ants.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng!" Sally screamed as she saw Luo Zheng getting bitten by the poisonous ant.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng!" Chaim yelled together with Sally. This was not a good sight to behold.</p>

  <p>Chaim was thoroughly shocked at how reckless Luo Zheng was. He did not expect this at all.</p>

  <p>A look of disdain appeared upon the faces of the others who witnessed this.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng seemed like a highly important figure. However, he turned out to be a foolishly reckless man who underestimated his enemy. Now, he'd gotten himself killed because of his carelessness and impatience.</p>
