  <p>
</p>

  <p>Any Life and Death Realm warrior was bound to undergo the first Small Heavenly Tribulation before they reached the realm.</p>

  <p>Almost everyone who could obtain a title on the Talent Tablet would manage to do one thing during the tribulation for sure: activate their Lotus Flowers.</p>

  <p>What Max did not know was that Luo Luo Zheng had undergone his Small Heavenly Tribulation at the Feather Emperor Island. At that time, the group of Spirit Supreme Realm warriors from the Celestial Position race were still in the Heavenly Stellar Sacred Place and trying to figure out a way to lure out the Evil Dragon. Obviously, they knew nothing about what had happened back then and just how far Luo Luo Zheng had gone!</p>

  <p>It was only now that this crucial question finally crossed Max's mind.</p>

  <p>He knew that almost all titled warriors could summon a Lotus Flower.</p>

  <p>What he was curious about was the kind of Lotus Flower that had appeared during Luo Zheng's first Small Heavenly Tribulation.</p>

  <p>Was it a three-petal Lotus Flower? A five-petal one? Or perhaps a seven-petal one? Nine-petal?</p>

  <p>The golden Celestial Position title was already extremely rare and extraordinary, which meant that although it would have been Luo Zheng's first time going through a Heavenly Tribulation, he was very likely to have summoned a seven-petal or a nine-petal Lotus Flower. Even a Mahayana Lotus Flower wasn't out of the question either.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, when you went through the Small Heavenly Tribulation, did a Lotus Flower appear in the sky?" Max finally couldn't hold off and enquired in a low voice.</p>

  <p>There was a trace of respect in his voice. His attitude towards Luo Luo Zheng had completely changed now.</p>

  <p>Truth be told, that was because he was very clear on what it meant for the Celestial Position race to find a golden Celestial Position warrior in this world. As an expert at the Spirit Supreme Realm, he was much stronger than Luo Luo Zheng at present. However, the latter was like a seed with unlimited potential. His future showed promise and that was enough for Max to respect this guy.</p>

  <p>Even the arrogance of Delroy had been swept away now. A truth that he never would have believed had just been proven correct right in front of him, and he now knew one thing: there was nothing he had that gave him a right to be proud in front of Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>All warriors from the Celestial Position race focused their eyes on Luo Zheng's face, waiting for him to answer Max's question. They had been curious about this too.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng hesitated for a moment when he saw so many eyes focused on him.</p>

  <p>Then he replied, "Yes. It did."</p>

  <p>"How many petals? How many petals did your Lotus Flower have?"</p>

  <p>Delroy was even more curious than Max and forgot all about his arrogance.</p>

  <p>It was hard to explain just how the Lotus Flower and its petals were linked to one's talents. The more petals it had, the greater was one's possibility of surpassing the heaven. And talent had an effect on a warrior's cultivation speed which increased with talent. Yet there was, for sure, a link between the Lotus Flower and the talent. People with low talents were usually unable to summon a Lotus Flower, and those with higher talents usually managed to conjure up a flower with more petals than those with lesser talents.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng asked with a smile, "How many petals did your Lotus Flower have?"</p>

  <p>"You want to know about me first?" Max was surprised. That was a strange way to answer a question; by asking the same thing himself. He smiled and replied, "After stepping into the Spirit Supreme Realm, I made my Lotus Flower reveal seven petals."</p>

  <p>A seven-petal Lotus Flower was rare enough in his eyes. Even if there were many geniuses in the Celestial Position race, very few warriors could have achieved that. Most were unable to surpass five.</p>

  <p>Following Max, Delroy also said, "I summoned a five-petal Lotus Flower during my last Heavenly Tribulation."</p>

  <p>Dorothea smiled sweetly, "My Lotus Flower also had five petals."</p>

  <p>She hadn't obtained a title on the Talent Tablet, and her talent was lower than Max's and Delroy's, but thanks to her efforts, she had still managed to summon a five-petal Lotus Flower.</p>

  <p>"Well," Luo Luo Zheng nodded his head. It was kind of embarrassing to tell about his own flower now, "During my Heavenly Tribulation, my Lotus Flower revealed thirty-five petals in total."</p>

  <p>"Thirty-five!" Woody's voice choked with astonishment and he almost screamed.</p>

  <p>Delroy and Dorothea also widened their eyes in shock. Thirty-five! That was truly beyond their imagination. A seven or nine petal flower would have already been far-fetched. But THIRTY-FIVE!</p>

  <p>Max, however, remained calm. He knew that the golden Celestial Position title meant that everything about Luo Luo Zheng was already far beyond their imagination. He commented in a faint voice, "So it was a Mahayana Lotus Flower then. With one more petal, it would have been a perfect Lotus."</p>

  <p>"What happens if one creates a perfect Lotus?" Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Max chuckled and replied, "You will know it when you activate the last petal."</p>

  <p>As they were discussing about the Lotus Flower, their ears picked up a ruckus beside the Talent Tablet. Something was happening!</p>

  <p>The puppets they controlled were now on the tenth floor. Although they were already incompatible and eye-catching, the creatures within the tenth floor seemed to be more curious about the warrior who had been tested for his talent in the Talent Tablet anyway.</p>

  <p>They looked past the crowd and saw the door into the Talent Tablet open from inside. A young human walked out gracefully, calm and composed of himself despite the ruckus that most probably, he himself had caused.</p>

  <p>He had an ordinary appearance, and he only possessed the cultivation base of a tenth-level war general. However, his expression was full of confidence and there was some air around him that made him the center of attention.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the words on the Talent Tablet began to change. A layer of faint silver luster enveloped the wall and eventually dissolved away to morph the word 'Asura.'</p>

  <p>"Asura: Klein Zhao."</p>

  <p>The letters appeared right below Luo Zheng's name.</p>

  <p>"What? How did Klein manage to achieve that? I never expected that he would have such amazing talent! He has already surpassed everyone on the first row and ranks only behind Luo Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>"Doesn't this mean that Klein's talent is second only to Luo Zheng's? Oh my god, what the hell is going on with the human race these days? Two of their members with such enormous power have appeared in less than a year!"</p>

  <p>"The rise of the human race is inevitable now. They're gonna take over things slowly. I heard that Miguel has already led his forces towards the two sacred places of the ogres. Most likely, both of those sacred places have already been destroyed."</p>

  <p>Delroy, Max, Woody, Dorothea and the rest were also staring at the new name on the Talent Tablet. Their faces were filled with astonishment and they were silent amidst the discussion.</p>

  <p>After a long while, Delroy finally broke that silence, "What the hell man!</p>

  <p>This world is too strange for me to handle!"</p>

  <p>The silver Asura title...</p>

  <p>In terms of what the Talent Tablet had to say, this young man called Klein had already surpassed these seven people of the Celestial Position race.</p>

  <p>Max was the most powerful among them all and had only gotten a silver title till now; that too of a very low rank.</p>

  <p>In the entire Celestial Position race, very few people had ever managed to obtain a golden title, and those who had ever managed to achieve a silver title could also be counted on the hands. Anyone who was blessed enough to do so was powerful enough to become a core member of the Celestial Position race and would be highly valued. That was the main reason why Max was known as the leader of their team.</p>

  <p>It was already astonishing enough that a genius like Luo Luo Zheng had appeared in the Lower World, but now another human with a silver Asura title was standing in front of them. These seven Celestial Position race warriors were all overwhelmed with astonishment.</p>

  <p>After the young and talented Klein came out, unaware of the astonishment he had bestowed upon seven certain people, several top-level war lords of the human race also descended from the higher floors.</p>

  <p>Today, the human race's position in the Tower of Sin was completely different from what it had been when Luo Luo Zheng had come here last time. The human race and the Demon Night race had jointly become the controllers of the Tower of Sin. No other races were able to fight against them now.</p>

  <p>Klein seemed ecstatic, surrounded by the crowd, and cheered on continuously. He was very confident in himself, and was equally satisfied to be able to surpass the first row and obtain a title. He was humble too. Surpassing Luo Luo Zheng was something that he would never even imagine or dream of.</p>

  <p>In fact, although Luo Luo Zheng had left the Sea God Continent a long time ago, he had already become a legendary figure in the Purple Heart Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>Nobody was arrogant enough to think that he or she could surpass a legendary figure like him.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Max ordered his puppet to walk towards Klein's direction.</p>

  <p>A hint of doubt appeared on Klein's face. He had just walked out of the Talent Tablet and had not noticed these eight strange guests who had strangely appeared on the tenth floor. Although they looked human outwardly, he could only feel their soul waves. There were no breaths or signs of life.</p>

  <p>The top-level war lords of the human race also stared at them warily.</p>

  <p>They had already gone on high alert upon seeing these unknown guests in the Tower of Sin, but since they were all attracted by Klein's test result, they hadn't bothered to deal with them till now.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, someone with hawk's eyes noticed Luo Luo Zheng who was standing a few feet away from Max and everyone else.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng! Hey, it's Luo Luo Zheng! I can't even believe my eyes!"</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng has returned to the Sea God Continent!"</p>

  <p>Just as they were about to cheer on, someone noticed it! "Wait, there's something wrong with him. Although this guy looks like Luo Luo Zheng, he doesn't seem human at all..."</p>

  <p>"That's because it's just a puppet! What motives do you have for pretending to be Luo Luo Zheng?"</p>

  <p>The Sea God Continent only had a few crude puppets. Nobody there was talented enough to create a puppet as vivid as Hank's.</p>

  <p>The one he had made for Luo Luo Zheng looked almost like Luo Luo Zheng himself. However, there was obviously a difference between a real person and a puppet.</p>

  <p>And warriors who were powerful enough could detect that something was wrong with just a slight sweep of their perception.</p>

  <p>Just as everyone was feeling puzzled and cautious, a young girl, wearing a colorful dress, descended from the top of the stairs. Everyone heard her cold voice ring out, "That is exactly the Luo Luo Zheng you know, but... It seems like his cultivation base has reached the level of a war sage, and therefore, he has to send in a puppet to enter the Cursed Land. This puppet technique looks like it has been inherited from the Celestial Position race. Am I right? And these seven people with him... You all are from the Celestial Position race, right?"</p>
