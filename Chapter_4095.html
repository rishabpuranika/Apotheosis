<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>


  <p>
</p>

  <p>So Tearrag, despite his curiosity and excitement, resisted the urge to break through the enchanted barriers and see the wolf tooth for himself. Instead, he fell on his knees and offered a silent wish.</p>

  <p>He said, "Humans, I do not care what method you use. Please do your best to restore the rest of the wolf teeth."</p>

  <p>Little did Tearrag know that as he was doing this, the drop of blood, which entered into the first wolf tooth, moved into the second wolf tooth. The magic that happened with the first one also happened with the second one!</p>

  <p>Its dents were fixed. It gained its color, and it glowed even brighter!</p>

  <p>The drop of blood then rolled into the third wolf tooth, the fourth one, and then the fifth one! It went on and on!</p>

  <p>Tearrag was shocked to feel the waves of auras one after the other. The human heroes inside the cave felt the same way.</p>

  <p>Before this, none of them knew how many drops were needed from the ancestry-level bloodline in order to restore the thirteen wolf teeth. All of them suspected it would take a large amount to fix something so broken.</p>

  <p>But the reality was something they did not even consider.</p>

  <p>Only a single drop of blood was needed to restore all of the wolf teeth.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, it repaired all of them! The thirteen wolf teeth glowed, and their merged aura was more powerful than ever.</p>

  <p>As soon as the drop of blood restored all of the teeth, it climbed up Luo Zheng's arm. It went directly towards his wound and entered it, sending off the same stream of energy it had given the wolf teeth to his arm. A few seconds later, the long wound on Luo Zheng's arm was fading into clear and smooth skin. The drop of blood healed his wound so quickly. It was as if nothing ever happened to it!</p>

  <p>"This bloodline..." the real Chiyou trailed. "It is so amazing! I really have no words for it," he continued, his eyebrows still furrowed in disbelief.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven approached Luo Zheng, putting a hand over his shoulder. "Everyone," he said, calling all of their attention. "Because of Luo Zheng, we were able to accomplish the impossible. Let us hope that this luck goes on until the end of our journey."</p>

  <p>By no means was doing what they had just done an easy task, and by no means what they were yet to do was easy as well. However, with this success, they began to feel hopeful.</p>

  <p>What they were previously worried about was how to deceive the Monkey Spirit King. Although most of the Monkey Masters did not give much thought to what method they had used to wake the Monkey Spirit King up, there was still the possibility that some of them and even Monkey Spirit King himself would figure out the truth.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King was very knowledgeable. Once he awakened, in an instant, he would know that it was the ancestry-level bloodline that had restored the thirteen wolf teeth.</p>

  <p>But having reached so far already, the group knew that fear could not be a choice.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven raised his arms up, and as he did, the enchanted barriers guarding the cave had been brought down, giving access to those who wished to enter. Tearrag, who had been waiting so long for this opportunity, immediately ran inside.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing the restored thirteen wolf teeth, he cried out in happiness.</p>

  <p>"Yes!" he exclaimed, his voice being loud enough for it to reverberate throughout the cave. In this state of celebration, he quickly acted, sending the information of the restored wolf teeth back to Ghost Mountain.</p>

  <p>After Manuel was killed, he revived inside the Ghost Mountain, wherein he led the Monkey Masters and the Great Ghost Priests to repair the place.</p>

  <p>Even though Manuel was busy, upon hearing the news, he immediately dropped whatever he was doing and rushed to the cave to see if the news was true.</p>

  <p>Following him were all the Monkey Masters, who were also eager to see if the thirteen wolf teeth had truly been restored.</p>

  <p>Although Manuel wanted so badly for the news to be true, he could not shake off the doubt in the back of his head.</p>

  <p>He used to be the star of the Eternal Divine Courtyard, so he knew that the ancestry-level bloodline was the only object to be able to restore the thirteen wolf teeth to their original forms, and the ancestry-level bloodline was something a person could not get a hold of so easily.</p>

  <p>Could it be that these humans were able to reach the ancestry-level bloodline?</p>

  <p>The thought of it was more absurd than being able to restore the wolf teeth. But it was there. It was real.</p>

  <p>Manuel shook off his confusion and focused on what was in front of him.</p>

  <p>He called on a Monkey Master.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Master brought out a long hemp rope from the Ghost Mountain.</p>

  <p>He pierced the hemp rope into the wolf teeth, forming a necklace. The Monkey Master carried it in his hand, making sure not to scratch or drop such delicate and important objects. Manuel said, "Bring the Thirteen Teeth Necklace to the Monkey Spirit King. Make sure no harm comes to the necklace on the way." The Monkey Master nodded and went on his way.</p>

  <p>All of the Monkey Masters went to the sleeping Monkey Spirit King, making sure the Thirteen Teeth Necklace was safe and used by the one who needed it the most.</p>

  <p>When they arrived, none of them dared to be too close to the Monkey Spirit King. They all knew he had just undergone a traumatic crisis. He was only experiencing the world in his dreams, but his dreams convoluted his reality, making his actions unpredictable. They did not know how he would react to them, so they took caution.</p>

  <p>They knew the Monkey Spirit King might attack if he sensed there was something wrong.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>With a quick yet careful flick of a wrist, the Monkey Master carrying the Thirteen Teeth Necklace was able to drop it onto the Monkey Spirit King's neck.</p>

  <p>Being asleep and deep in a restless dream, the Monkey Spirit King was not able to see what had been placed upon him, but he was able to feel it.</p>

  <p>He felt the additional weight that had been placed upon his neck, and it took up its own form in his dream.</p>

  <p>In the darkness of his sleep, he saw something glowing from the corner of his vision. It was the Thirteen Teeth Necklace, and it had just arrived in his world of dream.</p>
