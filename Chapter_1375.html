  <p>
</p>

  <p>As everyone else receded their pace, Luo Luo Zheng maintained a steady speed as he eventually caught up with the other warriors.</p>

  <p>Without further delay, he surpassed a warrior. Soon, he passed by the second, the third, the fourth...</p>

  <p>The warriors at the tail were likely to be defeated because their strength and speed seemed highly inadequate and they wouldn't be able to catch up in time. Some of them, facing the threat of a fierce Law Storm, even considered of giving up altogether.</p>

  <p>After all, every warrior had a distinct goal, one that might be significantly different from another. Some warriors were aware that their own strength was limited, so they would be satisfied with just a Tribulation Exterminating Pill.</p>

  <p>However, there were also some warriors who persevered despite all odds, even though their strength was barely enough. They realized that they wouldn't be able to cover 3, 000 miles, but they chose to challenge themselves to the last minute rather than surrender once and for all. The attitude of a warrior was of prime importance in his life.</p>

  <p>An unusual space unexpectedly appeared inside the Law Storm. A warrior had accidentally entered and was in fact bound by that space. He surely wished to escape, but perhaps it was too late. At that precise moment, a sharp black wind blade suddenly appeared in front of him, swiftly chopping off his arm.</p>

  <p>Another warrior inadvertently triggered the fluctuation of some law and was surrounded by many red flames. Simultaneously, sharp golden lights enveloped him and several holes appeared in his body.</p>

  <p>After 1, 000 miles, situations like these were not novel. More and more warriors got injured and they could only give up midway.</p>

  <p>The speed of the warriors in the third and second tiers receded drastically. Every warrior appeared to be very cautious on his way forward.</p>

  <p>However, the speed of the warriors in the first tier still couldn't be underestimated.</p>

  <p>They were considered to be the elites of the thirteen palaces. They were also the selected elites from among the elites of the three thousand supreme worlds.</p>

  <p>Moreover, most of them were warriors who had activated the Nine-petal Lotus Flower.</p>

  <p>Whether it was their hard work and determination or their gifted talent and ultimate perseverance, they simply couldn't be matched by ordinary warriors.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the warriors in the first tier had gotten miles away from those of the second tier.</p>

  <p>When the warriors in the second tier barely touched 1, 700 miles, Layla, who was the confident leader in the first tier, had victoriously covered 2, 000 miles.</p>

  <p>The warriors in third tier had just reached 1, 500 miles. They indeed had a sad existence.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng found himself at the middle of the third tier.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Ice spears suddenly appeared within the Law Storm, enveloping an area not too far away from where Luo Luo Zheng was standing.</p>

  <p>There was a warrior just ahead of Luo Luo Zheng. His face seemed to showcase a faint trace of fear. Just as he was about to flee, he discovered that his speed had turned out to become excruciatingly slow. He was entirely enveloped by the cage created by the Time Law. Although his speed hadn't exactly fallen, the after effect was that his speed had receded to 1% of his original speed due to the Time Law. It was impossible for him to dodge the ice spears that frequently kept attacking him from all directions.</p>

  <p>If one of the ice spears would be able to strike him, the result would be devastating. Even if he did manage to evade death, he would be seriously injured.</p>

  <p>When he noticed this scene unfolding before him, Luo Zheng's figure suddenly flashed and moved hundreds of feet forward, arriving right beside that warrior.</p>

  <p>'The Time Law...'</p>

  <p>With that thought, Luo Luo Zheng also circulated the Time Law.</p>

  <p>The Time Law and Space Law were rather special as warriors could use the same law to cancel out any of these two laws.</p>

  <p>After breaking the cage created by the Time Law, Luo Luo Zheng quickly pulled the warrior away and the sharp ice spears landed on the ground where the warrior had been standing.</p>

  <p>The warrior had been scared out of his wits by whatever had just occurred. When he was saved by Luo Luo Zheng, a look of gratitude naturally appeared on his face. "Thank you for saving my life!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded his head, but did not care to pause at all. He maintained his speed as he continued to strive his way ahead.</p>

  <p>The number of helpless warriors eliminated by the Law Storm continued to increase exorbitantly.</p>

  <p>Especially the warriors in the third tier were more vulnerable such as the one who Luo Luo Zheng just rescued. If it wasn't for Luo Luo Zheng, he would have had to give up and surrender immediately.</p>

  <p>The third tier comprised of around 3, 000 warriors. After they had covered 1, 000 miles, more than 1, 000 warriors had already faced inevitable situations and gotten themselves eliminated.</p>

  <p>As for the second tier, it was composed of over 1, 000 brave warriors, and now they had to let go about 300 of them.</p>

  <p>Whereas not a single warrior from the first tier had been eliminated so far.</p>

  <p>"Their performance during this year's competition has been exemplary.</p>

  <p>The elimination rate is comparatively low. Moreover, there were only seven or eight warriors in the first tier before. This time, there are more than twenty people contesting, significantly increasing the caliber pool of the competition. That is more than three times the last year's number!"</p>

  <p>The old man in cotton clothes let out a satisfied smile.</p>

  <p>"Now that the world of chaos has started, these young talents are naturally expected to appear. It's perfectly normal that there are more than twenty warriors in the first tier. Besides the thirteen palaces, other forces of the alliance, the human race and other races have also welcomed many talented warriors," another palace leader replied.</p>

  <p>The old man nodded. "If that's the case, then they might topple the previous record in Passing the Torch."</p>

  <p>Within the Enchanted Barrier Tower, the best record of the previous generations was 18, 000 miles.</p>

  <p>A palace master shook his head and smiled, "I don't think anyone can break Supreme Lord Illusion's 18, 000-mile record. But there definitely is a hope of breaking the second record this time!"</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Illusion was the warrior who had used four hours to adapt to the vitality between heaven and earth in the Upper World.</p>

  <p>In the past, he had also participated in Passing the Torch. When he had entered the Enchanted Barrier Tower, he had created a shocking record of the magnitude that hadn't been witnessed before or after? 18, 000 miles.</p>

  <p>At that time, even Supreme Lord Illusion was at the ninth grade of the Life and Death Realm.</p>

  <p>Why did this record leave the other warriors dumbfounded?</p>

  <p>Because before that, the best result was only a mere 12, 000 miles.</p>

  <p>And with the appearance of Supreme Lord Illusion, he raised the bar to a whopping 18, 000 miles. An increase of 6, 000 miles was simply too terrifying and overwhelming. After that incident, no one else had gotten close to breaking the legendary record.</p>

  <p>During the later years, there were a few talented warriors who shattered 12, 000-mile record and achieved a distance of 14, 000 miles. This result was the second rank in the Enchanted Barrier Tower.</p>

  <p>"Right, I think so too. Perhaps Layla can cover 14, 000 miles," another palace leader stated bluntly.</p>

  <p>Yolande didn't pay much attention to the discussion that the other palace leaders were indulged in.</p>

  <p>Her gaze was still solely focused on Luo Luo Zheng. Although he remained in the third tier, he was slowly moving ahead to occupy the front row of third tier. It seemed as if he would enter the second tier soon enough.</p>

  <p>Many palace leaders were only concerned about the warriors in the first tier. Naturally, they didn't notice that the guy who had ranked last maintained a steady pace as he moved forward, surpassing many others.</p>

  <p>After a while, the first tier of warriors had finally broken through the 3, 000-mile mark. The old man dressed in cotton clothes reported the names of the top 10 once again.</p>

  <p>Layla managed to retain her first position and was the center of attention.</p>

  <p>Besides, her background was rather special as well. Although she was participating in Passing the Torch representing the Mist Palace, the palace leaders didn't treat her as a warrior of the Mist Palace.</p>

  <p>Therefore, many of the palace leaders were rather generous in their praise for Layla.</p>

  <p>"This girl must be the center of attention in the world of chaos!"</p>

  <p>"That's what I think too. Kyron Xiao has the insight to recognize sheer talent at a single glimpse."</p>

  <p>They talked about Layla extensively as the warriors kept struggling to move forward.</p>

  <p>Layla appeared to be unusually calm; she neither seemed tensed nor excited. After passing 3, 000 miles, she used her time for a quick rest.</p>

  <p>Speed was no longer the key factor from the 3, 000th mile to the 10, 000th mile, so she was in no hurry. She bit her lips and shot a quick glance behind her. 'Why is Luo Luo Zheng still not here?' she wondered.</p>

  <p>The second one was not the warrior whose surname was Li from the Shadow Palace, but Javier.</p>

  <p>Javier was one of Yolande's admirers. He was panting. Relying on his greater willpower, he surpassed the warrior with the surname Li and became the second one to cover 3, 000 miles right behind Leyla.</p>

  <p>He looked at the boundless Law Storm and cried out in his mind,</p>

  <p>'Yolande, can't you see? I will definitely grow up to be good enough for you!'</p>

  <p>The third place...</p>

  <p>The fourth place...</p>

  <p>All of the warriors in the first tier slowed down after reaching the 3, 000-mile mark.</p>

  <p>There was still a long way to go. The 10, 000th mile was a huge hurdle, and not many had successfully covered it.</p>

  <p>After a surprising turn of events, Luo Luo Zheng finally left the third tier and entered the second tier. When he entered the second tier, the second tier had passed 3, 000 miles. The second tier originally was composed of over 1, 000 people. Now, there were only about 300 people as 70% of them had been eliminated. The competition had gotten fierce and the prize seemed near, yet so far.</p>
