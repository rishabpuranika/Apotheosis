  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked at the densely packed Troubled Creatures with disbelief.</p>

  <p>These Troubled Creatures that were previously weak like ants had suddenly turned as terrifying as beasts.</p>

  <p>"You could change all the Troubled Creatures?" Luo Zheng asked, staring at the downgrader with wide eyes.</p>

  <p>"Of course," the downgrader replied. It seemed that he had long anticipated this question, and he said indifferently, "I just gave them the Hyperspace Extreme Form, making them more free."</p>

  <p>Taking a deep breath, Luo Zheng closed his eyes and quickly got a number.</p>

  <p>Seventy-six billion six hundred and nineteen million three hundred and thirty-four thousand four hundred and eighty-one.</p>

  <p>This was the number of Troubled Creatures.</p>

  <p>"You could give this many Troubled Creatures the Extreme Form energy?" Luo Zheng asked again as he still couldn't believe it.</p>

  <p>"Of course," the downgrader replied calmly.</p>

  <p>"No way! No one can do that!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng argued, refusing to accept his answer.</p>

  <p>With a wave of his hand, three thousand avatars appeared and surrounded him.</p>

  <p>As soon as these avatars popped up, they immediately used the Grand Teleportation to rush towards the Troubled Creatures.</p>

  <p>The result was the same as what happened before.</p>

  <p>After the avatars appeared around the Troubled Creatures, they were like innocent sheep being mercilessly thrown into a vicious tiger's mouth.</p>

  <p>They were instantly slaughtered and torn apart.</p>

  <p>In just half a minute, all three thousand avatars died.</p>

  <p>The direction in which these avatars used the Grand Teleportation was completely random, which meant that the downgrader didn't lie about his claim. He had truly bestowed the Hyperspace Extreme Form on tens of billions of Troubled Creatures.</p>

  <p>"How did you do it? It's impossible!" Luo Zheng's voice sounded of a hint of bitterness. The downgrader had indeed done something he couldn't imagine.</p>

  <p>The consumption of the energy was tremendous, and the primitive land wasn't capable of continuously supplying it.</p>

  <p>For example, the Evil God possessed all the Extreme Form energies, but he usually didn't dare to activate such energies because the Source World couldn't provide enough energy for him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had the ancestry-level bloodline, so he had more energy than the Evil God.</p>

  <p>The ancestry-level bloodline had limitless energy that could supply about ten people with Extreme Form energy at the same time.</p>

  <p>This was already remarkable and impressive.</p>

  <p>Yet, the downgrader could supply tens of billions of Troubled Creatures with Extreme Form energy all at the same time.</p>

  <p>He was countless times more powerful than the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>In comparison, the energy of the ancestry-level bloodline came out as a ridiculous joke.</p>

  <p>The downgrader observed Luo Zheng's expression, and there was a bit of mockery in his intense glare. "You think it's impossible because the energy of the ancestry-level bloodline has been enough to make you proud and even laugh so arrogantly until this turning point.</p>

  <p>Do you think the ancestry-level bloodline can provide energy as infinite as a river? Ironically, a river's length is infinite but its width is limited. I'm afraid that's not the real infinity.</p>

  <p>This is what real infinity looks like..." the downgrader said, raising the irregular heavy sword in his hand.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Purple energy started to flash from each of the cracks of the irregular heavy sword.</p>

  <p>This was the Destruction Extreme Form.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the eyes of all the Troubled Creatures turned into purple.</p>

  <p>They were all infused with the energy of the Destruction Extreme Form.</p>

  <p>If the Extreme Form energy burst out all at the same time, it would be enough to destroy the huge Burial Land hundreds of times!</p>

  <p>"Real infinity refers to infinite length, infinite width, and infinite size.</p>

  <p>There isn't a single limit to this word." The voice of the downgrader resonated with some kind of magic power.</p>

  <p>Every word he uttered was a heavy punch to Luo Zheng's heart, making him tremble.</p>

  <p>"Why can't I do this?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Why?" The downgrader chuckled as he seemed to have heard a joke.</p>

  <p>"I've already said that you're just a tool, not a person who uses the tool. I guess you don't understand the meaning of infinity at all. This is the limit of your life, Luo Zheng."</p>

  <p>"As you said, I am a tool. But the ancestry-level bloodline has its consciousness. Why can't it do this, either?" Luo Zheng asked again as he was losing his patience.</p>

  <p>The downgrader, who was so sure of winning, dealt with him very patiently. He continued to explain, "It had inadvertently obtained its consciousness. It's also just a tool."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng fell silent for a while.</p>

  <p>The ancestry-level bloodline didn't refute even as it heard these words.</p>

  <p>"I... I don't believe it!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng growled as flames suddenly appeared in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Circles of light then began to appear above his head.</p>

  <p>Seven kinds of Extreme Form energy exploded in alternating turns, strengthening his body like crazy.</p>

  <p>In order to fight this battle, Luo Zheng had tried to strengthen himself with Extreme Form energies and trained both day and night. These seven kinds of Extreme Form energy were indeed the most effective.</p>

  <p>His body expanded rapidly, turning him into a height of ten feet. Precious crystals appeared on the surface of his body that made him look like an enormous glass man. A pair of blue wings unfolded from his wide back, and finally, a purple sword appeared in his hand which he gripped tightly.</p>

  <p>The downgrader saw the changes in Luo Zheng, but he remained composed. He then raised the irregular heavy sword horizontally.</p>

  <p>"The Probability Extreme Form!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng let out a roar that shook the whole area.</p>

  <p>A large cloud formed above him and the downgrader and started to envelop them.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng summoned one thousand avatars, and so did the downgrader.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>The long purple sword, which was transformed from the Destruction Extreme Form, and the irregular heavy sword collided with each other repeatedly, bursting out the power of destruction each time. In the blink of an eye, they had already clashed for more than ten thousand times. The entire cloud was filled with powerful energy. Any ordinary Eternal Realm warriors would have disappeared in such an environment in an instant.</p>

  <p>"You don't have to be shamed into anger," the downgrader said as he easily withstood all of Luo Zheng's attacks. "Clarence and I have used more than ten million tools. In fact, you are the best among the rest."</p>

  <p>"You are the tool! Go to hell!" Luo Zheng's sword attack became even more powerful as he was consumed by his rage.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The energy of the Destruction Extreme Form exploded, igniting a huge purple flame that surrounded the downgrader.</p>

  <p>After the purple flame dissipated, the downgrader came out unscathed.</p>

  <p>"I'm praising you..."</p>

  <p>But before he could finish his words, Luo Zheng struck him again.</p>

  <p>The purple flame engulfed the downgrader once more.</p>

  <p>Because of the cloud, the people on the jadeite platform couldn't see the battle between Luo Zheng and the downgrader, but they saw the Troubled Creatures rapidly approaching.</p>

  <p>"The speed of these Troubled Creatures is unimaginably fast. It's very strange," Kincaid said as he was the first to notice that something was wrong.</p>

  <p>"Well, they seem to be much stronger than before," Hilario said as he observed.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, what's happening?" the Snake Goddess asked as she stared at Luo Zheng's avatar on the jadeite platform.</p>

  <p>Of course, Luo Zheng's avatar knew the reason. He hesitated whether he should tell everyone the cruel truth or not. After thinking for a while, he said,</p>

  <p>"All the Troubled Creatures are given the energy of the Hyperspace Extreme Form by the downgrader."</p>

  <p>"All the Troubled Creatures?" Hilario's eyes widened.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean that every Troubled Creature has the energy of Hyperspace Extreme Form? Are you serious?" Hilario stared at Luo Zheng in shock, clearly in suspicion.</p>

  <p>"There are a total of about seventy billion Troubled Creatures, and each of them is bestowed with the Hyperspace Extreme Form. At the same time, their bodies are also infused with the energy of the Destruction Extreme Form," Luo Zheng's avatar narrated in a dry tone.</p>

  <p>"How is that possible? You must be lying..." Fuxi said as his voice trembled. He was confused at everything that Luo Zheng's avatar said.</p>
