<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2814 The Broken Boat </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>These sixteen disciples from the Oneness Sky Palace were known to be strong. They were the ones who stood out in the sky road.</p>

  <p>It was the first time that their Souls of Light had left their bodies to wander in the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>They had cultivated their souls into Souls of Light and had already built their Truth Boats, but it was not easy to sail on the Sea of Truth. Just the wind from the Sea of Truth alone would make many people's souls tremble.</p>

  <p>Ten of the sixteen warriors' souls lay down on the boats without even raising their heads. The pressure was heavy and they could not stand the wind blowing from the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>While the remaining six warriors appeared fearless and boldly stood at the bow of their boats. They were at the top among their group.</p>

  <p>If they developed in the future, they would become the pride of the Oneness Sky Palace in the future.</p>

  <p>"Stanley! Can you see clearly where this person comes from? He is floating still on the sea. Is he dead?" A girl's beautiful voice rang out from a boat.</p>

  <p>Stanley Ming stared at the figure in the sea and frowned, his hands behind his back.</p>

  <p>Hearing the question from the woman, he immediately shook his head. "It's impossible. The Sea of Truth can destroy any soul. Even if one's soul has reached the Soul of Light, their soul would be gone once it falls into the sea.</p>

  <p>If they are dead, then how can there be any corpses?"</p>

  <p>Everyone entered the Sea of Truth in the form of soul. How could there be a corpse? Wasn't it absurd?</p>

  <p>He wanted to see the features of the person in the sea, but he couldn't even clearly see his companions in the Sea of Truth. He could only recognize the girl through her voice. So it was a wishful thinking for him to make out the figure's appearance.</p>

  <p>Zheng floated in the Sea of Truth and did not say anything, but the people's conversations clearly reached his ears.</p>

  <p>Looking at their perfect Truth Boats, Zheng was a little envious. If he could fully grasp the Truth of Cultivation Nature, he assumed that he would also be able to create such a boat...</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha, Sophia. If you want to know whether this guy is alive or not, why not just test it out?" a robust figure suggested as he laughed.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Sophia kept silent and did not respond. The robust man had an extraordinary background and enjoyed privileges in the Oneness Sky Palace. He had already been pestering her a lot these days.</p>

  <p>Stanley Ming had a cautious look on his face. He said to the robust man,</p>

  <p>"Terence! Don't do anything stupid. Don't forget why we are here in the first place!"</p>

  <p>Even in the Source World, crossing the Sea of Truth was not an easy task.</p>

  <p>At this moment, they had just set out and taken the initial step. The closer they were to the Other Shore, the greater the challenges they would encounter.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Terence Xi was going to mess around, Stanley Ming immediately gave out a warning in order to stop him from making any trouble.</p>

  <p>However, Terence Xi wasn't taking his warning seriously. It was true that he was a warrior valued by the Oneness Sky Palace but Terence Xi was not any weaker than him when it came to talent. In addition, Terence Xi had a prominent family background which was far superior to his.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry. There won't be any problem to test him!"</p>

  <p>As he spoke, a triangular secret seal was formed above his robust figure!</p>

  <p>Since he was now in the form of his soul, he could only use the soul attack.</p>

  <p>The triangular secret seal hovered over the boat for a while and shot towards Zheng who was in the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>Seeing the daring move, Stanley Ming couldn't help but shake his head.</p>

  <p>This Terence Xi had always been so reckless. Their master had told them to be careful when they crossed the Sea of Truth and if they were careless, their souls might shatter.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, their master gave each of the sixteen warriors an Illusion Breaking Rune. If the time came where they sensed that they were in danger, they could crush the Illusion Breaking Rune and retreat from the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't mind the group of people on the boats and just floated on the sea quite at ease. He did not expect that someone would make trouble for him!</p>

  <p>"Soul attack? Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>Zheng sensed the incoming attack and sneered. He raised his eyebrows slightly.</p>

  <p>He had already detected that the group's cultivation base was only at the consummation of True God Realm at best, but their soul power would be considered outstanding if they were in the divine land. Their soul power was even on par with that of some Demi-holy Beings.</p>

  <p>With his current soul level, the situation felt like a child's play. He wouldn't lose even he was to contend against Holy Beings' souls. How could the soul attack from the consummate True God possibly pose any threat to him?</p>

  <p>He opened his eyes and a light gleamed in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...</p>

  <p>Soul arrows shot out one after another.</p>

  <p>Duh duh duh...</p>

  <p>The secret soul technique that Terence Xi cultivated was also one of the best. The triangular secret seal actually withstood Zheng's soul attack!</p>

  <p>It did hold out against the attack for a moment but the soul arrows released by Zheng didn't stop like a river and constantly flew...</p>

  <p>The triangular secret seal was able to withstand the attacks of dozens of soul arrows. But when hundreds of soul arrows shot at it constantly, it had suddenly split into pieces and scattered in the Sea of Truth, disappearing without a trace!</p>

  <p>Looking at the scene, Stanley Ming and Sophia were shocked.</p>

  <p>Not only was this guy in the Sea of Truth alive, but his soul attack was also so powerful?</p>

  <p>Terence Xi looked at Zheng's figure with a look of disbelief.</p>

  <p>In terms of pure strength, he was not the strongest in the Oneness Sky Palace and slightly weaker than Stanley Ming. However, the soul technique he cultivated was not an ordinary method. Among the consummate True Gods, he had never encountered an opponent in this aspect!</p>

  <p>He would always have the upper hand in a soul-level battle against his peers!</p>

  <p>It was beyond his expectation that this time as he attacked, his secret seal was destroyed just like that?</p>

  <p>Just as he was lost in his thought, he heard the loud shout from Sophia and Stanley Ming.</p>

  <p>"That guy is approaching you!"</p>

  <p>"Run! Terence!"</p>

  <p>Only then did he saw that the figure made a move and swam in the sea. He was moving very fast and coming directly towards his Truth Boat!</p>

  <p>He instantly paled as he looked over. He attempted to suppress the fear in his heart and sat cross legged, activating the Truth of Godly Way to drive his Truth Boat to go faster.</p>

  <p>Zheng was not lenient and was definitely irritated by the rash attack!</p>

  <p>As he swam in the magma sea, he felt strong pain. Despite that, he just gritted his teeth and moved very fast, faster than the Truth Boats!</p>

  <p>Although Terence Xi had made great effort to make his boat move faster, the driving power of the Truth Boat depended solely on his will. No matter how hard he tried, it was still not fast enough.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, Zheng had caught up with him!</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>Zheng threw a punch towards his Truth Boat without a word of warning.</p>

  <p>The Truth Boat was an illusion formed by relying on Truth of Godly Way. It was as fragile as glass in front of Zheng's physical body. His punch had easily created a hole in the Truth Boat.</p>

  <p>As a result, the small Truth Boat quickly tilted and fell towards the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>Terence Xi on the boat was scared out of wits as he didn't know what to do.</p>

  <p>If the boat fell into the Sea of Truth, his Soul of Light would dissolve into nothingness. He would be done for!</p>

  <p>He was still in panic until he heard Stanley Ming shout, "Hurry up! Crush the Illusion Breaking Rune!"</p>

  <p>Hearing Stanley's words, he was immediately reminded about their way of escape in times of danger. He hurriedly brought out the Illusion Breaking Rune he had and crushed it with all his might. Before completely falling into the Sea of Truth, he disappeared in front of Zheng along with his boat.</p>
