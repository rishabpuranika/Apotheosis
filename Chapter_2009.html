<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng was shackled by the Death Chain and his power was sealed. Now he had no way to flee.</p>

  <p>Looking at the lightning that was condensing above his head, he slowly calmed down. His eyes revealed a faint smile.</p>

  <p>Noticing Zheng's expression, Yao asked, "Why are you smiling?"</p>

  <p>Zheng blinked, his smile becoming wider. "You're sending me to my death, why can't I smile before I die?"</p>

  <p>Yao sneered at this. She then extended her hand and made a few mysterious moves in the sky. A deep blue rune shattered in her hand and turned into a stream of light that shot into the vortex. She then looked down at Zheng in the crater and spoke, "I hope that you can still continue smiling in the netherworld."</p>

  <p>"Sizzle..."</p>

  <p>The lightning vortex that had been condensing for a long time formed huge lightning snakes.</p>

  <p>There were exaggerated patterns on the surface of these lightning snakes.</p>

  <p>The lightning snakes had a life of their own as they constantly intertwined with each other and wriggled!</p>

  <p>As the lightning snakes wriggled, they eyed Zheng hungrily. They were viewing him as a tasty morsel but the lightning snakes were trapped in the vortex, unable to get out…</p>

  <p>But when Yao released the blue stream of light, the lightning vortex began to slowly disintegrate. The lightning snakes finally attained their freedom!</p>

  <p>"Hissss..."</p>

  <p>Having gained their freedom, they swooped down simultaneously.</p>

  <p>Countless bolts of lightning struck at the air, causing an ear-piercing sound!</p>

  <p>Yao watched this scene coldly, and calmly observed Zheng. This fellow should feel honored to die by the Profound Holy Thunder.</p>

  <p>However Zheng looked at Yao and flashed a dazzling smile. At the same time, his lips moved slightly…</p>

  <p>His voice was very low, and even without the noises from the lighting arcs, she still might not have been able to hear him clearly. However, Yao knew lip-reading, and the moment he opened his mouth, she could easily read what he was saying.</p>

  <p>"Do you really think you can kill me?"</p>

  <p>When Yao understood what he was saying, her eyebrows creased and a puzzled expression appeared on her face…</p>

  <p>'Was this fellow a fool?'</p>

  <p>Yao was well aware of the power of this Profound Holy Thunder.</p>

  <p>There was simply no one in the entire universe who could resist it head-on.</p>

  <p>Even the four top-rank Supreme Lords of the Evolutionary Universe would not dare to forcefully take this Profound Holy Thunder, let alone Zheng. Anyone who dared to use their physical body to block the Profound Holy Thunder would have their flesh completely ripped to shreds.</p>

  <p>Strong as the power of this Profound Holy Thunder was, there was a fatal problem with it; it was too time-consuming to be employed in a jiffy.</p>

  <p>In a fight between Supreme Lords, deadly moves were executed in the blink of an eye!</p>

  <p>A few seconds was a very extremely short time frame for an ordinary person, but for Supreme Lords, it was more than enough to escape thousands of miles away.</p>

  <p>It took about five long minutes for the Profound Holy Thunder to be prepared.</p>

  <p>It was impractical to use such a skill in actual combat as it would hardly be of any use.</p>

  <p>Zheng could not use his strength and he was bound in place by the Death Chain. He was like a condemned prisoner awaiting execution, completely at the mercy of Yao.</p>

  <p>This gave her plenty of time to prepare and use the Profound Holy Thunder.</p>

  <p>She didn't expect Zheng to react this way at the last moment, which vexed her.</p>

  <p>However, when the thick lightning snakes rushed towards Zheng, who was in the huge crater, she was finally relieved. This guy would be dead for sure.</p>

  <p>She just assumed that Zheng was reacting that way to throw her off. So she chose not to dwell on it for too long and dismissed it from her mind.</p>

  <p>After she killed this brat, Leroy wouldn't be able to stir up any trouble.</p>

  <p>The crisis within the Demon Night would be completely resolved, and she would lead the Demon Night to a new path! Her grand plans were laid out and she could almost taste the victory.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>The moment the lightning snakes fell on Zheng's body, a dazzling light burst forth, illuminating the area around the Inauguration Altar so bright…</p>

  <p>So intense was the light that if any living being within a thousand miles were to open their eyes and look up they would be instantly blinded.</p>

  <p>The population within ten thousand miles could feel that the world had suddenly lost its unique color. Everything had turned snow-white, and nobody could discern anything clearly.</p>

  <p>Creatures living within a hundred thousand miles, or even a million miles around saw half the sky erupt a violent mass of light and an enormous explosion happened on the horizon…</p>

  <p>Hundreds of millions of miles away from the Rosy Cloud World, some living beings on the stars in the deep sky, too, revealed a surprised expression as they looked down. They saw the supreme world underneath them suddenly emitting a dazzling light that even overshadowed the stars in the deep sky!</p>

  <p>By the time the lightning snakes swooped down, Supreme Lord Shadow, who wasn't too far away from Zheng, had turned completely pale. Although Ying had used the Link of Life to protect him, receiving baptism by these lightning snakes was probably the most unforgettable experience he had in his long life.</p>

  <p>Zheng sat cross-legged with his eyes tightly shut as he bathed in the glow of lightning.</p>

  <p>His physical body was indeed tough, but the power of Yao's Profound Holy Thunder was extraordinary. He wouldn't succeed in blocking it using just his physical body.</p>

  <p>Luckily for Zheng, he was currently in the Rosy Cloud World, an area that was covered by the will of the worlds.</p>

  <p>"Power Transfer..."</p>

  <p>As the will of the worlds continued to spread, it would occupy a new supreme world every once in a while.</p>

  <p>At this stage, the will of the worlds had spread across many territories of the ogre race, Demon Night and many other small races. However, human territories were rarely covered, but dozens of supreme worlds of the Humanity Alliance came under the will of the worlds!</p>

  <p>These supreme worlds had all been occupied by the Sacred race.</p>

  <p>Zheng's goal was to save the Evolutionary Universe. If he randomly used the power transfer skill, it would harm the Evolutionary Universe itself.</p>

  <p>When Zheng was in the Lower World, he had destroyed all the mountains in a great world during a battle.</p>

  <p>So he was naturally hesitant to use it unless he had no other choices.</p>

  <p>Zheng had chosen a supreme world of the Humanity Alliance, which was occupied by Sacred race.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The moment he used his power transfer skill, the lightning snakes subsided and went limp.</p>

  <p>His entire body was enveloped by the seemingly substantial lightning bolts, which were trying to penetrate his body and ravage his flesh.</p>

  <p>But no matter how hard they tried, Zheng just sat there motionlessly. He absorbed all the lightening that came at him as though his entire body was a bottomless pit.</p>

  <p>The lightning bolts had already been transferred by Zheng to another supreme world…</p>

  <p>Zheng, who was being baptized by the lightning, gained some new insights.</p>

  <p>He could transfer the power that was being exerted on him to other places because he was fused with the will of the worlds. This meant that the willow leaves, which were stuck to him, probably had the same ability. So Zheng assumed that they, too, could transfer the power they received to other places as well.</p>

  <p>While Zheng was motionless and completely unharmed, the situation in another supreme world was completely different…</p>

  <p>In the Celestial Wolf World, three thousand supreme worlds away from the Rosy Cloud World, an unprecedented disaster was unfolding.</p>

  <p>When the Sacred martial artists invaded this universe, they had to face all sorts of natural disasters every now and then. They had to be extremely cautious at all times in order to combat the malicious phenomenon of the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>After occupying a supreme world, they would try their best to reduce the number in their group and then use the materials in that supreme world to create various arrays and enchanted barriers.</p>

  <p>This way, it wouldn't be too much of a problem to deal with ordinary events like heavenly thunder or ground fire.</p>

  <p>But today, streaks of lightning, which were as thick as buckets, were suddenly attacking in the Celestial Wolf World.</p>

  <p>"What is that lightning!?" a Sacred warrior cried out as he looked at the sky. The light that erupted in the sky alarmed the warriors who were guarding this area.</p>

  <p>Three grand world lords simultaneously looked up into the sky. When they saw the lightning snakes, their mouth fell open in shock.</p>

  <p>"This is not heavenly thunder! This is an attack by some Supreme Lord!"</p>

  <p>"Quickly, go and inform the Supreme Lords of our Sacred race!"</p>

  <p>"That's impossible! The Supreme Lords of our Sacred race have already gone to the Sunflower Water World. It's impossible that the humans would dare to send their forces to attack this place right now!"</p>

  <p>There was utter chaos among the martial artists of the Celestial Wolf World!</p>

  <p>At the same time, the lightning snakes were swarming overhead.</p>

  <p>The lightning bolts wreaked havoc on the land. The rolling thunder plowed through the entire sacred place. This ten grade sacred place occupied by the Sacred race was a vast land, but it only took seconds for these lightning snakes to destroy it. In the end, all that was left behind were signs of destruction and charred ruins and the corpses of countless Sacred martial artists.</p>
