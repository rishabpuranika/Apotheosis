<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2669 Chiyou's Efforts </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Mirror Shield was not made nor created by Chiyou, but was rather obtained by him from the ancient relic.</p>

  <p>Chiyou rarely used the shield ever since he became the Lord of Weapons.</p>

  <p>It was the reason why he handed it over to Kaden.</p>

  <p>Ramzi had seen Kaden use the Heavenly Mirror Shield before. The moment he recognized the triangular shadow of the shield, it had confirmed his thought.</p>

  <p>"The Heavenly Mirror Shield can cover even the heaven and earth with the formless power. It is not easy to break it," Leopold uttered.</p>

  <p>What Leopold said made Timotheus raise his eyebrows slightly. He spoke, "Let me have a try. Everyone, step back!"</p>

  <p>Ramzi put his hand on Zheng's shoulder, and all the Other Shore Realm warriors quickly retreated.</p>

  <p>After Timotheus was given space, he opened his palms and a golden broadsword appeared.</p>

  <p>"Grow!"</p>

  <p>As soon as he gave out the order, his figure began to grow and swell. It didn't take much time before he turned into a giant of millions of feet tall in an instant.</p>

  <p>He carried the broadsword on his shoulder, his white hair and long beard were fluttering. As his aura spread out, it gave off such a huge pressure!</p>

  <p>Ramzi waved his hand and helped Zheng block that aura. Otherwise, Zheng would have been inflicted and injured under this aura.</p>

  <p>Timotheus let out a shout, holding the golden broadsword.</p>

  <p>The broadsword was slashed out, then followed by thin line appearing.</p>

  <p>The seemingly unremarkable strike contained an extremely mysterious Truth of Godly Way. That thin line contained certain energy of the chaos.</p>

  <p>"So powerful..."</p>

  <p>Zheng took a secret glance at Emily beside him.</p>

  <p>After Zheng fell into the world below, he had never seen Emily and Timotheus employ their real strength.</p>

  <p>He had no idea about their true ability. After all, the exiles of the Snake Goddess race, the Nine Li race and the Yellow Emperor race never had an encounter fighting against each other.</p>

  <p>He saw how Emily had easily defeated all the exiles in the space where the Warden race lived. And afterwards, everyone was suppressed by the Strength Equalizing Theurgy.</p>

  <p>Through these circumstances, they still didn't have the chance to display their full strength.</p>

  <p>Now that he was looking at the sight of Timotheus's terrible strike, he was shocked with fear.</p>

  <p>When the thin line created by the broadsword touched the outer wall of the divine land, a triangular shield shadow appeared for the second time.</p>

  <p>However, this shield shadow was countless times larger than the previous one!</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>A deep muffled sound was heard in the air.</p>

  <p>Just then, the thin line which was created by the broadsword had collided with the outer wall of the divine land.</p>

  <p>The collision was exactly the same as the attack Emily had launched.</p>

  <p>There was no trace left on it.</p>

  <p>Leopold let out a breath. "The defenses of the divine land are not a threat to us. What's troublesome is the Heavenly Mirror Shield..."</p>

  <p>After Emily and Timotheus had a try, they finally stopped the idea of destroying the wall violently.</p>

  <p>But they knew they had to enter the divine land.</p>

  <p>Ramzi, several Other Shore Realm warriors of the Snake Goddess race, and the others had also tried using their own techniques.</p>

  <p>In order to break the space barrier which blocked the Grand Teleportation, Ramzi made use of the Space Breaking Rune.</p>

  <p>Another Other Shore Realm warrior of the Snake Goddess race burst out the poisonous liquid to corrode the Heavenly Mirror Shield but was unsuccessful in the end.</p>

  <p>No matter what kind of method and strategy they used, the end result was still a failure. For now, they were at a loss on what to do.</p>

  <p>"I didn't expect that we wouldn't even be able to get in a ship," an exile of the Nine Li race said and bitterly laughed.</p>

  <p>"You can't say that. After all, this ship is too important to our Nine Li race. Even the Heavenly Mirror Shield can be integrated into this ship. I think Grand Chieftain has bet everything on this ship," Timotheus said in a low voice.</p>

  <p>Timotheus had once doubted a little about Zheng's words.</p>

  <p>He didn't believe that the powerful Nine Li race was destroyed, and that the Grand Chieftain who was so formidable was defeated.</p>

  <p>Now that he stood in front of the divine land, the last doubt in his heart disappeared. If the Grand Chieftain was not in the bad situation, he wouldn't have had the reason to put all of his energy into building such a ship— the divine land.</p>

  <p>"Everyone, have a rest. Since those Yellow Emperor Guards have a way to enter, we can also find a way." Emily smiled faintly and urged everyone to take a rest.</p>

  <p>They were not discouraged.</p>

  <p>The divine land was so large. They didn't believe that a single Heavenly Mirror Shield would be able to protect it all the time, and they thought they would be able to find out a way to enter it. There must be a way they could, in time, break through it.</p>

  <p>Emily turned to look at Zheng and asked, "Zheng, do you know what weakness the divine land has?"</p>

  <p>"The weakness..." Emily's question made him be lost in thought.</p>

  <p>In fact, he didn't know much about the divine land. He had been there before but wasn't able to explore further. He didn't have the chance to see the entire place.</p>

  <p>He thought deeper. In the sun, he had indeed observed the entire divine land at a special viewing angle.</p>

  <p>Not long after, Zheng's eyes lit up at a sudden realization.</p>

  <p>"Up there!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's gaze turned up towards the outer wall of the divine land.</p>

  <p>"The top? What's on it?" Leopold asked curiously following Zheng's gaze.</p>

  <p>"Now that the divine land has merged with the Heavenly Mirror Shield, I'm afraid that the entire divine land would be under the protection of the Heavenly Mirror Shield. Is there any weakness on the top of the divine land?"</p>

  <p>"The universes built by the Holy Beings are right above. Perhaps we can enter the divine land through those universes," Zheng suggested.</p>

  <p>He was not completely sure, but he believed that it was better than nothing.</p>

  <p>Emily nodded and urged, "Let's go up to have a look!"</p>

  <p>After discussing, these Other Shore Realm warriors led the crowd to move up again.</p>

  <p>A day had already passed.</p>

  <p>They finally arrived at the top of the divine land.</p>

  <p>Compared to the bottom and both sides of the divine land, the top of the divine land was not flat.</p>

  <p>Right in the center at the top, there were many huge protuberant items. It was as if many huge balls were buried in the divine land and only small parts of the balls were exposed.</p>

  <p>"What are these?" Emily had a strange expression on her face.</p>

  <p>"Universes," Zheng simply stated.</p>

  <p>"What is the universe?" Timotheus asked in amazement.</p>

  <p>"It's the Holy Being's inner world," Zheng said with a puzzled look. These Other Shore Realm warriors didn't even know this so he could only explain, "The top masters in the divine land attach the inner worlds to the divine land. Their strength is much stronger than those consummate True Gods!"</p>

  <p>Hearing Zheng's explanation, some of the powerful Other Shore Realm warriors were still confused.</p>

  <p>Emily seemed to have understood. She smiled and said, "Lord of Weapons has really put a lot of effort into it. Such Holy Beings are even able to create the lager inner worlds with the support of this ship, and they are more powerful than the consummate True Gods. Those Holy Beings almost reach the Other Shore Realm, right?"</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>A Holy Being might not be as strong as Yellow Emperor Guards, but they were much stronger than a consummate True God and not much weaker than an ordinary Other Shore Realm warrior.</p>

  <p>More importantly, they had the ability of immortality. They would live forever and would not die as long as the universes still existed. They had more advantages compared to the Other Shore Realm warriors!</p>

  <p>Just as they approached the protruding universes, Ramzi felt something strange in the distance. He slightly turned his head, pointed to the upper left side and asked, "Look, what's that?"</p>

  <p>Upon reaching the top of the divine land, they had already been completely freed from the prison below.</p>

  <p>They could see that above them was a large area of energy clouds formed by the chaotic energy. These Chaotic Clouds didn't look big in appearance, but in fact, each of them was as large as billions of divine lands.</p>

  <p>And at the tip of the tail of the Chaotic Cloud closest to the divine land, there was a cyan light dot that was rapidly moving.</p>

  <p>Behind the cyan light dot, there were a few black dots following closely!</p>
