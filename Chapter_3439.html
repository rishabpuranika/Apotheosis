  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Chaos Ancient God that controlled the bottom-layer space rules held the right to delete spaces.</p>

  <p>But those deleted spaces could still be recovered.</p>

  <p>Within a certain grace period, they could recover a space they regretted deleting. After this time, though, absolutely nothing could be done.</p>

  <p>Having once been a Son of Truth in charge of space, the Regal Jade Spirit was well aware of this fact.</p>

  <p>So what Zheng said about the strange scene was more surprising than the news that he had found the arc light energy.</p>

  <p>Once Zheng dispersed the avatar, he took the Regal Jade Spirit out of his inner world and had him hide within his body.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 was a part of the Chaos Ancient Gods named Gerald. As the two Chaos Ancient Gods stayed together, they weren't particularly uncomfortable. Now, they were both quietly observing their surroundings.</p>

  <p>The space passageway wasn't that long, and it didn't take too long for the three people to reach the end of it. Emerging from it, Zheng saw an ancient door, identical to what he had seen before.</p>

  <p>When the handsome man pushed the door open, they were met with huge narrow bronze pillars— they were like snakes, strangely entangled with each other.</p>

  <p>Zheng had noticed the bronze pillars when he was first exiled into the space.</p>

  <p>But from where he had been, he could only see dark-golden lines.</p>

  <p>Behind the pillars lay the end of the space.</p>

  <p>It was nothing like a wall, but something resembled black fur.</p>

  <p>"Eh? What happened to the Deleting Pillars? Why did they end up like this?! This…" Fear and doubt seeped into the Regal Jade Spirit's voice.</p>

  <p>"Are you talking about these pillars?" Zheng asked, confused.</p>

  <p>"Yes! The Deleting Pillars serve as the foundation of this space. It's impossible to destroy them— not even the Sons of Truth can do so. In every period of time, these pillars would delete all the things in the space before turning it into a void. But everything seems to have changed, now!" the Regal Jade Spirit explained as he surveyed the void in the distance.</p>

  <p>Although the ancient door had sent Zheng a great distance away, he could still see the creatures' remains that formed piles of debris.</p>

  <p>After seeing the debris Zheng was talking about, the Regal Jade Spirit finally came to understand what was fundamentally wrong with the space.</p>

  <p>"Since you mastered the space truth of the chaos back then, haven't you discovered anything strange?" "Their master was born in the 77th civilization, and you were born in the 749th," No. 9527 added.</p>

  <p>There were over six hundred civilizations that filled the gap between the two civilizations. During this process, over six hundred creatures had become the Chaos Ancient Gods, controlling the bottom-layer truth of space.</p>

  <p>But the humans of the 77th civilization were either hiding on the Other Shore and unable to descend to the Source World, or hiding in this void space.</p>

  <p>In hiding, not only did they need to avoid being deleted by the Deleting Pillars, they also had to avoid being discovered by the Chaos Ancient Gods.</p>

  <p>By no means was it an easy feat.</p>

  <p>"I've never found anything wrong with it…" the Regal Jade Spirit muttered as he shook his head.</p>

  <p>As the Regal Jade Spirit talked to No. 9527, the handsome man said,</p>

  <p>"We've arrived. Please follow me."</p>

  <p>"Where are you going to take me?" Zheng couldn't help but ask.</p>

  <p>"Over there," the woman pointed as she smiled sweetly.</p>

  <p>Following the woman's gaze, Zheng looked into the distance. On a node where the Deleting Pillars met stood a palace.</p>

  <p>Its shape and craft were completely different from what Zheng had ever seen in a structure before.</p>

  <p>Once they entered the palace, Zheng asked, "It's only you two living in this palace?"</p>

  <p>The man nodded and said, "The master and his other disciples have already left."</p>

  <p>"Left? Have they returned to the chaos?" Zheng inquired further.</p>

  <p>Shaking her head, the woman replied, "They've already gone to the outside of the chaos."</p>

  <p>That drew a gasp from Zheng. "Outside the chaos…"</p>

  <p>Even the Regal Jade Spirit and No. 9527 were shocked to hear such a thing.</p>

  <p>The development of the chaos was a continuous one. Many clues of its development lay on the Other Shore— if one could reach the Other Shore's higher stages, they'd uncover secrets of the chaos along the way.</p>

  <p>But what lay outside the chaos had always been a great mystery.</p>

  <p>Catching Zheng's reaction, the two smiled.</p>

  <p>While it was true that they hadn't even been to the Source World, they had heard much of it from their master. Since the moment the chaos was born, no one had left it.</p>

  <p>In the Source World, it was an absolute truth that no one could leave the Chaos.</p>

  <p>But their master having done so gave the two a sense of pride.</p>

  <p>"Ask them how to leave and what's outside the chaos!" both the Regal Jade Spirit and No. 9572 urged Zheng simultaneously.</p>

  <p>The two were powerful and wise beings— very few secrets could even arouse their curiosity. But they were eager to know what exactly was outside the chaos.</p>

  <p>"I wonder how your master managed to leave the chaos…and what is even out there?" Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>The woman merely shook her head. "The space outside the chaos is indescribable. Master also said it was beyond any descriptions we could make with our language. It's something that can only be experienced— no one will understand it through words."</p>

  <p>"Why haven't you left the place and experienced it with your master?" Zheng returned.</p>

  <p>Helplessness flashed across the man's face. "We didn't dare disobey our master's orders. He asked us to wait for you."</p>

  <p>"Me? You were expecting me to come?" Zheng pursed his lips as he frowned at the thought.</p>

  <p>While he was born in this round of chaos, he had never seen their master at all. Zheng deeply doubted the couple's words.</p>

  <p>With a hint of a sigh, the man continued, "Our master said that the chaos would come to its last round sooner or later. The human race dominating the chaos again will signal a critical time. You're the first human we've ever found since then, and the news you've brought with you is in line with our master's prediction."</p>

  <p>Creatures born in each round of chaos were completely different. There were great differences between the different civilizations themselves as well.</p>

  <p>Human beings appeared once in the 77th civilization— never again after that. To see a human appear in this round of chaos was truly a phenomenon.</p>

  <p>The human race in the Source World couldn't exactly be considered a ruling force. But after the development over the past years, the various human forces had also developed into super forces— such a development didn't happen accidentally.</p>

  <p>"So why did your master ask you to wait for me?" Zheng asked again.</p>

  <p>The man smiled and said, "Master has hidden in this space for countless years. He hopes the human race will thrive again, so he's been diligently waiting for the right opportunity."</p>

  <p>Turning his head, he looked upon the statue— it was exactly the same as the one on the small star. Engraved beneath it was the name 'King Manard.'</p>
