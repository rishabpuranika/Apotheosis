<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2929 The Power Of The Ruling Slate </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Estelle and Holy Jay looked up.</p>

  <p>When they felt the auras of the newcomers, their eyes widened in shock.</p>

  <p>Two Yellow Emperor Guards had arrived.</p>

  <p>Estelle and Holy Jay had already witnessed the strength of these two guards before, so the moment they saw them, the only thought that came to their minds was to escape. They had traveled using Grand Teleportation several times before finally stopping at this remote place, and yet these two warriors at the Other Shore Realm had been able to follow them.</p>

  <p>Obviously, they had some kind of secret tracking technique, so it didn't make sense to continue playing the game of cat and mouse with them in the divine land. Right now, the best place for Estelle and Holy Jay to go to was the latter's universe, the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land where Zheng had cultivated before.</p>

  <p>Holy Jay's universe was protected by the rules of the Ruling Slate, so even the Yellow Emperor Guards wouldn't dare to break in.</p>

  <p>As Holy Jay gently waved his hand, ripples appeared in the space in front of him.</p>

  <p>Just as Estelle and Holy Jay were about to step forward and disappear into the universe, Salim laughed coldly and said, "Seal!"</p>

  <p>Crack...</p>

  <p>All space within a thousand miles was immediately sealed.</p>

  <p>The divine citizens and the rest of the creatures living there did not notice any change in the environment, but the ripples that had appeared in front of Estelle and Holy Jay disappeared without a trace.</p>

  <p>"You want to escape right under our noses? No way!"</p>

  <p>Zavier said, leisurely stretching his body. The power pouring out from his body was rapidly accumulating. Like a hidden leopard, he was ready to launch a fatal attack at any time.</p>

  <p>Holy Jay and Estelle narrowed their eyes slightly. They had not expected the Yellow Emperor Guards to find them at all. If they had, they would have escaped to the universe or at least to the outside of the divine land as soon as Zheng entered the Mountain of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>Salim also smiled faintly. "Anyone who attempts to attack the Yellow Emperor Guards will have to pay the price."</p>

  <p>Then, along with Zavier, he slowly descended to the ground and strolled toward Holy Jay and Estelle. In their eyes, the Holy Being and the consummate True God in front of them were like lambs waiting to be slaughtered.</p>

  <p>However, Holy Jay and Estelle didn't plan on waiting for death to come.</p>

  <p>Their minds were racing as they desperately tried to think of a way out of here.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the Mountain of Holy Beings, Zheng finally arrived at the gate.</p>

  <p>Without any pause, he took a small step forward and entered the silver passageway.</p>

  <p>All the Holy Beings of the divine land were gathered around the mountain, eagerly waiting to find out which of the warriors who had entered the mountain had become Holy Beings and which of them hadn't. The result was very important to them.</p>

  <p>However, they weren't expecting anyone to come out of the mountain any time soon. There was still a long time before the Mountain of Holy Beings would close, and normally, no one would retreat halfway.</p>

  <p>But just then, ripples appeared on the surface of the gate under the Mountain of Holy Beings, and a figure stepped out from them.</p>

  <p>"Is that Zheng?" Clark frowned slightly.</p>

  <p>"He didn't make it?" A look of surprise came over Murphy's face.</p>

  <p>All the Holy Beings of the alliance of the powerful clans had witnessed Zheng's power before. They had thought that with his strength, he would definitely become a Holy Being.</p>

  <p>And since he had managed to enter the Mountain of Holy Beings, they had no doubt that he would be able to occupy a holy spring. Murphy had even discussed this with his group.</p>

  <p>"Since he has failed to become a Holy Being, I'm afraid he's going to have a miserable end," said Zeke.</p>

  <p>The Yellow Emperor Guards also had their eyes fixed on the gate of the Mountain of Holy Beings. How could they let Zheng go so easily?</p>

  <p>What they did not know was that Leyton and Samuel had already come up with a thorough plan and wrote a rule on the Ruling Slate to kill Zheng.</p>

  <p>The moment Zheng stepped out into the divine land, that rule was activated.</p>

  <p>A golden light flashed through that eye-catching rule in the middle of the Ruling Slate, and even the mountain that bore the slate started to shake.</p>

  <p>A powerful force began to gather.</p>

  <p>Crack, crack, crack...</p>

  <p>Azure blue lightning crackled and multiplied around the slate, almost covering it.</p>

  <p>The power released by the terrifying lightning came down from the sky above the Time Sea and enveloped every Floating Island.</p>

  <p>Overwhelmed by the power of the lightning, the Floating Islands of the powerful clans began to shake violently like boats on a stormy sea. Some of the people who were standing on the edge of the Floating Islands slipped and fell into the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>Everyone else on the Floating Islands immediately fell to the ground as well, unable to keep their balance. Many of them tried to get up, but the massive pressure from the sky kept them pressed on the ground.</p>

  <p>Fear appeared on their faces as they found themselves unable to resist the power.</p>

  <p>"What the hell is this? Is it doomsday?"</p>

  <p>"Who knows? I've been on this Floating Island for less than two years, and so many things have happened already. I shouldn't have come here!"</p>

  <p>"Why... Why do I feel like our Floating Island is sinking?"</p>

  <p>They all fretted about what was happening. The truth was, the Floating Islands were indeed sinking. The terrible pressure was pressing the Floating Islands down like a huge invisible hand.</p>

  <p>For countless years, these islands had been floating in the air by virtue of the magic arrays set up by the powerful clans and their own buoyant force.</p>

  <p>But as the powerful pressure continued to press them down, they began sinking into the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>The Floating Island of the Luo Clan was the first to begin sinking into the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>After the last ranking of the Floating Islands was decided, the Floating Island of the Zhou Clan had fallen into the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>The Luo Clan's Floating Island, which had been ranked just above the Zhou Clan's, was supposed to be safe until the next ranking.</p>

  <p>However, this sudden pressure was pressing the bare Floating Island of the Luo Clan into the Time Sea now.</p>

  <p>Like all the other Floating Islands that had sunk into the Time Sea before, the large Floating Island of the Luo Clan was quickly disintegrated and torn up in the sea before finally vanishing without a trace.</p>

  <p>Once the Floating Island of the Luo Clan completely disappeared from sight, it seemed that the rest of the Floating Islands would follow. The Floating Islands of another two clans both looked to be in a precarious position.</p>

  <p>These two Floating Islands were different from that of the Luo Clan. After all, the Floating Island of the Luo Clan had been completely empty, but these two islands were full of people.</p>

  <p>Some of the True Gods were quick to react. As soon as they realized that something was wrong, they wanted to escape through the transmission arrays, but they couldn't move even a step under the huge pressure. In the end, only some of the guards guarding the transmission arrays managed to escape.</p>

  <p>Noticing the severity of the situation, a Holy Being from one of the two clans appeared in worry.</p>

  <p>In a flash, he appeared beneath his Floating Island.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the base of the island was hovering only a few feet above the Time Sea. Half of the Holy Being's body was submerged in the sea, but he managed to support the Floating Island with his shoulders.</p>

  <p>With his strength, the Floating Island slowly rose against the pressure.</p>
