<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2657 Pierced In The Chest </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>A series of bangs, cracks, whooshes sounded. . .</p>

  <p>The clanging sounds of the swords colliding with each other, the crackling sound of bones being broken, and the squelching of blood as a body was pieced by a sharp weapon - all these sounds rang out from time to time.</p>

  <p>Lives were like weeds, being ruthlessly uprooted and cast aside.</p>

  <p>The tomb keeper walked over briskly. He had a sharp gaze and looked relaxed.</p>

  <p>For him, this battle was a spicy deviation from his long years of boring cultivation.</p>

  <p>He had promised to help the Warden race, but he had to choose his opponents carefully.</p>

  <p>Just ahead of him, Emily took a step forward.</p>

  <p>The annular saber in her hand circled around and shot towards a man in a black robe.</p>

  <p>Emily had made an ingenious move. Not only did it allow her to avoid the sword shadow that the man in the black robe had thrown at her, she had also feigned an attack, goading the other party into making a wrong judgment.</p>

  <p>The man in the black robe didn't know how to dodge and panicked.</p>

  <p>The annular saber whizzed past his neck.</p>

  <p>Before his blood could leave a mark on the saber, the man in the black robe had already fallen backwards.</p>

  <p>Bergen had cut in half the annular saber that she had previously used in order to save Luo Zheng. Emily had had to get a new one.</p>

  <p>"Annular saber? The Snake Goddess race?"</p>

  <p>The eyes of the tomb keeper widened as he saw the saber in Emily's hand.</p>

  <p>This type of weapon was unique and very few people were actually good at using it. As the tomb keeper recollected, only a few women in the Snake Goddess race were ever any good at using this kind of weapon.</p>

  <p>The most famous of all annular sabers in the Snake Goddess race as well as in the Source World was called the Soul Conquering Ring.</p>

  <p>But Emily's trick had attracted his attention.</p>

  <p>Without a second thought, the tomb keeper chose Emily as his opponent.</p>

  <p>He stepped onto the ground and went straight up to Emily.</p>

  <p>Once Emily had killed the man in the black robe, she looked up, her beautiful eyes narrowed, and locked onto her second goal. A voice sounded just as she turned around.</p>

  <p>"You can be my opponent," the tomb keeper said with a smile.</p>

  <p>Emily looked askance at him.</p>

  <p>All the Warden members were dressed in black. Even under their black robes, their clothes were of a color that remained distinct.</p>

  <p>The tomb keeper's clothes were completely different.</p>

  <p>Before Emily could respond, the tomb keeper rushed towards her, two daggers held aloft in his hands.</p>

  <p>Emily didn't hesitate.</p>

  <p>She turned the saber in her hand and brought it crashing down to the tomb keeper's face.</p>

  <p>She had used the perfect speed and strength in launching the strike.</p>

  <p>Ordinary people would have been forced to retreat in the face of such a strike, while Emily would close in and throw in deadly blows one after another. Once she forced her opponent to reveal a flaw in their defense, another deadly strike would find its way to them.</p>

  <p>But she hadn't expected the tomb keeper's strength!</p>

  <p>The tomb keeper had no intention of backing down and met Emily's attack head on.</p>

  <p>He turned the two daggers into an angle that managed to block Emily's attack. .</p>

  <p>The saber slid down along the length of the daggers, spraying sparks as it went.</p>

  <p>The moment the daggers twisted, Emily felt a strange force coming over her. She could hardly hold the saber in her hand and before long, it flew out of her hand.</p>

  <p>Emily retreated in a moment of desperation. Fear spread within her as she sized her opponent up once again.</p>

  <p>Everyone now had the same level of strength once the Strength Equalizing token was activated. The Chaos Ancient God had proffered special treatment to the Warden race. This meant that everyone else had to fend for themselves and find a way to utilize their strengths to win their fights.</p>

  <p>This man had only used two unremarkable daggers and he had still been able to perfectly utilize his strength. Emily knew dealing with him was going to be tricky.</p>

  <p>"You are not a member of the Warden race?" Emily asked, frowning.</p>

  <p>"Who says I am?" the tomb keeper said, smiling.</p>

  <p>"Why did you help them?" Emily persisted.</p>

  <p>The tomb keeper shrugged and answered her, "Maybe because we've been neighbors for so long that I felt obliged to do it."</p>

  <p>That was all the explanation he offered.</p>

  <p>He then charged at Emily again, brandishing the two daggers.</p>

  <p>The tomb keeper wasn't very flexible. His movements looked rigid and clumsy, but he knew how to control his strength perfectly.</p>

  <p>Every time his daggers touched Emily's saber, the force affected Emily, making it difficult for Emily to hold on to the saber.</p>

  <p>So she kept retreating, constantly adjusting, and constantly trying her best to adapt to his attacks.</p>

  <p>The tomb keeper still had that jerky smile on his face, but it didn't reach his eyes.</p>

  <p>It wasn't until he had attacked her dozens of times in a row that Emily finally, completely adapted to his strength.</p>

  <p>But just as Emily attempted to counterattack, the tomb keeper suddenly changed his move.</p>

  <p>With a flip of both daggers, he sent one of them into the edge of the saber, and the other hit it hard with its sharp blade.</p>

  <p>The force pierced the saber and hit Emily's hand.</p>

  <p>Emily felt her hand numb, the saber finally flying out of her hand.</p>

  <p>The tomb keeper did not stop. He stabbed at Emily with the dagger in his left hand.</p>

  <p>Having lost her weapon, Emily had no choice but to grab the dagger.</p>

  <p>It cut open her palm, blood gushing out in rivulets.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha!" The tomb keeper laughed, and pushed the other dagger into Emily's chest.</p>

  <p>The dagger, which was several inches long, passed clear through Emily's body.</p>

  <p>Only the hilt and the top of the dagger could be seen on either side.</p>

  <p>Just at this moment, a blade came at him from the side.</p>

  <p>It carved a crooked path in the air, and was headed at the tomb keeper's right arm.</p>

  <p>"This swordsmanship..."</p>

  <p>The tomb keeper frowned.</p>

  <p>He couldn't even see the direction this sword momentum was coming from. And this unremarkable sword strike had now forced him to retreat.</p>

  <p>The dagger remained in Emily's body.</p>

  <p>Emily covered her chest with one hand, her face pale with the pain.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stood in front of Emily, a long sword in hand and said, "Don't pull out the dagger! Hold on a minute!"</p>

  <p>Such an injury as hers would have been undoubtedly fatal to an ordinary person.</p>

  <p>But for a powerful warrior at the Other Shore Realm, the wound was minor, provided the Strength Equalizing token ended.</p>

  <p>The question was: Could Emily hold on until then?</p>

  <p>The tomb keeper took a few steps backwards and looked at Luo Zheng with interest. "Here's someone else who looks more interesting-"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng raised his sword and rushed at the tomb keeper before he could finish talking. .</p>

  <p>With a whooshing sound, the dozens of strikes that Luo Zheng had launched made their way over to the tomb keeper.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng's sword collided with the man's dagger, he could also feel a twisted force emanating from it.</p>

  <p>It was as if this force was pulling the long sword away from him. He felt like he could hardly hold the sword in his hands.</p>

  <p>The tomb keeper retreated before he was able to stabilize himself.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's swordsmanship was ingenious, but it was quite easy for the tomb keeper to see through it. dozens of strikes later, his eyes flashed. He had found a way to break Luo Zheng's swordsmanship!</p>

  <p>He waved the dagger rapidly so that it spun like a flower. .</p>

  <p>As the flower hit Luo Zheng's sword, Luo Zheng finally felt his right hand weaken, and his long sword forced out of his hand.</p>

  <p>The tomb keeper only smiled, and seemed to take it as a matter of course. He waved his dagger at Luo Zheng, but in this moment, he sensed that something was wrong.</p>

  <p>"This is..."</p>

  <p>He suddenly looked up to find that in a whirlpool in the air, a speck of green starlight was rapidly descending onto his head!</p>
