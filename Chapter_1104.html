  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Oh? Why is that?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng asked with a strange expression.</p>

  <p>Fiona's face was filled with worry. "If you defeat me, the little monster will definitely challenge you. He's a madman, a true madman. He'll kill you," she told Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He smiled at her words. She was truly worried about him given the seriousness in her tone. Fiona was indeed a pure, kind-hearted princess.</p>

  <p>Only under the protection of the royal family would someone like her grow up to be a powerful and pure martial artist.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng appreciated her goodwill, "Thank you for your concern. I know what to do."</p>

  <p>Fiona knew Luo Luo Zheng was a person who wouldn't listen to other people's advice. She nodded and said, "Alright. I'll be making my move. Be careful!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was rendered speechless at how nice Fiona was. She actually reminded him before she launched her attack.</p>

  <p>She was modest and obedient but her next actions caused Luo Zheng's expression to change.</p>

  <p>Fiona raised her hand, revealing a red jade bracelet that emitted so much power. Luo Luo Zheng felt his heart palpitate.</p>

  <p>His eyes widened as he stared at the bracelet.</p>

  <p>"W-What treasure is this?"</p>

  <p>Noticing the intrigued look in his eyes, Fiona temporarily halted her attack. "It was a gift from my father," she answered.</p>

  <p>Her words rendered Luo Luo Zheng speechless along with many of the martial artists in the square.</p>

  <p>It was absurd but also funny.</p>

  <p>Fiona was really just too nice. Instead of launching her attack, she actually stopped to answer her opponent's question.</p>

  <p>"Ah, she's so cute!"</p>

  <p>"She is the Wind Divine Kingdom's princess! Don't get any ideas!"</p>

  <p>"Hmph, don't look down on her. Even if she tells you all her weaknesses, you're still no match for her. She may be innocent but her strength is unfathomable!"</p>

  <p>Even War King Wind's face had an awkward expression.</p>

  <p>"Your daughter is impressive," Turner said. "She's also very cute."</p>

  <p>There was a slight buzz of discussion in the crowd regarding Fiona's actions. However, her next words rendered them silent.</p>

  <p>"I like this bracelet very much. It's a semi-divine weapon," she said, gently stroking the bracelet with her hand.</p>

  <p>A semi-divine weapon?</p>

  <p>Even that shocked Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>There were certain levels when it came to weapons: a spiritual weapon, a fairy weapon, a sacred weapon, and lastly, at the Luo Zhengith, a divine weapon.</p>

  <p>What Luo Luo Zheng possessed right now was his long sword which was a top-grade sacred weapon. But a divine weapon? He briefly wondered what that would look like since he had never seen one before.</p>

  <p>He previously speculated that the divine kingdoms possessed a divine weapon.</p>

  <p>Fiona's words had served to confirm Luo Zheng's speculations. A semi-divine weapon should be very close to a divine weapon given its superiority against a top-grade sacred weapon.</p>

  <p>Everyone's eyes were trained on that red bracelet.</p>

  <p>It wasn't a secret that the four divine kingdoms possessed divine weapons; however, these were considered treasures that laid down the foundation of a kingdom. These types of weapons would rarely be shown to the public.</p>

  <p>For one to see a true divine weapon in person was impossible under normal circumstances.</p>

  <p>So it was understandable for the warriors to be intrigued by this semi-divine weapon.</p>

  <p>"Be careful of that bracelet," a voice whispered in his mind.</p>

  <p>Xun was wary of the bracelet's power. Ever since Luo Luo Zheng had entered the divine kingdom, he had concealed his strength and prevented Xun from leaving his body. However, the bracelet was frightening enough for her to make her presence known in his mind.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry, I will," he told her. Even without her reminder, Luo Luo Zheng was determined to be vigilant in this fight.</p>

  <p>"Alright then. I'll make a move now, for real this time!" She waved her white wrist and the bracelet began to vibrate.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>Scarlet flames burst from Fiona's hand and engulfed her entire arm as if her appendage had been made of flames.</p>

  <p>"It's at least the third layer of Fire Law!" Luo Zheng's eyes flashed.</p>

  <p>Fiona quickly took a step forward and suddenly disappeared. Luo Luo Zheng was taken aback for a few seconds until she appeared once again, the distance between the two of them shorter than earlier.</p>

  <p>"Space Law? No, this is the Time Law! Fiona practiced two laws! Not only that, but her comprehension is also very high. Far beyond Camilla's."</p>

  <p>Her movements were very similar to Luo Zheng's space traveling; however, it was only a visual effect.</p>

  <p>Fiona froze time whenever she drew closer to Luo Luo Zheng, thus giving him no time to react.</p>

  <p>He would be lying if he said he wasn't afraid now that he knew that his opponent had a semi-divine weapon and was a master of two laws.</p>

  <p>One truly shouldn't judge a book by its cover. Fiona might have been cute but her strength was unparalleled. Even Logan, who was supposedly invincible among Virtual Tribulation Realm warriors, would be no match.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng knew when to pick his battles and for this one, he chose to retreat.</p>

  <p>The Time Law was even more terrifying compared to the Space Law.</p>

  <p>With Space Law, Luo Luo Zheng would be able to travel through space and instantly close the gap between him and his opponent. This made it hard for his opponent to dodge his attacks but it still gave his opponent a chance to react.</p>

  <p>Fiona's Time Law was different. She was able to compress the time flow and, within a certain range, control it to make it impossible for Luo Luo Zheng to predict her movements.</p>

  <p>How could he ever hope to fight against her?</p>

  <p>There was no going around this dilemma. The only way he could win this was to comprehend Time Law as well.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, this conclusion had come to Luo Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>In fact, he was right.</p>

  <p>There were many martial artists in the Upper World who practiced the Time Law. Only the Time Law was able to resist the Time Law. But a high-level Space Law might also be able to resist low-level Time Law.</p>

  <p>When the power of these laws reached the higher levels, there could potentially be earth-shattering consequences.</p>

  <p>There was no way Luo Luo Zheng would be able to restrain Fiona's Time Law, at least, for now.</p>

  <p>Next thing he knew, Fiona was already beside him, her flaming arm ready to come down his head.</p>

  <p>There was simply no time for Luo Luo Zheng to react but, just as she was about to attack, Fiona stopped halfway which greatly surprised the crowd. "It'll hurt a bit if I knock you out, but it won't injure you too badly."</p>

  <p>Her hesitation gave him time to escape. Luo Luo Zheng travelled through space and put some distance between him and Fiona.</p>

  <p>He had a grim expression on his face. He was able to dodge only because of her warning; however, he knew he was only delaying the inevitable attack.</p>

  <p>"He has escaped?" But nobody could escape time. Fiona was a bit disappointed. She saw her warning as an extension of goodwill, but he actually took it as an opportunity to dodge.</p>

  <p>She thought he was being crafty but really it was because she was simply too kind-hearted.</p>

  <p>Still, she wasn't too bothered. She possessed the power of Time Law, so she could always just catch him again.</p>

  <p>Fiona once again focused on changing time flow within a several hundred feet radius. Their surroundings had slowed and Luo Luo Zheng felt as if he was moving in slow motion.</p>

  <p>She appeared in front of him once again, her flaming palm ready to strike him down.</p>

  <p>'I won't remind you this time, ' Fiona thought to herself.</p>

  <p>Of course, her kind-hearted nature still won her over. Instead of unleashing her full-strength, she only used around seventy-percent of her power since she didn't want to kill Luo Luo Zheng.</p>
