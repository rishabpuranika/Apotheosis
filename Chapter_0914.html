<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 914 The Life-saving Straw (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Even if the Tide of Chaos had not erupted, Fabian and Esther would still have gone all out to stop them.</p>

  <p>However with the outbreak of the Tide of Chaos, everything in the inner circle had now changed. They were sure to die if they recklessly entered the inner circle now.</p>

  <p>Seeing Fabian stand in his way, Zheng looked on helplessly. Fabian was not Zheng and he did not understand what he was thinking. Moreover, Zheng had no intention of sharing his secret with anyone.</p>

  <p>"Please get out of my way, I have something very important to do," Zheng said calmly.</p>

  <p>Jarrod also barred Zheng's way to stop him. "Zheng, you're very important to our Purple Heart Sacred Place. We simply can't let you go forward any further.</p>

  <p>You will die!"</p>

  <p>"Really?" A faint smile appeared on Zheng's face. "But what if I have more important things to do? Do you mean that I should give up on myself just because I am important to your Purple Heart Sacred Place?" Zheng looked intently at them until they had to look away shamefaced.</p>

  <p>"This... Why would you have to give up on yourself?" Jarrod asked in puzzlement.</p>

  <p>Zheng shook his head, as there was no way in which he could explain, and said, "I don't need you to come with me. I'll go by myself!"</p>

  <p>Xun also looked questioningly at Esther who was kneeling on the ground. She lowered her head and asked, "What are you doing?"</p>

  <p>"My queen, the inner circle is not a place you can safely enter now. You'd better stay here and wait for the demonic beasts to retreat, and then we can leave here," Esther said as she lowered her head.</p>

  <p>Xun was the supreme queen in Esther's heart. Technically, Xun was very powerful and there was no need for Esther to worry about her safety. However, Esther also understood that something had been happening to the Demon Night in the Upper World, because Xun's statue had begun to lose its luster and had become dark and dim. In other words, the sword spirit in front of her was Xun's final soul fragment!</p>

  <p>If Zheng were to die, this soul fragment would also vanish into thin air, and in the end, their queen would die!</p>

  <p>This was something that Esther would never want to see.</p>

  <p>"I don't need you to make decisions for me," Xun said coldly to Esther, regaining her commanding demeanor.</p>

  <p>Esther gritted her teeth. She was fully aware that she had no right to persuade or lecture Xun who was her queen. Even Amber, the leader of the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place, was not qualified to do so, much less Esther, who was inferior to Amber.</p>

  <p>"Since you have made up your mind, I will follow you inside!" Esther said seriously.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the top-level war lords of the Demon Night next to Esther also knelt down. There was a resolute expression on their faces.</p>

  <p>They were all well aware that they would probably die if they entered the inner circle of the Dark Nether Cave at this time, with the Tide of Chaos raging, but they still chose to follow their queen. They would follow her into hell itself if needed be!</p>

  <p>Fabian and Jarrod became even more depressed as they saw the actions of the Demon Night war lords. If these war lords of the Demon Night followed Zheng and entered the inner circle, then the two of them would be left here alone. After thinking for a moment, Fabian held his head in his hands and said, "Okay, I still don't think that you should go, but we too shall brave the inner area with you!"</p>

  <p>Sometimes, decisions had to be made through hard way.</p>

  <p>Moreover the demonic beasts in the outer circle didn't have any intention of leaving. If these demonic beasts didn't leave then they would be stuck here with no way to return! In the end the team formed up and began to advance towards the inner circle. Though trepidation filled their steps, they marched on with forceful steps.</p>

  <p>Shortly after Zheng and the others had left, near the Bloody Pass, three columns of smoke unfurled off into the opposite direction!</p>

  <p>The three members of the Night Group possessed quite a few unique skills.</p>

  <p>They dematerialized into smoke and circled in the air. However, they were slowly moving towards the outside of the Bloody Pass.</p>

  <p>It cost them a lot of life vitality to utilize such a technique of evasion. But, every time, once they had only thirty percent of their life vitality left, the three of them would suddenly rematerialize on the ground underneath the beaks of the Swallowing Birds and the sharp claws of the Azure Wolves.</p>

  <p>They would then rapidly dash forward for some distance. During this process, they would take out life vitality crystals to replenish their own life vitality!</p>

  <p>After they had replenished their life vitality, they once again turned into columns of smoke, repeating the same process over and over again!</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, although they were able to survive for the time being using this technique, the demonic beasts were still lingering around them. They were still in a dangerous situation with the demonic beasts circling around them every time they materialized.</p>

  <p>Moving in this way was proving extremely inefficient. It would be almost impossible for them to reach the Tower of Sin in such a tedious way. Even if they wanted to continue like this, there was not enough time for them.</p>

  <p>Furthermore the life vitality crystals were far from enough to sustain their escape method!</p>

  <p>Though they had a great number of supreme life vitality crystals with them, these would be used up eventually. Every time that they used one then there would be one less left. Just in a short period of time, each of them had used up half of their life vitality crystals in order to cover a small distance indeed. If this continued, then it wouldn't be long before they were left stranded and would be swallowed up by these beasts!</p>

  <p>"What should we do, brother!" one of the Night Group top-level war lords asked as they traveled in their temporary incorporeal forms.</p>
