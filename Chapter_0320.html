<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 320 Green Wave (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As for Chase, he was far better known and respected than Brady because he had made thirteen fairy weapons altogether putting him in a different league all together. Even during the entire course of the Eastern Region's long history, he was the only weapon refiner who was able to make such a significant achievement leaving a legacy.</p>

  <p>All of those thirteen weapons were finished at his peak. He did try one last time to make another fairy weapon during his late years, but he had already run out of his great talent.</p>

  <p>These three swords in front of Luo Zheng were Chase's last attempts at making a fairy weapon during his final days.</p>

  <p>He exhausted the remaining inspiration and strength to make these three swords before he eventually died. Some strongly believed that he would have lived for several more years had he not exerted himself.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng pulled the sword lightly, and the sharp edge of the sword popped out of its sheath, it was that light and fast.</p>

  <p>"Shiiiiiing! Vzzzzt..."</p>

  <p>The green edge kept shaking, almost emitting strong vibrations, after it was pulled out of the sheath. Its ringing sound carried itself to the entire space around them, and it sounded refreshing and pleasing as a fairy playing a zither.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng lifted the sword and observed its movement casually. Its thin edge was so crystal clear that he could see through it. Everything he saw through this weapon was tinted green.</p>

  <p>"It's a good sword," he praised as he admired the perfect piece of weapon.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had a somewhat broad knowledge of weapons because he had visited the weapon house in White Emperor City, not to mention the fairy palace too. Even so, he couldn't help but feel amazed at the brillance and slender nature of this beautiful sword.</p>

  <p>The shopkeeper smiled as he spoke out, "It surely is. Its raw material is the wings of the golden cicadas which give its colour and strength."</p>

  <p>The golden cicada was one of level seven beasts. It was almost as rare as the fire scorpion lion which was a little higher up the rank. Evidently procuring golden cicadas' wings was not an easy task, but it was even harder to make a sword with them.</p>

  <p>The golden cicadas had very hard and sharp wings which could easily cut through iron and leave a lasting mark.</p>

  <p>However, the wings couldn't be used directly to make weapons. One reason was that they had poor ductility due to their great solidity. Aside from that, the wings could only maintain their supernatural power when they were still on the cicadas' alive bodies.</p>

  <p>Once they were removed from the cicadas, the wings would lose their energies and soon become fragile almost instantly. After a short time, they would easily break apart just upon being touched so that they couldn't be used to make a weapon.</p>

  <p>Owing to this very reason, the hunters needed to get the golden cicadas' blood and immerse the wings in it. After that, they had to rush back to the capital of Burning Sky Empire and hand the materials to Chase who would then use his knowledge and special method to preserve the wings.</p>

  <p>In this way, the ductility and potence of the wings were balanced to the highest extent possible.</p>

  <p>"Although Chase failed to make the 'Green Wave' into a fairy weapon, it is one of the best weapons among its rank. Its power and quality are extremely close to an actual fairy weapon!" the shopkeeper said with excitement as his face beamed with pride.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng held the sword with a tight grip in his hand and casually waved it in the air. Although he mainly learned about the Purple Light Fist instead of any swordsmanship, he still had some basic skills of using a sword because it was a required course for every warrior. His swift motion was smooth and sharp as he performed a set of swordplay with the Green Wave.</p>

  <p>He could feel that the edge of this sword was quite different from a metal weapon. After all, its material was taken from a living creature, and there were numerous tiny spaces among the dead cells. Luo Zheng tried to inject his demonic life vitality into the "Green Wave", and the sword was immediately filled with his energies. Under the influence of his great power, the green sword turned into a color of deep purple.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Luo, how do you like this sword?" asked the shopkeeper, trying to get an impression of his first thoughts.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded lightly, "It's really a good weapon. I want to know about the prices of the Nine Edges Sword and the Green Wave respectively."</p>

  <p>The shopkeeper pointed at the Nine Edges Sword as he answered,</p>

  <p>"Although these two swords are both high-level spiritual weapons, they differ a lot in their prices owing to their distinct properties. This Nine Edges Sword will cost you about 30, 000 cubic crystals, while the Green Wave will cost you 80, 000."</p>

  <p>After hearing the shopkeeper's words, Luo Zheng was slightly astonished and taken aback by the high price.</p>

  <p>He was prepared as he knew that the spiritual weapons would cost much more than his previous weapons, but he never once expected such a high number.</p>

  <p>Despite that, he realised that the high prices were reasonable enough as they were high-quality after he pondered over it.</p>

  <p>For example, he had once sold a crystal core of fire scorpion lion for 70, 000 cubic crystals at an auction. The crystal core could be used to strengthen the power of the fire generated by a weapon refiner or a pill refiner's life energies.</p>

  <p>The main materials of the Green Wave were the wings of the golden cicadas which were close to the fire scorpion lions in their ranks.</p>

  <p>According to ranks of the beasts, the golden cicadas' wings might only be a bit cheaper than the crystal cores of fire scorpion lions.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the golden cicadas' wings still required more processes and refinement before they were finally trasnformed into the mighty Green Wave, not to mention that it was made by the famous Chase. To be honest, now after analysing everything, Luo Zheng felt that this weapon was being sold at a very cheap rate.</p>

  <p>As he was not prepared to make such an investment, he didn't bring so many cubic crystals with him, but that wasn't a problem.</p>

  <p>With the Blessed Draft Bank token that Wurth had given him, he could pay his bills on credit. As for the cubic crystals he needed to pay here, he knew that Wurth would handle it for him after he told him about the figure.</p>

  <p>He was not worried because he still had fifty drops of heavenly essence in Wurth's hand, and those were worth much more than several dozens of thousand cubic crystals.</p>
