<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>When light ball No. 9527 realized what had happened, it became extremely excited.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>In what seemed like less than a second, it was on the fly again, heading back to the center of the brain.</p>

  <p>"Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!" "Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!"</p>

  <p>No. 9527 was making noise as it circled the ring of light, injecting its idea into every brain master.</p>

  <p>Reluctantly, the brain masters that had been sleeping finally woke up, some of them complaining as they arose.</p>

  <p>"No. 9527, what in this world are you doing?"</p>

  <p>"Haven't I told you that you guys can't disturb us?"</p>

  <p>"Wait! What's that?"</p>

  <p>A brain master had finally noticed the change in the spiral.</p>

  <p>"Someone's blood has passed the test," No. 9527 said cheerfully. It spun around the ring of light, fast as a bullet. It then proceeded to convey its own consciousness to every brain master.</p>

  <p>All the brain masters stared at the blue spiral together.</p>

  <p>"Is it true?"</p>

  <p>"I thought there was no hope, but..."</p>

  <p>"Whose blood is this?"</p>

  <p>The brain masters in the ring of light were all very excited at this news.</p>

  <p>The brain world, which had been very quiet for many years, was now buzzing with enthusiasm. Countless streams of consciousness flowing through it, it gradually regained its previous vitality.</p>

  <p>"This blood was collected from the sixth rib," No. 9527 said.</p>

  <p>"The sixth rib is occupied by the Nine Li race. Is this person from the Nine Li race too?"</p>

  <p>"Be sure to watch this person!"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely!"</p>

  <p>Unbeknownst to all, down in the underground world, the Chaos Ancient God was having the same thoughts.</p>

  <p>At the entrance of the Cave of Wildness, Giacomo looked down worriedly.</p>

  <p>"What sort of Body Tribulation is Zheng undergoing now?"</p>

  <p>Adele descended on one side and found, looking down, that Zheng was unable to move at all.</p>

  <p>"He has passed the Meridians Breaking Tribulation," said Giacomo after having thought for some time. "Next he will face the Blood Boiling Tribulation."</p>

  <p>"How many shares of blood wild bones have been released?" Adele asked.</p>

  <p>"This is the fifth share," answered Giacomo. "Grand Elder, please don't give him so many blood wild bones this time. After he gets through the Body Tribulations, he can absorb them again and slowly recover."</p>

  <p>Giacomo was worried that Zheng wouldn't pass the Body Tribulations. The more blood wild bones one absorbed during the process, the more severe the pain would be.</p>

  <p>Adele frowned. Admittedly, she also felt a bit worried, especially after having seen Zheng's current state. And yet, she shook her head.</p>

  <p>"It's best to stick to the plan. After all, Zheng is very different from us,"</p>

  <p>Adele said in a reassuring voice.</p>

  <p>On the day after Zheng's blood test, he had secretly communicated with Adele's father and the others.</p>

  <p>Out of sheer curiosity, she had once asked her father what they had talked using her life vitality.</p>

  <p>But her father didn't tell her anything. He had just comforted her, telling her that he would let her know when it was time.</p>

  <p>Adele understood that Zheng's arrival might have caused a change in the Nine Li race. She didn't know what this change was exactly, but she was looking forward to finding out.</p>

  <p>Just then, a muffled sound came from the Cave of Wildness, which was followed by a cloud of mist.</p>

  <p>"It's the Blood Boiling Tribulation."</p>

  <p>The Body Tribulations were composed of five tribulations. Now that Zheng had gone through the Meridians Breaking Tribulation, his meridians had all been torn apart. Next came the fourth tribulation, the Blood Boiling Tribulation.</p>

  <p>All the blood in his body became like boiling water, and it continued boiling.</p>

  <p>The boiling blood flowed out of his wounds and turned into mists, spreading through and out of the Cave of Wildness.</p>

  <p>The muscles on Zheng's face were torn apart, and even the bones in his cheeks were broken. And yet, in spite of the unimaginable pain, his expression betrayed nothing. He lay on the ground like a corpse. No matter how much pain he was in, he showed no emotions.</p>

  <p>But the pain in his soul was worse still.</p>

  <p>Because Zheng's soul was so strong and sensitive, it was excruciating, much worse than the pain in his body.</p>

  <p>'All the ancient gods cultivated in this way. At that time, everyone was tortured in this way, ' Zheng sighed in his mind. The price was too high. If he was not careful enough, his body could collapse, and he would die suffering.</p>

  <p>It was much better to practice the Grand World Cultivation Method.</p>

  <p>There was still a risk, but all of it lay in the cinnabar field, so one wouldn't suffer so much.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>While Zheng's blood was boiling, Giacomo kept injecting streams of Wild God Power into the Cave of Wildness from above the cave.</p>

  <p>From the outside, they couldn't know how much trouble Zheng had encountered. No matter how much pain he was in and how dangerous his situation was, he would have to face it all by himself. This was the terrifying part of the Body Tribulations.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>At this moment, an invisible consciousness crossed a trillion miles and quietly descended into the bone tower.</p>

  <p>This invisible consciousness had come from the depths of the ground, released by one of the brain masters.</p>

  <p>Even though the consciousness of the brain masters was unable to detect anything so far away, they had other methods.</p>

  <p>After the brain master's consciousness had determined the location of the specimen, it slipped inconspicuously into the Cave of Wildness where Zheng lay. A small seed grew from the bone crack on the wall opposite Zheng's still figure. The seed was only about the size of a needle tip, but it began growing prolifically, and soon it had turned into a bean sized plant.</p>

  <p>The bean then split in half, and a small eye appeared in the middle of it.</p>

  <p>"I see him."</p>

  <p>"It's this man."</p>

  <p>"He is most definitely not an exile, and he is very young!"</p>

  <p>In the brain world of the Chaos Ancient God, deep underground, the brain masters watched Zheng through this small eye.</p>

  <p>"He is undergoing the Body Tribulations."</p>

  <p>"All the Wild Gods in this world want to pass the Body Tribulations. But after the third truth was changed, they would be unable to travel to the other shore through body cultivation."</p>

  <p>"How could this guy pass the test?"</p>

  <p>The brain masters were all confused.</p>

  <p>So many talented exiles had come before Zheng, but none of them could pass the test. This young man in front of them was most likely a descendant of the exiles of the Nine Li race. But even if his blood had somehow mutated, he couldn't become better than those exiles.</p>

  <p>And yet, he had done it. Zheng had passed the test. All the brain masters could do was observe him closely, searching for clues and hoping to find the answer.</p>

  <p>"Everyone, listen to me, I have a suggestion," a brain master suddenly said. It had suddenly come up with an idea. These brain masters controlled the thoughts of the Chaos Ancient God, and they were all extremely intelligent. "Whatever the case, he has passed the test. Since he is undergoing the Body Tribulations, we can take this opportunity to pour some blood power into his body. What do you think?"</p>

  <p>When undergoing the Body Tribulations, the warriors would be injected with the Wild God Power, which, in turn, contained the blood. If they succeeded, the Blood Wild Bodies would be activated.</p>

  <p>This was a common practice.</p>

  <p>The Chaos Ancient God knew this better than the exiles.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng's blood was not the same as that of the Chaos Ancient God.</p>
