<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1725 Walking Either Straight Or Sideways </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Nathan instantly cleared all the thunderbolts above his head.</p>

  <p>This feat left the other martial artists dumbstruck.</p>

  <p>It was common knowledge that these kinds of thunderbolts could be obstructed either by a physical attack, or they could be channeled into the earth.</p>

  <p>However, Nathan had used his spear to smash them. This powerful visual was hard to describe and had surpassed the expectations of the many martial artists gathered round the Illusion Spaces.</p>

  <p>However, what they did not know was that Nathan's Law Spear Strike was also capable of dousing even a ball of fire upon contact.</p>

  <p>He had just blocked Luo Zheng's Thunderbolt Annihilations when a gold and grey sword ray zoomed towards him.</p>

  <p>"Humph!"</p>

  <p>There was a trace of disdain on his face.</p>

  <p>Other martial artists might find it difficult to resist Luo Zheng's sword but it didn't pose much of a threat to Nathan.</p>

  <p>This was because there was a flaw in Luo Zheng's attack.</p>

  <p>Tianming had a deep understanding of sword skills, so he was able to catch the flaw in the Chaotic Gods-intimidating Strike and destroy Luo Zheng's sword radiance.</p>

  <p>And Nathan could see the flaw even more clearly with his Comprehension of Truth.</p>

  <p>There was an obvious defect in the golden and grey sword ray. After Nathan took a step forward, he suddenly hurled the long spear in his hand, and a purple light hit the small flaw.</p>

  <p>Pop!</p>

  <p>The two-colored sword ray instantly disintegrated, transforming into sword intent cyclones, which burst out in all directions like a shower of magnificent fireworks.</p>

  <p>After the sword ray dispersed, Nathan's expression turned cold and a wicked smile appeared on the corners of his mouth. He faced Luo Luo Zheng once again. "You think you can defeat me just with this little trick?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled and shook his head.</p>

  <p>Wasn't it a bit too stupid to think that he would be able to defeat Nathan by relying on the Thunderbolt Annihilation and the Chaotic Gods-intimidating Strike?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was only using these methods to observe and gauge his opponent.</p>

  <p>Ever since Nathan had stepped into the board, a puzzling thought had been lingering in Luo Zheng's mind and he was not able to solve it.</p>

  <p>But he had noticed something.</p>

  <p>Nathan's actions looked very casual and unplanned, but it seemed like he was following some sort of rule.</p>

  <p>Upon closer inspection, Luo Luo Zheng discovered that his rule was about maintaining a certain distance.</p>

  <p>Nathan always moved a distance of three feet. No matter where he moved, the final position at which he stopped was the integral multiple of three feet from his original spot.</p>

  <p>If he took a step forward, he would be at a distance of three feet. It would never be two feet and nine inches, or three feet and one inch.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng was unable to achieve what Nathan had, he could see his game plan very well.</p>

  <p>Nathan was following this law strictly.</p>

  <p>However, although Luo Luo Zheng had cracked this code, it did not mean that he could resist Nathan's spear.</p>

  <p>Nathan was in such a sorry state because of the Thunderbolt Annihilation. At this moment, he didn't want to waste time on Luo Luo Zheng anymore.</p>

  <p>With a tap of both his feet, the spear in his hand raced towards Luo Luo Zheng in a straight line.</p>

  <p>"His trajectory is unfaltering!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's gaze flickered slightly and his body suddenly began to float.</p>

  <p>Facing Nathan, he swiftly floated away in a semicircular arc.</p>

  <p>When martial artists took to the air, their movements were erratic. Even when they flew in a straight line, they would sway to a certain degree.</p>

  <p>However, Nathan's flying trajectory was a straight line without any deviation, but upon closer inspection, it did give off a strange vibe.</p>

  <p>Now that Luo Luo Zheng thought about it again, the bizarre look on his face became more and more obvious.</p>

  <p>When he fought with Kurt, Nathan did not make a move. Instead, he used his spear to face Kurt and spun non-stop at the place where he stood.</p>

  <p>Nathan had faced him in the same manner not too long ago. Standing in the same spot, he kept spinning around and around, not initiating the attack.</p>

  <p>The only two times that Nathan took the initiative were when he charged forward in a straight line with his spear. Could it be that he could only travel in a straight line?</p>

  <p>This was quite baffling. A crab could only walk sideways and this fellow could only walk straight. However, Luo Luo Zheng felt that he was getting closer to the truth.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng was zigzagging in the air, Nathan did not use his spear. Could it be because he was unable to lock onto Luo Luo Zheng? Or was it because he needed something to launch his attack?</p>

  <p>To destroy everything with a single spear strike was truly terrifying. In theory, this was also a method of the Law of Causality. One could rely on the heavens' law in order to achieve this.</p>

  <p>Such a powerful technique should come with a powerful restriction.</p>

  <p>But since Nathan was a Godly Genius, the Divine Dao he cultivated should not be a law of the heavens.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng pondered as he zigzagged backwards. Nathan's spear strike was so terrifying that he could not take it head-on. He wondered if Nathan would use his own spear when he moved.</p>

  <p>Soon, Luo Luo Zheng discovered that his conjecture was valid.</p>

  <p>Nathan was able to move either straight or sideways. He really was like a crab.</p>

  <p>When Nathan scuttled sideways rapidly, his spear hurtled towards Luo Luo Zheng, followed by a purple spear light as thick as a finger.</p>

  <p>Right now, Nathan was ready to kill. He wanted to get rid of Luo Luo Zheng as quickly as possible without holding back.</p>

  <p>If his spear light were to hit Luo Luo Zheng, it would be enough to obliterate him.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had already come to a conclusion in his heart as his body spiraled forward once again.</p>

  <p>If he guessed correctly, it should be very difficult for the spear light to change its direction. Even if it did, it could only shift at a very small angle.</p>

  <p>At that exact moment, Nathan had also seen through Luo Zheng's intentions. It was like he got a glimpse into Luo Zheng's mind. A sneer appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>"Childish!" he jeered.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng flew away in an arc, the purple spear light strangely turned in the air at a 90-degree angle and sped straight towards him.</p>

  <p>"What's going on?"</p>

  <p>Then Luo Luo Zheng realized that he had made a mistake.</p>

  <p>The spear light could not turn, but it could change its directions at a 90-degree angle.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng felt this scene look somewhat familiar in his heart. He was having a sense of deja vu? a feeling that he had seen the same scene somewhere before.</p>

  <p>The purple spear light turned 90 degrees and continued to chase him.</p>

  <p>As he retreated, his eyes flashed as he remembered suddenly!</p>

  <p>Back on the Divine Kingdom Continent, when he was undergoing his tribulation, an eye had appeared. The black light released from the eye had moved just like this; it moved in a straight line, without any arc.</p>

  <p>It felt like that black light had the power to destroy the world.</p>

  <p>What was the mysterious connection between the two?</p>

  <p>Regardless of what the connection was, Luo Luo Zheng was well aware that the light was extremely deadly.</p>

  <p>He did not believe Nathan's nonsense, and more than that he was unwilling to be defeated by him.</p>

  <p>But the spear light was a bit faster than him. No matter how much he retreated, the distance between the two continued to shrink. Now it was gaining on him.</p>

  <p>At first, there was still a distance of 100 feet, but after a few seconds, the light quickly closed the gap between them and got dangerously close.</p>

  <p>50 feet.</p>

  <p>40 feet.</p>

  <p>30 feet.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!" Nathan cursed and shook his head slightly. In his mind, Luo Luo Zheng was already doomed to lose.</p>

  <p>He didn't need to emanate a very strong Mu Ning. The Law Spear Strike was enough to completely decimate Luo Luo Zheng, and there was no way he would be able to escape.</p>

  <p>As he retreated swiftly, Luo Luo Zheng took a deep breath and his heart sank.</p>

  <p>Did he really have no way to turn the situation around in his battle with the aggressive Nathan?</p>

  <p>He was determined to not to lose to Nathan.</p>

  <p>Now, he seemed somewhat panicked. However, a glint flashed across his eyes as he thought of something. With a pat, the mini Magnetic Sacred Mountain appeared in his hand. The mountain began to expand the moment it appeared, turning into a thousand-feet-tall edifice that blocked Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if it will work!"</p>

  <p>Nathan sneered and the spear light started drilling into the top of the mountain.</p>

  <p>He hadn't seen the Magnetic Sacred Mountain in Luo Zheng's hand before, and now that he was pretty sure he would win, he did not pay too much attention to the mountain. It was ridiculous to use a mountain to try to stop his Law Spear Strike.</p>

  <p>He was confident that the mountain would collapse in the next moment.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The purple spear light instantly got absorbed into the Magnetic Sacred Mountain.</p>

  <p>But the thing that Nathan had expected did not happen. The purple spear light had only left a small white mark on the Magnetic Sacred Mountain, and even that mark vanished soon.</p>

  <p>He was stunned momentarily before activating his Comprehension of Truth. When he looked at the mountain again, he was more befuddled.</p>

  <p>How come such a large mountain did not have any flaws?</p>

  <p>"I see! This is the Magnetic Sacred Mountain!" Nathan only recognized the mountain now.</p>

  <p>He had once seen such a mountain in the hand of a member of the Ji Clan.</p>

  <p>The five elements in the mountain were complex, as the five different Original Laws were uniformly mixed together. As the five elements were interwoven, they would be able to make up for each other's flaws.</p>

  <p>Nathan's current level of Comprehension of Truth did not enable him to see through the flaw.</p>

  <p>While he was pondering, Luo Luo Zheng had already quietly moved to the top of the mountain peak, overlooking him. There seemed to be an extremely sharp cyan light in Luo Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>It was the magnetic power that Luo Luo Zheng had extracted from the Magnetic Sacred Mountain.</p>
