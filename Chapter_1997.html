<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Leroy stood in the hall of the Purple Cloud Sacred Place, his posture rigid and upright. His stormy gaze scanned the warriors before him, demanding their attention.</p>

  <p>"Our first step would be to isolate the two queens of the Demon Night race," he murmured with conviction.</p>

  <p>"And what should we do following that?" Luo Zheng asked in response.</p>

  <p>"Think about it. What do the queens of Demon Night rely on?" Supreme Lord Leroy shot him the question.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng thought for a moment. "The Pools of Faith."</p>

  <p>Xun, Yao, and Ying, each had the cultivation base of a world lord. Without the Faith Energy, their strength could contest a grand world lord's. However, by dint of the Faith Energy, they possessed the great power to take the life of the Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>Back then, Yao could defeat Xun because the latter's Pool of Faith had been sealed off, rendering it unusable. For that reason alone, there had existed a huge chasm between Xun's strength and Yao's. In the end, Yao had made quick work of the other competent queen.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Leroy nodded, a satisfied smile hanging on his lips. "Yes, if you wish to kill Yao and Ying, you have to demolish their Pools of Faith. That would be the subsequent step."</p>

  <p>These decisive words fell on the ears of the listeners and they were struck dumb. Everyone stared wide-eyed at the Supreme Lord, shocked beyond measure.</p>

  <p>The three thousand Demon Night martial artists in the hall, who had followed along with the group, held similar expressions of disbelief on their faces.</p>

  <p>Demolish the Pools of Faith... It sounded like an outrageous game changer.</p>

  <p>The Pools of Faith were the very foundation of the Demon Night race.</p>

  <p>The queens of the race got replaced as generations came by and went; but as the years rolled on, the three Pools of Faith remained intact— still unchanged and imposing as ever.</p>

  <p>As long as the pools existed within the race, it was akin to having three additional Supreme Lords. It was what made Demon Night sui generis.</p>

  <p>In the entire wide world, no other race had access to such unique resources at hand.</p>

  <p>"Supreme Lord Leroy, we cannot do so!"</p>

  <p>"We can let two queens perish, but we absolutely refuse to see the Pools of Faith destroyed.</p>

  <p>They are the very basis of Demon Night! We cannot exist without them!"</p>

  <p>Following the lead of the grand world lord, Abby, the members of the Demon Night race raised their voices in unison in an attempt to persuade Supreme Lord Leroy to turn his verdict.</p>

  <p>Loraine, Saint Lord of the Purple Cloud Sacred Place, was left aghast as well. A frown marred her features as she contemplated the future of the race. She judged Supreme Lord Leroy's decision to be absolutely preposterous.</p>

  <p>All that she had witnessed today had been rather too strange for her liking. A number of formidable Demon Night warriors had mysteriously shown up, with even a Supreme Lord among them! Now, this Supreme Lord was aiming to destroy the Pools of Faith within the race. She was not sure if she was hallucinating or if the world itself had turned upside down.</p>

  <p>However, Supreme Lord Leroy was resolute, notwithstanding the loud murmurs of protest. His remote gaze swept over everyone as he added,</p>

  <p>"From now on, we don't require three queens to control our race. One is enough for us!"</p>

  <p>The Faith Energy of the entire Demon Night was restricted, so the three queens had shared it among them. If only one Pool of Faith was retained and all Faith Energy went in the hands of one queen alone, it would greatly alter her strength for the better...</p>

  <p>The crowd fell into an abrupt silence as they absorbed the implication of this.</p>

  <p>In fact, Supreme Lord Leroy's words made sense. The Demon Night had three queens, and although their roles were largely separate, they often fought incessantly. Crowning one queen alone would be a step in the right direction.</p>

  <p>"Where are the Pools of Faith?" Luo Zheng asked Supreme Lord Leroy, his pupils shining.</p>

  <p>The Demon Night members, needless to say, knew of the existence of the Pools of Faith. Those who had the ancient bloodline running through their veins were qualified to make use of the power of the pools.</p>

  <p>However, most others were unaware of their exact location.</p>

  <p>"They are located at the Inauguration Altar in the center of the Rosy Cloud World, which is the core supreme world of the Demon Night race.</p>

  <p>Of course, it is bound to be guarded most heavily." Supreme Lord Leroy looked at Luo Zheng grimly before continuing, "We cannot lose time. Yao isn't foolish, and she has resources aplenty at her disposal and will figure out our tactic soon enough!"</p>

  <p>Then, he turned to the others. "I will first move to the Rosy Cloud World with Luo Zheng by means of the Grand Teleportation technique. It is a long distance. You lot can return to the Jade Flute World, where the Saint Spear Sect resides."</p>

  <p>The warriors stared back at him in perplexity as they absorbed his words, suddenly remembering that the Supreme Lord had been absent for some time.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Leroy noticed this and explained bemusedly, "It would take us a long time to get to the Rosy Cloud World. I can't bring all of you there..."</p>

  <p>He wondered if the warriors truly thought they could tag along. It was known that a Supreme Lord could use the Grand Teleportation technique to cross several supreme worlds, but he could only carry two or three people at most with him.</p>

  <p>"Ahem..." Luo Zheng put his fist near his mouth and made a show of coughing, attracting the attention of Supreme Lord Leroy. "We don't need to go through all that trouble."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Supreme Lord Leroy asked doubtfully, narrowing his eyes.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, faint light flashed in Zheng's hand as the Space Law condensed within the Teleportation Token, turning into a streak of incandescent brilliance that spiraled before Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Leroy was flummoxed at this display. He could feel the unfathomable power of space contained within the spinning light, but he was clueless as to what Luo Zheng appeared to want to do. Truthfully, even a Supreme Lord could hardly dare imagine that an unusual entity such as the Teleportation Token existed in the universe.</p>

  <p>In fact, the Teleportation Token was comparable to a Heavenly Destiny.</p>

  <p>"Come with me." Luo Zheng gestured to the Supreme Lord and coolly stepped inside the spinning light, instantly disappearing from everyone's view.</p>

  <p>The other warriors of the Demon Night had already witnessed the miracle of the Teleportation Token previously. They were not so baffled anymore, but Supreme Lord Leroy became more and more curious. With careful steps, he entered a strange space, his body sinking into the inky blank expanse all of a sudden...</p>

  <p>The shock on his face only intensified as he saw the enormous image of the universe beneath his feet.</p>

  <p>"What is this place?"</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Leroy possessed wide knowledge and experience, so upon seeing the view of the supreme worlds, he naturally inquired, "Is it that we can teleport to anywhere through this space?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded with a knowing smile.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Leroy's eyes widened like saucers as he absorbed this piece of information.</p>

  <p>It was the second time that Luo Zheng had shocked him in such a short period of time.</p>

  <p>Because Supreme Lord Leroy had remained underground, he did not receive many opportunities to gather information. He could merely rely on the words uttered through the Roaring Tokens in order to determine the situation of the outer world. In truth, he did not know much about Luo Zheng at all.</p>

  <p>He had deduced that Luo Zheng was capable of looking for him only because of Xun's soul.</p>

  <p>Issuing a queen's decree required the help of her soul, and it was indispensable for the purpose of stepping into the Inauguration Altar.</p>

  <p>As for other matters, Supreme Lord Leroy did not have much hope. He only knew that if they were able to successfully destroy the two Pools of Faith, he would personally kill Yao and Ying.</p>

  <p>Remembering what he had said previously, Supreme Lord Leroy fidgeted a bit, feeling a little awkward and self-conscious. He let out a short burst of laughter. "You have quite a few resources yourself! Always surprising me..."</p>

  <p>This way, Supreme Lord Leroy thought that they would naturally be able to save quite a bit of time...</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded noncommittally, somewhat amused. Amber, Abby, and many other members of the Demon Night too entered the space and headed toward the Rosy Cloud World.</p>

  <p>Not long after, a Space Law appeared in the sky above the northern region of the Rosy Cloud World, creating a crack in the space. The crack acted like a window for a place otherworldly. Luo Zheng was the first to get through it. After all of them stepped in, the crack disappeared.</p>

  <p>The Rosy Cloud World and the Purple Snow World were on completely different levels.</p>

  <p>The Rosy Cloud World was the core supreme world of the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>The coronation ceremony for the queen of the race was held here from time immemorial. Furthermore, this was where the Demon Night race had originated.</p>

  <p>The Rosy Cloud World alone consisted of nine tenth-grade sacred places, as well as a large number of those below the tenth grade. The number of Demon Night members that resided here was several times greater than that in the other supreme worlds.</p>

  <p>It was also rife with lush greenery. Flora flourished in abundance within the sacred places, enfolding the supreme world in its splendor.</p>

  <p>After the queen's decree was issued, it had caused a great commotion in the sacred places.</p>

  <p>The core area of the Rosy Cloud World was naturally no exception to it.</p>

  <p>At present, these sacred places were in chaos and struggling to maintain any semblance of balance.</p>

  <p>A large majority of the Demon Night members chose to support Supreme Lord Leroy and Xun, but there were some in the Rosy Cloud World who were still faithfully on Yao's side. Although Yao had been reckless and foolhardy, the Demon Night followed rigid rules and believed that it was imperative that each of the three queens perform their roles and duties strictly, no matter the cost.</p>

  <p>Now, Supreme Lord Leroy had declared Yao and Ying to be traitors, which they felt was wholly unreasonable.</p>

  <p>The Rosy Cloud World had been in conflict over the matter. The Inauguration Altar saw more and more members of the Demon Night falling to their knees in ardent prayer, beseeching the Gods to help their race overcome this disaster.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Leroy led Luo Zheng and the others as they flew past the sacred places. In normal circumstances, guards from sacred places could be found patrolling the area. However, no one paid attention to the company today. Perhaps the guards noticed but ignored them.</p>

  <p>In the last few days, the faith in the race had collapsed to a staggering degree.</p>

  <p>As soon as Supreme Lord Leroy flew down to the Inauguration Altar, a few members of the race recognized him.</p>
