  <p>
</p>

  <p>As the son of a Holy Being, Luo Luo Zheng could be considered a member of a noble clan.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had heard of the noble clans of the Floating Islands before, but he had never imagined what the real Luo Clan would look like.</p>

  <p>It had never occurred to him that the Floating Island owned by the Luo Clan would be in such a state when he first laid eyes on it.</p>

  <p>How prosperous had this island used to be?</p>

  <p>How many disciples, True Gods and talents had the Luo Clan once had?</p>

  <p>Now though it had been turned to ash. What was once full of life and color was gray and listless.</p>

  <p>Mae was talented when it came to reading other's facial expressions.</p>

  <p>Even a minute change would not escape her notice. Taking in Luo Zheng's expression, she smiled and said, "I forgot that your surname is Luo. Are you a member of this clan?"</p>

  <p>"A member of the Luo Clan?" Luo Luo Zheng was slightly stunned at the question.</p>

  <p>He smiled and shook his head. "Of course not. My surname just also happens to be Luo. It is sad though," he said, turning back to the scenery before him. "Seeing the state of the clan."</p>

  <p>Although the storm in his heart was raging, he did his best to keep it from showing on his face. He needed to be calm.</p>

  <p>The Luo Clan had lost the support of the Holy Beings, and it did not take long for their island to fall into disrepair. The noble clans were eager to draw a line between them and anyone that had something to do with the Luo Clan. If Luo Luo Zheng admitted that he was a member of the clan he would only cause trouble for himself.</p>

  <p>"Of course. If you were a member of the Luo Clan, you would have known what had happened to this Floating Island," Mae said indifferently. There were many divine citizens whose family name was Luo throughout the divine land. Mae had no reason to doubt Luo Zheng's words.</p>

  <p>"What happened on this island? Why would it have ended up like this?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>He was extremely curious as to the answer.</p>

  <p>The only thing Luo Luo Zheng was aware of was that his father had offended the Hall of Holy Beings, and that he had a terrible grudge against Murphy.</p>

  <p>Even knowing that, he still didn't know the true reason.</p>

  <p>"This is the punishment from the Ruling Slate. Mysterious bolts of lightning had attacked the Floating Island. They were enough to completely destroy the entire island," Mae said.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded and asked, "Why would the bolts of lightning attack the Floating Island? What did the Luo Clan do? Who had they offended?"</p>

  <p>The questions just seemed to pour out of him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng wanted to take this opportunity to get more information. That way, he could also eliminate Mae's suspicion of him. After all, he really knew nothing about what happened to the Luo Clan, which worked in his favor.</p>

  <p>Her answer was a disappointment though.</p>

  <p>"This was a fight between the Holy Beings, True Gods would not be privy to that information." Mae shook her head. It was believed that Mike had betrayed the Hall of Holy Beings in the past, and no one knew his motivation for doing so. It had been buried and hidden like a dirty secret.</p>

  <p>After so many years, the Luo Clan had almost been forgotten by many of the True Gods. This island seemed to be the last thing left that might have been able to trigger some people's memories of that time.</p>

  <p>Before long the Floating Island would fall into the Time Sea. When that happened, the last trace of the Luo Clan would vanish.</p>

  <p>Seeing as Mae didn't have the answer he needed, Luo Luo Zheng didn't ask any further questions.</p>

  <p>As they rose higher and higher upon the disc, Luo Luo Zheng was able to see more and more of the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>He could see those of the Gongsun Clan, the Yang Clan, and the Xue Clan.</p>

  <p>Floating Islands appeared one after another, all of them connected to form a spiral. The spiral disappeared into the horizon as if they were steps leading to a tower in the sky.</p>

  <p>The geography and scenery of each island was different. Some were covered in lush, green trees while others were occupied by exquisite and luxurious buildings. There was even a massive, sparkling blue lake on an island.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng continued to rise, there were many similar discs zipping past him and Mae. They seemed to be a form of transportation between the islands. Most of those using the discs were True Gods, but some were proving godly warriors although there were very few.</p>

  <p>"Hahaha..."</p>

  <p>A hearty, bellowing laugh caught Luo Zheng's attention, his ears hurting slightly at the booming voice. Someone seemed to be enjoying themselves as if no one was around.</p>

  <p>There was a disc not too far away moving in the same direction as the one Luo Luo Zheng was on.</p>

  <p>A group of young True Gods stood gathered on the disc, laughing and talking. There were seven warriors in total, and as Luo Luo Zheng looked harder he was able to see that they were low-rank True Gods. They must have just condensed their Godly Tiles a few years ago.</p>

  <p>"Eh?"</p>

  <p>The confused sound reached Luo Zheng's ears, and the one that had made the sound looked directly at him. They were only a hundred feet from each other now.</p>

  <p>Their eyes met almost immediately.</p>

  <p>"Quentin," Luo Luo Zheng whispered. Luo Luo Zheng was astonished, his heart skipping a beat.</p>

  <p>When they had been in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, in order to help Lucille and others get a place to cultivate the Pristine Life Vitality, Luo Luo Zheng had fought Quentin. Quentin, like Han Liusu, was a disciple on the Floating Island of a noble clan. He had not expected to see him here!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng assumed that Quentin wouldn't recognize him. His appearance had changed since he had last seen Quentin, so he hoped that was enough.</p>

  <p>The issue was though, that in order to beat Luo Luo Zheng during their fight, Quentin had used Wishing Spell.</p>

  <p>According to the rules of the Wishing Spell, as long as Quentin didn't kill Luo Luo Zheng, his cultivation would never improve.</p>

  <p>Another issue was that after casting the Wishing Spell, Quentin would be able to sense it if his target was within range. Quentin continued to stare at Luo Luo Zheng from afar in mild confusion.</p>

  <p>"Quentin, what are you looking at?" a low-rank True God beside him asked.</p>

  <p>Quentin stared a little harder at Luo Luo Zheng and answered, "Nothing..."</p>

  <p>"Do you know that guy?" another warrior close to him asked.</p>

  <p>"No," Quentin mumbled, shaking his head. "I just had a strange feeling."</p>

  <p>"Hahaha, maybe you are just oversensitive right now. Your body just finished recovering, and you still need rest. Don't think too much on it," another said.</p>

  <p>Mae glanced between Luo Luo Zheng and the other disc. "Is he an old friend of yours?" she asked quietly.</p>

  <p>"He's not familiar to me at all, no," Luo Luo Zheng quickly stated. "It's strange that he keeps staring at me, though."</p>

  <p>"That is the young master of the Qin Clan. Rumor has it that he was injured during a battle in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land," Mae said in a low voice. "He stupidly used the Wishing Spell, and the man who defeated him escaped and disappeared. It was some secondary creature in some random universe. Not even the Holy Beings of the Qin Clan can find him."</p>

  <p>"Since he is the young master of the Qin Clan that has been to the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, he should be proving godly warrior at that time, right? How did he become a True God from a world lord if he was unable to fulfill the wish he made with the spell?" Luo Luo Zheng asked, perplexed.</p>

  <p>He knew the consequences of not fulfilling the wish one made when casting the Wishing Spell. If the wish was not fulfilled, the caster's cultivation would be restricted permanently.</p>

  <p>It was beyond him that Quentin had managed to get around such a restriction.</p>

  <p>Back then, both Luo Luo Zheng and Quentin had been at the same level of cultivation. Now, not only had Quentin broken the restriction of the Wishing Spell, but he had also become a low-rank True God. Luo Luo Zheng was lagging behind.</p>

  <p>"No one is supposed to be able to get around the restriction of the Wishing Spell. Quentin should feel lucky that he is an important figure in the Qin Clan. The Holy Emperor of the Qin Clan personally helped him to stop the restriction for the time being. However, it is only temporary.</p>

  <p>If he wants to remove the restriction, he still has to find that secondary creature and kill him," Mae explained.</p>

  <p>The power of the Han Clan and Qin Clan was nearly equal. The two clans competed with each other from time to time. Mae was very familiar with all the happenings in the Qin Clan, and could talk about it with great familiarity.</p>

  <p>"He lost to a secondary creature. It seems that it would be difficult to find the person," Luo Luo Zheng echoed. A strange feeling began to settle in his chest. He wondered what Mae would think if she knew that the secondary creature that Quentin was searching for was him.</p>

  <p>"Of course he can't find him," Mae replied with a smile.</p>

  <p>Since the restriction of the Wishing Spell was blocked by the Holy Emperor of the Qin Clan, Quentin's ability to identify Luo Luo Zheng was weakened. It was why Quentin had only felt slightly strange when meeting his gaze.</p>

  <p>What a strange set of circumstances. If the Holy Emperor hadn't interfered, Quentin would have recognized Luo Luo Zheng right away. No matter how much Luo Zheng's outer appearance had changed, it wouldn't change the fact the magic of the Wishing Spell would recognize its target.</p>

  <p>Although Quentin had become a True God with the aid of the Holy Emperor, he gave up the one thing that would have helped him fulfill his wish. It was unfortunate for Quentin, as this would have been the perfect opportunity for him.</p>

  <p>The small disc that carried Quentin and the others suddenly changed direction, and headed towards a massive Floating Island off in the distance. It was owned by the Qin Clan, which happened to be ranked eleventh in the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>As they floated away, Quentin couldn't stop himself as he looked over his shoulder to look at Luo Luo Zheng again. He couldn't shake the feeling that something important was right in front of him.</p>

  <p>The Floating Island of the Han Clan was ranked tenth in the Time Sea, so it was higher than that of the Qin Clan.</p>

  <p>They only rose for a short moment when the vast island of the Han Clan finally appeared before him.</p>

  <p>Each clan's Floating Island had a style all their own. Some had a style that was a little more wild while others liked to have a more delicate look. The Han Clan liked their island to be delicate. It was inlaid with white jade, making the entire island look incredibly elegant.</p>
