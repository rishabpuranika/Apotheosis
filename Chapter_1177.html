<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Every time the Lotus Flower trembled, a new petal would grow. As it trembled again, they anxiously waited to see another petal bloom.</p>

  <p>Derek's words had discouraged the powerful warriors of the Soul Sea Realm from hoping that Luo Zheng could work wonders and impress the humans from the Upper World. The sight of the flower trembling again instantly drew everyone's attention.</p>

  <p>Derek said that there might not be even one warrior in a supreme world that could make the nine-petal Lotus Flower fully blossom. Such a warrior would definitely attract the attention of the Upper World.</p>

  <p>As for the ascending passageway, no matter how much they would have to pay, it had to be repaired.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Derek's face became extremely serious. His eyes became sharp like lightning and he was firmly staring at the trembling Lotus Flower.</p>

  <p>He knew more about the Lotus Flower and the meaning of the bloom of its nine petals than any of the warriors at the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>Martial artists could cultivate martial arts complying with the laws of nature. They could absorb the rules of nature. In order to achieve this, they would have to go step by step, from the inferior laws to Original Laws, and to superior laws, which included the Law of Causality.</p>

  <p>However, cultivators who practiced martial arts by abiding to the natural laws would eventually encounter a huge bottleneck. They would not be able to escape the cycle of reincarnation, nor would they be able to escape the shackles of the Heavenly Law.</p>

  <p>Only the martial artists that defied the laws of nature could go beyond the Heavenly Law and obtain higher achievements.</p>

  <p>Not all the warriors could go beyond the Heavenly Law. Only a warrior that could activate the Nine-petal Lotus Flower into full bloom would have the potential to go beyond the Heavenly Law and be considered a talent in the Upper World.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the definition of talent was different across worlds.</p>

  <p>Being talented in the Lower World meant having special abilities. The people who had special gifts in certain aspects were considered talented.</p>

  <p>However, in the Upper World, being talented referred to creatures that could go beyond the Heavenly Law.</p>

  <p>A martial artist who had the ability to activate a Nine-petal Lotus Flower meant he had the full potential of going beyond the Heavenly Law. In any race or force, such a figure would be greatly valued.</p>

  <p>Compared to the Nine-petal Lotus Flower, the baptism by laws was not as impressive. Although Derek had been surprised when he found Luo Zheng was able to comprehend Fiona's Time Law in a short period of time, it only caught his attention but not his admiration. It was far from the shock that the Nine-petal Lotus Flower brought to him now.</p>

  <p>From what Derek had told them, the group of Soul Sea Realm masters had come to understand that the appearance of a Nine-petal Lotus Flower signified something extraordinary and that even in a supreme world, not anyone could make it show.</p>

  <p>The problem was that this group of Soul Sea Realm masters had never been to the Upper World, and they didn't have any notion about a supreme world, much less one hundred thousand supreme worlds. It was like a person from the capital city telling a person from a remote village how big and how rich the capital was. However, the person from the remote village only had a general picture in his mind about what the capital city was like. Even if those Soul Sea Realm masters racked their brains, they still failed to fathom how vast a supreme world was, and it was more difficult for them to know exactly how rare a Nine-petal Lotus Flower was.</p>

  <p>They actually didn't care about the vastness of a supreme world. All they knew was that once the Nine-petal Lotus Flower blossomed completely, the ascending passageway would be repaired. That was all they needed to know.</p>

  <p>The Nine-petal Lotus Flower continued to tremble slowly. Luo Zheng continued to stare at it in silence, secretly hoping that the petals would all spread out. However, the cyan dragon had already told him that the number of petals that would spread out from the Lotus Flower was not something he could decide.</p>

  <p>The amount of petals would match a person's achievement in exploration of a supreme world and was often a forecast to a martial artist's fate.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't know much about the supreme worlds, the world lords or the strength of the Supreme Lords. However, he was fully aware of the strength of that young man who had appeared in the Ethereal Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>That person's strength might even surpass the strength of the Supreme Lords. He and Yan had only been together for a short period of time. Yet, in the end, Yan was taken away by that young man. If he wanted to see Yan again, he knew he had to at least become as strong as that young man was.</p>

  <p>Even if he activated the Nine-petal Lotus Flower, it did not mean that he would be able to reach the heights he expected.</p>

  <p>Under Zheng's attentive gaze, the Lotus Flower continued to tremble. One of the last two petals of the Lotus Flower finally started to slowly spread out.</p>

  <p>"It's open, it's fully open! After so many years of hardship, It seems like we will finally see the light at the end of the tunnel."</p>

  <p>"The eighth leaf has finally grown! There's no need to look for other ways to ascend to the Upper World anymore. We will finally be able to do it in a dignified way!"</p>

  <p>Hearing this, one of the powerful warriors at the Soul Sea Realm even had tears in his eyes and was about to start crying.</p>

  <p>In order to make a breakthrough in the Soul Sea Realm and ascend to the Upper World, this group of Soul Sea Realm masters, who had lived for thousands of years, had done everything they could to achieve their goals.</p>

  <p>They had gone overseas to seek for the right opportunities and risked their lives to reach the frontier of the great world. They wanted to cross through and enter another great world so that they could ascend to the Upper World.</p>

  <p>They had been to the depths of the sea to hunt vicious beasts hoping that they would find a special method from them so that they could break through.</p>

  <p>They had spent too much time in all these past years. Their goal was to become stronger, and to ascend to the Upper World.</p>

  <p>Even the powerful warriors at the Soul Sea Realm were not invincible in a supreme world. While they were out searching for these right opportunities, many of them had died. They paid the price of their lives, and, in the end, all of them died with grievances.</p>

  <p>Today was the day that their deaths gained meaning. Now, they would be able to complete their lifelong dream of repairing the ascending passageway.</p>

  <p>However, these people never imagined that in the Sky Northern Region, which was also the Central Region and a barren land in their eyes, a Dragon Soar Arena had appeared three years ago. This Dragon Soar Arena belonged to the Dragon Lineage Human of the Feather Holy Sea.</p>

  <p>With the help of the Dragon Soar Arena, they would have been able to ascend to the Upper World.</p>

  <p>The Dragon Soar Arena would send them to the Genuine Dragon World in the Upper World, and they would be imprisoned for a thousand years.</p>

  <p>A thousand years was certainly a long time, but it meant nothing to a mighty warrior at the Soul Sea Realm who had long lifespans. Using a thousand years of their lives in exchange for the chance to reach the Upper World would definite be a good deal.</p>

  <p>As the Lotus Flower continuously trembled, the eighth petal had finally completely grown.</p>

  <p>Afterwards, the ninth petal also slowly started to grow under the crowd's attentive gaze.</p>

  <p>All the nine petals had finally grown and now the fully-bloomed Lotus Flower began to slowly rotate in the air above.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled as he admired the beautiful Lotus Flower. Although it had been hard for him to advance to the Life and Death Realm and the process was full of twists and turns, the result was satisfying.</p>

  <p>Everyone also understood that everything was settled. In unison they let out a sigh of relief as joy filled their hearts.</p>

  <p>Just when everyone thought it was over, the Lotus Flower began trembling again.</p>

  <p>"What is happening?" Luo Zheng asked with a confused gaze staring at the Lotus Flower. If all the nine petals had grown and the flower had fully bloomed, then why was the Lotus Flower still trembling?</p>

  <p>"Master Derek, what's going on?" a powerful warrior at the Soul Sea Realm asked.</p>

  <p>Derek didn't know what to say. The nine petals had fully grown and the Lotus Flower now had the perfect form. But it continued trembling as if something was trying to escape from it.</p>

  <p>For a moment, Derek couldn't figure out what was happening. He was baffled and puzzled with what was unfolding in front of him.</p>

  <p>Looking at the Lotus Flower, Marine gently bit her lip, trying to search through the information she had got from the ancient documents in her mind.</p>

  <p>The secret sect had a long history. It was said that the inheritances of the secret sect could be traced back to the last era, which meant that secret sect already existed before many of the creatures were born in this era.</p>

  <p>The end of an era also meant the destruction of a heaven. However, in this universe, there would always be some powerful ones who could pass on the inheritances. Some inheritances could transcend time and even the Heavenly Law.</p>

  <p>Therefore, although Marine was not as knowledgeable as Derek, as a Holy Maiden of the secret sect, she had access to information that not even Derek was able to reach.</p>

  <p>The Lotus Flower had nine petals and the person who could open up all the nine petals had a great fortune bestowed on himself by the precious Lotus Flower.</p>

  <p>However, this was only the first level. The first level was the Hinayana Lotus Flower. If one could break through the heavenly barrier, one could enter the Mahayana realm, which was the second level.</p>

  <p>Thinking of this, Marine's heart suddenly started to beat faster and she blurted out, "Master Derek, is Luo Zheng about to open the second level? The Mahayana Lotus Flower?"</p>

  <p>She wasn't sure herself, so she could only ask Derek.</p>
