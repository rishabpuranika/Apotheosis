  <p>The piety of the Demon Night in their faith was something Luo Luo Zheng was well aware of. To the entire Demon Night, their only faith consisted of the three queens, Xun, Yao, and the last queen.</p>

  <p>Regardless of whether it was in the Upper World or Lower World, in any sacred place of the Demon Night race, their faith remained the same.</p>

  <p>Such a thing couldn't easily be changed in a person, after all.</p>

  <p>The moment the members of the Demon Night were born, they underwent the baptism of the queens' statues, engraving their fealty into their bones. The Luster Force Secret Sect recruited a few of the Demon Night race members into their sect most likely because they had some special means to make the latter obey.</p>

  <p>Seeing Luo Zheng's solemn expression, the white-robed martial artist's smile slowly faded. "Do you need me to spell it out?"</p>

  <p>"It seems as though I can't refuse?" Luo Luo Zheng suddenly commented with a smile.</p>

  <p>The other man seemed pleased upon hearing this as he said, "You're a smart boy. I believe you can become a good believer. The gods will definitely protect? "</p>

  <p>"No, I won't join you," Before the man could finish his statement, Luo Luo Zheng interjected.</p>

  <p>The man's expression froze and his gaze upon Luo Luo Zheng turned cold. "Do you know what it means to refuse?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know." A faint smile surfaced on Luo Zheng's face. "But I don't want to waste time creating a sword embryo for some Supreme Lord."</p>

  <p>It was no secret that the Luster Force Secret Sect was making a sword embryo. Only the highest of figures in the Upper World were made aware of it, but in the name of 'god, ' the Luster Force Secret Sect still managed to gather a remarkable number of believers. In the eyes of many, after all, a Supreme Lord was hardly different from a god.</p>

  <p>With that, Luo Zheng's straightforward words were deemed blasphemous. The face of the white-robed martial artist darkened as the corners of his mouth curled up into an icy smile. With a gentle wave of his hand, he triggered several rays of light to shoot out from the upper floor of the shrine? several warriors clad in golden armor could be seen in each ray.</p>

  <p>"Capture the man who slandered our god. We're going to burn him to death with hellfire." With that, the white-robed martial artist commanded the warriors to seize Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng seemed rather down? they had merely stepped inside to take a look around, but escaping turned out to be such an ordeal. What kind of damned place was this?</p>

  <p>In a flash of green light, the five-foot-long sword appeared in his hand.</p>

  <p>Then, Nether God Shadows shot out from the sword edge, rushing toward the golden-armored warriors from all directions.</p>

  <p>The golden-armored warriors stood only at the Life and Death Realm, and their strength seemed ordinary.</p>

  <p>With the Nether God Shadows' strength, Luo Luo Zheng had no trouble dealing with a warrior who had just entered the Soul Sea Realm. As for the Life and Death Realm martial artists, the Nether God Shadows were enough to finish them off.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng felt no hatred for them. He had only just entered the Auspice City? it would be dishonorable to randomly take an innocent's life. But he needed to subdue them.</p>

  <p>Much to Luo Zheng's surprise, beams of light green light emitted from the body of the warriors and they seemed to block all the attacks from the Nether God Shadows? they were left completely unharmed.</p>

  <p>"What's going on?" The surprise was evident on his face, but he didn't hesitate in the slightest. Realizing that they shouldn't linger there any longer. He grabbed Freya and dragged her away. "Let's go!"</p>

  <p>"You won't be able to escape," the white-robed man warned coldly.</p>

  <p>Several of the golden-armored warriors rushed to surround Luo Luo Zheng where he stood? over a hundred Life and Death Realm martial artists were mobilized.</p>

  <p>But as he watched the warriors charge toward him, Luo Luo Zheng merely sneered.</p>

  <p>In a casual swing of the long sword in his hand, an arc-shaped beam of light spread out.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>With one strike, Luo Luo Zheng managed to knock down a huge group of warriors.</p>

  <p>Still, the green light emanating from their bodies seemed to protect them effectively against his sword light.</p>

  <p>Could the green light really be that strong?</p>

  <p>The warriors who had been knocked down simply got up once again and rushed toward him like it was nothing. Meanwhile, a chilling light flickered in Freya's body? she had to deal with the pincer attack coming from the many golden-armored warriors.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>Even after Luo Luo Zheng knocked them out again, they seemed to have the endurance of a cockroach? they couldn't be killed.</p>

  <p>At this moment, four particularly nimble golden-armored warriors approached Luo Luo Zheng. Two of them locked onto his arms while the other two grabbed his legs.</p>

  <p>Locked in the dogfight, Luo Luo Zheng grew terribly impatient? killing intent seemed to grow in his pupils.</p>

  <p>"Get Away!"</p>

  <p>As the power of the dragon scales surged forth, his body trembled as he sent the four warriors flying.</p>

  <p>The powerful force penetrated right through the green light, shattering the warriors' guts, the impact enough to make them spit blood.</p>

  <p>Initially, Luo Luo Zheng only planned to intimidate the warriors. Never would he have thought that the other warriors wouldn't get the signal? they continued flocking over with fervent gazes. The group came like a golden ocean, designed specifically to drown Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Such fellows seemed to have lost their minds? fear of death did not exist within them.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Luo Luo Zheng confirmed that he couldn't stay there any longer.</p>

  <p>As he thought it, he showed no mercy as the power in his body soared once again. Like a raging bull, he raced away. Waves of air currents seemed to gush out from his body, blasting away all the golden-armored warriors who dared to approach Luo Zheng's body. As for Freya, her figure seemed to flash as she followed closely behind Luo Luo Zheng, dashing all the way out of the shrine.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Luo Zheng finally stepped out the shrine's entrance, surprise flashed in him. All the warriors seemed to stop mid-motion, having no intent to chase him any further. Instead, they froze and stared blankly at Luo Luo Zheng. The whole scene left a strange taste in Luo Zheng's mouth. It seemed as though the warriors could fight only within the shrine.</p>

  <p>The white-robed martial artist strode to the front of the shrine. Wearing a courteous smile he said, "Join our Luster Force Secret Sect and you won't regret it. You can make a decision now, while it's not too late."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng only smiled and shrugged in response. "All I'm sure about is how much I don't want to join you. I won't regret it? you will."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" the man asked curiously.</p>

  <p>With that, Luo Luo Zheng only shrugged in return and left the area with Freya.</p>

  <p>Those secret sects didn't dare go overboard in the Auspice City. After taking Freya out of the shrine, the others didn't follow.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng wouldn't let the matter end so easily.</p>

  <p>In the evening, Luo Luo Zheng brought Freya back to an area beside the shrine.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing back here?" she asked, puzzled. The golden-armored warriors seemed to leave a rather deep impression on her? they were like puppets as they went all out in their attacks, not seeming to have a lick of concern for their own lives. Given the scene earlier, she assumed they had slave seals or had been controlled by some other special means. Anyway, she had no intention of joining the secret sect and turning into a puppet.</p>

  <p>"There's a little guy who is hungry," was all Luo Luo Zheng said in return.</p>

  <p>Freya seemed puzzled until she saw him pull out the small Ancestral Dragon from his spirit beast bag.</p>

  <p>The little dragon made some gurgling noises before tilting his head toward the shrine. It was clear that he had smelt food? he began struggling, trying to free himself from Luo Zheng's grip.</p>

  <p>"This... What is this?" Freya asked, still puzzled.</p>

  <p>It was no surprise that she didn't know what the animal was? the dragon was still too young and looked nothing like a Genuine Dragon.</p>

  <p>Without answering her question, he said to the dragon, "Go! But you must be careful."</p>

  <p>With that, he released his grip on the creature and the dragon sank into the ground in an instant, disappearing from their view.</p>

  <p>Because Luo Luo Zheng didn't answer, Freya decided not to ask any further? it was Luo Luo Zheng who did so, and he must have had his reasons.</p>

  <p>Inside the massive square inside the shrine, every believer was busy mumbling to themselves as they fell prostrate on the surface, offering their Faith Energy.</p>

  <p>What they had yet to realize was that the tiny Ancestral Dragon was rapidly moving underground, approaching the center of the square.</p>

  <p>When it felt its 'food' above it, it changed course and carefully slithered into the stone pillar above its head. The pillar was just the one holding up the sphere.</p>
