  <p>Shaking his head at the threatening interrogation by the leader of the ogres, his expression visibly darkened. "You do not need to know where I come from," he spat out venomously.</p>

  <p>Chuckling arrogantly, the ogre peered at him with condescending eyes before speaking once more, "I am not interested to know where you come from since you are not from the Purple Heart Sacred Place." Pointing a stubby finger towards him while the other ogres sniggered behind him, the ogre continued, "I will care no more about who you are! A puny seventh level war fighter like you dared to come to my territory and killed my people. You shall regret facing me and looking for death!"</p>

  <p>After the leader of the army finished his spiel, he then promptly raised his arm and waved his hand as a command for the others to start attacking him.</p>

  <p>Within a short moment, the ground rumbled as if an earthquake passed by due to the thousands of ogres descending upon Luo Luo Zheng hurriedly.</p>

  <p>Briefly thinking back on what the ogre had called him, he quickly became angry at being titled a seventh level war fighter more than anything.</p>

  <p>The face of Luo Luo Zheng slightly hardened and there was a visible tick on his eyebrow from irritation. While the ogre talked, Luo Luo Zheng realized that perhaps he called him the seventh level war fighter because he was at the seventh level of the Illuminating Soul Realm. 'Maybe this continent has marginally different terms for the realms, ' he hummed as he mused at the words of the head of the troop. It could also have been possible that only the ogres called realms this way.</p>

  <p>Facing the ogres who viciously stomped towards him, he inaudibly inhaled and exhaled before preparing himself. The ogres were terribly wrong if they had assumed that Luo Luo Zheng would retreat upon seeing their sheer number.</p>

  <p>Instead, he smirked to himself slightly before steadily walking forward.</p>

  <p>Cracking his knuckles and stretching his neck from side to side, he grinned at the fact that it was fortunate that they did not know who Luo Luo Zheng was--they also did not know what was coming for them. Just then, a soul at the Fighting Soul Realm emitted an extremely strong destructive power that made the field rumble. The source of it was Luo Luo Zheng who had used his soul to crush the souls of his opponents, something that was easier for him to do than using his cultivation to defeat his enemies.</p>

  <p>All of the ogres who had been savagely advancing towards him trembled and their eyes rolled towards the back of their head. The stallions whinnied in fright before taking off confusedly amidst the chaos as the ogres riding them fell of their saddles and crashed onto the ground.</p>

  <p>From the beginning of the attack until the end, Luo Luo Zheng did not even feel the need to raise his hands even once. The man who had radiated such an immense amount of power just silently walked in the middle of the staggering troops that consisted of thousands of infuriated ogres.</p>

  <p>A rogue ogre that emerged from the crowd suddenly waved his wolf fang hammer and stormed towards Luo Luo Zheng. Even though Luo Luo Zheng had caught on his presence and instantly killed his soul, the brawny ogre still managed to swing his hammer at Luo Luo Zheng before collapsing himself.</p>

  <p>"Bam!" a loud sound echoed throughout the field as the hammer made contact.</p>

  <p>The man was sent flying by the wolf fang hammer over the heads of the ogres and landed on the ground with a faint thud. Although he could have been seriously harmed by such an offensive attack, Luo Luo Zheng merely brushed off the stray grass on his pants before getting up from the ground unharmed.</p>

  <p>Similar to Death going for a stroll in the middle of a catastrophic event, he determinedly continued to slowly walk forward.</p>

  <p>Gasping aloud, the humans recoiling from behind Luo Luo Zheng all covered their mouths with their hands full of shock. Never before had they seen someone so extraordinary and powerful that could withstand such an upfront attack and survive like nothing had happened. With tears flowing to his cheeks, Craig clasped his hands together and preached, "God, he is the God!"</p>

  <p>Just like human beings, it was an undeniable fact that ogres were also living creatures. As such, it was the inherent instinct of all living beings that cohabitated this world to dread the act of dying. Although the ogres embodied the reputation of being fearsome, valiant, and fierce, it would be idiotic of them to be unafraid of death itself.</p>

  <p>Upon witnessing all of their fellow ogres that approached the nonchalant man all perish in the exact same strange way, they all became hesitant in moving forward. Moreover, who would dare rush over after seeing the power the man held right before their eyes? With the abrupt and horrifying realization, the ogres reined in their horses and frantically moved to the sides to avoid Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The ogre army all sported looks of panic as the man passed by, silently daring anyone to block his way and suffer the same fate of the ogres who had perished before. It was a dramatic sight indeed, as the once formidable army charging towards the man like a raging torrent was now split apart by Luo Zheng's force alone, as if a powerful wave separated them into two sides.</p>

  <p>Arriving at his destination, right in front of Luo Luo Zheng stood the towering golden-armored ogre leader. Looking at him with a half-lidded gaze and a lazy grin, Luo Luo Zheng was definitely sure he was like the others who had underestimated him and talked trash before fighting him themselves.</p>

  <p>The ogre was the governor of this army and in his eyes, Luo Zheng's cultivation base was at a pathetically low level that would not withstand the brunt of their attacks. With a shiver running up his spine, he suddenly came upon the knowledge that Luo Luo Zheng was attacking with his soul instead of his cultivation unlike what they had expected of a warrior.</p>

  <p>The ogre leader hesitated for a moment and glanced at his petrified squad before taking matters into his own hands and rushing towards Luo Luo Zheng ferociously. As their leader, he should be able to show bravery as an example to his doubtful army? he was labelled the strongest one out of all of them for something after all.</p>

  <p>Gritting his teeth, he was well aware of the fact that ogres did not specialize in soul attacks and enduring the power from it. In this chaotic and complex continent, every race had to strengthen themselves to make up for their shortcomings and the skills that they lacked to ward off others. What Luo Luo Zheng did not know was the fact that the ogre governor had a secret weapon that could resist soul attacks.</p>

  <p>'As long as his soul attacks are useless on me, he will be at my mercy!' the ogre sadistically thought to himself as his eyes darkened with purpose. It was the only thought running through the mind of the governor when he yelled a battle cry and rushed towards Luo Luo Zheng.</p>
