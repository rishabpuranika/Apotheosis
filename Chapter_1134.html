<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1134 Pushing The Magnetic Stone </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>At this moment, everyone was convinced that Callan did have something to help them pass through the area. The magnetic stone was virtually useless, save for its incredible toughness. Even a mighty Soul Sea Realm warrior wouldn't be able to break it.</p>

  <p>The princes were all taken aback by this discovery. Why in the world would Callan carry such a useless and heavy object with him?</p>

  <p>Callan sneered at their speechless faces, "Do you believe me now?"</p>

  <p>His sister also had a smile on her kind face. "Follow us if you want to pass through the Slow Arrow Area," Fiona said.</p>

  <p>Fredric smiled helplessly, "Fine, you win. You already amazed me by carrying such a heavy thing with you."</p>

  <p>Callan nodded happily at his words. Using his life vitality, Callan took a deep breath and lifted the magnetic stone. It was as tall as two people combined and it was so heavy that even Callan's sturdy body felt strained carrying it.</p>

  <p>Fiona noticed how red her brother's face had gone so she reached out with a hand and let out a turbulent force from her jade bracelet. The little help was all Callan needed to ease the strain and continue on with carrying the magnetic stone.</p>

  <p>With the siblings' combined efforts, they were able to carry the magnetic stone and lead the way.</p>

  <p>The other warriors closely followed behind with Fiona and Callan at the helm. This could be their only chance to enter the Feather Emperor Secret Land and they were not going to let this opportunity pass.</p>

  <p>Randy nudged Zheng's side with a smile, "Come on! Let's also follow!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng rolled his eyes but humored the lord with a nod.</p>

  <p>A long line formed behind the magnetic stone which acted as a shield against the densely packed wall of arrows that were now on their way to them.</p>

  <p>The magnetic stone was impenetrable and impossibly hard but there were still a few whose stomachs lurched at the sight of the approaching arrow wall. If the magnetic stone wasn't able to block the arrows, then they would be in trouble�</p>

  <p>"Clank!"</p>

  <p>They couldn't really see what was happening beyond their magnetic stone shield but they could hear the clear clinking sound of the first arrow bouncing off it.</p>

  <p>More and more sounds rang out.</p>

  <p>"Clank! Clank! Clank! Clank! Clank!"</p>

  <p>It went on for a while until Callan's and Fiona's faces turned scarlet from all the effort of carrying the stone. It was apparent that they wouldn't be able to hold out for much longer.</p>

  <p>"These arrows are powerful! Help!" Callan shouted.</p>

  <p>The arrows were not flying at their original speed. They were slowed down but only because of the Time Law.</p>

  <p>However, the arrows were still at full strength upon hitting the magnetic stone. Even Fiona was finding it difficult to withstand the onslaught despite she had utilized the power of the semi-divine weapon, a jade bracelet on her wrist.</p>

  <p>Hearing Callan's cry for help, Luo Zheng immediately zoomed past the other warriors and held the magnetic stone with his hands.</p>

  <p>His arrival immediately brought relief upon the siblings. It seemed Luo Zheng was actually able to withstand ninety percent of the blow as he pushed the stone forward.</p>

  <p>"Thank you!" Fiona told Luo Zheng with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Actually, we should thank the two of you," Luo Zheng said. "If not for this magnetic stone, nobody would've even been able to walk through."</p>

  <p>Of course, there was a bit of exaggeration in Zheng's words. Although it would be difficult to pass through the Slow Arrow Area, those who had cultivated the Space Law wouldn't have any problems. Luo Zheng, for example, could simply avoid the arrows by travelling through space.</p>

  <p>However, not many warriors had comprehended Space Law and those who did would find it difficult to abandon their companions. The exploration of the Feather Holy Sea was a team effort after all.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the magnetic stone proved itself to be incredibly helpful in their passage through the area.</p>

  <p>With Luo Zheng joining Fiona and Callan at the helm, the warriors all resumed their passage.</p>

  <p>Just as everyone had thought the worst was over, a voice suddenly shouted, "Ah! There are arrows coming from the left! The left!"</p>

  <p>Everyone's eyes whipped towards their left and, true enough, a barrage of arrows were on their way to rain down upon them.</p>

  <p>"There are a lot from the right as well!" another warrior screamed.</p>

  <p>The situation was now grim and everyone felt panic surge through their veins.</p>

  <p>"Damn!" Randy cursed. "Why is it so difficult to enter the Feather Emperor Secret Land?"</p>

  <p>The arrows now flanked them left, right, and center. There was nowhere to run from an attack of this magnitude.</p>

  <p>Even Luo Zheng wouldn't be able to pass through this obstacle unscathed.</p>

  <p>The only one that could probably get through this unharmed would probably be Logan who had mastered the third level of Space Law. He could use his ability to travel through the void and avoid the arrows but that would mean leaving behind his teammates.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng frowned at their predicament. "Follow me!" he shouted, crossing his palms and slamming them heavily onto the magnetic stone.</p>

  <p>"Bam!"</p>

  <p>With a dull thud, the magnetic stone shot forward. The force allowed Luo Zheng to push the magnetic stone fifty to sixty feet forward.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng used the full extent of his dragon scales when he unleashed that strike on the magnetic stone. There were just too many arrows and he could only push the magnetic stone that far.</p>

  <p>Thinking quickly, the rest of the divine-level talents immediately mobilized in order to pass through the Slow Arrow Area before the arrows closed in on them. They were actually racing against the arrows.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh! Whoosh..."</p>

  <p>The magnetic stone that had been pushed by Luo Zheng opened up a path that the divine-level talents could utilize for their passage.</p>

  <p>Not wasting any time, Luo Zheng quickly rushed towards the magnetic stone and slapped his palms on it once again. The momentum boosted the distance that the magnetic stone covered, launching it around sixty to seventy feet forward.</p>

  <p>"We can make it! If we're fast enough we can pass through!"</p>

  <p>"Quickly! Hurry up and follow me!"</p>

  <p>"Don't push me!"</p>

  <p>Everyone followed closely behind the magnetic stone since it was the only safe space against the flying arrows.</p>

  <p>"Let me help you, Tianxing!" a prince from a divine kingdom said. He rushed forward and, like what Luo Zheng did, smashed his palms against the magnetic stone.</p>

  <p>The prince was from the Star Field Divine Kingdom who possessed innate supernatural strength. He was a divine-level talent and was probably the strongest out of everyone in the younger generation.</p>

  <p>It was only right that he presented his skills in such dire times of need.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>However, despite all his supposed credentials, the magnetic stone moved only less than a foot away from him�</p>

  <p>The sight rendered everybody speechless. Just now, Luo Zheng had managed to push the magnetic stone for several dozen feet but the supposed strongest prince could only make it move a few inches away from him. Was Luo Zheng a monster?</p>

  <p>How could this be? The prince was someone who could easily overpower all of them in hand-to-hand combat. His strength was truly nothing to be taken lightly.</p>

  <p>But that scene with the magnetic stone just now� wasn't it a bit too ridiculous?</p>

  <p>There were also a few who wanted to help Luo Zheng push the magnetic stone.</p>

  <p>They knew they wouldn't be as strong as Luo Zheng but they figured they could at least push it around thirty to forty feet forward.</p>

  <p>However, everyone had a change of heart once they saw the Star Field Divine Kingdom prince's lackluster attempt. There was nothing they could do but merely follow behind those warriors who were stronger than them.</p>

  <p>'This guy's strength is amazing. No wonder he could injure a Soul Sea Realm warrior, ' they all thought.</p>

  <p>At the moment, however, Luo Zheng could care less about what they thought.</p>

  <p>There was a crisis to be addressed and he continuously pushed the stone forward, keeping their party safe from the arrows.</p>

  <p>"Coming! They are coming!" someone screamed out. The arrows were quickly closing in on them and they had to move fast.</p>

  <p>"Hurry up!"</p>

  <p>"There are so many people! We can't move forward!"</p>

  <p>Despite Zheng's display of monstrous strength, he was only one man and his efforts were still not enough.</p>

  <p>The warriors could not allow themselves to die there. Many of them constantly dodged the arrows through various leaps, rolls, and somersaults. In such a critical moment, no one had time to care about their manners. Everyone moved wildly in their desperation to survive.</p>

  <p>However, the arrows were relentless and there were still those who got hit.</p>

  <p>"Ahh�"</p>

  <p>The miserable screams began to ring throughout the vicinity as the arrows embedded themselves into the warriors' bodies, rotting their flesh rapidly.</p>

  <p>"We're almost there! Hold on!" Fiona's face was flushed red and she was sweating. It was so much for her first time joining the Feather Holy Sea exploration. At first, she had been so happy when her father finally let her join. His overprotective nature had always gotten in the way of her pursuit of adventure.</p>

  <p>But now, after seeing the scene in front of her, she understood why her father had been so adamant with keeping her out of the exploration. The Feather Holy Sea was indeed filled with dangers.</p>

  <p>Just as she had shouted these words, four arrows came flying towards her from both sides. There was almost no room to dodge.</p>
