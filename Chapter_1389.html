<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1389 The Peeling-off Words (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Because of this, the rankings had undergone a dynamic shift. The warriors from some palaces, such as the Coldness Palace and the Gold Palace, obtained good results, and some of them had even held on for twenty rounds. This was an impressive display of martial arts and cultivation.</p>

  <p>The palace leaders naturally felt proud and elated. The achievements of their subordinates added to their own esteem, after all.</p>

  <p>However, when their gazes inadvertently landed on Luo Zheng and Layla, they started to feel slightly displeased. The final results of the match were hard to determine for now, since Luo Zheng and Layla hadn't even taken part in the battle yet. It was still anyone's game.</p>

  <p>Several hours later, it was finally the last group of warriors' turn to challenge!</p>

  <p>The last group included one hundred and sixty-three warriors, less than the two hundred warriors who had numbered the previous groups.</p>

  <p>The old man didn't even need to call out the remaining warriors, because they already knew that it was their turn now. This was their chance to impress now, and tensions ran high after a whole day of waiting to be called.</p>

  <p>However, when the old man marked and selected the names for the last group, Luo Zheng and Layla were still unable to find their own names�</p>

  <p>What was going on? Luo Zheng was astonished and confused.</p>

  <p>Layla tilted her head also with a deeply puzzled look on her face.</p>

  <p>The old man dressed in the cotton clothes hovered in the air, and seemed to have noticed their expressions, so he said, "The two of you are in the next group!"</p>

  <p>"Is that really necessary..." Luo Zheng looked morose at that moment. As for the old man, he had a calm expression, as if it was all a matter of course. He was extremely willful and insisted on arranging Luo Zheng and Layla in the last group.</p>

  <p>Finally, the one hundred and sixty-one warriors all entered the ancient palace to undergo the test.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the huge stone on the other side of Willow Island underwent some dramatic changes.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng had left, a crack appeared through the words of the huge stone.</p>

  <p>The cracking progressed with a slow speed, as it ran along the rock face.</p>

  <p>Two cracks had also appeared on the other two big words four hours after Luo Zheng had left.</p>

  <p>However, the cracking speed kept increasing. In these past two days, countless cracks had appeared on the big words written by Supreme Lord Sword!</p>

  <p>During the last two days and two nights, the two Spirit Supreme Realm warriors, Landry and Damian, had also kept their eyes on everything that was happening in front of them.</p>

  <p>After they had already spent tens of thousands of years there, two days and two nights were not a long time in their eyes.</p>

  <p>However, now they felt that these two days and two nights seemed to be as long as one thousand years. Time was always a relative concept!</p>

  <p>They didn't know what Luo Zheng had done, but at the very least, he had somehow managed to trigger the huge words left behind by Supreme Lord Sword. This meant that the secret left behind by Supreme Lord Sword would very likely be unraveled after so many years' mystery!</p>

  <p>It was very likely that the greatly anticipated mystery did not even exist.</p>

  <p>The result might indeed bring the fatal blow to Damian and Landry, and they might even pass away on the spot!</p>

  <p>However, if the mystery existed and was unraveled, they could gather endless benefit from it, as long as they managed to comprehend ten to twenty percent of it.</p>

  <p>Their rank wasn't considered too high. Even if they worked hard, it was likely that they would only be able to obtain the position of the vice city lord of a tenth-grade sacred place in a supreme world. This was a mere pittance to some, but heavenly treasure to them.</p>

  <p>Warriors who were willing to contemplate at the stone were usually divided into two types of warriors. One type were those with extraordinary talent, who believed that they could comprehend the secret of Supreme Lord Sword; and the other type were those with mediocre talent, like Landry and Damian, who didn't want to lead a mediocre life.</p>

  <p>This was their only chance at greatness.</p>

  <p>Therefore, to them, these two days were the most important two days of their lives.</p>

  <p>More and more cracks appeared, and the words began to slowly peel off and slip down along the stone wall, shattering into pieces as they finally connected with the earth.</p>

  <p>Every time a fragment fell from the stone, Landry would be the first one to rush up and grab it. He collected those stone fragments, treating them as precious treasures. As he continued doing that, the stone fragments he collected formed a small mountain of their own.</p>

  <p>He had examined these fragments which were just ordinary stones and nothing special. Since he had been staring at the stone for tens of thousands of years, now he treated these fragments as treasures... They were as relatives to him, and had become his family after he had spent so many thousands of years observing them.</p>

  <p>As the last piece of stone fragment fell down, all the words on the giant stone wall peeled off, leaving only a few lines of uneven writing at the edges. Both Landry and Damian stared in awe at the barren rock face now. They waited expectantly for a moment, and then they both stepped back from the rock face.</p>

  <p>There was no reaction, nor was there any mystery...</p>

  <p>A bitter smile appeared on Damian's pale face and heaving a deep sigh, he said, "From now on, we can be free."</p>

  <p>"Free? Ha-ha... Sixty thousand years! Sixty thousand years! I've been sitting here for sixty thousand years!" Landry's laughter was somewhat hysterical as it echoed back off the blank rock. He had stayed there for three times longer than Damian. Back then, when the Willow Island was turned into a place for the Passing the Torch, all the warriors who were in front of the huge stone had to leave there. Landry had tried his best to strive for the chance to stay there, and he finally made it!</p>
