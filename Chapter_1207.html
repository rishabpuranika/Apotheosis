  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng couldn't move, and the great disturbance he felt in front of him was not helping in settling his nerves.</p>

  <p>"What the hell are these guys doing?" he asked Brianna in his mind, the shock obvious in his tone.</p>

  <p>Brianna snorted, "Only God knows. The Celestial Position race is made up of a bunch of weirdos. Do you know they once tried to destroy all the stars in the universe? They probably got to around more than twenty thousand stars until they were ruthlessly slapped by the heavenly law.</p>

  <p>Many of them died, so they had to give up their stupid plan."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was rendered speechless by her words.</p>

  <p>He remembered how he had been recognized by the Celestial Position race back in the Tower of Sin. Did that mean he was a member of this weird race?</p>

  <p>It would be for the best if he wasn't.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's body involuntarily moved forward, passing through piles of ruin until he saw a large circular crater. At the edge of the crater were six people. Among the six were the burly man and the black-clothed young man that Luo Luo Zheng had met a while ago.</p>

  <p>In the middle of the crater, dragon-shaped monsters came out one after another.</p>

  <p>Roar! Roar! Roar! Roar!</p>

  <p>The dragon-shaped monsters immediately rushed towards the people that surrounded them.</p>

  <p>All six people were immediately targeted and struck with invisible sound waves from the dragon-shaped monsters.</p>

  <p>The sound waves, however, did not have the chance to do any damage as the black-clothed young man simply brandished his black saber and cut through the monsters.</p>

  <p>Black light continuously streamed from his hands as each strike cleaved the dragon-shaped monsters into a rain of bloody mist.</p>

  <p>"That thing is really patient. It just refuses to come out!" the burly man said.</p>

  <p>Dorothea walked over them, followed by the many Soul Sea Realm masters she had under her control. "In that case, maybe we should change our method." Then she turned to a man with a silver mask and said, "Max, you truly have superb foresight. The Heavenly Stellar Secret Land should've been empty, but we were able to find some baits we could use."</p>

  <p>The Celestial Position race had dispatched seven people to this world, and they now worked together to capture a creature from this huge crater.</p>

  <p>Max, who was wearing a blood-colored cloak and a silver mask, simply nodded at her words. "Let's try it. It's your turn now, Hank."</p>

  <p>"Sure, Max." one of them answered with a laugh. This one wore a tattered straw hat and had with him a golden fishing rod.</p>

  <p>He waved the fishing rod in his hand and a thin green thread flew towards the warriors from the four divine kingdoms. A Soul Sea Realm master was immediately caught by his thread.</p>

  <p>Dorothea had restrained the Soul Cores used by the four divine kingdom warriors to control the corpses. Thus, these corpses, along with the souls within, had been reduced to unmoving bodies similar to inanimate blocks of wood.</p>

  <p>But they all remained in a state of consciousness.</p>

  <p>Once caught by the fishing thread, the Soul Sea Realm master realized that a mighty warrior like him was about to become the "bait" Dorothea had been talking about earlier. He was now about to be sacrificed for the creature that resided in the crater.</p>

  <p>They would've all trembled in fear at the sight if not for their state of helpless paralysis.</p>

  <p>Dorothea, however, felt their fear come in waves. "Hank, the greater the soul fluctuation, the more attractive it should be to the thing below!"</p>

  <p>Hank nodded as he gently waved the fishing rod and began to lower the bait.</p>

  <p>However, just as he was lowering down the bait, dozens of dragon-shaped monsters rushed out of the crater, releasing sound wave attacks towards the corpse.</p>

  <p>Roar! Roar! Roar!</p>

  <p>The sound waves were strong and broke down both body and soul of the mighty Soul Sea Realm warrior into fine dust.</p>

  <p>"Humph!" Max huffed. "That thing is quite cunning. It doesn't want to eat the bait. Hank, release a few more!"</p>

  <p>Hank did as he was told, gently waving the fishing rod and throwing fishing thread towards their collection of bait warriors.</p>

  <p>All the paralyzed warriors looked in fear at that green fishing thread, knowing that to be caught by it was equivalent to death.</p>

  <p>Reaching the Soul Sea Realm was no easy feat, and now that they had heard of the possibility of repairing the path to the Upper World, not a single one of them was willing to die here.</p>

  <p>However, their current state rendered them completely helpless. They could only watch as the fishing thread came towards them to take control of their lives and lead to their eventual deaths.</p>

  <p>This time, the thread caught six Soul Sea Realm warriors. Among the ones caught were two leaders of the Jade Martial House that had been treated and respected as noble masters. However, they were now nothing but fish baits for whatever it was inside that crater.</p>

  <p>"I'll make the thread longer this time. Let it have a taste. Once it knows how good these people taste, it'll bite them and fall for our trap!" Hank did not pull them into the air but released his fishing thread instead and threw all six baits into the large crater.</p>

  <p>Just as they fell into the crater, the flower in Dorothea's eye turned slightly and screams of despair suddenly resounded from the dark, horrifying crater.</p>

  <p>"Eh?</p>

  <p>Dorothea, why could those guys scream?" the black-clothed young man asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"I've released part of my restraining force so that they'd be able to scream. It adds a bit of flavor for that thing," she replied with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha!</p>

  <p>Dorothea, you're so mean," the black-clothed man joked, shaking his head in laughter.</p>

  <p>These Soul Sea Realm masters were terrified beyond their wits, so, of course, the first thing they'd do was scream the moment Dorothea released part of her restraining force.</p>

  <p>However, their cries only lasted for a few seconds before they came to an abrupt stop.</p>

  <p>A little later, the silence was broken by the terrible sound of cracking bones.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>It was as if a huge mouth was currently chomping on the bodies of those Soul Sea Realm masters.</p>

  <p>It was spine-chilling to hear such sounds from the crater. After a while, Dorothea smiled, "It should be done by now, right?"</p>

  <p>"Again!</p>

  <p>Let's see if it will take the bait this time!" Hank exclaimed, waving his fishing rod and taking a few more corpses with it. This time, the green fishing thread headed towards Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Both Luo Luo Zheng and Brianna frowned at the sight of the thread. "Shall I fight back now?" he asked her in his mind.</p>

  <p>However, Brianna maintained her cool. "No rush! The owner of this fishing rod is only at the Spirit Supreme Realm. Among all of them, only that one called Max is stronger than me. The problem is how much of my strength you can unleash?"</p>

  <p>Brianna's life vitality attribute was very different from Luo Zheng's. Therefore, he wouldn't be able to control this body effectively and utilize its full strength. Escape might be an option, but he wasn't too confident that he would be able to really run away.</p>

  <p>He only had one chance and he had to be careful.</p>

  <p>However, his salvation came in the unlikeliest package. Just as the green thread reached for him, Dorothea interrupted, "Hank, leave this for me!"</p>

  <p>"She is alive!" Hank remarked in surprise, only realizing now that Brianna wasn't a corpse but a living person.</p>

  <p>Dorothea nodded.</p>

  <p>"No wonder. I was wondering when your taste became so weird that you began to be interested in corpses!"</p>

  <p>Dorothea's face scrunched in anger at his words. "Stop talking nonsense or I'll kill you!"</p>

  <p>Hank merely chuckled, already used to her threats. The green thread lightly trembled and headed for War Emperor York instead.</p>

  <p>Only seventy Soul Sea Realm masters remained, and the chances of the four emperors being selected had been very high. It seemed War Emperor York was the unlucky one.</p>

  <p>Just as the fishing thread came for him, the flower in Dorothea's right eye rotated slightly, releasing a bit of her restraining force.</p>

  <p>War Emperor York suddenly roared, "I am the emperor of the York Divine Kingdom. I will give you everything. Just spare my life!"</p>
