  <p>
</p>

  <p>There was only one Picture Slab outside the Cloud Road. Each time one of the leaders wanted to observe a participant, the pictures had to be shifted from one disciple to another.</p>

  <p>Among all the disciples,  Luo Luo Zheng and Frank Zhuo were the most frequently watched ones.</p>

  <p>Some time ago when Frank and some other disciples entered Death Road, the Picture Slab could not track them anymore. Lady Long became anxious when she couldn't track her favorite disciples.</p>

  <p>As the leader of the Iridescence Sect, she knew of the dangers on Death Road. Over time, not a single disciple who had entered Death Road had survived.</p>

  <p>"What is Frank doing? He's taking Lois to a living hell!" Lady Long complained loudly now and then.</p>

  <p>If she could see the pictures from Death Road, Lady Long might have felt better. But now that Death Road could not be tracked and she could not see anything, Lady Long was worried about Lois.</p>

  <p>As time passed, Luo Luo Zheng, Tianming, and Lewis also entered Death Road. This time the Picture Slab could keep track of them!</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng met Frank and the other disciples, Fernandez and the others saw Frank on the Picture Slab.</p>

  <p>After catching a glimpse of Frank and Lois in the picture, Lady Long felt a little relieved as both of them were safe.</p>

  <p>Eagerly, Lady Long watched Frank kill the Flying Yaksha. His demonstration of strength pleased Lady Long tremendously, and she began to speak highly of Frank.</p>

  <p>However, in the end, the mysterious disciple from Cloud Hall turned his eyes towards the Picture Slab and flashed them a weird smile. The smile surprised all the sect leaders and Fernandez.</p>

  <p>How could this disciple from Cloud Hall see the Picture Slab?</p>

  <p>The sect leaders watched as the mysterious disciple squeezed the air with two fingers. In the next instant, the picture on the Picture Slab disappeared. How could he interfere with the working of the Picture Slab?</p>

  <p>Why did he do that?</p>

  <p>Fernandez and the sect leaders exchanged puzzled glances.</p>

  <p>"I've never met this disciple in Cloud Hall." Fernandez's face paled.</p>

  <p>Having led all the disciples from Cloud Hall to the trial, Fernandez had attended the roll call and seen each of the disciples attending the trial.</p>

  <p>Since Fernandez had an exceptionally good memory, he could remember everyone he had met. But somehow, Fernandez did not recognize this disciple!</p>

  <p>"How did this happen? Who is he? Could he be a disciple from another sect?" Lady Long asked with concern.</p>

  <p>"It's impossible. A beginner at the Illuminating Soul Realm cannot cheat me by disguising his appearance!" Fernandez shook his head as he did not agree with Lady Long. One of the conditions for entering the trial was that a disciple's strength could not be higher than the third grade of the Illuminating Soul Realm. If a disciple were at a higher grade, the space of the trial would refuse him.</p>

  <p>"If he is a disciple from Cloud Hall, why don't you recognize him? Isn't that strange?" Kenneth also felt as though something was wrong about this situation.</p>

  <p>The five sects had only selected a few disciples. While there had been nine from Red Sect, only three disciples had been brought from Cloud Sect. Disciples from other sects could not enter the transmission array, especially in front of the sect heads.</p>

  <p>Considering the strict conditions for entering the transmission array, it was highly unlikely for a disciple from another sect to mingle in the crowd of disciples from Cloud Hall. Furthermore, the transmission array for Cloud Hall was located at Cloud Hall headquarters. If a disciple with a strength lower than the third grade of the Illuminating Soul Realm were to cheat in Cloud Hall, he would be caught.</p>

  <p>Thus, the only possibility was that this disciple was from Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>Perhaps, he was an ordinary disciple who was not eligible to attend the trial but had entered the transmission array secretly.</p>

  <p>This was the only logical explanation.</p>

  <p>However, another question still bothered the leaders. How could he stop the Picture Slab? Earlier when Fernandez could not track Frank, the leaders had been unable to explain the occurrence. Perhaps, this disciple had done something to prevent it.</p>

  <p>Even Kenneth or Fernandez would not have been able to interfere with the working on the Picture Slab just by a hand gesture!</p>

  <p>Moreover, why did he do that?</p>

  <p>Fernandez gritted his teeth and tried to ignore what had happened. Since he could not find satisfactory and logical answers to these questions, he turned the Picture Slab to the other disciples. However, most of them were still discussing how to pass the Life Road.</p>

  <p>"Fernandez, don't you want to do something about it?" Lady Long could not let it go. "It is clear that the mysterious disciple intends to do something terrible. How can we just sit here and not take action? Frank is the son of Emanuel Zhuo. Fernandez, if something unexpected happens to Frank, how will you explain it to Emanuel?"</p>

  <p>Although Lady Long was worried about Frank, she cared more about her disciple, Lois. But Lois was not important enough to change Fernandez's decision. So, she mentioned Frank.</p>

  <p>Fernandez became annoyed with Lady Long's questioning. After all, he had led the disciples into the trial. Now, there was a stranger among them. How would such a mistake reflect on him? Fernandez smiled coldly, "Explain? What do you want me to explain to Emanuel? The reason why his son is not strong enough to pass the trial?"</p>

  <p>"You..." Lady Long had no answer for Fernandez. After all, her position was not as high as Fernandez's. Maybe Fernandez was not stronger or at a higher position than Emanuel. But their difference was negligible.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Lady Long was unreasonable by forcing Fernandez to do something.</p>

  <p>The fact was that only disciples no higher than the third grade of the Illuminating Soul Realm could enter the trial. All the people outside the trial could do nothing more than watch. Now, the Picture Slab could not trace some disciples anymore, so watching them had become impossible.</p>
