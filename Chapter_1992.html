  <p>In the Bloody Evil World</p>

  <p>The Bloody Plain of the Bloody Evil World was known as a land cursed by gods. If one were to dig up some of the soil, they would find that red blood flowed within. The entire plain was barren all year round. Not a single crop could be seen.</p>

  <p>However, the Demon Night race had arrived at the place. Ever since then, thick purple trees had sprung up from the Bloody Plain.</p>

  <p>The leaves of the purple trees were as sharp as knives. The trees looked similar to natural fortresses as they were wrapped entirely by the razor-sharp leaves.</p>

  <p>The trees were called Purple Feather Trees, and only the Demon Night race had such trees. It would only take a few days to grow a palm-sized seed to a tree that towered to four hundred to five hundred feet tall.</p>

  <p>The sharpness of the leaves on the treetops could be compared to a sacred weapon. They could easily hurt anyone that would be stupid enough to touch one.</p>

  <p>The trees were impervious to water and fire. Regardless of whether one buried the seed in solid rocks or in bitter seawater, it always developed, spread its roots and thrived.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the Purple Feather Trees were the mobile palaces the Demon Night race used whenever they were in a war. The trees that could be grown in such a short time would instantly be used to construct their headquarters.</p>

  <p>The Demon Night race had settled down on the Bloody Plain during their fight with the ogres. In less than half a month, the Bloody Plain was already filled with Purple Feather Trees. These impenetrable fortresses were established in such a short time because of the trees.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! dozens of bright silver dots of light suddenly appeared in the sky above the Bloody Evil World. Their radiance almost blinded anyone that saw them.</p>

  <p>These dots of light were like the individual suns, that illuminated the dark Bloody Evil World as if it were morning. They streaked across the horizon, passed through mountains and rivers, and headed straight for the Bloody Plain. The direction the dots traveled to was towards the Purple Feather Trees on the Bloody Plain.</p>

  <p>The first light dot exploded on the plain and created a powerful annihilation force that wrapped around ten Purple Feather Trees.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>After a loud bang, the ten Purple Feather Trees disappeared without a trace.</p>

  <p>There were thousands of Demon Night warriors on every Purple Feather Tree. When the dot of light smashed, the Demon Night race lost a massive amount of ten thousand people. Most of the warriors engulfed in the blast were world lords.</p>

  <p>On the tallest Purple Feather Tree in the Bloody Plain, a blue-clothed woman suddenly appeared. She brandished her hammer in her hand. The hammer started to emit energy.</p>

  <p>Almost instantaneously, the Thunder Law madly rushed out. After the Law Powers gathered together, they turned into a bolt of sharp lightning that shot towards the dots of light in the sky.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>Every time a lightning tentacle came into contact with the circular light dots, it would instantly detonate the light dots!</p>

  <p>All the dots of light were detonated in the air, and the light was ten times stronger than before. Under the strong light, the intense heat was released and spread out. The explosion scorched anything in its vicinity.</p>

  <p>The Purple Feather Trees closest to the light dots were instantly ignited by the heat and began to burn one after another. Many Demon Night warriors escaped from the Purple Feather Trees. Their miserable screams could be heard by everyone.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Three streaks of light shot towards the largest Purple Feather Tree.</p>

  <p>Shockingly, they were the three grand world lords of the Demon Night race. After the three grand world lords leaped onto the tree's crown, they knelt down in front of the blue-clothed woman. Respect and admiration appeared in the grand world lords' eyes as they gazed upon the woman.</p>

  <p>"My queen! It was the ogres' scheme to make us retreat to the Bloody Plain. Those imbeciles had such a devious plan! In just a few short days, more than half of our Demon Night warriors have died. Should we evacuate first?"</p>

  <p>"My queen, our enemies may seem reckless, but they are actually quite cunning. They want to exterminate us with such underhanded methods!"</p>

  <p>"My queen…"</p>

  <p>The three grand world lords of the Demon Night race were the three major generals of their expedition. Power and wisdom were necessary for their position.</p>

  <p>The Demon Night race had suffered heavy casualties after they had entered the Bloody Evil World. The three grand world lords felt pain in their hearts as they grieved for their companions.</p>

  <p>On the surface, the warriors of the Demon Night race were supposed to be superior to the ogres, whether it was in terms of intelligence or strength. But after the real fight, the Demon Night race found that the ogres far exceeded their imagination.</p>

  <p>The ogres that looked foolish and ugly seemed to come to their senses suddenly. Their actions began to be very smart. This was something that the Demon Night race had never expected.</p>

  <p>The ogres had set up a powerful barrier in the Bloody Evil World. The warriors of the Demon Night race were forced to build their headquarters in the Bloody Plain. Nonetheless, the Demon Night race became living targets for the ogres.</p>

  <p>The bombardments from the ogres were ineffective against Supreme Lords. However, the other warriors of the Demon Night race had suffered terrible losses against the ogres' attacks.</p>

  <p>Yao stood at the end of the branch. Her long skirt fell down from the tree trunk several dozen feet away. A finger-thick branch supported her whole body as if she was weightless.</p>

  <p>When she heard the persuasion of the three generals, her face remained expressionless. "I understand. You can leave now!" she said in an indifferent tone.</p>

  <p>"My queen!"</p>

  <p>"My queen!"</p>

  <p>Despair flashed across the faces of the three generals. Their voices reflected their negative sentiment.</p>

  <p>As members of the Demon Night race, they were absolutely loyal to their queen.</p>

  <p>Even if Yao had suddenly led them to become the enemies of the whole universe and sided with the Sacred race, they didn't hesitate and did as they were told.</p>
