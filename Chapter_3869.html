<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Within the 77th chaos, there had been a great conflict between the Interception Sect, created by the Grandmaster of Heaven, and the Enlightenment Sect, created by the Primeval Lord of Heaven. The reason behind this conflict was also related to the Finale Way.</p>

  <p>At the end of the battle, the Grandmaster of Heaven had been defeated by Ziya, and the foundation of the Interception Sect had been destroyed beyond repair.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven had led the remaining people of their sect to the Other Shore in an attempt to escape, and there they had quickly disappeared. In the past hundreds of chaotic eras, no one had ever seen the Grandmaster of Heaven himself, or the members of the Interception Sect.</p>

  <p>It was not until the Nihility race appeared out of the blue that the Grandmaster of Heaven began to show his face once again.</p>

  <p>There was no known knowledge of what the Grandmaster of Heaven had gone through, or how he had become the leader of the Nihility race during that time.</p>

  <p>The moment Ziya had descended into the Bloom Divine Province, the Primeval Lord of Heaven had warned him of the Grandmaster of Heaven, and to be cautious if he were to ever come across him. The latter had not moved on from when the Interception Sect had been destroyed.</p>

  <p>Ziya hadn't felt the need to take the words seriously at the time. He had thought that time would ease the pain, and erase the hatred in the Grandmaster of Heaven's heart. However, when they had come across one another in the Deleting Space, fury and hatred had burned in the Grandmaster of Heaven's eyes as he looked at Ziya, regarding him as if they were old enemies.</p>

  <p>A metallic 'whoosh' had cut through the air.</p>

  <p>With the Cyan Misty Sword in hand, the Grandmaster of Heaven had rushed towards Ziya.</p>

  <p>The Six Soul Flags in the distance quivered, and the black fire licking along the blade burned with heavy violence.</p>

  <p>Ziya understood just how powerful the Six Soul Flags were. He also knew that the Grandmaster of Heaven had led the Nihility race to great power, and that they could easily stand up to the Elemental Spirit race as near equals. His strength had grown exponentially.</p>

  <p>"God Lashing Whip!"</p>

  <p>Ziya struck out hard with his whip as he retreated.</p>

  <p>The resounding cracks caused by the whip were ear-piercing.</p>

  <p>As shadows danced and shimmied along the whip, the void began to tremble. What looked to be ripples appeared in the air, warping and distorting everything within their sight.</p>

  <p>The movement of the God Lashing Whip was erratic, and had no pattern to follow as it sent golden shadows one after another into the void.</p>

  <p>Those countless shadows then melded together to create a long, narrow dragon shadow that immediately rushed the Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>The shadows seemed alive, sizzling and cracking as they moved.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven thrust his sword in front of him and shifted forward. The black flames soared high, and ate away the golden shadows from the whip as they approached.</p>

  <p>When he had advanced to only a few dozen feet away from Ziya, Ziya relinquished his hold on his God Lashing Whip and bowed to the Grandmaster of Heaven with cupped hands.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven paused, confused by the gesture. His eyes flashed with anger before turning cold. "Do you think this display will make me show mercy? Ziya, how naive you are!"</p>

  <p>"No, I did not think you would show me mercy. Now is not the time for us to fight. I'm sorry that I have to do this to you," Ziya said quietly.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven found himself thoroughly confused, and the sudden sensation of the sky and earth moving made his head spin. In the next moment, he appeared in the Separate Amber Province. This was where Othniel had exiled him.</p>

  <p>Ziya had total control over the Deleting Space. He had more authority than the Chaos Ancient God here. Not only could he freely dispose of things within the space, he could also find the same time node.</p>

  <p>It wasn't that Ziya didn't have the strength to battle the Grandmaster of Heaven, but he shared the same thought as his master, the Primeval Lord of Heaven. When they had defeated the Interception Sect, they had felt some modicum of guilt and did not want to fight him because of that.</p>

  <p>The moment the right space and time node had been found, Ziya sent the Grandmaster of Heaven out of the Deleting Space.</p>

  <p>Once Othniel had exiled the Grandmaster of Heaven into the Deleting Space, he floated down. He worried that the Grandmaster of Heaven would return quickly, so he planned to take Zheng away as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>But before he could descend, a space fluctuation occurred not far away, and the Grandmaster of Heaven emerged.</p>

  <p>Othniel's face contorted slightly before smoothing back out. Without hesitation, he slashed his hand through the air in the direction of the Grandmaster of Heaven, and immediately wrapped him in another expanse of space.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven found himself still in a daze after being forced out of the Deleting Space. It made no sense. How did Ziya have such an ability?</p>

  <p>While he was stuck within his cloud of confusion, a space fluctuation enveloped him flawlessly and he found himself once more in the Deleting Space.</p>

  <p>Ziya couldn't find the words to express his own confusion. Within a span of several seconds, the Grandmaster of Heaven had been cast out only to be returned moments later.</p>

  <p>What the hell was going on?</p>

  <p>With his intelligence, it was not difficult for Ziya to grasp what was exactly going on.</p>

  <p>The only possible explanation could be that when the Grandmaster of Heaven descended through the Descending Ring, he had fought with the Son of Truth who controlled that particular space.</p>

  <p>Ziya could have never guessed that the reason the two fought was Zheng.</p>

  <p>"You'd best vent all that anger on the Son of Truth," Ziya grumbled.</p>

  <p>With a wave of his hand, he sent the Grandmaster of Heaven back out.</p>

  <p>Othniel though, who was in the Separate Amber Province, was on his guard. The moment he saw the Grandmaster of Heaven was cast out, he began to delete the space.</p>

  <p>With no time to react, the Grandmaster of Heaven was sent right back to the Deleting Space. He felt as if he were going to be sick...</p>

  <p>Ziya sighed, his shoulders slumping. The Grandmaster of Heaven might be difficult to deal with, and the Son of Truth probably had no choice but to continue to send him back, but it was not a good idea to keep throwing him back and forth like a ball.</p>

  <p>"I suppose all I can do is close the Deleting Space."</p>

  <p>Over countless chaotic eras, Ziya had managed the affairs and taken over the rights of the Deleting Space. He certainly had the ability to refuse the space that the Son of Truth had "deleted" to enter.</p>

  <p>However, Ziya needed the substances that were sent in, one after the other, from the chaos. It allowed him to learn things from within the chaos.</p>

  <p>A soft whooshing sound startled Ziya from his thoughts.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven had regained his senses enough to utilize Grand Teleportation and reach Ziya instantly.</p>

  <p>He raised his hand and swung his sword!</p>

  <p>The black radiance along the edges of his sword was as bright as fire, and came barreling towards Ziya's face.</p>

  <p>Ziya though was a little bit faster...</p>

  <p>Before the attack could plow into him, the Grandmaster of Heaven disappeared.</p>

  <p>Ziya turned quickly to look at the Deleting Pillars at the far end of the Deleting Space. He waved his hands before him, and a portion of the Deleting Pillars hummed to life with a bright light before quickly dimming.</p>

  <p>With that action, the rules of the Deleting Space had changed. There was a unique space node at the entrance of the Deleting Space, and it so happened to be controlled by Othniel. However, Ziya had long ago changed it to be one way, so people could enter but not leave.</p>

  <p>But now that particular rule had changed. People could neither enter nor leave.</p>

  <p>When the Grandmaster of Heaven had been sent out once more, Othniel immediately enveloped him with space and began to delete it.</p>

  <p>However, the space did not disappear, no matter how hard Othniel willed it to.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven remained where he had appeared, and stared at Othniel with a puzzled expression.</p>

  <p>Could a Chaos Ancient God even make a mistake?</p>

  <p>"What have you done?! I can't sense the Deleting Space!" Othniel cried in shock.</p>

  <p>Losing the ability to delete meant losing a trump card, but usually Chaos Ancient Gods had many of those up their sleeves.</p>

  <p>The fact that the ability he had obtained from the space of truth was weakened or muted by another made him feel on edge, the horrible feeling creeping up his spine.</p>
