<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1888 Shocking Qin City (Part One) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>There was a teleporting area at the southern hills of the central Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. About fifteen percent of the warriors were transported there whenever they entered the area.</p>

  <p>When the teleporting area was occupied by the Qin Clan, the name of the area was immediately changed to Qin City. Afterward, the Qin Clan sent their world lords into the city and gradually conquered the location.</p>

  <p>A bright white light suddenly appeared and shone across the center of the sky of Qin City. The light was actually a result of the scattered Space Law.</p>

  <p>As the space token passed down through the divine land, it created a very stable and nearly perfect space channel. As the incandescent white Space Law inter-weaved ceaselessly, a large snowflake was formed. The snowflake rotated mid-air a few times until suddenly, somebody fell straight out of the snowflake.</p>

  <p>A world lord within the fortress saw the person and rushed quickly into the sky. When the world lord finally reached the person who was still in the middle of the fall, the world lord delivered a surprise and gasped.</p>

  <p>"Young master, who had the guts to do this to you? Were you suddenly attacked by powerful beasts in the wilderness?" the world lord asked.</p>

  <p>There was no doubt that the person who fell was Quentin.</p>

  <p>However, the front of his body had his flesh ripped apart and mangled. A huge gash was seen on his chest that one could see the eerie bones within it.</p>

  <p>The corrosion from Luo Zheng's shield also morbidly damaged Quentin's left hand.</p>

  <p>A ring made from cyan wood was seen on the little finger of his left hand. It was an escape ring. The escape ring could replace his body with a wooden puppet the moment he encountered danger. Simultaneously, it would also teleport him elsewhere. If he was in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, the escape ring would be able to teleport Quentin back to Qin City.</p>

  <p>The world lord carried Quentin all the way into the fort. The arrival of Quentin in such a miserable state alarmed everyone in their path.</p>

  <p>"What happened? How is the young master?"</p>

  <p>"How can he be severely injured? Who did this to him?"</p>

  <p>"I'm sure the injuries are not caused by a blunt weapon. It must have been caused by some kind of erosion." The people delivered their concerns with voices full of panic.</p>

  <p>The world lords knew that swift actions were needed to save Quentin.</p>

  <p>Immediately, another world lord set up a grand formation and activated the divine texture. Afterward, streaks of jade-green light were infused into Quentin's body.</p>

  <p>The warriors continuously fought in the divine land. As long as a warrior still had a breath of air in them, then no matter how serious their injuries were, they could still be revived.</p>

  <p>The horrible wounds on Quentin's body started to heal. Countless muscles grew and intertwined with each other. Afterward, his skin began to cover up the newly formed muscles and not even a scar was found.</p>

  <p>Quentin then slowly opened his eyes. Exhaustion reflected on his face.</p>

  <p>The world lords immediately noticed how weak he still was even after his regeneration process.</p>

  <p>"Young master, what kind of beast did this to you?" a world lord asked curiously.</p>

  <p>These world lords stayed in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land all year round. Therefore, warriors wouldn't attack for no reason in the six great sacred places. Moreover, the young master was in the territory of the Skyland race. Qin Clan went there frequently and they had a close relationship with Skyland race.</p>

  <p>Most people believed that the young master had been injured by a strange and powerful beast during his training.</p>

  <p>When he heard the world lord's query, Quentin's face darkened. "My injuries weren't caused by a beast." Quentin's voice was still weak, yet disappointment flowed in his tone as he clenched his teeth.</p>

  <p>"Not a beast?" The world lord who asked was surprised by Quentin's answer. He wondered what or who could have been responsible for Quentin's serious injuries. 'Could it be that he had a fight with the Skyland race?' The world lord was taken aback by his thought.</p>

  <p>"Damn it! I was injured by a secondary creature!!!" Quentin answered with a voice full of rage. That was a shameful situation for Quentin. The fact that he still lost to Luo Luo Zheng even after he used his Sky Pearl showed that there was no hope of him to ever overpower Luo Luo Zheng. Quentin could try a million times again but he would still experience defeat against Luo Luo Zheng in a match of power. However, he still refused to agree that Luo Luo Zheng possessed stronger strength and technique.</p>

  <p>"A secondary creature?"</p>

  <p>"How is that possible?" the world lord asked with eyes widened with disbelief.</p>

  <p>"Young master, are you sure of what you're saying?" a voice echoed from the people. They were still surprised that someone was able to do such a thing to their young master.</p>

  <p>Even more so, they found it hard to believe that the one responsible for Quentin's injuries was a mere secondary creature.</p>

  <p>The people were aware of the strength of secondary creatures. There were many secondary creatures in Qin City. Additionally, as the Qin Clan occupied the teleporting area, they were also responsible for the distribution of the trial tallies. They knew that these secondary creatures fought until their heads bled for some low-level trial tallies.</p>

  <p>The fact that their young master had actually been injured by a secondary creature was totally unbelievable.</p>

  <p>"I... I even used the great Wishing Spell." Quentin stuttered. Humiliation started to sink to his soul.</p>

  <p>The world lords were even more shocked. If Quentin was injured like this even after he used the great Wishing Spell, then the secondary creature's origin was definitely something to worry about.</p>

  <p>"What about Hayes? And Mac? Did they not protect you, young master?" a world lord asked in anger as if he wanted to blame those he just named.</p>

  <p>Two guards were appointed to Quentin when he entered the Skyland race. Their responsibilities were to protect their young master at all cost but they failed to carry out their duties as their young master had been severely injured.</p>

  <p>However, the two guards did not enter the Tidal Surge. They figured that with Quentin's strength, there was no need to accompany him in that place.</p>

  <p>"I even used the Sky Pearl," Quentin added with a regretful voice. He tried to be as honest as could be, perhaps in an attempt to cover up the embarrassment of his defeat to a secondary creature.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"Is this true, young master?"</p>

  <p>The world lords present were startled. Most of them couldn't comprehend the reality of the situation.</p>

  <p>
