  <p>
</p>

  <p>Sword Chen was naturally afraid of the big fiends but at this given critical moment, he could not care any less about such concern.</p>

  <p>Through Luo Zheng's words, he had learned the true intention of Nicholas and his group.</p>

  <p>He had been hidden in the Abyss Demon Region for so many years, but he didn't just live his life to survive. He also had great ambitions!</p>

  <p>Even it meant that he had to face the threat of the Holy Beings and of the fiends, he didn't have the slightest hesitation at all.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>It was of no surprise that he faced no obstructions along the way...</p>

  <p>After all, every fierce beasts in the entire Abyss Demon Region had been exterminated. Right after the fierce beasts released the superfluous Faith Energy, they had returned to their respective lairs and waited to get revived.</p>

  <p>After travelling for some distance, it was not long before he saw the huge opening.</p>

  <p>Noticing how the opening looked like made him gasp in astonishment. He couldn't believe his eyes!</p>

  <p>What intense explosion could cause such a huge opening?</p>

  <p>Without doubt, it was difficult for him to imagine the scene when the three fiends had self-detonated...</p>

  <p>After observing the opening for a while, he leaped and flew directly to the seventh stage through it. It didn't take a long time before he was near the broken Fiend Hall. Getting closer, he suddenly caught a glimpse of a large group of fiends!</p>

  <p>"These fiends..."</p>

  <p>Seeing the fiends made his heart beat for a pause as he felt nervous. By reflex, he wanted to find a place to hide.</p>

  <p>But as he looked at them closely, he noticed that the fiends he was looking at right now were different from the fiends he had encountered before. They were very short in size, only over a hundred feet tall.</p>

  <p>Staying in the Abyss Demon Region for many years had made him gain more knowledge about the fiends. He learned that the powerful fiends usually had absorbed enough Faith Energy, making them constantly strengthen themselves, so their bodies were incomparably tall. Fiends at a powerful level were specially about six or seven thousand feet tall!</p>

  <p>As Sword Chen showed himself to the fiends, their eyes immediately widened in alarm.</p>

  <p>They had dared come over only after knowing that the members of the alliance of the rich and powerful clans on the Floating Islands had entered the ice palace.</p>

  <p>They were very upset when they were forced to release the Faith Energy, as they were incompetent under that woman's oppression.</p>

  <p>However in the end, they didn't choose to escape...</p>

  <p>They had already turned in their Faith Energy and even if they were killed again, there would be no loss.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>Assessing that the situation was affirmative on his side, Sword Chen was no longer afraid. His figure flashed and stopped on the main entrance of the ice palace. He grabbed a fiend and asked, "Where are the Holy Beings?"</p>

  <p>"Can't you see it yourself? They were lured in by that bitch!" the fiend answered impatiently.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the fiends' emotion was in deep complication. They were unwilling to submit to this woman but on the other hand, if this woman could really succeed, they indeed had a chance to leave the Abyss Demon Region!</p>

  <p>"Woman? Lured in?"</p>

  <p>Sword Chen repeated as his face showed a trace of confusion.</p>

  <p>Just when he arrived at the front of the ice palace, he had a strange feeling rising from his heart.</p>

  <p>He threw the fiend away and walked straight to the main entrance, waving his hand at the same time as he took out a long sword.</p>

  <p>This sword was the sword Luo Zheng had inserted into the Sea of Meditation.</p>

  <p>Since there was a subtle connection between Luo Zheng and the sword, he tried to use it to find out Luo Zheng's location and whether he was still alive.</p>

  <p>He had never sensed any hint of Luo Zheng's existence when he was in the Sea of Meditation. But now, the sword gave out a ripple of reaction!</p>

  <p>'Luo Zheng is in the ice palace? How did he leave the Sea of Meditation?'</p>

  <p>His eyes lit up at the thought. Without hesitation, he pushed the door open and rushed in. He was faced against the cold air that came from within.</p>

  <p>Splash... dozen layers of crystal clear ceilings were smashed with an extreme force.</p>

  <p>It was a hit by Luo Zheng's punch.</p>

  <p>A huge hole was created and Luo Zheng swiftly went through it.</p>

  <p>The ice palace wasn't a magic array, that was why the damaged walls and ceilings had not been repaired and restored by themselves. It was left as it was.</p>

  <p>No matter how big the ice palace was, it still had an end. Luo Zheng believed that he would be able to leave as soon as he chose a direction and kept moving forward.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>The phantom behind him also had followed closely.</p>

  <p>"You don't have to waste your time. I think you'd better obediently wait for my master to come," the phantom said to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng just ignored it and continued to dig down.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>"Clatter..."</p>

  <p>Countless ice crystals scattered and fell down like flowers sent from the heavens.</p>

  <p>Although he was busy with the digging, he still kept an eye over the phantom's action. When he noticed that it was once again coming closer, he quickly turned over and leaped into the air. He moved his arm as he threw a punch.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>The phantom received a punch and was immediately thrown thousands of feet away...</p>

  <p>Despite that, Luo Zheng's punch still failed to hurt the phantom. Since he didn't use the Wild God Power, their strength was almost on the same level.</p>

  <p>But his sole purpose for the hit was not to kill. He just wanted to distance himself from this phantom.</p>

  <p>Not wasting any time, he turned around and continued to dig down. He had already gotten through many layers...</p>

  <p>Underneath his feet, there was still the transparent ice palace layers upon layers, as if there was no end.</p>

  <p>"I told you not to waste your energy." The phantom's voice suddenly sounded as it once again caught up with him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng frowned. He stared at the phantom and asked, "Then tell me, who on earth is your master?"</p>

  <p>"It's me..."</p>

  <p>Just at the right time, a voice was heard from above.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng raised his head and saw a beautiful woman with fair skin sitting at the edge of the hole in the ceiling.</p>

  <p>This large hole was the hole he had just created.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" He instantly asked unperturbed as he stared at the woman with a cold expression.</p>

  <p>With a faint smile on her face, the woman jumped down from the ceiling.</p>

  <p>"Da!"</p>

  <p>With her slender legs slightly bending, she landed steadily beside the phantom in Luo Zheng's image.</p>

  <p>"I am what I am..."</p>

  <p>She answered as she hugged the phantom in Luo Zheng's image.</p>

  <p>The phantom looked like it had completely submitted itself to the woman.</p>

  <p>Its arms stretched out as it gently stroked the woman's smooth and fair-skinned face.</p>

  <p>To be honest, seeing a person who looked exactly the same as himself being so intimate with a totally strange woman, Luo Zheng felt a strange feeling rising in his heart.</p>

  <p>He threw the strange emotion aside and asked, "Why did you lock me here?"</p>

  <p>The woman raised her neck and seemed to enjoy the caress of the phantom in Luo Zheng's image. She narrowed her eyes and said indifferently, "Because you are the only Nine Li member I met in all these years! I was so lucky to meet you in the black water!"</p>

  <p>So it turned out that it was really because of his bloodline.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's speculation was the same as that of Sword Chen.</p>

  <p>Sword Chen had stayed in the black water for so many years and everything was fine even with the unknown things around him. Then the moment he appeared, why did things suddenly change?</p>

  <p>It was confirmed that it might have something to do with Luo Zheng's bloodline.</p>

  <p>"Even if I'm a member of the Nine Li race, what's your purpose of trapping me here?" Luo Zheng still continued to ask.</p>

  <p>The woman paused and brushed off the phantom's arm. She then walked slowly towards him.</p>

  <p>A burning excitement couldn't be concealed in her eyes. As she approached Luo Zheng, she reached out her hand and gently rubbed his chest. She lowered her eyes and said, "After I get a real body, leave the Abyss Demon Region and cleanse the entire divine land, I will be able to carry on the bloodline of the Nine Li race with you. What do you think? Isn't my purpose wonderful?"</p>
