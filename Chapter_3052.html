<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3052 Zheng's Strength </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Once Monica finished speaking, the man testing his strength shouted and raised his hand which wielded a long sword.</p>

  <p>Six sword radiance beams shot out from the sword and charged at the red stone.</p>

  <p>"Bang! Bang! Bang!"</p>

  <p>"It's the Six Fractals Strike. He has mastered it well. However, his Other Shore Token is nothing unique. It's an ordinary Heavenly Cyan Stone,"</p>

  <p>Monica explained while shaking her head.</p>

  <p>Although she didn't hold this Flag Master in high regard, he was nevertheless a powerful warrior of the Other Shore Realm. In Zheng's eyes, his strike was anything but weak.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Zheng asked, "You mentioned the divine megaton. What is it exactly?"</p>

  <p>"Look!" Monica exclaimed as she pointed at the red stone.</p>

  <p>He was clueless to what the red stone was made of. It didn't crack under the powerful hit of a warrior of the Other Shore Realm. No damage was evident on its surface.</p>

  <p>The spiral pattern within the stone's center began to slowly twirl and gradually revealed a word? Two.</p>

  <p>"The man struck the stone with his full strength along with the power of the Heavenly Cyan Stone. But the resulting strength is equivalent to only two divine megatons," Monica explained further with a smile.</p>

  <p>"In other words, the divine megaton is a scale unit that weighs one's power?" Zheng asked for confirmation.</p>

  <p>Monica nodded. Wanting to impress Zheng, she outstretched her hand when the Flag Master left and a sword shadow soon appeared.</p>

  <p>Moments later, a triangular Other Shore Token hovered above her head along with a surge in her aura. Wielding her weapon, she rushed forward towards the red stone with agile steps.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>The illusory sword slashed at the red stone and was followed by an audible crack.</p>

  <p>Some Flag Masters who passed by hurriedly stopped as soon as they heard the sound. Turning their heads, they saw the word "Eleven" appear on the red stone.</p>

  <p>"Your power reached eleven divine megatons?" Zheng asked in amazement as he walked to her side.</p>

  <p>Monica nodded and said, "My Other Shore Token isn't strong enough.</p>

  <p>That's why I was barely able to reach that level."</p>

  <p>Although her Other Shore Token was comparatively weak, it still possessed a powerful theurgy. Of course, she wouldn't tell Zheng what it was.</p>

  <p>Amused at his bewildered expression, Monica chuckled and said, "You should give it a shot. Let's see what level your power is."</p>

  <p>"Me? But I haven't reached the Other Shore Realm yet," Zheng uttered.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter. In fact, the unit of divine megaton was set according to the power of a Heavenly Cyan Stone that is common on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>When a Heavenly Cyan Stone bursts, it emits a power equivalent to the force of one divine megaton. Don't you want to confirm the gap between the Other Shore Realm and your level?" Monica encouraged.</p>

  <p>Hearing her words, Zheng gave a slight nod and narrowed his eyes upon examining the red stone. He flickered his finger, and a long sword appeared in his hand.</p>

  <p>As he gathered the power of his inner world, the Ways-blending Energy flew along the meridians before reaching his hands.</p>

  <p>Zheng's aura continued to glow.</p>

  <p>Monica's eyes narrowed upon witnessing this. 'Could this be the resulting power of blending the Godly Ways? How many of the Godly Ways has he combined? Perhaps dozens? No... He has probably blended a thousand of them at this point...' Monica thought to herself.</p>

  <p>Zheng merged too many Godly Ways. Normal people wouldn't be able to tell how many kinds his Ways-blending Energy held.</p>

  <p>As this rare aura spread out, it managed to capture the attention of some of the Flag Masters who stopped to watch.</p>

  <p>"How could a warrior below the Other Shore Realm become a Flag Master?</p>

  <p>That's quite odd."</p>

  <p>"What kind of power is it? It doesn't appear to be a Truth of Godly Way."</p>

  <p>"Whatever it is, it's certainly powerful!"</p>

  <p>A few of the highly perceptive Flag Masters were also intrigued upon discovering Zheng's unusual power.</p>

  <p>As the Flag Masters attentively gazed, Zheng raised his eyebrows before slashing the red stone with his sword.</p>

  <p>Instantly, his Ways-blending Strike exploded upon contact with the red stone.</p>

  <p>The moment the stone absorbed all of the energy Zheng had unleashed upon it, the deafeningly loud explosion bounced off and echoed within the square.</p>

  <p>The word "one" appeared on the red stone as soon as the Ways-blending Energy's light disappeared.</p>

  <p>A smile spread across Zheng's face once he saw the number. "Does this mean my strike force has reached one divine megaton now?"</p>

  <p>"..."</p>

  <p>Monica was stunned into silence and forgot to answer Zheng.</p>

  <p>The other Flag Masters who witnessed the scene stared with eyes as wide as saucers.</p>

  <p>"Flag Master Monica?" Zheng called out, breaking the silence that hung in the air.</p>

  <p>Monica came back to her senses and composed herself before replying,</p>

  <p>"Correct me if I'm wrong. You didn't even use the Truth of Godly Way to do that, did you?"</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded to confirm. "I have yet to cultivate any truth theurgy."</p>

  <p>Monica was baffled by his remark.</p>

  <p>Once a warrior could reach the Other Shore Realm, one divine megaton was the least amount of force that they could achieve. Many would opt to fuse an Other Shore Token immediately after crossing the Sea of Truth? usually the Heavenly Cyan Stone.</p>

  <p>The Flag Master who struck the stone before Monica had used the same stone along with a truth theurgy? the Six Fractals Strike. However, he just barely managed to achieve two divine megatons.</p>

  <p>Zheng, on the other hand, only crossed the fourth line and managed to achieve a divine megaton without using a Truth of Godly Way! In terms of power alone, Zheng was comparable to the weakest Other Shore Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>"You shouldn't have come to Dragon City," Monica uttered in a low voice as she shook her head from side to side.</p>

  <p>She knew deep in her heart that Zheng ought to be sent directly to the top of the Oneness Mountain. However, she couldn't fathom the thoughts of those leaders.</p>

  <p>"What's the big deal? Anyone who has wasted their time on blending Godly Ways could achieve the same result," one of the Flag Masters standing not far away pointed out indifferently with a scornful smile plastered onto the corners of his lips. "But how many idiots in the world are willing to waste time on doing that? When one reaches the Other Shore, any Other Shore Token they choose to integrate would be more powerful than this blending!"</p>

  <p>The Flag Master who spoke was one of Galen's followers. Witnessing the sheer strength that Zheng had just displayed, he naturally began to doubt his abilities with his words.</p>

  <p>"Really? I wonder how strong you were when you had yet to reach the Other Shore Realm, Flag Master Philbert. Perhaps one-tenth of Zheng's current level? Or even less?" Monica retorted.</p>

  <p>In Monica's eyes, even the disciples on top of the Oneness Mountain could hardly reach one divine megaton with the use of their strongest truth theurgy? much less Philbert when he was still a True God.</p>

  <p>Philbert let out a cold snort and hurried away as he carried the flag on his shoulder.</p>

  <p>Monica turned to Zheng and said, "Don't mind Philbert. Once you reach the Other Shore Realm, people like him will have no right to belittle you like that..."</p>

  <p>"I don't care." Zheng shook his head.</p>

  <p>He realized now that staying in the Dragon City meant that he had no choice but to constantly improve his strength and gain the recognition of the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>"Alright, come with me. It's time you chose some truth theurgies," Monica said.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded in agreement and followed her into the depths of the Dragon City.</p>

  <p>At the peak of the Origin Mountain, a huge transmission array constantly flashed blue and white.</p>

  <p>Soon after, a short figure emerged. It was a golden-haired Ear Mouse.</p>

  <p>This transmission array was used by the Origin Mountain to connect to the outside world. On either side of it stood guards who were highly cultivated.</p>

  <p>They were all strong warriors of the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>Once the guards saw this golden-haired Ear Mouse, they were baffled.</p>

  <p>With a high-pitched voice, the mouse requested, "Tell your master to come here at once!"</p>
