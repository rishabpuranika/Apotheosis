<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Even though Zheng was an extraordinarily powerful warrior, he couldn't stop the mountain from sliding down.</p>

  <p>He could only slow it down a bit.</p>

  <p>Libby refused to sit back and watch this happen. Planting her feet firmly into the ground, she leapt and flew towards the sliding mountain in an attempt to block it. However, she ended up drilling right through it, failing even to slow it down.</p>

  <p>When she had burst out from the mountain, suddenly, an idea crossed her mind. "Master Athemar, use the Lofty Sword!"</p>

  <p>The Lofty Sword itself was massive. Athemar turned to look at her when she called him, and upon hearing her words, he nodded in understanding.</p>

  <p>Without hesitation, Athemar started to recite the spell. Then, multiple rings of light appeared in the air, and from the center of these huge rings, the Lofty Swords shot out.</p>

  <p>In a flash, the huge Lofty Swords planted themselves firmly onto the side of the mountain. Elizabeth, Libby, and the others pressed themselves against the Lofty Swords, trying to push the mountain backward.</p>

  <p>Athemar made sure to distribute the Lofty Swords around the mountain evenly, and wherever he looked, a strong warrior had gotten a hold of the Lofty Swords to push back the mountain.</p>

  <p>Thanks to this newfound strategy, the collapsing of the upper half of the mountain slowed to a halt!</p>

  <p>At this time, Pearce finally gathered enough strength to speak. "Auden, you take Athemar and the others to cast the arrays. First, we must fix the mountain body."</p>

  <p>Auden nodded and flew to Athemar to relay his orders. Immediately, they began to set up arrays in the area where the mountain initially broke.</p>

  <p>It was no easy task to build arrays that would fix such a massive mountain.</p>

  <p>Even though these arrays were just enough to make a temporary fix, it took them almost two hours.</p>

  <p>As they worked on the arrays, Elizabeth and the others kept on pushing the mountain to keep it from sliding. This exhausted a considerable amount of divine crystals, yet they knew they had no choice but to use the power of their Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>Two hours later, the arrays were activated, finally stabilizing the mountain.</p>

  <p>At the sight of this, everyone breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>When Zheng saw that the mountain had settled down, he deactivated his Wild God Body and descended to join the others. Once he landed, Pearce stared at him strangely.</p>

  <p>It was no secret in the Oneness Sky Palace that Zheng had cultivated the Wild God Body.</p>

  <p>Actually, even in this era, it wasn't too out of the ordinary to cultivate the Wild God Body.</p>

  <p>While wild bones were indeed exhausted, that didn't mean that the super forces hadn't collected any of them from the past. In fact, their stocks were enough to allow a small number of people to cultivate the Wild God Body.</p>

  <p>However, the reason why Pearce looked at Zheng dubiously was because Wild Gods weren't supposed to be able to enter the Other Shore. Additionally, it was difficult for them to obtain more than one divine megaton of force, so it was practically useless to focus on cultivating the Wild God Body.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng was different. Not only was he strong in a Wild God Body, but he was also able to enter the Other Shore. This made Pearce finally realize another pressing problem.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, you really have made rapid progress in such a short period of time after you came to the Oneness Sky Palace," Pearce suddenly said.</p>

  <p>Zheng cast a confused look at Pearce, unsure of the latter's intentions.</p>

  <p>Nodding modestly, he answered simply, "I'm flattered."</p>

  <p>Pearce shook his head. "I know your physical body can enter the Other Shore, and naturally you will have great potential in the future. But more than a year ago, you were still in Stage Thirteen of the Lust World. And that was too far from the upper stages. I didn't expect you to step into the Desire World so soon." Pearce paused, his gaze fixed on Zheng. "Besides, your soul is extremely stable. You have already reached the ultimate level of the Indigo Soul, right?"</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>It wasn't difficult for him to reach the ultimate level of the Indigo Soul. In fact, he was even able to help others reach this level.</p>

  <p>"After the ancient times, countless people have reached the ultimate level of the Indigo Soul," Pearce continued indifferently. "But not a single one of them got the Myriad Tribulations Body. So, since then, no one has stood a chance to enter Stage Thirty-three."</p>

  <p>"After ancient times, no one has entered Stage Thirty-three?" Zheng echoed in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Yes, there are two conditions for one to enter Stage Thirty-three. First, to transcend the ultimate level of the Indigo Soul to become a Holy Soul.</p>

  <p>Second, to own the Myriad Tribulations Body. After meeting these two conditions, one will be able to enter the Eternal Scroll Painting in Stage Thirty-two and then get up to Stage Thirty-three, the Three Purities Stage!"</p>

  <p>Pearce said excitedly, his eyes flashing with a hint of yearning.</p>

  <p>He, Auden, and Athemar had all reached the Holy Soul Realm. But because they couldn't get the Myriad Tribulations Body, they failed to enter the Eternal Scroll Painting. Naturally, this meant they couldn't proceed to Stage Thirty-three. They were forced to limit their cultivation to Stage Thirty-two, which was fruitless.</p>

  <p>This was their biggest regret.</p>

  <p>Not far away, Micah and Bagot had been listening. The two exchanged helpless looks as they heard what Pearce was saying. They were by no means weak, but because of the Other Shore rules, they too were doomed to share the same fate.</p>

  <p>"Eternal Scroll Painting?" Zheng asked, his heartbeat quickening.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it's a huge scroll painting floating in the air in Stage Thirty-two, with all sorts of powerful creatures drawn in it. The masters who enter the Eternal Scroll Painting are called Eternal Warriors, or 'Eternal Beings',"</p>

  <p>Pearce smiled. He was pleased to answer Zheng's question.</p>

  <p>"Is Eastern Emperor Taiyi also an Eternal Warrior?" Zheng asked, raising his eyebrow curiously.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Pearce answered. "Only two people from the Oneness Sky Palace are Eternal Warriors: Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Madam Yasamin. So, naturally, their strength is higher than that of the other five mountain leaders!"</p>

  <p>After the battle between the Oneness Sky Palace and the Sun Crow race, Zheng had gotten a general understanding of these people's strength.</p>

  <p>Previously, he was under the impression that the gap between the other mountain leaders and Eastern Emperor Taiyi wasn't that big. However, now he realized that he had been wrong; while they were only one stage apart in cultivation level, the disparity in strength was extreme!</p>

  <p>"Your soul and body are qualified. I hope you can enter the Soul City as soon as possible and pass the Land of Bone Tribulation, and become an Eternal Warrior," said Pearce, looking at Eastern Emperor Taiyi who was sitting on the ground. "Maybe you can go to Stage Thirty-three to save Eastern Emperor Taiyi..." he said softly.</p>

  <p>"If I'm qualified to become an Eternal Warrior just because my physical body can enter the Other Shore," Zheng said, "what about Feng Ge?" As he spoke, he looked at Feng Ge, who was standing nearby.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge's situation was a little out of the ordinary.</p>

  <p>Her own physical body did not enter the Other Shore, but her purified being's body did.</p>

  <p>Pearce smiled. "Maybe. After all, the test of the Eternal Scroll Painting is on the Other Shore. Theoretically, anyone who passes it can enter Stage Thirty-three, but I can't be completely sure."</p>

  <p>Feng Ge's case was so different, even Eastern Emperor Taiyi could not be sure.</p>

  <p>"I will definitely be an Eternal Warrior," Feng Ge suddenly said determinedly. "I want to save Father!"</p>

  <p>Pearce looked at her dotingly, his wrinkled face full of fondness. "I believe you will do it!"</p>

  <p>Feng Ge cast a glance at Zheng.</p>

  <p>She knew in her heart that the key to become the Eternal Warrior was still him.</p>

  <p>Under the gaze of Feng Ge, Zheng looked a little uneasy. He glanced at the Oneness Mountain that had been stabilized and suddenly said, "I need to go back to the Flow Sword Sect!"</p>

  <p>Although it was unlikely that the Bearing race would go to the three sword sects, Zheng was worried. Now that the war in the Oneness Sky Palace had been settled, it was time for him to go back to check on his family.</p>

  <p>The moment he finished speaking, he stretched his arms and launched himself into the sky.</p>

  <p>During the battle, the Bearing race had destroyed the arrays that had been set up along the mountain. Because of this, Zheng didn't need to climb the mountain anymore, he just flew straight to the top.</p>
