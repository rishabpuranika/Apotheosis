<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng, Flamine, and the others were stunned.</p>

  <p>Emperor Charm was powerful and with this power came extreme determination and a strong will. Once he chose a path, he would doggedly stick to it even if he was wrong.</p>

  <p>But just a few words from the real Emperor Charm pushed him to change his mind.</p>

  <p>The real Emperor Charm was not surprised and remained calm as usual.</p>

  <p>Emperor Charm and the real Emperor Charm had similar personalities. The real Emperor Charm knew that his duplicate couldn't accept deception and betrayal.</p>

  <p>Emperor Charm's duplicate had once been the king of the Sun Crow race, and hadn't considered his behaviors as betrayal. But things changed after the duplicate had discovered his identity.</p>

  <p>At the time, Emperor Charm's duplicate had argued with Eastern Emperor Taiyi's duplicate about which path they should choose. And now that he had finally proved his fault, he wasn't about to accept anything else.</p>

  <p>"Of course, you can choose another path if you want," the real Emperor Charm said.</p>

  <p>Emperor Charm nodded.</p>

  <p>He was still interested in the bloodline power of the Sun Crow race.</p>

  <p>He also wanted to know what the human race and the real Emperor Charm were like in the past.</p>

  <p>But Emperor Charm had just nodded when the eyeball on his forehead suddenly flashed a triangular black light, and a strange cry rang out from it.</p>

  <p>"What's the point if you're willing to do that? You should also ask if we are willing to let you do it!"</p>

  <p>Emperor Charm looked worried at these words. "Who-who are you?" he stammered.</p>

  <p>The Element Spirit race had given this eyeball to Emperor Charm. But for a long time, Emperor Charm had always used it to communicate with the Yellow Thearch, the Divine Farmer and Mahoney, or to borrow Other Shore Tokens from them. But this scream was from none of them!</p>

  <p>"Who am I? Ha-ha!" The voice laughed but did not answer.</p>

  <p>"I know who you are."</p>

  <p>A figure appeared above Zheng's head once again. It was none other than the Primeval Lord of Heaven.</p>

  <p>When Zheng had asked the energy souls of Emperor Charm, Houyi, and Eastern Emperor Taiyi for help, the Primeval Lord of Heaven had begun to pay attention to the outside world.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven had finally chosen to show up when the voice of the eyeball had sounded.</p>

  <p>The triangular black light in the eyeball stared at the Primeval Lord of Heaven's energy soul and its laughter became even more arrogant. "Nice to meet you again. Tell me, do you want to stir up trouble just by relying on this strand of energy soul?"</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven stared calmly at the triangular black light in the eyeball and said, "I have obtained the opportunity."</p>

  <p>"Really? In that case, why are you hiding in Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore? You are inferior even to the Nihility race!" The triangular black light continued to taunt him.</p>

  <p>Every race on the Other Shore that believed in the Finale Way were suppressed. They either disappeared from the Other Shore, or joined the Element Spirit race.</p>

  <p>Even the human race, which had been extremely powerful for a period of time, had been trapped within Stage Thirty-three of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Only the Nihility race was an exception.</p>

  <p>The path of cultivation that this race had chosen was completely different from that of the Element Spirit race. But before the Element Spirit race could begin to suppress them, the Nihility race had successfully attracted many talents and powerful warriors from many large races.</p>

  <p>It had grown to an extent that the Element Spirit race had found it really difficult to suppress it.</p>

  <p>"Your plan is unfortunately a little too late," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said with a smile. "You don't have an advantage in the chaos."</p>

  <p>"This advantage is nothing for our Element Spirit race!"</p>

  <p>Perhaps the voice wanted to prove that it didn't care. The eyeball began to suddenly blink.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The eyeball turned red, a terrifying energy brewing within it.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi stood beside them and noted Emperor Charm's every movement. He was afraid that Emperor Charm would kill people and cause trouble.</p>

  <p>When the energy began to spread, he transported himself so he was standing before Zheng in a flash.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, Emperor Charm had also guessed that something was up.</p>

  <p>He turned to look at his subordinates and then glanced at the real Emperor Charm, saying, "This man is the real Emperor Charm. I'm just a clone.</p>

  <p>Perhaps this is why you betrayed me. I'm willing to believe it, but please follow and support him."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, small blue squares appeared around his body, and he appeared in the sky.</p>

  <p>"Flamine, please forgive me,"</p>

  <p>Emperor Charm said, looking down at Flamine.</p>

  <p>Flamine had Sun Crow race's bloodline flowing in her veins.</p>

  <p>When she had married Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Emperor Charm had obviously agreed.</p>

  <p>But Flamine had been the one to cause the conflict between the two races at the beginning and she was considered to be a traitor in the entire Divine Lair.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Before Emperor Charm could finish speaking, the red eyeball exploded.</p>

  <p>Emperor Charm had soared into the sky because he didn't want to hurt Zheng, Flamine, and the others.</p>

  <p>But although the eyeball was strong, the shock wave did not cover a large area. The explosion only caused Emperor Charm's head and the upper part of his body to shatter into pieces, causing the lower part of his body to fall from the sky.</p>

  <p>"Emperor Charm!"</p>

  <p>The members of the Sun Crow race were heartbroken at this development.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth flapped her wings and flew upwards, catching Emperor Charm's broken body in her arms.</p>

  <p>The Sun Crow race needed to listen to Emperor Charm in Zheng's mind because of the bloodline worship, but their memories and emotions were still there. This kind of grief bubbled up from the depths of their hearts.</p>

  <p>Flamine bit her lips, her face lined with sorrow.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge didn't share a good relationship with Emperor Charm. The Oneness Sky Palace and the Sun Crow race had turned into enemies even before she was born. She detested the winged demon women of the Divine Lair.</p>

  <p>But her mood soured when she sensed Flamine's sadness.</p>

  <p>It was truly pitiful for a leader of a super force to die in this way.</p>

  <p>The moment Emperor Charm died, everyone's eyes fell back on Hancock and his companions.</p>

  <p>Hancock and his companions had wanted to escape in the beginning. But after Emperor Charm had launched an attack on the Bloom Divine Province, they had become unwilling to leave.</p>

  <p>When all the powerful warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace were killed, they would be able to search and snatch any treasures on the seven mountains. A super force had a very deep foundation and abundant resources after all.</p>

  <p>It never occurred to them that Emperor Charm could be no match for Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>

  <p>In this moment, they were thinking about whether Emperor Charm could run away along with them. With Emperor Charm's strength and his control of the space theurgy, it would be easy for him to do it.</p>

  <p>But they hadn't expected Emperor Charm to suddenly stop fighting and start a chat with them.</p>

  <p>Moments after, Emperor Charm even soared into the air and exploded.</p>

  <p>Hancock and the others were stunned and at this point, found it impossible to escape.</p>

  <p>The moment the eyeball on Emperor Charm's forehead exploded, a violent vibration was transmitted to the foreheads of the Yellow Thearch, the Divine Farmer, and Mahoney in a different place in the Source World.</p>

  <p>They frantically tried to sense Emperor Charm's eyeball, but the other side had fallen into darkness.</p>
