<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4151 Erase Coordinates </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>There were a total of four teams behind Sewell, the Divine Snake Department, the Black Snake Department, the Cyan Snake Department, and the Abdomen Poison Department.</p>

  <p>Sewell himself led the Divine Snake Department which consisted of the strongest elites of the Snake Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>"The Black Snake Department, and the Cyan Snake Department, you attack from both sides!" Sewell commanded with authority.</p>

  <p>"The Cyan Snake Department got it!"</p>

  <p>"The Black Snake Department, attack!" the two Snake Masters standing respectively on the left and right teams responded, leading the teams to charge towards the Wine Basin...</p>

  <p>"Divine Snake Department, follow me to attack!"</p>

  <p>Sewell rushed into the Wine Basin first after his order.</p>

  <p>His body expanded rapidly the moment he rushed into the Wine Basin.</p>

  <p>The high water splashed on both sides.</p>

  <p>The elites of the Divine Snake Department followed his lead and also stepped in!</p>

  <p>The last one of the four teams, the Abdomen Poison Department, specialized at using poison. They usually wandered around when a battle was in full swing, but at this moment, they stayed put.</p>

  <p>"Da! Da! Da!"</p>

  <p>On the right side of the Wine Basin, a group of human spirits walked fast on the water. They skimmed like dragonflies across the water?advancing with naturally graceful movements.</p>

  <p>The three houses of the Human Spirit Sect were regrouped and joined the Cyan Snake Department. Together with the other members of the Cyan Snake Department, they hurried to the right side of the Wine Basin.</p>

  <p>The bird spirits had built many complicated bird nests in the Wine Basin.</p>

  <p>These nests were sturdy and huge, supported by complex internal structures.</p>

  <p>Since they couldn't use spatial transference, the several teams could only break in by force relying on their bodies.</p>

  <p>"This time, we people of the three houses will try our best to take down the first three bird nests. If anyone slacks off, I will report them to the Cyan Snake Department and have their coordinates erased forever!"</p>

  <p>Gianni shouted, walking in front of the team.</p>

  <p>The human spirits of the Black House, the Broad House, and the Joy House had long been dissatisfied with the Snake Spirit Sect. Previously, they only guarded the various Pure Sky Platforms and did insignificant things. But now they were involved in a battle with the Bird Spirit Sect, the anger in them intensified.</p>

  <p>The human spirits, monkey spirits, snake spirits, and bird spirits were supposed to be a family. Why had they come to kill each other like this?</p>

  <p>Shivers ran down their spine when they heard Gianni's warning.</p>

  <p>In the last round of attack, Heath of the Joy House and Uriel of the Black House purposefully got themselves killed by the Bird Masters. Gianni then reported this to the Snake Masters, and the Snake Masters immediately erased their coordinates.</p>

  <p>The two human spirits then died permanently.</p>

  <p>The chaos was just a small pond, and all the Treacherous Beings believed that this state was temporary. Sooner or later they could return to the main world, yet the thought of dying in this small pond was grim and excruciating.</p>

  <p>Despite the horror, the human spirits had their own plans.</p>

  <p>Once the fight actually began, the situation would certainly be chaotic.</p>

  <p>So, it would be normal if anyone accidentally got killed.</p>

  <p>"You can't slack off," Gianni emphasized. "On top of that, I will erase the coordinates of the five people who die first."</p>

  <p>Everyone's face darkened with sorrow and fear.</p>

  <p>Alphonse and Hamilton frowned and exchanged glances secretly.</p>

  <p>When they set foot on the journey, the two human spirits had already devised a plan. If they had a chance, they would lead the human spirits of the three houses to take back the coordinates and escape from the Jade Pure Realm!</p>

  <p>When they stepped into the battlefield, they realized that they had no chance to carry out the plan.</p>

  <p>The coordinates were closely guarded in the Mist City. Moreover, Gianni also helped the Snake Masters watch them closely!</p>

  <p>Gianni sensed the emotions of the human spirits. He smiled faintly and said, "This is the order of the Snake Masters. I'm just passing on the words so you won't dare slack off! If you are not convinced, you can ask the Snake Masters yourselves."</p>

  <p>Everyone stayed silent.</p>

  <p>To confirm it with the Snake Masters was no different from courting death.</p>

  <p>As the human spirits rushed dozens of miles forward, three huge bird nests appeared in front of them.</p>

  <p>The lower part of the nest was supported by a row of straight trunks while the upper part was oval-shaped covered in thick thorns.</p>

  <p>When the human spirits saw the bird nests, the bird spirits in the nests also spotted them.</p>

  <p>"Aoo..."</p>

  <p>A frightening cry of eagles reverberated from the bird nests.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh...</p>

  <p>Out came flying a flock of snow-white birds.</p>

  <p>"It's the Snow Bird Department! They exchanged positions!" someone reminded the others loudly as he recognized the birds.</p>

  <p>In the previous rounds of attacks, the human spirits fought the Iron Bird Department. These were bird spirits that looked like eagles who had vigorous wings.</p>

  <p>In this round of attack, they thought they would face the Iron Bird Department again, but the Bird Spirit Sect seemed to have changed their strategy!</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh...</p>

  <p>After the Snow Birds flew to a peak, they spiraled down like snowballs crashing down on everyone.</p>

  <p>The Snow Birds didn't seem powerful with the attack, yet they posed a great threat.</p>

  <p>When they were several thousand feet from the warriors of the three houses, everyone felt a chill rushing among them.</p>

  <p>In the Wine Basin, the water up to people's knees quickly began to condense into ice. Even the newly condensed ice was as strong as a weapon. Some people couldn't pull their legs as they became planted to the ice!</p>

  <p>"Puff, puff, puff..."</p>

  <p>Three human spirits who couldn't get out of the ice were directly hit by the Snow Birds.</p>

  <p>The freezing air blew and enveloped them, turning them into ice sculptures.</p>

  <p>Killing Treacherous Beings had never been easy.</p>

  <p>They were able to recover after being cut into little pieces, let alone being frozen.</p>

  <p>However, the bodies of the Snow Birds had sand grain-sized Holy Stones hidden in them. The Holy Stones burst out as the human spirits froze.</p>

  <p>When the Light of Annihilation enveloped the ice sculptures, it produced a magical effect. The Treacherous Beings melted like snow lying under the sun's heat...</p>

  <p>As the other human spirits witnessed this, they all turned to look at Gianni. Death was not scary?what was terrifying was the removal of their coordinates.</p>

  <p>"Three people died already?" asked Gianni with a wicked smile on his face. "It seems that five people is not enough. I will double the number.</p>

  <p>The ten people who die first will have their coordinates erased!"</p>

  <p>The human spirits shuddered. Overcome with resentment, they decided to proceed. They all used their best skills to counterattack.</p>

  <p>"Sword haze, destructive move!"</p>

  <p>Alphonse somersaulted and a bright long sword appeared in his hand.</p>

  <p>The long sword was made of Holy Stone. Countless rays of snow-white sword radiance mixing with the Light of Annihilation shone upwards.</p>

  <p>"Puff, puff, puff..."</p>

  <p>The Light of Annihilation instantly pierced through the Snow Birds, shattering them into pieces.</p>

  <p>Under Alphonse's lead, the human spirits all launched a counterattack.</p>

  <p>Although the Snow Birds had a populous destructive tendency, their defense was extremely weak. They lost their fighting power after being hit by the Light of Annihilation.</p>

  <p>The human spirits of the three houses were not weak. They worked together forming a strong line of defense.</p>

  <p>Despise their large number, the Snow Birds fell one after another from only a hundred feet away. In less than three minutes, more than ten thousand Snow Birds had been eliminated, leaving no Snow Bird flying out from the nests again.</p>
