<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>When he heard Zheng's response, Fabian quickly knew that it would be a difficult decision for him to make.</p>

  <p>To put it bluntly, all of the top-level war lords here including Fabian himself weren't as important as Luo Zheng alone!</p>

  <p>The Purple Heart Sacred Place was actually relying on Luo Zheng to control the Tower of Sin. Even if all of the top-level war lords they were with died in this cave, the Purple Heart Sacred Place would be able to train more top-level war lords in the future, so they basically were unimportant characters.</p>

  <p>However, without Luo Zheng, the status of the human race would be restored to their former position.</p>

  <p>The reason why the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place of the Demon Night race had allied with the Purple Heart Sacred Place was also because of Zheng's sword spirit, Xun. To put it bluntly, it was still for Zheng's sake.</p>

  <p>After all, there was no need for a seventh grade sacred place to ally with the Purple Heart Sacred Place, which just qualified to be regarded as a sixth grade sacred place.</p>

  <p>Fabian was not the only one to think of such things. Many other top-level war lords had the same thoughts. However, they were also aware how difficult it would be to further explore the cave.</p>

  <p>"The Dark Nether Cave is too dangerous to be in this time. I suspect that the Tide of Chaos has broken out. Why don't we make the wiser choice and just retreat this time?" Fabian wasn't ready to give up. In his mind, he knew that he would be able to persuade Luo Zheng to go back.</p>

  <p>"Tide of Chaos?" Luo Zheng asked doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"Yes, but that is just my speculation. It is said that the Tide of Chaos would erupt in this cave once every ten years, and when the Tide of Chaos breaks out, the monsters in the Dark Nether Cave would become much more active, and the degree of danger of the place would greatly increase.</p>

  <p>Whenever those years roll by, we normally cancel our explorations," Fabian explained as he stared at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>His words were a reminder to Luo Zheng of the dangers of the Dark Nether Cave.</p>

  <p>'You can't ask so many humans to die with you, right?' Fabian thought to himself.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng was thinking about a totally different thing.</p>

  <p>After the run-in they had with the giant toad just now, the dangers of the cave were already crystal clear to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>But he didn't have much time left. He had been in this continent for close to a year. The more time passed, the more worried he would be.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng were to miss this opportunity, he would have to wait for another full year!</p>

  <p>If that ever happened, he would most likely become a war lord, or even a top-level war lord. If he had such strength as he entered the Dark Nether Cave, it would be much safer for him, and for everyone he was with. But then, a year's time was more than enough for there to be too many crucial variables in the Central Region.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry. Although I know that this place is very dangerous, I really can't wait for another year," Luo Zheng apologetically said, while shaking his head and staring at Fabian. His eyes were brimming with determination.</p>

  <p>Fabian let out a deep sigh. After all, there was no reason for him to leave Luo Zheng alone in the Dark Nether Cave. If he did and Luo Zheng survived, it would be okay. But if Luo Zheng was unable to return to the Tower of Sin, Fabian would undoubtedly be the first one to be punished by the Purple Heart Sacred Place!</p>

  <p>But then, considering how so many of the people they were with were already set on leaving the area, he couldn't bring himself to say that they needed to stay.</p>

  <p>Eventually, he opened his mouth and announced the decision. "Jarrod," he said slowly, taking a deep breath. "You and I will stay here with Luo Zheng. The rest of you," he continued, his eyes sweeping everyone that was with them.</p>

  <p>"You can retreat and wait for us in the Tower of Sin."</p>

  <p>Jarrod did not hesitate and nodded in approval. He understood Fabian's thoughts immediately, and very well.</p>

  <p>With that, all of the other top-level war lords let out a sigh of relief. Their expressions were also as if a heavy burden had been lifted from their hearts.</p>

  <p>Many of them did not want to stay in the cursed place for even a second longer.</p>

  <p id="top_12">It wasn't difficult to return via the same route as they had come, as they had only gone a few dozen miles after being chased by the Swallowing Birds. It wouldn't take long for an expert of their level to close the distance.</p>

  <p>After the top-level war lords left with the war generals, Fabian turned to Luo Zheng and said, "Well, now that we have chosen to stay, we will accompany you as far as possible! Luo Zheng, the thing that you want to obtain after entering this Dark Nether Cave must truly be something extraordinary."</p>

  <p>Hidden in the Dark Nether Cave were immeasurable treasures and endless good fortune. Even the people who had only reached the outer layer had been able to enjoy it. Although the treasures in the outer layer had been decreasing in number after so many years of people scavenging for them, there were still people who had been lucky enough to find precious objects during their ventures.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," Luo Zheng answered vaguely.</p>

  <p>"You don't know?" A strange expression appeared on Fabian's face, "Then do you at least have a goal?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe. If possible, I would like to enter the core area of the Dark Nether Cave," Luo Zheng said. As these words came out of Zheng's mouth, Fabian's and Jarrod's faces were instantly colored with disbelief.</p>

  <p>'What is this kid even thinking? Entering the core area of the Dark Nether Cave? Crazy!'</p>
