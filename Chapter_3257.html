  <p>
</p>

  <p>Jermain was exasperated. Meanwhile, Luo Zheng seemed calm and relaxed.</p>

  <p>The moment he got the first candle, Luo Zheng became aware of the Dark Region's existence.</p>

  <p>He had always been interested in the Dark Region. Naturally, he wouldn't let go of this opportunity.</p>

  <p>"This human friend right here offered sixty million soul pills.</p>

  <p>If no one else is willing to bid, the key to the Grand Sky Temple will be his!" said the Ear Mouse.</p>

  <p>For some reason, the Ear Mouse spoke more quickly after Luo Zheng placed his bid. It was as though it was eager to get the deal done.</p>

  <p>This made Jermain more anxious. He was scared that Luo Zheng wouldn't be able to afford the sixty million soul pills. And so, he hoped someone else would raise the price.</p>

  <p>Just as the Ear Mouse was about to announce that the deal was done, another voice came from the crowd. "Sixty-four million..."</p>

  <p>The Soul of Light who raised the price was as tall as a thin tree. It was obviously a member of the Heavenly Pine race in the Source World.</p>

  <p>As Jermain heard the voice, he let out a sigh of relief. Now that this guy's bid was higher than Luo Zheng's, he need not worry about Luo Zheng anymore.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, a bunch of Ear Mice in the back stage of the auction house clutched their chests in dismay.</p>

  <p>"He is so stupid!"</p>

  <p>"Why didn't he just announce the deal was closed? What was he waiting for?"</p>

  <p>"I heard that the name of the corporeal body's spokesperson is  Luo Zheng Luo!"</p>

  <p>"Damn the Heavenly Pine race! They ruined our plan!"</p>

  <p>The Ear Mouse seemed a little disappointed as it announced miserably,</p>

  <p>"This friend of the Heavenly Pine race offers sixty-four million soul pills."</p>

  <p>With this, the Heavenly Pine member who offered the price grew angry at the Ear Mouse's reaction. "What's the matter? Do you not want me to bid for the key? Could it be that the soul pills of the human race are more valuable than those of our Heavenly Pine race?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, Jermain, Ling Shuang, and the others present all felt like there was something wrong.</p>

  <p>The Ear Mouse seemed to be desperate to sell the Other Shore key to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, please don't bid anymore. How would we afford that amount of soul pills if no one else tops your bid?" Jermain hurriedly warned Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was not planning to bid again. He just looked at the Ear Mouse on stage and smiled. It was not that he didn't want to add more soul pills. He simply wanted to find out what tricks the Ear Mice were playing.</p>

  <p>But then, something strange happened.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng didn't bid anymore, the Ear Mouse became silent.</p>

  <p>Silence fell over the entire auction house. It was as though they were not here for auction but for tea.</p>

  <p>The behavior of the Ear Mouse displeased the member of the Heavenly Pine race even more. "Hey, are you not intending to sell the Other Shore Key?"</p>

  <p>"When did we Ear Mice ever go back on our words? Of course, we will sell the Other Shore Key. It's just that I have been presiding over the auction for too long today. I feel a little bit tired..."</p>

  <p>The Ear Mouse began to stall for time. It still wouldn't announce that the Other Shore Key was now sold to the member of the Heavenly Pine race.</p>

  <p>"Do not stall. I have the soul pills right here. Give me the Other Shore Key!</p>

  <p>Now!" the member of the Heavenly Pine race demanded angrily.</p>

  <p>With that, Luo Zheng smiled slightly and said, "I offer sixty-four million and ten thousand soul pills."</p>

  <p>This time, he only added ten thousand soul pills to the Heavenly Pine member's bid.</p>

  <p>Immediately after he offered his price, the Ear Mouse shouted without thinking twice, "Deal!"</p>

  <p>All the creatures off the stage were stunned as they witnessed this.</p>

  <p>"What a fraud!"</p>

  <p>"Is this even an auction?"</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you just sell it to humans directly?"</p>

  <p>"Today I finally know how shameless the mice are..."</p>

  <p>The nonhuman creatures began talking among themselves.</p>

  <p>The member of the Heavenly Pine race became even more furious. He went up the stage and grabbed the Ear Mouse. "You dare play tricks on me!"</p>

  <p>However, the Ear Mouse was not afraid of him at all. It squeaked twice before saying, "I wasn't making fun of you. This human friend's bid is indeed higher than yours."</p>

  <p>"I already offered a huge price but you waited a long time and refused to announce that the deal was done. But when that guy offered his price, you didn't even wait for anyone else to offer theirs. What if I add one million soul pills?" proposed the member of the Heavenly Pine race.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry but the deal is already done," answered the Ear Mouse.</p>

  <p>"Then, I'll add ten million more!" The member of the Heavenly Pine race went all out now.</p>

  <p>"Sorry. The credibility of our Ear Mouse race is most important. We can't go back on our words," responded the Ear Mouse.</p>

  <p>The member of the Heavenly Pine race felt helpless. This Ear Mouse was determined to give the Other Shore Key to that human and he could do nothing more about it.</p>

  <p>Neither the member of the Heavenly Pine race nor the other nonhuman creatures could understand the reason why the Ear Mouse would do this.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, what the hell have you done? Why did the Ear Mouse insist on selling the Other Shore Key to you?" Jermain asked confusedly.</p>

  <p>"It's possible that they want me to enter the Grand Sky Temple," Luo Zheng replied with a smile.</p>

  <p>"They want you to go to the Grand Sky Temple?" Jermain couldn't believe it at all.</p>

  <p>Those who were in Stage Thirteen were the strongest Souls of Light in the Lust World. Anyone who was able to reach this stage was probably not an easygoing person.</p>

  <p>Jermain knew that Luo Zheng was a talented disciple. However, the latter was still unfamiliar with Stage Thirteen because he had just entered it. The Ear Mice wanted Luo Zheng to go to the Grand Sky Temple? Nothing of the sort had ever happened in the world.</p>

  <p>"You'll find out in a while. Just wait," Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>"But sixty-four million and ten thousand soul pills?!" Jermain began to worry that Luo Zheng might not be able to afford the soul pills.</p>

  <p>"No need to worry, Jermain. It's just tens of millions of soul pills. I can still afford it," Luo Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>Jermain was extremely worried about Luo Zheng. On the other hand, it made Luo Zheng a little uncomfortable that Jermain cared too much about him. After all, it was not the first time Luo Zheng had stepped on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Jermain had no choice but to sit quietly beside Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The auction came to a close after the Other Shore Key to the Grand Sky Temple was sold.</p>

  <p>Although the member of the Heavenly Pine race was very unhappy about how it turned out, all he could do now was leave.</p>

  <p>The Ear Mouse on the stage walked towards Luo Zheng and said, "Sir, you will get the Other Shore Key after you pay the soul pills."</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng suddenly said, "The price of the Other Shore Key is too high."</p>

  <p>The Ear Mouse didn't expect to hear Luo Zheng say that. So it told him, "Sir, you were the one who bid it."</p>

  <p>"How about a ninety-percent discount? I'll pay you six million soul pills and I'll only take one person with me. You can decide the others who can enter the Grand Sky Temple," Luo Zheng added.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing this, Jermain thought that Luo Zheng must have gone crazy.</p>

  <p>He had bought it with more than sixty million soul pills himself. And now he was bargaining for a ninety-percent discount? Jermain thought the Ear Mouse would be enraged.</p>

  <p>However, things didn't turn out as Jermain expected. "I can't make the decision for what you just offered. Wait here just a minute," said the Ear Mouse before it turned around and left.</p>

  <p>With a bitter smile Jermain said, "I think we'd better get out of here."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't pay attention to Jermain. When the Ear Mouse returned, it told Luo Zheng, "If you don't need the Other Shore Key and let us keep it, you need not pay any soul pills. We will take you and your companion to the Grand Sky Temple."</p>

  <p>"What?!" Jermain exclaimed. He could hardly believe what he heard.</p>

  <p>This didn't come as a surprise to Luo Zheng, though. He stood up and said, "Thank you for your kindness. I wonder when you plan on going to the Grand Sky Temple."</p>

  <p>"We will open the gate to the Grand Sky Temple tomorrow," replied the Ear Mouse.</p>

  <p>"Then I'll see you at the gate of the Grand Sky Temple." Luo Zheng shrugged and left the auction hall with Ling Shuang.</p>

  <p>Jermain was still following them in amazement. He felt like he had attended a false auction and had no idea what just happened.</p>
