  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was a lot calmer when he stepped into the temple of the Bearing race again. He no longer continued to destroy the temple.</p>

  <p>He started looking around the temple. Thankfully, its structure was simple.</p>

  <p>He walked through the rest half of the temple as the warriors of the Bearing race stood, watching. Their Souls of Light glowed a nervous sheen.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the faces of the Bearing race warriors dimmed with the sudden realization of what Luo Zheng was looking for.</p>

  <p>Two things were of great value in the temple: the Other Shore Tokens and the soul crystal.</p>

  <p>He already took the Other Shore Tokens, which meant he was aiming for the soul crystal.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng took a glance at the scene before him. There were several forks ahead and each fork had warriors guarding them, but the road right in front of him had the largest number of warriors.</p>

  <p>His lips curled into a smile. The Bearing race basically gave away the route leading to the soul crystal.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng approached, Souls of Light stood firmly and blocked his way. They had no intentions of making way for him.</p>

  <p>"You can't go in," said one of the warriors. "This is an important part of our temple."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shook his head. "Try and stop me," he dared.</p>

  <p>He had already destroyed half of the temple. The warriors here weren't in the position to reason with him.</p>

  <p>Despite this, they stood their ground.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stepped forward. He bumped them and caused everyone to stagger away.</p>

  <p>Some of them tried to approach Luo Zheng to grab him, but as they neared him, Luo Zheng simply flicked his wrist and threw them out. Once all of them were out of his way, he continued on his path to the depths of the temple.</p>

  <p>"Alas!"</p>

  <p>"This is our fault. We shouldn't have set up a trap for the disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace. We are taking the consequences of our own deeds."</p>

  <p>"I haven't received my soul crystal yet. It seems that I won't have any chance to get it."</p>

  <p>"??"</p>

  <p>The Bearing race collectively sighed. A heavy air rose as depression dawned on them.</p>

  <p>It was extremely difficult for ordinary warriors to improve their souls on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>The only luck they could count on was if they were able to acquire some soul crystal from the temples and wilderness.</p>

  <p>However, warriors and disciples from the super forces often had the resources to improve themselves rapidly. Luo Zheng and Dorothy were two of these warriors. They were able to have Indigo Souls almost effortlessly.</p>

  <p>If anyone plundered the soul crystal in the temple, then the warriors of the Bearing race here would have little to no hope to further their improvement.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, they remained inferior to Luo Zheng's powers, so they were unable to stop him.</p>

  <p>In the innermost room of the temple, a thick wall covered with small holes stood. Several warriors of the Bearing race busily gathered in front of it before Luo Zheng arrived. They were ordered to use their Sumeru Spaces to absorb as much soul crystal as they could.</p>

  <p>They diligently did as they were ordered.</p>

  <p>However, the design of the temple prohibited them from maximizing their collection. They were not fast enough. Although they worked nonstop, they only managed to absorb a small part of the soul crystal.</p>

  <p>"Everyone get out!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shouted coldly.</p>

  <p>The several warriors were horrified. They were afraid of being killed by Luo Zheng, so they immediately ran for their lives.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's method of taking the soul crystal was simple and crude. He pressed his hand on the wall and gently patted it. The wall burst open and revealed a huge stone covered by tiny holes, like a beehive. Each hole emitted a bright light.</p>

  <p>He simply lifted the huge stone and walked out like it was no big deal.</p>

  <p>The members of the Bearing race were mortified. They were losing the little hope they had.</p>

  <p>As he walked out of the temple, Luo Zheng tossed the stone towards Dorothy.</p>

  <p>Dorothy gasped at the sight of the stone. "You have taken all the soul crystal of the Bearing race!"</p>

  <p>The stone was called Myriad Holes Stone. It stored the soul crystal perfectly. The Bearing race sealed the stone in the thick wall when they built the temple. Some disciples of the race would also store the soul crystal they found on the Other Shore in it. The Taiyi Heaven Palace also used such stone to store their soul crystal.</p>

  <p>"Absorb the soul crystal into your Sumeru Space quickly before something happens," Luo Zheng said with a soft chuckle.</p>

  <p>Dorothy nodded and put her hand on the stone. The soul crystal in the small holes gathered inside the square space in her hand.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stared at Dorothy's square space and thought to himself, 'I should get another Sumeru Space.'</p>

  <p>Unlike his soul, his corporeal body couldn't hold things so he always had to ask Dorothy to keep items for him. She would then transfer the items to his Soul of Light. It was very inconvenient. He wondered if the Taiyi Heaven Palace would be able to provide his corporeal body with a Sumeru Space.</p>

  <p>As soon as all the soul crystal was kept by Dorothy, Luo Zheng tossed the stone onto a pile of ruins that used to be a part of the temple. Together, they left the place.</p>

  <p>When they arrived at the gate of the temple of the Taiyi Heaven Palace, Luo Zheng's body quietly retreated from the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>This time, he was able to get a lot of soul crystal. Though the Bearing race had transferred a part of it before his arrival. What he acquired was enough for eight warriors to achieve Indigo Souls.</p>

  <p>Eventually, Luo Zheng's Soul of Light returned to the temple of the Taiyi Heaven Palace. As soon as it did, he grabbed Dorothy into the secret room. Dorothy quickly transferred all the soul crystal to him.</p>

  <p>"Shouldn't we share it equally?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"No, I don't need it," Dorothy replied.</p>

  <p>It was Luo Zheng who obtained the soul crystal, anyway. She merely helped in safekeeping it. She didn't think she deserved any of it.</p>

  <p>Since Dorothy was so determined not to take any, Luo Zheng didn't insist. He just decided to generously share it with her in the future should she need it.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had been itching to go to higher stages of the Other Shore since he had the Indigo Soul. But considering what happened that day, his plan would be delayed.</p>

  <p>"I wanted to go to Stage Thirteen with you, but it looks like I wouldn't be able to do that," Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Dorothy blushed and giggled. "Let's go back first. I'm sure the Taiyi Heaven Palace and Bearing race are in chaotic states now!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng then retreated from the Other Shore. With the space twisting a bit, he was sitting in his room again.</p>

  <p>When he removed the enchanted barrier and opened the door, he saw three guests in the courtyard.</p>

  <p>Goran, Winchell, and Qiu Yinhe stood in the middle of the courtyard while Trish and Carrie served them tea. It looked like they were there to visit Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Trish and Carrie looked worried.</p>

  <p>Yudie stood on the second floor just as worried as Trish and Carrie. They wondered what Luo Zheng had done wrong.</p>

  <p>Although she couldn't see through the real strength of these men, for some reason unknown to her, the aura the men exuded made her tremble.</p>

  <p>Yudie couldn't figure out why such figures came to visit Luo Zheng and were willing to wait quietly in the courtyard. She wanted to call Luo Zheng out, but before she could, the three men stopped her as if they were afraid of disturbing him.</p>
