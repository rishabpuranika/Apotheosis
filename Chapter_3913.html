<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3913 A Sneak Attack </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Eternal Realm masters wouldn't take long to cross an entire province.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven and the people chasing him were far stronger than ordinary Eternal Realm warriors, and as a result, were much faster.</p>

  <p>That was why Othniel and Herbert had to make a quick decision.</p>

  <p>"Should we avoid them or fight?" Herbert asked, puzzled.</p>

  <p>The goal that was Herbert's priority was to subvert the Pear Hill and help the Element Spirit race complete the Purge Way.</p>

  <p>He didn't have an opinion about Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, or even Zheng. It was purely a matter of stance on the future.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Othniel looked hesitant.</p>

  <p>Their previous attack against the Oneness Sky Palace had been a complete failure. The people belonging to all the forces involved, like the Divine Farmer race, the Bearing race, and the New Moon race had died or escaped during the war. Even Claire had been killed.</p>

  <p>Now, Fuxi's and the Snake Goddess's strength had greatly increased, and with the help of Eastern Emperor Taiyi and the other two Chaos Ancient Gods, Pear Hill had become an invincible force.</p>

  <p>If the Grandmaster of Heaven were to be defeated or even killed by them, what would await him and Herbert before the Pear Hill?</p>

  <p>These thoughts lingered in Othniel's mind for a while before he made his decision. "We should fight!" he said eventually.</p>

  <p>He had barely finished saying this when blue dust appeared in his huge eye.</p>

  <p>If one looked carefully, they'd realize that the blue dust motes were numerous cubes the size of a fist. They only looked tiny like dust before Othniel's huge form.</p>

  <p>The blue cubes disappeared from Othniel's eye and appeared to the east of the Taoism Province, floating irregularly in the air.</p>

  <p>These cubes were insignificant to the powerful warriors who had activated the Wild God Bodies.</p>

  <p>Gerald warned the others as he noticed the sudden appearance of the blue dust. "Be careful! They're inverse spaces released by Othniel!"</p>

  <p>The moment Gerald alerted his companions, Othniel activated the cubes.</p>

  <p>The blue spaces, originally the size of a fist, expanded rapidly to a width of about one million feet each. These inverse spaces instantly filled up the space at the south of the Taoism Province.</p>

  <p>These inverse spaces were a special type of space. There seemed to be nothing inside, but they were, in fact, filled with a special energy.</p>

  <p>Gerald, the Snake Goddess, and the others felt like they were running in water the moment they were trapped in these spaces. Their speed slowed down considerably.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven was also caught up in an inverse space, but Othniel could control these spaces at will. Under his control, the inverse spaces before the Grandmaster of Heaven quickly turned back into the size of a fist.</p>

  <p>Once his path was cleared, the Grandmaster of Heaven regained his former speed and in just a few seconds, had left the Snake Goddess's group far behind.</p>

  <p>The real Fuxi, who was in the Pear Hill, became worried as he witnessed this scene unfold. He turned around and told Zheng, "I'll leave the great array in your care. I have to go and help them!"</p>

  <p>Saying thus, he created a space channel and entered it in a flash. In just a second, he was gone.</p>

  <p>The great array that the real Fuxi had mentioned to Zheng had something to do with the Ear Mice.</p>

  <p>The Ear Mouse race had always been a force to be reckoned with in the Source World. This race was omnipresent and extremely rich.</p>

  <p>Yellow Thearch had tried to befriend the Ear Mouse race many times, but the Ear Mice had always stayed neutral. They seemed uninterested in both the Purge Way and the Finale Way.</p>

  <p>Every businessman was believed to always be on the fence. Yellow Thearch didn't really care about what the Ear Mice thought as long as they didn't side with the Pear Hill.</p>

  <p>But King leuan's real intentions were not what it showed the world.</p>

  <p>The Ear Mice's great fortune relied on their huge numbers, making it impossible for them to follow the Purge Way.</p>

  <p>A long time ago, the Ear Mice had secretly allied themselves with the Pear Hill.</p>

  <p>King leuan was at the Eternal Realm, but its strength wasn't even noteworthy among the other Eternal Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>However, no one in the Source World could compete with it in terms of wealth.</p>

  <p>The divine crystals that King Ieuan had collected for so many years might account for more than half of the amount in the entire Source World.</p>

  <p>These divine crystals contained pure energies. Many people coveted such a great fortune but none of them knew where the Ear Mice hid them.</p>

  <p>Even Zheng had known nothing about this until recently. He was astonished that all the divine crystals were hidden in the Pear Hill. With her unprecedented talent, the Snake Goddess had used the divine crystals to set up an array, which had turned out to be a huge trap.</p>

  <p>Even a Chaos Ancient God would find it hard to escape this trap alive if they were to fall into it.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess and Fuxi had previously wanted to lure Othniel or Herbert into this trap, but neither of them had dared approach the Pear Hill.</p>

  <p>Because of this, the people in the hill had been forced to leave their field and fight.</p>

  <p>Now that Fuxi had left to join the battle, the great array was handed over to Zheng.</p>

  <p>Once Fuxi left, the lines on the surface of the jadeite platform began to flash, a green light gathering beneath Zheng's feet.</p>

  <p>Zheng had now become the center of the array.</p>

  <p>The whole of Pear Hill instantly became translucent in Zheng's view, and a massive amount of divine crystals appeared before his eyes.</p>

  <p>"There are so many divine crystals!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>The divine crystals were equally distributed around the Pear Hill as they circled around it.</p>

  <p>The Pear Hill was nearly as broad as the province where it lay, and these divine crystals occupied close to one seventh of its entire surface. Counting these divine crystals one by one would undoubtedly lead to an astronomical figure.</p>

  <p>"If we fully activate the energy of these divine crystals, will it be enough to destroy the entire Pear Hill?" Zheng asked, dazed.</p>

  <p>"There's no need for so many. Ten percent of them will do," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said.</p>

  <p>It was not difficult to invade a defenseless Pear Hill. Any Eternal Realm warrior could do that alone. However, this great array that had been formed by divine crystals had the power to kill even a Chaos Ancient God.</p>

  <p>At the center of this great array sat several powerful creatures, King Ieuan of the Ear Mouse race in the lead.</p>

  <p>When the Snake Goddess had asked for help a few days ago, the core members of the Ear Mouse race had come to preside over this great array in succession.</p>

  <p>Zheng observed the goings-on for a while before he looked around, only to meet his sister's gaze. The siblings exchanged a warm smile.</p>

  <p>As the battle went on, the fate of the Pear Hill had now been handed over to them.</p>

  <p>An intense fight was taking place in the Taoism Province, while the Pear Hill was strangely quiet in contrast, as if they weren't involved in the war.</p>

  <p>The disciples and the other members on the Pear Hill were relieved for a moment.</p>

  <p>They couldn't participate in the higher-level battle. All they could do was pray silently as they remained in the Pear Hill.</p>

  <p>It was then that a huge figure suddenly appeared in the sky above the Pear Hill. It was a creature with white hair all over the body.</p>

  <p>The appearance of this creature caused an invisible chill to quickly spread over them from above.</p>

  <p>The temperature dropped sharply, and silver white frosts began to spread down from the top of the Pear Hill, like a circular ice ring blooming around it.</p>

  <p>Both Zheng and Yan raised their heads to try to get a clear look at the figure clearly. Their faces hardened, almost in unison.</p>

  <p>This was Lamont, the third Chaos Ancient God who had followed the Purge Way.</p>

  <p>Once he arrived at the Pear Hill, he decided to ignore the fight in the Taoism Province and attacked the Pear Hill first.</p>

  <p>He probably believed that since Fuxi had left, there was no one left to guard the Pear Hill, and that it would be an easy task to destroy the hill.</p>

  <p>The temperature was still dropping rapidly, many rocks in the Pear Hill freezing and shattering into pieces with a cracking burst.</p>

  <p>If the temperature continued to drop, all living creatures in the Pear Hill would freeze to death.</p>

  <p>Yan wouldn't allow this to happen. She stretched out her hands, and under her control, the Cloud Cover Array worked to block the deadly cold air attacking the Pear Hill from outside.</p>
