<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The divine citizens of Misty Mountain Village didn't believe that Master Evil had returned.</p>

  <p>Such a legend had been spread over a long time, after all. Most of the characters in these legends were already ancient figures— their return wasn't something people would easily accept.</p>

  <p>But Zheng had no doubt about it because it was he who personally released Master Evil.</p>

  <p>After being released, Master Evil and Wayne had rushed into Swirl Forest before the fairy palace was besieged by a group of vicious creatures from the divine land.</p>

  <p>At this point, Zheng wasn't sure whether or not these two had died under the hands of those ferocious beasts— he had also been worried that even with the two's strength to defy the heavens, they'd still have difficulty surviving against the vicious beasts.</p>

  <p>Now, it seemed that Zheng's worries were unnecessary. Master Evil had been imprisoned for so long that as soon as he was released, he wanted to restore his former glory. It was merely a coincidence that Master Evil's den was actually the Vast Sky Region.</p>

  <p>"If you don't believe me, I won't be the one coming here again. Next time, it will be Master Evil himself," said the chief of the Sun Moon Village.</p>

  <p>A strong mid-rank True God was also a powerful figure in the divine land.</p>

  <p>With such a backer, his Sun Moon Village's position could be greatly enhanced in the future. It pleased the chief, believing that Zheng would compromise and no one was willing to seek death before a True God.</p>

  <p>"I believe you," Zheng said faintly.</p>

  <p>Hearing Zheng's words, the Sun Moon Village's chief and his subordinates immediately heaved a sigh of relief, knowing that they didn't have to fight Zheng, a proving godly warrior. If they could make him retreat on his own in the face of such difficulties, they'd achieve ideal results.</p>

  <p>"Since that's the case, you can persuade the villagers of Misty Mountain Village to leave obediently or you can leave on your own. Let us deal with the villagers," the chief said with a smile.</p>

  <p>The members of the Misty Mountain Village weren't expecting Zheng to truly believe the chief's words— they were stunned. "Tianxing, you can't just accept what they say. They mean only to scare us."</p>

  <p>"The Sun Moon Village is a mere dilapidated village that has survived for tens of thousands of years. How could they possibly find a True God to help them?"</p>

  <p>"…"</p>

  <p>Zheng ignored their words and continued speaking to the Sun Moon Village's chief. "I believe that Master Evil has returned, but I will not leave. If you want me to go, you can ask Master Evil to come here personally."</p>

  <p>Everyone was thinking that Zheng had compromised, hence the matter would be resolved easily. But hearing his words, all their expressions turned stiff.</p>

  <p>It was clear, then, that Zheng had his own plans.</p>

  <p>Zheng had just entered the divine land— integrating himself was bound to be extremely difficult. If only he could obtain the help of Master Evil, it would be great.</p>

  <p>"Right… if you really can, get that Master Evil to come personally!"</p>

  <p>"I want to see where your Sun Moon Village will go to find a True God!</p>

  <p>If there really is a True God, must your Sun Moon Village kick us out personally?"</p>

  <p>"I also want to meet the legendary True God!"</p>

  <p>But the members of Misty Mountain Village misunderstood Zheng's intentions— they thought that Zheng did not truly believe the words of the Sun Moon Village's chief and was merely taking advantage of the situation.</p>

  <p>The chief's face turned ashen and his voice became ice-cold once again.</p>

  <p>"Do you know the consequences of Master Evil coming here personally?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I do," Zheng said with a nod.</p>

  <p>"Good!" A cold laugh came from the chief as he led his people to turn back and leave— he couldn't persuade Zheng to leave and expel the villagers of the Misty Mountain Village, so he had no choice but to have Master Evil come personally and deal with them.</p>

  <p>Undoubtedly, he would be convicted of failing to complete the mission, but more importantly, he also knew that Zheng and the people from the Misty Mountain Village would fall to death in Master Evil's hands.</p>

  <p>After the Sun Moon Village people left, the villagers in hiding began to come out. Most of them looked victorious— they were happy about chasing away the Sun Moon Village without any bloodshed.</p>

  <p>"So many years have passed. The Sun Moon Village still doesn't have many people. Their strength is average, but their bragging skills are rather impressive. They talk of obtaining a True God? What a joke."</p>

  <p>"You're right. Master Evil is said to be a great figure in the northern part of the Vast Sky Region. Why would such a person appear in a small village?"</p>

  <p>"Exactly!"</p>

  <p>In the eyes of the Misty Mountain Village, the Sun Moon Village was not much stronger than them. It was merely a village full of stupidity— they used to be afraid of the Sun Moon Village, but now that they had Tianxing, they no longer had much respect for the other.</p>

  <p>But Zheng's next words made the villagers' hearts grow cold.</p>

  <p>"Master Evil has indeed returned."</p>

  <p>"He's back? You're kidding, right?" said a villager with a nervous chuckle. It was difficult to outright believe in Zheng's words.</p>

  <p>"It's no joke," Zheng shook his head. "Master Evil has indeed returned to the Vast Sky Region. Their village leader did not lie because I met Master Evil personally not long ago."</p>

  <p>The originally noisy atmosphere at the entrance of Misty Mountain Village instantly froze into silence when Zheng's words resounded.</p>

  <p>"You… you're serious?" The villagers' expressions turned serious.</p>

  <p>The people of the Misty Mountain Village had no qualms about facing the Sun Moon Village, but even if they were given ten thousand extra forces, they wouldn't dare offend a True God.</p>

  <p>"It's true," Zheng confirmed. "But…" He wanted to find words that could offer them some comfort. Although Master Evil was powerful, he couldn't disobey Zheng's orders. But these divine citizens were probably too frightened and agitated to listen.</p>

  <p>"Then, what should we do?"</p>

  <p>"Let's just leave. It's said that Master Evil has committed all sorts of crimes. Back then, he had the power to do all evil things. But a powerful warrior defeated him and Master Evil was lost for many years. Is he really going to make a comeback?"</p>

  <p>"But the Misty Mountain Village has been left to us by generations of our ancestors…"</p>

  <p>"Our ancestors?! This person has been around much longer than them! If the legend is true, we have indeed occupied Master Evil's old territory."</p>

  <p>Zheng was speechless.</p>

  <p>Since the villagers were too agitated, Zheng couldn't be bothered to explain any longer.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile…in the Sun Moon Village The Muddy Moon Cave was originally abandoned for countless years— the entrance had also collapsed a long time ago.</p>

  <p>But during this period of time, the Sun Moon Village had reopened the Muddy Moon Cave's entrance and cleaned it meticulously. Soon after, it was classified as a forbidden area by the Sun Moon Village. No one was allowed to approach it.</p>

  <p>The Sun Moon Village's chief kneeled before the cave in respect.</p>

  <p>Lowering his voice, he said, "Master Evil, it is not that I have failed my mission. I don't know where the Misty Mountain Village got such a strong warrior to help them. Although he's only a proving godly warrior, his strength is indeed extraordinary. I'm very sensitive to soul theurgy, as you may know, and I found that proving godly warrior's soul may surpass the Gold Fighting Soul. His soul may even be a True God Soul!"</p>

  <p>After that, the chief didn't dare move an inch.</p>

  <p>"Nonsense! A mere world lord able to cultivate his soul into a Gold Fighting Soul is already too outstanding… but to have the True God Soul? I'm afraid that even the wealthy clans of the Floating Islands cannot do it." Master Evil's voice transmitted from the cave. There weren't many world lords with a Gold Fighting Soul— it was difficult to believe.</p>
