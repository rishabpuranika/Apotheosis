  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Strong gales are coming!"</p>

  <p>These gusts of howling winds were not invisible or colorless - there were golden lines embedded around them. With that, he was able to recognize what those were - the convective gusts of wind in the deep sky that were said to crush and destroy anything that got in them!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had seen such strong gusts of wind before.</p>

  <p>In order to cultivate the Stellar Body, he had to take advantage of the gravitational force of the stars to project his spiritual sense hundreds of millions of miles away. Every time he cultivated the Stellar Body, Luo Luo Zheng would have to pass through the layer of strong gales.</p>

  <p>However, in the past, it was only his spiritual sense that went through such strong gales. But this time, however, he was facing them head on, and it was his physical body that had to pass through them.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng knew that these strong gales would be able to destroy almost everything in their path. Even if Luo Zheng's body was a top-grade fairy weapon, he probably wouldn't be able to withstand them.</p>

  <p>With the intense wind coming nearer and nearer to him, Luo Luo Zheng twisted his body and drew a circle in the air. He then rapidly flew towards the downwind of the layer of gusts.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Francis followed closely behind.</p>

  <p>From his point of view, he couldn't wait to see Luo Luo Zheng get killed by the strong gales. Not one being would be willing to carry a slave seal and become someone else's slave. No one in their right mind would agree to not have control over their own life. Not to mention, he was a master at the fifth level of the Life and Death Realm.</p>

  <p>When he caught himself thinking this, though, he quickly shook his head, as if to shake it off. 'After all, ' he thought, furrowing his eyebrows. 'Luo Luo Zheng could control everything I do and could decide my life or death!'</p>

  <p>With this quick turn of direction, Luo Luo Zheng avoided the strong gales in the sky. At the same time, the huge Water-eyed Swallowing Beast charged forward to the gales head first. The violent gales sliced the back of the Water-eyed Swallowing Beast and caused huge cuts on its back in an instant!</p>

  <p>"Aooo!"</p>

  <p>When the Water-eyed Swallowing Beast came into contact with the gales, its back suddenly became a mess of flesh and blood. Fresh blood started gushing out of its wounds like a huge waterfall.</p>

  <p>With that, it stared resentfully at Luo Luo Zheng and Francis with its huge eyes. Then it lowered its head and started going down, slowly disappearing from their view.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the Water-eyed Swallowing Beast couldn't fly. It only managed to reach so high by relying on its powerful leap. If it could fly, then the chances of them getting caught by the creature was high.</p>

  <p>Floating silently above the clouds, Luo Luo Zheng felt a lingering fear in his heart. He glanced at Francis, who was beside him, and said, "The Water-Eyed Swallowing Beast has formed such a deep grudge for the four divine kingdoms. It's astonishing how this beast is actually going to kill any human it sees?"</p>

  <p>Francis wiped the sweat off his forehead and shook his head. "Perhaps it is right this Water-eyed Swallowing Beast's young cub that was stolen by the powerful warriors at the Soul Sea Realm."</p>

  <p>The beast's blood gushed out like a waterfall and colored the skies red when it spread and mingled with the clouds. If these clouds drifted into the Central Region or the divine kingdoms, they would probably cause a bloody rain. 'People think it would be an omen, ' thought Luo Luo Zheng passingly, as he stared at the stained horizon. Snapping out of his thoughts, he turned to Francis and said, "I think it would be better if we move ahead above the clouds," suggested Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Even though the storm in the Chaotic Ocean of Stars had temporarily stopped, it was still filled with all sorts of dangers.</p>

  <p>"Above the clouds? That would be even more dangerous!" Francis hurriedly said, a slightly fearful look flashing in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"It's also very dangerous above the clouds?" Luo Luo Zheng asked, his eyes gleaming with apprehension.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Luo Zheng finished speaking, a bitter smile appeared on Francis's face,</p>

  <p>"Danger is coming, Luo Luo Zheng. Let's go. We'll be safer under the clouds."</p>

  <p>At this moment, in the distant sea of clouds, Luo Luo Zheng noticed a few black shadows flying. Although they were blurry, he could still make out that they were a type of a huge bird.</p>

  <p>Although they didn't know how strong those birds were, it wasn't something they thought they could fight against.</p>

  <p>The two of them didn't talk anymore and instead dove into the sea of clouds. They returned to the Chaotic Ocean of Stars and continued to fly towards the Divine Kingdom Continent.</p>

  <p>Above the huge waves of the Chaotic Ocean of Stars, there was a large amount of dark red blood blobs. Needless to say, these were left behind by the Water-eyed Swallowing Beast who just got injured a while ago.</p>

  <p>As the two journeyed, they encountered so many dangers.</p>

  <p>For example, on the surface of the sea, a few reefs covered in mist suddenly appeared. They heard beautiful singing coming from them, the type of music that would seduce travelers to stop for a bit and rest.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng and Francis almost got hooked by it. It was only when Luo Luo Zheng approached the reef and he saw a few indistinct black figures standing on it that he was jolted into consciousness once again by the cyan dragon in his mind.</p>

  <p>Although he did not know what those terrifying shadows were, it was very clear that if he were to go near them, he would definitely die.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Francis just smiled and kept flying towards the reef.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had no choice but to use the slave seal to command Francis to follow him, effectively rescuing him from the claws of death.</p>

  <p>They traveled cautiously through the treacherous Chaotic Ocean of Stars after that. After more than ten days of travel, Luo Luo Zheng finally saw a continent in the distance.</p>
