<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Being outside the Mad Scorpion's body didn't mean they could get rid of the fog, Yolande was right about this. No matter how much they tried to move, they were taken to the abyss.</p>

  <p>All of them figured that they were unable to fight against the Dark Nether Death Light. If it had not been for the crab-shaped ornament on Luo Zheng's chest, all of them could have already been killed by the light.</p>

  <p>During such a threatening situation, they could only follow Yolande's advice.</p>

  <p>"What are these green-skinned creatures?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng asked, his curiosity evident on his face.</p>

  <p>"Esther guessed right. They are the aboriginals of this world," Yolande replied.</p>

  <p>"But why would they want to kill us?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng asked again.</p>

  <p>"They live inside the Mad Scorpion's body, and it's these aboriginals' duty to kill any intruders," Yolande answered.</p>

  <p>"What did you say that changed their minds?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng asked, glancing towards Yolande with a serious look on his face.</p>

  <p>"You'll get your answer very soon," she said, avoiding making any more statements.</p>

  <p>Even though they were trapped inside that vast net, they still moved forward. Quick on their feet, they passed along many rivers and mountains beneath them on their journey.</p>

  <p>The world inside the Mad Scorpion's body was more extensive than they had initially thought. Flying through the place took them two hours.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, they found a wooden wall standing right before them. Hundreds of sharp wooden sticks stood erect, serving as a defense for the city inside.</p>

  <p>It was a city that was built by those green-skinned creatures.</p>

  <p>Green-skinned guards surrounded the wooden wall, pacing back and forth for any strange movements and noises that might pose a threat. Some of them pulled the net, causing it to fly over the wall and land on a corner where a prison with iron fences stood.</p>

  <p>After unwrapping the large net where Luo Luo Zheng and the others were trapped, the green-skinned creatures raised their spears towards him and his companions. One of them pointed a finger at the door of the prison and urged them to walk inside.</p>

  <p>They all looked at Yolande. She blinked her eyes a few times, signaling that it was safe for them inside the prison. Taking the lead, they all walked to the door. The others followed closely behind her.</p>

  <p>Before Luo Luo Zheng could even enter the prison, a green-skinned creature raised a spear to block his path. The creature also said some gibberish that Luo Luo Zheng didn't understand.</p>

  <p>Looking down on his chest, Luo Luo Zheng saw that the tip of the spear was pointed straight at the space ring on his chest. Greed was painted all over the green-skinned creature's face.</p>

  <p>Even though Luo Luo Zheng didn't have a clue about what the creature was saying, he knew exactly what he wanted from him. It was the space ring on his chest.</p>

  <p>All of Luo Zheng's treasures and wealth were stored inside the space ring, including a large amount of heavenly essence. He even put the crab-shaped treasure which he used to resist the Dark Nether Death Light into that space ring. In addition, this space ring was given to him by Ning Yudie. How could he give it up to a stranger that easily?</p>

  <p>A morose look glinted on all the warriors' faces. That crab-shaped treasure was essential to their safety and survival. Without it to protect them from the Dark Nether Death Light, there was no chance of them getting out safe and sound. The moment they left the Mad Scorpion's body, they could instantly be killed by the Dark Nether Death Light.</p>

  <p>Letting a stranger rob them of something so important was out of the picture.</p>

  <p>"Don't you give it to him,"</p>

  <p>Esther snapped, looking straight into Luo Zheng's eyes.</p>

  <p>All of them had put on their savage faces. If that green-skinned creature insisted on taking the space ring from Luo Luo Zheng, they had no other choice but to fight. Even if they weren't able to utilize their life vitality at that moment, they were certain that their physical strength would suffice.</p>

  <p>The passivity that Luo Luo Zheng was showing at that time annoyed the green-skinned creature beyond belief. He groaned in his unique language and then reached out his hand, trying to take the space ring by himself. Clenching his fists, Luo Luo Zheng inhibited himself from punching him in the face. He knew quite well that he could've knocked that guard in just one move.</p>

  <p>To break the silence, Yolande said softly, "Luo Luo Zheng, just surrender your space ring and do as you're told."</p>

  <p>"But?" Luo Luo Zheng scowled. It wasn't that he didn't trust Yolande. Perhaps the good impression she left Luo Luo Zheng was able to convince him that she was probably right. To obtain the inheritance, he must agree with her and give his space ring up.</p>

  <p>But the ring was of utmost importance to Luo Luo Zheng. It devastated him to think that he was just going to let someone take it.</p>

  <p>"We'll get it back. Trust me on this," Yolande reassured him. "On top of that, those guards don't even know how to open it! Just trust me, please!"</p>

  <p>Hearing Yolande's words, Luo Luo Zheng contemplated on whether or not he was going to hand over the space ring. Deep inside, he really wanted to fight back. However, he made a compromise and decided on it. He pulled the space ring off his neck and handed it to the greedy guard.</p>

  <p>The green-skinned creature mumbled something and a sly smile appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>After he angrily squinted at the guard, he turned his back and entered the prison. The intention of killing him was constantly growing in Luo Zheng's heart.</p>

  <p>Upon Luo Luo Zheng entering the cell, the gates closed behind him with a loud bang.</p>

  <p>Turning to Yolande, Luo Luo Zheng glared, "No matter what your reason is behind all this, you have to give me an explanation right now!"</p>

  <p>Everyone looked at Yolande. They followed her advice all the way into that prison even if none of them wanted to be taken into captivity.</p>

  <p>Then, Yolande replied cautiously, "The inheritance you are looking for is hidden in the world inside the Mad Scorpion's body."</p>

  <p>"And then?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng wasn't at all surprised by that, nor was he satisfied with Yolande's answer. He wasn't a fool.</p>

  <p>Closing her eyes, she thought for a moment before continuing, "Just as you thought, the entire Dark Nether Cave was involved with the conflicts between two Supreme Lords. Actually, they were fighting for a fragment."</p>

  <p>"Supreme Lords?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes gleamed upon hearing so.</p>

  <p>It was because of the Transcendent Divine Might inherited by the red dragon that Luo Luo Zheng first heard of the Supreme Lord. A Supreme Lord called Lord Star created the Stellar Body. He must have mastered unimaginably formidable strength and power to make the Transcendent Divine Might.</p>

  <p>Even in the Upper World, there weren't many Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>Yolande nodded her head and answered, "Our human race can be divided into three major powers. The most influential one is the Lord of Original Sin who is controlling four thousand large worlds. The Lord of Oracle is the second power and he's now leading three thousand large worlds. The weakest power is the Lord of Thunder Punishment, with two thousand large worlds under his control."</p>

  <p>"If the powers of the human race are combined together, there would be a total of more than ten thousand worlds that they can use," Fabian stated, his eyes widened at that realization.</p>

  <p>Ascending to the Upper World was every warrior's dream. Because the humans who lived in the Sea God Continent were relatively weaker than the other races, Fabian and Jarrod initially thought that humans were also insignificant in the Upper World. It never crossed their minds that humans could command more than ten thousand big worlds.</p>

  <p>This also shocked Luo Luo Zheng. The cyan dragon once told him that humans had quite an influential existence in the Upper World, but he never expected it to be this major.</p>

  <p>The entire Genuine Dragon race could only control one big world.</p>

  <p>The humans, however, had the ability to put more than ten thousand big worlds under their control. Undeniably, they were doing an outstanding job up there.</p>

  <p>"I didn't expect our race to hold that kind of power in the Upper World,"</p>

  <p>Jarrod said, his expression completely swelled with pride.</p>

  <p>The two ogres standing nearby, Malcom and Rehaan, remained quiet. Their hearts skipped a beat when they heard what Yolande just said. Ogres had been boasting inside the Tower of Sin that they were the perfect race, while humans were feeble, weak and inferior. Humans were not a match to ogres when it came to talent, intelligence, strength and others.</p>

  <p>However, the excellence possessed by Luo Luo Zheng suggested that they were wrong.</p>

  <p>For some reason, humans somehow succeeded in gaining a menacing existence in the Upper World.</p>

  <p>At that particular moment, Xun appeared. Smiling softly, she said,</p>

  <p>"Controlling such a number of worlds is really impressive, but it is definitely something humans should not boast about. They don't even dare to put up a fight against the Demon Night!"</p>

  <p>Glancing at Xun, Yolande shook her head, "I admit that your race is strong, but you can't give birth to many babies. We couldn't surpass your race over the last one thousand years. What about a hundred years later?</p>

  <p>Will you have enough warriors from your race to fight against us by then?"</p>

  <p>Despite the fact that the Demon Night members were of absolute strength, they were quite weak in reproduction and enlarging their population.</p>

  <p>Back when the Demon Night race had conquered a large number of worlds, they were not able to find enough people to be stationed there. Now, however, they controlled no more than a thousand big worlds.</p>

  <p>"In the Upper World, a race's power isn't based solely on the number of worlds it has controlled. Am I right?" Xun argued.</p>

  <p>Yolande shook her head again and replied, "Let's drop this. We should focus more on the conflicts between Lord of Original Sin and Lord of Oracle. I didn't make it clear to Luo Luo Zheng before because I thought I shouldn't talk about these things before you."</p>

  <p>The truth was, Yolande was talking to Xun.</p>
