  <p>
</p>

  <p>When the white tiger climbed out from the woods outside the pink enchanted barrier, it saw Luo Luo Zheng. It sneaked up to Luo Luo Zheng with its big yellow eyes like a predator who found its prey.</p>

  <p>"Roar!"</p>

  <p>The white tiger roared. It was so loud that it could wake up the dead.</p>

  <p>The tranquility of the forest was disturbed. Strange animals ran wild. A flock of birds was flying, beasts were running wildly.</p>

  <p>The sound of the tiger's roar caused a vast wind as fierce as a tornado.</p>

  <p>This was no exaggeration.</p>

  <p>The strong wind passed through the pink enchanted barrier without resistance. It lifted Luo Luo Zheng up in the air and crashed him hard into a tree not far away.</p>

  <p>"Clash!"</p>

  <p>The wind hit Luo Zheng's body like a punch from an Illuminating Soul Realm master. His body was carved into the tree and he was unable to move.</p>

  <p>He coughed out some blood and his face looked helpless. It was a good thing that he hit a soft trunk instead of hard rock. If it was the latter, he could've died in an instant.</p>

  <p>"Where the hell is this place? Where are all these strange things coming from?" gasped Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>It took him a little rest before he could move his body. He tried to pull himself out the trunk, but it was painful. Luckily, his body was as hard as a spiritual weapon that could withstand any tremendous impact.</p>

  <p>When he finally got out from the tree hole, he saw the white tiger still waiting for him outside the enchanted barrier like a predator ready to hunt.</p>

  <p>When the white tiger sensed a slight movement, it raised its head with heightened alert.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng quickly hid into the tree hole. But this time, the tiger didn't roar and rushed directly to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The white tiger dashed towards the pink enchanted barrier. Luo Luo Zheng blinked his eyes and prepared himself for anything that could happen. If the enchanted barrier could not stop the white tiger, then it would be the end of him.</p>

  <p>Just when the tiger got in contact with the pink enchanted barrier, a spark came out from the surface. Soon, a bolt of lightning enveloped the white tiger.</p>

  <p>Little by little, the white tiger's body started to perish. It started with its fur, then its flesh and blood, and finally its skeleton until nothing was left. When the beast disappeared, a huge demon core fell on the ground with a loud bang. One could only imagine how heavy it was.</p>

  <p>It was indeed a massive demon core.</p>

  <p>The demon core was radiating a fantastic glow. A stream of energy was trapped in it that contained an infinite power that Luo Luo Zheng didn't know of yet.</p>

  <p>'If the energy in this demon core is released, it could destroy the whole Eastern Region.' This was all Luo Luo Zheng could think of now.</p>

  <p>"I wonder how much I can make for it if I sell it in the Eastern Region market," Luo Luo Zheng sighed as he looked at the demon core lying outside the pink enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>He squatted by the edge of the pink enchanted barrier admiring the demon core. It was lying in front of him, but he just couldn't get it.</p>

  <p>For one, it was too big for his space ring.</p>

  <p>And if not for its size, Luo Luo Zheng could still not get it because of the pink enchanted barrier. It was a line that no one dared to cross. He had seen what happened to that white tiger that tried to pass through the enchantment. Even for a half-step into the nature level human like him, there was no chance he could survive it if he tried.</p>

  <p>He could only shake his head in frustration. There was nothing he could do at this moment because he wasn't strong enough.</p>

  <p>On the second thought, this was surely a magical place. But where was this place exactly? And where did that tremendous creature come from?</p>

  <p>Good thing that the pink enchantment protected him. He could not imagine the disaster if the white tiger got into the Eastern Region. Could the Emperor of the Burning Sky Empire and the head of the Cloud Sect survive? No one knew for sure.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was lost in his thoughts for a while but soon realized that he couldn't just wander around. He had to stay focus so he could find his way out.</p>

  <p>The strange forest was big, and Luo Luo Zheng felt like an ant as he explored his way out.</p>

  <p>Aside from the tall and sturdy trees, there was not even a shadow of other creatures in the forest. This was because the pink enchanted barrier was keeping them out.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng thought that if there was a strange creature even a worm, his life would be at grave danger.</p>

  <p>In the middle of the vast forest, Luo Luo Zheng found a road as wide as a thousand feet. From its width, he could tell that it was made for something else and not for a human to walk on it. Luo Luo Zheng guessed that it was made especially for giants which were a thousand of his size.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng followed the forest path and ran at full speed for an hour until he saw a colorful Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>The Immortal Mansion was a feast for the eyes. The buildings and pavilions were filled with luxurious ornaments and displays. It radiated mysterious lights of the seven colors that never existed in the human world.</p>

  <p>The Immortal Mansion was in the middle of the pink enchanted barrier. At the center of the Immortal Mansion was a pink ray rising to the sky where it spread throughout the place that formed like a pink curtain.</p>

  <p>"Oh, so that's where the pink enchanted barrier comes from. I wonder who the master of this wonderful Immortal Mansion is. Maybe a fairy built this place," Luo Luo Zheng thought. The only fairy he could think of was from the legend. But he wasn't sure because he had never met the legendary fairy.</p>

  <p>'What could be the message that Chase left in the Weapon Refining Principle? And what does it have to do with this palace?' Luo Luo Zheng was lost in his thoughts again as he walked towards the palace.</p>

  <p>He arrived at the gate of the Immortal Mansion and was more amazed than before.</p>

  <p>The gate was at least five thousand feet high and colorful stones were embedded on it. He started to imagine how tall the Immortal Mansion master could be.</p>

  <p>The gate of the Immortal Mansion was open. Luo Luo Zheng looked at it and saw a three-floor high threshold. He walked towards the edge of the threshold and leaped upward. Soon he was flying across the threshold like a sparrow hawk.</p>

  <p>As he jumped across the threshold, he saw dozens of people standing at the gate, all dressed elegantly. Luo Luo Zheng knew that these people were all from the top seven noble clans.</p>

  <p>They all looked tensed as if watching something important. But Luo Luo Zheng attracted their attention with his loud entrance and lousy appearance.</p>

  <p>"Hey, what's going on? I thought we kicked all of them out?"</p>

  <p>"I told you. We should have killed all the people from the Bamboo Leaf Sect to save them from passing."</p>

  <p>"Hey, the Huang Clan wouldn't do such deceitful thing. Everyone knows what we are doing but we could only care less. No one will dare to fight us," one of them said.</p>

  <p>A long-haired woman from the crowd glanced at Luo Luo Zheng and subtly said,</p>

  <p>"Yves, kill that guy. Cut off his head and hang him in the Dragon Valley.</p>

  <p>He should be a reminder that those who break in will face death."</p>

  <p>Yves stepped forward from the crowd with a weird smile on his face. He slowly took out a dagger hanging on his waist and flipped it in his hand.</p>

  <p>Yves's dagger had a snake-like blade and was longer than general ones.</p>

  <p>As he walked towards Luo Luo Zheng, life vitality suddenly gathered under his feet and soon turned to black fog.</p>

  <p>"Damn! That black fog again!" sneered Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The top seven noble clan men were irrational and tyrannical, and they would kill people as they wished. Luo Luo Zheng was familiar with their temper as he had faced some of them before.</p>

  <p>These clansmen were superior and would deal fairly and reasonably only with the top seven noble clans. The lives of the other people outside the seven noble clans meant nothing to them, and they would kill them whenever they pleased.</p>

  <p>With these in mind, Luo Luo Zheng had thought of the only way to deal with them ? that was to kill all of them.</p>

  <p>Kill them all until they could feel fear!</p>

  <p>The life vitality could be changed depending on its owner. For most killers, they turned their life vitality into black fog. Luo Luo Zheng had encountered this form twice already.</p>

  <p>The first time was his battle with the Black and White Fiends. The black fog produced by the Black Fiend did not harm him at all. He captured the Black Fiend with his strong soul and killed him in an instant.</p>

  <p>The second time was when he challenged Demon King Aldrich's holy fire. It was more powerful than the Black Fiend's black fog. The demon's holy fire could isolate the spirit, block the sight, and corrode everything in its way.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng could tell from Yves' looks that he was an assassin. He assessed that Yves' black fog could be stronger than the Black and White Fiends'. But it didn't matter to Luo Luo Zheng because he was determined to put an end to this.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stood still with his back against the high threshold and watched Yves.</p>

  <p>As Yves came closer to his prey, the black fog diffused and surrounded Luo Luo Zheng. As soon as the black fog covered Luo Zheng's sight, Yves quickly made his move.</p>

  <p>Yves stirred the black fog like a weightless wind, and it rolled over repeatedly.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stood still with his arms crossed and the broken flying knife in his hand. He focused his gaze now on the rolling black fog, anticipating an attack.</p>

  <p>"What's your name?" a soft voice came through the black fog. Yves was a man, but he sure had a sissy voice.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing Yves' voice, Luo Luo Zheng frowned and said, "Let's cut the talking.</p>

  <p>Isn't killing what noble clans like you want? So why do you want to know my name?"</p>

  <p>"Oh! Don't get me wrong. This has nothing to do with the clan I represent. It's my rule to know the name of the person I will kill. As a ritual, you know. I have killed a total of 2, 461 people since I served the Pei Clan, and I can still remember all the names of the people I have killed," said Yves. Luo Luo Zheng could not see his face through the black fog but could hear his voice.</p>

  <p>"You don't need to know my name," he said indifferently.</p>

  <p>"Why is that?" asked Yves in a confident manner.</p>

  <p>"Knowing my name won't be any use for you because you'll be the one to die," Luo Luo Zheng said coldly but in confident.</p>
