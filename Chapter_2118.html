<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2118 Misunderstanding </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The entirety of the divine land was divided into multiple regions.</p>

  <p>The four largest regions were the East, the West, the North, and the South; and their corresponding divine trees were the Ray Tree, the Sunrest Tree, the Lofty Tree, and the Hidden Tree.</p>

  <p>The four divine trees each had their own unique and miraculous abilities.</p>

  <p>It could also be said that they kept the divine land stable, and it was because of them that the divine land constantly drew in chaotic energy and converted it to vitality between the heaven and earth.</p>

  <p>In addition to the four great regions and the central Time Sea, there were many other regions in the divine land as well.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng roughly understood them, he couldn't memorize every single one of them. However, he knew that he was in the Vast Sky Region as of the moment.</p>

  <p>He had tried to learn about the situation from the little boy on the back of the bull, but the little boy didn't know much and gave him a lot of irrelevant answers. Nevertheless, Zheng quickly got a rough grasp of the whole situation.</p>

  <p>It turned out the so-called divine citizens were actually mortals from the divine land.</p>

  <p>These divine citizens either did not cultivate or they had mediocre talents. Despite that, they were still much stronger than the mortals in the universe.</p>

  <p>For instance, they were able to reclaim the vast and boundless vegetable field on their own.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, not even a Life and Death Realm warrior in the universe could easily dig out such a vegetable field. Only the warriors of the Soul Sea Realm could do so with their physical power, and they could barely even. However, ordinary divine citizens in the divine land could do it.</p>

  <p>In other words, every single divine citizen of the divine land was born to be a super powerful warrior.</p>

  <p>It was no wonder when Zheng had obtained Holy Jay's strength source, the Holy Being warned him that pure power was nothing in the divine land.</p>

  <p>"Such a large vegetable field, how many divine citizens are needed to reclaim it?" Zheng asked again. The wide vegetable field seemed endless.</p>

  <p>Thus, it would need a large number of people if they wanted to reclaim it. In any case, Zheng wanted to know how many divine citizens lived in the place.</p>

  <p>However, the little boy just rolled his eyes at Zheng and said, "Who said we have to dig up the field ourselves? We have cattle." He patted his Ed as he spoke, who in turn responded with a low 'moo.'</p>

  <p>At that moment, Zheng couldn't help but feel a bit awkward when he heard the boy's words.</p>

  <p>Apparently, the village where the little boy was from only had around four thousand divine citizens. It was just a nameless little village in the Vast Sky Region.</p>

  <p>All of those divine citizens depended on farming to make a living, specifically growing Jade Immortal Rice.</p>

  <p>Although the divine citizens were strong and formidable, they were still unable to absorb the vitality between heaven and earth in the divine land-</p>

  <p>-and it was why they still had to eat grains and other food. Then again, the food in the divine land was different, so it might be the source of the divine citizens' strength.</p>

  <p>The Collapsing Mountain race Zheng had met in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land were also in the same situation. They ate the flesh of all kinds of beasts and although they didn't cultivate, they could still become super powerful warriors.</p>

  <p>The bull continued to walk slowly and after some time, it finally reached the edge of the vegetable field.</p>

  <p>When Zheng had entered the divine land, he initially saw just a vegetable field. It even gave him the illusion that the divine land was just a vegetable field. Only now did he see some different sights.</p>

  <p>There was a mountain road at the edge of the vegetable field, and in the middle of the mountain was a lonely village.</p>

  <p>It was already nightfall, and the village was slowly filled with light from the households.</p>

  <p>After Ed walked to the village entrance, the little boy suddenly stood up.</p>

  <p>He smiled at Zheng and clapped his hands in a certain rhythm.</p>

  <p>Shadowy figures appeared after the little boy's claps, and behind the figures were spears.</p>

  <p>While Zheng did not activate his spiritual sense, he still had quite the sensitive soul perception as he felt the figures' killing intent almost instantly. However, they remained hidden in the shadows and did not charge forward.</p>

  <p>'This little boy...' He maintained a stoic facade, but he felt like the boy had tried to lure him to this place and signaled to his fellow villagers using the clapping of his hands. He was afraid that he might be in danger.</p>

  <p>However, he had no ill will towards these divine citizens. Why did they do this? Confusion was written all over his face.</p>

  <p>Just then, the little boy suddenly moved. Ed underneath him lowered its head and with a little slip, he slid down the bull's neck and straight to the ground. His body rolled forward, then he swiftly rushed into the village and shouted, "Everyone, quickly make your move!"</p>

  <p>The boy moved in an extremely nimble manner. Zheng naturally wanted to stop the little boy from escaping and he could do that with just a single thought. Yet, he didn't do anything. He wanted to see what the little boy was up to.</p>

  <p>"Moo!"</p>

  <p>Ed beneath Zheng's feet let out a cry and also started to shake its back in an attempt to dismantle him.</p>

  <p>But, Zheng's feet were like nails that were firmly hammered into the bull's back. No matter how much Ed swayed, Zheng remained perfectly still and standing on its back.</p>

  <p>"Come on! Hurry up!"</p>

  <p>"Surround that brat!"</p>

  <p>"Don't let him get away!"</p>

  <p>...</p>

  <p>The divine citizens in the dark charged forward at the same time with long spears in their hands. The man at the helm gripped his weapon tightly and stabbed at Zheng's face without any hesitation.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>"Your strength is actually not bad. If you had hit an ordinary warrior of the Soul Sea Realm, then he would probably die or get injured.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the aim is too poor," Zheng muttered calmly.</p>

  <p>Once the divine citizens had made their move, Zheng thought that his previous guess was right.</p>

  <p>They were still different from the Collapsing Mountain race, though.</p>

  <p>While the Collapsing Mountain race had undergone continuous trainings and were considered as proper martial artists, the divine citizens did not receive proper training and only relied on physical strength. Zheng thought that if they just stabbed randomly with their spears, how could they possibly hurt him?</p>

  <p>Zheng only had to tilt his head slightly to the side even if he was rained with a barrage of spear attacks. One spear was thrust right through the side of his face. He was only half an inch away from the spear.</p>

  <p>That divine citizen was startled for a moment, but he thought that he had almost stabbed Zheng. He retracted his spear and impaled Zheng again--but the second strike ended up the same as the first; it was still a mere half an inch away from Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the other divine citizens also raised their spears and stabbed forward.</p>

  <p>Even with the many strikes that were all aimed at Zheng, all he had to execute was his Eight Smoky Melodies. His whole body danced lightly on the back of the bull like a willow leaf while all the spears slid a bit too close along his skin.</p>

  <p>Every strike lacked a tad bit in something, but from start to finish, not even a single spear had been able to touch Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Come on everyone! We can't let him escape!"</p>

  <p>"Alas, I almost stabbed him to death!"</p>

  <p>"He is quite lucky, but it won't last long."</p>

  <p>The divine citizens had always thought that they were close to stabbing Zheng, so they thrust their spears harder with every try.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the boy who hid at one side examined Zheng's indifferent expression. His large eyes were wide with shock when he realized that the man on the bull's back was just toying with them.</p>

  <p>It was known that the divine citizens were not trained professionally.</p>

  <p>Even though they were exceptionally strong, they couldn't hold out for too long by just using their strength. After less than two minutes, many of them were too tired to the point that they were gasping for air. They held their spears and stared at Zheng, dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>The few remaining divine citizens who still persisted decided to stop as well. They weren't stupid; after all this entire time, they hadn't even touched Zheng's clothes. Their differences in strength were too much. They all thought that this brat was simply toying with them.</p>

  <p>Zheng stood on the back of the bull and surveyed the divine citizens.</p>

  <p>"Everyone, why did you attack me?" he asked coldly.</p>

  <p>As soon as his voice died down, the divine citizen who was at the helm angrily shouted, "There's no need to say anything else. If you want to kill us, just do it. We members of the Misty Mountain Village will not leave this place!"</p>

  <p>"Right, this Misty Mountain is a clan land that has been passed down by our ancestors for generations. Why should we let you drive us away?" another divine citizen furiously chimed in. Suddenly, the crowd parted as someone rushed forward.</p>

  <p>"I, I'm going to kill you!"</p>

  <p>The strongest divine citizen among the lot held his long spear and charged towards Zheng once again.</p>

  <p>Zheng raised his eyebrows as he gripped the divine citizen's long spear. The Eight Path Platforms in his body burst and exerted a powerful force.</p>

  <p>When the divine citizen stabbed him with the spear, the weapon had gotten crushed with an exploding sound.</p>

  <p>The rest of the divine citizens were stunned in silence. "Is there any misunderstanding here?" Zheng asked in a deep voice.</p>
