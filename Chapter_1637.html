<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1637 Chaos In The Cities </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It was the voice of the mysterious girl.</p>

  <p>She had declared the rules of the Illusion Battlefield several times.</p>

  <p>Only now, the rules had suddenly changed.</p>

  <p>During the first stage of the Illusion Battlefield, with the protection of the law of the heavens, the major cities could become a place for the martial artists to protect themselves. As long as you didn't leave the main city, you would be completely safe.</p>

  <p>Even from those ace talents and Godly Geniuses.</p>

  <p>However, the further the battle progressed, the more intense the competition became.</p>

  <p>Most of the Illusion Points were gained by only a small number of people.</p>

  <p>Malachi, for example, had amassed a massive amount of Illusion Points and was ranked fourth in this supreme world. Before, as long as he didn't leave the main city, it would have been difficult for others to catch up.</p>

  <p>But now the rules had changed.</p>

  <p>The main city was no longer a haven for warriors. On the contrary, it was about to become a battleground.</p>

  <p>After all, almost all of the martial artists were gathered in one or another of the main cities. Only a small number had left the main city to explore the endless wilderness.</p>

  <p>But now, once the restrictions were removed, all warriors would be free to fight!</p>

  <p>Instantly, the small skulls that were lingering outside the city wall began to rush into the city and bit Luo Zheng's back. The skulls floated from his shoulders downwards, like a cape made of skulls.</p>

  <p>Malachi had been laughing wildly when the mysterious girl's voice rang out. He stopped, stunned.</p>

  <p>A smile surfaced to Luo Zheng's face as he looked at Malachi. "Why aren't you laughing?"</p>

  <p>Before, Malachi had not cared about his defeat. He had three Exemption Medallions in his hand. Even if Luo Luo Zheng managed to kill him three times, he would not lose any Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>Moreover, he would never have rushed out of the city after his Saint Killing Spear had been taken away. After all, Luo Luo Zheng couldn't do anything to him.</p>

  <p>But who could have known that the restrictions on fighting in the main city would be lifted at this very moment?</p>

  <p>A cold feeling swept across the back of his neck. He knew that as long as he maintained his position as the fourth ranked member of the supreme world, he would surely be promoted to the next stage of the Illusion Battlefield!</p>

  <p>And yet...</p>

  <p>Beginning to realize that he might be in danger, Malachi reflexively began to retreat backwards.</p>

  <p>He had lost the courage to fight Luo Luo Zheng head on. All he wanted now was to escape!</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the rest of the main city was in chaos.</p>

  <p>Not just the city, in fact.</p>

  <p>Across the Illusion Battlefield, all fifty supreme worlds had been upended.</p>

  <p>One by one each main city's warriors began to realize that they were now free to kill without restraint. Many immediately fled in all directions.</p>

  <p>The city was no longer a safe house, it would soon become a slaughterhouse.</p>

  <p>Elsewhere, in a different supreme world, a set of slender fingers interlocked and undulated, their movements copied by a set of huge swords. The fingers, followed by the swords formed a complex array that rained down upon the city.</p>

  <p>No matter if they were weak, strong, good at hiding, or good at attacking... almost all of the martial artists in this main city fell to these swords.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning tilted her head and surveyed the ruined city, her expression unsatisfied.</p>

  <p>"I got lucky. Since they weren't coming out of the main city, I was planning to leave? And look, the rules have changed!"</p>

  <p>What Mu Ning was doing, exterminating an entire city, might have been extreme, but it was far from rare.</p>

  <p>Recovering from this onslaught, several warriors turned to try and take down more of the warriors.</p>

  <p>In the outside world, the names on the pyramid began to shift. Several names shot up to the top of the list, like a surge of power.</p>

  <p>With their defeats, the majority of the lower ranking martial artists would have their names fluctuating across the board.</p>

  <p id="top_9">The names of the most powerful, on the other hand, were far more stable.</p>

  <p>These were the names of those at the very top of the food chain.</p>

  <p>Not only were they not challenged by this change of rules, but in fact, many had already reaped great benefit.</p>

  <p>In this new order, the strong could plunder more Illusion Points ?</p>

  <p>When she had previously controlled a main city, Lucille could only gain Illusion Points twice for every warrior that she killed.</p>

  <p>If she received too many points from the same warrior, the warriors stopped leaving the city. After all, once they left the city, Lucille would just kill them.</p>

  <p>For the moment, however, Lucille did not plan to collect more Illusion Points the old-fashioned way. No, instead she was going to rob the entire city at an extremely high speed. No one would be able to stop her anyway.</p>

  <p>However, this situation depended on what happened in the main city. The main city where Luo Luo Zheng was located was the exit to the Hall of Causality, and there were countless experts within. There were also a few ace talents, including Malachi.</p>

  <p>No one else, not even Luo Luo Zheng, could kill 80% of the martial artists in a city as easily as Mu Ning had.</p>

  <p>"Hailey, Janet, protect yourselves well." As soon as Luo Luo Zheng had given this warning, he whirled around to chase after Malachi.</p>

  <p>Malachi ran. Once he was hundreds of feet away from Luo Luo Zheng, he somersaulted and sped towards the sky. But Luo Zheng's reaction was just as fast, he followed right on his heels.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng had taken Malachi's Saint Killing Spear, he did not take away his Illusion Points. But that was about to change. Luo Luo Zheng only had one thought in his mind, and that was those Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Janet, Jeffrey, Coleman, Hailey, and Ansel were rapidly gathering together.</p>

  <p>The warriors, who had originally only planned to watch this fight, now had two choices. They could either fight each other or run for their lives like Malachi had. Many of them chose the second option, and fled towards the skies.</p>

  <p>Those with the fastest reactions managed to get away safely, fleeing into the vast and empty wilderness to take temporary refuge.</p>

  <p>Many of the rest were not so lucky. They were felled, and after giving half of their Illusion Points, they slowly "revived" in a corner of the main city.</p>

  <p>Janet and company were strong after all!</p>

  <p>If the five of them were to work together, they could take on even Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Other than a few ace talents in the main city, they would not encounter many powerful enemies here. The way they saw it, they were free to claim the spoils of conquest, and no one else would have the chance to plunder them!</p>

  <p>Here and there, sharp rays of light appeared and vanished. Waves of intensive life vitality fluctuated all over the area. This kind of scene could only be seen during a race war. There had been a rumor over the years that many races in the universe would eventually fall into chaos and launch an unprecedented war, and it looked like this war would be the true battle of the world of chaos!</p>

  <p>At this very moment, in the Illusion Battlefield, it was being rehearsed in advance.</p>

  <p>On the other side, Luo Luo Zheng did not allow Malachi to escape too far. At around ten thousand feet, Malachi found himself blocked. Luo Luo Zheng held the Saint Killing Spear deliberately in his hand. With one hand holding the spear and the other holding the sword, he looked at Malachi with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>"Should I kill you three times? Or five? You can choose."</p>

  <p>If he was killed once, he would lose half of his Illusion Points. Twice, he would lose three quarters of his points. If he was killed three times, he would lose seven eighths of his Illusion Points ?</p>

  <p>Malachi's expression turned gloomy. If Luo Luo Zheng killed him three times, his ranking would fall out of the 100, 000 range.</p>

  <p>That was a loss that he could not accept. With a flip of his hand, he brought out a purple long spear. This was a first-rank divine weapon, and it was also Malachi's life weapon.</p>

  <p>This spear was a sight to behold. After all, he was the son of a Supreme Lord. He owned things that an ordinary martial artist couldn't have. But still, this spear couldn't compare to the Saint Killing Spear.</p>
