  <p>
</p>

  <p>Joy's pretty eyes quietly scanned Nicholas' face.</p>

  <p>Zheng was at Nicholas' disposal. He could kill Zheng at any moment.</p>

  <p>Zheng took the lives of more than twenty consummate True Gods in exchange for his departure. This move of his made perfect sense, and as a low-rank True God, this was the best option he had.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, it wasn't enough.</p>

  <p>Joy heaved a deep sigh. She was aware that the Holy Beings would not agree to Zheng's condition.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the dark sky was filled with light.</p>

  <p>The head of the Sun Blind race, who had been silent all this time, said in a deep voice, "The Astronomical Transit Day is over."</p>

  <p>The head of the Sun Blind race was least bothered about Zheng's life. Even after he had acquired the jade seal and was being threatened by the Holy Beings, she had nothing to say.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The passageway that had formed in the middle of the nine pagodas began to disperse slowly.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings' attention suddenly shifted from Zheng to the nine pagodas.</p>

  <p>'Now, the time is right!'</p>

  <p>Joy's eyes lit up with sheer determination. There was no way that she'd let Mike's son die here.</p>

  <p>She jumped over on her tiptoes.</p>

  <p>Purple circular fog spread out from her feet.</p>

  <p>"Grand Purple Aura Technique! Purple Sky Land! Deluding Fog!"</p>

  <p>The purple fog spread throughout the island before the True Gods and Holy Beings could do anything about it.</p>

  <p>The fog transformed into numerous circular spaces, enveloping all the Holy Beings and True Gods in them.</p>

  <p>All the Holy Beings were engulfed by the revolving circles of the purple fog. The moment they were immersed in the circles, it seemed as if the Space Law around them had completely changed. Each circle of the purple fog was an independent space, and all the senses that were connected to this world had disappeared.</p>

  <p>"Has the Purple Sky Land descended? What is the Demi-holy Being of the Han Clan doing?" a Holy Being asked with a frown.</p>

  <p>"Joy, what are you up to?" Samuel shouted in desperation, his face pallid with fear.</p>

  <p>Some Holy Beings just sneered, observing the development of events quietly.</p>

  <p>The Deluding Fog was working wonders. It even trapped the Holy Beings, though the Holy Beings engulfed by it weren't panicking at all.</p>

  <p>With a sudden whoosh, Joy moved quickly, and with the help of the purple fog, she was standing right beside Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Let's go, now!" She grabbed Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>She intended to use the Grand Teleportation to leave this place with Zheng.</p>

  <p>If Joy could use the Grand Teleportation to leave this place, she could again implement the Grand Teleportation a few more times to escape from the hands of Nicholas.</p>

  <p>Their success or failure depended on the first attempt of using the Grand Teleportation.</p>

  <p>Nicholas also fell prey to the purple fog, but his expressions remained the same.</p>

  <p>In the fog, he slowly raised a hand and closed his eyes.</p>

  <p>His hand shook in the rolling fog as if he was fishing.</p>

  <p>Nicholas felt the fluctuation of the space in the air just as Joy was about to escape using the Grand Teleportation. He stretched out his hand and tried to grasp her.</p>

  <p>Whether one was a consummate True God or a Holy Being, there was no stopping once the Grand Teleportation commenced in the divine land.</p>

  <p>When one used the Grand Teleportation, they immediately disappeared.</p>

  <p>However, the distance of a Holy Being's Grand Teleportation was greater than that of a consummate True God.</p>

  <p>Just as they were about to disappear, Nicholas tried to get hold of Joy.</p>

  <p>When Zheng noticed that Nicholas was about to entrap Joy, he made use of the jade seal. With a flash of his mind, he stirred the bugs to devour nine seconds of the time.</p>

  <p>A sneer appeared on Nicholas' face as the air around him became quite blurry.</p>

  <p>Zheng was able to wipe out nine seconds.</p>

  <p>Any damage caused by Nicholas in these nine seconds would be in vain, or so Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>But Zheng's ability didn't work this time.</p>

  <p>He ordered the bugs to tear up the pages, leaving behind a corner which was relatively insignificant to the entire divine land. This corner was as strong as iron; thus, the bugs were unable to devour it.</p>

  <p>The corner next to Zheng and Joy was the blurry scratch that Nicholas made.</p>

  <p>With a loud crack, the space around them tore, and the rolling fog immediately disappeared.</p>

  <p>Everyone was able to witness ongoing events distinctly.</p>

  <p>"Joy!"</p>

  <p>"Joy..."</p>

  <p>Pascal, Liusu, and the others of the Han Clan had a frightened expression on their faces.</p>

  <p>The other True Gods' were in awe as well.</p>

  <p>A black space crack appeared above Zheng's head as Joy fell beside him.</p>

  <p>Her beautiful face was full of excruciating pain, and there were three black wounds on her waist, which were emitting wisps of black aura.</p>

  <p>A faint black aura was emerging from Nicholas' hand as well. He slowly withdrew his hand and gave it a gentle wave. He looked at Joy and said with a malicious smile, "So, you are still in love with this young man's father, aren't you? In order to save Mike's son, you are willing to sacrifice everything. Interesting."</p>

  <p>Reclining on the ground, Joy spat out a large mouthful of blood. Her face lit with resolve. She gripped Zheng's arm tightly and smiled bitterly, "I'm sorry, I failed."</p>

  <p>It was quite impossible for them to escape Nicholas' clutches.</p>

  <p>Zheng even acquired the help of the jade seal, yet they were still unable to avoid Nicholas' attack.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Samuel's hands clutched tightly. He frowned and stared at Nicholas, with an intention to kill him.</p>

  <p>As if he read Samuel's mind, Nicholas smiled at him breezily and said,</p>

  <p>"Samuel, why would the Demi-holy Being of the Han Clan run away with this kid? Do pray tell."</p>

  <p>Samuel's expression changed as he listened to Nicholas. His clenched fists loosened as he said awkwardly, "I am not sure why she did it!"</p>

  <p>Nicholas gave a chilling laugh. He walked towards Joy and said loudly,</p>

  <p>"It's not your fault, Samuel. You were unaware of her motives. But you know me well. I hate being provoked. Don't blame me for the death of the Demi-holy Being of your clan."</p>

  <p>Liusu and Pascal threw hopeful glances at their father, expecting him to stop Nicholas.</p>

  <p>'Aunt Joy is the Demi-holy Being of the Han Clan after all!</p>

  <p>Father will save her, won't he?' they both thought.</p>

  <p>Samuel's body went rigid as he stared at Nicholas.</p>

  <p>Seeing Nicholas walk towards Joy, Samuel gave a nod of approval and said reluctantly, "That should be the case. Do what you must."</p>

  <p>Liusu was dumbfounded when she heard those words. She shouted,</p>

  <p>"Father! How can you do this to her?"</p>

  <p>Aleyna's, Kelsey's, and Pascal's faces were worth watching. They glanced at Samuel, who was still in the air, unable to believe that he was such a coward.</p>

  <p>There was nothing that Joy and Zheng could do to save themselves. They helplessly watched as Nicholas approached them briskly.</p>
