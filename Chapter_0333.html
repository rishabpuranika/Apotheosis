  <p>
</p>

  <p>The weapon refiner was the most sensitive person towards weapons.</p>

  <p>Although Harrison still couldn't believe that Luo Luo Zheng had made a fairy weapon, the sword in front of him was the proof that the latter did it.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng held the sword's hilt and gently brandished it around. Then a satisfied smile crossed his face.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng noticed a texture at the bottom of the sword that looked more complex and beautifully-shaped than the spiritual textures on his body.</p>

  <p>The more he looked at it, the more he realized that it wasn't a spiritual texture but a fairy texture.</p>

  <p>The sword bore a fairy texture, and that could only mean that it was indeed a fairy weapon.</p>

  <p>After wielding it, Luo Luo Zheng suddenly turned and thrust the sword diagonally upward.</p>

  <p>"Shoop!"</p>

  <p>A beam of bright silver light rushed out from the point of the sword. It was so sharp that it pierced the eaves on its way.</p>

  <p>The eaves at Quenching Peak were made of steel. But now, the ray of light from the sharp sword left a hole in the eaves just as if they were made of mud.</p>

  <p>The damage was made from the power of the sword. Luo Luo Zheng didn't even have to use his demonic life vitality.</p>

  <p>'This sword didn't have a name before it was finished. Now that I ultimately condensed it, I will give it a name, ' Luo Luo Zheng pondered. 'Because of its powerful light, I'll just call it Streamer!'</p>

  <p>The sword in his hand suddenly gave a wave of tremor when he thought of this name.</p>

  <p>"Eh?" Luo Luo Zheng looked curiously at the Streamer Sword. It was said that a part of the magic weapon's consciousness would gradually awaken when it became powerful enough. Although it could not communicate with its owner directly, it could create some connection with the owner. It was the link between the sword intent and its owner's consciousness.</p>

  <p>After the awakening of the sword intent, it would condense into a sword beast. Then the sword would finally be its owner's incarnation.</p>

  <p>However, whether this sword could form into a sword beast was something that Luo Luo Zheng wouldn't be able to know just now, so he shrugged off the idea for the time being.</p>

  <p>What had just happened caused quite a stir, drawing all the disciples at Quenching Peak. These disciples in black or white robes all huddled at the gate of the Seventeenth Court, stretching their heads to try to peer in.</p>

  <p>They were curious about who was the weapon refiner that had caused such a stir in the Seventeenth Court.</p>

  <p>No sooner than that, the gate of the Seventeenth Court became overcrowded.</p>

  <p>From not so far away, two figures suddenly sprinted and then firmly stopped by the gate. The two men came from the fire pool and were known by the names of Jerrison and Merk.</p>

  <p>When they saw the crowd at the gate of the Seventeenth Court, they immediately realized that the wave was from here. This saved them the trouble of going door to door.</p>

  <p>Seeing their masters had arrived, the disciples that gathered at the gate of the Seventeenth Court all made way for them.</p>

  <p>"Who was refining the weapon?" Merk asked before entering through the gate.</p>

  <p>But Jerrison's eyes were much sharper. As soon as he got into the Seventeenth Court, he glanced around and found Luo Luo Zheng with the sword in his hands.</p>

  <p>When Harrison heard Merk's question, he quickly came up to Merk and bowed obediently. "Master Jiang, it was me."</p>

  <p>"It was you!" Harrison's reply led Merk to think that it was Harrison who condensed the fairy weapon that caused such a great wave. There were not many disciples at Quenching Peak and Merk knew every disciple very well.</p>

  <p>Harrison had some talent, and through hard work, he could become a good weapon refiner.</p>

  <p>However, his limited talent allowed him to refine medium-grade spiritual weapons at most. If he was painstaking with weapon refining and could luckily get some insights into this art, he might be able to be an outstanding weapon refiner and refine top-grade spiritual weapons.</p>

  <p>Yet, Harrison was never meant to be a guru of weapon refining. He didn't have even the slightest chance of it. So, how could he forge a fairy weapon?</p>

  <p>Thus, Merk couldn't believe that it was Harrison at all. But when he looked at Harrison's calm and cautious face, he didn't see a slight hint of a lie in him. This made Merk a little confused for a moment.</p>

  <p>But Jerrison was quite calmer than Merk and couldn't be fooled easily.</p>

  <p>"What weapon have you just worked out? Is it the sword that that young man holds?" Jerrison inquired.</p>

  <p>Harrison then realized that Merk had misunderstood him. He waved his hand hurriedly and said, "Master Jiang, I think you misunderstood what I was saying. That sword wasn't created by me. I just made a top-grade mysterious weapon together with the other disciples of Seventeenth Court. And that young man is Luo Luo Zheng, a disciple from Drizzle Peak. He was not forging a weapon but condensing the sword!"</p>

  <p>"So he condensed out a fairy weapon?" Jerrison questioned further.</p>

  <p>"Yes." Harrison answered with a nod.</p>

  <p>His quick answer silenced Merk and Jerrison momentarily.</p>

  <p>The two masters were shocked.</p>

  <p>The disciples of the 33 peaks all focused on practicing martial arts and had no clue about the way of weapon refining. But incredibly, this young man in front of them had just condensed out a fairy weapon.</p>

  <p>During the years of studying the craft of weapon refining, the two of them had never heard of a non-weapon refiner condensing out a fairy weapon. They thought it was impossible and against common sense.</p>

  <p>To confirm Harrison's claim, Jerrison walked over to Luo Luo Zheng and asked,</p>

  <p>"Did you truly condense this sword?"</p>

  <p>"You mean Streamer?" Luo Luo Zheng raised his sword with a smile. "Yes, I did."</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng admitted it without hesitation, Jerrison gaped and his mind started to cloud with numerous questions. He couldn't resist asking,</p>

  <p>"How did you do it?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng sheathed his Streamer Sword and replied, "That I can't tell you."</p>

  <p>Jerrison knew that he crossed the line by asking that question.</p>

  <p>Both body refiners and weapon refiners had their own secrets. No one would be so foolish to share secrets of refining methods with others.</p>

  <p>Therefore, it was an absolute taboo to ask others for their secrets.</p>

  <p>If it was Enio refining weapons here, Jerrison would by no means ask him that question.</p>

  <p>It was because Jerrison subconsciously regarded Luo Luo Zheng as a junior.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was just a teenager. He was one of the Cloud Sect's outer disciples who was just at his first grade of nature level.</p>

  <p>Jerrison, on the other hand, was the Sect's master. Being the master of the Quenching Peak, he possessed a higher position than Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's reluctance to answer his question made Jerrison a bit resentful, especially that the young man was holding that fairy sword.</p>

  <p>In Jerrison's view, it was a waste for an outer disciple to use a fairy weapon. The human heart was changeable and complex. Jerrison, who was only curious about the fairy weapon just now, suddenly had the greed for the sword. He quietly looked into Merk's eyes and was satisfied to see that Merk's eyes were also twinkling with greed.</p>

  <p>In their eyes, Luo Luo Zheng was like a kid with a treasure that they could easily snatch out of his hands. He should have the amazing secret about weapon refining. Jerrison and Merk would literally have a meteoric rise if they could get Luo Zheng's fairy weapon and methods.</p>

  <p>They would no longer need to stay in Quenching Peak to teach a bunch of hopeless disciples.</p>

  <p>If they could take away Luo Zheng's secret, they were likely to become the new gurus of weapon refining. They could become as prominent as Enio.</p>

  <p>The children of the noble clans became the inner disciples as soon as they entered the Cloud Sect. While Luo Luo Zheng was clearly an outer disciple, which they knew from the white robe he was wearing. And judging from his looks, Jerrison already knew that Luo Luo Zheng came from the grassroots.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Luo Luo Zheng didn't even have a furnace for weapon refining and had to borrow a copper furnace from Quenching Peak.</p>

  <p>It was hard to stop an evil thought once it had started.</p>

  <p>Jerrison grinned, and asked, "Oh, you're Drizzle Peak's disciple. What's your name again?"</p>

  <p>"I'm  Luo Luo Zheng Luo," Luo Luo Zheng answered lightly.</p>

  <p>"Well, Luo Luo Zheng, since you condensed out such an astonishing weapon in our Quenching Peak, we have to record it. May I have a word with you?"</p>

  <p>Jerrison whispered.</p>

  <p>"Oh?" Luo Luo Zheng raised his eyebrows slightly and then nodded in agreement.</p>

  <p>"Sure," he said.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng ostensibly agreed to his request, but he knew that something wasn't right. He could clearly see that the two men were lusting for his sword.</p>

  <p>Jerrison and Merk made no secret of their evil intentions. In their opinion, as the masters of Quenching Peak, the whole peak was their territory. And being an outer disciple from another peak, Luo Luo Zheng could not absolutely refuse their request.</p>

  <p>And if it hadn't been for the other disciples around, they would have already shown their ferocity.</p>

  <p>A fairy weapon and the way to condense it? both of them could drive any weapon refiner mad.</p>

  <p>Jerrison and Merk thought they had fooled Luo Luo Zheng already. But little did they know that Luo Luo Zheng didn't take them seriously.</p>

  <p>The two men were both at the seventh grade of nature level. On the same level, the weapon refiners were weaker than the body refiners. Thus, the two were no match for Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>If they did show some malevolence toward Luo Luo Zheng, the young man wouldn't mind giving them a severe lecture. It was a good way to test the power of his newly condensed Streamer Sword.</p>

  <p>'Now that Luo Luo Zheng has agreed to my request, it will be much easier to accomplish my goals, ' Jerrison muttered in his heart. He was highly delighted wondering if Luo Luo Zheng was really a fool. Of course, it was better for him if he had really fooled Luo Luo Zheng. He hoped that Luo Luo Zheng would surrender his fairy weapon and the weapon refining method. That way, they could both spare him the trouble.</p>

  <p>"Get out of our way! Move!" Jerrison cried and waved at the disciples at the door to make them leave the Seventeenth Court. "Stop watching!"</p>

  <p>When the disciples had finally all left, he said to Luo Luo Zheng, "Luo Luo Zheng, come with me."</p>

  <p>Then Jerrison took the lead, followed by Luo Luo Zheng, and then Merk walked right behind them. The two deliberately sandwiched Luo Luo Zheng in between them, afraid that the fool would try to run away.</p>

  <p>But they felt it was unnecessary. How could a disciple at the first grade of nature level escape from both of them? They made up their minds that if Luo Luo Zheng didn't hand over his fairy weapon and weapon refining method, they would never allow him to leave Quenching Peak.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng then found himself led by Jerrison into a yard.</p>
