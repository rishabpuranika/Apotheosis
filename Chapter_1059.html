<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The World Commercial Alliance had strictly dictated that news of Luo Zheng leaving the Central Region should not spread.</p>

  <p>Any sane person would understand that the World Commercial Alliance had firmly taken control of the Central Region and become its overlord. And now, Luo Zheng was guiding the alliance.</p>

  <p>This had started after Luo Zheng had defeated Eddie. The other fourth-grade sects had already learned to keep quiet because they had neither the courage nor the strength to fight against the World Commercial Alliance.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng led a group of unknown super masters to exterminate the powerhouses of the divine kingdom with lightning speed, fourth-grade sects such as the Bloodwood Cliff, the Mysterious Luna Hall, and the Black Mountain Sect could only bow their heads in submission. But they were glad that Luo Zheng had no plans to establish his own divine kingdom.</p>

  <p>If he really intended to establish a divine kingdom, take over all the sects, and combine the influence of the Cloud Hall and the World Commercial Alliance, who in the Central Region could resist him right now?</p>

  <p>But no matter what, Luo Zheng had great influence in the Central Region. This was why the World Commercial Alliance wanted to keep his whereabouts under wraps. As long as he was there, the York Divine Kingdom wouldn't dare to do anything.</p>

  <p>Dillon and the others obviously believed that if the York Divine Kingdom were to go all out, even Luo Zheng wouldn't be able to defend himself against it.</p>

  <p>However, each of the four divine kingdoms had their own axes to grind.</p>

  <p>They certainly wouldn't go through so much trouble just for the Central Region, a region that was not even worthy of mention.</p>

  <p>In the skies above the Chaotic Ocean of Stars, two beams of light shot straight towards the east. After sending Miguel and the others away, Luo Zheng and Francis began to cross the Chaotic Ocean of Stars.</p>

  <p>The storm in the Chaotic Ocean of Stars could roughly last for any time between three to six months. Luo Zheng wanted to cross it whenever the storm paused.</p>

  <p>During this time, he had learned more about the York Divine Kingdom and the other three divine kingdoms from Francis.</p>

  <p>Compared to the Central Region, everything on this continent was controlled by the four divine kingdoms and there weren't any sects.</p>

  <p>Establishing a sect was the same as establishing one's own power, and the divine kingdoms would absolutely not allow this. This was because once a sect slowly rose to prominence, it would work against the divine kingdoms, even going ahead and establishing a new divine kingdom.</p>

  <p>Three of the seven divine kingdoms had been destroyed ages ago, leaving the four divine kingdoms and their setups intact. No new divine kingdoms had ever been established, resulting in the achievement of a grand unification.</p>

  <p>However, martial artists needed to cultivate, and divine kingdoms needed to nurture their own successors and descendants. So there was another form of sects in the divine kingdoms - the martial house.</p>

  <p>There were all sorts of martial houses in the divine kingdoms. These were similar to sects in the Central Region but all of them were controlled by divine kingdoms. They had become sacred places for cultivation in the divine kingdoms, irrespective of their size. If one wanted to practice, get more resources and become stronger, he had to join a martial house.</p>

  <p>"If you want to enter the Feather Holy Sea, you'll have to join a certain martial house," Francis suggested as they flew over the Chaotic Ocean of Stars.</p>

  <p>"Why?" Luo Zheng asked, bewildered.</p>

  <p>Francis answered, "The Feather Holy Sea is a miraculous sea. For years together, it has been monopolized by the four divine kingdoms, and no independent warrior has been qualified enough to enter it, let alone mine the life stones."</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyebrows rose as he asked in confusion, "Since the Feather Holy Sea is a sea, then it should be incomparably vast. How can the four divine kingdoms defend it?"</p>

  <p>"You have no idea. Although the Feather Holy Sea sounds like a sea, it's actually just a relatively large inland lake. In order to monopolize many of the secret lands within the Feather Holy Sea, the four divine kingdoms have arranged massive forces around it. Many of the four divine kingdoms' strongholds were built around the sea. About 70% of the population and 90% of the powerhouses in these divine kingdoms live by the sea. Wanting to enter without permission is simply impossible," Francis replied.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Zheng had used the slave seal on Francis, he knew that Francis would not lie to him. Luo Zheng could even sense what was going through his mind, which meant that he could tell whether Francis was telling the truth.</p>

  <p>According to what Francis said, Luo Zheng would meet some trouble.</p>

  <p>His plan had included him secretly entering the Feather Holy Sea. If he could find any life stones in the Feather Emperor Secret Land, he could leave and try to find an opportunity to return to the Central Region.</p>

  <p>But it looked like entering the Feather Holy Sea was going to be a huge problem.</p>

  <p>"If I join a martial house, would I be qualified to enter the Feather Holy Sea?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Francis smiled and replied, "Every year, the four divine kingdoms send people to enter the sea. There are four secret lands within the sea: the Feather Emperor Secret Land, the Divine Emperor Secret Land, the Mysterious Dream Secret Land, and the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded. The four divine kingdoms must have several Soul Sea Realm masters to have developed to such an extent. This meant that there must be countless resources in these secret lands! Luo Zheng was sure that he could get more treasures from these secret lands than from the Tower of Sin and the Dark Nether Cave of the Sea God Continent.</p>

  <p>However, what Luo Zheng was most concerned about was the Feather Emperor Secret Land. After all, it was his goal in this entire journey. If he could obtain enough life stones, he could return home.</p>

  <p>Francis continued, "If you want to enter the first three secret lands, you must join a certain martial house, and it must be at least at the fifth grade.</p>

  <p>All the fifth-grade martial houses in the four divine kingdoms have several slots, and if you want to enter the Feather Emperor Secret Land, you must obtain a slot."</p>

  <p>"What should I do?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Join a martial house, and become the best martial artist in it," Francis replied.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't want to join any other sects. When he had first gone to the Tower of Sin, the people of the Purple Heart Sacred Place had invited him to join them, but he had rejected them.</p>

  <p>He was someone who cherished the old. Even though the Cloud Hall could no longer hold him with his current strength, he was still determined to become a member of the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>"Is there any other way other than joining a martial house?" Luo Zheng asked hopefully, though he knew what the answer was going to be.</p>

  <p>"No, unless you can fight your way into the Feather Holy Sea against war kings and war emperors," said Francis. He then looked at Luo Zheng with a strange expression on his face. "With your strength, it shouldn't be difficult for you to obtain a slot after joining the martial house."</p>

  <p>Before they had left for the Central Region, Francis had heard about Luo Zheng from Master Wallace. Master Wallace had told them that a super talent had appeared in the Central Region, and that he was much stronger than the divine-level talents in the divine kingdoms. He had even killed a fourth level Life and Death Realm martial artist with his cultivation which had still been at the middle stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm at the time.</p>

  <p>It wasn't strange for someone at the Illuminating Soul Realm to kill an Internal Elixir Realm warrior. Many divine-level talents were able enough to do this.</p>

  <p>But the higher the cultivation level of warriors, the more powerful they were. And because of this, it was truly incredible for a warrior at the middle stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm to kill another warrior at the fourth level of the Life and Death Realm.</p>

  <p>As a Life and Death Realm warrior, every time Francis passed through a life and death crisis, he would feel as if he had been reborn. For Luo Zheng to challenge a Life and Death Realm warrior, one could only imagine the astonishing talent he had.</p>

  <p>After a moment of thought, Luo Zheng finally felt relieved. Joining a martial house was just a temporary measure. Right now, Yudie's life was of utmost importance.</p>

  <p>So he made up his mind to join a martial house after entering the divine kingdom. He knew he couldn't fight his way into the Feather Holy Sea against war kings and war emperors.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was immersed in thought when a huge whirlpool suddenly appeared on the surface of the sea before him.</p>

  <p>Even though the storm in the Chaotic Ocean of Stars had paused, there were still mountain-like waves rolling in the sea. When the whirlpool appeared, there were more than ten mountain-like waves spiraling and crashing ahead.</p>

  <p>"What a huge whirlpool!"</p>

  <p>This whirlpool was the size of about a tenth of the area of the Central Region. Its edges formed countless white bubbles, while its middle was still the blue color of the sea. But it was pitch black at the bottom of the whirlpool, as if it could lead to hell.</p>

  <p>Francis's eyes bugged as he saw the whirlpool. He said urgently, "Quick, fly to the sky!"</p>

  <p>He might be enslaved by Luo Zheng and he might not be able to resist Zheng's orders, but he was still afraid of death.</p>
