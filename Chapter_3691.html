<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Yellow Thearch, Divine Farmer and Mahoney looked at each other in silence.</p>

  <p>They had expected the Element Spirit race to punish Emperor Charm, but they hadn't expected it to be done by such violent means.</p>

  <p>He had only exhibited a smidgen of rebellion. He hadn't even rebelled yet, and still they killed him without hesitation.</p>

  <p>They were a truly cruel race.</p>

  <p>There was also an eyeball buried into each of their foreheads.</p>

  <p>They had once thought that this Other Shore Token would bring endless possibilities. With more Other Shore Tokens, they would be able to enhance each other's strength far beyond what was previously possible.</p>

  <p>But now, all it seemed to be was a fatal tool to be used against them.</p>

  <p>How could such powerful masters as Yellow Thearch and Divine Farmer allow someone else to have such control over their lives?</p>

  <p>Taking their lives at any moment? Even the superior Element Spirit race should not be allowed that power!</p>

  <p>As they stood silently, the eyeballs on their foreheads opened. A triangular black light appeared from the center of the eyeballs, and the voice could be heard again.</p>

  <p>"Have you seen the fate Emperor Charm has met?" the triangular black light asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Yellow Thearch.</p>

  <p>"Do you have any feelings about this?" the triangular black light continued.</p>

  <p>Yellow Thearch's eyes grew stern as he said, "We have already chosen our own path, and we will not stray from it. Emperor Charm made his choice to rebel. We do not need such a foolish ally!"</p>

  <p>The triangular black light trembled for a moment before saying, "That's right. Remember, this world will eventually prove that the path we have chosen is indeed the right one. The Purge Way is the only way to survive. I don't want to see this happen again. You have seen his ending!"</p>

  <p>Once it had finished speaking, the triangular black light vanished immediately.</p>

  <p>Yellow Thearch, Mahoney and Divine Farmer all remained silent.</p>

  <p>The strong warriors following behind them were silent as well.</p>

  <p>Their leaders' lives were in someone else's hands. All it would take was an order to be given and they would be dead. This thought dragged their spirits down.</p>

  <p>But the eyeballs remained rooted in their foreheads and so even a private conversation was out of the question.</p>

  <p>After a short silence, Yellow Thearch turned to Fire Emissary, one of the Five-element Emissaries, and said, "Go ahead with your work."</p>

  <p>Fire Emissary looked at Yellow Thearch worriedly but nodded nonetheless.</p>

  <p>He stretched out his arm and made a lifting gesture in the air, and wisps of cyan flames rose from his hands.</p>

  <p>"Sizzle, sizzle, Sizzle..."</p>

  <p>The flames rose up and were sucked into the space above, like vortexes swirling and converging into a single point.</p>

  <p>The space of the chaos had the smallest unit. If a space was constantly divided, the smallest space would be formed. This method was exclusive to the Chaos Ancient God, Othniel.</p>

  <p>Fire Emissary now began condensing all the flames into this Minimum Space.</p>

  <p>An hour later, the flames in the Minimum Space had finally reached a critical state. No matter how hard Fire Emissary tried, he couldn't compress any more flames into it.</p>

  <p>"It's done," Fire Emissary said to Yellow Thearch.</p>

  <p>Yellow Thearch nodded at the huge eye in the crack of the abyss, and the Minimum Space slowly rose up.</p>

  <p>Above the pitch black abyss, there were over a hundred of such Minimum Spaces. They were incredibly small, so small that the tip of a hair could hold over a million of them.</p>

  <p>However, the sheer number of flames in them made the Minimum Spaces very conspicuous, especially in the darkness where the cyan dots of light were like dazzling stars.</p>

  <p>"Are the concentrated flames really that powerful?" Fire Emissary asked.</p>

  <p>Yellow Thearch smiled faintly and said, "You may have a try if you wish."</p>

  <p>"Okay!"</p>

  <p>Fire Emissary was already very curious and so jumped at this opportunity.</p>

  <p>He stretched out his hand, picked a cyan light dot from the air and pinched it hard.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>The Minimum Space exploded.</p>

  <p>It had already been filled to the limit with flames. If it weren't for the Chaos Ancient God named Othniel who had controlled it personally, the Minimum Space would have collapsed.</p>

  <p>Othniel could achieve a wonderful balance in this Minimum Space.</p>

  <p>The moment it exploded, the cyan flames spread out and plummeted down from the sky.</p>

  <p>When they reached the bottom of the abyss, they rose upwards once more.</p>

  <p>The abyss was so big that it could accommodate a large province, and yet it was instantly enveloped by flames.</p>

  <p>"That fire is incredibly fierce!" Fire Emissary exclaimed, staring at the flames above. "But I think there are too many flames in it."</p>

  <p>"The entire space exploded with your flames. That space itself turned into a part of the flames," Yellow Thearch explained.</p>

  <p>"Is that little space so powerful?" Fire Emissary asked, totally stunned.</p>

  <p>"Yes, the mechanism is very complicated and difficult to explain. All you need to know is that all materials in the chaos are made up of countless Minimum Spaces. No matter how the chaos is destroyed or reborn, these Minimum Spaces have always been here. Ordinary people can't usually use these Minimum Spaces." Divine Farmer reached out his hand to touch the flames around him. "The power of the flames is not very strong, but they are destructive enough to kill all the creatures in a province."</p>

  <p>Those flames had already filled the huge abyss. Such powerful flames wouldn't cause any harm to people like Divine Farmer and Yellow Thearch, but if they were placed in a large province, the creatures there would suffer.</p>

  <p>If a Minimum Space exploded, a large province, as well as tens of millions of creatures there, would be burnt to ashes.</p>

  <p>"How many provinces should I burn to make the Source World react?" Fire Emissary asked, frowning intently as he appeared to try and work it out himself.</p>

  <p>Human nature was complicated.</p>

  <p>Fire Emissary was a ruthless figure in the Bearing race and countless people had died by his hands.</p>

  <p>But even burning the provinces and killing all the creatures like this gave him a reason for pause.</p>

  <p>"According to my calculations, we will have to burn down at least three hundred provinces," Divine Farmer replied flatly.</p>

  <p>Everyone fell silent again on hearing this.</p>

  <p>The fact that the Element Spirit race had killed Emperor Charm already aroused feelings of rebellion within them.</p>

  <p>The previous plans seemed logical until they carried them out. Then they felt like stopping and wanted to give up.</p>

  <p>"I'll go first!"</p>

  <p>Mahoney said, taking the initiative while everyone else remained silent.</p>

  <p>Among the several super forces, the New Moon race was the smallest. In the past, they were not qualified to be ranked as a super force. They developed to this point with the support of the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race.</p>

  <p>At this crucial moment, Mahoney felt obligated to do something.</p>

  <p>After the cyan flames that spread throughout the abyss disappeared, she flew up and stored the Minimum Spaces in her space ring. She then moved out of the abyss and Fire Emissary continued to compress the flames into the Minimum Spaces.</p>

  <p>The Vast Sea Province was on the other side of the abyss.</p>
