<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Xun had indicated that she had a way to get the seed, so Luo Zheng didn't say much and just stood aside, watching.</p>

  <p>Many warriors also knew that the chances of obtaining the seed of the World Tree were very small, so they had to take a step back and focus on getting the other treasures.</p>

  <p>After the warriors had chosen their targets, they selected one of the stone platforms and jumped down, drifting along the wind path. Whether they could attain the thing they favored or not would depend on their luck.</p>

  <p>After pondering for a while, the lady with the golden hair who had led the people from the Demon Night also walked onto a stone platform.</p>

  <p>She didn't rush to jump down from the stone platform. Instead, she removed a small scented sachet from her space ring. She gently touched the sachet, and a faint pink scented fog appeared.</p>

  <p>Even though there was a violent wind blowing in the cave, everyone was able to smell the fragrance. It was an extremely refreshing smell.</p>

  <p>Everyone was perplexed when they saw this scene. What was the blonde woman trying to do?</p>

  <p>"Hey, I did the same thing back then. Someone must have taught her this method," Xun's voice rang out again.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng studied the blonde woman's actions carefully and said, "She... Does she want to determine the direction of the gale?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Xun said nodding.</p>

  <p>As the pink fog dispersed, it floated into the wind tunnel below the stone platform, leaving a pink trajectory in its wake!</p>

  <p>This fragrant fog was swirling around in the cave. After circling a few stalagmites, it made a turn in the air and floated to the opposite side of the cave.</p>

  <p>"We can clearly see the path of the wind this way!"</p>

  <p>"Try different platforms one after another. One of them is bound to succeed. This is indeed a good method!"</p>

  <p>Many warriors were impressed by the intelligence of the woman from the Demon Night. Several warriors even quietly approached the stone platform. If this woman really succeeded, then they could jump into the wind tunnel instantly. There was only one seed of the World Tree in the world, and nobody wanted to give up such a great opportunity.</p>

  <p>"What should we do? Do you want me to go up first?" Luo Zheng asked Xun. Since she knew the way to get the seed of the World Tree, he should go ahead of others. If this woman from the Demon Night had really found a way, things would have been much more troublesome!</p>

  <p>But Xun smiled, "It doesn't matter, she won't be able to test it out this way."</p>

  <p>The blonde woman's movements were quick. Every time her slender fingers brushed the scented sachet, a different colored fog drifted down.</p>

  <p>As she continued to jump on to different stone platforms, the mist drew different colored trails within the cave.</p>

  <p>Not long after, she had tested every single one of over one hundred stone platforms with the fragrant fog. Each and every track was memorized by all the warriors.</p>

  <p>However, just as Xun had predicted, she did not test it out.</p>

  <p>"What's going on?"</p>

  <p>"None of the wind tunnels lead to the top of the cave!"</p>

  <p>"Then why is the seed of the World Tree hung on the top of the cave? Is he kidding us?"</p>

  <p>Naturally, no one could answer this question. With what intent did the Supreme Lord from remote ages spend painstaking efforts establishing such an enormous underground palace? So far, no one was able to figure it out.</p>

  <p>More importantly, most of the warriors were not willing to accept this outcome!</p>

  <p>Although there were many treasures on the walls of the cave as well as on the stalagmites, those who had reached this level would not give up so easily. If they chose to do so, they would have left the underground palace when faced with the Blade Mountain Trap.</p>

  <p>This was especially true for the warriors from the three sacred places.</p>

  <p>Although they knew that they could only be considered as marginal characters in their race or forces, they simply couldn't contend with the talents of the core supreme worlds.</p>

  <p>But everyone had embarked on a path to pursue the pinnacle of martial arts. If they had the opportunity to get the seed of the World Tree, no one would choose to give up!</p>

  <p>Lincoln's eyes flashed. He had already firmly memorized the traces of the wind in each wind tunnel into his mind. Since there was not a single wind tunnel that led to the top, it meant that after jumping into the wind tunnel, he would have to change directions several times before he could obtain the seed of the World Tree.</p>

  <p>Everyone only had one chance. Sooner or later, the situation wouldn't be too different!</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, I will go first!" Lincoln smiled and chose a stone platform.</p>

  <p>Without any hesitation, he leaped down!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Lincoln finally felt the might of the gale!</p>

  <p>The strength of the Wind Law, simply made it impossible for him to compete with the wind. The Supreme Lord had cleverly used the wind tunnels. He had designed it such that the wind in over one hundred tunnels would not disturb each other. If he had not designed it so smartly, wind blades would probably have sliced everyone present into pieces!</p>

  <p>He flew in the trajectory of the wind. He was like a light leaf, floating lightly and swiftly along the path.</p>

  <p>When he approached a stone pillar, he grabbed onto a pale yellow flower on the stone pillar. This was a 'Vitality Refining Flower', and it was also an extremely rare treasure. It was able to be refined into a Vitality Refining Pill, which could help warriors to refine a more pure life vitality.</p>

  <p>Lincoln had planned to get into this wind tunnel before time, and his aim was to obtain the 'Vitality Refining Flower'.</p>

  <p>The instant Lincoln grabbed the Vitality Refining Flower, he struck the stone pillar. The explosive force forcefully pushed him from one wind tunnel to another!</p>

  <p>He clenched his teeth and a crack appeared on his forehead. A small cyan stone began to emit a faint cyan light. He had activated the Wrath of the Ocean.</p>

  <p>Lincoln did not stop after entering another wind tunnel. His body rolled in the air and he suddenly stomped his feet on the other stalagmite. Like a fish jumping in a river, he leaped upwards!</p>

  <p>"Ah, that guy!"</p>

  <p>"He is so close to the seed of the World Tree!"</p>

  <p>"Damn it! He beat me to it!"</p>

  <p>Lincoln was able to see the tree seed at this point so he changed his direction several times in the cave to approach the seed of the World Tree. Other warriors might have wanted to do the same, but they hesitated a little because they wanted to wait and see what others would do!</p>

  <p>Now that Lincoln was getting closer and closer to the seed of the World Tree, the other warriors regretted their decision to wait and watch. If they had known earlier, they would have taken this step themselves.</p>

  <p>"Huff, huff..."</p>

  <p>Lincoln used the force of the gale to rush to the top of the cave. The seed of the World Tree was right in front of him now!</p>

  <p>But right then an invisible wind blew from the side, forcefully changing Lincoln's direction and pushing his tall and sturdy body to another direction.</p>

  <p>Soon after, he landed on the opposite side of the cave. Looking at the seed of the World Tree, he clenched his teeth angrily.</p>

  <p>The other warriors also sighed in frustration. They were happy that Lincoln didn't get the World Tree's seed, and that they had a shot at it but it also proved that the chances to succeed were very small.</p>

  <p>Driven by mixed emotions, the other warriors jumped into the wind tunnel and used all their power to try to get the seed.</p>

  <p>Some of the warriors had luck on their side. They had chosen the right wind tunnel as well as the correct angle but they still hadn't been able to obtain the World Tree's seed.</p>

  <p>A while later, most of the warriors had already reached the other side of the cave, leaving only Luo Zheng, Freya and Adrian with a few people.</p>

  <p>Adrian looked very depressed!</p>

  <p>He had planned this trip to the underground palace for a long time, but he never would have expected it to be like this. Although there were many opportunities here, one needed to rely on their own strength to fight for them. But his strength was obviously not enough.</p>

  <p>Feeling helpless, he also jumped into the wind tunnel. Whether he could get what he wanted or not depended on his luck.</p>

  <p>Freya glanced at Luo Zheng and said, "I'm going too."</p>

  <p>She didn't have a specific goal. If she was lucky, she could just take any one of the treasures away.</p>
