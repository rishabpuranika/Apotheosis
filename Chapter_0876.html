  <p>
</p>

  <p>In the Central Region, low-grade sacred weapons were already extremely rare, but not in the Sea God Continent. So when the ogres intended to use ten sacred weapons in exchange for Luo Zheng's life in the Tower of Sin, Fabian had immediately refused it.</p>

  <p>They traveled from the top to the bottom. After passing through a huge root of the holy tree, Luo Luo Zheng finally arrived at the Demon Night's treasure house.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng couldn't help but sigh emotionally as he entered the treasure house.</p>

  <p>A huge luminous pearl stood at the center of the treasure house, emitting a gentle light. Over a dozen long swords were inserted around this pearl.</p>

  <p>All of these treasures were sacred weapons.</p>

  <p>"My Queen, the best weapon in our Heavenly Feather Sacred Place is a weapon that is at the top-grade of the sacred level," Amber said as a way of introduction.</p>

  <p>"Let me have a look," Xun said flatly.</p>

  <p>Amber nodded, bringing Luo Luo Zheng and Xun to the back of the luminous pearl. She extended a hand and gently pulled out a long box from the ground. She opened it and pulled out a long sword from it.</p>

  <p>The sword was light golden in color and its blade shone with a quaint light that made it look like a vintage article.</p>

  <p>"This treasured sword at the top-grade of sacred level was obtained from the Dark Nether Cave. I am not proficient in using a sword, which is why I sealed it here," said Amber.</p>

  <p>"It's a great sword!" Luo Luo Zheng exclaimed, his eyes lighting up in pleasant surprise.</p>

  <p>What kind of opportunities did the Dark Nether Cave have for a weapon at the top-grade of the sacred level to have originated there?</p>

  <p>Xun looked at the sword indifferently. After a moment, she stretched out one of her slender fingers.</p>

  <p>Amber held the long sword in both hands and respectfully passed it to Xun, before retreating to the side.</p>

  <p>Xun flexed her fingers around the hilt and gently brandished the sword before shaking her head. "I don't need this sword. I'll give it to Luo Luo Zheng."</p>

  <p>Amber's face fell at Xun's words. She wondered why Xun had even thought of giving such a top-grade sacred sword to a human war general.</p>

  <p>Although Amber knew that Xun and Luo Luo Zheng had become inseparable companions and that Xun couldn't leave Luo Luo Zheng, Amber had spent all her strength in the Dark Nether Cave to obtain this treasured sword. She had almost died there. And now such a sword was about to be handed to a human warrior, and that made her unhappy.</p>

  <p>She felt the morbidity overtake her heart and discomfort at the fact.</p>

  <p>"Can't I give it to Luo Luo Zheng?" Xun said, noticing Amber's unwillingness.</p>

  <p>Amber immediately lowered her head and said, "It is your decision as to who you want to gift it to."</p>

  <p>Xun nodded, and passed it to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The Demon Night had three queens as their core because Xun and the other two queens belonged to the faith of the Demon Night. And members of the Demon Night obeyed their queens all the time, without even thinking of rebelling.</p>

  <p>Even if Xun ordered Amber to kill herself right now, she would not disobey.</p>

  <p>From this perspective, the Demon Night was completely different from the human race.</p>

  <p>Humans didn't know absolute obedience. So long as the benefits of betrayal were great, even father and son could betray each other. Belonging to the same race wasn't even a reason not to.</p>

  <p>So this meant that the members of the Demon Night were far more united than the human race. In the Central Region, different sects would attack each other to fight for their own benefit. It was impossible for something like this to happen in the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's heart thumped wildly as he received the sword. A top-grade sacred sword, and he was getting it just like that!</p>

  <p>He had a low-grade sacred weapon, but as a warrior, he was eager to get his hands on some better treasured weapons.</p>

  <p>"I don't need a sword now." Xun shook her head and said, "I want to use my original weapon. I want a spear!"</p>

  <p>Xun had used a sword as a kid. But when she had been chosen to be the queen of the Demon Night and began to take charge of killings, she began using the spear. The time she had spent using the spear was naturally much longer than what she had spent using the sword. It was also much easier for her to use a spear.</p>

  <p>At the time, Luo Luo Zheng had thought that Xun was just his sword spirit, so he had naturally given the sword to Xun. However, only a spear would be able to make Xun show the full force of her power.</p>

  <p>Amber nodded and stretched her hand. An invisible force swept out and a silver spear spiraled over to them from a box in the distance.</p>

  <p>"This spear is the best in the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place. Please have a look," Amber said as she handed the spear to Xun.</p>

  <p>This spear was of a grade that was inferior to that of Luo Zheng's sword. It was not at a low grade but at the middle-grade of the sacred level.</p>

  <p>Xun reached out to hold the silver spear in her hand and looked it over.</p>

  <p>Finally, she thrust the spear into the air.</p>

  <p>A wave of energy burst out, crackling through the air.</p>

  <p>Not only did the energy wave frighten Luo Luo Zheng, it stunned even Amber who was at the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>Even though Xun was just Luo Zheng's sword spirit, her strength had grown along with that of the spirit's master.</p>

  <p>And though the sword spirit's cultivation base couldn't be graded, it just might be on par with Luo Zheng's cultivation, even a little lower than his.</p>

  <p>Xun's spear strike could not hurt Amber since she was at the Soul Sea Realm. But right now, Amber was unable to comprehend the spear intent and momentum that Xun had mastered.</p>

  <p>After all, Xun's cultivation base was very high, far more than this, and what she had comprehended was far beyond what Amber could reach.</p>
