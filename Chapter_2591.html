<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2591 Cultivating Dual Systems </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Zheng felt overwhelming disgust when he heard David's words.</p>

  <p>This guy was a member of the Yellow Emperor race, but he hoped for the defeat of his own race members because of his selfish desire to fight in the arena himself.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure you'll win against me?" Zheng responded with scorn.</p>

  <p>David blinked, and a tinge of evil crossed over his handsome features.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'm one-hundred percent sure I can win against you," he said with a chuckle.</p>

  <p>"Since you're so confident, then there's no point in talking. Let's fight!"</p>

  <p>Zheng announced in a calm but powerful voice.</p>

  <p>Seeing Zheng's composure irked David.</p>

  <p>To him, Zheng should act a bit more nervous as if he was facing a formidable enemy. This lack of reaction from his opponent made David think that Zheng wasn't exactly taking him seriously.</p>

  <p>"Let me show you the reason why I'm so confident," David said in a cocky tone, taking a step back and spreading his hands.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>Two sharp black knives appeared in David's hands.</p>

  <p>The material that these knives were made of was exactly the same as Lisa's black sword and emitted a sharp power.</p>

  <p>With the appearance of these knives, David's face suddenly became serious.</p>

  <p>It was as if he had transformed into an entirely different person.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, David suddenly rushed towards Zheng in quick, but extremely strange steps.</p>

  <p>He was so fast that the only thing people could see was his afterimage.</p>

  <p>It was amazing how such a huge creature measuring ten thousand feet in height could move so fast!</p>

  <p>A trace of vigilance appeared in Zheng's eyes as he took two steps back and raised his emerald green sword defensively in front of him.</p>

  <p>David was fast, but it was impossible for him to escape the spiritual sense that Zheng suddenly released to track him.</p>

  <p>With the use of spiritual sense, Zheng would always be able to find David no matter where or how fast he went.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>David circled around Zheng a dozen times before suddenly jumping and rushing towards him from behind.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng seemed to have grown a pair of eyes behind his head. He turned slightly and the long sword he carried swayed with him.</p>

  <p>Clank! Clank!</p>

  <p>With two clear sounds, David was forced back a couple of feet. "You have quick reflexes," he told Zheng with a wild laugh. "I hope you can be as quick next time!"</p>

  <p>"It's just an insignificant skill," Zheng muttered lightly.</p>

  <p>On the surface, David looked calm but deep inside he was truly surprised.</p>

  <p>He could never imagine Zheng being that fast. His opponent's reaction time put him above and beyond any of the foes he had ever faced before.</p>

  <p>"I was just being polite. Don't overestimate yourself. Do you truly think that was the limit of my speed?" David laughed coldly. "I think it's time to show you what my real speed is!"</p>

  <p>Just then, a strong stream of life vitality emanated from David's body.</p>

  <p>The scene made Zheng raise an eyebrow.</p>

  <p>'He is also a top-rank True God?!'</p>

  <p>After Zheng came to this world, most of the people he met cultivated the Wild God system.</p>

  <p>Adele, the Grand Elder of the Nine Li race, also cultivated the True God system and had her inner world, but she treated it as mere supplementary means.</p>

  <p>According to the old man in the Nine Li race, the warriors of this world were not suited to the True God system, and not even the exiles asked their race members to cultivate it.</p>

  <p>It was beyond Zheng's expectations to find out that David was also a top-rank True God.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>David took a slight step and his huge body disappeared instantly.</p>

  <p>Even if Zheng tried to lock him down with his spiritual sense, it was still ineffective.</p>

  <p>"What's this?"</p>

  <p>Zheng was slightly stunned.</p>

  <p>He felt a strong sense of crisis suddenly well up from the bottom of his heart.</p>

  <p>At that moment, almost as if on reflex, Zheng lowered his head.</p>

  <p>Clank!</p>

  <p>There was a loud, clanging noise that rang out as iron and gold suddenly collided.</p>

  <p>This sound was created by David's two blades hitting each other after failing to catch Zheng off-guard.</p>

  <p>Still failing to hit Zheng, David quickly flew away, laughing as he did so.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! You are quite lucky! However, you can't rely on luck to save you forever!"</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>With that, David once again vanished into thin air.</p>

  <p>At this time, Zheng pulled a long face.</p>

  <p>David had been partly right that Zheng had been quite lucky for dodging that blow.</p>

  <p>Had Zheng been a second too slow then he would've already been decapitated.</p>

  <p>The key problem was that Zheng couldn't quite figure out what kind of trick David was pulling to help his huge body disappear into thin air.</p>

  <p>There were three thousand Godly Ways in the divine land and all True Gods explored and cultivated them. These three thousand Godly Ways formed the foundation of the cultivation of the True God system.</p>

  <p>However, the three thousand Godly Ways had been created by Chiyou for the members of the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>The Godly Ways in the Source World were definitely much more than three thousand.</p>

  <p>Right now, Zheng had no clue what kind of Godly Way David cultivated.</p>

  <p>However, that did not mean that he was entirely incapable of dealing with his opponent.</p>

  <p>"Eight Smoky Melodies!"</p>

  <p>Zheng shouted, twisting his body as a warm stream flew out from his belly and white, cloud-like smoke surrounded him.</p>

  <p>This scene confused both the Nine Li race and the Yellow Emperor race.</p>

  <p>Nearly a third of the audience had their own inner worlds, but not many of them cultivated the True God system deeply. It was simply impossible for them to see the Truth of Cultivation Nature Zheng released just now.</p>

  <p>The moment Zheng activated his bodily movement skill, he suddenly felt a presence behind him.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>The two sharp knives appeared, silently dashing towards Zheng once again.</p>

  <p>Zheng's body was tall, strong, and extremely agile with the help of both the Truth of Cultivation Nature and the Eight Smoky Melodies.</p>

  <p>He wasn't conscious of the attack yet, but at that moment, his entire body retreated involuntarily.</p>

  <p>Through his skills, Zheng managed to unknowingly dodge David's strike.</p>

  <p>David didn't laugh this time.</p>

  <p>He felt something weird in this battle against Zheng. He retreated a few steps back and kept a safe distance away from the young man, taking this as an opportunity to stare at him.</p>

  <p>"Do you want to continue?" Zheng asked flatly.</p>

  <p>"Brat! Have you also cultivated the Truth of Godly Way?" David couldn't help but ask.</p>

  <p>According to his master, only a few people among the True Gods could comprehend the Truth of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>There were even fewer people as wise as David who could learn it in such a short period of time.</p>

  <p>Given enough time and the right conditions, David was guaranteed to reach the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>This was where most of his confidence and arrogance came from.</p>

  <p>He knew that he was different, and that no matter how hard the other Wild Gods cultivated, they would never be able to compare to him.</p>

  <p>Spending their entire lives training would only let them attain the Grand Elder's level, at most.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, David was fated to sit on the same couch as those powerful exiles.</p>

  <p>This was the true strength David pursued!</p>

  <p>All this time, he was confident that he was the only one who could comprehend the Truth of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>After so many years, amongst everyone who cultivated the True God system, he was absolutely certain that he was the only one who comprehended it, save for the exiles of course. This was also the reason why the exiles paid so much attention to David in the first place.</p>

  <p>He couldn't believe that he just felt the Truth of Cultivation Nature from Zheng just now!</p>
