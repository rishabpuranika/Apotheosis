<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The villagers were not stupid. A proving godly warrior with unknown background stayed in their little village might because the warrior possibly committed some crime and escaped his origins to avoid punishment. However, since the Misty Mountain Village was so remote, perhaps no one would be able to find the place. As such, they were not too worried.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had been in the Misty Mountain Village for more than half a month.</p>

  <p>Within that period, about half of the black threads in his cinnabar field had already melted away. In another half a month, he should be able to completely get rid of all of those black threads. His strength would finally be rejuvenated. Additionally, Luo Luo Zheng had good knowledge of the Vast Sky Region. After those black threads melted away, he would leave the village. The vast region could be finally explored by him.</p>

  <p>The divine citizens' cultivation talent was not weak. However, it was just that their foundation was too poor. Thus, it was difficult for them to bring out their full strength. With his cultivation base of the Spirit Transformation Realm, Woolley could barely employ the Sword Step. As such, his movements were still not agile enough.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Thomson's talent was indeed beyond Luo Zheng's expectations. Even though he had yet to open his Soul Sea, it only took him three days to master the Sword Step. Such fast comprehension was spectacular even for Luo Luo Zheng. Thomson's talent was greater than that of any ordinary people. Even seasoned warriors would be impressed by Thomson's extraordinary talent for comprehension.</p>

  <p>Therefore, based on Thomson's talent, Luo Luo Zheng had developed a new sword technique. He aligned it with the basic sword technique Woolley practiced, with the addition of the Sword Step. The newly created technique was then imparted to Thomson...</p>

  <p>Thomson meticulously practiced the sword technique day and night for the past few days. When he saw Luo Luo Zheng walk out of the house, he suddenly threw the wooden sword away and knelt down with a plop sound in front of Luo Luo Zheng. With a face full of admiration, he pleaded, "Master, please accept me as your disciple!"</p>

  <p>He actually wanted to become Luo Zheng's disciple!</p>

  <p>If it was within the universe, then Luo Luo Zheng would indeed have the qualifications to establish his own sect. He would even be able to create a great force within the universe and take Thomson in as a disciple. With his vast knowledge and unparalleled experience in battle, Luo Luo Zheng could create a strong and very powerful sect.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng himself was only a proving godly warrior in the divine land. He would face a lot of hardships and dangers in the future. Even if he took Thomson in as his disciple, it would be strenuous to take care of him. It would be very difficult for Luo Luo Zheng to protect himself and Thomson at the same time. He faintly smiled and responded, "Sorry. I am unable to take you in as my disciple right now."</p>

  <p>It was Woolley who wanted Thomson to be Luo Zheng's disciple. Woolley knew that Luo Luo Zheng gave no high importance to his average talent. If his brother could be accepted as a disciple by a proving godly warrior, it would be much easier for his brother to cultivate. Even though he was full of envy, Woolley still wanted Thomson to improve and get stronger.</p>

  <p>That was an opportunity Thomson could not miss.</p>

  <p>However, they didn't expect that Luo Luo Zheng would immediately refuse Thomson without a single thought! Luo Luo Zheng had been very kind in the past weeks. Both Woolley and Thomson thought that Luo Luo Zheng would at least accept one disciple.</p>

  <p>"Why? I, I'm very obedient! Please! Master!" Thomson stammered as he raised his head. Sadness was apparent in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Woolley also interjected. With a depressed face, he asked, "That's right.</p>

  <p>Why can't you take my brother as your disciple?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was naturally unable to explain his origins to them. All he could do was to shake his head indifferently. He looked at Thomson and asked,</p>

  <p>"Why are you cultivating the martial arts? If you just want to protect the people of the Misty Mountain Village, then you just need to rely on your own talent and the sword skills that I have taught you. You are already brave enough. Practice diligently and you can have the strength to protect them..."</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng had never come into contact with any other martial artist from the Vast Sky Region, he could deduce the general situation from the performance of the villagers from the Misty Mountain Village. If judged from the cultivation method alone, other than the Divine Dao and top cultivation methods, the other cultivation methods in the divine land were not superior to those of the universe. After all, almost all of the inheritances in the universes came from the Holy Beings!</p>

  <p>Of course, that was only true for the ordinary divine citizens in the divine land. The cultivation methods of the Han Clan's members who had encountered Luo Luo Zheng in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land were extremely extraordinary. It could even be said that they were powerful enough to challenge Luo Luo Zheng. After all, they also had the inheritance of the Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>"No!" Thomson denied Luo Zheng's words. A determined expression painted his face. He then announced with a brave tone, "I cultivate the martial arts not just to protect the Misty Mountain Village! "I, I want to... pursue the Divine Dao!"</p>

  <p>After he heard Thomson say such words, Woolley was very shocked.</p>

  <p>With an opened mouth, Woolley gawked at his brother. He had never thought that his brother had such an ideal.</p>

  <p>In the divine land, there was a huge gap between the divine citizens and True Gods.</p>

  <p>Once one succeeded in the cultivation of the Divine Dao, it meant that they would achieve unlimited lifespan and unlimited possibilities. The Divine Dao was a gateway for limitless power and strength.</p>

  <p>However, even though the number of True Gods in the divine land was large, it did not mean that it was easy to cultivate the Divine Dao. That particular method of cultivation was very strenuous. The warriors that cultivated the Divine Dao also rarely succeeded.</p>

  <p>The vast majority of True Gods were born countless divine eras ago. A True God wouldn't die because their lifespan was already inexhaustible.</p>

  <p>Old age and sickness would mean nothing to them. As such, there were so many True Gods out there. However, only a few divine citizens would be able to master the Divine Dao and become True Gods.</p>
