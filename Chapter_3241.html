  <p>
</p>

  <p>While the Five-element Emissaries from Bearing race remained anxious, Luo Zheng had already entered the central hall of the temple through the entrance.</p>

  <p>On one side of the central hall, there was a wall on which a big bear statue was engraved as decoration. The carvings and delicate details on the statue were exquisitely sophisticated.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng looked around in all directions, he approached the wall and placed his hand on it.</p>

  <p>He had intended to destroy it to have a look at what was on the other side.</p>

  <p>Just as he began to break it down, a man showed up behind him and shouted, "You cannot destroy that wall!"</p>

  <p>The man that suddenly appeared was an Indigo Soul. Luo Zheng immediately concluded him to be a member of the Bearing race.</p>

  <p>"You think you can stop me?" Luo Zheng turned his face towards him and sneered meaningfully.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I do!"</p>

  <p>After saying this, the man abruptly made a move and pounced on Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Immediately, Luo Zheng spurned this mere Indigo Soul and disposed of him like a bothersome gnat. As Luo Zheng waved his hand, the man was effortlessly thrown back for a few feet before he crashed into a wall.</p>

  <p>He went easy on him this time. If he had added more strength in his blow, the man's Soul of Light would have been shattered.</p>

  <p>With no more hindrances in his way, Luo Zheng approached the wall a second time. Wasting no time, he pressed hard on the wall with his right hand and applied a little pressure. 'Now then, let's see what we could find.'</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>Not long after, the wall couldn't bear any more pressure, and it collapsed inwards.</p>

  <p>He watched intently as the wall cracked up and revealed hidden compartments within it.</p>

  <p>These secret compartments were in thirteen rows. And in each of them, there lay a piece of Other Shore Token!</p>

  <p>Among the many Other Shore Tokens that now lay bare to him, three distinct ones in the thirteenth row caught his attention. A golden sculpture carved in the shape of a bull, a rhombus-shaped green gem, and a pair of curved feet of a monster.</p>

  <p>He ran his eyes across them as if to scan these tokens and counted them in his heart. There were more than a hundred Other Shore Tokens in total from Stage One to Stage Thirteen of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>"You can't touch those Other Shore Tokens! They belong to our Bearing race!" Two more people appeared on the scene and shouted while pointing at the Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>Similar to the Taiyi Heaven Palace, the Bearing race also collected various Other Shore Tokens and kept them inside the wall for the members of their own race to use. However, they had never imagined someone like Luo Zheng would infiltrate their temple and attempt to steal them before they moved them away.</p>

  <p>"Not anymore, they belong to me now," Luo Zheng chuckled in amusement, staring at their frustrated faces.</p>

  <p>These Other Shore Tokens must hold a lot of value in the market. Luo Zheng might not need them for himself, but he could sell them for something else.</p>

  <p>However, he did not have a Sumeru Space of his own, as he was now in the form of his physical body. Collecting these Other Shore Tokens and storing them would be a problem. Luo Zheng had called Ling Shuang to aid him in his invasion for this reason.</p>

  <p>The two men felt anxiety growing inside them as Luo Zheng remained firm to his cause. It was apparent the most they could do was attack him without caring about what would happen to them. Suddenly, they rushed towards him to try and take him down.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was starting to get a little impatient. These guys would prove to be a nuisance if they weren't dealt with once and for all.</p>

  <p>"Puff! Puff!"</p>

  <p>This time, Luo Zheng exerted a little more force than before and threw them heavy punches. Although they were not dead, their Souls of Light had taken massive irreversible damage.</p>

  <p>In the darkness inside the temple, the many members of the Bearing race stood watching the scene helplessly. They hung their heads loosely from their necks in defeat.</p>

  <p>They could guess Luo Zheng's ultimate reason for coming here was to avenge the attack on the Taiyi Heaven Palace. But they had never expected him to be so ruthless. If only they hadn't done what they had to the Taiyi Heaven Palace, they wouldn't have to swallow the bitter pill they received at present.</p>

  <p>For the sake of her safety, Luo Zheng hadn't called Ling Shuang in.</p>

  <p>After dealing with the members of the Bearing race, Luo Zheng proceeded to penetrate the wall with his two hands. Soon, the immense wall was lifted off the ground whole before Luo Zheng carried it onto his shoulders and walked out of the temple casually.</p>

  <p>"That guy..."</p>

  <p>"Shit! He can enter the Other Shore with his physical body. We can't compare to his strength."</p>

  <p>"He's too terrifying. We can't compete with him!"</p>

  <p>Noticing Ling Shuang from afar, Luo Zheng walked up to her smiling ear to ear with the wall still on his shoulders. Before he set it down, he glanced at her and said, "Put these away for me."</p>

  <p>Ling Shuang smiled tenderly. Her Soul of Light fluttered around the wall. With quick hands, she conjured up a blue square on her slender fingers. Soon after, those Other Shore Tokens were all sucked into the square.</p>

  <p>"Wow! Quite a find if I do say so myself!" Ling Shuang let out a scream in excitement.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng chuckled at her reaction and shook his head. "This is nothing. I will have a bigger surprise for you, just wait and see..."</p>

  <p>Just then, a man rushed over in their direction, almost out of breath. "Wait!</p>

  <p>Slow down..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng paused to glance at him and asked, "Why? What's wrong?"</p>

  <p>The man got closer to Luo Zheng's ear and whispered in a low voice, "Master Qiu Yinhe has requested you to stop destroying the temple of the Bearing race."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng sighed at his request and frowned to himself.</p>

  <p>He had already torn down almost half of the temple, and he did not plan on stopping there. But now, Qiu Yinhe had asked him to halt his attacks. It was probably because the Bearing race had asked the Taiyi Heaven Palace to do so, or maybe they had come to a compromise between both parties.</p>

  <p>"Fine, I'll stop," Luo Zheng said with an exasperated sigh as he raised his hands in defeat.</p>

  <p>The messenger was a little shocked at Luo Zheng agreeing with Qiu Yinhe's wishes so quickly. He never expected Luo Zheng would listen without much persuasion.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of the disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace, such a man who could enter the Other Shore with his physical body could not be easily controlled. He never expected Luo Zheng to be so obedient. 'What relationship does Master Qiu Yinhe share with this guy?'</p>

  <p>"But, I will take what I deserve," Luo Zheng said as the corners of his mouth turned into a mischievous smile.</p>

  <p>The over one hundred Other Shore Tokens he just gathered had no value in Luo Zheng's eyes. Instead, he would give them away without hesitation in exchange for soul pills and soul crystal in the future.</p>

  <p>Immediately, his mind began to wonder if the temple of the Bearing race had a large amount of soul crystal, just like the Other Shore Tokens. He could stop destroying the temple as ordered, but he would take what he came to get.</p>

  <p>It seemed the Indigo Soul was not the destination of the soul. Later, he would definitely need more soul crystal as he would surpass the Desire World to enter the Desire World.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the great hall of the Taiyi Heaven Palace in the Source World, a disciple sat upright in the center, while the masters waited for him to wake up and bring the news of Luo Zheng's response.</p>

  <p>"I doubt that guy would listen to Qiu Yinhe..."</p>

  <p>"Now that his physical body has entered the Other Shore, he must be unstoppable. Alas, I hope he can show some mercy!"</p>

  <p>"I didn't expect the Bearing race would make such a huge concession!"</p>

  <p>Several masters hung their heads with a hint of worry on their faces.</p>

  <p>Just then, another news came from the Bearing race, offering a compromise.</p>

  <p>They had proposed to order the Jin Wu to withdraw from the Mountain Viewing Province.</p>

  <p>The dispute between the Jin Wu and the Taiyi Heaven Palace in the Mountain Viewing Province had lasted for many years. It was always a headache to the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>Back then, when the Jin Wu had a conflict with the humans of the Taiyi Heaven Palace, the Bearing race played a huge part in adding fuel to the fire. If they could end their war with the Jin Wu by stopping Luo Zheng from destroying the temple, it could be beneficial for both parties.</p>

  <p>But they didn't think that mysterious guy would obey Qiu Yinhe's instructions.</p>

  <p>Among all the masters present, only Qiu Yinhe, Madam Ying, Winchell, and Goran knew Luo Zheng was that guy. When Qiu Yinhe asked someone to take a message to Luo Zheng, Ying glanced at him with meaningful eyes.</p>

  <p>After a while, the disciple opened his eyes and awakened, he returned the hopeful gazes of the masters and said, "That guy has agreed to not destroy their temple, but he still wants to go inside."</p>

  <p>"Why does he want to go to the temple?" the master of Ivory Mountain spoke up in curiosity.</p>

  <p>"The Bearing race has accumulated countless treasures over the years. He wants to gather the things he wants from them." "I really have no idea where this greedy guy came from!" laughed the master of the Golden Mountain.</p>
