<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3227 Turning Into Indigo Soul </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Milo had once fought with Luo Zheng in the Dragon City.</p>

  <p>At that time, Milo held a dense mass of air in his hand, yet it was indestructible. It even broke the Snow Sword!</p>

  <p>That mass of air was actually a sword formed by Milo's thoughts.</p>

  <p>"Milo didn't use all of his strength back then. Otherwise, I'm afraid that I would have failed to resist..." Luo Zheng muttered to himself as he stared at the invisible long sword.</p>

  <p>The way the invisible long sword was formed was completely different from the Power Shaping of the Might Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>The sword was created by a warrior's mind, and could directly hit one's soul once it struck. The killing power that sword contained could easily destroy Luo Zheng's Soul of Light back then.</p>

  <p>Now Luo Zheng had already mastered the way to form a sword with his mind, and through the help of the Truth Enlightenment, his sword was probably more powerful than Milo's. And the only way to prove it was through a sword fight.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, of course, would not challenge Milo right now, he couldn't afford to waste his time. Luo Zheng had promised Ying that he'd go to the Other Shore as soon as he could, and now it was time.</p>

  <p>He immediately left the Flow Tower and returned to his own courtyard house quickly. Then he chose to cultivate in seclusion again.</p>

  <p>It only took a few moments for Luo Zheng to enter the Other Shore with his physical body.</p>

  <p>His Soul of Light had stepped into Stage Four, while his body still stayed in Stage One.</p>

  <p>Luckily, Dorothy had shown him the way before, so it wasn't too difficult for his physical body to climb up to Stage Four.</p>

  <p>As usual, he had attracted many surprised gazes on the way.</p>

  <p>It took Luo Zheng more than ten hours to reach Stage Four. Then his physical body safely retreated, and his soul returned to the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Last time, Luo Zheng had retreated from the practice room of the temple, and now he went back to the same room.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng pushed the door open, another room's door was also opening.</p>

  <p>Although he hadn't seen the face, Luo Zheng was sure that the person from the other room was Dorothy. He had learned to identify her by her aura, which he had grown familiar with.</p>

  <p>"I've been waiting for you for a long time!" Dorothy complained, but it was evident that she was glad to see him.</p>

  <p>Ying always kept her words. She held the high position only inferior to Eastern Emperor Taiyi's in the Taiyi Heaven Palace. If she really wanted to give soul crystal to Luo Zheng, she could do it the way she wanted.</p>

  <p>However, after Luo Zheng returned to the Heart Flow Sect, he didn't visit the temple first, and that made Dorothy upset.</p>

  <p>Despite that, she couldn't shake her optimistic nature, and her dissatisfaction only lasted for a short while. A moment later, she was already smiling at Luo Zheng while saying, "Come with me."</p>

  <p>This time, they were led by someone as they walked around the temple.</p>

  <p>Upgrading their Souls of Light into Indigo Souls required quite a lot of soul crystal. But as much as Luo Zheng could remember, the temple had only a small stock of soul crystal, didn't it?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was getting confused, so he asked Dorothy about it.</p>

  <p>But before Dorothy could even answer, their escort smiled at him and said confidently, "Since the day when someone discovered the Other Shore, the soul crystal has always been in great demand, but it doesn't mean that the Taiyi Heaven Palace doesn't have enough soul crystal at disposal."</p>

  <p>Near the entrance of the temple, every disciple of the Taiyi Heaven Palace could get some soul crystal. As for how much they could get, it depended on how much importance their sects attached to them.</p>

  <p>Whether it was the Taiyi Mountain or the Origin Mountain, they had their own private savings of soul crystal.</p>

  <p>Ying and the other powerful figures could not come to the Lust World, so they couldn't use it. It was prepared for their direct descendants.</p>

  <p>"Grandma only prepared the soul crystal that I need. So she went to borrow some from the Golden Mountain for you this time. Isn't she nice?" Dorothy smiled at Luo Zheng, who was a little surprised at the news.</p>

  <p>"Ha ha! It is a great favor, young man," their escort said in an envious tone.</p>

  <p>Of course, this person knew that fusing with that soul crystal was enough to let a warrior's Soul of Light turn into a powerful Indigo Soul. It meant the soul was raised to a higher level, which allowed the warrior to enter the Desire World.</p>

  <p>Such an opportunity was so precious, and most people could only envy it.</p>

  <p>"Please tell Madam Ying my sincere appreciation. I owe her big time,"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng said earnestly.</p>

  <p>Yet, until now, Luo Zheng's confusion hadn't been alleviated at all.</p>

  <p>'What had happened between Madam Ying and Lady Concubine Yan? Why would Madam Ying impose such a good thing on me all of a sudden? If she just wanted to win me over to her side, why would she go to such lengths?'</p>

  <p>He wanted to ask Dorothy about it, but then he remembered that last time he mentioned Concubine Yan and Feng Ge, Dorothy immediately became weird. So he thought he might just look for the answer himself or find someone else to ask about it.</p>

  <p>The man led them to a covert place in the temple. It was heavily guarded with soldiers flanking each side of the doorway. Many runes were also engraved on the walls, from which Luo Zheng could feel powerful soul waves transmitting endlessly. Those runes must be used as a killing array to kill unwelcome souls.</p>

  <p>"The soul crystal is ready. You two can go in now." Their escort stopped in front of a door, gesturing Luo Zheng and Dorothy to enter.</p>

  <p>The two went inside without hesitation. The room, as they'd observed, had a few small compartments.</p>

  <p>They each selected one, and instantly sat cross-legged, wasting no time.</p>

  <p>In a short while, drops of white light began to appear from the texture on the wall of the compartment, and a strong soul aura forced its way out.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did not hesitate. He reached out his hand, and with a gentle pull, the pure soul crystal flooded into his body. He could feel it slowly entering his Soul of Light.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>As more and more white dots of light came in slowly, the Souls of Light of Luo Zheng and Dorothy were becoming stronger and stronger rapidly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's soul was slightly stronger than Dorothy's when the two of them had just entered the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>Later on, they reached the first temple and absorbed a large ball of soul crystal together. With the help of that, they were able to reach the fourth stage of the Other Shore Realm quicker than they'd anticipated. Then, the Heart Flow Sect had given Luo Zheng a fist-size chunk of soul crystal, bigger than others', so his Soul of Light had surpassed Dorothy's a lot.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng continuously absorbed the soul crystal into his body, the purple light of his Soul of Light started to shine brighter and more vividly.</p>

  <p>The white dots of light that emerged on the wall weren't shrinking or showing any signs of diminishing at all. On the contrary, more and more were actually appearing!</p>

  <p>About an hour later...</p>

  <p>The last piece of the soul crystal had merged with Luo Zheng's Soul of Light, which was glowing brightly with purple light.</p>

  <p>In that narrow space, Luo Zheng flapped his arms around, stretching, and got a test of his current stronger power. He threw a punch against the wall closest to him, and his fist collided with the wall with a strong force. His Soul of Light had changed completely. It was an entity on its own now. He felt like it was his own physical body that was on the Other Shore, instead of his soul!</p>

  <p>Dorothy had already climbed out of the narrow space a few moments ago, but she waited for Luo Zheng at the door. Her soul also emitted a stronger purple light now. After only an hour of absorbing the soul crystal, their aura had become much more powerful and imposing.</p>

  <p>For ordinary disciples, this would have been an unimaginable feat.</p>

  <p>Most of the disciples could only get the rare soul crystal when they had attained a great achievement or if they were willing to explore the temples that only a few people had set foot in.</p>

  <p>When Dorothy saw Luo Zheng exit the room, she came up to him before he could even greet her, and pinched his arm. After turning into Indigo Soul, she sensed her touch felt more real, and even her face became clearer.</p>

  <p>Although he couldn't see her clearly, Luo Zheng could feel that the edge of her soul had become sharper.</p>

  <p>"I feel like I've changed my soul entirely. It feels kind of strange," Dorothy said, frowning.</p>

  <p>"I'm still not used to it either," Luo Zheng answered with a smile, encouraging her.</p>

  <p>They then walked out of that place together, feeling more powerful and confident. But just as they had reached the entrance of the temple, throngs of Souls of Light started rushing in, and they were all screaming.</p>
