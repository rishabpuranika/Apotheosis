<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 461 Killing Way (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Everyone aspired to stick their sword in a higher place.</p>

  <p>Because the higher the ground where it was embedded, the more resources a person could collect from the Killing Sword Mountain.</p>

  <p>However, resources of the Killing Sword Mountain were limited. The situation was no different from that of the Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>And this was why all the weapons at the foot of the mountain, including mysterious, spiritual, and fairy weapons, would release their sword spirits to prevent other climbers. One could only climb the mountain step by step using his own strength until he reached a higher place. That was the way to obtain more resources.</p>

  <p>The blue figure's remarks had Luo Luo Zheng raising his eyebrows while his face became long with worry.</p>

  <p>Grateful to be given the opportunity to reach the Killing Sword Mountain, Luo Luo Zheng vowed to climb as high as possible.</p>

  <p>He had been fighting hard to pass the mountainside with the help of the sword spirit. Why would he stop here?</p>

  <p>If a man could have a sacred weapon, even a low level one, it was impossible for Luo Luo Zheng to defeat him in real life. And even someone like Kenneth Shi, who was the head of the Cloud Sect, strong as he was, could not beat such a man in their real world.</p>

  <p>But this was the Killing Sword Mountain now. What the man actually had was only a sword and a small part of his soul.</p>

  <p>How could Luo Luo Zheng back off from here?</p>

  <p>"I don't want to stick my sword here. I have a higher target," Luo Luo Zheng declared.</p>

  <p>A smile formed on the blue figure's face. "You have a higher goal?</p>

  <p>You, a young man at grade two of the nature level?</p>

  <p>I was aiming for the top of the Killing Sword Mountain! But I discovered I was not as strong as I had expected and had to stick my sword here. Do you think you are stronger than I am?"</p>

  <p>"You will have your answer once we test our strengths," Luo Luo Zheng quickly answered.</p>

  <p>Since he was merely a part of a soul, Luo Luo Zheng didn't want to talk anymore. He was ready to fight.</p>

  <p>The blue figure smiled and said, "Your arrival here did surprise me since you're only grade two of the nature level. More importantly, you have your own sword spirit. Is this your first time coming to the Killing Sword Mountain?</p>

  <p>I am a Man on the Ice Sword, named Iceni. I really admire your talent.</p>

  <p>But this will not change the outcome. I am at a level much higher than yours, and what I have learned about sword skills is far greater than what you know."</p>

  <p>After he finished saying this, Iceni waved his sword towards Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Clink!"</p>

  <p>Two swords smashed into one another.</p>

  <p>Technically, Luo Zheng's sword, which was a low-level fairy weapon, should not be able to hit a sacred weapon. There was a huge gap between his sword and that of the blue figure's.</p>

  <p>But because a sword spirit covered Luo Zheng's sword, its strength was greatly enhanced. It was this that enabled him to attack a sacred weapon, like that of the blue figure's, even with just a fairy weapon.</p>

  <p>After only one round, the blue figure spoke again in surprise, "Oh...You have become adept at the basic sword skill... No, not just adept. But your sword skill seems to have been enhanced.</p>

  <p>How can that happen?</p>

  <p>How can you simplify it to such extent?"</p>

  <p>The blue figure's face registered astonishment that seemed to say he did not understand Luo Zheng's sword skill at all.</p>

  <p>Each warrior who could impel his sword on the grounds of the Killing Sword Mountain was a talent on his way to cultivate further sword skills.</p>

  <p>Of course, there were still distinctions among talented people. For instance, some men only came to the Killing Sword Mountain once, right after learning the consummation of sword intent the first time, but some others could do it a second time as they went further and progressed to a level higher than the consummation of sword intent.</p>

  <p>There were many fanatics of sword skills, who were fascinated by all types of sword skills.</p>

  <p>Apparently, the basic sword skill Luo Luo Zheng used just now managed to attract the blue figure.</p>

  <p>"Interesting. Wonderful. A basic sword skill can have such great power.</p>

  <p>It's true that the world is so big that nothing is surprising anymore. A young man like you can master such an amazing basic sword skill. I know now how you've gotten this far on the mountain!" the blue figure spoke to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Waving his sword simultaneously, he continued, "But I will not let you go on. There is no place for you up there!"</p>

  <p>Impatience had Luo Luo Zheng replying, "You keep mentioning grade two of the nature level. How about you in the real world?</p>

  <p>You're only a piece of a broken soul with a spirit. I also have my sword spirit, yet I am here completely. Are you so sure you can prevent me from going on?" With a cold smile, the young disciple started to stir his sword. He refused to listen to the garrulous blue figure. What he wanted was to cut this blue image and its sword spirit into pieces as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>"You arrogant young man! I have lived hundreds of years and practiced sword skills for as many years. My understanding of sword skills is beyond your imagination or comprehension. I am strong enough to stop you!" Suddenly, there appeared a bright blue light from the sword of the blue figure. Together with the bright blue light were cold currents. With the metal blade completely wrapped in icy currents, it was freezing but gave off an extreme killing intent!</p>

  <p>With just enough arrogance, Luo Luo Zheng sneered at the blue figure and remarked, "After hundreds of years, you're still here on the edge of the mountain ridge. Your strength is just so-so!" Without warning, Luo Luo Zheng used his sword spirit. And instantly, Luo Zheng's Streamer Sword produced a strong killing intent.</p>

  <p>And this one seemed to have the sense of hell.</p>
