<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Leopold came back to the Source World for two reasons. One was to escort Zheng, and the other was to look for the members of the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>In fact, Timotheus didn't give Leopold anything specific to do.</p>

  <p>They had been away from the Source World for too long. After suffering bitterly at the bottom of chaos, they only wanted a peaceful life.</p>

  <p>If Leopold was willing to follow Emily to the Pear Hill, he could happily spend the rest of his life with the Snake Goddess race.</p>

  <p>But he didn't do that. Instead he went to the Pearl Islet. He was trying to find signs the Nine Li race left.</p>

  <p>His hard work paid off. He found some leads.</p>

  <p>He followed the trail of clues and actually found the last surviving members of the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>Zheng's face changed at the mention of Leopold. He asked, "Master Athemar, where is Leopold?"</p>

  <p>Sensing Zheng's eagerness, Athemar smiled and simply replied, "Follow me."</p>

  <p>Zheng walked up to Athemar's huge sword and flew away from the Flow Sword Sect. They soared over Oneness Mountain, flew to the northern slope, and finally landed.</p>

  <p>His landing point was the Splendid Palace, where the people of the Oneness Mountain received their distinguished guests.</p>

  <p>Zheng hurried into the Splendid Palace and saw more than ten people sitting inside, and Leopold was among them.</p>

  <p>"Leopold!"</p>

  <p>"Zheng!"</p>

  <p>Leopold traveled to the Source World with Emily. After he was separated from Zheng, he had lost all hope. His expression was one of surprised delight as he saw Zheng again.</p>

  <p>At first, he didn't know where Zheng was. Yan talked to the people of Pear Hill and organized a search party to look for Zheng. That was when he discovered the young man was in the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p id="top">The Oneness Sky Palace was an orthodox human force. If Zheng could get his foot in the door, he might be able to turn them into powerful allies.</p>

  <p>After finding the remnants of the Nine Li race, Leopold told Ambrose Li about Zheng. But they couldn't find a good time to go to the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>After hearing of what had happened in the Grand Sky Temple, they finally decided to risk a journey to the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>"It hasn't been that long since we last saw each other, but your cultivation base has reached the thirteenth stage of the Other Shore Realm. I'm jealous of what you've accomplished," said Leopold, looking Zheng up and down in surprise.</p>

  <p>Zheng had just made it to the Sea of Truth before he first came to the Source World. At that time, his strength and cultivation were far weaker than Leopold's. But now he was much stronger than his friend.</p>

  <p>"I'm flattered. I was lucky," Zheng replied modestly.</p>

  <p>"Come, let's say hi to the chieftain! I'll introduce you," Leopold said as he pulled Zheng to the rear.</p>

  <p>Behind them stood a burly old man.</p>

  <p>The old man had a poor complexion. His aura seemed restrained, and he was no longer as strong as he had once been. However, his big eyes shone brightly. Anyone would be intimidated if they had to look him in the eye.</p>

  <p>"The chieftain?" Zheng was confused.</p>

  <p>According to his information, Chiyou was the only chieftain of the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>Leopold said, "The Nine Li race is divided into nine tribes. Besides the Grand Chieftain, there are eight others. They're the Grand Chieftain's brothers. This is your Grandpa Ambrose."</p>

  <p>Chiyou was the Grand Chieftain, followed by Harvey, Ambrose and the others.</p>

  <p>Ambrose's eyes had been fixed on Zheng ever since he had entered the Splendid Palace.</p>

  <p>After Chiyou was defeated, there was no chance for him to reclaim their power. The divine land was just a place that Chiyou built to continue the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>When the chaos was destroyed, the divine land would also be gone. The Nine Li race would then disappear forever, only remembered in the annals of history.</p>

  <p>Ambrose would never have imagined a descendant of the Nine Li race would return to the Source World from the divine land.</p>

  <p>Zheng addressed the old man, "Grandpa Ambrose."</p>

  <p>Athemar knew who Zheng was, and Leopold was no outsider. Zheng wasn't going to hide his identity from these people.</p>

  <p>"Lorena was just a little girl when she left. Now, her son is grown up," said Ambrose with a gratified look.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded and said, "My mother lives in the divine land now. She misses you too."</p>

  <p>"Let me introduce you. This is my grandson, Hutton, and my granddaughter, Sally. Have you met them before?" A man and a woman had been flanking Ambrose. Now they stepped forward.</p>

  <p>The man was dressed in a suit made of golden silk, and his eyes were as sharp as a knife. The woman wore a silk dress, and was petite and lovely.</p>

  <p>When she smiled, two sweet dimples appeared, which made her very approachable.</p>

  <p>Ambrose had his own reasons for introducing Sally and Hutton.</p>

  <p>The remnants of the Nine Li race knew Zheng's story. Leopold filled them in.</p>

  <p>They even knew that he was in the Oneness Sky Palace, but he had never been here before.</p>

  <p>At that time, Zheng's strength was too low. If he had an outstanding talent, it would be better for him to stay in the Oneness Sky Palace to further develop his talents. After all, the Nine Li race was too weak to cultivate him.</p>

  <p>However, the information that Hutton and his group brought back from the Dark Region made Ambrose restless.</p>

  <p>Hutton told Ambrose that when he explored the Grand Sky Temple and the Dark Region, he met a corporeal body that had the blood of the Nine Li race, and was related to Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>This information, together with the news that Leopold brought to Ambrose, suggested that the corporeal body was none other than Zheng.</p>

  <p>Ambrose took a big risk leaving in order to verify it.</p>

  <p>Zheng glanced at Sally. "Yes, we've met. We explored the Dark Region together. Hard to forget when we almost died." His voice was deeper than usual.</p>

  <p>"You're Tianxing!"</p>

  <p>Sally had been quietly observing Zheng. She had never seen his real face before, and his voice was not as deep as Tianxing's, so she wasn't sure whether this man really was him.</p>

  <p>After she heard Zheng's voice, she was one hundred percent sure, and a bright smile appeared on her face.</p>

  <p>"I asked you to find me, but I didn't expect it would be so soon," Zheng said with a smile. "You're not outsiders. You don't have to call me Tianxing. My name is Zheng."</p>

  <p>Hutton bowed to Zheng. "After we said goodbye in the Dark Region, I thought we'd never see you again. But you left the Other Shore safely. I am glad to see you here."</p>

  <p>Sally and Hutton were very interested in what happened to Zheng after they parted. Zheng couldn't tell them much. His experiences involved Feng Ge and the purified being, and those were secrets of the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>This reunion proved what the last members of the Nine Li race had theorized. Tianxing was Zheng, and Zheng was from the divine land.</p>

  <p>And Zheng had his questions answered. He knew what was going on with the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>Only Ambrose stayed with the Nine Li race. The other chieftains had been dead or missing.</p>

  <p>To complicate matters further, the Bearing race had been secretly hunting down the remnants of the Nine Li race. Any descendants were killed on the spot, so every time the Nine Li people ventured forth, they were putting their lives at risk.</p>

  <p>When he heard what the Bearing race had done, Zheng furrowed his eyebrows. He shouldn't have been merciful to them.</p>

  <p>At last, Ambrose suddenly asked, "Are you willing to live among the Nine Li race?"</p>
