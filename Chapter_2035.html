<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2035 At The End Of His Forbearance </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Being caught inside the space of Maha's Grand World Technique, you were already considered powerless. All of the rules were decided by him.</p>

  <p>Whether it would be the laws of the five elements, the Time Law or the Space Law, it had basically no effect once you were inside it.</p>

  <p>What was more amazing was that Maha could even change the pattern of laws on his own!</p>

  <p>"Does this mean that, within this guy's Grand World Technique, even the Heavenly Destiny is useless?" Supreme Lord of Oracle asked with furrowed brows.</p>

  <p>In this way, if a Supreme Lord would be caught in the space of Maha's Grand World Technique, using their Heavenly Destiny would be an empty attack and they would even be killed by him.</p>

  <p>"Yes. But Maha hasn't condensed his Godly Tile yet, so his Grand World Technique isn't complete. He isn't able to change all of the rules.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Healum's Space Lock belongs to the Space Law, and is most likely to be changed by the Grand World Technique. That's why Maha cut it apart so easily," Wynn explained.</p>

  <p>"I see," Supreme Lord of Oracle said with a nod. The first time she met Maha, the latter was rude to her. Right at that moment, she already had the urge to kill him. If it was not for the good of the whole, she might not be able to control her desire to kill him.</p>

  <p>"What about Nathan's life? How to avenge him…" Supreme Lord of Original Sin who had his eyes closed for a long time suddenly opened them.</p>

  <p>It was him who offered to put Nathan at risk. He had prepared everything thoroughly, but he did not expect this mistake to occur at the last moment. Supreme Lord of Original Sin invested too much effort on him that he wouldn't just watch his own son die without due justice.</p>

  <p>Hearing his grievance, Master Feng uttered, "Wait a little longer. As long as our enemy wouldn't act to damage Nathan's body, there is still a chance for Supreme Lord Lester to resurrect him."</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Lester's Heavenly Destiny used for resurrecting the dead was extremely powerful. As long as the corpse was intact and without heavy damages, it had a high possibility to be completely brought back to life. But looking at the current situation, Maha might not even give him this opportunity…</p>

  <p>At this point, Supreme Lord of Original Sin was already in a violent rage.</p>

  <p>Being the leader of the four great clans and known to be one of the top-rank Supreme Lords in the Evolutionary Universe, he deeply felt a sense of desolation and resentment in his heart given that he wasn't able to protect his own son. He couldn't even act on his own regardless of his incomparably powerful strength in consideration of the general interest of everyone.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, within the Sunflower Water World, Maha casually waved his hand and the purple light retreated like a tide, continuously gathering in his hand.</p>

  <p>After he stopped performing the Grand World Technique, there were several human martial artists who flew towards the top of the hill. These human martial artists didn't come for Maha or Connie, but their only target was Nathan's body.</p>

  <p>Previously, some others had failed when they challenged Maha, causing their death. If their bodies were still unscathed and unharmed, other martial artists would come collect them.</p>

  <p>At that time, Maha didn't try to stop those martial artists and allowed them to take away the bodies. But it was different this time. He wouldn't allow these martial artists to collect Nathan's body. He brandished his long blade slightly, and several rays of golden light shot out.</p>

  <p>"Puff! Puff! Puff..."</p>

  <p>On the other side, the martial artists were advancing on their goal which was to collect Nathan's body but were suddenly forced back. Several rays of golden light unexpectedly shot down from the sky making them halt and retreat their steps. One of the martial artists angrily looked up at the source of the attack and shouted, "Maha! Don't go too far. You have already killed Nathan, and we're just taking his body back."</p>

  <p>"Oh, really?" Maha's face cracked a smile. He slowly descended from the sky releasing an Mu Ning which frightened all of the martial artists present. None of them dared to make a move, and they only heard Maha continue to speak, "I will allow you to collect the corpses of the others.</p>

  <p>But for this corpse, you can't take it away."</p>

  <p>"Why?" The martial artist was taken by surprise by the sudden statement and angrily questioned.</p>

  <p>"My pets are hungry, and I'm going to feed this young man's corpse to them," Maha casually replied. He laughed and at the same time clapped his hands.</p>

  <p>In a flash, a martial artist flew out from the Iron Moon City carrying a spirit beast bag on his hand. With a light pat, several tall and sturdy wolf-shaped creatures rushed out from the spirit beast bag.</p>

  <p>These wolf-shaped creatures looked extremely fearsome. Their silver fur glittered, making them appear intelligent. After they emerged from the spirit beast bag, they knelt down towards Maha and then howled with their heads held up high. They appeared to be fawning over him…</p>

  <p>Maha in turn reached out his hand to caress the head of one of the wolf-shaped creatures. He lazily pointed to Nathan's corpse and his next words made these martial artists beyond shocked. He said, "You can pig out today. That is a Godly Genius of this universe. His body contains the Mu Ning of Godly Way. Devouring it will be beneficial for all of you."</p>

  <p>These wolf-shaped creatures seemed to have understood what Maha meant and immediately revealed a covetous expression. Their claws extended as they dug at the ground implying that they were eager to have a taste. However, without Maha's permission, they just stood on their spots and didn't dare dash forward to devour the corpse.</p>

  <p>"How could you let these beasts eat our Godly Genius' corpse?" the human martial artist snapped at Maha with an indignant expression on his face.</p>

  <p>Before Nathan went to the Sunflower Water World, these human martial artists already had prepared some plans. In the event where Supreme Lord Healum failed to pull Nathan's body back with the Space Lock, he could only ask others to take his corpse back to the Dead Water World.</p>

  <p>These martial artists had shouldered this mission. They never imagined that Maha would not even give them a chance to fulfill it.</p>

  <p>Maha faintly glanced at the martial artist. His gaze caused the martial artist to feel somewhat uncomfortable, as if he had seen through his thoughts. Maha's next words again made him feel hateful towards him.</p>

  <p>"The loser has no dignity, let alone a corpse. It's already an honor for it to be able to feed my pets…"</p>

  <p>Maha then stood straight and waved his hand at the wolf-shaped creatures, saying, "Go, have it…"</p>

  <p>After giving the order, he turned to leave without looking back.</p>

  <p>Those human martial artists immediately got anxious. Their leader's eyes flashed with a fierce light. He took out a short blade and dashed forward aiming at the wolf-shaped creatures.</p>

  <p>Looking at their leader initiating an attack, these martial artists were about to follow suit but the originally well-behaved wolf-shaped creatures all at once became fierce. Waves of fiendish Mu Ning rushed out from these creatures, and their silver fur began to dance like streaks of silver flame.</p>

  <p>"Grrr..."</p>

  <p>Being provoked, the wolf-shaped creatures didn't miss any minute and charged to the human martial artists at an extremely fast speed.</p>

  <p>These human martial artists were all world lords with powerful strength.</p>

  <p>Yet, in comparison to the wolf-shaped creatures, they failed to resist against them. They were taken aback by the sudden change of events, and before they realized their situation, those wolf-shaped creatures had already bitten off their necks. One head after another rolled down the hill with their eyes wide open in disbelief. They lost their lives just like that.</p>

  <p>They died unjustly!</p>

  <p>Maha cast back a glance and softly sighed, "The Silver Moon Wolf is no ordinary spiritual pet. How can it be so easy to snatch food from super legendary beasts' mouths?"</p>

  <p>After he uttered such words, endless regret flashed on his face as he continued walking down the hill leaving a horrendous sight.</p>

  <p>Connie, who was patiently waiting beside him, stepped forward, draped a silver robe over Maha's shoulders, and then urged him to rest.</p>

  <p>Back on the hill, having killed the world lords, the Silver Moon Wolves turned back to look at Nathan's corpse. These Silver Moon Wolves were the most outstanding spiritual pets of the Sacred race known as the powerful super legendary beasts. They were no ordinary beast belonging to the extremely pure super legendary beast's bloodline. They wouldn't just randomly eat any common world lords' bodies.</p>

  <p>Those common world lords' bodies were way inferior to Nathan's corpse.</p>

  <p>It contained a thick Mu Ning of the Godly Way, and was eminently attractive to the Silver Moon Wolves. They continued to move forward towards Nathan's body and were about to pounce on it but forced to a halt.</p>

  <p>An exceedingly formidable Mu Ning was suddenly emitted. A scorching white space crack appeared in the sky just above the hill.</p>

  <p>"Stop!"</p>

  <p>An explosive shout resounded from the space crack as an exceptionally strong Mu Ning emitted. Sensing this power, the Silver Moon Wolves whimpered in surrender as they retreated backwards out of their animal instincts.</p>

  <p>They felt that if they didn't back away in an instant, they would die for sure!</p>

  <p>In the Dead Water World, Supreme Lord of Original Sin was seething.</p>

  <p>In a rush, he constructed an incandescent space channel in front of him.</p>

  <p>With his strength, he would easily smash those damned Silver Moon Wolves into pieces once he entered it.</p>

  <p>"No!"</p>

  <p>"Buddy!" "That's not a good idea!"</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>The patriarch of the Ji Clan and the patriarch of the Lie Clan, together with Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment stood in front of Supreme Lord of Original Sin in unison.</p>

  <p>"If you act recklessly, you will drag the entire universe into an irreparable calamity. Supreme Lord of Original Sin, please think twice!"</p>
