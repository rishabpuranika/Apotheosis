  <p>
</p>

  <p>"You've just torn his armor open!" Tianming exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"It didn't last long," Luo Zheng said. "Besides, I didn't know that he had a secret soul weapon." He trusted No. 9527, and he believed that no secret soul weapon could block it in the divine land. The secret soul weapon Pascal had must have been given to him by the Yellow Emperor Guards. "I'll try again!" Luo Zheng said resolutely.</p>

  <p>If they let Pascal continue to do what he was doing, everyone would definitely have no means to escape. Luo Zheng had no intention of sitting around waiting for his death.</p>

  <p>After he finished speaking, Luo Zheng's body gently floated, and a pair of thunder wings suddenly extended and spread open behind him. With a loud crack, he hurtled toward his target. He already had Pascal's position locked in.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Tianming also quickened his pace and approached Pascal from the other side.</p>

  <p>"Holy Emperor, Luo Zheng is coming..."</p>

  <p>Using his spiritual sense, Alfredo identified a consummate True God hurtling toward him at breakneck speed. Even in the darkness, he recognized Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Hmmm. He already knows my location, huh..." Pascal sneered. He held the black sphere with one hand and conjured a spear with the other. At the same time, the huge wings behind him morphed from the original soft black feathers into sharp knives. "Step aside," he said to Alfredo.</p>

  <p>Hearing his words, Alfredo immediately distanced himself from him.</p>

  <p>The two warriors were so powerful that their strength far exceeded those of Holy Beings. Alfredo could never withstand any attack from them.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng sped towards Pascal, the Ways-blending Energy frantically accumulated. The long sword in his hand kept trembling and whistling...</p>

  <p>As the two warriors got closer, Luo Zheng suddenly waved his long arm.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The sound of the long sword shattering into pieces resounded in the darkness.</p>

  <p>Just before the long sword broke into pieces, a strong and violent beam of sword radiance rushed straight towards Pascal.</p>

  <p>"Nice timing!"</p>

  <p>Pascal had foreseen this strike from Luo Zheng, so he was fully prepared.</p>

  <p>He suddenly shook his long black spear, and black energy continuously gathered at the tip of the spear. As he jerked forward, the whole spear totally turned into spear radiance and shot forward.</p>

  <p>"Sky Crushing Stab!"</p>

  <p>Buzz.</p>

  <p>As a master of spears, Samuel had a superb understanding of spears.</p>

  <p>He had calculated his spear strike precisely; it directly collided with the Ways-blending Strike that Luo Zheng had launched.</p>

  <p>The two kinds of energy collided, and the Ways-blending Energy exploded once more.</p>

  <p>At the time, all light in the entire divine land was gone. The collision of the two energies did not emit any light; instead, a thunder-like sound was heard, and a shock wave radiated from the point of impact.</p>

  <p>A consummate True God and a Demi-holy Being who were somewhere close were thrown to the ground by the shock wave. Black spears rained down their heads, and they perished immediately after being pierced.</p>

  <p>"Come on!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't stop for a second. After lashing out once, he reached out his hand and pulled another long sword out of his space ring.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>He launched a second Ways-blending Strike.</p>

  <p>The sword exploded into pieces and fell from his hand.</p>

  <p>He reached out to draw another long sword and desperately channeled the Ways-blending Energy from within him. The third strike slashed out again.</p>

  <p>As he launched three strikes in a row, Luo Zheng struggled to hold on.</p>

  <p>Although his body harnessed an incredible amount of internal momentum, he needed to combine the power of more than two thousand Divine Dao to produce the Ways-blending Energy. At that point, the speed at which the Divine Dao merged was considerably slower than the rate that Luo Zheng's energy was consumed.</p>

  <p>He had reached his limit after consecutively executing three Ways-blending Strikes.</p>

  <p>Pascal was astounded as he felt two more beams of sword radiance coming straight at him.</p>

  <p>He didn't expect that three powerful sword strikes could be launched instantaneously.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's tricks couldn't possibly have been taught by the strong warriors at the Other Shore Realm. The energy was the combined internal momentum of many Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>God knew how this boy did it.</p>

  <p>The sword radiance was too close, so it was too late for Pascal to dodge.</p>

  <p>The wings on his back suddenly extended and folded to totally enclose him.</p>

  <p>This time, he actually intended to receive the attack!</p>

  <p>Thwack!</p>

  <p>Thwack!</p>

  <p>The two beams of sword radiance directly hit the pair of black wings.</p>

  <p>The Ways-blending Energy was extraordinarily powerful. After the Ways-blending Energy in the first strike burst out, the powerful impact forcefully wrenched the wings open.</p>

  <p>The second sword radiance struck on Pascal's armor. The armor that had just been repaired was torn apart once again.</p>

  <p>"This is my chance..."</p>

  <p>In the darkness, Luo Zheng espied a blind spot on Pascal's body by using his spiritual sense. This spot was the area covered by the blood jade necklace.</p>

  <p>As a soul weapon, the blood jade necklace could not only deflect a soul attack but also destroy the spiritual sense used to detect it.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng quickly approached while taking out the fourth weapon. The moment Luo Zheng thrust the spear into that spot, a warning from No. 9527 resounded in his mind, "Be careful, Luo Zheng. It's a trap!"</p>

  <p>Startled, Luo Zheng sharply turned around almost on reflex and felt an extremely powerful aura brush past him.</p>

  <p>"What a sly kid!" Pascal's disappointed voice rang in the darkness.</p>

  <p>The moment Luo Zheng tore his armor open, Pascal had taken the necklace off.</p>

  <p>The blood jade necklace could cover a certain range, and Luo Zheng was virtually blind in the darkness. Since he solely relied on his spiritual sense for detection, he only intended to stab at the spot that his spiritual sense couldn't reach.</p>

  <p>With Pascal's cunning misdirection, Luo Zheng would inevitably miss his target.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Pascal had seized the chance to stab Luo Zheng from the other side with his long black spear.</p>

  <p>Pascal was a dishonorable, devious person to have used such a method to mislead Luo Zheng. If not for No. 9527's reminder, the spear might have cut Luo Zheng's stomach open.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng dodged the spear, but he was placed in a difficult spot. Pascal had returned the blood jade necklace to its original place around his neck. The broken armor was regenerated, and his broken wings were repaired. He began to crazily attack Luo Zheng, who was now at a disadvantage.</p>

  <p>A slight shake of his black wings sent black feathers, which were as sharp as knives, flying wildly toward Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Worse, Luo Zheng also had to dodge the spears that were constantly dropping overhead and rays of spear radiance that Pascal occasionally shot out.</p>

  <p>Even if Luo Zheng had activated the Truth of Cultivation Nature and utilized the Eight Smoky Melodies to the limit, he was still in danger.</p>

  <p>Phew!</p>

  <p>A feather grazed past behind Luo Zheng, leaving a deep furrow on his back. Even with Luo Zheng's immense physical strength, he was incapable of resisting that type of black energy.</p>

  <p>As he registered the sharp pain in his back, Luo Zheng felt something cold touch his shoulder. His shoulder was pierced by a long spear...</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng knew he was in big trouble and his heart sank. He couldn't elude Pascal's attacks.</p>

  <p>His only consolation was that the black energy could not destroy his body like it did to the other people. But, if the attacks persisted, he would be torn to pieces by Pascal eventually.</p>
