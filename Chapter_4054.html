  <p>
</p>

  <p>As soon as Bacchus finished speaking, the Glede Demons followed suit and spread their wings.</p>

  <p>White light flashed on their heads as pairs of white wings wrapped their bodies.</p>

  <p>They had merged with the Treacherous Beings named Wolf Owls.</p>

  <p>The hostility-level Treacherous Beings were also divided into varying grades— the Wolf Owls were the strongest among all.</p>

  <p>With their great size, they wrapped around the Glede Demons like armor, drastically improving their defensive power, strength, and speed.</p>

  <p>So long as the Treacherous Beings remained intact, one could say that killing a Glede Demon was nearly impossible.</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...</p>

  <p>The Glede Demons rushed into the air, floating closely behind Bacchus.</p>

  <p>As long as the latter gave an order, they would fall like sharp knives and cut the Red Demons to pieces.</p>

  <p>But much to their dismay, Bacchus remained silent.</p>

  <p>Never before had his intuition failed him.</p>

  <p>The Red Demons' performance today was indeed strange.</p>

  <p>Tate, in particular, seemed especially strange.</p>

  <p>Relying merely on the birdcage wouldn't have given him so much confidence.</p>

  <p>He was well aware of Bacchus' strength.</p>

  <p>Even in a head-on fight, the Red Demons would also suffer a great loss.</p>

  <p>From the looks of it, the Red Demon race still had a backup plan available to them.</p>

  <p>"Leader! Let's head down there and charge!" called out one of the Glede Demons.</p>

  <p>It was none other than Bacchus' assistant, whose eyes were full of fighting spirit.</p>

  <p>"Let's cut these Red Demons to pieces!"</p>

  <p>"How dare these guys be so arrogant…"</p>

  <p>"They're courting death!"</p>

  <p>These Glede Demons had always thought themselves to be the noblest race on the Night View Island. It was only natural that they thought so low of the Red Demon race.</p>

  <p>Especially when the latter provoked them— the Glede Demon race had been fully prepared to fight to kill.</p>

  <p>But Bacchus seemed to remain rather hesitant.</p>

  <p>He looked at the faint smile on Tate's face— the latter must have been scheming.</p>

  <p>But what sort of method could the Red Demons have that could allow them to defeat the other race so easily?</p>

  <p>No such method existed, as far as Bacchus knew.</p>

  <p>At the very least, he had never seen such a thing on the Night View Island.</p>

  <p>As Bacchus thought it through, his eyes grew colder and colder.</p>

  <p>Then, he spread out his wings.</p>

  <p>Under the white light, the wings were like sharp swords that covered him.</p>

  <p>The ordinary Glede Demons had merged with Wolf Owls which were hostility-level Treacherous Beings.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Bacchus had merged with a resentment-level Treacherous Being.</p>

  <p>It was the Wolf Owl King!</p>

  <p>Its white wings were enchantingly beautiful, decorated with unique runes all over.</p>

  <p>Once these runes were activated, wisps of blue lightning circled the wings.</p>

  <p>From the blue electric current formed the outline of a Wolf Owl— it was visible from quite the distance, even in the night.</p>

  <p>"The warriors of Glede Demon race, charge to kill!"</p>

  <p>At the very moment Bacchus gave the order, the Glede Demons immediately turned into white lights, all of them surging downward.</p>

  <p>Their charge was truly terrifying.</p>

  <p>Their size was intimidating enough, but they were also incomparably agile to top it off. Not even the Red Demons, who had protective leathery skin, could resist their fast attacks.</p>

  <p>And after the Glede Demons had merged with Wolf Owls, their strength was increased dramatically.</p>

  <p>When they flew down like this, they were nothing like birds.</p>

  <p>Instead, they seemed more like giant sabers descending from the sky that could pierce through anything that got in their way.</p>

  <p>After battling the Glede Demon race for so many years, the Red Demon race clearly knew of their terrifying power.</p>

  <p>But of course, they had their own means to deal with them.</p>

  <p>It was time for them to summon their Treacherous Beings, which were black turtles.</p>

  <p>These were a kind of extremely solid worm-shaped creatures.</p>

  <p>Once the Red Demons merged with them, they produced a solid armor that could cover any surface of their bodies.</p>

  <p>The black turtles could indeed resist the Glede Demons' attack, but that was it. If the Red Demons wanted to hurt them, they were in for quite the challenge.</p>

  <p>Most of the Red Demons could only suffer passive attacks in the fight against the Glede Demon race.</p>

  <p>But this time, the action of the Red Demon race was very unexpected.</p>

  <p>Facing the other race, they didn't activate the Treacherous Beings immediately, but instead raised their hands one after another.</p>

  <p>Each of them carried a small stone in their hands.</p>

  <p>All the bean-sized stones glowed brightly with some sort of light.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>The Light of Annihilation suddenly burst out from the stones.</p>

  <p>While the Glede Demons leading the charge couldn't tell what it was, they could sense something was wrong. Still, they continued to rush along.</p>

  <p>'It's just a ray of light…</p>

  <p>Even if it's powerful, so what?</p>

  <p>How much harm could it really do?'</p>

  <p>'It couldn't possibly penetrate the Treacherous Beings and kill us, anyway, ' they thought to themselves.</p>

  <p>Indeed, the Light of Annihilation couldn't penetrate the Treacherous Beings, much less directly kill the Glede Demons.</p>

  <p>But it could actually kill the Treacherous Beings themselves.</p>

  <p>The hostility-level Treacherous Beings fell in fear of the Light of Annihilation— they had no means to resist it.</p>

  <p>Any of them that the light touched was sure to be killed.</p>

  <p>"Splash..."</p>

  <p>The Wolf Owls that were attached to the surface of the Glede Demons began rapidly collapsing under the light.</p>

  <p>When the Glede Demons rushed to the front of the Red Demons, the Wolf Owls on their bodies suddenly shattered, turning to nothing but dust.</p>

  <p>Still, the Glade Demon race was one of the highest-ranked races on the Night View Island.</p>

  <p>Even without being able to rely on the Treacherous Beings, they still possessed extraordinary strength— they could defeat the vast majority of any creatures with their raw strength.</p>

  <p>But the Red Demon race was known to be just as powerful— they could also make use of Treacherous Beings.</p>

  <p>Their hands continued to emit a white light, and soon, they were wearing a layer of white 'gloves.' From this layer grew out sets of sharp claws.</p>

  <p>The black turtles weren't only able to provide the Red Demons with impressive defensive power, but they also had their own pair of sharp claws.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>And so the Red Demons waved their sharp claws, grabbing at the Glede Demons.</p>

  <p>If the Glede Demons were still in possession of the Treacherous Beings as protections, then the Red Demons' claws were useless. At the worst, they could merely leave some scars on their bodies, all of which would recover immediately.</p>

  <p>And the Glede Demons could also use the Wolf Owls' claws to do the same to the Red Demons— the latter could recover just as instantaneously.</p>

  <p>For thousands of years, the evenly-matched forces were stuck in an on and off battle.</p>

  <p>But because the Glede Demons were faster and more agile, more often than not, they held the initiative.</p>

  <p>But this time, the Glede Demons' Treacherous Beings had been destroyed.</p>

  <p>Sharp claws cut into the Glede Demons, tearing them to pieces.</p>

  <p>Their wings, heads, and torsos were all completely separated.</p>

  <p>They died a truly miserable death.</p>

  <p>In the first round of charge, the five to six Glede Demons that had rushed to the front lost all protection from the Treacherous Beings and were easily torn to bits.</p>

  <p>Behind them, the other Glede Demons were stunned in shock before they suddenly surged high into the sky.</p>

  <p>Their speed was so incredible that they almost hit the ceiling of the birdcage in the sudden turn— they had to fly close to the cage walls for a time before they could properly distance themselves from the Red Demon race.</p>

  <p>But Bacchus followed closely behind them to charge.</p>

  <p>Tate, of course, was his target.</p>

  <p>His main goal remained to be the Ghost Mountain— he didn't want to fight hand-to-hand with the Red Demon race.</p>

  <p>Once the leader was taken care of, dealing with the rest was a piece of cake.</p>

  <p>He was stronger than Tate, after all.</p>

  <p>After taking care of him, the Red Demons would disperse naturally.</p>

  <p>But just as he rushed toward Tate, the latter pulled out a small triangular stone.</p>

  <p>In the next moment, the Light of Annihilation struck Bacchus' body with deadly precision.</p>

  <p>The Wolf Owl King was a resentment-level Treacherous Being, after all.</p>

  <p>It wasn't like a mere hostility-level Treacherous Being that would shatter directly under the Light of Annihilation.</p>

  <p>But in an instant, Bacchus felt a heart-wrenching pain from the 'Wolf Owl King.' The latter's wings, feathers, head, and tail all drooped down as if it had lost all strength, slumping onto Bacchus' body like a deflated balloon.</p>

  <p>In such a state, the Treacherous Being could no longer protect Bacchus.</p>

  <p>How could Tate let such an opportunity go to waste?</p>

  <p>Like iron pincers, his large hands grabbed at Bacchus' head.</p>
