  <p>Bending downwards, Luo Zheng stretched his arms and picked up a handful of sand from the ground.</p>

  <p>The sand radiated a slight tinge of warmth. If examining carefully, one could definitely feel that the sand had a hint of energy from within.</p>

  <p>"No one fuses with the Crimson Golden Sand, because it is the weakest kind of Other Shore Tokens. It only contains the force of half a divine megaton," Ling Shuang explained. She lifted her hand and began to point at some bare stones not so far away from where they were and continued, "See those stones? Those are the Heavenly Cyan Stones. Whenever a warrior fuses with it, they automatically gain the force of a divine megaton!"</p>

  <p>"Heavenly Cyan Stone..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes widened as soon as he saw the familiar stones.</p>

  <p>He recalled that he saw one when Monica had brought him into the Dragon City for the very first time. Someone had verified his strength using the red stone in the city. He had the force of two Jun, and his Other Shore Token was a Heavenly Cyan Stone.</p>

  <p>Taking a step forward, Luo Zheng carefully picked up a Heavenly Cyan Stone from the ground and observed it keenly. Scanning the stone very meticulously, he found that the power radiated by the stone was stronger than that of the Crimson Golden Sand.</p>

  <p>"So I guess that what they're saying is true. It seems that the Other Shore is a place full of treasures. You can literally get one on every corner," Luo Zheng said, heaving a heavy sigh.</p>

  <p>He was not afraid of any True God. In fact, he was even able to deal with a warrior who had just reached the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>Last time, he had used up all of his strength. However, the red stone only indicated that he merely had the force of one divine megaton. Frustrated by the result, he desired such a stone that could double his force. Now that he had found one, it would be easier for him to strengthen himself.</p>

  <p>"This is not our goal. Let's go!" Ling Shuang reminded as she walked forward.</p>

  <p>Coming from a great background, she belittled such Other Shore Tokens as if they were useless.</p>

  <p>Even after the fusion, warriors could change their Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>However, Ling Shuang was quite different from the rest as she was not in a hurry to do so.</p>

  <p>Upon arriving at the Other Shore, most people chose to walk forward and explore. On the contrary, there were also some who would rather stay in place and not move far away from where they were. With the goal of enhancing their strength, these people combined with the Heavenly Cyan Stones, hoping for a speedy improvement.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore was a powerful area. Everything around it radiated power? a grain of sand, a leaf, basically everything that anyone could get their hands on. In this area, warriors could basically integrate with anything they could touch! Meanwhile, Luo Zheng moved along the beach and felt the strong energy aura with every step he took.</p>

  <p>In fact, he really didn't know what kind of place the Other Shore was. It didn't belong to any part of the chaos, and it felt as if this place was a complete product of one's imagination.</p>

  <p>But the moment his soul stepped into the Other Shore, everything felt so real.</p>

  <p>The beach stretched to about six or seven miles long. Luo Zheng and Ling Shuang were able to cross it in five minutes. The powerful beach was next to a lot of other beautiful and dynamic places. But what captured his eyes most was the green plain next to it that boasted its luscious trees and breeze.</p>

  <p>"This one is called Angelica Dahurica. Its function is almost the same as the Heavenly Cyan Stone and they are regarded as the weeds of the Other Shore. Although it is suitable for the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, I still think that it is too weak...</p>

  <p>This is a Birch Leaf. It has a healing effect after being fused.</p>

  <p>Wait, look at that. That one is the?"</p>

  <p>Ling Shuang pointed at every different thing she had seen in the Origin Mountain. Even though it was her first time to enter the Other Shore, she was already quite familiar with the ordinary things in the area. In fact, she could recognize them with just a quick glance. She knew them like the back of her hands.</p>

  <p>No matter how much she knew about those tokens, it was still apparent that she did not want to fuse with them.</p>

  <p>"Is there any chance that we could use a creature as an Other Shore Token?"</p>

  <p>Upon seeing all of the tokens around the area, Luo Zheng suddenly thought of a seemingly wild question.</p>

  <p>Let it be in the divine land or the Source World, Luo Zheng had never laid his eyes on a warrior who would use a living creature as an Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>Ling Shuang nodded. "Yes, but... It happens very rarely. From the ancient times up until now, the fusion of living creatures is rarely seen due to its immense difficulty..."</p>

  <p>The Other Shore was full of life. There might be living creatures here, but it was still difficult for Souls of Light to capture them. Moreover, these creatures on the Other Shore had already killed countless people.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, there was a master in the Origin Mountain who had fused with a Heaven Divine Ape. Integrating with the ape gave him huge progress, making him one of the well-known masters in the Origin Mountain.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, as Ling Shuang and Luo Zheng talked to each other, three people from a distance started to walk towards them.</p>

  <p>The person who led the group stepped forward, greeting them. Looking directly at the two warriors, the man spoke, "Hello. Would you like to join us?"</p>

  <p>It seemed that these three had just arrived at the Other Shore along with them. Judging from the Souls of Light that they had, they were perceived to be the best among the over one hundred warriors.</p>

  <p>The three had noticed that Luo Zheng's and Ling Shuang's auras were extraordinary.</p>

  <p>Hence, they invited the two after they had examined them further and seen what they got.</p>

  <p>"What can we get if we accept the invitation?" Ling Shuang walked up and asked seriously.</p>

  <p>Stretching his hand, the leader opened his palm gently, which showed some dense stripes. Afterwards, these stripes changed in form as they turned into a map.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing the stripes, Luo Zheng's eyes flashed in interest.</p>

  <p>Looking at it, he realized that it was exactly the same as the Other Shore Keys that he had. Curious, he leaned forward and took a closer look, but apparently he found something different. The copper sheet was gone and only those stripes were left.</p>

  <p>As for the map, it was almost the same as what the Ear Mouse had given him.</p>

  <p>Needless to say, one of the Other Shore Keys that he had and the one in the man's hand were the same.</p>

  <p>"I've got an Other Shore Key of the Sacred Mallow Temple. Now, if that strikes your interest, then you are welcome to explore the place with us," the leader said.</p>

  <p>It was a good thing for Luo Zheng to get such information. After all, an Other Shore Key in Stage One was also precious and rare.</p>

  <p>To be honest, Luo Zheng was a little interested, but didn't answer right away. He knew too little about the Other Shore, so he wanted Ling Shuang to decide for the both of them.</p>

  <p>After all, the Other Shore Key in his hand was just the same as what the man had. Even if he didn't join them, he would still be able to find the Sacred Mallow Temple using the exact same map.</p>

  <p>Originally, Ling Shuang had planned to take a stroll around the place with Luo Zheng as she was not in such a hurry. She wanted to take things slow and discuss the fusion of the Other Shore Tokens with Luo Zheng later.</p>

  <p>But when she saw the eagerness in Luo Zheng's eyes to go with the men, she nodded and agreed.</p>

  <p>The head of the group said happily, "That's great. We three have just entered the Other Shore and want to acquire a better Other Shore Token. The journey should be smooth now that you two are on the team!"</p>

  <p>On the way, the three men started to introduce themselves. They belonged to a remote group of the human race. Their leader was Hammer Di, the eldest brother, with siblings Harding Di and Hackett Di.</p>

  <p>In contrast to their big brother, both Harding and Hackett were very quiet and reserved.</p>

  <p>"So, which group of the human race do you belong to?" Hammer asked.</p>

  <p>"The Origin Mountain," Ling Shuang replied curtly.</p>

  <p>Hearing her answer, the three of them changed their attitudes and showed respect towards her. Hammer even made a bow and said, "Y...you are from the Taiyi Heaven Palace! I've always been admiring you guys!"</p>

  <p>Despite being in the same race, they still had a great desire and admiration for the top three forces of the human race.</p>

  <p>But Ling Shuang did not respond for she was extremely scornful about this kind of worship. In fact, before she met Luo Zheng, she had always been very pessimistic about her own identity. Most of the time, she even envied those ordinary people of the Dragon City as she wanted to live a life of simplicity.</p>

  <p>At least, they could struggle for their future and embrace the future that they worked hard for. In short, they could have a choice and run their lives the way they wanted to.</p>

  <p>Since she was born, everything had already been arranged for her, and everything had been the same. She lived a life of monotony.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Hammer continued to lead them through the plain based on the map shown by the Other Shore Key. After making a turn, they arrived at a curved canyon with a dilapidated temple leaned against its cracks.</p>

  <p>Apparently, this was the so-called "Sacred Mallow Temple" that Hammer was referring to.</p>

  <p>Despite the temple being old and dilapidated, its workmanship remained very advanced, along with its exquisite structure.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stared at the temple from a distance and started to think, 'Who could have built this on the Other Shore?'</p>

  <p>However, when Luo Zheng and the others got close to the Sacred Mallow Temple, they found that they weren't the only ones wanting to enter it.</p>
