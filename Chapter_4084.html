<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>When they first reached the Eternal Realm, the Snake Goddess and the Primeval Lord of Heaven already speculated that aside from the bloodlines in the outer and inner circles of the Eternal Scroll Painting, there should be even more powerful bloodlines that existed.</p>

  <p>However, they did not know what kinds of bloodlines there were above the inner circles' bloodlines. After all, no one had ever studied it.</p>

  <p>During their imprisonment in the Night View Island, four of them became the Great Ghost Priests and after they cleared many things with the Monkey Masters, they no longer felt that confused.</p>

  <p>After all, they now knew that the bloodlines in the inner circles were called the root-level bloodlines, and above the root-level bloodlines were the origin-level bloodlines, which were four blended bloodlines.</p>

  <p>In addition to the four bloodlines, the masters in the main world had also merged with many unique bloodlines.</p>

  <p>For instance, the Monkey Spirit King had fused with thirteen types of bloodlines and was one of the most prominent creatures.</p>

  <p>Since he had gotten to blend those bloodlines, then it meant that the Primeval Lord of Heaven could also do the same. Thus, he decided to give it a try, and only then did the human race have a safe place to settle down in the Ghost Mountain.</p>

  <p>Still, putting aside the difficulty to blend the bloodlines, he also knew well that the chances of awakening the Monkey Spirit King through such a method were very slim.</p>

  <p>There were many types of bloodlines in the Eternal Scroll Painting alone.</p>

  <p>According to the information from the Monkey Masters, there were also even more bloodlines in the main world.</p>

  <p>It was much harder to form the thirteen bloodlines that the Monkey Spirit King had, through the permutation and combination of numerous bloodlines.</p>

  <p>What made things worse was that the Primeval Lord of Heaven only had thirty-nine kinds of bloodlines in his hands. He could not use such a small number of bloodlines to create something that met the requirements of the Monkey Spirit King.</p>

  <p>To everyone's surprise, though, he succeeded in blending the bloodlines for the first time, which slightly moved the sleeping Monkey Spirit King. Only then did the Monkey Masters allow him to keep trying out, and he finally felt a glimmer of hope.</p>

  <p>However, just after he fused with his energy soul, he learned the damning truth.</p>

  <p>In general, the ancestry-level bloodline had a total of four quadrants and three hundred and seventy-three abilities.</p>

  <p>When he read the energy soul's memory, he became shocked and distressed.</p>

  <p>It turned out that in the end, what he did was all in vain.</p>

  <p>Anxiety overcame him as he thought about his useless efforts.</p>

  <p>He felt so disappointed that everything passed by almost like a daydream.</p>

  <p>As he moped in his sadness, he read more of his energy soul's memory.</p>

  <p>Then, he was stunned by what he saw.</p>

  <p>He saw that Luo Zheng had merged with the holy treasure of the Four Spirits Sect and the Eternal Divine Courtyard.</p>

  <p>He shook his head again to be sure. Indeed, the young warrior had fused with it.</p>

  <p>He could not contain his excitement when he first saw Luo Zheng, as he felt the aura of the blended bloodline. Could it be that he had obtained an origin-level bloodline?</p>

  <p>That bloodline was more potent than the root-level bloodline! It was almost too good to be true.</p>

  <p>However, he never expected the truth to be entirely beyond his boldest imagination!</p>

  <p>How did he make it?</p>

  <p>Did such an incredible thing really exist in the world?</p>

  <p>Alas, the answer was not in the memory of the energy soul.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng himself did not know that, and the Primeval Lord of Heaven's energy soul was also confused.</p>

  <p>The human heroes stood still and looked at Luo Zheng in disbelief. They all remained silent.</p>

  <p>They felt dumbfounded when they saw the memories of their energy souls.</p>

  <p>It would take a few hours, days, months, or even years for them to digest this information.</p>

  <p>The silence lasted for a long time, until Chiyou decided to speak first. "You are my grandson," he said.</p>

  <p>"Theoretically, that's the case." Luo Zheng nodded with a smile.</p>

  <p>Chiyou's avatar was actually an independent individual.</p>

  <p>Therefore, he did not have a daughter called Lorena in the 77th chaos.</p>

  <p>In other words, Luo Zheng was the grandson of Chiyou's substitute.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha..." Chiyou laughed strangely. Among the thirty-nine heroes, his rank was not that high.</p>

  <p>It was also mainly because of luck that he became a Great Ghost Priest.</p>

  <p>Now that he knew about Luo Zheng's situation, he suddenly felt proud and self-satisfied.</p>

  <p>'My bloodline created an incredible miracle, ' he thought.</p>

  <p>"Your bloodline is out of control..."</p>

  <p>Just as the real Fuxi was about to ask Luo Zheng regarding his lack of control of the ancestry-level bloodline, the Primeval Lord of Heaven raised his hand and gently made a gesture.</p>

  <p>It was a gesture that asked him to keep silent.</p>

  <p>After all, the Ghost Mountain belonged to the Monkey Masters, and they might eavesdrop on the human beings' conversation.</p>

  <p>The ancestry-level bloodline was the holy treasure of the Four Spirits Sect.</p>

  <p>That was why it was a highly important matter that must be kept confidential.</p>

  <p>In any case, they all knew about the same thing through their energy souls.</p>

  <p>"The situation is still quite dangerous. The Element Spirit Civilization has followed the Monkey Masters to try to wake up the Ghost Master," the Snake Goddess said with a frown.</p>

  <p>Everyone else also saw what she mentioned at the end of their memories, which was the scene on the Ghost Altar.</p>

  <p>"We should stop the Element Spirit Civilization. With Luo Zheng's help, we can surely wake up the Ghost Master, as long as we give the Primeval Lord of Heaven some more time," said Zhurong.</p>

  <p>Ultimately, Luo Zheng had the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>That alone could derive any kind of bloodline!</p>

  <p>Many of the human heroes nodded in agreement. They thought that Zhurong's suggestion was reasonable.</p>

  <p>"I'm not sure. At least we can't succeed in completing that task in a short period," the Primeval Lord of Heaven opposed and firmly shook his head.</p>

  <p>Even Luo Zheng could not control the ancestry-level bloodline? sometimes it worked, and sometimes it did not. It was not easy to figure the reason out in a limited time.</p>

  <p>"The Monkey Masters don't care who wakes up the Ghost Master," the real Snake Goddess said.</p>

  <p>Since the Element Spirit Civilization had obtained the teeth, they might be able to wake up the Ghost Master. If that happened, then the humans would be useless to the Monkey Masters, and they could not stop that from happening at all.</p>

  <p>"Then we can only place our hopes on..." At that moment, Fuxi waved his hand.</p>

  <p>"We can only hope that the Element Spirit Civilization would fail," said the real Fuxi.</p>

  <p>Everyone was silent again, and they just hid their hesitance and unwillingness under their bright gazes.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had gone all the way to the Night View Island, and he was the best gift given to the human race. Unfortunately, the Element Spirit Civilization was like a ghost that chased after them all the time, which always made them feel stressed and worried.</p>

  <p>Now, they could only wish that the Element Spirit Civilization would fail.</p>

  <p>Just then, Manuel pushed open the large door and led the Eye Spirit in.</p>

  <p>When the Eye Spirit entered, his eyeball contracted sharply.</p>

  <p>Behind the large door was a massive throne, where a mountain-like creature sat.</p>

  <p>It was the Monkey Spirit King, Orlando.</p>

  <p>He was one of the strongest sect leaders of the Four Spirits Sect.</p>

  <p>Even if there were hostility-level, resentment-level, and hatred-level Treacherous Beings, all the Monkey Masters were greater than all of them.</p>

  <p>And the Monkey Spirit King outranked them all.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King was also a Treacherous Being, but he looked like he did not have a lot of the Treacherous Being's features. Instead, he looked like an immensely powerful physical body.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King sat on the enormous throne as if he had fallen asleep, with his big, ferocious head tilted to the side and his eyes tightly closed.</p>

  <p>The Eye Spirit could hardly imagine what kind of light and horrible pressure the Monkey Spirit King's eyes would release when he woke up him.</p>

  <p>Manuel stretched out his hand.</p>

  <p>Four wolf teeth had appeared in his palm.</p>

  <p>There were already three wolf teeth in the Ghost Mountain, and plus the one that the Eye Spirit gave to the cyan-skinned Great Ghost Priest, there were four wolf teeth in total.</p>

  <p>As soon as Manuel displayed the four wolf teeth in front, Orlando slightly moved on the throne. It was a sign of his awakening.</p>
