<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>At the edge of the Freezing Wilderness, there were two crystal-like ice frogs sleeping more than a hundred feet deep underground.</p>

  <p>This certain species of ice frogs was very rare. As long as there was no external factor that would awaken them, they could continuously sleep for about a thousand years.</p>

  <p>Thus, they were considered as one of the most popular Other Shore Tokens that could be found in the Supreme Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a powerful force was digging from above. The huge vibration caused by it awakened the ice frogs.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A white mist was released from their bodies. This mist was of extremely low temperature. It could not only form a protective layer on their bodies, but also freeze the surrounding enemies to death.</p>

  <p>However, the digger from above, who was a fire spirit from the Element Spirit race, didn't have a hint of fear for the deadly white mist.</p>

  <p>As the white mist surged up the hole that he was digging, the fire spirit just let out a mocking laugh. In an instant, his blazing flames dispersed all of the white mist.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The ravaging flames from the fire spirit poured into the pit and mercilessly melted the ice frogs and their protective barriers.</p>

  <p>"Hmm. They're not here. Maybe I'll continue digging westward," the fire spirit informed.</p>

  <p>The snow that had been piled up for countess years near the snow line to the east of the Freezing Wilderness had completely disappeared, thanks to the fire spirit. It now revealed a layer of frozen black earth, which was also dug open.</p>

  <p>The members of the Element Spirit race continued to dig deeper.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Claire floated in the air and was overseeing the digging process. "Can't you find them in such a large area?"</p>

  <p>The Holy Wings Armor that was floating beside Claire was actually controlled by Gavyn. He then looked into the black ground and asked, "Is it possible that they entered the Wilderness of No Return?"</p>

  <p>Hearing Gavyn's question, Claire narrowed her eyes and there was a hint of caution on her face.</p>

  <p>It was true that the snow line had been erased before she arrived. Thus, she thought there was a possibility that Gavyn was correct.</p>

  <p>"It makes sense, but were they that stupid to really do it? They couldn't come back if they entered that place. Weren't they afraid of death?" Claire was still suspicious of the suggestion.</p>

  <p>"We don't know that yet. There's a possibility that they can find a special road in the Wilderness of No Return," Gavyn speculated. "I can at least give it a try."</p>

  <p>With that, he gently raised his hand and a door formed by blue lights immediately appeared above the palm of the Holy Wings Armor.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Several fist-sized fire spirits were released from the Holy Wings Armor.</p>

  <p>Upon closer inspection, these fire spirits were still in their childhood.</p>

  <p>Since their intelligence was not high enough, they couldn't decide for themselves yet and they would just follow orders.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing that Gavyn was about to send several young fire spirits into the Wilderness of No Return, Claire lashed at him, "What do you think you're doing? Do you have to sacrifice that large number of fire spirits?"</p>

  <p>"What are you so mad about? It's so easy to produce them. You could give birth to millions of these spirits in the Holy Wings Armor.</p>

  <p>What's there to lose?" Gavyn sneered as he shrugged his shoulders. The Holy Wings Armor immediately made the sound of metal rubbing against each other.</p>

  <p>"You bastard..." Claire's face darkened. She couldn't utter another word upon hearing his reasoning. She began to regret helping Gavyn take control of the Holy Wings Armor.</p>

  <p>It was true that Claire could produce millions of fire spirits. However, in her eyes, no matter how weak the fire spirits were, they were still members of the Element Spirit race. They weren't mere tools.</p>

  <p>But Gavyn's perspective was different. In his mind, these young fire spirits were just a bunch of flames that couldn't think on their own. And he could use them however he wanted to attain his goal.</p>

  <p>At Gavyn's order, the fire spirits crowded against one another. They excitedly gathered and formed a huge flame.</p>

  <p>As the huge flame reached the edge of the snow line, it quickly rushed into the Wilderness of No Return.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Phew! Phew! Phew!</p>

  <p>Gavyn's plan was simple and straightforward. If they found the road that they were looking for, they could return, but if not, they would die.</p>

  <p>With that, the first fire spirit rushed into the Wilderness of No Return without hesitation.</p>

  <p>It kept running forward until it exhausted all of its energy. Eventually, its flame was extinguished.</p>

  <p>One by one, fire spirits continuously jumped out of the huge flame and rushed into the Wilderness of No Return.</p>

  <p>From afar, it could be seen that there was a slanted flame line spreading forward, which looked very shocking.</p>

  <p>"Those humans destroyed the snow line. If they entered from a particular part of the snow line, we will definitely find that road," Gavyn said confidently.</p>

  <p>Claire also knew that this method would work. However, she was against it knowing that several fire spirits would needlessly die.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>More and more fire spirits rushed into the Wilderness of No Return. Gavyn felt that they were getting closer and closer to the road that they were looking for.</p>

  <p>Soon the fire spirits had reached a point that was just ten miles away from the road.</p>

  <p>Then, there were just five miles to go.</p>

  <p>Three miles to go.</p>

  <p>When they were only about a mile from that road, it seemed that there was no fire spirit left to rush into the Wilderness of No Return.</p>

  <p>"Wow, they were all used up. Release some more!" At Gavyn's command, the Holy Wings Armor opened a door formed by blue lights once more.</p>

  <p>This time, a mass of bright blue thunder spirits had come out. These spirits continuously crackled and also began to gather to form a huge source of a thunderbolt.</p>

  <p>There was no stopping Gavyn. The Holy Wings Armor was under his control, so he would use every member of the Element Spirit race if needed, just to fulfill his goal.</p>

  <p>Just when Gavyn was about to give the order to the thunder spirits, a familiar voice suddenly sounded in his and Claire's minds.</p>

  <p>"Claire, Slade, you need to come back," the Eye Spirit said.</p>

  <p>Hearing the message, both of their expressions became serious.</p>

  <p>If the Eye Spirit was summoning them urgently, it only meant that there was a serious situation going on.</p>

  <p>"What happened?" Claire asked straightforwardly.</p>

  <p>"The Nihility race is attacking the Treasure Bottle Platform," the Eye Spirit answered briefly.</p>

  <p>She was greatly shocked at what she heard. "Those bastards, how dare they?!" she yelled in anger.</p>

  <p>On the surface, the Element Spirit Civilization was battling against the Nihility race on the Other Shore. But the truth was, there were two more powerful forces behind them.</p>

  <p>The Treasure Bottle Platform had always been heavily guarded by the Element Spirit Civilization. But in fact, the powerful Treacherous Beings were also there. Since the Nihility race dared to make a move, they must be pretty confident.</p>

  <p>"Come back right now. We need reinforcements," the Eye Spirit ordered.</p>

  <p>Naturally, it was an urgent command that couldn't be disobeyed.</p>

  <p>So, Gavyn raised his hand and ordered the thunder spirits to return to the Holy Wings Armor.</p>

  <p>Claire also informed the other members of the Element Spirit race that were looking for Zheng and his companions in the Freezing Wilderness. After all of the members had gathered and returned to the Holy Wings Armor, an authoritative voice sounded. "Hand over the control of the Holy Wings Armor, Gavyn."</p>

  <p>The search for Zheng and the others was just a special case. Since all the elders of the Element Spirit race had left, Gavyn was tasked to control the Holy Wings Armor.</p>

  <p>But now that all the members of the Element Spirit race had returned and merged into Slade again, they had to ask Gavyn to hand over the control of the Holy Wings Armor.</p>

  <p>"It's not necessary right now. Didn't you hear that the matter was urgent?"</p>

  <p>Gavyn replied.</p>

  <p>He was actually yearning to control the Holy Wings Armor for a long time now, so he wouldn't just give it back so easily.</p>

  <p>The collective consciousness inside Slade answered, "Yes, the matter's urgent. That's why you need to obey the order. Claire, do you think— "</p>

  <p>Gavyn let out a cold snort, and Slade's voice suddenly stopped.</p>

  <p>The internal world of the Holy Wings Armor was now controlled by Gavyn, so it was just easy for him to block their voices.</p>

  <p>"I said it was not the time for that. Let's go!"</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Gavyn spread out the wings of the Holy Wings Armor and quickly flew forward.</p>

  <p>Claire soared in the sky and looked at the back of the Holy Wings Armor.</p>

  <p>She kind of knew what Gavyn was thinking. Her eyes narrowed as she flew closely behind.</p>
