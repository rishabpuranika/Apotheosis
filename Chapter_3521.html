<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3521 Dismemberment </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>All the Other Shore creatures that lurked, peeped, and eavesdropped in the buildings on both sides of the road couldn't believe their ears.</p>

  <p>"What did that young human say? Did I hear it wrong?"</p>

  <p>"He was threatening Master Ghost Scorpion!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, my God! He must be crazy!"</p>

  <p>The Ghost Scorpion might not be the strongest Other Shore creature in the Myriad Spirits City, but he was definitely a local powerhouse. He controlled almost the entire underground world in the north of the Myriad Spirits City by himself, and even the City Guard House couldn't do anything to him.</p>

  <p>Whoever dared to provoke him would have a miserable ending. Usually, they seldom had the chance to see the sunrise on the next day.</p>

  <p>Yet, there was Zheng, who unhesitatingly instigated such a being. The creatures on the Other Shore all thought something was wrong with him.</p>

  <p>The Souls of Light of the Bearing race, the Sun Crow race, and other races, who stayed on the terrace of the oval-shaped building three thousand feet away, were also shocked and confused at Zheng's words.</p>

  <p>"That guy's reaction is a little unexpected..."</p>

  <p>"Humph! He is only trying to pretend and bluff when he is dying!"</p>

  <p>"Anyway, he knows he is going to die. Maybe he felt it was good to pretend to be a hero before he dies."</p>

  <p>In their opinion, it was still impossible for Zheng to fight against the Ghost Scorpion even if he had a corporeal body. After all, it had cost them a lot of resources to hire the Ghost Scorpion.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Ghost Scorpion went stiff for about a dozen seconds, before he finally let out a muffled wild laugh.</p>

  <p>"Hahaha!"</p>

  <p>As the Ghost Scorpion's laughs rang out, the female members of the Fragrant Butterfly race behind him burst into giggles as well.</p>

  <p>"Humans are so interesting. I..."</p>

  <p>Before the Ghost Scorpion could finish his words, Zheng took a step forward.</p>

  <p>That one step he took towards the Ghost Scorpion was over a hundred feet.</p>

  <p>He was able to do so because he used his heels to generate power and forcefully suppress the ground, thereby leaving a crater behind. At the same time, he stretched his hand towards the Ghost Scorpion and gently passed by his body. Then, he stood behind his opponent, at the side of the female members of the Fragrant Butterfly race.</p>

  <p>At that moment, his hand was holding the Ghost Scorpion's right arm.</p>

  <p>"He didn't tell the truth, so I have no choice but to let him die in pain. Take it," he said flatly.</p>

  <p>The female members of the Fragrant Butterfly race who had been cackling with the Ghost Scorpion at Zheng's words, had never thought that things would change in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>The wide grins on their faces froze as they stared at the arm Zheng was holding in disbelief. One of them glanced at the Ghost Scorpion, only to find that his right arm was indeed detached from his shoulder.</p>

  <p>When Zheng saw that none of the female members of the Fragrant Butterfly race wanted to take the arm, he shook his head and casually threw the disconnected limb on the ground. Then, he turned around and stomped his foot once again.</p>

  <p>"Dong!"</p>

  <p>A muffled sound came from the soft ground once again. The high pressure caused the soil to spread out everywhere like waves, and created a bottomless hole in the ground. At the same time, Zheng once again passed by the Ghost Scorpion.</p>

  <p>This time, however, the Ghost Scorpion had time to react.</p>

  <p>He wasn't slow to react by any means, it was just that Zheng's current speed was far beyond his limit.</p>

  <p>The moment Zheng attacked him for the second time, the Ghost Scorpion chose to fight back.</p>

  <p>He stretched out his remaining arm towards Zheng and simultaneously swept his tail.</p>

  <p>"Crack..."</p>

  <p>Yet, Zheng had gotten away from him in a flash.</p>

  <p>Moreover, he also took the Ghost Scorpion's left arm with him!</p>

  <p>In just two confrontations, Zheng had already removed both of the Ghost Scorpion's arms, but the latter didn't look bothered at all. Instead, his lips stretched into a grim smile. "Human, your speed is indeed beyond my expectations, but it's a pity for you..."</p>

  <p>He wagged his tail as he spoke, and the hook on it glowed faintly.</p>

  <p>He was quite proud of his tail, which could move extremely fast.</p>

  <p>Without any warning, the tail's hook swept past Zheng's waist.</p>

  <p>Now, the Ghost Scorpion was sure that he could kill Zheng with his tail.</p>

  <p>To his surprise, however, he heard Zheng say indifferently, "Have you heard of the Chaotic Source Spirit?" "The Chaotic Source Spirit?" Ghost Scorpion said dumbly.</p>

  <p>As a master in Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore, he did not know much about the higher stages of the Desire World. He had heard that the Chaotic Source Spirit was connected with the Source World before, but he didn't think that was important. Thus, he had no idea why Zheng mentioned it out of the blue.</p>

  <p>"Your attack just now was far from enough to exhaust my Chaotic Source Spirits," Zheng said with a shake of his head. "It is even less than sufficient to harm me, not to mention... I'm not afraid of the poison at all."</p>

  <p>Zheng had experienced all kinds of highly toxic poisons before. Therefore, the poisonous hook on the Ghost Scorpion's tail couldn't harm him.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the Ghost Scorpion's attack did not exhaust the Chaotic Source Spirits, nor did it cut through his skin.</p>

  <p>Such were the big advantages of the Chaotic Source Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>While the Ghost Scorpion still pondered over Zheng's words, Zheng's body flashed across him with two muffled sounds once again.</p>

  <p>At that point, Zheng had detached one of the Ghost Scorpion's legs.</p>

  <p>Naturally, he lost his balance and fell down to the ground.</p>

  <p>"Ahhh!" the female members of the Fragrant Butterfly race behind Ghost Scorpion let out a series of shrieks.</p>

  <p>After a while, they finally came back to their senses, but they didn't seem to have any better means of expression other than screaming.</p>

  <p>Then, two of them flapped their wings and released a gust of colorful poisonous smog. The poisonous smog could be inhaled through mouths and noses. Anyone who had absorbed it would become paralyzed and unable to move.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing the poisonous smog, the Ear Mice immediately went away to dodge it.</p>

  <p>As for Zheng, he simply ignored the existence of such poisonous smog, and he didn't pay any attention to the female members of the Fragrant Butterfly race. He once again passed by the Ghost Scorpion.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>The other leg of the Ghost Scorpion was also taken away by Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>Even his tail, which he was very proud of, was also detached from his body.</p>

  <p>Now with only a head and a torso, he lay on the ground, unable to move.</p>

  <p>Lying on the ground, he felt like he was dreaming.</p>

  <p>Just now, he had been thinking about how to deal with this arrogant and unruly human. But less than half a minute later, he had almost been dismembered by Zheng. He could not help but doubt the facticity of all this.</p>

  <p>"I'll give you one more chance to tell me whose orders you're under," Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>He thought he had guessed it correctly, but still he wanted to confirm his guess.</p>

  <p>Without even launching any powerful attack, the Ghost Scorpion had lost his arms, legs, and even his tail. It was not until then that he was finally filled with fear.</p>

  <p>He had accepted the commission without thinking too much. Now, it turned out that he had fallen into such a deep pit, which was way beyond what he had predicted.</p>

  <p>He felt a lot of remorse and hatred for the one who had asked him to do all this. "It's the Star Falcon race! The damn Star Falcon race!" Ghost Scorpion shouted loudly.</p>

  <p>Zheng had just arrived at the Myriad Spirits City and didn't know much about the races on the Other Shore in the Desire World, so of course, he didn't know anything about the Star Falcon race.</p>

  <p>An Ear Mouse who was not far away explained to him, "The Star Falcon race is a major race in Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore. They occupy another city, which is called Sky Water City. They have been supporting the Sun Crow race."</p>

  <p>The Ear Mice were well-informed, so they clearly knew about such information.</p>

  <p>"The Sun Crow race?" Zheng pursed his lips.</p>

  <p>"Let me go..."</p>

  <p>Just as the Ghost Scorpion was about to beg for mercy, he saw that Zheng had stretched his hand towards his head. When he realized what was about to happen, his head was already decapitated.</p>
