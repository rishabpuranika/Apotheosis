<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3336 The Disintegrated Sanskrit Word </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The last time Geoffrey deciphered two Sanskrit words of the Truth Enlightenment, he had suffered a lot. So, he understood not all Sanskrit words could be deciphered easily.</p>

  <p>However, when he saw this unique blood-red Sanskrit word floating in the sky, he still could not suppress his curiosity.</p>

  <p>As he was trying to interpret it, the Sanskrit word suddenly began to tremble, and the blood red energy suddenly dispersed into the air like a vapor.</p>

  <p>Zheng and the Regal Jade Spirit were deep in discussion, so they didn't expect the Sanskrit word to act up like this.</p>

  <p>"Eh?" The Regal Jade Spirit grunted confusedly. "Someone is interpreting this Sanskrit word. Is there a decipherer in your inner world?"</p>

  <p>There were some creatures in the Regal Jade Civilization responsible for interpreting Sanskrit words, called "decipherers".</p>

  <p>In Zheng's inner world, the sole person who could decipher Sanskrit words was Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>Zheng scanned his inner world from the skies. Suddenly, his eyes locked onto Geoffrey, who was looking up at the sky with a confused look.</p>

  <p>"It's my son," Zheng answered.</p>

  <p>"How can he decipher a Sanskrit word at such a level?" the Regal Jade Spirit asked in surprise.</p>

  <p>Zheng already knew how difficult it was to decipher Sanskrit words, but he also knew his son had a knack for it. Even Eastern Emperor Taiyi found it difficult to decipher the Truth Enlightenment of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, but Geoffrey had been able to do it.</p>

  <p>"Has he... deciphered it?" Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Minutes earlier, the Regal Jade Spirit had said that it was impossible to decipher the blood red Sanskrit word. It had been telling Zheng that the only thing he needed to do was to fuse with the energy of the Blood Essence Godly Way, nothing more. However, much to Zheng's surprise, it seemed that Geoffrey could decipher it.</p>

  <p>Zheng waved his hand, summoning a space door.</p>

  <p>He reached into the space door and gently pulled Geoffrey out.</p>

  <p>"Father..." Geoffrey cried in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Did you just decipher that Sanskrit word?" Zheng pointed at the blood red energy floating in the sky.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey nodded sheepishly. "I was just curious." His eyes lit up excitedly.</p>

  <p>"It seems to be intelligent, Father! It dispersed while I was deciphering it!"</p>

  <p>"Then, can you decipher the Sanskrit word?" The voice of the Regal Jade Spirit echoed in the air.</p>

  <p>"What was that sound?" Geoffrey's head whipped around in confusion.</p>

  <p>"This is Master Regal Jade," Zheng answered.</p>

  <p>In Geoffrey's eyes, his father was invincible. However, upon hearing the authoritative voice of the Regal Jade Spirit, he sensed it was even more powerful than Zheng. Blinking excitedly, he replied, "I am confident I can interpret this Sanskrit word, but it disintegrated too quickly. I didn't have enough time."</p>

  <p>"Are you truly sure?" the Regal Jade Spirit questioned dubiously.</p>

  <p>In the past, the Wing King had gone through great lengths to find this Sanskrit word that contained the Blood Essence Power. This blood-red Sanskrit word was quite special.</p>

  <p>Whenever someone tried to decipher it, the Blood Essence Power would dissipate. After some period of time, it would recover, forming the Sanskrit word once more.</p>

  <p>At the time, the Wing King believed that there were special meanings in the Sanskrit word. He couldn't interpret it by himself, so he enlisted the help of the best decipherers of the Regal Jade Civilization. These decipherers were the most outstanding; each of them had their own talent, but none of them succeeded in deciphering the blood-red Sanskrit word.</p>

  <p>After trying countless times, the Wing King finally gave up and resigned himself to believing that the Sanskrit word was meaningless. Since then, only a few people still insisted on deciphering it, but no one succeeded.</p>

  <p>This was why, when the Regal Jade Spirit took out the Blood Essence Power, it told Zheng not to pay attention to the Sanskrit word but to focus on the power it contained, as the power was the most important.</p>

  <p>Now that Geoffrey claimed he could decipher it, naturally the Regal Jade Spirit was doubtful.</p>

  <p>"Geoffrey, are you really sure? You have to tell me the truth," Zheng said firmly.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey was a little bit rebellious, but he couldn't do much since Zheng had imprisoned him in his inner world.</p>

  <p>Seeing his own father doubting his abilities, he felt a bit indignant. "There isn't much information recorded in the Sanskrit Word. As long as it doesn't disintegrate, I can decipher it," he said, puffing out his chest.</p>

  <p>Zheng exhaled slowly through his nose. He still thought Geoffrey was bragging. After all, the Regal Jade Spirit had lived as a Chaos Ancient God.</p>

  <p>If it claimed that the Sanskrit word was indecipherable, then shouldn't it be?</p>

  <p>Just as he was about to scold his son, the Regal Jade Spirit suddenly cut in.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean there isn't much information recorded in the Sanskrit word?"</p>

  <p>Startled by the Regal Jade Spirit's sudden sense of urgency, Geoffrey hesitated slightly. "Although the structure of the Sanskrit word is complicated, there isn't much information contained in it," Geoffrey answered firmly.</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade Spirit didn't say anything for a moment. It was obvious that Geoffrey had aroused its interest, because the Wing King had said the exact same thing before.</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade Spirit had once been the Wing King's right hand. After being unable to decipher the Sanskrit word, the Wing King's expression fell.</p>

  <p>Under his breath, he had mumbled, "There isn't too much information hidden in this Sanskrit word, but I just can't interpret it...!"</p>

  <p>After years of research, the Wing King had come to this conclusion. Zheng's son only glanced at the blood-red Sanskrit word for a while, and he arrived at the same conclusion almost instantly. Even the Regal Jade Spirit, who was wise and experienced, was surprised.</p>

  <p>"In that case," the Regal Jade Spirit said carefully, "please try to decipher the Sanskrit word."</p>

  <p>Zheng was surprised when he noticed the change in the tone of the Regal Jade Spirit. It seemed to believe what Geoffrey was saying.</p>

  <p>"The Sanskrit word disintegrates so quickly that I don't have time to decipher it," Geoffrey said helplessly.</p>

  <p>"If you copy it, it will not break apart," the Regal Jade Spirit responded.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Geoffrey's eyes flashed slyly. "What will I gain from deciphering this Sanskrit word?"</p>

  <p>It was one of his habits from childhood. Before doing anything, he'd always try to find out what he'd get out of it first.</p>

  <p>But, he never asked for anything extravagant.</p>

  <p>In the Source World, one could earn a lot of money for deciphering some Sanskrit words. If the Sanskrit word was a little more complicated, the price for the deciphering work would be extremely high.</p>

  <p>Taking the two Sanskrit words of the Truth Enlightenment as an example, after they were deciphered, the value of their translated version was immeasurable.</p>

  <p>However, whenever Zheng asked Geoffrey for help, he was never rewarded.</p>

  <p>"What will you gain?" The Regal Jade Spirit hesitated for a moment, as it thought about it carefully. "If you are able to disciple it, I will accept you as my disciple."</p>

  <p>There was a great civilization that supported the Regal Jade Spirit, known as the Regal Jade Civilization. This civilization was considered one of the strongest and most prosperous among countless civilizations on the Other Shore. As a result, a lot of special theurgies and methods were born here.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the Regal Jade Spirit itself was once a Son of Truth? otherwise known as, a Chaos Ancient God.</p>

  <p>This was a splendid opportunity. Zheng was secretly proud of his son at merely being offered such a trade.</p>

  <p>However, to his surprise, Geoffrey's face was full of disdain. "Father, is the Regal Jade Spirit powerful? How powerful is it, exactly? Is it as powerful as Master Estelle?"</p>

  <p>Estelle had stayed in the fairy palace for a long time. Geoffrey, having only been exposed to things within Zheng's inner world, had thought that Estelle was the most powerful being.</p>

  <p>"Um..." Zheng gave him a funny expression.</p>

  <p>Although Estelle was indeed a powerful warrior in the divine land, she was nowhere near as powerful as the Regal Jade Spirit.</p>

  <p>Zheng patiently explained the strength of the Chaos Ancient God to his son.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey's expression changed from disdain to one of delight, while he was listening to Zheng with keen interest.</p>

  <p>After he finally understood the power of a Chaos Ancient God, he spoke to the Regal Jade Spirit. "Then, it's settled! I'll decipher the Sanskrit word for you!"</p>
