  <p>
</p>

  <p>The last time Luo Nian deciphered two Sanskrit words of the Truth Enlightenment, he had suffered a lot. So, he understood not all Sanskrit words could be deciphered easily.</p>

  <p>However, when he saw this unique blood-red Sanskrit word floating in the sky, he still could not suppress his curiosity.</p>

  <p>As he was trying to interpret it, the Sanskrit word suddenly began to tremble, and the blood red energy suddenly dispersed into the air like a vapor.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and the Green Jade Spirit were deep in discussion, so they didn't expect the Sanskrit word to act up like this.</p>

  <p>"Eh?" The Green Jade Spirit grunted confusedly. "Someone is interpreting this Sanskrit word. Is there a decipherer in your inner world?"</p>

  <p>There were some creatures in the Green Jade Civilization responsible for interpreting Sanskrit words, called "decipherers".</p>

  <p>In Luo Zheng's inner world, the sole person who could decipher Sanskrit words was Luo Nian.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng scanned his inner world from the skies. Suddenly, his eyes locked onto Luo Nian, who was looking up at the sky with a confused look.</p>

  <p>"It's my son," Luo Zheng answered.</p>

  <p>"How can he decipher a Sanskrit word at such a level?" the Green Jade Spirit asked in surprise.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng already knew how difficult it was to decipher Sanskrit words, but he also knew his son had a knack for it. Even Eastern Emperor Taiyi found it difficult to decipher the Truth Enlightenment of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, but Luo Nian had been able to do it.</p>

  <p>"Has he... deciphered it?" Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Minutes earlier, the Green Jade Spirit had said that it was impossible to decipher the blood red Sanskrit word. It had been telling Luo Zheng that the only thing he needed to do was to fuse with the energy of the Blood Essence Divine Dao, nothing more. However, much to Luo Zheng's surprise, it seemed that Luo Nian could decipher it.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng waved his hand, summoning a space door.</p>

  <p>He reached into the space door and gently pulled Luo Nian out.</p>

  <p>"Father..." Luo Nian cried in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Did you just decipher that Sanskrit word?" Luo Zheng pointed at the blood red energy floating in the sky.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian nodded sheepishly. "I was just curious." His eyes lit up excitedly.</p>

  <p>"It seems to be intelligent, Father! It dispersed while I was deciphering it!"</p>

  <p>"Then, can you decipher the Sanskrit word?" The voice of the Green Jade Spirit echoed in the air.</p>

  <p>"What was that sound?" Luo Nian's head whipped around in confusion.</p>

  <p>"This is Master Green Jade," Luo Zheng answered.</p>

  <p>In Luo Nian's eyes, his father was invincible. However, upon hearing the authoritative voice of the Green Jade Spirit, he sensed it was even more powerful than Luo Zheng. Blinking excitedly, he replied, "I am confident I can interpret this Sanskrit word, but it disintegrated too quickly. I didn't have enough time."</p>

  <p>"Are you truly sure?" the Green Jade Spirit questioned dubiously.</p>

  <p>In the past, the Wing King had gone through great lengths to find this Sanskrit word that contained the Blood Essence Power. This blood-red Sanskrit word was quite special.</p>

  <p>Whenever someone tried to decipher it, the Blood Essence Power would dissipate. After some period of time, it would recover, forming the Sanskrit word once more.</p>

  <p>At the time, the Wing King believed that there were special meanings in the Sanskrit word. He couldn't interpret it by himself, so he enlisted the help of the best decipherers of the Green Jade Civilization. These decipherers were the most outstanding; each of them had their own talent, but none of them succeeded in deciphering the blood-red Sanskrit word.</p>

  <p>After trying countless times, the Wing King finally gave up and resigned himself to believing that the Sanskrit word was meaningless. Since then, only a few people still insisted on deciphering it, but no one succeeded.</p>

  <p>This was why, when the Green Jade Spirit took out the Blood Essence Power, it told Luo Zheng not to pay attention to the Sanskrit word but to focus on the power it contained, as the power was the most important.</p>

  <p>Now that Luo Nian claimed he could decipher it, naturally the Green Jade Spirit was doubtful.</p>

  <p>"Luo Nian, are you really sure? You have to tell me the truth," Luo Zheng said firmly.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian was a little bit rebellious, but he couldn't do much since Luo Zheng had imprisoned him in his inner world.</p>

  <p>Seeing his own father doubting his abilities, he felt a bit indignant. "There isn't much information recorded in the Sanskrit Word. As long as it doesn't disintegrate, I can decipher it," he said, puffing out his chest.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng exhaled slowly through his nose. He still thought Luo Nian was bragging. After all, the Green Jade Spirit had lived as a Chaos Ancient God.</p>

  <p>If it claimed that the Sanskrit word was indecipherable, then shouldn't it be?</p>

  <p>Just as he was about to scold his son, the Green Jade Spirit suddenly cut in.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean there isn't much information recorded in the Sanskrit word?"</p>

  <p>Startled by the Green Jade Spirit's sudden sense of urgency, Luo Nian hesitated slightly. "Although the structure of the Sanskrit word is complicated, there isn't much information contained in it," Luo Nian answered firmly.</p>

  <p>The Green Jade Spirit didn't say anything for a moment. It was obvious that Luo Nian had aroused its interest, because the Wing King had said the exact same thing before.</p>

  <p>The Green Jade Spirit had once been the Wing King's right hand. After being unable to decipher the Sanskrit word, the Wing King's expression fell.</p>

  <p>Under his breath, he had mumbled, "There isn't too much information hidden in this Sanskrit word, but I just can't interpret it...!"</p>

  <p>After years of research, the Wing King had come to this conclusion. Luo Zheng's son only glanced at the blood-red Sanskrit word for a while, and he arrived at the same conclusion almost instantly. Even the Green Jade Spirit, who was wise and experienced, was surprised.</p>

  <p>"In that case," the Green Jade Spirit said carefully, "please try to decipher the Sanskrit word."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was surprised when he noticed the change in the tone of the Green Jade Spirit. It seemed to believe what Luo Nian was saying.</p>

  <p>"The Sanskrit word disintegrates so quickly that I don't have time to decipher it," Luo Nian said helplessly.</p>

  <p>"If you copy it, it will not break apart," the Green Jade Spirit responded.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Luo Nian's eyes flashed slyly. "What will I gain from deciphering this Sanskrit word?"</p>

  <p>It was one of his habits from childhood. Before doing anything, he'd always try to find out what he'd get out of it first.</p>

  <p>But, he never asked for anything extravagant.</p>

  <p>In the Source World, one could earn a lot of money for deciphering some Sanskrit words. If the Sanskrit word was a little more complicated, the price for the deciphering work would be extremely high.</p>

  <p>Taking the two Sanskrit words of the Truth Enlightenment as an example, after they were deciphered, the value of their translated version was immeasurable.</p>

  <p>However, whenever Luo Zheng asked Luo Nian for help, he was never rewarded.</p>

  <p>"What will you gain?" The Green Jade Spirit hesitated for a moment, as it thought about it carefully. "If you are able to disciple it, I will accept you as my disciple."</p>

  <p>There was a great civilization that supported the Green Jade Spirit, known as the Green Jade Civilization. This civilization was considered one of the strongest and most prosperous among countless civilizations on the Other Shore. As a result, a lot of special theurgies and methods were born here.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the Green Jade Spirit itself was once a Son of Truth? otherwise known as, a Chaos Ancient God.</p>

  <p>This was a splendid opportunity. Luo Zheng was secretly proud of his son at merely being offered such a trade.</p>

  <p>However, to his surprise, Luo Nian's face was full of disdain. "Father, is the Green Jade Spirit powerful? How powerful is it, exactly? Is it as powerful as Master Estelle?"</p>

  <p>Estelle had stayed in the Immortal Mansion for a long time. Luo Nian, having only been exposed to things within Luo Zheng's inner world, had thought that Estelle was the most powerful being.</p>

  <p>"Um..." Luo Zheng gave him a funny expression.</p>

  <p>Although Estelle was indeed a powerful warrior in the divine land, she was nowhere near as powerful as the Green Jade Spirit.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng patiently explained the strength of the Chaos Ancient God to his son.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian's expression changed from disdain to one of delight, while he was listening to Luo Zheng with keen interest.</p>

  <p>After he finally understood the power of a Chaos Ancient God, he spoke to the Green Jade Spirit. "Then, it's settled! I'll decipher the Sanskrit word for you!"</p>
