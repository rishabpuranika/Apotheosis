<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>While the group of people from the chaos had smoothly adapted to the environment of the Abstruse Energy World, the situation for the creatures from the fourth-grade world was completely different.</p>

  <p>Kincaid stared at everything around him as tears started to swell in his eyes. The glorious scenes of the Four Spirits Sect in the past kept reappearing in his mind's eyes.</p>

  <p>As he let out a deep sigh, his body began to solidify. It gradually crumbled and eventually turned into dust.</p>

  <p>Just like what Zheng said, after the chaos was downgraded, there was no way for the Other Shore to escape its fate.</p>

  <p>Although the human spirits of the Bold Conjecture House had controlled the passageway in order to hide at the highest point, it was only good to delay the inevitable for a few more moments.</p>

  <p>In the end, Itzel was able to grip the hands of the Human Spirit King tightly before he turned into a handful of dust.</p>

  <p>A surge of emotion became very visible in her eyes. She gently raised her trembling hand and spread out her palm, allowing the ashes to float and be carried by the wind.</p>

  <p>According to the rules, after Itzel and Hilario returned to the Abstruse Energy World, they would also be killed off by the power that was left behind by the downgrader.</p>

  <p>While they couldn't resist this power, it was just a piece of cake for Zheng in his current state.</p>

  <p>Thus, when the destructive force rushed towards Itzel and Hilario, Zheng released a light film that appeared above the fairy palace and easily resisted it. Then, Hilario asked with a bitter smile, "Zheng, can we go to the four holy pillars? I really want to be there for the last time."</p>

  <p>The four holy pillars had been the base of operations of the Four Spirits Sect. For countless times, Hilario had dreamed of returning to this place that he had considered as his home. Thus, before everything ended, he requested to see it one more time.</p>

  <p>Zheng understood how everyone in the fairy palace felt and also wanted to help them realize whatever dreams they had left. Thus, he immediately agreed and said, "Of course."</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>In an instant, the fairy palace sped up and flew towards the direction of the four pillars.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the black ship also rushed out of the chaos from the other side.</p>

  <p>Initially, the Evil God didn't know about the Soul Reincarnation, thus he was a little confused the first time he entered the main world and was enveloped by the stars all over the sky. However, he was still able to react quickly as he controlled all of the energies. In an instant, he learned the Soul Reincarnation and immediately exerted it on himself, Edna, Shera, the Grandmaster of Heaven, and the former captain of the ship.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Duran's coordinates were left behind on the Other Shore. Although he had hidden them very well, it was still no use since the entire Other Shore was already downgraded. With that, he wasn't able to escape his doom.</p>

  <p>By the time that the Grandmaster of Heaven and the others realized what was happening, Duran had already been reduced to ashes.</p>

  <p>"Darling, where are we going now?" Edna asked in a soft voice.</p>

  <p>"I don't know yet," the Evil God answered in an emotionless tone. He was so upset at what was happening. It seemed that nothing turned out according to his plan.</p>

  <p>After the entire chaos was downgraded, the Wall World continued to spread at an incredible speed. The forests, mountains, rivers, and even the secondary worlds were all devoured and squeezed into the Wall World.</p>

  <p>Everything was turned into a picture of a complete disarray.</p>

  <p>Although the fourth-grade world was relatively vast, it was still finite.</p>

  <p>There was no use hiding and running aimlessly. This made the Evil God so frustrated. The situation was very pressing, and he still couldn't think of any solution.</p>

  <p>Right now, there was no point in fighting Zheng, but he also didn't possess the power to kill the downgrader. As time passed, the expansion of the Wall World was just growing rapidly, and it was not reversible.</p>

  <p>Everything seemed to point out that this was already a dead end.</p>

  <p>"No! There must be a way...</p>

  <p>I just need to think and find it!"</p>

  <p>As someone who had a lot of pride, the Evil God refused to give up. He had already sacrificed and suffered a lot, so there was no way that he would just surrender without doing anything.</p>

  <p>While the Evil God paced back and forth on the deck of the black ship, his hand suddenly felt a cold sensation. As the Evil God turned, he saw that it was Edna who held her by the hand, standing and smiling before him.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry too much. I've never seen you like this before, not even when you faced the Creator."</p>

  <p>"That's because Zheng still has a flaw! He's a softhearted idiot and I know that I could always seize the opportunity to bring him down. But, what's happening right now is different. I can't find any solution to our situation!" the Evil God said with a frown. He was like a trapped beast in a cage, looking restless and depressed. Shera, the former captain and the Grandmaster of Heaven beside didn't even dare to speak.</p>

  <p>Edna remained calm as she said, "Not every problem could be solved.</p>

  <p>Maybe it's time to accept that the downgrade is really unavoidable."</p>

  <p>While Edna spoke, the Evil God's brain was still racing rapidly. He was calculating and strategizing all kinds of plans. However, when he heard the last part of what she said, his eyes suddenly widened, and his entire body froze.</p>

  <p>"It's unavoidable?" The Evil God lowered his head, gritted his teeth, and clenched his fists.</p>

  <p>"We can just accept the situation," Edna said with a faint smile. She just didn't want to see the Evil God distressed. In her mind, if they only had a few hours left to exist, she hoped that they could just spend their remaining time happily.</p>

  <p>"But I can't!" The Evil God turned and stared at her with an indignant look in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing the Evil God like this, Edna couldn't help but bite her lips.</p>

  <p>She didn't utter another word and just let out a sigh.</p>

  <p>In her mind, they were already in a situation that wouldn't matter whether they accepted their death or not.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Wall World was still expanding rapidly throughout the main world. Due to its astonishing speed, the creatures living in the main world could only see an azure arc. Before they could make any scream or realize what was going to hit them, they were already pressed into the Wall World, becoming a mass of flesh and blood that seemed like a bloody piece of abstract art.</p>

  <p>All of the villages, tribes, and even cities that were born just recently could not escape the fate of being devoured. In just two hours, the Wall World had already downgraded one-tenth of the main world.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the four pillars were still standing on the ground. The four time chains connected each of them, and at the center was the Eternal Divine Courtyard.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The huge fairy palace slowly went past the four pillars and approached the Eternal Divine Courtyard.</p>

  <p>Then, Hilario quickly jumped out of the fairy palace and stood in the middle of the courtyard with extreme excitement.</p>

  <p>"What a pity! I'm the only one who was able to come back. All of my comrades would have no chance to see it again?" As he remembered that all of the members of the Bold Conjecture House had already been annihilated within the Wall World, he felt very bitter.</p>

  <p>"I think they'll be glad knowing that at least you were able to return," Zheng said as he stood beside him.</p>

  <p>"Maybe you're right. It's just a shame that I wouldn't be able to stay here for long."</p>

  <p>Zheng then turned his head and looked into the distance. He saw a thin blue line, which was like a forest fire that was steadily spreading.</p>

  <p>"We can still stay for another hour," Zheng said as he estimated the speed of the downgrade.</p>

  <p>"I see. I'll be a little selfish and grab it then," Hilario replied with a bitter smile.</p>

  <p>After an hour, the Wall World had already downgraded about nine-tenths of the entire area of the main world.</p>

  <p>Then, the fairy palace began to rise vertically. Zheng's ultimate goal right now was to retreat into the Deep Space.</p>

  <p>Previously, Geoffrey had been through the transmission array at the top of the Eternal Divine Courtyard to get to the Deep Space. However, there was no need for Zheng to do this right now. With his current ability, he could just directly fly up while taking the entire fairy palace.</p>

  <p>After entering the Deep Space, Zheng had once again released the Soul Reincarnation to the people within the fairy palace, so that they could adapt to the environment of the fifth-grade world.</p>

  <p>Then, Geoffrey guided them towards the southwest of the Sky Wheel City. Finally, the fairy palace stopped in front of a huge piece of land.</p>

  <p>The arrival of the fairy palace immediately attracted the attention of the members of the Elemental race below. They bellowed and led a white-haired old human spirit outside to greet them. It was none other than Elder Xue.</p>

  <p>Seeing the sudden appearance of the fairy palace, he already had the hunch of who had arrived.</p>

  <p>Soon, several figures rushed out of the fairy palace. Elder Xue recognized some of them, one of whom was Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>Immediately after, he saw another familiar figure.</p>

  <p>"M-master Hilario!"</p>

  <p>Elder Xue exclaimed with a trembling voice.</p>

  <p>Hilario then strode forward and supported Elder Xue with his hands. "I'm so ashamed!" These were his first words as he saw Elder Xue.</p>

  <p>Back then, Hilario had strongly objected to the idea of going to the Deep Space because of the heated debate over the route. However, Elder Xue still stubbornly did what he wanted and proved that his choice was the right one.</p>
