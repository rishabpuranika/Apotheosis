<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Yolande blinked innocently. She didn't want to lie. "Yes, I know," she answered truthfully.</p>

  <p>"What? Yolande, you know about the Dark Nether Cave?"</p>

  <p>"What exactly is in the core region of the Dark Nether Cave?"</p>

  <p>"How did the Dark Nether Cave form?"</p>

  <p>The numerous top-level war lords couldn't hold themselves back and subjected Yolande with a flood of questions.</p>

  <p>Yolande turned her head away stubbornly. "I won't tell you."</p>

  <p>Her disobedience rendered the top-level war lords speechless. How capricious this girl was!</p>

  <p>Yolande had already been on the tenth floor when these top-level war lords were still generals, and there she remained. No one knew where she came from. She had just always been there.</p>

  <p>These top-level war lords dared not do anything to her.</p>

  <p>"Xun, what on earth is going on?" Luo Luo Zheng asked. "Why don't you let Yolande follow me?"</p>

  <p>Xun blinked. "I don't know how the Dark Nether Cave came into being, but it should have been a battlefield left behind by the world lords who fought here," she said through her life vitality.</p>

  <p>"What did you say? World lords? Who are they?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng asked, obviously shocked by this new piece of information.</p>

  <p>"World lords are supreme warriors of different worlds. Numerous masters died here and, if I'm not mistaken, the Cursed Land was a domain once created by the Cursed World lord who moved about the universe freely,"</p>

  <p>Xun said.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon, having been a silent spectator all this time, finally spoke,</p>

  <p>"Right. The Cursed Land is very likely to be the cursed domain."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng frowned. "Why didn't you say that earlier?"</p>

  <p>It seemed like both the cyan dragon and Xun clearly knew about this.</p>

  <p>"You didn't ask," the two answered in unison.</p>

  <p>Their answer rendered Luo Luo Zheng speechless.</p>

  <p>"The lord of the Cursed World was an extremely famous figure in the Upper World. His Great Curse Technique could separate hundreds of great worlds apart and imprint curses onto them," the cyan dragon narrated in his usual emotionless voice.</p>

  <p>"But why is the cursed domain set up by him ineffective against any warrior below the war sage level?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng couldn't help but ask in curiosity.</p>

  <p>"You are too weak and can't possibly be considered a part of the Cursed World. Therefore, the Cursed Land only curses warriors above top-level war lords," Xun replied in a cold tone.</p>

  <p>Xun's analysis was indeed correct. When two armies clashed and built walls, that was to defend themselves from the soldiers on the other side. No one would build walls to defend themselves from ants.</p>

  <p>To world lords, all warriors below the war sage level were mere insects and were not worth the trouble.</p>

  <p>It was because of this reason that the Sea God Continent had been plunged into such a strange situation. The rise and fall of so many races had actually been decided by the Tower of Sin. The strongest beings that fought in the Tower of Sin were top-level war lords.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the powerful warriors of the Soul Sea Realm only played a supporting role.</p>

  <p>"Then what are the secrets of the Tower of Sin and the Dark Nether Cave?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng asked once again.</p>

  <p>"The immortal named Mist coaxed you into taking away the inheritance, but it doesn't necessarily mean he has good intentions," Xun replied.</p>

  <p>"However, there are still great opportunities within the Dark Nether Cave.</p>

  <p>It's a battlefield for world lords, and if you receive the inheritance of just one lord, the benefits will be unimaginable."</p>

  <p>"But why did you refuse Yolande? Why didn't you want her to come with us?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yolande has millions of duplicates. I'm not really sure what her agenda is, but I think she has realized that you're quite the magnet for good fortune.</p>

  <p>Maybe she wants to go with you to get a share of the spoils," Xun replied.</p>

  <p>"She knows about the Dark Nether Cave. I'll be more confident if she goes with me. If I do get some good stuff while in there, I'm willing to give her some," Luo Luo Zheng reasoned. "Why do you strongly oppose this?"</p>

  <p>He didn't see the logic as to why Xun was so adamant with refusing Yolande. From the way Luo Luo Zheng saw it, the greater knowledge they had about the Dark Nether Cave, the greater their chances of surviving.</p>

  <p>Xun glared viciously at Luo Luo Zheng. "I know her. She?"</p>

  <p>"She is the lord of Everlasting World, which belongs to you humans. She used the Soul Split Spell to split her soul into millions of shards and spread them into the cycles of reincarnation in each Lower World. She did this to reach the higher realms," the cyan dragon said directly.</p>

  <p>Xun didn't know who to look at, Luo Luo Zheng or the cyan dragon residing in his mind. In the end, she chose to continue staring at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyebrows raised at this revelation. "She's a world lord of our human race?"</p>

  <p>"Don't think she's powerful just because she is a world lord. I've met her real body once before. She's very cunning. I feel like she's been waiting for this opportunity and she's taking advantage of you!" Xun continued arguing through her life vitality.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled. "Well? In that case, we can use each other."</p>

  <p>"We should always guard against those who might mean us harm," the cyan dragon said. "However, I think we can allow Yolande to follow Luo Luo Zheng. After all, the Dark Nether Cave is too dangerous for him."</p>

  <p>Realizing that she could not convince Luo Luo Zheng, and since the cyan dragon already took his side, Xun could really do nothing about it. It would be inappropriate for her to object now, so she only wore a depressed expression and did not speak anymore.</p>

  <p>Yolande merely stood to the side and waited patiently. Anyone with a discerning eye could clearly see that Luo Luo Zheng and Xun were secretly communicating with each other.</p>

  <p>"What do you think?" she suddenly piped. "Yes or no?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled. "Of course, yes."</p>

  <p>Yolande nodded. "En," she replied and did not say anything more.</p>

  <p>Xun did not trust Yolande, but the latter did not care at all. Perhaps, for someone like her, all that really mattered was to find a suitable person and then go inside the Dark Nether Cave.</p>

  <p>She could care less about what other people suspected.</p>

  <p>Many races spent half a day on preparations.</p>

  <p>The Tower of Sin had numerous rules, one of them was that the races that owned the most seats entered the cave first.</p>

  <p>This rule had been made by the ogres since they had owned the most seats in the past. Now though, the Demon Night held the most seats, so they had the privilege to enter first.</p>

  <p>There was a spiral staircase at the side of the hall with a small door at the top.</p>

  <p>Many of the Demon Night warriors were already climbing up the stairs, while the humans waited behind them for their turn.</p>

  <p>Fabian, Jarrod, and the others all walked at the front, while Luo Luo Zheng and Yolande followed behind. All of them climbed up the staircase and entered the small door.</p>

  <p>As soon as Luo Luo Zheng passed through the door at the top of the tower, he suddenly met with a strange, prickling sensation that ran from his hands down to the middle of his back.</p>

  <p>He then lifted his eyes and saw the vast cave that laid right in front of him.</p>

  <p>Who knew there would be such a huge cavern beneath the Cursed Land?</p>

  <p>'This is a completely independent underground world!' Luo Luo Zheng exclaimed to himself.</p>

  <p>"This cave is probably as big as the area covered by the Cursed Land above it, right?" he guessed.</p>

  <p>Fabian, who had been walking in front of Luo Luo Zheng, nodded. "Yes," he confirmed. "Once, there was someone who went around the outer layer of the Dark Nether Cave. He found that the shape of the cave is identical to that of the Cursed Land on the surface of the earth."</p>

  <p>"Is the tingling sensation caused by the Dark Nether Death Light?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>The cave, though vast, was not pitch black. In fact, it was filled with some kind of ominous, dark red light. Luo Luo Zheng blocked the light with his hand and the tingling sensations immediately disappeared, but the moment he moved his hand away, the tingles returned and had evolved into strong stabbing pains.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Fabian confirmed once again. "Right now, the Dark Nether Death Light is weak and will only bring the feeling of being pierced by numerous needles. However, once it reaches its explosive phase, the pain will be unbearable and no one will be able to resist it."</p>

  <p>Jarrod then interrupted their conversation, "Let's quickly descend. As we fly in the Dark Nether Cave, it will be very easy to attract the attention of fierce demons."</p>

  <p>The Tower of Sin was like a sharp knife, stabbing straight through the ground.</p>

  <p>They had all come out of the top of the tower and were now about to descend into the cave.</p>

  <p>Jarrod had been right. The Dark Nether Cave was not the place for idle chitchat. Once upon a time, just as the ogre top-level war lords led their team to step out of the Tower of Sin, they immediately met an extremely powerful fiend who devoured ten top-level war lords at once.</p>

  <p>That fiend had always guarded this area of the Tower of Sin. It wasn't really the Dark Nether Death Light that should be feared, but the dangers that lurked in the cave.</p>

  <p>Even if they were only at the outer layer, it was still extremely dangerous.</p>
