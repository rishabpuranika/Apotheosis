  <p>
</p>

  <p>After spending a day in the Tie Clan's house, Zheng finally left. Of course, they didn't ask him to stay— they were anxious to explore the passage below the pond themselves.</p>

  <p>When he returned to the Heavenly Han House, Zheng chose to cultivate in seclusion.</p>

  <p>By now, he had already figured out the usage of the mud.</p>

  <p>Although the will of his inner world continued to urge him to devour the mud as soon as he could, he continued to ignore it.</p>

  <p>Apart from the mud, this time, he had also obtained the transparent bead.</p>

  <p>At that time, after Zheng had taken away the bead, the magical mud lost its energy, leaving it as nothing more than ordinary mud.</p>

  <p>So when Alfred caught the first piece of mud, the black thing had actually abandoned a part of its body— the real core should have been this bead.</p>

  <p>Gently, Zheng flipped the space ring and took the bead out with his right hand.</p>

  <p>Too busy escaping from danger, he hadn't been able to observe it carefully. When he did, he found the bead's surface full of cracks.</p>

  <p>While the bead was indeed strong, it couldn't bear the full power of Zheng's sword strike.</p>

  <p>"This is a soul container— there must be the soul of some living being within." In Zheng's mind, Master Evil looked at the bead and analyzed it for him. "Generally speaking, only the best puppet technique could seal one's soul into a bead. It is said that some Holy Beings actually like doing it."</p>

  <p>"To seal one's soul into a bead?" The thought made Zheng's eyes flicker.</p>

  <p>Saul was a puppet in the fairy palace, and his soul had lived for countless years. Zheng had never seen Saul's soul container, nor did he know if Bromley had sealed Saul's soul into a bead too.</p>

  <p>While Zheng examined it, the pupil in it suddenly turned. Rolling gently on his finger, the bead wanted to escape his grasp.</p>

  <p>Though it was unexpected, he managed to react quickly. With a smile on his face, he turned over his palm and grabbed it once again. "There is indeed a soul inside it. It still wants to escape."</p>

  <p>When he grasped the bead again, the pupil disappeared and the bead stopped moving.</p>

  <p>"Haha! The soul in it has been pretending to be dead," Master Evil remarked with an amused smile.</p>

  <p>To find out the secret of the cave, Zheng had to start with the bead. He held the bead tightly until an invisible spiritual sense spread from his mind. It extended slowly along the center of his eyebrows before pouring right into the bead.</p>

  <p>Just as he did so, a clear image was projected into his mind, making his eyes widen.</p>

  <p>"What in the world…"</p>

  <p>The scene was in the likeness of hell— blood-red crows circled in the air, and some slender black figures held curved sickles and walked aimlessly in the underground cave. In the middle of these shadows was a huge pot standing thousands of feet high. With the continuous burning of the red flames, the pot boiled with something bobbing up and down in the center.</p>

  <p>It was a small head.</p>

  <p>The hair on this head seemed to be thousands of feet long, covering the pot and floating within the boiling water.</p>

  <p>Soon after, the hair was slowly drawn like a curtain, revealing a delicate and elegant face— it was the face of a young girl.</p>

  <p>Zheng's soul began trembling when he saw the girl's appearance.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong with you?" asked Master Evil nervously in Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>Zheng's soul was shaking to such an extent. What could he have found?</p>

  <p>"Yan! Is that you?"</p>

  <p>The girl looked nearly identical to Yan.</p>

  <p>"No, this is not her..."</p>

  <p>Although they looked exactly the same, their auras were totally different.</p>

  <p>As Zheng watched, the girl in the pot suddenly opened her eyes.</p>

  <p>When her light purple eyelids shot up, a pair of blood-red pupils appeared, releasing endless demonic power, causing an indescribable strange feeling. The pair of red pupils stared at Zheng as the girl's thin lips curled into a faint smile.</p>

  <p>That smile meant something more.</p>

  <p>Then she moved her lips until they formed a word.</p>

  <p>Zheng's heart skipped a beat as he attentively stared at the young girl's head. He wanted so badly to know what she was going to say.</p>

  <p>But just at that moment, the pupil in the transparent bead in Zheng's hand suddenly began spinning until it flashed a small flame.</p>

  <p>With a dull sound, the originally clear pupil immediately turned muddled until the soul in the soul container exploded.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the picture in Zheng's mind collapsed into countless fragments and disappeared without a trace.</p>

  <p>With that, Zheng sat there, motionless, like the living dead.</p>

  <p>After a long moment of silence, Master Evil asked, "What did you see?</p>

  <p>Why are you so shocked?"</p>

  <p>In Master Evil's eyes, Zheng was well qualified to be Bromley's disciple, so he must have witnessed quite a lot of things. Still, he couldn't imagine what could've made Zheng lose his wits.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, somewhere in the divine land, the young girl's head floated up slowly from the pot.</p>

  <p>Her long, thin hair kept stretching out as her head floated, and like an overturned black waterfall, it slowly pulled out from the pot.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Nearby, a group of black figures crawled forward.</p>

  <p>These objects were the pieces of mud Zheng was trying hard to find. The pieces tangled into each other until they formed a full shape, forming a woman's body. Its color changed as well, forming a layer of snow-white skin.</p>

  <p>In the end, the mud transformed into a perfect headless woman.</p>

  <p>The girl's head slowly floated to the body and fused with it.</p>

  <p>Her thousand-foot long hair was dragged along the ground like woven black silk, and her demonic eyes looked sad as she said in an ethereal voice, "Why not let me finish my words?"</p>

  <p>Zheng was still blankly staring at the wall, grasping the bead tightly in his hand.</p>

  <p>In theory, he didn't actually have to worry about Yan's safety.</p>

  <p>Wynn had once told him that Yan was under Harold's protection. And as the chief disciple of Zheng's father, Harold was also a powerful warrior in the divine land, only a tad lower than the Holy Beings. So Harold would have never allowed Yan to fall into such a situation.</p>

  <p>But how come the girl in the pot looked exactly like Yan?</p>

  <p>The pot's image echoed and lingered in Zheng's mind. While he tried his hardest to deny the thoughts, he couldn't escape the worries in his heart.</p>

  <p>What if it really was Yan?</p>

  <p>"She is absolutely not Yan!"</p>

  <p>A sharp gaze flashed through Zheng's eyes before he quickly dismissed the idea.</p>

  <p>Once the thought manifested, it grew madly, shaking Zheng's entire state of mind. If he let the idea develop, it would have eventually evolved into his inner demon— it definitely wasn't worth it.</p>

  <p>The woman seemed to have been trying to say something at the last minute. But after a slight movement of her lips, the soul in the transparent bead exploded and Zheng lost his chance to understand what went on after that.</p>

  <p>Reading her lips, he could only see that she started by saying "I," but what was she trying to tell him?</p>

  <p>For a long time, Zheng stood frozen until he finally decided to let the matter go and put the transparent bead back into his space ring.</p>

  <p>No matter how hard he thought about it, he couldn't get an answer. If he was strong enough in the future, he could probably explore the strange cave again, but now was surely not the time to pour his energy into it.</p>

  <p>After dealing with the bead, Zheng took the mud out from his space ring.</p>

  <p>A single piece of mud could only be condensed into a single piece of Godly Tile crystal. Though Zheng didn't know how many pieces of mud were needed to condense a complete tile, he had no choice but to use the only method he knew of at the moment.</p>

  <p>When he brought the mud out, his inner world began stirring again.</p>
