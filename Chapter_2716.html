<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng stood up and had taken several steps, a huge figure suddenly appeared not far away.</p>

  <p>The figure was discreetly moving slowly in the darkness, but No. 9527 still had sensitively noticed it.</p>

  <p>It didn't take a while before two small dark-green spots emerged from the darkness. It turned out to be a mouse as tall as a man.</p>

  <p>"What a big mouse!" Zheng cried out in surprise looking at the figure that suddenly appeared.</p>

  <p>As he was currently manipulated by No. 9527, he abruptly stopped and stood still.</p>

  <p>The mouse lightly crawled over drawing close to a top-rank True God.</p>

  <p>Once in a close distance, it held him up and dragged him into the darkness.</p>

  <p>Since all his senses were sealed off, the True God had no idea what was happening with his body.</p>

  <p>Even if the big mouse chewed him up, he would still not know.</p>

  <p>What a pity to die like this!</p>

  <p>Once targeted by the big mouse, Zheng would probably suffer the same fate.</p>

  <p>His corporeal body was still much stronger than the other True Gods' bodies. It was even sturdier than Leland's body that perhaps it would be possible that the big mouse could not chew him, and he might have a chance to survive.</p>

  <p>However, it was still obviously unrealistic to pin hope on this.</p>

  <p>"This mouse is not intelligent. It won't eat you for the time being," No. 9527 comforted Zheng as it sensed the latter's worry.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, it still continued to control Zheng's body with a slow movement.</p>

  <p>"Do you know where this mouse comes from?" Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"It must be arranged by the person who has occupied the Stone Mouse.</p>

  <p>The Hallucinatory Fragrance can only make the illusion, and can't kill people. After these persons' six senses are sealed, they can only be eaten by the big mouse," No. 9527 continued to guess.</p>

  <p>"Most likely..."</p>

  <p>No. 9527's inference might reasonably explain some of the problems.</p>

  <p>According to the changes around the place, it was not an easy thing to guess what had actually happened.</p>

  <p>While moving and taking a few steps, they noticed that in the distance, there were a few dark-green lights emitting in the darkness for the second time.</p>

  <p>"They are coming!" No. 9527 cried.</p>

  <p>Zheng's body once again stiffened. He had no other choice but to stand still.</p>

  <p>For now, his location was very close to the altar.</p>

  <p>From the darkness, another group of three big mice slowly emerged. Two of them did not hesitate to move forward and grabbed the bodies of two top-rank True Gods on the ground.</p>

  <p>The third big mouse had unfortunately walked slowly towards Zheng!</p>

  <p>"This is too bad..."</p>

  <p>A bitter smile appeared on Zheng's face as he asked, "Can you run now, No. 9527?"</p>

  <p>"Even if we try to run away, I'm afraid we can't escape from this big mouse..." No. 9527 answered helplessly.</p>

  <p>It could only barely control Zheng's body, far from being as flexible as Zheng himself. It might be able to do it only if Zheng allowed it to deprive his soul and totally occupy his body.</p>

  <p>With no other options left, Zheng and No. 9527 just stared at the big mouse quietly moving on the ground to where they were located.</p>

  <p>But after walking a distance near his body's location, the big mouse abruptly turned its head and stared at the consummate True God called Jalen.</p>

  <p>It turned around without warning and walked towards Jalen.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Zheng and No. 9527 heaved a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>It was, after all, a creature without intelligence.</p>

  <p>They silently watched as the big mouse dragged Jalen into the darkness.</p>

  <p>After making sure that it was safe to move, Zheng finally quickened his pace.</p>

  <p>Not long after, he quickly stepped on the altar.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 unleashed its spiritual sense and looked around.</p>

  <p>Except for the smoke, it did not sense anything unusual.</p>

  <p>"What should we do now?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Take the Stone Mouse's corpse out," No. 9527 replied and instructed.</p>

  <p>Zheng did not have much information, and he could only rely on the mouse's corpse.</p>

  <p>Every time the Stone Mouse was reincarnated, people used the dead body of its previous life to find the new one. The dead body should be the main key. They would probably find further information from it.</p>

  <p>"But how can I take it now..." Zheng felt perplexed and asked.</p>

  <p>It would not be easy for him to take out the dead mouse from his space ring.</p>

  <p>There was only Zheng's soul mark on his space ring, so No. 9527 was not able to take it out.</p>

  <p>After thinking for a while, No. 9527 raised Zheng's right hand at his forehead and said, "Release your spiritual sense, and open the soul mark on your space ring..."</p>

  <p>"Release my spiritual sense?"</p>

  <p>Zheng's six senses had been sealed off, and now he felt as if he had been locked up in a dark box. Without the help of No. 9527, he could not even tell direction.</p>

  <p>He had no other choice but to give it a try.</p>

  <p>Zheng's soul emitted a burst of golden light.</p>

  <p>Driven by the enormous soul pressure, his spiritual sense became abnormally powerful.</p>

  <p>With his actions, he was actually breaking through the layer of restriction.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>His soul constantly trembled as he forced his spiritual sense to rush out of his mind in order to communicate with his space ring.</p>

  <p>He tried a couple of times but no matter how hard he tried, the space ring did not move at all.</p>

  <p>It appeared that the restriction which was set by using the Hallucinatory Fragrance was exceptionally powerful. The restriction could even work for Zheng and Leland who was a Demi-holy Being. Therefore, it was not something an ordinary True God could achieve.</p>

  <p>"It's useless," Zheng dejectedly resigned with a bitter smile.</p>

  <p>"Try again," No. 9527 replied blandly.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded, and his expression once again became extremely serious.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>As the golden light around Zheng's body became brighter, the invisible soul pressure spurted out of his mind.</p>

  <p>"Emotion Closing Godly Way!"</p>

  <p>He had no other choice but to perform the Emotion Closing Godly Way.</p>

  <p>This time, it was not used for a sword move, but to open his space ring.</p>

  <p>Under his full strength, a wisp of soul pressure broke through the restriction!</p>

  <p>Once the soul pressure had broken down the restriction, he instantly poured his spiritual sense into the space ring and tried to pull the Stone Mouse's corpse out of it!</p>

  <p>Thump!</p>

  <p>The Stone Mouse's corpse was flung on the altar violently.</p>

  <p>Their attention turned and fixated their gaze on the dead mouse.</p>

  <p>This corpse, as before, emitted a faint glow. However, it made no other movement.</p>

  <p>"Looks like... it didn't work," Zheng muttered.</p>

  <p>"Not really. Look!" No. 9527 sent all the scenes it felt to Zheng.</p>

  <p>The Stone Mouse's corpse would not rot at all, because after all, it was a magical creature.</p>

  <p>After the mouse's corpse landed on the altar, its soft hair started to fall off bit by bit. Its body gradually started to rot.</p>

  <p>Then in the blink of an eye, the dead body had turned into a pile of bones.</p>

  <p>The white bones immediately decayed as cracks appeared. Soon after, the bones finally turned into a pile of dust and sank into the altar.</p>

  <p>The altar had then begun to rotate in a slow motion.</p>

  <p>After it rotated for three and a half circles, a faint orange light straight away emerged from its center.</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish...</p>

  <p>At this moment, Zheng suddenly felt that the restriction currently sealing his six senses disappeared.</p>

  <p>He felt dizzy for a moment but he slowly felt that his senses of touch, smell and hearing were all back!</p>

  <p>Just as his control on his body was back, the Stone Mouse on the altar also came back to life. Without any warning, it threw itself at him.</p>

  <p>Squeak! Squeak! Squeak!</p>

  <p>Hatred was evident filling its bean-sized eyes.</p>

  <p>It aimed at Zheng's cinnabar field.</p>

  <p>Zheng had once been bitten by a Stone Mouse when he just entered the divine land.</p>

  <p>At that time, the Stone Mouse had successfully gotten into his body. But it had struggled being eroded to death by Zheng's chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>Even if the memories of its previous life flashed to mind, instead of learning from it, the Stone Mouse seemed to undergo and experience the same fate as soon as it had just been reincarnated.</p>
