</p>

  <p>After that, Yolande extended her slender fingers which were pure white like green onions. Her ten fingers continuously danced through the air, and her life vitality was constantly pulled forth, forming one rune after another.</p>

  <p>"Those are divine textures!" As Luo Luo Zheng looked at the runes forming in her hands, his eyebrows suddenly shot up. He recognized them! These runes were extremely similar to those the cyan dragon had taught him.</p>

  <p>"Divine textures aren't unique only to the Genuine Dragon World. Humans can have extremely high attainments in divine textures as well," the cyan dragon replied plainly.</p>

  <p>"What on earth is she doing?" Luo Luo Zheng asked the cyan dragon.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon had also noticed the runes in Yolande's hands. He said, "If I'm not mistaken, she wants to seal that thing."</p>

  <p>"Seal it?" Luo Zheng's eyes flickered at this. Yolande continued inscribing divine textures using her life vitality and her nimble fingers only. Would the divine textures work?</p>

  <p>"Ho-ho, the origin of the divine textures is even more complex than you can imagine. If you advance into the Upper World in the future, you will naturally be able to explore these things," the cyan dragon replied.</p>

  <p>As the number of runes in Yolande's hands increased, the glowing structure of the runes also became more and more complex.</p>

  <p>Ten, twenty, thirty, fifty?</p>

  <p>When she had command over a hundred runes, she waved her slender hand and the runes fell like rain, quickly flying out behind her.</p>

  <p>"Freeze!"</p>

  <p>Yolande commanded in an authoritative tone then.</p>

  <p>At her words, the mournful wails behind them stopped.</p>

  <p>"She did it?" Luo Zheng's eyes flashed hopefully.</p>

  <p>After the sound disappeared, Esther also drew in a deep, shuddering breath.</p>

  <p>It seemed that Yolande had succeeded!</p>

  <p>"I've only temporarily sealed it, and only for a short period of time. Let's go," Yolande urged them on.</p>

  <p>Her words immediately made everyone's hearts skip a beat. They began to run forward. After running for several dozen miles, they finally stopped. No one dared to risk glancing backward.</p>

  <p>"Ouch!"</p>

  <p>Fabian let out a long groan and heaved a sigh. Only now did he find some relief from the pain brought on by the Spiritual Thorn. Although he was still in pain and unable to think clearly, he still knew what had happened just now. He said miserably, "Luckily, Luo Luo Zheng, you saved my life."</p>

  <p>"Can we look back now?" Esther asked. Not only Esther, but all of the others were still immersed in a gnawing fear.</p>

  <p>Yolande nodded and said, "I think we've finally gotten rid of that thing."</p>

  <p>Only then did they dare to turn their heads.</p>

  <p>As warriors, not one of them was afraid of those powerful monsters. What truly scared them was the unknown things, just like the thing that had been floating behind them. Until now, no one had known what that thing was.</p>

  <p>They turned around, but there was nothing to be seen behind them.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng also turned around and gazed off into the distance. A jade-green light shone in his pupils. After his eyes had been cleansed by the sap from the divine tree, he was now able to clearly see what was hidden over longer distances away.</p>

  <p>But because of the extra-long distance, what he saw was still very vague. In the distance, he saw a pale-white speck of light pulsating, and around that speck of light, several glowing runes floated. These were the runes which had been released by Yolande earlier. The light seemed to be constantly struggling, attempting to escape the seal which bound it.</p>

  <p>"Stop looking. It can feel your gaze," Yolande quickly interceded, stopping Luo Zheng's potentially dangerous action.</p>

  <p>"It can even feel my gaze?" Shocked, Luo Luo Zheng immediately cast his eyes down.</p>

  <p>At the same time, that menacing light quickly disappeared into the darkness.</p>

  <p>"Hmm, it was indeed very perilous just now. Fortunately, that little fellow hasn't reached adulthood yet." Yolande pouted, revealing a rare smile.</p>

  <p>"It was a minor?" Luo Luo Zheng asked in surprise, and then frowned and questioned her further, "What on earth was it?"</p>

  <p>"We are not allowed to mention its name or think about it. If we did, it would know, track us down and probably chase after us again," Yolande said, shaking her head to caution Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Everyone was left speechless. Just what was that evil thing? Why couldn't they even think about it?</p>

  <p>Xun chipped in, "I know what it is!"</p>

  <p>"What is it?" Luo Luo Zheng asked again, curiosity tearing at him.</p>

  <p>"As Yolande said, we dare not mention its name!" Xun replied, also shaking her head.</p>

  <p>Everyone had nearly been driven mad by the encounter. There were too many strange things in this world! But no matter what that thing was, no one wanted to discuss it any further. After experiencing that extreme fear, none of them wanted to experience it for a second time.</p>

  <p>Esther looked around, her eyes revealing a glimmer of light.</p>

  <p>"We're actually here!" she exclaimed in surprise.</p>

  <p>Fabian drew forth a soul healing pill and stuffed it into his mouth. Although Luo Zheng's Spiritual Thorn had not caused too much damage to him, he did not have a soul as strong as Luo Zheng's. He had to take remedial care of his weakened soul. After swallowing the pill, he grunted and asked, "What is this place?"</p>

  <p>Esther waved her hand, and a map appeared in her hand. It was the map of the Dark Nether Cave. She pointed to a mark etched on the map and said, "I marked this place three years ago. Here we should find the relic of a powerful warrior. However, at that time, this area was protected by a dozen of the poisonous ghost martens, making it impossible for anyone to enter."</p>

  <p>It was hard to accurately predict the strength of the powerhouses in the Dark Nether Cave, and they had left unimaginable treasures in the places where they died.</p>

  <p>Back then, the Demon Night had also paid a heavy price to explore the area, so they were unwilling to give up easily.</p>

  <p>However, the strength of those martens was so strong that even the top-level war lords couldn't eliminate them. The Demon Night lost more than ten lives, trying in vain to lure the martens away. In the end, they had been left with no choice but to give up.</p>

  <p>What Esther hadn't expected was that with the eruption of the Tide of Chaos, the inner area had been emptied. Therefore, the relic of the strong warrior would naturally be left behind unguarded. At this thought, Esther smiled eagerly.</p>

  <p>Hearing what Esther said, Fabian and Jarrod also felt pleasantly surprised.</p>

  <p>They had risked their lives to walk around here in the inner area. They couldn't leave without getting something in return.</p>

  <p>What did a master in the Dark Nether Cave mean? They were well aware that the relics of a master would probably contain countless treasures and unimaginable things.</p>

  <p>"Well then, let's go in and see what we will find," Luo Luo Zheng suggested.</p>

  <p>After that mad dash just now, the flame emitted by the Jade Butterfly in his space ring had clearly shrunk. Obviously, he was now heading in the wrong direction.</p>

  <p>However, he was not in a hurry at the moment. Since Esther was sure that there was a great opportunity ahead, he felt it was worth to take a detour and check it out.</p>

  <p>Thus, under Esther's lead, the group continued forward. After passing through a patch of dark and twisted trees, Esther pointed ahead and said,</p>

  <p>"It's over there!"</p>

  <p>Just as they made their way out of the forest, they saw a plain and lonely gate in front of them.</p>

  <p>The scene was eerie. There was no house, no roof, no walls, nothing but a gate standing there in the middle of nowhere.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the gate also looked quite ordinary. There were no inscriptions or any identifying markings on it. It was only a small, single gate like those found in ordinary houses.</p>

  <p>"This is the relic?" Fabian asked doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"Yes, there should be words hidden on that gate." Esther was still on high alert. She shot out a stream of life vitality towards that gate while cautiously keeping her distance.</p>

  <p>Back then, she had brought the members of the Demon Night here. Just as they had figured out the hidden words, they had been attacked by a group of poisonous ghost martens. So they had no choice then but to give up and leave.</p>

  <p>After Esther poured her life vitality into the gate, a row of large words appeared on it.</p>

  <p>"I am Adolph. I spent my life in fruitless efforts and my dreams shattered here. It's..."</p>

  <p>It was obvious that the words on the gate was an epitaph that Adolph had written for himself.</p>

  <p>Yolande looked at the gate, lost in thought. Her eyes flickered. As she blinked, her face revealed a brief trace of grief.</p>

  <p>Xun knitted her brows and said in disbelief, "Adolph is dead?</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, he too died here!" As she spoke, she turned to look at Yolande with a mysterious expression on her face.</p>

  <p>"My Queen, who is Adolph?" Esther asked in a hushed tone.</p>

  <p>Xun smiled faintly and answered, "He was a powerful being whose name could have shaken the entire world. I didn't expect him to die here.</p>

  <p>What a joke!"</p>

  <p>Hearing Xun's words, Yolande lightly bit her lips but didn't say anything.</p>

  <p>"This gate should then be a treasure left behind by Adolph, right?" Esther asked again.</p>

  <p>"Yes, indeed. This is his life's treasure, the Gate of Samsara!" Xun said in her usual deadpan voice. In fact, she was as experienced as Yolande.</p>

  <p>However, the secrets of the Dark Nether Cave had originated from the human race, so she certainly didn't know them as well as Yolande did.</p>
