<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Tia's eyes were so beautiful that it looked as if they were the clear waters of autumn. The mesmerizing colors swirled in her orbs, charming anyone who happened to gaze upon them.</p>

  <p>Even if Zheng was in a fully conscious state and looked straight into her eyes, he would be too nervous to know what to do with his heart pounding strongly in his chest.</p>

  <p>If a fiery dragon weren't approaching, Zheng would be able to fully appreciate her beauty, however, the fiery dragon could rush in any time.</p>

  <p>It wasn't a good moment to admire the woman.</p>

  <p>"Hey, hey!" To wake her up, Zheng tried to shake Tia by the shoulders twice.</p>

  <p>However, Tia seemed to be in a fully unconscious state. All she could do was to barely use her left hand to transmit the life vitality to drive phoenix feather in the ice column with her right hand touching Zheng's cheek gently.</p>

  <p>Her cold, wet, little hand caressed Zheng's face, delivering the primitive desire in her heart.</p>

  <p>Slowly, Zheng swallowed, still in a daze. 'God knows why this happened.'</p>

  <p>As he tried to say something to wake her up, she suddenly placed her fingers into his mouth.</p>

  <p>When Zheng felt Tia's cold fingers and caught the cool, sweet smell of her sweat, his mind fell back into a disturbed state.</p>

  <p>As an inexperienced young man, Zheng couldn't resist this kind of temptation, even in a conscious state— he couldn't help kissing her white, fine fingers that looked like thin roots of scallion.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the fiery dragon spirit at the mouth of the cave roared fiercely before rushing back into the cave.</p>

  <p>The rumbling roar abruptly woke Zheng from the semi-conscious state. As a result of the urgent situation, he bit Tia's fingers on instinct.</p>

  <p>"Ahhhhh!"</p>

  <p>Because of the stabbing pain in her fingers, Tia recovered from the coma and withdrew her right hand in an instant. Simultaneously, a lot of life vitality released by her right hand made the fiery dragon step out of the cave once again.</p>

  <p>But her time awake was rather short. After the dragon was driven away, she turned to Zheng and stared at him pointedly.</p>

  <p>Almost pushed to the point of craziness, Zheng reluctantly said, "Oh, I'm going to deal with that dragon spirit myself!"</p>

  <p>Then, he sidestepped Tia's outstretched hand and hit her hard on the back of her neck with his arm. Because of her body's overwhelming power, Zheng had to use over sixty percent of his power just to stun her.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>After a dull thud, Tia fell into Zheng's arms. As he embraced her soft body, he got a whiff of her delicate fragrance, leaving him a little reluctant to put her down.</p>

  <p>Afterward, he did put her on the ground. Since Tia lost control of the ice column in her comatose state, the fiery dragon came into view once again. At this moment, it looked down upon Zheng.</p>

  <p>The dragon spirit was furious after a series of fierce attacks— it was no surprise that it would burn down the two people in front of it to ashes.</p>

  <p>'I shouldn't have let her deal with that fiery dragon from the start!'</p>

  <p>Given the situation, Zheng was fairly annoyed.</p>

  <p>When the roaring dragon spirit lunged at Zheng, it suddenly felt a sense of danger as if it had just encountered its most powerful enemy.</p>

  <p>Although it felt scared subconsciously, the fiery dragon was not very smart and didn't know what exactly was its source of fear. In its mind, the only thing it knew was that it had to guard the crystal key. If the two humans wanted to take it away, the dragon would kill them.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>At this moment, the black fire appearing between Zheng's eyebrows was shot straight at the dragon in one go, looking like a flying black kingfisher.</p>

  <p>Although the black fire was much smaller than the dragon spirit, it successively swallowed the head, the body, and the tail of the huge creature until it was transformed into a single little black flame before disappearing completely into the fire.</p>

  <p>Windy sounds filled the air. Finally, it flew back to Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, everything was quiet. Only white cold air was still emitted by the ice column with phoenix feather in it.</p>

  <p>Looking at the unconscious Tia in his arms, Zheng found it hard to imagine that there was so much explosive force in her thin body.</p>

  <p>After coming out of the cave, Zheng put her down and made her lean against the outside wall.</p>

  <p>While the crisis was temporarily resolved, Zheng seemed to be lost, not knowing the way out. Hoping that the aphrodisiacs no longer had any effect on Tia after she woke up, he waited for her to regain consciousness.</p>

  <p>In order to avoid staring at Tia in a daze, Zheng sat cross-legged beside her to meditate. Before she woke up, Zheng adjusted his body and began practicing.</p>

  <p>Normally, Zheng could enter the practice state instantly. Once he went into that kind of focused state, he often got lost in it, losing his sense of time as the days passed by quickly.</p>

  <p>But that day, Zheng failed to concentrate— he hesitated to even open his eyes and glance at the girl in front of him.</p>

  <p>While Tia was unconscious, her ice armor did not disappear and its long phoenix tail wrapped around her legs making her look like a phoenix that was curled up on the ground.</p>

  <p>With her eyes closed and eyelashes fluttering, she looked like she was dreaming about something.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng was a man with great concentration and attention when he practiced, what happened beside the ice column that day almost made him fail to suppress his own excitement.</p>

  <p>The whole situation was torture.</p>

  <p>To fight his urges, Zheng entered the cave and stepped out with the ice column on his shoulder. Sitting beside it, he was surrounded by layers of cold air and sank into practice state again with a calm heart.</p>

  <p>When he entered the mouth of the flood dragon with Tia, Zheng did not get too many benefits. However, his cyan dragon and black fire became stronger since then— it showed to be a great result.</p>

  <p>Zheng sank further into the practice state.</p>

  <p>As time went by, Zheng kept his eyes closed as he turned the life vitality in his body at a constant rhythm.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, an extremely strong wind blew against Zheng's face. When he opened his eyes, they were met by a palm hitting on his chest before Zheng was heavily knocked against the wall.</p>

  <p>Standing there with long phoenix feathers scattered on the ground was Tia, gritting her teeth angrily, "What did you do to me just now?"</p>

  <p>Getting up from the ground, Zheng rubbed on his chest. Thanks to his great body of spiritual weapon, the force of her palm was not too strong for him. Still, the incident left him rather upset. "What did I do? I didn't do anything to you! You should ask yourself that question!"</p>

  <p>His return made Tia's face instantly turn red as a tomato. However, her color went back to normal when her body was enveloped by cold air.</p>

  <p>Although she was in a nearly unconscious state, she could still remember what happened just earlier. Although they did not do anything that might cross a moral line, as a girl who was always in an authoritative position, she couldn't easily accept the sort of thing that was rather shameful to speak aloud.</p>

  <p>'It seems I'll have to kill him…'</p>

  <p>With her quick temper, Zheng was most definitely on her kill list.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, having sworn to the will of martial arts, she couldn't kill him.</p>

  <p>Puzzled at the moment, Tia put on a confused expression.</p>

  <p>If Fernandez saw such an expression on her face, he would certainly be surprised by the fact that this exceptionally vigorous girl, having shaken heaven and earth in the Central Region for many years, was suddenly in an uncharacteristically hesitant state. He wouldn't believe her confusion Still, Tia failed to find a solution after pondering over it for a while.</p>

  <p>Finally, she gritted her teeth and said as coolly as she could, "You'd better forget about this whole thing. Give me the crystal key! We're going to get the treasure."</p>

  <p>As he handed the crystal stone to Tia, he mumbled with a twitch of his mouth, "Sure, I can forget it. But it looks like someone will remember it forever…"</p>

  <p>"What did you just say?"</p>

  <p>Hearing his snide remark, Tia snapped her head back to glare at him.</p>

  <p>"No…</p>

  <p>I didn't say anything."</p>

  <p>Since it seemed unwise to try and argue with an angry woman who looked like a female lion ready to pounce, Zheng merely shook his head with a seemingly innocent smile on his face.</p>
