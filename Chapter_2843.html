<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The fact the transmission arrays were damaged was not much of an issue.</p>

  <p>After all, the restrictions at the entrances of the forbidden lands were built by the wealthy clans on the Floating Islands. They would be able to rebuild the transmission arrays at any time. However, the destruction of the arrays delivered a bad news...</p>

  <p>The Dongfang Clan's transmission array had also been destroyed.</p>

  <p>In the moment the array had been damaged, the space passageway had separated as if an azure dragon had sliced through the sky.</p>

  <p>At that time inside the passageway, several light spots were moving at incredibly high speed.</p>

  <p>With the transmission array being destroyed, the passageway had been altered, and the path of the light spots deviated towards a square on the Floating Island of the Donfang Clan. Nothing was there to stop the projectiles from crashing directly into the center of the square.</p>

  <p>The collision caused a massive boom to echo across the island, and shake the ground.</p>

  <p>A large crater now consumed more than half the square.</p>

  <p>The impact had caused the island to sink by twenty to thirty feet before slowly bouncing back into place.</p>

  <p>All the guards had scrambled to get away in time to avoid being squashed.</p>

  <p>It took a long moment for the guards to regain their senses and inch their way to the edge of the pit to gaze inside.</p>

  <p>Amazingly, four people stood within the center of the crater.</p>

  <p>The only person any of them recognized was Tianming.</p>

  <p>Tianming had traveled to and from the forbidden lands under his false name Lowell for the past several years.</p>

  <p>"Lowell? You're back!" one of the guards called.</p>

  <p>"What happened in the forbidden land? How is the Holy Emperor?" someone else asked.</p>

  <p>"Hurry up! Go get the elders of our clan!" another guard said, pushing the person next to him into motion.</p>

  <p>The guard stumbled and made it a few steps before he realized there was no need to get the elders.</p>

  <p>With the force of the impact, the elders had already been alerted and were flying towards the spectacle.</p>

  <p>Among them, there were Demi-holy Beings, consummate True Gods, and a single Holy Being.</p>

  <p>The Holy Being went by the name Pierson Dongfang. He stayed in the Ray Tree all year round. He had experienced much in life and was enjoying a mass amount of respect from the other clan members. He seldom moved about the island, though, so people rarely saw much of him over the years.</p>

  <p>When the news of Nicholas's death had spread, the Dongfang Clan decided to ask Pierson Dongfang to take charge in clan matters again.</p>

  <p>As the strongest clan, it was only normal for the Dongfang Clan to have a Holy Being to lead them.</p>

  <p>Casting a glance at Lorena and the others, Pierson Dongfang asked, "Who are you? Why did you leave the Abyss Demon Region and trespass into the transmission array of our clan?"</p>

  <p>Among the four people, there was a Demi-holy Being, two consummate True Gods, and a woman whose cultivation base Pierson Dongfang couldn't identify.</p>

  <p>Despite Nicholas's death, the Dongfang Clan still held rule over this property. Especially now that Pierson Dongfang had emerged from his self-imposed seclusion and taken over as leader He simply had no reason to take these people seriously.</p>

  <p>Lorena's face settled into a cold mask.</p>

  <p>She could only think of Rosie in this moment.</p>

  <p>She knew Rosie had spoken the truth when she'd told her she could not die.</p>

  <p>But if the Abyss Demon Region was truly under Samuel's control, what kind of torture would she have to endure? Lorena didn't have the heart to imagine what she might suffer.</p>

  <p>She had been in a decent mood from meeting Luo Zheng and obtaining the Blood Body, but now her mind had sunken into a pit of despair and anger. She didn't care for the questioning of this Pierson Dongfang character.</p>

  <p>When none of them spoke, Pierson Dongfang scowled down at them.</p>

  <p>Before he could throw a tantrum at the lack of respect, someone else spoke.</p>

  <p>"Lowell! You are back!" a middle-aged man beside Pierson Dongfang said in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Winthrop, you know one of these...these people?" Pierson Dongfang asked.</p>

  <p>Winthrop Dongfang was the eldest of a branch of the Dongfang Clan. He also happened to be Iris's father, Tianming's father-in-law.</p>

  <p>Although Winthrop Dongfang had the cultivation base of a Demi-holy Being and was extremely powerful, he usually remained in the Ray Tree all year round and seldom came to the Floating Island just like Pierson Dongfang.</p>

  <p>He had been invited this time for the same reason as Pierson Dongfang.</p>

  <p>"Father-in-law," Tianming greeted, folding his hands one over the other and bowing his head in respect.</p>

  <p>Winthrop Dongfang seemed pleased by the action.</p>

  <p>Many of the clan members were strong warriors, so it had proven difficult for Winthrop Dongfang to find such an excellent match for his daughter. He lucked out with finding Tianming.</p>

  <p>Over the past years, Lowell had risen rapidly to fame and gained great appreciation from Nicholas. He could be nearly as powerful as Troy already. Because of him, Winthrop Dongfang's influence in the Ray Tree Region had grown, and thanks to that, even other Dongfangs in his branch were much more respected.</p>

  <p>Naturally, he was glad to see Lowell come back safely.</p>

  <p>"Now that you've returned, tell us, how are the others of the alliance? What about our Holy Beings and other clan members? Where are they?" He then proceeded to list many names.</p>

  <p>Listening to him patiently, Tianming waited for him to finish. When his father-in-law was finished, he calmly replied, "All members of the alliance were killed. Holy Nicholas died too. Some Holy Beings were forced back to the universes. The rest unfortunately all died."</p>

  <p>"What?" The word was barely whispered. Winthrop Dongfang was astonished. He could barely find the words to express his shock.</p>

  <p>Everyone else was dumbfounded by the news.</p>

  <p>After the collapse of Nicholas' universe, they had expected the alliance to suffer a great loss.</p>

  <p>They hadn't expected it to be so severe, though.</p>

  <p>"Speak plainly, brat! How exactly did Holy Nicholas die? Why did he die, and yet you could come back unharmed?" Pierson Dongfang demanded.</p>

  <p>Tianming might have joined the Dongfang Clan with a single purpose in mind, but he and Iris had become married and Winthrop Dongfang was very good to him.</p>

  <p>For that reason he now found himself in a dilemma, so he just raised his eyebrows and chose to say nothing.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng could feel the pressure Tianming was being placed under.</p>

  <p>It was not his fault, Luo Zheng knew.</p>

  <p>Tianming had done enough and had sacrificed too much.</p>

  <p>However, the truth would come to light sooner rather than later.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng spoke loudly and clearly. "He could come back because of his strength.</p>

  <p>Nicholas proved to not be strong enough, so he died. You have lived for many years. Do you not understand such a simple thing?"</p>

  <p>As a well-known Holy Being, Pierson Dongfang felt properly chastised to be lectured by Luo Zheng, a mere consummate True God. He was on the verge of exploding with fury.</p>

  <p>Winthrop Dongfang decided to bring the conversation back to the most important subject. "Lowell, how did Holy Nicholas die?"</p>

  <p>Hearing the question, Pierson Dongfang reined in his anger and waited for the answer.</p>

  <p>"Of course he was killed by Tianming and myself," Luo Zheng said with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>The expressions of everyone present around the pit morphed into ones of confusion and disbelief.</p>

  <p>There was simply no way what Luo Zheng said was true. They refused to believe it.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was simply a consummate True God, and yet he dared to talk this nonsense on the Floating Island of the Dongfang Clan. Everyone thought either he was an idiot, or he had some trick he relied on to be so arrogant.</p>

  <p>This made them curious beyond a doubt. What could Luo Zheng have that gave him the upper hand?</p>

  <p>"Who the hell do you think you are to be so..."</p>

  <p>Pierson Dongfang sputtered and finally lost his temper. He reached out one hand to grab Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The moment he'd moved, though, Lorena moved to stand before Luo Zheng to protect him. She would not stand by as someone threatened her son in this way.</p>

  <p>"You talk too much!"</p>

  <p>She raised her hand and a crimson light awl shot from her palm and cut towards the old man with a harrowing shriek.</p>

  <p>The sound made everyone's ears throb.</p>

  <p>The crimson light awl might be only three inches long, but it was fierce.</p>

  <p>The aura it contained made the Holy Being feel a slight amount of fear.</p>

  <p>Pierson Dongfang hadn't expected that someone from these four would dare to fight him and attempt to kill him.</p>

  <p>It was too late for him to dodge the attack, though.</p>

  <p>Gritting his teeth, he brought both hands before him and made to snatch the awl.</p>

  <p>He grabbed at it six or seven times.</p>

  <p>Each grab could only slow down the light awl little by little.</p>

  <p>His face became increasingly stormy and the scowl pulled the corners of his lips down.</p>

  <p>The power of the crimson light awl didn't seem to be weakening.</p>

  <p>It kept coming for him as if it were death itself.</p>

  <p>The overwhelming feeling of danger had Pierson Dongfang nearly use all of his internal momentum to summon a golden bell shadow to shield himself.</p>

  <p>Dong!</p>

  <p>The sound of the light awl hitting the bell reverberated through the ground and up everyone's feet.</p>

  <p>The toll was so loud that people on Floating Islands nearby could hear it clearly.</p>

  <p>An unmistakable cracking sound could be heard, and fissures began to crawl across the bell.</p>

  <p>The bell had only slowed down the light awl for a short moment before the bell disintegrated and became fine powder on the ground.</p>

  <p>With a pained grunt, the light awl burrowed through Pierson Dongfang's chest and burst out his back leaving a triangular hole behind.</p>

  <p>With a single move, Lorena had nearly mortally wounded Pierson Dongfang.</p>
