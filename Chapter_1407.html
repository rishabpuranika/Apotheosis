<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh...</p>

  <p>The wind had remained persistent.</p>

  <p>Everyone watched the strange scene unfolding in front of them, with no one knowing what exactly it meant.</p>

  <p>"Is this my luck?</p>

  <p>One's karmic luck is innate. Then, does that mean that the silhouette of this giant has been with me ever since I was born?</p>

  <p>But if it is the case, then it would have accompanied me through the Eastern Region, the Central Region, the Sea God Continent, the Divine Kingdom Continent, and the ascension...</p>

  <p>Why does my luck take this form?'</p>

  <p>An onslaught of questions flooded Zheng's mind as doubts tugged at him and filled him. Those Luck-devouring Snakes were still hanging suspended in the air, continuously devouring the giant's body.</p>

  <p>The Sunset World lord wore a puzzled expression.</p>

  <p>The Upper World had a thorough and deeply-rooted understanding of karmic luck. It was something that couldn't be seen or touched, but everyone knew that karmic luck was ever-present. There were only certain methods that could influence it to some extent.</p>

  <p>However, fate was formless. And yet, here was its manifestation, with an undeniable shape.</p>

  <p>In retrospect, the Luck-devouring Snake was also an existence thought to be found only in legends. A creature eating away one's luck sounded absurd, but to witness it was another thing entirely.</p>

  <p>One could only imagine how shocked everyone was when they saw it happening to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>They had yet to recover from their astonishment when the giant's silhouette started to move.</p>

  <p>No wind penetrated this area, and the giant's shape became more defined.</p>

  <p>The spectators watched the outline of a giant change in shape and redirect the path of the wind, creating the illusion of movement.</p>

  <p>It brought a heavy hand to its body, right where the creatures devoured it.</p>

  <p>The next instant, one of the golden Luck-devouring Snakes had been reduced to dust.</p>

  <p>"This …"</p>

  <p>It was as if the lord of the Sunset World had lost all capacity for intelligible speech. He gaped the scene, wide-eyed and wordless.</p>

  <p>The other palace leaders mirrored his expression on their faces. What was happening before them was something beyond their comprehension.</p>

  <p>Even the most knowledgeable among them had no explanation for the events they had witnessed.</p>

  <p>After the first Luck-devouring Snake had been smashed, the giant's outline once again waved its hand in the air, slapping its body. In a split second, another snake was pulverized. Bits of gold powder scattered in the air.</p>

  <p>This went on with a third, a fourth, a fifth …</p>

  <p>The palace leaders, still unable to speak, watched the scene in silence.</p>

  <p>No one had expected such a thing to happen, and they had no means of comprehending it. It would be wisest to wait until the whole thing was over before making any move.</p>

  <p>One after another, the Luck-devouring Snakes were pounded into dust by the giant's hands.</p>

  <p>There were only eight of them. By this time, seven had been destroyed, with the eighth seeming to have drilled into the giant's torso.</p>

  <p>The giant reached out with its hand. The next moment, the snake was plucked out of its body and choked with a merciless squeeze.</p>

  <p>Zheng's face was filled with amazement.</p>

  <p>As the person with a direct connection to all this, there was no one else more shocked than him.</p>

  <p id="top_20">He observed the giant figure, his brow creasing slightly as he sensed a familiar energy from the silhouette.</p>

  <p>He had seen this giant somewhere before, but even as he scoured through his memory, he could not remember who the giant was.</p>

  <p>All of the eight Luck-devouring Snakes had been smashed to pieces. A golden powder of some sort swirled in the air until it descended, settling down onto Luo Zheng and vanishing.</p>

  <p>The snake was untouchable, and the giant's outline was an intangible existence.</p>

  <p>The wind gradually came to a halt after the snakes had been pulverized.</p>

  <p>As the whipping lashes began to subside, the giant's outline also gradually disappeared until it vanished, leaving behind no trace of its existence.</p>

  <p>Silence swept over the space even as things had seemingly returned to their original state.</p>

  <p>No one dared utter a word, as if fearing that one sound would cause another anomaly. Everyone was certain of only one thing: Luo Zheng had survived the calamity of the Luck-devouring Snake.</p>

  <p>Not one among them, not even Luo Zheng himself understood what had happened.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng seems to have absorbed the snakes after they were destroyed. Will that golden powder give him some sort of new power?" someone asked.</p>

  <p>In the world of warriors, it was common knowledge: the greater the danger, the more power it held.</p>

  <p>Would absorbing that strange, unknown substance strengthen Zheng's own luck?</p>

  <p>As with most of the things that happened, no one held the answer to the palace leader's question. The Luck-devouring Snake was a legendary, almost unheard of existence. There was nothing they could consult about its origins or effects.</p>

  <p>"Does this mean that… I have survived my first Heavenly Tribulation?"</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes flickered, his expression becoming increasingly calm.</p>

  <p>However, it would not last long.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The next moment, Luo Zheng found himself facing a Thunder Tribulation.</p>

  <p>Of all the Heavenly tribulations, the Thunder Tribulation was the most common. However, this was no ordinary tribulation.</p>

  <p>Just as the purplish black heavenly thunder appeared, it crashed downwards directly from the sky!</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>From a far distance, a giant dragon appeared, charging straight towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>It landed right in front of him, puncturing a huge crater into the ground.</p>

  <p>Once again, the palace leaders found themselves speechless. The Thunder Tribulation had gone into disorder as if some force had tampered with its natural course.</p>

  <p>Seeing this scene, everyone had a surprised expression on their faces.</p>

  <p>Since when had the Thunder Tribulation gone into disorder? It was unheard of.</p>

  <p>Boom …</p>

  <p>A purplish-black bolt of lightning suddenly came crashing down from the sky. Luo Zheng dodged the attack quickly, and it had landed on his right side, not far from him.</p>

  <p>Boom, boom, boom...</p>

  <p>One after another, bolts of lightning rained down from the sky. The earth shook with vibrations as they continuously missed their target and landed on the ground. The power contained in each of the lightning bolts was enough to kill a Soul Sea Realm warrior.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was unharmed. He had managed to dodge every time a lightning bolt was about to strike him. All around him, fissures opened up in the ground.</p>

  <p>Not long after, a giant crater formed in front of him. The lightning bolts were incessant in their assault, but not one of them hit Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Luck! Zheng's fortune must have been strengthened!"</p>

  <p>"It's most likely due to the Luck-devouring Snakes. I wonder how long the effects would last."</p>

  <p>"Is it possible that this kind of luck would be permanent? If it continues like this forever, Luo Zheng would always possess terrifying luck!"</p>

  <p>The palace leaders discussed their conjectures amongst themselves.</p>

  <p>In their eyes, the Heavenly Tribulation was among the absolutes in the entire universe. How could the heavens make mistakes?</p>

  <p>At present, Zheng's karmic luck seemed to be incredibly powerful. Up until this moment, no lightning bolt had struck him. It was all too strange.</p>

  <p>An expression of surprise surfaced on Zheng's face as he avoided the lightning strikes from the tribulation. He couldn't explain it himself, but it seemed that his luck had suddenly increased to unimaginable heights.</p>

  <p>Yolande had the same thing in mind. Suddenly, she rose and closed the distance between her and Luo Zheng. He was preoccupied with his tribulation.</p>

  <p>Extending her hand, she sent an intangible wave surging towards him.</p>

  <p>The palm strike contained a thousandth of her strength. Had Luo Zheng been sitting on the spot, he would have had no chances of dodging it.</p>

  <p>Another strange occurrence once again took place. Before Yolande's strike could reach Luo Zheng, the air shifted around, creating a windstorm that erupted and directly clashed with Yolande's palm strike, effectively circumventing the attack.</p>

  <p>When the other palace leaders saw this, they became more confused than ever.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was still dodging lightning, seemingly oblivious to what had just taken place. It was impossible for the windstorm to have come from him.</p>

  <p>It had been formed naturally. But why?</p>

  <p>The Orange Sea World was a broken world, but it had always been secure. Many years of operation by the alliance was testament to its stability. The possibility of a space windstorm appearing in such a stable space was almost nonexistent.</p>

  <p>And yet, with the most minuscule probability, the windstorm had undeniably appeared.</p>
