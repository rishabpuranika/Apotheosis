<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng Luo? So it is him."</p>

  <p>Fren was very impressed with this name.</p>

  <p>As per his memory, this guy knocked his brother, Chad out of the Blooded Test.</p>

  <p>After being eliminated from the Blooded Test, Chad begged him to get rid of  Luo Luo Zheng Luo.</p>

  <p>Since Fren wouldn't deal with a weak opponent who was at the organ refining level personally, he commanded Thomas, a loyal servant, to be in charge of that.</p>

  <p>It was beyond Fren's expectation that Thomas would fail. Instead, he was taught a lesson by Luo Luo Zheng, and he complained tearfully upon his return.</p>

  <p>By that time, to Fren, Luo Luo Zheng was just like a clown who was beneath his notice. He wouldn't bother spending more time dealing with Luo Luo Zheng. It wasn't until Liam from Drizzle Peak came to him that Fren sent White Fiend and Black Fiend to the south to kill Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He never thought that Liam, White Fiend and Black Fiend would die in the south.</p>

  <p>A few days later, Luo Luo Zheng was at the auction house and making trouble for Fren!</p>

  <p>Thinking of this, the smile on Fren's face became more intense.</p>

  <p>He followed the aisle of the auction house and sauntered toward the wing.</p>

  <p>Many people in the auction house saw this scene. Suddenly they were filled with apprehension.</p>

  <p>Fren was notorious in the Imperial Capital.</p>

  <p>He was crazy, arrogant, and not afraid of anything. If he caused mischief here, the Zhang Clan would be in trouble.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Wurth headed toward Luo Zheng's room with his people.</p>

  <p>Zhang's servants had reported to him about the dispute between Luo Luo Zheng and Fren. And Wurth knew that Luo Luo Zheng had previously quarreled with Fren's servant and offended Fren at Drizzle Peak. That was why he?gathered his people and rushed over. He took the initiative to stop in front of Fren.</p>

  <p>"Fren!" greeted Wurth with a big smile on his face as usual.</p>

  <p>No one would slap Wurth, as it was very hard to be angry when Wurth smiled.</p>

  <p>Fren tapped his fingers on his head as though he was thinking. He pretended that he needed time to figure out the identity of the man in front of him. And then he pointed to Wurth and asked, "You are... the second child of the Zhang Clan. Is Wick your elder brother?"</p>

  <p>Wurth nodded and answered, "Yes, my brother is walking the guests out.</p>

  <p>He is not available right now."</p>

  <p>Just as Wurth finished, Fren suddenly stepped forward and embraced Wurth's fat body tightly!</p>

  <p>The people in the auction house were stunned for a while. Even the two guards who followed Wurth blushed with embarrassment. They?didn't know how to deal with such a situation.</p>

  <p>They were bound to protect Wurth, but they feared Fren. They didn't know if they should separate the two noble clansmen. So they consoled themselves by thinking that Fren did not want to hurt Wurth. After all, it was a sudden hug. Their master should be fine.</p>

  <p>It was said that Fren was flaky. In fact, that was true. Otherwise, his nickname 'Fren the loony' would be unfounded.</p>

  <p>Fren did not do anything out of the ordinary to Wurth. He just patted Wurth on the shoulder and whispered into Wurth's ear, "Take it easy. I am not looking for a fight in your territory for the sake of your family and your brother. But there is something that I want to say to the little guy up there. Could you please step aside?"</p>

  <p>Wurth's forehead was sweaty. He knew of Fren's reputation and power.</p>

  <p>There was a very real possibility that Wurth would die if Fren used a little strength. He became apprehensive and could do nothing except nod stiffly and step aside. After all, Fren had asked politely.</p>

  <p>Then Fren released Wurth and patted him on the shoulder again. He bypassed Wurth and continued to walk toward the room. Soon, he reached Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stayed on guard. His demonic life energy started to surge inside him slowly. Then it began spreading along the muscles and vessels in his body. Soon it gained momentum and Luo Luo Zheng felt ready to fight.</p>

  <p>"You are  Luo Luo Zheng Luo?" asked Fren with a smile as he stopped in front of Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded calmly, and his expression was serene as he answered, "Yes.</p>

  <p>What do you want?"</p>

  <p>"I heard that you hurt my servant and killed White Fiend and Black Fiend," said Fren.</p>

  <p>"Your servant offended me. I just taught him an unforgettable lesson.</p>

  <p>And White Fiend and Black Fiend were trying to take my life. I simply returned the favor. They deserved that," replied Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Crack, crack, crack..."</p>

  <p>Fren clapped his hands. Since most people had left the auction house and the rest were silently watching the situation, Fren's claps sounded harsher, and the scene became weirder.</p>

  <p>"You have some nerve. Did you say that you want me to die? Very well. I haven't seen such a courageous man like you for a long time!" Fren grinned. Then he continued, "But generally speaking, a man of your courage would die for his actions!"</p>

  <p>Fren's favorite attack method was to exert pressure on his opponent in spirit so that he could mercilessly torture his opponent. According to Fren's research, Luo Luo Zheng was a low-born commoner with no strong background. And Fren had already thought of a thousand different ways to kill him.</p>

  <p>But compared with inflicting physical injury on his opponent, Fren preferred spiritual torment. This was Fren's usual technique.</p>

  <p>"Oh, really?" said Luo Luo Zheng as his lips lifted into a sneer. "Although you like to threaten people in your mad and arrogant way, I have heard countless threats like yours in my life. Do you really think that you are creative enough? What a cliche!"</p>

  <p>Hearing what Luo Luo Zheng said, the smile on Fren's face froze.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng added, "If you want my life, just come up and get it. You and your family are nothing in my eyes. Please, save your threats. By the way, the Weapon Refining Principle is in my hands now. I will surely commit every single word to memory and then burn it to ashes. If you expect to to take it from me, you can try to open my head and see if you can find the contents of the book!"</p>
