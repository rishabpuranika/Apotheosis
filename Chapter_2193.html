<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2193 A Top-rank True God (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Malloy was seated within the main hall of the Heavenly Han House.</p>

  <p>There were equally two people sitting by his side, both of whom were at the peak of the cultivation level of mid-rank True Gods.</p>

  <p>They weren't True Gods of the Heavenly Han House who taught the Godly Ways, but they were leaders of the Han Clan sub-branches.</p>

  <p>Although the sub-branches of the Han Clan were not considered as powerful as the rich clans on the Floating Islands, they were still first-tier clans. The strength and number of the True Gods from these clans far exceeded that of ordinary second-tier or third-tier clan.</p>

  <p>Currently, there were a total of twenty-seven sub-branches of Han Clan, each respectively led by one of the twenty-seven sub-branch leaders.</p>

  <p>These two specific individuals were the leader of the ninth sub-branch, Luke Han, and the leader of the twelfth sub-branch, Declan Han. Zane, who himself had just entered the Heavenly Han House, was Luke Han's son.</p>

  <p>"The news we received earlier from Mirror City has just been confirmed.</p>

  <p>Tianxing Luo's origin is very suspicious," Luke Han said with a frown.</p>

  <p>Ever since the moment Luo Zheng had risen to prominence in the Brilliant Moon Restaurant, many forces had tried to track his background down.</p>

  <p>However, at the time, the information that Luo Zheng had provided was too little, and despite their many inquiries, they still hadn't found any clues concerning Zheng's background. For this reason, on their list, they could only describe him as 'the mysterious youth'.</p>

  <p>Not long ago though, during the Heavenly Han House examination in fact, Luo Zheng had mentioned that he came from the Misty Mountain Village of the Vast Sky Region.</p>

  <p>That was when the Han Clan had sent people out to investigate Zheng's identity.</p>

  <p>And the Han Clan's efficiency was very high. Within no more than a few days, they had found the divine citizens of the Misty Mountain Village.</p>

  <p>At first, the answers given by the divine citizens in the Misty Mountain Village were exactly the same as what Luo Zheng had said. Luo Zheng indeed seemed to come from the Misty Mountain Village. After the further investigation though, they quickly began to discover a few truths which included a conflict between the Misty Mountain Village and the Sun Moon Village, as well as Master Evil's return.</p>

  <p>They also knew that Luo Zheng wasn't a native of the Misty Mountain Village.</p>

  <p>He had stayed in the Misty Mountain Village for less than half a year, and the divine citizens of the Misty Mountain Village were actually completely unaware of Zheng's origin.</p>

  <p>As a result, up to that point, Zheng's identity had remained a mystery. After all, he was deliberately concealing it and thus discovering it wasn't going to be an easy task!</p>

  <p>"I think so too!" Declan Han said as he nodded his head in agreement.</p>

  <p>"This guy deliberately hides his identity and then sneaks his way into the Han Clan... He probably has some kind of conspiracy."</p>

  <p>The forces within the divine land all developed according to the model of a specific clan, and they each attached high importance to the backgrounds of the people they cultivated. Although the Han Clan would also train outsiders in order to own more talents, they thought it was important to figure out the outsiders' background first. They wouldn't just train some strange martial artist whose origins and intentions were completely unknown to them.</p>

  <p>There were sixty-seven warriors who had entered the Heavenly Han House. Aside from Luo Zheng, the Han Clan was fully and clearly aware of the other warriors' backgrounds. Even more so, their lineage could be traced back several generations.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng possessed such a remarkable talent, and yet, his origins remained mysterious. To anyone dealing with this situation, it indeed seemed weird.</p>

  <p>Malloy smiled, but it was barely noticeable. "How can there be so many schemes? Maybe Tianxing Luo is a talent from a Floating Island?"</p>

  <p>Malloy, on his behalf, equally didn't believe that Luo Zheng was an ordinary divine citizen simply born in a remote village. It was impossible for such a character to exist in a small and remote village, anyway. The divine land had developed over so many years, and all its resources had been monopolized by the wealthy clans. And the talents had been continually inherited through blood lineage. It was extremely rare that such an outstanding warrior would be born in a remote, poor village.</p>

  <p>"Do you really think there's still a rich clan on the Floating Island willing to allow one of their talents to cultivate outside, alone? Even if that was the case, would our Han Clan be willing to accept him?" Declan Han asked again, with more emphasis this time.</p>

  <p>Malloy glanced at Declan Han and smiled, more obviously this time.</p>

  <p>"Since the two of you are having such thoughts, how do you think we should deal with Tianxing, then? Expel him from the Heavenly Han House, hmm? As long as the two of you and Bentley agree, I won't hesitate, not even for a second!"</p>

  <p>Upon hearing Malloy's words, Declan Han and Luke Han fell silent, adding nothing more to the conversation.</p>

  <p>"To put it bluntly, you both just want me to take all the responsibility.</p>

  <p>You want to recommend Tianxing to the Floating Island, but you're equally worried about his unknown origin. If something happens in the future, you don't want to be implicated." Malloy's eyes glittered. "If that's the case, then speak up, and I will take the responsibility!"</p>

  <p>Malloy's words had clearly revealed Luke Han's and Declan Han's true feelings. Their facial features were completely distorted now.</p>

  <p>If the Han Clan sub-branches didn't provide a suitable candidate, then the Han Clan would really take some actions, and if that were to be the case, the twenty-seven Han Clan sub-branches would be in deep trouble.</p>

  <p>Through the Heavenly Han House's test, they were capable of figuring out that Luo Zheng had a remarkable talent. This fellow clearly surpassed an ordinary talent, and by far. Even among the rich clans on the Floating Islands, never had there been such an extraordinary proving godly warrior in the past!</p>
