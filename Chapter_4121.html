<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>



  <p>
</p>

  <p>The method the Evil God used to destroy cities and murder people required little to no effort from him.</p>

  <p>Every time the Black Ship passed by a big city, countless stalagmites would emerge from the ground.</p>

  <p>Because no one knew the exact locations where the stalagmites would emerge from, when they did, the city would collapse and it would cause great chaos on the land.</p>

  <p>With the stalagmites doing all the job, he didn't even have to break a sweat in doing what he wished to do.</p>

  <p>The stalagmites also made it incredibly difficult for people of all kinds who wished to flee the land to do so. These included the True Gods, warriors at the Other Shore Realm, and even warriors at the Chaotic Source Realm. Even if they attempted to escape to the best of their abilities, the stalagmites would continue to emerge from nowhere, block their paths, or simply push them to the brink of exhaustion until they fully decided to give up.</p>

  <p>Some big cities were guarded by warriors at the Holy Soul Realm, who would charge towards the Black Ship to stop it from causing further damage.</p>

  <p>However, the Evil God steered the ship as if it were lightning.</p>

  <p>The ship was so fast that as soon as the warriors at the Holy Soul Realm arrived at the destination where the it was said to have been, the ship would already have left.</p>

  <p>The warriors, however, not being able to accept this, would make use of the spatial transference, only to discover that the space was sealed. As they looked back, they would realize that in the moments they spent in trying to use the spatial transference, their city had already been destroyed by the uncountable stalagmites.</p>

  <p>It was a scene that happened again and again, but no one seemed to learn much from it.</p>

  <p>Wherever the Black Ship passed, the place was left in ruins.</p>

  <p>After flying across and destroying several territories, the Black Ship neared the Blood Sea Province.</p>

  <p>In the Moon Shield City stood three powerful warriors at the Holy Soul Realm, all left with the duty of protecting the city.</p>

  <p>Recently, the Bearing race had suffered a lot. The presence of the Black Ship was more than enough reason for the people of the Bearing race to not sleep at night. However, their strongest warrior of the Ji Clan had still not done anything to better their situation, which caused distrust and panic among the people.</p>

  <p>The three warriors at the Holy Soul Realm, who were meant to protect the Moon Shield City, were also deeply anxious as they stood in a hall.</p>

  <p>"I hope the Black Ship bypasses our Blood Sea Province! Please let the ship streak straight to the Grand Cyan Province!" a long-haired warrior at the Holy Soul Realm said.</p>

  <p>"I wish so too, but I fear it's impossible," an old man at the Holy Soul Realm said. "The Black Ship is simply going on a straight route. They're not even afraid that their path's become predictable. They don't care if someone is right on their tail or plans to ambush them. They're confident they'll be able to defeat anyone or anything standing in their way. That's what makes them even scarier," he continued.</p>

  <p>The old man showed the guards his map, which had a straight, black line indicating the course the Black Ship had been taking— from where it had been to where it was heading to.</p>

  <p>From what the map showed, it did seem impossible that the ship even had the slightest intention of avoiding the Blood Sea Province. It seemed clear that they were heading right for it.</p>

  <p>The question they needed to be answered, however, was what the Blood Sea Province had that piqued the interest of the Evil God and his Black Ship so much.</p>

  <p>There was absolutely nothing in the area he could have use for!</p>

  <p>All they had was a military stronghold, nothing else.</p>

  <p>"This is ridiculous. The Black Ship will arrive any minute, ready to turn our province into a cave floor. We're all about to meet our doom, and the Yellow Thearch is still nowhere to be found. Where could he possibly be?</p>

  <p>What could be more important than this?" Jimena Ji said, raking her hair with her fingers in heavy frustration. She was Yellow Thearch's niece, her status even ranking among the top five in the Ji Clan.</p>

  <p>"Do you think the reason your uncle isn't here is that he was seriously injured in the battle at the Pear Hill?" the old man said in an obvious attempt to retrieve a definite answer from the rumors.</p>

  <p>Yellow Thearch was an Eternal Realm warrior, which meant he served an extremely important part in the race's security from attacks. Eternal Realm warriors were the backbones of the super forces. If this backbone collapsed, not only would it be a devastating blow to the entire Ji clan but also to the entire race.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. Maybe he has other plans," Jimena Ji sighed.</p>

  <p>Only a very small number of people knew that Yellow Thearch had been seriously injured, and she had to keep it secret.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, they all felt something approaching. Its presence was nearly unbearable. They all rushed out of the hall, shooting themselves into the air as swiftly as they could.</p>

  <p>From their view, much to their dismay, they saw a black ship floating above the Moon Shield City.</p>

  <p>"Octavio, you stay here. Guard the Moon Shield City.</p>

  <p>Jimena, come with me. We're going to stop the Black Ship," the old man commanded.</p>

  <p>The old man and Jimena Ji rushed towards the Black Ship and blocked its way. They readied themselves for its attacks.</p>

  <p>However, strangely enough, the Black Ship did not act as they expected.</p>

  <p>This situation was unlike they had ever heard of before, making the old man feel uneasy.</p>

  <p>From what they had heard in the past, the ship was always flying at an incredibly rapid speed.</p>

  <p>When the Black Ship passed through a city, the city would be destroyed.</p>

  <p>Nothing would be left of it. This was why the old man asked Octavio to stay put and guard the Moon Shield City. However, nothing was happening. It was all too strange.</p>

  <p>A few moments passed until they heard heavy footsteps on the deck.</p>

  <p>Walking out was the Evil God. His eyes scanned the surroundings, only to meet Jimena Ji's.</p>

  <p>When this happened, an unidentifiable expression crossed Jimena Ji's face.</p>

  <p>They sensed a familiar aura from each other, almost like they had met each other before. And in some way, they did.</p>

  <p>In the past, after Yellow Thearch brought Usman back to their race, it was Jimena Ji who was put in charge of training him.</p>

  <p>Later, the Evil God had devoured Usman together with the memories he held. Because of this, the Evil god recognized the woman, and oddly enough, felt a desire for her, a desire which stemmed from the young Usman.</p>

  <p>Usman grew strong fast under Jimena Ji's borderline torturous training.</p>

  <p>She was incredibly tough with him, and her strength drove him mad. He longed for her so deeply.</p>
