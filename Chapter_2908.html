<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2908 The Black Ball </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As Pascal charged at Zheng, a black spear appeared in his hand.</p>

  <p>Zheng's expression had also turned serious.</p>

  <p>Although Pascal was just a consummate True God, he had control over the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>And the person behind him was none other than Samuel!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Just as the black spear was about to stab him, Zheng gently twisted his body and avoided Pascal's attack.</p>

  <p>Ever since he had mastered the Truth of Cultivation Nature, his every move contained the Truth of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>While avoiding the spear, Zheng stretched out his arm and turned it over. Red lotus flowers rapidly blossomed and spread out from his arm.</p>

  <p>The moment they appeared, the temperature everywhere within a radius of ten miles rose. The Demi-holy Beings and consummate True Gods immediately felt overwhelmed by the heat.</p>

  <p>The red lotus flowers quickly spread and twined around the black spear.</p>

  <p>If they could encircle Pascal's body, he would probably be burned to ashes in an instant.</p>

  <p>Even a Holy Being like Clark, who was skilled in the Elementary Fire Godly Way, hadn't been able to escape these red lotus flowers. Even though Pascal controlled the Abyss Demon Region, his body hadn't been reinforced to a great extent. In Zheng's eyes, there was no way Pascal could resist his attack.</p>

  <p>However, Pascal shook his spear lightly, and the red lotus flowers twining around it cracked into pieces!</p>

  <p>"Humph!" Pascal said gruffly.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes flashed with surprise. The red lotus flowers hadn't been able to transfer the black energy!</p>

  <p>In the Abyss Demon Region, Zheng's red lotus flowers and Tianming's ice flowers had been able to transfer almost all energy. But now, the red lotus flowers seemed to have no effect on Pascal's black energy.</p>

  <p>After the red lotus flowers cracked, Pascal didn't stop. The tip of his spear drew an arc in the air and came straight toward Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...</p>

  <p>Zheng suddenly turned his body and released hundreds of red lotus flowers that quickly shot forth and enveloped Pascal.</p>

  <p>As long as they found a slight gap, they would be able to kill him.</p>

  <p>However, at this moment, the ring in Pascal's hand flashed.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>More black energy came out of Pascal's body and instantly transformed into a set of black armor that tightly covered him from head to toe, making it impossible for the hundreds of red lotus flowers to find a gap.</p>

  <p>When Pascal shook his body, all the red lotus flowers cracked once again.</p>

  <p>"You want to kill me in this way? How childish you are!" With a derisive laugh, Pascal waved his spear at Zheng, shooting out a ring of black energy that fell over him.</p>

  <p>Zheng frowned slightly and rushed in another direction, trying to escape from the ring.</p>

  <p>However, it was too late, as the ring transformed into a black ball, completely trapping Zheng within it.</p>

  <p>"Your movement technique is not bad, but there is no way to escape now."</p>

  <p>With a sneer, Pascal suddenly pinched the black ball in the air.</p>

  <p>"Zheng!"</p>

  <p>"Stop!"</p>

  <p>Both Sword Chen and Tianming took action at this moment.</p>

  <p>Sword Chen's long sword slashed out. The threads of sword radiance formed a fine net that flew down toward Pascal and the black ball to envelop them both.</p>

  <p>However, Pascal's black energy was extremely unique and was insusceptible to almost any other energy. In fact, Pascal didn't even dodge the attack. A harsh sound echoed through the area when the threads of sword radiance cut his body, but he didn't get hurt at all.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Tianming shot a bunch of ice flowers at Pascal.</p>

  <p>Both ice flowers and red lotus flowers had the same function. Although they weren't powerful on their own, they could transform anything they touched. One would solidify all other energy while the other would violently burn all other energy.</p>

  <p>However, Pascal was not afraid of Zheng's red lotus flowers nor Tianming's ice flowers!</p>

  <p>Seeing this scene, Tianming couldn't help but feel anxious.</p>

  <p>In the Abyss Demon Region, Zheng and Tianming were able to fight together without fear of any Holy Being's tricks, because the ice flowers and the red lotus flowers were complementary and could transform any energy for the two of them to use.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Pascal's black energy was able to resist any sort of transformation. Even if Zheng and Tianming managed to establish a connection, it would be meaningless!</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Powerful energy was released all of a sudden, filling the black ball.</p>

  <p>The area covered by the ball was like hell, and any creature within it would be annihilated.</p>

  <p>However, about nine seconds later, Zheng stepped out of the other side of the ball, tainted with a faint aura of the Time Law.</p>

  <p>He had had no other choice but to use the Time Jade Seal again.</p>

  <p>Outside the Mountain of Holy Beings, Samuel was floating in the air with his legs crossed. He frowned when he saw the scene through Pascal's eyes.</p>

  <p>It had been a huge mistake to let the Time Jade Seal fall into Zheng's hands!</p>

  <p>After wiping out a period of time, Zheng had almost turned into an immortal being.</p>

  <p>As Samuel moved his mouth slightly outside the Mountain of Holy Beings, Pascal said in a cold voice, "You might be able to get away this time, but the Time Jade Seal won't always be able to help you. Do you want to give it another try? Do you think you can still escape next time?"</p>

  <p>As Pascal gently waved his right hand, another huge black ring appeared, this time with a diameter of five miles.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The ring trembled and fell downward.</p>

  <p>"Retreat!"</p>

  <p>"Don't let the ring cover you!"</p>

  <p>"Is Pascal going to kill us too?"</p>

  <p>Not far behind Pascal, there were ten warriors who were patiently watching the battle. However, they had never expected to get involved in it. By the time the black ring appeared, it was too late for them to escape!</p>

  <p>As soon as the ring touched the ground, it transformed into a ball and trapped everyone within.</p>

  <p>"I'll kill all of you this time," Pascal said coldly.</p>

  <p>"Pascal! I'm part of the alliance of powerful clans. Why are you getting me involved in this?" shouted a Demi-holy Being.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>One of them used a theurgy to try to break the ball, but their strength was not on the same level as Pascal's. Even if they tried their best, it would still be impossible for them to break the ball.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell, all of you!" With a murderous look in his eyes, Pascal pinched lightly with his right hand. When the black energy spread within the ball, everyone would be annihilated, including Zheng.</p>

  <p>Samuel was actually not a hardhearted man.</p>

  <p>He had felt uneasy and ashamed after hearing the news that Liusu and Aleyna had recovered their memories. Even if he was powerful and ambitious, he didn't know how to face his children in this situation.</p>

  <p>As a result, even though Liusu and Aleyna had recovered to their normal status, his resentment against Zheng was still growing!</p>

  <p>At this moment, a brown sword radiance suddenly came out and hit the inner wall of the ball. Then the long sword in Zheng's hand broke into pieces and scattered on the ground.</p>

  <p>Ever since his Shadow Bearing Sword was swallowed, Zheng hadn't found a long sword that he could use.</p>

  <p>Ordinary supreme primordial weapons couldn't bear the Ways-blending Energy at all. Thus, when he had tried to launch a strike with this long sword, its blade had immediately shattered.</p>

  <p>Zheng's sword radiance had merged more than 2, 500 Godly Ways, and this was the first time he had tried to use it against an enemy.</p>
