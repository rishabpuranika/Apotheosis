<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng had no interest in hunting down and killing the member of the Sea Dragon race, as the Chaotic Source Spirit was his real goal.</p>

  <p>If the members of the Sea Dragon race yielded and gave him what he wanted, Zheng wouldn't have to kill them.</p>

  <p>Just as he rushed toward the space ring, the black smog started stirring from above him again.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>The strong hurricane came.</p>

  <p>Zheng's face fell when he felt the great gust of wind.</p>

  <p>If the hurricane reached him, he knew it would send him far away. By then, he wouldn't be able to find the ring easily again.</p>

  <p>And so with even more determination, he pounced on the ring.</p>

  <p>It was much lighter than Zheng. As the hurricane blew, the ring rose into the air.</p>

  <p>The moment Zheng landed, he leaped into the air, tailing the space ring closely.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>With his right hand, he grabbed the ring at lightning speed.</p>

  <p>"Well, that was close..."</p>

  <p>He sighed in relief.</p>

  <p>As he knew he had to hunt for more than one Chaotic Source Spirit, he needed to know about them as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>With the hurricane whirling, he was sent tens of thousands of miles away.</p>

  <p>Before the gate of the Chaotic Source World, many creatures of the large races continued entering one after another.</p>

  <p>The moment Dorothy entered the Chaotic Source World, she couldn't avoid the hurricane. It lifted her up a few hundred feet high, carrying her further into the black smog.</p>

  <p>Without the Other Shore Power, she couldn't move.</p>

  <p>In a panic, she checked on Zheng's soul mark, only to find that he was also moving forward, carried along by the hurricane.</p>

  <p>She figured he was also just as stuck as she was.</p>

  <p>But why in the world was there even such a strong hurricane in the Chaotic Source World?</p>

  <p>No such thing was recorded in the classics.</p>

  <p>But it wasn't the time to be thinking about that. First, she had to find Zheng.</p>

  <p>Having entered the Chaotic Source World ahead of Zheng, Elvinia was extremely morose at this point.</p>

  <p>While she had originally planned to wait for him, the hurricane blew her away out of nowhere.</p>

  <p>Even when it stopped, she didn't get lucky. Instead, she encountered several members of the Sun Crow race, two of which were demon women born in the Divine Lair.</p>

  <p>Because of Elizabeth's influence and support, the members of the Sun Crow race regarded Elvinia as a traitor.</p>

  <p>After getting herself out of the Dark Region, Elvinia had shown up with a physical body before the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race.</p>

  <p>While the races were confused by her appearance, they also intended to kill her. The members of the Sun Crow race encountered Elvinia the moment they entered, so they, of course, had no intention of letting her get away.</p>

  <p>So long as they got rid of her, they knew they would get preferential treatment.</p>

  <p>The two demon women along with the other three members of the Sun Crow race were also the top warriors of the Sun Crow race's younger generation.</p>

  <p>Elvinia was strong enough to protect herself if at most two of them attacked her. But now, she had no choice but to run for her life— five of them had joined hands to corner her.</p>

  <p>At this point, the only good thing Elvinia had on her hands was how she had already mastered the divine flames of the Sun Crow race. Her divine flames were purer than most.</p>

  <p>But now, she had a few deep scratches on her back and arms as she was being chased.</p>

  <p>When she was nearly besieged, a hurricane blew once again, bailing her out of the situation. Everyone was blown away in different directions.</p>

  <p>She tried to check Zheng's soul mark, only to find that he was even farther away from her. How could she get back on track?</p>

  <p>"Number 45, 044..." the woman standing before the stone door called out.</p>

  <p>An eight-foot-tall man from the Bearing race stepped forward.</p>

  <p>He was none other than Garrett Ji.</p>

  <p>In the Bearing race, the Ji Clan enjoyed the highest status, and Garrett Ji was its direct descendant.</p>

  <p>As he moved across the open area, he heard a strange laugh from his side.</p>

  <p>He turned to the source of the laughter to find that it was from the arrogant Soul Devouring Demon.</p>

  <p>The sight made him cast a scornful glare at the human.</p>

  <p>He thought that the arrogant ones were always killed off easily. If the Soul Devouring Demon chose to keep silent and keep his recklessness in check, he might be able to reach the Chaotic Source Realm. But as soon as he appeared, he dared to expose his identity, leaving himself vulnerable to the other large races. It wasn't likely he would make it out of the Chaotic Source World alive.</p>

  <p>"What are you laughing at?" Garrett Ji demanded coldly.</p>

  <p>The Evil God raised a petal and flipped it over. His number read 45, 045, just behind Garrett's.</p>

  <p>The latter's expression seemed to change when he saw the number.</p>

  <p>While he didn't exactly know what the Evil God meant, he knew that the guy was crazy enough to do anything.</p>

  <p>Garrett's chest clenched slightly in uneasiness, but he ignored the Evil God and continued his stride to the stone door.</p>

  <p>The leaders of the Bearing race were left upset as well. During their trip to the Chaotic Source World, they had to give priority to protecting the disciples surnamed Ji. Garrett Ji, most especially, held a very high position among the descendants. Being targeted by the Soul Devouring Demon was too much of a bad omen.</p>

  <p>After Garrett Ji entered the Chaotic Source World, the woman from the Snake Goddess race announced the next number.</p>

  <p>Without a word, the Evil God stood up and took unrushed steps toward the stone door.</p>

  <p>Garrett Ji wasn't actually particularly afraid of the Evil God. While the Evil God's Soul of Light was indeed very powerful, Garrett Ji had with him several body protection weapons— he was well-equipped entering the Chaotic Source World. He even carried a secret soul weapon that could protect his Soul of Light.</p>

  <p>And Garrett's Other Shore Token was not weak by any means.</p>

  <p>His goal was to reach the Chaotic Source Realm as soon as possible, and he wasn't willing to get targeted by a madman in the process.</p>

  <p>So once he stepped through the stone door, he flew away without any hesitation.</p>

  <p>But the black smog was pervasive in the Chaotic Source World— Garrett Ji was slowed down. After reaching a certain distance, he turned his head to find the Evil God's figure at the gate.</p>

  <p>'Is he planning to follow me?' The thought made Garrett's brows shoot up in shock.</p>

  <p>He had no enmity with the Evil God, so he figured the latter wouldn't bother getting involved with him.</p>

  <p>But as it turned out, he was wrong.</p>

  <p>There were people in the world who simply enjoyed killing others.</p>

  <p>After staying in the Black Mountain Guild for a long time, the Evil God was rather tired of killing.</p>

  <p>When he stayed in Zheng's inner world, the Evil God rarely killed because the warriors of the entire inner world were not that powerful— they didn't even deserve to receive his attacks. The Evil God felt no desire to spar with them.</p>

  <p>And of course, there was the fact that he would have faced Zheng's punishment if he did kill others.</p>

  <p>Back on the Black Ship, Shera told the Evil God that he couldn't take anyone so lightly. The creatures who entered the Chaotic Source World were easily the most outstanding beings of the young generation in the entire Source World.</p>

  <p>Instead of feeling the pressure of having to face them, the Evil God felt excitement build up inside him at the thought.</p>

  <p>To him, it was a feast of killing people to his heart's content.</p>

  <p>So as soon as he appeared, he didn't hesitate to grab people's attention by revealing his identity as the Soul Devouring Demon.</p>

  <p>The eyes of hatred on him were intoxicating to him, like inhaling fine wine.</p>

  <p>After discovering Zheng, he was nothing but more excited. He didn't dream of stopping until he was hit by Fuxi.</p>
