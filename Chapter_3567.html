<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The rightmost cultivation room of the second floor belonged to Rocco.</p>

  <p>Everyone knew that disturbing another's cultivation in seclusion was prohibited. However, in the Land of Sword Grief, the right of challenge could be exercised on the first day of each month.</p>

  <p>And unless the person being challenged was stranded on the Other Shore, they had no choice but to take up the challenge.</p>

  <p>Rocco had just returned from the Other Shore several days ago, where he had found clues about a temple. Based on his findings, he was very likely to discover a temple that had been hidden for a long time.</p>

  <p>Today, he sorted out all the clues he'd gathered and planned to go out.</p>

  <p>However, he had to decipher three Sanskrit words among the clues before moving forward.</p>

  <p>Aside from Eastern Emperor Taiyi, there were a few others who could decipher Sanskrit words in the Taiyi Heaven Palace. But he knew that if he sought out help from these people, he would have to shell out too much.</p>

  <p>Plus, it might take a while for them to decipher the words, but he did not have any time to waste.</p>

  <p>Even so, Rocco didn't have many choices. He considered even consulting the people by Clear Lake who could also decipher Sanskrit words, but he learned that they worked even slower than those in the Taiyi Heaven Palace to begin with.</p>

  <p>"Tap-tap..."</p>

  <p>Just then, someone knocked on the door.</p>

  <p>The sound of the knock brought him an overwhelming sensation of annoyance.</p>

  <p>It reminded him that today was the first day of the month, meaning that it was the challenge day in the Land of Sword Grief.</p>

  <p>All the disciples on the second floor wanted Rocco to be pulled down from his position. Over the years, he had been challenged many times, but people had always failed to knock him down.</p>

  <p>Around four months ago, Rocco grew tired of the endless challenges that he injured one challenger badly. As a result, the other disciples grew afraid and stopped challenging him.</p>

  <p>After that fight, Rocco had lived a peaceful life. Having grown used to the silence, he did not expect to be challenged so soon.</p>

  <p>'Maybe I did not injure the last guy enough, ' he thought.</p>

  <p>Rocco opened the door to see a man standing before him. The man was ranked 168th on the second floor.</p>

  <p>"You? You dare to challenge me?" Rocco questioned the man, his face stiff and cold.</p>

  <p>The man smiled awkwardly and said, "I wouldn't dare."</p>

  <p>Only a handful of people on the second floor dare challenge Rocco, and obviously, this man was not one of them.</p>

  <p>"Then who is it?" Rocco asked again.</p>

  <p>"The challenger's name is  Luo Zheng Luo," the man replied in a flustered manner.</p>

  <p>"He's already standing in the arena."</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng Luo? His name does not ring a bell." Rocco shook his head, surprised to hear Luo Zheng's name.</p>

  <p>He had been isolated in his secluded cultivation room for so long that he had no clue about the recent happenings in the Land of Sword Grief.</p>

  <p>The name was not familiar at all. Rocco doubted if Luo Zheng was on the second floor.</p>

  <p>The confusion across Rocco's face sent the other man laughing. "That guy is the number one disciple on the first floor," he chucked. "He hasn't even stepped foot onto the second floor yet."</p>

  <p>Hearing that the number one disciple on the first floor had challenged him confused him. Rocco was the number one disciple of the second floor, and Luo Zheng had no idea what was coming to him.</p>

  <p>Rocco's face grew stiff again, with a hint of a smirk.</p>

  <p>The second floor's top ten disciples had to think twice before challenging Rocco, so who did this "Luo Zheng" guy think he was? Did he want to get injured?</p>

  <p>Did he want to die?</p>

  <p>As he walked out of the cultivation room with the man beside him, he couldn't help but ask, "Does this guy know what he signed up for?"</p>

  <p>He then caught a glimpse of the arena from a window on the second floor.</p>

  <p>In the arena, a man stood with his hands behind him. He looked intently at the second floor with bright eyes and a confident stature.</p>

  <p>This was Luo Zheng, waiting patiently for his opponent to arrive.</p>

  <p>When people saw Rocco beside the window, an uproar in the arena suddenly burst.</p>

  <p>"Rocco has come out!"</p>

  <p>"It seems he'll accept the challenge!"</p>

  <p>"I'd like to see if Luo Zheng will create one more miracle this time..."</p>

  <p>The crowd was jeering, with people hoping for Luo Zheng to win, despite their belief that he could never beat Rocco.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had made a miracle before, but asking for another one seemed nearly impossible at this point.</p>

  <p>The disciples on the second floor, including Yusuf and Ronnie, also fixed their eyes on Rocco. All they could think of was how Rocco would react to this challenger.</p>

  <p>Everyone knew that Rocco was in no mood for a challenge. However, because Luo Zheng was the number one disciple on the first floor, he had the right to challenge Rocco, while Rocco had no right to refuse.</p>

  <p>"I heard that you want to challenge me?" Rocco shouted towards the arena,</p>

  <p>"How dare you?!"</p>

  <p>He stared at Luo Zheng coldly, as if his gaze alone would make him retreat.</p>

  <p>It was like a giant looking down at an ant.</p>

  <p>It was obvious that Rocco had no idea who Luo Zheng was, nor the battles he had won before. If he did, he probably would have watched his tongue.</p>

  <p>All he knew was that Luo Zheng was a new, prominent disciple on the first floor who had grown so proud. So proud that he wanted to challenge the number one disciple on the second floor.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng cocked his head towards Rocco's direction and stared back. "This is my right, one that every disciple in the Land of Sword Grief is granted." He spoke with a sudden calmness.</p>

  <p>"Is that so?"</p>

  <p>Rocco stepped out of the window.</p>

  <p>Every time he took a step forward, fist-sized blocks hovered beneath his feet, catching them. They formed stairs for him to walk safely to the arena.</p>

  <p>This was a token of the Truth of Void Destruction.</p>

  <p>Eventually, he made it down safely from the second floor and onto the arena. "I don't have time to play games with you," he said. "I know you have the right to challenge me, but you should just give up now while you have the chance. There are many others who are on your level."</p>

  <p>Rocco pointed to the second floor.</p>

  <p>At this point, disciples on the second floor left their cultivation rooms and stood by the windows to get a glimpse of the fun.</p>

  <p>After spending so much time alone, Rocco was surprisingly patient.</p>

  <p>If this were happening four months ago, he wouldn't have even warned Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>But now that he had given Luo Zheng an opportunity to surrender, Rocco thought that Luo Zheng would have done it by now.</p>

  <p>To his surprise, Luo Zheng was unmoved by the gesture. "I'm not interested in you," Luo Zheng spat back. "The reason why I wanted to challenge you is because you hold first place on the second floor. I can't challenge the third floor unless I defeat you first. So, naturally, I have to get rid of you first." Luo Zheng spoke so confidently that it surprised people who didn't know him.</p>

  <p>However, those who did know him were not surprised at all. This was the typical Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>After all, Luo Zheng's performance had already surpassed Li Bianxue's. It was only a matter of time before he stepped onto the third floor.</p>

  <p>But still, those who had no idea who Luo Zheng was couldn't help but gasp.</p>

  <p>"What happened while I was cultivating in seclusion?" a random disciple whispered. "Where does this arrogant guy come from?"</p>
