<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2111 The Huge White Ape (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>With the enchanted barrier was removed, nothing could stop Master Evil and Big Mouth anymore. Danger still lurked in the Swirl Forest.</p>

  <p>However, as long as they did not seek their own deaths, it would not be too dangerous for them.</p>

  <p>"What else do you want?" Master Evil asked with a smile. Despite his current situation, arrogance was still in his tone.</p>

  <p>"You should remember that you promised to help me accomplish one task," said Luo Zheng with suspicious eyes.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng forced them to make the inner demon oath at that time because he wanted them to fight against the True Gods of the Murphy Universe.</p>

  <p>They were stronger than Blayd but weaker than the blue-clothed woman.</p>

  <p>In the end, they did not fight. However, the oath still applied.</p>

  <p>"Of course I remember." Master Evil let out a loud laugh. "If we meet in the divine land one day and you have any needs, I won't hesitate to help you. Tell me any desires you might have at that time."</p>

  <p>"Yeah. Don't worry about that. We won't forget." Wayne hurriedly nodded his head as well. It seemed that they would both honor their oaths.</p>

  <p>However, it wasn't their exact thought. At that moment, they could already leave the fairy palace. The divine land was so vast that it was very likely that they would never have the chance to see Luo Zheng again for the rest of their lives. They believed that they wouldn't have to keep their promises as long as Luo Zheng couldn't find them.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shrugged his shoulders and laughed. With a callous look he said,</p>

  <p>"Since you are so reasonable, I can be relieved."</p>

  <p>Master Evil and Wayne didn't hesitate any longer. They strode forth and headed straight for the entrance of the fairy palace. At last, they were finally able to leave the place where they were imprisoned for countless years.</p>

  <p>As he saw them leave, Zheng's eyes widened. Bewilderment enveloped Luo Zheng as he stared at their backs. "Why don't they fly?"</p>

  <p>Saul seemed to have already expected such a situation. He smiled slightly and answered diligently, "They can't fly here. If you don't believe me, why don't you try it?"</p>

  <p>Flight was a fairly easy thing to do in the universe. Most creatures with sufficient cultivation could hover through the air.</p>

  <p>After the warriors in the Lower World cultivated to the Illuminating Soul Realm, they would activate their life vitality to fuse with the wind and soar into the sky. Once they cultivated to higher levels, they would become even more powerful. They could travel through space, display the Grand Teleportation technique and take one step across millions of miles. Their mobility increased as their cultivation improved.</p>

  <p>However, they couldn't do such things easily in the divine land.</p>

  <p>After he heard Saul's words, Luo Zheng began to condense his chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>Intense focus accompanied his face as he willed himself to fly into the sky.</p>

  <p>However, the moment he condensed the Wind Law, the Law Power instantly collapsed. It was as if an invisible force had confined him to the spot.</p>

  <p>He had originally thought that he would float with the wind. Yet, he remained unmoved on the ground.</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>A hint of surprise flashed across his eyes. He extended his hand and waved it, intending to travel through space.</p>

  <p>However, just like last time, both the Wind Law and the Space Law were extinguished in a flash. It was as if there was some mysterious power that had extinguished the Law Power that Luo Zheng cultivated. The expression on Zheng's face was full of confusion.</p>

  <p>"It's useless," Saul said faintly with a regretful look. "The space in the divine land is very different from the space you know. In fact, the universes inhabited by secondary creatures, like yours, are just unreal spaces created by the Holy Beings. It's just like when people sleep, they tend to be omnipotent. As such, the universes are just products of the wills of Holy Beings. Only the divine land is the real world."</p>

  <p>When the Holy Beings built the universes, their imaginations fueled the creation. They did not impose any restrictions on any of the laws and made everyone able to control the laws.</p>

  <p>The universes that secondary creatures lived on were equivalent to the oceans, where all sorts of life forms could freely swim around. Each of them had the liberty to do whatever they wanted as long as they had power. Even a newly born fish could float in the water while asleep.</p>

  <p>However, at his current location, Luo Zheng was like a living being on land for the first time. When he tried to jump up, he found that he couldn't float as he did in the sea. Everything suddenly felt very restrictive.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng still had an unconvinced expression on his face. Additionally, he was still puzzled and his eyes reflected his perplexity. "But I've inherited the laws from the Holy Beings. Why don't they work here?"</p>

  <p>Both of the Supreme Lords and the world lords in the Evolutionary Universe had a deep comprehension of the laws. They were powerful enough to will the laws with a simple thought.</p>

  <p>Their comprehension came directly from the master of the Evolutionary Universe, Mike's comprehension of the laws. Since Mike could use the Law Power in the divine land, why couldn't the secondary creatures that obtained his inheritance use it?</p>

  <p>"They don't all lose their effectiveness," Saul said flatly. His face was calm with a hint of pity. "If you don't believe me, you can try condensing a flame."</p>

  <p>As he heard Saul's remark, Luo Zheng flicked his finger. Suddenly, a fireball shot out from his fingertip. It continuously rolled forward until it exploded about dozens of feet away.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>After the flame exploded, the intense fire turned Zheng's face bright red.</p>

  <p>He stared dumbfoundedly at the fire and muttered, "Does that mean that only the Wind Law and the Space Law are suppressed?"</p>

  <p>Normally, when martial artists flew through the air, they would use the Wind Law. Similarly, when they traveled through space, they would use the Space Law. Although these two kinds of Law Power weren't particularly mighty when used against an enemy, they were still indispensable to martial artists. Such mobility was necessary inside and outside of combat.</p>
