<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Neither of these two giants had a tangible body. In other words, they weren't perceptible by touch.</p>

  <p>The transparent giant summoned by Yao was nothing more than a ball of rolling energy waves. In the same sense, the figure standing behind Luo Luo Zheng was equally a sphere of floating energy.</p>

  <p>For now, the two giants seemed to have stopped attacking each other for the time being. Instead, they stood rather motionlessly, facing each other in midair.</p>

  <p>The energy in the transparent giant's head suddenly began to fluctuate violently, forming a huge gap in space. The gap warped and turned into a huge terrifying mouth, from which a fierce wind blew abruptly.</p>

  <p>At first, the sound of the whistling wind was very sharp, but as the enormous mouth continued to change shapes, the intonation began to decrease.</p>

  <p>It took quite some time to adjust the sound volume but afterward, the constantly changing wind sound changed into a melody, and in the end, it actually transformed into a person's voice!</p>

  <p>"Mike! We meet again..."</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng watched the huge distorted mouth, a look of surprise appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>He knew that the transparent giant had no way of making any sound on its own and therefore, it had to influence the speed and angle of the airflow in order to produce any noise at all.</p>

  <p>Even though the wind sound was rather strange, other people could still hear the clear words, too.</p>

  <p>'Mike?' Luo Luo Zheng wondered silently to himself.</p>

  <p>He was of course astonished to have heard these words.</p>

  <p>The figure's silhouette behind him was none other than Mike, of course!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng couldn't help but glance at the figure behind him. He was just too curious.</p>

  <p>The figure was just a simple outline, which made it rather hard to see its appearance whatsoever. However, the Mu Ning exuding from this silhouette was extraordinary and powerful. Luo Luo Zheng felt mesmerized.</p>

  <p>The silhouette was silent for a moment before speaking, "Murphy, you personally took action, thus violating the rules of the Hall of Holy Beings!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng wasn't sure exactly where Mike's voice was coming from, but each and every word he spoke could be heard clearly. Obviously, he didn't need to speak by means of the airflow sound as the transparent giant did.</p>

  <p>As this familiar voice reached Luo Zheng's ears, a rush of alarm washed over him and his heart started pounding violently!</p>

  <p>When this had all begun, he wasn't sure exactly whom the figure's outline belonged to.</p>

  <p>Now though, and more so after hearing Mike's all familiar voice, he no longer had any doubt.</p>

  <p>A trace of warmth flowed through his heart as he thought back to the figure's silhouette that had helped him cross through the Luck-devouring Snake Tribulation. As it turned out, his father had always been standing right behind him, but he had just never realized it before.</p>

  <p>"Ha! Ha!"</p>

  <p>As a gust of wind surged out from the transparent giant's mouth, it let out a strange, chilling laugh at the same time.</p>

  <p>"So what? The current Hall of Holy Beings is not what it used to be anymore. Anyway, I have only sent a single strand of my soul into the Evolutionary Universe. I believe that the Hall of Holy Beings won't even blame me for this, and there is no need to go against me for the sake of a late Holy Being."</p>

  <p>The transparent giant gradually became familiar with the airflow speed, now capable of uttering words more clearly and fluently.</p>

  <p>"I'm not dead yet," Mike spoke again.</p>

  <p>"You aren't any different than a dead Holy Being! Who the hell cares if you rely on this round of universe to keep your holy heart? Sooner or later, it will still be destroyed by my own two hands! Ha! Ha!" Upon speaking these words, the transparent giant figure finished with a wild, cold laugh once again.</p>

  <p>"No, I still have hope," said Mike. The silhouette of the figure's head lowered, and it appeared as though two invisible eyes were staring directly at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Hooo... Hooo... Hooo..."</p>

  <p>The transparent figure seated not too far away pointed a slender finger at Luo Luo Zheng. "Are you talking about this little guy? That's your hope? Please tell me you're kidding!"</p>

  <p>Mike's silhouette stayed silent for a moment and then answered affirmatively and with confidence, "Yes, my son, Luo Luo Zheng, is my hope!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had already learned all about Mike's attitude from Holy Jay. The ten Godly Geniuses were both Mike's last struggle and hope, and Mike had placed great expectations on Luo Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>"What a mistake you have made, placing all your hope on a simple secondary creature. Mike, you're still just as childish as ever..." the translucent figure said.</p>

  <p>At these words, Luo Luo Zheng raised his eyebrows and glared at the transparent figure. "Murphy!" he then roared as loud as he possible could. "I know I will step into the divine land one day. You can trust that I'll happily cut your head off in front of the Hall of Holy Beings!"</p>

  <p>Today, Luo Luo Zheng was no longer completely ignorant of the divine land. He had learned so much over time.</p>

  <p>In fact, Luo Luo Zheng was currently using the chaotic energy in order to increase his personal voice volume. As a result, his voice was extremely loud and was filled with a sharp Mu Ning!</p>

  <p>This was Luo Zheng's utmost determination, and was something he had to face throughout his entire life. No matter how weak he was now, he had no way to escape. There was no longer any room for retreat.</p>

  <p>The figure's silhouette behind Luo Luo Zheng remained silent.</p>

  <p>The transparent figure, which was formed by Murphy's energy soul, also kept silent for a short while before chuckling aloud. "Brat, you don't seem to know what the divine land is, nor what kind of place the Hall of Holy Beings can be. Clearly, you don't have any idea who you're even talking to!"</p>

  <p>"You're just a mere Holy Being," Luo Luo Zheng said calmly and nonchalantly.</p>

  <p>"A mere Holy Being..." he repeated.</p>

  <p>And at that, the transparent figure actually waved a pair of transparent hands and clapped.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>With every clap of its hands, a dull and intense sound spread out and stung his ears. The entire space trembled, the earth shook, and more and more cracks appeared in the Rosy Cloud World. It was as though the clapping was going to cause some kind of landslide.</p>

  <p>At the same time, many members of the Demon Night in the Rosy Cloud World were desperately pouring into the space tunnel. They could see that the Rosy Cloud World was on the verge of collapsing. In fact, most were sure it would collapse at any given moment.</p>

  <p>"You may have guts. However, you're nothing but a young warrior without powerful strength! Sure, you're protected by your beloved father in the Evolutionary Universe. You're the son of the universe, and this place is your garden. Your every move, every word, every action, and every enemy are all under your father's control. There is no such thing as luck in the divine land, and there is also no such things as fortuitous encounters and coincidences waiting for you at every turn in the divine land. The divine land is a real and cruel world. Only then, will you ever understand that what you've just said should make you feel ashamed!</p>

  <p>Did you know all of that? Huh?"</p>

  <p>Murphy, after all, was a Holy Being, too. Since a Holy Being owned an entire world, it was only natural that he had a lot of confidence. Facing Luo Zheng's rude remarks, Murphy didn't get angry, but instead, he analyzed the matter from Luo Zheng's point of view.</p>

  <p>This analysis, though, allowed Luo Luo Zheng to become more certain of something in particular.</p>

  <p>As for the luck Murphy talked about...</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had always believed that his luck was great. He also knew that for a martial artist to advance, they would need considerable effort, luck, and talent.</p>

  <p>However, thanks to Tianming's reminder, Luo Luo Zheng found out that these fortuitous encounters were not due to luck at all. In fact, the various mysteries beneath the heavens were all deliberately arranged by someone. Besides, someone had arranged the path of martial arts for him ahead of time, too.</p>

  <p>These difficulties and impossible situations were all deliberate, and the purpose was to temper and test Luo Zheng's state of mind.</p>

  <p>All sorts of training methods were used in an attempt to urge Luo Luo Zheng on to hard work, in order to push him toward reaching the next level as quickly as possible.</p>

  <p>There was only one person in the entire universe that possessed such a supernatural ability and could use all the resources in the universe to perform such a play. This person, of course, was no other than Mike, the owner of the Evolutionary Universe!</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng had first discovered the truth, he was rather disappointed, and felt a little sad.</p>

  <p>Throughout his entire life, he was led to believe that everything he had obtained was through hard work, only to find out that the whole was arranged by his father!</p>

  <p>Once Luo Luo Zheng was informed about what had happened to his father and his enemies in the divine land through Holy Jay, he managed to keep his calm. He didn't have the time or the right to argue with such things.</p>

  <p>Moreover, all the arrangements in the Evolutionary Universe contained his father's painstaking efforts!</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, trust me. Murphy is only trying to strike a blow to your warrior spirit. In this world..." Mike suddenly said to Luo Luo Zheng. He was worried that there was something wrong with Luo Zheng's state of mind, even though Murphy was really telling the truth!</p>

  <p>"I know," Luo Luo Zheng replied calmly, with an even more determined expression in his eyes now. They shone like stars in the midnight sky. "Murphy, even if that's true, I still want to behead you in front of the Hall of Holy Beings. No matter what you say today, to me, you're still nothing but a mere Holy Being!"</p>

  <p>Mike's silhouette nodded once Luo Luo Zheng finished speaking. Mike was satisfied with Luo Zheng's reaction. Murphy had said those words just to get under Luo Zheng's skin, to deter his state of mind, but what he said was the truth. Mike could control everything in the Evolutionary Universe. When Luo Luo Zheng had encountered any desperate situation in the past, Mike had helped him every single time.</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng left this place, he would also leave Mike's protection. And by then, he'd be facing situations that were thousands of times more dangerous than what he was facing right now. Sooner or later, he would have to face such situation on his own.</p>

  <p>"Little brat!" Murphy only wanted Luo Luo Zheng to fully comprehend the genuine situation. He didn't expect Luo Luo Zheng to be more stubborn than Mike, despite having said so much in an attempt to persuade him. Murphy on the other hand, even with his stable state of mind, also became furious.</p>
