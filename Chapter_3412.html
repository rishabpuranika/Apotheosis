<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>After the giant eye released blood lines that enveloped everyone who was present, it released a message through its consciousness.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you take action?" the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits roared angrily after receiving the message.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the other huge Chaotic Source Spirits that had been staying on the main peak leapt up and flew towards all the warriors.</p>

  <p>Although many races had temporarily allied themselves with other races, no one wanted to sacrifice themselves. That was why they all retreated to the edge of the blood lines.</p>

  <p>The only thing was that the area that the blood lines covered had the radius of only a hundred thousand feet. With the Chaotic Source Spirits moving at such a high speed, they could surely arrive in just a blink of an eye!</p>

  <p>At that point, Hamzah shouted, "The members of the Separate Abyss race!</p>

  <p>Listen to me!"</p>

  <p>He knew that things wouldn't end well for them if they retreated constantly.</p>

  <p>Right now, what they could do was to fight those powerful Chaotic Source Spirits to the end.</p>

  <p>Under Hamzah's command, all the members of the Separate Abyss race took out their Other Shore Tokens and pulled out their weapons. The Chaotic Source Spirits were flying fast, and they would come any minute now.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>Two Separate Abyss men pulled out their huge hammers. One of them jumped up while the other lay prone on the ground.</p>

  <p>Two strange cones floated above their heads. The cones were a pair that were used together. Once the two Separate Abyss men carried the cones simultaneously and cooperated with each other, the cones increased the Other Shore Power they released by multiple times.</p>

  <p>"Swoosh! Swoosh!"</p>

  <p>Both sides were formidable opponents. The blood red Chaotic Source Spirit in front of them had a very large size, while the two members of the Separate Abyss race were also tall and strong.</p>

  <p>The two big hammers launched an attack together and unleashed an unimaginable amount of power!</p>

  <p>Just as the two men from the Separate Abyss race were about to hit the Chaotic Source Spirit, a red light from somewhere not too far away shot towards them and hit their heads.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>At that moment, the two men began feel afraid. Their faces paled and their hearts pounded erratically in their chests.</p>

  <p>"Quack!"</p>

  <p>As the two of them were trapped by the power of fear, the Chaotic Source Spirit opened its bloody mouth wide.</p>

  <p>"Crack! Crack!"</p>

  <p>It all happened so fast that there was only a mere snapping sound, and the heads of the two men were gone.</p>

  <p>"No!" Hamzah screamed.</p>

  <p>He quickly ran towards them to help his companions, but it was obviously too late for him to do that now.</p>

  <p>In a fit of rage, he activated his power. His skin turned red, as if numerous parasites had bitten him. Then, he poured his majestic power into the body of the Chaotic Source Spirit.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The Chaotic Source Spirit took Hamzah's heavy blow. It was immediately smashed into the ground and left a crater with a diameter of over three hundred feet in its wake.</p>

  <p>The mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits had cultivated all those Chaotic Source Spirits. Generally speaking, they were formed after the Chaotic Source Spirits devoured each other. Naturally, the Chaotic Source Spirits that were eaten supported the bodies of their hosts. It was the reason that the Chaotic Source Spirit was unharmed despite Hamzah's fatal attack!</p>

  <p>Such a thing didn't just happen to Hamzah.</p>

  <p>The members of the Sun Crow race, the Bearing race, and the Celestial Wolf race also encountered the same situation.</p>

  <p>Since numerous members from many races were gathered together, they could possibly resist one or two Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>Yet every time they fought, there would always be a few rays of red light that would flash at them.</p>

  <p>It was safe to say that to be affected by such a strong power of fear in times of crisis proved to be fatal.</p>

  <p>Many members from various bigger races had lost their lives in an instant.</p>

  <p>Even though it was hard to guard oneself against the power of fear, there was still a way to deal with it.</p>

  <p>"Ding, ding, ding..."</p>

  <p>Milo, who was wrapped in a coir raincoat and carried an invisible long sword in his hand, flew around a Chaotic Source Spirit. He looked like a graceful butterfly.</p>

  <p>His long sword turned into the dense sword rain and poured onto the Chaotic Source Spirit's body.</p>

  <p>In order to kill the Chaotic Source Spirit, one had to let it bear excessive power and exhaust it until it was extremely fatigued.</p>

  <p>So, Milo did that just to consume the Chaotic Source Spirit's strength.</p>

  <p>"Watch out, Milo!" one of the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace shouted.</p>

  <p>At that exact same moment, a ray of red light was shot towards Milo.</p>

  <p>The Chaotic Source Spirit that Milo had been attacking bared its fangs when it saw the red light. It intended to swallow Milo as soon as his mind wasn't functioning well.</p>

  <p>As the red light was about to hit Milo, his eyes got glassy and dull, and he lost his consciousness completely.</p>

  <p>In this state, the power of fear clearly couldn't affect him at all.</p>

  <p>Losing one's consciousness was equivalent to surrendering their life to their opponent.</p>

  <p>When Milo's consciousness disappeared, however, he became more agile.</p>

  <p>He easily avoided all of the Chaotic Source Spirit's attacks and at the same time, he launched an even fiercer assault against the Chaotic Source Spirit again.</p>

  <p>Like Milo, Chaim was able to avoid the power of fear as well.</p>

  <p>It had been a long time since he had last used the Living Puppet Chains.</p>

  <p>Now, it was time to let the Living Puppet Chains pierce his body once more.</p>

  <p>Naturally, Chaim became just like a puppet. It meant that even though he was hit by the power of fear, it wouldn't cause that much damage to him.</p>

  <p>The power of fear that the huge eye released was limited. Without the arrangements that were made in the main peak, its ability would be far weaker.</p>

  <p>Some members of other races had come up with the effective methods after they suffered losses.</p>

  <p>More than ten warriors had died in the beginning, but after they employed such methods, no one was killed since then. All the races did their best to fight with the blood red Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>"Cluck..."</p>

  <p>Eventually, the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits began to get restless.</p>

  <p>She had painstakingly cultivated the Chaotic Source Spirits for a long time.</p>

  <p>They might be able to hold on for a bit more for now, but they would be defeated sooner or later.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the mother stepped on the main peak, and then her tall and looming figure jumped upwards.</p>

  <p>Her huge body flew in the air like a large mountain, and then shot towards the members of the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>"Chaim, Milo! Dodge!" Dorothy warned, her face drained of color at the surprise attack.</p>

  <p>The members from different races were trapped in a radius of a hundred thousand feet, and the mother of Chaotic Source Spirits was about ten thousand feet tall.</p>

  <p>Due to her massive size, she only leapt for a short distance to cover a large area.</p>

  <p>Despite Milo and Chaim not being under control, they still fought and maintained their presence of mind. Thus, they were able to dodge on instinct and escaped along the wind when danger came.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>As a result, the mother fell down and left a crater that was one thousand feet wide.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, the huge, ten thousand-foot-tall mother kept moving and attacking within the limited area. Everyone began to feel anxious and stressed.</p>

  <p>The warriors who were in fierce battles with the other Chaotic Source Spirits ran away when the attacks were near.</p>

  <p>Still, the power of fear descended from time to time and trapped two or three men. Those unlucky warriors were either eaten or crushed by the mother.</p>

  <p>Some members of the Oneness Sky Palace, the Snake Goddess race, the Ear Mouse race, the Bearing race, and even the Sun Crow race got attacked as well. Within less than thirty seconds, about thirty warriors had died.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the giant eye was still floating in the sky. It kept on accumulating the red light and releasing it from its pupil.</p>

  <p>If the huge eye continued its strikes at such a speed, then it and the mother would be able to kill everyone without much effort.</p>

  <p>Of course, they would not kill those most important people.</p>

  <p>Just then, the giant eye suddenly sensed two puffs of aura that came from behind it.</p>

  <p>With a slight roll, its pupil had moved to the back and was greeted with the sight of Zheng and Yan.</p>

  <p>"How dare you attack me?!" the giant eye shrieked. It began to release its power of fear, but then a cyan silk cloth appeared in Yan's hand.</p>

  <p>The silk cloth looked very exquisite, and had strange patterns on its surface.</p>

  <p>As soon as the huge eye released the red light, Yan lightly shook the silk cloth.</p>

  <p>The cloth deftly wiped away the power of fear that was shot towards them.</p>

  <p>The members of the Pear Hill were already aware of the Dreaded Eye Demon's existence before, so they naturally gave the countermeasure to Yan. It was just that it was not appropriate for her to show this item before, so she only brought it out now.</p>
