<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The two brothers? Mercer and Miller, were determined in following Zheng.</p>

  <p>Now that the situation became worse, they believed that it was better to pin all their hopes on these two human beings than do nothing. Perhaps, they could really create a miracle.</p>

  <p>Luckily for Zheng, he had the Shape-shifting Spirit's guidance, so he didn't really need the help of the Insect Master race that much.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, the Insect Masters were more familiar with the Dark Region than he and Feng Ge were, so it actually wasn't bad that the two tagged along with them.</p>

  <p>After a while of thought, Zheng nodded and said, "It's a pity that Feng Ge acted too ruthlessly just now, that none of the horses was left."</p>

  <p>"Those Demonic Blood Horses were the Royal Monkeys' exclusive mounts.</p>

  <p>Even if they were still alive, they wouldn't let us ride them anyway," said the old insect raiser as he climbed up the col. Then, he took out a small bamboo flute and handed it to Mercer.</p>

  <p>In turn, Mercer placed the bamboo flute's mouthpiece by his lips, then gently played it. Soon enough, several black beetles emerged from the cave below the col.</p>

  <p>"Those are... Holy Beetles!" The moment Mercer saw the beetles, he got a little too excited.</p>

  <p>The Insect Master race raised all kinds of insects, snakes, and ants, and among all of them, the Holy Beetles were the most difficult to tame.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, juniors like Mercer didn't have the chance to control the Holy Beetles.</p>

  <p>"Our benefactors can ride these Holy Beetles. Mercer and Miller, you two should take good care of them," the old insect raiser ordered.</p>

  <p>Zheng could fly even in the Dark Region, but the process was somewhat troublesome.</p>

  <p>That was because the Godly Way energy was in conflict with the Dark Region. If he condensed the Thunder Materialization, the darkness would probably damage his pair of thunder wings in an instant.</p>

  <p>But since the Insect Master race just gave them the flying mounts, he didn't refuse the kindness.</p>

  <p>In a few moments, Zheng, Feng Ge, Miller, and Mercer each took a Holy Beetle to mount and rode on them. Then, Mercer played the bamboo flute gently, and the Holy Beetles carried them into the dark sky.</p>

  <p>As the Holy Beetles flew up to a higher altitude, the visibility in the Dark Region became less clear. The originally dim ground quickly became blurry.</p>

  <p>The dark sky was like an endless black hole. When Zheng raised his head, he could faintly feel the pressure that the darkness emitted. It felt as if something was spying on him from the endless void.</p>

  <p>"Has your Insect Master race ever explored the sky above the Dark Region?" Zheng asked curiously. "I haven't seen it before," Mercer answered honestly.</p>

  <p>"But according to the records of our Insect Master race, our great ancestor once rode a Holy Beetle into the dark sky!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Did he find anything?" Zheng asked again. "No," Mercer said with a shake of his head.</p>

  <p>He continued, "Our great ancestor never came back. Although the other clansmen all say that he stays in the dark sky, I think he must have died there..."</p>

  <p>As a native race in the Dark Region, the Insect Master race had always sought survival in the conflicts between the large races. They were too weak.</p>

  <p>The great ancestor Mercer referred to was the greatest Insect Master, who had tamed a powerful insect and thus led the Insect Master race to a brilliant period of development. After the great ancestor had left, however, the remaining insect tamers still could not obtain a position in the Dark Region and therefore, the Insect Master race had declined even more over the years.</p>

  <p>"The dark sky..."</p>

  <p>According to Zheng's understanding of the Other Shore, the stages of the Other Shore were superimposed over one another. It was true since it could also be proved by the things he had seen when he left the Lust World.</p>

  <p>Yet, when Feng Ge had opened a crack in the sky, wouldn't it mean that there was a crack in Stage Fifteen of the Other Shore? Was Stage Fifteen of the Other Shore on the top of the so-called dark sky?</p>

  <p>It sounded unexplainable in a spatial sense.</p>

  <p>While Zheng was deep in his thoughts, the white light in Feng Ge's pupils glowed slightly. "Something is following us," she told Zheng in a low voice.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing her words, Zheng, Mercer, and Miller all turned their heads to look around, but they couldn't see anything in the darkness.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, they heard the sound of wings flapping, then several huge black shadows came down from above. They turned out to be giant birds, and each of them was about thousands of feet wide!</p>

  <p>"They are Ghost Wing Birds!" Mercer screamed in fright.</p>

  <p>As soon as he saw the huge black shadows above his head, his eyes instantly went wide open in horror and panic overtook him. Miller was no better, as he also went pale with fear like his brother.</p>

  <p>As one of the strongest creatures in Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore, the Ghost Wing Bird had almost no natural enemy.</p>

  <p>They flew high in the sky all year round and almost never descended. No one had ever even found a nest of the Ghost Wing Bird. Even a powerful force like the Royal Monkey race would die if they encountered the Ghost Wing Birds.</p>

  <p>Both Mercer and Miller had once seen the Ghost Wing birds glide in the sky back when they were in the col. At that time, all the Insect Masters held their breaths and didn't dare to do anything. They didn't move even after the Ghost Wing Birds captured a few of their clansmen, but simply watched them leave in silent distress.</p>

  <p>Still, that instance had deeply impressed Mercer and Miller.</p>

  <p>The two brothers never expected to encounter such powerful beings especially not shortly after they set out.</p>

  <p>"Lower the height," Zheng told Mercer.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Mercer was at a loss and didn't know what to do. When he heard Zheng's instruction, he tried his best to hold back his fear and played the bamboo flute in his hand. In turn, the Holy Beetles quickly descended.</p>

  <p>When the Ghost Wing Birds saw that Zheng and his companions go down from the sky, they immediately followed them closely.</p>

  <p>Their huge wings were like sails as they flapped continuously. As the Ghost Wing Birds got closer and closer, their appearance gradually became clear.</p>

  <p>Brown feathers covered their slender heads, and their eyes were slanted in shape. Overall, they looked rather terrifying.</p>

  <p>"Woosh? "</p>

  <p>The nearest Ghost Wing Bird stretched out its long and thin beak, then tried to grab Mercer with its mouth.</p>

  <p>Compared with the huge body of the Ghost Wing Bird, Mercer was as small as an ant.</p>

  <p>"Feng Ge, drive them away!" Zheng shouted.</p>

  <p>He knew that Feng Ge's Great Sanskrit Light was too blinding in the Dark Region. So, the reason why he had asked Mercer to lower their altitude was not because he wanted to escape, but because he wanted to assist Feng Ge in driving those birds away.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>As soon as Zheng finished speaking, Feng Ge raised her hand. Light swords, which extended up to a thousand feet upward, swiftly shot up into the air.</p>

  <p>"Puff, puff, puff..."</p>

  <p>Just like shabby canvases, the nearest Ghost Wing Bird's wings were mangled as the light swords instantly pierced through them and left numerous holes.</p>

  <p>Of course, Feng Ge still wasn't satisfied with the damage she had done. She gently flipped her palm, and the light swords dashed towards the junction between the wings and the torso of the Ghost Wing Bird. It was clear that she actually wanted to cut off the Ghost Wing Bird's wings.</p>

  <p>The Ghost Wing Bird felt the sharp stab of pain and desperately wanted to escape.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge's light swords, however, were too fast for it to dodge. The second the light swords moved, the Ghost Wing Bird's wings immediately fell off, and its enormous body fell heavily from the sky.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>When the other Ghost Wing Birds saw what had happened, they didn't dare to stay any longer. They were afraid that the blazing white light swords might also decapitate their wings, so they flew up and away, then disappeared into the darkness.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Mercer and Miller sat stiffly on the backs of the Holy Beetles, before they finally sighed in relief and wiped the sweat off their foreheads.</p>

  <p>They had thought that they would be doomed to death this time, but to their surprise, the human woman's white light swords had defeated the extremely powerful and influential Ghost Wing Birds of the Dark Region with ease.</p>

  <p>It almost seemed that these two humans were able to do whatever they wanted in the Dark Region.</p>
