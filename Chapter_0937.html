<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 937 The World Within The Mad Scorpion's Body</b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>



  <p>
</p>

  <p>Malcom and Esther had always been relying on their life vitality or forceful energy to be strong and powerful.</p>

  <p>Now that they had lost these things, their main bodies were only slightly stronger than ordinary creatures, so as they fell and hit other objects in the darkness, they became dizzy from the impact just like everyone else.</p>

  <p>And since the crab ornament on Luo Zheng's chest couldn't be nourished by his life vitality, the orange barrier of light around it had completely disappeared.</p>

  <p>Luckily, the Dark Nether Death Light that had shot out of the Mad Scorpion's head didn't reach them. Otherwise, everyone would have been killed instantly by the red light.</p>

  <p>The crowd could no longer hold onto Luo Zheng's body as they continued to roll down and scatter.</p>

  <p>The size of the inside of this gigantic beast far exceeded everyone's imagination.</p>

  <p>Since the Mad Scorpion lay at the edge of the abyss, no one knew the length of its body. Its huge body extended all the way to the darkness below, but the part of its body that everyone could see above the abyss was already indescribably huge, like the ominous tip of an iceberg.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was still fine. Although he had collided with something along the way, his body was more solid than everything else. The giant rock that had been sucked into the Mad Scorpion's stomach hit Luo Luo Zheng, but Luo Luo Zheng remained unharmed. In fact, the rock was smashed into a thousand pieces instead.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, everyone else was in danger. Since Esther, Fabian, and the others couldn't activate their life vitality, they didn't have anything to protect them. In this situation, even a small rock that was thrown at them could cause them to bleed.</p>

  <p>It was fortunate that the inner walls of the Mad Scorpion were soft.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, just bumping about along the inside of the Mad Scorpion's body would be enough to kill them.</p>

  <p>When they finally hit a surface, they crawled there in the darkness for over ten minutes. Esther let out a muffled sound and they all fell back and forth until they reached the bottom. After passing through the dark passage, they were surprised to discover that there was a magical light in the Mad Scorpion's stomach.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng was the only one who was in the mood to inspect their surroundings.</p>

  <p>Except for Luo Luo Zheng and Yolande, everyone was injured. Esther was the most severely injured one, with several wounds on her body and a portion of her clothes stained red with blood.</p>

  <p>Even Malcom and Rehaan, who were physically strong, were injured.</p>

  <p>Rehaan was practically limping as he crawled up from the ground, and Malcom's face was swollen to the point of looking comical.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Fabian and Jarrod looked fine and didn't seem to be seriously injured.</p>

  <p>Anyway, serious physical injuries were nothing to a warrior and were considered minor flesh wounds. All of them took out healing medicines and swallowed them.</p>

  <p>Then, they joined Luo Luo Zheng and Yolande in examining their surroundings.</p>

  <p>The environment inside the Mad Scorpion's stomach was far beyond Luo Zheng's expectations. It seemed as large and spacious as the Dark Nether Cave, but in the end, it was still a cave. If they flew upward, they would touch the wall of the cave.</p>

  <p>So even though the cave was huge, it seemed cramped and suffocating. The dusky, yellow environment constantly reminded the warriors that they were still in a cave. However, this cave was so large that it took up a considerable portion of the entire Sea God Continent.</p>

  <p>Of course, it was still smaller than the Dark Nether Cave. After all, the Mad Scorpion itself was just a part of the Dark Nether Cave.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, the cave seemed to be endless. Even the sky seemed blue.</p>

  <p>This was a completely different world! Moreover, they could see tall mountains, rivers, and plants. When they looked at this space from afar, it seemed no different from the boundless great worlds.</p>

  <p>"Why is there such a world inside the Mad Scorpion's belly?" Luo Luo Zheng asked in surprise.</p>

  <p>Yolande nodded. "Yes, this is the small world within the Mad Scorpion's belly."</p>

  <p>"It has a small world inside its body?" Luo Luo Zheng asked in astonishment. Luo Luo Zheng had been to the small world at the top of the Tower of Sin and discovered that he could freely create the environment inside it. In fact, there was a chance that the one hundred and twenty-eight small worlds there had been created by the original owner of the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Esther changed her clothes. After she took care of her wounds, she walked over and said, "It is said that after a warrior reaches the Soul Sea Realm, the life vitality within his body will turn into a sea shrouded in a hazy life vitality fog and will form a world. That is why it's called the Soul Sea Realm. But the body of the Soul Sea Realm warrior won't be able to create lands and creatures. It's only when a warrior reaches a higher level that he'll be able to create a world where creatures can be born and even cultivate..."</p>

  <p>Yolande nodded again. "Indeed. Some of the masters of the Upper World have small worlds in their bodies which contain their own kingdoms. There are tens of millions of living beings within them. There are even wars between those living beings."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was amazed by what he was hearing. A warrior's body could form a world? The creatures within that world could cultivate too?</p>

  <p>At the thought of this, Luo Luo Zheng suddenly had a flash of enlightenment. He thought of the entire universe and wondered whether the numerous great worlds were also inside the body of some living being. He immediately asked Yolande about this.</p>

  <p>Before Yolande could say anything, Xun appeared from within Luo Zheng's body. She smiled and replied, "No one can answer this question!"</p>

  <p>"Why?" Luo Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"We've been trying to figure out the answer to your question for millions of years, but no one has been able to solve it," Xun said, shaking her head.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded in understanding. If he'd been able to think about this matter, it went without saying that the supreme masters in the Upper World would have also thought about it. Some warriors had already guessed that after they reached the Soul Sea Realm, their bodies would be able to form their own Soul Sea, and that once their cultivation increased, their Soul Sea would slowly expand. Then, sky, earth, and even living beings would gradually appear inside it. In the same way, the whole universe might also be inside the body of some creature.</p>

  <p>It was a pity that no one in the Upper World could reach the exit of the universe even though countless warriors had explored it. Some warriors thought that it was a stupid hypothesis and that there was no exit to the universe.</p>

  <p>"That's not the matter we have to care about right now. Yolande, what should we do next?" Malcom asked with an unfriendly expression, striding over to Yolande.</p>

  <p>In this small world, life vitality and forceful energy were prohibited, so they all could only rely on their own physical body. The pair of black wings on Malcom's back had already disappeared. It was obvious that he was feeling defenseless and on edge.</p>

  <p>However, Yolande just ignored Malcom's words and coldly uttered, "Follow me."</p>

  <p>Malcom didn't have the patience to do so. He stretched out his large hands toward Yolande, but just as he reached out, Yolande, who was wearing a pair of clogs, shook her body and leaped onto Malcom's bulky arm.</p>

  <p>Taking two steps forward on his arm, she wrapped her arms around Malcom's forearm and fiercely pressed down on it, taking advantage of her full body weight.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Everyone heard the sound of a bone cracking. Malcom let out a miserable scream as his thick arm became limp and tilted to one side.</p>

  <p>Rehaan was startled. Just as he was about to charge over, Yolande jumped down from Malcom's arm. Her petite figure was in stark contrast to Malcom's massive body. She gave Rehaan a cold look and said, "If you want to leave this place and return to the tower alive, don't talk rubbish!"</p>

  <p>She had shocked everyone by breaking Malcom's arm with a mere twist.</p>

  <p>No matter how powerful she was, she was still a tenth-level war general.</p>

  <p>But now, she had broken Malcom's arm with just one strike.</p>

  <p>Yolande didn't care about the gazes of the surrounding warriors. She walked forward alone, while Malcom, dragging his broken arm, took out a pill from his pocket and swallowed it. Even if the healing medicine's effect was really good, it would still take a few days for his broken arm to be completely healed.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes lit up as a thought struck him.</p>

  <p>After entering the belly of the giant beast, no one could rely on their life vitality and forceful energy. In that case, only the lowest-level martial skills could truly work there.</p>

  <p>What Yolande had just used was contortion, the most common martial art of an ordinary warrior. Even if Yolande's strength was far inferior to Malcom's, she had been able to easily break Malcom's arm with her technique.</p>
