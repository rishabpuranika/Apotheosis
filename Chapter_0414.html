<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 414 A Murder Plan (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>After several dramatic turns took place between Luo Zheng and Vale, there were heated discussions among the crowd. At this point, they paid little attention to the other fights going on in the arena.</p>

  <p>As Vale and Luo Zheng damaged the arena during the battle, a team of craftsmen from the Cloud Sect transported huge stones to the area and used them to fill in the damage done to the battle grounds. Later on, the elders helped rearrange the array and enchanted barriers before a new round began.</p>

  <p>In this round, two personal disciples appeared on the stage but their opponents were all at the peak of the nature level. Their opponents had outstanding strength, based on the fact that they had come a long way before finally entering round robin. However, they were unlike Tianming who was extremely excellent, leaving them unlikely to make any surprise moves. As expected, the two personal disciples easily defeated them and won the victory.</p>

  <p>After that, the round robin proceeded normally. All the personal disciples, save for Vale, won the battles.</p>

  <p>The disciples from various peaks had also done an outstanding job this year. Jill, Tianming, and Wing all had winning streaks but their success came too easily as they didn't encounter any opponents stronger than them. That was why Sheeny from Skytop Peak failed when he battled against Willie Huo, a personal disciple.</p>

  <p>The fight between the top disciples and the personal disciples was the highlight of the All Peaks Competition and what the disciples most anticipated to see. Luo Zheng and Vale's battle was indeed a feast for their eyes.</p>

  <p>Features of the fight had many twists and turns, including thrilling moments when the audience was certain that one of them would be killed— these scenes lingered in their memories.</p>

  <p>In the corner of the area, Saint Viana sat on a cattail hassok, overlooking the entire arena and competition. As his eyes brushed past the large crowd, his eyes remained fixed on Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>His dry and stiff face, resembling pine bark, looked sullen.</p>

  <p>"The last three generations of Luo Clan are all very ordinary. The last generation only has one nature creature. But in this one two super talents popped up consecutively. Yan is extraordinary with her rare, special body. But I didn't expect Luo Zheng to appear. Not only does he have innate superhuman strength, but his corporal body is tremendously strong and tough, almost to an extent of an abnormality. Moreover, he mastered the cultivation method of the powerful Heavenly Ogre Fist!</p>

  <p>He may not be as gifted as Yan, but his strength in actual combat is even more terrifying than hers. I once offended him and punished Yan for a crime as well. Now, he certainly wouldn't cease his revenge. We'd better seize this chance when he hasn't yet fully grown into a master and knock him off his perch. This way we can avoid any future troubles." As he explained, Saint Viana was deep in thought.</p>

  <p>Sitting in another cattail hassock was Saint Zara who was in repose with his eyes closed. Upon hearing Saint Viana's words, he simply shook his head and said, "You once said that you have arranged a disciple to assassinate Luo Zheng in the All Peak Competition. I don't know who the assassinator is, but if he wants to kill Luo Zheng, he must have at least the ability to match him in battle. In my opinion, it's very difficult to find such a person."</p>

  <p>It was true that Saint Viana arranged an Illuminating Soul Realm disciple to assassinate Luo Zheng on the arena but the disciple wavered after he watched Luo Zheng defeated Dick.</p>

  <p>Even as the top Illuminating Soul Realm disciple in the peaks, the assassinator was still no match for Dick. If the Illuminating Soul Realm disciple couldn't even beat Dick then how was he supposed to beat Luo Zheng?</p>

  <p>If he couldn't beat Luo Zheng then it was impossible for him to kill Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng's true strength was revealed in the battle that made Saint Viana's plan go down the drain.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is indeed difficult to find someone in the Cloud Sect who could do the job. But there's a candidate." With a pointed look, Saint Viana slowly suggested a chance.</p>

  <p>"Who?" Given the circumstances, Saint Zara was very curious to see who the other was talking about.</p>

  <p>"Johanson Jiang," he replied.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean that you want Johanson to join the round and kill Luo Zheng?"</p>

  <p>The idea had Saint Zara raising his voice.</p>

  <p>With sharp eyes, Saint Viana said in a voice laced with sarcasm, "Saint Zara, you can say that louder, I don't think everyone heard you."</p>

  <p>Although they were seated far from the arena, there were still many elders around and the leader of the sect was also present. If they really wanted to hear what they were talking about, it wouldn't be too difficult to do so.</p>

  <p>Saint Zara's face turned pale and he lowered his voice. "I suggest that you give up. Johanson is my apprentice. If he kills Luo Zheng, are you sure Mu Ning won't blame it on me?"</p>

  <p>The idea made the other sneer. "If it were one month ago, I wouldn't dare have Johanson do the job as he is your apprentice. I had to look for someone from the disciples of the thirty-three peaks. But now, things have changed. Mu Ning always gets involved in the internal strife of the royal family. Rumor has it that she was put under house arrest. She's now greatly troublesome herself. Do you think she has any time to mind Zheng's business?"</p>

  <p>In spite of the reasoning, Saint Zara still looked hesitant. "But Zheng's excellent performance has already attracted the leader's attention. If Johanson takes action to kill, won't he anger the leader?"</p>

  <p>"One can only be favored while he is alive. A dead talent is no longer a talent, he's merely a corpse," Saint Viana said with a sneer.</p>

  <p>Finishing his words, he turned to look at Saint Zara who still had a hint of reluctance in his expression. Scornfully, he continued, "Don't forget that you also contributed to getting Yan into the Hell Mountain before. If Luo Zheng isn't killed, he will certainly enter the Cloud Hall with that talent or even become a core disciple. No matter how far he goes, there is possibility that he will suppress Cloud Sect by taking advantage of the Cloud Hall. Do you think we'll get away with that?"</p>
