  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Mountain? There are even mountains in this world?" Zheng asked, staring in the southwest direction.</p>

  <p>"Of course there are," the woman replied lightly. "Actually, we are standing at the edge of this world."</p>

  <p>From this spot, they couldn't see the whole world because they had turned into little figures and there were strong winds and heavy snow blocking their vision.</p>

  <p>But this woman had come to this world numerous times, so she was more familiar with it than anyone else.</p>

  <p>She did not hide anything from Zheng, and instead treated him as if he was a close friend. She continued, "Although it has not been verified, it is close to the fact. In fact, we are right in the coffin containing the True Demon Body."</p>

  <p>"We are in the coffin?" Zheng was surprised and he exchanged a silent glance with Sword Chen.</p>

  <p>Even the clones of the Holy Beings had puzzled looks on their faces.</p>

  <p>These clones were as smart as the real Holy Beings and had their own thoughts. However, they would never take the initiative to ask questions no matter how confused they were, as they had absolutely submitted themselves to the woman.</p>

  <p>"Well, do you remember seeing anything in the four corners of the coffin?" the woman asked in reply.</p>

  <p>Sword Chen thought for a while and shook his head.</p>

  <p>His attention had been completely focused on the girl in the coffin, so he had not noticed anything in the corners.</p>

  <p>Zheng, however, raised his eyebrows slightly and said, "I remember seeing the runes... Or perhaps they're more like special divine textures, but these divine textures seem to form the shape of a giant..." When he spoke of this, his eyes flashed with understanding. "Did those runes create the thing that chased Nicholas and his group?"</p>

  <p>The woman smiled at Zheng. "Well, it seems that you can guess everything."</p>

  <p>Anyone who entered the coffin would randomly appear at one of the corners.</p>

  <p>If they didn't comfort the little girl's body before they entered, the runes at the edges of the coffin would be activated and a huge Demon Ice Sculpture would be formed and sent to chase them.</p>

  <p>"But how could a statue be able to hunt down so many Holy Beings?"</p>

  <p>Zheng was still puzzled.</p>

  <p>There was no doubt that the Abyss Demon Region was dangerous, but those Holy Beings were supposed to be the strongest in the divine land. Almost all of them had powerful trump cards and mysterious survival methods up their sleeves.</p>

  <p>This woman was powerful, but without the support of the clones, she was no match for the Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>So how could a mere statue have such power?</p>

  <p>"It would be impossible for the statue to do such a thing in other places...</p>

  <p>But the world in the ice coffin is very special," the woman said with a cautious look. "In this small ice coffin, it controls the flowing way of energy. Such a skill is enough to make it invincible!"</p>

  <p>"Who is it? What's the flowing way?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"It's the True Demon Body," the woman said with a faint smile. "All you need to know is that it can deal with any energy as it pleases..."</p>

  <p>This woman could use the Faith Energy at will, and it was this skill that made her much stronger than even the great fiends.</p>

  <p>Before the alliance of the rich clans had barged into the Abyss Demon Region, she had tried every means she could think of but still hadn't succeeded.</p>

  <p>"Does the True Demon Body also have a mind of its own?" Sword Chen suddenly asked.</p>

  <p>It was not rare to see a magic weapon with consciousness in the divine land.</p>

  <p>However, the True Demon Body took the form of a girl. If it did have consciousness, would it be considered a person?</p>

  <p>"Yes, but its intelligence is of a very low level. For now, it just resists being possessed by others," the woman replied.</p>

  <p>If the True Demon Body had a high intelligence, it would probably turn into the strongest ferocious beast in the Abyss Demon Region, surpassing her and the fiends...</p>

  <p>While they were talking, Zheng and the others crossed the vast snow plain.</p>

  <p>Now, a huge snow mountain stood in front of them.</p>

  <p>The huge footprints left by the Demon Ice Sculpture had been visible a few moments ago, but they were now covered by heavy snow.</p>

  <p>"What? What's that?"</p>

  <p>When they passed the col at the foot of the snow mountain, a peculiar expression appeared on Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>Then, he and Sword Chen set themselves down on the ice.</p>

  <p>When they saw what was underneath the ice, they were surprised.</p>

  <p>The sight of so many dead bodies was scary, especially for Sword Chen...</p>

  <p>"These corpses are me... These are also clones!" Sword Chen looked stunned.</p>

  <p>Having seen the woman's tricks before, it didn't take long for Zheng and Sword Chen to put two and two together.</p>

  <p>However, it had never occurred to both of them that there would be so many corpses here.</p>

  <p>"About 130, 000 corpses are buried here. And more than 30, 000 corpses were crushed so they couldn't be carried back," the woman explained as she descended.</p>

  <p>Staring at the road made by the corpses, Sword Chen asked, "But why are they buried here?"</p>

  <p>"It's just a record," the woman replied with a shrug.</p>

  <p>As they spoke, there was suddenly a slight vibration underneath their feet; the whole snow mountain was shaking.</p>

  <p>"It's starting! Let's go!" There was a smile on the woman's face.</p>

  <p>In fact, she had the ability to hide this ice coffin in the first place.</p>

  <p>However, she had just led those Holy Beings into the ice coffin. On one hand, she could use them to lead the way, and on the other hand, she could also let them die in this way.</p>

  <p>Then, she led Zheng and the others up the snow mountain.</p>

  <p>The snow mountain was very steep, with a height of tens of millions of feet.</p>

  <p>However, with their speed, it would take Zheng and the others only about three minutes to climb to the peak.</p>

  <p>The moment Zheng and the others set foot on the mountainside, the snow mountain shook again.</p>

  <p>Rumble...</p>

  <p>Due to the violent vibration, snow collapsed from the top of the mountain.</p>

  <p>The woman thought for a little while, and then directed one of the Holy Beings' clones to step out. The clone slashed down with his sword.</p>

  <p>Crack...</p>

  <p>The collapsing snow split into two with a huge gap in the middle through which Zheng and the others rushed up.</p>

  <p>About three minutes later, Zheng finally reached the top of the mountain.</p>

  <p>He took a closer look and realized that there was a huge mouth in the center of the snow mountain's peak.</p>

  <p>The snow mountain was actually like a huge volcano!</p>

  <p>However, what erupted from the mouth of the snow mountain was not lava, but freezing air and massive chunks of ice. It was an ice volcano!</p>

  <p>"Those people are in danger!"</p>

  <p>As soon as Zheng reached the top of the mountain, he saw about five Demi-holy Beings and more than ten consummate True Gods flying above the huge mouth.</p>

  <p>When cold air shot out of the ice volcano, the Demi-holy Beings and the consummate True Gods didn't have any time to dodge. By the time the air around the mouth of the ice volcano cleared, they had completely disappeared from sight.</p>

  <p>Completely frozen to ice by the cold air, they had fallen into the deep volcano.</p>
