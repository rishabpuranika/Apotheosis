  <p>
</p>

  <p>Formerly known as Fren, the third son in the Zhuge family had been nicknamed as 'Fren the loony'.</p>

  <p>Fren's ruthless and tyrannical behavior had earned him this nickname. He was always furious and presumptuous. And so everyone started to call him 'Fren the loony'.</p>

  <p>"Oh?" The expression in Luo Zheng's eyes changed, and his face became more serious as he remarked, "Fren's servant. What great fame for you! Good prestige! How dare you instigate internal battles in Drizzle Peak?"</p>

  <p>As with any other peaks, Drizzle Peak saw its share of in-fighting. But these struggles were internal affairs.</p>

  <p>Now that another peak had stepped into Drizzle Peak's internal affairs, all disciples would unite. In fact, the?other thirty-two peaks at Cloud Sect were like this, too. Everyone fought behind closed doors. But once they got involved in a fight outside, they united against their common enemy. Unparalleled and consistent.</p>

  <p>Thomas had instigated Leo to attack Luo Luo Zheng. This interference was taboo and a violation of laws. This was not allowed to happen here!</p>

  <p>Therefore, Luo Zheng's observation drew the hostility of Drizzle Peak's disciples. Thomas was hurled into the spotlight.</p>

  <p>An unfriendly expression grew on the faces of the spectators.</p>

  <p>Once the thought clicked in everyone's mind, they all banded together against Thomas. Even though Drizzle Peak was ranked the last among the other peaks, the disciples still felt a strong sense of loyalty toward their Peak and peers.</p>

  <p>Fren was powerful, and the Zhuge family was certainly a giant among the noble clans.</p>

  <p>Did the power of the Zhuge family mean that the disciples of Drizzle Peak could be bullied? What angered the spectators even more was that Thomas was only a slave to Fren! He was not even a disciple at Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>Thomas was very calm. To him, these outer disciples were a group of rabble. He was confident that when they heard Fren's name, they would be scared and they would kneel before him. He sneered, "I am arrogant.</p>

  <p>So what? I did it. I instigated Leo to pick a fight. What can you do?"</p>

  <p>"What can I do?" Luo Luo Zheng turned and sought Sean from among the crowd.</p>

  <p>Then he asked aloud, "Sean, will I be held responsible for teaching him a lesson?"</p>

  <p>Sean walked out of the crowd and took a look at Thomas. Then he said,</p>

  <p>"This person is only a slave to the Zhuge family. He is not a disciple of Cloud Sect. He provoked us to attack each other in Drizzle Peak. Of course, we must teach him a lesson. Even the masters will support us!"</p>

  <p>"Well, good!" A smile spread on Luo Zheng's face as Sean finished. Luo Luo Zheng walked toward Thomas slowly.</p>

  <p>"You, stop there... what are you going to do?" Realizing the danger from Luo Luo Zheng, Thomas took a few steps back and shouted in a high, thin voice, "I am Fren's servant. If you dare to touch me, my master will take you, will take you...."</p>

  <p>Before Thomas could finish, Luo Luo Zheng reached out as quick as a lightning bolt, twisted his thick neck, and pressed his neck on the blade of the Purple Blue Sword. Then, Luo Luo Zheng put a foot on his back and said in an even tone,</p>

  <p>"Finish that sentence! I dare you. If I touch you, what will your master do to me?"</p>

  <p>The sharp blade of?the Purple Blue Sword?was pressed?on Thomas' neck. If Luo Luo Zheng pushed even a little bit forward, Thomas would be decapitated.</p>

  <p>Thomas' face flushed. His eyes were fixed on the sharp sword.</p>

  <p>Screaming like a pig being killed echoed through the battle ring. His lips trembled so much that he couldn't say a word. Soon the smell of urine permeated the air. Thomas had peed himself.</p>

  <p>At this time, an?outer disciple stepped forward. He reached out and held the Purple Blue Sword's blade with two fingers.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, this person serves Fren. If you kill him, I'm afraid your actions will be difficult to explain to Fren. You can't afford to offend the Zhuge family. Why not let him go? I believe that Fren will also let this issue pass," the outer disciple rationalized. He was dark-skinned, not tall but stocky.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did not intend to kill Thomas. But he was angry that an outsider would come to Drizzle Peak and incite a fight between him and Leo.</p>

  <p>Moreover, after Leo's defeat, Thomas was still arrogant and superior.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng would not kill him, he did want to teach him a lesson.</p>

  <p>But when the outer disciple stepped out and suggested that Luo Luo Zheng acknowledge the power and influence of the Zhuge family, the situation changed. Luo Luo Zheng began considering killing Thomas.</p>

  <p>"Why should I care if my actions are easy?or hard to explain to Fren? I'm not his servant." Luo Luo Zheng stared at the outer disciple and asked in a cold voice. While it seemed as though the outer disciple was giving valuable advice to Luo Zheng's advantage, he was, in fact, pressuring Luo Luo Zheng to bow to the Zhuge family. Luo Luo Zheng could see that he was trying to help the Zhuge family.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng hated it when people tried to curry favor with noble clans.</p>

  <p>Before the outer disciple could answer Luo Luo Zheng, Thomas, who was still at Luo Zheng's mercy screamed, "Liam, don't stand on ceremony with him. Help me kill him. Kill Luo Luo Zheng and my master will reward you!"</p>

  <p>Liam Cao was ranked 15th among the outer disciples at Drizzle Peak.</p>

  <p>Though he was just half-step into the nature level, Liam was stronger than Leo. Regardless of his power, Liam could not mingle with children from noble clans like Fren easily because of his background. However, Liam Cao had maintained good relationships with clansmen from the offshoot branches of the Zhuge family.</p>

  <p>The purpose of Liam's intervention on Thomas' behalf was to earn favor with Fren. If things went according to plan, this would be a good opportunity for him to be connected with Fren.</p>
