<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Among all nine dragons, Luo Zheng had the best relationship with the cyan dragon. After all, Luo Zheng had spent most of his years with the cyan dragon's company. Once the other eight dragons had awoken, the cyan dragon chose to stay silent. But now, he infused Luo Zheng with his energy, in a tactical manner.</p>

  <p>In the past, it was highly possible that Luo Zheng might have held a grudge against the nine dragons, due to their deceptive ways. His anger was amplified, of course, because they had also threatened him with Yan.</p>

  <p>After learning about the Evolutionary Universe's origins as well as Mike's identity, it was as if all that resentment had dissipated.</p>

  <p>It was true that, ultimately, they had no intentions of harming him, right?</p>

  <p>Although he had only recovered a very small portion of his strength and still remained very weak, Luo Zheng was now at least free to move on his own.</p>

  <p>While he was concentrating on absorbing the power of the dragon scales, everyone had had the chance to enter the black sphere. When Luo Zheng finally opened his eyes, everything was still pitch black.</p>

  <p>"Put me down..."</p>

  <p>Now that his strength was gradually being restored, Luo Zheng suddenly smelled a faint, pleasant fragrance. He took a deeper breath and feeling the soft hair fluttered around his face from time to time, Luo Zheng realized that he was lying on Liusu's back.</p>

  <p>"Oh, how did you recover your strength so quickly?" Although she wasn't a body refiner, Han Liusu knew that Luo Zheng was in a weakened state just moments before.</p>

  <p>"I am fine," Luo Zheng said. He was standing up now, trying to readjust his eyes. His circular pupils grew larger in the darkness but still, he couldn't see a damn thing!</p>

  <p>This kind of situation wasn't unknown to Luo Zheng. He had already experienced this several times in the past. He knew that this place must be filled with some kind of intense Dark Law.</p>

  <p>If a Holy Being had set it up himself, then it was safe to say that no one here could see through the darkness. And just as Luo Zheng had thought, everyone moved slowly within the black space, pressed closely up against one another.</p>

  <p>No one dared run in the darkness; they knew nothing about what the space in the black sphere contained. At the moment, everyone here felt blind. At best, most of them had released their senses in order to explore the surrounding terrain - but even that was uneventful. They were all walking on the same, flat plane with nothing but oblivion for miles.</p>

  <p>There was nothing else to explore.</p>

  <p>After walking in the pitch blackness for a certain time, someone broke the silence. "Kaydan, are you sure this black sphere is actually connected to the other black spheres?"</p>

  <p>Kaydan could feel everyone's eyes on him. They were waiting for him to answer.</p>

  <p>After a moment of silence, Kaydan replied, "Yes, I am. The last time I entered one of these black spheres, I walked all the way through it and emerged from another one."</p>

  <p>"Then why are these black spheres even here?" someone else asked.</p>

  <p>"I'm not sure... To be fair, I'm not really familiar with these black spheres either," Kaydan concluded. He was being honest and really didn't know what purpose the nine black spheres served, aside from floating within the interior world.</p>

  <p>That was when Kennan's voice sounded out once again. "If my guess is right, these nine black spheres would be the Nine Divine Stars of the Holy Being!"</p>

  <p>In the darkness, Luo Zheng closed his eyes for a second. He thought the same way as Kennan did. He also believed that these nine black spheres were the Holy Being's Nine Divine Stars.</p>

  <p>"Nine Divine Stars? It is said that after a warrior enters the Holy Realm, the Nine Divine Stars would indeed move into his or her inner world.</p>

  <p>But the Nine Divine Stars are a gathering place for the strength source.</p>

  <p>There's no strength source within this black ball," a warrior of the divine land said doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"Now that, I can't pronounce myself on. Holy Jay is a maverick. It was already very strange for him to place his strength source within the Collapsing Mountain race. However, the thoughts of a Holy Being are not something that an existence like us could understand," Kennan said frankly.</p>

  <p>A Holy Being was a peak existence of the divine land. There might be a reason for such an arrangement, but ordinary warriors would never come close to even guessing it.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't understand this factor at all, either. Placing his strength source in Sacred Spring Mountain was equivalent to abolishing his Nine Divine Stars. Doing this would literally be unreasonable.</p>

  <p>"Hey!"</p>

  <p>While deep in thought, Luo Zheng suddenly saw a faint flash of golden light not far away.</p>

  <p>That golden light only appeared for a very brief period of time. However, in such a dark place, when a golden light appeared, you noticed it! It was as dazzling as fireflies in the dark. Luo Zheng knew he saw it clearly.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?" Han Liusu asked.</p>

  <p>Zheng's curiosity began to grow. "You didn't see it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"See what?" Although he couldn't see her face, Luo Zheng could tell that Han Liusu looked puzzled.</p>

  <p>"It's nothing... Never mind."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng knew what he had seen and he was sure it wasn't an illusion. It was a flash of golden light.</p>

  <p>In the darkness, the light had been extremely dazzling. Luo Zheng realized that he was the only one to take notice and the others didn't have any reaction at all. This could only mean one thing: Luo Zheng could see the golden light, but the others couldn't.</p>

  <p>With this thought running through his mind, Luo Zheng carefully left the group.</p>

  <p>He wanted to get a closer look at what that golden light really was.</p>

  <p>Shortly after sighting the first one, another burst of dazzling golden light flew into Zheng's view. This time, the golden light had been much clearer than the first; it was actually a golden Sanskrit word!</p>
