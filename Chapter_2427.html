<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2427 A Fight For Authority </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Back when Zheng was in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, Holy Jay told him something interesting.</p>

  <p>According to Holy Jay, the divine land was constantly falling and there would eventually come a day when it would crash.</p>

  <p>Zheng knew this but felt that it wasn't such a danger for him to worry about, so he didn't think about it that much.</p>

  <p>Harold's words made him remember what Holy Jay told him and he immediately connected the two things.</p>

  <p>"You compare the divine land to a ship?"</p>

  <p>Harold laughed at Zheng's remark and shook his head. "No, the divine land is a ship by nature, but since it was built, it has traveled through the chaos for countless years. The skeleton used to be the captain of this ship."</p>

  <p>Zheng frowned. "If he was the captain, then why did he die? Why did a powerhouse at the Other Shore Realm die?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"It's true that warriors at the Other Shore Realm are very powerful but they can be killed by another warrior at the same level," Harold answered.</p>

  <p>"In other words, there's more than one powerhouse at the Other Shore Realm here in the divine land?" Zheng asked, his eyes widening in surprise.</p>

  <p>Harold only nodded in response.</p>

  <p>"Then, what's the point of obtaining the skeleton?" Zheng kept his tirade of questions going.</p>

  <p>This time, Harold did not give a direct answer. He first stared at Zheng for a moment before speaking. "What exactly are we fighting for with the Dongfang Clan?"</p>

  <p>"I wanted to ask you the same thing," Zheng answered with a bit of sass.</p>

  <p>He initially thought that his father had gotten into a feud with Nicholas and offended half of the members of Hall of Holy Beings, thus ending up in such a situation.</p>

  <p>Harold shook his head. "What do you think? Do you have any ideas on why exactly we're fighting them?"</p>

  <p>Zheng shrugged, not knowing how to answer this question.</p>

  <p>"On the surface, we are at an absolute disadvantage," Harold explained.</p>

  <p>"Holy Jay is not very powerful, Holy Bromley has since disappeared in the chaos, and my master is on the verge of death. Everything seems as if it's against us, but that's not really the case."</p>

  <p>Zheng remained quiet and listened carefully.</p>

  <p>"Estelle is on our side, as you know, and she has the authority to silence the entire divine land. I control the Everest Spirit Mountain, which means we have authority over all rivers and seas. The Swirl Forest is restrained by Holy Bromley's fairy palace, so no one else has the authority to control it except Hallet and Augustus..."</p>

  <p>Halfway through, Harold laughed. "What we are actually fighting for is the authority to control this ship. From the beginning to the end, my master and Nicholas fought over authority!"</p>

  <p>The fact shocked Zheng greatly.</p>

  <p>He never expected the divine land to be a ship.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the Holy Beings all fought against one another to control it!</p>

  <p>"In terms of authority, the Ruling Slate should be the highest, right?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>According to what he previously learned, the Ruling Slate was the one that set almost all rules in the divine land and it was always held above all others.</p>

  <p>"That's true but the use of the Ruling Slate is limited. If one wants to make strong and advantageous rules, the divine might coins one needs may not be attainable. The purpose of Nicholas building an alliance with a few other powerful clans is to accumulate more divine might coins and control all authority with the help of the Ruling Slate."</p>

  <p>However, the Soul Wilderness was in Estelle's hands and the Everest Spirit Mountain in Harold's.</p>

  <p>The only way to obtain a large number of divine might coins was to enter the Swirl Forest and the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>If the Swirl Forest was under Hallet and Augustus's jurisdiction, the only choice left would be the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>However, the Abyss Demon Region was a dangerous place. A consummate True God could die there if they weren't careful enough. It was far more dangerous than the other three forbidden lands.</p>

  <p>"Nicholas can't get divine might coins fast enough," Harold continued.</p>

  <p>"So the main purpose of this debate over the Godly Ways is to obtain the authority over the divine land?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, you've got it! According to Holy Jay's speculation, the divine land is already in an urgent state. The Sword Clan has held numerous debates over the past divine eras but is unable to gain anything. There is no more room for error this time," Harold explained.</p>

  <p>With that, Zheng's mind felt much clearer.</p>

  <p>According to Harold, the skeleton's position was already confirmed at the center of the Sunrest Tree's trunk.</p>

  <p>However, this skeleton was able to use the Sunrest Tree to release strong Truth of Godly Way, making it resistant to all living beings.</p>

  <p>The Sword Clan tried many times to get close but failed every single time.</p>

  <p>Moreover, due to the Truth of Godly Way in the Non-combat Zone, the stronger one's cultivation base was, the stronger the resistance one would suffer. That meant it was even harder for the Holy Beings to enter the zone.</p>

  <p>With constant exploration, the Sword Clan eventually figured out that if they truly wanted to approach the skeleton, then they needed to have a deeper understanding of the Truth of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>However, there was nobody in the divine land who had such wisdom. If those Holy Beings had such an understanding then they would've already become powerhouses at the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>It was then that the Sword Clan came up with the idea of a debate. They gathered all True Gods in the divine land and hoped that someone would one day approach the captain of the ship. Whether that person was from the Dongfang Clan or another powerful one wasn't important.</p>

  <p>From this point of view, the Sword Clan's goal was similar to Holy Jay's.</p>

  <p>Holy Jay also looked for True Gods with the capacity to save the divine land. Zheng didn't know if he sent any disciples to participate in this debate.</p>

  <p>"You should've gone to the Everest Spirit Mountain as arranged, but unfortunately..." Harold trailed off and shook his head. "Anyway, we have to count on Yan in this debate."</p>

  <p>"Is it because I don't cultivate any Truth of Godly Way?" Zheng asked with a smile.</p>

  <p>Harold replied with a nod.</p>

  <p>Zheng could only shrug. "Such a pity."</p>

  <p>Soon after, Harold glanced past the enchanted barrier. "Look, Yan has passed."</p>

  <p>Harold then removed the enchanted barrier and walked with Zheng towards the exit of the Killing Zone. Zheng's face was obviously lit up with joy at the result.</p>

  <p>The difficulty of the Killing Zone was obvious to all.</p>

  <p>Only two of the ten thousand top-rank True Gods passed the second round of screening. Yan was one of those two.</p>

  <p>She looked a bit tired after going through such an intense battle.</p>

  <p>In fact, there was no joy on her face as she walked out.</p>

  <p>Just like her brother, she didn't really have much interest in participating in the debate.</p>

  <p>Not long after she came out of the Killing Zone, a thin figure appeared in front of her.</p>

  <p>When she raised her head, light suddenly flashed in her crystal-like eyes in astonishment.</p>
