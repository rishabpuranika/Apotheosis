<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1975 Malice Of The Universe </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>A number of Supreme Lords stood on either side of Maha, and all of them remained silent.</p>

  <p>To be honest, none of the Supreme Lords present was happy with Maha.</p>

  <p>A Supreme Lord was a superior existence in every which way. They were the people who stood at the peak of this world, the ones who carried the Heavenly Destiny, and the ones who represented the heavens.</p>

  <p>Even though Maha was a Godly Genius and the son of the top Supreme Lord, he was still just a world lord. And the Supreme Lords would not willingly submit to anyone without any absolute strength to suppress them.</p>

  <p>But because of Maha's status, the Supreme Lords maintained a respectful attitude, even though it was a facade.</p>

  <p>Now that Maha had encountered a problem and wanted the Supreme Lords to come up with some ideas, they might not necessarily be very cooperative.</p>

  <p>Maha had originally gathered the Supreme Lords today for a brainstorming session. As he looked at the reluctant Supreme Lords, the smile on his face hardened.</p>

  <p>"It looks like none of you has anything to worry about at all!" Maha sneered. "Didn't you discover anything strange after arriving here?"</p>

  <p>Most of the Supreme Lords remained silent.</p>

  <p>Only Supreme Lord Noel spoke up. "Of course we have. This world is filled with malice towards us."</p>

  <p>Maha nodded. "Yes, malice!"</p>

  <p>The universe was originally an organic whole, like a complete human being.</p>

  <p>If a person got sick, all bodily functions would be mobilized to fight against the disease. If the human body could beat the disease, then it would naturally heal. If not, the disease would worsen.</p>

  <p>The Evolutionary Universe was like a person, and the Sacred race had broken through the Sighing Wall, which was like breaking through its skin.</p>

  <p>As an alien race, the Sacred race had begun to erode the body like a countless number of diseases attacking it.</p>

  <p>The Evolutionary Universe didn't even need the command of the Holy Being to initiate an attack. It was simply a conditioned reflex.</p>

  <p>The grass, the trees, the rivers, the lakes, the sea, the space, the stars, and countless other living beings and races of the universe maintained a strong enmity towards the Sacred race.</p>

  <p>Even when they simply walked on the grass, they would occasionally stumble over knotted grass.</p>

  <p>Since the invasion, the Sacred race had already encountered 70, 000 earthquakes in various supreme worlds.</p>

  <p>As they proceeded through the supreme worlds of the Humanity Alliance, they encountered over six hundred massive beast attacks, over a thousand insect aggressions, and over ten thousand tsunamis.</p>

  <p>These were mere statistics, but the true number of disasters might well exceed that.</p>

  <p>These inexplicable disasters were all aimed at the martial artists of the Sacred race. This was the counterattack of the universe.</p>

  <p>These were minor disasters for the Sacred race and didn't cause much damage to these martial artists.</p>

  <p>But there was another type of disaster.</p>

  <p>Thunder. In a clear sky.</p>

  <p>Three months ago, a bolt of lightning had suddenly struck from within the Three Purities World.</p>

  <p>Ordinary thunder wouldn't have bothered anyone as much. But the blood-red thunder contained the ninth layer of Thunder Law, with a power that was extremely terrifying. Even a Supreme Lord would be forced to retreat if they encountered such a massive lightning bolt.</p>

  <p>This single bolt of lightning had killed over 10, 000 Sacred martial artists, including four grand world lords and seventeen world lords.</p>

  <p>Or, for example, space windstorms.</p>

  <p>The spatial tunnels built by the humans were highly stable.</p>

  <p>There might be no space windstorms for thousands of years. Even if there was one, it wouldn't be on that big of a scale.</p>

  <p>But when it was time for the Sacred race to pass through the spatial tunnels, massive space windstorms had already erupted 76 times, taking away a number of Sacred armies. Twenty world lords had died in the space windstorms, including a grand world lord.</p>

  <p>There were also falling stars, and the Gold-cutting Gales.</p>

  <p>All of this malicious intent from the Evolutionary Universe was nearly impossible to guard against. This caused great headaches to the Sacred race.</p>

  <p>"The stronger the power in this universe, the stronger the revenge! Why would I want to snatch so many Roaring Tokens away and roar in this Evolutionary Universe?" Maha's eyes shone brilliantly, two flames of fire rising within his pupils. "That's because if we destroy the morale of this universe, its power will weaken!"</p>

  <p>The malice that came from the Evolutionary Universe had truly lessened a while ago.</p>

  <p>It was just as Maha had said; this was all thanks to him! "We understand what you have to say. And we're doing the same thing! If it weren't for us, would those old fellows from the human race have let you get rid of them so casually?" Denzel snorted. "The morale that you personally destroyed has been motivated by Luo Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>Maha's expression didn't change. "This universe was built by a Holy Being. Of course, it couldn't be easily destroyed! That's why I have gathered you all here today, hoping that you would come up with some ideas!"</p>

  <p>"Our top Godly Genius is extraordinarily wise. I believe you already have a plan. Why bother asking us old fellows?" Supreme Lord Irvin said, his tone strange.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords of the Sacred race were divided into three groups.</p>

  <p>Among the three groups, the Supreme Lords led by Denzel hated Maha the most. Supreme Lord Irvin was one of them.</p>

  <p>One of the groups remained neutral. This group of Supreme Lords didn't like Maha either. But what happened on the grander scale was more important to them, which was why they weren't as hostile towards Maha.</p>

  <p>The third group, including Supreme Lord Noel and Supreme Lord Barrie, followed Maha, hanging on to his every word.</p>

  <p>At Supreme Lord Irvin's words, Maha's eyes flashed. He sighed and said,</p>

  <p>"Supreme Lord Irvin, it seems that you still don't know what cards the humans have!"</p>

  <p>"What do they have?" Supreme Lord Irvin said disdainfully.</p>

  <p>The group that Supreme Lord Denzel and Supreme Lord Irvin belonged to had always valued strength and were proud of theirs. They had always been disdainful towards the human Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>The only one they were afraid of was perhaps Wynn, the True God behind the Celestial Position race.</p>

  <p>"The Heavenly Destiny that the old leader of the Celestial Position race has taken on is the Evolution Lotus Flower that Mike has comprehended.</p>

  <p>This Lotus Flower can use the power of the universe." Maha stared at Supreme Lord Irvin, his smile getting colder by the second. "I don't know just how powerful this universe is, but if you guys ever meet this old man, you must be very, very careful!"</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords' faces darkened at this.</p>

  <p>As Supreme Lords, they understood that there were different levels of destinies. Some Heavenly Destinies were excessively strong, while others were pitifully weak. They were divided into the upper, middle, and lower ranks of Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>The Lotus Flower in the Evolutionary Universe and the spinulose wood fern in the Murphy Universe were both called "Heavens-suppressing Object" by the Sacred race and were used to suppress the heavens. It was the strongest Heavenly Destiny of the heavens.</p>

  <p>Maha's father owned this Heavenly Destiny in the Murphy Universe where the Sacred race came from.</p>

  <p>"Where did you get that information from, Godly Genius?" a Supreme Lord of the Sacred race asked.</p>

  <p>"That is not important. What is important is your attitudes. If we were to fight those Supreme Lords, you guys would be the ones to rush to their deaths. Not me," Maha sneered.</p>

  <p>"But when it does happen, how can you bear to stay out of it?" Supreme Lord Denzel countered coldly.</p>

  <p>"Oh?" The smile on Maha's face widened. "It would be a pity if my body were to perish, of course. But my father has prepared another body for me, made of a holy fruit of the spinulose wood fern. So I don't care if I die or not in the Evolutionary Universe. On the other hand, if you guys were to die... Heh heh!"</p>

  <p>Maha had already made preparations. He had a way out even if he died.</p>

  <p>His father was controlling the spinulose wood fern. He had also taken a holy fruit from the tree and turned it into another body for Maha, which was even better than the previous one.</p>

  <p>As Maha spoke, a silence descended on the Supreme Lords once again.</p>

  <p>But this silence was different.</p>

  <p>Previously, they hadn't wanted to cooperate with Maha, but now, they were pondering the situation they were about to face.</p>

  <p>After five minutes of silence, Maha leaned back against his chair. In his hand was a small golden scimitar. Maha's fingers gently caressed the edge of the exquisite-looking scimitar.</p>

  <p>He narrowed his eyes and swept his gaze across the crowd of Supreme Lords, an arrogant smile appearing on his face.</p>

  <p>He hadn't had any regard for these Supreme Lords from the very beginning.</p>

  <p>After a long while, Supreme Lord Palmere, who had been neutral so far, finally spoke up. "If we want to destroy their momentum, we must first give the humans a painful beating."</p>

  <p>"I actually hope to start an all-out war with the human race, but I'm afraid those old foxes aren't so stupid," Maha said, shaking his head.</p>
