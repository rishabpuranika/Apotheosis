  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Pang!"</p>

  <p>The dragons turned to see where the resounding boom had originated.</p>

  <p>It was closely followed by another loud crash, and they soon discerned that it was the sound of something breaking.</p>

  <p>Zheng, in his deranged state, had managed to crush a brown, stone floor tile into pieces after having tossed himself over it. Although, he didn't seem to take notice as he proceeded to stumble and stagger his way across the courtyard deliriously.</p>

  <p>He was making a huge, chaotic mess. His body appearing to be possessed with the strength of a thousand soldiers; every accidental bump he had made with the stone pillars caused them to shatter completely. Still, he was blinded by the agony he felt that he was not yet to be made aware of the three rooms that had collapsed after he ran into them.</p>

  <p>The ruckus in the manor made Zheng's innocent neighbors cower in fright.</p>

  <p>The owner had summoned his family members to gather in their shop, and with a quivering voice, he tried to console both himself and his family.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry, the cultivator is only practicing. There's no need to fear. Just remember that no matter what happens, never go to his yard and risk disturbing him."</p>

  <p>The family all nodded in agreement. They were shaking, trembling so badly that the owner was almost certain that none had been able to even listen to his words properly.</p>

  <p>'It's okay, ' he reassured himself. 'My wife is here, so are my children…' His eyes swept over the group, before they widened in horror. "Alice! Where's Alice? She's not here!" The room fell silent as everyone looked at each other in dread.</p>

  <p>They all scattered in a hurry to look for the missing daughter, but ultimately failed to see any sign of her presence within the shop.</p>

  <p>Oblivious to her family's turmoil, Alice had remained unmoving from her spot; entranced by the unbelievable situation on the other side of the wall.</p>

  <p>Perhaps, it was the child in her that led her to be so unperturbed by the dangers she was currently exposed to. With a gaze filled with wonder and disbelief, she whispered to herself, "Is that guy really as tough as iron and steel?"</p>

  <p>"What's he doing? He's running into walls, and breaking them all to pieces… and he's unharmed? Is that even possible?" She pursed her lips in concentration as she tried to look for any signs of cuts or gashes on the man. "Not even a trace of blood! Are all cultivators as invincible as him?"</p>

  <p>A barrage of thunderous noises cut off Alice's musings.</p>

  <p>Zheng rampaged like an angered, blinded bull sporadically wrecking whatever stood in his path. Despite this, Alice was still foolishly gawking at his strange behavior. That was, until Zheng dashed out of the house and ran directly towards her direction.</p>

  <p>Now, Alice was no fool. She had already harbored suspicions that this young man might not even be sentient, seeing as his conduct might as well label him as an irrational, violent beast. He could easily ram down the wall and crush Alice without a single doubt or hesitation in his mind. She began to panic. 'Will I be able to react fast..."</p>

  <p>The sound of an enormous force smashing against stones resonated throughout the yard.</p>

  <p>Alice, in pure, unaltered instinct, miraculously dodged in time before the wall she was leaning against was powdered down by Zheng. Through the haze of dust and stone particles covering her vision, she regarded the motionless man lying before her with curious, sparkling eyes.</p>

  <p>"He passed out…?"</p>

  <p>Alice murmured, looking at Zheng's dirtied face.</p>

  <p>His twisted expression gradually disappeared as his consciousness slipped, allowing him a break from the torment he had been forced to endure. Alice took a closer look at his face, and saw a young man beneath all the grime that tarnished his otherwise smooth skin. She frowned, her habit of keeping things clean made her feel peeved and uncomfortable while looking at his dirty face. With that thought in mind, Alice turned around and ran back to her house.</p>

  <p>Her father felt immense relief flood in his veins after seeing his daughter arrive back home. "Alice..."</p>

  <p>Alice paid no heed to his father's calls, and instead busied herself in finding the things she was looking for. "Mother, where did you put the barrel? I need it to help clean the cultivator's face!"</p>

  <p>The owner paled, realizing what she was planning to do.</p>

  <p>"Alice! Alice! We shall not meddle in his business!"</p>

  <p>Her father was afraid, admittedly, as all common people would be. They all feared what they did not understand after all, and so they wished for no involvement or association with the cultivators.</p>

  <p>Alice was seen as the odd one, what with her fearless attitude in approaching the unconscious man. She returned to where Zheng was situated, carrying a barrel of water and several pieces of white cloth with her, before kneeling down and cleaning his face for him.</p>

  <p>While Alice was occupied with her task, the two dragons in Zheng's mind were too caught up in their own conversation to even notice the arrival of the strange girl.</p>

  <p>"Brother, are you sure you're right about your conjecture?"</p>

  <p>The red dragon asked, solemnly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, of course! Zheng has the fate to lead the world of chaos!</p>

  <p>Both his talent and luck demonstrate his growing potential for the position," the cyan dragon nodded as he replied. "Our training and cultivation for him will pay off. At any rate, I guarantee that we will lose nothing."</p>

  <p>The red dragon's face turned graver upon hearing this, "The ability to lead the world of chaos not only depends on those two traits. Remember what our oldest brother once said? The one who is destined to lead the world of chaos shall have both characteristics, and the guidance of destiny to go with it." It was a well-known fact, that no matter how much talent and luck one possessed, it was all meaningless if the fate they hoped to achieve was not the one that was carved for them. Many had tried to pave their own trails, and those many had failed. "Zheng is indeed a genius in the arts of cultivation, and the rare opportunities he has been presented with certainly prove his luck… But I have not seen any signs of the guidance of destiny in his life!"</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon grinned knowingly. "Of course you cannot see it. Zheng's destiny guider is not here with him right now."</p>

  <p>"Oh?"</p>

  <p>The red dragon pondered as he looked at the other expectantly. 'Since he awakened earlier than I did, he must know many things, ' he thought.</p>

  <p>"Zheng has a sister named Yan, and I think she is his destiny guider!" The cyan dragon said it with a certainty that made it hard not to believe his words.</p>

  <p>"Zheng's sole purpose in being here is to save Yan. He encountered various challenges along the way, but he persevered until he was finally able to hold her hand." The cyan dragon said, "His salvation was short-lived though because of Yan's Purple Power Body, and thus she was taken away by Eddie in the end.</p>

  <p>His defeat led him to continuously face obstacles in order to chase after Yan again, and all that made him stronger by leaps and bounds. That is why I think that Yan is Zheng's destiny guider."</p>

  <p>"It sounds reasonable, brother! But, I think that it is still too early to be sure of it. If you're right, Zheng should have been led into a much wider world, instead of this small Central Region," the red dragon countered.</p>

  <p>The other companion agreed with a nod, "Indeed, my conclusion is not yet final. If she really is who I suspect to be, she might be taken away by somebody again."</p>

  <p>Both dragons fell into quiet contemplation before they sighed, "If our eldest brother were here, he would've known the answer to our speculations!"</p>

  <p>The red dragon grumbled in dismay.</p>

  <p>Fate was elusive, akin to traveling a rocky, deserted terrain with no clear destination in sight. Even the most powerful beings like the Genuine Dragon Race were unable to get a hold of the whole picture. Zheng's superb abilities and his unusual destiny were first found by Kenneth, but even he knew of nothing about his fate to lead the world of chaos. It was only intuition that led him to believe that Yan played a role in guiding Zheng forward.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately for Zheng, he was excluded from the topic regarding his own future, as his consciousness had not yet returned.</p>

  <p>Zheng woke up after a long, much needed rest. Disoriented and aching all over, the first thing that had come to his senses was the sweet smell of a young girl hovering over him as soon as he opened his eyes.</p>

  <p>With a throat dry from dehydration, he asked, "Where am I?"</p>
