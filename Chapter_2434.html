<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2434 The Rotten Odor </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Sunrest Tree's trunk was too wide that it almost blocked everyone's view.</p>

  <p>When they looked at it, they couldn't see where it ended. After a while, the crowd moved on the flying swords as if they were flying over an ordinary plain.</p>

  <p>The only difference was that the ground below was not a prairie, nor a desert, but the greyish-brown surface of the Sunrest Tree.</p>

  <p>Although the Heavenly Sword Divine City was the core city of the Sword Clan, it was not located in the center of the Sunrest Tree, but rather in the northern part.</p>

  <p>Everyone had been moving south for a while now. About twenty five minutes later, they came across a large crack.</p>

  <p>It was just a single crack in the entirety of the Sunrest Tree, but it looked more like a huge canyon.</p>

  <p>Marsh slightly adjusted the direction of his long sword and flew along the crack.</p>

  <p>The other True Gods followed suit and trailed closely behind him.</p>

  <p>The crack became increasingly wider as they advanced forward and more cracks appeared.</p>

  <p>The cracks crossed one another and eventually formed one large gap.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, something clicked in Luo Zheng's brain.</p>

  <p>It seemed that the gap was like a "wound" on the Sunrest Tree. Did it came from that giant worm?</p>

  <p>The gap was hundreds of miles wide. Even if all of them stood on the flying swords as they looked down, they couldn't see the bottom.</p>

  <p>Marsh stopped in the middle of the gap after a few minutes. What he said next proved Luo Zheng's guess.</p>

  <p>"We've arrived at our destination. I can only send you until here. Next, you will enter a big hole with a height of 300 million feet. It will be dangerous if you walk forward all the way. Those who want to give up now can go back!" he announced flatly.</p>

  <p>None of the True Gods on the flying swords said anything. Only the whistles of the wind were heard.</p>

  <p>No one would give up at this stage.</p>

  <p>On one side of the group was Yan, who stood upright on her flying sword, looking too excited.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Duke and the top-rank True Gods from the rich and powerful clans such as the Mu Clan, the Tang Clan and the Fang Clan, all cast mischievous look at Luo Zheng and Yan.</p>

  <p>"All of you can start now," Marsh said. Then he looked at Yan and Luo Zheng through the crowd and whispered with a smile, "Good luck to you."</p>

  <p>"Whoosh, whoosh..."</p>

  <p>"Whoosh, whoosh..."</p>

  <p>One by one, the flying swords circled around and swooped downwards into the crack.</p>

  <p>Marsh watched the True Gods slowly become smaller and smaller, until they became small black dots and eventually disappeared in the huge gap.</p>

  <p>He waited for a while, and then twelve flying swords quickly flew towards him from another direction!</p>

  <p>The people on the twelve swords were all dressed in white. They were clearly the disciples from the Sword Clan, and all of them were top-rank True Gods.</p>

  <p>"Master Marsh," the top-rank True God at the helm said as he knelt down on one knee on the long sword.</p>

  <p>The sword didn't shake at all. It turned out that this True God had fully mastered the sword skill.</p>

  <p>"Master Marsh," the other True Gods echoed their leader and knelt down as well.</p>

  <p>"Please rise," Marsh said with a wave of his hand.</p>

  <p>"The disciples of each clan have left. Now it's your turn. You are the best disciples of our Sword Clan. Don't let me down," he continued.</p>

  <p>"We will try our best," the top-rank True God at the helm assured.</p>

  <p>"Reinhard, if you can obtain the inheritance, you should try your best. It might be our last chance," said Marsh. "If you can't get it, you should help Luo Zheng and Yan with all your might! You should be careful about the members of the alliance of the Floating Islands, especially the people from the Dongfang Clan..."</p>

  <p>"We'll keep that in mind!" the True Gods answered in unison. After that, Marsh raised his hand and a stream of blood lashed out.</p>

  <p>It turned into many red blood swords that emitted rays of evil, red light.</p>

  <p>One could tell that they were the evil swords even at a glance.</p>

  <p>The Sword Clan was known for their great respect for swordsmanship, which was why they despised using swords in evil ways and rarely used evil swords.</p>

  <p>Therefore, all the True Gods were shocked to see the scarlet swords.</p>

  <p>"The twelve Calamity Swords are given to you now, but you can only use them in critical moments. You know the consequences of using these swords," Marsh stressed a little worriedly.</p>

  <p>The Calamity Swords were invented by a talented consummate True God of the Sword Clan thirty divine eras ago. As a result, the Sword Clan exiled that young talent, sealed all the Calamity Swords, and forbade anyone from using them.</p>

  <p>Such a sword was too dangerous. Anyone who was to use it would definitely die. They would be tortured to death by all kinds of calamities. It was too inhumane.</p>

  <p>The sword, however, could greatly enhance one's strength in a short amount of time.</p>

  <p>Marsh knew that this was his last chance, so he had to bring out the Calamity Swords and let the top-rank True Gods use them.</p>

  <p>When each of the top-rank True Gods claimed their Calamity Sword, they knew very well that accepting the weapon meant becoming the death warriors of the Sword Clan. There was nothing they could do but grieve in silence.</p>

  <p>"Go ahead," said Marsh as he turned his head away and did not look back.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh..."</p>

  <p>A gust of wind blew as the twelve top-rank True Gods of the Sword Clan dove into the gap as well.</p>

  <p>"The swordsmen try their best to do what's good for the people.</p>

  <p>They are truly honorable..." Marsh's voice floated with the wind and whispered in the ears of the disciples of the Sword Clan.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng's surroundings immediately darkened when he entered the gap.</p>

  <p>He was about ten thousand feet in the crack, where the Truth of Goodwill outside could no longer be transmitted. The place where he stood was filled with the Truth of Malice.</p>

  <p>"We are in the Killing Zone!"</p>

  <p>At that moment, he felt the blood in his body boil and his strong fighting spirit itched to come out.</p>

  <p>"Yes, we are," Yan said with a slight nod.</p>

  <p>She on the other hand closed her eyes for a moment, and then opened them.</p>

  <p>Her orbs shone with a light purple luster.</p>

  <p>The pale purple light however, illuminated her beautiful face in a rather strange way.</p>

  <p>The other True Gods became more vigilant when they entered the Killing Zone. They walked on the flying swords and slowly rotated downwards, as they simultaneously spread out their own soul power and carefully observed their surroundings.</p>

  <p>If they had been in great danger in the Killing Zone that was located near the surface of the Sunrest Tree, then it was even more perilous now that they were at the Sunrest Tree's core.</p>

  <p>There was nothing but silence in the dark space.</p>

  <p>Not even air existed inside it.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a loud voice cut through the quiet air.</p>

  <p>"Look, a giant worm!" one of them exclaimed and pointed to the wall.</p>

  <p>There in front of them was a huge, grotesque worm!</p>

  <p>It had a very large and long body that extended until who knew where.</p>

  <p>The straight cave was already quite wide, but the huge worm's fat and swollen appendage almost took up half the cave's space.</p>

  <p>"This giant worm is sleeping," whispered a True God. "Don't worry. This kind of giant worm has never woken up.</p>

  <p>They are growing, but also perishing in their deep sleep," another True God chimed in.</p>

  <p>However, they came across another giant worm after a short while.</p>

  <p>Then, more and more giant worms appeared as they moved downwards.</p>

  <p>Thirty thousand feet...</p>

  <p>One hundred thousand feet...</p>

  <p>Five hundred thousand feet...</p>

  <p>Rows upon rows of giant worms slept soundly. They wondered how many giant worms were asleep in the vertical tree cave, which looked more like an abyss.</p>

  <p>A pungent, rotten odor assaulted their noses as soon as they descended to seven hundred thousand feet.</p>

  <p>Although they didn't know where the smell came from, they had a faint feeling that something was wrong.</p>
