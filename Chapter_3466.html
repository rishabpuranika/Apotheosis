<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3466 Construction And Soaring Snake </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Calculation Civilization had left some documents alluding to the Energy Shaft. According to them, they had obtained a way to control the Energy Shaft.</p>

  <p>However, just as they were closing in on completing the Finale Way, another ruling force in the chaos attacked them. At last, they failed, ending with regrets.</p>

  <p>But their failure didn't go unnoticed. The supreme masters from all super forces in the Source World caught wind of this civilization.</p>

  <p>Most of them didn't take it seriously, thinking the Calculation Civilization was merely talking nonsense. They believed that there was no such thing as a magical Energy Shaft!</p>

  <p>Even so, some super forces took an interest in it, and even designated some manpower and resources to study about it further.</p>

  <p>However, even with countless efforts made, the research was fruitless.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, the Chaos Ancient God behind Mount had been quite interested in the Energy Shaft. As he wielded the truth of space, he had a natural advantage in understanding space. In fact, at some point, he had even figured out what its prototype would be like.</p>

  <p>It was almost the same as the one that hovered in front of Yan's forehead, which was why Mount could recognize it instantly. Yet, he was still uncertain. After all, no one had ever confirmed its existence before!</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Yan activated the Energy Shaft. It flashed a bright light, unleashing shreds of peculiar traction force.</p>

  <p>As the Energy Shaft released an intense gravitational pull, the energy of the black meteorites was easily sucked into it.</p>

  <p>While the Energy Shaft might have been weak in form, it could still release a powerful, special energy. With Yan controlling it, it could suck any energy in her surroundings.</p>

  <p>"Slow!"</p>

  <p>Yan spat out the word once more.</p>

  <p>The forces that the Energy Shaft had absorbed blasted out the instant she spoke.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>The surrounding space seemed to stir, as though time and space were distorting.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, the energy tides that were charging towards disciples from the Oneness Sky Palace and the Pear Hill became thick and viscous, slowing down.</p>

  <p>Witnessing this, the crowd's eyes lit up with hope.</p>

  <p>"Let's go!"</p>

  <p>As the three meteorites fell slowly, the disciples from the Pear Hill and the Oneness Sky Palace weaved their way through.</p>

  <p>However, even though they were putting some distance between them and the falling meteorites, they were still in danger. As the whole world was on fire, it was only a matter of time before the energy being released would become more and more chaotic and violent.</p>

  <p>Yan was a novice to the control of the Energy Shaft. In addition, the Energy Shaft itself was not that strong enough to help them escape.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng was bombarding the surface of the black crystal shield over and over again, but the shield didn't budge. It was much solider than his expectation.</p>

  <p>With every strike, his inner world shook upon impact.</p>

  <p>The Sanskrit words bearing the Eye of Will trembled as the burning of the eye had triggered the counterattack power of the truth rules. After the Civilization Artifact had unfurled, all the counterattack power had been controlled. However, even so, a tiny bit of energy that was occasionally released from the counterattacks would cause a lot of harm to Zheng's inner world!</p>

  <p>"Zheng, the Eye of Will can only be burned for nine more seconds," the Regal Jade Spirit reminded.</p>

  <p>Even if Zheng managed to smash open the black crystal shield in time, he still wouldn't be able to find the white spot.</p>

  <p>As his mind whirled, he suddenly raised his hand and summoned a long sword from his space ring.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>"Soaring Snake Sword!"</p>

  <p>This was Zheng's secret weapon. He would never have revealed it unless he absolutely needed to.</p>

  <p>But at this point, Zheng had no choice.</p>

  <p>"Imperial Sword Seal!</p>

  <p>The Truth of Eternal Sword Intent!"</p>

  <p>The moment the Imperial Sword Seal was activated, the Truth of Godly Way had madly swarmed into it, simultaneously activating the power of the Soaring Snake Sword.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng hadn't cultivated the Truth Enlightenment for a long time, the Soaring Snake Sword burst into a bright white light which enveloped him as the white cyclones swarmed into the seal.</p>

  <p>"That sword...!"</p>

  <p>A leader outside the Chaotic Source World exclaimed as he watched the scene unfold before him.</p>

  <p>From the very beginning, Zheng had focused his attacks at a certain area of the world for seemingly no reason. The leaders probably had figured out that this place was the flaw of that world.</p>

  <p>However, no matter how many times Zheng struck it, it remained virtually undamaged. The leaders who watched from outside had almost lost hope.</p>

  <p>But at that point, Zheng revealed his secret weapon, quite a shock to them.</p>

  <p>"It's the Soaring Snake World!"</p>

  <p>"That sword is in his hand..."</p>

  <p>"Who on earth is this guy?!" "After the extermination of the Nine Li race, we have been hunting for this sword, but we couldn't find it... Could this guy be a member of the Nine Li race?"</p>

  <p>When the Evil God absorbed the bloodline theurgies, he had revealed three heads and six arms. From this, they could tell that someone from the Nine Li race was present.</p>

  <p>Now, Zheng's weapon indicated that, he was likely to come from the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>Athemar stared in silence at the Imperial Sword Seal on Zheng's chest.</p>

  <p>It was true that the Imperial Sword Seal could maximize the power of a sword to the extreme. Moreover, Zheng had deciphered a part of the Truth Enlightenment. The force released by his sword might be only greater!</p>

  <p>As Zheng filled the Soaring Snake Sword with the power of the Truth of Godly Way, he felt a wave of self-consciousness coming from it.</p>

  <p>It was very hungry...</p>

  <p>It needed to merge with more Truths of Godly Ways!</p>

  <p>However, Zheng had infused all the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent into it already. Unlike the Other Shore Power, the Truth of Godly Way couldn't be replenished with divine crystals.</p>

  <p>'How about the Truth of Goodwill and Malice?</p>

  <p>Or the Truth of Cultivation Nature?'</p>

  <p>Zheng quickly activated these two Truths of Godly Ways.</p>

  <p>However, Athemar's Imperial Sword Seal was complementary to the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, but rejected the other two Truths of Godly Ways.</p>

  <p>Zheng tried to inject them into it, but failed.</p>

  <p>'Should I infuse the Truth of Three-Energy Construction in it?' Zheng's heart skipped a beat.</p>

  <p>With little time to think, he could only try all his options. As this thought flashed through his mind, he infused the Truth of Three-Energy Construction into the Imperial Sword Seal. To his relief, the seal accepted it!</p>

  <p>"Chop!"</p>

  <p>From a distance, Zheng wielded his sword and slashed at the black crystal shield below.</p>

  <p>Countless snake shadows emerged, dashing down to the shield. These snakes weren't entities of energy, but actual flesh and blood.</p>

  <p>"Are these snakes... real?!" Zheng's jaw dropped in shock.</p>

  <p>Because of the sensitive position of the Nine Li race, he didn't know much about the Soaring Snake Sword, even in the Source World.</p>

  <p>Zheng had never expected that the snake within the Soaring Snake Sword would come to life, with a real, physical body, after he infused it with the Truth of Three-Energy Construction!</p>

  <p>The countless snakes flew onto the surface of the black crystal shield and actually melted into the shield!</p>

  <p>After thousands of snakes melted into the black crystal shield, nothing happened for a while. The surface of the shield remained unscathed, and its interior pattern was flickering.</p>

  <p>"It didn't work?</p>

  <p>Even the Soaring Snake Sword can't smash open this black crystal shield?"</p>

  <p>The burning light in Zheng's right eye gradually extinguished, and he felt greatly disheartened. If this blow could not break the black crystal shield, he would have a slim chance to kill the Evil God and stop this catastrophe.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Zheng heard a slight sound coming from the black crystal shield. He whipped his head towards the sound.</p>

  <p>A crack appeared on the surface of the black crystal shield, and from it flowed black energy. He had finally penetrated the shield!</p>
