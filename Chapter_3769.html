<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Once he was out of the bone cave, Zheng saw a sprawling white beach in front of him.</p>

  <p>He bent down to grab the white sand and watched it fall in between his fingers. "This sand is also bones. Were countless bones truly crushed and gathered here?"</p>

  <p>"Ordinary crushed bones would have already been weathered. These bones were originally this small," the Primeval Lord of Heaven answered.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Zheng lifted the sand on his palm and looked at it more carefully. As the Primeval Lord of Heaven said, these bones were indeed whole and were just incredibly small.</p>

  <p>For such bones to be so small that they ended up covering an entire area and be mistaken for sand was both incredible and unsettling. "Are these from the tiny creatures of the Calculation Civilization?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>The green figure on the Civilization Artifact shook its head. "It's not us.</p>

  <p>We're even way smaller than these bones."</p>

  <p>Too many civilizations and creatures had existed in the chaos.</p>

  <p>Over a thousand races had once become ruling civilizations and those underneath them, were even more numerous. Of course, there would always be creatures bigger or smaller than others.</p>

  <p>"If you walk a bit more, you'll come upon some new discoveries," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said.</p>

  <p>Zheng decided to walk further along the beach and, to his surprise, found the bones that littered the ground progressively get larger. At first, it had been the size of a grain of sand until it became the size of a pea, then the size of a fist...</p>

  <p>This somehow reminded him of the Immemorial Wilderness save for the fact that the bones there were randomly placed. Here on the beach, the bones were arranged in a certain orderly manner.</p>

  <p>As he ventured forward, Zheng began to see more familiar bones, specifically, human bones!</p>

  <p>He bent down and picked up a random arm bone. "The bone beach records all creatures on the Other Shore?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," the Primeval Lord of Heaven confirmed.</p>

  <p>Zheng turned the bone in his hand curiously. "What about the Regal Jade Civilization?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Some civilizations had special forms and the Regal Jade Civilization was one of them since they did not have any bones.</p>

  <p>"Look at the front left," the Regal Jade Spirit suddenly said, with a smile on his face.</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade Spirit had also stepped into the Land of Bone Tribulation before, so he knew some things.</p>

  <p>Zheng did as he said. When he looked to the left, he saw various green fragments in between the bones. Beside these fragments were metal bones from the Metal Civilization.</p>

  <p>"Entering the Soul City allows one's soul to complete a transformation while entering the Land of Bone Tribulation allows one's body to undergo change. The degree of transformation of soul and body directly determines the power you will obtain in the Eternal Scroll Painting," the Primeval Lord of Heaven explained.</p>

  <p>Eternal Warriors at the Eternal Realm were the most powerful existence in this world.</p>

  <p>However, the Eternal Scroll Painting also had a ranking system and the higher one's ranking was, the greater power one would obtain.</p>

  <p>Zheng raised his eyebrows with interest. "The Eternal Scroll Painting?"</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven nodded. "Yes. You've gotten nine Holy Soul Imprints..." he began. "You are the number-one person in history and just by relying on these nine Holy Soul Imprints, your ranking in the Eternal Scroll Painting won't be low. However, if you can obtain nine Bone Tribulation Imprints, then your ranking could naturally go higher!"</p>

  <p>In fact, the Primeval Lord of Heaven already spoke to the elites of the human race about this. All of them had high expectations for Zheng.</p>

  <p>"The more imprints, the higher the ranking?" Zheng surmised. It hadn't been that hard to figure out.</p>

  <p>"Most cases go like that though there are exceptions," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said. "My junior fellow disciple obtained sixteen imprints but the ranking he received hadn't been ideal. The one who ranked first only had fourteen imprints."</p>

  <p>More imprints meant a bigger advantage in the Eternal Scroll Painting but it wasn't the end-all and be-all of everything. There were always creatures with astonishing willpower that could create miracles and defeat those far stronger than them.</p>

  <p>This piqued Zheng's interest. "Then, who is it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>A trace of caution appeared on the Primeval Lord of Heaven's face. "It's the Eye Spirit of the Element Spirit race."</p>

  <p>There weren't many creatures that could make the Primeval Lord of Heaven so cautious but the Eye Spirit was one of them.</p>

  <p>"Eye Spirit..." Zheng repeated. "Is it the strongest warrior of the Element Spirit race?" The Primeval Lord of Heaven nodded grimly.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>That was the only answer Zheng needed and he stopped asking about the subject.</p>

  <p>After passing through the Land of Bone Tribulation, he would enter Stage Thirty-two and then get into the Eternal Scroll Painting. Now though, he had to focus on getting through this beach of bones first.</p>

  <p>After he passed by the human bones, the following bones all got bigger and bigger. Now, there were bones several dozen feet, further on they would get bigger until they were several hundred feet, and so on! Only a small part of these huge bones floated above the sea, leaving the rest under the waters.</p>

  <p>Not long after, Zheng finally arrived at the edge of the beach. Any further and he would be in the ocean of Soul Interdicting Water.</p>

  <p>"It's the end. Where is the Land of Bone Tribulation?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Wait. There should be bone slaves coming," the Primeval Lord of Heaven told him.</p>

  <p>Zheng did as he was told and took a seat on one of the huge bones to wait. In the distance, dark green flames suddenly blazed to life.</p>

  <p>'Ghost fire?' Zheng thought to himself.</p>

  <p>The cemetery was a place to bury bones and phosphorescent flames frequently rose due to the sheer amount of remains buried there. It was just a bit surprising that there would be flames that burned, though it was the daytime here.</p>

  <p>As the flames rose, they floated towards the skulls that then gained sentience and began to look for the rest of their bodies.</p>

  <p>Spine, shoulder blade, ribs...</p>

  <p>A short while later, fully-formed and assembled human skeletons began to walk towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Are they the bone slaves you were talking about earlier?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven nodded with a smile. "Yes. Every race will have their own bone slaves."</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded in understanding but a question suddenly popped in his head.</p>

  <p>"What if a certain race enters this place for the first time?"</p>

  <p>"Before they enter, the bones of their race will have been created and placed here," the Primeval Lord of Heaven explained patiently.</p>

  <p>There were some special powers on the Other Shore. It should also be noted that the Soul City and the Land of Bone Tribulation were constructed by the Instant Civilization and were thus naturally different from other places.</p>

  <p>Zheng raised yet another question. "These bones... they were created out of nowhere then?"</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven smiled, associating Zheng's question with the Truth of Three-Energy Construction. "It is indeed possible!"</p>

  <p>Ziya discovered the Truth of Three-Energy Construction outside the chaos, which meant the Instant Civilization also came from there.</p>

  <p>The reanimated skeletons came straight to Zheng and the first skeleton that passed him by flipped a slightly larger bone. Zheng watched as the bone landed on the surface of the Soul Interdicting Water and transformed itself into a boat.</p>

  <p>"Please get on," the skeleton said in a strange voice and gestured invitingly towards the boat.</p>

  <p>A trace of vigilance appeared on Zheng's face as he asked the Primeval Lord of Heaven's opinion in his mind.</p>

  <p>"If you want to go to the Land of Bone Tribulation, then you naturally have to board this boat," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said, assuring Zheng and comforting his nerves.</p>

  <p>With no more reservations, Zheng jumped and landed in the middle of the boat.</p>

  <p>The other skeletons quickly got to work, scouring the ground for bones to be used as paddles and also getting on the boat.</p>
