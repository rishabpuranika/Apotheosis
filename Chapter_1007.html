<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>In the past few days, Yudie had announced that she was going into seclusion and refused to entertain outsiders. Normally, it wasn't a problem. Even ten years in secluded cultivation was normal. However, that was not the proper time. There was a war waging and the Cloud Hall couldn't afford to not have a leader at such time.</p>

  <p>Saint Morphens was the person closest to Yudie, and at the same time, the one who understood her feelings the most.</p>

  <p>Although Yudie was already the leader of Cloud Hall, Saint Morphens still treated her like a child. After all, he was a lot older than her. He knew her personality quite well, so he already figured that there was no way to persuade her. Apart from her talents, her headstrong personality made her the leader of Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>At the suggestion of many elders, Saint Morphens finally made up his mind and charged into the Ice Palace.</p>

  <p>In the Ice Palace, there was blue-colored frost scattered everywhere— it was condensed from the life vitality released by Yudie when she was cultivating. While she was still at the Virtual Tribulation Realm, the frost did not have much effect on Saint Morphens. But now that she was at the Life and Death Realm, the frost released by her had become a great threat to him.</p>

  <p>Thus, after entering the Ice Palace, Saint Morphens carefully avoided the constantly flowing energy. Not only that, but he also revolved his life vitality to resist the coldness in the Ice Palace.</p>

  <p>When he bypassed the layers of frost and found Yudie, he didn't know whether to laugh or cry at the situation that unfolded before him. She had actually fallen asleep there.</p>

  <p>When a warrior reached that certain level, they rarely fell asleep from exhaustion. They only relaxed their spirit through meditation. Saint Morphens had no idea just how hard she had cultivated to the point of passing out.</p>

  <p>Beside her were a few small ice phoenixes curling up. As Saint Morphens entered, they all spread their wings and stared at him warily.</p>

  <p>Soon after, Yudie also opened her eyes vigilantly. Looking at Saint Morphens coldly, she asked, "What is it?"</p>

  <p>Saint Morphens hesitated and then said, "Dillon of the World Commercial Alliance has sent people here several times to meet you.</p>

  <p>They have something to discuss with us."</p>

  <p>"Got it," she casually responded, nodding her head. She then proceeded to cross her legs. Raising her head, she asked, "What does the World Commercial Alliance want to do now?"</p>

  <p>"They're saying that we can't sit still and wait for death," Saint Morphens replied, obviously having discussed the current situation with the World Commercial Alliance before.</p>

  <p>In fact, when a war among the sects started, the situation was quite clear.</p>

  <p>When large sects fought with each other, only their strength mattered, and all sorts of schemes were useless.</p>

  <p>Now that the Heavenly Evil Sect was rapidly expanding, both the Cloud Hall and the World Commercial Alliance were in grave danger. They must join forces and fight against Heavenly Evil Sect together.</p>

  <p>Therefore, staying put was the worst they could do.</p>

  <p>"I see," Yudie nodded after thinking about it briefly.</p>

  <p>"Then, may I know how you're planning to deal with this matter?"</p>

  <p>Saint Morphens asked softly.</p>

  <p>"We'll figure out a way to attack the Heavenly Evil Sect together with the World Commercial Alliance!"</p>

  <p>Yudie seemed to have her mind made up. It was war indeed.</p>

  <p>Only then did Saint Morphens nod in approval. "I'll inform the World Commercial Alliance right away."</p>

  <p>It wasn't the Cloud Hall, but the World Commercial Alliance that was most anxious regarding the events that were about to go down.</p>

  <p>Cloud Hall still had the Small Circulation Killing Array to protect itself.</p>

  <p>Although the Heavenly Evil Sect would attack the Cloudy City and the Cloud Hall sooner or later, they were still much harder to deal with than the Oracle City and the World Commercial Alliance. In comparison, the World Commercial Alliance was located in the richest city in the world— Oracle City. The Heavenly Evil Sect could very possibly choose to attack the World Commercial Alliance first.</p>

  <p>The World Commercial Alliance had Ancient Tycoon and three leaders with unfathomable strength. Its power was comparable to that of a sixth-grade sect.</p>

  <p>However, facing both Eddie and the Heavenly Evil Sect was a totally different story. They didn't stand a chance on their own. That was why the World Commercial Alliance was eager to work with the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the transmission array connecting Cloudy City and Oracle City was still in good condition. Although the two cities were thousands of miles apart, they were just a transmission array away.</p>

  <p>A month had passed. It seemed like the longest month to ever happen.</p>

  <p>As Yudie floated out of her Ice Palace, she chanced by Margaret. Her gaze accidentally fell upon her.</p>

  <p>The young lady was sitting by the door of Zheng's cultivation room, cupping her face with one hand while staring at the door. She looked dazed.</p>

  <p>"Margaret is my woman!"</p>

  <p>Those words lingered in Yudie's ears. A part of her refused to believe that such words came out of Zheng's mouth.</p>

  <p>Yudie's face sank; envy could be seen in her eyes. If she could let go of her identity as the leader of Cloud Hall and wait for Zheng like Margaret did, she would feel very happy.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Margaret felt eyes on her from above. Slowly raising her head, she saw Yudie floating by not too far away from her.</p>

  <p>As the two women's gazes met, Margaret blinked and smiled at Yudie, revealing her white teeth to her.</p>

  <p>Upset, Yudie just snorted to herself and flew away. What a lost cause!</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Margaret turned her head back to look at Zheng's cultivation room once again, her face revealing a faint smile— the smile of a victor.</p>
