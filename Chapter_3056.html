<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>From the obscure void, the figure of a man slowly emerged. He was handsome and had arched brows which gave him the air of someone dignified.</p>

  <p>He glanced at Dorothy before addressing her impatiently, "Dora, why are you here in the Dragon City? You should be cultivating on the Origin Mountain."</p>

  <p>Looking at the man with her innocent gaze, she pointed to Luo Zheng and said with a smile, "I'm here to give my friend something."</p>

  <p>With the Origin Mountain covering for him, Luo Zheng knew that no more than ten people had the inside information? that he had removed a whirlpool in the Sea of Truth. Luo Zheng would gain fifteen million divine crystals by saving a Mice League member, and Dorothy was here to give him the money. She wouldn't reveal it to the outsiders.</p>

  <p>As she walked towards Luo Zheng, she reached for the space ring before stuffing it into his hand, winking at him. "If there's any swordsmanship manual that you fancy, tell me. I've also selected a token for you, but I forgot to give it to you," she said.</p>

  <p>A year ago, she had chosen the token of Truth of Cultivation Nature for Luo Zheng. But he hadn't returned to the Sea of Truth for a long time. And in the last few times he had been on the sea, he had been in such a hurry that she had forgotten to give it to him.</p>

  <p>Wilfred had been keeping a close eye on Luo Zheng. From his observations, he concluded that Luo Zheng was a man who had all the means necessary to afford the swordsmanship manuals that were offered. Over the past few years, few people had visited the Truth Library's third floor. Meeting a rich man who could afford the manuals there was hard to come by, and yet here was Dorothy offering a manual to him for free. How on earth could Wilfred be happy?</p>

  <p>"Dora, even if the Origin Mountain has copies of those supreme swordsmanship manuals, you can't do this. This is the Dragon City, after all," Wilfred reminded her.</p>

  <p>"What's the big deal? If it weren't for the Taiyi Heaven Palace, Grandma would have passed even the Origin Swordsmanship to him. We don't want any of your manuals!" Dorothy pouted her lips to drive her point home.</p>

  <p>"What?" Dorothy's words left Wilfred flabbergasted.</p>

  <p>Monica's body shook violently when she heard this.</p>

  <p>Although she was aware that Luo Zheng possessed quite the background, the Origin Swordsmanship was the most powerful skill ever achieved by the head of the Origin Mountain. This kind of token was only reserved for those who were descendants of the direct line.</p>

  <p>'It sounds like Luo Zheng had the chance to cultivate the Origin Swordsmanship, but was stopped by the Taiyi Heaven Palace. What happened?' Monica thought.</p>

  <p>Not being able to find out the truth, she sought comfort in knowing that Luo Zheng's background exceeded her expectations.</p>

  <p>Wilfred shared the same sentiments. He had thought that Luo Zheng was a member of a large clan who was blessed with an absurd number of divine crystals.</p>

  <p>But if what Dorothy said was true, then the entire situation was not at all what it seemed.</p>

  <p>Wilfred's expression changed in the blink of an eye as he wore a flattering smile. "These supreme swordsmanship manuals are the fruits of the Taiyi Heaven Palace's hard labor. Even if the Origin Mountain wants to pass a copy on to one of its disciples, it must consume merit points. You'll be pleased to know that I offer prices that are quite reasonable compared to precious merit points."</p>

  <p>Every cultivator who had used the manuals could easily be traced and tracked down. This prevented them from giving the manuals to others in private. If anyone was caught doing such a crime, they would be severely punished. Dorothy mentioned that she would send a copy to Luo Zheng. However, this would consume the Origin Mountain's merit points.</p>

  <p>"Grandma could care less about the merit points," Dorothy injected as she shared her grandma's opinion as well.</p>

  <p>"Well, perhaps we can negotiate. I'll offer you a 20% discount for the supreme swordsmanship manuals. What do you say?" Wilfred proposed to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Dora, thank you for your help. But since I'm in the Dragon City, I intend to stay in it by following its rules," Luo Zheng addressed her.</p>

  <p>Although he didn't bear a grudge against the Origin Mountain after Dorothy's words, Luo Zheng had no intention of owing the mountain too many favors.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing his determination, Dorothy said, "A measly 20% off is nothing. It should be at least 60% off!"</p>

  <p>"That's outrageous! It's an insult to all the manuals that we possess,"</p>

  <p>Wilfred scoffed in protest.</p>

  <p>"Alright then. 50% off!"</p>

  <p>"No. 30%!"</p>

  <p>Thanks to her glib tongue, Dorothy managed to help Luo Zheng get a 40% discount.</p>

  <p>Wilfred decided to give in for Dorothy's sake. He accepted the price knowing that, even if she decided to request a copy, the merit points required to pay it off were equal to the original price at 50% off.</p>

  <p>Monica was surprised by what had just happened. A 40% discount would certainly save Luo Zheng tons of divine crystals. She was intrigued by the woman who had just bargained with the Truth Library's owner so skillfully.</p>

  <p>After the discount was confirmed, Luo Zheng began to choose. His first selection was the Divine Dao Blending Swordsmanship.</p>

  <p>Although he possessed the Imperial Sword Seal, using it on the Soaring Snake Sword would increase the risk of revealing his true identity. If the Divine Dao Blending Swordsmanship could enhance the Ways-blending Strike's power, then he would certainly prioritize it.</p>

  <p>"Why not choose a token based on the Truth of the Divine Dao? Why do you only wish to have a token based on the Divine Dao?" Dorothy inquired.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was observing all the light columns one by one. He had memorized the supreme swordsmanship manuals and so when his gaze fell upon the ninth light column, he knew exactly what it was? the Nine-Flash Light-splitting Swordsmanship. It was very powerful, and it didn't require the support of the Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>"I'll take this one too," Luo Zheng announced.</p>

  <p>He had managed to strike a bargain by purchasing two supreme swordsmanship manuals with 3.2 million divine crystals.</p>

  <p>To an ordinary person, this would seem like an absurd amount. To Luo Zheng, however, this was nothing. He still had lots of divine crystals left in addition to the space ring that Dorothy just gave him which was equivalent to fifteen million divine crystals.</p>

  <p>The yellow paper which recorded the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent also piqued his interest. However, he had no intention of borrowing it this time.</p>

  <p>Once Luo Zheng finished selecting, the three of them left the third floor together.</p>

  <p>Before leaving, he turned around and asked, "Could I possibly get a 40% discount on the second-floor swordsmanship manuals too?"</p>

  <p>Before Wilfred could open his mouth, Dorothy already answered for him.</p>

  <p>"Certainly! I wouldn't want any of the manuals on that floor anyway. I think a 90% discount will be more suitable."</p>

  <p>Wilfred smiled bitterly. People always talked about how the Origin Mountain head's granddaughter was blessed with both charm and cunning, and today he just witnessed it first-hand. He replied, "40%. That's final.</p>

  <p>Alas! I've lost heavily today."</p>

  <p>As he roamed the second floor, Luo Zheng managed to select eight truth swordsmanship manuals. These were prepared specifically for the disciples of the Sword Light Palace, including Elgin and Beldene.</p>

  <p>In fact, one of the Flag Master's responsibilities was to purchase swordsmanship manuals for their people. Most of them limited their selections to those on the first floor.</p>

  <p>Only Alliance Chiefs would be as generous as Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Once finished with his selections on the second floor, they made their way down to the first floor. It was abundant with free manuals which required only little talent to use. The massive number of manuals left Dorothy baffled with how many manuals the Taiyi Heaven Palace really contained.</p>

  <p>With this realization, she couldn't offer any advice to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, Monica proved to be quite knowledgeable and skilled as she quickly recommended seventy to eighty manuals to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Just as the trio was about to leave the Truth Library, they heard a strange voice. "Huh? Is that the Dragon City's youngest Flag Master? He's selecting swordsmanship manuals!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng raised his head towards the voice's direction and realized it was Harden. He was accompanied by a row of disciples who were adorned in white robes. Galen gave Luo Zheng an evil smile.</p>

  <p>What was Harden doing in the Dragon City? He wasn't a Flag Master. How did he manage to get in?</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng was pondering on this, Harden gazed longingly at Dorothy. His eyes lit up and his heart rate began to pick up. "I've never seen such a beauty before on your team until now."</p>

  <p>Harden inched closer to the group. Letting out a little chuckle, he addressed Dorothy by saying, "I don't think following this guy is such a good idea, beauty. His death is imminent. Let me introduce myself. Harden Zhao, future Flag Master. I'll make you an offer you can't refuse. Join me and your future will be set in stone as a bright, promising one!"</p>
