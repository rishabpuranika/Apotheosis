  <p>
</p>

  <p>It was as if a light bulb switched itself on inside Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>The Truth of Godly Way was extremely complicated to begin with.</p>

  <p>One had to continually recite it in order to uncover the truth and engrave it deeply into the soul.</p>

  <p>If one was unable to handle the Truth of Godly Way, they would naturally not be able to recite it thus making it impossible to memorize the ten thousand words by rote. Only by comprehending the meaning would one be able to truly recite and memorize it.</p>

  <p>The more words, the more insights one could get on the Truth of Godly Way, and the more the soul was influenced.</p>

  <p>Memorization was no easy feat. Even an outstanding consummate True God like Augustus couldn't take the pressure of the Truth Godly Way and passed out quite frequently.</p>

  <p>The moment Zheng attained enlightenment, all that unbearable pressure quickly disappeared.</p>

  <p>Reciting the Truth of Cultivation Nature after that was so easy and as he did so, Zheng felt as if his soul entered a strange world.</p>

  <p>It was as if he was within a desolate ocean.</p>

  <p>Specks of crystal light were scattered on the surface of an endless, blue sea.</p>

  <p>As he took a step, an illusory boat appeared beneath his feet. There was a sense of safety that rose in his heart as he boarded the boat that would help him cross the boundless sea.</p>

  <p>In the side hall, everyone stared at Zheng in a daze.</p>

  <p>Augustus was very fidgety in his anxiousness while Hallet tried his best to calm his mind.</p>

  <p>Zheng's pupils had lost all their luster.</p>

  <p>He was staring blankly at the text on the Truth of Cultivation Nature, reciting it slowly and constantly, "If we don't sit in meditation, don't get jealous of the general things, don't...."</p>

  <p>"This guy... has recited three thousand words!" Augustus exclaimed.</p>

  <p>After breaking through the bottleneck, Augustus had been able to recite three thousand and five hundred words. He was greatly ahead in the comprehension of the Truth of Cultivation Nature compared to Hallet and Zheng.</p>

  <p>"No. I can't let this guy surpass me. He is just a low-rank True God..."</p>

  <p>Not willing to get beaten, Augustus also began to recite out loud.</p>

  <p>The comprehension of the Truth of Godly Way required full devotion of both mind and body. Augustus had to give it his all and could not afford to be distracted.</p>

  <p>The more anxious he was, the harder it would be for him. Unfortunately, he had already been quite buzzed with excitement early on.</p>

  <p>A few moments later, he felt dizzy as the pressure his soul had to bear doubled. He had to stop or risk being unwell.</p>

  <p>As for Zheng...</p>

  <p>The young man seemed to have forgotten the world around him.</p>

  <p>He could only feel himself and the Truth of Cultivation Nature.</p>

  <p>As Zheng continued reciting, the boat underneath his feet grew larger and sturdier.</p>

  <p>"Four thousand words..." Hallet's eyebrows twitched.</p>

  <p>Augustus was rendered speechless.</p>

  <p>His greatest pride was his unparalleled talent. It was main reason why he became one of Bromley's disciples after all.</p>

  <p>Previously, Augustus thought Zheng was qualified to also become Bromley's disciple solely because of his special physique. The young man, after all, was only a secondary creature. The gap between him and Zheng was simply enormous in his opinion.</p>

  <p>It was only now that Augustus realized that Zheng's talent was actually way above his!</p>

  <p>Another five minutes passed...</p>

  <p>"Four thousand and five hundred words," Hallet remarked in wonder. "I wonder where his limit is?"</p>

  <p>"Joy said her limit was 4900 words which is already half the passage of the Truth of Godly Way. Perhaps his limit will be about the same,"</p>

  <p>Augustus murmured. It was only a bit more than his own limit. Augustus thought that maybe he would still be able to catch up.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng continued reciting the passage at moderate speed.</p>

  <p>At that moment, he saw an illusion appear before his very eyes.</p>

  <p>The boat had gotten bigger. A mast, rail, and paddle appeared one after the other and integrated themselves onto the vessel.</p>

  <p>Everything looked harmonious as the Truth Boat slowly came together.</p>

  <p>"Four thousand and seven-hundred words," Hallet said with a smile. He was glad to see the depressed expression on Gus' face. Getting beaten every once in a while was good. It should remind him that there was always someone better than him.</p>

  <p>Augustus scoffed with disdain. "What's so special about it? I'm pretty sure he won't be able to pass 4900 words. I'll catch up to him soon enough!"</p>

  <p>"Four thousand and eight hundred words..."</p>

  <p>"Four thousand and nine hundred words..."</p>

  <p>Hallet, like Augustus, also thought that Zheng would reach his limit at 4900 words.</p>

  <p>That amount was originally considered as a pass and the vast majority of cultivators of the Truth of Godly Way would get stuck at this milestone.</p>

  <p>The only way to get past it was through more years of cultivation.</p>

  <p>At this moment, a trace of nervousness and slight anticipation flashed in Hallet's and Augustus' eyes. Both listened attentively to Zheng's voice to know if their assumptions would be correct.</p>

  <p>To their surprise, the young man retained his speed and continued reciting in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"Five... five thousand words already..." Hallet couldn't help but murmur in amazement.</p>

  <p>"This guy! Ah..." Augustus also cried out, not quite believing it either.</p>

  <p>His talent had initially been the best out of all of his master's disciples'.</p>

  <p>His master even said at one point that Augustus' talent could be ranked in the top three among the consummate True Gods in the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>It was rare to see a man with such amazing talent in the divine land.</p>

  <p>He also did what he could to help Zheng in his cultivation since they were both fellow disciples, however, the talent Zheng displayed was a bit hard to swallow for him.</p>

  <p>After a short while...</p>

  <p>"Six thousand words," Hallet announced calmly but the light in his eyes glistened. "Our master does have an eye for talent. We can never hope to be his match in this aspect. I wonder what he would think if he knew about Zheng's performance."</p>

  <p>Augustus merely stared at Zheng in a daze, completely numb to everything.</p>

  <p>"Seven thousand words..."</p>

  <p>"Eight thousand words..."</p>

  <p>Zheng had now reached a higher level.</p>

  <p>A faint, white luster now radiated off his body.</p>

  <p>This luster was pure and seemed to merge with everything.</p>

  <p>After reciting eight thousand words, Zheng finally stopped and closed his eyes. He was still cross-legged and now appeared to be in meditation.</p>

  <p>"It won't be long until he fully comprehends the Truth of Cultivation Nature... He is just a low-rank True God but his talent is already so extraordinary," Hallet could only sigh.</p>

  <p>Augustus stared at Zheng meditating and couldn't help himself. "He's cheating! His son cheated and he is cheating too!"</p>

  <p>When Geoffrey completely deciphered the Truth of Godly Way, Augustus thought it was definitely ridiculous. Those golden Sanskrit words had been left behind by their master and there was no way a mere boy like Geoffrey would be able to decipher them. Augustus just simply refused to believe it.</p>

  <p>But now, right in front of him, Zheng had actually comprehended the Truth of Cultivation Nature to such an extent. It was a tough pill for Augustus to swallow.</p>

  <p>At that moment, a loud noise came from outside the side hall. It was Geoffrey who came in with the puppet Augustus had given him.</p>

  <p>This puppet made him quite happy and he took it with him everywhere he went around the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>"Hush!" Hallet signaled to Geoffrey. Zheng was in his meditative state and he didn't want anyone to disturb him.</p>

  <p>"Where's my father?" Geoffrey asked. His eyes swept the entire room but he didn't see him.</p>

  <p>Augustus pointed at Zheng. "There! Can't you see?"</p>

  <p>Zheng sat upright on the floor but under the influence of the Truth of Cultivation Nature, he could appear as a chair or even a pillar in this room.</p>

  <p>If one did not look closely, then it would be difficult to notice his existence.</p>

  <p>This was the natural magic of the Truth of Cultivation Nature.</p>
