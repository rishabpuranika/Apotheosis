  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was a bit surprised that Lincoln had taken the effort to come and visit him.</p>

  <p>The reason why he had decided to deliberately succumb to defeat before Lincoln was that he felt that Layla's experiences were somewhat similar to his.</p>

  <p>However, the issues Luo Zheng was facing were even more troublesome. As of that moment, he didn't have the slightest idea of Yan's whereabouts.</p>

  <p>Although he had used the Roaring Token to shout throughout the entire universe, his efforts went in vain.</p>

  <p>Lincoln was also a straightforward person. After he'd arrived, he bowed quite low before Luo Zheng to express his sincere gratitude.</p>

  <p>It might have been a trivial matter as far as Luo Zheng was concerned, but for Lincoln, the meaning of gaining his freedom was extraordinary.</p>

  <p>Sometime ago, he had offended the son of a Supreme Lord and was exiled to the Villain World. Hence, his future prospects were practically ruined. A meagre lifespan of just 800 years was too short for warriors, but now having obtained freedom was an extensively fortunate thing for him.</p>

  <p>Layla, on the other hand, sat quietly by her brother's side. Feelings originating inside her were naturally very complicated.</p>

  <p>From the moment she entered the Mist Palace, she had treated Luo Zheng as her opponent, and she had provoked him very frequently. However, he remained unmoved no matter what, and he had gone to great lengths to help her brother obtain his freedom.</p>

  <p>"This time, I've come here almost entirely for the sake of my sister. But I have another important matter to discuss with you!" Lincoln cupped his hands and said.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" Luo Zheng seemed to be faintly surprised. He was under the impression that Lincoln had arrived only to thank him.</p>

  <p>Lincoln's eyes flashed, his face revealing a trace of vigilance. He extended his hand and took out a light yellow divine texture. After pouring his life vitality into it, an invisible enchanted barrier began to spread out, enveloping the three of them within it.</p>

  <p>Noticing that Lincoln was being overly cautious, Luo Zheng was intrigued.</p>

  <p>What exactly was so important that he needed to be this cautious?</p>

  <p>After that, Lincoln cupped his hands again and said, "If this was occurring some time ago, I wouldn't have told anyone about this even if my life was at risk. But you are different. You are my life saver."</p>

  <p>"Please say it." Zheng's curiosity had just skyrocketed.</p>

  <p>He patiently heard Lincoln narrate his adventurous tales.</p>

  <p>After Lincoln had been sent to the Villain World, he had been placed under extremely dangerous and volatile situations.</p>

  <p>The Villain World was earlier a very prosperous supreme world.</p>

  <p>Moreover, it was a famous supreme world in the universe.</p>

  <p>However, after hundreds of millions of years of exploitation, the resources of the entire Villain World had depleted rapidly, and some sects of the Villain World had decided to flee from that place. In the end, the entire supreme world became a place of exile, and warriors who were convicted of serious crimes were exiled to this place.</p>

  <p>The entire Villain World was in a state of absolute chaos. After all, the majority of the warriors residing there were notorious evildoers. There were no existing rules at all. It was common for them to kill each other in order to survive.</p>

  <p>When he had just entered the Villain World, Lincoln himself had suffered greatly. His own life had to be risked many times.</p>

  <p>Perhaps, he was indeed a lucky person after all. When he was being chased by his opponents, he had accidentally entered a cave and found the clue to the Dark World's secret treasures.</p>

  <p>Zheng's face appeared to show his excitement. "The Dark World's secret treasures?"</p>

  <p>"Yes!" Lincoln's eyes lit up. "That's why I want to invite you to explore this place with me!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's face showed a hint of hesitation. He did not know what the Dark World's secret treasures were, but the nervousness on Lincoln's face helped him figure out that it was no small matter. Therefore, he was confused about what to do.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Xun told him in his mind, "Agree to his request, Luo Zheng."</p>

  <p>"Hmm? Why?"</p>

  <p>"Promise him now. We'll talk later."</p>

  <p>Since Xun insisted, Luo Zheng no longer had any hesitation. She rarely gave advice to him, but since she had taken the effort to open her mouth, there must have been a legitimate reason for it.</p>

  <p>There weren't many people who could gain the complete trust of Luo Zheng, and Xun was one of them.</p>

  <p>Lincoln naturally didn't know what Zheng's thoughts were. As far as his knowledge was concerned, the secret treasures of the Dark World were of great importance. No one, not even a world lord, had any reason to reject him.</p>

  <p>It was a pity that Luo Zheng didn't know much about the Upper World. When he heard about the secret treasures of the Dark World, he was neither intrigued nor interested. It was because of Xun that he agreed to be a part of this.</p>

  <p>Then, Lincoln handed over a pre-drawn map to Luo Zheng and told him, "In half a year, we will reach the Dark World. We will meet at the location marked on the map."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng took the map and examined it for a moment before asking, "Where is the Dark World?"</p>

  <p>Hearing this question that involved common sense, Lincoln was slightly stunned. How could there be a warrior who didn't know where the Dark World was located? This was awfully weird.</p>

  <p>Next to him, Layla burst out in laughter. "Lincoln, Luo Zheng had ascended from the Lower World just a while ago. You need to help him."</p>

  <p>A smile appeared on Zheng's face when he found out the location of the Dark World. He hadn't thought that the Dark World would be adjacent to the Spirit Reading World, which was the supreme world that he had ascended to.</p>

  <p>The Spirit Reading World was originally the border region of the alliance's 3, 000 supreme worlds, and the other side of the Dark World was no longer the territory of the alliance.</p>

  <p>The distance between the supreme world where he found himself in at present and the Dark World was so long that it would probably take several months even if one were to travel across borders continuously.</p>

  <p>Only then did Luo Zheng understand why Lincoln had proposed to meet in the Dark World after half a year.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng wouldn't go back on his word.</p>

  <p>After the brother and sister left, Luo Zheng asked Xun, "Xun, what's wrong with the secret treasures of the Dark World? Why did you wish my presence in this team?"</p>

  <p>Hearing his innocent question, Xun gradually condensed in front of Luo Zheng. She smiled slightly before uttering, "The secret treasures of the Dark World were a legend from an hundred thousand years ago.</p>

  <p>However, as the person involved, I happen to know some of the secrets within. There are some things that are quite important to you."</p>

  <p>"I don't know if this warrior named Lincoln really has a way to obtain the secret treasures, but it's certainly worth a try."</p>

  <p>Hearing Xun's words, Luo Zheng silently nodded his head in approval.</p>

  <p>He couldn't have stayed at the Mist Palace to cultivate forever.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, he had promised Xun that he would help her return to the throne.</p>

  <p>Half a year's time was simply too short for the warriors of the Upper World. In order to travel through the supreme worlds, one had to travel for months, and after a simple preparation, Luo Zheng bid farewell to Yolande.</p>

  <p>Yolande was not at all astonished by Zheng's abrupt departure. Even the warriors of the thirteenth palaces would look for an opportunity to go out and train, not to mention the fact that she had promised Luo Zheng that she would not give him much restraint from the very beginning.</p>

  <p>Without further delay, Luo Zheng quietly left the Mist Palace and barged into the supreme world channel.</p>
