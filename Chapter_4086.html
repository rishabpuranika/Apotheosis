  <p>
</p>

  <p>The instant the Thirteen Teeth Necklace draped around his neck, the Monkey Spirit King, who had been restless, suddenly became serene.</p>

  <p>His originally cloudy eyes gradually turned clear, and they filled with great wisdom.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Sewell quickly slid down from the shoulder of the Monkey Spirit King.</p>

  <p>"Master Sewell, does this mean the Monkey Spirit King has awakened now?" the Eye Spirit asked worriedly.</p>

  <p>Anyone, upon seeing the Monkey Spirit King's crystal eyes, would suspect that he had awakened if they didn't know the truth.</p>

  <p>"Not so fast," Sewell cautioned with a chuckle.</p>

  <p>Then he slithered and twisted his body.</p>

  <p>The Sanskrit words painted all over the snake began to flicker in a rapid succession.</p>

  <p>As Sewell continued to coil his body, the three-colored rope that had strung the thirteen wolf teeth together now began to jiggle around the Monkey Spirit King's neck.</p>

  <p>A strand of rope separated from the cord and penetrated into the base of the Monkey Spirit King's skull.</p>

  <p>If something else had penetrated the Monkey Spirit King's body, he would've rejected it automatically. However, the Thirteen Teeth Necklace was the most cherished treasure to him, so he had no qualms at all about the three-colored rope extended into his brain!</p>

  <p>After the three-colored strand bored into the back of his head, it began to unravel inside.</p>

  <p>One single strand was subdivided into three, and then three into nine, followed by nine into eighty-one...</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, tens of thousands of three-colored strands unraveled inside the Monkey Spirit King's head. These strands formed thin needles that pierced into his brain one by one.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King abruptly raised his head, and then he lifted and stamped his left foot.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The entire hall shook violently, and even the Eye Spirit was startled by this unexpected action.</p>

  <p>"Don't panic. That is merely a reflex reaction as the Three Resentments Poison infiltrates deeper into his brain..." Sewell explained. "Slowly, the Three Resentments Poison will assume control over his hands, feet, and then his entire body..."</p>

  <p>While he was explaining, the Monkey Spirit King lifted and stamped his right foot.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The hall began reverberating with the shock.</p>

  <p>Once the Monkey Spirit King had stamped both his feet, he suddenly rose from his throne and took a stride forward!</p>

  <p>The Eye Spirit and Sewell were both within range of the Monkey Spirit King's next footfall.</p>

  <p>"Fall back!"</p>

  <p>Seeing the huge sole of a raised foot coming towards them, Sewell had his expression changed slightly.</p>

  <p>He and the Eye Spirit quickly rushed out of reach to avoid being trampled.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>After taking two ponderous steps forward, the Monkey Spirit King became immobile again.</p>

  <p>After seeing the Monkey Spirit King's mechanical movements, the Eye Spirit could venture a guess regarding the workings of the Three Resentments Poison.</p>

  <p>The Three Resentments Poison could assume control over the Monkey Spirit King's unconscious body, making him become like a puppet on a string.</p>

  <p>However, once the Monkey Spirit King regained his consciousness, it would be a piece of cake for him to assume control over his body, given his formidable strength.</p>

  <p>Although he felt it was impolite to doubt Sewell, he still decided to voice his doubts.</p>

  <p>Sewell hissed and chuckled. "Of course, it would be impossible to take control of the great Monkey Spirit King with merely the Three Resentments Poison," he said. "During this process, we'll have to erase all of his memories!"</p>

  <p>"Is that even possible?" the Eye Spirit asked in awe.</p>

  <p>"We can't do it at other times, but we can achieve that during the process of his awakening," Sewell replied, looking at the Eye Spirit. "There's no need for you to fret. We're well prepared for this whole process."</p>

  <p>The Snake Masters had been making their preparations for this plan for countless years, and they had considered anything that the Eye Spirit could think of.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the Monkey Spirit King's consciousness remained in a blur.</p>

  <p>He had been slumbering for a very, very long time, having sunk into a deep and infinite dream.</p>

  <p>This dream was like being wrapped in shackles that he could not resist.</p>

  <p>Despite being the great Monkey Spirit King, he was unable to break free from it.</p>

  <p>However, he was crystal clear about one thing: he had died in the chaos.</p>

  <p>He required something to return him to life and wake him up. That something was the Thirteen Teeth Necklace; his most cherished treasure, which had been his possession for countless years.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King would have been unable to lead all his subordinates or form one part of the Four Spirits Sect without his thirteen greatest theurgies.</p>

  <p>'Bring my powers back!</p>

  <p>Bring them back to me!</p>

  <p>My descendants, you must find them for me!'</p>

  <p>For countless years, the Monkey Spirit King had been making these calls night and day.</p>

  <p>Any creature within a 10, 000-mile range of him would hear his calls.</p>

  <p>His calls penetrated through the dreamland and echoed within everyone's minds.</p>

  <p>At first, his calls had elicited positive responses. After the first couple of chaotic eras, he had seen the first wolf tooth appearing at the edge of the dreamland.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King had celebrated this. His descendants had begun to move on his behalf!</p>

  <p>After about twenty more chaotic eras, they discovered the second wolf tooth for him.</p>

  <p>Another fifty chaotic eras passed, and the third wolf tooth was found...</p>

  <p>The progress was painfully slow, but the Monkey Spirit King held on to the hope of his revival.</p>

  <p>Given the speed at which his descendants collected the wolf teeth, they could collect all of them in about three hundred chaotic eras.</p>

  <p>Finally, he would then be able to leave this damned 'dream.'</p>

  <p>But the next development disappointed him.</p>

  <p>After the third wolf tooth had been found, the fourth one didn't appear for a long time.</p>

  <p>This was a bad omen.</p>

  <p>Had something disastrous befallen his descendants?</p>

  <p>Had they given up on helping him find the remaining wolf teeth?</p>

  <p>He repeated his echoing calls to the outside world again and again, enticing them to look for the wolf teeth. But from that point on, the remaining wolf teeth never appeared.</p>

  <p>After another lengthy period of time, the Monkey Spirit King sensed a special and powerful bloodline, and it had the aura of a blended bloodline.</p>

  <p>This aura could also penetrate through the dreamland, and he felt it.</p>

  <p>However, this new presence didn't please the Monkey Spirit King, instead, it further disappointed him.</p>

  <p>It meant that his descendants had failed to locate the remaining wolf teeth and had started to look for an alternative solution.</p>

  <p>But any alternative plans were doomed to fail!</p>

  <p>The thirteen kinds of blended bloodlines were rare combinations of the ancestry-level bloodline's abilities.</p>

  <p>It was no small feat to form a stable blended bloodline. Even the Monkey Spirit King himself would have found it hard to recreate the thirteen different blended bloodlines he possessed.</p>

  <p>Besides, his descendants were now living in the chaos, and they couldn't return to the main world.</p>

  <p>He waited in dismay for many more chaotic eras.</p>

  <p>Except for the occasional instance of a blended bloodline or two, he could no longer sense the presence of a new wolf tooth.</p>

  <p>Another thousand chaotic eras rolled away. Then, suddenly, the Monkey Spirit King sensed the fourth wolf tooth!</p>

  <p>His hope was rekindled after more than one thousand chaotic eras!</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King was overcome with excitement.</p>

  <p>This dream resembled a prison, and it required thirteen keys to open it!</p>

  <p>Hope shone in the Monkey Spirit King's mind again.</p>

  <p>He didn't mind the long wait. As long as the number of wolf teeth multiplied, he would find new hope all the time.</p>

  <p>But after only a short span of time, the Monkey Spirit King was surprised to sense all nine remaining wolf teeth!</p>

  <p>All of the thirteen wolf teeth had been located!</p>

  <p>They had formed a circle, and floated together at the edge of the dreamland.</p>

  <p>"I am Orlando! King of all monkey spirits! I will return to you today!" the Monkey Spirit King roared with excitement, the echoes of his voice spreading throughout the dreamland.</p>

  <p>He expected the wolf teeth floating around the edge of the dreamland to come into focus in his mind.</p>

  <p>The power of these thirteen wolf teeth would penetrate into the dreamland, returning him to life.</p>

  <p>But soon, the Monkey Spirit King discovered something was amiss. The three-colored rope stringing the wolf teeth together was emitting a strange aura.</p>

  <p>More importantly, the wolf teeth didn't come into focus in his eyes but remained blurry.</p>

  <p>A sense of ill-boding rose in the Monkey Spirit King's mind.</p>
