  <p>
</p>

  <p>Pascal didn't quite know what happened.</p>

  <p>However, if Sheridan was really dead, it was a matter of great importance.</p>

  <p>According to the rules set by the wealthy clans on the Floating Islands, sub-branches' disciples along with the noncore disciples could die. But the killer was to be severely dealt with if one of the core disciples died.</p>

  <p>Due to Sheridan's high position in the Xie Clan, the clan members wouldn't let his death slide so easily.</p>

  <p>Pascal had his eyes fixed upon Luo Zheng. "My name is Tianxing Luo," Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>"Did you kill Sheridan?" Pascal asked Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Pascal didn't know much about Sheridan. Although Sheridan had performed well in the core disciples of the wealthy clans, his efforts weren't enough to get Pascal's attention.</p>

  <p>Almost all the members of the wealthy clans were quite powerful.</p>

  <p>Sheridan was a low-rank True God, while Luo Zheng was only a proving godly warrior. The thought that a proving godly warrior killed a low-rank True God confused Pascal.</p>

  <p>"I killed Sheridan," Luo Zheng replied seriously.</p>

  <p>It wasn't Zheng's intentions to run from the fact that he killed Sheridan.</p>

  <p>"Why did you kill him?" Pascal questioned.</p>

  <p>Aleyna quickly rushed to Zheng's aid and said, "You ask him why? Don't you know the answer to it yourself? It's not his fault," Aleyna stated.</p>

  <p>Pascal had a rough idea as to what might have happened, even though he was not present there.</p>

  <p>Pascal was one of the most dignified disciples in the younger generations. He enjoyed a high position in the Han Clan. All the elders of the Han Clan respected him dearly. Although, his two younger sisters weren't afraid of confronting him from time to time.</p>

  <p>Aleyna angrily confronted Pascal but was unable to get a reaction from him.</p>

  <p>Han Liusu intervened and said, "This is not the time to play the blame game."</p>

  <p>Everyone looked at Han Liusu as she finished speaking.</p>

  <p>The fingermarks on her face were long gone but her pretty little face was swollen.</p>

  <p>Pascal's heart was filled with sorrow when he saw Liusu's face. He took out a bunch of emerald green grass from his Sumeru Space. In the middle of the grass was a blooming flower, and in the middle of the stamens was a small human face.</p>

  <p>The human face in the middle of the grass screamed as Pascal squashed and crushed it. Then he put it on Liusu's face.</p>

  <p>This healed Liusu's face and her swelling subsided.</p>

  <p>"I know, but someone has to take some responsibility for this," Pascal said with a serious tone.</p>

  <p>Pascal was quite neutral as far as Luo Zheng was concerned. Since he killed Sheridan, he should face the repercussions of his actions.</p>

  <p>As the core disciple of the Han Clan, he always prioritized the interests of his clan.</p>

  <p>Han Liusu gave her brother a stern look. She was aware of what Pascal was thinking and said, "Tianxing has fought for us. Wouldn't you take that into consideration?"</p>

  <p>"He shouldn't have killed Sheridan even if he protected you by doing so.</p>

  <p>Sheridan didn't deserve to die." Aleyna and Han Liusu were both frightened yet composed. They both knew that this matter was so serious that the Holy Emperors of Xie Clan and the Han Clan could get involved in it.</p>

  <p>"You mean Tianxing should have just stood there and shouldn't have done anything?" Aleyna sneered.</p>

  <p>Kelsey, who was standing behind Aleyna didn't say much. She knew that Pascal wasn't right but since he was only her cousin, she didn't have the right to say anything to Pascal, face to face.</p>

  <p>"The elders only look at the result and not the process. The truth is that Sheridan was killed by Tianxing and Tianxing emerged unscathed from the whole situation," Pascal stated.</p>

  <p>"You should understand how detestable those people are,"</p>

  <p>Aleyna argued.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Han Liusu interrupted and said, "I will stand by Tianxing no matter what. If he dies, so will I."</p>

  <p>Han Liusu stated with a firm tone, much to everyone's surprise.</p>

  <p>"What did you say?" Pascal asked with concern in his voice.</p>

  <p>"Han Liusu..." Aleyna finally understood what was really going on with her sister.</p>

  <p>Ever since they returned from the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, Aleyna felt that her sister had been acting weirdly. She stopped spending much time with her and mainly focused on martial arts, and thus, did quite good in the arena.</p>

  <p>Nothing caught Liusu's eye except for cultivation, but every time they recalled their time in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, her eyes lit up when she mentioned Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Thus, Aleyna finally understood that her sister had fallen in love with Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Now that she had seen through Tianxing's identity, she was able to understand the reason why Han Liusu said those words for Tianxing.</p>

  <p>However, Pascal didn't know much about the whole situation. Liusu's words came as an utter shock to him.</p>

  <p>Pascal was born in the Han Clan. The importance Han Liusu had in his heart was much more than that of all the outer disciples added. 'Why would Han Liusu be willing to die for an outsider?' he wondered. Besides, it was of the knowledge that this disciple had only entered the Floating Island of the Han Clan for a very little amount of time.</p>

  <p>Kelsey felt a bit confused as well. Tianxing had gotten into such a big trouble because he had helped her and Aleyna. Pascal wanted to sacrifice Tianxing to help the Han Clan get rid of the problem. Kelsey knew that Pascal was in the wrong here, but she didn't get such an intense reaction like Han Liusu did.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng lay on the ground; wriggling his body so that his blood and primordial energy could flow in order to heal his wounds. He was impressed by Liusu's determination and strength. The current situation was beyond his expectation, and he could only wait and see how things would go on.</p>

  <p>"You would go to such extreme in order to save a proving godly warrior?" Pascal tried to persuade Han Liusu.</p>

  <p>"Pascal, you know me well. You know that I won't budge from I said earlier" Han Liusu argued.</p>

  <p>It was a known fact that Pascal wasn't afraid of anyone or anything. He had once fought with a top-rank True God in the forbidden land and came back, every part of his body broken. He even once disobeyed his father, the Holy Emperor of the Han Clan and went to an enormous forbidden land to save people.</p>

  <p>Although, he cared a lot for his two sisters. They meant the world to him.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Liusu's constant efforts stopped him from taking any decision. "I can't deal with this myself. Let's ask the elders of our clan to make the decision," Pascal proclaimed, his gaze directed towards Kelsey.</p>

  <p>Kelsey's father was the current leader of the Han Clan, Alfredo Han.</p>

  <p>At that night...</p>

  <p>Zheng's injuries healed at a rapid pace. Grant, who had helped Luo Zheng get better was quite surprised by how quickly he could recover. After Luo Zheng fully recovered, Grant tied him with a rope and sent him to the Spiritual Heart Hall in the Han Clan's Floating Island. dozens of top-rank True Gods lined up in the Spiritual Heart Hall and on the floating platform at the top of the hall stood several warriors who were at the consummation of True God Realm.</p>

  <p>Although these masters hid their breath, a strong Mu Ning was developing in the Spiritual Heart Hall. All the masters fixed their eyes on Luo Zheng as he made his way through the hall. They were curious as to find out who was the outer disciple that was able to cause such a commotion by killing Sheridan.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng felt quite nervous as he saw all those eyes were fixed on him. He still mustered the courage to look up.</p>

  <p>"Sheridan was pretty close to the top rankings of the low-rank True Gods. How can this guy kill him as he is only a proving godly warrior from the outside the Floating Island?"</p>

  <p>When people present there heard this, their faces dropped with utter shock.</p>

  <p>Once warriors had obtained the Godly Way, the Godly Tile had raised their own cultivation too much. Therefore, it was quite hard for this proving godly warrior to kill someone with a Godly Tile. Even among the children of the wealthy clans on the Floating Islands, only few were able to cross the gap. People wouldn't believe it if they heard that a little fellow from outside the Floating Island could kill a low-rank True God.</p>
