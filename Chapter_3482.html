  <p>
</p>

  <p>When he was in the divine land, the golden light Luo Zheng radiated was strong enough to hurt his opponents.</p>

  <p>However, that kind of power was no longer enough when he reached the Source World. Luo Zheng was far more powerful than before. A casual blow from him now was a thousand times as powerful as what he used to be capable of when he fought with all his might.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng stopped, he let out a sharp curse under his breath. The aura of Truth of Divine Dao was still as strong as it ever was, rather than disappeared. It was actually flowing along his meridians and converging into the spots of light all over his body.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>The spots of light within Luo Zheng's body glowed even more fiercely after absorbing the aura of Truth of Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?" No. 9527 asked.</p>

  <p>"The Chaotic Source Spirits are absorbing my truth aura!" Luo Zheng replied in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"How could that happen?" No. 9527 replied doubtfully.</p>

  <p>The Chaotic Source Spirit was not like any Other Shore Token. In fact, it was an exception, just like the giant eye in the Chaotic Source World, though no one had yet figured out exactly how that worked.</p>

  <p>But one thing was certain. The Chaotic Source Spirit could not be borne as an Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>That meant that there was no way to communicate with it through the Truth of Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's sudden findings confused No. 9527. It had never encountered a situation like this before.</p>

  <p>It had just said that the power of the Chaotic Source Spirits couldn't grow rapidly. This frustrated Luo Zheng. How long would it take to reach the level of Qiu Yinhe, or even Fuxi? He just didn't know.</p>

  <p>But after the spots of light absorbed the truth aura, the Chaotic Source Spirits seemed to become somehow stronger. Luo Zheng felt like he had seen a shortcut appear out of nowhere. He was so excited that he activated the Green Jade chessboard.</p>

  <p>Using the Other Shore Power to summon the truth aura from the corporeal body was quite inefficient.</p>

  <p>But using some object to do that was another matter entirely.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng's fingers gently stroked the chessboard, Green Jade sculptures appeared around him one by one.</p>

  <p>"Ten should be enough!"</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng gently moved the chess pieces along the chessboard with a single finger, the sculptures sprang into action. The largest one held him aloft, while the other nine sculptures began to hammer on him with their fists.</p>

  <p>"Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!"</p>

  <p>Thanks to the violent blows he received from the Green Jade sculptures, a golden light surrounded his body. The light increased in size and intensity, and eventually engulfed the Green Jade sculptures.</p>

  <p>But because the sculptures were quite tough, the golden light couldn't hurt them too much.</p>

  <p>The attacks caused muffled sounds to circle in the air over the palace.</p>

  <p>The sounds shook the Li Shan mountain guards out of their reverie.</p>

  <p>"Aren't we going to find out what that is?" a guard asked his chief in confusion.</p>

  <p>The chief guard was speechless. He had no idea what Luo Zheng was doing in the palace alone, but he finally managed to hold it back. "No. He's an honored guest, a distinguished guest."</p>

  <p>The Green Jade sculptures were still attacking Luo Zheng. Their blows became more powerful, and the golden light responded in kind. It simply got brighter.</p>

  <p>Before he had fused with the Chaotic Source Spirits, the golden light would dissipate, but now it converged at the spots of light. The two hundred such spots in his body kept devouring the golden light like hungry beasts.</p>

  <p>This lasted for an entire night.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't use the Shade Stone, nor did he activate the Chaotic Source Spirits. He just let the Green Jade sculptures rain blows on him all night.</p>

  <p>At dawn, the sounds of hammering in the palace finally stopped. Although the first ten sculptures didn't have much power, it was still not easy to withstand thousands of punches without any means of defense.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked exhausted, but his eyes had that telltale glint of excitement.</p>

  <p>"The Chaotic Source Spirits have become far more powerful after absorbing this Truth of Divine Dao!"</p>

  <p>"It's... It's so incredible..." No. 9527 was confused too.</p>

  <p>Since it couldn't figure it out, it even stole into Luo Zheng's inner world to ask the Green Jade Spirit for guidance.</p>

  <p>The Green Jade Spirit understood the Other Shore better than No. 9527, but he didn't know any more about the thirteen Truths of Divine Dao than the one who asked him. So when the Green Jade Spirit saw the fourteenth Truth of Divine Dao? the Truth of Three-Energy Construction for the first time, he was as astonished as No. 9527.</p>

  <p>He could not understand what had happened to Luo Zheng's corporeal body and how the truth aura had been siphoned from his body.</p>

  <p>But right now, the reasons were immaterial. They had to deal with things as they were now. The answers could wait.</p>

  <p>The truth aura that was drawn by the hammering could not only nourish the Chaotic Source Spirits and make them stronger, but also could quickly dispel their fatigue.</p>

  <p>It meant that Luo Zheng's Chaotic Source Spirits could last longer than anyone else's. It would take much more time to exhaust them. Luo Zheng could even use his opponent's power in a battle to create the truth aura, in order to make his Chaotic Source Spirits even stronger.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng was taking it all in, a guard suddenly called from the palace door. "The master of Rose Sect wants to see you!"</p>

  <p>"The master of Rose Sect?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was a little confused to hear the title, not realizing who that was.</p>

  <p>"It's Emily. You know, from the bottom of the chaos," No. 9527 reminded him.</p>

  <p>"Emily!"</p>

  <p>It was not until then that Luo Zheng remembered who the master of Rose Sect was.</p>

  <p>Emily had guided him and his sister on their journey to the Source World.</p>

  <p>He hadn't seen her since they last parted.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng pushed the door open and walked out. His gaze fell upon Emily, all in green, standing at the door with a smile on her face.</p>

  <p>Because of Yan's bloodline, Yan could only be brought back to the Li Shan mountain by her. But Emily had always believed that Luo Zheng could become more powerful than his sister.</p>

  <p>To Emily's surprise, however, Yan had been treated like a VIP after she entered the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>Yan didn't have to be rigorously tested before she was promoted, unlike every other talent. The Snake Goddess even agreed to see her right away.</p>

  <p>She had a meteoric rise to stardom.</p>

  <p>Emily had known that Yan might be very important to the Li Shan mountain because of her bloodline, but she had never expected Yan to be that influential.</p>

  <p>Emily was given an unexpected reward only because she had escorted Yan there. Moreover, she was allowed to return to Rose Sect. What was more, she was given the soul crystal, so that her Soul of Light cultivation improved rapidly. In just a few years, she reached the twelfth stage of the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, however, the Chaotic Source World had opened before she could reach the thirteenth stage. So she had to give up on the opportunity.</p>

  <p>She had thought that Luo Zheng, who had entered the Taiyi Heaven Palace, would make slower progress. After all, he came from the Nine Li race. If someone from any other race joined the Taiyi Heaven Palace, it would be hard for him to achieve something unless he trained for a thousand years.</p>

  <p>That was why Emily was gobsmacked when Leopold told her Luo Zheng was going to enter the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>After all, Emily had reached the Other Shore Realm many years ago, and Luo Zheng was still wandering the Sea of Truth when he entered the Source World. However, before Emily could reach the thirteenth stage of the Other Shore Realm, Luo Zheng was already qualified to enter the Chaotic Source World.</p>
