<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>In the Sword Tower, Sellers saw Zheng rush in. The mask he had on was only barely concealing the helpless smile underneath.</p>

  <p>"Master Sellers! I just came back to Dragon City. I heard that Nelly, Liusu and Xun had been taken away. Which sect did they join?"</p>

  <p>Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Usually, the warriors in the Dragon City who had gone up the mountain would join the Flow Sword Sect, the Killing Sword Sect or the Unique Array Sword Sect.</p>

  <p>But sometimes, the other six mountains would choose the disciples in the Dragon City too.</p>

  <p>"They didn't join any," Sellers said with a light shake of his head.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Zheng frowned. He figured they must have been under house arrest instead.</p>

  <p>Was it the Vastness Mountain disciples who had taken them away?</p>

  <p>Zheng's brows furrowed deeper. Suddenly, he felt the urge to kill flow through his veins.</p>

  <p>"Someone from the Phoenix Palace took them away," Sellers said. "Did you do anything to offend them?"</p>

  <p>The Phoenix Palace was the core of the Oneness Mountain.</p>

  <p>The palace only trained and recruited disciples who were in the direct line of Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>

  <p>Xun, Nelly, and Liusu were talented, but none of them were qualified to enter the Phoenix Palace.</p>

  <p>Their sudden kidnapping to the Phoenix Palace was odd. Sellers figured that Zheng must have had something to do with it.</p>

  <p>"Me? Offend the Phoenix Palace?" Zheng rubbed his chin as he tried to recall.</p>

  <p>Then, a trace of cold light flashed through his eyes. "Feng Ge!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Sellers gasped. "What did you do to offend her?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Not every descendant of Eastern Emperor Taiyi held a high status, but Feng Ge was highly favored.</p>

  <p>Sellers tried to stop the Phoenix Palace from taking away Zheng's women, but he was threatened by a powerful warrior from the palace. He wondered whom Zheng had offended to lead to this.</p>

  <p>Finally, Sellers gained clarity.</p>

  <p>"Humph!" Zheng snorted. "It was nothing. We just had some conflict in the Seven Mountains Meeting."</p>

  <p>Whatever happened between them, Zheng found it unreasonable that Feng Ge would involve the three women just to deal with him. It was a low blow in his standards.</p>

  <p>"Where is the Phoenix Palace? Master Sellers, can you take me there?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"What are you planning to do?" Sellers asked him. "Take them back?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, exactly," Zheng confirmed.</p>

  <p>He was afraid of what Feng Ge would do to his women. He didn't want to waste any more time.</p>

  <p>"The Phoenix Palace is located at the back of the Oneness Mountain. It's surrounded by the Primitive Illusion. It's not an easy place to go to. I've never been there," Sellers said.</p>

  <p>As if ignoring what he had said, Zheng rushed out of the Sword Tower.</p>

  <p>"Zheng! It's not easy to penetrate the Primitive Illusion. Not even brute force would work! Please, think about what you're about to do!" Sellers desperately wanted to stop Zheng, but without success.</p>

  <p>Zheng knew his way up the mountain.</p>

  <p>Halfway through the mountain, he decided to abandon his route. Instead, he flew towards the other side.</p>

  <p>The sword arrays on the Oneness Mountain were usually inactive, so it was not dangerous for Zheng to fly along the mountain. The mountain was huge.</p>

  <p>Its three peaks were occupied by different sects, namely: Flow Sword Sect, Killing Sword Sect, and Unique Array Sword Sect.</p>

  <p>And the Phoenix Palace occupied the back of the mountain.</p>

  <p>But few disciples were able to see the palace.</p>

  <p>From above, that area was covered with white fog called the Primitive Illusion. It was a mirage that protected the Phoenix Palace.</p>

  <p>After flying for a while, Zheng was finally seeing the fog below him.</p>

  <p>He smiled with satisfaction.</p>

  <p>Seeing the impenetrable fog, however, he almost retreated. But the mere memory of his women motivated him to land without hesitation.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The thick fog hung in the air and blocked his line of sight. He could barely see the outlines of the trees that surrounded him.</p>

  <p>"Spiritual sense..."</p>

  <p>Zheng blinked several times until a strand of his spiritual sense began to spread out.</p>

  <p>However, as soon as it was out of his system, it disappeared without a trace.</p>

  <p>"Did the fog swallow my spiritual sense?" Zheng was slightly shocked.</p>

  <p>He was walking aimlessly without his spiritual sense and eyesight. He didn't even know where the Phoenix Palace was exactly located.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>His feet kicked the ground and his body jumped up. He rapidly shuttled through the fog.</p>

  <p>He flew fast, but this did not help him. The fog kept on drifting and covering everything in front of him.</p>

  <p>Zheng halted and gave his next steps some thought. He opened his right eye and a flash of white light appeared.</p>

  <p>"The Authentic Visual World!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly, his surroundings became clearer.</p>

  <p>It was still covered with fog. Not even his demonic eye could see through it.</p>

  <p>But, through the fog, he was able to outline a long and thin black figure in the distance. He proceeded towards its direction.</p>

  <p>A few moments later, he was finally standing in front of it. It was a pillar similar to the ones in a royal palace. However, it looked tattered and disheveled, as if it had been there for a while.</p>

  <p>Zheng stepped closer to approach the pillar when, suddenly, another thin black shadow caught his right eye.</p>

  <p>"Are these pillars leading the way to the Phoenix Palace?" Zheng muttered to himself.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Zheng flashed swiftly toward the second pillar. As he neared it, a third one appeared not too far away.</p>

  <p>Zheng's guess was correct.</p>

  <p>To protect the Phoenix Palace, Eastern Emperor Taiyi had arranged the Primitive Illusion.</p>

  <p>It was designed with the eighteen pillars passed down from the Primitive Temple. The pillars were almost invincible. No normal method worked against them.</p>

  <p>Gratefully, they were free of wars and major conflicts now, and so the Primitive Illusion wasn't fully activated.</p>

  <p>Servants, maids and guards needed to go up and down the mountain. They carried with them a special token that allowed them to see the pillars and go as they pleased.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't need the special token to see the pillars. He was able to see them with his demonic eye.</p>

  <p>He continued to follow the pillars upwards. Finally, he saw a huge palace gate with a plaque that said, "Phoenix Palace."</p>

  <p>"Here it is!"</p>

  <p>Without any hesitation, Zheng went up and knocked on the palace gate.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Obviously, the Phoenix Palace did not receive plenty of visitors. The few distinguished guests usually had their own ushers.</p>

  <p>No one in recent history had done what Zheng did. No one just climbed up the mountain, navigated the fog, and knocked at the palace gate.</p>

  <p>So, when they heard the loud banging on the gate, the golden-armored guards of the Phoenix Palace were taken aback. They looked among themselves, wondering who it could be.</p>
