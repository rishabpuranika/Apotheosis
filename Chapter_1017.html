  <p>
</p>

  <p>Eddie was very sure of Master Wallace's origins.</p>

  <p>There was a vast continent on the other side of the Chaotic Ocean of Stars.</p>

  <p>On this continent, there used to be seven divine kingdoms along with a few other races.</p>

  <p>Compared to this continent, the Central Region was only a large island.</p>

  <p>Three of the seven divine kingdoms had been destroyed in the past in a war with the Dragon Lineage Human. Now, only four divine kingdoms remained.</p>

  <p>Master Wallace came from the York Divine Kingdom. The Holy Maiden who they had met in Immortal Mist's celestial tomb came from the same kingdom.</p>

  <p>After their last trip to the celestial tomb, Elder Gong, the warrior at the Life and Death Realm from the York Divine Kingdom, had fulfilled his promise and given Simon the internal version of the Scripture of Five Poisons.</p>

  <p>During the past two years, Simon had spent most of his time cultivating it.</p>

  <p>As for the Holy Maiden, although she had vowed in the celestial tomb that she would lead the warriors of the divine kingdom to wipe out the Central Region, she hadn't.</p>

  <p>After all, it was extremely difficult to pass through the Chaotic Ocean of Stars.</p>

  <p>This was due to the abnormally violent Star Storm that had been hanging above the Chaotic Ocean of Stars since many years ago. The Sky Northern Region and the four divine kingdoms were separated by this storm.</p>

  <p>According to Master Wallace, although the storm continued, it would subside with each passing year. Once the Star Storm weakened, the Holy Maiden would set off to flatten the Sky Northern Region.</p>

  <p>In this case, Eddie and the York Divine Kingdom were not on the same side. With Eddie's personality, he would never be willing to become just a vassal. His ambitions extended beyond the Central Region. In fact, he even thought nothing of the four divine kingdoms. He was destined to step onto a higher level.</p>

  <p>He could only work with the York Divine Kingdom temporarily and take what he needed. He had obtained a lot of benefits from this kingdom, so, of course, he wouldn't refuse their help.</p>

  <p>Eddie had speculated that there was a huge secret hidden within Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>The problem was that Luo Luo Zheng was too cunning. The last time he had cornered Luo Luo Zheng in the Dreamy Swampland, he had managed to escape. What was even more infuriating was that he had even taken away Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>After that, Eddie and Simon had worked together to wipe out the Ethereal Spirit Sect and had sent people to the Cloud Hall to get Mu Ning by exchanging Xander. Eddie had thought that this would be a cinch and that the Cloud Hall would be willing to do so. After all, Xander was the leader of Ethereal Spirit Sect, while Mu Ning was only a warrior at the Internal Elixir Realm. Plus, she was Xander's great-granddaughter.</p>

  <p>But Eddie was wrong. They refused to do so. What was even more unexpected was that Luo Luo Zheng had taken Xi Youqin's virginity!</p>

  <p>At that point, Eddie's plan to form the Lustful Demon Array had failed.</p>

  <p>Who knew how many years it would take for him to find the next girl with the Purple Power Body?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's actions were unpredictable. As he was Eddie's nemesis, he not only wanted to get rid of the brat, but he also wanted to snatch the secret from Luo Zheng's body and steal his fate too.</p>

  <p>Eddie knew that he must do it as soon as possible. If the warriors from the York Divine Kingdom were to come here, he probably wouldn't have a chance.</p>

  <p>After some contemplation, he felt that his plan should be carried out faster.</p>

  <p>So he decided to stop Simon from cultivating for now and ask him to help him deal with Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>In Melody City, Luo Luo Zheng and his group had completed their first mission, but they didn't find any transmission arrays there. Melody City was originally a trap set up by the Heavenly Evil Sect to lure and kill those warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm who were against them.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did not care whether or not he could complete the mission. Truth be told, he had come just because he was still worried about Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie had already reached the Life and Death Realm, and no one was able to find her when she went out alone. That day, Saint Morphens had rushed out to follow her, but given his speed, he could not track her. She had disappeared into the horizon in the blink of an eye. Since then, no one of the Cloud Hall had heard from her again.</p>

  <p>What if she went crazy and barged into the headquarters of the Heavenly Evil Sect? She alone was definitely no match for Simon and Eddie.</p>

  <p>"Since we didn't find any transmission arrays, we should return to report this," Tianming said to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Their trip had gone without a glitch this time around, and they had even managed to break the Spirit Container set up by the boy easily. But this would have been impossible for Tianming, Lewis, and Patrick without Luo Zheng's intervention. It was a powerful soul attack. Had it not been for Luo Luo Zheng, the three of them would most likely already be dead.</p>

  <p>"Wait." Luo Luo Zheng hesitated.</p>

  <p>"What is it?"</p>

  <p>Tianming and Patrick instantly became tense. Could there be some other danger in Melody City?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng suddenly took out a white token. It originally belonged to Ning Yudie. She had given it to him during the Cloud Road Test so that they could use it to communicate with each other.</p>

  <p>There were three common ways for warriors to communicate with each other. The first was to use one's life vitality. This method was suitable for two warriors in relatively close quarters; at most, only several thousand feet away. The second method was to use message runes. With a message rune, one could contact another warrior who was far away. Message runes could even reach several hundred miles. The only downside was that the cost of manufacturing them was relatively high.</p>

  <p>The tokens also covered an area of one to two hundred miles. One could use a token to send a message within this range.</p>

  <p>Holding out Yudie's token, Luo Luo Zheng poured a thread of life vitality into it in an attempt to send a message to her, but the token did not react at all.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's face fell. This meant that Ning Yudie was not within one or two hundred miles of them.</p>

  <p>"Let's go back and start another mission!"</p>

  <p>He smiled bitterly.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was acting weird. Tianming and the others looked at each other in confusion. They had no idea what he was up to.</p>

  <p>On their return journey, every time they traveled a certain distance, Luo Luo Zheng would stop and pour his life vitality into the token. The token didn't react, but Luo Luo Zheng didn't give up.</p>

  <p>When they reached almost halfway, Luo Luo Zheng once again poured his life vitality into it. This time the token reverberated.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes lit up, and, after a moment of hesitation, he asked, "Tia!</p>

  <p>Is that you?"</p>

  <p>There was no response from the other side.</p>

  <p>'She heard it, ' Luo Luo Zheng thought. He was sure that Ning Yudie was within the token's reception range, but where was she?</p>

  <p>He stopped suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Boss, what's wrong this time?"</p>

  <p>Lewis could not help but ask as he looked at a nervous Luo Luo Zheng. Ever since Luo Luo Zheng had given him a pair of low-grade sacred weapons, he had begun calling him boss.</p>

  <p>"Is there any big city around here?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>Tianming approached Luo Luo Zheng with a strange look on his face. "To the southeast is River Wave City, but that is the Heavenly Evil Sect's stronghold. A large number of its forces are gathered there. The place is easy to hold but hard to attack, so the alliance doesn't have any plans to take down River Wave City at the moment."</p>

  <p>The territories belonging to the alliance and the Heavenly Evil Sect crisscrossed. River Wave City was one of the Heavenly Evil Sect's territories and had the strongest army. It was an extremely important outpost of the Heavenly Evil Sect. It was said that Darius, the Heavenly Evil Sect's military counselor, was in River Wave City.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes lit up at Tianming's description. "She is there!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng transformed into a beam of light and dashed towards River Wave City.</p>

  <p>"Boss, what's going on?" Lewis shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Follow him!" Tianming and Patrick sped ahead without a word. Right now, they had unconditional trust in Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was flying high in the sky and simultaneously trying to communicate with Ning Yudie using the token, but she didn't say a word.</p>

  <p>"Hello!"</p>

  <p>"Ning Yudie!"</p>

  <p>"Tia!"</p>

  <p>"Will you say something?"</p>

  <p>No matter what Luo Luo Zheng said, Ning Yudie turned a deaf ear to him.</p>

  <p>This only worried Luo Luo Zheng further. Who knew what unwise choices she would make driven by fury?</p>

  <p>So what if she was at the Life and Death Realm? Eddie had the support of the four divine kingdoms, and the Cloud Hall could not contend with their methods. Even warriors at the Life and Death Realm were nothing in front of the divine kingdoms.</p>

  <p>After covering a distance of over sixty to seventy miles, Luo Luo Zheng stared at River Wave City in front of him. Immediately, a menacing rage burst forth from his eyes.</p>
