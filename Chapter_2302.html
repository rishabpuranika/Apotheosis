</p>

  <p>Thousands of transparent discs rose slowly from below the Floating Islands and stopped at the entrances of the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>The True Gods from different Floating Islands stepped onto the discs and slowly descended to the bottom of the Floating Islands. These True Gods had different cultivation bases, and even some were low-rank True Gods.</p>

  <p>No matter what cultivation bases they had, they were the elites of the wealthy clans on the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>Before long, dozens of transparent round discs also descended from the Floating Island of the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>Han Liusu stood alone on a disc, expressionless.</p>

  <p>Aleyna and Kelsey stood together on another disc.</p>

  <p>The two girls were whispering to each other and side-eyeing Han Liusu from time to time. Worry was written all over Aleyna's pretty face.</p>

  <p>Han Liusu had been practicing hard in her room during this period, and now looked totally different.</p>

  <p>It was easy for a smart girl like Aleyna to get to the root of the problem.</p>

  <p>She was sure that Luo Luo Zheng was responsible for the change in Han Liusu, but she couldn't figure out what had happened between her sister and Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"I think Han Liusu is in a bad mood because of Tianxing Luo," Kelsey murmured.</p>

  <p>"I think so too..." Kelsey didn't know Tianxing's true identity. However, Aleyna did, and she had a bad feeling that her sister would be in greater trouble if she continued to be involved with Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Most younger sisters worshiped their elder sisters during their childhood and this adoration usually continued well into adulthood, and Aleyna was no exception.</p>

  <p>In fact, she mostly liked Luo Luo Zheng only because of Han Liusu. To her, it seemed like her sister only liked the best things or people. In fact, deep down, she was even a little jealous of her sibling.</p>

  <p>But if Luo Luo Zheng hurt her sister, she would not stand it and would do everything in her power to destroy him.</p>

  <p>"I'll talk to Tianxing after Astronomical Transit Day," Aleyna whispered.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Pascal also stepped on a transparent disc and glided down from the other side. He had been busy and never paid much attention to Han Liusu in the beginning. Now seeing that she was all alone and looked sad, he asked, "Han Liusu, why are you unhappy?"</p>

  <p>Hearing the voice, Han Liusu suddenly raised her head and forcing a smile, she replied, "Brother, don't worry. I'm not upset."</p>

  <p>"Okay then, that's good!" He smiled softly and added, "It's Astronomical Transit Day today. Remember, you must perform well!"</p>

  <p>"I know," she nodded.</p>

  <p>After a short while, the motley group of warriors had all arrived on the giant disc at the bottom. Beneath their feet the Time Sea raged and rumbled.</p>

  <p>The disc was already swarming with elites of various powerful clans on the Floating Islands, and they were waiting for the invitation to the Sun Blind race.</p>

  <p>The invite for the Sun Blind race was an exclusive one. Anyone and everyone would not be invited; only Holy Beings and Demi-holy Beings.</p>

  <p>The True Gods assembled there all needed to assess their own strengths and determine whether or not they were qualified.</p>

  <p>The Sun Blind race had a special set of methods, and they could sense every move in the Time Sea. If it was not Astronomical Transit Day, once a warrior stood anywhere in the Time Sea, they would appear from out of nowhere and send the warrior to their destination.</p>

  <p>If they selected a warrior who they thought was qualified to take part in Astronomical Transit Day gala, they would send a boat for them. dozens of boats floated across the boundless Time Sea. The Sun Blind race dashed over and invited the True Gods to their boats one by one.</p>

  <p>Then they took off at an incredible speed.</p>

  <p>Before long, Han Liusu, Pascal, Aleyna and Kelsey were also picked up.</p>

  <p>The rest of the group craned their necks to see across the Time Sea, waiting for their chance.</p>

  <p>It was almost time for Luo Luo Zheng to leave the Holy Emperor City. He arrived on the edge of the Floating Island and stepped onto a transparent disc.</p>

  <p>In addition to Luo Luo Zheng, some members of the Han Clan, and a few members of other clans were also present.</p>

  <p>Some people from other clans also tested their luck on Astronomical Transit Day. Although they were outsiders, they wanted to try. What if the Sun Blind race chose them? The chances of something like this happening were not very high, but there had been some exceptions in the past so it was not an entirely hopeless scenario for the outsiders.</p>

  <p>This was the idea of the True Gods who arrived with Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Not all the elites of the Floating Islands would be invited. Nobody knew anything about the Sun Blind race's selection criteria, so there was always a bunch of people who left feeling disappointed, and even angry.</p>

  <p>"These Sun Blind people are all bloody blind! I am ranked 320th among the mid-rank True Gods! Why the hell didn't they invite me?" Ackley Tang grumbled and swore as he watched the boats disappear farther and farther into the distance.</p>

  <p>The remaining elite people's faces went pale when they realized no more boats were coming. Their eyes blazed in anger.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng and the others descended right at that moment. This group of people had naturally come to try their luck.</p>

  <p>Earlier, Ackley Tang was very disappointed, and he was even more furious when he saw this group of people. Although the people who took a chance to be invited rarely ever got the opportunity to be invited, every year, there were always some who got lucky enough to be invited to participate.</p>

  <p>"You bunch of trash! Do you really think you would be invited? Ha ha!</p>

  <p>This is so funny. Who do you think you are?" jeered Ackley Tang loudly.</p>

  <p>"There are so many people in the world who aren't self-aware. Why are you getting angry with them? It's not worth it," another elite disciple echoed.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, the True Gods, who intended to try their luck, naturally didn't feel good. However, they couldn't afford to provoke these elites of the large clans on the Floating Islands. All they could do was swallow the insults and stand by silently, hoping that a boat would take them away.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stood there with a dull, bored expression and kept mum.</p>

  <p>Ackley Tang continued complaining and was ready to pick a fight. If anyone from the group dared to provoke him, he would teach them a lesson. However, they all stayed silent like idiots.</p>

  <p>He glanced around and fixed his eyes on Luo Luo Zheng. "You've gotta be freaking kidding me! Even a low-rank True God has come to join in the fun! It looks like the number of psychos is increasing more and more here. If one day, a large group of proving godly warriors would join in, it would be more fun!"</p>

  <p>The True Gods who came to try their luck had a solid reason. They either thought that they were pretty talented, or they felt that their cultivation base was damn good. They were either mid-rank True Gods or top-rank True Gods. Luo Luo Zheng, on the other hand, was just a low-rank True God.</p>

  <p>He was staring at the Time Sea in the distance expressionlessly, but sensing that Ackley Tang was picking on him, he simply closed his eyes to rest them.</p>

  <p>Not surprisingly, Ackley Tang didn't give up. He walked up to Luo Luo Zheng and demanded, "Tell me, which Floating Island are you from?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng didn't deign to reply. He simply remained motionless like a statue.</p>

  <p>"Hey, you! I am talking to you. Can't you hear me?" Getting no response from Luo Luo Zheng infuriated Ackley Tang even more.</p>

  <p>The other True Gods noticed the commotion, their faces revealing a pitiful expression. They thought that Luo Luo Zheng would be in trouble shortly and it would be better for him to just cooperate. At the very least, Ackley Tang might let him go.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Luo Zheng's eyes were still closed, Ackley Tang stretched out his hand to slap Luo Zheng's face like a streak of lightning. He cursed, "I'm fucking asking you..."</p>

  <p>Just when he started to move, Luo Luo Zheng suddenly opened his eyes and slightly leaned his head back.</p>

  <p>The tips of Ackley Tang's fingers swept past the tip of Luo Zheng's nose, missing his face by an inch.</p>

  <p>He was a little stunned to see that Luo Luo Zheng had dodged his slap so easily.</p>

  <p>The next thing he saw was Luo Zheng's figure flashing past and his collar being grabbed by the young man. An irresistible force pushed his entire body back uncontrollably!</p>

  <p>Ackley Tang was standing on the edge of the huge disc, and behind him was the Time Sea whose waves were rolling savagely. If he fell off the disc, he would certainly die. Even a consummate True God would be torn to pieces by the menacing sea water, and he was just a mid-rank True God!</p>

  <p>He looked terror-stricken, but suddenly his body stopped in mid-air, and at the same time, a faint voice said, "You are a dignified True God, but your temperament is like an inferior mortal hooligan. Whichever clan has a scumbag like you is really unfortunate!"</p>

  <p>"You, you, I, ah..."</p>

  <p>The huge disc floated very close to the surface of the Time Sea now. The colorful waves rolled and crashed, and from time to time, some waves stretched towards Ackley Tang's head, threatening to swallow him any minute. How could he dare to oppose Luo Luo Zheng now? He cried out in panic and his overbearing attitude disappeared completely!</p>

  <p>When the other True Gods saw this, they took a deep breath. They never thought that the ordinary-looking low-rank True God would be so ruthless when pushed to make a move.</p>
