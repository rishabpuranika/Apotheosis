<br/><br/>

  

  <p>There was no doubt that Johnson Qiu was a skilled master.</p>

  <p>He had been a half-step into the nature level since many years ago, and would reach the nature level when he overcame the difficulty he faced in changing his life energy into life vitality.</p>

  <p>But he had stayed at a half-step into the nature level all these years despite his disciplined practice at Drizzle Peak as he hadn't overcome the difficulty yet.</p>

  <p>Any practitioner of martial arts knew this:</p>

  <p>A challenge could only be surpassed through patience and diligence.</p>

  <p>Only by experiencing continuous fights could a martial artist become more powerful.</p>

  <p>If Johnson had chosen to continue practicing diligently at Drizzle Peak, it might take him a decade to cross into the nature level.</p>

  <p>So Johnson desired to grab this opportunity to push his limits with the hopes that he would make quicker progress to the nature level.</p>

  <p>He didn't shrink when confronted by the demon.</p>

  <p>The evil spirit intruded his body and raised a terrible fear at the bottom of his heart.</p>

  <p>He seemed to hear a voice that asked him to run away quickly.</p>

  <p>However, at that moment, Johnson worked up the nerve to walk closer to the demon, in full view of the other disciples.</p>

  <p>Quickly, Johnson stepped over the outermost circle drawn by Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>The demon's ugly eyes focused on Johnson as he came closer.</p>

  <p>Although the demon was physically weak and couldn't hurt people, its innate evil spirit had not weakened.</p>

  <p>"Goo Gha," the demon mumbled as its mouth opened and closed.</p>

  <p>Although the disciples couldn't understand what the demon was saying, it seemed to be laughing at Johnson.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, all the blood disappeared from Johnson's face. Not only had his face paled, an overwhelming instinct to run away coursed through Johnson's body.</p>

  <p>Since he was the fourth most powerful martial artist from among the outer disciples, Johnson took a deep breath, gathered his courage, and forced his leaden legs to take a step forward. As he was working against his instincts to run away, his walking posture looked very strange.</p>

  <p>The second circle....</p>

  <p>The third circle....</p>

  <p>When Johnson walked into the fourth circle, the demon opened its huge mouth and released a roar.</p>

  <p>"Goo� � "</p>

  <p>Johnson's hard-earned courage vanished at the roar.</p>

  <p>He turned and tried to run but tripped and fell. With no courage left, Johnson whimpered as he crawled away from the demon on his hands and knees.</p>

  <p>Silence descended in the plaza as the disciples witnessed how terrified Johnson had been.</p>

  <p>Most disciples were residents of the Imperial Capital, which was located far from the Shura Battlefield. The White Emperor City, home to millions of soldiers of the Imperial Army, separated the Imperial Capital from the Shura Battlefield. Since the residents of the Imperial Capital had never confronted a demon, they had not experienced its power.</p>

  <p>They knew from rumors that demons were particularly powerful and that their evil spirit could cause a human to feel terror.</p>

  <p>They had all naively thought that they could overcome this fear.</p>

  <p>However, after seeing the demon and witnessing the first-hand terror it could spread, the disciples understood how difficult it would be to overcome this fear.</p>

  <p>All the outer disciples at Drizzle Peak knew how powerful Johnson was.</p>

  <p>And if a person like Johnson could be subdued with fear, what chance did any ordinary disciple have when facing the demon?</p>

  <p>Any martial artist was fiercely determined and never admitted defeat.</p>

  <p>To some degree, Johnson's failure increased the trepidation of the disciples, and they became more hesitant at the thought of volunteering for the test. However, there were still a few who were brave enough to step into the circles.</p>

  <p>This time, an outer disciple at the marrow refining level volunteered to get close to the demon.</p>

  <p>Most of the onlookers were unfamiliar with the identity of this outer disciple as his power wasn't anywhere close to that of the top-ranked disciples at Drizzle Peak.</p>

  <p>Although the outer disciple hadn't been thought highly of previously, the onlookers regarded him with respect once he stepped into the sixth circle. Someone at the marrow refining level had made more progress than one of the top-ranked disciples at Drizzle Peak. This feat certainly stirred the other disciples who had been watching.</p>

  <p>The more circles he stepped into, the closer he would get to the demon.</p>

  <p>The sixth circle was about ten feet away from the demon.</p>

  <p>However, as he stepped into the sixth circle, the outer disciple stopped.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, his legs began to tremble violently.</p>

  <p>Even so, the outer disciple whose power was far below that of Johnson's behaved remarkably. He concealed his fear, turned around, and walked away from the demon. During his retreat, the disciple maintained the same speed as when he had first started walking toward the demon. He hadn't fallen nor had he scrambled away in terror as Johnson had!</p>

  <p>Seeing this, a realization dawned upon the outer disciples at Drizzle Peak.</p>

  <p>Bravery had nothing to do with power. Just like a small mantis would be overestimating its abilities by attempting to stop a car, its courage to face such a mammoth challenge could not be denied.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning recorded the name and progress of each disciple that tried to approach the demon. Based on their performance, she would then select the five disciples who got the closest to the demon. These disciples would then practice how to kill demons.</p>

  <p>The outer disciple who was at the marrow refining level but had reached the sixth circle, helped many people to regain their confidence. Now that they had understood that bravery, not power was needed they felt more convinced that they could confront the demon.</p>

  <p>One after another, hundreds of outer disciples tested their mental agility against the demon's evil spirit. The results varied from person to person.</p>

  <p>However, the worst performance came from a disciple who had broken down immediately after stepping into the first circle, while the best performer was Henry Hao.</p>

  <p>Ranked first among the outer disciples, Henry had set a good example.</p>
