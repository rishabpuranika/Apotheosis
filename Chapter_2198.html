  <p>
</p>

  <p>As soon as Linn saw Luo Luo Zheng, a faint smile surfaced on her pretty face.</p>

  <p>"What are you going to buy this time?" she asked, cocking her head. "I dug out a few more pieces of mud. Interested?"</p>

  <p>"What?" Luo Luo Zheng was slightly surprised. His gaze fell to the stall before her.</p>

  <p>As she had said, several pieces of mud covered the panel.</p>

  <p>However, this time Luo Zheng's inner world did not react to the mud like it had last time. Clearly, these pieces of mud were ordinary. Luo Luo Zheng smirked at her.</p>

  <p>This little girl was brazen enough to dig out a few pieces of mud straight from the ground and sell them unabashedly.</p>

  <p>Once the Tie Clan sold the piece of mud to Luo Luo Zheng, the curiosity of many members was piqued. Earlier, Linn's uncle, Alfred, had decided that the mud was not ordinary, but after many evaluations, the Tie Clan lost their patience and handed over the mud to Linn without a second thought. No one in the clan knew about the use and origin of the piece of mud.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, naturally, was not aware of the internal affairs of the Tie Clan. He also did not imagine that a series of ramifications would occur once he bought the piece of mud with so much money.</p>

  <p>The Tie Clan never would have dreamed that someone could spend five hundred divine might coins on some mud. It had caught them unaware.</p>

  <p>Certainly, Tianxing was not a fool in their eyes. The fact that he was willing to pay such a steep price for the mud, coupled with his astonishing performance in the Heavenly Han House, was enough to make the clan believe that the dirt was indeed highly valuable.</p>

  <p>Some of the Tie Clan members had been regretful, thinking that Linn should have asked for a higher place. However, just a few days ago, there was still someone who had criticized her for her tactics.</p>

  <p>Linn did not care for the voices in the first place, but the pedantic elders in the clan were getting worse and worse. Even if this piece of mud was some extraordinary treasure, it was sold already and should now be irrelevant to them.</p>

  <p>To Linn, doing business meant pursuing the greatest gains, so she did not hesitate to ask for a high price. She felt it was her prerogative.</p>

  <p>However, she paid heed to honesty and integrity each time. No matter how much damage she incurred, she would not regret her approach.</p>

  <p>At this time, everyone in the Tie Clan suddenly found themselves extraordinarily busy. This was not only because Devin was taking the Heavenly Han House's test, but also because of the piece of mud. The small hill where the Tie Clan had dug out the piece of mud had been turned upside down in search for more treasure. They hoped to dig out a second piece of that exceptionable mud, but so far, it was to no avail.</p>

  <p>Linn, on the other hand, had casually dug out some ordinary mud outside of the Six-Burden Divine City. Each piece of mud was priced at five divine might coins. Seeing her sell it, some people bought the mud to try their fortunes. After all, Luo Luo Zheng had spent five hundred divine might coins before. They could buy identical pieces of mud using just five divine might coins. Each of them felt like they had stumbled on a fortune.</p>

  <p>Maybe there truly was something special about this mud?</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Linn did not think she was deceiving anyone. No one knew of what use the mud was. Perhaps the piece Luo Luo Zheng had bought was also ordinary. Perhaps he had been mistaken.</p>

  <p>Nearly everyday, she sold those pieces of mud for five divine might coins each. It was a rare occurrence in the Money Alley.</p>

  <p>She managed to sell more than twenty pieces and earned the Tie Clan more than a hundred divine might coins.</p>

  <p>The True Gods witnessing this felt their eyes go red with envy.</p>

  <p>Seeing how the little girl's mud was far too easy to sell, they started to follow her example one by one. Suddenly, quite a few stalls selling mud cropped up in Money Alley.</p>

  <p>Some of the True Gods who were unaware of the truth were dumbstruck to see this happening. They suspected that the people of Money Alley were not in complete control of their senses. Who in their right mind would jump up to buy mud at such a hefty price?</p>

  <p>As more and more people sold mud, the competition grew intense. Some buyers made up stories of how incredible the mud was; about how it had proved to be a miracle medicine.</p>

  <p>But the True Gods were not stupid. After being fooled by Linn for long, people no longer bought the mud after a point of time. Linn despised her imitating rivals. Now that the mud could no longer be sold, she racked her brain in order to come up with new ideas. The last thing she expected, however, was for Tianxing to appear before her again.</p>

  <p>"I won't buy anything today," Luo Luo Zheng replied, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>Linn smiled faintly, as if she had sensed his thoughts. "I know what you want. You wish to find out where the mud was excavated, right?"</p>

  <p>"Not really." Luo Luo Zheng chuckled as he scanned her face.</p>

  <p>He had indeed come for that matter, but since he knew that the little girl was far too crafty, why would he let her cheat him again?</p>

  <p>"Oh?" Linn's features revealed a trace of surprise. "No? Then what have you come here for?"</p>

  <p>Linn was already scheming. The mountain where the piece of mud had been dug out was originally Tie Clan's territory. Although it was now rather unsightly after all the digging, she reasoned that would still arouse Luo Zheng's interest. She planned to sell the entire mountain to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>It was a pity that she was unable to continue what she had formerly wanted to say. Luo Zheng's reply was different from what she had imagined.</p>

  <p>"I'm looking for your brother, Devin. He promised me he would take me for a tour around Tie Clan," Luo Luo Zheng said with a smile.</p>

  <p>Before entering the Consulting God Hall, Luo Luo Zheng had briefly come in contact with Devin. Devin was dull but honest, and it was far easier to deal with him than with his sister. However, Devin had not passed the test of the Heavenly Han House. Luo Luo Zheng had not seen him after the test, so the only way he could look for him was through Linn.</p>

  <p>"My brother?" Linn furrowed her brows. She was still too young, after all. When her thoughts failed her, a dejected look surfaced on her features.</p>

  <p>She knew her brother's personality. He was a loyal, honest, and an obstinate man. He always followed through on what he promised. Even though Linn was very eloquent and persuasive, she could not change Devin's mind. If Luo Luo Zheng had only come looking for Devin, Linn could not scam Luo Luo Zheng again.</p>

  <p>'What a pity, ' she thought to herself. However, after thinking for a while, she realized that Tianxing's popularity had spread like wildfire not so long ago. It was said that getting to the Floating Island would be a piece of cake for him.</p>

  <p>Tianxing was not the kind of person who would debase himself by getting roped in by the Tie Clan. However, if they could be on good terms with each other, then in future it would benefit Tie Clan when he won accolades.</p>

  <p>There were some favors that could not be traded for the divine might coin. Pondering on this, Linn did not hesitate. She told Luo Luo Zheng that Devin was at their residence in the Six-Burden Divine City. At the same time, she urged Luo Luo Zheng to comfort her brother, who was rather down in the dumps these days.</p>

  <p>Devin ranked fifty-sixth in the name list. Sixty-seven warriors had passed the test of the Heavenly Han House. Naturally, Devin had been depressed after being eliminated. According to the rankings, he should have been able to pass the test, but it was a pity that getting the acknowledgment of the Divine Dao Tablets was not as per the rankings, rather it depended on one's own understanding of the Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>Several proving godly warriors ranking thirty to forty had failed the test, like Devin himself.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng immediately agreed to Linn's request.</p>

  <p>The Tie Clan had some property in the Six-Burden Divine City.</p>

  <p>Following Linn's guidance, Luo Luo Zheng quickly found Devin.</p>

  <p>Devin's mood these few days had indeed slumped, but his personality was such that he did not suffer too much of a blow. Instead, he made an ambitious decision. He did not pass the test this year, but he was sure to come back next year. And if he did not pass next year either, then he would try for the year after. He was determined to demonstrate his full abilities. For a proving godly warrior, a few decades was only a short period of time.</p>

  <p>Three days later, Luo Luo Zheng left the Six-Burden Divine City under Devin's lead and headed toward the Tie Clan.</p>

  <p>As the ancestral land of the Han Clan, the Six-Burden Region was much larger in terms of the area it covered.</p>

  <p>Although the Tie Clan was said to be just outside of the Six-Burden Divine City, the distance it took to reach there was not short. It took them half a month to arrive at the place.</p>

  <p>For the Tie Clan, Luo Luo Zheng, the genius who had turned up out of the blue was an honored guest. Apart from a round of warm hospitality, the Tie Clan's elders wanted to draw out from Luo Luo Zheng the true use of the mud.</p>

  <p>But how could Luo Luo Zheng give them the explanation they wanted? In the end, he managed to dodge their queries. When the Tie Clan saw that Luo Luo Zheng was unwilling to answer, they did not pursue the matter further.</p>

  <p>Some rounds of entertainment later, Devin escorted Luo Luo Zheng out of the Tie Clan and headed to the mountain where they had dug out the piece of magical mud.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng arrived at the mountain and saw it full of potholes, he was rendered speechless. The earth was in disarray. It would not be an exaggeration to say that the Tie Clan had dug deep into the ground to look for the mud.</p>

  <p>However, it seemed like they had gained nothing so far.</p>
