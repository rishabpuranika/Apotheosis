<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2512 The Origin Of Spiritual Darkness </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Zheng walked quietly behind Lorena as he scanned the cave up and down.</p>

  <p>The cave seemed to be emitting a faint smell of blood, while there were several pieces of brown "mud" running around.</p>

  <p>In addition, Zheng also saw many huge heads that were embedded in the rows of rocks.</p>

  <p>The eyes of these heads were closed, as if they were sleeping peacefully.</p>

  <p>"Mom, what are these creatures? Why could they travel in the rocks?"</p>

  <p>Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>After reuniting with Lorena in the debate venue, Zheng didn't feel distant from his mother. Instead, he felt very secure and safe with his mother.</p>

  <p>"These stone spirits were grown by me one by one. They are my bodyguards," Lorena replied with a smile.</p>

  <p>"You grew them?" Zheng asked, slightly stunned.</p>

  <p>"Well, they are blessed by Chaos Ancient God to possess extreme powers. Even Harold may not be able to deal with them," said Lorena.</p>

  <p>"No wonder," Zheng exclaimed, his eyes flashing with a spark. These stone spirits had always made Zheng feel great pressure. Just as his mother had said, because they had the ability to contend against Harold, they might be comparable to Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>Underground, caves were connected one by one. Every time Lorena led Zheng to the end of one of the caves, there would be a new one. The underground world was far more complicated than Zheng had ever imagined.</p>

  <p>Along the way, Zheng had seen a large amount of Spiritual Darkness. His inner world was like a beast that was ready to move, urging him to devour the Spiritual Darkness. He took a lot of discipline to restrain his urges.</p>

  <p>Soon after, Zheng passed another cave and saw a large pot resting on the ground.</p>

  <p>Zheng had seen this huge pot through the Spiritual Darkness' eyeball. Back then, his mother only had a head left which was soaked in the pot.</p>

  <p>Beneath the pot was a faint green flame swaying back and forth.</p>

  <p>"Sit down," said Lorena while pointing her finger at a particular corner.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded and followed his mother. He sat cross legged on the ground beside the large pot.</p>

  <p>Lorena placed herself in front of Zheng and stared at him with a happiness across her face.</p>

  <p>She had fused the memories of her incarnation of fear, but it was the first time she had seen Zheng herself, so she had a different feeling.</p>

  <p>After a while, Lorena began to speak, "Your father is indeed courageous and resourceful. He dared to take a gamble and in the end, he was right.</p>

  <p>With my advice in the past, it would be impossible for you to create the Thousand Sanskrit Land."</p>

  <p>Seeing Zheng's confused expression, Lorena continued with her explanation, "At that time, I did not want to leave you and your sister to your father. You two have pure blood and are destined to be extraordinary. However, in the divine land, despite being extraordinary, you could become only a Holy Being at most. But for some reason, you have to surpass this limit."</p>

  <p>What Lorena said puzzled Zheng. This time, he wanted to seek help from his mother to break through his own cultivation level, but he couldn't seem to understand after what his mother explained. He asked, "But because I have practiced the Primal Chaos Technique, I have been stuck at the low-rank True God Realm. I'm even far inferior to a consummate True God now, not to mention a Holy Being..."</p>

  <p>Lorena shook her head with a smile. At the same time, she said, "Vassals are always vassals. If one follows the road created by others, the road will come to its end eventually one day. Only when one creates his or her own road, can the person go further and have infinite possibilities!" Her smile was so wide at this point.</p>

  <p>"Vassals? Mom, do you mean the Holy Beings are vassals?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," responded Lorena. "Not only Holy Beings, all the creatures that cultivate life vitality in the divine land are vassals, while the creatures in the inner worlds of the Holy Beings are vassals of the vassals. Even if they pass the test in the Mountain of Holy Beings and become Holy Beings, they still need to attach their universes to the divine land."</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded in acknowledgement. Even though these Holy Beings had the magic power, he knew that they still couldn't leave the divine land no matter how hard they tried.</p>

  <p>"But my inner world can't expand yet, and my cultivation has been stagnant," Zheng said, furrowing his eyebrows in concern.</p>

  <p>Hearing Zheng's words, Lorena waved her hand gently, and a burst of noise rose from the surrounding. Many Spiritual Darknesses began to crawl over to them.</p>

  <p>"All you need is the Spiritual Darkness, right?" Lorena asked, and gave a wink afterwards.</p>

  <p>Zheng looked at the numerous Spiritual Darknesses. The urge to devour them came back, and he swallowed hard. He nodded.</p>

  <p>"You see." Lorena smiled helplessly and said, "The Primal Chaos Technique your master gave you is not complete. The incomplete cultivation method of course can't tell you how to obtain the Spiritual Darkness. In fact, Spiritual Darkness also exists in your inner world."</p>

  <p>She loved seeing her son in awe.</p>

  <p>"My inner world also has the Spiritual Darkness?" Zheng was stunned.</p>

  <p>In that moment, Lorena unfolded her slender fingers and a dark brown divine might coin appeared in the center of her palm.</p>

  <p>"Is that a divine might coin?" Zheng stared at his mother. Did she just do that?</p>

  <p>Just then, she gently tossed the divine might coin away, and the Spiritual Darknesses immediately pounced over like a group of hungry wolves fending for their lives.</p>

  <p>The competition was fierce and brutal. Very soon, a Spiritual Darkness stood out and swallowed the divine might coin in whole.</p>

  <p>"Is the Spiritual Darkness fed with divine might coins?" Zheng asked in surprise.</p>

  <p>Lorena shook her head, "No, actually. The Spiritual Darkness is made from divine might coins!"</p>

  <p>In the earlier days of the divine land, the Nine Li race occupied the entire place. At that time, the divine might coins were used for only two things: to nurture the Spiritual Darkness for the cultivation purpose, and to write the rules of the divine land.</p>

  <p>This was a generous benefit Chiyou managed to create for his people.</p>

  <p>However, people cultivating with the Spiritual Darkness were not actually people from the divine land, but extraordinary creatures that had opened up the Sanskrit Land, and Lorena was one of them.</p>

  <p>Later on, the Nine Li people had been almost all killed, and the True Gods of the divine land couldn't reach higher level to become extraordinary creatures. The divine might coins could only be used to modify the rules on the Ruling Slate.</p>

  <p>After Lorena was done explaining, Zheng gave off a bitter smile He had been exploring hard and was unable to break through in the end. He didn't expect that it was because the Primal Chaos Technique he learned was incomplete.</p>

  <p>To put it simply, the Primal Chaos Technique only recorded the methods to open up a small divine land, but it did not record how to expand or cultivate it in the first place. Zheng, on the other hand had relied on himself and accidentally reached what he was now.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng had been stuck in condensing his Godly Tile, and couldn't develop any further up until he discovered the mud.</p>

  <p>"You have created the Thousand Sanskrit Land for a long time," pointed out Lorena. "Now I can help you break through your bottlenecks, but you still need to master the way to nurture the Spiritual Darkness." She looked at her son with a seriousness in her eyes. "Are you ready, Zheng?"</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>With one point of her finger, the Spiritual Darknesses flocked towards Zheng in a rapid pace.</p>
