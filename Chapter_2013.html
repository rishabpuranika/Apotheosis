  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Destiny of Supreme Lord Leroy had been personally gifted by Xun. Naturally, his feelings for her differed from the other Supreme Lords of the Demon Night race.</p>

  <p>In the universe, Supreme Lords were the utmost existences? never did they submit to anyone.</p>

  <p>But the Supreme Lords of the Demon Night race still maintained respect towards their queens. Most of the time, they were on equal footing.</p>

  <p>But Supreme Lord Leroy submitted to Xun willingly, treating her as his master.</p>

  <p>For the sake of her return, he was willing to pay any price. No regret would come to him even if he had to sacrifice his own life.</p>

  <p>To him, hearing Xun's simple greeting was already worth everything.</p>

  <p>The conflict before him hadn't been resolved, so it wasn't the time to reminisce about the past.</p>

  <p>Yao stood in front of Xun, looking stubborn and unmoving. Such was her personality? paranoid and violence-driven.</p>

  <p>Although she knew that she had suffered a crushing defeat, she couldn't accept it in the least.</p>

  <p>No change could be hinted from Ying's expression? she couldn't be read at all in that moment.</p>

  <p>Standing not too far away, Supreme Lord Korbin felt bitterness fill his heart.</p>

  <p>He and Supreme Lord Shadow had originally been neutral Supreme Lords. Never did they participate in the internal struggles of the Demon Night race unless they were to face an invasion.</p>

  <p>This time, they had acted completely based on consideration of the situation. They believed that Luo Luo Zheng could be brought down easily, and that Leroy and the other Demon Night members weren't a match for them at all.</p>

  <p>After all, who would've thought that Luo Zheng's strength could still exceed anyone's imagination? Even after the two queens returned, they couldn't defeat him.</p>

  <p>Yet, such a change came about in the Inauguration Altar, something unexpected to all.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Korbin watched Xun warily, preparing to use the Grand Teleportation to leave. If she were to control the Demon Night race, he wouldn't be able to stay any longer. But as a Supreme Lord, it wasn't really difficult to find a hiding spot in the universe.</p>

  <p>The one who was most let down was probably Supreme Lord Shadow.</p>

  <p>Although he was completely healed, thanks to Ying, he still had one side of the chain on his body? he had no way to escape.</p>

  <p>Xun's eyes swept slowly over them until they finally stopped on Ying. "Ying, do you wish to be my enemy too? Why?"</p>

  <p>After Xun had brewed for such a long time, her question left everyone in shock. It seemed that Xun knew nothing.</p>

  <p>Ying looked at her strangely. She wasn't as depressed and unwilling as Yao, so she gave a free, easy smile. "Since we're taking different sides, it's natural that I become your enemy." Although Ying was neither good at nor enjoyed fighting, under the Soul-sealing Needle's control, she wasn't left with another choice.</p>

  <p>"Sides? What sides?" The statement confused Xun even further.</p>

  <p>In the end, she could only look at Luo Luo Zheng pleadingly. "I only remember the time before you went to the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. I can't remember what happened afterwards."</p>

  <p>To erase the Soul-sealing Needle, Xun's memories were completely lost.</p>

  <p>But the Inauguration Altar was connected to the three queens? it contained all the memories of the past queens, including Xun's. But these memories were limited to the ones from within the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>Such memories of Xun following Luo Luo Zheng into the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land were not recorded by the altar. When Luo Luo Zheng returned, Xun's soul was like a wooden stake, making it impossible to remember a single detail.</p>

  <p>Before, when Luo Luo Zheng had stuffed the Ancestral Dragon inside the altar, he managed to attach Xun's soul to the dragon's body.</p>

  <p>It was a very risky move, and Luo Luo Zheng himself didn't know how effective it would be.</p>

  <p>But all the prerequisites to entering the Inauguration Altar were there.</p>

  <p>The Ancestral Dragon could travel through space? ordinary enchanted barriers and arrays couldn't stop the creature, and such was its innate ability.</p>

  <p>Xun's soul was the prerequisite to entering the Inauguration Altar.</p>

  <p>For many years, Supreme Lord Leroy had waited, refusing to move without Xun by his side. It was impossible for him to enter the Inauguration Altar and destroy the Pools of Faith with his own power.</p>

  <p>Since the conditions had been met, Luo Luo Zheng could only give the Ancestral Dragon a few instructions and resign the rest to fate.</p>

  <p>But never did he expect such results. Not only did the Ancestral Dragon carry Xun to the Inauguration Altar and help her regain her memories, it also devoured the Faith Energy in Ying's and Yao's Pools of Faith.</p>

  <p>This energy had been accumulated over countless years by the Demon Night members. Just how terrifying was the amount of Faith Energy contained within? One could only imagine. As the dragon devoured it, its body underwent an astonishing transformation until it reached its current form.</p>

  <p>It found a perfect spirit embryo within Ying's Pool of Faith.</p>

  <p>Previously, Ying had wanted to exchange the spirit embryo for the Saint Killing Spear, but Luo Luo Zheng rejected it. Now that Xun had recovered her memories, she naturally took in the spirit embryo as her own.</p>

  <p>It was bred from the Pool of Faith, which Ying had done with tremendous concentration. Such was a truly perfect body, from the smallest of meridians to the tip of every hair. No flaws or impurities stained it, and the spirit embryo was in an acceptable condition for the soul.</p>

  <p>With almost no hitches, Xun managed to take it over. Then, it began growing rapidly until it transformed into Xun's current appearance.</p>

  <p>So the perfect temperament that Luo Luo Zheng had felt from her didn't originate from her own soul but from the spirit embryo.</p>

  <p>But Xun didn't know about the entire universe's situation, nor did she know the position of the Demon Night race's Supreme Lords. After taking over the spirit embryo and witnessing the Ancestral Dragon devour all the Faith Energy from Ying's Pool of Faith, she felt somewhat guilty. She didn't hold a grudge against Ying, after all.</p>

  <p>After Xun and the Ancestral Dragon left the Inauguration Altar, she noticed Luo Luo Zheng, followed by Yao. Naturally, in her eyes, Yao was an opponent? the two of them were always enemies.</p>

  <p>With the will of the worlds, Luo Luo Zheng could see everything happening in the Inauguration Altar, which was why he had stayed and waited for the moment Xun left. But he wasn't aware of how many memories there were regarding her at the altar. Seeing how confused she was, he used sound transmission to tell her about everything that had happened in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, including how she had lost her memories and all the changes that went down in the Demon Night race.</p>

  <p>Only after hearing Luo Zheng's words did Xun understand the Demon Night race's current situation.</p>

  <p>This also led to her understanding of Ying's words? because of the existence of the Soul-sealing Needle, Ying's position must have been different from her own. After erasing the Soul-sealing Needle, Xun had no clue what it was.</p>

  <p>The issue of the needle was more complex than what she could deal with right away. But her gaze flew past Yao and suddenly fell on Supreme Lord Korbin.</p>

  <p>As the Queen of Killings, Xun was by no means a soft-hearted woman. Even if her own race's Supreme Lords had committed an unforgivable sin, she would be decisive and make her move without hesitation.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Korbin, who had been preparing to run away, suddenly activated the Grand Teleportation, ready to flee.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>A blazing white power of the Space Law began blooming underneath his feet as he dissipated.</p>

  <p>"You want to escape?"</p>

  <p>This put a frown on Luo Zheng's and Supreme Lord Leroy's faces. Supreme Lords could teleport swiftly and travel far off in a blink of an eye. If a Supreme Lord had the intention of escaping, it made killing him all too difficult. Although Luo Zheng's Death Chain could lock down the Supreme Lord, the other end of it was still locked onto Supreme Lord Shadow.</p>

  <p>But just as Supreme Lord Korbin was about to use Grand Teleportation to escape, the Ancestral Dragon began to move. Suddenly, it raised its neck and its head shot out, opening its mouth wide, fiercely biting down on the void.</p>

  <p>Although the Ancestral Dragon's body was now enormous, its movements were unimaginably fast? they simply didn't match the creature's massive size.</p>

  <p>As it opened his mouth, everyone could see something inside it and hear Supreme Lord Korbin's rage. A mass of cyan flames exploded within the dragon's mouth? it was Supreme Lord Korbin's counterattack!</p>

  <p>But the Ancestral Dragon closed its mouth, sucking back in the cyan flames. After it chewed for a moment, the angry roars from within its mouth turned lighter and lighter.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Korbin had actually been chewed up and swallowed by the dragon.</p>

  <p>When Supreme Lord Shadow and the rest of them saw the scene, they sucked in a cold breath of air? none of them could understand why the dragon would bite down on Supreme Lord Korbin when he had already used Grand Teleportation.</p>
