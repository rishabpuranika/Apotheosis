  <h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 616 Spear Of Annihilation (Part Two) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  <p>Wisps of gray death aura gathered around Frank's white spear. A single glance at it hurt the souls of the warriors as if they had been damaged somehow. With the white spear in his hand, Frank was like a spirit from the ghostdom. "My skill of Spear of Annihilation can destroy every way in the world! Zheng, let me see how you fight me now!" he bellowed.</p>

  <p>Watching the extremely powerful spear, Zheng's expression was grave. He began his Exterminating Wheel at once.</p>

  <p>At the same time, he drew three pieces of malicious aura from the Killing Sword Mountain.</p>

  <p>The cultivation method employed in the use of malicious aura was usually extraordinary. One piece of malicious aura could equip the skill with great power, while three of them could do that much more.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng had not stored up too much of the malicious aura. When he had been back at the Luo Clan, he received some malicious aura after killing the Blood Prisoner. Then he entered Cloud Road and gathered some piecemeal, stocking in the Killing Sword Mountain. Besides that, he also gained some on the Dead Road by killing hundreds of Dark Devil Phantoms in battle.</p>

  <p>Zheng felt reluctant to use so much of his malicious aura in a single fight alone. But he had to pull out all stops contending with Frank.</p>

  <p>"Zheng Luo, you must die!" Frank roared again.</p>

  <p>The Spear of Annihilation together with the strong death aura rushed at Zheng. The bystanders felt their hearts tighten. Frank had inherited it all from Emanuel. No one knew exactly how powerful the skill was, but all of them sensed the great strong force reverberating behind it.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Zheng waved his sword, the three bits of malicious aura blazing forth.</p>

  <p>Generally, a warrior who had cultivated in the killing way had abundant malicious aura with him. Others could sense it when upon seeing such a warrior. Zheng's sword spirit, Lily, was such an example. If he called her out, others could sense the malicious aura in her at the very first sight itself.</p>

  <p>But things were different with Zheng. When Zheng had put his malicious aura in the Killing Sword Mountain, he looked quite ordinary, as if he did not have any of that aura with him. Now that his malicious aura had emerged out, he looked like a malicious god himself.</p>

  <p>"What? How does he look so different now? He has such a strong malicious aura! He didn't seem like he practiced in the killing way before, did he?" an elite disciple asked.</p>

  <p>"You are right. I never sensed any malicious aura in him before. So how did he...?" someone else commented.</p>

  <p>"It's incredible that Zheng chose the killing way. Isn't he afraid of getting hurt by the malicious aura?"</p>

  <p>Just as the elite disciples looked on in wonder, Zheng put the three pieces of malicious aura into his Blood Drinking Sword. He raised a foot and pulled back his arm, his body tilting forward as the sword rushed at the Exterminating Wheel swiftly.</p>

  <p>Ping!</p>

  <p>The malicious aura, as thick as a man's arm, swerved toward Frank ominously.</p>

  <p>Generally, the elite disciples did not use their real powers when fighting each other. They stopped before they hurt their opponents for real.</p>

  <p>But at the moment, both Zheng and Frank seemed to want to use their best skills. The other elite disciples standing close and watching them now stepped back, fearing getting hurt by this great power.</p>

  <p>Ping!</p>

  <p>They had expected the two would make quite a stir when they started fighting. But this was beyond their imaginations. They heard a light brittle sound. Zheng's Blood Drinking Sword had hit Frank's white spear.</p>

  <p>As if in a daze, the other elite disciples saw with their very own eyes how Frank's white spear started to crack. Little by little, the medium-grade spiritual weapon splintered like rotten wood until it was nothing but a number of lone white fragments.</p>

  <p>The white spear kept breaking from the pointy end like a chain reaction until the malicious aura arrived at the handle that Frank's palm was circled around. The onlookers saw how his arm twisted into an unbelievable shape. Then they heard the same noise of a crack coming from his arm.</p>

  <p>The bones in his right arm had been shattered into pieces just like the white spear in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Ahhh!"</p>

  <p>The severe pain made Frank shriek. He collapsed, rolling over on the ground in agony.</p>

  <p>Finlay Zhuo rushed over to Frank, taking out a fresh, white pill. He put it in Frank's mouth. Although Frank took the healing pill in time, his right arm barely recovered. It was certainly not as strong as it had been previously. A broken bone could be healed by pills, but it would take a long time for Frank's arm to fully recover. Moreover, even if the bones were all healed and patched up, the arm would not be as strong as it used to be.</p>

  <p>Finlay's face fell. He stood up, watching Zheng with a cold smile. "I never expected you to be so powerful. You not only survived Frank's Spear of Annihilation but also broke his arm." Finlay clenched his jaw, barely holding back his anger.</p>

  <p>Zheng blinked, smiling calmly. "Spare me your accusations. Frank would have killed me if I hadn't broken his bones. In some ways, I was kind enough to break only his one arm. I should have taken his life for what he wanted to do to me."</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!" Finlay stared at him menacingly. As Finlay shouted, his blood-red spear flew at Zheng.</p>

  <p>Finlay was at grade nine of the Illuminating Soul Realm, which meant he was close to consummation at the realm. He was far stronger than the other opponents Zheng had met.</p>

  <p>However, as Finlay's spear zoomed at him, Zheng's body suddenly drifted into the air. He was flying!</p>

  <p>Seeing this, the elite disciples were stunned. Their eyes widened, rounding into saucers. They were gobsmacked. Was Zheng actually a nature creature? If so, how could he fly?</p>
