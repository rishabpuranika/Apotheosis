  <h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 616 Spear Of Annihilation (Part Two) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  <p>Wisps of gray death Mu Ning gathered around Frank's white spear. A single glance at it hurt the souls of the warriors as if they had been damaged somehow. With the white spear in his hand, Frank was like a spirit from the ghostdom. "My skill of Spear of Annihilation can destroy every way in the world! Luo Luo Zheng, let me see how you fight me now!" he bellowed.</p>

  <p>Watching the extremely powerful spear, Luo Zheng's expression was grave. He began his Exterminating Wheel at once.</p>

  <p>At the same time, he drew three pieces of malicious Mu Ning from the Killing Sword Mountain.</p>

  <p>The cultivation method employed in the use of malicious Mu Ning was usually extraordinary. One piece of malicious Mu Ning could equip the skill with great power, while three of them could do that much more.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng had not stored up too much of the malicious Mu Ning. When he had been back at the Luo Clan, he received some malicious Mu Ning after killing the Blood Prisoner. Then he entered Cloud Road and gathered some piecemeal, stocking in the Killing Sword Mountain. Besides that, he also gained some on the Dead Road by killing hundreds of Dark Devil Phantoms in battle.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng felt reluctant to use so much of his malicious Mu Ning in a single fight alone. But he had to pull out all stops contending with Frank.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng Luo, you must die!" Frank roared again.</p>

  <p>The Spear of Annihilation together with the strong death Mu Ning rushed at Luo Luo Zheng. The bystanders felt their hearts tighten. Frank had inherited it all from Emanuel. No one knew exactly how powerful the skill was, but all of them sensed the great strong force reverberating behind it.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Luo Luo Zheng waved his sword, the three bits of malicious Mu Ning blazing forth.</p>

  <p>Generally, a warrior who had cultivated in the killing way had abundant malicious Mu Ning with him. Others could sense it when upon seeing such a warrior. Luo Zheng's sword spirit, Lily, was such an example. If he called her out, others could sense the malicious Mu Ning in her at the very first sight itself.</p>

  <p>But things were different with Luo Luo Zheng. When Luo Luo Zheng had put his malicious Mu Ning in the Killing Sword Mountain, he looked quite ordinary, as if he did not have any of that Mu Ning with him. Now that his malicious Mu Ning had emerged out, he looked like a malicious god himself.</p>

  <p>"What? How does he look so different now? He has such a strong malicious Mu Ning! He didn't seem like he practiced in the killing way before, did he?" an elite disciple asked.</p>

  <p>"You are right. I never sensed any malicious Mu Ning in him before. So how did he...?" someone else commented.</p>

  <p>"It's incredible that Luo Luo Zheng chose the killing way. Isn't he afraid of getting hurt by the malicious Mu Ning?"</p>

  <p>Just as the elite disciples looked on in wonder, Luo Luo Zheng put the three pieces of malicious Mu Ning into his Blood Drinking Sword. He raised a foot and pulled back his arm, his body tilting forward as the sword rushed at the Exterminating Wheel swiftly.</p>

  <p>Ping!</p>

  <p>The malicious Mu Ning, as thick as a man's arm, swerved toward Frank ominously.</p>

  <p>Generally, the elite disciples did not use their real powers when fighting each other. They stopped before they hurt their opponents for real.</p>

  <p>But at the moment, both Luo Luo Zheng and Frank seemed to want to use their best skills. The other elite disciples standing close and watching them now stepped back, fearing getting hurt by this great power.</p>

  <p>Ping!</p>

  <p>They had expected the two would make quite a stir when they started fighting. But this was beyond their imaginations. They heard a light brittle sound. Luo Zheng's Blood Drinking Sword had hit Frank's white spear.</p>

  <p>As if in a daze, the other elite disciples saw with their very own eyes how Frank's white spear started to crack. Little by little, the medium-grade spiritual weapon splintered like rotten wood until it was nothing but a number of lone white fragments.</p>

  <p>The white spear kept breaking from the pointy end like a chain reaction until the malicious Mu Ning arrived at the handle that Frank's palm was circled around. The onlookers saw how his arm twisted into an unbelievable shape. Then they heard the same noise of a crack coming from his arm.</p>

  <p>The bones in his right arm had been shattered into pieces just like the white spear in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Ahhh!"</p>

  <p>The severe pain made Frank shriek. He collapsed, rolling over on the ground in agony.</p>

  <p>Finlay Zhuo rushed over to Frank, taking out a fresh, white pill. He put it in Frank's mouth. Although Frank took the healing pill in time, his right arm barely recovered. It was certainly not as strong as it had been previously. A broken bone could be healed by pills, but it would take a long time for Frank's arm to fully recover. Moreover, even if the bones were all healed and patched up, the arm would not be as strong as it used to be.</p>

  <p>Finlay's face fell. He stood up, watching Luo Luo Zheng with a cold smile. "I never expected you to be so powerful. You not only survived Frank's Spear of Annihilation but also broke his arm." Finlay clenched his jaw, barely holding back his anger.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng blinked, smiling calmly. "Spare me your accusations. Frank would have killed me if I hadn't broken his bones. In some ways, I was kind enough to break only his one arm. I should have taken his life for what he wanted to do to me."</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!" Finlay stared at him menacingly. As Finlay shouted, his blood-red spear flew at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Finlay was at grade nine of the Illuminating Soul Realm, which meant he was close to consummation at the realm. He was far stronger than the other opponents Luo Luo Zheng had met.</p>

  <p>However, as Finlay's spear zoomed at him, Luo Zheng's body suddenly drifted into the air. He was flying!</p>

  <p>Seeing this, the elite disciples were stunned. Their eyes widened, rounding into saucers. They were gobsmacked. Was Luo Luo Zheng actually a nature creature? If so, how could he fly?</p>
