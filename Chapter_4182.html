<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The very next day, tens of thousands of Evil Gods appeared all over the entire Source World.</p>

  <p>Each Evil God stood far away from each other. Their distance was of several provinces apart. They were equally distributed throughout the outer layer of the Source World.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, the Evil Gods whispered, "Space truth..."</p>

  <p>The Evil God's current understanding of the space truth had reached an even higher level. With this, he was able to use the power of space freely.</p>

  <p>Countless wisps of space as thick as a thumb had intertwined around the Evil Gods. They each formed a structure that looked like a fishing net.</p>

  <p>Under the Evil Gods' control, the fishing nets fanned out in every direction with them as the center.</p>

  <p>After a few minutes, each of them had already covered a hundred thousand feet.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, they had expanded to one billion feet.</p>

  <p>About two hours later, each space net had covered an area that was as large as a whole province.</p>

  <p>After six hours, the space nets laid out by each Evil God began to interlink.</p>

  <p>Moments later, all of the space nets in every corner of the world had connected. The entire Source World was now completely covered.</p>

  <p>Previously, the enormous Source World had been attracting innumerable heads. Before the space nets completely enveloped it, these heads were like a school of fish affected by the tide. They rushed towards the only remaining weak points of this world.</p>

  <p>But as soon as the space nets covered those weak points, the heads instantly lost their targets. They fled outside the Source World like headless chickens.</p>

  <p>Due to their low intelligence, they had no idea what had just happened.</p>

  <p>They only knew that their prey had mysteriously disappeared.</p>

  <p>Instinctively, these heads devoured everything that could be devoured. It seemed that the creatures of their kind were also on their menus. Soon enough, the situation became even more chaotic. They began to devour each other frenziedly.</p>

  <p>In the hall, there was a space wall that showed the movements outside the Source World. With this, the Evil God could monitor the situation outside without going out himself.</p>

  <p>"Amazing! They are really not attacking the Source World anymore. Has the Source World been saved?" Edna asked the Evil God. Her face was full of admiration and gratitude.</p>

  <p>"Of course," the Evil God replied. There was a gentle smile on his face.</p>

  <p>He seemed to be in a good mood.</p>

  <p>The next thing on their list was to clean up the remaining heads inside the Source World. It was time to exterminate them.</p>

  <p>There were countless heads that managed to enter the Source World. In addition to that, there were many heads that grew rapidly and were ten thousand times larger than others. Nevertheless, it wasn't really difficult to kill these heads.</p>

  <p>After a short while, they suddenly heard footsteps from outside the hall.</p>

  <p>Shera slowly walked in and stopped beside the Evil God.</p>

  <p>She hardly paid any attention to Edna. She merely turned to the Evil God and said, "Someone on the Other Shore wants to see you."</p>

  <p>"Is it the Grandmaster of Heaven again? He's not needed here. If it is him, he doesn't have to descend. The crisis in the Source World is over," the Evil God said casually. He just kept watching the space wall.</p>

  <p>"It's over? But how..." Shera was slightly stunned at this news. "Those heads..." She couldn't find the right words as she watched what was happening outside through the space wall.</p>

  <p>"I have already blocked them from the outside. Although, it will take a few more days to get rid of the heads within the Source World," the Evil God responded indifferently.</p>

  <p>"How did you do that?" Once again, her face was full of utter amazement.</p>

  <p>"Our effort is the most decisive factor," the Evil God replied calmly. "So, you can tell the Grandmaster of Heaven that he is not needed here anymore."</p>

  <p>"It's not the Grandmaster of Heaven who is coming this time," Shera informed him.</p>

  <p>"Then, who else? Is it Samantha, Sienna, and Stella this time?" The Evil God rarely had visitors. He wondered who it could be.</p>

  <p>"No. It's a Bird Master," Shera answered.</p>

  <p>"And who or what is that? I've never heard of it before." The Evil God's curiosity was aroused.</p>

  <p>"Once before, you asked me why a powerful giant ape would appear on the Pear Hill. This Bird Master and the giant ape actually belong to the same category. Therefore, he will be able to answer your question," Shera replied simply.</p>

  <p>In the Jade Pure Realm, the Snake Spirit Sect and the Bird Spirit Sect waged a fierce war against each other. But in the end, the Bird Spirit Sect suffered a crushing defeat.</p>

  <p>At the final moment of their battle, the Snake Spirit King almost destroyed the Bird Spirit King's coordinates!</p>

  <p>But for some unknown reason, the Snake Spirit King did not go through with it and decided to spare the Bird Spirit Sect. No one knew what kind of news he heard during that moment.</p>

  <p>Through their coordinates, all of the Bird Masters and Treacherous Beings that perished in the war could revive. This meant that their defeat did not cause substantial losses. However, it made the Bird Masters understand a simple yet painful truth.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit Sect was far stronger than the Bird Spirit Sect. It would be absolutely impossible to defeat them on the Other Shore!</p>

  <p>For this reason, the Bird Spirit Sect summoned the members of the Nihility race in secret. And so during that period of time, the Black Ship was not able to contact the Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>Now, the Bird Spirit Sect knew that the Evil God was in control of the Source World. Hence, they fixed their eyes upon the chaos once again.</p>

  <p>After the Evil God heard this news from Shera, his expression became guarded. "Fine, I want to meet him."</p>

  <p>With that, Shera smiled sweetly and took out the Descending Ring.</p>

  <p>Flash! The entire hall was covered in bright light.</p>

  <p>As the Descending Ring radiated with a dazzling golden light, it floated into the air. Shortly after, the figure of a giant bird slowly appeared in front of the Evil God.</p>

  <p>This gigantic bird was none other than the Bird Master, Duran.</p>

  <p>The Evil God immediately sensed the incredible aura of the Bird Master.</p>

  <p>He opened his eyes a little wider.</p>

  <p>There was no doubt that this bird was very powerful.</p>

  <p>He almost had the same extraordinary aura as the giant ape.</p>

  <p>But Duran's strength was still far inferior to that of the giant ape!</p>

  <p>"Greetings, Bird Master!" Shera instantly bowed low.</p>

  <p>Duran didn't pay any attention to her. Instead, he looked directly at the Evil God in front of him. His sharp eyes were scrutinizing every bit of the Evil God.</p>

  <p>"Are you the one who controls the Source World?" Duran asked straightforwardly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is me," the Evil God replied impassively.</p>

  <p>"Very well..." Duran turned away from him and faced a blank wall.</p>

  <p>He then stretched out his sharp and enormous wings. With that, he gently scratched the wall of the hall.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! They heard a loud cutting sound.</p>

  <p>The Evil God, Edna, and Shera only saw the movement of Duran's wings.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, half of the hall was cut off. With a gentle flap of his wings, a strong gust of wind blew the upper half of the hall away. It drifted off ten thousand miles away from them.</p>

  <p>Duran looked around the immense space. "This is the only successful thing the Grandmaster of Heaven has done. He has finally helped us gain control of the Source World."</p>

  <p>It was indeed an unexpected advantage to seize control of the primitive land. Nevertheless, it was a huge success for them.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, the Evil God frowned. "Just to clarify, it is not you that control the Source World, but me. This is my world," the Evil God stated coldly.</p>

  <p>Duran looked at the Evil God and remembered something.</p>

  <p>Before he descended, the Grandmaster of Heaven gave him a warning.</p>

  <p>The Evil God was very rebellious. He should not try to completely take over him. He needed to be more patient and show the Evil God more respect.</p>

  <p>Duran was a smart creature.</p>

  <p>Even though he was a superior Bird Master, he was perfectly fine with being humble in front of a mere human. He could restrain his arrogance and would do whatever it took to achieve their goal. As Duran remembered this, he smiled faintly. "That's right. Now, the Bird Spirit Sect and the Nihility race need to rely on you."</p>

  <p>The Bird Master quickly adopted a friendly attitude. Duran's sudden change of tack surprised the Evil God. He continued to ask, "What exactly are you? You don't seem like living creatures, yet you have an incredible amount of strength. The giant ape is even more remarkable..."</p>

  <p>The scene in which the giant ape moved the Pear Hill out flashed through the Evil God's mind. It was a surreal and astonishing thing to witness.</p>

  <p>"We are a level higher than you. We are also the builders of the chaos.</p>

  <p>When we die, we will become what I am right now. You can treat us as souls. However, we are called the Treacherous Beings on the Other Shore," answered Duran.</p>

  <p>Realization dawned upon the Evil God. "The Treacherous Being... Did that giant ape also die and become a Treacherous Being?" he asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"Yes. He is the Monkey Spirit King, one of the known four kings." Duran nodded.</p>

  <p>"Even though the Monkey Spirit King is dead, he still has that much strength. What kind of creature was he when he was alive? How could he be so powerful?" the Evil God wondered out loud. It was quite incredible to come across such a powerful being.</p>

  <p>"He used to be the strongest warrior in the main world. Even if he is in the form of the Treacherous Being now, he is still powerful," Duran said with a slight smile.</p>

  <p>The Evil God looked at Duran. "What about you? Do you also have a king? Is he that powerful too?" The Evil God couldn't quite contain his curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Our Bird Spirit King is on par with the Monkey Spirit King," replied Duran. His eyes were full of pride and admiration.</p>
