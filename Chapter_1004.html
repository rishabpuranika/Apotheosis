  <p>
</p>

  <p>The fall of the Ethereal Spirit Sect was a piece of grave news for all of Central Region.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Evil Sect had emerged victoriously in the siege of Ethereal City, completely annihilating its entire population through a direct massacre.</p>

  <p>Before the city's siege, all the martial artists had left to fight and protect the Ethereal Spirit Sect. Only a few warriors remained and the majority of the people within the city were ordinary, non-martial artist residents.</p>

  <p>The sect battle did not concern them too much. The result of the fight between the Ethereal Spirit Sect and Heavenly Evil Sect would only serve to change the banners that hung on their city's walls. The winning sect would rule Ethereal City and they were willing to blindly follow.</p>

  <p>They were so sure that they wouldn't be touched by the war outside their walls. How wrong their assumptions all were.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Evil Sect had no need for blind followers. After the breach of the city gates, the independent warriors that comprised of Eddie's forces immediately set out to burn and pillage everything in sight. They left nothing and no one behind.</p>

  <p>The Cloud Hall's elders, upon receiving the news, naturally felt depressed and hopeless.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng felt pity especially for Mu Ning with the drastic change that this piece of news entailed for her.</p>

  <p>A steward entered the meeting hall to report. "The Xi Clan of Ethereal City requests a meeting!" he announced.</p>

  <p>"Let them enter Cloud Hall and bring them to me," Ning Yudie ordered.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning quickly wiped her tears away. Just how many of their people survived? Did Brent survive? How about her father?</p>

  <p>Not long after, several people entered the meeting hall. The one in the lead wore the black robe of the Ethereal Spirit Sect. He clasped his hands in greeting, "Greetings, Master Ning."</p>

  <p>Mu Ning swept her gaze at the newcomers but could not find the ones she was looking for. "Didn't they say that the Xi Clan would come?</p>

  <p>You're all elders of the Ethereal Spirit Sect. Where are the members of my clan? Where's my father? Where are my uncles? Where is Brent, Jacob?"</p>

  <p>She was right. The ones in front of them were not members of the Xi Clan but were instead members of the Ethereal Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>The one in front was Jacob Qiu, a member of the Ethereal Spirit Sect who had a good relationship with the Xi Clan. He had managed to reach the Virtual Tribulation Realm in his thirties and would be soon promoted as an elder.</p>

  <p>He was also one of Margaret's pursuers.</p>

  <p>Once, for her birthday, he scoured all of Central Region's mountains to gather Radiant Light Grass seeds as a present. He strung all the precious seeds together and gave it to her as a bracelet.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning did not find his gift pleasant or endearing and immediately threw it on the ground. It made him extremely angry, but he could not do anything for the sake of the sect leader.</p>

  <p>Now, he stood in front of her as a survivor of the Ethereal City's siege.</p>

  <p>He gazed up coldly at her. "The entire Xi Clan was exterminated and your father was killed. Brent is also missing. All because of you."</p>

  <p>His words shook Mu Ning to the core. "W-what are you talking about?" she stuttered. "Because of me? What did I do?"</p>

  <p>"If it weren't for you, the Heavenly Evil Sect wouldn't have attacked in the first place! Eddie did not desire the sect's inheritance! What he truly wanted was you!"</p>

  <p>Jacob snorted cruelly.</p>

  <p>"No! That's not true!"</p>

  <p>Mu Ning screamed, crying even harder.</p>

  <p>Jacob scoffed. "I'm telling the truth!" he said, ignoring her tears. "If you hadn't refused to marry someone, the Heavenly Evil Sect might not have taken the Ethereal Spirit Sect by surprise."</p>

  <p>Truth be told, Jacob enjoyed seeing Mu Ning fall so hard from grace.</p>

  <p>Jacob was a proud person. He was a heaven-level talent and was considered an outstanding warrior. Before Brent came, Jacob had been the number one talent of the Ethereal Spirit Sect. However, Margaret's rejection years ago completely disgraced him and reduced him to a laughingstock.</p>

  <p>Now that both the Xi Clan and Ethereal Spirit Sect were ruined, he knew that there was no way she could continue being arrogant in front of him.</p>

  <p>"No! You're lying! It's not because of me!" The thought of having brought disaster to the Xi Clan, the Ethereal Spirit Sect, and the entire Ethereal City - the pressure wasn't something that Mu Ning felt she could handle. Her mind was in shambles and all she could do was to repeatedly deny Jacob's words.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stood at the side and was mildly panicking. Mu Ning seemed to have reached her breaking point but he didn't really know what to do.</p>

  <p>Jacob, however, continued to sneer, "Our leader has fallen into Eddie's hands. Eddie wants you as an exchange!"</p>

  <p>"My great-grandfather isn't dead. You want to trade me for him?"</p>

  <p>Mu Ning asked in disbelief.</p>

  <p>"Yes! This is the only thing you're good for!"</p>

  <p>Jacob told her harshly.</p>

  <p>Even if the Ethereal Spirit Sect had been destroyed, it could be always rebuilt through Xander's powers. However, his overall strength would've been greatly reduced, so the sect, which originally had a fifth-grade status, would be demoted to fourth-grade.</p>

  <p>The only way to get him back, however, was for Mu Ning to go into Eddie's arms. This was the reason why Jacob and the rest of the sect came into Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>"To get my great-grandfather back?" Mu Ning repeated, nodding her head dumbly. However, as she repeated these words, something seemed to have crossed her mind and her body suddenly trembled. "No!" she screamed. "No! I can't do it!"</p>

  <p>"How can you refuse such a critical decision?"</p>

  <p>Jacob asked, pressuring her further.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning shook her head and began to cry, "No… I really can't do it.</p>

  <p>Please, I can't…"</p>

  <p>"It's not up to you! You have no choice!"</p>

  <p>Jacob screamed, reaching out to grab her arm. Deep inside, he had a secret plan. Sure, they could use Mu Ning to get Xander back, but would that really solve everything? What was the use in rebuilding the Ethereal Spirit Sect? The Heavenly Evil Sect might be the ruler of the world in the future!</p>

  <p>It would just be a waste to surrender Mu Ning to Eddie. Jacob had been infatuated with her for a long time and now had the perfect opportunity to make her his. Her Purple Power Body was also a bonus. Margaret's powers would be extremely beneficial for him and, after he had sex with her, he could leave Central Region and settle down somewhere far, far away.</p>

  <p>However, just as he reached Mu Ning, Luo Zheng had stepped forward to block his way. "I'm afraid she can't do that," Luo Zheng muttered.</p>

  <p>Jacob frowned. "This is a matter of the Ethereal Spirit Sect. Who are you to interfere?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng sneered at Jacob's words, "First of all, Mu Ning isn't a member of the Ethereal Spirit Sect. She's a member of the Xi Clan and you, if I'm not mistaken, aren't really surnamed Xi. Secondly, if you give Mu Ning to Eddie, all the warriors of the world would suffer. Most importantly, it would indirectly harm my sister."</p>

  <p>"Are you  Luo Zheng Luo?" Jacob asked though, judging by his tone, he was pretty sure he was Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded in confirmation.</p>

  <p>"Even so, we must save our leader!" Jacob insisted.</p>

  <p>"Yes, we need to rescue our leader first! Luo Zheng, our leader's life is more precious than your sister's!"</p>

  <p>"Your sister will only lose her virginity. Eddie might not kill her!"</p>

  <p>"Agreed. The Lustful Demon Array is also good for girls. She won't suffer anyway!" a warrior of the Ethereal Spirit Sect chimed in.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was quick to pin him down. "Your leader is very important to you, huh?" he said viciously. "To me, my sister is the most important, while your leader is worthless. Do you understand?"</p>

  <p>Without any warning, Luo Zheng dealt a hard punch to the warrior's chest. The warrior was already at the Virtual Tribulation Realm but couldn't withstand a single blow from Luo Zheng. The punch sent him flying through the air and crashing onto the meeting hall's wall.</p>

  <p>The expressions of the members of the Ethereal Spirit Sect instantly darkened.</p>

  <p>"You're being unreasonable!" Jacob shouted in anger. "Is this how you bully others?"</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie and the elders of Cloud Hall remained silent, while Luo Zheng sneered at Jacob. He had no plans wasting his time to reason with a warrior. To him, his sister's safety had always been the top priority.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning felt her heart flutter at Zheng's actions. He had defended her at such a critical moment and she was thankful. Also she had realized that she no longer had any reason to retreat. Her back straightened as she glared at Jacob. "Actually, Luo Zheng also has a third reason!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng knew just what she was about to say, but the words were already out before he could even stop her. "I'm no longer a virgin!"</p>
