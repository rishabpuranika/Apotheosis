<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>After the Yellow Emperor race left, some managers from the Flying Sickle City came up to congratulate the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>Two of the managers belonged to the Yellow Emperor race's subsidiary sects, but they turned against them the first chance they got.</p>

  <p>After all, the Yellow Emperor race wouldn't be able to take care of the subsidiary sects when they decided to withdraw. These people would probably need to plan their own lives in the future. People without external motivation would easily betray the Yellow Emperor race.</p>

  <p>However, the people of the Nine Li race weren't in the mood to talk to them, so they dismissed them just after a few words.</p>

  <p>There was no need for the Nine Li race to manage their cities as the race's three major subsidiary sects would take care of everything.</p>

  <p>"The Sky South Bone Tower has been closed for 13, 000 years, and today, it's finally going to open. Adele, go ahead and open it with the others," Ramzi said to his daughter with a smile.</p>

  <p>Adele nodded as she looked at her father with confusion. "Father, are you leaving so soon?"</p>

  <p>"No." Ramzi shook his head before shifting his gaze toward the top of the Sky South Bone Tower. "I still have to check on something."</p>

  <p>All of the Nine Li race's exiles were staring at this spot when Zheng fought David, but none of them had noticed Tyler hiding in the void. The moment he fell out of the void, they sensed a strong force rushing towards him.</p>

  <p>The force almost disappeared immediately. However, Ramzi could tell that it was the power that forced Tyler to come out of the void.</p>

  <p>He had no idea who helped the Nine Li race at this critical moment, and whether friend or foe, he wanted to know who it was.</p>

  <p>He had already felt the force was coming from somewhere extremely high. Judging from the direction and distance, it must be coming from the top of the Sky South Bone Tower.</p>

  <p>"Okay."</p>

  <p>Adele nodded slightly, a little displeased.</p>

  <p>She was Ramzi's daughter, but she seldom saw her father in her whole life. And yet because of Zheng, her father had appeared several times. The difference in his attitudes toward Zheng and toward her was so great that she couldn't help but feel wronged..</p>

  <p>Ramzi smiled knowingly seeing his daughter's expression.</p>

  <p>"Do you still remember the stories I told you?" Adele heard her father speak using his life vitality. "Perhaps it wouldn't be long till we can go home."</p>

  <p>Adele was stunned when she heard this.</p>

  <p>Although she didn't see her father often in the past, she often heard his voice during her childhood.</p>

  <p>Whenever she felt upset, she would always run to the big screen to ask her father for comfort, and Ramzi would tell her a lot of interesting stories.</p>

  <p>And the stories he told were all set in the Source World.</p>

  <p>She had heard a myriad of ancient legends, from the Snake Goddess creating the human beings to all sorts of strange theurgies.</p>

  <p>And every time, she pestered her father to take her to the Source World.</p>

  <p>As she grew up, she realized that the world they were in was a huge prison and her father was one of the prisoners, which meant that she and the other Wild Gods were the children of the prisoners.</p>

  <p>Leaving the world was simply an impossible dream.</p>

  <p>Adele did not feel disappointed about their inability to leave this world.</p>

  <p>After all, she was one of the aboriginals of this world. This was her birthplace.</p>

  <p>However, after everything her father said, she felt her world turn upside down and she didn't know what to think or how to react.</p>

  <p>"Father, what do you mean?" she asked, using her life vitality.</p>

  <p>Ramzi smiled, "It's just a possibility. You'll know it one day."</p>

  <p>Adele did not know about the news that Zheng had given to the exiles, and Ramzi couldn't tell her just yet. Right now, he could only use it to comfort his daughter.</p>

  <p>To be candid, most of the exiles weren't completely sold on Zheng's news, but because they were desperate to leave this place, they would cling on to every little hope that came their way.</p>

  <p>Ramzi then waved his hand and a vortex appeared in front of him. He stepped into it, leaving Adele in a daze.</p>

  <p>It was not until Giacomo called her a few times that Adele came to her senses. She turned to the crowd and said, "Everyone, please follow me.</p>

  <p>We will open the Sky South Bone Tower!"</p>

  <p>When the Sky South Bone Tower was opened, it would become the second stronghold of the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>If it had been in the past, it would have brought great joy to Adele. After all, it meant that her race had expanded by a lot. There were quite a few races with strong blood in them, and yet they could only stay in the same bone tower. The Nine Li race now had two bone towers, and very few races could possess two bone towers.</p>

  <p>But just now her father had told her that they were going to leave this world.</p>

  <p>She finally understood what her father had told her before they set out.</p>

  <p>Her father had told her that the most important thing was not the outcome of the battle but that Zheng remained unharmed. It seemed that her father and the others were planning something.</p>

  <p>On the top of the Sky South Bone Tower, No. 9527 hummed, satisfied with the arrow it just shot.</p>

  <p>It liked to sing when it was in a good mood, and it'd go as far as to call itself a soul singer. It was a fitting name in its opinion, as the song it sang could reach and intoxicate the soul.</p>

  <p>However, those old-fashioned brain masters were not into it and it was often forbidden to sing in the spiritual world.</p>

  <p>Just then, No. 9527 sensed something odd.</p>

  <p>'The exile of the Nine Li race is here, ' it thought to himself.</p>

  <p>Realizing this, No. 9527 went deep down into the bone tower.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the huge eyeball and the bow it created suddenly turned into white bone powder.</p>

  <p>The powder did not dissipate with the wind, but was quickly sucked into the bone tower. It didn't want to waste the Chaos Ancient God's bone powder.</p>

  <p>After No. 9527 disappeared, Ramzi stepped out of the vortex at the top of the Sky South Bone Tower.</p>

  <p>He wandered for a while before he released his spiritual sense, willing it to spread throughout the tower.</p>

  <p>"Here!"</p>

  <p>In a flash, he appeared at the other side of the Sky South Bone Tower.</p>

  <p>With his keen mind, he could feel the aftereffect of the remnant soul.</p>

  <p>However, as he looked at the bone tower, he couldn't help but feel that something was off.</p>

  <p>The fluctuation of the soul seemed to penetrate the inside of the bone tower.</p>

  <p>Since he had lived in another bone tower for many years, he knew very well that the bones of the Chaos Ancient God were abnormally strong.</p>

  <p>No living being possessed the strength to break through them and sneak into them.</p>

  <p>"Sure enough, the Chaos Ancient God is staring at Zheng,"</p>

  <p>Ramzi muttered, his brows furrowed together.</p>

  <p>The Chaos Ancient God had infused his own blood into Zheng's body when the latter was undergoing the Body Tribulations, which had almost killed Zheng.</p>

  <p>This time, the Chaos Ancient God personally forced Tyler out of the void.</p>

  <p>Ramzi didn't know why a creature at such a level would target Zheng.</p>

  <p>After all, for countless years, the Chaos Ancient God hadn't made any movement, and it was because of him that the group of exiles were alive in this world.</p>

  <p>From the looks of it, the Chaos Ancient God didn't hold any ill will towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>This was good news. With a sigh of relief, Ramzi stepped into the vortex once again.</p>
