<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The information that Luo Zheng had entrusted her to investigate hadn't been sent back from the divine land until now.</p>

  <p>However, what she didn't know was that this matter was far beyond her imagination.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of the mysterious girl, Luo Zheng was just a being born from the universe.</p>

  <p>She had been staying in this round of the heavens for many years, putting her heart and soul into the kalpas of three lives: the Past Solemn Kalpa, the Present Sage Kalpa, and the Future Constellation Kalpa.</p>

  <p>Although she really hated those Buddhists, she had to admit that they were powerful. She could only stay here and help take care of this round of heavens.</p>

  <p>Zheng's appearance had surprised her a lot.</p>

  <p>Moreover, she had never expected that his Roaring Token could trigger the Perception Sound, which was one of the rules of the heavens.</p>

  <p>After all, she was the one who had created the Roaring Tapir and placed it in the universe.</p>

  <p>Eons ago, she'd felt that the universe was too quiet, so when she created the Roaring Tapir, she gave it the Perception Sound, which was one of the rules of the heavens.</p>

  <p>The beings of the universe were all very intelligent. After discovering the Roaring Tapir's theurgy, they had immediately used it without restraint, which was why the universe was so lively now.</p>

  <p>However, the mysterious girl had not dared to cross the line. If there were too many Roaring Tapirs, the universe would become noisy and there would be no peace.</p>

  <p>As there was a fixed number of Roaring Tapirs, the Roaring Token had become valuable in the universe.</p>

  <p>But Zheng's Roaring Token was different.</p>

  <p>He could forcefully communicate with the heavens and activate the Perception Sound.</p>

  <p>The mysterious girl had once made five Roaring Tokens with no restrictions, but later, because the world of chaos ended, she had taken them all back.</p>

  <p>In other words, other than her, no one else in the universe could release the Perception Sound at will, except for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng's Roaring Token was truly extraordinary.</p>

  <p>There were many rules of the heavens and the mysterious girl was the one who was in charge of them.</p>

  <p>Even the authority to trigger the Perception Sound was in her hands.</p>

  <p>Some of the times when Luo Zheng had used the Roaring Token, she had tried to stop him.</p>

  <p>But strangely enough, she hadn't been able to stop him from activating the Perception Sound.</p>

  <p>The truth was, she bore no ill intention toward Luo Zheng. She was merely curious as to why Luo Zheng was able to do something that should have been impossible. Could it be that Luo Zheng had a higher authority in the heavens than she did?</p>

  <p>How could this happen?</p>

  <p>She had asked Luo Zheng this question, but he hadn't answered truthfully.</p>

  <p>She'd analyzed the situation and carefully pondered over it, but she hadn't been able to come up with anything.</p>

  <p>But from what she'd heard, she finally understood why it would take years to have news of Yan.</p>

  <p>'Well, these fellows have all lived for far too long. Have they gotten tired of living? Why did they make such a plan?</p>

  <p>Should I tell Luo Zheng or not?' the mysterious girl wondered.</p>

  <p>She would always do what she had promised, but she didn't know what Luo Zheng would think and whether or not it was appropriate to tell him in the first place.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, everyone watching the Illusion Battlefield was shocked.</p>

  <p>After seeing Luo Zheng defeat Cindy, they viewed him in a whole new light.</p>

  <p>This ordinary warrior had turned out to be much stronger than any of them had imagined.</p>

  <p>The 300 people in the battlefield could be more or less divided into three groups based on their strength.</p>

  <p>Godly Geniuses such as Nathan, Lawson, and Karl formed the first group.</p>

  <p>Lucille and Cindy were not Godly Geniuses, but they were qualified to be members of the first group too. Although their Lotus Flowers had not fully bloomed, they already had the strength to fight Godly Geniuses.</p>

  <p>But to everyone's surprise, Luo Zheng had defeated Cindy.</p>

  <p>Before that, he had killed Norvin with a single strike and then defeated two ace talents.</p>

  <p>His previous opponents could only be considered as members of the third group. They all existed on the fringes of this battle to lead the world of chaos.</p>

  <p>However, Cindy's case was different.</p>

  <p>More importantly, Cindy had lost to Luo Zheng in the elimination round.</p>

  <p>The meaning behind this was completely different.</p>

  <p>Cindy's defeat had sent the Ji Clan into complete chaos.</p>

  <p>Each of the four biggest clans had a seed, and the seed of the Ji Clan was Cindy.</p>

  <p>The Dream Godly Way she cultivated was quite special, so her clan had helped her formulate a few tricks and strategies to wield it.</p>

  <p>If she used these strategies, even Nathan and Lawson would find it hard to break out of her Emerald Dream.</p>

  <p>Using the peach blossoms as bait was her most common way of luring her opponents into her dream.</p>

  <p>She had been saving the other methods that she had come up with for the later stage of the competition, thinking that she would need them after entering the top ten.</p>

  <p>Her entire clan had been rooting for her to reach the top three.</p>

  <p>None of them had expected that she would be defeated by Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>She hadn't even gotten a Godly Plate, so this put her clan at the bottom of the four clans.</p>

  <p>To the Ji Clan, this was an extreme humiliation.</p>

  <p>By now, this news had most likely spread throughout the various sacred places under her clan.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," Cindy uttered.</p>

  <p>After leaving the Illusion Battlefield, she'd flown back to her clan's Illusion Space. Raising her head, she glanced at the painting and went to the leader of her clan.</p>

  <p>The leader sighed. "Alas. Forget it. Cindy, it is indeed a great regret that you were eliminated. But don't be discouraged. Continue to work hard in the future, and you will definitely become a Godly Genius one day."</p>

  <p>Cindy nodded slightly, and then silently left.</p>

  <p>Not far away, Janet was hugging her flame kitten, not saying a word.</p>

  <p>A few talents at the side looked at her and cautiously asked, "Janet, how did you know?"</p>

  <p>Janet had predicted this outcome earlier.</p>

  <p>At that time, everyone had been certain of Zheng's defeat.</p>

  <p>Staring at the painting, Janet shook her head and said indifferently, "It's not just Cindy that Luo Zheng could defeat. Nathan will also be in big trouble if he comes across Luo Zheng."</p>

  <p>All the people around Janet widened their eyes in surprise.</p>

  <p>Cindy was only slightly weaker than Lucille, but she was much weaker than Nathan.</p>

  <p>Was Luo Zheng really so powerful that he could defeat Nathan?</p>

  <p>Looking at their expressions, Janet smiled slightly. "It doesn't matter anymore. Our clan has already lost. Let's just wait and see!"</p>

  <p>On the Heaven Earth Board, the competition continued.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning once again activated the Purple River Sword Array, sealing her opponent within.</p>

  <p>With that, she won the battle.</p>

  <p>The next battle was not an elimination match, so after fighting for a short while, one of the warriors cupped his hands in resignation.</p>

  <p>Three battles later, it was Lucille's turn to fight.</p>

  <p>This was not an elimination match either.</p>

  <p>However, Lucille's opponent, an ogre ace talent, insisted on fighting.</p>

  <p>It seemed that he would rather die than admit defeat.</p>

  <p>Moreover, he displayed some strength that greatly surprised everyone.</p>

  <p>Given his strength, he was powerful enough to be classified under the second group.</p>

  <p>However, he couldn't win against a powerful being like Lucille by relying on his perseverance alone.</p>

  <p>Under Lucille's repeated attacks, he was finally killed.</p>

  <p>"It's a sheer waste of time!"</p>

  <p>Lucille said expressionlessly and returned to the sky.</p>

  <p>Then, finally extremely fierce battles unfolded in the center of the Heaven Earth Board.</p>

  <p>There were four consecutive elimination matches.</p>

  <p>Shania of the Demon Night eliminated an ogre ace talent.</p>

  <p>The Otherworldly Swordsman eliminated an ace talent of the Celestial Position.</p>

  <p>Then, with a single move from Nathan, an ace talent of some small clan was eliminated.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning fought again, eliminating an ace talent of the Night Group.</p>

  <p>With every elimination match, one person was eliminated, so in this short period of time, four people were eliminated.</p>

  <p>Along with the seesaw battles on the Heaven Earth Board, the probability of elimination had greatly increased.</p>

  <p>The 300 martial artists were eliminated one by one and the number of ace talents in the sky was rapidly shrinking.</p>

  <p>Not long after, more than half of the 300 candidates were eliminated.</p>

  <p>However, although quite a few people were eliminated, there were very few truly intense battles.</p>

  <p>After all, the Godly Geniuses hadn't even had a chance to face off against each other yet.</p>

  <p>It was unknown if it was because of the mysterious girl's deliberate arrangements or because of fate, but more and more people were eliminated quickly.</p>

  <p>147.</p>

  <p>120.</p>

  <p>77.</p>

  <p>30.</p>

  <p>Finally, the number dwindled down to 11.</p>

  <p>Everyone in the top ten would be able to acquire a Godly Plate.</p>

  <p>However, there were 11 of them right now.</p>

  <p>They were Luo Zheng, Mu Ning, Nathan, Lawson, Lucille, Tianming, Karl, Parker, Shania, the Otherworldly Swordsman, and Kurt.</p>

  <p>Among the 11 people, Luo Zheng, Mu Ning, and Lucille were the only ones who were not Godly Geniuses. And no one was sure whether Tianming was a Godly Genius or not.</p>

  <p>As for the other seven people, they were all Godly Geniuses with different powers. They had comprehended the Godly Way and possessed the internal momentum. They were the strongest in their generation, and they were favored by this era.</p>

  <p>Since only the top ten would get Godly Plates, everyone was eager to know who would be eliminated next.</p>

  <p>All the living creatures in the universe were watching the Illusion Space with bated breath.</p>

  <p>Of these 11 people, who would be the first to be eliminated?</p>
