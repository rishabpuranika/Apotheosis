<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3116 The Resurrection Eye </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The other weapon refiners were clearly baffled. However, Cailen had a vague idea of what had just happened.</p>

  <p>He was in charge of the Nine Edges Heaven Slaughtering Array. Thus, he knew the operation well like the palm of his hand. The extremely powerful sword radiance obviously came from Luo Zheng's direction.</p>

  <p>In addition to that, the idea of changing the array was suggested by Luo Zheng himself. His look of complete confidence from before had further verified Cailen's suspicion.</p>

  <p>Even so, Cailen kept thinking why the Soaring Snake Sword in his hand was only a replica.</p>

  <p>Either way, no one paid attention to Luo Zheng the moment the array began. It wouldn't be difficult for him to switch swords.</p>

  <p>In any case, Cailen had no intention of telling them what he had in mind.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's display of strength was truly extraordinary. Therefore, he thought that Luo Zheng probably came from a powerful lineage.</p>

  <p>Besides, they owed their lives to him. Considering that Luo Zheng was reluctant to reveal his trump card, it would be really thoughtless of him if he brought it up.</p>

  <p>Gant was very fortunate as he followed such a strong man.</p>

  <p>If everything worked out well, Gant would absolutely make a difference in the future.</p>

  <p>Cailen sighed deeply. They probably would have died today if he had actually stopped Gant that time.</p>

  <p>Now that Sebert was dead, Satchel and the rest of the Taiyi Guards would only come to a bad end.</p>

  <p>Cailen shouldered a heavy responsibility. He had to leave with the Shade Stone. Thus, he couldn't care about anything else.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, Cailen was not the only one who found out the truth.</p>

  <p>When the anomaly of the huge sword was discovered, Gant immediately thought of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He remembered that Luo Zheng had asked his uncle about the grade of the Soaring Snake Sword when he bought the fake one in the Dragon City. He seemed very concerned about it.</p>

  <p>During that time, both Gant and his uncle thought Luo Zheng only asked out of sheer curiosity.</p>

  <p>He had no idea why Luo Zheng even bought the fake Soaring Snake Sword. But now, he finally understood that Luo Zheng wanted to use it to hide the truth.</p>

  <p>The other weapon refiners also had their own speculations.</p>

  <p>Some of their ideas were actually good. However, they failed to sense where the power came from because they didn't operate the array themselves. They doubted Luo Zheng as well as each other. Some had even guessed that it was Cailen.</p>

  <p>Whatever the truth was, it didn't matter anymore for they had been saved from an inevitable death.</p>

  <p>The person who owned that amazing treasure surely had a powerful background. Weapon refiners like themselves should not get involved.</p>

  <p>Just as they were about to leave, they saw a fist-sized, round, brown ball. It appeared at the place where one of the winged women was killed.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, the ball burst open.</p>

  <p>A faint shadow floated out of it. It was Mary's figure!</p>

  <p>"That's a Latent token!" The look on Cailen's face abruptly changed.</p>

  <p>"It's the Resurrection Eye, a Latent token of the Jin Wu! We have to go! Now!"</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately, we have already been targeted by this thing so we won't be able to escape anymore."</p>

  <p>Some Latent Theurgies worked only after their owners were dead.</p>

  <p>For instance, some Latent Theurgies granted their owners a temporary life to take revenge even after they died.</p>

  <p>The Resurrection Eye was one of those and it was unique to the Jin Wu.</p>

  <p>This meant that Mary was dead. The faint shadow appeared as an eye. It only went after the people who killed her and sent back what it saw to the Jin Wu.</p>

  <p>She floated in the air and kept staring at the crowd icily.</p>

  <p>Whenever they walked forward, the shadow would follow them. It also stopped whenever they stopped.</p>

  <p>"It can't go on like this!"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid we won't be able to return to the Grand River Fortress."</p>

  <p>"Obviously, we need to destroy the Resurrection Eye!"</p>

  <p>Once more, they stopped and tried to destroy the shadow.</p>

  <p>The Jin Wu was good at flame and space theurgies. Therefore, it was not an easy task to defeat the Resurrection Eye.</p>

  <p>They were unable to beat the shadow no matter what kind of attack method they used.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng even tried several theurgies but ultimately failed just like the others.</p>

  <p>Soon after, the voice of No. 9527 rang clearly in Luo Zheng's mind. "It's useless.</p>

  <p>You won't be able to destroy the shadow with those methods. You can use the Falling Star Palm but..."</p>

  <p>The Falling Star Palm was not powerful enough on its own. But with the power of the Truth Crystal, it could reach its full potential and have a miraculous effect in special cases.</p>

  <p>A little while ago, Luo Zheng had already risked using the Soaring Snake Sword and had roused Cailen's suspicion.</p>

  <p>If he used the Falling Star Palm now, he would be exposed.</p>

  <p>Even though he had entered Dragon City, he still did not have a thorough understanding of the situation in the Source World. It would be unwise for him to reveal his true origin.</p>

  <p>But in order to survive, he had no other options left.</p>

  <p>Even before Luo Zheng could make up his mind, something unexpected happened.</p>

  <p>They saw Mary's shadow change as they felt a great pressure coming from the sky.</p>

  <p>Her looks kept changing while her aura continued to grow. Soon after, it overcame Mary herself.</p>

  <p>Cailen and the others were shocked when they saw the new face.</p>

  <p>It was the woman who appeared in the sky above the Blue Cloud City earlier. Her name was Phoenix and she owned the Divine Lair of the Jin Wu.</p>

  <p>A powerful nonhuman creature like her would be able to slay everyone with the Illusory Projection alone.</p>

  <p>The group would continue to fight desperately if it was only Mary.</p>

  <p>However, they had neither courage nor strength to hold out against Phoenix.</p>

  <p>Phoenix stared at the group beneath her.</p>

  <p>The look on her unrivaled face was as terrifying as death itself.</p>

  <p>"Hand over the Shade Stone to me," Phoenix said coldly.</p>

  <p>Her soul was extremely powerful. Even if it was only a projection, her words had an overwhelming and commanding force. No one was allowed to disobey that.</p>

  <p>Cailen remained rooted to the spot and was unable to respond.</p>

  <p>He could not believe that he had to surrender the Shade Stone to Phoenix moments after he had just escaped from a fatal disaster.</p>

  <p>"I said, hand it over!"</p>

  <p>Phoenix bellowed. Her aura grew much stronger and gave the crowd an ominous and oppressive feeling.</p>

  <p>Gant's soul was the weakest among all of them. His legs were trembling so much that he could barely stand.</p>

  <p>However, Phoenix suffered a huge loss from the Illusory Projection.</p>

  <p>The last time she performed it, she destroyed four Arrays of Innumerable Swords. But now that she did it again, her strength was less than half as before.</p>

  <p>She had no idea who had the Shade Stone. In addition to that, her projection would not be able to take anything away. She was just projecting a mass of pure energy.</p>

  <p>So for now, she forced the group to relinquish the Shade Stone. After that, she would ask a Sun Crow to take it back.</p>

  <p>Since they were unwilling to give her the Shade Stone, she would just savagely kill everyone then let her race members take it.</p>

  <p>Cailen already predicted what Phoenix was thinking. He was now frantically thinking of a way out.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Phoenix had lost her patience, Cailen brought out a small bottle and raised it above his head. "The Shade Stone is in this bottle!"</p>

  <p>Phoenix raised her eyebrows in response. Then, she stretched out her hand and the bottle floated toward her.</p>

  <p>While Phoenix was momentarily distracted, Cailen immediately told the group through his life vitality, "That bottle is empty! Run for your lives!"</p>

  <p>Phoenix would not let them go even if they handed over the Shade Stone to her. It would be best if they just took this opportunity to run away.</p>
