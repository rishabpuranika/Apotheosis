<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2900 Danger Outside The Divine Land </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Holy Jay told Estelle this because he was afraid that Estelle wouldn't dare to fight the Yellow Emperor Guards without strong support.</p>

  <p>The warrior at the Other Shore Realm from the Nine Li race had been in seclusion for many years and had never appeared in front of anyone. Now, however, since he had been summoned by Lorena, he couldn't refuse.</p>

  <p>Estelle thought for a moment before saying, "I will help you, but on one condition."</p>

  <p>"What is that?" Holy Jay asked. He was prepared to do Estelle almost any favor in exchange for her help.</p>

  <p>"You must get that man back for me," said Estelle resentfully.</p>

  <p>At this, a smile appeared on Holy Jay's face. The man that Estelle was referring to was, of course, none other than Bromley.</p>

  <p>"If we can successfully get through this crisis, Mike and I will do everything in our power to get Bromley back," Holy Jay said seriously.</p>

  <p>With that, they came to an agreement.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the depths of the Time Sea, a gigantic beast that was ten million feet tall was in deep slumber.</p>

  <p>Each fragment of the Time Sea was a slice of the past of the divine land.</p>

  <p>There were, of course, countless slices. Every second that ticked away turned into a fragment that sank into the Time Sea. Many of these fragments were meaningless.</p>

  <p>For example, a bird flying over the divine land was a fragment, and so was a tree that had been broken.</p>

  <p>But it was fragments of trivial things like these that made up the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>Therefore, it had once been inferred that time and space could not be separated. However, no one from the divine land was able to comprehend this.</p>

  <p>And it was because of the existence of so many fragments that it had been impossible for Nicholas to find Lorena's body.</p>

  <p>It had been like looking for a needle in a haystack.</p>

  <p>It was under all these fragments of time that the enormous ferocious beast slept peacefully. It was none other than the Emperor Resentment, the beast that the Sun Blind people were most afraid of.</p>

  <p>It would wake up occasionally, but most of the time, it slept.</p>

  <p>As its dozens of huge tentacles swayed with the waves, there was a sharp movement above it. On the head of the Emperor Resentment, a person sat up. There was a unique rune floating in front of him.</p>

  <p>It was a space rune that could be used in the same way as the Yellow Emperor Magatama of the Yellow Emperor Guards. It allowed the Nine Li people to communicate with one another from a distance.</p>

  <p>Although it could only transmit voices over a short distance and couldn't be compared to the Yellow Emperor Magatama, it was more than enough to facilitate the communication within the divine land.</p>

  <p>"I'm not a coward. Although I might not be powerful enough, I will not hesitate to sacrifice my life for the Nine Li race. But I don't understand one thing. What makes the Mountain of Holy Beings so important?" the man, whose name was Leif, murmured to the space rune in front of him.</p>

  <p>Although he was a powerhouse at the Other Shore Realm, he was much weaker than the Nine Li Guards, so he wasn't qualified to join them.</p>

  <p>"It's my husband's idea," answered Lorena.</p>

  <p>A trace of helplessness appeared on Leif's face. In the eyes of the Nine Li people, Mike didn't deserve Lorena. However, it was not Leif's place to comment on such things. He had no choice but to agree to Lorena's request.</p>

  <p>"I will wake up the Emperor Resentment and send it out of the Time Sea."</p>

  <p>Previously, he had had to flee when facing Hamish. Now that he was going to face other Yellow Emperor Guards, who were even stronger than Hamish, he knew that he would not stand a chance, but he could not disobey Lorena's request either.</p>

  <p>In just one day, the fairy palace became empty.</p>

  <p>Everyone left resolutely this time, even Saul.</p>

  <p>Moon, Marsh, Augustus, Mike, Harold, and Zheng were left to guard the Swirl Forest.</p>

  <p>In the open space of the forest, the internal momentum of the Evolution Godly Way formed a huge star plate.</p>

  <p>Mike stood inside the star plate while Harold stood on the other side.</p>

  <p>There were countless snow-white stars circling within the plate. Their trajectory seemed to be chaotic and disorderly, but in fact, they indicated the fate of the evolution.</p>

  <p>Even though Harold and Zheng had reached the consummation of the Evolution Godly Way, they still found it difficult to interpret the movement of the stars when they saw them rapidly flashing past. The Evolution Godly Way was, in itself, an unpredictable Godly Way. The speed at which the stars flew was too fast, leaving them no time to study them.</p>

  <p>A glint flashed in Mike's eyes as he firmly stared at the star plate without blinking for fear of missing even a single detail.</p>

  <p>"Fourteen bright stars lie in the Self Palace. The Money God Star goes downward, the Sheep Star and the Camel Star move right..."</p>

  <p>The star plate could be used to foretell small events, but this time, Mike needed to foretell the fate of the entire divine land. Since the strong Yellow Emperor Guards and the powerhouses outside the divine land were also involved, there were too many variables, so it was a hard task for him.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>The star plate started to vibrate, and all the stars began to move ten times faster than before.</p>

  <p>With his eyes wide open, Mike stared closely at the trajectory of the stars.</p>

  <p>Finally, the stars were moving at such a rapid speed that the star plate could not withhold them and shattered with a loud bang. By this time, Mike and Harold were both sweating profusely.</p>

  <p>"What did you see, master?" Harold asked.</p>

  <p>"Danger is imminent." Mike frowned.</p>

  <p>"Who will be in danger?" Harold asked, raising his eyebrow.</p>

  <p>Mike looked at Zheng with a strange expression and said, "It's not Zheng. It seems that the danger comes from outside the divine land. It's strange."</p>

  <p>As far as everyone was concerned, the most dangerous thing right now was undoubtedly Zheng's entering the Mountain of Holy Beings. Surprisingly, this was not the result that Mike had predicted.</p>

  <p>Instead, it seemed that something bad was about to happen outside the divine land.</p>

  <p>Lorena had already taken the others to seek the protection of the powerful warriors at the Other Shore Realm, so how could they be in any danger there?</p>

  <p>The result had completely blindsided Mike and his group.</p>

  <p>"I may have made a mistake since there are too many factors involved,"</p>

  <p>Mike offered helplessly by way of explanation.</p>

  <p>If he had used the Evolution Godly Way to predict the fate of the Evolutionary Universe, he would have gotten accurate results because almost all of the factors were under his control. In the divine land, however, many variables were out of his hand, so he wasn't able to arrive at an accurate prediction.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, he had wanted to give it a try since Zheng was about to enter the Mountain of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>He didn't fully believe what he had seen, but he still had a hint of worry on his face. "Don't worry, Father. Emily and Timotheus both have extraordinary strength. They can protect my mother," Zheng said comfortingly.</p>

  <p>Mike nodded. "Of course."</p>

  <p>Just then, Augustus' face lit up in surprise. "These Yellow Emperor Guards are quick. They have destroyed the Everest Spirit Mountain in less than three days and now, they're coming for us!"</p>

  <p>Upon hearing this news, everyone continued to look calm. After all, this was something that they had already predicted.</p>
