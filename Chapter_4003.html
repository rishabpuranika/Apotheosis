  <p>

</p>

  <p id="top_9">Since it would take some time for the six-headed eagles to catch up with the Black Teeth Swallows, the black-robed men decided to seize this opportunity and take their eggs away.</p>

  <p>The Black Teeth Swallows could fly really fast, which effectively bought some time for the black-robed men. In the end, however, escaping from the six-headed eagles would be futile.</p>

  <p>It wasn't a question of if but a question of when the six-headed eagles would catch their prey. The amount of time it would take, however, depended purely on luck.</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...</p>

  <p>Since they were determined to not let the opportunity slide, the black-robed men climbed up the mountain as fast as they could.</p>

  <p>The rest of the black-robed men below held their breath and stared at the top of the pagoda mountain. This was a life and death matter for their race so it was understandable that everyone was nervous.</p>

  <p>The leader's son craned his neck in the other direction, towards where the second Black Teeth Swallow had escaped. The female eagle chased after it.</p>

  <p>The two figures, one big and the other small, shuttled through the mountains!</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>Perhaps the Black Teeth Swallow was nervous, or maybe it was excited after it swallowed the Phoenix Blood. The leader's son couldn't be too sure but those were the only explanations he could come up with as he watched the bird crash onto a pagoda mountain and die.</p>

  <p>With its prey dead, the female eagle swooped down and caught the Black Teeth Swallow in its mouth before it promptly turned back towards the direction of its nest.</p>

  <p>The leader's son froze in shock when he saw this. "Father! The female eagle is coming back!"</p>

  <p>His father was well aware since he also heard the faint thump of the collision and witnessed the Black Teeth Swallow's death. Things weren't going so well since their subordinates were still on the process of climbing the mountain and reached only two-thirds of the height of the mountain.</p>

  <p>The situation just grew ten times more dangerous! "Shall we ask them to retreat?" the son asked.</p>

  <p>There was a grave look on the leader's face but he shook his head. "If they retreat now, then we will lose our one and only chance."</p>

  <p>The Black Teeth Swallows were rare treasures in the Supreme Pure Realm and it took them a lot of effort to catch two of them.</p>

  <p>If they let this chance go, then they wouldn't have enough time to capture another Black Teeth Swallow for their mission.</p>

  <p>The son frowned in worry as he stared at their subordinates who remained on the mountain. "If they don't retreat then they'll..."</p>

  <p>There weren't many members of their race, but the members were very tightly-knit and got along extremely well. How could the leader's son bear to see them die?</p>

  <p>However, his father had already decided. "For the sake of our tribe," he said firmly.</p>

  <p>Their race had a lot of old, weak members. If they gave up now, then they would face a calamity and die.</p>

  <p>A small sacrifice was needed for the greater good.</p>

  <p>It would be better for twenty people to risk their lives for the sake of their entire race.</p>

  <p>The son, however, remained adamant. "The female eagle will definitely return to its nest. It would be meaningless for them to sacrifice themselves!"</p>

  <p>"Shut up!" the leader scolded. He did not look at his son with a father's gaze but with the hard, cold glare of a superior.</p>

  <p>The other warriors could say nothing as they knew what they signed up for.</p>

  <p>They were all willing to follow their leader and sacrifice themselves if need be.</p>

  <p>That did not mean that they weren't scared. Death always made the strongest men tremble in their boots and these warriors were no different.</p>

  <p>When the leader scolded his son, the latter immediately turned and walked away.</p>

  <p>"Elroy!" his father shouted after him. However, his son turned a deaf ear to his cries.</p>

  <p>Without looking back, Elroy suddenly jumped along the pagoda mountain and whistled upwards. "Look here!" he cried out.</p>

  <p>He wanted to attract the female eagle's attention and buy time for the twenty black-robed men.</p>

  <p>The female eagle had no idea that its nest was about to be raided, so it flapped its wings unhurriedly and savored its food.</p>

  <p>Elroy's cry distracted the eagle and all its six heads looked down to find him beckoning from below.</p>

  <p>Down there was a brat actually stupid enough to provoke it.</p>

  <p>Instead of irritation, the eagle's first reaction was confusion.</p>

  <p>It wasn't that intelligent and got puzzled by Elroy's provocation.</p>

  <p>"Elroy!" the leader shouted.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the eagle had already taken notice of his son. Soon enough, it quickly flapped its wings and swooped down toward the young man.</p>

  <p>When Elroy saw that his plan worked, he immediately went all out and shouted at the eagle that now came rushing towards him!</p>

  <p>As it was about to swoop down towards the boy, the eagle suddenly felt that something was wrong. One of its six heads looked up to see the black-robed men slowly approach its nest!</p>

  <p>"Aoo!" it cried out.</p>

  <p>After it realized that it had been fooled, the female eagle immediately rose and flew back straight to its nest.</p>

  <p>"Damn it!" Elroy cursed. He was only able to buy a small amount of time for his men, and the pang of disappointment hit him when the eagle suddenly left.</p>

  <p>The twenty black-robed men pushed their speed to the limit. None of them had any idea what had transpired below and could only hear the cries of the six-headed eagle get ever closer. However, they did not pay any attention to it and simply rushed to finish their job.</p>

  <p>They were still two thousand feet away from the nest and they could reach it in twelve seconds at most.</p>

  <p>However, at that moment, the female eagle suddenly flew up to the top of the pagoda mountain.</p>

  <p>Five of its six heads opened their mouths and sprayed corrosive saliva all over the mountain face.</p>

  <p>This saliva formed a thin line on the mountain face and poured down like a green waterfall.</p>

  <p>The sight of this corrosive saliva freaked the warriors out as they did their best to avoid it.</p>

  <p>Their thick robes were made of special fabric and had good defensive power, but it was nothing when it went against the six-headed eagle's saliva.</p>

  <p>When the saliva made contact with their robes, their true appearances were revealed. These men looked very similar to humans but had paper-white skin from not having seen the light of day for so many years.</p>

  <p>Hiss! Hiss...</p>

  <p>As their robes corroded from the saliva, the light soon began to disintegrate their flesh. They were actually creatures from the Dark Region!</p>

  <p>Their bodies did not stand a chance under the combined force of the corrosive saliva and the bright light.</p>

  <p>"Aoo!"</p>

  <p>As the female eagle landed safely back in its nest, it let out a huge cry directed to the leader's son down below. This was the only warning Elroy received before the eagle suddenly spat a mouthful of green saliva towards him.</p>

  <p>Hiss, hiss, hiss...</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the corrosive saliva disappeared before it reached him.</p>

  <p>The six-headed eagle's saliva was terribly powerful and could even corrode the space.</p>

  <p>Since there was a long distance between the top of the pagoda mountain and the foot of it, the saliva corroded the space along the way until none of it remained.</p>

  <p>Of course, the female eagle already knew this but it only did that to give Elroy a warning.</p>

  <p>The black-robed men below couldn't help but feel dejected.</p>

  <p>Their plan had failed.</p>

  <p>After a moment of silence, the leader turned to his men. "Before we came here, I made it clear to all of you that we would risk our lives to complete our task. I know that it seems as if we have failed and all our efforts have been in vain, but I urge you all to find the strength to try again if you find even the slimmest of chances!"</p>

  <p>With their leader's encouragement, all the black-robed men that hid nearby revealed themselves and began moving towards the mountain top.</p>

  <p>To go up and try to raid the eagles' nest at that moment was to court death but they did not care. They were ready to risk their lives to complete their mission!</p>

  <p>As they approached the mountain top, a low sound suddenly came from the distance.</p>

  <p>It seemed someone currently ran at such a high speed that it caused the ground to tremble.</p>

  <p>When the black-robed men looked up, they saw Zheng!</p>

  <p>"A human being?"</p>

  <p>"A human being in the Light Region?"</p>

  <p>"What is he doing?"</p>

  <p>All of them could only mutter in disbelief as they saw Zheng rush towards them like a madman.</p>

  <p>Elroy decided to come forward and try to stop him in his tracks, maybe even ask him what caused him to run like this.</p>

  <p>However, it was like Zheng did not see them. The man simply rushed towards the pagoda mountain and ran his way up the mountain.</p>
