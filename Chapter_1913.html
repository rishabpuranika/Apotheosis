  <p>
</p>

  <p>After he finished speaking, the one-eyed man brandished the golden hammer and swung it mightily.</p>

  <p>With a sound of "doh", the golden hammer fell into the ground.</p>

  <p>Even though the ground was hit by a heavy hammer, the bottom of the cave was unscratched. Only a faint halo spread out from the point of impact.</p>

  <p>Ten feet...</p>

  <p>A thousand feet...</p>

  <p>Ten thousand feet...</p>

  <p>A hundred thousand feet...</p>

  <p>Ten million feet...</p>

  <p>From the deepest underground to the highest place in the air...</p>

  <p>In the interior world, the exterior world, and the whole Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, everything was shaking.</p>

  <p>"Jay! Come out!" the one-eyed man shouted.</p>

  <p>Not seeing any response, the man started to hit the ground with his hammer again.</p>

  <p>With another slam, the whole Divine Refinement Forbidden Land trembled more intensely.</p>

  <p>As he was talking with Tianming, Holy Jay revealed a small smile on his face...</p>

  <p>"The blacksmith doesn't have the patience for waiting," Holy Jay said, as he halted the conversation.</p>

  <p>Tianming smiled inwardly as he felt the quaking of the ground. He wondered what kind of power the blacksmith possessed that made the whole Divine Refinement Forbidden Land tremble.</p>

  <p>Divine Refinement Forbidden Land might not be as big as a universe, but an ordinary man didn't have the capability for such a movement.</p>

  <p>Tianming nodded and said, "I will wait here for you, Holy Jay."</p>

  <p>"No. Please join me." Holy Jay stretched out his hand and grasped Tianming's.</p>

  <p>Without any preamble, Tianming felt the world spin around and the view changed.</p>

  <p>They were transported into a cave.</p>

  <p>"Knock and you will know!" Holy Jay said in an unhappy tone.</p>

  <p>The one-eyed man in the cave just chuckled. Holding the golden hammer, he rubbed his nose and smiled as he said, "My hammer is too thirsty. That boy has come!"</p>

  <p>"Do I need your reminder?" Holy Jay couldn't help but roll his eyes. He could clearly feel any movement in his inner world. He could even perceive a group of ants moving towards home, or a dead leaf falling down.</p>

  <p>"Well, may I take an action now? May I kill all the trouble-makers around him?" the one-eyed man asked.</p>

  <p>In his eye, all the people around Luo Luo Zheng were worthless and could be rooted out by him easily. Luo Luo Zheng was the only exception and was the most precious thing for him.</p>

  <p>"The two daughters from Han Clan are among them. Do you want to kill them too?" Holy Jay smiled coldly.</p>

  <p>The one-eyed man snorted disdainfully and said, "If they are just from a branch of the Han Clan, I wouldn't worry about it."</p>

  <p>To some extent, the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land took care of the warriors from the divine land. Holy Jay never allowed the offspring of important clans to be hurt, in case they ran into any trouble.</p>

  <p>"Well, you can try. I'll just pretend not to see anything." Holy Jay shrugged.</p>

  <p>The one-eyed man sensed the subliminal message in Holy Jay's words.</p>

  <p>There seemed to be some important members of the Han Clan among them. He hefted the golden hammer onto his shoulder and walked out of the cave. "I see. No one will die."</p>

  <p>In a single step, the one-eyed man already traversed the distance to the entrance of the cave. After careful observation, Tianming didn't feel any Space Law. This one-eyed man wasn't Holy Jay, but Tianming couldn't understand how he was able to do that.</p>

  <p>"Is he the blacksmith who you were talking about?" Tianming asked.</p>

  <p>Holy Jay nodded and said, "It cost me a lot to get this guy here!"</p>

  <p>It wasn't easy for even a Holy Being to ask this one-eyed man for help; he was very choosy. With his capability, few things could pique his interest in divine land. If one wanted to ask for his help, the determining factor was his interest ahead of others'. Furthermore, he was eccentric, which made it even harder to ask him to be here.</p>

  <p>It was lucky that Holy Jay caught his interest successfully...</p>

  <p>Both the divine land and the universes were abundant with bizarre weapons, magic treasures, and even evil weapons. There were quite a lot of unimaginably unusual refining methods. It wasn't unthinkable if a weapon became animate and revenged its master. Some weapons even transformed into human beings and married their masters.</p>

  <p>But refining a human body into a weapon was never heard of in the whole world. Holy Jay was sure that this was the reason why the one-eyed man was interested to help.</p>

  <p>With his gold hammer on his shoulder, the blacksmith went upwards along the cave. Naturally, his target was Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>By now, the Ice Butterfly Picture in Kaydan's hand was almost used up.</p>

  <p>"Hurry up, let's rush over!"</p>

  <p>It condensed fewer and fewer ice butterflies, which made everyone feel that the surrounding environment was getting hotter and hotter.</p>

  <p>The lava flowing on either side of the road transformed into countless creatures pouncing on them.</p>

  <p>"Freezing spell!"</p>

  <p>"Snow sealing..."</p>

  <p>"Mysterious ice all over the sky!"</p>

  <p>Noticing that Kaydan was under pressure, world lords from Han Clan began to help.</p>

  <p>After the cave shook, some warriors on the narrow road almost fell into the lava.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the warriors' reflexes were extremely fast. They instantly flew into the sky and escaped tragedy.</p>

  <p>"An earthquake?" Everyone's faces had a look of surprise.</p>

  <p>The earthquake came without any warning.</p>

  <p>In the cave, no one had an idea that this earthquake affected the whole Divine Refinement Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>After three continuous tremors, the cave became stable.</p>

  <p>Soon afterwards, they saw a man at the bottom of the cave.</p>

  <p>Shouldering a golden hammer, the one-eyed man shuffled towards them.</p>

  <p>His gait was weird and his face was blank. Although the road dipped downward, the one-eyed man didn't follow the road and walked straight across the hot lava directly.</p>

  <p>The green flame of the lava didn't hurt him at all.</p>

  <p>"You... Who are you?"</p>

  <p>Kaydan and Chapman went to the front of the group.</p>

  <p>They had already covered half of the journey. They could take over the door only if they sent Luo Luo Zheng into that cave. The one-eyed man in front of them seemed to be an unwelcome guest.</p>

  <p>The one-eyed man hid his Mu Ning, so that no one could estimate his capability.</p>

  <p>Facing this undecipherable man, everyone felt nervous.</p>

  <p>This one-eyed man wasn't interested in answering Kaydan. He kept walking towards the group. Actually, his eyes only fixed on Luo Luo Zheng...</p>

  <p>If he had gotten Holy Jay's consent, he would have killed all of those people in front of him.</p>

  <p>As he saw it, these creatures were no different than life vitality. They didn't hold any value for him. He just didn't harm them because of his promise to Holy Jay.</p>

  <p>"Stop!" Chapman's face darkened. He blocked the one-eyed man's way.</p>

  <p>His massive body was like a door in front of that man, and his muscles were hardened.</p>

  <p>The Collapsing Mountain race were proud of their strength. Chapman was the top one among them, but he wasn't very confident as he confronted this one-eyed man.</p>

  <p>So Chapman just blocked his way, instead of doing anything rash.</p>

  <p>This activity was far too important for Chapman and the others. He couldn't allow anyone to interfere with their plan.</p>

  <p>Ignoring Chapman's warning, the one-eyed man still continued his way to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Neither of them changed their course, so a bump was inevitable.</p>

  <p>The one-eyed man didn't slow down even slightly. He bumped Chapman as if he was just a curtain. His pace wasn't hindered by Chapman at all; he just continued walking.</p>

  <p>Chapman paled. With a sound of stuffy buzz, his huge body crashed on the ground and nearly fell into the lava. Lying on the ground, he was unable to get back up! It sparked some conflicted emotions in his heart.</p>

  <p>Before the collision, Chapman accumulated ninety percent of his power secretly. However, Chapman himself felt like a piece of thin paper and didn't even offer the slightest resistance to the one-eyed man!</p>

  <p>This just showed that these two were not in the same level. Chapman was just like a small ant standing in front of an elephant; he was unqualified to hinder the one-eyed man's way.</p>

  <p>Kaydan's and Tilton's faces fell. Kaydan had intended to take action, but he didn't. Seeing that Chapman fell down, Kaydan realized that this one-eyed man's power was beyond his imagination.</p>

  <p>Even with all of their combined power, they wouldn't come close to the strength of this man's finger.</p>

  <p>Kaydan suppressed his impulse to take an action and said in a low voice,</p>

  <p>"Respected master, could you let us know what you want to do?"</p>

  <p>The one-eyed man didn't reply to Kaydan's question. He just approached Luo Luo Zheng and said, "I have been waiting you for a long time. Please follow me." He stretched out his hand and grasped Luo Zheng's as he completed his words.</p>
