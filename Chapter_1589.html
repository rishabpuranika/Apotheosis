  <p>
</p>

  <p>After she let go of the bowstring, a buzz was heard.</p>

  <p>Everyone saw the bowstring tremble on the bow.</p>

  <p>The vortex of flame floating in front of the longbow didn't shoot out but instead floated in front of her, slowly spinning.</p>

  <p>The Demon Night woman then smiled shyly at the crowd. "We'd better back off a bit!"</p>

  <p>Upon seeing the power of the flame vortex, everyone knew that the power of the explosion would exceed their imagination and that they had to retreat.</p>

  <p>Putting away her Moon Bursting Flame Bow, the Demon Night woman retreated toward the hall with the others. The vortex of flame was then left where it was, slowly rotating in the air.</p>

  <p>Zheng, Janet and the others moved back hundreds of feet before they decided to stop.</p>

  <p>"It's not yet enough. We have to retreat further back. I'm afraid it'll hurt you," the Demon Night woman said with a smile.</p>

  <p>Thus, the group retreated together with her to the middle section of the Hall of Causality.</p>

  <p>"Alright, it's enough." As soon as the woman finished speaking, her eyes flashed. In that moment, everyone heard the sound of an explosion.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The flame vortex shot toward the huge, square rock. After a fierce collision, the flame power contained within spread out to the back.</p>

  <p>Almost half of the Hall of Causality was easily swallowed by the intense flame.</p>

  <p>The woman seemed rather familiar with the bow. She told everyone to back off, but not too far away. They were at a good distance now.</p>

  <p>"In addition to the power of the five layers of the Fire Law, it also contains a strange Law of Causality. It can condense the flame power to a high degree. Is this what makes the Moon Bursting Flame Bow special?" Janet whispered.</p>

  <p>Right in the middle of the raging flames, the surface of the huge rock was once again suffused with countless Illusion Points. As they continuously danced in the air, they flew directly toward the Demon Night woman's body.</p>

  <p>The number of these Illusion Points was several times more than that of the ogre martial artists from before.</p>

  <p>When the raging flames completely dissipated and the Illusion Points were completely absorbed, the ogre martial artist anxiously asked, "How many… How many Illusion Points have you obtained?"</p>

  <p>"2.8 million," she said with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>"What?" The ogre martial artist roared. In this moment, he turned green with envy. But there was no medicine for regret in this world— he shouldn't have struck the square rock.</p>

  <p>As the other martial artists heard the woman's words, their hearts burned with passion.</p>

  <p>And it was as expected.</p>

  <p>Just as Janet said, it was rather easy to earn the Illusion Points in the Hall of Causality.</p>

  <p>They had only passed the second hall and yet the Demon Night woman already managed to acquire such a large number of points. What would happen in the next halls, then?</p>

  <p>"So that's how it is."</p>

  <p>'It'll be difficult to maintain my ranking just by robbing other martial artists of their Illusion Points. If I want to obtain a good ranking, I guess I have to enter the other Halls of Causality, ' Zheng thought to himself.</p>

  <p>After the flames dissipated, the other martial artists rushed toward the square rock.</p>

  <p>Then, a human martial artist launched an attack on it.</p>

  <p>Since he knew the rules, he didn't bother holding himself back at all.</p>

  <p>Instead, he used all his strength to unleash his strongest martial skills toward the rock.</p>

  <p>While he was indeed powerful, he didn't have a supreme divine weapon.</p>

  <p>The number of Illusion Points he could obtain from the rock wasn't as big as that of the Demon Night woman, but he still had at least a million.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the ogre martial artist wailed again.</p>

  <p>Everyone present took turns attacking the square rock. There, everyone could obtain over a million Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>Every time a warrior absorbed the points, they would hear a wail.</p>

  <p>The first few martial artists received their rewards.</p>

  <p>At this point, Janet appeared in front of the rock, wearing a confident smile.</p>

  <p>But she didn't bring out any magical weapons. Instead, she merely held her two small hands together and gently rotated them in the opposite direction, emitting a special aura from her palms.</p>

  <p>Soon after, she gently patted the square rock.</p>

  <p>Crack! A crisp sound resounded as if she just smacked the rock.</p>

  <p>The ogre martial artist's eyes were wide open as he looked at Janet and said, "Don't you want the Illusion Points?"</p>

  <p>The ogre martial artist didn't feel any particularly intense strength, so he couldn't understand why Janet was acting this way. But as he thought that Janet wouldn't obtain as many points as he did, he found a sense of comfort.</p>

  <p>Without a word, Janet smiled.</p>

  <p>Zheng, the short martial artist, and the Demon Night woman all looked surprised at Janet's display. To them, it was obvious that her palm strike was nothing ordinary.</p>

  <p>Soon after, the square rock began emitting yellow Illusion Points, one after another.</p>

  <p>With this scene, the ogre martial artist laughed out loud. "Maybe you can only obtain a hundred Illusion Points."</p>

  <p>But just then, he stopped laughing.</p>

  <p>More and more points were flying out.</p>

  <p>"3.1 million Illusion Points. Not bad." Janet smiled faintly at Zheng before backing away to the side, leaving the ogre martial artist standing there in a daze.</p>

  <p>Of the eight people, six of them had absorbed varying numbers of Illusion Points, leaving only Zheng and the short martial artist.</p>

  <p>After the two looked at each other, the short martial artist was the first to step forward. "This time, let me do it."</p>

  <p>This warrior had the Buddha Curse Blade, so everyone expected him to obtain a massive amount of points.</p>

  <p>But much to everyone's surprise, he didn't plan to use his supreme divine weapon.</p>

  <p>Instead, he stood in front of the square rock with his hands clasped together. After closing his eyes, he didn't move at all.</p>

  <p>"What's this guy doing?" The ogre martial artist whispered.</p>

  <p>But no one else said another word.</p>

  <p>The giant rock before them rewarded the number of Illusion Points based on the power of each attack, so the warriors naturally scrambled to display their most powerful moves.</p>

  <p>These geniuses cooperated with each other temporarily in the Hall of Causality, but once they left, given their strength, they would meet each other sooner or later. It was beneficial for all parties to get an idea of each other's trump cards in advance, after all.</p>

  <p>When the short martial artist closed his eyes, he looked like a meditative old monk— even his aura turned tranquil and serene.</p>

  <p>At this moment, he seemed to have forgotten all about time and space— he moved like he was the only person in the hall.</p>

  <p>After a few minutes of silence, everyone heard a sigh.</p>

  <p>It was almost unbearably desolate as if it came from someone who had seen right into the emptiness of the material world.</p>

  <p>"Alas..."</p>

  <p>After heaving the sigh, the short martial artist gently reached out his hand and pushed it toward the square rock.</p>

  <p>As he did, the push seemed relaxed and gentle.</p>

  <p>When Janet struck the surface of the rock, it made a loud sound, but his strike was silent. The moment his palm touched the rock, he pulled back like a dragonfly dipping quickly into the water.</p>

  <p>But after his light push, a massive amount of Illusion Points flooded into him.</p>

  <p>'That's a strange power. The methods of the Blessed Buddha Land are truly extensive and profound.' Sighing inwardly, Zheng shot the martial artist with a grave expression.</p>

  <p>The three human forces in the universe were all very powerful— the Thoughtless Minds was established by many clans, while the Humanity Alliance was made of countless sacred places. But the Blessed Buddha Land was the oldest in the whole human race. Their path of cultivation was completely differently from that of the Thoughtless Minds and Humanity Alliance because they inherited the very teachings of the Buddhas.</p>

  <p>"3.9 million Illusion Points," he announced casually.</p>

  <p>The crowd couldn't help but suck in a breath of cold air upon hearing the number.</p>

  <p>It wasn't the number they were shocked at— over four million Illusion Points were stored in their bodies, after all.</p>

  <p>But the short martial artist managed to obtain nearly four million Illusion Points in one go— did that mean his palm strike was several times stronger than theirs?</p>

  <p>The Demon Night woman had used a supreme divine weapon and yet earned only 2.8 million Illusion Points. But this person, out of nowhere, earned 3.9 million using just his bare hands.</p>

  <p>Janet's mouth twitched. The record she created was instantly broken by the guy. Unwilling to give up, she turned to Zheng. "It's your turn."</p>

  <p>In her frustration, she found herself hoping that Tianxing could get more Illusion Points than the short martial artist.</p>
