  <p>
</p>

  <p>The pattern on the bronze wall was incredibly large. Luo Zheng was only able to see it in its entirety after descending a fair distance.</p>

  <p>"Bird, monkey, snake and human being?"</p>

  <p>The four patterns had been lengthened deliberately and weren't totally accurate, but one could vaguely tell the types of creatures from the outlines.</p>

  <p>The bird's feet arched back, the monkey's tail was like a long stick and the snake was covered in spikes. Only the human being appeared relatively normal, but no one even knew if it was actually a human being.</p>

  <p>Among the four patterns was the pattern of a door.</p>

  <p>The door caught Luo Zheng's attention and it filled his heart with joy. His body floated towards it, and although it was a painting, since it appeared here, there would be a way for him to pass through it.</p>

  <p>But as he approached, the door's lines began emitting an ominous red light and at the same time a powerful repulsive force hit and pushed him down a distance.</p>

  <p>The force was not all that strong to Luo Zheng. He was frustrated and refused to give in, so he accelerated and rushed up, hoping to force his way through the door.</p>

  <p>But unexpectedly, as he sped up, the repulsive force increased by a thousand times and hit back!</p>

  <p>"Hoo!"</p>

  <p>The incredible force knocked him from the air and sent him smashing down hard into the ground.</p>

  <p>"Damn it!"</p>

  <p>On his way down, he was falling towards the cubes!</p>

  <p>The purpose of entering these cubes was to attempt to fuse with the bloodline known as the Infinite Time and Space. Luo Zheng was more interested in the ancestry-level bloodline the spider man had mentioned. On the other hand, he wasn't absolutely confident in merging with that bloodline.</p>

  <p>If he failed and was trapped in the cube, he'd be in serious trouble...</p>

  <p>As he fell towards a cube, in a moment of desperation, he released a burst of strength and twisted his body violently, his upper and lower body shifting to an unnatural angle.</p>

  <p>He dodged, brushing one of the cubes as he passed by before finally smashing into the ground.</p>

  <p>"Humph. Why am I so unlucky!"</p>

  <p>The spider man crawled in the cube and looked at Luo Zheng with resentment and jealousy.</p>

  <p>There was a connection between the cubes, so the spider man wished Luo Zheng would fall into one of them and accompany him. But in the end, it was not Luo Zheng's fate to fall into any of them.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had already discovered the textures on the ceiling and as he was a human being, he'd be able to pass through it sooner or later.</p>

  <p>This thought encouraged the spider man not to give up. He put on a kind face and asked, "May I discuss something with you? If you successfully obtain..."</p>

  <p>After the sounds of singing rang out, Luo Zheng glanced at the spider man with confusion and then flew up to the ceiling.</p>

  <p>"Damn it!" the spider man cursed, gritting his teeth again.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had no time for his nonsense, and he was focused on trying to find a way through the door.</p>

  <p>"Four patterns correspond to four orders, right?" The Primeval Lord of Heaven was unsure himself and warned, "Luo Zheng, when you approach these textures, be careful..."</p>

  <p>Great peril would befall him if he accidentally triggered some mechanism or form of punishment.</p>

  <p>He leaned towards the monkey on the left. When he was ten feet from the pattern, the textures shone with a deep red light.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>"Roar!"</p>

  <p>A fierce roar came from the pattern as the light flashed, as if a truly powerful monkey was actually there roaring.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng made the sensible decision to stop in his path and retreat.</p>

  <p>He then approached the bird's pattern and much like the monkey, it flashed red light and a loud squawk echoed out.</p>

  <p>The squawk had a strong sense of threat within it. Luo Zheng was obviously not allowed to go near it.</p>

  <p>His two attempts had been shut down, so he decided against approaching the snake.</p>

  <p>"I don't think this is the mechanism to open the door, but some sort of qualification test. If so, there's only one option," Luo Zheng said, breathing deeply and looking at the pattern of the human being. If he didn't qualify, he would not be able to pass through.</p>

  <p>"It's a human shaped pattern so any human qualifies here, right?" "Could it be that the human race also holds a high status in the Abstruse Energy Civilization?" wondered the Primeval Lord of Heaven, smiling.</p>

  <p>Under the leadership of the human ancestor, the human race had once risen to prominence, and in that time felt that they were the most special of the races.</p>

  <p>Later, their Finale Way failed and they were defeated during the war with the Element Spirit Civilization in the Three Purities Stage. The Primeval Lord of Heaven and the human elites later reflected on what had happened and realized that perhaps they were not all that special.</p>

  <p>But now, the human pattern in the Eternal Divine Courtyard reminded the Primeval Lord of Heaven of the past, and he began thinking that humans might not be as simple as they had imagined.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng approached the human being pattern. It flashed with a green light which quickly spread in the direction of the door, turning the entire door green as well.</p>

  <p>"It works!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's face lit up as he moved towards the door once more.</p>

  <p>This time, no repulsive force fought back and he touched the door without resistance.</p>

  <p>He tried to push it, but when he did, he discovered that the door was completely illusory and his hands went straight into the bronze wall...</p>

  <p>The spider man watched hopelessly, burning with jealousy, as Luo Zheng drilled into the wall. Seeing Luo Zheng so easily enter the place he had been yearning for depressed him deeply.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng moved through the short passage in the bronze wall and came out the other side.</p>

  <p>As he emerged, before him stood a wide bronze square with a huge dome above it, supported by four thick pillars with four statues mounted on them.</p>

  <p>The statues were of the bird, monkey, snake and human being that he had seen before.</p>

  <p>"It seems these four creatures are grouped together," Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>It seemed likely that these four races were born together, forming an extremely powerful civilization.</p>

  <p>"But what do these four races have to do with the Instant Civilization and the chaos?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked, frowning.</p>

  <p>"We'll know by the end of all this," Luo Zheng replied, walking towards the center of the square. There appeared to be a cup as tall as a person, with something in it and patterns carved on it.</p>

  <p>As he stepped into the center of the square, the eyes of the four statues ignited in a red light at the same time.</p>

  <p>They all came to life, their bronze carved bodies peeling off from the pillars and smashing into the bronze square with a thunderous bang. The bronze snake with spikes all across its body was the first to speak, "How has a human being made it here?"</p>

  <p>"Anyone who enters the Eternal Divine Courtyard will be killed!"</p>

  <p>The bronze monkey was bad-tempered and rushed towards Luo Zheng aggressively.</p>
