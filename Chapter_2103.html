  <p>Mu Ning lay down on a rocking chair in a side hall. She was dressed in a bright red wedding gown with matching embroidered shoes and heavy make-up.</p>

  <p>There was a smirk on her face. Her gown had been made of blood silk, the kind that, when peeled off cocoons and thrown into the air, would not fall to the ground even after several years. It was extremely light and was considered a top-level material for making chain-type weapons. Any treasure made from this material would definitely be listed on the Universe Spirit Tablet.</p>

  <p>Such a coveted material was made into a gown Mu Ning was only going to wear once.</p>

  <p>Each woman's pursuit of marriage was different. Xun never cared for a title and couldn't understand Xi Youqin's desire for such a grand wedding ceremony. Mu Ning, meanwhile, was content in quietly staying by Luo Zheng's side to pray for his safety. So long as Luo Luo Zheng reached his goals then she would be happy, and even if he failed, she would not regret.</p>

  <p>It was mostly Ning Yudie and Mu Ning who often argued with regards to the title of being Luo Zheng's wife back in the Lower World. The matter had already been decided long ago and there was no more conflict between them, however, Ning Yudie couldn't help but still feel a bit jealous. Her sadness might not be that obvious to outsiders but Luo Nian knew his own mother well enough to notice her strange temper. However, he didn't know why her mother was unhappy.</p>

  <p>Not long after, several rays of light shot towards the sky and blossomed into numerous fireworks that illuminated the entire Breaking Cloud World.</p>

  <p>It seemed that the wedding ceremony was going according to plan.</p>

  <p>Just as it was beginning, an extremely sharp Mu Ning suddenly surged out from the depths of the Breaking Cloud World.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>A white beam of sword radiance suddenly pierced through the sky, hitting a star that was at least three hundred million miles away.</p>

  <p>The sword radiance did not weaken at all despite hitting the star and continued to rise instead until it reached the dome of the Evolutionary Universe. It was only after it cut into the Sighing Wall for about one thousand feet did it finally dissipate.</p>

  <p>This dome had once been broken by Murphy. However, after being damaged, the Sighing Wall had the ability to gradually heal itself. It was very much like animal skin and a thick scar would be left behind where it was hit.</p>

  <p>The guests, who were originally in a state of jubilation were quickly plunged into silence with the appearance of this sword intent.</p>

  <p>There was no doubt that this sword strike was far beyond the capabilities of a Supreme Lord!</p>

  <p>Those who were a bit confused at what was going on immediately felt panicked. Could it be that another strong enemy had come to invade the universe once again?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stood in the center of the stage. "What a strong sword intent!"</p>

  <p>"It's coming from Tianming's cultivation place!" Supreme Lord Sky from the Celestial Position shouted.</p>

  <p>The panic then quickly melted off everyone's faces and was replaced with anticipation.</p>

  <p>The moment the Godly Geniuses returned from the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, they all entered closed-door seclusion - except for Nathan who was sent to fight against Maha.</p>

  <p>These Godly Geniuses' Lotus Flowers were all in full bloom and were no longer limited by the heavens. Since all of them were world lords, they were technically only one step away from becoming True Gods.</p>

  <p>However, this step was extremely difficult.</p>

  <p>There were too many world lords in the divine land that had comprehended the Divine Dao since they were all ordinary creatures unrestricted by the heavens. The number of Godly Geniuses wasn't small but it was extremely rare for them to be able to condense their own Godly Tiles and become True Gods. Those who were able to become True Gods mostly relied on the Godly Tiles that past True Gods had left behind.</p>

  <p>It was understandable for these Godly Geniuses to seize the opportunity to cultivate in seclusion in order to attain a breakthrough. Condensing a Godly Tile was going to be extremely useful in fighting against the Sacred race. However, both Wynn and Master Feng knew that what these youngsters wanted to achieve was impossible to accomplish in just a short period of time.</p>

  <p>Nobody would have ever imagined that only a year later, one of the Godly Geniuses would succeed in condensing his own Godly Tile!</p>

  <p>From the sword radiance emerged a figure that shot out of the depths of the Breaking Cloud World. The figure circled the air once before rushing towards the Breaking Cloud Mountain.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled and followed in pursuit.</p>

  <p>It wasn't just him. All Supreme Lords present also flew into the air and followed.</p>

  <p>The other world lords and grand world lords wanted to go too but they were all in the middle of Luo Zheng's wedding ceremony and it would seem rude if they just left so suddenly.</p>

  <p>In just a few moments, the figure had already reached the summit of the Breaking Cloud Mountain and was already headed straight for Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"It really is Tianming!"</p>

  <p>"Such a powerful momentum! He's truly condensed a Godly Tile!"</p>

  <p>"His lifespan is now limitless and he can travel freely in the divine land!"</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords all murmured in envy.</p>

  <p>This kid who used to just practice the sword had now become an existence they had to look up to.</p>

  <p>All these Supreme Lords held high positions and understood the importance of longevity. An endless lifespan meant unlimited possibilities. They were blessed with long lives but they knew that they would all one day enter the Five Aging Processes and once again enter the cycle of reincarnation.</p>

  <p>"Tianming! Congratulations!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng declared happily. Tianming's Mu Ning had noticeably gone a tremendous change. There was a momentum emanating from his body that mostly originated from the countless living beings within his inner world.</p>

  <p>In truth, his momentum was already present the moment the living beings came into existence within his inner world.</p>

  <p>However, he had been unable to sense this supposed momentum back when he still did not have a Godly Tile.</p>

  <p>"Thanks," Tianming replied, also pleasantly surprised. He never expected the process of condensing his Godly Tile to be so easy.</p>

  <p>Looking around, Tianming quickly noticed the small crowd that gathered at the foot of the Breaking Cloud Mountain. "I just found out about your wedding day so I was eager to break through and attend it. However, I was in such a rush that I didn't have the time to prepare a gift for you. I'm so sorry."</p>

  <p>Although he was in closed-door training, the numerous announcements from the Roaring Tokens reached him. Today, hundreds of congratulatory words had echoed all throughout the universe for Luo Luo Zheng and his marriage.</p>

  <p>"Never mind that Tianming! The fact that you are able to break through and become a True God is the best gift of all!" Luo Luo Zheng laughed.</p>

  <p>The other Supreme Lords were also quick to give Tianming their congratulations.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Mu Ning, who was still covered in her red bridal veil, pouted in displeasure. She didn't care whether or not Tianming broke through. All that mattered to her now was that he had obviously upstaged her grand wedding day!</p>

  <p>As she sulked, someone from the crowd shouted, "Good! Two happy events in one day! How wonderful!" Somehow, that made Mu Ning feel a bit better.</p>

  <p>Tianming soon took his seat and the wedding ceremony continued.</p>

  <p>Half a month after the wedding ceremony ended, Thirteen Supreme Lords of the Evolutionary Universe, together with Tianming who had just recently become a True God, Luo Luo Zheng, the Ancestral Dragon, and the nine Genuine Dragons all entered the Genuine Dragon World.</p>

  <p>The Genuine Dragon World was not a world within the Evolutionary Universe. Rather, it was an independent Supreme World quite similar to the Purple Power World, only many times larger. The sounds from the Roaring Tokens also could not reach here.</p>

  <p>Basically, the Genuine Dragon World was Mike's gigantic spirit beast bag.</p>

  <p>When the nine Genuine Dragons' physical bodies were destroyed, they escaped by attaching their souls to the furnace. Murphy had already planned this early on, just like how he planned for the sorcerer race's invasion.</p>

  <p>However, Mike was able to turn the tables against him and used the nine dragons to lead Luo Luo Zheng to the path of martial arts.</p>

  <p>Now that the Sacred race had been defeated, it was now time to clear the Genuine Dragon World.</p>
