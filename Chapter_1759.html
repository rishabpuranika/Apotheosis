  <p>
</p>

  <p>The great worlds, then the entire universe, until finally, the divine land.</p>

  <p>This was the order.</p>

  <p>Very few True Gods would descend to the areas below the divine land since this was normally not allowed.</p>

  <p>Legends had been told of True Gods who returned. However, these remained as legends. Nobody had yet seen a True God in the universe.</p>

  <p>The traces of the True Gods Luo Luo Zheng witnessed in the Hall of Causality were left behind before they advanced. Luo Luo Zheng didn't know why they had never returned. He did not have a thorough understanding of the world, and what he knew he had obtained it from what the Supreme Lords debated about.</p>

  <p>"Because those True Gods didn't come back from the divine land,"</p>

  <p>Master Feng continued. "They came from another world, another universe."</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Mathias' eyes widened.</p>

  <p>"What?!"</p>

  <p>It was possible that some of the other Supreme Lords already knew about this, but the rest had similar reactions as Supreme Lord Mathias.</p>

  <p>They did not have a clear understanding of this world's nature. Thus, they did not have the capability to predict who their future enemies would be.</p>

  <p>Master Feng tapped his hand and a small dot appeared in the middle of the cave.</p>

  <p>The dot then began to expand until it turned into a ball that was around ten feet wide.</p>

  <p>"I do not know what the divine land truly looks like," Master Feng said.</p>

  <p>"Some of the information was passed down from my blood, but it is incomplete. I can only tell you what I know. Suppose this round ball in front of us is the shape of the divine land..."</p>

  <p>"The divine land is spherical?" someone asked.</p>

  <p>Master Feng, however, shook his head. "It is most likely irregular in shape."</p>

  <p>Everyone now listened attentively. None of the Supreme Lords present could ever hope to become True Gods but they still greatly desired the divine land.</p>

  <p>"There are many True Gods in the divine land, but there are even stronger existences?" Master Feng continued. "Just like us, they have a perfect inner world that can function as a real world. Moreover, they also possess a Godly Tile!"</p>

  <p>As he spoke, his eyes inevitably landed on Luo Luo Zheng and the other warriors.</p>

  <p>Other than Xenia, who missed her chance to get her Godly Plate, all the other nine had their own Godly Tiles. It was only through the use of a Godly Plate could a warrior transform into a True God.</p>

  <p>"The Godly Tile is the biggest difference between us and the True Gods.</p>

  <p>With that, they have the ability to establish a complete system of faith in their inner world. A True God is not a god for us who live in the universe but for the billions of people in their bodies! A True God's strength comes from the Faith Energy of the countless living beings in their inner world!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes lit up when he heard this.</p>

  <p>He was already familiar with Faith Energy, as were the Supreme Lords with him. Some races had even developed their own Faith Energy and used it proficiently. The Demon Night's Pools of Faith, for example, gave the three queens enough power to kill a Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>However, it was not easy gathering faith in this universe. The Demon Night was the only one who managed to gather such a huge amount from their people's piety. The Faith Energy gathered by the Thoughtless Minds over the years was barely enough to forge a divine weapon.</p>

  <p>An inner world was different, though. A warrior was the absolute ruler of their inner world, the absolute god!</p>

  <p>True Gods had the ability to condense the Godly Tile within their inner worlds. They could spread it out and create more creatures, advance lives, and gather even more faith.</p>

  <p>"There are stronger existences beyond the numerous True Gods. In theory, the inner worlds of these people are not within their bodies,"</p>

  <p>Master Feng went on. He had deciphered all this information from his Sky Origin Blood and thus, understood his mission.</p>

  <p>There were only two sets of Sky Origin Blood. One belonged to him, while the other belonged to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Different information existed in the Celestial Position's golden bloodline.</p>

  <p>The higher the grade of blood, the more important the hidden information.</p>

  <p>"The inner world isn't in the body? Where is it then?" a Supreme Lord asked.</p>

  <p>Master Feng pointed his finger at the giant ball whereon two small light spots appeared. These light spots quickly expanded and turned into little people. In just a few seconds, eighty little people stood on the big ball.</p>

  <p>"These people represent the supreme existences within the divine land.</p>

  <p>They are far more powerful than the True Gods, though I'm not really sure how many of them there are," Master Feng explained.</p>

  <p>"Buzz, buzz, buzz?"</p>

  <p>At that moment, several small red balls appeared around the sphere.</p>

  <p>These balls surrounded the big one in the middle.</p>

  <p>"The big sphere represents the divine land while the small ones represent the universes," Master Feng continued to explain.</p>

  <p>The eyes of one of the Supreme Lords flickered as he finally understood what was going on. The amount of people on the giant sphere was the same as that of the small balls. "Do you mean that our universe is the inner world of some more advanced existence?"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"I got it too! This is a real world but it is also the inner world of some powerful being!"</p>

  <p>"We are actually members of the inner world of a powerful figure?"</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords were all in shock at this sudden epiphany. The worlds within their bodies were perfect. There were thunderstorms, sunlight, snow, grass, and even strong warriors who were a half-step away from a world lord. There were countless martial artists who worked hard within them, but in the end, they were forever constrained by the power of their inner world.</p>

  <p>It was only then that the Supreme Lords realized that their universe was probably the inner world of some powerhouse!</p>

  <p>"The powerhouses who have universes in their inner worlds are existences far stronger than True Gods. Their influence spreads out through the entire divine land and they possess immortality because their life forms are firmly connected to the universes. They are the Holy Beings!" Master Feng declared.</p>

  <p>"Holy Beings!"</p>

  <p>"Are we the creatures within the inner world of a Holy Being?"</p>

  <p>"Oh my goodness!"</p>

  <p>These Supreme Lords were all too familiar with inner worlds, but they still found it hard to believe Master Feng's words. It turned out that they were all mere wisps of life vitality in someone else's inner world.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, a few Supreme Lords remained unflinching, though there was a trace of unwillingness in their faces.</p>

  <p>They were indeed the top existences in this universe, but they were inevitably trapped within a circle. According to principle, even if there was a channel that led out of the universe and this giant inner world they were living in, they would only dissipate into life vitality bit by bit and cease to exist. This fact was extremely hard to accept but also a bitter truth that must be swallowed.</p>

  <p>It was exactly the same as the powerhouses they also had in their own inner worlds. No matter what cultivation level, a powerhouse was doomed to remain within them since any escape meant the dissipation into life vitality. Those who went against the rules were destined to die.</p>

  <p>Here, only Godly Geniuses had the qualifications to cross the heavens and become True Gods. The moment they comprehended the Divine Dao, they would possess these abilities.</p>

  <p>Therefore, being a Godly Genius wasn't really a power but a type of qualification.</p>

  <p>And those who had such qualifications now stood in front of these Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>"This is very contradictory," one of the Supreme Lords said. "Since we belong to a Holy Being's inner world, how can he or she allow the people of other heavens to come?"</p>

  <p>Master Feng nodded his head in understanding. "You're absolutely right.</p>

  <p>This normally wasn't supposed to happen. I also didn't understand, but Tianming, fortunately, found the answer."</p>

  <p>Everyone's gaze then drifted towards Tianming.</p>

  <p>There was a hint of overwhelming pressure on Tianming as all the Supreme Lords looked at him. He nodded his head and began to speak. "What if that Holy Being is dying?"</p>
