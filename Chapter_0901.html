<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Over the years, countless war lords had succumbed to their temptations in the Dark Nether Cave and died.</p>

  <p>But even so, the pull of opportunities from the Dark Nether Cave was just too great. If one was lucky enough to get a good chance in the cave, he could make great progress in his cultivation and become much more powerful. Besides, warriors were born fearless and they all liked adventures.</p>

  <p>The Dark Nether Cave was the personification of a famous quote which said that wealth was sought from danger. If one wanted to obtain more, one needed to gamble more and, maybe, even gamble their own life. It was easy to lead a smooth and safe life, but since they had chosen to become warriors, why would they choose to be mediocre now?</p>

  <p>As soon as Jarrod finished speaking, everyone's hearts tightened, and they quickly descended towards the cave bottom!</p>

  <p>The cave was astonishingly and imperceptibly tall. Some tall mountains could be seen towering in the distance, and even their peaks didn't seem to be touching the top of the cave.</p>

  <p>A fast wind blew past Luo Zheng's ears, and he landed firmly on the ground.</p>

  <p>Xun didn't stay inside his body anymore and came out armed, holding a long spear in her hand, as if she was a ghost floating beside Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Since she had chosen to fully assist Luo Luo Zheng, she was going to go all out now.</p>

  <p>"There are plants here?" Luo Zheng's keen eyes caught sight of some black plants growing on the ground.</p>

  <p>Even a top-level war lord would have been unable to withstand the Dark Nether Death Light. How could these plants grow there?</p>

  <p>Hearing Luo Zheng's words, Fabian replied carefully, "These plants seem to be able to resist the Dark Nether Death Light. But as for just exactly how they are doing that and what principle lies behind their survival, I fear that is out of my league too..."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng didn't ask too much. There were too many mysteries in this world for him to study them all.</p>

  <p>After all the human warriors had landed, Fabian carefully looked around.</p>

  <p>Just as he was about to lead the group forward, an accident suddenly occurred.</p>

  <p>"Ah!"</p>

  <p>An intense scream came from somewhere behind them.</p>

  <p>"Shut up! What do you want? Death? You need to be silent in the Dark Nether Cave. Who made that ungodly noise?" Fabian roared angrily in a low voice.</p>

  <p>Although the number of warriors entering the Dark Nether Cave had increased several folds this time, they would still be in danger and even meet their death if the monsters at the outer area of the cave became aware of their arrival.</p>

  <p>"That wasn't us..." someone whispered to Fabian.</p>

  <p>Everyone looked towards the source of the voice. Under the dim red light, a black bird appeared not far away. The bird was at least a hundred feet long, and its large mouth took up half of its body. Above its big mouth, there were two scarlet eyes which were glued on the warriors.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the most dreadful sight was that the bird was holding an orc war lord of top level inside its mouth. Half of the war lord's body was hanging outside its mouth, and the other half had already been devoured by the bird!</p>

  <p>After the group of orc warriors left the Tower of Sin, they had descended rapidly down into the cave. However, just as they were landing, they had encountered this bird...</p>

  <p>"What a fierce, large bird." Luo Zheng's face revealed a hint of fear. Even a top-level war lord couldn't avoid the attack of such a gigantic creature. Just as Miguel had said, the Dark Nether Cave was incomparably dangerous.</p>

  <p>The other orc warriors quickly dodged the bird's sights and some timid ones even flew up, trying to return to the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>However, before the warriors who wanted to fly back to the Tower of Sin could enter the small door at the top of the tower, another shadow flashed by. There wasn't just one large bird in the cave; there were actually more than a dozen such beasts here! Even a war lord of top level wouldn't be able to avoid the attacks of so many giant birds. Every single orc was taken in by the creatures.</p>

  <p>Those top-level war lords were top warriors in the Tower of Sin, but in front of these giant birds, they had no power to resist...</p>

  <p>"It's the Swallowing Bird! "We're really unlucky to have met them right now. We need to leave this place quickly! Come on!"</p>

  <p>Fabian pulled a long face. They had just walked out of the Tower of Sin and encountered these humongous creatures, which was the worst possible start they could have made. Three years ago, Fabian had also come across such kind of fierce birds, and he had almost lost his life that time! Previously, he had only met three Swallowing Birds, and had managed to avoid their attacks somehow. But even then, four human war lords of top level had been eaten by the birds.</p>

  <p>Under Fabian's urging suggestion, all the human warriors started to run in one direction.</p>

  <p>At the same time, many of the birds suddenly turned around and began to chase after them.</p>

  <p>"Burn them with fire!"</p>

  <p>"If we do that, we might attract more attention from the other monsters and they might come over here sooner than we can say 'burn'!"</p>

  <p>"We can't care so much! These strange birds are afraid of fire. Laertes, Vernon, set fire! Now!"</p>

  <p>Under Fabian's command, the two top-level war lords suddenly turned their heads. With a wave of their hands, their life vitality gushed out and a roaring flame spurted out.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the human war generals were weaker than the Demon Night and the ogres, but after the human warriors became war lords or war sages, then such cultivators, especially those who cultivated life vitality, were not weaker than the other races. This was another testimony to the fact that the human body was highly suitable for the life vitality cultivation.</p>

  <p>This was also the reason why humans could occupy four seats on the top of the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>Two flames, both of differing yet vibrant colors, shot out from the war lords' hands, forming a dense fire net that completely sealed off all escape routes for the birds.</p>

  <p>Just as Fabian had said, these strange Swallowing Birds were indeed afraid of the flames. Each of them opened their mouths and let out high-pitched cries, circling around the fire net, but didn't dare to break through it.</p>

  <p>However, after circling for a while, those strange birds quickly rose in the air, passed the fire net and continued diving down.</p>

  <p>Laertes Chen, and Vernon He followed behind and covered the others as the dozens of warriors were rushing forward. Even then, they couldn't shake off these strange birds.</p>

  <p>"Ah!"</p>

  <p>This time, the person who had screamed was a level ten war general who was also a saint-level talent of the Purple Heart Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>In the past, humans only had a few seats in the Tower of Sin and almost all of the twenty slots they had were allocated to very powerful and high level war lords. Not a single war general had ever gotten a chance to enter the Dark Nether Cave before. However, this time, since the humans had a fair share of seats in the tower, the number of warriors who were allowed to enter the Dark Nether Cave was significantly higher. Thus some young war generals were also in the cave today.</p>

  <p>The saint-level cultivator who had been attacked kept on running along with the others, but half of his body had been bitten off by the Swallowing Bird.</p>

  <p>"Kill this strange bird!"</p>

  <p>As a war lord of top level was running, he flipped in the air, and a long bow appeared in his hand. On both ends of the long bow hung two ghost statues.</p>

  <p>His practice was so intense that as he turned around, his hand was already on the bowstring, and his life vitality had already condensed itself into the shape of a purple arrow.</p>

  <p>The two ghost statues suddenly emitted an orange glow and the war lord released his grip. A long purple arrow shot out!</p>

  <p>"Swoosh!"</p>

  <p>The arrow was surprisingly fast and before the others even managed to see it properly, it had already reached the strange bird.</p>

  <p>"Bam!" The power of this long arrow was extremely terrifying and everyone's eyes lit up at the explosion. They all hoped that this arrow would be effective.</p>

  <p>However, when the arrow reached the creature, it couldn't even break through its skin and the explosion was in vain. How could the humans possibly harm the bird in the slightest?</p>

  <p>"These strange birds live in the Dark Nether Cave and are able to withstand the Dark Nether Death Light. Their defensive capabilities are extremely astonishing! It is very difficult to kill them! The only way to get rid of them is to use fire and burn them!" Fabian said as he led the other warriors forward.</p>

  <p>As the leader of the group, he didn't have the time to turn around and fight against the Swallowing Birds.</p>

  <p>Currently, everyone was at a loss, and Fabian was one of the few who had some familiarity with the Dark Nether Cave among the humans. He was very clear that if they ran in the wrong direction inside the cave, it was very likely that they would be completely annihilated. So he wanted to lead everyone on the right path and get out of danger.</p>

  <p>"Ah..."</p>

  <p>Another miserable shriek rang out. The arrow from the top-level war lord had hit the Swallowing Bird but the only effect it had made was to successfully infuriate the strange bird. With a dive, the bird caught the war lord in its jaws.</p>

  <p>The human warriors' complexions became even paler. At this rate, most of them would be eaten up by these strange birds!</p>

  <p>"Quack!"</p>

  <p>A Swallowing Bird circled around, and then charged towards Luo Luo Zheng, setting him up as its target.</p>

  <p>"You can't!"</p>

  <p>"Protect Luo Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>Fabian and Jarrod instantly became anxious.</p>

  <p>Before Luo Luo Zheng returned from the Purple Heart Sacred Place, Miguel had been extremely worried about Luo Luo Zheng since the latter was going to enter the Dark Nether Cave. Therefore, he had instructed Fabian and Jarrod that they must do their best to protect Luo Luo Zheng, even at the cost of their own lives.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's strength was not bad, but Fabian and others didn't think he could resist this invulnerable strange bird!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyebrows creased as he saw the Swallowing Bird fly closer and closer. He wasn't sure if he would be able to beat this strange bird.</p>

  <p>Yolande, wearing a pair of wooden clogs, was standing about ten feet away from Luo Luo Zheng. Seeing the bird getting closer, she slightly pressed her two fingers together and was about to make her move. However, when she saw Xun's expression, a faint light flashed in her eyes and she restrained herself from taking any action.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Xun looked completely indifferent. The long spear in her hand had already stuck out. It looked like this seemingly casual spear strike contained a terrifying power!</p>
